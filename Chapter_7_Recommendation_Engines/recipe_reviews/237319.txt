Made this meatloaf last night and it was delicious! Made it exactly according to the recipe and it's a winner in my book. My husband has always been, "ehhhh" with meatloaf, but not anymore. Thx Chef.

We love meatloaf in our family and we love leftovers.  When I told my boyfriend I was going to make meatloaf from Chef John's recipe because I wanted to taste the brown sugar, mustard, cider vinegar glaze, he asked me to add venison to the mix. Aside from that, I followed the recipe to a "T".  What can I say..."mouthwatering, flavorful, moist", I was almost giddy by the end of the meal because my boyfriend kept commenting how delicious this version of meatloaf is. The biggest compliment was when he said "This will have to be made at the cottage on a long weekend". Thank you Chef John for another one of your wonderful tried, true and tasted creations.

I tried to follow this recipe exactly, but didn't have tarragon on hand, so I substituted fennel seeds. I love the flavor of the glaze. I love everything about this meatloaf - the texture, the flavor. Delicious.
 Edit - I was craving this recipe, but only had ground pork. It turned out so well, I might always make it with pork from now on. Great flavor combination.

Excellent meatloaf with an excellent glaze.  Next time I make it I intend to follow the recipe more closely.  I substituted milk and lemon juice for buttermilk and white sugar and molasses for brown sugar and yellow mustard for Dijon.  Also, I used a half pound of breakfast sausage to add flavor.  I don't think this recipe needs the extra boost.  I had to laugh at the review that said this made too much meatloaf.  She should see how my tall, hulking sons pile food on a plate.

I made this meatloaf for the first time 6 weeks ago....I have made it 3 times since then and I'm making it today. It is so moist and has a great texture! I made it for my boyfriend's family. His uncle "needs" to have gravy with everything so I made Chef John's Mushroom gravy with it to serve on mashed potatoes. It was a dish of delish! This is also wonderful the next day in sandwiches on good white bread with Boston lettuce and mayo....Yum! Thanks Chef John!

This was a really good recipe . I will definitely  use this recipe again.   I didn't have  the tarragon  so It was omitted. The glaze was unique and both my  husband and I really enjoyed it. Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely loved this! It was a nice change from typical meatloaf with ketchup glaze.  The meat was so moist and the glaze delicious, I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have tarragon so I used a little fresh parsley, I think this recipe would work great with any herbs.

A good, simple, dense meatloaf (held together very well for slicing). I tweaked the recipe a bit: omitted the tarragon (don't much care for the stuff), used matzo meal for breadcrumbs, and substituted spicy brown (Gulden's) mustard for Dijon in glaze. My lunch for the week at the office, works well sliced and nuked.

Surprisingly good but produces way too much meatloaf.  Cut the meat down to 1 1/2 lbs and it should be just as good and still feed 4 without a problem.

My family liked this recipe and enjoyed the brown sugar glaze over the usual tomato based glaze.  I couldn't find ground chuck in the market.  They said they don't get much call for it and buy it in tubes (which they didn't have a high opinion of...) so I got a 3 lb chuck steak and had them grind it for me.( I also took the bone for making stock.) I weighed out the 2-1/2 lbs at home.  The video has a lot of good pointers in it - even for a long time cook like me!  I recommend that you watch it.
The meatloaf was very moist almost too moist - but better moist than dry!

Everyone in my house LOVED this recipe! I was a little skeptical about the glaze because my husband detests anything mustard or vinegar, but this completely won his approval! Loaf #2 is currently in the oven, and I am sure it will become a regular in the dinner rotation. Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I only had 2.25 pounds of ground beef so I tried to adjust all the other ingredients accordingly. The meatloaf was a little “crumbly”, not as firm as in the photos however it was delicious. The recipe doesn’t say what kind of ground beef to use-I’d read online for meatloaf use 70%-80% lean so I used 75%. The glaze was good but neither my husband or myself is too crazy about sweet glazes so I think next time I’ll just skip the glaze and cover with bacon.

This is a wonderful meatloaf. It makes great sammies too. If you don't have butter milk handy sour cream works just as well. Use an equal amount.  It's a dish of delish!!!

Best meat loaf I've ever made!  We had a snow blizzard today, so I could not get to the store, but I had buttermilk and 1lb each of ground pork and lean ground beef, in the freezer, so that is what I used. I cut the buttermilk back a bit because I did not have 2 1/2 lbs of meat total...just 2 lbs. I also substituted organic chili sauce for the catsup.  Soooo good.

Made it almost exactly as written except for the glaze.  Did not have Dijon so I will try the glaze the next time I make this.  And I will make it again.  So flavorful.  Oh yes, I used 1 1/2 lb.ground beef and 1 lb. gr. chicken. I did bake it for a bit more than an hour.  Found that 45 minutes just was not quite enough time.

The so-called "savory Buttermilk Meatloaf" It did not live up to its promise. I found it bland and anything but savory.  I don't know what could have saved it, probably fewer breadcrumbs would have been a start, but the recipe was far from tasty. No kick from any of the herbs and spices. Not something I shall repeat!.

I made this meatloaf for my family last night as directed The only exception being that I added to pressed clothes of garlic to the onion mixture near the end of the sauteing. oh and I also substituted one teaspoon of the regular salt for seasoned salt, just to get a little of that celery hint. anyway it was an excellent meatloaf. The brown sugar apple cider Dijon topping was to die for. I put it on when there was about 45 minutes left because I wanted to make sure all the vinegar was cooked off. The tarragon was a delightful and interresting surprise. The family loved it and went back for seconds. I've made chef John's other meatloaf that involves using a lot of vegetables, which I enjoyed as well, but this one was a lot easier though likely not as healthy

This is delicious! I recommend printing out the ingredient list and watching the video as you put ingredients. There are some great tips in the video that are not in the printed directions.

This was great meatloaf!  Made the ML as in the recipe. Smoked it on the Big Green Egg at 350 degrees until internal temp of 160 degrees. Around 120 degrees, glazed it with Sweet Baby Ray’s Barbecue Sauce.   Will make again!!  Thanks

This is great.  Made no changes.  Everyone at the table asked for seconds.  I guess I have found my  perfect meatloaf after 80 years!!!  Thank you so much.

Never again! Didn't even taste like meatloaf even though the recipe sounded delicious. The topping was way too sweet. I'll stick with my own mixture of this and that.
