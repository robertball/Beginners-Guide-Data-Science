I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It is sooooooo good! I used fresh squeezed lime juice. I marinated my pork chops in a 9x9 pyrex dish and then cooked it at 350 degrees in the marinade for an hour. I covered the pan during baking with foil. The pork has such a great flavor. I made the sauce but the pork is fantastic even without it.

I made these yummy chops last night and everyone loved them! My 3 kids ate a whole pork chop each.  (This never happens)  After reading the previous reviews, I made the sauce as instructed.  I tasted a bit, and decided to double the honey, lime juice, and browning sauce.  I just let the sauce slowly simmer for about 20 minutes while I prepared the rest of dinner.  I also quickly browned the chops and turned the heat to low and covered with a lid.  It was ready in about 5 to 10 minutes.  This avoided the burning from the honey in the marinade, and released some juice that I added to the sauce. It was fabulous and we will definetely be making this again!

I don't know what some of these reviewers were thinking!  If they didn't like this recipe, I'm sure that they messed it up.  These pork chops were wonderful, and really not difficult at all.  They make a great summer meal served with fresh steamed vegetables and potatoes from the garden.  I highly recommend it!

I used sweetened lime juice and several shakes of salt (aobut 1 tsp) instead of soy sauce.  I substituted with garlic powder and onion powder, instead of cloves.  I marinated this mixture overnight.  The pork came out wonderfully.  I didn't even make the sauce.  It wasn't necessary.  This was delicious.  I really enjoyed the lime/honey flavor, which was abundant.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a very disappointing recipe.  Where is the honey-lime?  You do add some of both, but you cannot taste them ... anywhere.  The soy sauce is extremely overpowering.  I would decrease the amount to 1/2 or even 1/4 of it's original amount.  It's nice to be able to marinade the chops for so long, but the sauce ends up burning when you cook the chops, so voila, you have burnt chops.  For the advance prep and list of ingredients requested for this recipe, the end result makes it certainly not worth making or wasting good pork chops.  From these garlicky chops, all I can say is that if I want to visit Transylvania, I can go there without worry of being bitten by Dracula.

These were wonderful!!  We marinaded them over night instead of a few hours.  They were SO good.  I haven't eaten my leftovers yet, but my husband has and and he said they weren't as good the next day.  You couldn't taste the sauce as much.  But the were great the first time around.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted like straight soy sauce.  No flavors of anything else came through.

If it were just me rating this I would give this recipe a 2 or a low 3 as I did not care for it much.  I thought it was too soy saucy and not enough of the honey lime flavor I was expecting.  However, my dinner guests RAVED about it and the combined children(mine and theirs)all liked it too. So since the other 5 people liked it I rated it higher.

I thought tis recipe was ok. I think it had a little bit of a weird taste, not quite like i expected. My mom and dad liked it though. I think i will try this again, maybe with a little less soy sauce

I marinated 3 very thick boneless chops for what turned out to be 2 days.  I sliced them up at the last minute to make sure they cooked evenly.  I screwed up and used brown sugar in the marinade instead of the honey.  When I made the sauce, the only other thing I added was tequila.  I pan fried the pork and served the sauce on the side.  We all loved it, including my 9 yr old son.

I didn't think these had much taste.  They were, however, moist.  I also didn't really like the sauce, but my husband said it was good.

I have made these twice in one week by request!  I took reviewers advice and put less soy.  I didn't make sauce.  I made two marinades. One for marinade and simmered the other for sauce. Needless to say they are a hit!  Thanks!  I forgot to add that I baked covered - turned and uncovered then broiled.

The marinade for these pork chops was summery, light, and refreshing.  I marinated two boneless chops overnight, then broiled for 8-9 minutes per side.  (**These are Costco pork chops, VERY thick**)  They were juicy and delicious. I had leftover Chinese noodles from a salad, so I sliced the pork and served with the salad.  So healthy.

The marinade for these pork chops are delicious.  I didn't care much for the sauce but the marinade by itself is awesome.  We can hardly eat regular pork chops without this marinade.  If you love garlic like we do, you will love this recipe!!!

I thought this had a great mild flavor...not too sweet but just perfect.  My husband's comment was - Wow, now this is restaurant quality.  The pork turned out SO tender with the marinade.  I agree with another reviewer that the sauce isn't really necessary if you are in a hurry, but it is pretty quick to make either way.  Definately keeping this in my recipe box!

Sorry, not too sure about this one.  I am a lime lover and although the chops were juicy, they just didn't have a great flavor.  (I marinated them in a plastic bag over night before grilling on the bbq.  May try it again, but something was definitely missing...

I marinated these for about 50 hours, unintentionally. By the time I was able to cook them, I forgot all about the sauce. I will try it next time. We enjoyed these: the main taste was lime.

The lime lends a very nice flavour to the pork chops. I marinated them overnight, and for the first time ever my chops were not dry! Even my meat-hating kids ate their full portion. (I did not make the sauce, however. I just didn't want to. May make it in the future, sometime.)

So salty, and the sweet (from honey) and sour (from lime) flavors were NOT there.

Awesome recipe!  Everyone loves it, its easy, and its stuff you might already have at your house!  I made it several times now and if you dont have time to marinaide, use this slices of pork and tenderize.  Let sit for even 10 or 20 minutes and grill with the marinaide.  Then add sauce and it tastes great!  Sauce isnt necessary, but it adds juiciness :)

I used this recipe on boneless chicken breasts and it turned out great!  I didnt have browning sauce, but I dont know that it would have made a huge difference.  I wouldnt omit the sauce though, it adds to the tangy lime flavor the meat takes on when marinating.

I liked this recipe very much, I grilled it on a George Forman grill and it turned out wonderful, I also added a squeeze of fresh lime at the end to give it a little extra pop of lime.

love the flavor of the pork chops, but not wild about the sauce at all.  will definitely make the marinated pork chops alone in the future!
