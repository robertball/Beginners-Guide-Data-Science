My son and I made this and enjoyed it. It wasn't quite sweet enough for us (we added some more sweetener and re-blended) but the flavor was really good. My biggest struggle was getting the cubes out of the tray (probably my error as we rarely use them.) The frozen mixture adhered to them more than I expected. I left it out to thaw slightly, so I could pop them out more easily.
