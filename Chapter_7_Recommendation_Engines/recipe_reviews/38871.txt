I have been making these for quite some time now. I give the original recipe 4 stars, because they are kind of bland. However, I made a few adjustments the second time I made them and this is how I have made them ever since. To the cheese mixture I add four minced cloves of garlic or 1 and 1/2 tsp. powder, a couple of small, cooked, shredded chicken breasts, these are usually leftovers, a can of green chilies, and a small minced jalapeno pepper. In place of the salsa, I use a large can of enchilada sauce. Since I prefer my cheese on top browned, I use the fat free cheese in the cheese mixture, but sprinkle 1/2 cup of a mexican cheese blend over the top along with some chopped green onions. Much tastier this way.

This was a huge hit and very quick to make.  We did make a few changes - like some other cooks that reviewed this, we bought a can of enchilada sauce instead of salsa and placed a little sauce on the bottom of the pan (to avoid sticking or burning of the shell).  We added a little less cream cheese and a little more cheddar, and placed a small amount of refried beans in each, and enchilada sauce of each shell.  Garnished with chopped tomatoes, green onions, and sour cream and the mixture of flavors was very good.  The only thing we might change is we might try corn tortillas next time instead of flour - the flour tortillas were very soft and flimsy after being cooked with all the cheese and sauce.

Gosh!!  I hate to be the sourpuss, but this turned out to be one of those recipes that sounded like it would be great, and was a big disappointment.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I had expected the creamcheese to melt and blend with the cheddar adding a creamy texture.  Intead it was just a blob of melted cheese in a shell that while melted did not blend well and tasted overwhelmingly of cream cheese.  Very unmexican and the family was disppointed that I had used their favorite cream cheese for bagels to make this disastor.

Very disapointing!  I did made a few changes to this recipe.  I bought a can of enchilada sauce to replace the salsa, and used Mexican 4-cheese blend.  Still, the taste of cream cheese was overwhelming.  I felt as if I was eating an Italian dish instead of something that was suppose to be Mexican.  Even my cheese-crazy husband hated it.

If you like cream cheese and your Mexican food less than spicy, you may like this, otherwise, stay away!

Very easy recipe....and my 1 year old ate it up quickly.  I did use enchilada sauce instead of the salsa and added some green chiles and black beans (per the advice of other reviewers).  Thank you for the post.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe, and we loved the results!!  I added chicken and spices to the cream cheese.  Then before baking, I brushed with garlic butter (or olive oil) and baked for the full amount of time.  Then I poured green enchilada sauce over the top and sprinkled the cheese on that.  Cooking the tortillas first prevents the sogginess that tends to happen otherwise.  Delicious!!

I also added ground beef to our enchiladas, as we both love meat.  I poured Ranchero Sauce on the bottom of the glass baking dish and laid them on top of it.  We put some sour cream on top when it was done and it turned out delicious!  Will definitely make this one again.

My kids loved this and it was so easy as well. I started them the night before
and all I had to do before dinner was put on the sauce and cheese and bake them.
I think it needs a bit more cooking time than stated in the recipe and I added a 
bit of cottage cheese for fun which tasted great. I think it would be great to add some
finely chopped cooked vegetables for a nice all in one balanced meal.

I made mine with ground lean beef (sauteed onions and green chilies with meat) and used slightly larger tortillas to accomodate.  These were very good!  Approved by whole family - even husband who usually doesn't like Mexican.  Serve right out of the oven - or else cream cheese becomes thick again and very heavy.  Not as good as some longer Mexican recipes but so much quicker and easier!!

Great recipe. I used suggestions from fellow cooks and added chicken and enchilada sauce. I sprinkled the chicken with some taco seasoning prior to putting on the grill. I also used some taco seasoning in the cream cheese as well. I added refried beans to the mix and spread that on first. All in all it turned out great and my friends rave about it!!

My family love this recipe.  It makes a lot but it freezes great.  If I need a covered dish or to send food to a family, I just add a bag of corn chips and salsa.

This was a huge hit - I did not wrap them individually because the tortillas I had were small.  This ended up being great because I added grilled chicken and my in-laws, son and husband were all crazy about it!!!

This seemed like such a hit-and-miss recipe but I thought I'd take a chance. I added some cubed cooked chicken to the mix and used enchilada sauce instead of salsa. I don't think the taste resembles that of an enchilada BUT we thought it was "interestingly good." I'm not being mean when I say this but it somewhat reminded me of a baked cheese ball wrapped in tortillas. I don't regret trying the recipe but I'm not sure how often I'll make it.

I revised the recipe a bit and added hamburg plus enchilada sauce and these came out great.  My husband doesn't care for enchiladas, but he found these to be very good.  I will be making this recipe again.

Five Stars! Awesome. I thought they were fantastic. I added scallions and next time I will add garlic and chicken, but they were GREAT! I liked the chunkiness of the salsa. Gave it texture.

These turned out very well, even with all the modifications I made.  I had less of both cheeses available so I cooked chicken breasts and added shredded chicken to the enchiladas.  (I used about Â½ - Â¾ of a brick of cream cheese and 1 cup of shredded cheddar).   I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I didnâ€™t use the green onions at all.  I added strips of Velveeta to the top of the enchiladas before baking and drizzled chopped, diced jalapeÃ±os (canned).  They were very tasty and got a "thumbs up" from the family.

Very yummy recipe! It was very easy to put together and flexible since I had to substitute cheddar with mozzarella, and salsa with green onions. And my daughter loved it! So did I! Thanks.

These were very quick and easy to make.  My husband liked them. I thought they were pretty good but were a little mushy for my taste.  I will probably make these again but put less filling per tortilla and cook longer since mine were not hot enough when removed from the oven.

I was surprised to be able to make my own Mexian-restaurant-quality cheese enchiladas, plus they are very low-fat and food exchange info is provided.  This is our new household favorite.

My husband and son love these.  I've added chicken at times and beans at other times but the plain cheese is still their favaorite.  It's easy and cheap.

These were well received when I made them.  Very easy. I added chicken and used the enchilada sauce as a previous reviewer had recommended.  I might cut down on the cheese on top...it looked like too much but it tasted really good.  This is a simple and tasty recipe that I will gladly make again. Thanks!

I have made these a few times before and they always turned out pretty well. The cream cheese and the regular cheese did melt together. I would like to try some type of meat in them instead of all the cheese...as yeah, they can be a bit bland. And I'm not real crazy about all the salsa...that usually gets scraped off. But my husband likes them.

I don't know that I would consider these impressive, but they are easy and quick, which on a week night does earn them at least three stars.  I used canned enchilada sauce rather than salsa and green chilis rather than green onions.

This is a great "go to" recipe...I did revise things a bit though.  Instead of salsa I used red enchilada sauce (you can get it in a can for 70 cents at the store) and put black beans across the top of the enchiladas before baking. This is a VERY filling meal!!!

*Additional review from last post on 7/2004*

I still use this recipe, but have made more adjustments.  First, I boil some chicken breasts in salsa,chicken broth, cumin and chili powder then shread and add to the enchiladas.  Additionally, when I want to add some "kick" to the meal I will throw in a can of diced chile's to the cream cheese mixture.  :)

ok for a quick fix meal.  i subbed white onion and added chiptle chile and spinach, which improved it somewhat.  would be even better with less cream cheese and enchilada sauce over top instead of salsa

I was hesitant at first with this recipe because of the cream cheese- but they were DELISIOUS! Extremely cheesy. I added white onions to go along with the green onions, and instead of cheddar cheese I used Kraft's mexican 4 cheese package. Extremely good!

These enchilladas are a good choice for those looking to cook a tastey treat but without meat. Personally, for me, these were rich and somewhat satisfying, but I do prefer my old standbye beef or chicken enchilladas. The cream cheese in these is good, but I find it to be a bit too much. My fiance actually took a few bites of these and said, "What!? No meat!?" :-0

I added chicken but otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  I didn't care for it at all and my husband (who normally loves all mexican dishes) thought it was mediocre.  A little too much cream cheese & salsa flavor I think.  Oh well.

This was so quick and easy for us. We just added some canned refried beans to the shell and added some more cheese on top. Since we ran out of onions, I just sprinkled some dried chopped onions in the cheese mixture. We both loved them!

This was pretty good! I purchased a can of enchilada sauce and added a little to the cheesy mixture before rolling them up, then covered them entirely with the rest of the sauce. Youngest daughter found them too spicy with this sauce on it, but the rest of us liked it. I may try this as is in the recipe, using a mild salsa so that my daughter might like it next time.

This is a great fast, easy recipe. I forgot to add the green onion to the cheese mixture, but neither my husband or I missed it. The salsa has onions in it, so that may be why.

Kids loved it.  I followed the directions but added more cheddar cheese, chopped up white onion and used enchilada sauce instead of the salsa.  No leftovers!

WOW!  This was really good.  I made a few modifications, I added chicken and just a touch of salsa to the cream cheese.  I took another suggestion and added slices of velveeta to the top.  YUMMY!  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the fast and delicious recipe.

These were just "okay" to me.  I think adding chicken would have made them pretty good.  Also, next time I think I will add my own salsa recipe instead of the jar salsa.

Really liked this recipe!  I used corn tortillas instead of flour as one member suggested, but wouldn't recommend it; the corn tortillas break apart when your folding them, and they still turned out a bit soggy.  Still, it had great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Great, easy recipe!  My boyfriend said it was the best enchilada he's ever had.  I put cooked chicken in some of the enchiladas, and pepperoni in the others.  Both were delicious!  Also, I used a lot less cream cheese, enough to make it creamy, but not overbearing in taste.

These were a little too mushy.  It just seemed like they were missing something.  Nextime, maybe I'll add some kind of chicken or something to it.
