We just call this "gari" in Nigeria.  You can also experiment and use different types of flour such as yam flour (my personal favorite) or even Farina.  

It's very sticky so I suggest serving with a small bowl of water to dip your fingers in before making the small ball.

I haven't tried this recipe exactly, but I was taught this dish using semolina flour.  It's very delicious with any kind of African stew!

I'm in Nigeria right now and seeing this recipe makes my heart glad! Yes, it really needs to be eating with soup to really appreciate its goodness.

I lived in Tanzania for 8 years and they make a similar dish with corn flour, called ugali.  I usually add a bit of salt to give it some flavor, but this is optional.  I'm used to it being served with kidney beans prepared in fresh coconut milk... mmmmmm!

I made the Gari according to instructions but it is a brand new food to me and I was not excited about dipping it in soup--maybe in time-- so I let it cool a bit and made flat patties with it that I fried in oil and the at the end tossed on onions for a short time, I like my onions more raw. I make this almost everyday. It has become a staple in my diet. I love it. I eat it crispy with simple guacamole--avacado, onion, lemon, fresh garlic, salt and pepper-- and with herbed greek yogurt---salt and pepper and minced greens and fresh garlic, on a plate with cooked bitter greens, such as turnip or mustard greens. I cannot believe I found this food! I didn't even know I was looking forit. It was at the food shelf and I was curious. Now I don't go a day without it.

It's an intersesting new food, and I like it pretty well.   It has an interesting natural flavor, dipped in several different sauces takes the natural flavor away.   See what you think!  :-)

This my first attempt at eba. It came out a but lumpy. I think I will try turning off the heat before adding the gari. It is very good though. I served it with a lentil based soup. Thank you for the recipe.
