This is a very good variation of Steak Au Poivre. The cream sauce is very nice. The only thing I did differently was to cook the filets less. It is a standard misconception that 130 is medium rare. Not true. 120 will come up to medium rare,(125), once it sits for 5-7 minutes. Do NOT cut into the meat or poke it with a thermometer to check for doneness as all the juices will leak out. Figure 2-1/2 minutes per side on medium high for med rare. Please do not overcook filet. There is no fat on this cut and no margin for error!

Great recipe!  I substituted milk for the heavy cream because that is what I had on hand.  I added a little flour to help the sauce thicken.  The filets came out perfect.  I cooked them 4 min. each side.

I love beef with a creamy pepper sauce and this did not disapoint.  I kicked the recipe up to my tastes as follows:  Try with a NY Strip intead of the Filet.
I coated the beef the with lots of coarsly cracked pepper and rubbed it in well.  After I browned it in a scorching hot pan, i deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of brandy  I turned the heat to med and added about a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots, then followed that with a little beef stock and let that cook to reduce a little.  After that I added the heavy cream slowly until I had enough suace.  I let that stay on the heat until it thickened a bit  then poured it over the beef. It is a delicious sauce.
Other cuts of beef work as well if not better than filet.  Try this recipe with a ny strip  before you take the plunge to filet.

AWESOME!!!  I tweaked it a bit -instead of peppercorn I used a "Spicy Garlic" seasoning in a "grinder".  It worked out so well...and the cream sauce was delicious!!  I've been trying to find a recipe for this cream sauce that I had at Sajo's, it came with my "steak bites" I had ordered...This sauce tastes just like it!!  This recipe goes to the top of my list!!

This was very good. My fiance and I had this for our anniversary and it did not disappoint. I prepared it exactly as written, except for letting the sauce simmer longer than the 6-8 recommended minutes. It took longer than that to reduce down, about 10 - 15 minutes on medium heat in a large skillet.  Word to the wise - Don't leave the sauce on the heat- even on low. I thought to keep it warm in case he wanted more sauce, and the cream came apart and ruined the sauce.   I'll definitely be making this again. It tastes amazingly close to a meal I had at a very fancy French restaurant. Now I'll be able to make it at home! Thanks for sharing.

Very delicious, yet simple to make! I ended up using New York strip steaks. Also mixed some garlic powder with the salt and ground peppercorns before rubbing it on the steak. I served it with Rosemary Roasted Potatoes (another recipe on this site)

I did find it steamed/smoked a lot, and wound up setting off my smoke detector. Next time might reduce the heat slightly (and maybe just open the window while cooking)

I've been doing a similar recipe like this for years, but I flame the meat with cognac before adding the cream. Light cream is fine, but I advise against using milk or 1/2 & 1/2. The milk  will always curdle. To flame anything, remove the pan from the heat, pour on a jigger of cognac, avert your face and ignite the cognac. Don't be alarmed if it flames up a lot. Alcohol burns at a lower temperature than most things, but if you're not careful, you could set your kitchen cabinets on fire. Set the meat aside to keep warm while you deglaze the pan with a small glass of red wine and stock. Let it cook down to half its volume, then add the cream and stir in a pat of butter for each filet. Enjoy!

This was a very delicious recipe. I used a shoulder steak, not a filet, but it gave class to a cheaper cut. I rubbed a tiny bit of garlic onto the steaks and also used half and half because that's what I had. It also took a little while for the sauce to thicken so I added a bit of cornstarch. All in all very good and will make again.

wonderful, but a minor quibble -- it should be "filets migon" -- the filet being plural, not the mignon.  :)

This recipe is very similar to one I used to have in a French cookbook years ago. I like to deglaze the fry pan with 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier, then add cream that has already been whipped, that way you use less cream, slightly healthier (yikes). Drizzle the steaks with the sauce. Rib steaks or tenderloin. Great recipe

Straightforward and delicious.  For a healthier option, substitute fat free half and half for the cream and fat free beef broth.  Definitely need the meat thermometer - our filets took a lot longer to cook and were still more on the medium rare side.

I make almost the exact same recipe and I really love it. The small exception is adding 8 extra large shrimp (4 per person) My Mom taught me how to check if Filet Mignon is Medium Rare without a thermometer or even worse, cutting into the steak. Make a fist (not too tight - if you are digging your fingernails into your palm that is too tight) and push on the top of the fat pad (between your thumb and finger) if the fat pad area gives about 1/4" it's Medium Rare. For Medium Well, Turn your fist over and press on the fat pad at the base of your thumb. These tricks work every time.

This is a great recipe, thank you.  Two changes though...I deglazed with a splash of Sherry along with the beef broth and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the cream to thicken the sauce.  The sauce may have been a little bland for our taste without the Sherry. This recipe deserves a 5 star rating despite my preferences. 
Shame on the reviewer for writing about grammatical errors???

Yummy yummy!!!! The only thing I would change next time is the amount of peppercorn I add to it. It was just a bit much for my kids but otherwise is a great recipe.

I am pretty much only rating the sauce.  I found the pepper cream sauce to be a bit thin.  I will make this again but with adjustments to provide a thicker sauce.

Absolutly wonderful!  My husband likes peppery things so I first rubbed the steaks with montreal steak spice before cooking.  I added more pepper to the recipe for our liking as well. Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This sauce was so yummy, I can just taste it with sundried tomatoes with pasta...so many possibilities!  I always make it the first time following the recipes pretty close, and it is great as it.  Next time I will crush the peppercorns a bit more, and maybe use a few less..Thanks for a great recipe.  My wheels are spinning with more possibilities for this one!

First time making a cream sauce for steaks. I wanted to dress up our filets mignon with something different and this was great! I halved recipe but added more broth because the halved amount wasn't enough to deglaze the pan. I served sauce on the side because I wasn't sure if we'd like it - but even my picky husband thought it was great as a dipping sauce :) win!

I've made this for my husband several times with twice baked potatoes. I add cognac and use Kosher salt in placeof the table salt. To thicken cause add a little cornstarch. I am considering trying a little crumbled bacon in the sauce. Enjoy!

Very nice recipe. I did not use heavy cream. I'm sure that would have made it outstanding. But for health reasons I used fat free half and half. I also did a blend of butter with a little bit of olive oil.  Flavors were very nice. Simple yet elegant.

Just finished. Every bite. Simple and beyond delicious. Did not have beef broth so I made some out of powdered French onion soup mix. Also used about a 1/1 ratio with cream and the soup mixture. Worked perfectly because of the onions in the soup. Just do it!

This was okay. Too much peppercorn for me. I might try it again with less.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I used porterhouses in place of the filets (they were on a great sale) and they were just wonderful.  When I asked my son if he liked the sauce with his steak, He simply replied..."do you mean the heaven?"  I think that said it all.  This is a keeper.

Awesome. My husband said he wouldn't have had a better steak in a restaurant and raved about it throughout the meal. He asked me to make it again and wants to brag about it to his parents the next time they come over!!!

This was absolutely amazing! The only change I made was that I threw in some sautéed onions and mushrooms to the cream sauce. It was my first time working with filet mignon, and I was worried about ruining such a nice cut so I couldn't believe how perfect and easy everything turned out! I will def be using this recipe for other cuts as well. Thanks for sharing!

When I made this recipe my family left NOTHING behind.  My husband asked me when I can make it again before he was even done with his steak.  So easy and so yummy. I didn't add or change any of the ingredients.  THANKS FOR SHARING.

I substituted NY Strip for the Filet Mignons and added a little cooking sherry to the sauce. These were delicious! I can finally eat steak when the weather doesn't allow for grilling!

I prepared this with boneless sirloin pork chops.  I know, huge substitution, but it WORKED!  I LOVED the sauce and it paired very, very well with the pork chops.  EXACTLY what I was looking for!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, goodeats7!

Ok, I took suggestions from fellow members, I put cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, added some salt to the cream sauce and I had a whole lot of wonderful comments. The steaks turned out really good, but it was a bit harder to get it well done, other from that it turned out 5 stars, would try this again!! Wonderful with the steaks.

The steak taste really good, but the pepper sauce just okay, I feel it's not thick enough, and not enough pepper taste, will double the pepper next time.

Great recipe! I seasoned the steaks with onion & garlic powder in addition to the salt & pepper. I also sauted mushrooms & onions and deglazed the pan with some cooking sherry before adding the beef broth & cream. Everyone loved the steaks and the sauce and there were no leftovers at all! Will definitely make this again!

Easy and delicious.  One caveat is about the peppercorns.  The recipe calls bur 1/4 cup coarsely crushed peppercorns, but my family would have preferred less amount, but they eat them all! The sauce is out of this world!  I will make it again but only using 1/8 cup of the peppercorns.

This is an easy way to prepare pepper sauce steaks. Instructions are clear and the dish is easy to prepare. Personally I found the sauce  too light and with a mild flavor, I would rather have a stronger more peppery flavor; but my guests loved it so I think its a repeat for me.

Made this tonight but with a couple of slight modifications: I added garlic powder along with the onion powder, I added a pat of butter on each side before I stuck it under the broiler to brown the meat better, and I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top for the last two minutes of the final side to give it a nice encrusted flavor. It was AWESOME! The meat was so tender you cut almost cut it with a spoon. Will definitely make this one again.

Loved it. I used a little to much peppercorn for my wife ,but the steak and sauce were wonderful.Used  a RED WINE  to de glaze the pan . We had a fillet that I trimmed off a beef tenderloin that I purchased at Costco.. Go on you tube if you have never trimmed one out before. I  trimmed it out in about 30 min. Before watching  you tube it was 45 min and I made a mess of it.
A great meal. Will have again with a little less peppercorns for my wife

I used coarsely grated black pepper in place of the peppercorns. No heavy cream on hand, so I used non-dairy creamer. Also, no cast iron so I just used a regular non-stick pan, and it was fine. The sauce was thin so I added a little cornstarch. Since I made a smaller version, it reduced too much, so I just spooned the sauce over the filet. I cooked the 1" filet about 2 min per side, and it came out to my liking. I'd rather have it a little rare than too well done anyday! Had this with Superb Sauteed Mushrooms from this site.

I made this for my Ladies' Monthly Supper Club.  It was my first time cooking filet mignon and it turned out perfectly.  I had always stayed away from filet mignon due to the cost if it didn't turn out as planned.  I followed the recipe with the following minimal changes.  I coated the meat with coarsely ground black pepper (vice crushed peppercorns) and covered it in aluminum foil.  As recommended by others, I then let the covered meat stand at room temperature for an hour before cooking.  I used a non-stick fry pan as it was all I had.  I followed the recipe and cooked  the meat for three minutes on each side after which I moved it to a clean dish and let it stand again covered in aluminum foil at room temperature while I finished the sauce and dinner.  When the sauce didn't thicken, I added a small amount of cornstarch and water which did the trick!   I had some unused meat so I cooked the same recipe again a few nights later for my hubby who also loved it!!   Great recipe!

This was really good. My family might prefer a little less pepper next time.

Definitely will make this again, actually have several times since then. I grilled the steak for about 2 minutes on each side to give it some additional smoke flavor, grill marks, and a slightly different texture.

Holy yum. Cooked the steaks sous vide - 130 degrees for two hours. Saved the juice and seared them in a hot pan. Added the reserved juice and then followed the recipe. This was delicious!

We love this recipe when we feel like a steak night during the week. It's quick and very good with a side of garlic mashed potato's. Instead of using tenderloin I use a nice thick T-bone and trim it down to a filet and strip. I also use granulated garlic with the black pepper and kosher salt.

While I LOVE "meat and taters" my health aware wife limits herself to red meat. However, when I had prepared this tasty number she went all in! GREAT recipe and very easy to make.

I made this recipe today for our anniversary dinner.  I was so disappointed.  Made exactly as written and it was bland and boring.  I will never make it again.

Great recipe. Served for Father's Day and as good as any restaurant. I cooked my 1" sirloin steaks for 2 min on med-high each side for a perfect med rare to medium. I've tried it on the BBQ but it doesn't cook them hot enough and wastes the meat, the stove is a much better restaurant style result. I used some fresh ground pepper and some Keg Steak seasoning. For the sauce, I used 1/2 cup beef bouillon, 1/2 cup wine, 1/2 cup 10% cream and a teaspoon of cornstarch and cooked on low for 5 min. Perfect and delicious.

This was very very good!  The only reason I gave it four stars was because I thought the sauce was a little bland.  After making it and tasting it, I add some pepper and some Dijon mustard as another reviewer suggested.  I haven't cooked steaks myself because my husband and sons always cook them on the grill.  My husband was very impressed!  Served it with Roasted Green Beans fro. This site and a roasted purple onion flower!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. But for some extra flavor and a little bit of kick, cut down on the peppercorns and start the sauce with chopped sautéed cherry peppers or jalapeños. That's how it was prepared at a restaurant we went to in Costa Rica and it's awesome.

I did not make the steak part -- just the gravy. We were grilling the steaks but I didn't have baked potatoes -- only a package of Bob Evans mashed.  My mom said her mother used to make an amazing gravy with steaks and served over mashed potatoes. I fiddled around with the recipe a bit and added some Better than Bouillon beef au jus starter with some fresh malabar pepper and the heavy cream etc. I also added some brown gravy starter. I tweaked it until it was what I wanted and it served the purpose very well.

We think that this is a very bland sauce and absolutely dilutes the flavor of a beautiful filet...will not be repeating this mistake again.
