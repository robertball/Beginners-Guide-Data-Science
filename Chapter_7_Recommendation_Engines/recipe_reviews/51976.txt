Yummy. I needed more water than stated to make a batter, but I was using whole wheat flour (all I had). Squeezing the mung bean sprouts as I dropped them in crumbled many nicely while leaving some whole. I omitted the sesame/veggie oil mixture, instead spraying a nonstick pan lightly with cooking spray and sprinkling a mixture of bonito flakes, kelp and toasted sesame seeds on the top side. I just put some more tamari on top to eat. It was so good!

Thank you Kaoru!  This recipe was delicious.  I used all purpose flour almost double the mung bean sprouts and 1/2 cup of shredded carrots.  It turned out perfect with some cayenne pepper sprinkled on top with tamari for dipping.  Very low-calorie too!

I really enjoyed this!  It was very different from anything I've had before.  I used all-purpose flour because that's all that I had on hand.  I thought I was going to need to add more water, but my bean sprouts were still quite wet from when I washed them, so that added enough moisture.  I served the pancakes with a little sriracha on the side.

I gave it 3 stars. These have the potential to be great, but the recipe really needs some help. I added more water too, but the pancakes were too Tamari/ginger intesive w/ little else to offer. Photo looks great, I want THAT recipe.

Delicious pancake!  I incorporated the chili powder into the pancake.  I used zesty sprouts instead of mung bean sprouts, and whole wheat flour instead of barley flour.  I have started my next batch of sprouts to be able to make these again!

I definitely had to add some more water.  This is a simple spicy taste of Asia.  I loved it.

a little strange... I can't decide if I like it or not?!  
It needed more water (enough to make a batter). I didn't have the right sauce, so I substituted it with Tokastu sauce instead.  Also added some toasted sesame seeds.  Needed a bit of salt, and we dipped it in some sushi/sashimi style soy sauce.  My husband thought it kinda tasted like something you might find in a  bar Japan (although never came across it while living there)  Might make again, only as a way to use up leftover sprouts, would not go buy them just of this.

Great new breakfast staple for me. Nice crunchy texture. Here are the changes I made . . . 

1 tbs powdered ginger
1tbs soy sauce
1/8 tsp kosher salt
6 tbs pancake mix
1/4 cup water
1cup mung sprouts
2 tsp hazelnut oil ( all  that I had)
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp smoked paprika
7 or 8 whole cardamom seed pods shelled and ground in a stone pedestal and added to mixture

Pinch of fennel seeds popped in the hot oil before adding the mixture

Heat oil to just barely smirking before adding mixture

Serve with a side of canned peaches, fruit preserves, or horseradish creamed.
