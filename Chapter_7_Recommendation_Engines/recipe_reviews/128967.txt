I give this five stars because it is the best combination of ingredients I have tried for Delicata squash. This is NOT the kind of vegetable that tastes good mashed up with vanilla, cream and cinnamon like pumpkin or sweet potato - (believe me, I tried cooking many ways this morning)The lime and spice bring out the flavor the best. You can add a dash of cayenne if you like. Had to upload my picture after cooking -  Thanks! P.S. The SEEDS are great too. I rinsed and dried them, then baked at 275 for about 30 min. Next, heat up a tsp or less of olive oil in a pan and add lime juice, salt, chili and cayenne pepper to taste. Mix in your seeds and cook for a minute or less. Spread on paper towel and allow to dry before storing.

This was very good!  I cooked it in the crock pot on low for 1-1/2 hours, but didn't change anything else.  Hubby works from home and can turn the crock pot on when needed, so I use the crock whenever I can.

I loved this!  It was easy and was such a nice change from the typical recipes for baking squash (which are invaribly sweet).  It made a wonderful and interesting side dish for a Mexican dinner.

OH MAN!!! This is SO good and so easy to make! The combination of the lime and chili in the lime butter is fantastic! I had to cook my squash for longer than 30 minutes but it was well worth it!

I always grow delicata in the garden so we have fresh picked and delicious squash every year! This recipe just makes it better. My 10 year old even enjoyed this. A keeper of a recipe which I will make again & again.

I am not a squash lover, but that's what we're getting from our CSA now so I was looking for some different things to do with it.  This was delicious!  Definitely make extra lime butter.  One note, as a few others have mentioned, my squash took more like 45-50 minutes to bake and, even then, one of them could have used a little more time, so allow more than 30 minutes.

Made this after picking up a delicata at the farmers' market a few months back.  This was super tasty... the lime butter was great.  I put it on everything for days!

I just made this and filled the squash cavity with brown rice, but I think it would be even better with quinoa in the middle. Like some others, I let the squash go for about 45 min so the rice and squash were ready at the same time. Next time I might stir a dash of hot sauce in with the chili-lime butter, but this was so great and a welcome change from brown sugar or maple syrup. Thanks, FarmMom!

Hard to beat the combination of simplicity and flavor in this recipe. I used 50% more squash, 100% more lime juice and got pretty good results. I also used Jamaican jerk-seasoning rather than chili powder. You can take this in a dozen directions and not screw it up.

wow-  really didn't think this would be that great- but it was a perfect flavor to compliment the squash.    i cook the squash in the microwave 'cause it goes faster (pierce a few times with knife & cover with plastic wrap.)  then after it has cooked & cooled a bit i cut in half and removed seeds.    also, used lemon juice instead of lime 'cause that's what i have around & it still was perfect (in my opinion).  can't wait to make again!!!

Wow!  This was great.  I didn't use the zest and it was still SO good.  If you think this an odd combo,  try it anyways!  Guaranteed to win you over!

The lime butter sauce with this great squash was spectacular! I too found 30 minutes not quite enough time. This is a keeper! I will try this butter sauce on other squashes, but the Delicata is my new found favorite!

I had never had Delicata squash before but got some through the CSA I belong to.  The butter mixture is an amazing flavor with this sweet squash!  Thanks!

This was just ... odd.  I know it SOUNDS odd (Lime with squash?) but with so many great reviews I thought it was worth a try.  Sadly, no. The butter I might use for something in the future -- it's interesting -- but it won't be squash.

Delicious! I was looking for a recipe for delicata squash that I'd gotten in my Bountiful Basket, as I've never cooked that kind of squash before, but this would work on any squash. The lime chile butter makes it outstanding and I'll never go back to the brown sugar version again.

I am very pleased with this recipe. It turned out delicious. My children really enjoyed it too.  My son and I had fun making our own chili powder for it.
I stuck to the recipe, just doubled it and I absolutely will be making this again! Thanks for posting this recipe.

I had a delicata sitting on my counter and decided to use it today.  My husband who likes all food sweet wanted a brown sugar, butter adn cinnamon sauce, so I made that for his half and decided to try the lime butter on mine.  It was OUTSTANDING. I really thought I would not like this, but it was so good, I kept wishing my husband hadn't eaten his so I could put the lime butter on his half and devour it.  A really pleasant surprise.

And as I always do the first time, didn't change the recipe at all and it did take 30 minutes to cook.  Perfection.

Great recipe- only disagreement is that baked around 1 hr. Only alteration I made was use 2 T butter which seemed adequate. Easy prep, healthy, unusual but agreeable flavors. Served with salmon (panfried with no seasoning) and let the excess sauce flow from the squash to the fish- which was quite tasty. I'm planning on growing delicata squash in my garden next year based on this recipe!

I grew so many Delicata squash and they are not going to waste with this recipe. My wife and I think they are soooooo, good. I have not changed a thing to the recipe, no change needed. And to the one review about being bland. I think you may have burned out your taste buds by eating too much Cajun food.

Although I like baked squash with butter, I did not care for the lime flavor of this dish. I actually thought the citrus ruined the taste of the squash. After disliking the taste based on the recipe, I tried to repair it with cinnamon and nutmeg and more butter, which would have been a better choice of toppings to begin with.

This is really delicious!  I wasn't sure how I would like this savory version, but delicata is a unique squash.  As an alternative, if you do not have lime juice or chili powder on hand, real lemon juice, butter and a good amount of pepper (and salt to taste if desired), also tastes great.

Wow!  Great flavor combination, you sure don't need anything else - the taste of the squash is sweet enough.  I did use a crock pot as someone mentioned, and toasted the seeds.  Wonderful use of all parts of the squash!  Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic!  My husband who does not like squash, or new flavors in general, told me he actively enjoyed it, and had seconds!   We doubled the chili powder and it was very very good!

This dish was UNBELIEVALBLE!!  Like others I was skeptical about the chili lime butter, but my goodness, it totally makes the dish!  I only cooked one squash but but follwed the rest of the directions to a T.  I plan to spread some of the leftover butter on fresh baked cornbread or some other dish.  YUMMY!  Do yourself a favor....try this recipe!!

This was a great recipe... once I tried the Delicata as indicated, I found that almost every Indian spice I put with it was good as well! This the most versatile squash I have ever had...

Interesting tasting winter squash. Had never tried the "Delicata" before.  The lime-chili-butter gave it a very fresh presentation, and pleasant finish in the mouth.

This was ok. The lime did really compliment the sweetness of the squash. I added extra salt to enhance the flavors, more.

We liked the lime butter (I actually used lemon juice and lime zest) but 30 min wasn't long enough for the squash. It was a bit annoying trying to scoop the buttery squash out at the table, so next time we try this I will scoop and mash it ahead of time and mix the butter into that.

YUM!  I added about twice the lime juice since I LOVE lime juice, but followed the recipe as stated otherwise.  This was so tasty, I spread it on my cornbread that was served with squash - perfect!  I almost liked it even better on the cornbread, though it was great on both.  I will make this again - I plan to clip the recipe to the back of my cornbread recipe for future reference.

I substituted cumin & season salt for the chili powder  because we can't tolerate the heat in chili powder & used a vegan butter replacement.

A great alternative to  sweet squash recipes.  Very easy to make and if you use delicata squash, you have portion control.  Half of a squash is a just right for a single serving.

Very good. BUT, I added 1 T or so of maple syrup. The lime was a little to dominant for my tastes. The Maple syrup toned it down.

The chile-lime butter was a good combo with the sweetness of the delicata squash.  I thought maybe there was too much lime, however.  Next time I would only add half Tb of lime juice to the mixture.

This recipe was my first experience with delicata squash. I didn't like the taste of the delicata itself, but the chili lime butter was excellent. I'll be making this with a different kind of squash next time.

All I can say is that this was just okay. I didn't care for the chile powder mixed with the lime and butter, and I really didn't like the squash, either (no fault of the recipe!).

We loved this chili lime squash.  It was super easy and even my boyfriend who is not a fan of squash found himself scrapping up the last bits and sopping bread in the tasty butter.  Very nice!

What a delicious and easy way to spice up a delicata!  I have to say, I had to improvise a little as I was clear out of lime juice and chili pepper and the stores were closed.  So I used 4 teaspoons lemon juice instead of the lime and replaced the chili pepper with paprika. It was delicious!  Next time I'll try it with the original ingredients, but for me the ease of mixing it up just makes this recipe even better!

I thought this was great! 4 stars rating is only because Hubby didn't like it. I made it with greek yoghurt instead of butter (after realizing we were out of butter when the squash was already in the oven!) which turned out absolutely delicious - and makes for a healthier alternative.

Didn't have limes, so I substituted lemon which worked well! We loved it and will try with lime also.

Found out that what I thought was a summer squash in my CSA box was a delicata squash.  I searched AR and found this recipe.  My husband and I thought it was really good, but my 4yo daughter did not care for it.  I will make this again!

I too was disappointed in this recipe.  It wasn't terrible, it just didn't have the WOW factor to it.  The chili-lime butter was good but with the squash was bland and the 2 together were just an okay combination. Nothing special.  I won't be making this again

This was pretty good. Gave it 5 stars because of the lime chili butter sauce which was suprisingly delicious.  I'm trying to find other things to use that sauce combo on.  Two of the squash only took 30 min to cook but the 3rd one took 40. Would love to taste the baked seeds. I had already disposed of mine before I thought about it.

I liked this, but didn't love the flavors.  My hubby did not care for it.  He said the squash and lime flavors don't go together at all.  Won't be making again.

I was pretty disappointed with this based on the stellar reviews it was getting. I veganized this by substituting margarine for butter which might have thrown things off a bit. I had to really mash it up with the squash to get it to taste decent. Surprisingly enough, adding some brown sugar to the mix greatly improved things; I'd recommend doing this if you try it and find it not to your liking.

We loved this tangier twist on squash and that it was a real side dish, not a main dish for vegetarians or too hearty.  Needed to use yet another delicata from our CSA bag and this disappeared in record time.  I baked it for 15 minutes then realized I needed to use the broiler so I finished by microwaving it about 7 minutes more.  I think I'd skip the baking and just zap it next time.

This was delicious.  I didn't use as much chili powder since the kids don't like very spicey foods.  Even hubby had seconds & he's not usually interested in squash.

This was delicious - but my kids thought the lime was a little "soury" - I enjoyed it thoroughly.

A huge hit!  My boyfriend devoured his half and said the "sauce" was delicious.  Will definitely make again. Thanks, Farmmom!
