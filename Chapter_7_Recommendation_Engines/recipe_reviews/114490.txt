These cookies turned out perfect, just as good as they'd look in a picture. I did make a small change: I don't have Splenda on hand, so I put 1/2 a cup of white sugar, and 3/4 cup brown sugar. The official conversion would be 1 cup of each sugars, but I didn't want to mess up the texture, and I usually cut down the sugar in recipes anyway. Turned out perfect =)

These cookies are wonderful peanut butter cookies. My husband and son just love them. I couldn't keep them out of them while I was baking them. Can't even tell that they are made from splenda. Thank you for the these wonderful cookies. If I could give them more stars I would. :) :) :)

Love it!!!
I followed this recipe exactly, but didn't use splenda for I didn't have any. Alternated with sugar and it was great. 
I threw away another peanut Butter chocolate chip cookie recipe I kept for a long time. This one is much much better.

Great cookies! I used margarine and reduced-fat peanut butter. It tastes good. The cookies were flat but retains its circular shape. (Maybe I need to experiment with butter and regular peanut butter?) My sons loved it, so does my diabetic husband!

This recipe is delicious. I made a few changes to the recipe to use what i had on hand. I used sugar and brown sugar in place of splenda (3/4 cup each), i also added reeses pieces instead of peanut butter chips. I added a bit more peanut butter and more flour to make up for it, and for a bit of a twist i added about a tbsp on nutella into the batter. They turned out wonderful!

This is a very good recipe and I will be making it again. Since I didn't have Splenda on hand, I used Galeriel's measurements for white and brown sugar and they turned out great. I didn't put in the chocolate chips. My husband thought they could use a bit more peanut flavor, so I am thinking about adding some chopped roasted peanuts next time (perhaps substitute it for the chocolate chips, though 1 cup may be enough). I'd also like to try the original version for my parents. Thank you for the yummy recipe and helpful comments :).

Didn't use Splenda, and left out the chocolate chips (my boyfriend hates chocolate-he's wierd, I know). Instead, I used regular peanut butter chips and these were excellent!

I have used this recipe for several years and it is so indulgent! I have found that if you use old fashioned peanut butter (I prefer Smucker's), it makes it even better!

This was delicious!  I made the batch as instructed and the were moist and delectable!  I froze 3/4 of them and they have held up nicely.  Each cookie is 3 points, and if you add it with a 1/2 cup of Breyer's Double Churned light vanilla, it is only 5 points:)

Will make again!

Too sweet. Maybe better with granular Splenda rather than Splenda Blend.

These cookies are great I actually use 1 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 a cup of margarine to decrease the saturated fat and they came out GREAT, wonderful texture and taste. 10 minutes was the perfect baking time for slightly crisp edges and chewy centers

I just finished making my first batch and they are delicious!! My son didn't even know they were sugar free. I didn't use all the chocolate chips, I just pushed 3 chips into each cookie. I am still looking for a sugar free chocolate to use for chips.
