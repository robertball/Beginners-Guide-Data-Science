the flavors were okay but i had a difficult time getting the cheese to melt and mix with the cream. I may try it again though.

Love this and make it often!  It's the closest I've found to what we get at some Mexican restaurants. I don't use a double boiler -- just melt the cheese in a sauce pan VERY slowly on low, and stir occasionally.  I add a small amount of cream cheese along with the pepperjack, and since we love the taste of cumin, I add that at the end.  Also, I use 2 percent milk instead of half and half (less amount). I have never had trouble mixing the cheese and milk (as others have stated). The only problem I ever had was when I made it a day ahead, refrigerated it, then micro-waved it -- the milk separated from the cheese and was a big lump.

I prepared this dip for my women's Bunco group of twelve.  Many thought it was an excellant dip.  I did not have a double boiler so prepared it in the microwave on a low power setting and kept it warm in my fondue pot during the Bunco game.

This dip was very good and has lots of potential to be great.  More tomatoes and more spice are needed...

Like Annie, I had difficulty getting the half and half and the cheese to mix. I think perhaps you need to combine it and whisk and serve *right away*, or perhaps at a very high temperature, although it was already difficult to clean my double boiler and that might make it worse. Even as a cheese blob, though, my dad loved it, and I found the flavour even more pleasing on the second day.

The recipe sounded great, and the flavours were wonderful, but I guess I should have read the reviews first. I also had a tough time mixing the cream with the cheese. It turned out to be a big blob of cheese with veggies in it with a puddle of cream at the bottom. I ended up draining out the cream, and stuffing it in pasta shells with some ground sausage and ricotta cheese. It was very tasty.

The flavors are spicy and awesome. I cooked mine in a crock pot-just threw everything in and let it melt. I was able to mix the cream and cheese together, BUT the dip did separate when it cooled off, and reheating it in a microwave was do-able, but a little difficult if you have a microwave without power settings. Overall a quick and delish dip.

I loved this recipe. I made it for a pot luck type of wedding shower and it was a big hit. Not a dip left over. I served it with cold pita bites.

This dip is very tasty but it was very runny until it cooled and the cheese began to harden. Most of the spinach sank to the bottom so I had to keep a spoon in the bowl and keep stirring it up. I didn't have any tomato but it was still good without it. I would make it again with much less cream.

The flavor was good, but that was the only good thing about this dish. The cream doesn't make any sense in this recipe as it just splashes and burns you while you attempt to combine the ingredients. This MUST be served on a hot plate or in a fondue as it is not easy to eat unless it remains the temperature of magma.

Super-yummy! I used low fat sour cream instead of half-and-half and cooked the cheese over a really low heat without a double-boiler. Finished it off by putting half of it in an oven crock and baked it at 400 for five minutes, then broiled it until it was nice and browned on top. Served with blue corn tortilla chips and toasted french bread!
