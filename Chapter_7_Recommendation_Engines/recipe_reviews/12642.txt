All in all, this is an old, classic Shaker recipe... perhaps an acquired taste (given the texture/consistency), but most definitely an excellent pie. You may want to try using 3 lemons, and slice them paper-thin using a mandoline (rather than attempting to slice with a knife). Can adjust the thickness down with the mandoline. If the lemons are sliced too thick, there's a bitter aftertaste associated with the lemon rind; if sliced thinly enough, the taste is perfectly tart...and a nice balance with the sweetness of the sugar. Also, try adding a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients. Also, MUCH, MUCH better by leaving the sliced lemons/sugar mixture to marinate overnight (stirring occasionally)...rather than just a couple of hours; greatly improves the flavor. Brush the top of the pie crust with a bit of beaten egg...will make the crust more golden-colored.

My mother has this recipe in a huge, weathered leatherbound cookbook that's been in our family for generations.  She once served it at a dinner party she hosted; a week later she received a package in the mail, containing a solid silver pie server, and a note which read: "For the best lemon pie I've ever had!"  It was from a guest whom she barely knew.  Our version is a little different; it uses three lemons which must be peeled and the whites removed.   It is slightly more laborious, but it doesn't have to sit overnight; one can simply mix the ingredients and pop it in the oven!

This pie was super easy to make and tasted wonderful. I think next time I will use only the zest and juice from 3 or 4 lemons, I was not crazy about the lemon chuncks.  Also I will use a 9 in deep dish pie crust, the regular crust was too small and I could not use all the mixture.

I used 3 lemons (as suggested in a very similar recipe on this site) very finely sliced, finely shredded the zest and used half of a lemon's worth in the actual recipe, I used shortcrust pastry sheets store-bought and I let my lemon/sugar mixture sit o/night in the fridge.

I love lemon but I would suggest to go with 2 smallish lemons or perhaps 1 large one (all of mine were much larger than tennis balls..). I didnt mind the texture like this - but I could still see it would be better if you put your mixture in the blender before you make your pie in my opinion.

Using 3 large lemons this was extremely tangy, but would be lovely if you put a couple of scoops of vanilla ice-cream with it when you serve it.

I have made the shaker lemon pie many times for my children when they were growing up. They thought it was greatest because of the rind. It is tender, chewy, and delicious. It is a change from the pudding type lemon pie. Thank you for having it listed.

MANY YEARS AGO THIS WAS MY DAD'S FAVORIE PIE.  AFTER HE PASSED AWAY I QUIT MAKING IT.  AS THANKSGIVING WAS JUST A FEW DAY AWAY I STARTED TO THINK OF WHAT PIES I WAS GOING TO MAKE.  THEN I FOUND THE RECIPE UNDER LEMON PIES. I MADE IT AND IT WAS WONDERFUL. BROUGHT BACK OLD MEMORIES. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.  THERE ISN'T ANOTHER LEMON PIE WITH THIS MUCH LEMON TASTE. THANKS FOR SUBMITTING IT.  GRANNYROB

The lemon rind presents a bit of a texture issue with this recipe.  I really love lemon so for me it was not a problem.  But for others who are not as enamoured with lemon, this is probably not the best lemon pie recipe.

fantastic! this is my dad's favorite, and tastes just like the "real thing" (that i hated when i was little(r)). its very simple to make, too. i think i usually use 3 lemons, and a little less sugar b/c we like it more tart...slicing wasn't impossible, but i bought a mandoline for the slicing soon after my first one :-)

Really different and tasty! The texture could be a problem with some people as it was in my house-some liked it and some didn't. I plan on trying this by blending the whole thing up until smooth just before I bake it. The flavor is awesome!

This pie had a texture issue with me as well. It has a wonderful lemon taste, but I think next time I may shred the lemon peel(zest)and then slice the lemons.

I recently discovered this pie and LOVE It, but I feel this recipe needs a little tweaking/clarification. The lemons do need to be see-through Paper Thin or the texture will be chunky and the taste too bitter. I usually let them macerate in the sugar for a full 24 hours on the counter, at this point the pith turns almost clear, instead of an opaque white. Also I stir in 1-3 T (depending on how juicy the lemons are) of flour into the mixture before baking to help it from being so runny. It's not a lemon pie for the faint of heart, it's actually reminiscent of a very tart lemon marmalade in a pie crust, but for those who love citrus...Oooh is it wonderful!

This pie had a texture issue with me as well. It has a nice lemon taste, except for the bitter taste from the rind.  I may not have sliced the lemon thin enough.  The recipe should probably say paper thin slices of lemon.

I just learned from cooks country show on tv to have success with the recipe that you should: slice lemons very very thin using a serrated knife; after removing pits, squeeze out and save lemon juice before putting/cooking lemons in water for 5 mins (this eliminates the need to let stand 4 hours/overnight). It will also improve texture. Put juice with 2 tbsp cornstarch,  the sugar. and eggs Hope this helps!

I've tried every pie pastry crust recipe w/o success.  This was NO exception.  Loose, messy and nearly impossible to transfer to plate.It looks just like all my failures.  I even have a marble rolling pin...no help there.  I gave it 2 star rating only because it tasted good in my Shaker Lemon pie.  Thank Gof for Marie Callender's ready made crusts!

I like the taste, but not the consistancy. (sp?)  Like other reviewers said, I will use the pulp and zest only. It was too bitter for me. My lemons weren't paper thin, so I ended up blending the lemons along with the eggs. Much to my surprise, my husband loved it. Good for him, he'll be eating the rest of it.

I did the Martha Stewart version of this and it was perfect. The difference was 4 lemons and 6 eggs. It's important to slice the lemons very thin and make sure that the seeds are removed. Any of the tough veins in the lemon should also be removed. It is a very good pie.

I thought this pie was a bit too sweet when made using the exact recipe.  Also would have preferred it a bit more tart.  

My husband did not care for the texture and neither did I.  If I made this again, it would definitely require a food processor.

I rated it 5 stars, not based on my love for the recipe, but because the recipe is what it is...a Shaker Lemon Pie!  It may not be my favorite lemon pie, but there is nothing wrong with the recipe, it is supposed to taste like this.  I changed it a tad, I used 3 lemons and added 1/3 cup of sugar and used 5 eggs.  I wanted a thick pie, I don't like thin fillings.   After 24 hrs (no way would I bake this pie after it sitting only 4 hrs) I ran it through the blender to reduce the size of the pieces.

I loved it!! If you love lemons you'll love this pie.  I did add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch because there was just so much juice. It turned out perfectly.  Gotta have ice cream or whipped cream with it.

I used less sugar, just stopped adding it when it tasted right. I also turned it into mini pies in a muffin tin! Turned out super yummy. I baked for 15 minutes at 450, then decreased the temperature as instructed, added foil over the top, and baked another 15 minutes. They baked up perfectly as minis!

I did not care for this pie at all.  Guess it is the texture I don't like.  Will not make again.   Made this as written except with store brought crust brushed with egg white.  Crust was good.

I did everything according to the directions except, as some readers suggested, I used three lemons instead of two. I let the lemons and sugar stand for a full 24 hours as many readers suggested.  The result was quite literally inedible.  Even though I had sliced the lemons very thin in a food processor, and even though I had let them sit in the sugar for 24 hours, the peels still were very bitter and ruined the taste.  Huge disappointment.

I found this very bitter the lemons must be sliced with some sort of slicing maching it is nearly imposible to get the right thickness just using a knife. When left over night the lemons became very watery and did evaporate after the pie was baked.

I used 1 more lemon and added lemon zest and a bit of lemon juice to the filling.  And, let it marinate in fridge overnight.  Amazing.  Everyone who ate it loved it.

I used three lemons but otherwise followed the recipe.  We found the pie too sweet, so next time I will use only one and half cups of sugar instead of two cups.  I brushed the top crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking.  My family loved the intense lemon flavor.

Fifteen or so minutes after it came out of the oven it was cool enough to eat but still warm so I decided to cut it, and as soon as I took a slice out the egg, juice, and syrup mixture flooded out. At least it tasted good.

I chose this recipe after finding a way-too-vague version elsewhere, and I'm certainly glad I kept looking. 
I used the recipe as-is, and personally, I think it turned out great. It takes a few bites to get used to the presence of the rind, etc., but the flavor that is in that rind is so perfectly tart that you want to get used to it. 
I see a lot of reviews that mention using three lemons but I'm not sure about that for myself. The balance of sweet and sour is pretty right on with two lemons and two cups of sugar. 
I  do agree that a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream is great with this.

It was awesome... I increased the eggs by one. And next time, I think I'll take the time to remove some of the peel

I love this pie!  Just like the one we had at Shakertown (Pleasant Hill) in Kentucky!  I made it with lemons from my own little tree and eggs from my chicken.

The recipe is great, but including the pith makes this pie quite tart. I enjoyed it though. I think I'd like to try making it with cuties instead of lemons.
