I made this as an appetizer at Thanksgiving.  I used 1 cup black olives & 1 cup green olives.  Used Alouette Garlic & Herb.  Made it up the night before so the flavors would have a chance to meld.  Then served in endives the next day.  Was delish! Everyone loved them and couldn't get enough.

Thought it was a bit too salty.  But very easy to whip up.

I found these to be easy and fast to prepare.  I would suggest utilizing this recipe in instances where you are preparing multiple appetizers at once for a party or dinner, as these are not labor intensive.  I found the tastes to be a bit overwhelming for me, but fans of green olives, really raved about the taste.  Perhaps some grated asiago cheese might add some sharpness to cut back on salt?  I brushed bread with olive oil to help brown.  Very fast, easy and well recieved.
