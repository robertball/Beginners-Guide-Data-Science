I think something is missing from this recipe, or maybe just some extra advice is needed. I tried it twice and both came out badly. The first looked set when I removed it but was drippy in the middle when served. The second was left in longer and even after my husband (who makes superb pecan pies) determined it "set" did the same. I was really dissappointed with this and it was a letdown at Thanksgiving when I tried to match the one my Opa used to make.
