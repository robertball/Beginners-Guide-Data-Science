I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I have never made it exactly as it is written but the idea is great. When I first found the recipe I went to the grocery and just selected vegetables to use. I have made it several times using napa cabbage zucchini yellow squash carrots corn and peas. If I could give it more stars I would.

I only believe in rating a recipe if I followed the recipe exactly. I Tried this 3 different ways. 1st- as written: Loved it! 2nd- added more veggies and chopped garlic to make it heartier: loved it! 3rd- same as second added ground turkey that I cooked up first: loved it! This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I recommend sweating the carrots and celery with some onion in the pan with a tiny bit of olive oil first to make them more tender but even slightly crunchy they were excellent.

At first I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't crazy about this soup. The salsa didn't seem to go with any of the vegetables I'd added. The next day I added a can of corn and a can of black beans and garnished with a dollop of fat free sour cream and it was okay especially for a low cal soup. It's never going to be my favorite but I'd probably make it again with the same modifications and maybe cutting back on the carrots and celery some.

Wow! This soup is amazing! You can really use ANY vegetables in this soup. What a tasty idea to use salsa as the major flavor. I really like this soup and will be making this as regularly as I make my other favorite soups. My only mistake was I used hot salsa and made it a little hotter than I can handle. Great recipe!

Easiest soup I've ever made and it's soo good. I love that it's basically broth salsa and whatever veggies you have on hand or want to use up because you can always keep salsa and broth in your pantry. It's incredibly healthy too. Awesome recipe!

Yummmmmm. I changed this recipe a lot but followed the spirit of it--you can really add/omit anything you want to that tasty broth. I added red beans and rice to make it more filling omitted celery and carrots and added onions and zucchini. I love Mexican inspired soups and this hit the spot on a cold rainy day. Still only 140 calories per serving even with my additions. Downside--a TON of sodium. Try low-sodium chicken broth and (if such a thing exists) no salt added salsa.

This is a great easy soup. One change I'll make in the future however is to add more "stuff" to the soup. There wasn't enough vegetables to broth ratio. I had also added chicken to it. I made my own broth and salsa.

This was pretty good. I used what vegetables I had on hand and added in some others that needed to be used up. I added a little extra salsa towards the end of the cooking time.

It's a good base to work with but it can be done with cheaper ingredients. Still a fast way to whip up a good base for the freezer.

My first pass at this was too chicken-y for me--but that's probably because I used homemade chicken stock with a ton of flavor. Next time I'll try it without the stock.

This was the best soup I ever had. It took a little time but worth it. I added a little onion and it was great.5 Stars.

Nice idea. I thought it was good with "extras" like hot sauce and tortilla chips. My husband did not like eating "warm salsa"

Good basic vegetable soup. Just no WOW factor. I had to add sauted chopped onion and garlic before adding all the other ingredients. Also threw in some cubed leftover grilled chicken and some pre-cooked soup beans. I think you would have to really modify this a lot for it to be 5 stars.

I had a lorge bag of frozen mixed veggies I wanted to use and did a search to find suitable recipes. This recipe exactly served my purpose - it was easy and tasty as well. As my bag was big I did not use the fresh carrots or celery - no matter the soup tasted fresh. I sauteed onion and garlic first added a handful of noodles to make the soup a little more substantial and added seasoned salt & a little Italian seasoning. All the family enjoyed it. I would have liked it a little spicier but used a mild chunky salsa to suit my husband's preference. I'm sure we will have this again with sandwiches or salad this winter for a nice light lunch.

This is probably the easiest soups I've ever made. A couple of things to note. While I prefer fresh carrots over frozen, most all frozen veggie blends have carrots in them so I chose to save myself a step and leave out the fresh carrots. Because of that, I ended up tripling the frozen veggies. Even if you chose to use the fresh carrots, the frozen veggies still need doubled or you'll end up with a very thin soup. I really liked the flavor the salsa brought but I do think the soup itself could have used more. I will leave out the fresh carrots again next time and replace them with a can of drained and rinsed black beans for a Southwest feel and also to add protein. It really doesn't get any easier than this one.

This soup was absolutely delicious! Added & onion with hot salsa instead of mild. It gave it a little extra flavor & kick. Will be making again this weekend!
