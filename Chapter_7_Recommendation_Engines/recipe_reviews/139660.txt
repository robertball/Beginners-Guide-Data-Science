I was a bit hesitant to try this smoothie after seeing the other review, but actually think it's quite tasty and refreshing.  I did not make it exactly as the recipe, however,  I did not use the sweetened condensed milk because I do not care for the taste unless it's in a baked product, nor did I use the cream cheese.  I used Del Monte SunFresh papaya (jarred), whole milk, plain yogurt, vanilla extract, lime juice and honey.  I would make this smoothie again with my changes.  Thank you for the new idea for using papaya!

I have been looking for a smoothie recipe to use my papaya in and this is my favorite.  I love this.  I had to make 2 changes because I didn't have condensed milk or vanilla yogurt.  I used plain yogurt instead and used 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup whipping cream.
