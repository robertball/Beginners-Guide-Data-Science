It was a little plain with just the natural vanilla ice cream that I used, so I tossed in a few strawberries and it was the best! I'm definately gonna use this again with some other fruit! Maybe bananas...lol

This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I make this "lighter" now using vanilla frozen yogurt and lowfat milk. I do cut the milk back just a touch to make it a little thicker.

This was too liquid-y for some, so I added extra ice-cream to compensate (and hide the vanilla extract taste)

I grew up with my Mom making milkshakes just with milk and ice cream. When I got married and my husband added a shot of vanilla to the blender, I wondered why didn't I ever think of that? We usually just add the milk "till it's right" rather than measuring.

Wow, does this bring back memories! Classic recipe - smooth, rich, and creamy! It only takes a couple ingredients for a really quick and easy treat. I did make mine a little thicker by using less milk. I topped this off with a little whipped cream and a cherry - YUM!

The recipe was a little too juicy for my taste.  Next time I will either cut back on the milk or add more ice cream.

I halved the recipe because I was only making it for me. I mixed it for a long time, but it never thickened like a milkshake is supposed to..the taste was good, but the consistency of a milkshake was not present. I don't know how long you are supposed to mix it, but I did it for almost 5 minutes,and it didn't change the thickness.

This is a great recipe!  For those of you who thought it was to thin or soupy, just blend it for a longer period of time.  The longer it blends the thicker it gets.

This was a good old fashioned basic vanilla milkshake.  I did add more ice cream for thickness and only had 1% milk.  I also got silly and added in a few tbsp of sugar to sweetened it up a littke bit.  Is there such thing as a healthy milkshake..I think not so why not make it good and fattening...HEHE!  DELICIOUS!

This is  a wonderful recipe! I used Vanilla Bean ice cream and cut back to 1/2 cup of milk. Also added 1/2/ a sliced banana. This is a keeper! Thanks for such a easy versatile recipe!

My hubby and 4 year  old loved this milkshake! Since we don't drink whole milk I used soy milk and soy ice cream. I also added a dash of cinnamon! This is definitely a keeper.

This was pretty good. Adding the vanilla extract did make it taste more like what I know as a vanilla milkshake than just adding milk. I had a good amount of vanilla ice-cream and found this to use it up. This is easy to make, but would probably be even easier using softened vanilla ice cream and a hand-emulsion blender. I am not a big milkshake drinker, so I will probably not make again. But, if you enjoy milkshakes you will like this. Just don't leave out the vanilla!

So good. There's not much to it, but the addition of the vanilla extract makes a perfect milk shake.

Very Good! I used 1/2 cup of 2% milk and 3 cups of French Vanilla ice cream; added sliced and chilled strawberries that I'd sweetened with Splenda, and 1 sliced banana.  This made enough for 2 tall serving glasses. Great drink on a hot day!

Good base recipe.  I thought it was too thin, so I added a heaping tablespoon of instant vanilla pudding mix to it and blended it in.  It helped.  Next batch, I will add it to the milk and blend it first, let it rest a couple of minutes then add the ice cream and blend again.

Great base recipe for shakes! We used this ratio at a milkshake and float night. We served Oreo milkshakes and banana cream pie shakes (add a chunk or slice of banana cream pie). YUM!

I was looking for something quick, simple and great tasting. Thumbs up the whole way around. Everyone loved it!!! Great tasting. One thing was the thickness, I just added a little less milk, thats it. My son used chocolate syrup and made a chocolate shake!! For the most part, GREAT SHAKE!! Thank you alot for the recipe!!

I have used this recipe before, but this time I changed it. Right now I cannot have anything that I cannot get through a straw. Getting nutrients is tough. I used 1/2 fat, 1/2 cal., 1/2 carb vanilla ice cream, a vanilla protein shake instead of milk, vanilla, and added peanut butter. GREAT! A yummy peanut butter shake with nutritional value. Next time I may add chocolate syrup.

I added a banana and 2 scoops of protein powder to get some much needed nutrition into my hubby.  I dipped my finger into it to taste, and it was delish!  I can't believe it was so simple and tasty.

This told me exactly what I needed to know to start experimenting.  I added mixed berries, and will try replacing the milk with grape juice for a grape shake next time.  Good summer treat.

I wanted to start a weekend tradition for my five 905) year old granddaughter Emma and I so I began w/a basic milkshake. She wanted strawberry, and i used the above recipe. as we sampled it along the way, it seemed to runny and just not thick enough. I added a couple more cups of vanilla ice cream, and used Nestle's strawberry syrup flavoring. the end result was a very happy and smiling little face, and I felt good too! It took me back to when I was able to cook and bake w/my grandparent's as a child, and now I plan on doing a lot more of these things w/my Emma! Thank you for all the recipes on your website, and our next adventure shall hopefully be a peach cobbler.

This is a good milkshake "fix". I did double it so it didn't blend as well. I also added a dash of cinnamon. Yummy flavor! Not quite Mickey D's thick but it's got a pretty good flavor!

I grew up in the country and we didn't have any money for ice cream or a milkshake. So we had homemade ice cream in the freezer. we soon learned to add milk and other homegrown ingredients to this recipe to have the best recipe in town. This is just the way we made ours. My kids, grandkids, and great grandkids all lookforward to homemade ice cream milkshakes at mawmaw's house. Adding a little of your favorite jelly in is great tasting also. Just add to your taste. Experiment! Its great!

Thick or thin, fruit or not, if you add some sugar it will taste like you bought it from an old fashioned soda jerk.

GREAT SHAKE! Used natural vanilla home style ice cream (fat!) and 2% milk and tasted also great. Thank you for the recipe!

This was good, but nothing different, other than a slight more vanilla kick.  I didn't think it was too liquidy as others have said, but I'm also careful about not over-blending.

We didn't have Ice cream by itself, so instead, we used Ice cream cake, but it would be better if you add a cup of ice as well.

I made this the first time with Silk brand Coconut Milk and Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream. I went easy on the Vanilla.

The second time I went with vanilla ice cream, Silk Coconut milk and Orange extract. It was almost like an Orange creamsicle milkshake.

Delicious! Obviously a milkshake you can add what you like but the base of this recipe was delicious. I’ve never put vanilla extract in mine and that’s what made the difference! My youngest is lactose so I made with Breyers lactose ice cream with his lactose milk and added choc and caramel syrup. It came out wonderful! As my oldest would say “two thumbs up!”

This is a great recipe!! I loved it! However I fixed the measurements to make 2 shakes instead of 4 and it ended up only making 1. I loved it because it was plain and simple yet so good.

My kids loved this. What’s not to like about ice cream:) To make it thicker use less milk. I sprinkled crushed graham crackers on top and added a dolp of homemade whip. Very good!

I thought the proportion of milk and ice cream was just right--if you like a really thick shake, cut back on the milk. My daughter wanted a pink milkshake, but I didn't have strawberries. I used strawberry milk and added a drop of red food coloring. Whipped cream, sprinkles and a cherry on top made it perfect for Valentine's Day.

Made this for family and they said it was the best vanilla shake they'd ever had and much better than fast food shakes ! 
I did use more than 2 cups of ice cream to get the thickness just right for our taste. I used Breyers Natural Vanilla Ice Cream and since I didn't have whole milk on hand I mixed 3/4 cup of one percent milk with one quarter cup of half and half. I got requests to make again the next day so will make this again and again and add some flavors such as chocolate ,fruit flavor etc.

Thought it was ok, but it was not the normal thick consistency of a milkshake. Tasted great, though I think the vanilla was strong.

This is a great basic milkshake recipe. The ratio of 2 to 1 ice cream and milk is how it's done and can always be tweaked to suit your tastes. Add in whatever you like and enjoy!

I was babysitting and I thought a really good idea was to make smoothies but we didn't have any fruit. Soo I decided to make this kind of milkshake and to be honest I probably would never make this recipe of milkshakes again cause it tasted more like milk and vanilla then anything else. Alot of liquid, like me solids. There is some bits of flavor  but not a lot.

Pretty good, but could've been better. Maybe the mistake I made was using 2% milk instead of whole, but I didn't have that

Great milkshake! I made this for my mother who needs to consume more calories. In place of the milk, I used an 8-oz bottle of Very Vanilla Boost supplement drink. Would be very good for seniors in that regard. I also added a bit of vanilla protein powder. Thanks for the recipe, DPULLIAM!

Easy. I cut it in half and put 1/4 tsp mint extract and some chocolate chips and made it a mint chocolate chip milkshake. I think it tastes better with my homemade vanilla ice cream!

Great, simple recipe. I ended up using a little less ice cream & milk and added some chocolate chips but it was delicious.
