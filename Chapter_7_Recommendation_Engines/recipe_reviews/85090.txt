Great base recipe! I added 1/4 chopped apple, a 1/8 tsp each of allspice and nutmeg. I did the vegetables on the stovetop, with 3/4 cup chicken broth. When the vegetables were tender, I drained and covered them, reserving the cooking liquid. Then reduced the liquid by boiling to 1/4 cup, pouring over the vegetables at serving time. We all loved it, even my husband who professes to dislike parsnips.

Easy to make; beautiful presentation.  Delicious!  I served with a spicy chicken dish and the sweetness of the vegetables was a good compliment.  Used Smart Balance margarine instead of butter or margarine.  No problem.

Oh man! I've never eaten parsnips before. This was sooooooooo good. I only had half the amount of parsnips and carrots called for, but I didn't decrease the sauce by much. It was fantastic.

I used fresh thyme instead of rosemary, I  blanched the vegetables first, then drained it well because my kids like  softer vegetables and everyone really enjoyed the dish.  I even at the leftovers for lunch by itself.  It would go really well with ham.

Very easy & tasty. Used regular dried rosemary and crushed it.  Made on the shelf under the pork roast 325F oven cooked same time as roast but checked every 30minutes to turn and make sure did not dry out.

The flavour was good with this, but the veggies were a little dry coming out of the oven.  Overall, I'd make it again.

This was so good! I made extra butter and smeared it over grilled chicken. Thank you!

Oh yum!  These were SOOO good!  We only recently started eating parsnips and we love them, so I'm on the hunt for new recipes and this is a really good one.  I did make one small change and that was to use homeade peach jam in place of the apricot jam.  The only reason this recipe did not receive 5 stars (and I don't hand out 5 stars easily!), is that we felt the cooking time may have been a bit long.  Next time I make them, I will reduce the cooking time by 5 or 10 minutes.

Glaze was really good - but we thought the parsnips tasted a little odd. I cut the carrots in 1" strips and cut them in half, and they came out just right.

these are delicious. really unique taste.  only change would be to cut smaller pieces or bake longer - the middle was still very crisp, i prefer a softer texture.
