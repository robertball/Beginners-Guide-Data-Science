The first time I made this the filling was sour.  So, I changed the filling to an 8oz. cream cheese, cut the lemon juice to a teaspoon and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I have had many, many requests for this recipe.

Goes to show, everyone has different tastes.  Made this as directed and the family didn't care for it.  Said the cream cheese filling was too sour due to the lemon juice.  Tasted like sour cream globbed in the center.  So, I made another one and omitted the lemon juice.  Added 1 tsp of vanilla instead.  Much better!  Modified...it was a hit.  The cake portion was perfect with the filling and topping.

Very Good!  Very moist, flavorful, and hard to stop picking at.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt pan with the streusel layer on top of the cream cheese layer.  I also added cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the batter.  There was too much batter and filling for one bundt pan when doubling, so I made a second cake using a round cakepan and gave it to the neighbors (who loved it).  Will make again--would be great for company.

As of right now this cake has left the building in my families stomachs.  It was awsome.  the texture was great and it was also moist.  I followed everyones suggestion and used 8 oz of cream cheese and it was actually perfect.  Also I used juice from a freshly cut orange instead of lemon juice and the filling tasted even sweeter.  It was definitely better than expected.

Received compliments from people who normally don't hand them out. Delicious, I doubled the filling and put the nut mixture on the bottom of the bundt pan.

I loved this recipe! I'm not a sweet eater. Neither is my dad. When my dad tried it he said it was the cake for him. :) I do kinda agree the filling was a little sour. But I just don't add as much lemon juice.

I reduced the lemon to 1 teaspoon and made 12 large muffins. A little hard to get out of the muffin tin because of the soft middle, but very tasty. Went quick.

This is a nice average coffee cake.  I agree with other reviews that the cream cheese layer was a little more tart that we would have preferred so if I were to make it again I would add additional confectionersâ€™ sugar.

I loved this and got lots of positive feedback! I used 1 8oz package of cream cheese and added dried cranberries to the batter. It was amazing! I'll be making this over and over.

Very good and quick recipe.  Since I don't like lemon, I used 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring in the cream cheese and made an almond glaze to go on top.  I must say that my cake did not rise like the picture.  Maybe baking powder was old but the final product was worthy of a repeat effort.

This was unfortunately disappointing... :( I hate leaving bad reviews, but the cream cheese part of it was just not very good. I followed the recipe down to the T then I added extra vanilla and sugar, in hopes it would be better , but it still didn't help.

Per reviewers' suggestions, I eliminated the lemon altogether.  I used an 8 oz brick of cream cheese with about 5 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I placed the strudel on top of the cream cheese layer and came out with a very tasty cream cheese filled cake.  It is somewhat dense and not overly sweet.  The cream cheese filling stays very creamy even hours after the cake has cooled.  Nice surprise for your tastebuds!

Tasty cake, took a little bit longer to cook.  Like several reviews stated, filling is too tart.  I like tart, but definitely needs more sugar, less lemon or both...  Give it a try though.

I have made this cake twice and must say it is delicious. I used 8 oz creme cheese, 1/4 cup sugar 1 egg dash of lemon juice and  1 table spoon flour for the filling. I tinted my filling pink. Very pretty to.

I love this recipe !!   I like alot of filling so I doubled it.(using 16 oz of cream cheese,and 3 tbls lemon juice,6 tbls conf. sugar) And I had the nuts on the bottom of the pan.   I don't like really sweet cakes,and this was perfect for me. If you like really sweet fillings, add more sugar.

I thought this was just ok.  Nothing real special.  It appealed to me at first, but when I ate it I am not sure I like the cream cheese layer.  I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.

YUMMY!!! I did, however, make a couple changes.  For the filling, I used a full 8 oz brick of Neufchatel - mixed up with vanilla, 2 big globbers of butter, and kept pouring in the powdered sugar until it reached my preferred sweetness.  Added a big of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  And, omitted the nuts - but kept the cinnamon sugar (even dusted the pan with cinnamon sugar, instead of flour).  **Make sure you do not spread filling all the way to the edges, it does seep out if you go all the way!**  Next time I make this - and it will be made again - I will add a bit of oil to the batter as well.

The cream cheese was sour and the consistancy was very unappealing.  I won't make it again.

Yummy!  Very moist and delicious.  I thought there was a little too much cream cheese mixture when prepared as stated.  Next time, I will try to marble the cream cheese into the cake.  All in all it was great!

Great! Moist. The cream cheese adds cake like taste. I used full 8oz pack of cheese and reduced Lemon juice to 1 tbsp. I think I would add more lemon juice or zest and some raisins next time...

Deeeeelicious.... I made the cake in two 8x8 pans and it turned out fantastic. Next time I want to add just a bit more lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture to kick it up a bit. Otherwise it is a wonderful recipe that I will make again in the future.

I made this yesterday and my husband and I tried it this morning.  I thought it was delicious, he said next time double the filling.  I kinda agree with him, but this recipe was very good.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

Very good! I used 2 clementines in place of lemon juice in both the batter and the topping. Also, I halfed the recipe when I did this. I was delicious - an orange cream cheese coffee cake. Definitely make again. Also, had to use peanuts for the topping - all I had, plus don't like walnuts too much.

I've made this cake several times and it's delightful.  Moist & flavorful and a breeze to make.  I use a 250g pkg of cream cheese and I omit the walnut topping simply because my family isn't crazy for walnuts.  I also sprinkle a light dusting of icing sugar over the cake JUST before serving.  Thanks for sharing!

This cake was disgusting. I am a seasoned baker and followed all directions to the letter. The cake was  dry and tasteless and the filling was sour and unappealing.

Very easy to prepare and delicious. I used fat free cream cheese, fat free sour cream, Egg Beaters and apple sauce in place of the butter. I did not put the struesel topping on the bottom of the cake. Instead I saved it until after the cake was done baking. When cooled, I drizzled on some plain white icing and then topped it with the struesel. My whole family loved it.

This was better cold as  my family didn't like the cream cheese soft and gooey. Also I used a tube pan and poured the topping in the bottom after the pan was greased. When the cake was turned out the sugar and nuts formed  a yummy  crunchy crust.

The only change I made to this recipe was I omitted the lemon and used vanilla extract instead.  It was excellent! My only "mistake" was that I baked it in a bundt pan, so when I inverted it onto the serving platter, the crumb topping became a nice bottom crust instead!!    To make it look pretty, I drizzled a confectioners sugar glaze over the top. YUMMY!

I doubled the filling and was glad I did. I liked it better chilled than I did when it was warm , and found it quite tasty, although I was a bit disapointed in the texture of the batter.

I made 12 jumbo muffins out of this recipe instead of one cake.  Turned out soooo moist and flavorful.  The pocket of cream cheese is a nice suprise.  I also added 2 bananas and extra cinnamon to the batter.

I made a smaller version and tried lemon icing and strawberry pie filling as a topping. Both were good. I used sour cream but I think yogurt would also work.

Before you venture too far from the original recipe consider this:   taste the filling before adding it to the batter  and see if it is too tart.  I use the entire 8 oz pkg of cream cheese simply because I would waste the last 2 oz.  With the sweetness of the cake, the lemon filling is a nice contrast.  But I certainly would not call the filling sour!   I have made this coffee cake for twenty years after finding it in the Realemon cookbook.  It always gets rave reviews.

I made this cake exactly as specified and baked it almost to time indicated. Although it looked beautiful and the cinnamon topping smelled wonderful, the cake was dry and the cream cheese filling just didn't make sense with the flavoring of the cake. The lemon also gave it a little too much tang for my taste. This just didn't work for me and was a big disappointment.

Tasty cake as written, but too much lemon juice makes the filling a bit too tart. Will follow the suggestions to use vanilla next time.

I made 2 mistakes and it was wonderful. Didn't read recipe all the way through and left out the topping. Went to the store and from memory bought cream cheese remembering that it called for 2 (3oz. not 2-8oz) so I had cream cheese mix left over. I made a simple drizzle icing out of leftovers and added the nuts to the top. It was still very good. This is a KEEPER

The first time I found this recipe was in a 1989 Treasury of Christmas recipe cookbook, though the recipe differs from this one in that it calls for 2 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar instead of 3 as listed on Allrecipes. The only other alteration is more nuts in the cinnamon-nut topping, which I would never argue with. :-)

A delicious cake with a wonderful creamy center, a great choice for morning guests!
