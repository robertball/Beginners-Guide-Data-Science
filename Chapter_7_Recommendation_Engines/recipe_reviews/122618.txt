I cooked up 5 pounds of potatoes and it made an 8.5" x 11" dish of mash.  Cooking the wet ingredients really helps to get a smooth mash when it is all mixed in. I sprinkled some chopped chives on the top before serving.   I made it the day before and it was a hit!  A great, easy do ahead potatoe dish!

These are great mashed potatoes.  They're kind of like twice baked potatoes that you don't put back in the skins.  Great for a crowd or 2 hungry teenage boys and a husband.

I made this when I had some leftover mashed potatoes that I wanted to use up. I warmed them in the microwave, mixed in the cheese and egg, then baked them in the oven as directed. They came out great.

I was disappointed with these. The dense texture was probably my fault; I should have folded in the eggs (as directed! instead of whipping). But it needed a LOT more milk, and some flavor! These might have promise with a teaspoon of onion powder, some pepper, more salt, etc. I did not like the cheddar cheese taste for some reason. But this recipe may have promise with some doctoring.

These were really great!  I cut the recipe in half and made them ahead of time so I could just bake them when they were ready.  If making ahead, these need to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to baking.  YUM!

I was looking for mashed potato recipes because I had my last wisdom tooth taken out yesterday and have to follow the post-op diet.  This was a good recipe to start off with since I had all the ingredients (with slight exceptions) on hand so I didn't have to go to the store.  I didn't have Cheddar cheese, so I used the remaining four-cheese Mexican style cheese and mozzarella cheese I already had.  I didn't use salt because I used salted butter.  I thought it needed more flavor, so I sprinkled a lot of pepper and put sour cream on top.  I think the potatoes would have been better if I whipped them after mashing them since it was slightly too chunky for me to eat.  Other than that, this was a good basic recipe that didn't require me going to the store after my surgery.  Thanks! :)

I think it would have been better to make my usual mashed potatoes, add a couple to four eggs and cover the whole thing with at least 2 cups of cheese.  As it was it tasted like heavy, bland mashed potatoes with cheese melted on top.

While the taste was OK, these were very dry.  I might make them again but put maybe 1/3 cup more milk in before I bake them.  Also, I added a clove of garlic which I think helped the flavor otherwise I think that they would be too bland for our tastes.

Great for a make-ahead meal.  Could use some roasted garlic or fresh herbs for a dash of flavor.

These were pretty good, but somewhat bland, even though I used old cheese. I will make them again, because they are very convenient, and the idea is great, but I think I will add more salt, pepper, maybe some roasted garlic. With a spicy meal, they would be a good contrast as is.

This is a recipe that I had lost years ago and I am so happy to have found it! I almost forgot about it!  I always add more cheese and salt, also garlic.  Crumbled bacon on top is amazing, also you can add a couple dollops of sour cream, chopped chives, etc.  There are many possibilities! This dish is great when prepping a big dinner...you can make it earlier in the day and just put it in the fridge until you are ready to bake it.  Makes clean up and last minute prep so much easier than mashed potatoes.  An indulgent twist on a classic and everyone loves them!

Nothing special here, just tasted like regular bland mashed potates.  Won't be making this recipe again.

I wouldn't bother with this one.  Might as well make plain mashed potatoes.  We found this recipe dry and lacking taste.  Kind of a shame since I was hoping to use this as a make a day ahead mashed potatoes.

these are really good.  I did mine slightly different.  I used cold mashed potatoes so I had to nuke them to warm them up a bit then I threw the rest of the ingredients into the potatoes and whipped them together.  I didn't do the milk, butter and cheese on the stove.  very easy to make and very tasty

Yummy.  Please take one reviewer's comment and stir in the cheese vs. mixing in the cheese.  The potatoes came out a tad dry, so I will add milk next time. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. In addition to the cheese on top, I added bacon bits.  Yummy ..... and "thank you".

A big hit with the fam, and a nice change from basic mashed and "funeral potatoes" casserole. A great accompaniment to our ham!

I used leftover mashed potatoes that already had butter, milk, salt and pepper added.  I heated them in the microwave, then added a little additional milk, 2T of cubed butter and cheese and stirred together.  I made 6 servings, so I only used 1 egg and cut down on the cheese.  These were very smooth and creamy, puffed up nicely.  Delicious!

This was okay. It was pretty dry and somewhat bland. It was nice to try but I won't be making it again.

These are really good, creamy and smooth without having to add the usual sour cream and mayo.  Thanks for a great recipe.
