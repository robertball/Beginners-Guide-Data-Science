Very quick to make - Very Tasty! 
I did added diced chicken breast and cucumbers , as well as snow peas.   I will definitely be making this recipe again.
( do NOT omit the garlic! )

YUMMY!  I make the recipe, split it into two portions, and take for my lunch for two days!  I do take out the garlic - it's just too strong for me. Highly recommend!

The only thing I changed was adding sunflower seeds in place of nuts at the end.  I think I will also add a little extra broccoli next time.  Very good.

I made this as written (not using the substitutions in the notes) and we loved it. The dressing is delicate and light. The textures and flavors make this a wonderful addition to your meal. Thank you for your recipe.
