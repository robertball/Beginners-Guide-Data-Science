I made these for my son's preschool class and they LOVED them.  Timing is essential with this idea, though, as you must have the gelatin cooled just right to pour into cups.  I used Nerds candy for the "gravel" at the bottom of each glass(I used disposable cocktail glasses and they worked perfectly).  Also, in order to get the best results, they must be eaten as soon as they "set" or the candies will, indeed, become a gooey mess. I reccommend using Swedish Fish instead of simple gummy fish since they are harder and not so quick to "melt".  I topped each one with a gummy frog on top of a mint leaf and they looked adorable.  This is not quick or easy but if you have time and patience, they can be fun.

I made these for youth group and the kids loved them, they thought they were sooo cool! I used nerds for gravel and put blue glitter sprinkles on top. I made two batches and one didn't set up as nice, I was running out of time and poured the jello before it had a chance to cool. But they are a neat idea and a fun recipe.

made these for my Grandson's Birthday Treat for school. I was worried about the gummie-fish dissolving like the others have said, so i went to the dollar store and bought a package of plastic toy fishes and used them instead. They worked pefectly, and all the kids had a "prize" to take home!

I wanted to like this.  I made them today for a pirate-theme birthday party for our 3-yo twin neighbors.  I wished I would have experimented before today.  Oh well.  My major complaint:  one of the standard plastic punch cups holds 3/4 cups (6 oz.) so a regular 2 cup box of jello does NOT make 4 servings.  Based on other reviews to lighten the blue color of the Jello,  I mixed 2 boxes of Berry Blue JellO plus one envelope of Knox gelatine with appropriate water/ice.  I did this twice and it yielded 9 aquarium cups.     I used Nerds for the Aquarium gravel and that was a lovely idea but they started to melt into the JellO after 3 or 4 hrs. (I kept this one back from the party.)    All that being said, it was tasty and the kids loved them.

I added a packet of unflavored gelatine and a cup of ice to the recipe to  lighten the color.  Using ice seems to be the key to thicken the jello in order to keep the fish from floating to the top.  This recipe requires patience.

I agree-they must not "sit", or the fish turn icky. Other than that, they were GREAT for kids who love to cook and create.....

Props for creativity, but (perhaps my fault) poor execution.  I used Sweedish fish to prevent the gooey mess, but my jello was not as thick as it needed to be so they sank.  Also, I used mixed berries and they floated!  Mine are upside down cups, although its somewhat disheartening because the fish are floating on the surface, bringing up some interesting conversations.

I made these for a party and was very disappointed.  The jell-0 had a reaction with the candy fish which changed the consistency of the fish.   It was very gross and I could not serve them. I give it 1 star because the idea was cute.

I made these for my daycare kids at out "Luau" and they loved them. I could not find the gummy fish, so I used gummy octopus  instead. I also added a little brown sugar to the tops for sand, (as I was serving them). I will say however, that the jello is a darker blue than what is pictured so, be prepared for that. It makes the "gummy" in the center a little harder to see, but the kids still loved them.

Cute idea!  Unfortunately, I tried using the Nerds, but they started changing the color of the jello.  Then, I tried crushed pineapple, but they floated in the jello...I eventually used chopped pears (strawberries were out of season).

I put in the Swedish Fish, but they too turned into gummy mess...it looked like a fish that died in the tank that's molding...

The kids liked the jello, but not the fish..
