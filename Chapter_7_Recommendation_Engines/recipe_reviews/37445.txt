Really good, simple and fast.  Great for left overs the next day too.

My family is big on burritos and I usually buy frozen. I tried this recipe (with less cheese than is called for) and the entire family went wild! *Much* better than pre-made. Easy and quick to fix. This is definitely a "keeper".

Good, but kind of ho-hum boring.  I added tomatos and think if I make it again I will add some chopped green chiles to the meat mixture to jazz it up.  The kids liked it and it was quick and easy.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe!  The only thing my family felt was needed was more meat.  So try 1 and a 1/2 lbs. of hamburger.  Also we added more cheese on at the last 5 minutes.

These were fantastic and as an added bonus, the prep time is super quick.  I found the meat mixture to be a bit rich, but that might be because I made only 4 (instead of 6 as the recipe called for), so there was more meat in each of the wraps.  I served this with salsa and sour cream and a side of Spanish rice.  I will definitely make this again and not change a thing.

DELICIOUS! And relatively easy to prepare too. If you add pico de gallo and rice, and cook them on a griddle on the stovetop, they taste almost exactly like Taco Bell's grilled burritos.

This was really easy to put together and turns out wonderful.  I've made this recipe multiple times and found out to make sure you let the seasoned beef cool down for a couple minutes before adding the sour cream.

These are SO good! Simple to make, but very tasty and satisfying. I used 1½ lb ground beef, only ½ package taco seasoning (and I wouldn't want to use more than that for our taste). Instead of adding sour cream directly to meat, I added about a tablespoon to each burrito before adding cheese and folding.  We used extra sour cream and mild chunky salsa to dip burritos in before eating.

Good basic recipe. I add some salsa, tomato and black olives as well and heat it in the microwave rather than the oven for a quick meal.

I really liked the way baking the burrito made the flavors come together.  I also added fresh pico de gallo before cooking.  Next time, I think I will layer the sour cream separately instead of mixing with the ground beef.

Yum yum!  These were excellent!  I'd have given 5 stars but all the cheese and sour cream was a bit too much. Nevertheless, I'll have it again - perhaps mixed with rice or made with chicken!
