These cookies are ridiculously addicting. They are so simple, but the taste and texture of them are amazing. I left out the nuts and coconut out of personal preference, but I really don't think they're worse off without them. The texture is somewhere between a pecan sandie and a good crumbly peanut butter cookie. While they don't have a greasy appearance or mouthfeel, once you pick one up you'll be looking for a napkin to wipe your fingers on. I halved the recipe and made the cookies small and got 55. I've already eaten an embarrassing amount of them, so I don't think I'll make them again until I have somewhere to take them so someone else can eat them too. Thanks!

These cookies tasted very good. They were addicting, you couldnt just eat one. There are a few small things i would change about the recipe. Instead of adding 1 cup of vegetable oil, i would only use 1/2 cup of oil and substitute the rest for water. This made my cookies less greasy and not as fattening. Also i replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips because i am not a fan of nuts.  I would definitly recommend these cookies for any occasion.

The best cookie ever! Be sure to flatten them with a glass. Cool cookie for about 5 minutes before  handling, they a a little fragile when they are still warm. I made these for a baby shower and added a cup of buttersotch morsels and everyone said they were the best cookie they ever tasted (cut back a little on the sugar if you do this.

Excellent cookie! I was unsure about using so much oil, but it turned out great. I didn't have unsweetened coconut, so I used sweetened and it was fine. I also added 1/2 c of semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 c of butterscotch chips. Yummy!

This recipe is awesome!  I'm always looking for something other than the usual chocolate chip or oatmeal drop cookie.  This is it.  Try it-fast and easy.

This is the cookie my mom used to call "Ranger Cookies" (also sometimes called Cowboy Cookies) -- she got the recipe from the LA Unified School District.  This dough makes a great chocolate chip cookie -- just add 3 or 4 cups chips to this recipe.

I was sooo worried that they were going to come out very greasy because of the amount of oil ad butter in them. Surprisingly, my very critical family all loved them! They were really good, light and delish. Not too sweet.

These cookies are great. I took them to a holiday party. No one could figure out what was in them! And they all had different guesses - and laughed when I told them! They are crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. They are also very rich - you can see the oil!

I think this is an excellent recipe as a start for someone who has never prepared cookies before. So yes, this was my first time baking cookies! I found this recipe very easy, as well very flexible and "beginner friendly". Everything went smoothly, except something I did wrong, and I repeat here because even though it's said on the instructions, it might not seem that obvious for someone who tries to bake cookies for the first time: Be careful with the amount of dough you pour on the cookie paper for each cookie! without pretending it, I ended up with monster sized cookies :-) As well they became a bit too greasy. I wonder what could be made to prevent it. That's all. Very nice overall.

Have made this several times exactly as the recipe is written - except I did crush the cereal thoroughly, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  My husband just got through saying:  "Cookies don't get any better than this!"
If you don't follow the recipe as it's written, then don't blame your failure on the recipe.  For those of you who start switching out the oil for other ingredients, consider this: This recipe made 10dz approx 2" cookies- divide the 1 cup oil by the 120 cookies and you're getting an infinitesimal amount of oil per cookie.  And oil is not a saturated fat.  I use a soya or canola for a healthier oil.
Some people comment on the crumbly texture of the dough - if you really beat the butter and sugars until fluffy as per the recipe, then slowly add in the oil, then beat it really well before adding the rest of the ingredients, you will have an easy to manage dough that holds up.  I didn't flatten the cookies - they smoothed out on their own.  And lastly, to those who took off stars because of the length of time to bake their cookies, the time should always be regarded as a guideline - every single oven differs.  Mine took 15 minutes for the first 3 trays, and 12 for the last 2 last trays.
Thank you LintonBJ for an excellent recipe.  By the way, I love the suggestion from some reviewers about freezing the balls of dough.  I will do that some  time, it's an excellent idea.

I love this recipe but I changed it a little bit.  I put a cup of mini chocolate chips instead of the nuts and instead of the cornflakes I use Special K Cinnamon Pecan cereal.  Everyone LOVES them!

Turned out great.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil and they came out great!  Nice and moist and not to sweet.  Did these cookies not flatten out for anyone else...I pressed mine down to get the shape i wanted because my tester cookie looked like a dome of a football stadium.

i like this recipe its very flexible. i used 1/2 cup veg oil and 1/2 cup water like kelly suggested and they werent greasy. i used crisp rice cereal instead of cornflakes and substituted pecans for walnuts. also i toasted the pecans and coconut together for 4 minutes at 350F and put them in the food processor along with the crisp rice to get a uniform size for all of the add-ins. it was a very good recipe :] and if you dont want to change anything i would still recommend using half oil and half water

I didn't have cooking oil in house, so I used olive oil, and I got ravings galore at the curling club, at our after game coffee and cookies.

This was an easy, fast, and delicious cookie.  I used granola instead of oats and corn flakes (because that's what I had in the house) and that worked great.   Warning, though - these cookies go from "done" to "burned" very quickly!!

I just made these and they were good. I would add choc chips or something a little plain without. Nice for something different. I too cut back on the oil a little and added water in place. Still good.

FABULOUS!!!  This is my new favorite cookie!  I did a 1/2 cup of water and a 1/2 cup of oil just to make sure they weren't too rich or greasy, I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I used rice krispies instead of corn flakes.  These are delish, moist, sweet but not too sweet, and perfectly wonderful.  I put half of the dough in the freezer so will try to bake those off next week and hopefully that will work just fine as well.

These cookies are so good! I only made a few changes because I didn't have the some of the ingredients. instead of corn flakes I used rice kripsies and instead of the walnuts I used white chocolate chips. I prefer my cookies to be soft and chewy however I really liked how these were crunchy but not in an over done kind of way. My husband looooved these. I needed a quick recipe and wasn't paying attention to the quantity after I mixed everything together I rolled them into tbls size balls and ended up with 106 cookies! My husbands office loves me now :-)

Great cookie! The texture, perfect! Crisp, lite, buttery, but bends with a chew due to the coconut. I was scared of all that oil, backed it down to 3/4 cup, was just fine. Didn't seem greasy to me at all as others had mentioned. I didn't use cereal, added extra oatmeal. I don't give five stars that easily! A keeper!

Very good.  Made per recipe with one exception...used choc chips instead of nuts.  Used my cookie scoop that holds 1 Tbs of dough.  Made 10 doz cookies.  Would probably cut in half next time.  Also baked at 350 for 10 min.  Will definitely make again!

Awesome recipe.  I had to some half whole wheat flour because I ran out of all purpose, and I used half oil and half applesauce, but this cookie turned out phenomenal. Thanks for posting!

Oh my gosh!  These are the greatest cookies!  And so simple to make!!  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but I have a new convection oven and wasn't sure how to convert.  I wanted to try out the convection side, so I stayed with the same temperature, but just took them out at 9.5 minutes and they came out AWESOME!!  This recipe will DEFINITELY go into my "favorites" file!!

These cookies were really fast and easy. (The dough was really tasty for those who like to snack on cookie dough ;)
They had a great texture and consistency, but I found them to be fragile cookies that would crumble easily. Very yummy. I also added a bag of chocolate chips to mine, and now I think this is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe! 
WIll make again!

I agree with earlier reviews that the vegetable oil makes the cookies a bit greasy so will try the option of water next time. I also by choice omitted the nuts and coconut and they turned out really good! They seem to be the type of cookie that you can add anything to the base dough which allows for many different flavours with what you have on hand. The children really loved them!!

these aren't bad but they aren't great.  for my taste they are too greasy.  Also i can't really taste the coconut or tell that there are corn flakes, and 12 minutes is too long to bake these.

I made these today exactly from the recipe.  They are delicious! My husband loved them.  I agree with the other reviewer who said if you haven't made the recipe exactly as written don't expect the same results.  I like to read the reviews for ideas but if you haven't made them you can't really add anything.

I didn't have 1 cup unsweetened flaked coconut, so left it out, and upped cornflakes a cup instead. The cookies were buttery, solid, with just the right amount of tender/crisp without being hard and crunchy, or soft. Great cookie jar cookie. I made about 5 dozen, froze half right away.

Superb recipe, and the cookies DO improve immensely a day or two later - I always thought warm cookies were the best, but not in this case.  I used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce and omitted the oil entirely, and added 1 tsp cream of tartar as another reviewer had suggested.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon (thank you, previous reviewer!). I substitued butterscotch chips instead of walnuts, and I used "honey nut cornflakes" in lieu of plain cornflakes.  Everybody raved about these cookies - especially my grandchildren.  I left the whole batch at their house and I'm going to make them again tomorrow, using Heath bar chocolate toffee chips.  I think those will be even yummier than the butterscotch chips.   THANK YOU for this outstanding recipe!!!

I really liked the ease of putting these cookies together, my 4 year old was able to help me.  The taste of the cookies are great.  My family loves them.  After reading all the reviews, I don't think they are as rich as so many people described. I used 1/2C oil & 1/2C water.  I made decent sized cookies so the bake time was about 14 minutes.  They are really good, but I don't know that I like them with cornflakes - certain bites are chewy, kinda gummy.  Otherwise, they're good.

Awesome!!!  I didn't put the nuts or coconut in it though.  My family isn't fond of them.  I also used frosted flakes because I didn't have corn flakes.  Added some chocolate chips because I took out the other ingredients.  They turned out great and my family loved them.  Thanks!!!

The best!  I used raisin bran instead of corn flakes, and chopped peanuts instead of walnuts.  I only use sweetened coconut so that was a given.  I also didn't have enough white flour so used half whole wheat.  I bet these changes really change the taste of the cookie, making it just as good as this great original recipe.

My household doesn't like coconut or nuts (we have a nut allergy), so I left these two ingredients out and threw in 2 cups of mini chocolate chips!  Also used Frosted Flakes instead of Corn Flakes (since that's what was in our pantry).  Worked GREAT!  Everyone loved the surprise of the cereal in the cookies!  I had no problem with oiliness at all!  They were perfect!  Definitely keeping this recipe!  Thank you SOOO much!

I made these for a meeting and they went over so, so well. I did make a change and used chopped cashews because that's what I had on hand and I also added dried cranberries. There were absolutely no cookies left by the time we left the meeting.

I altered this recipe but I am going to rate it anyway. I only had one stick of butter so I halved the recipe. However, I used heaping 3/4 cups of the coconut, oats, and cereal. Instead of corn flakes I used rice krispies, and my coconut was sweetened. I omitted the nuts, and added 3/4c semisweet chocolate chips.  I used a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop, and flattened out a couple on the first batch to see how I preferred them. I prefer them dropped right from the scoop, unflattened. Mine were perfect right at 8 minutes. When I tried them fresh out of the oven, I was disappointed - they somehow seemed totally flavorless. However, one thing I have learned about baking cookies is that they almost always taste way better the next day,  So, I tried them the next morning and they were FANTASTIC. Delicious flavor, and I love love love the texture (although my alterations definitely changed that). They were chewy, yet not cakey at all, and the rice krispies gave a definite crunch. I love recipes like this, ones that allow lots of customizing. I took them to work and everyone loved them (and my co-workers don't mind sharing their true feelings!) This is definitely a keeper for me.

The cookies came out crispy on the edges and soft chewy in the middle.  I really liked them.  I had a meeting at my home and everyone enjoyed them! A few people asked to take some cookies home with them.  I told them to check out ALLRECIPES.COM!  Sharon Webb, VA

This was most interesting. I used Bran flakes (that's all I had for cereal), and added 1 cup semi sweet choc. chips. Other than that, followed recipe as written. I baked first cookie sheet at 10 minutes. We tried them, and they were too dry and crumbly. I just did average rounded teaspoons, so the remainder I cooked for @8-8 1/2 minutes. They were great, not dry, not crumbly. Mine were best taken out before they browned. So it's worth it to cook the first cookie sheet, wait and try it, adjust time accordingly.

I didn't have coconut but still I managed to make these yummy treats even more sinful than they were meant to be.  I used toasted pecans (never use walnuts), and, in addition to the oats and cornflakes, I added some mini chocolate chips and some Skor bits.  I also made them larger and they are now filed as THE EVERYTHING COOKIE.  Very addictive indeed!

These were really good, a nice change from chocolate chip cookies. The kids actually really liked them, I did omit the coconut because I don't really care for it. These are rich, but delicious!

This was one of the first recipes I made off of AllRecipes.com and they were the best cookies I ever tasted.
I did add just your normal white icing to it and it made it even better!!!

Can't stop making these!  Everyone is asking for more.  I made them for our annual bake sale and everyone was coming back for the recipe.  Since then I have made them and sold cookies at a swap meet...sold every one!  I started adding 1/2 package semi sweet choc. chips.  Great either way!  Thanks!

Honestly, I was torn about whether to give these cookies a 4 or 5 star rating. These cookies taste really good BUT... the consistency is weird.  My boyfriend and aunt also really liked them.  I will probably make them again.

These cookies are rich & delicious, but feel light and airy . . . and everyone kept trying to guess what was in them.  The cornflakes were a  surprise.

CONGRATULATIONS ON SUCH A UNIQUE COOKIE!  i made these for christmas cookies and they were awesome!! the only thing I did different was drizzle white chocolate on them for looks.  I will try them next time with maybe choc chips and/or almonds for a macaroony flavor or maybe peanut butter in place of butter for a different taste but these are great as they are!

I love these cookies. But the cornflakes were tough to chew. I used Bits 'O Brickle Toffee bits instead of nuts. I also used only a 1/2 cup of vegetable oil with a 1/2 cup of water.

These are very good.  I followed the previous suggestion and used just 1/2 c veg oil and 1/2 water.  Next time I will try without the water and see what happens as there seems to be enough liquid without. I'll consider leaving the nuts out also.  There's enough crunchy texture with the oatmeal, cereal and coconut. The cookie also spread nicely without having to flatten it and had a nicely browned cracked top after baking 10 minutes.

These are so easy to make and taste so good. They were hard to keep on the table as I baked them. Family loved them.  They stay moist for a longer time so that makes them even better. I was a little worried about the consistancy of the batter but when the cookies were finished I understood why it called for the oil and butter. Delicious! will be making them again soon!

I read the reviews before trying this recipe out and have to disagree with what most reviewers said; there is WAY too much oil in these cookies.  I used 3/4 of a cup and wish I had decreased it to a 1/2 cup, or even omitted it all together and used milk.  I liked the texture of the cookie -- the crunch of the cereal with the chewy oats and coconut, but found the flavor pretty bland.  I would add some cinnamon, use 1 Tablespoon vanilla instead of two teaspoons, and add chocolate chips.  But I probably won't be making this one again.  There are better cowboy cookie recipes on this site that I have tried.  It was also super annoying having to scrub my hands clean between every batch in order to not get oil all over everything I touched.

It was my first time ever making cookies, it wasn't that difficult :) Although the first tries ended up with some burnt cookies, at the end I got around 40 good looking cookies. The only difference was that I used sliced almonds instead of the walnuts, but it turned up good. Very good recipe, thank you very much.

SOOOOOO GOOOD!!! I didn't have any rolled oats or walnuts (that would have totally made the cookie) but they were still delicious : ) I added chocolate sprinkles and sweetened coconut (that's all I had on hand). Super easy recipe. I also used an ice cream scoop to make all the cookies the same size. Thanks a bunch for making this a cookie afternoon!

These cookies were delicious! I was looking for something different from the traditional cookie, and this hit the spot. I loved the crunch that the cornflakes added. I did use 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. apple sauce to make it a little more healthy, and they turned out perfect. Will definitely make again!

Warning! Do not make these cookies if you are on a diet. Addiction risk! Some of the best cookies I have ever eaten. Melt in your mouth. I only omitted the nuts - don't like 'em.

Super nice cookie. Needed less baking time for my oven, the suggestion to flatten the balls before baking was excellent. Otherwise, I left this recipe alone.

Wow!!  These cookies are GREAT!!  I am NOT a cook.  Ask anyone, but I needed cookies for a cookie swap.  These were so easy!  Not only were they easy, but I made tons of cookies.  I used the teaspoon scoop as recommended and the cookies kept coming and coming.  Both of my kids wanted me to make more for their BS/GS troop Xmas parties.    Anyway, it's a hassle free easy to do recipe with yummy cookies!  Stick to the 12 minutes cooking time or they'll come out too hard.

I made them pretty much exactly like the recipe.  They were good, I used smaller ice cream scoop and then flattened with my hand.  Let them sit for a minute or two then remove from pan otherwise they will crumble.  I preferred them warm.  They get really crunchy when they cool.

I so wanted to like this recipe. The first time I made the cookies, they were entirely too salty. I think that the full teaspoon of salt AND the full teaspoon of baking soda caused this. I made them a second time with a reduced amount of 1/2 tsp each. They were better, but I would not describe them as rich as the author of the recipe did. I think it would be helpful to add some chocolate chips or maybe even raisins to the recipe.

I have made this recipe several times now and every time I ask my kids what kind of cookie they want, they always say these. They are scrumptious! The best I have ever had...and I make a lot of cookies! I never change a thing on the recipe with one exception. I have tried both cornflakes and rice krispy cereal and I prefer the rice krispy cereal better.

I didn't have any walnuts on hand, but I substitued chopped cashews and it turned out great!  I did have to bake at 350 instead of 375 to avoid scorching.  It's refreshing to find a cookie that isn't just a remake of the chocolate chip cookie!  I'll be making these again!

These cookies were... fleh. Not terrible, not great. I was expecting much better from reading the reviews. I tasted the first batch after they came out of the oven and immediately realized that they needed some jazzing up, so I added chocolate chips to some, dried cranberries to some, and cinnamon chips to the rest. The extra flavors helped, but they're still not great. Will not make again. They're not horrible, but for me they're definitely not worth the time it takes to bake cookies from scratch.

Wow!! I'm really please with how this cookies turned out. Really really nice. Be warned, it's very rich though, so clearly not for those who's wacthing their weight and no, once you eat one, you won't be able to stop. I substituted a lot of the ingredients though, I used sunflower seeds instead of nuts and muesli instead of oats,mainly because those are all what I have in my cupboard.I added chocolate chips and omitted coconut because I don't like coconut. Will use this recipe as the base of my cookie recipe and experiment with different flavour/combination. MAny thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious cookies.  I made them with coconut oil.  I smashed the cornflakes somewhat.  Next time I will crush them a bit more.  I also chopped the coconut into fine pieces, because my kids don't like the texture.  Great for a breakfast treat!

I was expecting great things from these cookies and was disappointed with the end result.  I halved the recipe and replaced the nuts with M & M's and used mostly applesauce instead of the full amount of oil.  Oh well...there's lots of other cookie recipes on this site to try!

Great cookies and easy to follow recipe! I followed the advice of another by using 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup water and it worked well. This makes a lot of cookies so consider cutting it in half. I also didn't use the nuts (personal preference). Again - GREAT Cookies!

I like the batter but the corn flakes make some bite tough and chewy. I would leave them out. It adds nothing to the cookie.

I had to add more oil (about 1/4 cup) and 1/2 cup of water before the fun stuff...tasty dough but a little dry, especially for what was to come...I added (unmeasured) corn flakes, small marshmallows, red hots, mini m&m's, a lot of oatmeal, honey...and that may have been all. Amazing!

Love these! They make so many so it is great for sharing and still having enough at home. They have a very nice texture on the outside(all that butter and oil). Remind me a lot of Ranger cookies.  They taste like GOOD supermarket bakery cookies.  I only had about 1/2 cup of pecan chips and they were great. I would like big pieces of walnuts but they are not for everyone. Someone says they are chewy, maybe if I used butter flavored shortening or maybe margarine but not with Butter.  They are definitely a crispy butter texture. My hubby wants choc. chips in them as I see some others did.

These were great cookies!  I added 1 tsp cream of tartar and 1/2 tsp almond extract and substituted chocolate flakes for the coconut.  All the nuts was a big hit for this cookie.

Very good flavour.  The only thing I omitted was the nuts.  Added a bit more cornflakes to make up for that.  Also mixed everything with a wooden spoon.  Makes loads of cookies

Love these cookies a little to much (had to make a second batch cause I ate most of the first!).  I didn't have nuts and only had sweeten coconuts flakes and it came out great.  Will try them with chocolate chips next. great cookie!!!!

I absolutely LOVED these cookies! I'm not a fan of nuts and didn't have any coconut.  But instead I added a bag of toffee and chocolate, it made these cookies!  I'll be making these more often!

these were pretty fun go make.  My son loved putting "cereal" in the cookies.  I changed a few things too.. I 1/2 the oil and put a 1/2 cup of water in.  I also put a cup and a half of the oats, cereal, and coconut.  I also but in 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 of shortening for the extra crispness.  Anyway, they're pretty tasty.

The corn flakes and the oat meal really changed this chocolate cookie into one heck of a cookie.  I used raisan bran.  My picky spouse took these to work to brag.  Awesome!!

This cookie was incredibly easy to make and baked up very nicely.  I made a double batch and quickly realized just how many that made. I followed the recipe suggestion and made lots of extra scoops of cookie dough and it's in my freezer for later.  These cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy and delicious on the inside.   They are truly one of the best cookies I have made. 

Just a note- I did add about a cup of chocolate chips to the recipe.

not what i expected! with all that sugar, oil and butter i thought they would be a much heavier, sweeter cookie. i was pleasantly surprised! these cookies are very light in taste and have the texture of an old favorite, the "sandies" cookies.

Just took the first batch out of the oven! They are fantastic cookies, and this comes from someone who bakes at least 2 batches of cookies every week, and is constantly looking for new recipes. This one's a keeper!

Awesome cookies!  I reduced coconut to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup heath toffee chips, added 3/4 cup semisweet chips (will add more next time), and finally substituted chopped pecans, because that is what I had.  These are great cookies!

I made these for Thanksgiving, wow they got rave reviews. I thought they tasted a little floury, I will definitely be making them again. The only thing I did different was added pecans instead of walnuts (because that is what I had). I could not imagine these with anything but pecans, they really do taste like a pecan sandy.

Whew.... looks like somebody re-discovered Original Toll House Cookie dough without one of the key flavor ingredients. (That's a second stick of butter)

The half cup of oil substitute (I made a half batch) makes these taste rather bland.

Chocolate chips and macadamia nuts helped little if any.



Definitely would not make these again.

These tasted good, but they were so crumbly that they made a mess. However, I found a really good use for all the crumbles! Sprinkle them on top of icecream!!

They were really good ( I made variations on the 'additions') but I have to say, far too rich.. there was just too much butter and oil.  Though tasty, I won't make them again because of this.

My grandmother has a recipe like this that she calls 'Cornflake cookies' or 'Dishpan cookies' though with slightly diff measurements for the ingredients and she bakes them at 325 for 15 min.   I love these cookies but it is soooooo true u can't eat just one, so i bake them and then give them away to coworkers and friends asap!  :)

Very good cookie! Made just as recipe states except I didn't have corn flakes so add Raisin Bran. I told husband not to both even eating they were not good at all. As eating his second handful he said seeing how they were so bad he better eat them up fast! They sure have a lot of different things in them! Well the 2 of us has pretty much polished them off in a couple days! They are a good foundation cookie for any type of additions. They do remind me of a Pecan Sandie.

delicious!

instead of using corn flakes, i used rice krispies (since that's all i had at home).

i also left out the chocolate. but i added raisins and dried cranberries. 

everything else i kept the same and it turned out very yummy!

Great cookie (thanks!)and easy to make - my 11 y.o. made them w/two of her friends. Upon others recommendation we used 1/2 c oil and other 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I added 1 1/2 c choc chips.  We didn't have corn flakes so used the same amt of rice krispies - they turned out really good. Would make these again.

One of the few perfect cookie recipes i've made. I wasen't sure because of the amount of oil but they turned out perfect. I love the coconut,cereal and oats. What a combo!!!! Thanks for sharing!

I don't know what these cookies taste like if I had followed the recipe.  However, I forgot the oats, cornflakes, and coconut.  But the cookies are absolutely marvelous!  I didn't even realize I hadn't added all the ingredients until I started making up a recipe card.  I'll have to try this recipe with the rest of the ingredients!

These were.....odd.  The dough was so crumbley I couldn't get the cookies to stay together on the cookie sheet before baking.  I did add a second egg, which helped a little.  The ones we ate the same day were pretty tasty but any cookies left over got very stale, even when I stored them in a sealed container.  Probably won't try again.

Great cookies.  
As I hate cooking with oil,I swapped the oil for butter.  
Not sure what size everyone else cookies are, but I used walnut size pieces of cookie dough and ended up with 60 cookies

These are my New FAVORITE cookie... I used rice and oat cereal, chocolate chips and pecans. You just have to make sure not to cook them too long. I also prefer to flatten them with a glass or they don't flatten.

Easily THE best cookies i have made. I can't believe they turned out so good!! it's just I think i didn't bake them long enough because they are kind of soft, but they are still DELICIOUS!!! Oh and I didn't have rolled oats so i used old fashioned Quaker oats instead. Definately would use this again.

Awesome cookies!!  I added chocolate chips (in the picture but not ingredients).  They are pretty dry to handle but cook up great.  Many kids loved them too (without the nuts).

These are great cookies! I didn't have corn flakes so I used bran flakes and didn't put in the walnuts. I also added some dried sweetened cranberries. These cookies might be my husband's new favorites.

I bake goodies for our hockey team whenever they go on a "road trip."  I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, but the ingredients looked good.  Well, I must say, these are terrific!  They are not overwhelmingly sweet like some others that seems to be a turn-off to these kids.  I'll make them again and again!

I chose this recipe because of the yield with only one egg--one is all I had on hand.  I flattened mine gently by criss crossing a fork on them.  They are very good flavor, but don't like being so aware of the amount of oil I am eating.  But I will probably make them again now and then.

I am not at all a fan of this recipe. As a pretty experience cook, I'm doubtful I made any mistakes.  If you like dry, crunchy, hard cookies that leave oil stains on paper towels I say this cookie is for you!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever used for cookies! Very versitile. I swap the 1 cup walnuts for whatever is in the pantry when I am baking - raisins, choc chips or m and ms. Cook some for immediate use (always eaten just after baking!) and freeze the rest in small balls. Great to quickly bake for unexpected visitors.

If you enjoy a crunchy cookie that isn't very sweet then this is the one! I made it without the walnuts or coconut and it was delicious! Brought it to a women's meeting and only brought back 3! :) Yes, they are super addictive!

Very good cookies I would make again.  I added 1cup of trail mix (nut's, dried berries & M&M's) with the cereal and omitted the butter since I didn't have any on hand and they still turned out very good. Thanks for the recipe!!

I love trying new recipes..especially cookie recipes..Literally bake thousands of cookies for various events..these cookies are excellent..everyone loved them. Read the reviews and added the butterscotch chips to half of them..outstanding with or without. 12 minutes made mine overdone..9-10 minutes worked better in my oven.

I joined the site just so I could review the recipe! I used to make this recipe about twice a month for my daughter to bring in as snack. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE COOKIE! It's everything: sweet, salty, chewy. I do throw the oats/coconut/nuts/corn flakes (sometimes I use rice crispies) in the food processor before adding.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I never have corn flakes so I just use 1-1/2 c. each of the oatmeal and coconut. I also add 1-1/2 c. chocolate chips and 1 c. of coarsely chopped pecans.  This would also be good with white chocolate chips, dried cherries, and macadamias (might use half almond/half vanilla).

Now I understand where this cookie got its name from: it is cooky that it cannot make up its mind. There was too much going on with the coconut, walnut, and cornflakes. There wasn't enough coconut to call it a coconut cookie, and I didn't know what the purpose of the cornflakes was besides a weird texture. There wasn't enough of the cornflakes to even appreciate the crunch. The cookie also left a sweet after taste, but not in a satisfying way. It's all over the place! I guess this is a subjective cookie. It depends whose palate you want to please.

These are awesome.  I substituted rice crispies for the corn flakes and did not add the walnuts.  Yum!

This recipe is delicious! I omitted the nuts due to allergies in my family but oh this would be soooo good with pecans or walnuts! The cookies are light with just the right amount of crispiness. The batter is not sticky at all which makes them a cinch to drop on a cookies sheet. This recipe made almost 6 dozen (minus two). They are just right the way they are but these would be so good too as a base for mini chips of any sort - bigger chips might be overpowering but they would work too! I just love these and can't wait for my five boys to try them!

These cookies are amazing. Just the right amount of sweetness and texture. I will admit, most kids will not like these. But my 16 and 18 year old inhaled them. TWO thumbs up..do not change a thing!

These are awesome!!!  I am in the midst of Christmas baking, and I stumbled upon this recipe in my search for something that is a little different.  These fit the bill for my needs.  They are soft, yet have a lovely texture to them.  I followed the recipe exactly, as I wanted a non-chocolate cookie, but I could totally see adding some chocolate chips, and will probably do just that when I make them in the future.  I only baked two cookies, as I just wanted to try them, and freeze the rest to bake off when it is closer to Christmas.  I am glad I only baked the two, as I can only imagine how many I would eat if they were sitting in the kitchen right now!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe LINTONBJ :)
