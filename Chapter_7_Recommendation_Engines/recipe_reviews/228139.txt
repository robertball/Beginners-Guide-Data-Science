I had been reading about Bacon Jam on different websites (especially for gourmet hamburger topping) and found a site that sold it...but wanted to make my own and was thrilled when I saw this recipe!  I reduced the recipe to 8 servings, used white balsamic vinegar (didn't have sherry vinegar), used powdered coffee (Starbucks Via) instead of brewed coffee and added water for substitute), also didn't read recipe directions at end and added ketchup with rest of ingredients and let it cook.  Used an immersion blender while it was still warm and couldn't wait to taste it.  WOW is all I have to say.  Hubby & I are both thinking  about all the different ways we can use this.  It has a nice amount of sweetness, spice and bite (from cayenne) to go on just about anything.  Next time I'm making the full recipe!!!  Thank you so much, Cheryl!  It's awesome!

I had a little grilled porterhouse steak left over from dinner last night, so I sliced it down, and spread the slider roll with the bacon jam.  Unusual combination of ingredients, and the punch of flavor from the cayenne is spot on.  Once refrigerated, it's a little difficult to spread, but a  short reheat in the microwave brings it back to spreading consistency.  This recipe may not be for everybody, but we enjoyed it.  It's definitely "outside the box."

I had never had bacon jam and kept seeing it on different programs and thought it was a delicious idea. Maybe it was because of my preconceived notion that the bacon would really shine through and the spread would be nice and smoky. It ended up tasting more like bacon sloppy joe mix, or barbecue sause and being REALLY sweet, and I didn't even add all of the ketchup. I don't think it's a bad recipe, I just think it's too sweet for my palate. Mine was also considerably greasy. I drained all of the bacon emptied all of the grease aside from probably a tablespoon or two, definitely nowhere near a half cup. The grease rose to the top and looks a mess, my hope is I can scoop a good amount of it off once its completely cooled in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe, it was fun to try.

Good stuff, and I took the advice of a couple reviewers. I poured off almost all the bacon drippings - there was still enough fat to sautee the onions. I also added the ketchup with the rest of the liquids, but I may omit it all together next time. The recipe is veering close to a sweet BBQ sauce and I think it would allow the bacon to shine through a bit more.

Made this yesterday, and while it is quite tasty it is also a little acidic.  I would add the ketchup with all the other liquid ingredients so that the acidity cooks out rather than only letting it cook for 5 minutes.

My family has a big Family Cook-off every year, I tried this on the folks in my office; we tried it with everything from crackers to salmon. I asked them to choose between this and the Candied Bacon Pigs (also a yummy recipe) With their unanimous slobbering votes I took it to my cook-off where I won 1st place in appetizers.  I pretty much followed the recipe, I used apple-wood bacon because I found some on sale and my store was out of sherry vinegar so I used Chianti Wine vinegar the 2nd time.  This is going to be a new family fav!

So I thought I had plenty of time to make this, but I should have allowed about two hours.  The house still smells wonderful and we can't wait to take this to a party tomorrow.  I completely cooked the bacon and removed it to drain then fried the onion in bacon grease.  The finished product doesn't feel greasy at all.

This is Great!  I have made it twice and shared at some family gatherings and with friends they they love it!  Try the Jim Beams Honey  Whiskey with this recipe and it is very good!  Since you will be putting this in a food processor at the end,  bacon ends and pieces works very well.  Just trim off some of the big pieces of fat before you fry it.  This is not a quick recipe and it is worth every minute you spend on it.  It is great on scrambled eggs, egg casseroles, bread, muffins and much more!  Very addictive.

Thank you for the recipe, I will definitely be using this many times!

this recipe is very good. When I make it the next time, I will drain all the fat before adding the onions. I drained almost the whole 1/2 cup of bacon fat from the finished jam. It was quite greasy. other than that, yummy!

I saw bacon jam on the food network or some where, probably Guy Fieri, and have been wanting to make it.  This looked like the best recipe I had seen. It was heartbreaking to cook 2 pounds of bacon at once but I went all in. It allowed me to get rid of some bourbon I never drank too. I used 1/2 cup of drippings until the end. I drained off most of it before adding the ketchup. And oh son. This is my new favorite thing. I have convinced a dozen people to try it since last night. Will definitely be making this again.

My daughter is allergic to maple, any suggestions? I could use corn syrup for the sweetness, but do I need anything extra flavor?

Just finished a 40 serving batch.  This is the 2nd time I've made this. Everyone that has tried this loves it!  It takes quite a bit of time, but we'll worth it.  This batch,from start to finish was almost a full 5 hours.  Make it,and you will love it. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Good, but I think it could be much, much better.  This is very sweet.  I cooked the bacon, drained all the liquid that I could, then continued on with the recipe.  I also added the ketchup with the other liquids as recommended by someone else.  If I make this again I will dramatically reduce the amount of sweetener and increase the cayenne.  It was way too sweet and not at all spicy.  I would probably halve the amount of both brown sugar and maple syrup.  At least.

I had nearly all the ingredients -- lacked a little bit of bacon, she brought hers -- and subbed champagne vinegar for the sherry vinegar and subbed two-thirds Whataburger Spicy Ketchup and one-third regular Ketchup for the pinch of cayenne. I used what I had on hand. We like spicy things.
I'm pretty sure that I'm going to have to put a chain and lock on the fridge so I don't find myself in the kitchen in the middle of the night eating this with a spoon straight out of the jar. She and I split the batch and there should be enough to last me till.... ummmm.... the New Year's?  Maybe?
If you are looking for something unusual, exotic, absolutely mind-blowing -- too much? -- a fabulous treat for your senses, try this recipe! Keep in mind, though, there are many quality ingredients in it and as far as I'm concerned it will become your absolute guilty pleasure. And you won't care at all that you may have to consider chains and locks for your fridge.

This was so so good great flavor i made it and its good on grilled chicken and steak or just eaten with corn chips. Yummy yummy. I will certainly will be making again. The only thing i did different was i used crushed red pepper flakes instead of cyan pepper(cause i did not have any on hand but pepper flakes worked great). If your a Michigan person you can find the Sherry Vinegar at Zingerrmans Deli in Downtown Ann Arbor.. The Sherry Vinegar is hard to fine.. Just a note: Sherry cooking wine is NOT the same as Sherry Vinegar..

This is delicious.  However, it took me almost 3 times longer to cook it than the recipe says.  Not sure why.  It is worth the work.  Very easy, just time consuming.
