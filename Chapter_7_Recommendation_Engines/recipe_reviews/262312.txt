These cookies are delicious - not too sweet, and they melt in your mouth. They reminded me of something like a 'peanut shortbread'. They're also easy to make. Thank you for the recipe!

Did not expect these to be as tender as they are! I will definitely make again, so much easier than shortbread! Made as written.
