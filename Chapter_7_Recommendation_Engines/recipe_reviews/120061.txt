This four star recipe became a five with the helpful hints from other reviewers:  That is, I went a bit heavier on the seasonings; I used salsa instead of canned tomatoes--about 1 cup of my local grocer's awesome fresh salsa; I reduced cooking time to a total of six hours on low for thinly sliced top sirloin steak; and I sauteed the peppers and onion (and sliced mushrooms) in olive oil and served as optional, on the side.  

When I do wraps, I always offer them as build-your-own, buffet-style, to accommodate different preferences. Sure enough, everyone comes up with their own perfect combination of ingredients.

This is a very easy and rewarding recipe. Thank you :)  It made it to my 'family favourites' folder on first try.

Great recipe. 

The only change I made was adding the juice of one lime. Our family ate the 
whole crockpot full. No leftovers.

This is going in my current rotation!

EDITED 08/18/08: I made this again today
filling the whole crockpot. I added an extra onion and and extra pepper. (And those peppers were HUGE. I remember last time that I doubled the spices, I just might do that again. I also used garlic powder and worchestershire sauce. My house smells SO good. I plan on shredding some pepperjack to go with it and making homemade refried beans.

I followed this recipe as written with one exeption.  I cooked the peppers and onion in 2 tsp. of olive oil in a cast iron pan.  When finished I added the meat mixture to the peppers.  Soooooo delicious.. and easy.

I love how simple it is to make fajitas in a crock pot.  I used rotel tomato instead of tomato w/ garlic and onion. I left out the jalepeno peper, and added in some lime juice.  I used all red bell peppers instead of a mixture of green and red.  There were no leftovers.  I used the "Tortilla I" recipe as well instead of store bought tortilas

I enjoyed this more than I thought I was going to.  I followed the recipe forthe most part.  I added a can of mild Rotell tomatoes and chilles along with a can of petite diced tomatoes. (made LOTS of juice tho')  I also sautaed my onions & peppers separately in a pan with olive oil and lime juice so they would have a little crunch. I didn't do anything with the juice, I don't know how the "thickening" would be.  The meat was extremely tender and had a fantastic "authentic" Mexican flavor. I will make this again for a big group of family I think.

I almost doubled the spice amounts and I didn't put in the canned tomatoes, I thought it would be too liquidy.  I did not use the corn starch for thickening either.  I did added a small jar of salsa though.  I only cooked mine for about 4 hours and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe with a pound and a half of CHICKEN instead of beef. Slow cooked on low for 2 1/2 hours and was done. Very good. Also cooked some peppers and onions in a skillet for added crunch.

We liked this dish but I think the cook time is too long, because the meat fell apart.  I will make it again, but will add the peppers and onions earlier, so that the total cook time is 7 hours.

Wonderful flavor!  The leftovers make great tacos or enchiladas the next day, too.  This beef is very tender, though.  Not the recipe you are looking for if you want crispy meat. I really like recipes that can be made ahead for entertaining.

I really liked this recipe. I changed a few things though. I doubled the recipe as I had 3 lbs of thin top round I needed to use. I used 1 can medium rotel tomatoes, 1 can garlic onion tomatoes, yellow and orange peppers and omitted the jalepenos. It made a lot.

Easy.  And most of the family ate it, which is a huge success here.  I used rotel with lime and cilantro for the tomatoes and skipped the jalapeno due to kids' palates.  Total cook time was about 5 hours on low and 1 hour on high.  Did the peppers and onions separately on the stove.  Served with cheese, good salsa (fresh from Trader Joe's), and sour cream.  My husband and I thought they were really good, and 3 of our 4 kids ate them.  One, but of course, insisted on a tortilla and nothing but cheese inside.  Her loss!

I had some sub-par steaks in the freezer and decided to try some for this recipe.  I grabbed what I think was a bone-in ribeye.  Trimmed the fat, and sliced in about 1/2 inch strips.  I didn't have all the seasonings the recipe called for, so I just used fajita seasoning (maybe 1/2 a packet), I left out the jalapeno, and added a can of rotel, and a dash of worsterschire (sp?), and it turned out wonderful!  I was very surprised!  I know I made a several changes to the recipe, but I don't think anything was major, and it turned out really good!

This was just awesome... though I did change it up quite a bit only because I didn't have everything on hand.  I omitted all the seasonings and just used taco seasoning like you would for tacos... I used salsa instead of tomatoes... I added the minced garlic... cooked on low for 6 hours then added the cilantro and onions and peppers let cook for another 1-2 hours.... I also didn't cut the meat before... we cut it after it was cooked and it literally just fell apart... it was a great big hit in our house... will definitely do it again and again :) Thanks for such a great recipe :)

4.5 stars is more like it.  These were very easy to make and very well received.  The steak was really tender.  I felt there may have been a tad too much chili powder, so next time I will try cutting back just a little.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing, Twila!

This didn't turn out well.  I read other reviews and saw people cut down cooking time and I did that but it was still a meat mess.  It was more like soup and the flavor was bland. I won't make this again.

The flavor was good, but definitely ended up being more like shredded beef burritos than fajitas.  Still it was easy and yummy.

MMMM so good. I only had about five hours so i only cooked the first stage for 4 hours and it turned out fine. I added a bit of liquid smoke and worchestershire in the begninning as well. It never really thickened up but was still sooo good. Nice way to make flank steak more tender.

I made this for the first time recently and it is very good! I'm still learning some tricks of the trade, so I tend to follow recipes to the "T" the first time I try them.  I'm going to make this again, and the only change I'm going to make is I am going to use some chunky mild salsa instead of the canned tomatoes (since I dont have canned tomatoes at the moment) and omit the jalapeno (since neither hubby or I like them). I loved that the meat was so very tender! I let everyone take the meat out of the crockpot (since my crockpot has a "warm" feature) and lay out the sour cream, cheese, guacamole, etc. etc. and let them build thier own fajitas.

I think this was a really great starting point with tons of flexibility. I added a cup and a half of beef stock because it smelled/looked too tomato-y for my taste. The flavor was otherwise great and very versatile! Even my in-laws liked it.

This was easy.  The meat is very tender, falling apart. The seasonings were okay.  I think fajita seasoning makes it taste much better which is how I usually make it.  This was easy, not the best flavor but easy.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used rotel for the can of tomatoes, and it added a nice amount of spice.  The meat was tender and had good flavor.  If I make these again I will probably just saute my veggies in a pan on there own after the meat is done cooking.  I put them in the crock pot the last two hours with the meat and I didn't care for the cosistency they turned out.  They were ok, but I like them cooked in a pan on the stove top better.  I served these fajitas with shredded pepper jack and sour cream on top.  We also had best-ever texas caviar on the side with tortilla chips.  The two recipes complimented one another nicely.

This was really good.  Based on other's suggestions, I just used a jar of salsa, plus the spices (coriander, cumin, chili powder).  I also skipped the thickening step.  I also sauted the peppers and onions separately.

Since it's just me eating these I had to modify this a bit.  I used only 1 lb. steak, half of three colored peppers and instead of the canned tomatoes and jalepeno I just used salsa.  I put everything in the slow cooker at once an the peppers and onions were tender and good, not too mushy for me.

Followed the recipe pretty closely.  It tasted ok, but not enough zip for my taste.  Needed a good salsa to go with it.  Also the meat just fell apart.  Ended up more like shredded beef than beef fajitas.

I had an "oops" with this recipe that turned out to be actually wonderful! I sliced the meat the wrong way...couldn't figure out what "across the grain" meant. I obviouslt did it wrong because my meat fell apart and shredded. But you know what? Instead of steak fajitas we had steak tacos! I followed this recipe as written (besides slicing it wrong!) and it is absolutely delicious!!! The meat is so tender and the spices are right on the money. Thanks so much for this one!!!

These turned out even better than I expected! I added some corn and lime juice and it really added to the dish. Next time I make it, I'll use a little more cornstarch because it came out on the watery side. The leftovers make a great chili starter, too!

According to my family, this was very good. I used extremely rare leftover london broil for this recipe so my cooking time was only two hours on high. We don't care for cilantro, so I left that out as well as the coriander. The sauce thickened up perfectly with the cornstarch. Thank you Twila!

I didn't have a can of tomatoes so I used 4 oz of v8 and about 1 cup of fresh salsa (the kind from the refrigerated case, I used Trader Joe's but any would work). I used a pre-packaged Southwest seasoning blend and a little Cajun seasoning too. Beef texture was just right after 6-7 hours on low. Delicious!!

I was really excited to try fajitas in the slow cooker. I was not disappointed. They turned out great, and we had no left overs. I did cook the peppers and onions in a skillet on the stove because I like them a bit more crisp. Thanks Twila for a great recipe.

These were easy and awesome.  I prepped everything the night before.  I replaced the jalapeno w/ one 4-ounce can of diced green chilies, simply because I already had it.  My family, including my 13 month-old, loved these fajitas!  Yum.

I used thinly sliced sirloin steak and it was ready in 2 hours! Also, I sauteed and served the onions and peppers separately. The cilantro is a MUST!!!

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with excess red bell peppers so I substituted a second red pepper for the green pepper. I left out the jalapeno and the coriander because I didn't have them. I doubled the chili powder and cilantro and tripled the garlic to make up for the lack or coriander. I used corn tortillas instead of  flour. It was SO TASTY that I forgot to put the salsa on!

This was Delicious!! I made a few changes based on other reviews; I used fresh salsa instead of tomatoes, used juice from one lime, doubled spices, and cooked for 5 hours. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out amazing. My husband came home from work and said he could smell it from outside the house!! I will definatly make this again.

I used your great comments and this turned out great! I doubled recipe and used trip tip, (not sure I would use that cut again, there was alot of grease in the crock pot). Doubled seasonings, decreased cooking time to half and cooked on high for first 1.5 hrs. Also added juice of one lime, a couple shakes of worcestshire, and garlic. Also sauteed veggies in canola oil and added to crock pot 10 minutes before serving for a little crunch. Omitted cornstarch and water, consistency was perfect. Thanks for your comments, very helpful. Made this along with enchilada casserole for 50.

Turned out just like the recipe states - YUMMY! I think the can of tomatoes does make it runny. Maybe next time drain before use? Either way, family loved it. would definately make again.

I really liked this recipe.  My only complaint would be that the meat shrank so much!   I used rotella instead of tomatoes and onions and also used abt a TBS of lime juice.   Cooked at low for 5 hours on low (as per others suggestions) which was the perfect amount of time.   Next time I may try Sirloin instead of Flank steak, which I feel may not "shrink" up as much in the long run.

I gave it 3 stars for the flavor ...I just used salsa also ... Im feeding 5-7 at all times so flank steak is a very expensive cut of  meat when you consider it shredded completely and fell apart in the crock pot ....cook time is too long , and a slightly tougher cut of meat would be better for this recipe ....flavor was good though ...will try again

EDIT!!  ...Tried again with 2 sirloin steaks , added 1 jar of salsa to steak , sliced onion and sliced pepper ...again use fajita seasoning if you want it to taste like Fajitas ....after a few tries I figured out the problem for me with this recipe was the cut of meat should be a little fattier and the cook time in recipe is way too long ....after 5 hours the steak was still in strips but very close to being cooked to the point of shredding ...so Sirloin steaks and 5 hours makes it perfect for us ...

Came home all ready for fajitas and what was waiting for me was more like a goulash. The flavor was lacking and the meat did not hold up (7 hours is WAY too long for thinly sliced flank if you are cutting it properly) I added more items to increase the flavor such as more spice, lime juice, canned green chilis which helped. My husband mixed it with rice since it was more shredded beef than fajitas.

This is an awesome recipe, I too used salsa instead of the tomatoes and it turned out great. I didn't have a problem with my green peppers and onions getting too soggy. The house smells so good then this is in the crockpot, we never have leftovers with this dish!

I really liked the ease of the recipe. And, like others, I used Rotel for the tomatoes. If you're a fajita fan, however, you'll likely miss the carmelized flavor of grilled beef, onions and peppers. I'd also suggest more jalapenos for those who like spicy flavors.  When I reheated the leftovers I reheated them in the skillet and enjoyed it more.

Very nice. The meat was so tender that it shredded itself when I stirred it! I used a little more thickening agent then called for and it still was a little watery for the tortillas. No worries it was still very very tasty.

this tasted too much like swiss steak to me- I will add fewer peppers next time. I also like the idea of putting in salsa to give it more of a Mexican flavor. Also- the beef did get so overcooked that it broke apart and was just kind of sloppy- I may cook it a little less next time too.

I made these for a cinco de mayo party. The flavor was fantastic , from the other reviews I cooked them for 4.5 hours, and the steak fell apart a little bit too much for my liking. I didn't add the water and corn starch either because the crock pot was too full. I will still make them again.

These were good and they made an easy dinner even easier.  I used some rib steaks that we don't normally eat because they are too fatty and tough.  They turned out so tender and the flavor was good.  It did seem like the longer they cook the less spice there was so I had to add more seasonings close to the end.

Round steak (sliced thinly while semi-frozen) worked so well for me that I will use it instead of sirloin in the future as well. It stayed in slices and did not shred much. I cooked it 3 hours on HIGH, then added the peppers and onions and cooked an additional 2 hours on low. I think plenty of lime seasoning or juice is essential in this. Also, I will cook next time for a while without added ingredients, then *DRAIN* and add the tomatoes and seasonings, with lime. It was rather soupy...not terrible but I thought I could improve it... Definitely fills a fajita craving with a fraction of the work!!

I only had round steak in the house, so I used that. I forget how long I cooked it overall, but just kept it on until the meat was tender. Thank you for the recipe!

Similar taste to Qdoba if Spanish rice is added in the mix... Added hot red pepper flakes instead of buying the jap. pep.

Although very tasty, I think the cook times are off.  Mine came out shredded.

These were a hit!  Great combination of seasonings.  We also skipped the cornstarch step and just drained the juices off after cooking.  I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker and cooked for about 6 hours on high.  This was plenty of time.  Leftovers were tasty!  My husband even tried the filling on a roll with a little mayo and said it was fantastic.

These are great.  I found though it is much easier to use 3/4 of a jar of salsa though and no bell pepper. Everyone has loved them.

Really liked this! The flavor was very good. I didn't have the coriander, so I went without and didn't miss it I don't think.  I used some steaks I had in the freezer and cooked it for 5 hours on low and then added the veges for another 2 hours. Hubby really liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

These were definitely tender but the flavor was just okay. We were actually a bit disappointed. I stirred the meat and peppers together at the end and the meat just totally shredded into tiny pieces. Once we added our toppings to the fajita we couldn't really tell it was in there.

We've been spoiled with grilled steak fajita meat, but this is a great alternative when grilling isn't an option. I placed a whole frozen flank steak in the slow cooker for an hour on high to thaw, then sliced and returned, and turned to med-low for 5 hours. I left out the peppers, and used regular diced tomatoes. I also doubled the seasoning. The mix seemed dry, so I added 2oz of beef broth, but it wasn't needed since the tomatoes cook down. I didn't thicken the sauce since we didn't want soggy tortillas. DH thought the veggies were so good that he ate made himself an extra fajita with only veggies. A slow-cookin keeper!

This recipe is great! The meat came out very tender and had great flavor! I omitted the jalapeno, red pepper and ground corriander. I added lime juice and doubled the fresh cilantro. I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty!  To keep the calories down I opted to serve the meat & veggies over greens for a fajita salad.  I didn't use cheese or sour cream, however I made D's famous salsa from this site to add more flavor and spice. YUMMY!!!!

Totally enjoyed this recipe.  So easy!  Used diced tomatoes with chilis.  Also cooked.  Also precooked peppers/onions in pan with olive oil and fajita seasoning prior to putting in crockpot.  Was out of cornstarch so used 1T of flour instead.  Worked out fine.  Will make again!  Thanks!

I altered this recipe (due to lack of ingredients) and ended up with the BEST BEEF STEW. I took someone's suggestion of using Chunky Salsa, then added the spices per recipe. I did NOT use cornstarch or onions or green peppers (both are in chunky salsa). It made the most tender, flavorful beef stew. My five year old LOVED it and wanted it for lunch AND dinner the next day. DELICIOUS

I loved this recipe - good enough for company IMO.  I used many reviewers suggestions.  I used round steak, added a splash of worchestershire sauce, didn't use the juice from the tomato can, added some salsa, and did the onions and peppers in a skillet at the end to preserve some crunch.  Both the meat and the veggies got a sprinkle of fresh lime at the end.  Mine didn't get overcooked - the meat was half frozen when it went in, and the strips were a little thick.  Yummy, especially with No-fry Refried Beans from this site.

excellent! We did change it according to what others said-making the peppers/onions separately. And we did chicken and it was fantastic. I'm not one to change the recipe and then review and I apologize for that but you did a great job on this one! Thanks so much for sharing!

I skipped the jalapeno and used anaheim peppers instead.  I also prepared all the onions and red peppers separately  so they would be crunchy.  Came out great!  This is a good weeknight meal.

The taste of these was sooo good! I think I might have cooked in the crock pot a little long because they became kinda soupy. I'd make again!

Definitely a keeper!!! I use the half baked tortillas that you have to finish in a pan on the stove top. I have made this many times already. Oh, before I forget, I always put the pot in the fridge for a night and remove all the fat that floats to the top. It even tastes better when it sits for a day or two. Yum!

We had this when we had friends over for dinner one night and it was very good.  Everyone enjoyed them but like other reviewers, when I make it again, I will cut down the hours to be cooked because the flank steak fell to pieces.  Still tasted really good but if you want a little more to chew, it shouldn't be cooked that long.

The perfect way to make steak fajitas without worrying about the steak being tough. Came out very flavorful and tender. I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I just substituted jarred salsa.
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love the flavoring, but I didn't care for cooking these in the crockpot. I thought it was way too tender. Fajita's are supposed to be a little tougher. Like I said, the flavoring was great though. Probably will grill the meat next time.

I will definitely make this again; I used top sirloin (it was on sale) and it was delicious.  I followed a tip from another rater and added a can of Rotel with green chilis and liked this.  My son had "thirds" on this dish by the way (aged 17)... I will definitely make this again but mine was a little soupy - thinking next time I will completely drain the canned tomatoes - else I have considered adding canned corn and black beans and just call it fajita soup.

I thought this was too bland but my husband 
thought it was very good. 

I agree the cooking time is too long.
