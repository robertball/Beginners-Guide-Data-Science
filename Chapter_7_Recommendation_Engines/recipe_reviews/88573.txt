They say actions (or pictures) speak louder than words, so I invite you to take a peek at my submitted photo of this salad because it shows how much I enjoyed this salad far more accurately than any words could express.  On the rare occasions Hubs goes out of town on a business trip without me I look for a dinner to prepare for myself that is easily scaled to one serving, so main dish salads seem to work perfectly for me.  I sure do find some good ones, including this particular salad.   I made the salad itself just as written, no changes, no substitutions – the ingredients were all good choices that blended well together and I especially liked the addition of the avocado, which was SO delicious with the pistachio coated chicken.  But I did make some changes to how I prepared the chicken.  I couldn’t see the pistachios sticking very well to the chicken breast as the recipe was written so I first soaked the chicken in buttermilk, then coated it in a mixture of the finely chopped pistachios and panko bread crumbs.  Just as I suspected, the mixture coated the chicken thoroughly.  As for the dressing, I used some vinaigrette I had leftover from another recipe I tried recently, and it couldn’t have been a better choice for this salad.  I’m not typically a fan of “cold and crunchy” dinners but this one was a real winner with me that I’d happily make again in a heartbeat.

This was an excellent salad! Very filling and hearty :) I made it with baby spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, red peppers, avocado and made my own balsamic vinaigrette (3/4 extra virgin olive oil, 3/4 balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1-2 tsp mustard, 1 clove garlic, dash of salt and pepper).

One of the best salads  I've ever had! I have made it two times first time followed recipe exactly second time I flollowed other reviwers suggestions of adding bread crumbs to the pistachios and I liked it more when using only pistachios...I also soaked the chicken in buttermilk to tenderize it and to help pistachios stick better to the chicken.

I'm giving this 4 stars because while the salad was really good, I don't think the pistachio chicken lent a ton of flavor.  The pistachios seemed to get lost and burnt a little.  I even pounded my chicken out thin before cooking.  I like someone elses idea of simply toasting the pistachios and sprinkling them on the salad separately.  I made my own balsamic dressing as well.

Good choice of ingredients make this salad great.  The only reason I gave this three instead of five stars is the expense of the ingredients and the fact that my grocery store doesn't carry shelled pistachios.  With the expense and amount of work, I am not sure this recipe is a repeater for us.  I also don't see much flavor/texture gained by coating the chicken (a more labor intensive approach) vs.  just toasting and sprinkling with nuts afterwards. Also, if you don't flatten the chicken and/or fillet it, you'll burn the pistachios before the chicken is even close to done.

Five  + 1 *  !! Incredible salad!  I found the crushed pistachios adhered extremely well to the chicken.  This meal was just what one needs in a pinch for something that can be put together rather quickly.  We all enjoyed this very much!

Loved this salad! I left out the bell pepper because we don't like it, and I made my own vinaigrette, but didn't change anything else. Very good, simple to make and quite filling. Will definitely be on our summer rotation. Thanks for sharing!

This is a delicious salad.  I didn't have a ripe avocado, so had to skip that, but it was still outstanding!  My husband loved the pistachio encrusted chicken!  This is a great warm weather dinner that we will be having again!

This was very good!  Hubs and I both enjoyed it.  I was a little shy on pistachios after shelling them, so I added a little panko to make up the difference.  I dipped the chicken in beaten egg so the ground pistachios/panko would adhere better, which worked out well.  I used mixed greens and skipped the avocado, because I didn’t have one.  I cooked my chicken over medium heat the entire time and didn’t have any problems with burning.  I made Maple-Balsamic Vinaigrette, also from this site, and it was an excellent choice!  For some reason, we didn’t get a lot of pistachio flavor, so next time I think I’ll try pecans.

Very yummy!  Made this exactly as in.  Forgot the parmesan but I doubt it would have made much of a difference.  Between the pistachio chicken, green onions, avacado, tomatoes, peppers and dress, every bite seemed to have a new taste.  A lot of flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Recommend adding salt to the chicken to suit your tastes while cooking. We made a homemade balsamic vinnaigrette which is another recommendation!

Delicious!!  My husband & daughter loved it and so did I.  This is perfect for hot Summer days when you don't want to slave for hours over the stove, plus it's extremely healthy.  I used a berry balsamic dressing and the salad became a definite family favorite.

Absolutely delightful medley of flavors & textures. I skinned & de-boned thighs (much prefer the dark meat). Rather than balsamic salad dressing, I used a quality balsamic vinegar, roughly 1/2 cup and mixed in about 1/2 tsp finely minced fresh garlic per serving to give it a bit more zing (and we do love garlic here!). Be sure to use a good quality balsamic - it is important to the final dish. I also used finely shredded fresh Parmesan. No leftovers and the bowls were all but lapped clean. My discriminating bride gave it an enthusiastic 5 stars. 

Thanks for sharing - this is one *outstanding* recipe.

It was good, but neither my husband or I could really taste the pistachio on the chicken. I think if I repeated this one I would use any old nut that was cheaper. You could even just use bread crumbs, because it didn't taste too different from bread crumbs. I also would use a lot less olive oil, maybe half. The chicken was kinda oily, which, when you're trying to make a healthy spinach salad, is not too satisfying.

I made this salad today for dinner, and it came out very well. The only thing I omitted was avacado, because I do not like it, but the salad was still very good. I did put my chicken in an egg wash because I wasn't sure if the pistachios were going to stick, and they stuck very well. I cut the chicken thin and had no problems  with the pistachios getting too brown as another reviewer noted. The chicken was perfect, my husband and I really enjoyed it. This would be a perfect light summer lunch or dinner.

I didn't have any pistachios so I used chopped up roasted peanuts instead and it tastes great. I also added iceberg lettuce beauce I felt it needed the extra greens. My husband also loved it.

Used this recipe as a guideline substituting what I had on hand (no pistachios, used peanuts mixed with Panko; no green onion - left it out).  Was still delicious.  Looking forward to trying it with pistachio's.   Will use this for a main course meal again.  Full flavor and took very little time to make.  2 thumbs up from all family members.  Thank you for sharing.

The pistachios on the chicken did not add any noticeable flavor - just expense.  So disappointed. Luckily the chicken was still quite edible, just not flavorful.  The rest of the salad ingredients are great.

I improvised a lot, because I didn't have some ingredients. But I liked the pistachio nuts on the chicken. I also used the Maple Balsamic dressing from this site. It goes great with this salad.
I will make both again!

Very easy and tasty.  I make grilled chicken salad frequently, but the pistachios are a very nice flavor and texture.

My husband & I loved this salad.  I used a balsamic vinaigrette.  The only negative was that I probably "chopped" the pistachios in the food processor too long and they were too fine.  When I pan-fried the chicken, the pistachios burned.  I think next time I will hand chop the pistachios, and maybe toast them and sprinkle them on top of the chicken breasts after cooking.

Turned out fine, but I used almonds in place of the pasta

I ended up with cooked pistachios and some undercooked, under seasoned chicken.

Delicious and very filling salad. I couldn't find shelled pistachios at the grocery store and didn't want to spend the time shelling them so I used pecans instead. They adhered quite well to the chicken during the cooking process. I used a Maple Balsamic dressing from this site and it was a good compliment to the salad. I will definitely make this again!

It was good.  I used Panera balsamic vinaigrette.  Like other people said it would be a good idea to soak the chicken in buttermilk and add bread crumbs to help keep the pistachio crust from coming off the chicken.

I didn't have pistachios on hand so I used Panko crumbs. They stuck just fine to the chicken when the crumbs were crushed up finally. I have made this 3 times already. Can't wait to try with the pistachios next. I used both spinach and mixed greens. Normally I'm not a huge salad fan, or even if I really like a salad, I can't eat that much of it. There is something about this whole combo that I absolutely love - ate the entire plate each time. Love this recipe!!!

The pistachio coating is super yummy!  I used romaine lettuce instead of spinach 'cause that's what I had on hand, and it was still excellent.

This was a very good main dish salad and quite simple to make.  I used homemade balsamic dressing and skipped the parmesan cheese, since I was out.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Sara!

WOW!  I actually made a new recipe!  This chicken was so tender and delicious.  It was very easy and what made it really great was that we are 30 miles away from a pistachio farm that features flavored pistachios such as: garlic, jalapeno, hickory mesquite, haberno, chili lime.  So you can have 5 different variations.  Check out Fistiki Farms in Cochise County.  You Won't Be Disappointed!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!  Even my kids enjoyed this.  I was suprised, even the pistachios sticked well to the chicken.  Found out, don't have the heat to high or the outsides of the chicken will over cook before the insides get done.  What a wonderful taste mix!
