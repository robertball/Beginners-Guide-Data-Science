This is a good, basic recipe.  Please don't let the blood turn you off.  Recipe like this were created to prevent wasting any part of the chicken.  I cooked the rice in chicken stock instead of water.  To my fellow reviewers; maybe you could post something constructive. I don't understand how "I did not care for this recipe at all" could possibly to be rated "helpful"

This recipe was excellent! I made a few minor tweaks: 3 cloves garlic, jasmine rice, cabernet sauvignon wine, and instead of hot pepper sauce (I didn't know what kind to use), added a bit of hungarian paprika and cayenne pepper. With chicken, this was excellent. I can imagine this working well for rabbit, pork, squab, squirrel, or other medium bodied meats. Two notes: 1. I have noticed from cooking this and blood sausages, that blood responds poorly to being cooked in cast iron. I would recommend any chefs trying this recipe use stainless steel or another inert cooking surface. 2.) My fresh blood had separated overnight, but I was able to homogenize it by slowly pouring boiling water over the mass and pushing it through a strainer. I will make this with fresh blood next time to obviate this step.
