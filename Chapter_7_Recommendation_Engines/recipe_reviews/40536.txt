I cannot tell a lie, I really like the flavor of beef with olives and tomatoes, but I found this to be FAR too salty. I probably could have guessed how it would taste, but I was still a little surprised at how hard it was to get past the saltiness, despite really liking the flavor otherwise.

Extremely easy and very tasty.  I noticed several ratings said this recipe needed a little extra something.  I added a pepper spice blend which really increased the flavor combination of the beef and olives.

Easy for a day when you're going to be out all day.  I found that rinsing the olives takes away much of the saltiness.  It's a good fall-back recipe when time is short for prep and you need something when you get home.

I put this in the crock pot on a day when I was working late. When I got home, there was nothing left but little pieces. It was very good and tender. The sauce was very flavorful and I DO recommend that you serve it with hard rolls.

Fantastic! I wasn't too sure how I was going to like this recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised. Full of flavor, but not at all overwhelming. I did use one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes, as that's what I had on hand. Also, I was in a hurry so I just dumped the olives in without chopping them. I served it on toasted kaiser rolls with mozzarella cheese on top. Yum! Thanks :)

Soooo easy!  And yummy!  I've made this several times, and served it over brown rice.  The kids like it because it doesn't have too many vegetables.

Lovely. I was wondering why the Kaiser rolls, now I know. Very juicy. My piece of meat was a bit dry, next time I'll get proper chuck or something more fatty. I browned the meat in a skillet first, and put black pepper on it.

Not as good as I had hoped it would be.  I love olives, but found this to be overpowering.

I thought this was excellent. It had a very unique flavor. My husband loved it as well. We served it over pasta instead of on kaiser rolls. It was so easy. I followed the directions. I was concerned about not browning the meat, but it came out tender and tasty.

I did add an onion and a couple tablespoons of red wine, this would have been really good with a different roast, chuck roast just has too many fatty pieces for my taste.  That being said the broth was absolutly fantastic, and it could not have been easier to make.  I recomend doing it on high for 6 hours not low although that could just be my machine.

So easy and delicious! I added a few cloves of garlic. I substituted diced tomatoes + italian seasoning for stewed tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand. I didn't add any of the olive liquid, since other reviewers said it was too salty. There was still plenty of olive flavor without being too salty, and it still made lots of yummy sauce. The olives play a big role, so get good ones!

It was good but it didn't knock our socks off. I will try it again however because I did deviate a bit from the recipe by using london Broil  instead of chuck. It took 8 hrs. as opposed to 6 . The chuck has more fat in it and would probably be more flavorful. Maybe a little garlic too.

Mu husband, who is not a fan of pot roast, LOVED this stuff!  He exclaimed over and over, "This is GOOD. This is REALLY GOOD."  Kids loved it too.  I thought it could have used a little jazzing up (not sure what I'd jazz it up with), but since it was such a hit with the family, I'm giving it 5 stars. Thanks!
