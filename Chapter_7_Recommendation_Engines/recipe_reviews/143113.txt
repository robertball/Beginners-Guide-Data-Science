I made this as part of a birthday dinner for my vegetarian son.  I had never made or ate falafel before but judging from the responses I got from my son & his friends who eat them regularly, I guess they turned out pretty good.  I used greek yogurt instead of imitation sourcream (my son's not vegan) and also added in an egg to help hold them together better.  I needed to double the recipe but only had one can of garbanzo beans so I used a can of great northern beans as a substitute for the 2nd can and that worked ok. I found I needed to added way more cornmeal than the recipe called for in order to form the batter into formable cakes. I'd definitely make them again for my son.  He really liked them and I am always looking for a vegetartian dish to make for him and this worked well.

This was pretty good. We put them in wheat pita pockets with a dollop of sour cream and dipped them in a little honey.

The flavor was great, but I had a little trouble getting the cakes to stay together.  Regardless, they were a hit with both my husband and my two year old.

I ran out of cornmeal, so didn't coat the burgers.  They cooked up just fine!  Great taste! We'll be making these again soon!

I like the fact that this recipe uses no flour or bread crumbs, so it's gluten-free.  It was not the best falafel I ever had.  My husband and I liked it ok, but my kids did not.  I may try tweeking it a little before searching for another recipe.  Egg would definitely help hold it together, I think.

I used greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I didn't have any hot pepper sauce so I just used crushed red pepper for  a little favor.   They cooked up great and didn't fall a part.

Didn't like the spice combination with the cornmeal.  In Egypt we also don't use chickpeas in our falafel (which we call taameya).  Instead we use fava beans alone.  Don't know how this can be considered Egyptian, it's absolutely the furthest thing from it!

I love this recipe, it so easy and tastes very good.  I used an egg instead of sour cream like the other rater suggested and I used  hot garlic chili asian sauce instead of hot sauce.  Also I didn't use coriander.  I added one TBSP of dried parlsey
