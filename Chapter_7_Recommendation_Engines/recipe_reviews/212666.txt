I loved this recipe and so did the entire family! The only ingredient I didn't use was the mushrooms. I used my NuWare Pro and the duck came out perfect! Thanks for sharing!

I loved it, but the kids not so much, but it was the first time they had duck, and the first time I ever cooked it. It was really easy, and I thought the flavor was great, I used fresh mushrooms and half an orange inside the cavity, and used some of the extra sauce in a rice and vegetable dish that accompanied it.

Really good duck recipe!  This is my favorite as well as my Mom's.  Sauce has great flavor that goes really well with the duck.  Will definitely make again!

I made this today and the family really enjoyed it, even my 4-yr old! To make it extra tender, I brined it for a day (water, brown sugar, salt). I also added rosemary and sage in the roasting pan for the aroma. I'll definitely be making this again! :)

Made this for New Year's Eve and it was incredible! A big hit with everyone. Not too hard to make, flavor was not overpowering, and made the duck so tender and juicy! Recipe did not specify covering the roasting pan, but we did until the last 20 minutes. The golden appearance of the bird was beautiful!

This was my first time cooking Duck, served it Thanksgiving, followed recipe as given. WOW..everyone raved on the tenderness, the flavor and I loved the ingredients used to baste during cooking. Glad I made two ducks so we had leftovers for the evening munchies. No one mentioned Trussing the duck, glad I did research on other sites, this was important.

This was easy and pretty good, but one of the orange aspects held an unpleasant note for me.
