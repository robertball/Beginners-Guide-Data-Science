Very, very good. Instead of water, I used apple cider and I used whole milk. The whole family devoured this. Quite the nice breakfast to wake up to, smelling all wonderful and cheery. I'll make this again. NOTE: I used a steel cut oatmeal for this recipe. Very important to know that you'll get different results if you use a different type. Next time, I'll add the nuts right before serving, so it dosen't get all cooked in with the oatmeal. I'd like a little crunch. I should clarify, I used the "warm" setting on my Crockpot. Mine's an old 70's version that has one of those. I didn't have any issue with mine burning. I do go to bed really late so mine probably went into the crockpot closer to midnight so mine wasn't cooking any longer than six hours.

I've used a similar recipe many, many times.  First time it burnt to the pot. My basic-as-be Crock Pot tends to run hot, so I use tried the Keep Warm setting.  Also, lay a dishtowel over the pot before you out the lid on to absorb condensation and keep it from dripping back in to make oatmeal "soggy mush".  You will be pleasantly surprised in the AM.

After making many, many dishes from this wonderful website, this is my first total failure.  I even read other reviews first for slow cooker oatmeal, and was forewarned about it turning to mush and burning the crock pot.  I sprayed the crock with Pam, and being the eternal optimist, I thought that would not happen to me...  :(   No such luck.  I do have a crock pot that runs "hot."  One reviewer said hers was the same and she cooked it on the "warm" setting.  I should have listened.  I will try this again, but during the day when I am awake to monitor it. Well, off to scrub my crock pot...

The number of negative reviews makes me suspect some user error because my turned out perfect.  No one has mentioned 'steel cut oats' which are VERY different from whole oats or quick oats and likely part of the issue with those who had failures.  Additionally, you SHOULD NOT be checking it.  It's important that the water remains IN the pot not being lost to the air or a towel!  That is why you can use a lesser amount of water than what is called for on the package.  Once you put the ingredients in the slow cooker, it is a good idea to stir everything but if the instructions are followed and the ingredients are correct and the crockpot isn't faulty (and it's set on low) - this should be impossible to mess up.

I liked this a lot. The fruit made it naturally sweet and yummy. I did add about 3 extra cups of liquid, as I noticed the steel cut oats package called for over a 3 to 1 ratio, vs. the 2 to 1 in this recipe. It cooked overnight for 8.5 hours, and no burning.

Excellent!  Followed recipe exactly, and it actually ended up cooking for nearly 9 hours at which time it seemed like it was just about to start burning, so in the future I'll make sure to check it before then.  Flavor and texture are both great, and I look forward to trying it with other dried fruits!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was super easy!  I did not know you could cook oatmeal in a crockpot.  Did leave the setting on warm since I read it may burn, turned out perfect in 8 hours.  Delicious, & can use whatever you have on hand for the extras.  Thank you!!

I also had the issue that a previous reviewer mentioned and when I woke up after exactly eight hours I was disappointed to find that the recipe had burned to the pot.  I own a totally standard, no frills, Crock Pot brand pot but I use it regularly for recipes on this site with very good results.  Despite the burning, I was able to salvage about 50% of the oatmeal.  It didn't taste "burned" and what remained was tasty, if not exceptional.  I may try this recipe again but I'll wait to see what other reviewers have to say in coming weeks.

i was really excited to try this recipe! i made it for a staff meeting breakfast at work and it went over really well.  so make sure you are using steel cut oats-you can't buy them at many mainstream grocery stores, you need to go to a whole foods or wegmans (or whatever natural food grocery store is near you).  this is critical to avoid mushy or burned oatmeal.  i also increased the milk by 1c.  i added my nuts at the end which gave it a nice texture and crunch, but if you prefer just the flavor of the nuts and don't want them crunchy, then i'd follow recipe.  if i were to make this again i would definitely cut my apples smaller - they weren't quite mushy enough for me and i picked most of mine out when i was eating it.  i did significantly increase the cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice (doubled, at least).  i also added about a cup of brown sugar in the morning, as it was far too bland for my taste.  as i read other reviews i had debated about what heat to cook it at because my slow cooker is a beast...but i was afraid about it being undercooked if i only put it on warm (and i figured i could buy something else in the AM if i needed to if it burned!) so i did it on low and it was fine!  the extra liquid helped i think, & it was not burned or dried out.  wow this is a long review but i hope it helps someone!  dont' be scared of this recipe by its so-so reviews!

I hate to give a recipe only one star, but this was truly awful for me. After reading the other reviews, I put it on low for an hour or so and then put it on warm right before I went to bed. After exactly 8 hours of cooking it was slightly burnt and tasted unappetizing.  I wouldn't recommend trying this recipe.

I make my "steel cut" oatmeal like this all the time. Remember this is for "steel cut" oatmeal. Usually you need to buy that at a health food store or a food coop. It is a nutty grain oatmeal and it very different than regular oatmeal. It is very nutritious for you and if you cook this recipe with that kind, this recipe works. I did find that the amount of liquid in the recipe needs to be almost doubled. This is a nice basic slow cooker recipe but when you add apples, it makes applesauce also which will make it mushy as some have stated. I usually do not make my oatmeal with apples but with lots of different dried fruits and nuts. I also like to add my nuts in when the oatmeal is cooked and not during. I made this adding 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin and used raisins with that. I always make this during the day and not over night and then you can check on the consistency. I make a big batch like this on weekends and then I eat it all week long for a quick healthy breakfast before going to work. I cook on low and start with boiling hot water in my slow cooker and then it only takes a couple of hours to cook and you do not have to worry about it boiling over on the stove and stirring a lot. I spray the cooker with Pam and stir mine 3-4 times while cooking. If you have not tried the slow cooker for "steel cut" oatmeal, you will enjoy making it this way. Remember to only use "steel cut" though.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It was mushy and cooked much too long by the instructions. I agree that if it is a crock pot recipe, you shouldn't have to spend time checking the cooking.   The ingredients are too costly to end up with this final product.  I won't be doing this one again.

I wondered how people were cooking their oatmeal in a big slowcooker and finally found the one piece of info that many people were missing. Use the slowcooker like a bain-marie (water bath)! Inside my slowcooker I put a crock of some type (I use a corningwear pot or a 4 cup pyrex measuring cup). I put all of the oatmeal and water/milk per the recipe into the corningwear pot and then add water to the crockpot AROUND the corningwear pot to about halfway up the side of the corning wear pot. I don't put a lid on the corningwear pot. I put the lid on the slowcooker and put it on low overnight which for me is usually about 6 or 7 hours. In the morning the oatmeal is perfect and just needs a stir. Nothing has ever been stuck to the corningwear pot and because I didn't put the oatmeal into the slow cooker itself I don't have to clean the slowcooker. I just empty the water and wipe it dry.

This turned out pretty well.  I only cooked it for six hours, and it was the perfect consistency, but my slow cooker does run hot, so I was expecting that.  I had pretty tart apples, so I did add some brown sugar, and I waited to add the nuts until it was time to eat so they wouldn't lose their crunch.  You could really alter the fruits, nuts, and spices in this to get a different taste every time.  I will be making this more as winter sets in.

Recipe is great as a base.  So versatile!  I did this during the day as I was not sure how it would behave in the crock pot.  I am SO glad I did!  There was not enough liquid and I had to add more, lots more.  I added another cup of soy milk and at least another 1/2 cup  of water.  It also cooked in 6 hours not 8.  Next time I make this I will not put the cranberries in at the start but wait until the last 1/2 hour or so as they loose their texture and sweetness as I like them.  You may prefer the reconstituted berries in yours.  I did add some Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar free maple syrup as I do like it sweet!  Also had about 1/2 cup apple sauce I threw in to use up.  I will omit the butter as the fat is really unnecessary and added nothing to the flavor IMO.

This is very delicious!  Try using your crockpot as a double boiler.  Place all your ingredients into a heat safe bowl that fits into your crockpot and then pour water into your actual crockpot bowl until it reaches the contents inside the inner bowl.  This makes cleaning simple!! :)

After purchasing a Costco sized bag of steel cut oats, I searched AR for recipes and I came across this recipe.  Delicious!  Made this in my Zojirushi rice cooker as written on the porridge setting, no problem with burning and it was done in about 45 min. I added the oats and liquids to the pot to let the oats soften while I chopped apples and nuts.  It is a little loose when you first open the cooker, but tightens up after sitting in the bowl for a few minutes. Also good because it will keep in the cooker for 2 or 3 days (if it lasts that long).

This oatmeal is really good! My sister and I put it in our in-a-jar baskets for Christmas, with an instructional tag. We, obviously, had to make some changes. Because we made so much, we put whatever nuts we found on sale (mostly wallnuts) and they were fine whatever way. We also put less of them, about 1/2 c. and that was enough. I also took the apples and dehydrated them by soaking them in a mixture of 1/4 c lemon juice and 1 quart of water to prevent them from browning. That took about 4-5 hours at 145*. This way the apples were preserved. We also used about a 1/2 c of those also; they plump back up just like the cranberries. Speaking of cranberries, we cut those back to about 3/4 c. I made this in a crockpot first with these changes, to make sure it tasted good, and it did. I think it had too much cinnamon so we cut it back to 2 teaspoons for the baskets and it was still very good. I think the pumpkin pie spice has cinnamon in it also so we weren't missing out. It started to get a little dry and burn by morning, so I think adding more water would help. This morning I made it on the stove and it only took a few minutes. I will definitely be making this again. I think I will assemble and mix the ingredients and store them for quick and easy access. Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED this recipe. Have to admit, I have never liked oatmeal, hate the mushy texture and lack of flavor. This recipe is full of so much good 'stuff'. I used a mix of dried cherries, blueberries and strawberries, added flax seeds and meusli. Topped with brown sugar and milk, was to die for. Followed directions to a T, cooked on warm for 8-8.5 hrs Thanks for sharing, its a keeper!!

This is very good! Here's my modifications: I sprayed my slow cooker first and used only 1 cup of oats and 3 cups of water(no milk or butter). I put in the apples and cinnamon and turned it on warm overnight. In the morning I added the craisins and nuts and then turned it off after about half an hour to let it thicken. I had none stuck to the side! We add hot milk and a little maple syrup to it in our bowls.

I'm giving this four stars because even though there are some problems with this oatmeal as written, the idea and basic recipe are great. However, I had to use LOTS more liquid. I checked it just a couple of hours into the cooking time and it was already turning into an oatmeal cake! A quick internet search let me know that the ratio of oats to liquid should have been more like 1:3 or even 1:4. Also, I put my slow cooker on the "Keep Warm" setting and it was still a bit too done, i.e., the oats and fruit were a bit too mushy. I didn't use any nuts either, as I did not think I would care for them after cooking in liquid so long. I left out the butter, too, because I just felt it was unneeded. I had already given my crock a quick coat of cooking oil spray to keep the oatmeal from sticking. On the upside, with these adjustments and because it's so very good for us, I liked this and I will make it again. Thanks!

cooked in microwave for 3 minutes. Amazing. I eat a variation of this every morning. Just prep the night before and it's ready to zap in the AM

I think all the low ratings are due to the fact that they used the wrong Oatmeal, You MUST use STEEL CUT OATS!! Sometimes called Irish oats, or Scotch oats. They are gluten free so the oatmeal should not turn to mush or burn. I sometimes use just apples and cinnamon, or chopped apricots and almonds, the possibilities are endless. Great recipe!

Love this recipe! I subbed in frozen berries for the apples and only cook about 5 to 6 hours to avoid it sticking really badly to the pot. Love it :)

Made this recipe the other night; turned out very good.  In reading the other reviews about not taking 8 hrs.; I got this started late, at 1:15 a.m. and checked it at 7:15 a.m. and it was perfect at that time.  Next time, I will add at least 1/2 c. more of liquid so the leftovers aren't so "stiff & thick".

There was a lot of flavor in this dish, however there was too many almonds for my taste, I think I will use less next time with maybe some crushed walnuts. I do think there should be some nutty flavor mixed it it. I didn't care for the slivers. The texture wasn't right for me. I also have to agree with another poster about adding the nuts later on cause they get cooked with the oatmeal.
I also might do as one poster suggested and replace water with apple cider, that sounded scrumptious, but what I might do is use less of that though with more milk for creaminess. 
I also thought of adding maybe chopped up pineapple to the mix, and someone one time instead of apples to use peaches or pares, but wouldn't add the peaches until the end.
It did come out mushy, so next time I will do as other posters did and try it on my Warm setting. Also mine was done hours before I got up, I could tell. I got to it in the 7th hour, and realized it was probably done 2 hours prior. Mine did burn as did many others.
You can find a picture of my final result in the photo line up with the rest of the pictures.

The ingredients certainly have potential.  I tried the same as others to check it and put it on warm versus low to make sure it didn't burn.  It still did.  The taste was also very bland and I am not one to add sugar but I did.

YUMMY!!I make this for all my picky eaters with a Tbl of brown sugar and a drizzle of maple syrup on top(stevia for me). It's cheap, smells and tastes wonderful. Add 3 extra cups water and cover crockpot with a towel so you won't have to worry about burning or sticking to the sides.

Great breakfast!  I make it on Sunday afternoon so it's all done for the week.  By trial and error, I used steel cut oatmeal and I would recommend  the liquid to oats ratio be 4 to 1, so I use 1 1/2 cups oats, 2 cups milk, 4 cups apple juice and cook it in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours.  When I did overnight, the oats soaked up near all the liquid and it was getting a 'skin' on top.   Great breakfast, thanks for sharing!

The entire family loved it! I added three CUPS of non-fat milk in addition to the water called out in the recipe. I also added four tablespoons of butter and brown sugar. It was flavorful, tastey and hardy. I cooked it for 8 hours on low in my crockpot. Next time I will add a little more water since I like my hot cereal to be thinner.

This was very good, but I made some changes. 2 cups milk and 2 cups water to make it creamier. I used all almonds (1 cup) because I didn't have pecans.  I doubled the spices and added a tablespoon of Splenda brown sugar blend.  I cooked it on "warm" and sprayed the crockpot with Pam before adding anything. I used raisins instead of cranberries. It was nice to wake up to breakfast already made, but it was a little bland, even with doubling the spices.  I added more butter and brown sugar, as another reviewer suggested, and it was perfect. Delicious and healthy, even with the additions!

I didn't have any apples but used a fruit and nut mix I had gotten at the healthfood store. Cooked overnight on warm because I knew low would be too high. Turned on low for one hour when I got up. Added a little milk and brown sugar and it was pretty good.

I followed your reciped with minor changes.  I used raisins in place of cranberry and soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) and I did use steel cut oats.  It smelled wonderful in the morning, but something was missing.  My kids ate something else. I have never used steel cut oats before and I will probably not use this recipe again.  Thanks anyway.

Loved this oatmeal!!  I did use 4 cups water and only cooked 7 hours.  No burning.  I added nuts at the end.  Very healthy and a great way to start off the day.

I prepared this last night with really good results. Completely paranoid by all the negative ratings here indicating it would burn on "Low", I forced myself to leave it alone all night, on the instructed "Low" and was pleasantly surprised to see it didn't burn at all. The flavor and texture was nice, and the description of the dish does indicate to serve with milk and brown sugar, which definitely helps. I didn't give it more stars because I didn't like the color of the oatmeal. It was a dark brown, due to the spices and cinnamon, and that made it look very unappealing. Aside from that however, this was a very easy and flavorful recipe, and the oatmeal itself was quite hearty and delicious. Glad I tried it but I don't know that I'll be making it again.

Is putting zero stars an option?  I followed the directions exactly (which I guess was my big mistake) and when I woke up this morning it was a congealed, burned mess!  Now that I am reading the reviews, I realize there were some things that needed to be changed; such as decreasing the heat to "warm" instead of "low" and adding a lot more liquid.  Still, it is incredibly frustrating to me that a recipe with a rating of almost 4 stars just plain DOESN'T WORK unless you modify it in very significant ways.  I was very disappointed by this recipe and will not attempt it again, even with the sage advice of the other posters.

I made this last night. Put it in crock pot on warm around 10pm. The only thing I did differently was add a pinch of salt and didnt add the nuts. I was up at 5 this morning and it looked like it needed a lot more liquid. I added a few more cups of milk..like half of my half gallon..lol. It was starting to stick to sides and bottom, but not really bad. I kept it on warm while I got some things done. Wasnt burnt and smelled wonderful! I ate it around 630 and it was good :)  Even my 2 year old was eating it, and he NEVER eats oatmeal! 
Like I said it was sticking but I scraped it all down and mixed it together and it was fine.

This turned out great! HOWEVER make sure your slow cooker is on WARM, not Low. Had I left it any longer it would have burned even on WARM. Otherwise it was fabulous!

This steel-cut oats recipe has quickly become a new favorite in my diet. It's great as is but you can easily make substitions; I use 2 cups almond milk and 2 cups water. I also add a few handfuls of dry blueberries for extra fruit flavor. 

Serve with a drizzle of maple syrup -- or you can also serve it with approx 1/4 cup apple sauce - my personal favorite :).  

It freezes very well so you can prepare a large quantity in advance and freeze it in individual portions for quick and nutritious breakfasts when you are pressed for time. Just take out of the freezer the night before and reheat in the morning - and voila! 

The only advice I have for anyone attempting this recipe for the first time is to closely monitor your cooking progress. My crockpot cooks it perfectly after only 4 hours on the low setting.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe! Delicious!

I tried this last night.  You MUST use steel cuts oats! Also, my crock pot runs 180deg.  There is a WARM setting to reheat cooked foods... this is the setting I used.  I added canned pumpkin instead of the apples.  Also, chopped dried apricots & prunes.  I forgot to spray with Pam, so after combining the ingredients & sprayed the sides & stirred.  After 8 hours + it wasn't creamy, but after adding milk it was great!  I'll  make this again switching  up the fruit.. thanks Julie

Very healthy, however, I found it a bit too sweet for my taste and it was slimy for lack of a better word.  Must be how I cooked it, but I don't know to prevent it from being a consistency I don't care for.

This was great!  The fruit makes it sweet with no added sugar.  I read the comments and started it at 11PM on low.  Got up at 5:30AM to check on it and it was too dry so I added 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of water.  By 7AM, I stirred in the nuts and  it was perfect!   Will definately make this again.

what an amazing way to wake up for a busy saturday filled with kids soccer. i upped my liquids to a total of 6 cups of liquid. (4 water and 2 milk) i kept the nuts in large pieces and they stayed slightly crunchy. the low setting for 8-9 hours was perfect. there was a slight bit baked onto the sides, but a small price to pay. a quick soak with dishwasher powder and it is all gone.

Loved this! Only had rolled oats so used those... no pumpkin spice handy, so I added nutmeg. Doubled the cinnamon, added prunes, left out the pecans. Also added brown sugar and a little more milk. I cooked on warM for 5 hours (after reading reviews). Cut the apples in 1/2" pieces which kept them intact. My husband raved! No issues with burning whatsoever.  Big enough batch for breakfast for a week.

Make a double boiler out of your crock pot.  Put the mixture in a heat safe bowl sprayed with Pam.  Place the bowl in the crock pot.  Add water in the crock pot about halfway up the bowl.  You'll need to add about an hour to your cooking time.  No burning!  This method works great for other recipes too such as stuffing!

I made this recipe and really liked it. I made it during the day to make sure it did not burn; after stirring everything, I had it sitting on the counter for a while and then it took about 6 hours to cook on low. I added one more cup of milk after reading other reviews. I also added 1/3 cup of sugar and omitted the pumpkin spice; I sprayed the crock pot with Pam before putting the ingredients in and added the nuts at the end; now I have 6 individual portions in the freezer; perfect for heating up before work.

Made this according to the directions, and it turned out great! It does make a lot, but is freezer sturdy. As others have posted, the oats make the difference. I used steel cut oats. i would highly recommend.

I really liked the flavor of this dish. It was naturally sweet from the fruit. The texture took some getting used to. I thought the contrast between the super crunchiness of the nuts and the softness of the oats was really weird. Perhaps I'm just used to mushy oatmeal, but if I made the recipe again, I would cut down on the amount of nuts or increase the amount of oats.

Delicious and easy! I set my medium size crockpot to Low and it was all cooked and a bit dry at 5 hours, so I stirred in additional 1 to 1.5 cups water. The kitchen smelled wonderful, like apple pie. Fine to omit the butter. I used raisins b/c that's what I had, so I'll try cranberries next time! I sprinkled chopped walnuts just before serving to maintain good crunch- great! Also drizzled a tiny amount of honey on top per the kids' request.

I wanted so much for this to be good, but alas, it wasn't. It didn't burn, but it did get hard at the bottom because it needed more liquid. I followed exactly, but to make it better, I would sub apple juice for the water (and add more of it), wait to add nuts until right before serving, add 1/2 tsp. salt and maybe some brown sugar. It was really bland, that which was edible. The milk did nothing for it. I used skim, so maybe next time use cream instead. Such a waste of good ingredients.

This is such a favorite in our house that I make extra so leftovers can be enjoyed days later by warming in the microwave.  Be sure to use steel cut oats and not rolled oats for this recipe to work as-is, as well as using only the lowest "warm" setting on the crock pot.  I always make with whole almonds and pecans for a more 'exciting' result, and dried cherries work well instead of cranberries but I've found raisins as a substitute are not tart enough.  I also always use ~1.5c whole milk and replace the pumpkin pie spice with a mixture of 1/4 t cloves, 1/8 t nutmeg, and 1/4 t cardamom, plus 4T loose brown sugar and 3/4 t salt.  For simplicity, I also use 2 whole apples rather than measuring.

This was awesome! I made 24 servings, and ran out of room in my crockpot, but it turned out perfect! My crockpot tends to boil on "low" so I put it on "warm" overnight to be safe, and had no problems at all! I also left out the butter, and I doubt it made a difference at all. So tasty! It was a big hit at a staff breakfast, and I came home with very little left!

Absolutely delicious!  I had to use old fashioned oats instead of steel cut, and it still came out perfectly. I also didn't add the pecans and almonds. I left my crock pot on warm instead of low after reading some other reviews. That was definitely a great tip. I'm sure I'll be making this quite often!

After six hours on low it was way over-cooked and lost all the appeal that steel cut oats have. My kids liked it but then they like the instant stuff, which I don't.

Maybe it was just me, or my slow cooker, but this recipe was not good at all.  I did everything per the directions, and YUCK.  I forced down one bowl and allowed myself the luxury of throwing the rest away, even though I don't like to waste.  I love love love oatmeal, especially steel cut oats, but this was just bad.  Overcooked, mushy and tasteless.

I wasn't able to get this started the night before, but made on stove top...turned out fantastic.   Only change I made was doing the apple cider instead of the milk like another suggested, mostly because I had on hand.  You do have to cook Steel Oats a long time.   Box said 30 minutes but I did additional 15 minutes.  I'm going to try this in the Crock Pot next time, I love that a little bit fills you up.

Set on Low on the crockpot overnight, this recipe burned all around the edges.  And the part in the middle that wasn't burnt had almost no flavor at all.  If I try this again, I will probably add about 1/2 brown sugar and will only cook it on Warm overnight or will cook it for only 2 or 3 hours on Low and then refrigerate for breakfast the next day.

Made this for a breakfast gathering recently and to be honest, it was a flop. It looked very unappealing and many wouldn't even try it. I followed the directions completely, and yes, it did stick to my crock badly. It was very thick when I first opened  it so I added more milk just to be able to stir it. I added 1/3 cup at a time until I had added a full cup. I had been hoping for a creamy oatmeal but what I got was oat paste. The taste was just bland, but I am giving it 3 stars because, despite the look, I found that after adding a sprinkle of brown sugar and a pat of butter, I actually liked it, though I doubt I'll be making it again.

Cooked this twice now. Love the easiness of the recipe - I've tried it with raisins, apricots, dried apples, maple syrup, brown sugar, applesauce, and nutmeg - turned out beautifully!  (It is something I need to watch or cook on low/warm like the others mentioned)

Really tasty!  I made it with apple cider instead of water, as others have suggested, but I won't next time.  It was good, but you couldn't taste the other ingredients over the apple flavor, and I think this made it almost too sweet as well.  I did have some problems with scorching on the bottom (had the crock pot set on low), but I used a crock pot liner, so cleanup was easy.

I used a brand new temp controlled slow cooker and followed the directions EXACTLY.  After only 6 hours the oatmeal was overcooked, this recipe does not work as written, I had my friend try the recipe just to make sure, she had the same disappointing results.  Great idea but needs some major tweaking!

I think the concept is great, but I didn't like this particular recipe. I think it was the pumpkin spice (which I usually love btw), but the flavors just didnt jive for me at all. It did cook perfectly overnight (about 9 hours) on the warm setting.

I made  this exactly as written and it is very good "as is".  Next time I will add more spices to better suit my personal preference.  Perfect for freezing in single serving plastic bags.  8 hours was perfect for my slow cooker.

Made this with my BF, and the two of us went to the store and bought rolled oats because they didn't have steel cut, and assumed it would be fine.  After reading some reviews we realized it might be a problem so we decided to only cook it for 4 hours.  My sweetie got up at 4am to turn on the crock pot- so nice of him but completely defeats the purpose :)  It tasted AWESOME though! The nuts were still crunchy and the oats were creamy but not too mushy.  We bought some steel cut oats to try again!

After reading through all the reviews, may I suggest putting your crockpot on a timer, that way you can control how long it runs for.

Extremely disappointing.  Awakened to this great-smelling stuff, looking forward to a comfortable breakfast, only to find a burned mess!  And I added extra water per the comments of others.  Expensive ingredients to have to throw out.  If I try again, will definitely use at least a 4:1 liquid to oatmeal ratio - probably more.

We really liked this recipe; I have to admit that I was looking for a "steel-cut oat" recipe this morning so I didn't get to use the slow-cooker method but next time I will do it that way!  I ended up adding extra water and let simmer for about 40 min on low.  I will not add the cranberries next time, they were a bit too tart.  We put brown sugar, butter and a little salt on them.  Thanks! :)

This was very easy to make. Tasted good..but i was expecting more of a "spicy" flavor. My family was calling this "porridge" and i'm not sure if thats a good thing. May try again using more cinnamon or adding nutmeg & ginger. Makes enough to feed an army.

I really wanted to like this, but the texture was less than desirable (pasty) and it wasn't sweet at all. My husband and kids didn't like it either.

We are off to IHOP.  The burned mess is sitting in the kitchen sink soaking and waiting for our return.  Ugh.

Needs some sweetness...I sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with honey. Put on warm setting overnight and it didn't burn. May make again if I need to have something pre-prepared.

Awful!  It smelled wonderful but had no flavor and it is going to take me a week to clean out my slow cooker because it all stuck and burnt to the sides.

Good flavor!  I added 1/2 tsp salt, as oatmeal can sometimes taste rather flat without it.  I used 1/4 cup orange juice to replace 1/4 a cup of the water.  Next time I'd add 1/2 a cup more liquid, as that might prevent the burning around the edges.  I also sprayed my crock as recommended.  I will make this again!

The ingredients sounded great, but mine ended up very heavy and gummy.  I think you need to almost double the liquid that the recipe calls for.  I cooked on low for only 4 hours and still have a cooked-on mess to clean out of the crockpot - I think 8 hours would have been a disaster.  Flavor was okay - added some brown sugar and more cinnamon after it was done.  The extra liquid might help, but I am not in a hurry to make it again.

Tasted pretty good. Substituted apple juice in place of the water and slow cooked using the "warm" setting.

This was pretty darn good! I used raisins and no nuts (picky eaters). I used rolled oats (that's what I had on hand) I chopped up 2 granny smith apples in my food processor put the rest of ingrediants in and used the "keep warm" setting on my slow cooker. (mine runs pretty hot). It came out perfect! A good stir and your ready to serve! A little milk or fat free half and half...delicious! I had a second helping later! Great breakfast idea for school mornings. Send them to the bus stop with something warm and filling in their belly! Not to mention, low fat, high fiber for Mom! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This did not turn out well. I added extra water after reading another review, and it still burned. It also did not have very good flavor and was very gummy. I would much rather make my oats in the morning and make a little more for later. I would not reccommend this recipe or method of cooking oats.

I guess I should have read more of the reviews on this recipe because I too ended up with a burnt crockpot full of shockingly tasteless mush, that reminded me alot of chunky mud! Will try again but will cook for a shorter period of time. Also, definitely, add the nuts towards the end or they will have the taste and consistency of beans when they are done.

i was one of the ones who used regular oats, not steel cut. I added 1 cup of water extra, thanks to the other reviewers tips. I also added brown sugar for the last 30 minutes. We loved it and i'll be making it again.

I made this using only apple, cinnamon and a little brown sugar with steel cut oats.  I read other reviews and decided to put my crock pot on warm instead of low...great advice! it had dried out quite a bit so next time I may add a bit more milk. Still it came out great.  I generally hate the texture of oatmeal but cooking it this way seems to have made a difference.  Will definitely make this again with more fruit next time.

I had given up on steel cut oats, too chewy and pasty,but this recipe has changed my mind.  The oatmeal was creamy and flavorful.  I added dates to mine and used almond milk instead of regular.  As per others input, added extra cup of liquid and put nuts in at end.  By early morning on low, the oatmeal was starting to get dry.  May try to change setting to warm next time.  Made lots! Good recipe.

**UPDATE - Made a second batch, using the full amount, actually had milk this time but everything else same as last time. Put it on Low, 3 hours. Perfect! Love this recipe!!*** - This is my first recipe using steel cut oats. Based on reviews talking about it burning, and knowing my slow cooker runs hot on one side, I was more attention than I will be in the future. I did cook on "Keep Warm" and ended with an hour on "Low" but next time I'll go a full 6 hours on "Keep Warm" and see how it goes. I had NO issues with too much liquid, didn't do the towel tip, and didn't add more than the recipe called for. I had no apples so I substituted in a fat 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce (made a half batch btw!). Didn't have pecans so subbed in roasted unsalted sunflower seeds. Lastly had no milk, so used evaporated milk  that'd been cut with water (1/2 & 1/2) for the recipe. In the hopes my daughter would like this, I also added some stevia. Just finished eating a bowl that I reheated, adding a bit more milk and a drizzle of honey. Yum!!!

There are good and bad things about this recipe, written as is. The good things are the flavor mix and the concept. The apples, dried cranberries, nuts and cinnamon make for a really tasty flavor. The bad things are that the quantities listed in the ingredients and cooking time are not accurate, and you must, must, MUST use steel cut oats!!! There is no budging on this ingredient--rolled and/or instant oats would be a disaster. But I love steel cut oats. The big discrepancy in the recipe is that on the back of a steel cut oats container, you'll see for every 1 cup oats you need about 4 cups water. This recipe has a 1 cup oats: 1.5 cups water ratio. The packaging generally states 1 cup oats: 1 cups water. So add at LEAST 8 cups water for 2 cups oats if you're making this overnight on "keep warm." If it's on "low" you'll need 9 or 10 cups water, in my opinion. Especially if you might sleep in a little ;-) So keep the apples, add ins and spices, but be very careful to make sure the water to steel cut oats ratio is consistent with your oats' packaging instructions.

This was a wonderful idea! I made a few adjustments adding almond milk and omitting the apples and nuts since they are not my favorite in cooked recipes.  I made it the night before my husband had to get up at 4:45am to take his Dad to the airport.  They woke up to a spice scent filling the home and a delicious breakfast before sending him on the plane.  So much better than a granola bar in a hurry.  Plus I got to sleep in and it kept warm until I got up for work.  I can't wait to make it again as our family will have it devoured in about 2 days.  Thank for the recipe.

This recipe is delicious!! I cook it on warm overnight instead of low to avoid sticking, and I also use an extra 1/2c of milk. I usually change up the dried fruit every time for variety and add an extra teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Yummy every time!

I also use steel cut oats, apple juice,and whole milk. I always use a hard apple,usually honey crisp,or a granny smith. I like to mix it up, sometimes I use either a chopped dried fruit mix,sometimes sold as a fruit cake mix,(fruit not candied fruit),or chopped dried cherries and apricots. I add the almonds at the start and the pecans at the end. I double the pumpkin spice mix and I add freshly grated nutmeg to taste, about 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon. I also add 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. I put it all into a buttered souffle dish which I place in my crock pot. I add about 1 1/2 cups water around the edge. and cook on low 6-8 hours. I top each bowl with more freshly grated nutmeg, a dash of cinnamon, a sprinkle of brown sugar, dried raisins or cranberries and a tablespoon or two of cream, half and half or milk.

Changed totally 2 cups water 2 cups almond milk, 1 cup diced dates, left the pecans and walnuts whole.  2 diced apples. And coconut oil instead of butter. Turned on 'warm' right before bed, perfect as is, or a little if real maple syrup drizzled on top. Put into pint jars and eat as a cold snack/breakfast at work. making it again tonight.

This was a delicious, healthy oatmeal!  I read the reviews and decided to try it as is...it cooked 7 hours and definitely burned on the bottom of the crock pot the way other people talked about.  I was able to salvage most of it, however, and it was delicious!  I think next time I will definitely use the warm setting on my crock pot.  Heads up--some reviews said as long as you use real steel oats it should be just fine...well...I used real steel oats--and not the quick steel oats...and it still burned a bit.  I think it is all in the crock pot.  Some just get hotter than others, even on low.  If you have a warm setting, I would try that first after my experience.  Really was a delicious and healthy recipe, though!  Definitely recommend.

Not bad. I had to half the recipe. It does smell good in the morning! But VERY bland though. At the end I added some sugar, more cinnamon, and some milk. I'd also add a little extra water if you think you might need longer than 8 hours.

I had problems with the recipe as did other reviewers, though I think it has potential.  I did get a lot of burnt oatmeal after 8 hours cooking, but what wasn't burnt was great!  I think the burning might be related to the shape of our slow cooker one of the large oval kinds and maybe it runs hot.  I think maybe the cinnamon was overkill.  Next time on warm or add more liquid.

I should have read some reviews before making this recipe last night!  I only paid attention to the 4 plus stars with the recipe...MISTAKE!  I woke up to lovely smells, but in the slow cookier, this concoction was a sticky, burned mess!  And it was very grainy in texture - the fruit was mushy, too. This was too costly to come out so badly, so I'll stick to making my steel cut oats the regular way, and topping it with chopped apples, raisins and nuts like I usually do!

Try using whole (unrolled) oats, not steel cooked, or a mixture of brown rice & oats.  I also increased the amounts to make a larger batch and that helped with the burning--try it with all water also to decrease the burning.

I have an old crock pot with only a high and low setting so maybe that was the problem, but had I not gotten up in the middle of the night and thought to check it, it would have burned for me too. I thought it needed a lot more liquid. I have put in a lot of water and milk to get it eatable. It has a good flavor but it just didn't work for me.

Easy Breezey for a large sleep over crowd. I found that I needed to add a bit more liquid to mine and the consistency was more like a baked oatmeal but very creamy.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed.  It smelled great but it really needed something.  My husband drown it in honey and said it was good.  I am a Weight Watcher and it already is 4 pts so I didn't want to waste anymore pts on the honey.  Sorry but I probably won't make this again.

I very excited to try this recipe when I had family staying with me for the weekend but I was pretty disappointed with the end result.  I cooked the oatmeal on the "keep warm" setting as other suggested and it had a great flavor but the texture was well, sticky, gummy and just terrible.  Not for me.

Turned out pretty tasty! If cooking on low setting, a shorter cooking time would be better. I cooked for 7 seven hours and it was a little burnt around the edges. I'd try this one again on the warm setting.

Very good!  I found the spice to be a little overwhelming so I cut it back to 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Adding a little extra liquid helps, too.  Yummy!

The taste was excellent and I liked that each person could adjust it to the sweetness they liked, it wasn’t already too sugary.  I did have a HUGE issue with having to add water in again and again to keep it a normal texture.  I’m really not sure what was happening but I ended up using about triple the amount of water called for to prevent it from burning or drying out.  I prepared it and cooked on low heat, using a crock liner (I’ve learned from many past cleanups), and it was ready exactly as listed.  I’d be interested to know if anyone else had this issue.  I’ve been cooking for over 55 years and there is always an explanation for this type of “weirdness” but I can’t figure it out!  Anyway, greasy taste with minimal pre

I made it just as written and the only changes I would make is to use less nuts and to spray the crock pot with cooking spray before adding in the ingredients. With 6 people in our family this is one of the few recipes that everyone liked! Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic! The grands loved it even my grandson who is a notorious picky eater he had three bowls even had it for lunch! I used up all the odds and ends of dried fruit and nuts in the pantry. If you don't have steel cut oats do yourself a favour and don't make this you will be disappointed.

This is quite delicious and it took me all of 7 minutes to put together!  I've never used steel cut oats before, but I just bought a small amount from the bulk section at my grocery store.  I think they cost me 50 cents!  I put this on low for 6 hours and then my crock pot switches over to warm.  It was probably in 8 hours total.  I used a crock pot liner and was very glad I did because it did burn a little.  I also added the nuts just before serving so they would be crunchy.  Delicious!

I made this recipe last night first I line the Crock-Pot with my slow-cooker liners I love these then I added the two cups of steel cut oatmeal along with all the ingredients I left the skin on the apples and instead of pecans I used crushed almonds I put it on low for one hour and then warm all night I started this at 9:30 so 9:30 to 10:30 I put it on low and from 10:30 till 7 in the morning I left it on warm it was perfect ready to eat I also added a quarter cup of brown sugar to the mix while it was cooking best recipe ever will definitely make it again!!!

I don't like oatmeal - not at all. but this is so delish and the steel cut oats taste so much better than the regular oats. I guess it's a texture thing but this is a great recipe. Give it a try!

It was easy to put together and you really can use anything you have. I had an opened can of peaches already so put that in there with syrup so I wouldn't have to use any added sugar later. I did walnuts and dried cranberries with Almond milk. Next time I'm going to put banana and walnuts. I left the oatmeal in the slow cooker over night for the flavors to muse more and it was delicious for my morning breakfast at work. 
Thanks for the recipe but BEWARE of the time and effectiveness of your slow cooker. Know your slow cooker!

I was hungry before I was totally awake this morning just from the delicious smell!
I used steel cut oats on low;  cranberry seed nut trail mix instead of raisins and 1c frozen blueberries & 1 banana instead of apples.
Pour in some boiling water from the kettle before you stir it in your crock pot and you are ready to serve. 
0% real Greek Yogurt adds some more great protein for this yummy brekky.

FANTASTIC!  Yum, yum!  I liked that this does not contain sweetener of any kind, therefore, you can sweeten as desired - if desired.  Tastes great.  I chose to cook mine during the day, and then put the mixture in a container in the frig.  When I was ready to eat, I scooped the amount I wanted into a microwavable bowl, added 1 or 2 Tablespoons of water, and nuked it for 1 min.  I did not spray the crock, and the mixture DID stick, but I was ok with that.  Soaking the crock overnight with soap & water makes it easy to clean.  I used my old 3 Qt RIVAL crock.  It doesn't have a "warm" setting - just "low" or "high".

I am very glad I read other reviews before making this but I didn't take all of the suggestions and I should have.  The MOST IMPORTANT thing to do in this recipe is use STEEL CUT OATS.  They are not the same as Quaker oats.  I had a hard time finding them in the regular grocery store and eventually found them in the bulk foods section.  I took the suggestion of many others of not adding the nuts in while cooking - I prefer the crunchy texture they give when you add them after cooking.  I also checked the crock pot after 6 hours and was quite glad I did because it was burning on one side of the pot.  I was able to use almost the entire recipe still since I had caught it in time - I would NOT have wanted to find that if it had cooked another 2 hours.  The suggestions I did not take that I should have was add more liquid.  I will be adding at least another 1-2 cups of water and/or milk next time.  The ratio of liquid to steel cut oats was not enough.  The recipe DOES taste great!  The flavors are all there and I will make this many times again, but using all of the suggestions I read from other reviewers.  If I didn't have to adjust so many things this would have had 5 stars.

Wow! Talk about stick to your ribs! This was very tasty. I stuck pretty close to the recipe with the following exceptions: I did not use the pumpkin pie spice (not a fan of it). I subbed half a cup of chopped dates for the pecans. I cooked this on low for 2 and a half hours and then 5 and a half hours on the "keep warm" setting. I did not have any issues with scorching or burning although the oatmeal seemed a tad dry so I added an additional cup of milk at the end which did the trick and made the oatmeal nice and creamy. I've never had steel cut oats before and I really enjoyed them.

This is a good recipe. Changes I made were to add almond milk for regular milk and to exclude the butter and nuts. I will make it again, but I will add more liquid because it cooked dry (although not burnt) after 7 hours cooking on the low setting.

This oatmeal is AMAZING! To think I hated oatmeal growing up! I did make it on the stove because I think my slow cooker runs hot. Follow the directions on the bag for the oatmeal/liquid ratio as I think you need more liquids for the stove. You can put the walnuts or pecans in while cooking but I would put the sliced almonds in after so they don't get mushy. I also added ground flax seeds to bump up the health factor. I think if you want to try it in the slow cooker, make it during the daytime first so you can watch the pot and see how long it will really take to cook in your crockpot.

Disappointed.  I made this with high hopes to wake up on a cold and rainy spring morning.  Didn't smell anything...oatmeal was very dark colored due to the cinnamon.  Not burnt on the bottom of my crockpot but brown and hard--not appealing.  Crasins were tasteless--will add them in after the cooking next time.  Followed recipe but not happy with results--sorry Julie!  I will try a few other crockpot steel oat recipes on the site because I do love it, but only when it is creamy.  P.S.  I do have a newer crockpot and I do not think the error was with the cooking time or temp.

We really liked this recipe for many reasons.  Made pretty much as written but cut the recipe in half.  Also, I did not have almonds so I added extra pecans, and I added an extra 1/4 c water toward the end.  I love that it was easy to throw together and tasted great.  I particularly liked the texture that the pecans added.  The apple gave natural sweetness, and then DH and I could add whatever amount of brown sugar we wanted to suit our tastes.  Next time I will make sure to have bananas on hand because I think they would be great sliced on top when serving.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I definitely would suggest adding liquid. I used 4 cups of almond milk and 2 cups of water and 1.5 cups of the steel cut oats. I had never cooked steel cut oats and was not aware of the difference quite honestly!!! Because of the reviews about burning and the fact that I have a crock pot with only a low and high setting, I had to get up during the nite to check it. It was starting to stick after about 6 hrs so I stirred and added some agave nectar and a little more salt and turned off the crock pot until the morning. I turned it back on low and stirred it some more and added 1 cup of h20 and it is delicious! I sampled it and its tasty! I did have to modify the recipe as many here did. This is not one to try if you have limited experience cooking, thats for sure!If I make it again, I will add 1 cup more of liquid than I did and set my alarm to check it after 6 hrs. I also think I could have used more spices since the oats swell and yield up more than what you think it will. Again, this is a good base recipe that needed a lot of tweaking. I was grateful I read the reviews first!!!! Good luck!

It is good but like some others have suggested, I would add more liquid. General rule of thumb for cooking steel cut oats is one cup oats to three cups liquid. This did stick in my crockpot on the sides and bottom a little, even though I sprayed with cooking spray. I have a new crockpot that has timer and it will go to warm when finished cooking.

I think a good addition would be vanilla soy or almond milk or coconut milk, just to add a tad of sweetness.  My husband thought they were too dry and not sweet enough.  I added milk when I heated mine up to eat and I like that it is not terribly sweet. 

Everything else about this recipe is terrific though and I will make again with some tweaks.

First time making steel cut oats. Used warm setting overnight for almost 9 hrs and turned out good. Added some brown sugar too and topped with a little maple syrup. Thanks for sharing!
