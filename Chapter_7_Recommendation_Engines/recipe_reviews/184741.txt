I've been cooking great dishes for the past 30 years, and I have to say without a doubt, this is one of the best country meals I have ever had.  I didn't have dry limas, so I used a frozen pack I had in the freezer, and waited until the neck bones were tender before adding them.  I was concerned  about how I would like the sage and netmeg, but they weren't  overwhelming in flavor, but mildly blended in with everything else.   This is a keeper!

I'm so sorry, but this was not good for us. I followed the directions exactly, and the flavor was okay. The meat fell off the bones all right, but then we had a mess of lima beans, meat and tiny bones all mixed together. Did I do something wrong?

This was very good - family loved it. The only thing I would change is to cut back on the sage due to personal preference. Thanks for posting.

I had some pork neck bones and some lima beans that I wanted cook up so I came on AR just looking at bean recipes.  Imagine my surprise at finding an actual recipe for neck bones and lima beans!  I wanted to make the dish a little tomato-y and bbq-y tasting so I added tomato sauce and barbeque sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I had never cooked neck bones before, I just bought them on a whim because they were cheap, and this was a wonderful way to cook them.  Thank you so much CRB, you really made my day!

I am not rating this a 5 star because I made so many modifications I didn't think it would be fair but nonetheless I used this recipe as a baseline and made a similar dish with what I had that was wonderful. I made this using a bag of frozen lima beans, 4 large slices of Country ham as well as a packet of Country ham bouillon, minced garlic, minced onions, lots of pepper a dash of salt and some italian seasonings. I cooked the country ham then broke it into pieces in the skillet on the stove. I then added the bag of frozen lima beans, all of the seasonings and 2 cups of water. I brought this to a boil and then simmered it on low for about 35 minutes and it was wonderful. Hope this helps.

I am going to try this next time with pork short ribs.I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon .1 Tablespoon is too much for my family. Make sure you soak the lima beans for at least 12 hours otherwise some will still be dry and solid.

Classic. I just didn't bother with the nutmeg.

Yes, I definitely made changes and more likely will make it again. I added more vegetables such as:  chopped up celery, stick of scallions, sliced carrots like matchsticks size,  I chopped up about 8 baby tomatoes, and chopped up parsley and I grated about of ginger and added it to the tablespoon of olive oil and a tsp of butter and cooked up for like 5 mins    
I don't eat pork so I used turkey neckbones and same way I used half of the rubbed mixture and let it marinate for like 1/2 hour while I prepare the beans. To the rub mixture I also added a tsp of allspice and tsp of cinnamon.  And I just do everything the same way. Except when ready to add the beans and the remaining mixture of rub I just added powder coconut milk (1/2 tablespoon) to add a Caribbean taste.   And cook it down for 1/2 hour until beans are tender. Optional:  I added a couple of corn and a handful of greens either arugula or kale or what you like and cook down with beans in half hour time.

I made neck bones for the first time using this recipe and boy it sure was good! The only thing I left out was the nutmeg and sage.

My family loved an one of my Grandsons who doesn’t eat leftovers, ate a second helping. They requested I make it again.
I added diced jalapeños to the recipe so yummy added additional flavor.

This turned out so good!  Made it last month and followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing different was that I used frozen green Lima beans because the grocery store didn’t have dried white Lima beans.  My husband loved it, and he’s picky!  Headed to the store now so can make it again.  That prompted me to write this review.

This was good but a little on the bland side. I think if I make this again I will use a smoked meat for more flavor. Ham or maybe smoked turkey would give this more flavor.
