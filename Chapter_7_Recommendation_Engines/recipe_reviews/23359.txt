My family loved this pie...we tried it for Thanksgiving. I exchanged the walnuts for pecans
and it turned out great as well.

The closest in taste to the actual Derby classic that I have found.  Use STEENS cane syrup instead of regular corn syrup and it is dead on.  I always add an extra egg yolk to make sure it sets to the perfect condistency.  YUM

Initially I would have had Sabrina's opinion.  This pie is too strong and I would never make it again.  I made it to serve at our Mother's Day dinner and no one expected the molasses flavor to be so THERE!

I was all set to throw the pie out on Monday night and I decided to give it one last try.

Friends and neighbors, it was to DIE for!!!  While it was sitting those 24 hours, all the flavors in the pie traded off on one another and it was fabulous!

My suggestion would be if you are going to make this pie, make it 2 - 4 days before you are going to serve it and let all the flavors soak into on another.

I really misjudged this pie.  Once it sets for a few days, it is incredible!  It is also very, very rich.  I did not serve this in the standard 1/8 size servings but I went to 1/16 size.  And yes! Ice cream!  Very definitely a scoop of French vanilla ice cream.  It is absolute heaven!
