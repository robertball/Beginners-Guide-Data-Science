Good flavor! I seasoned the meat the way I usually make a burger (onion powder, garlic powder, ground mustard, and pepper).  I also added bacon pieces to the burger mix and the ranch/cheese mix.  The bacon added that little extra something.  Easy and tasty.

I make this a little differently- I use a HVR packet to season the meat. Make sure you combine it very well. Add about 10 shakes of Worcestershire, 1/2 of an finely chopped sweet onion, and a small amt. of cilantro or parsley finely chopped. I baste w/ more worcestershire during cooking and top with favortie sliced cheese. YUMM! This is not dry even if you use the leanest turkey meat.

These were very good and juicy, though wish I could taste the ranch flavor a little more. Perhaps ranch dressing mix (in the packet) would have more flavor. Like the other reviewer, I also added some garlic powder, ground mustard and bacon bits.

I added two handfuls of Italian style bread crumbs just to give the burgers a bit of body.  These are delicious.  Hardy, but not too heavy.  This one has found a permanent home in my recipe box.

Really good! I used 1/2 packet of the dry hidden valley ranch dressing packet instead of the actual salad dressing.  I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic.  Very tasty turkey burgers. Family enjoyed!  Thanks.

I seasoned up the burgers with some of my own favorite seasonings and added an egg yolk and some bread crumbs to plump them up. I don't have an outdoor grill so I cook them on our countertop grill. The sauce is what really makes this burger though. So tasty. We have made this a few times now and will make it again.

Only changes to the recipe were two tablespoons of soy sauce in the turkey before making the patties and I did not have any green onion so I used the yellow onion I had on hand.  I loved them!  Will definitely make again as a different turkey burger recipe than we usually use.  Thanks!

I took a lot of the reviewers suggestions and used the HVR packet, worcestshire sauce, bread crumbs, garlic, and onion powder.  Very, very, yummy.  Thank you for all of the great ideas!
