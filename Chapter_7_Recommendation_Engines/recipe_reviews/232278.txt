I followed direction exactly and it took over 3 hours to bake these guys. I sliced the zucchini very thin and got as much moisture off of them before hand as possible. They also didn't cook evenly so I had to remove browned ones intermittently. Used about 3 lbs of zucchini and got about 12 oz of chips out of it. 

They shrink up too small to really use with a dip but taste pretty good on their own.

i followed the directions exactly, and even after 2 and a half hours they still were not done. i used the broiler on low after that until they were golden brown. they still tasted really good.

EDIT: so I made them again. I don't think I had parchment paper last time, I used tin foil instrad. This time I had parchment paper like suggested. On the bottom rack of the oven they came out much better. The too rack did not turn out browned after 2 hours.

I tried this recipe word to the wise if the slices are too thin they will burn if their too large it will take too long to cook. You have to cut them somewhere in between medium thick. They taste good but I wouldn't make thus again...

Eh. They taste fine just not worth it. Doesn't yield a ton, like a small bowl of salty leaves.
I just think there is a better use for these vegetables.

Delicious! But the chips shrink a lot.  Add garlic powder to taste even better!

Slice with mandolin or else forget it! Sprinkle with a bit of salt to dehydrate overnight. Allow to come to room tempt. Pat dry before dredging. Fry in Medhigh oil, they are delicate!

Poor recipe. Used Food Network's and they were great. This one leaves half chewy, half overly crisp. Next time, turn it to 200 for 1.5 hours.

The chips are very tasty but the temperature of the oven needs to be at least 250 degrees. After several hours at 200 and the slices were still moist, I raised the temperature and the chips began to crisp.  Definitely worth a try a try because they are quite tasty!

I want to like this method, but I haven't gotten great results with it. Slices have to be identical to avoid uneven doneness, and still, they go from good to burned in a minute when they finally crisp up. It's been impossible to get even doneness, even with perfect slices, one side will be done and one side wont. However, the chips that have turned out were very tasty, I'd say only half of them turn out good. I think this is really something that is better done with a food dehydrator, which sadly I do not have.

Even after 3 hours in the oven at 225 degrees, the zucchini was still limp and oily.

Just like other people mentioned, I followed the recipe exactly and it took 3 hours, never got CRISPY and tasted terrible...I strongly suggest that you try something else.
