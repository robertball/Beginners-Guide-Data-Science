This is the perfect bread for the busy holidays because it takes very little effort to put together the day before.  The next morning simply shape it, let it rise, and bake.  The bread has wonderful flavor and texture.  This recipe is also listed on this website as Chef Johnâ€™s Pumpkin Bread.

This is a fantastic bread. I used 2-1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup oat bran and it was simply delicious!!!

By far, the easiest, and most fool-proof bread we've ever made. We've tried various recipes but always come back to this one. Now we just have to figure out a way to get some whole grains into it and have it come out just as perfect!

Made this for Thanksgiving, everyone really loved it it didn't actually make it to Dinner everyone ate it.
Followed the video no changes, except I let it rise a bout 24 hours just because I made the dough at home before traveling .
Very good will make it again.

Lovely crust and chewy inside. This was so very easy to make and it was delicious. I doubled the pumpkin and it had a slight pumpkin flavor.

It's a very good bread, but has little flavor of pumpkin. It will go great with all the Fall soups!

Delicious and easy to make.  I must admit, however, I didn't read the recipe closely enough before I started and was therefore surprised to see it had to rise 12-16 hours.  So, based on the time I started the recipe I would have to bake the bread at 3 in the morning.  Since no way that was going to happen I let it rise a total of 19 hours and baked it at 8 the next morning.  It was still a delicious loaf that my family enjoyed eating with homemade soup.
