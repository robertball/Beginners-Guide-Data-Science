This is the best asparagus soup I've ever tasted, and I order it in many fine restaurants.  Ignore everyone who has reviewed this recipe without making this recipe verbatum and tell you to add bacon, lettuce, tomato, potato, wine, rubbing alcohol, peanuts, pork, lighter fluid, etc etc.  If they never followed the recipe, they shouldn't be reviewing it.  Make it exactly as described and you won't be disappointed.  After making it the first time, go ahead and add some chocolate chips or pine cones or whatever you think it needs, but review it based upon this recipe.  It's a winner!

This was so tasty we ran out and bought asparagus so we could make more! Remember that you can use the big asparagus that you wouldn't use otherwise because it's going to be pureed. Other than doubling the recipe the only thing I would change is that I would save the asparagus heads after sauteeing and use them as garnish instead of pureeing them. Excellent recipe!

This was a great recipe to start with but I added a few things;
I fried *bacon and removed it from the pot then added asparagus, *garlic, *leek and onions and *sauteed for about five minutes before adding the stock to simmer.  I also added *1/2 cup white wine to the stock.

As a garnish, I sauteed the asparagus spears in olive oil.

It was a very easy, fun and delicious soup to make.  I can't wait to make it again.

* = my changes to the recipe

Who knew that starting out with doggie bag asparagus from our dinner out the other night would end up creating something so delicious and elegant?! Because I was using asparagus already cooked crisp/tender I had to modify the cooking method a bit and I improvised on the recipe to a minor degree as well, but not so much as to significantly alter the intent of the recipe. I used half and half rather than the milk and sour cream and an equal measure of chicken broth. I also substituted shallots for the onion. I liked that this recipe limited itself to the clean and simple flavor of the asparagus, without distracting additions of garlic or other seasonings and it proved itself out. I made this ahead of time and it was easy enough to reheat once I was ready to serve dinner. To garnish, I sauteed scallops in browned butter, nestled one in each soup bowl, then topped the scallop with criss-crossed asparagus tips. Because of our frequent and extensive travel, hubs and I eat at wonderful restaurants all over the country, and we both declared this soup as fine as we've had anywhere.

This soup is fantastic!  I make it regularly for guests and even get requests for it from sick friends.  I have tweaked it through out the years.

Always double it.  I use 1 cup lowfat  milk, 1 cup fat free half and half.  I add 2 good pinches of red pepper flakes to the rue.  It does not make it spicy, only adds a little heat under all the flavors. I use 1/2 tea more salt and a pinch of garlic powder. I puree in batches in my blendar.  Dont forget the lemon.  I always squeeze a tablespoon or so from a fresh lemon (never the reconstituded stuff it is not the same).

I serve it with a dollop of sour cream and a touch of red pepper flakes to mix in.   It is a lovely presnetation.  I have never had a person not love it.

Fantastic, I made this soup for a very important dinner party I was throwing. I had so many compliments that I ended up printing this recipe off for most of my guests before they had left for the evening. One tip for novice asparagus handlers, don't use the ends of the asparagus, they remain woody even after being cooked, I ended up straining the soup to get the woody pieces out, ha ha, live and learn!

If you want your friends to think you've become an overnight gourmet chef, I urge you to serve this wonderful soup. I mixed things up a bit by adding my flour to the onions once they were just about done. I then added my broth a little at a time and whisked to keep it lump free. I then added two bunches of asparagus and simmered until tender. From there I pureed in my food processor and added the vegies back into the pot. I seasoned with my ususal garlic and onion powders, black pepper and lots of dried dill weed. I didn't see the need for the milk, so I just used a large dollop of low fat sour cream. I garnished with some of the tips and mad crostini on the side which made a beautiful presentation! The color is fabulous and the flavors are even better Holly. Hubby went nuts over this and I thank you for submitting this truly elegant recipe!

It's amazing how all the cream of asparagus soups always taste differently. :)
I kind of like the flavor of the Cream of Fresh Asparagus Soup I better, but
this one is definitely faster and easier to make. Also, it has a delightful full
flavor to it and a pleasing texture and color, so it's definitely worth trying!

This recipe was nothing special.  If anything it was quite bland.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I substituted vegetable stock instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.  I never understand why people review a recipe when they didn't really follow it!

My wife found this recipe in the Tried & True Quick & Easy Cookbook and it has fast become a family favorite. We double the recipe because 4 servings just isn't enough. My gluten-free mother subbed corn starch for flour and she loves it too. Thanks.

I just made this soup for lunch, and all I can say is WOW! I love it. I will be making this again and again. Do not skip putting the lemon juice in. It gives it a great smooth finish.

FABULOUS!  Will make a lot now.  I used fat-free half-and-half and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray" and it turned out fantastic.  I blended both parts together to make it super-creamy.  Added fat-free sour cream and cilantro on the top-- delicious!

All those that didnt like it because it was stringy - you need to break off the dried ends prior to making this (or any other) asparagus dish. (Hold spear between thumb and first finger with both hands and bend spear until it snaps off. Throw the bottoms away!. 

This recipe was super easy quick and very easy to make. I only had a spoon or two as I was cleaning out the pot I cooked it in after I transfered it to smaller serving bowls to cool. It's going to be lunch for myself and a asparagus loving employee tomorrow. In any case, the few spoons I had tasted wonderful! Only suggestion I could think to make was that next time I will add some freshly shaved parmesan cheese and save some asparagus tips for garnish. 

If you like asparagus - try this recipe! You wont be disappointed.

As one reviewer mentioned to cut off the tips of the asparagus 'cuz they turn "woody".  I did that and kept every thing else the same. My daughter will eat this soup. I make Bellepepper's personal flatbread to go along with it. So good!

YUM-YUM!!  Such a good soup. I took other reviewer's advice about sauteeing the onion with some garlic before cooking in the chicken broth and asparagus pieces, and it came out just wonderful.  I used fat-free creamer and fat-free sour cream to cut back on the calories and it still tasted fantastic.  Making the roux with the flour, butter and chicken broth was easy too...I'm one of those people who find making rouxs nerve-wracking but all came out well. Highly recommended!!

Very nice.  Only change is that I make my own chicken stock and freeze it, so I used that instead of canned.  It was warm and rich and helped me use up an excess of asparagus.  Thanks for posting!

I'm not usually an asparagus fan, but our store had some great looking bunches!  I wanted to find something new to do with it and found this recipe.  I didn't think the 1/2c chicken stock was enough, but it turned out to be just fine.  I made the recipe as written and it was great!  I added extra pepper because I love me some fresh ground pepper.

Wow, even better than I thought it could be.  Had one bowl, then two, then three (shame).  Outstanding recipe.  You are not going to get a better Asparagus Soup recipe.  I substituted non-fat greek yogurt for the sour cream and it was perfect.

Very good!  I made a double batch, as I wanted to freeze some.  I made this as written, although I did cut the salt back to half the amount (used 1 t. in my double batch).   I used one full can of broth to cook my asparagus and one full can to add to my roux.  Since I planned on freezing some of this, I did not add the milk, sour cream or lemon juice, because milk and sour cream will often break/curdle after freezing and thawing.  I made this early in the day and refrigerated the two portions I planned to use for dinner.  I then added the appropriate amount of milk, sour cream and lemon juice to the cold soup and gently reheated.  This way I totally eliminated the chance of the sour cream breaking when adding it to the hot soup.  We both liked this and I’m glad I have more stashed in the freezer to enjoy again!

Delicious. I made this early to warm up for dinner.  I can't wait for my husband to taste it.  My only disappointment is that I didn't break off the woody stem because of a review I read and I can feel some of the stringy texture in the soup.

Okay, asparagus and what to do with it. I modified this recipe a bit. I cooked in a large skillet a single piece of thick bacon and then removed the cooked bacon an put aside. I then fried half an onion and half a shallot for five to six minutes in the bacon grease. Once they were starting to carmalize I  then added the asparagus to the same pan and covered it so it could cook for an additional 12 minutes. Half way through the 12 minutes I took out the spears of asparagus and cut off the top inch and a half of each spear and put it aside with the cooked bacon to use in the final soup. I then completed the cooking and when finished put the entire mixture from the skillet into a blender and pureed the mixture. Then I made the roue in the same manner as the recipe but in the same skillet as I cooked the vegatables in earlier scraping the tiny bits from the bottom of the pan where I had carmalized the onion and the shallot. I added the milk and the rest of the chicken broth to the roue slowly and when completed returned the asparagus, onion and shallot puree to the skillet with the roue. Now, I diced the thick bacon into pea sized pieces and added the tops of the asparagus spears and put them both in the completed soup. The combination was spectacular and the taste was worth the addition of the bacon and the shallot. This taste made it unnecessary to add any cream to this version and produced one of the best cream of asparagus soups I have ever made.

I thought this was such an easy recipe, Im Italian so its not in my genetic makeup to ever follow a recipe to a T. I don't bake for that reason. The chicken broth gave it great flavor. I really didn't need add much more. I saw one complaint about people not following directions and then reviewing the recipe. Vegetable broth would give it a different flavor maybe you can find a way to tweak it for your taste. Brilliant thought about the bacon. Always happy with allrecipes.

Pretty good, but missing something. I think that next time I will use less milk--I'd like the flavor to be just a tad more intense.

First time making this and it came out awesome!  I took a reviewers suggestion to add the tips in at the end to make it a little chunky.  Otherwise it's simply delicious just the way it is.  Thanks!

This was great! My son (8) dislikes asparagus, so I told him it was "cream of veggie soup." He took one tentative bite (I mean, it WAS green!) and said, "mmm, this is good!" Hubby gave me "the look" since I kinda told a story about the origins, but we agreed not to tell him unless he asks. The soup was a little salty; next time I won't add the 1 tsp salt, but it was a healthy start to our ratatoullie dinner; everything helps when you try to eat healthier. Thanks for the post; this is going in my "keeper" file.

Fantastic recipe, even my partner who dislikes asparagus loved it.  I also sauteed the onions,  a clove of garlic and asparagus in a couple of tbs of butter before putting them into the chicken broth.

Overall I must say this recipe was pretty tasty.  My only complaint was that I wish it were just a tad more flavorful. However it is good in that it is creamy without being too rich.  But as I said, it was good overall.  I also used double the suggested amount of asparagus without altering the amount of any of the other ingredients and I am very glad I did.  I can't imagine the recipe without as much asparagus.
Additionally, like some of the other reviewers I am terrible at following a recipe exactly.  Half the fun for me is to experiment.  So I used shallots in place of regular bulb onions (same amount) and also added cooked pancetta bacom and cooked wild rice when adding the pureed asparagus mixture.  In hindsight I would probably use a more flavorful pork product like Canadian Bacon, but I loved these additions with it and will definitely prepare it similarly again.  It's also fun to serve it with some thin slices of french or ficelle bread that have been toasted in the oven (I like to drizzle mine with garlic oil before I cook them).  They make such a simple and deliciously functional garnish on the side of the plate and are so yummy for dipping.

This soup is very good, though a bit too buttery for my liking.  I will definitely omit the butter on the next go round.  I also used 1% milk and non-fat sour cream - yummy and healthy!  It's fabulous paired with the Asparagus and Shrimp Stir Fry with Noodles.

I don't even have words for how wonderful this soup is.   I have practically lived on it all winter.  It is comfort food at it's best - and it's healthy besides.   Easy and absolutely delicious!

Just ok. Agreed the fresh lemon juice was necessary and I liked adding a bit of goat cheese in place of the sour cream. I think this is just personal taste and the recipe is fine and personally, I'm not a huge fan of these kinds of soup.

This was very tasty soup! The only change I made was instead of making a puree, I put the asparagus pieces in before the sour cream step and used a hand blender to break it up. It made the perfect texture. YUM!

I really liked this recipe. I thought it could be a little thicker but overall it was wonderful . Alot of people made changes that were not necessary and i hate it when people review the recipe after they have created an entire different recipe before even trying the original.

Made this recipe and it was delicious! Perfect texture and balance. The only change I made was adusting the servings to 12 and I used an emersion blender to only slightly puree the onions and asparagus only b/c it's our preference - we like the more chunky consistantcy to our soups. Thank you for the recipe - I'll be making it again!

Very good! My first time to make asparagus. Very easy recipe. My only changes are, I don't care for onions so I sauteed garlic, celery and asparagus in butter. The rest I stuck with the recipe. I will be making this again soon. Next time I will try it with sauteing the veggies in bacon. I will also add some sharp cheddar cheese.

This is a wonderful soup! Followed the recipe exactly - with one really minor change. I kept some of the tips back and didn't puree them. It was velvety rich and creamy. Hubby had 4ths (I had tripled the recipe). Thank you so much for this recipe!

I just made this to try before I serve it for Easter dinner - not only will I serve it, but I'll have to triple the recipe because it is so good!  My husband (who has always refued to even try asparagus) ate a whole bowl and scraped the sides.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious - smooth and creamy and rich.  It was a bit salty, so next time, I will use sodium free chicken broth.  Another plus is that it was very easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe MARBALET!

My husband loved this.  I sauted the asparaus in butter and cooked almost done.  Then I assembled the soup and simmered.  I did not make a rue or put milk in it.  I did add some white wine.  I used a hand blender and left some chunks of asparagus in the soup.  I also used three and a half pounds of asparagus.  I garnished the soup with bacon bits and sour cream.  No soup was left.

Lightly saute the onion and asperagus, don't use flour for creamy soups, prefer using a small potato that gets crushed to thicken the soup naturally adding more flavor and nutrition.

I really liked this, though I left out the sour cream and only used half the milk.  Next time, I think I'll omit the salt - I used chicken bullion cubes instead of chicken broth so I think this made it saltier than it needed to be.  Very good, though - will make again!

delicious, I left some of the spears to add at the end, next time I would puree everything. Also because I didn't have any sour cream, I used 1/4 c of low fat plain yogurt, it added some creaminess, with less fat.

Very Good.  I should have doubled the recipe.  Did use fat free half & half,  and served the soup with a dollop of sour cream on top instead of whisking it into the soup.

This soup turns out delicious. It's rich and has a creamy texture. The changes I made were I substituted skim milk for regular and instead of sour cream, I used non-fat greek yogurt. Yum :)

simple and delicious.  Slightly reduced the amount of butter to about 1.5 tbsp and the sour cream to about 1/4 cup.    This is very yummy!  Definitely will make again.

This is a great soup! I do not use sour cream, I use only skim milk and I keep the heads of the asparagus till the end then add them in. All who have eaten this really enjoyed it.

Great recipe.  I like the use of roux as a thickening agent.  I used a leek instead of onion, vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and evaporated skimmed milk and the soup was delicious.  I'll be making it again.

So simple and so amazingly tasty and impressive! I didn't have a fresh onion on had so I used those little dehydrated pieces and it was perfect....I made this with great results having never worked with fresh asparagus before, so how much easier can it really get? I used fat free sour cream and did 3/4 cream and 1/4 milk instead of just straight milk. I also went light on the lemon juice. I severed it with a dollop of sour cream, "homemade" pita chips sprayed with butter stuff, seasoned and baked and a sprinkling of cayenne pepper.  I'm a bit astounded at how easy it is to make and how delicious and impressive it tastes. Great recipe!

Followed recipe, EXCEPT pulled out the asparagus tips before pureeing (personal preference) and put them back into the finished soup later.  Wonderful - my husband and I both loved it!  Will definately make this again.  Thanks!

Hubby and I loved it! We didn't have sour cream on hand and I already went to the grocery store that day so instead I used 1/2 cup of cream cheese (minus about 1 1/2 tbs. We will make this again, but I will probably use even less cream cheese. Garnished it with the tips as per another reviewer and I added diced roasted red peppers to the rim to my dish. Great color! Great flavor!

Very easy.  I used asparagus that I overcooked on the grill the night before and leftover, cooked short-grain rice to thicken it.  The hand blender made quick work of the puree step.  Garnishes were some of the cooked heads and a little bit sour cream.

This tasted great!  It was a little pricey for the amount it made.  I think this was meant as a side dish, not an entree, so servings are small.  I made it just as written except that I added a bunch of seasonings (thyme, dill, celery seed, onion powder, etc.) due to other reviewers saying it was bland.  I let it warm up in the crock pot to give the soup time to absorb the flavors.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe! I've made it several times.  I cut the tips off and chop into small chunks, then I set them aside.  When you are ready to melt the butter- add the chopped pieces of tips to saute in the butter.  Also, I don't bother with the sour cream and use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.

FANTASTIC!!  I followed the recipe for the most part, though I didn't measure the onion (1/2 of a md) and I eliminated the salt & pepper (seemed salty enough I just don't like pepper).  I also added a heaping spoon of minced garlic.  This is just sooooo good!  The garlic I added did slightly overpower the asparagus so be aware of that if you choose to add it.  I used one "bunch" of asparagus-I will add about 1/2 bunch more next time.  I used skim milk and fat free sour cream, as well as 1/2 EVOO and 1/2 butter to lighten it up even more.  I will  be making this for my next dinner party (I'd take a pic, but it looks just like the one already there).  You won't be disappointed in this awesome soup!

OMG!!!!!!...I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I am an Asparagus HATER!!!, but hubby loves it.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and sauted asparagus and onion with a clove of garlic in a tablespoon of bacon fat before adding to the chicken broth, which I also added 1/2 cup white wine to broth, otherwise followed exactly.......this was fabulous.  I EVEN ATE IT, people I hate asparagus.  All three of my young children also enjoyed.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you thank you!

I am not a huge asparagus fan but I really enoyed this soup. I did make a few minor modifications. First, I did not use the entire aparagus stalk - the bottoms of the stalk are too tough so I discarded them. Additionally, I mixed 3 cloves of garlic in with the onion. I pureed half of the onion/garlic mix with the asparagus and used the other half in my flour butter roux.  I also reserved the tips of my asparagus before pureeing to make the soup seem more like a main dish (I may also add diced potatoes next time) - however if I were serving this as a first course I would have pureed everything. I also followed the other reviewers suggestion to cut the salt (I used half the recommend amount) - you can always add more salt later.

This recipe was great!  Simple and fresh tasting.  I actually only put in half the amount of milk and sour cream and still found it creamy enough.  This recipe is also a great base - next time I may play around with adding some different flavors in with it.

Great, but a little salty.  I'll just omit the salt next time, the chicken broth is sufficient.  I also saved the asparagus tips and threw them in mid-way with some leeks.  Will definitely make this again, thanks!

Yummy!, Bought a pound of fresh asparagus last week, my husband is not fond of the vegatable, had a vacation day today and knew I had to cook the asparagus soon, so I thought maybe I could get him to eat a cream soup,and found this recipe, I used a potatoe masher and not the blender, turned out wonderful. Gave him a little cheddar cheese on the top of the hot soup. He loved it.! My first time to use this web site.

Wow!

This was amazing...  Very gourmet looking, and the flavour was even better than I expected!!

I subbed the milk and sour cream for skim and fat free to cut down on the calories, and it was still very creamy and nice.  I'll bet its just to die for with the real thing.

Oh my God, was this good!  Doubled the recipe right off the bat, and so glad I did.  I also doubled the amount of asparagus used for each batch, but didn't puree that amount.  (My husband likes chunks in his soup.)  This rivaled the cream of asparagus soup that we occasionally have at a local restaurant...truely restaurant quality.  This would be wonderful with Easter dinner!

Since I can never follow a recipe exactly, I added some bacon crumbles to make it my own..... but, it wouldn't have mattered.  This is by far the best soup I have ever made or have ever tasted.  My family went bananas and I'm on my way to the store to get more asparagus!  And, it was SO easy!

Wonderful flavor and very easy to prepare. Very creamy without a lot of calories. I highly recommend this. You can also substitute broccoli and cheese for the asparagus and it too is delicious.

Generally, for first time recipes I make them as written.  I learned that from my mother 65 years ago.  As a husband that has served me well.

One should rate a recipe as written but I did make two modifications to this one.  I wilted the onion in butter before adding to the asparagus in deference to my spouse who can tell when I don't even is she was gone when I made the dish.  The other was using half and half instead of milk.  Both of us enjoy the richness of the half and half as we grew up on farms.

Other than those two minor modifications I made it as written though the asparagus was a little old.  It will be made again in this household.

This is a stellar recipie and I thank the person who submitted it.  Other than adding a small leek to the onion, made as directed.
I only wish I had a freezer to put this in so I could have it year round!  Simple, and absolutely perfect!  Might be nice with a quiche for lunch or light dinner.  Don't forget the lemon and a trick for the tough ends is to bend the asparagus till it breaks at the ends so you don't get the tough bits.

Was looking for a simple soup to make.  Very easy to make.  Followed the recipe to a T except that I used my immersion blender right in the pot that I cooked the onion and asparagus in.  I made the roux in a saucepot and added that to the Asparagus.  I doubled the recipe and I am glad that I did.  I used White Pepper instead of black pepper.
It was so so good.   We liked it so much, I will definitely make it again while Asparagus is in season.  Next time I might try it with the White Asparagus.

I really enjoyed this!  I followed the recipe as stated as far as ingredients. I did reserve some of the asparagus before I used my immersion blender on it because I like my soup to have some chunks in it. Thank you for sharing a wonderful soup!

This was delicious and I don't even like asparagus that much. I did exactly as written except I didn't have any lemon juice on hand. That would have probably been the little touch of magic to make this spectacular, but it was excellent without it. I will definitely use this again when I am given fresh asparagus. My husband hates asparagus and ate half of his bowl before asking what it was ;)

When I served this, I was worried it would be too bland. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't need to dip into the container of parmesan cheese I had put on the table. My most sceptical family member finished her bowl. Be warned, this recipe doesn't make a lot. Next time I might add a small clove of garlic, but nothing to overpower the asparagus.

This was a good soup, even without the sour cream and lemon juice (which I didn't have).  Will definitely try again.  I added pinch of red pepper flakes and garlic powder.  Topped with some good croutons.

Great !!  I went with keeping a couple of sprigs aside for each bowl and check this out,- add 1/4 cup of dry sherry during the last warm up.  It's phenomenal.

This soup was a bit bland for me.  Just my opinion.  Everyone's taste buds are different. I love asparagus and I feel the flavor of the asparagus was dulled in this soup.  I would prefer to just eat the asparagus all by itself, better for you and more flavor.  I may try it again and put my own spin on it to add some more flavor. :)

I went through almost 200 reviews to see if anyone else commented on this issue: since you lose almost 1/3 of each spear when you break off the woody ends do you use 1 lb of asparagus weighed before or after trimming? Many people talked about adding more asparagus to this recipe so it seems that the amount should matter in the final analysis. Did you 5 star raters use 1 lb of trimmed or un trimmed asparagus when you made it? Would like to know what the original author of this recipe would say.

I was able to make this tonight with ingredients on hand.  I did not use a food processor or blender to puree the cooked asparagus/onion/broth, I used my potato masher by hand, worked fine, wasn't completely pureed but still a bit chunky okay for me.  Loved it.  Will make again.

This soup is outstanding!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Made it exactly as written - no need to change anything - it's that perfect. Tastes like something you'd be served in a very expensive restaurant. My only "negative" comment would be that it only served 2 in our house, not 4 as it says in the recipe. Or did the 2 of us eat enough for 4 because it was so good?

I made this soup exactly by the recipe and it is OUTSTANDING!  I used the white European asparagus which is more flavorful and less stringy.  I will try green asparagus next time.  Perfect soup to take to a holiday gathering and expect amazing comments!

This is the best Cream of Asparagus soup I've ever had.  I followed his advice and followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't have any milk so I used half and half, but definitely no chocolate chips or pine cones) and it turned out fantastic.  I will never use any other recipe for cream of asparagus soup again!!

Delicious! I used more chicken broth than the recipe calls for, adding over a cup to the pot I steamed the asparagus in, because my pot was large and the 1/2 cup in the recipe wasn't really enough to cover the bottom.  I also left the lid on while steaming.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I tried using my stick blender to purée in the pot like I do with other soups, but the stringiness of the asparagus and low liquid level just didn't work.  So I dumped it all into the Vitamix, and that did the job.  And the soup tasted so good!

Absolutely delicious and made no changes except since I am an expat in the country of Panama and fresh asparagus is difficult to find so I used 2 cans of asparagus.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I like asparagus but after eating them grilled kinda get over it. Now thanks to you I found a new way to it them, the only difference I added spinach to enrich in vitamins. :)

I had leftover asparagus from Christmas, so put it to good use.  I liked the recipe, however, next time I would not add the sour cream as it changed the flavor substantially. When I make it again, I will use half milk and half cream and eliminate the sour cream and lemon!

Normally I read the comments on the recipes and take consideration of some of the suggestions and mix in a little of my culinary opinion, but this time I decided to follow the advice to some and leave the recipe alone.  Huge mistake.  This is the saltiest soup I have ever eaten in my life.  I really feel stupid for not noticing the amount of salt I was putting in.  Now I am trying to figure out how to salvage this sea water.  Would have been a great recipe if I halved the salt content.

I thought this was okay. Make sure to blend the aspargus mixture well in the blender. I thought I had, but I still ended up with some fiberous pieces. I would even suggest straining the final soup. It will blend all of the sour cream in well doing that also. My only other suggestion is using homemade broth or low sodium broth along with adding the salt to taste. I found this to be very salty. I liked the pronounced asparagus flavor, the saltiness just kind of over-powered the flavor some.

Wow. Just wow. This was absolutely delicious. The one and only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of 1 tsp salt (already enough salt in the chicken broth). It was easy and by far the best cream of anything soup I've ever made or eaten. My husband wanted me to make it again the next day but requested a double batch. It actually reheated quite nicely. Love, love, love.

This was really great!  Picked my own asparagus and followed the recipe.  Made quite a bit of soup for a single person, but it was just as good the next day.  Recipe came together very easily -- I'll be making this one again!

Very good.  I omitted the butter and flour part to eliminate gluten. It did not need it as it was thick enough without it. Delicious and will make again.

Wow! What a great way to use some extra asparagus I threw in the freezer. I subbed in veggie broth cuz my BF doesn't eat meat stock. Also used Fage greek yogurt (whole) instead of sour cream, and a lime instead of lemon since that was in the house. This came out ridiculously good - so simple! Thank you!

Delicious.  I followed the recipe, I didn't have a full 1/2 cup of sour cream, though.  It didn't matter, there wasn't a drop of soup left after dinner.  Even my daughter that "doesn't eat asparagus" loved it.  I saved some of the heads and steamed them in the microwave to add to the soup at the end, but it wasn't really necessary (still good, though).  I'll make this again for sure.

Used 1/2 cup of greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that was all I had on hand.  Came out delicious.  Very good recipe.  It probably would have came out just as good with the sour cream.

YUM!!!  First, I apologize that I'm rating this without preparing it as written, but I'm married to a vegan (culinary sad face), so I'm limited in the ingredients I can use.  
I'm here to tell ya', if it was this good with my modifications, I can't imagine how amazing it would be as published.  
Here's a list of what I changed:
* Used miso soup in place of the chicken broth
*  Omitted black pepper (that was my choice--I detest the stuff)
* Used almond milk instead of cow
* Omitted sour cream 
* Forgot to use the lemon juice

As you can see, though the modifications were rather numerous, they didn't serve to substantially chance the flavor--just save some heated marital "discussion".  You'll notice I DID leave in the butter.  I've learned what a vegan doesn't know won't hurt them (teehee), and it's hard to get a roux to thicken without it.  

With that said, this will be moving to our "family favorites" list.  Couldn't get enough!  The only thing I changed that I think would really make any difference in the flavor is the sour cream.  I'll definitely try to remember to add a dollop to my bowl next time I make it (I got it out this time, but--like the lemon--forgot to use it).

This tastes awesome!!!
I think way better taste than restaurant.
I just put more half and half cream without sour cream as there's no sour cream at home sadly.
Next time I will try again with sour cream.
I am having with bread and it's really good!

WOW!  Asparagus is generally mediocre to my husband and I. The other day, we made the asparagus and garlic with butter but from now on, we will make this soup instead.  This is amazing and we licked every drop left from the pot!  I didn't have lemon juice so i omitted it.  I also didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted it with natural greek yogurt.  Used a cup of fat free milk and it still turned out AMAZING (not to mention healthy too)!  Next time, I think i'll add a tablespoon of less butter, only to make it even healthier.  You won't go wrong with this recipe.  Everything else, i followed it to a tee.  Awesome!

wow--what a great, simple, and flavorful soup. I love that it uses ingredients we tend to have around. It was also good reheated the next day (we reheated it without boiling it). With a baguette or sandwich, you've got a simple meal.

I love this recipe. It is so delicious. I am pregnant with twins and need to get more greens in my diet. Tonight, I added a bag of baby spinach into the onion asparagus mixture. It was great. I like this recipe both ways. I could eat this several nights a week.

This is so delicious! A new favorite soup for sure. Bob in Houston was right about making the recipe as is. However, we diiid use half and half instead of milk to get a richer flavor...will try regular milk next time just to compare!

I followed the recipe exactly, but for adding two peeled, diced red potatoes to the asparagus when cooking; I'd seen this ingredient in a similar recipe and thought it might add a bit more body to the soup.  The finished soup was light, fresh, and a perfect companion to some crusty bread, a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and a spring evening.  It's easy to make on a weeknight, yet elegant enough to serve at a dinner party.  Wonderful!

Great soup! Really easy to make, and really tasty. Like everything I make I tweaked it to my own tastes, I added some broccoli (about 1 head), garlic (1-2 cloves), and topped each bowl with some shredded cheddar cheese

Excellent! I cut the recipe in half, and ate the soup for twice for dinner (for 2) and once for lunch. I also added a skinned/chopped potato to the recipe, let it simmer for about 15/20 min in the broth. I think it really made it.  Forgot to add the lemon juice. Nevertheless, it turned out great!

I am eating this right now :)  I made the recipe as-is and it is really good.  If you use skim milk and reduced fat sour cream it's pretty healthy and it was really easy to make too.  I might up the asparagus or lower the sour cream to make it more intensely asparagus-y though.  I think bacon or ham would be nice in it too.  If you can, use homemade chicken stock.  My guy made some over the weekend and I think it makes a great difference!

Great recipe. While my family gobbled it up I think I will use less sour cream next time...maybe 1/3 cup. I also added dill which is always a hit with my kids. Thank you...I will be keeping this one in my recipe box.

I was really impressed with this soup. It is uncomplicated in ingredients, therefore allowing the asparagus flavor to come through. Simple, healthy and delicious. Enjoyed by all, even my seven year old who was too full, after second helpings, for dessert!

My husband and I were very happy with the way this came out. I did a few modifications. I wanted to double the recipe but only had one pound asparagus so I added one pound of zucchini in place of a 2nd pound of asparagus. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Even with the zucchini it very good.

This is super good but instead of bringing to boil the asparagus,onions and chicken broth I sautee the onions with butter until translucent and then add the asparagus and chicken broth until boil. This gives a better flavor to the soup I thought.

I made this for my mom when she had surgery and could only eat liquid food.  She absolutely loved it.  I really liked it too but found that there was just a tad too much sour cream.  I would not put as much sour cream in the next time.  But, I definitely will use this recipe again.

I use as much native asparagus as possible when it is in season and decided to try a soup for the first time.  This was easy and yummy.  I sauteed the onion and a few garlic cloves first.  I added a little white wine as it simmered.  And at the end, after mixing the puree with the roux, I whisked half and half into the mixture until I felt it was the right consistency (omitting the milk and sour cream).  A dash of cayenne and the juice from 2 lemon wedges brought it to perfection!  The family ate the whole batch in one serving.

This soup is easy, delicious, and very elegant. I garnished it with a swirl of sour cream as in the photo, and then topped with a few home made croutons. It is perfect....don't change a thing.

Simple and utterly delicious.  I had to use cream because I was out of milk.  Sublime.  Note - I didn't have a problem with stringiness after the puree but I do use a VitaMix blender.

Doubled the recipe. Didn't add any milk or sour cream (I had bought soy milk and vegan "sour cream" to add but decided against it because it had the perfect consistency). Added a bit more fresh lemon juice than the recipe called for. It was absolutely delicious!

This is an easy and delicious soup. I added chopped garlic to the asparagus/onion mixture while on the stovetop. I also added fresh dill prior to mixing it in blender. I used nonfat milk and low-fat sour cream and you would never know the difference. I also used black olive salt which added another layer of flavor that was amazing! I will definitely make this again.

I have a family member who needs to have everything pureed. I made this for him and my hubby and I. I didn't change a thing. It was wonderful. I loved the creaminess the sour cream gave it and the tangy back flavor of the lemon juice. I am now going to try substituting spinach and see if it holds up as well. Thanks for a lovely recipe.

This is outstanding!  I'm a bit sensitive to dairy, so I'm trying without the sour cream addition and it's delicious!  My first time making asparagus soup and I coudn't be happier with how it turned out.

So far my favorite asparagus soup recipe from this site that I have tried. I did things a li,ttle differently just so I could tend to my chaotic household! I placed a can of chicken broth, onions, and asparagus in the crockpot so when I was ready to cook dinner, that was already done. So when making the flour/butter mixture, I added a little extra chicken broth so I probably used about a can and a half total. Add a splash of sherry wine with that too! This was quick and easy. I served it up in bread bowls. Delicious!

Great flavor.  This was very easy and quick to prepare.  I didnt use all the sour cream/soup mixture at the end, because I thought it sounded like too much sour cream.  I was afraid that combined with the lemon it would have been overwhelmingly sour, but it wasn't.  It was mild and creamy.  I also forgot to add salt and pepper but added at the table.  Really didnt need it.  The complex flavor of the roux was tasty enough.  Perhaps also because I used salted butter.  Excellent soup!

This soup is just fabulous!  I am not a big fan of plain, cooked asparagus.  I tried asparagus soup one day when someone else made it and I just loved it.  I searched for a recipe that had ingredients that I liked and that I thought sounded good.  This recipe is hands-down a favorite in our house.  My husband, who has never been a big vegetable fan until recently, LOVES this soup.  I even added a small clove of garlic to the recipe once and it was great.  You smell the garlic more than you taste it.  Be sure not to add too much garlic as you don't want to overpower the soup.  This is great with some crusty bread or some parmesan crisps (parmesan cheese that you shred and then bake in the oven until melted and slightly golden brown).  Very fabulous.  This is a keeper in my household!  I have made it at least four times already and wouldn't hesitate making this soup weekly:))

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because my husband and daughter didn't like it. I however loved it and ate two bowls of the stuff. My husband and daughter said it was a bit too rich. I thought it had a great flavor and wasn't that rich at all.

Very good.  The sour cream and lemon at serving are a nice touch.  It received good reviews at a recent potluck.  Be sure to remove the big ends of the asparagus.  If the ends are too tough they leave strings (like celery strings) in the soup.

The main flavor of this soup was the chicken broth and not the asparagus.  It was okay, but not at all what I was hoping for.  My husband did not like it.  I wouldn't make it again.

This soup was good, although I added a lot of my own seasoning (garlic, dill). The real problem with this recipe, is that even after adding extra milk and almost twice the chicken broth and a little white wine, I still had little more than two bowls worth of soup. If your going to go through all the trouble of making this, wouldn't you like to at least have enough?? I strongly suggest doubling or even tripling the recipe.

This is one of my new favorite soups!  I consider myself a soup connoisseur and was looking for something fun to try with all this asparagus that's on sale right now... This is it!  It's creamy and light/fresh at the same time.

Yummy!  Be careful with that liquid level when cooking the asparagus and onions---that 1/2-cup disappears quickly.  I served six cups, instead of four bowls.  It's rich, so that was enough.  The kids even liked it.

This recipe was quick and easy. I used fat free evaporate milk instead of milk. Just took away a few calories and made it a little creamier. It was EXCELLENT.

EXCELLENT! I left out more asparagus tips and put them in the soup whole (cooked) so it's not totally liquified. I also used Light sour cream which was also a great choice and lowers the calories a little bit!

Truely a wonderful homemade soup. Very easy to make. I wasn't sure the "man" liked it very much until he began hunting for leftovers, of which there were none! Make sure you soak and rinse the asparagus well. I could detect a bit of grit. (entirely my fault). My 10 year old liked it too. Next time I will reserve some asparagus tips for a varied texture. Thank you for this yummy recipe.

What a rich and creamy soup!! I served this soup to my husband on a cold and rainy night, along with a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  We both loved it!! There was a little left over, and I used it for a quick sauce with a vegetable side dish the next night.

Wicked awesome!!!  My friend who ate some of the batch I cooked last week is sitting before me still raving about it right now. I didn't have all the sour cream, so I substituted some jarred alfredo sauce instead, and it turn out great!  You must try this recipe!!!

Great Soup, I loved it and so did my family. The only changes I made was that I only pureed half of the asparagus and cut the rest into smaller pieces to give it some texture. This soup was also easy enough for me to make, and I'm only 13, all in all great recipe. I will definatly make it again.

This was quite good! It needs some grated cheese just before serving (I used Parmesan but Cheddar would probably be good, too), and I also added a few crackers. We had this for dinner with a salad.

I loved this soup. I steamed the asparagus tops separately and added them at the end. One change I will make next time is to not add the salt it calls for. With the full-sodium chicken broth I think it's bordering on too salty.

I had never had asparagus soup before, and this was better than expected.  It's a great way to sneak in some veggies.  A chef friend suggested adding a pinch of cinnamon to cut out any bitter taste.

Left out the butter and mixed 1/4 cup cornstarch with the milk for the thickening part. Also used light sour cream and 1% milk. Cut off tips and added at end too. Made it only 120 calories per serving and low carb as well. Delicious!!

This is a great recipe. Tastes like a gourmet soup you would pay fifteen dollars a bowl for at a fancy restaurant! :)
I had some leftover french onion soup that I used in place of the onions and some of the liquid. It was very good. I don't have any more french onion soup, so I will definately saute the onions this time before adding them.

Great flavor.  The lemon really blends well with the asparagus.  Used fat free half and half instead of milk and fat free sour cream and you would never know it.  Also, I sauteed the onion in the butter, then added the asparagus and cooked.  Rather than pureeing at this point, added the other ingredients (except sour cream and lemon) omitted the flour and added 1 Tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water and simmered till it thickened, then added the sour cream and lemon.  Used a hand blender to puree it at the end.

A very nice simple recipe that hits the spot.  I used Creme Fraiche instead of milk and sour cream.  Also cut off the tips of the asparagus and boiled them in salt water for about 4 minutes, saved them for garnish and I sauteed my onions in the beginning.

I served this soup at a dinner party.  Everyone loved it.  I did not have sour cream so I substituted non-fat yogurt and used 1% milk.  It was so good and did cut a few calories.  I will make this soup often.

I just got a hand blender and was looking for an easy recipe to try it out.  Pleasently surprised!Easy and good, what else could you ask for?  I didn't add the sour cream to the entire batch.  Just added it to separate servings, and still great.  A must try!

We love fresh asparagus in the spring. We were hesitant to add it to soup, thinking that we might be wasting it. How incredibly wrong we were!! It is an incredible soup-creamy, yet light. The kids even raved about what a great cook I am!

Quick, easy, tasty.  What more could you ask for.  Cut the calories by using low-fat broth, skim milk and light sour cream (not nonfat).  Couldn't tell the difference.

Actually , this is fairly good as written. I gave it only 4 stars b/c I feel it NEEDS  more seasoning.  I made this in the early spring, when fresh asparagus was just starting to come out.

 2nd time I made this I used low sodium chicken stock in a box, Added a scant  teaspoon ish teaspoon of dried thyme leaves ( GROUND would be less) And 2 lg fresh garlic cloves minced. Plus a good  couple of twists of cracked pepper.  To the flour, i added a pinch of garlic powder, a pinch of penzys dried shallot powder ( awsome stuff) The added seasoning made it much better for my taste., and worthy of 5 stars
One thing I did notice is that reviews who used vegetable stock, reported a bland taste review.. A tip for or clarity, I think the directions should read " temper in some  hot broth, a bit at a time into the room temp  sour cream, before adding to the soup" . Personally, I just serve  sour cream on the side, and use half & half  in place of milk. Or just use whole milk .

Fresh, bright and yummy!
I made three changes:
1)  I doubled the asparagus to achieve really great asparagus flavor.
2)  I added a Tbsp dried parsley.
3)  I added 1-1/2 tsp dried thyme.
Also, don't be afraid to add a little extra lemon juice, especially if you doubled the asparagus.  Be sure to use large stalks!

I loved this recipe.  Admittedly, like others, I added a bit more seasoning:  raw garlic, extra onion,  garlic and onion powders, more pepper.  But it was so good before the final step that I didn't feel the need for sour cream!  It was rich enough as is.

Really good!  Made it exactly as described and it was delicious, with a bit more ground pepper and parmesan cheese.  Used chicken broth cubes instead of canned broth and it was fine.  Very easy and straightforward.  I liked that it didn't use whipping cream and so felt healthier.

I made this tonight with no alterations. It was great. Served with my homemade croutons. It was not bland, just nice. My husband and I both commented that this would also be good with bacon bits or chopped up ham in it. It's a bit of work and clean up, but well worth it.

Super easy and super delicious.  I used half and half instead of milk, and creme fraiche instead of sour cream just because I had them leftover.

So good and easy, my daughter who doesn't eat asparagus loved it, in fact I was going to add grated cheese and she said it was so good not to add cheese, pretty cool from a 16 year old.

This is a good guideline. As someone who saves / freezes asparagus ends all season, I steamed them first,  retaining water, then simmered with added chicken broth with herbs and garlic.  Blended, but sieved out woody fibers and then proceeded for a creamy soup while keeping all the nutrients. Don't waste your asparagus ends. You can enrich this recipe with boiled potato as well.

Super delicious, and very easy. Unless you are feeling especially decadent, don't follow the temptation to add heavy cream or 1/2 and 1/2 (as I sometimes do with cream soups) to make it richer. It's plenty hearty and delicious without piling on more calories. Excellent recipe!

I have been making this many times now and my family and friends all love it! The only change I made is I  doubled the recipe, added 2 cloves of garlic and only used 1/4 cup half and half and 1/4 cup milk. Thank you very much for this delicious recipe.

A friend and I were craving asparagus soup and tried this recipe.  After reading the reviews I did two things - I doubled the recipe and saved some of the cooked asparagus tips for garnish.  I didn’t change one thing - no added pine cones or 20 cloves of garlic.  Simply the best asparagus soup we’ve ever had.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Awesome and easy! Went out and bought more asparagus before it is out of season just to make again , and will hopefully have enough to freeze.  Followed recipe exactly except for adding sour cream. Perfect for casual or guests.

I made this soup using the ingredients exactly as listed, then used my immersion blender for the blending.  The resulting soup was amazing!   For my second bowl I added a little crushed red pepper flakes for a kick, I like a little kick, and that was great as well.

This soup is just delicious. Made it according to the recipe and it blew my mind. I'm a spice girl and like pumped up flavor so I was a little worried, especially when I saw the "it's bland" review. I thought it perfect and I know it will become a favorite.

I made the recipe as is and it was wonderful.  Had a mix of leftover and fresh asparagus that I cooked all together.  Also enjoyed the scallop in the center.
Only thing that didn't happen were the tips crossed on top of the scallop because I forgot to fish them out of the pan before blending !!!  Next time.

I’ve never successfully made soup before, of any kind.  It’s been OK, but nothing to write home about.  I had a bunch of asparagus stems left over from pickling, so thought I would give this a shot since I had all the ingredients on hand.  Holy cow, this stuff was great!  And sooooo simple!  Only thing I would do next time would be to reduce the salt a bit.  Thanks!

DEFINITELY make again! I have asparagus bed and it's producing pretty heavily right now. Trimmed the woody parts, didn't blend it till smooth cuz I like it a little chunky, added paremsan and topped with a sprinkle of bacon. Came together quickly and was delicious!

I used fat few half and half in place of the milk.  I didn’t have. As much asparagus as it called for, in fat, about half as much, but it was still very good.  Served it to a ladies group and they loved it!  I will definitely make it again.

I used heavy cream instead of sour cream and no lemon. Everyone loved it. Make sure you blend it well .  Needed to blend a second time to get it smooth.

Very refreshing.  I didn't make the sour cream mix, instead just dolloped plain Greek yogurt on top with a squirt of lemon.  Amazing.  A girl I work with grabbed a spoon and dug into my bowl!  She was so excited, said her mom used to make it for her when she was a little girl many years ago.  She'll be making it herself now.   Very good.

Delicious soup!  I used two bunches asparagus and cut off about 1/3 stalks, a little over a pound.  I added more broth to the boil, more like a cup, and much if it evaporated.  I used 3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons flour fior the roux.  Needed more salt to my taste than recipe called to finish, and I used white pepper.  The finished product was restaurant quality.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, loved the tang from the lemon and sour cream.!

I made this several times last season and this year my notes on the printer version are wearing out from use, I printed a fresh copy and looked closer at the garnish. What is that under the spears ? I have cooked this as written and love it, and have experimented with cream instead of milk, a lot of tender tips for the garnish, and I'm a red pepper kin of guy  so I like to sprinkle some on top as well.

This was wonderful! It was so creamy and fresh. I topped it with some crispy bits of ham and a drizzle of cream mixed with a little cayenne.

I just made this soup. Like the other reviews, i tweaked it a bit. I added bacon, cooked the asparagus and onions, added garlic and celery, in some of the bacon grease. I used a  an electric hand blender instead and used less than 1/2 c of the sour cream.Its really quite bland, thus the bacon bits would add to the flavor.

This is so good! I left the asparagus tips in bite size chunks and puréed the rest. I’m really glad I doubled the recipe! The sour cream and lemon added a perfect little tartness that kept it from feeling too heavy. Really good, will definitely make again.

I used fat free chicken broth and fat free Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.

This was super easy to make and so satisfying to eat.

We used yogurt for the sour cream, and still enjoyed every bite. I would otherwise recommend following the recipe. We will be making this again soon (and doubling the recipe!).

I doubled this recipe so I could have it for a few days. I had no sour cream so used 1 cup of half and half instead. I found it silky, rich, and delicious even without the sour cream. Everything else I did exactly as recommended, except I omitted the lemon as I'm not a huge fan of lemon with savory. Will make again!

Easy to make & simply delicious.  What a wonderful meal with salad & French bread.  I used unsalted stock and salted to taste.

I sautéed the chopped onion in butter before adding the asparagus.  Added a little richer flavor.  Otherwise I made it as the receipt calls for.

I broiled the asparagus and onions with a bit of olive oil and sea salt, used heavy whipping cream and finished off the soup with a few dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce. Never any leftovers with this soup!

Easy and wonderfully tasty. I didn't bother to sieve it, the fibrous bits were no problem. I saved the pretty tips and only put them into the soup with the sour cream for the last few minutes.

I am a professional cook and always looking for ways to up my game. I used another basic cream of asparagus soup recipe with all the same basic ingredients, but with one exception. The addition of the sour cream really added a WOW factor to my soup.  Best cream of asparagus soup I've tried.

I made this today and garnished it with sliced hard-boiled eggs and a sprinkle of paprika. It was amazing! I used an immersion blender & it worked great. I will definitely make this for a first course at a future dinner party.

Instead of chicken broth I added a stock I made from the leftovers from a broasted store bought chicken, carrots, onions, celery, etc. Also added a bit of parmesan cheese at the end for a flair of flavor. We are making more with local asparagus and will freeze for later use.

REALLY GOOD RECIPE!!
As I typically do, I followed the recipe EXACTLY the first time through ....... VERY tasty ..... but I needed to "jazz" it a little so the second time through I added a tsp. of garlic powder and almost a tsp. of red pepper flakes. I was concerned that my picky wife wouldn't care for it the first time but she did and LOVED it the second time.
If you follow the instructions EXACTLY you will enjoy it, if you like a bit more "pop" add the extra spices.

This soup is wonderful, all I did was add a minced clove of garlic and wee bit more salt.  I topped mine with fresh grated Parmesan cheese just before eating. I gave some to friends and they loved it as well with dollop of sour cream and Chives on top.

I did add a clover of garlic.... I added about 3/4 the a cup of the asparagus tips, just before it was done. When serving I like to top mine with a few shakes of hot sauce.
Delicious recipe.... It's a keeper!

what i love about this is the simplicity of flavor. the only thing i did different was add some diced potatoes and i dont use sour cream, I'm a long time yogurt lover. Oh...and a bit of fresh dill.

This was a big hit. I had some leftover white asparagus that I blended with a little of the cooking water. The only other change was that I used more asparagus broth in place of the  chicken since I was out of chicken broth. I added chicken bouillon for flavor. I want to make this again with green fresh asparagus.

I did alter this but mostly just my own style and timing. I used the same ingredients of the original poster. Easiest soup I've ever made and really tasty! Thanks for sharing!

I added a few leeks with the onions and used evaporated milk instead of milk and sour cream. I also add about 1/4 cup of quinoa and purée after the quinoa and asparagus are tender. It was delicious and I've made it twice in one week.

Came out very good. Wish i would of added more chicken both to make it not so thick,and used a strain(screen)to catch the strings of the asparagus that did not puree.

This soup is so good I don't even know where to start.   All I know is I rushed back to the computer to make sure it landed in my "Best of the Best" folder.   I followed the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.    Like others suggested, I saved just the asparagus tops to be used as a garnish on the soup when served and also seared some scallops to place in the center just like the picture.      Couldn't wait for my husband to get home so I could serve this super easy, but elegant dinner with a side of toasted baguette.   HE LOVED IT!   This is restaurant quality all the way.

Made no changes and it was super!   Does take some time with the purée process but worth it.  Just be sure to cool a bit before the purée.

The flavor was really good, was fun to make... The only reason why I didn't give the highest review?...  It wasn't the recipe in itself,  I'm more a gumbo type person... Next time I will roast some extra asparagus in oven, cut it up small and add to it... I will make it again....

I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful. I did experience just a little bit of what people called "woody" pieces and now realize I cut too close to the ends. I can't wait to make it again and make it BETTER.

The recipe  was very flavorful but a little too sour creamy flavored for me.....and OMG the fat content.  Lol.  If I decided to make this again,  I would cut the sour cream by half and up the milk.   I also kept  part of the aasparagus whole as I like this soup a little chunky.

Very fresh, very easy.  I added some “heat”  with cayenne pepper, as I like a little more punch, but just my personal taste.  Will make again and serve to friends/family.

Followed the recipe to a T. It turned out. Tried it out of the pot. It was delicious. Tasted even better the next day after keeping it in the fridge overnight. Froze the remainder and tried it today still kept well. A great recipe. I will do it again when asparagus is on sale.

Used greek yogurt  since  I didn't have sour cream.  Used a bit less lemon juice.

Used about 4 cups asparagus.  Needed a little more broth to cover.

Really good!

I will make it again but expected a stronger asparagus flavour.  I think I will cut out the sour cream and see if that makes a difference.

Made exactly as stated.  Should have trimmed the asparagus a little more as there were some "tough" stems that made it a bit stringy.  Will definitely make this again.

Subbed Greek yogurt for sour cream as I didn't have sour cream on hand. Excellent soup, either way.

This has to be the best I’ve had! You can’t go wrong with it. Now I did sub veggie stock for the chicken stock because we are vegetarian, but this was the only change.

Actually I did not add sour cream or lemon.  With a whole chopped onion, I added a carrot, and simmered in a half stick of butter.  Then I added 2 heaping tablespoon of flour and mixed well.  I had 2 lbs. Of asparagus which I peeled, cut off tips and put them in a dish of water.  After trimming off ends, I added the asparagus and 2 cups of chicken broth.  You can substitute broth with 3 bouillon cubes and water.  Add salt and pepper.  When tender, puree all till smooth, add a cup of milk and half and half, a tsp. Of grated nutmeg, (to your taste) and shut off heat.  Add the tips and let sit.  Any additional s and p and when tips have softened, slurp it up!  Love it.

Delicious soup! Yummy way to have asparagus. The only substitution I made was to use gluten free all purpose flour instead of regular flour. I will save this recipe to make it again!

This is a delicious soup that my whole family loves. I have made many times and I keep the ingredients the same but simplify the cooking directions : I Sautee the onion in the butter for 5 minutes then add the asparagus pieces and Sautee few more minutes. Then I add the flour, stir and cook for couple of minutes then add all the chicken broth and let everything simmer 10 to 12 minutes, stirring few times. After that I add the milk. sour cream and lemon juice and use my immersion blender to blend everything in the same pot. I reheat and serve.

I love this recipe. It's delicious and fresh without being overly rich with cream. When I have them, I sprinkle the soup with crispy onions instead of croutons right before serving, and that's simply amazing. Another addition when I have them is sautéed shiitake mushrooms. Yum.

This was a good recipe.  I made it twice and the second time I mistakenly added too much milk.  I was debating how to thicken it (add more Roux perhaps) and a friend suggested I puree broccoli and add it which is what I did and it turned out that the broccoli complimented the asparagus quite well.

Made this recipe as written except that I had blanched and frozen asparagus instead of fresh. Adjusted veggie cooking time for that, and the soup is delicious.

Fast, easy and delicious. I had some asparagus in my frig that needed to be cooked and decided to look for something different, and not time consuming for lunch. I used my Vita Mix to blend until smooth. 
No need to tweek the recipe. Loved, loved it. So tasty and you could serve for dinner as an elegant pre-course.

Quick, easy & delicious, with just a few ingredients! I really like that it uses sour cream instead of heavy cream or half-and-half, because I nearly always have some low-fat sour cream on hand and didn't have to make an extra trip to the store to get cream.

Used vegetable broth and substituted the entire flour process with creme fraiche. Boiled the asparagus tips and used as a garnish along with swirls of heavy cream.

I didn't add the milk or the sour cream but added a tablespoon of yoghurt and a little cream. And I had to make sure that the flour dissolved well in warm water. Everyone loved it.

Delicious! I had 12 oz of frozen asparagus spears, so I reduced the quantities in the recipe a bit.  I microwaved the spears for 4 min and cut into ~1" pieces. I did the roux in a soup pot, then added the chicken stock, asparagus pieces, salt and pepper. Just cooked for about 5 min. I used non-dairy creamer, to which I gradually added a few ladles of the hot soup, then returned all to the pot with a little garlic powder. Cooked a bit, and then processed in two batches; returned to pot to heat. I would definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I just made Spicy Pickled Asparagus and after cutting them to fit the jars, I had just over a pound of left over stems. (I snapped the leftover bits and just used the tender parts), so I Googled Asparagus soup and found this recipe. I can't believe how good it turned out! I will be making this again for sure.

This is one of my favorite recipes!! I use yogurt instead of sour cream, but otherwise I follow it exactly. The lemon juice really adds a great dimension to the dish. I normally double the recipe since I go through it so quickly.

When I first made it, it had a weird taste, so I added another half of lemon juice, big mistake. I add sugar to counteract the  tartness, and added spices to recover from my blunder. I would just add more salt instead of another lemon.

Amazing!!!!! but i always use more broth and lemon juice to thin it out a bit and i salt and pepper to my taste  which is more than what is listed here.  I use NF milk and sour cream to keep the calories lower. This is my GO TO soup ! It's SO good.

I added diced ham to the recipe and my family loved it so much that I went out and bought three more bunches of asparagus and made a huge stock pot of the soup and then froze it for later.

I didn't make any changes. It is one of the best simple asparagus soup recipes I have ever done. 
Will definitely make it again. The only change I am going to make is add cut tops into it for some actual bites. My asparagus has finally cropped this year (3 years in the making).

This is really good and so simple.  I made it as posted, adding just a little salt and pepper at the end.  As another review said, don't skip the lemon.  I did use a hand blender rather than a conventional one and it came put perfectly smooth.  Tip - you need to "pounce" the hand blender on the asparagus as you go rather than submersing it as you would in a pot that's more liquidy.  Keep pouncing it around until it's all smooth and silky.  A few of my asparagus stems were a little on the woody side, but this method handled that just fine. No fibers or straining required.

Made this with just leftover stems from asparagus we had two nights ago (they were trimmed off before I cooked the tips for our dinner that night).  Followed the ingredient list and directions, but didn't measure anything--just estimated, except for the flour for the roux.  This soup was fantastic!  I would make it again in an instant. In fact since I have another bunch of asparagus in the fridge, I might.  Recipe was easy too.

My boyfriend is not a soup guy, so I knew I was talking a chance making this. I would take a picture of how mine turned out, but it's all gone! I was able to get one bowl of this and my boyfriend ate the rest! 

I made it exactly as the recipe reads, and it was amazing! I will definitely be making more!

THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!  My only change for next time is to maybe not puree it so much or leave some chopped bits to put in the soup at the end just for texture.  But my kids and husband crushed saltines in it too and LOVED it!!!

This is a lovely soup.  I used the recipe to rescue some wonderful fresh asparagus that got away from me and cooked to mush.  It turned out soooo good and I'm so happy to have found this recipe.

This was delicious! Being on a liguid diet after surgery I was looking for a receipe that was easy and that I had all of the ingredients. I didn't put in the onion (didn't feel like crying) and only had bottled lemon juice. Otherwise made as directed and I wasn't disappointed!! Yum Yum

I've made several different cream of asparagus soup recipes over the years and this was by far the best.  I didn't change anything.  It was very flavorful and easy.  My whole family loved it and I'm glad a doubled the batch so there was plenty for the next day.

This is by far the best soup I've ever tasted & it's very easy.  After seeing all the sodium in canned soup, I never buy it anymore.  It lends itself to substituting other veggies as well.  Broccoli, cucumbers, pumpkin, etc.  Just make another batch and froze it!

I've made this several times, and it always gets rave reviews!  The only thing that I do differently is that I save the tips and add them at the end. They are small and cook quickly and it gives the soup a lovely garnish.

Followed the recipe as closely as I could.  Not bad, but or me, the sour cream flavor was far too strong.  Next time I'll follow others' advice and sub the SC.

I made it according to the recipe and we enjoyed it.  I will try the recipe again.  The next time, I will have the sour cream as a side item rather than introduce it to the soup.  There were some guests who did not care for the "sour cream" taste.  thanks for sharing the recipe!

So I've been eating this gorgeous soup at a restaurant, and I don't even love asparagus ! So I decided to make it, since it's too expensive to buy it every other day and this was it ! THE EXACT SAME TASTE, I LOVE IT ! I just added some small cut asparagus pieces at the end and they added a nice touch to it, wouldn't change a thing in it.

First, sautéed the onion until softened,  then added cut up asparagas until tender, then added stock and puréed in blender.  Put back into stock pot and added whole milk and some half and half.  Served in 4 oz. plastic cups for soup shooters at our Christmas open house party.  Would give it 5 stars as it was a big hit at the party.

This recipe was delicious! Next time I may cut the sour cream in half, though, because that taste came through a bit more than I prefer. Great recipe as is!

Delicious. Made it twice in 24 hours! I doubled the recipe the second time. Followed the recipe exactly. 

I used home made chicken stock both times, but had to add some store bought stock to the second batch because my homemade stock ran about 1/3rd short.  Homemade stock is everything--learn ti make it--seriously, its easy and worth it! The second batch was too salty due to the addition of the store bought stock.

The first batch I pureed, as instructed, and it was the perfect texture and flavor with little bits of asparagus.

Loved it with a few changes. For my wheat allergy son,  I substitute a potato for thickening.  I also cut all the tips off to add to the soup about two minutes before finishing (gives a little crunch). My son requested his favorite add of a diced  potato into small bits (microwaved) and add to the two minutes before finishing to give it more chunky . My husband requested toasted garlic bread to go with it.

Really deepens the  authentic flavor of the asparagus and maintains a hearty consistency to the final stock. This is a solid base to add a few turkey bacon chips or some tasty mushroom bits.

I have made this five times and get rave reviews from friends.  the only variation I made is adding a little cayenne pepper to the butter/flour roux.  Gives it a little pizzazz (cooking term of art).  It is outstanding.  I see one person substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth - I did that one time with a similar mushroom soup recipe and was very disappointed.

When I say I'm going to make asparagus soup, the reactions are not positive at all. The idea of asparagus soup sounds so odd, but the taste is fantastic. Everyone who complains initially at the though of it, ends up loving it- even the no asparagus, no vegetable eaters. it's delicious hot or cold.

This is a restaurant quality soup.  I made as is except didn't use the sour cream or lemon juice.  I topped it with crushed chili lime cashews to add some texture.  Any nut would serve.  Definitely going to be my go-to recipe for using up asparagus!

This was very surprising! Sounded bland. I added some garlic and dried tarragon. It was fantastic! So creamy! I used the vitamix to purée . I will make this for my next dinner party.
Soooo delicious! Thank you for this recipe. Ummm good.
I did not use the flour but put a handful of cooked rice in the blender to thicken. It worked and gluten free!

I made a few alterations of course. I couldn't boil the onions, that made no sense to me. What tastes better, boiled onions or onions slow sauteed in butter? So I sauteed them with a little chopped fresh garlic in the butter and made them part of the roux. But I combined the roux with the asparagus/broth mixture and let it boil (stirring) for a few minutes before I pureed it with my immersion blender (love that thing!) Oh, yeah, I added a little parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp of half sharp paprika, a tiny bit of fresh ground nutmeg and some onion powder. And I doubled the recipe, ended up juicing an entire lemon to get that lemony tang I was looking for.

Will definitely make it again!! Even my picky husband said to make it again.  I was in a hurry, so didn't emulsify the asparagus.  Was fine for our liking.  Also, added about 2 oz cheddar cheese.  Very good.

This turned out really good and hit the spot. The only changes I did was add a carrot.  I sautéed the chopped onion and chopped carrot with butter until translucent and then added the chopped asparagus in the first step. I also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream. And only added half of the amount of milk, I like my soups thick.  I will defiantly make this again.

i didn't make any major changes... i used a leek instead of the onion as i had it in the fridge. i added a jalapeno because i like everything spicy, as well as a few shakes of cayenne. it turned out great. i'd give it 4 1/2 stars, but cannot figure out how to give 1/2 a star. i save the 5 stars for super exceptional recipes, which i seldom come across. but this recipe got compliments from the entire table of 10, one lady even saying it was the best soup she'd ever eaten. so it would have been 5 stars from her!

Had lots of fresh asparagus from my garden and found this recipe via Google search.  It is quick and easy to make plus you probably have all ingredients on hand.  Tastes fresh and smooth on the palate.  Delicious!

I didn't have vegetable broth at home so I used garlic, parsley, coriander and salted butter in the soup mixture. I used skim milk in place of milk and salted butter.... I skipped on the sour cream and it was still amazing. My family loved it.

I DO substitute vegetable broth and I always manage to forget to buy a lemon (or lemon juice)...aaaand I never purée the asparagus because I'm lazy, BUT we've made this pretty much to the T AT LEAST 5 times and it's AMAZING!! So yummy! (I've also make it using coconut milk instead of reg milk and that was surprisingly tasty!)

I used 40% milkfat heavy whipping cream instead of milk and served it with garlic sourdough croutons. So yummy! I would much rather get a recipe from here, than from the Food Network. Their recipes are always so bland that I have to add tons of my own ingredients to make it taste good!

I will definitely make this soup again for guests. My kids loved it better than eating plain asparagus. I did use cream rather than milk, and I added the sour cream direct to the pot and whisked it in. I would leave out the salt next time as I found the chicken stock would have been salty enough. We garnished with a few garlic butter croutons and a sprinkle of both Parmesan cheese and fresh ground black pepper.

I added about a cup and a half of broccoli to the asparagus and onion, because it was going to go bad soon. And a touch of celery salt and black pepper to each bowl just before serving

only because I was looking to make the soup healthier and less fattening, I cut the amount of milk, sour cream and flour/butter mixture in half.  Still tasted great!

I followed  the recipe but I refrigerated it after cooking and before adding lemon and sour cream.  When ready to serve I put a cup and a half  in microwave for 90 seconds then added a squirt of lemon and a dollop of sour cream.  Yummy and so creamy .  I will definitely do again. It was a great winter lunch!

This is incredible. Simple, flavorful, easy to make. Used 2 bunches of asparagus, bagged onions. Covered chopped asparagus with water and bouillon. After asparagus was tender I drained it and reserved broth while I puréed the asparagus. Then added broth back into the butter/flour mixture. Added purée and milk. Great soup. Thanks for a great recipe! Only thing I measured was the cup of milk.

DELICIOUS!!!!!
I tried this tonight to get rid of some asparagus languishing in the fridge.  The only change I made was to sub fat-free Greek yogurt for the sour cream (didn't have sour cream).  It turned out beautifully, although I probably could have left out the tsp of lemon juice since I had the yogurt.  Family was moaning.  Thanks so much  - I'll use this one a bunch!

I had used the tips in another recipe so used just stalks in this.  To be sure they were tender and no strings, I peeled and cut into 1" pieces.  When the stalk gets tough, discard. We love the fat spears and I always peel them...old Julia Child trick.

This is a really good basic soup recipe. While I followed it exactly this time, I would not hesitate to add my own touches the next time I use it. However, I have been looking for a recipe that has more of the fresh asparagus flavor.

This is a delicious soup. I double the recipe for extra guess. Before blending the asparagus I saved some tips to add to the soup later. I did not use milk but whole whipping cream and only used 6oz and not 8oz. I wanted the soup to be consistent but not too creamy. I used 3 cans of chicken broth. I always add ingredients slowly and taste as I go to make sure that it has enough salt, pepper, cream,etc. that way I just add or take away to please my taste. I watch the pepper my husband does not like anything spicy. Make sure that you cut the bottom of the asparagus where it is the whitest and tough you will know when you start cutting. You don't want your soup to have tough pieces. I think this is a wonderful soup recipe just like the Butternut squash soup you find in this site. Enjoy!

Fantastic use of my overgrowth of aparagus! I made as directed but when the time came to add the sour cream, I only had 1/4 cup, it still tasted great. Super easy for lunch, but I'm sure it would dazzle guests. Very light and refreshing. Next time, I'm going to try the scallops with it.

This is the best soup i've made to date. I actually did half asparagus and half zucchini. I can only use lactose free milk, but it was delicious regardless. I actually liked the flavor more without the sour cream. Thank u for a delicious soup.

This was really good.  I'm trying to be a good vegetarian, so I subbed "No Chicken Base" for the chicken broth, and I used olive oil instead of butter.  Other than that, I made it as written, and it was delicious.  I have also made it without the milk,and also with the milk but no sour cream, and again with the sour cream, but no milk...you get the point. It was delicious every way I prepared it, so if you're vegan, you could just skip the milk and sour cream rather than subbing with non-dairy milk. I'm glad I tried this recipe. I was really surprised that so few ingredients could make such a tasty soup.

Took a spoon full of chopped asparagus out before blending and added back in at the end for texture. Served with shaved Parmesan cheese and a few drops of white truffle oil. Was delicious impressed all of guests! Will make again and again!

I made this for lunch today and it turned out delicious. I didn't have the stock, so I used water. It was still great. I will make this again. I may try this using Broccoli. Thanks for posting this.

Delicious soup!  Great asparagus flavor.  Very fresh tasting.  I used half and half instead of milk.  I know it upped the fat content, but it tasted divine!  Everyone enjoyed it at dinner.

I don't normally leave reviews or comments for recipes but this one gets a WOW!! Best 3 letter word to describe this soup. So easy and so flavourfully delicious!  Made this soup as an appetizer to break my fast for the day today in Ramadan and just followed the recipe, without even tasting it prior to serving it turned out fantastic. Super easy to make - fool proof!

I made this and it's so good!! I did cheat and use Green giant Canned Asparagus. I really can't say enough about this it is delicious!! I think it could be made with any vegetable honestly.

Excellent!  Only thing I changed was I only added salt to taste rather than a whole tsp of it.  Everyone enjoyed this at the dinner table.

We grow our own asparagus and had way too much coming in this year.  I did not have any sour cream on hand but I made this recipe just the way it said without the sour cream and it was delicious and easy.  I will suggest processing 1/2 of the mixture in blender at a time,  I read that somewhere else.  I will make again but will buy the sour cream because I'm anxious to taste it with that.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I did different was strain the soup because some of the asparagus I had was stringy and I thought the texture was off because of it. Made a double batch and there was only about a cup left. Rave reviews from the entire family!

Love, love, love it. I made this the other night exactly as directed in the recipe. The balance between asparagus and onion were perfect. The sour cream was a very nice touch. The entire family loved it and I'll be making it again tonight since my husband has been asking for it.

I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great.  I should have stuck to the blender instead of the immersion hand blender I used, had a few pieces that didn't get  pureed. Very nice flavor but just not the WOW for me.  I will however, keep and may make again for the wonderful asparagus taste and ease of this recipe.

DELICIOUS!!! My husband thought it was a little too salty, so next time I'll only add a 1/2 tsp of salt, but I thought it was just perfect as is! Yum yum yum, can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe and I return to it time and time again. My only variation is my preference for broccoli instead of asparagus. It tastes wonderful! You can substitute with the broccoli and not change anything else.

Love this recipe. I don't use canned broth, instead I add water with chicken stock. Also, I add about an extra cup of milk to have more of this delicious soup and still turns out nice and creamy.
Thanks for recipe, great bases for other veggie cream soups too.

I made this for lunch as I had a bunch of asparagus and didn't know what to do with it. I did make some small tweaks to the recipe. I thought 1/2 c of stock wasn't enough to cover asparagus and onion to boil so I used all the required stock as well as added a bay leaf, 3 chunks of fresh ginger and two chopped tomatoes. For the rue, I just used more stock, so ingredients would have to change to 4 cups of stock, 2 for the first step and just shy of 2 cups to be whisked into the flour mix. I also used 2 Tbsp. of heavy cream with milk to make up the 1 cup of milk. It was delicious! Had 2 bowls

Hubby and I found this soup to be bland.  I admit to substituting veggie broth for chicken and I had to supplement the milk required with some half&half but these changes were not enough to impact the taste of the soup that much in my opinion.  I won't be repeating this one.

ooooo - this is the first I've ever had or made asparagus soup. It was delicious.  I love garlic and spice so I added a clove of garlic (softened with the asparagus) and some red cayenne pepper along with the black pepper.

My husbands new favorite soup! I didn't have chicken stock so I substituted water and 2 chicken bullion cubes. If you are using these I would suggest to hold off on the salt then add to taste. Before I realized there was no garlic in this soup I already minced two cloves so I threw them in the pot. I also cooked the asparagus in the stock and pureed everything together with my hand held blender. I wanted to save a step. It was also just as good w/o the sour cream. Delish!

Excellent soup, and fairly easy to make. I tried it as written, except I had a few mushrooms on hand, which I pureed with the asparagus.

I also tried it with Greek Yogurt. The flavor was very similar and equally good, but it didn't have quite the creaminess. But, that is to be expected.

This is a very yummy recipe.  We had an abundance of wild asparagus, so was glad to find this recipe.  I used some green onion though instead of onion. Absolutely wonderful!

ah. maze. ing. this recipe was fantastic - simple to make, yet so elegant.  ingredient-wise, i followed the recipe exactly.  however, since my immersion blender rarely gets used, i thought this would be a great recipe to use it on.  once the asparagus and onions were cooked, i used the immersion blender to roughly puree them.  i then made the roux/chicken broth mix in a separate pan and added to the puree.  used the immersion blender again until smooth.  then finished the rest of the recipe.  it was just so light and creamy. my husband is not a huge asparagus fan, but LOVED this. will be making again and again.

I'm trying to get rid of all the food in my kitchen and thought I would try this with the frozen asparagus in my freezer. It still turned out great! Will definitely make again.

This recipe is delicious!  I made it for my husband's parents and his mother said that it was the best soup she had ever tasted.  The only thing that I did differently was to not puree the vegetables~I like the chunks of asparagus.  (that also made the recipe even easier & saved time!)

3.5 stars.  I liked this but think it needs "something".  I added garlic to the asparagus/onion mixture, and used fat free sour cream and 1% milk.  Topped with a little sour cream and some parmesean cheese.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I couldn't find my blender (thank you, teenage girls!), so I used my food processor and it was probably not as smooth as a blender would make it, but the taste and texture both were outstanding!!!

new favorite soup! i wont use any other recipe! all i changed, was that i doubbled the recipe and i made my own vegetarian broth. i put some carrots, mushrooms, onions, garlic powder, and garlic. i let that boil in water for 45 minutes then drained the liquid and used that instead of chicken broth. best soup ever! and super easy to make.

This is the best cream of asparagus I have ever had minus too much salt.  Next time I will had 1 tsp. instead of 2 tsp.  It was delicious!!!  I saved the tips of the asparagus, steamed separately and added at the very end.  I never blend those.   They are too yummy!

This soup is awesome.  I had a bunch of leftover asparagus so I decided to try it out, and I'm so glad I did.  I don't have a scale so I don't know exactly how much asparagus I added, but I imagine it's less than a pound - it could've used more.  The only changes I made were to add garlic powder and a bit of red pepper, and I used cream instead of milk since I needed to get rid of it.  I also skipped the lemon because I don't have any, but it tastes fine without.

This comes out as a very nice and very creamy asparagus soup. My only desire was that there was more of an asparagus taste to it.. either the onions or the stock or the combination thereof were just a little overpowering. So if i made it again i'd probably use less onions.  I'd imagine this is a pretty nice soup for people who aren't crazy about asparagus.

This is a great recipe, very flavorful.  I didn't have any sour cream so I just used a little more milk and I substituted olive oil for the butter.  I also added dried dill and onion powder.  I would definitely make this again.

This is one of the best soups I've ever had! I double the asparagus & only process 1/2 of it so I still have chunks of asparagus. Double the chicken broth also. Top it w/shredded cheddar before serving. Heavenly!

Simple recipe.  GREAT soup!  We've enjoyed this several times and it actually gets my toddler to eat asparagus.  I reduce and sometimes omit the sour cream, add some dill and extra lemon juice.

Definitely "5-Star"!  I made this according to recipe using organice free range chicken broth, sea salt and fat free milk.  Topped it with a dollop of sour cream, sprinkling of 6-Cheese blend, asparagus tips and freshly ground pepper.  Served it with blue corn tortilla chips.  Looking forward to leftovers!  Thanks, Marbalet, for a great recipe!

I needed a good use for some asparagus that had partially frozen (darn fridge) and I found a great one! This soup is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be happier with the results. I picked out a number of tips before pureeing and used them as a garnish. I will definitely make this soup again.

Great and simple! To make it even faster (and because I have a really small blender), I usually boil the asparagus in the microwave before puréeing and adding to the broth. I add 1/4 tsp crushed red peppers and 1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 1-2 cloves minced garlic, if I have the time). If I omit the onion, I also add about 1 tsp onion powder. Great recipe!

I saved and froze all the woody ends of the asparagus. After I pureed I used a sieve to remove the stocky pulp which didn't puree well. Came out tasting great. A little more work but worth it because I didn't want to waste any aspargus.

Will do again!!  Made this soup today.   Didn't have fresh asparagus, so used frozen.  Added some parmesan cheese as someone suggested.  Turned out great! Husband says it rates more than 5 stars.

I have never tried cooking cream soups before, but I tried this one and it was very easy, and terriffic! The only thing I changed was keeping the asparagus in one inch pieces instead of blending it with the broth and onions and that was the way to go! Next time I plan on adding fresh garlic to the onions and I plan on using the same base for a cream of mushroom soup next week, the possibilities are endless,lol. By the way, I have 4 daughters ages 3-10 and they all loved it!!!

Great Recipe, I just made a few adjustments.Added 1/2 cup of red pepper for tast and color, then I broiled some bacon and added it to the puree. And then I added a pinch of cumin, garlic powder, and some cayenne pepper.(make it a little spicy). Fantasticly easy and yummy. :)

I've made this soup several times and everyone always loves it! I like to saute the onion, along with 3-4 cloves of garlic, for about 5 minutes before adding the broth. Before pureeing, I set aside at least 1/2 cup of the asparagus to add back to the finished soup. I also use fat free half & half instead of milk. Soooo good

I followed the recipe exactly (don't forget to snap off the bottoms of the asparagus, which the recipe forgets to tell you), and we loved it. Beautiful green color, smooth, rich flavor.

This was easy, and very tasty. The only thing I changed is 1) I doubled the recipe, and 2) at the end of cooking I added shredded parmesan cheese and stirred until just melted (about 1/2 cup, but add more or less to your liking), and then when served, garnished with a sprinkle of shredded parmesan and some ground black pepper. Delicious!

This recipe is quick and delicious.  I doubled the lemon juice (personal taste) and used 1/2 cup of regular cream instead of the sour cream, just poured it right in. Next time I will double the whole recipe!

I cooked 3 slices of center cut bacon and used the fat from that to saute the onion and asparagus. I also added about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. It turned out great!!!

Every time I make this soup for company people ask for seconds and rave about it. It came out stringy on the first attempt but I followed the advice of some reviewers and now use only the top portion of the asparagus (the point where it snaps off). I also simmer it a bit longer to get it softer and liquefy it in a blender (as opposed to using an immersion blender. I also double or triple the lemon juice to give it a more pronounced tang.

This was really good!  This was the first time I have made asparagus soup.  It was easy too.  I made it early then put it on warm in the crockpot until dinner.  It kinda tasted like brocolli soup to me.  I am going to make it again.  Thanks!

Really good soup.  Made according to the directions but used my mini chopper instead of the blender so there was texture with tiny pieces of asparagus.  I thought it was a bit salty though.  I just squeezed half of a small lemon but that may have been a bit too much.  Still a great, easy and quick soup.  Thanks

I used canned evaporated milk in the recipe and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I also added one crushed clove of garlic before blending.

I agree with the reviewer who said your friends will think you've become a chef overnight.  While this soup takes a bit of effort to make, none of that effort is risky for an uneducated (and untalented) cook like myself.

We bought tiny round sourdough loaves and hollowed them out for breadbowls to use with this recipe.  Since then, we have sworn off all canned soups of any kind.  We thought we didn't like soup at all until we tried this recipe!

I didn't change a thing and this recipe turned out AWESOME!  It was a little too much work for a weeknight dinner, so next time I will plan it for a weekend dinner.  I drizzled this soup over the top of Amazing Chicken (from this site) and a bed of steel cut oats cooked in chicken broth.  Needless to say, it was a fantastic dinner (especially since hubby did the dishes afterwards!)

Delicious soup!  It's got a rich, buttery flavor to it.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp but otherwise made exactly as written and it turned out perfectly!

Yum!  This was very easy and quick and tasted great.  The only change I will make next time is to decrease the salt as I found it a bit too salty.

This soup was just as good as i knew it would be. But, i do think next time i will cut my pieces smaller and cook a little longer. They seemed kind of woody. Also, i think i will add some crispy bacon. Who doesn't like asparagus with bacon!

Wonderful!  Easy!  Tastes like you are at a 5-Star restaurant with the soup course being served.  This was rich and delicious - my husband asked me to go out and buy more asparagus to make again - and he was scared to eat this bright green soup!  He loved it!  Will make this again soon!

I used EVOO instead of half of the butter, and plain yogurt instead of the sour cream, to make it a little healthier. The result was great. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is fabulous!  Aside from adding one extra tsp. of lemon juice, and cutting the salt to 3/4 tsp. instead of 1 tsp., I followed the recipe exactly!  We absolutely loved this!  Will definitely make again.  This is a recipe I would serve to company.  After looking at most of the recipes for asparagus soup on this site as well as two others on Food Network's site I chose this for ease of preparation as well as I had all the ingredients on hand.  I'm glad I did!  Wow!  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup is excellent, makes a beautiful presentation and tastes so fresh! I did use a few suggetions from other reviewers such as NKBURLINGTON who advised cooking up a little bacon and using the grease to saute the asparagus and onion before adding the chicken stock. I also added some garlic and sauteed the saved tips in a little olive oil before garnishing. The lemon added a really nice flavor.

Excellent easy soup.  I used cilantro with the onion and asparagus and it turned out great.  I will try the cilantro on top next time as did the previous review.

Really Good, just what i was looking for after having asparagus soup at a fancy winery restaurant.  This is very comparable.  The only dilemma was that i didn't have sour cream but i tried a little plain yogurt and thought it tasted pretty good.  I'm surprised, usually when i make these type of cream soups they're too bland, but this was right on the money.  Try it :D

Wednesday is soup day at our house.  Each week for the past 1-1/2 years we've had a different soup from this website.    Only 2 or 3 were not good.   The rest were great and this is one of the great ones.    I did use roasted garlic and 1/2 & 1/2 cream.   My hubby loved it and he doesn't like asparagus.   It's a keeper for sure.

I used only 3/4 tps of salt but it was still too salty. Next time I will use a low sodium broth. Overall, I love this recipe!

Asparagus is my all-time favorite vegetable and I loved it in this soup.  It was so easy to make for a quick lunch.  My husband liked it too.  It turns out to be a pretty color green too.

The colour of this soup was fantastic.  It was very easy to make.  I did alter the recipe a bit and added some fresh spinach that I had in the fridge and some fresh basil.  The lemon juice really added a zing at the end!

I made this this evening with white whole wheat flour (didn't have all-purpose), skim milk and light sour cream.  It couldn't have been better.  This is going on my "short list"!

I really did not like this.  It was not inedible, but it lacked flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added shredded cheddar after I tried it to finish my bowl.  I am giving it three stars because maybe I am not the asparagus fan I thought I was?

Not bad.  I had to cook the asparagus for longer than the recommended time and I had to frequently add chicken broth as it would cook off. I didn't have sourcream and so I added whipping cream instead of the milk.  It was overall pretty good; just not what I was expecting.  I would probably leave a couple of spears of asparagus whole next time for a little crunch.  Will try again and give it another try.

Made this for Easter dinner.  This is a popular soup in latin america.  I've had it there several times although have never made it myself.  Thought this recipe was good but not great.  Followed some of the other recommendations...doubled the amount of asparagus, and cut off the tips and added them at the end.  I was expecting a little more of a creamy soup.  I think next time I will make the recipe as stated (w/o double amt. asparagus) and see if it turns out more like what I was expecting.

Just finished making this soup. Out of this world!! I really like it. I did cut the stems off and added them to the completion of the soup.I really don't like sour cream but this certainly added a great flavor to the soup. I will make this one again...for sure!

I made this a few months ago and it was so wonderful and fresh!  I didn't change a thing and will be serving for Easter dinner since I can prepare the asparagus puree the day before and finish the soup just before serving.

This was absolutely wonderful! All I added was a little Mrs. Dash and Dill. My husband was delighted. "Fresh" is a good description of the taste. I severed this with a side of ham, but it would go nicely in the soup as well.

This came out great!  I've never made a cream soup before but this was super easy and tasted wonderful.  Per other reviewer's, I used twice the amount of asparagus (2 lbs) and the flavor seemed perfect to me.  I sprinkled some parmesan cheese over each bowl and it complemented the soup really well.  I definately plan on making this again!

Fantastic. Easy to make. Served it at a dinner party and everyone stopped at two servings to save room for dinner. An excellent meal on its own.

Yummy!!! Next time I will double the recipe. Followed the recipe exactly. Used 1% milk and lite sour cream...turned out perfect. Will save some asparagus pieces to add to the soup for texture next time...all in all....a great soup!!

not my favorite. i think it had to do with the sour cream, it gave it a very odd taste. i think if i ever made this again i would omit the sour cream, but that's just my prefernce.  it also was a little plain.

Very tasty! I used lite sour cream, I think you could easily use fat-free.  I pureed 1/2 and lightly pureed the other half (I like chunks in my soup). I also used other reviews and mixed the steamed tips in.

I LOVE this soup, so did my little ones (ages 1 and 3).  Hubby hates asparagus so the soup did not go over with him, but the rest of us can't wait to have it again.  I did reduce the butter to 1Tbsp in order to cut fat and I used skim milk and it tasted fine.

I made this today, scaled to 10, for Easter Dinner tomorrow.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used reduced-fat sour cream and whole milk.  I snipped the tips off the asparagus, boiled them for a few minutes to use as garnish (Thanks for the tip other reviewer).  Well, I snuck a small bowl of it when it was finished. I can't wait to hear the oooos and ahhhs tomorrow.  What a perfect Easter (or Spring dinner) appetizer.  What a perfect soup! Thanks!  P.S.  Buy nearly twice as much asparagus as the recipe calls for ... you have to remove the woody ends.

Wonderul recipe!  Tastes as though it were much more complicated to make. I used nonfat milk and would probably use 2% in the future.

Very easy to make! I substituted with fat free sour cream, skim milk and margarine and it was still yummy! My husband wasn't a fan of it, but he's not a "cream" kinda guy!

Great recipie!  I too didn't add all the butter, I also used more asparagus than the recipie called for~ just because I wanted it to have more flavor.  My husband who doesn't even like asparagus thought it was good.

This was so easy and delicious.  I used skim milk and low-fat sour cream and it still tasted rich and creamy.  My whole family (even the baby) loves this recipe.  Thanks.

I was pleasantly surprised at this soup.  A full, hearty flavor to it.  I will definitely make this every year when asparagus is in season.  My husband even liked it, although he still asked where the meat and potatoes were!

This recipe is excellent!  I added the whole carton of sour cream, though (the
full 8oz), but it was still wonderful.  I even passed this recipe on to my mother-
in-law who is way more of an accomplished cook than I.  She loved it.

Superb flavor and texture . . . I used fat free sour cream, and Smart Balance in place of butter/margarine and sprinkled a little nutmeg on top for garnish along with a small dollup of the sour cream.
