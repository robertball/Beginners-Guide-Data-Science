This was my first time making cabbage rolls and I am sorry to say I didn't like this recipe very much and was asked to not make this again.  Not only was it very time consuming (which will be ok IF the result is well received) but the rice was little too mushy and the whole combined flavor was just too bland.  Apologies for the negative review.

I love this recipe so much.  I now make the best cabbage rolls in my family!  And believe me when I tell you that is quite the accomplishment!  The dill and the bay leaves add such a beautiful flavour.  I had to give full marks for the easiness and quickness rating because this recipe is worth the time and effort and really does not take any longer to prepare than any other cabbage roll recipe.

Great recipe,
I boiled my cabbage and through a bag of success rice in with
it, when the rice was done the cabbage was ready.
Super easy, real tasty and the family loved it.

These are good! I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

The microwave worked very well to steam the cabbage. I loosely covered the head and it turned out very nicely. 

I didn't sautee the onions in butter, and instead browned about 4 slices of diced bacon before adding the onions. 

To the ground beef mix I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, 1 TB of mustard and 3 TB of ketchup. I left out the dill because I don't care for it.

I also sprinkled salt and pepper over the prepared rolls before pouring the sauce over. 

I removed the foil after 2 hours of baking, and let it bake uncovered for another 20 minutes.

Marrying into a Polish family, I was scared to make cabbage rolls, but these were easy to do, and were delicious.  I think the savoy cabbage makes these.  It is so easy to wrap the filling into, and tastes great.  I did add a little brown sugar and worstishire sauce to my sauce, and my hubby raved about them.  Even impressed the father-in-law.  Thanks!!

I like cabbage rolls, so of course I enjoyed eating this recipe. It was my 1st time making them and I don't think I'll make this one again. The meat/filling inside was excellent (I added a dash of cinnamon which was great). I did not care for the use of savoy cabbage. My brother said "Ew, the outside looks like brains. but the filling's good". I also found the leaves need to be boiled in water instead to make sure they are moist, not shriveled from the microwave, and thoroughly cooked. Also, more liquid (water) needed to be added to the cabbage rolls when they were cooking.

sorry but this has got to be the most longest route to make cabbage rolls, if you freeze your cabbage, and then take it out the night before you make them is a heck of a lot easier, no zapping necessary!!! And cooking rice? If you have enough tomato juice and baste you do not need to cook you rice, throw everything in at once and leave out the condensed stuff!!! tomato juice is much much better, and seriously nobody will notice the difference if you've sauted your onions!

I really enjoyd this dish

i did take longer to prepre..about an hour and it as messy haha.

I boiled the cabbage instead of microwaving which made it softer and easier to deal with. 
If you really lie lots of flavor ad more spices
do double the sauce

it is wonderful wil make it again

My mother-in-law make the BEST cabbage rolls, but won't share recipes.  Sadly she is getting older and soon the recipe will be gone.  I'm trying to find a similar one, but this wasn't it.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but nothing like Baba's, and my family is spoiled with hers so I doubt I would make these again.

The basic recipe is good. Boiled the cabbage and added 1 1/2 cups white vinegar + 1TBL salt. When the cabbage was separated used the cabbage water to cook the rice. I only par cook the rice(10 minutes). This prevents sticky rice. I always do this and it just adds flavor to the dish. I also add two cups of chicken stock while baking (more if needed) to get a moist roll.

I think this is one of the best recipes that I have had for cabbage rolls for years.  My partner and friends all loved it as well.  They couldn't stop raving about it!

Of course like any recipe for cabbage rolls it does take a while, but is well worth the time. 

I was able to feed 4 adults and still had enough left to freeze for a couple of weeks from now.

Excellent!  I like the savoy cabbage, and the long grain rice, a meat mixture (perfect amount of fat needed for the rice), the dill, and surplus of bay leaves!  This may not be traditional Polish, but it sure is GOOD! And with a whole lot more zing than Babcia's golabki.  My only teeny tweek is to parboil (15 minutes) the rice so that there is no chance of the rice being crunchy, but that the rice is semi-cooked before baking to absorb meat and tomato flavors. It just puts the flavors into the rolls rather than in the gravy. This is such a good recipe! Smacznego everyone!

We loved this!  My husband says he doesn't like cabbage, but he had no complaints over this dish.  Instead he raved about it.  I made just as written and it turned out fabulous.  The only thing that might me useful to know is the amount of time to make the recipe.  The prep time listed is only 30 minutes, but it took me an hour and 15 minutes getting these ready.  I'm not usually that slow and there is a lot to do to get these ready, so I don't think it was me.  My dinner was pretty late that evening.  It was definitely worth the time, but it would have been nice to know beforehand.  Thanks for the great recipe, definitely a keeper.

first off NEVER microwave a head of cabbage! Put some water in a large pot and steam the head while taking the steamed leaves off the head one buy one as they soften. Dill? Not too sure where this idea came from. Cook or uncooked rice is fine in a recipe but both?(I just find this one odd). And then the last never to do is the can(s) of tomato soup. This is how recipies that get handed down from generations get washed out. Someone decides to take a recipe and change the heck out of it. Canned soup, dill, microwaves. 
I will be writing my own handed down recipe for cabbage rolls and I really want positive/negitive reviews.

Canned tomato soup pureed with tomatoes doesn't give much flavor to these cabbage rolls. Needs ketchup, garlic, onion & other spices to have much flavor.

This was my first time making Cabbage Rolls and settled for this recipe.  The only thing that I have done differently is I used fresh dill instead of dry.  My partner went in for thirds.  As for myself, I would definitely make it again.

These were A+. Turned out great.  Loved the tomato soup sauce.  The secret is in the sauce.  Don't skimp on the savoy cabbage; so much easier to use for cabbage rolls & get big ones.  I got a small and fixed half the recipe and wished I would have gotten a big one.  Fixed mine with rice on the side.  Great recipe.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and I have to say I was a little disappointed with it.  I found the cabbage rolls to be on the blande side.  I cooked my rice in equal amounts of water and rice because that is how I always do it (I don't like mushy rice).  Other then that I followed the recipe to a T.  I feel that this was just lacking in flavour.  It needed more spices.  Next time I make cabbage rolls I'll use this recipe for a base but I'll add in more spices. Some worcestershire for the sauce and maybe some thyme for the filling.  I'll also add 1 pound of italian sausage instead of just 1/2 pound, probably hot instead of the mild. (There was too much rice and not enough meat).

Merry Christmas!  We made these cabbage rolls during Christmas Eve 2012.  This recipe will be a family tradition in our home every Christmas Eve. I was hoping to find a recipe as good as my grandmother's.  This one is better. 100% Awesome.

This is a very simple, and simply delicious recipe, I used regular cabbage & tweaked the recipe a bit but I loved the tomato soup & stewed tomatoes, I added the dill to it, because I already had a meat mixture made up. I did forget the bay leaves witch I think would have made it even better.

I made this recipe for supper tonight and it was EXCELLENT!!  I made a few tweaks to it after reading the reviews. I added 1 tsp worcestshire to the meat mixture AND to the tomato mixture. I also added a little more salt than the recipe called for. I salted and peppered the rolls before covering them with sauce, too. My hubby LOVED this! Although this recipe is pretty "putz-y", I will be making again very soon. DEEE-LISH!

Delicious!! I used a lot less rice as suggested and used all ground beef. I left out the dill. For the sauce, I used crushed tomatoes and tomato juice. Could have used more sauce. I added some tomato juice to the meat mixture. I also made some using Ground turkey which my daughter said were very good.

This recipe was very good.  I usually have to adjust something but with this recipe I didn't have to adjust anything.
Yum Yum It makes a lot of cabbage rolls so freeze some or share them. The mixture of tomato soup and tomatoes made a great sauce topping for the rolls.

This was my first time making cabbage rolls. Very time consuming but well worth the effort! Here's what I did different: used 1lb ground pork, used a little more garlic, omitted dill weed and sugar, and used progresso tomato basil soup instead of condensed. I went ahead and pre-cooked everything for the filling. I didn't want the grease from the meat in  my finished product. This also cut my cook time down to an hour. I ended up with one 9x13 and one 8x8 pan because my cabbages were small. The leftover filling reheated well for lunch the next day and my husband said the rolls themselves were also good reheated. (I think the filling would also work great for stuffed peppers.) We loved this dish and I definitely plan to make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly.  I think it was a lot more work than necessary.  In the end i feel that they are very bland.

Absolutely wonderful.  I had never made cabbage rolls before and I really appreciate the simple steps - microwaving the cabbage, though sceptical at first, is genius.  I served this to my mother-in-law and husband and both said they were the best cabbage rolls they've ever had (and she's an incredible cook from France!).  If there happens to any leftover stuffing it could also be used in peppers.  Super Yum!

Made the sauce out of the romas I picked from the garden that day.  Pureed them with a bit of chicken stock and a few dashes of Magi.  Roommate asked if I could please make this every Thursday.  Tasted just like my ex Polish Mother-In-Law made (and she taught me!)  YUM!

I was excited to make these with the rave reviews.  I was so disappointed b/c they were very bland.  Nobody in my family was a fan.  I think I'll try a different cabbage roll recipe next time.

Fantastic recipe. We cut the quanity in half because it's just the two of us and we still had extra. Adding seasoning ontop of the rolls before you bake them works wonders....

Well worth the time it takes to make. I have lots of meals in the freezer now so if you take that in to consideration the time isn't as much of a factor. Will add more salt next time but other than that we really enjoyed them.

Most of my reviews are 5 stars but this one didn't quite make it.  I purchased the savoy cabbage because I've never tried it.  I read a review and it said that this type of cabbage has a distinctive flavor over the traditional green that I always purchase.  I didn't taste the cabbage at all so next time I have this recipe, I'll be using my green cabbage.  The meat turned out wonderful - 5 STARS for that!!

This five star is not for this recipe.  But for the one I make.  I have been making mine for over 50 years.  I sauté the onions and cook long grain rice.  Add the raw ground beef and roll some mixture into each cabbage roll.  They go in the oven at 300 degrees in a pan covered in tin foil, for 2 hours.  Then remove and put tomato soup mixed with sour cream for another hour.  You mix 1/4 cup of sour cream to each cab of soup.  

Tomato juice just does not do it for cabbage rolls.  I have eaten other peoples and the are not as good as mine.  I have been getting raves about mine for years.

Very good recipe. I usually cheat and make lazy cabbage rolls as traditional cabbage rolls are time consuming to make. This recipe was no exception. However it was worth the time. I do prefer the taste and texture of regular cabbage , but the savoy was easier to work with. I boiled it 12 minutes. I did add about 6 slices of cooked chopped bacon to mixture for added flavour and a bit of cumin. I added about a tbsp of brown sugar to cut back on acidity of tomato sauce. Overall, a good recipe I'd make again. Don't omit the dill, it is key to the flavour.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I didn't follow it exactly due to an error on my part. When I microwaved the cabbage, I overcooked it. So I chopped up the cabbage and mixed that and the tomato mixture in the rice mixture. I omitted the bay leaves. I baked it in 2 9x13 casserole dishes according to instructions. My family (who doesn't like cabbage) ate it up! This new "cabbage roll casserole" as I call it is a winner. It does need a crunch so I'm thinking a bread crumb topping.

This is my 2nd time and 2nd recipe for making cabbage rolls.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I used ground turkey, regular cabbage and cooked everything before I make rolls.  Also, I only baked for 1 hour since the stuffing is already cooked.  It's tasty!!  I recommend this recipe to all of my friends.

Very time consuming recipe .. Cabbage rolls without sauerkraut ?? I used Minute Rice with my ground beef mixture (no need to cook beforehand).  Once the meat mixture is combined with your choice of spices in a large bowl, I placed the sauerkraut on bottom of pot, layered Hunt's tomoto sauce, then the stuffed cabbage rolls.  Finished off with another layer of the sauerkraut and sauce.  Very simple and delicious.  Recipie has been in family for over 50 years.

Delicious! Just like the sarmale I had in Romania! I made some mamliga and it was a great meal! I ended up using elk hamburger instead of the sausage.. but regardless it still had great flavor! It took quite a bit of time.. but well worth it!

I'm not a big cabbage roll fan, but based on my families comments, something was missing. They were okay. Time consuming, but that's expected with cabbage rolls. Lots of sauce which was good. I don't think I"ll make these again, but thanks anyways.

This recipe is extremely similar to the one my mother would make  in the 1950's & one which I make.  My mother was from Poland.  We never used dill weed.  Pork not used either. Savoy cabbage was not used just regular green cabbage.   My grocery store does not sell Savoy cabbage.  Also many many years ago it was only green cabbage.  Most Europeans only grew green cabbage. The rolls were put in a large oval Dutch oven [1943] & filled with the rolls.  Each layer had some sauce poured over & the final layer of rolls had left over cabbage leaves placed on them with sauce poured over.

I did not make it the way it said because I read the reviews , so I decided to add some basil, parsley ,Worcestershire sauce to the tomato sauce and I added 1 can of Italian stewed tomatoes and 2 small cans of tomato sauce and salt and pepper to it and it came out delicious. took one hour for preparation and I used a regular large cabbage because the savoy  cabbage was too small at the groceries.

I made this  cabbage roll recipe last night and I will not make it again!  The cabbage they called for was expensive ($1.99) and I spent $4.00 just for the cabbage!  The cabbage had little to no flavor and was so fragile that it was very hard to work with!  I will be going back to Mom's original recipe from the good old Better Homes and Garden cookbook that many of us grew up with!

One extra thing I do is to pour over a can of sauerkraut, juice and all.  I also use V8 juice for my sauce. And lastly I serve with a dollop of sour cream. Yum.

I've been making cabbage rolls  my moms recipe, for 40 years and it's close to this recipe. It's not necessary to cook the rice or the onions. Let the rice set in cold water for 10 mins , it'll be fine.Also, the dill added an odd taste. I cooked them on top the stove for about 90 mins, in a Dutch oven

As stated by many others, there is way too much rice in this dish. If you straight up mixed about 1 cup of rice is the beef that is more than enough, and you don't need to cook the rice before using it. If you want to stretch you budget, you might use a bit more rice. Only use sugar if the tomatoes are bitter. As it is, most canned tomatoes already have sugar in them. There is no reason to put the tomato soup, which should be tomato sauce, and the tomatoes in the food processor or blender. One of the big things about this dish is texture. Having bits of tomato in the sauce is the way it should be. With all of the salt that is already in all of the canned goods you list, adding more salt would be unnecessary.

I recommend FREEZING the cabbage. After thawing, the leaves can be easily separated and rolled. Much easier and makes for better cabbage rolls.

followed as written. no one ate them at my table. this recipe might be great for someone who was not raised n rea Polish cabbage rolls, but the flavors were so contrasting,  the uncooked rice was hard, the cooked rice was too mushy,, the dill and sausage just didn't work  together. thanks for the effort,, but my family will pass

The prep time was 1.5 hours, not 30 minutes. I made 1/2 recipe, since i only had 1 cabbage. I left out the dill and bay leaves. Will probably make again.

I made this a few years ago and I plan to make it again this year at Christmas. I remember it did take a lot of prep time, it was messy and I had tried boiling the cabbage which was very time consuming and frustrating....I didn't give myself enough prep time, lesson learnt. I'll try microwaving this time. The only changes I made is I cooked with bacon fat instead of butter and I used a slow cooker. I thought cooked and uncooked onions and rice was a bit strange but I'm pretty sure this made them that much better. I didn't  get a chance to try them because by the time I sat down to eat my family had destroyed them. My family don't like cabbage rolls and my step kids are extremely picky eaters, (I'd made them with my hubby in mind), but they all raved about them the entire meal. The only changes I intend to make this time is to allow for prep time and actually eat at least one.

Instead of boiling or microwaving the cabbage, I put the whole head in the freezer overnight. Let it thaw and the leaves will almost fall off after you cut out the core. I used the leftover cabbage to make sauerkraut.

Amazing - I've made these many times. I make them small (halve the larger leaves), devein the leaves and add more garlic.  I also use ground pork rather than sausage.  My family is going to enjoy them this Christmas - all 200 of them!  Cabbage rolls that is!

I didn't have time to make the actual rolls but rather chopped the cabbage and added it to the meat mIxture aling with the tomatoes and soup.  Fabulous flavour - the ' secret ' weapon is that can of soup!

The cabbage roll them selfs are great.  Next time around I will be leavening out the can of whole peeled tomatoes it made the sauce taste gross and smell funny.  Luckily I had tongs and was able to shake the rolls off so none of the tomatoe juice/ sauce really  interferd with the roll itself,  regular ketchup tasted a million times better!

Not a bad recipe. Yes they freeze well. If you would like to add variety to the rolls try adding bacon also try V8 yes the juice as liquids. More nutitional values for your bucks!

this recipe was good not the same has what i had as a kid so i had to change somethings around like instead of tomato soup and tomatos just use v8 juice and i didnt use anything but cabbage sausage and beef and i used cooked rice instead of uncooked rice it speeds things up and u dont have the mushie rice thing going on. and the v8 and sausage is what gives it more flover and some people like hot souce but all all around a good recipe thank you

This is a great recipe, but for my tastes I tweaked it a little.  I also used regular cabbage instead of Savoy and I doubled the sauce.  Next time I make this I will salt and pepper the rolls before I pour the sauce on top and also use a little less rice (I like my rolls more meaty).  Still, I love them and I've been eating them nonstop today!

Excellent rolls! I added fresh parsley.  The dill trully makes these cabbage rolls distinct and tasty. I will make them again.

First attempt at making cabbage rolls, my mom passed without teaching me so I came here.  I completely butchered the cabbage trying to use the microwave and ran out so the next day I bought another head and froze it.  Then stuck it in boiling water and just rolled it around and used tongs to peel off the leaves.  Took awhile but it worked much better for me anyway.  They were good my only complaint was they were a little dry and my sauce seemed to evaporate.  Next time  I might try  going to try regular ground beef and cook them for first hour without the sauce.

Needs more salt in filling mixture. Makes 24 cabbage rolls, two came pans, but calls for less than a teaspoon of salt. Love using the microwave b4 peeling cabbage leaves. Great idea, works well. I'm thinking of lots of other things to stuff in a cabbage roll now that I tried it once! Great dish for us diabetics, if you can stick to one per meal. I subbed equal for the sugar, but it didn't really need sweetening, i may omit it next time. It was kind of fun to make.

I really liked it for what it is.  A solid homemade meal that is healthy and inexpensive.  My husband called it a "Hearty meal to come home to."  Once one is familiar with the formula, it can be tweaked for the particular taste of the family.   I prefer one pot dinners that can be served with a side salad without worrying about extra side vegetables or whatever.

I did make changes that works well. No butter and ground pork instead of pork sausage. I think it is so funny how canned tomato soup appears in every cabbage roll recipe I see. Campbell's must be delighted - it really makes the sauce great.

I have been making stuffed cabbage for many years (my mother's recipe) I never liked the tomato soup instead only crushed tomatoes. No dill. No sugar inside. Just sprinkle some brown sugar on top of the stiffed cabbage after the pot is filled. Also cover the top with sliced bacon. I then prefer cooking for 45 minutes in a pressure cooker. I believe it makes the cabbage more tender.

The quantities of rice and water in the ingredients list do not match the directions, so I had to guess. The uncooked rice in the filling did not cook, so they ended up crunchy. The sauce was great though. I was told by everyone not to make this again. Sorry.

I made this for New Years Eve dinner. It was good but slightly bland. I think of some tomato mixture was placed in with the meat and rice it would be perfect and give it a little more flavor.

I made a vegetarian version as well as a meat version. In the veggie rolls, I used cubed potatoes cooked in a pan with a small amount of veggie broth. We loved this dish! I believe the spice combination was the key.

I left out the dill and added some parsley. I used ground chicken and chicken sausage to make it healthier. Next time I might give it a kick and add some cayenne pepper to it. I also wrapped the cabbage with a wet paper towel and placed it in the microwave for a min or 2 then cut off some of the leaves and boiled the leaves until they were somewhat cooked. It was delicious and easy to make! Will make again!

I live in a house of foodies....we get very creative with our dishes. We like seasoning..lots of it! Have tried several stuffed cabbage rolls --  this was one of the better ones! Believe folks should know that this dish is rather bland...no matter who's recipe one chooses to use.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I did use the microwave to steam the cabbage, but I found this recipe to be very bland even after adding some of my own spices. I added a can of diced tomatoes over the top while it baked so the cabbage rolls wouldn't be dry.

Prepared this recipe tonight for dinner. The tomato sauce over whelmed the meat mixture.  When I prepare this again I will cut down on the sauce.  But, all in all this was very good.

i was looking for a lost cabbage roll recipe... this was the closest thing to it except the old one you had to baker for 5+ hours. overall it was almost the same taste but not enough sauce!! i would get an extra can to tomato sauce. also instead of cooked tomato sauce i use the pureed tomato sauce (uncooked)
