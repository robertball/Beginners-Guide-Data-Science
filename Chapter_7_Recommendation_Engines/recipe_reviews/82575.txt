I made this without the almonds.  I wasn't sure how well sweet potatoes and onions would work together, but to my surprise, they were delicious!  I made this dish for my husband's birthday dinner, and they were a hit with everyone, including the inlaws and the kids.  

I would suggest lightly spraying the cookie sheet/baking dish, in addition to the oil used in the recipe, as the outermost edges of the potatoes and onions seemed to burn and stick to the cookie sheet.

Out of this world!!  The sweet potatoes and onions were carmelized and delicious and the almonds were a surprising crunch -- great combination!  The sweetness of the amaretto was just right.  I did cheat a little -- rather than toast the almonds I just added them to the last 20 minutes of baking.  They were perfectly toasted without the extra step.  Great recipe!!

My family loved it, I didn't have any amaretto, so, I used a little frozen O.J. I am not a big fan of thyme and I did find that it overpowered the recipe slightly. Next time I will cut the thyme back by a third and I think the O.J. was a nice touch. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I made it without the amaretto, and can't imagine how it could have been better!  I left it uncovered to cook for almost one hour, which made the potatoes nice and crisp.

I made this recipe in bulk for Thanksgiving dinner for 20.  For anyone who doesn't really like the sickly-sweet candied yams normally served on holidays, THIS IS THE BEST!!  I am going to make it a regular part of my "normal" dinners, too.  It is easy, and very very tasty!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were good, but I will uncover them sooner than after 30 minutes because I want everything to crisp up. The leftovers mixed with broth and pureed made AMAZING soup.

This is now one of my favorite side dishes an a refreshing alternative way to make sweet potatoes.  I tried this the first time using a few tablespoons of orange juice and a little brown sugar as I didn't have Amaretto on hand.  I used Amaretto the 2nd time, it's good either way but I preferred the O.J./brown sugar way best.

I didn't have amaretto, so I used 3 tbsp (or so) of brown sugar and tossed with onion and sweet potatoes in large bowl. Next time I will use less onion. But overall my family loved it!

This was just awesome. I was a little skeptical about the combination of amaretto with the thyme and almonds, but it was so good. I followed the recipe exactly, only I did let it cook a little longer without the cover for a little more roasted flavor. Even my 11 year old ate the onions! Will definitely make again, and would be great for holiday meals.

This was wonderful.  I was looking for an alternative to the too-sweet sweet potatoes, and this did the job beautifully.  I didn't care for the amaretto, so I omitted it and the thyme and substituted balsamic vinegar.  It was "to die for".  With eight people to dinner, there wasn't a single bite of this left to put away with the leftovers.  To coat evenly, put everything in a large ziploc bag and shake.

delicious!  i make variations of this all of the time.  easy way to get a great side dish.  you just have to make sure you coat the potatoes well with the olive oil and use a good (glass) baking dish to avoid burning.

I love sweet potatoes no matter how they are prepared. For this recipe I skipped the amaretto liqour since I did not have any on hand. I prepared the rest as instructed using one large sweet potato yam. I baked these at 350 degrees for the first 20 minutes covered then removed the foil and baked for another 30 minutes. This made for crispier sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes and onions were carmelized and sweet while the almonds added a nice crunch-a good combination of flavors. The almond flavor comes through very well from just the toasted sliced almonds and adds texture to the sweet potatoes. The amount was enough for the two of us tonight plus leftovers for his lunch tomorrow. This is healthy, tasty, and full of nutrients. I served this with, “Caramel Apple Pork Chops,” and “Green Beans with Walnuts,” also from this site.

What a fantastic recipe!! My family went crazy over these! I will make over and over and over again! The only thing I would change was the amount of thyme used...it was overpowering. I used Nature's Seasoning instead and it was MUCH better!!!

Delicious! I left the potatoes unpeeled, and had to skip the amaretto. (I didn’t have any and this was a last minute recipe!) I loved the flavor of the roasted onions and thyme… and almonds. I can’t wait to try it again now that I have amaretto! Thanks, Jean, for the great recipe!

I changed a few things to make this a 5-star.  First, I cooked the potatoes UNCOVERED.  I also ended up cooking them a lot longer than suggested (b/c my other stuff wasn't ready)....it was fine b/c it allowed more time for the potatoes to brown.  I cooked them on a large (9X11) stone baking dish....so everything was like in a single layer. Be generous with the salt and pepper.  And lastly, I think my pieces of sweet potato and onion were smaller than 1 inch....I'd say more like 1/2 inch cubes.

Ok, this is the absolute best way to have sweet potatoes. I made a pretty big batch. It filled up two cookie sheets. I didn't have the amaretto so I added a 4 Tbls. of orange juice. I also added about 3 Tbls. of brown sugar. I didn't have any thyme so I used 3-4 tsps. of a no salt seasoning that has thyme in it (along with a whole bunch of other seasonings and black pepper.) I sprayed the pans and then sprayed the top of the sweet potatoes after I put them down. It was SO YUMMY! My husband and I loved it! My dad loved it too and he didn't think he would. He doesn't like really sweet sweet potato dishes. I've already bought more sweet potatoes so I can make it again. I'm definitely going to make it for thanksgiving. Next time I'll cut the potatoes a bit bigger so they can roast for longer.

Oh my, I'm in awe of how good this was.  5 stars+++!  I used the suggestion of substituting brown sugar for the amaretto and it was perfect.

I increased the recipe to feed 9 & because of reviews saying it was sweet, decreased the amaretto some. Next time I will use the full amount. I subbed savory for the thyme & will again. FYI This needs a good sprinkle of salt to really bring out the flavor. Loved it...thanks!

YUM!  I roast sweet potatoes and onions a lot but I have never added amaretto to any of my roasted vegetables. To my surprise, it was delicious. I put all the ingredients in a Ziplock bag and let them marinade for a few hours and then baked them on a cookie sheet lined with tin foil sprayed with Pam. Everything turned out great and the clean up was a breeze. I also topped it with fresh rosemary but I forgot the almonds which I love so I will do this again with the almonds as they are so good for you also. You cannot taste the amaretto but it just sweetens the vegetables and caramalizes them. I served this with a nice sirloin steak and it was a great meal.  I can't wait to get some more sweet potatoes to make this again.

This was an awesome recipe!  I loved the flavor created by cooking the onions with sweet potatoes in Amaretto.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe with the one exception of tossing the slivered almonds into the dish twenty minutes before it was done cooking.  The flavors in this dish are awesome!  I am definitely making it again.  Sooo goood...

The onions were quite tasty and it's a good dish if you like sweet potatoes not-so-sweet.  I'm probably going to make this again with sweet onions only.

Easy and very good. I did not peal the potatoes. I used Enova oil instead of olive oil. Next time I will use chicken broth instead of the Amaretta--it made it a little to sweet for my taste. The toasted almonds really made this special. I can not wait to eat the left overs tonight!

Excellent.  Made for Thanksgiving because I wanted a healthier option to the marshmellowy sweet potatoes. I was short on time since the turkey tied up the oven & I didn't want it sitting out for an hour while I waited for the potatoes, so I tried a couple of short cuts.  I peeled and cut the potatoes, coated with oil, seasoned with salt/pepper and Italian seasoning, then covered in seran wrap and microwaved about 10 minutes til they were getting soft.  While I did this, I sauteed the onions. Once I took the potatoes out of the microwave, I added the onions and put uncovered in the oven for about 20-25 minutes and they were great. (I left out the amaretto cuz I couldn't find any at the store).

Great, simple recipe.  The flavors of the potatoes and onion really shine through without the layer of syrupy candy found in most baked sweet potato recipes.

Made this tonight for the first time but DEFINITELY not the last!  Was very good, even though we forgot to add the sliced almonds at the end.  Very sweet taste.  I think the sliced almonds would bring out the amaretto even more.  All around great way to prepare sweet potatoes!

I love this savory recipe!  I followed all instructions ingredients-wise (including the amaretto, but I did cut back on the thyme a bit after reading other reviews).  Cooking-wise, I made some minor adjustments. I left the skin on the sweet potatoes, and I roasted them uncovered for the entire time, about 30-40 minutes.  The key to getting them crispy and brown is to make sure they don't touch.  I used two cookie sheets for this amount.  DELISH!

This is a good combo!  I forgot to cover it, and it was still fine.  The onions get nice and caramelized and the amaretto has a nice sweet flavor that compliments the sweet potatoes.

I served this dish with marinated grilled lamb chops and caesar salad for our Valentine's Day dinner.  We loved it, even though I had no Amaretto and substituted Cointreau for it.  What a wonderful new way to prepare sweet potatoes!

I thought these sweet potatoes were delicious. I had so much going on with the dinner I was making that I forgot to add the almonds. I'm sure they would have added a nice crunch, but they weren't missed in making this dish taste very good. Instead of dried thyme, I used fresh and also added some fresh rosemary. I loved the carmelized onions and baked them on a cookie sheet uncovered so the sweet potatoes & onions could carmelize.

Delicious - I didn't toast the almonds - I just threw them on after potatoes were uncovered.

Didn't have amaretto or almonds, and I sprinkled some garlic powder over top.  They turned out awesome.

Excellent recipe. Cut the thyme back by about 10 percent. We made this twice, once with about 14 sweet potatoes and once with half of that. I like to mix the thyme and pepper with the olive oil before hand and let it sit. I also substituted orange juice but will try amaretto next time to see if it carmelizes better, or at least freshly squeezed orange juice. Orange juice from a carton tends to be so watery, esp. compared to the liqueur called for in the recipe. In large batches, it is hard to get it to carmelize because the potatoes are bunched up a bit, but they still turn out flavorful and soft. I also omitted the almonds.

Made this for four generations of family last night and everyone from the six year old to the eighty year old loved these potatoes. I didn't have amaretto and used orange juice (suggested by another reviewer) instead but otherwise made the recipe as written. Wonderful!!!!

Very nice flavor, you need to coat the al foil tho with some spray b/c the onions and potatoes stick when completed cooking. I would also add a little more amaretto

This is an excellent recipe! I made it as written, except I only used one onion, and I skipped the amaretto liqueur. I felt that it was unnecessary, because the almond flavor comes through very well from just the sliced almonds themselves. I was very impressed with the flavor...the sweet potato lovers in my family loved this! It is extremely healthy, tasty, and easy to make...so I'll be making it again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

What a great recipe! I was looking for something nutritious with an autumn flavor, and this was just the ticket.  A few changes I made: Like other reviewers suggested, I decreased the amount of dried thyme. I just used what was left in the shaker, probably 1/2-3/4 tsp, and it was plenty. The subtle flavor was wonderful. Also, I subbed orange juice for amaretto, because I'm on a bit of a tight budget and OJ is a more practical choice for my household. Last, I threw in some prunes (sliced in half) because I love them. They're full of iron, they add color contrast to the dish, and they're delicious!

could not see where the Amaretto made much of a difference.  didn't change anything in recipe.  except for a different twist on the traditional sweets, which I am always looking for, I didn't think these were that special.  I used a white onion(mild) and it seemed to overpower the sweet potato.  would like to try w/o the onion and use triple sec or grand marnier.

This was good.  I used 2 potatoes and 1 medium onion.  I reduced the thyme to 1/4 tsp and baked it uncovered for 1 hour.  Next time, I'll probably reduce the amount of amaretto; it was slightly over-sweet.

I wasn't sure I would enjoy this, but had a sweet potato and carrots, so I used this recipe (but added carrots to the onions and sweet potatoes).  I did not have the amaretto, so used a bit more olive oil and added some garlic powder.  It was incredible, the almonds really made it shine.  Can't wait to serve it to guests!  Very easy, very yummy.

Great recipe. I didn’t have any Amaretto the first time, so I used hazelnut liquor and it was OK, but not spectacular. I think the hazelnut is just a lighter taste, and was overshadowed by the sweet potatoes. For thanksgiving I bought the Amaretto, and it was fantastic. A nice change from just roasted yams with out adding all the sugar. I baked it the first half the day before, then put it in uncovered when the turkey came out. Perfect timing.

I have made this recipe twice. I am normally a fair to poor cook so I was ecstatic when it was a hit with my husband, who is an excellent cook. I did increase the liquids because I am cooking at a high altitude.

Really yummy, but I thought the thyme was a little strong. I was trying to make it as kid friendly as possible so I added a little brown sugar after it was done baking too.

This is fantastic! I coarsely chopped my almonds (in blender) and added more than 1/4 cup.  They coated the potatoes and you got some of the nutty taste in every bite.  I also omitted the liqueur. I prefer the healthier option and the natural flavors.  Additionally, I didn't have thyme so I used rosemary instead. I will definitely make this again.

Needed a lst minute dishs to bring to a friends dinner party, chose this and it was a tremendous hit.  I left out the amaretto (will try next time) and used orange zest and juice.  It was wonderful - thanks Jean for sharing.

This was excellent. I thought it would be drier like other roasted potatoes, but in fact it was moist.  But it was excellent.  I substituted slivered almonds because I had them, but I think sliced would have been a little better. And remember to put them on just before serving or they would have been soft.

Fantastic! I made a 'mistake' and put the almonds in as it was making, but instead of burning they turned out just fine. I probably put a lot more olive oil in than was called for which might have helped. I did not have the liqueur, so I went with the orange juice suggested by another reviewer. Excellent recipe and is now on the favorites list in my house!

Didn't work for us. The potatoes and onions never caramelized even though we baked them 45 min longer and finished them under the broiler. Maybe because we used a glass dish? We weren't able to taste the amaretto liqueur at all, so what was the point?

Loved this!  Wanted a more savory Sweet Potato recipe instead of the usual marshmallow stuff and this fit the bill perfectly.  The only thing I didn't add was the sliced almonds, simply because I had none on hand - next time I'll add them and I'm sure it will only improve the dish.  My kids had seconds and there wasn't a morsel left in the dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

amazing!  i made this as a side dish to a pork roast i made for dinner tonight and everyone loved it!  i added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar when i tossed it just because i do like them sweeter.  i also served them with a dip made of 5 tbsp sour cream and 1/4 tsp of chipotle powder which was a delicious combo but they were definitely amazing without it. mmmmmm!

Made this tonight and it was superb. My boyfriend had yams before and wasn't too fond of them but he really enjoyed this recipe. I was worried the amaretto would become overpowering but it was nice and subtle. The almonds just finish the recipe off. Yum!

Very tasty!! I substituted the amaretto with orange juice and didn't put almonds in (because I had none). I baked it uncovered for 50 min. It still came out soft... I was hoping it to be crispy. But anywho, this is really really good. I will make it again and again. Will try different baking time to see the best results. Thanks for the recipe!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! It has turned into my absolute favorite way to prepare sweet potatoes. I served this for Christmas and it was gone in the blink of an eye! Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Wonderful! It was better than I thought. My husband loved it too. I did use a little frozen OJ instead of the ammerato and it turned out great.

These were pretty good...I did not have amaretto, which I bet would have made a yummy difference.  I'm a big fan of the Roasted Beets 'n Sweets recipe on this site, and I've yet to find anything to beat that.

I had sweet potatoes lying around and needed inspiration.  Man, this was great!  I had a couple forkfuls to taste it and I'm not even kidding, I ended up eating nearly half of it!  So good!
I did modify per other users, I didn't have amaretto (sad, I know!) so I subbed 3 tbs. orange juice and a sprinkle of brown sugar.  I loaded it with black pepper and cut it down to one onion.  Excellent, excellent!  I will make again and again and again and will now have an excuse to buy amaretto!

This is a great recipe as is but I added a couple items and it is wonderful.  I lined a 9x13 pan with parchment paper, pour everything in the pan, top with filets of fish.  (I like walleye)  Season with salt and pepper and top with fresh thyme.  Cover with another piece of parchment paper and tuck under bottom piece. The parchment paper steams the contents inside. Cooking time approx. 15 min at 425 and 15 at 400.  Depends on the thickness of your filets.  Enjoy!

This is good with an intriguing flavor. My husband loved it - my kids were divided on their approval. I used one onion, more would have been overpowering. Next time I'd cut the oil a bit, they came out greasy.

Great savory recipe for sweet potatoes!  I could easily eat every sweet potato with brown sugar and butter, but my husband likes them more savory.  I did this recipe in the crock pot -- just threw everything in and cooked on low for 4 hours.  I used Franjelico (hazelnut liquor) since I didn't have amaretto.  It was great, and I could even take the big chunks of potato out to mash with butter for my onion-hating 2- and 4-year olds!

This is outstanding!  Made the recipe exactly as written, and was a little hesitant, as I've only had the traditional candied type sweet potatoes--never tried a savory version.  OMG.  Very very good.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I've roasted sweet potatoes with onions for years but never thought about adding in a bit of amaretto - it's genius! The only change I made to the recipe was to quarter the onions, and to roast uncovered for a longer time (about an hour and 20 minutes).

I wasn't too impressed by this, I was expecting a more savory roasted sweet potato salad of sorts and all of the amaretto still made it very sweet. Not remarkable for me.

This is not like your usual candied sweet potatoes. The amaretto does help to make the potatoes sweeter, but it does not get overly sweet, as most candied sweet potatoe recipes do.  Very different and easy.  This one is a winner.

If you like candied yams, you'll love this.  The amaretto and almonds create a more sophisticated candied flavor than the  tranditional candied yams.

We didn't have amaretto or almonds on hand, but this recipe still tasted terrific.  It can easily cook 15-20 minutes longer than recommended.  It went particularly well with our grilled flank steak.  Mmmmmmm!

My husband saw this recipe in USA Weekend, and he made it exactly as printed.  It was wonderful--the Amaretto gave it a mildly-sweet flavor.  We served it with microwaved fish & a salad for a great, light meal.

This was delicious! I did not have Amaretto, so I substituted 1/2 tsp of a good quality almond extract. I was also short on time so I microwaved the dish for 5 minutes and then roasted it uncovered for 20 minutes as specified. My husband is not a sweet potato lover, but he really enjoyed this! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe, I didn't have the liqueur, so I used 1/4 cup
of water with 3 tbl brown sugar. it worked very well
I followed the instructions and cooking time exactly and it
was well done with just a little crunch. very good indeed.

This was fabulous! I regularly make a basic roasted sweet potato recipe but this was so much better. The addition of almonds and onions gave it just the right balance between sweet and savory. I served it at Christmas dinner and everyone raved! Even the people that normally don't like sweet potatoes enjoyed this. I didn't have any amaretto liqueur so I substituted orange juice and brown sugar and it was perfect. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Just made for Thanksgiving dinner.  Delicious!  I like the 50/50 combination of sweet potatoes and onions.  I did add butter for more flavour, and subbed the almond extract for the amaretto due to having it on hand.  Definitely try it!

Have to start off by saying I didn't have all of the ingredients for this dish - no amaretto or almonds. I don't usually like to review if I didn't make the recipe exactly, but just in case anyone is in the same boat- it was still a delicious dish. I'd probably use a little less thyme bc that was overpowering, but perhaps with all the ingredients it wouldn't have been. Would try again with everything.

Very good!! I checked a different Web site for amaretto substitutions and tried almond extract, but that didn't work at all. (I don't blame the recipe at all; I should have just tried the real thing, or left it out as many of you were smart enough to do!) I wish I hadn't done that b/c it overpowered the wonderful taste of the SPs and onions, but my family still enjoyed it and I'll try it again extract-free for sure!!

I tried this recipe for the first time today - Thanksgiving! Gutsy right? Well it is just wonderful. I was a little unsure about the onions but all of the flavors melded together perfectly. The only change I made was to add sliced dates and I was a bit heavy handed when I added the Amaretto. This is a keeper and a new reason to have sweet potatoes every month of the year. Try it, you will like it.

I made exactly as written except I added The  toasted almonds to the pan for the last 20 min of cooking and they "toasted" up nice on the oven. This is a wonderfully delicious dish which is very easy to make.

I doubled the potatoes and oil, swapped the amaretto for maple syrup, and added a dash of cayenne pepper. Delicious!  
It all fit in a 9 X 13 baking dish,  and I didn't cover it at all, just stirred once halfway through. 
Will make again next week!

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have the liquor or the sliced almonds and it was still so tasty. I added oregano and a little cinnamon along with the other spices.It smells wonderful in the oven. The sweet potatoes with the onions was a perfect combination. Definitly a keeper!

I made this exactly as the recipe states.  We love sweet potatoes that are not-so-sweet and I roast them frequently with oil and spices.  I thought this would be a nice change but I was wrong.  The amaretto gave the dish a very strange flavor with an almost bitter aftertaste.  The potatoes were cooked to a pulp, almost baby food consistency.  I love roasting sweet potatoes with onions and spices but something about the combinating here was not good.  I'm guessing a lot of the good reviews on here didn't use the amaretto and I would highly suggest substituing brown sugar as some suggest.  I also don't really know why you need to cover for the first 30 minutes, maybe that's why they turned to mush.  I had such high hopes for this one, oh well!

I love sweet potatoes but have never had them like tis before. The amaretto made this sound very interesting. Verdict: Yummy!! My husband dislikes sweet potatoes and he gobbled these up. If I were to be extremely picky, I will use a little less Amaretto next time (just a touch). Otherwise, these were absolutely delicious AND simple!!

Delicious at dinner last night! I just followed the instructions.  I didn't have amaretto so used just a bit of brown sugar and citrus juice as others have mentioned.
My kitchen still smelled wonderful this morning from the caramelized onions and roasted potatoes!

Great recipe for savory sweet potatoes. I added some Italian seasoning, (Rosemary,basil, oregano)and since I didn't have amaretto I used 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract. Everyone loved it. Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I actually used 3 sweet potatoes and two onions.  It is very different from the typical syrupy sweet potato casserole.  This was a big hit at our family Christmas dinner.

This is by far the best way to eat sweet potatoes. Didn't change a thing other than I had to double the recipe to feed my family. I made it for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit there too.  I don't like the sugary, marshmallow kind at all and this recipe just adds to the flavor of the potato. The onions, amaretto, thyme and almonds are a great combination. Just can't say enough good things.

I forgot the almonds.  But, OMG, this recipe is amazingly delicious! It may be my favorite sweet potato dish yet.  My son, who won't go near sweet potato fries (is he really MY son?!), declared them to be worthy of seconds.

I give this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because they made a mess of my baking dish.  The sauce carmelized on the edges and the sweet potatoes and onions stuck to the sides, tearing as I dished them out. I don't think they'd be very presentable for dinner guests.  But, hey, then you'd have to share! Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll try lining the dish with foil.

This was pretty good.  I did not use almonds nor the amaretto and it turned out perfect.   I did use additional extra virgin olive oil on the potatoes and the onions to prevent burning the edges.

I just made these with our dinner tonight and I've gotta say, the whole family loved them! I didn't have the amaretto or almonds, but they were wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

Delicious and a great, versatile side dish.  I've been making this recipe for years out of our church cookbook.  We include a sprinkling of cinnamon for extra flavor.  Love it!  Thanks Jean!

Made a few changes and turned out great!  Omitted liqueur and almonds and added 3 slices of thick-cut bacon (chopped).  Used less than 3 tablespoons of oil.  So delicious!

These were delicious! The amaretto really brings out the sweetness of the potato and onions. I wouldn't make any changes to this recipe.

I cook alot but had yet to actually taste sweet potatoes. They were just one of those things i never tried but always wanted to. I didn't use the amaretto or almonds in my recipe. I personally thought they turned out pretty good! Husband said the potatoes took on too much of the onion flavor and he was used to a more sweeter sweet potato. Kids weren't a big fan, but kids are kids right? Thats not to say they werent good. Overall good recipe, but im left wondering what the amaretto would of done to them.

Excellent! I used brown sugar instead of amaretto as suggested in previous review. I also browned the potatoes on top of the stove instead of waiting for them to crisp in the oven. I'm hooked!

The amaretto liqueur makes it much too sweet.  It tasted like a dessert rather than a side dish.  Without the amaretto, you still get full flavour and it becomes healthier that way.

This was a unique and delicious blend of flavors. I didn't have any amaretto, so I used about 1/2 tsp of almond extract and added an extra tbsp of olive oil. Very good! I will make this again. SECOND ATTEMPT: I just tried making this with the amaretto, and my husband and I actually preferred it the first time (with almond extract and extra olive oil). The amaretto made it sweeter than it needed to be. The almond extract gave all the same flavor minus the sweetness.

a very nice sweet potato recipe. added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, used orange juice instead of amaretto and skipped the nuts. maybe the last two omissions were why this dish, while delicious and able to stand as a side for a regular night, didn't earn rave reviews at my thanksgiving table tonight.

I am rating this 5 even though I didn't do almost all the steps!  All I did was cube the sweet potatoes and put into a zip-loc bag.  Added a swirl of olive oil, salt & pepper.  Poured out into a 1/4 sheet cake pan that had been sprayed with Pam.  I used the same cooking temp and time and they were AWESOME!  My DH is very picky and he said they tasted better than the sweet potato fries at the restaurants.. and this is so much healthier.  Next time I will cut the taters into french fry shape and do the same thing.  Thanks for the method even if I didn't follow the ingredients.

Delicious and very healthy! Nice combination of flavors. The only change I made on this dish was to bake uncovered for 50 minutes, I like it more when is crispy and well done.

Made this for company sans the amaretto as I didn't have any.  They devoured it.  Asked for the recipe.  Made it again for a Hawaiian themed pot luck with coconut shrimp.  Even the kids were devouring it not realizing those were onions!!

This was really quite good, especially the onions!  I'm not a huge fan of adding sweetness to sweet potatoes, so I can't give it a 5 star.

Perfect side dish!! I love sweet potatoes, and they turned out great! I was worried about them being too hard, but they actually were very soft. I think I could have baked them uncovered for 10-15 minutes, but they were still really tasty...Oh, I omited the almonds, only because I had none to throw in.

25 million stars!  Wow, I am totally digging this dish. :)  Made recipe exactly as written and I guess you can tell what my verdict is, huh?  I chose to bake for an additional 10 minutes uncovered, to get the onions nice and brown and yummy.  You absolutely must add the toasted almonds once it's done - they add another wonderful dimension!  Thanks  soooo much for this recipe!

Great recipe! I followed all the instructions, except I substituted OJ for the amaretto. My only complaint is that it was too oily. I think I'll cut it back to 1 tbsp of olive oil and I'll spray the pan with non-stick spray first.

This was very good. I did have to use a red onion,  but it still had great flavor, not to sweet, & the potatoes had a nice texture. I'll make this one again.

My dish turned out with a very overpowering taste of olive oil.  Now, I did not have amaretto and so I used a little brown sugar with almond essence which probably was the mistake.  Next time I will follow it to the T and look forward to the results as I agree that it is an extremely healthful dish!

Wow!  This was truly fantastic-- my changes: I cut the recipe in half but kept the same cooking time and it turned out perfect.  Switched sweet potatoes for butternut squash.  Omitted the almonds (didn't have any).  

Truly great...definitely going on my short list!!

I prepared this dish for a dinner party and everyone raved. I took other reviewer's suggestions and toasted the almonds. I didn't have any liquor and it still turned out great. Served with Rack of Lamb & whole head of steamed brocoli (sliced in 1/2), made a very elegant meal. Thanks!

I didn't have any amaretto so I skipped it and the recipe was still fabulous.  This recipe will become a regular in our kitchen.

Made 1/1/2020.  This recipe originally appeared years ago in Jean Carper's Eat Smart column in the Parade/USA Weekend magazine supplement of the Sunday paper.  I had clipped it and made a few times (still have the clipped recipe).  Just made the allrecipes one 1/1/2020 and thought it sounded similar to the clipping.  It's the exact same recipe.  When I made it 1/1/2020 I used Grand Marnier as I didn't have amaretto.  I forgot to add the almonds.  It's an easy recipe to make and the vegetables (particularly the onions) caramelize.  Healthy and filling.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  I used fresh rosemary and some dried oregano, rather than thyme (someone has a thyme allergy), and it was quite tasty.  The onions in this get so tender and sweet!  Everyone said they liked it, so I'll probably do again.

Delicious! Ate every last bit. Didn't use Amaretto at all. Followed the recipe other than sprinkling with dried cranberries before roasting. That provided a nice bite too. Will definitely make again the same way!

Delicious recipe with just the right sweet from the potatoes and savory from the onions. I didn’t add the liquor and it still turned out yummy. The 4-star is because the potatoes could have used a little less time in the oven so they weren’t mushy.

Didn't have amaretto so I used 3TBS of Br. Sugar and O.J (each). Replaced the thyme with fresh rosemary b/c we Love rosemary! Also used rosemary olive oil. These were good to the last drop!!! Will definitely make these again!

This is one of my go to recipes, especially for a crowd. Even people who don’t like sweet potatoes love these. I usually don’t have amaretto around the house so instead I use a little brown sugar.

I followed the directions as written except I used slivered almonds instead of sliced. We didn't care for the results because the dish was soggy. I will make this again but not cover for the first 30 minutes, roasting the sweet potatoes and onions instead.

Loved this. I accidentally added 1t sugar but it was not overly sweet.  For salt and pepper, I used 1t salt and 1/2t pepper (I could never figure out how to add ‘to taste’ if IT had not been cooked yet).  Anyway, this was really good and the amaretto  gave it a really wonderful flavor. I will be making again. Thanks to the submitter.

Delicious!  I did as another reviewer did and added the almonds to the top in the last 20 min to toast so I could skip that step earlier.

Made just as directed.  Easy to prepare, but it took 15 minutes longer to cook than the recipe stated.  Sweet potatoes were still crunchy after 50 minutes.  Maybe a smaller dice next time.  I would never have thought of using a liqueur with veggies, but it really paired well. I could see Grand Marnier working just as well, adding a slight citrus element.

I was really looking forward to making this for Thanksgiving. I made 6 potapoes/onions, scaled the recipe up to match. What a watery,  mushy mess. Flavor is kind of lacking. I'm hoping as it cools, it will come out more. Amaretto gets lost. I tripled the toasted almonds and layered them in the final pan. I had it in 2 pans. After more than an hour and a half waiting for the caramelized brown, put them on cookir sheets. It reduced down to one aluminum pan. I poured most of the water off. I hope that's not where the flavor went. They're still sweet potatoes, so they should be good anyway, but up to now, this not living up to the hype of the rave reviews.

Enjoyed this and the ease of  putting it together. I even included a white potato. Made sure to cut the chunks smaller to speed up the roasting time.

We liked this a lot, cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 of us and added about 9 asparagus spears in 2 inch lengths. Like the others, we did not have Amerreto on hand so used OJ and real Maple Syrup. And substituted pine nuts for almonds. Will try flipping the times next time as they did not crisp up. But was still delicious!

Very delicious. Next time I will forego covering them at the beginning so they don't steam and become super soft as if like them crisper on the edges. 
I used half of the recommended thyme for my first batch. Next time I'll use full amount.

Because I didn't feel like taking the extra step to toast the almonds, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added them for the last 20 minutes of uncovered baking.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a 'T'.  The top dried out some, but I 'folded' the bottom to the top before serving.  It was not only easy (and beautiful) but delicious!

This recipe could not have been easier to make! Because it was for Thanksgiving, I used the toaster-oven for this dish since the big bird was monopolizing the main oven. Pleased to report, it turned out excellent... I made two minor changes due to ingredients on hand. Instead of slivered almonds I used pecan pieces on top, and in place of the Amaretto, I used Chambord blackberry liqueur... the final result tasted wonderful! I believe this recipe would work with any sweet liqueur/nuts combination... give it a try, I guarantee you can't mess it up and pretty sure you will enjoy the flavor.

I used Kahlua instead of Amaretto (It was on hand).  I found this recipe to be very easy, and tasty.  Be careful with the thyme, though.  A little goes a long way.

Had to go to a specialty liquor store to get the amaretto liqueur, but it was worth it!  This is the tastiest sweet potato dish ever and it's ridiculously simple.  Holidays, here we come!

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I did not cover the dish when I put it in the oven on a cookie sheet.  I stirred it after 20 minutes and then cooked it another 20.  It absolutely did not need to be covered and parts got nice and caramelized. Delish!

I didn't have any Amaretto (gasp!) and substituted Franjelico hazelnut liqueur. It turned out beautifully. It's easy to make and a great way to use sweet potato. I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe, excellent taste. I recommend par cooking the potatoes for an hour before you start. Just put them in water and bring it to about 160 degrees. Put the lid on and take it off the heat. Letting them sit in that water really helps bring the flavor out. It adds to the time, but certainly worth it!

Superb! I didn't have amaretto on hand so I skipped that. I also cut the thyme down to 1/2 teaspoon as suggested by others and didn't bother roasting the almonds.  I baked at 400 for 30 minutes covered and an additional 20 minutes uncovered. It turned out great...hubs loved it! This recipe is a keeper.

I have made this a few times. I substitute a bit of brown sugar and a splash of balsamic vinegar for the amaretto, and bake it for 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. I don't bother toasting the almonds, and just put them in for the last half hour of cooking. My husband and I really enjoy this!

Love this recipe in your house. Taste is subtle but very good. Pairs well with pork. I didn't change the recipe in any way and used a roasting pan, turning once, to bake the veggies. I will make again. Thank you for the recipe.

I made a double recipe for a buffet dinner. I used 3 suggestions from comments: put all ingredients in a large ziplock baggie to marinade for 3 hours before cooking; cooked covered for only 20 minutes - will probably cook uncovered the entire time next time I make it; had about 1/4 left so made it into soup with chicken & turkey broth and about 1/2 c of half & half and then purreed it. This was amazingly delicious!

This turned out great! Hubby and I loved it even though I made some changes. I used slivered almonds instead of sliced and I didn't toast them. Instead of amaretto, I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. I misread the timing so instead of following the directions, I roasted them at 450 for 30 minutes. Wow, were they good!

I'd like to say I made this as is but I didn't have the amaretto or the almonds so I did as other reviewers did and used brown sugar instead and I had crushed pecans so substituted those as well.  I really liked this dish and will definitely make again.  Very easy to do!

Instead of using the Amaretto Liqueur (because I didn't have any) I substituted 1 teaspoon of almond extract. It was great and everyone at the potluck loved it. I also was running short on time so I nuked the potatoes in a potato bag in the microwave, caramelized the onions on the stove, mixed everything in the skillet, then put it in the oven for the last 20 minutes. I believe this would also work with butternut squash, pumpkin, or acorn squash. It is savory, not sweet, and that was the best part.

Very good. Next time less onion, or more sweet potato. Didn't have Amaretto, so used some white wine and almond flavor. Very good.

I  didn't have amaretto or almond slivers on hand.. still was very good.  Used poultry seasoning since didn't have thyme.  Will definitely make this again. Was a great compliment to the Cuban-style pork roast recipe I also made.

Sweet potatoes are delicious without goopy brown sugar and marshmallows! Roasting with Vidalia  onions is amazingly delicious. I didn't have the amaretto but wanted the flavor suggested. Happened to have Chef Dean Fearing all natural Sun-kissed Apricot Sauce and added a generous 2 Tbsps halfway through roasting. Really good stuff!
Also, wish I had used aluminum foil-- pretty sticky clean up!

This dish was fantastic and a hit with the whole family. I made a few modifications based on the ingredients I had on hand, which changed the flavor profile but used the same process. First, I subbed Macadamia oil for vegetable oil (healthy and has a high smoke point). I don't have Amaretto (It reminds me of one of my very first bar experiences,  which didn't end well. No judging, lol!). So, I used 1/4 cup coconut rum instead. I also sprinkled 1/4 cup brown turbinado sugar, plus  1/2 tsp salt and a 1/2 tsp Chinese 5 Spice powder onto the potatoes and onions.  The result was amazing and paired beautifully with the Chinese Pork Chops from this site. I agree with another poster on cooking time, I would only steam them (covered) for about 10 minutes, remove the cover, and roast for 30 minutes (instead of 20). The ingredients weren't browned, so I broiled them on high for an extra 3 minutes.

Made this last night with the "marinated turkey breast" from this site.  Both were delicious.

I don't rate things often on here, as I rarely find a bad meal idea and I would be on here way to often. However, I HAD to rate these sweet potatoes!!! I am not a fan of sweet potato casserole or the standard baked sweet potato with butter & brown sugar. I was given a basket of about 20 fresh sweet potatoes and was trying to figure out some way to eat them that I might enjoy. I tried this recipe out using 10 sweet potatoes, and man I cannot wait to cook up the rest!!! I followed the directions as shown, using all of the ingredients listed. I had sliced, raw almonds which I did not pre-cook, I simply added them for the last 7-10 minutes of cooking. OMG!! I have no words to describe how delicious these were! I know I am using a lot of exclamation points, and between myself, my picky vegetable hating husband, and his 18 year old son - we all LOVED them and  literally scraped the pan clean.

This worked out well, except for 3 Tbsp. of olive oil is way too much.  I think 1 Tbsp. would be plenty.  I liked the combo, but the rest of my family doesn't like sweet potatoes, so I won't make it again.

Amazing. I left out the vinaigrette. Added dull and cut into small pieces so it cooked faster. Great low Cholestrol flavorful addition to smoked turkey. I will be doing this again soon.

Followed the recipe exactly on this one, it was good but not great. If I'll make it again I'll definitely use less onion than was called for.

This is a really lovely dish.  I might spray the pan with oil next time and then line it with foil.  I'm going to try adding more amaretto, too.  It was deeelicious as is!

I admit, I'm cooking this now. But, I wanted people who are interested but don't have the liqueur, there is a great recipe on this site! Just bring it down to 1 serving and, Viola! As long as you have a little vodka around, you can make this recipe. And it smells really good!

If you're looking for a tasty recipe for sweet potatoes look no further! I made this for New Year's Day dinner yesterday and everyone liked it. Orange juice was used instead of amaretto, since we had none, but the flavor of the juice wasn't noticeable. I baked it uncovered the entire time, but then covered it until the pork was done. Next time I'll add more onions, skip the juice (or amaretto) and keep it uncovered since the potatoes stayed crisp until they were covered.... Thanks for this delicious and nutritious recipe!

Very good, especially if you don't like the very sweet methods of preparing sweet potatoes. Be sure to cut potatoes in large chunks and not small diced pieces so they don't turn to mush.

We love sweet potatoes. I am glad we tried it with the onions and almonds. They were nice for a change. I did not have any Amaretto but had Frangelico...so I used that. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is so good! I didn't have any thyme or liquor to put on it, so u just stuck to salt pepper and oil. Also substituted the almond slices for some oats I have in the pantry. Still tastes really good! Very fall (:

Delicious!  I used Kahlua as I did not have Amaretto.  I also took some of the others suggestion and tossed the not toasted almonds on the top the last 20 min.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Cooking it tonight for my son who is coming for dinner.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe though we served it as oven roasted vegetables without the amaretto and almonds (didn't have either of those). In addition to the thyme, fresh ground pepper, and course sea salt, I also added garlic. phenomenal!

This recipe was delicious!!! We made a great dinner with spicy grilled pork tenderloin and this was the perfect side dish! I did make the few suggested changes I saw in other reviews and uncovered the dish with untoasted almonds and it came out perfectly.

I like another reviewer did not have amaretto, so substituted orange juice instead.  Simply forgot the almonds.  It was delicious and I don’t even love sweet potatoes.  My only real suggestion is this: I thought the cooking time was too long.  When I checked the potatoes after the first 30 minutes, they were already long since done.  (Which I knew they would be.)  Had I trusted my instincts, I would’ve not covered them and let them caramelize during the first (and only) 20 minutes.  Otherwise, I just broiled them for some caramelization once I realized they were already done.  Still tasty.

I made this last night and we both loved it. I've been cooking dinner for about 2 months since I get home eariler than my wife but don't know a lot about cooking. The onions were good but pretty well done. I'll try waiting till I remove the cover to add the onions.

Liked the recipe but I didn't really make the recipe. I didn't have amaretto and thyme so I used beer and rosemary.  The cook time seamed to be to long or to hot. I stopped after 30/10 and they were just over cooked.  But, everything tasted good together.

Loved the dish.  It wasn't browning and caramelizing as much as I would have liked, so I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Baked about 60 minutes altogether, plus a couple minutes on broil at the end.  Came out great!

BAM! 5 STARS. I omitted the amaretto, and subbed turkey stock. My MIL couldn't stop raving about them! MY MIL!!!! I took these to Thanksgiving dinner tonight, and everyone LOVED them. Plus, even the people who are lactose intolerent got to have some, because these sweet 'taters aren't cooked in butter! HUGE SUCCESS! BIG WIN!

Delicious!  We loved it.  I don't know if it is necessary to cover it up, but I would recommend stirring once.  We cooked it long enough to carmelize it on the bottom. We forgot the almonds, so I can't wait to try it again with the almonds.

We make this regularly, usually with grilled fish and collards or kale.  I don't have amaretto, though, so I add a couple of big spoon fulls of molasses and then use whatever nuts I have in the house, often pecans.  This makes a lot, but we always somehow manage to eat it all :)

I made this as a side dish to go along with the "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" recipe on this site. WOW WOW WOW! I love sweet potatoes cooked ANY way, but my husband isn't as big a fan. You know you've done well when hub eats two helpings of both. We are nut lovers, so the toasted almonds were GLORIOUS and the perfect compliment to the softly roasted potatoes and onions. We discussed how important it is to use a SWEET onion alongside sweet potato. I cannot imagine using a regular, strong onion. It just wouldn't work flavor-wise. Otherwise, I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was divine. He told me to "put this in the rotation."

I can't handle those super sweet recipes--at holidays I just skip them.  I loved this--the flavors were each distinctive, but they blended well. I had to punt a little on this (who keeps Amaretto on hand?).  I used bourbon, which worked quite well, and slightly increased the amount of oil.  Also used a bit more thyme because I really like it--it is a prominent ingredient.  I didn't have almonds, so I toasted some walnuts and sprinkled them on top.  The walnuts go very well with the whole mixture.

This is so yummy. I have even just sliced the potatoes and onions to save time. To save $$, I use almond flavoring rather then the liqueur. But this is a great recipe.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I left it uncovered the whole time because I love everything to really caramelize. It was a big hit and I'll definitely make it often for an everyday side dish as well as for holiday spreads in the future.

I also didn't have amaretto and used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  This was an AMAZING dish!  One that I'm sure to use over and over again.  Thank you so much!

I made this for dinner and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I did only use one Sweet onion though because it was very large.  Instead of the amaretto liquer, I found amaretto syrup in my grocery store.  It was very tastey.

I was expecting a more "roasted" texture for the sweet potatoes, and they came out more "steamed", perhaps because of being covered for the first 30 minutes; the amaretto flavor does not really come through either.  Did not really care for this one.  Thanks for the post.

AWESOME recipe for a non suger coated sweet potatos. The Almerato gives it the perfect sweet taste, and the onions make it so that the sweet is not too overpowering. My husband said that there were too many onions, but I LOVED IT!

We really like this.  A nice alternative to the sugary sweet potato dishes.  I've never used the amaretto liqueur, but follow the rest pretty closely.

mmmmmm, this makes a very tasty side dish. i followed the recipe as written with the exception of using chopped almonds instead of sliced. my boyfriend's not a big fan of nuts but he still managed to clean his plate! we served this with pan fried walleye. thank you jean!
