Nice change from the typical pasta salad and I can easily see this as a main dish, like JARRIE has suggested. I didn't soak the red onion in water because we like the strong taste of it. Besides this, I didn't change a thing except adding some sliced black olives for color and extra flavor. Next time though I might add more red onion. I made the French-Greek Dressing from this site and it was delish (please read my review on the dressing). It's flavorful, fun and definitely a keeper. Thank you JARRIE for sharing

Super tasty and easy. I had lump crab, so used that instead of tuna. Yum. Didn't have dried tomatoes, so used one small fresh, mostly for color. Increased feta, parsley and capers. Would def add olives next time. Great recipe!

Great salad.  A little more involved and expensive to make  than my usual tuna pasta salad, but worth the money and effort.  I used regular rotini, added some green olives, and used one recipe of the French Greek Salad Dressing as another reviewer suggested.  I only had time to refrigerate it for 30 minutes before eating, but it was enough.
