Great recipe!  I made some changes, but they are also delicious as-is.  I reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup and they were still quite sweet (you could probably eliminate the white sugar all together if you wanted).  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and half white.  I omitted the dates and added butterscotch chips.  VERY TASTY!!

Excellent cookie.  After reading the reviews I didn't add any white sugar at all.  Turned out just right for us.  I didn't have alot left in my cupboard so I used raisins in place of coconut and almonds in place of peacans.  Would make again.

I would suggest trying these cookies, they sound unusual, but are very good.
Firstly, the 10 min time @ 325 takes too long, so I upped temp to 375. If you use sweetened coconut flakes then use 1/4 cup less sugar overall. And half the dates and add 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Its a good cookie, it takes a long time to cook 60 cookies, but its well worth it!

The wheat germ is subtle. I added chocolate chips. I made them twice within a couple of weeks to use up wheat germ that was about to expire. A nice chewy/crunchy oatmeal cookie with a twist.

My husband eats nothing with nuts or coconut in it - for 10 years I have not been able to trick him into trying them! He saw me put the nuts in these, but not the coconut, but they must have looked so good he was willing to try. He can't stop eating them now, even though I confessed to the coconut. Truly magical cookie!

Yummy!!  I left the dates out, but otherwise made it as called for.  If you're not a sugar freak, they might be a bit too sweet, so you probably could leave out 1/4-1/2 cup sugar and they'd taste fine.  I used a medium scoop to make my cookies and they turned out to be a nice size, but a little thin in the middle after they were finished.

I had my reservations about this recipe, but aside from being just the tiniest bit too sweet it is an outstanding recipe with a thin, crispy, delicious outcome

I scaled the recipe in half (and swapped chocolate chips for dates), and the first batch turned out terrible - I thought the dough looked too "creamy" but thought I'd try it anyway; they flattened out into a chewy-fall-apart pancake. Tasted good, but didn't look good at all. I added probably a 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour to the dough I had left, and the next batch turned out beautiful and delicious. Wish I would have followed my instincts with the first  batch! After I adjusted it they were great!

i followed advice and reduced sugar by half.  Instead of pecans I used dry roasted unsalted almonds.  End result good texture and crispiness,  but mine turned out salty, even though I used unsalted butter. Weird I'm not reading anyone else had this issue. I will try again, next time without 1/2 teas salt.

I have made these cookies a couple of times now and I tweak it each time.  I too leave out the white sugar completely and use organic brown sugar as well as wheat flour.  Instead of butter I used organic coconut oil, softened but when mixing the dry ingredients in, it still seemed dry so I added about a 1/2 cup of applesauce and that did the trick!  Very tasty recipe that can be adapted to whatever you want in it.  I use coconut, pecans and choc. chips. Very good!

Fantastic! My mother in law makes a good oatmeal chocolate chip recipe that is not very healthy.  These were as good or better than that!  (Even my husband agrees.)  My only changes were that I used cranberries (because I had them) and added about 0.5 cup of chocolate chips.  Baked at 325 for about 10 minutes in a convection oven.  Crispy yet chewy.  Fantastic!

The store was out of my BF's favorite flaxseed cookies, so I took matters into my own hands... These are excellent, guilt-free cookies; perfect for breakfast. As per others, I cut the white sugar altogether and made up for it with 1 cup butterscotch and 1 cup white chocolate chips. I used 1 cup chopped dates but wish I had used more as the flavor isn't so strong. Baking at 325* was taking at least 14 minutes, so I upped to 350* and baked for about 12 minutes. They do not flatten during baking. (I had a near miss of forgetting the eggs and vanilla - added it after combining everything else with no problem.) Yielded 45 germ-ily delicious cookies!!

This is one of the most delicious moist/crispy cookie I have ever made.  My husband does not like raisins and has never tasted a date until now.  He didn't ask what they were and I didn't say but he's gobbled them down like nobody's business.  This 3rd time making them, I used 1 cup of organic coconut oil rather than butter, 1/2 cup white sugar (+1 cup brown), 1 cup whole wheat flour rather than all purpose, 3/4 cup wheat germ + 1/4 cup bran and stuck a half date in the middle plus I still used the 2 cups of chopped dates.  Rolled it into the ball and some just stuck it in the middle like a bird's nest cookie.  Didn't matter, they are delicious.  I rolled the dough into balls and flattened before baking and/or flattened after baking but before they cooled. These cookies are my number one cookie to make.  Good bye chocolate chip!

For a healthy cookie recipe, these are amazing!  The only thing I changed was I didn't have dates, so I substituted dates for dried blueberries.  Tasted great with the coconut and pecans!  Excellent cookie!

These cookies were awesome!!! I followed 2 pieces of advice from other reviews. I decreased the white sugar to 1/2c, and instead of dates and nuts, I added in 1c of milk chocolate chips. They turned out AMAZING!!!! However, at 325o, my cookies too 20 minutes to cook. They were definately worth the wait.

YUMMY!! These were so good and kind of good for you! I made them exactly as recipe stated, except  used 1/2 C. instead of 1 C. of sugar. (used all of the brown sugar) I have a major sweet tooth so usually things are not too sweet for me, and these were sweet enough. My cookies did turn out pretty crumbly though and didn't stay together but that won't stop me from making again.

I made these for my toddler, however, my husband and I ended up eating most of the cookies. I used only about a ¼ cup of white sugar as advised by other reviews and it was plenty sweet. The next time I make these I think I will omit the white sugar all together.  I also omitted the coconut, pecans, dates and added about 3 cups of raisins (because they were supposed to be for my toddler…). Everyone who tried them loved them. I may use additional oats the next time I make them as another reviewer did for more of a “healthy” cookie.

These cookies are really good...they are sweet and chewy...absolutely delicious!  This recipe required a couple non-stock ingredients but was well worth the effort.  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and used reduced fat shredded coconut from Trader Joes.
