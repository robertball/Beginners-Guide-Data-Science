Loved the burgers, I added about 1/2 cup of dried onion rings which added some flavor for sure.

This was a tasty recipe. I cooked it on the stove top and it turned out fine. I think ranch dressing would be good on this too.

This was yummy. The burger has a softer more meatloaf texture due to the addition of the crumbs (I used panko), so you do need to toast the bun to get some crunch in this. The peppers and cilantro in the burger tasted good as well as were very pretty.

Didn't like this recipe at all. Maybe I just couldn't get past the ground chicken though. Will not make again.

This was awesome! My husband put some heavily oiled aluminum foil on the grill so that they wouldn't fall through the grates. We couldn't believe how wonderful this dish was. so easy and so gourmet. My husband raved and raved.

I really liked this recipe. My kids are super picky about vegetables, so I put everything in my chopper to make it extra fine. I liked the texture of the finer chop. Will make again.

So glad I made this! The burgers are very tasty, and the sauce puts it over the top. I did add more mayo because it was a wee bit soupy after I added the lime juice. I cooked the burgers on my Cuisinart indoor grill and it worked great. Will definitely be making these again!

Made this for lunch today for me and my wife. We substituted the chicken for turkey and cooked it on the stove top. Pretty good recipe. Going to make it again with some tweaks. Thanks!

Five stars!!! Loved loved loved! Wasn't quite sure if I would like how everything turned out, but amazing! We put it in a lettuce wrap vs a bun & we liked how that made it not too "heavy" :) ~ the wife

The spicy Tartar sauce really makes this burger.  The teenager ate it without the sauce although didnt say much - no leftovers. (for teens that is a level of endorsement.)

Didn't get time to make the tartar sauce. Maybe that is the ticket to make this a great burger

This is an excellent recipe. It sounds odd to add the tartar sauce but it makes the dish. This is a brag worthy recipe,

This is a keeper, I made on stove top. Hamburgers just disappeared in my house after tasting this. Also this is much healthier than hamburgers.
