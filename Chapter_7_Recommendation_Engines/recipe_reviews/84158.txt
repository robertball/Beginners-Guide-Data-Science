Delicious! I made changes, but the basic recipe had to work or my changes wouldn't have worked. I increased the persimmon puree to about 2 1/2c. and used 2 eggs (felt the 2 T. egg was a typo).  In addition to the spices listed, I added about 1 tsp. of allspice. I used whole grain flours, and (since I didn't want to mill more whole wheat pastry flour) I used half spelt flour. At the end of mixing, I stirred in 1 c. butterscotch chips and 1 c. flaked coconut.  These cookies turned out very moist like a good fruit cookie should. I noticed more of the persimmon flavor than in other persimmon cookie recipes I've tried and really liked that. The stir-ins I added gave additional sweetness and texture.  I will be using this recipe again and next time I'm going to try stirring in some raisins.

Excellent and moist.  I substituted one cup of flour with oat flour and turned out great.  Would also suggest milling or blending the persimmon pulp to remove the strands and other pulpy pieces for smooth consistency.

Great cookies.  We are a gluten free egg free lactose free family and still I could make these cookies.   I used 2 cups of rice flour, 1 cup of chickpea flour, 1 cup of Milo flour and 2 teaspoons of xanthan gum. Egg replacer and margarine in place of the ingredients that I cant use for my family.  Delicious!

These are the best soft cookies! I come from a family that hates persimmons with a passion, but these cookies won them over. 

A little variation I made was to add 1/2 of a persimmon finely cut up into little chunks and a handful of finely chopped walnuts to the cookie dough. I also made the cookies slightly larger.

 I have made 5 batches for 20 people so far and they are begging for more!

I used half white sugar and half brown sugar for the rich taste.  I also put dried cranberries in them.  YUM!!

I cut the recipe in half and used gluten free 1 to 1 flour. The color is a little odd but they have a great taste!

I used the recipe and used just a bit more pulp. I added raisins and pecans to some. I liked the walnuts only best but I don't like super sweet cookies and deserts. These were moist and great with coffee in the morning. Everyone loved them. I made about 8 dozen. I gifted some; but the company and family couldn't keep their hands off.

I made some exactly as the recipe said and I thought they were dry and tasteless. I then added raisins and topped with cinnamon and sugar and they were still dry but editable. I lowered the oven to 350 degrees and they were the best however, I would never make this recipe again.

Great recipe! I halved the batter and added semi sweet chips. Kids loved them. Reminded me of a muffin top. I wanted a little kick & density so I added 1 tsp. Allspice and 1 additional cup persimmon puree. Will make again!

These were more like little cakes than cookies.  They were wonderful, and my family gobbled them up in record time.  I will be making more today.
