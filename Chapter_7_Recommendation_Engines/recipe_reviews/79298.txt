i hsve used a similar recipe for many years at christmas time to make christmas balls.  it is a great treat for people who can not eat alot of sugar.  if you leave chips out and color half of mixture with green and red food coloring, then using ice cream scoop dip out on parchment paper and cook as instructed it is fun.  you can add sprinkles and other decorations.

The recipe came out fine but it was too sweet for me so next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar used.

My oven's tempurature settings are a bit finicky and I think that came into play here. The cookies didn't quite puff up like they are supposed to, but they still tasted great. Very easy recipe (and almost always follows a dinner where I am using hollandaise sauce).

This is an interesting cookie to include in my Christmas Cookie tins.  I like it because it's different and I got a lot of compliments on it.  Next time I will tint the mixture for the holidays - oh, and I like the idea of using them as ghosts for halloween and just using the mini chips for eyes.  I left them in the oven overnight and they really did turn out perfect.

This was the first meringue recipe I ever tried, and once my dad reminded me after my first attempt that you are supposed to use room-temperature eggs it turned out great! But as someone mentioned, I think it is a little too sweet. I think either removing some of the sugar or the chocolate chips would make it better.

My mom always made meringue cookies when I was a kid...these worked great to make little ghosts for our Halloween party.  I left out the choc. chips and just used them for eyes.  Very cute and yummy, too.

I baked the cookies at 350 like the recipe stated - after 1 hour they were burned.  I cannot imagine what they would look like after 4 hours.  These cookies need to be baked at 200 degrees or less.

These are really good! My mom made something like this once when I was growing up so I was happy to find this recipe! I've seen others but they had more steps and the recipe my mom used is more like this one. Yum yum! They are a little crumbly when you bite into them so they make lots of crumbs.
