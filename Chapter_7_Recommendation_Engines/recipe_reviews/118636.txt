I'd give this recipe five stars for taste, but the color makes it four stars.  The ranch and red salsa make an unusual pink color...almost the same color as mixing ketchup and mayo.

I mix up this whenever I make taco salad for the family. I use the Dry Ranch Seasoning Mix and mix up a batch of the ranch dressing and then add the salsa. It's a nice change from your sour cream and salsa on the taco salad.

This was good, a little heavy so we couldnt eat much. I blended the leftover and used as a salad dressing, that was awesome!

This is not the prettiest salsa I ever made.  It is extremely easy and very tasty.  We like it "hot" in our house so I added sliced jalapeno peppers to the hot salsa.  This would be good in taco salad too.

I made this salsa at a party, instead of cutting up fresh tomatoes I used a can of seasoned dice tomatoes. I also left out the chilies. It was very good.
