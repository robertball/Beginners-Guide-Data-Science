excellent!! i browned ground beef, drained the fat, used 3 Tbsp per pound of meat and i added 1/2 Tbsp flour to the seasoning and mixed thoroughly before dusting the meat with it. i added 2/3 cup of water, mixed it up with the ground beef and let it simmer down. would be great with shredded beef or chicken too.it is def hotter than the packaged stuff, so if you don't like hot, would reccommend cutting the red pepper flakes. it is salty too. don't substitute sea salt for table salt. it is not an even swap. i did cut the sea salt down slightly...i am making a huge batch of this, sealing it in mason jars with my foodsaver and giving as gifts for christmas. thanks for sharing. i will never go back to packaged mix!!

This is a fantastic seasoning recipe! Like others have mentioned, no more seasoning packets for me. The flavor was so much richer. I didn't tell anyone of the change (I cook for a family of 10) and got lots of excellent compliments. I did receive one complaint about the dish I made, but it came from from a very picky young man who thinks that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. :-)  After the first time I used this recipe, I made up a large batch of seasoning to have on hand. It was so easy since I had all of the spices in my pantry anyway. I found that 2 *very* heaping tablespoons of the seasoning equals about one regular seasoning packet. My family likes things a little spicy though, so two regular tablespoons would probably be sufficient.

I substituted 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes, and my VERY PICKY 12 year old daughter loved it in our homemade taco dip & taco's as well!  (I would however suggest maybe just the 1 tsp. of cumin).  We figured out that 21/2 - 3 tablespoons = one 1.25 oz. packet, which I will NEVER go back to!  Thanks so much Bill!

Of course, I tweaked it to up the garlic and onion to double. I'm a garlic/onion lover, and sometimes I substitute out those for the fresh version instead.  I added 1 tsp of cornstarch (or 2 tsp of flour will work) to the mix which allows the spices to cling more readily to the meat as a thickened sauce. The spice mixture is great, but sometime was missing.  I looked around at a few other recipes and found one mentioning a beef bullion cube.  I have Better than Bullion paste (beef or chicken) and add a tsp while cooking the beef.  What a difference! It really gives  the meaty flavor that was lacking (hard to believe more meatiness is needed in a pound of ground beef, but it's true).  Whichever recipe you use, try adding some meat stock paste or equivalent (but do consider the added salt from bullion if you like it not too salty).  Also this recipe doesn't mention it, but adding a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water towards the end after browning the meat with the seasoning allows the flavor to really mingle and absorb as you heat and reduce the sauce down a bit (that's where the cornstatch cling really shines). The water addition is just the basic instruction from the old packets I used to buy and it's not a step I'd ever skip.

This is excellent. It definitely tastes like the packet I usually used (will use this from now on). We mixed 1 lb. of browned-and-drained ground beef, this seasoning mix, plus a mixture of 2 tsp. of cornstarch and 2/3 cup of cold water. Then, we left it on low until all of it was warm.

This recipe was a life-saver!! After already mixing ingrediants for "seven layer taco dip," I realized that I was out of taco seasoning. Frantic, I ran to the computer and found this! YEAH!! I mixed it in with some cream cheese and sour cream to taste it first and it was great.  Worked even better in the dip!! If I'd had known how easy this was, I would have been making my own taco seasoning for a while now!! The only thing I changed was reduced the chili powder to 1/2 TBLS.  Very good and will make again!! Thanks Bill for posting this!

Very quick.  No reason to buy pre-packaged Taco Seasoning.  I followed recipe except slightly decreased amt of red pepper flakes and omitted onion powder (didn't have any).  I cooked 1 & 1/4 lb. low fat ground beef with fresh garlic; poured off fat.  Added Taco seasoning + 1/2 c. fresh, chopped onions + 1 cup water. Brought to boil and simmered for about 15 min.  Next time I would decrease water to 2/3 or 3/4 cup (I had a little too much liquid, but not a problem).  Very good.  DH loved these tacos!

This is absolutely delicious!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will NEVER go back to buying pre-packaged taco seasoning!! I love that I can make this recipe organically and especially love the fact that it is MSG FREE!! 

I found that if you add approximately 2/3 cup water to 3 tablespoons seasoning per pound of meat it makes the best flavor. I also prefer to add 1 Tablespoon flour to the recipe as this allows the seasoning to "stick" to the meat.

I love cooking and really like making things from scratch when I can.  I like this recipe because you can adjust the salt to your liking...this is good for those who are trying to watch their sodium in-take. My husband didn't realize I had made taco seasoning until I told him.  It tastes just like it came from a package. These are ingredients I always have in my cupboard, so I can whip this us anytime.  Thanks Bill.

I made this one night when I realized I didn't have any taco seasoning.  This was great and couldn't have been easier.  I did use a little bit of tomato sauce with the hamburger meat before putting in the spice.  I am not sure how much I used, but there was some left over.

I made super yummy enchiladas from this. Use this full recipe plus a can of tomato sauce and 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/green chilis (like Rotels) and throw it in a crock pot w/a few chicken breasts. After the chicken is cooked, shred it up and add about a third of the sauce to the chicken. Roll into flour tortillas with a bit of cheese (I used sharp cheddar). Put a little sauce in the bottom of a pan, place the enchiladas in the pan, cover with the rest of the sauce, then top with cheese and bake. So good.

We've been using this recipe for a few months now and we love it.  I use it in meat for tacos, nachos and in tortilla soup recipes.  In my opinion the recipe is right for 1 pound of meat.  I make this up 4 oz at a time (4x the recipe) and keep it on hand. I was out of paprika for a while and it was great even without it.  Thanks for sharing.  **edit 2.25.11 I am still making the all the time... except for now I adjust the recipe for 80 servings (yes, 1/2 cup chili powder at a time!) and it lasts great in the plastic storage container.

If comparing this to packaged, commercial seasoning mix this is very similar and very good. Submitter has the blend and balance of flavors spot on! Easy enough to adjust to personal tastes and I would highly recommend starting with a minimum amount of red pepper flakes and black pepper.  You can always add more, but you can't take it out, so better safe than sorry. For us that meant eliminating the red pepper flakes altogether and cutting back on the black pepper by half.  I did not find it necessary to add any flour or cornstarch as some others did, but I did add some water to moisten the meat and make it nice and juicy.  I found one recipe was the perfect amount for a pound of ground beef.

My friend from NM swears this is the best! I make 8x the recipe, store it in a Ziploc bag in the freezer, & scoop out 3 T. per 1 lb. ground beef (plus 2/3 c. water). I make the following changes: cut cumin to 1/2 tsp., cut salt to 1/4 tsp., cut black pepper to 1/8 tsp., add 1 tsp. brown sugar, and substitute a pinch of cayenne pepper for the 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper. No preservatives...WONDERFUL taste!!!

Really good recipe. I use less salt since I'm on a low sodium diet. I also add a little trick I learned when I lived in Mexico. Just a tiny pinch of unsweetened cocoa powder. You can't taste it but it really adds something. iI double the garlic and onion powder and don't use the crushed red pepper since my son doesn't like it spicy. I also add a little cornstarch so the sauce gets a little thick.

I have seen this so many times on the recipe buzz and can't believe it has taken me so long to try it! I followed the top reviewer of the recipe and added the 1/2 Tblsp. of flour and 2/3 cup of water along with the seasoning. Those instructions worked out perfect. That same reviewer suggested 3 Tblsp of seasoning to 1 lb of ground beef. I measured out the recipe and it was basically 3 Tblsp so I used it all for one recipe. I would have been lost without the first reviewer. The flour and water are a must. I will never buy the packet seasoning again. It did have a slight hot kick to it. I think from the red pepper flakes, I am not sure. I did use a scant measurement of them and will probably reduce them even further next time. Other than that I believe this is a near clone of the packets but even better.

Excellent (with a few minor adjustments).
In place of the crushed red pepper I used 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Also added 1 tbs corn starch (as per some other recipes used for holding the mix onto the meat). 
Use ~2.5 tbs per 1 pound of ground beef.

Excellent! I used cayenne instead of crushed red pepper flakes and cut back a bit on the salt. This is so much better than the stuff you get in the packets! I'm definitely going to make a bit more and store it in an air tight container so I always have it on hand.

Everyone in my family loves this flavor. First time I made it, I didn't have onion powder. It was pretty good without it. Then I made it the second time I had every ingredient in hand. It was perfect and learned the onion power had to be in there. If you follow the recipe as it's written, I don't think it's as much as 3 TBS combined, but it's enough to season 1 lb ground beef + 1/4 onions and 1/2 red/green peppers (all chopped). I'd add at least 1 cup water to cook.  It's a keeper.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Made it to spec, but did use garlic salt and onion salt, not powder.
 It did not meet my idea of a great mix. Thought it could be better. Hubby said it was "fine"-he would have it again, but, that is not a 5 star review for him!!
 I prefer the store bought taco seasoning. It just has more zing to it. May try it again with more seasoning and analyzing the recipe.
Overall, in a pinch, it will work.

I would give this six stars if I could.  I will never use a store bought taco seasoning again.  It's easy to adjust the heat by adding or subtracting the red pepper.  I make a big batch and store it in a tightly covered jar.  One pound ground beef browned mixed with 3 tablespoons of the seasoning and 2/3 cup water- simmer for 10 minutes- makes perfect tacos/nachos.  I've also added it to my chili with excellent results.

I didn't know how much of the seasoning to use so I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. I have since read some of the previous reviews stating to use 3 tbsp/1 lb. meat w/ 2/3 cup of water. I will definitely try it again because I am thrilled to have a natural taco seasoning w/o all the added chemicals!

This was incredible. I didn't have crushed red pepper flakes so I used more chili powder in place of that and I had no onion powder so I added more garlic powder instead. I was using a 1/2 pound of ground beef and added a big heaping teaspoon of seasoning and it was PERFECT. Very spicy but not too spicy. You've got to try this recipe, the premixed packets aren't any better then this and it takes no time to make.

I did not care for this recipe of taco seasoning at all. I would have decreased the cumin which was extremely overwhelming and possibly the chilli powder also. I would have used more garlic and onion powder. (Salts plus sea salt were too salty.) Authentic Mexican flavoring is not like this at all. I love hot and spicy but the red pepper flakes and black salt were overpowering. More like the seasoning of chilli con carne. I will use my own recipe the next time or packaged rather than this recipe again.

I stumbled across this recipe and I'm glad I did!  I now double it and store it in a spice container so it's ready to go.  I make the recipe as is, except I leave out the red pepper flakes (so the kids will eat it) and decrease the salt (with all the flavor it's not missed).  I use about 1 1/2 tablespoons of taco seasoning mix per pound of ground meat (turkey/beef) and add in a tsp of corn starch.  I stir both into 1/2 cup of water and then add to the browned meat and simmer for a couple minutes.  Simple, easy and tasty tacos!

This was very good - I'm going to play with it a bit to see what we love. I added 3/4 cup water to 1 lb ground beef and this full amount - I had to let it simmer for a little longer then I was expecting but good flavor.

So tasty and SO much better then packaged taco seaoning. 10x the flavor without those nasty added ingredients. 
I agree with the reviewer below, 3tbsp per pound is perfect, and add about 2/3C of water and let simmer add more if desired.

I never buy the packaged stuff anymore. My husband and I love this. We use this recipe to season one pound of meat. Sometimes I cut down on the red pepper to reduce the heat. You have to try this!

This recipe may save your -- and your family's -- brains. Make a bunch of it!  Store-bought taco seasoning typically has more than one excitotoxin within to add 'taste' when it's added to ground beef.  Excitotoxins like MSG, disodium inosinate (and several others) burn out neurons by exciting them overmuch. They over-fire, then they die . . . leaving holes where they used to be.  Tons of this garbage is worked into processed food to give it taste -- even baby food. Google 'excitotoxins', do some research, and protect your family by using recipes like this one instead of buying something off the shelf.

I liked this a lot better than the store bought stuff.  I did modify it a little bit so the kids could eat it by leaving out the red pepper flakes and cutting the black pepper in half. There was still a tiny bit of heat to it and it turned out great!

Even though I did not put the crushed red peppers into the seasoning, my husband and I still enjoyed it.  I used it for chicken soft tacos.  Thank you.  Now I don't have to buy taco seasoning at the store.

Yummy! I love how you can control the salt, etc. in making your own. I cut the salt back to 1/4 tsp. And up the Paprika to 1 TB., and up the Oregano to 1/2 tsp. Better than ANY mix or taco seasoning envelope I've ever had! 2 TB. of this mix per lb. of ground meat works great! You too will want to triple this recipe, or even make enough to fill a jar for later use ;) That's what I do. You save a ton of money as opposed to those envelopes & it tastes better, no MSG and no corn flour or starches! Amazing recipe!

Wow, so easy and much richer tasting than the packets.  And no chemical flavor.  I looked for this recipe after noticing how much preservatives are in the packets.  Definitely use sea salt or kosher.  Table salt would be too salty and overpowering.

Perfect.  I read the suggestions from the other reviewers and was quite pleased at the outcome. I used a mortar and pestle to grind the spices together. This helped in breaking down the dried red pepper flakes and mixing everything together.

Y'know, all those folks that claimed it was too garlicky or too peppery or too something or, of all things, bland, must be using old, stale spices.  I don't want FLOUR of any sort in my seasoning mix, either.

This was a great blend and it is fun to tweak it.  I like to substitute jalapeno powder or cayenne pepper for the paprika.  I can do it salt-free for Mom, too.

After making it the first time, I made the following changes and it's perfect for us...spicy but not painful to the tongue.:
1/4 tsp salt; 1/4 tsp black pepper; pinch of red pepper flakes.  Per other recommendations, I also added 1/2 Tbs flour to this mixture. 

After browning the ground beef and draining it, put it back in the pan with 3.5 Tbs of seasoning (that's about how much this recipe makes) and 2/3 cup of water.  Stir it well, bring to a simmer and then simmer for 10-15 minutes.  If you don't simmer it for 10-15 minutes, the spices will taste raw and harsh.  They really mellow out during the simmer.

This had a lot of kick, but was too salty.  Next time I make it I will only add 1 teaspoon of chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Use three tablespoons per pound of ground meat.

I've been making this for the better part of a year. When it comes to tacos, I use 1lb grd beef, 3T of this mix, 1/2c water, and 1/2T flour (to thicken). I also add some to my pintos for burritos. I got caught without any mix or chili powder to make some for our tacos last week so I used a name brand taco sauce I had in the back of cupboard instead. My 11yo daughter politely asked if she could have chicken nuggets for dinner instead haha. I've learned my lesson - always keep this in cupboard!

if you change the servings to 40 it will fill a spice jar (the ones you buy in the spice aisle).  this is great and better for you than ol el paso (no msg and other chemicals).  I change the crushed red pepper flakes to cayenne for more of an authentic mexican seasoning. and be sure to start slow with the salt and add as you go (unless your anne burell of course and feel there isn't enough salt in the red sea to satisfy)!

We only make this now.... Never store bought. I love that I can control the spice, salt & everything else. Being able to buy the spices from our local natural food store & blend it all myself makes me happy that we are getting fresh every time. I use my empty spice containers from the spices I use, so no wierd tastes. We make anywhere from 5x - 10x a recipe & store in the glass containers with plastic wrap over the opening before putting the lid on. We use double when cooking per lb of meat, since we love the flavor... I only add about 1/4C water per lb of meat. 
This is nothing like anything we've had from the store... It is way better. I hate that those ones in the store have a thickening agent. I like how the seasoning goes into the meat, instead of coating it in a goofy nasty mess like those seasoning packets do. Reading other reviews, I am inspired to use this when making 6 layer dip (in the sour cream) since I only use this in ground meat.... Turkey, beef, & bison.
What I did to tweak this is added only 1/2 the amount of salt, added more cumin, & used the 'regular' chili powder. I measured scant as well, nothing heaping. I also added to my mini food processor & blended it all to a powder... Mixes it very well while grinding up the red pepper flakes & oregano. I can't believe some people thought it was too spicy & some thought it was bland! My 4yo & 6yo love it. They aren't your typical kids eating junk food. I suggest try it again; but tweak it!

So I didnt have any taco seasoning packets for dinner tonight....ALLRECIPES saved me again! I love this site, I've been using it since hubby and I have been together so thats over 12 yrs!!!! When you make this recipe, it will be enough for 1 lb of ground beef (browned and drained)...just mix in a bowl and add 2/3 cup of water to your pan and dump mix in. Simmer for about 12 min or so. Oh yes, it's a little on the spicy side so you can adjust your pepper flakes but it was WAY good...never going back to taco seasoning packets again and I had all the ingredients in my spice cabinet!

This was wonderful! I added one teaspoon of cornstarch as a thickener. Two tablespoons of the mix plus 2/3 cup water to a pound of browned and drained ground beef was just right! I quadrupled the recipe and have it stored in a mason jar. We have tacos at least once a week so I went ahead and made more! Thank you, Bill!

I thought this was great! I used this recipe, with a little less chili powder-1 1/2 tsp-bc I ran out. But it was still great. I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and a can of red beans, rinsed and drained, to a pound of browned hamburger. Mmmm! Thankss for sharing!

I usually buy a popular brand name seasoning packets....never again! I prefer mild seasoning so I didn't add any red pepper flakes. It was perfect. Thanks!

This is the best taco seasoning by far. I will never by store bought mixes ever again. This has a much better flavor and not to mention no additives or preservatives. My entire family agrees this recipe is a keeper, no need to look any farther. I generally double this recipe when making two pounds of ground beef and add about a fourth to a half cup of water.

Great seasoning! I did add a little cornstarch to help thicken things up but other than that I followed the recipe to a "T". I used 1 lb ground turkey, sprinkled on 2 TBS of seasoning and then added 2/3 cup of beef broth and the taco meat was delicious! Great recipe :)

Very good recipe as it is.   I added 1 Tbsp of flour to it to make it thicken a little and to add a little bulk to the recipe to make it easier to measure.   The way I use it, the meat has a meaty flavor and isn't completed masked, as the packets do.   However, there is still a distinct taco taste, which is perfect.   Compared to the packets, this is under 200 mgs of salt per serving, whereas the packets are about 600 mgs per serving.   I tried the recipe 1st with no salt and that was very blah.   I then stuck with the recipe on the 2nd attempt, but I think I could halve the salt and it would still be good.

This recipe is fantastic!  Since I don't like my taco too strong, I think I'll try to add about 2 T per pound of meat.  3 T was a bit to strong for me personally, though my husband loved it.  Otherwise for less heat, cut back on the crushed pepper.  Of course, add some water to simmer the meat and cornstarch or flour can thicken it if it is too runny.  2-3T recipe = 1 prepackaged spice.

DISAPPOINTED! I was really excited to try this recipe, per all the great reviews. However, there is just WAY to much pepper, that's all you taste! I think if you reduce the pepper to maybe 1/4 teaspoon then you would be able to taste all the other great flavors in the recipe. I also reduced the sea salt to about 1/2 teaspoon.

This recipe was a total let down. After seeing so many reviews I was sure that this was going to be good. But there was way to much pepper and not enought 'taste' at the end. The black pepper and/or chili powder overpowered it. Please, if you try this don't expect for it to taste like the 'store bought' seasonings like many reviewers said.

I originally made this to go in the "Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup" here, and it's excellent for that.  Then I tried it for taco meat, and I haven't bought a packet of taco seasoning since!  As another reviewer mentioned I stir 2 tsp. corn starch into a batch, and add 2/3 cup water to 1 lb. browned ground beef.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for a few minutes.  Perfect!  (I use 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper in place of the 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.)

This is an excellent recipe partly because it includes the oregano and many of the other recipes on the site don't. Like many others I tweak it. Well, actually I just use it as an "outline" and make the following changes every time I make it. (I actually don't make a taco seasoning per se, but tacos from scratch every time. This is about what you need for 1.5 to 2 pounds of ground beef.) First I omit the paprika and black pepper. I don't use "chili powder" and substitute 1.5 TBSP New Mexico chili powder and slightly increase the other spices. ("Chili powder" is powdered dry chilis mixed with a lot of these other ingredients that are in the recipe, while "New Mexico Chili Powder" is pure powdered "warm" chilis.) I use cayenne in varying amounts rather than pepper flakes because I can control the heat better with it and I like the flavor of cayenne a lot better than black pepper (I want Mexican, not cajun.) I use 1 tsp fresh garlic (the crushed stuff in a jar) and 1/4 cup of chopped onion (prechopped and frozen) not granulated. Just after draining the majority of the grease I add the onions and garlic in and saute for a few minutes until the onions are thawed and beginning to cook. Then I make a clear spot in the middle of the pan and add my spices, sauteing them in the little bit of hamburger fat for a minute or two at medium then add a TBSP of tomato paste for a couple of minutes and letting it mellow over the heat before I add the water. When I add the water I add a tsp or s

We go through lots of Taco Seasonings, which can get costly. I can't tell you how this compares by the time you buy all the necessary spices, but I can tell you that this recipe is the bomb!In a side by side taste test, my family couldn't tell the difference between this Taco seasoning and the famous brand name. Thanks Bill!

Great replacement for the store brands!  

The big name taco seasonings weigh in at 1oz per packet which seasons 1 pound of meat.  This recipe tips the scale at just 1/2oz and seasons the same amount of meat as the store package.  Why?  Read the label of the packaged brands...  You're getting another 1/2oz of maltodextrin, corn flour, MSG, corn starch, preservatives and anticaking agents.  Mmmmm.  No thanks!  

Admittedly, I did add a scant 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch to my finished seasoning to tighten up the finished meat sauce.  :)

I make quadruple batches of the seasoning (stored airtight) and use 1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons per 1 pound of meat.

This is a great recipe, much better than store bought and so much cheaper.  I make my taco meat in 3 lb. batches and so I triple this and add all of it and an 8 oz. can of ro-tel tomato sauce, not the tomatoes the sauce.  Wonderful, you have to try it :)

I haven't bought taco seasoning in years thanks to this recipe!  Amazing!  I play with the heat factor, keeping it pretty mild for the kids.  This is fantastic and economical, with no chemicals or preservatives.  Read the label sometime on a packet of taco seasoning.  Scary.

We use this recipe all the time for ground beef or ground turkey.  It's great because we can make it as spicy as we like, and there are no fillers.  We usually put 1/4 of water in the pan with the meat to make it easier to stir in.  Good stuff!

I'm not buying those packets of taco seasoning at the store anymore, now that I've found this recipe!  It's easy and tastes great.  The directions of this recipe are kind of vague, so here's what I did.  First, I only used 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes and only 1/2 tsp. each of salt and pepper.  This was just right for us.  I used one recipe for 1 lb. beef.  I browned the beef and drained it, added 3/4 cup water and stirred 1/2 Tbsp. corn starch into the seasoning, then added it to the beef.  Simmer for a few minutes and you have delicious taco meat!

This was delicious. Made it exactly as the recipe called for, added it to 1lb of beef along with a little cornstarch and water to help it sauce up and stick to the meat, and it was amazing. Better than the packaged stuff, I'm never going back. Ever!

The best taco seasoning recipe on this site (in my opinion). I doubled the recipe and the resulting tacos were proclaimed "the best" by the family. Warning, substituting cayenne for crushed red pepper flakes makes this mix even spicier! Delicious!

Perfect balance of spices. Although, I did do as someone else suggested and only used 1 tsp of cumin.  It doesn't say, but it seems to me that this recipe is designed for 1 lb ground meat. I doubled the recipe and used two rounded soup spoons (which was probably 2 Tbl)with 1 lb hamburger - it was seasoned perfectly.  My husband, 2 children and myself all loved this seasoning and we agree it makes the best tacos! (I also add black beans to my taco meat to add more fiber and protein.)  Will definitly make this again, and will make it in bulk next time.

I used this the other night. It did have a bit of a kick. It was very good. I used about 1 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1 1/2 cups water. Delicious! I will use this again.

wow.  just awesome!  and with none of the added sugar or msg or weird junk you find in the packets!  i followed EXACTLY times 4 and save in a tupperware container.  I also followed GREGSGIRL63 advice and drain oil, add 3 tbsp per lb and then add 1/4ish cup of water - turn to low, mix and let simmer/set for 10-15 min.  the water really helps the meat stay tender!  thanks for the tip!

This taco seasoning is excellent! I needed to find a good home made recipe since I can't have the preservatives found in many packaged items. This was a home run...even better than the packaged stuff anyway!

I usually make a huge batch of this (16x the recipe) and store it in an airtight container to use as needed. For my family, we add in a little cayenne for extra heat and reduce the salt as we like lots of flavour but it seems to get a little salty when a lot is added as written.

10.8.11  I see a couple one-star reviews posted recently.  This taco seasoning not only met my expectations, it exceeded them.  I just used it in Beef and Bean Crescent Burritos (AR site), and it provided lots of flavor with just the right amount of spiciness.  All I can say is it certainly worked for me!  I doubled the recipe, and the rest is in a spice bottle in the pantry.  ***UPDATE 7.15.17***  The ingredients in this seasoning are always in my pantry, so there’s really no reason to ever buy pkgs of taco seasoning.  This is as good, takes minutes to mix up, and costs you next to nothing.  I keep it on hand all the time.

My wife & I are trying to not inadvertently consume MSG anymore so we made this as directed, but left the salt out until the end and added 2 teaspoons of corn starch and 2/3 cups of water, as typically directed on the seasoning packet.  This worked famously for ~1.5 lbs of ground chuck.  We tasted it without ANY salt added and you could definitely tell there was just *something* missing, so I eyeballed some kosher salt in the palm of my hand and sprinkled it into the finished product while it was still on the stove and stirred it around really good, then tasted it and it was absolutely perfect.  I will be a TAD lighter on the cumin next time, but that's just a personal preference, not a complaint.  This tasted great.  I will NEVER EVER buy a taco seasoning packet again!

Amazing!  Better than what you get at the store and just as easy.   I've been using this recipe for several years now, and the ingredients are staple spices that I always have in my cupboard.  I discovered it one night when I was too lazy to go to the store for a packet of store-bought taco seasoning.  It's been my go-to recipe ever since.  You, obviously, will not be disappointed.

Delicious mix!  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because the recipe didn't give a ratio of spice mix to meat.  I tried to approximate the amount of mix to the amount in a store bought packet, and the finished taco meat was so spicy it made my 10 year-old cry...but he ate every drop!  After reading some of the other reviews (like I should have before using it the first time...silly me), I'll try 2 tbsp to one pound of ground beef next time.

This is a perfect replacement for taco seasoning packs!  Thank you!  I added 1 tsp of corn starch to the mixture for thickening, and used 4-5 tsps per lb of beef.

The supermarket left my taco seasoning packet out of the bag and I didn't realize it until the meat was already browning. I found this recipe here last minute and my taco dinner was saved! I left out the red pepper flakes to keep it mild and it was still delicious! One ounce wasn't quite enough for one pound of ground beef, so I will make a little more 
next time. I will never buy a packet again!!

I give 3 stars beacuase it's a good starting point.  For us, it was way to salty, even though I halfed it, and a bit on the hot side.  I also added some cornstarch and flour and mixed with water like other reviewers suggested to make a sauce for the meat.  Will try again with some adjustments to our tastes.

Excellent!!!  Use as much or as little with 1 lb ground beef and 3/4 cup water - my whole family loved the flavor of this.  
Note:  Substituted Minced Onion for the Onion Powder since I was out of Onion Powder.  
Substituted regular salt for sea salt since I didn't have any sea salt.
Didn't add any red pepper flakes, because I have two small kids and was unsure of the heat factor.

this is great! I left out the red pepper (for the kids) and my son said it was perfect-good flavor and not spicy. For my second round, I am going to up the garlic as it could stand to be stronger-Doesn't get easier than this-or cheaper! Thanks!

Just a note to those looking for the store-bought effect, when adding to 1 lb ground beef for tacos, remember to add 2 tbs flour to the dry mix and 1/4 cup water to cook.  This thickens it up a bit, which is what most folks are used to when using the pre-packaged mix.  This is a really good spice recipe!

A little too salty for our taste.  But I love that I can adjust the amount.  Perfect for quick soft tacos.  I browned one pound of ground beef then added the seasoning and about a half a cup of water.  Continued cooking until water evaporated.  Will definitely use the recipe again!

Very good seasoning and it's nice to be able to control the salt, unlike the packaged mixes. I cut back on the chili powder and salt, increased the cumin, garlic and onion powders, left out the pepper flakes and black pepper, and I added about 2 T dehydrated onion flakes. No need to buy packaged again--thanks Bill!

Made this for tacos last night and it tasted great! I added 1 1/2tsp of flour to it.  I used it on 1.25 pounds of ground turkey and it was just the right amount of spice!

Talk about saving the last meal of the day?!  I made the Mexican Casserole (which I got as the the Daily Allrecipes email).  I thought I had a packet of taco seasoning.  NOT!!...  So pulled up this quick & easy mix and YEAH BABY!!  My daughter thinks I'm Super-Woman.  Ok..lose the drama...But my kid thinks I'm pretty cool to work all day and come home and make a great "home-cooked meal".  This site rocks!

Delicious. I omitted the pepper flakes because chili powder is enough heat for me. I added 1 Tbs + 1 tsp to approx 1 lb of ground turkey. Perfect for nachos, burritos, and of course tacos. I could just eat it with a spoon. I didn't have to add any water since the turkey is so lean and creates just enough juice to mix the seasoning in perfectly. Thanks for the recipe.

I love the flavor of this recipe. This is SPICY. So if you are looking for a kid friendly seasoning, decrease the red pepper and chili powder. I make a quadruple recipe and store it so it is ready when I want it. I use 2-3 Tbs. per pound of meat and about the same or a little more water.

Nom-nom! I love this combination of spices for tacos so much, I only add one more thing to make it mine; 1/2 of a freshly dried bay leaf that I've run through the spice grinder. 
Also, when adding the spice mix to the cooked ground meat, I include 1/4 cup water mixed with 1/4 cup tomato sauce for moisture, and then reduce at a simmer for a few minutes before serving.

WHOA this was too salty!  Next time I would cut the salt in half.  Otherwise, the mix was tasty and I had everything on hand.  I also added 1/2 cube of chicken bouillon (didnt have beef) and 1 tsp cornstarch to the mix as another reviewer suggested.  This made about 3 TBSP of mix and I used all of it with 2/3 cup water for one pound of ground beef.

Followed the recipe as written.  I used 3 tablesoons of the mix with 1.25 lbs of ground turkey for a healthier version without sacrificing much flavor at all.  In fact, it was delicious.  I added 2/3 cup of water and let it simmer down.  I'll use this as my taco seasoning from here forward.

I didn't have a taco seasoning "packet" onhand, some I came here to look for a substitute.  This was perfect.  I actually liked it better than the store bought mix because it was a little spicier.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it- thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and got perfection!  I forgot to measure exactly because I kept adding until I thought I had added enough seasoning to my meat.  I bought some taco seasoning from a big-name warehouse store before, but when I used it, I didn't sleep all night long.  This will end that fear!  I KNOW what's in this one!  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed this just slightly, doubling the onion and garlic powders, adding 1/4 tsp. marjoram, and only using (less than) 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper.   It was just spicy enough.  My husband, who is always the skeptic, enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for a great recipe!! :)

nice to have a recipe that tastes so good and consists of ingredients that most people have on hand at home.  I recently heard how much better for you it is to make your own seasonings as opposed to buying them packaged at the store.

My family thought this was way too hot/spicy.  Maybe without the red pepper flakes it would have worked but it was a bit too much for us.

This is really good.  I do not like taco seasoning packets from store because of MSG and other unnecessary ingredients.  It is a little spicy, but I just use less.  Made up a jar full so I have on hand.

Finally! No more buying taco seasoning packets for me! Tastes wonderful. I add these spices to taco soup. It was delicious.

I used ground red pepper instead of the flakes and it was just the taste I was looking for! Perfect substitution when you forget to buy a packet! :)

I made a big batch of this a few months ago. We have really enjoyed it and have been perfecting the measurments to my families liking. We have found that 2T of taco seasoning and 1t cornstarch dissolved in 3/4C water works best for us. We've used it in a ton of different recipes from AR and our own recipes. We love this and will not go back to buying expensive taco packets. We use to only use Old Elpaso and now this is our go to! THANKS SO MUCH for the wonderful recipe!

I did not have any garlic powder, so I used garlic salt instead.  I also did not have any onion powder and I only used 1/2 tsp of table salt.  This is a very good taco seasoning recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I did exactly as recipe stated and actually used less of the chili powder, added flour as one person suggested and this did not impress me!  The chili powder was way too strong and it ruined the recipe.  I had to mix the beef with refried beans to conceal the bad taste so the beef would not go to waste.

Didn't like this at all. I usually use Old El Paso seasoning, and this was hotter and not as flavorful.

This was really good. So much better than the pre-packaged stuff which always tasted sort of "fake" to us. You can actually taste the meat using this recipe.  I cooked one pound of beef and added one can of black beans and used the whole recipe of seasoning. I added 2/3c. cold water with a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed in.

Great!  Realized I didn't have any packets and this turned out so good I don't have to bother with them!  Love being able to adjust my spice too!  I'm thinking about putting this in fancy jars and giving it as a Christmas gift!

This is a great taco seasoning. I sauteed an 
onion with the ground beef instead of useing onion powder. I used this to make a taco casserole instead of the store-bought seasoning packets, and the dish had great flavor with half the sodium. No need to buy the seasoning packets any more!

This is soooo good !!  I made Tacos for some friends the other night for the Mike Tyson fight.  The Tacos went ALMOST as fast as Tyson's adversary.  I increased the garlic, onion, red pepper and oregano to 3/4 teaspoons.  I like the fact that there isn't any thickening agent.  We like em juicy.  A real keeper.  Thanks.

This is a good base recipe and you can make the following small changes and this recipe will be very good:  Decrease the salt and pepper to 1/4 teaspoon each, decrease the cumin to 1 teaspoon, and here are the kickers...add 1 beef bullion cube and 1 teaspoon of flour.  The bullion cube will add the depth of flavor that is lacking, and the small amount of flour will thicken the final mix.  Just use a pound of browned ground beef and about 2/3 cup of water and let simmer until the liquid is absorbed and it will be a much better seasoning.

Excellent! After realizing I forgot taco seasoning at the store, I had hoped to find one on here.  Went with this one based on the rating and a couple of reviews. Luckily, I had all the ingredients on hand.  Wow.. I will never waste money on pre-packaged seasoning again!

Thank you for this recipe.  I have several recipes calling for "taco seasoning" and have always used the store bought packages.  They have way too much salt for me (and chemicals). I followed this recipe but added a little less salt.  It was excellent in my lentil and mushroom tacos.

Absolutely never going back to the packaged seasoning! As previously mentioned, I triple the recipe for 1lb of meat and add 3/4 cup of water. Let that simmer after browning the meat and voila! Delicious!

I use this recipe faithfully! I quadruple it to have enough for a few meals. The only adjustment I make is I use half Tony Chachere's Seasoning Salt and half regular kosher salt for the salt amount...it adds a little kick. Thanks for sharing!

This taco seasoning is the best! We don't even buy any store brand anymore (La Preferida was our preferred before this).

One thing to note: I use the entire recipe for 1.25 lbs. ground beef. After browning the beef, I drain it, wipe the pan out and then add the beef back to the hot pan. I then add the seasoning and a cup of water, bring it to a simmer and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes.

Also, because I like it saucier, I add a thickener. I looked at the store brands and most include corn masa, which is a thickener. You can pick up a couple pound bag of corn masa for about a buck and a half, and it will last you for hundreds of recipes - or you can try your hand at making tortillas! What I do is measure out all the other ingredients using a digital scale and then add enough masa to bring the total weight up to 1.25 ounces - which is the weight listed on most of the store bought taco seasoning blends.

I made this seasoning blend as written and added 1/2 tsp. of the mix to 4 ounces of fully cooked crumbled tempeh. I heated it up, put it in 4 warmed taco shells, topped it with warmed black beans,shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes,chunks of avocado and finely chopped cilantro and had a fantastic taco dinner for two!Thanks for a fat free vegan delight!

Really yummy! I did add a bit of water (1/3 c) after browning and seasoning the meat. Also, I've never added cornstarch or flour to my taco meat and think it's weird to "thicken" taco meat like that. Not sure - I'm in San Antonio and I'm not sure most places here thicken their meat. I've had plenty of "juicy" tacos. :) So, I won't follow those rec's. I did, however, let the meat simmer for 10 or so mins after adding the water (enough time to chop up avocado, lettuce, and tomato). I also think the recipe as written is a little on the spicy and salty side - I can handle the spicy, but my toddler can't, so next time I'm making this, I'm going to leave out the red pepper flakes, reduce the chili powder to 1 1/2 tsp, the black pepper to 1/4 tsp and the salt to 1/2 tsp.

I've always wanted to make my own spices and this one is fabulous! Perfect amount of spice and salt. I hate buying spices from the store and then I don't like them as expensive as they are. Thanks a lot for this one. We have taco thursday every week at my house.

Ever since I saved this recipe, I have not bought prepackaged taco seasoning. This is the best. I don't add any crushed red pepper flakes because my daughter doesn't like things spicy, but the chili powder and the cumin really give anything you add this to a mexican flavor. I use this in everything that asks for a package of taco seasoning, and I usually add the entire recipe.

This is a great seasoning mix to have on hand, I used freshly ground cumin as I only keep cumin seeds, and it really made it taste better.  I used one batch for the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup recipe from this site and it really made the soup.

This recipe uses basic spices that everyone has in their house, and it tastes great, so if you find one better I'd like to see it!  Other reviewers complained about the salt, but if anything, I think it could easily have taken a little more.  I replaced the 1/4 t of crushed red pepper with cayenne, but I barely noticed any heat.  Many reviewers added flour or cornstarch to thicken, and have the sauce "stick to the meat."  I intentionally did not do this, because that's how store-bought seasoning packets come out.  I did not want my meat gooey or thick like a sloppy joe.  I prefer my taco meat to come out crumbly and a little dry, just like how I see it at most mexican restaurants I've been to.  I also didn't want the spice to overpower the taste of the meat, and this recipe achieves that goal.  The next time I try this, I will follow the advice of some reviewers and add some beef base to the meat.  I've come to find that "Better Than Bouillon" is a great product, and worth the extra money for great flavor.  I'll never use bouillon cubes again.  Everyone should have Better Than Bouillon chicken and beef in their fridge!

tastes just like the envelope mixes- only a lot cheaper to make!! I also add 1 tsp. cornstarch per recipe.  1 recipe equals 1 packet of taco seasoning in the envelope. I make it in bulk (x 5 or x 10) and keep in a glass hermes jar. Add 3 Tb. per pound of meat along with 1/4 -1/2 C. water and allow to thicken a bit. Wonderful!

I've made this countless times. I just use garlic powder for the onion powder and some cayenne for red pepper flakes. Used regular salt for sea salt. This is so easy to measure out because it's such a forgiving recipe. Delicious! We think it's better than store bought packages.

I was in the mood for tacos and had no seasoning, nor did I feel like going out in the snow. Whipped this up, and wow! You can't tell the difference! Yummy!

This recipe tastes very good. I did end up having to make five times the amount though so I believe the servings maybe off.

I had a houseful of hungry friends when I realized that I'd bought all the taco ingredients but seasoning! I found this recipe and happened to have everything on hand. It was fast, simple, and nobody noticed that it wasn't the usual stuff. I halved the salt and used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes (didn't have any). It tasted great on both ground beef in the skilled and on the chicken taco filling I made in the crock-pot (I added the seasoning for the last hour of cooking, out of eight). Three tablespoons per lb of meat.

I left out the red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt. (Cooking for young kids! And since we were using the whole recipe, the chili powder was spicy  enough.) I left out the oregano too, but I'll try it in there next time. I added the whole spice mixture to 1 lb. of browned ground beef, then added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes (which contained salt, so finished product was plenty salty), and about 1 tsp. of flour to thicken (mixed into the juice from the tomatoes). The result was spectacular. Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.

I can't believe I have not rated this before because I have made it many times.  It is my go-to recipe for taco seasoning.  I follow the recipe as is except I leave out the salt because we are trying to reduce our sodium intake.  I think it tastes better than the packaged seasoning.   Thanks for a great recipe.

EXCELLENT! Taco Seasoning I is the best bet for all of my taco seasoning needs, whether we're in the mood for chicken or (ground) turkey. Mixes up in a snap using spices I keep on hand in my spice cabinet. I am very happy with the recipe as it is, but it can be adjusted to suit the tastes preferences of even the pickiest eater!

As good as or better than the mix we buy from the store. Convenience when I ran out of the store mix was great. I didn't have onion powder, so used 1/8 tsp onion salt instead. Thanks for sharing!

It was a bit spicy for my family so I leave out the red pepper flakes. Per other readers, I also added a teaspoon of corn starch to make it all stick. YUM! I love that I no longer have to use the packets that list MSG as the first ingredient! Thanks a ton!

This is so good!  I always make up a big batch and keep it in my pantry.  My husband likes plain hamburger on his tacos, so I like that I can just add as much of this as I want to my taco meat, and keep his plain.

This was so easy to make, and everything in the pantry for it!  It is very good, but agree with the last review that it is a little bit spicier than the packet version.  With having little kids, will probably leave out the red pepper flakes next time.  Great with 1.5 lb. of beef!

Excellent flavour. Much better than store bought. I only gave it 4 stars because I found it to be a little salty. I made it as is, then with half the salt and a 3rd time with no salt, it was even better without the salt...but everyone has different tollerances to salt...if you are used to a diet with very little salt then this recipe doesn't need it...but if you are used to alot of salt in your diet or have diminished taste buds, you might like the salt.

Outstanding!  I've tried quite a few recipes for tacos but I think I've found the one I'll keep.  Didn't change anything except I omitted the hot pepper and halved the salt as a personal preference.
I have to say I was a bit disappointed when I tasted the meat/seasoning mixture on it's own but when we built up the tacos with all the fixings it was a grand slam.  Awesome.  Simply Awesome.

We love this seasoning.  Why ever buy pre-packaged again?  The only suggestion I would offer to others who are making large batches of this at a time as I do is to NOT double the salt.  I usually make a quadruple batch at a time, and only double the salt rather than quadrupling.  (The salt is fine if you're only making one batch.)

FABULOUS.  I doubled the recipe and used it ALL with 2 pounds of ground beef.  It has just the right amount of heat without being overpowering.  My seven-year-old was able to eat it and asked that I make it again.  To be fair, she does enjoy spicy food - just not painfully so.
This is going in my TACO TUESDAY recipe box folder for sure!!

Wow! This is a keeper! SO delicious and easy; WAY better than prepackaged stuff. We are going to make this in bulk to keep on hand for use, not just with tacos, but as a rub for steak and ribs as well as BBQ chicken rub.

I have made this several times now.  I ran out one evening and got lazy and bought a store-made packet of seasoning.  My husband immediately noticed the difference and now we are back to this recipe for good.  It's just right!

Super great! I quadrupled the recipe so I would have some on hand. I accidentally put 1 TBSP of garli instead of 1 TSP!! But i dont mind garlic so it was fine. Next time i will make sure i do it right! Very good in taco meat with a little water.

Excellent!  My husband said this was better than packets. Since he's on a low sodium diet i used  1 tsp. mrs. dash southwest chipolta seasoning instead of salt.  I'll never use packets again.

Excellent seasoning for ground beef. Also excellent on chicken too. I like the fact that you know exactly what's going in your taco meat. Store bought taco seasoning has so many preservatives and nasty stuff in it, like MSG & tons of sodium. Plus you can omit or add accordingly. I added a touch of cayenne because we like our stuff with a kick. Definitely a keeper!

Made this last night when we realized we only had one taco seasoning packet. My husband is pretty finicky when it comes to spiciness, so I decided to try this recipe...boy, was I impressed! I will never go back to packet seasoning again. I agree with the highest rated review, 3 tbs. per pound of meat is perfect!

I have a gluten intolerance and because of it have a very difficult time finding a taco seasoning that doesn't contain any flour. This is awesome! I omitted the crushed red pepper flakes because I have a very wimpy palate when it comes to heat. My kids could not tell the difference from what they usually get and my husband preferred this to the packet seasoning! This will now be my "go to" taco seasoning. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my new standby for taco seasoning, I always have all the ingredients on hand, no added sodium like the packets of seasoning.  I used crushed habanero peppers instead of the crushed red pepper flakes, was very spicy!!  Overall the best taco seasoning you can make!  Try it you won't be dissapointed.

Like many others, I WILL NEVER buy packaged taco seasoning again! That said, I took away one star because it doesn't really say how much per pound of this to use and whether to add water and how much, etc.  But it is a very good seasoning! Thanks for sharing Bill!

This a great seasoning mix! I did double the onion & garlic powder but left everything else the same. I used 2 1/2 level Tablespoons of seasoning for 1 lb of ground beef. I loved this so much I made a huge batch of it and put it in Mason jars to give away as Christmas presents.

Increased onion and garlic powder to 1/2 tsp, the cumin to 2 tsp. Used 1/8 tsp cayanne pepper instead of pepper flakes and added a tablespoon of flour to the mixture. Fantastic! Will never buy a taco seasoning packet again. Thanks!

I tried making this with ground beef, but had to use so much of it (almost the whole batch for just 1/2 lb of meat) that it's really not worth it. I like that you can control how much salt goes in it, but wish it had more flavor. Sorry!

This is a great recipe.  The flavor was a lot richer than store-bought seasoning mixes.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Used the entire mix in 2 lbs. of ground beef.  I will definitely be making a large batch of this to keep on hand.

This recipe is a big MONEY $aver.  I just changed one thing.  I use ONE tsp of garlic pepper in place of the tsp of sea salt and tsp pepper, simply because the garlic pepper has salt and pepper in it and a little additional garlic never hurts.

This was exactly what I was looking for when I found myself without taco seasoning on hand. Have 4 kids. Didn't want to run out just for taco seasoning, and the taco salad was already started. The spice was perfect, even for my youngest eater (1). Thanks for this lifesaver! My only suggestion is to double or triple this recipe, so that you have some on hand!!!

This was a lifesaver!  I was in the middle of making tacos for dinner & had all the fixins except for taco seasoning.  I grabbed the computer & whipped up this recipe.  Fortunately I had all the ingredients on hand.  I added the entire mix to about 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef with 2/3 cup of water.  Delicious!  No more packet mixes for me.

Great seasoning blend. My family loves it and I've found it easy to adjust the spice level down by cutting out or cutting back the red pepper flakes without effecting the flavor.

Of all the home-mixed seasonings I've put together, this one far excels them all for mirroring the flavor of prepackaged, without the added preservatives and sodium.  I, too, added about 2/3 cup of water after adding the mix to the ground beef.    Thanks, Bill, for a well-executed mix!  :D

I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe! And like so many b4 me have said in their reviews, "Forget ever buying the Taco Seasoning packets ever again!" Here's a nifty idea -- if you make it w/ the quantity as written in the recipe, a perfect storage solution is the small, rectangular containers that baby food come in.

I was a bit skeptical only because I've unfortunately become accustomed to the salty, store-bought taco seasoning.  But boy am I glad I decided to try this!  It was very good!  I read some reviews and followed these suggestions;  omitted the black pepper, used 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper in place of crushed red pepper, added 1 tsp. corn starch, and added 1/2 tsp. of beef bouillon paste during the simmering process. I used 3/4 to 1 cup water and it was too much.  Next time, I will use 2/3 cup.  It's a wonderful taco seasoning without all of the unnecesssary salt!

This is a great seasoning mix. I always keep a batch on hand. Way better than any seasoning packet you'll buy from the grocery store. The only thing I do differently is substitute dried cilantro for the oregano and add in a little cayenne pepper.

Good but too spicy for me, next time I'll cut down on the chili pepper and red pepper.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef and doubled the seasoning recipe.

I have tried several recipes for taco seasoning and something was always missing. This recipe is it! If you prefer mild seasoning start with just 2-3 teaspoons of seasoning per pound of meat. If you like it spicy, I would use 2-3 Tablespoons. Thank you for the recipe. I'll never buy packaged seasoning again!

Very good and so much healither than the packaged, especially since you can control your salt. Go look at all the gross stuff in the packaged taco seasoning and you'll WANT to make this. It's so easy!

Fantastic! I scale back on the chili powder to accomodate childrens’ palates, and omit the red pepper flakes. I love that I can make this at home and that it does not have any additives.

Great and easy! I will make a big batch of this to keep on hand. 3 Tbs to 1 lb. ground beef is a good start. More if you like it spicier.

Made as directed, used all of it on 2 lbs ground beef with a little water added to help incoorporate it. We thought it was great, and no need to buy anymore store bought packets of salty flavoring!

This is very good - but I'd make a few changes next time I make it.  I would used dried, minced onion instead of the onion powder, double the cumin and substitute a pinch of cayenne for the pepper flakes.  Also, I like how the packaged kind thickens up a bit, so I added a tsp or so of cornstarch to the mixture.  I LOVE that it is all natural and NO MSG!!!

Since I have found this recipe, I have never gone back to store-bought taco seasoning again!  This is such a great recipe!  I always use 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and add 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper, but that's because we like our taco seasoning HOT!!  Thank you so much for this MUST HAVE recipe!  :)

When added to ground beef, it makes it taste just like very good taco meat.  I've followed the recipe's measurements exactly and used 2 T spoons and some water and boiled it for a few minutes (in ground beef, just like I would packaged).  And, last night I was in a rush and didn't have any made up, so I just used each ingredient *to taste* (trying to follow the proportions, but just eyeballing it.  Worked great!

I don't review recipes very often because they really have to impress me. For years I've tried taco seasoning recipes, making my own, using a store bought packet and just throwing seasonings in to fit my taste. I prefer the restaurants that use a taco meat without a heavy "taco" flavor and do NOT like the ones with ketchup or taco sauce added to them. I'm very much a purist so less to me is better. So I tried this one expecting it to taste like a taco seasoning packet. I made the whole recipe and cooked 2 lbs. of hamburger meat and added the seasoning to taste along with some water to help mix. I kept tasting it as it was cooking and kept adding the seasoning and almost used the whole recipe. Husband and daughter (11 yrs.) loved it as a meat burrito, I had a crunchy taco and almost 14 yr. old son doesn't really like tacos so he added ketchup and made a sloppy joe and he loved it. I liked it too. It didn't have an overwhelming taco flavor. All the spices worked really well together and seemed to have a perfect balance so not any one spice was overpowering. Thanks for the recipe! I should use this from now on.

This was good.  Not as salty as the store taco seasoning packets, but it was good.  definitely smelled exactly the same, maybe a bit spicier.

This is a very good recipe!  I give it only 4 stars because it has too much cumin for my taste, but that is easily changed--I only use 2 tsp instead of 3.  Since I don't care for red pepper flakes and didn't have any cayenne on hand, I used Cajun Seasoning.  Next time I'm at the store I think I'll pick up some cayenne to see how that works.  I have made 4+ batches of this seasoning since finding the recipe and all out of ingredients I already had on hand, how amazing!  My husband has told me that he never wants the packet again, and with such an easy and delicious recipe, he'll never need to as long as I'm cooking!

Fantastic flavor! I found this recipe when I needed taco seasoning and found I had none in the cabinet. I will NEVER go back to the store bought packages again! This was just as good, if not better! Best of all, you can easily control the sodium content using this recipe as the packets from the store are LOADED with it. I made a triple batch of this to keep in my spice cabinet. Thanks for submitting this one!

Very good.  Easy to put together.  I didn't have sea salt, so just used regular and that was fine.  Recipe provides perfect amount for 1 lb of meat, if you are not planning on mixing a big batch of the ingredients.

WHOO DOGGIE!  Careful of the strength of the chili powder.  I used med-hot from the Mexican food section.  MUST CUT DOWN NEXT TIME!  Otherwise great - used 1lb ground beef, 2 TBSP seasoning, 1/2-3/4 cup water and simmered 20min.  Update: OK so chili powder is a mixture of seasonings including red chili.  The mexican red chili powder I used is NOT a mix thus the heat factor.  We actually like the heat of using 1/2 of each for this.  Used up my last packet of taco seasoning left in the pantry and my husband commented on the lack of taste it had.  Won't go back to the packet!

This was good.  I enjoyed the flavor, although my chili powder is hot and fresh from NM so I probably need to cut it in half next time.  I put a Tablespoon in 1lb of ground beef and it was spot on for flavor.  Thanks this will save me some money at the market.  No need to buy seasoning now.  Thanks!

I just got done making this for my husband and I.  It is fantastic!  He said there is no need for any other seasoning, ever.  I halved the chili powder and cumin, as we like things just a little spicy, and left out the salt and black pepper entirely.  This is a great salt-free mix and we will definitely use it again.  Thank you!

It is way too spicy for little kids. I also thought it was too salty. We took the advice to add cornstarch and water. Thought the consistency was great. Flavor wasn't too bad just overwhelmed by the peppers and salt. I didn't think it was better than the Ortega package mix. I will keep looking for another recipe for the next time I run out of regular mix.

This couldn't have been more perfect.  It is exactly like the packages.  Unbelievable.  I thought the spiciness was perfect, as did my husband, but my kids thought it was too spicy.  So if you have children, I would half the red pepper flakes.  Excellent though.  I will never buy the sodium packed pouches again.

I followed this recipe last night when making chicken tortilla soup for my wife rather than using taco seasoning from a package.  While eating dinner she commented that this was some of the best I'd made and it tasted "fresher/cleaner" to her.  

I took that as a compliment and plan on using this recipe from now on when making up taco seasoning.  DELICIOUS!!!

Really yummy!  I think it's better than the store bought stuff.  I didn't add the red pepper flakes because I had 2 little boys eating it, but did add a small shake of cayenne pepper.  Thanks so much!  One batch was perfect for 1 pound of hamburger.

I was making Tacos tonight when I realized I didn't have a store bought seasoning packet.  Allrecipes came to the rescue!  This mixture was absolutely perfect!  I wouldn't have known the difference had I not mixed it up myself!  It was a little salty for 1 pound of ground beef, but I didn't mind too much.  My kids loved it too!  I took a previous reviewers advise and added water (2/3 cup) to the meat and seasoning mix and let it cook down until the water had almost evaporated.  Worked like a charm! Thanks for sharing your recipe!  I will use this from now on instead of paying over a dollar a packet for the store bought seasoning!

I don't know that I would say this is _exactly_ like packet mixes, but it's very close and very good! It's a little hotter, but I like that. I love knowing exactly what's in it, and I love saving money by using the spices I already have instead of buying the packets!

The change that I do is that I toast the seasoning mixture in a dry pan on the stove until fragrant. It makes it very tasty!

My boyfriend and I love this seasoning.  I am often skeptical of buying the package seasoning mixes because I find they are mostly just super salty and you never really know what you are getting in there.  This is the perfect mix of spices for tacos and I have used it several times!  Thanks!

The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars is because I (being the inexperienced cook) was at a loss at how much ground beef and water to add.  Finally  after stressing some I added the whole thing to 1 1/2lb ground beef after mixing in 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch to add some body.  I then added about a cup (or under?) of water and man...it was good.  Very flavorful and another hit for my picky husband.  Thank YOU!!

So I'm making steak tacos this evening for dinner, and as my steak is browning, I go to the pantry to find--no taco seasoning!  As usual, allrecipes to the rescue.  I just glanced at this recipe to see what was in it, and started dumping ingredients into a bowl, eyeballing the measurements.  Even with my poor instruction-following skills this was the best taco seasoning I have ever had!  I'll never buy taco season again!

Awesome! I doubt I'll ever buy prepacked taco seasoning again. Tried this the other night and my husband loved it so much he ate several crunchy tacos, and he usually only prefers the tortilla wraps. I substituted table salt for sea salt and it still came out great. And it *does* taste just like a certain brand of the packets.

Ok, so yes this became the official taco seasoning recipe in my house. NO MORE TACO SEASONING PACKS AFTER THIS RECIPE FOR ME!!! 

I use the entire mix for 1pound of ground beef simply because I enjoy a lot of flavor. I personally add double the cayenne pepper because I love spicy. I then add 2/3 cup of water, bring to a boil, then turn down to low-medium heat to simmer for 10 minutes. Yumm I promise!

This is a great alternative to the packets of taco mix you buy at the store. It is my go-to recipe! I'm especially fond of it because you can control how spicy or salty you want to make it. My husband loves spicy food so I add a little extra pepper flakes and I use Penzey's "Black & Red" seasoning, which is black pepper and cayenne pepper mixed together, in place of the black pepper. I don't add any salt to this recipe and I honestly don't miss it! I usually triple this recipe to season 3lbs of ground turkey at a time and typically let the meat simmer in the seasoning with 1 1/2 to 2 cups water to allow the meat to absorb the seasonings. Delicious!

Yum! Like other reviewers, I used 3T per lb, 1/2T flour, 2/3 c water. I make a large amount to keep in the cupboard and add the flour just before combining with the hamburger. No more packaged seasoning mix for this family.

Love love love!  I'm doing my best to avoid processed foods and foods with additional preservatives so I thought I've give this a whirl.  I've made this a few times and my only recommendation would be to make MORE so you can have some on hand to throw into other recipes in the future!  I've used it in tacos of course, but I've also mixed it in sour cream for a quick dip for quesadillas, put a pinch in ranch for a Mexican dressing to go with a salad... the possibilities are endless now that I'm not tied to the old seasoning packet.  Thank you Bill!!

Yumm! I didn't have any oregano (weird, huh!) or onion powder. I only had onion salt so I used that in the amount stated for onion powder and decreased the salt amount by 3 teaspoons (I had quadroopled the recipe). I then added diced onions to the ground beef. Solved the onion powder problem! I cooked up 4 pounds of ground beef and added a tablespoon of white whole wheat flour then the taco seasoning with about 3/4 cup or so of water. I did decrease the crushed pepper to suit kid tastes but it was delicious!  I popped the leftover seasoned beef into the freezer until the next taco night! 2 meals -one time cooking!

This is perfect taco seasoning. I flipped over the store brand and a well known brand of taco seasoning packets and the ingredients are not great. There's a lot of salt and MSG in them. I decided I could find a better recipe online and this one was perfect! I already had everything at home. It was just a matter of knowing how much of each spice to use. I used it on ground turkey which has little flavor to begin with. After adding the seasoning you wouldn't know it's not beef. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this today rather than using the store-bought stuff.  Not as good as other seasonings I tried, but still better than the store bought stuff.  If I made it again, I'd probably go lighter on the salt and the chili powder, both overpowered everything else.

Great base and easy to modify. I like this recipe better than the taco seasoning packets that you can buy in the store. I usually add some cayenne or chipotle chile powder, too.

This is another great recipe for the books! Taco night was everyone's favorite when I make this. It makes you want to never eat another Taco Bell anything ever again. I've actually never had a taco this good from anywhere. I always add a little more everything especially crushed red pepper for the spice. I took the advice from someone else and added flour to the mix before shaking mixing the spice mixture together. I always dust the meat lightly with the spice mix while browning and then after it's done while it's simmering with the water. While doing that I prepare my cheese sauce mix which is velveta and ro-tel hot diced tomatoes (make sure they're hot or else it won't be the same) and warm them up together. This is the icing on the cake for the tacos. I then prepare whatever else I want for the tacos and put them in separate dishes with spoons so everyone can fix what they want. It's amazing.

This seasoning is the best and I use it now all the time vs. store-bought stuff. I highly recommend that you give it a try. You can experiment with different kinds and amounts of pepper flakes or other ingredients to adjust the hotness to what your family likes. I make a big batch of this and keep it in a bottle in my spice rack for regular use. Thanks for a great recipe!

I ran out of my warehouse size taco seasoning and made up a batch of this to make 7 layer dip on short notice. Fabulous! Even my perfectionist husband was very impressed! I cut the red pepper flakes as I didn't have any and it was awesome!I made up a larger batch toot sweet! Thank you Bill!

I did halve the salt to add 1 beef bouillon as another reviewer suggested and it is muy perfecto!!! We will never buy the packet again!!!
Update: I boiled the meat to get that resturant texture. I did not drain the water; I added the whole bowl (3T) of seasoning to the beef in the water and let it reduce. I then added 1/4 tsp of cornstarch to cold water in a bowl and added it to the meat... BEST EVER!!!

We no longer buy packaged taco seasoning - this is excellent and made with ingredients I always have on hand. I use 1 batch of this recipe as written (subbing 1/8 tsp. of cayenne for the 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes) and stir in 1 TBSP of flour (I use whole wheat, works great). Add that mixture to 1 lb. browned/drained ground beef with 3/4 cup water and simmer for 10 minutes. Perfect!

Fantastic recipe for tacos!  It is spicy and has a great rich flavor.  I doubled the onion powder and garlic powder and next time I would cut the salt down just a bit.  It was a huge hit at dinner tonight and I plan on making a big batch so we no longer have to buy pre-packaged taco seasoning.  I found that 2 Tbsp with a little less than 2/3 cup of water worked perfectly for 1lb of meat.

This is the only taco seasoning I use. It's easy to make and keeps well. I always triple the recipe (we eat a lot of tacos ;) and keep it in the pantry. So much better than a seasoning packet.

This is excellent and has a pretty good kick to it.  One batch makes about 3 tablespoons which I used for one pound of meat.  Will absolutely make again!

I skipped the cumin and red pepper flakes and it's perfect!  I love that I can adjust the ingredients to achieve the appropriate amount of spice for my family.  -And being able to control the salt for my husband with high blood pressure makes this a definite 5 star rating.  Thank you!!!!

I substituted 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes and used 1/2 tbsp and 2/3 cup of water for one pound of beef.  Like some of the other posts, we love this recipe.  My son is very picky and the first time he tasted the tacos with this recipe he said, "These are the best ever!"  He won't eat Taco Bell or anything else unless he's not with me and even then he'd rather have something else.

This is better than any of those packets of Taco Seasoning at the store. I pulled out the seasoning packet that came with the taco shells and secretly used this recipe in its place. Everyone wanted to know what I did different. 
I used the entire recipe with 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef.  After browning the meat, I added the spice mix and browned it slightly. Then added 3/4 Cup Water and 1-2 Tablespoons of flour. Turned out perfect. I'm not sure if this saves you any money but who cares! This is a keeper.

Added garlic salt, hot sauce and a few tablespoons of salsa. No need to add corn starch or flour, just let it simmer down. Very good. Definitely going to replace the store bought envelope mixes for this girl.

This is an awesome formula as given!  Very easy and the ingredients are already in your cabinet!  I used 1 pound of ground beef, 1/2 cup of water and added the entire mix. Very good!

Oh, Wow!  No more packets for me.  EVER! This mix is so good, good-bye over-salty zingy bright orange taco packets!  I make big batches of this and now always have some ready to go. Plus, if you like a little extra spice, just kick it up! THANKS, BILL!!!

I followed the directions and was surprised with how bland this turned out. I will probably try other recipes and come back to modify this one later.

Very flavorful! Definitely replaces packet seasoning, and I like that I know what's in it, no chemicals, preservatives or mystery ingredients! And you can adjust the salt to your liking!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! I no longer buy anymore seasoning from the store, as this is the best taco seasoning I have ever had. The best part is..you can make the meat as spicy or as mild as you want..just add more or less seasoning. I always add some water to the meat after I put the seasoning in along with some flour...gives it a great texture. I keep this in an air tight container and it never gets old!

Made exactly as directed.  Per other reviewers used 3 Tbsp for 1.25 pounds meat + 2/3 cup water.  Really great! Family (hubby & daughter) didn't think it was too spicy...just right amount. It also didn't make the meat turn all "gluey" or change colors like dyed like some of the store-bought packets.  This is my taco seasoning going forward!  Thanks!!

Great tasting recipe! I have yet to use it on plain meat, like ground beef -- I've only used it in recipes so far. However, the flavor is more robust than packet seasoning and I love that I can tweak it to my liking, and don't have to worry about running out so often. If you double this recipe, the weight comes out to 1.25oz, which I believe is the weight of a seasoning packet... but I used ALL of the doubled batch in my most recent recipe and the flavor is VERY strong. A little too strong for my liking, and taco seasoning is probably one of my favorite flavors ever. I'd recommend making a double batch but not using it all immediately, and adding more to taste. I'd recommend cutting down the salt or removing it altogether if you're not a big salt fan -- there's a fair amount of sodium in this already.

Made it exactly as the recipe called for (except I left out the redpepper b/c I have small kids) and it was awesome. I put the seasoning on one pound of ground turkey with some water and they were the best tacos I've ever made.

Very good and great way to reduce sodium from a packaged food! I added a little flour as well, but likely not necessary.

i took a look at the comments first, and decided that the recipe (yielding ~ 2.5 TB) was perfect for 1lb of ground beef. it was INCREDIBLY spicy. My BF and I love our food spicy, and we used the meat for chile rellenos...he was literally sweating as we ate. So if you're going to use this, keep in mind the hotness and I suggest starting with less, then adding more if you so desire. The 2-3 TB per LB suggestions may not work for everyone.

Great!!!  Did not use the ground Cumin and reduced the amount of salt and pepper to 1/4 tsp plus used 1/2 tsp of both minced garlic and minced onion...  My family with picky kids loved it....

Tried this the other night for the first time. Was not very happy about using it because of picky eaters. Everyone loved it and it is not as salty and the packed mixes. Very impressed. Will use again instead of mixes.

This is a fantastic way to monitior and control the amount of sodium in your food...make the spice mix yourself! I altered it a tad by adding 1/8 tsp. cayenne, 1/4 tsp. chipotle powder, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and a splash if Sriracha sauce when you are cooking the meat and spices together. Delish!

Perfect blend of spices. Had family over for two nights and wanted to make something quick.  This one was a winner and even passed the toughest critic, my hubby who's a firefighter. We all know what good cooks they are, majority anyway.  I kept getting compliments.  My hubby told me he's gonna use this one at the firehouse! I'm hanging on to this one for sure! Thanks so much!

It really was just like the mccormick taco seasoning packet.  I subbed chipotle powder for the redpepper flakes, and omitted the onion powder (dont have any.) I added sauteed onion to compensate.  Used 2 tbsp for 1lb of ground beef, with 1tbsp of flour and about 3/4 to 1 cup of water.  I cooked it all together for about five minutes then it sat for about 3 minutes in the pan off the heat.  the liquid evaporated and thickened perfectly.

Tastes great.  I didn't think it would make a difference but you can definitely taste that this is not from a packet.  I use it all of the time, easy way to get away from all of that pre made stuff.  I always keep three recipes worth.  I don't put any pepper in there though since my kids are sensitive to heat.

This was really good!  I did add a tiny bit of cayenne pepper, and also some lemon juice, which I highly recommend!  Something about the lemon juice brings out all the flavors really well.  It enhances the whole experience!  I love the combination.
I was excited to find a way to make my own taco seasoning; the stuff out of the packet never tasted that good to me. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! I used Hot Chili powder and omitted the red pepper flakes. It was plenty hot. I needed a triple recipe for almost three pounds of ground beef for tacos....so I would say this recipe is for one pound of burger.

I googled 'taco seasoning' cause I'd ran out, and used this on leftovers from a whole chicken my husband had cooked, which was VERY bland. I added the taco seasonings to the meat and sauteed it in a little bit of vegetable oil... and BAM! 
Don't know if I'll ever buy taco seasoning again!

The Best! My son doesn't like the envelope taco seasoning but loves this one. 
I make it in big batches then it is all set when I want to use it (about once a week at least).
I would recommend it to anyone.

Made as stated with the exception of 1/2 of the salt and pepper. I cooked 3 lbs ground beef and this was just enough to give it some flavor. Not sure if doubling the recipe would have been just right or too much. Would have doubled but only had enough chili powder to make this as stated.

I left out the red pepper flakes since I'm wimpy about the spices and cut the salt in half.  It is great and without all the chemicals in the packets.  Very easy to make.  I highly recommend trying it!

Made this when I started browning ground turkey for tacos...and then realized I didn't have any Taco packets. I used "Hot Mexican Chili Powder" instead of regular. I used cayenne pepper instead of the red flakes. Making this was actually better for us, because we have to begin a low-sodium diet. I also left out the sea salt. Nobody knew the difference!

I made this seasoning mix with no changes to the recipe, and used it on 1lb of ground moose meat. It was great! I definitely will use this instead of the seasoning packets from now on. I didn't find it spicy at all.

Had everything but sea salt and just used Kosher salt and it is awesome! Great flavor and no more packets for me either!  I used 1 pound gr. beef, 3 tbs. of this seasoning 2/3 c. water...heated up. Added 1 can of diced tomatoes, heated until warm and served over Fritos with sr. cream, shredded cheddar cheese, and lettuce.  Happy I found this recipe!

Excellent spice mix.  I added 2 t. cornstarch and 2/3 cup of water and a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste which added depth of flavor and a richness to the meat.  Yum.

I live salt free, so I use this all the time because I can leave out the salt.  Store it near the stove in a small bottle and you'll find you reach for it more and more.  Thanks, Bill!

We are never going back to store bought taco seasoning!  This is so good and it's really nice to know exactly what is in it!  I made it exactly as written.  I love the red pepper in it; but, it might e a little spicy for kids.  I'll probably leave it out or half it next time since my son does not like spicy food.  This is a keeper!

Was not bad with beef but went over very well when I made chicken tacos. We enjoy spice at my house but some may want to tweek the amount of spice to desired liking. Never buy store bought any more considering I carry these spices on a regular basis. I do suggest add desired water to get a good mix of the seasoning and add it to your meat 1 tbs at a time till you get your desired taste.

I was making taco salad and discovered that I had no taco seasoning.   Allrecipes saved the day!      This was excellent, and I agree with others who have said they'll never use store bought taco seasoning again!

Cost pennies to make and tastes really good.  I had all these items in my pantry.  No reason to buy a packet any longer.  I will be definitely be making in bulk and keeping to use for recipes that need taco seasoning

Awesome!  We used it as a topping for nachos and threw in the salsa and sour cream.  It is a bit spicy for the little ones, though...just add more sour cream if that's the case!

Perfect balance of flavors! Will never buy packaged taco seasoning ever again! Easy to adjust the heat, easy to double or quadruple. Mix ahead and store in a sandwich baggie.

I was born in Texas and have lived here for 35 years and I know my Tex-Mex cooking.  This is the BEST taco seasoning I have EVER tasted!!!  I make tacos at least twice a month (we love tacos) for my husband & boys (preschool aged) so I have had plenty of opportunities to try lots of different seasonings.  This is by far the BEST.  The flavors are all perfectly balanced!  Since I was feeding this to small children, I left out the red pepper flakes, but there was still plenty of "warmth" in the seasoning.  Not too bland for grownups.  I tripled the recipe for about 2.5 lbs of meat and even more  veggies (1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped bell pepper and two 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes, undrained).  The liquid from the canned tomatoes really helped bind everything together.  I also added an extra teaspoon of cumin b/c we just like it that way.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Really nice flavor! Added 1tsp on cornstarch. A single recipe is enough to flavor 1lb of ground beef and 1 can of refried beans.

Excellent taco seasoning!  I started searching for a taco seasoning recipe when I realized the packets contain MSG.  I will never buy another packet again, this is the best!  The only thing I omit is the red pepper flakes since we have small children.  I make a double batch of this and keep in in an airtight container so I always have it on hand.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

I quadrupled the recipe to have enough left over to save for another time...took the advice of others who said it was possibly 'too salty' and reduced the sea salt by 1 teaspoon  and did not put black pepper in it (in case it was too hot from the red pepper flakes), adding a couple of dashes at the end...IT WAS PERFECT!  I am definitely shouting that out so all can hear (see)...Fabulous recipe and done in less than a minute if you have all your spices organized in the cabinet :) The meal has been eaten and now the balance has been stored in a jar in the cabinet.  Thanks for something as simple and delicious as this...did not add flour to the meat as someone suggested...no extra gluten was needed.

Have always used taco seasoning packets from the store, I never even thought about making my own. While getting preparations together for tacos, for which I thought I had the packets for, I realized I had no taco packets. So I immediately came to this site and looked for a recipe. It was a life saver, since I had already done all the prep for the tacos. It tasted great!! It was also very easy to make. I will make a large batch in the future, so I can save time. I omitted the red pepper flakes since we don't like really hot dishes. This has great flavor, and without the red pepper flakes, it has a nice spice, but not the heat! Kudos to Bill for the recipe!!

Great recipe! I generally use over a pound of lean hamburger. Add 2/3 cup of water w/seasoning mixture when browning the beef. You will never buy package mix again!

No need to buy taco seasoning again!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I did cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, but that's just because I try not to have too much salt.  I used 1-Tablespoon for a pound of meat.

I really enjoyed this. My hubby really likes the taco seasoning in a packet, but enjoyed this ( he still preferred the packet kind) 
I prefer this recipe with the addition of a little cornstarch to make a thicker sauce when water is added the pan meat.

I just made this (minus the red peper flakes as it was for kids) for my daughter's grade 6 class as one of the children has severe allergies making packaged mixes a little tricky. 8 lbs of ground beef for 19 kids and only about 3 tbsp of meat left at the end; I'd say it was a success. I converted the recipe to 120 servings. I ended up using about 1/3 of the mix for the 8 lbs of meat. I advise adding a little at a time and tasting until you get the spice level you want. I've kept the remainder in a sealed jar and will use it the next time we have tacos at home. Thanks for a great recipe.

Thanks for sharing, Bill. I use this all the time. WAY better than the store-bought. I up the cumin, lower the paprika. So fast, cheap, and yummy - why buy the junk with unnecessary stuff in it? Winner, winner, Mexican dinner!

Hungry for tacos and out of seasoning my first thought was allrecipes.com.  I wasn't disappointed.  This is definitely better than any bought seasoning and tons cheaper.  I was out of cumin but it was still delicious.  I can't wait to make it again after I get the cumin.  Definitely will never buy taco seasoning again. EDIT Made this again tonight with the cumin.  WOW.  This is absolutely a five star recipe.  Thanks Bill.

Absolutely the best!  We had chicken left over and made chicken tacos with this seasoning.  Off the shelf seasoning is sodium packed and does not compare to Bill's!  Thanks so much for a great taco seasoning that doesn't cost more than 10 cents, if that!

This made some delicious tacos.... but... They were too salty!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I think I could have cut the sea salt by a good amount or left it out entirely.

After I browned the beef, I added some tomato sauce and water, then simmered until the liquid was absorbed and the beef was saucy and tender.

I make 60 servings as that is what my jar holds:
6 tbsps chili powder
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp onion powder
1 1/2 tsps oregano
1 tbsp paprika
3 tbsps cumin
1/2 tsp each red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and black pepper
I add salt or more pepper if needed depending on what I am making as I use this as my general Mexican style seasoning

This is a perfect blend of spices! I skipped on the pepper flakes. I browned up ground beef, drained and then added this seasoning to it. And then I made nachos supreme. No more store bought for me! Thanks for sharing.

i loved this because it is so versatile.  Per our taste I increase the garlic powder, decreased the cumin and increased the red pepper and it was delicious and had a very strong flavor!

This is a great gluten free option. It is a little spicy for my taste, so I just use less seasoning.

I followed someones suggestion and added a beef bouillon cube and more garlic and onion powder and it came out great.  The amount it makes is too much for one lb of beef but not enough for two so next time I will try to adjust for that

I have not bought a packaged taco mix since coming across this recipe. My step dad, who cannot have salt can have tacos again! (We just omit the salt) I will make 8-10 batches at a time of this and just keep it in the cupboard. Thank you so much!!!

My partner (a taco afficionado) thought it tasted pretty good, but that it needed a bit more salt and could use more spice, which you could adjust to taste when you make the seasoning.

Awesome flavor. I used 1 TBSP for 1 lb. of lean ground steak and you could taste the spices without feeling like your mouth was on fire. My husband and I will probably use more than 1 TBSP of this spice mix at a time as we like a little more heat than what we experienced the 1st time. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Awesome! I will never buy packaged again! I subbed 1/8 teaspon cayenne for the red pepper flakes. Used with 1 1/2 lbs ground beef (drained) and 1 c water. Oh, and I added 1/2 t. flour to the dry mix as a thickening agent

Since finding this recipe on AR, I have not (and will not) buy any sort of taco seasoning packet...the flavors of this seasoning mix are amazing!  I think the hotness is just right, but the kids claim its a bit spicy.  My suggestion, if you have young children or picky eaters, is to hold off on mixing in the hot spices until last.  Then add it little by little to taste at the end.

Excellent!! Could not tell a difference. I will not buy another packet of premade seasoning. I especially like this one because you could always add something to it to make it spicy or take most of the salt away to keep the sodium down. Trust me, this one is definitely a keeper!

Excellent combination of spices. This tastes better (fresher) and much less salty than the prepackaged seasons. I also like that you can adjust the amount of each spice to taste.

This is one of the better recipes I've tried although a little tweaking makes it perfect. I played around with a few small batches and kept getting the feeling it was missing something. Where it calls for 1 tbls of chili powder, use 1/2 tbls regular chili powder and 1/2 tbls hot Mexican chili powder. Where it calls for 1/2 tsp paprika, use 1/4 tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp "smoked" paprika (makes a big difference). One other important addition is a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of ground coriander. I also "heaped" the garlic and onion ingredients and omitted the red pepper flakes (I like to add them while cooking). The coriander and smoked paprika made a huge diference. I also used 1/2 of the oregano and crushed it to near powder. Hope this helps. Enjoy.

This Taco Seasoning was excellent.  I used it with some organic ground beef.  We used the beef in soft multi-grain tortillas.  I served the tacos with some Mexican rice & black beans.  My boyfriend raved that it was the most satisfying meal that he had in awhile.  (I guess this is good & bad!)  I will definitely be making this again.  A little tip for those in western Washington - if you go to PCC, you can get organic spices (they have a section where you can measure out how much you want to use).  This was such an awesome option as opposed to buying a bottle of spices that you rarely use!

Love this seasoning!  I don't like to buy packets so I'm really happy to find a GREAT recipe to tweak on my own.  I made it with ground turkey and did a burrito with a black bean salsa recipe from this site.  Delicious!

Wow, this is a terrific seasoning mix -- a million times better than those wonky grocery store packages of taco seasoning.  I subbed cayenne for the crushed red pepper and omitted the black pepper.  I made extra so I can easily add flavoring to various dishes.  This recipe rocks!

Very good, tasted almost the same as the pre-mixed packets you buy which are pretty pricey at my store.  Will use this recipe from now on.

Good solid base and next time I'll make sure to have fresh oregano and not use the garlic powder (use minced fresh in the meat instead).  Used on chicken and the combo was a bit off for chicken, but think it would be better with beef.

Count me as one of those who thought she had taco seasoning on hand and didn't... This was excellent. In order to kick up the heat a tad, I used 1/2 tablespoon of regular chili powder and 1/2 tablespoon chipotle chili powder. I will not likely buy packaged taco seasoning again. Thank you!

After reading the reviews I was excited to try this, only to be let down. I made it exactly as the recipe said. My husband and I found it to be bland. We didn't think it was hot at all. I'm not sure what type of taco seasoning everyone's buying at the store, but the one we bay is way better! It wasn't bad, just nothing special.

I love this mix!  Used for my beef nachos and it was awesome!  This is enough for one pound of meat and I only added 3/4 cup water to the meat after browining and draining and simmered for about 20 minutes.  I also used this mix for a taco dip and my husband and his friends went crazy over the dip.

Great recipe!! I changed it a bit by adding dried onion and a thickening agent. I think the dried or minced onion just adds another layer of flavor you can't get with just onion powder. I've used it many times and make a big batch so I always have it on hand.

This is the real deal. If you keep this recipe handy you'll never have to buy taco seasoning again. In fact, it makes me wonder why I even bothered with those little packets in the first place.

I have made this twice (thinking the first time I did something wrong).  I was expecting my taco meat to taste like it does when using the season packet that comes with taco kits, but was dissapointed.  This blend of spices just didn't give my taco meat the zing I was expecting.

This is a very good recipe. I found it a little spicy (I use fresh spices from a co-op so that may be why). I tried using less but there wasn't enough flavor so I just used 1/2 the amount of chili powder and 1/2 the amount of red pepper flakes and it worked great. Still spicier (and more flavorful) than store bought but not too spicy for the little ones.

Excellent seasoning!  I used this in a chicken dip and it was great.  I prefer using something like this rather than a sodium packed, store bought taco seasoning.  I gave it 4 stars because I think the cumin is way to high.  A little cumin goes a LONG way!  I used about 1/2 tsp only and the taste is still present but not overwhelming.  Thanks!

This was amazing, simple, and much healthier! Thanks a bunch for sharing!  Note- I only had minced onion and Cheyenne pepper so i used those, only difference was i blended all ingredients in my bullet to make it a finer powder. VERY PLEASED!

I mixed some up last night.  I'm always looking for a way to cut cost.  This Taco Seasoning mix will help with this. I used about a heaping tablespoon of flour and about two tablespoons of the mix and added about 1/2 cup of water.  Of course you can change the amounts to suit your taste.  I also didn't have any crushed red pepper flakes, so I use about an 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, some of my family members don't care for really spicy food, so I have to keep things milder for them.  I know I will keep this mixed up in our spice cabinet and not buy packets again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

When Pace discontinued its wonderful taco seasoning mix, I was anxious to find a spicy-enough substitute. Other brands were too bland for our taste. This was exactly what I was looking for! I saute onion and garlic before adding the meat, and it's terrific. Thanks, Bill!

Made this seasoning last night to use for chicken tacos.  Excellent flavor.  It will be my go-to seasoning from now on.  I did not have onion powder so I used an equal amount of dried minced onion.  Didn't have sea salt either so I used 1-1/4 tsp. of regular table salt.  For 2 large cut up chicken breasts, I used 2-1/2 tbsp. of the seasoning and 1/2 cup water. I will use a little less than that next time with 1/4 cup of water.  Worth doubling or tripling to keep in a jar in the cabinet.

Oh my goodness...this was amazing!!  I used the whole recipe on 3 large, diced chicken breasts for tacos and it was so good!!  I made a few changes from lack of ingredients, but not many.  I did not have sea salt, so I subbed table salt only cut the amount in half.  I also omitted the pepper because I just didn't feel like putting it in for some reason and I didn't miss it at all.  I also was out of red pepper flakes, so I subbed 1/8 tsp cayenne and the spice was perfect.  Buying taco seasoning seems really pointless when there is an amazing recipe for it you can throw together in a few minutes that doesn't contain chemicals or an overwhelming amount of salt.  Thanks so much for the post.  Will use for the rest of my life :)

I no longer buy my taco seasoning mix at the store after coming across this recipe a year or so ago.  I LOVE this mix!  It's quick and easy, and very flavorful.  I do cut down a bit on the cumin and add a little water to stir it in with my meat.

Made exactly as written. Makes about 3-3.5TB. I used 2.5 level TB in my 5-bean taco soup. Very delicious. Great flavors. I'll definitely keep this recipe handy.... and may just stick with it instead of buying pre-packaged taco seasoning. Thanks, Bill, for sharing!

I didn't have any Taco seasoning and I needed it for a recipe.  I usually use "Lowery's".  This stuff was just as good if not better.  PS  Don't you just love the folks who decide to tweak recipes.....and then report they don't like them....It should be against the rules

My 10 year old made this and then made his own taco shells.  Absolutely THE BEST tacos we have ever had.  Taco night no longer feels like a "junky" dinner.  We used shredded red cabbage instead of lettuce and I used the mixture on fish tacos.  To die for.

Excellent. I needed some taco seasoning & then realized I didn't have a packet. No more packets for us now, thank you very much! Even my 5-year-old daughter said it smelled "really, really good".

I made this seasoning when I ran out of the pre-mixed stuff.  This was better than expected.  My family loved it.  It was less salty than what we had used before.  I now keep a mix of it ready for taco night.

Awesome! Tastes just like Taco Bell's on-the-shelf envelope but no preservatives. Also used stuff I already had in my cupboard. I will never buy the packets again! I use this not only on tacos but use it to marinate chicken (then grill with veggies for fajitas) and rubbed on a pork roast in the slow cooker (then shredded and made into carnitas). An excellent seasoning to keep on hand in your cupboard.

Used this tonight to season Hamburger to make stuffed peppers.  It was very good.  I was out of Oregano, so I just left it out, but will try it with the next batch.

Excellent recipe! I just make a large batch of this and then keep it on hand to make tacos anytime. Also, I stir in just a bit of potato starch (I'm allergic to cornstarch) to the batch. When cooking, I add a bit of water to the seasoned meat and combines with the starch to create an excellent saucy taco meat just like the packaged stuff! I love it!

This is now the only taco seasoning I use now! I love that I can easily change the hotness. My husband and I like it spicy, but the kids only like it medium-hot. When my in-laws are there, I have to remember to make it mild, but no matter how spicy this seasoning is or isn't, it's great!

This is  a fantastic base recipe for taco seasoning! I would add less salt and then salt to taste (and I love salt!) but everything else was great. You can adjust all seasonings to fit your taste but for the first run I followed exactly. It is spicy and delicious! Oh yeah, I mixed the crushed red pepper with cayenne for an extra kick and it rocked!

Fantastic!  I made as is, and also made without the salt (trying to reduce sodium intake in my household).  Both tasted wonderful - we didn't miss the salt at all!  I will NEVER be buying taco seasoning packets again (have you ever looked at the amount of sodium in those darn things?!).

Fantastic!  Adjusted to suit the family (less heat for the kids & more cumin for me & the hubby).  Quadrupled the batch to store for future meals.  Will never buy pre-packaged seasoning again!  Thanks for the recipe :-)

Very good!  I didn't have the sea salt so I used regular salt and it was a little salty but still very good flavor.  Will be using this from now on.  Note to Bill E.:  You may want to include how much water to add in the recipe.

I love this recipe because I can use the spices I always have around.  The only change I made was not using red pepper flakes because I don't like them and adding 1 tsp poultry seasoning instead of dried oregano and onion powder because that's what I had.

We have always used the Taco Bell packets and they are wonderful but when I was in the middle of making dinner I realized we were out.  I ran to All Recipes.com and found this and figured it should be good enough.  I actually love this recipe so much that I seriously doubt I will ever purchase a taco seasoning packet again.  It was really great and I can control the amount of salt.  Those packets are loaded with it.

For everyone with Celiac that can't eat "modified food starch" this is a wonderful alternative! In fact it is so tasty and cheap that it beats packaged taco seasoning any day. I only made one change after making it a few times - I doubled the amount of cumin. I also make this in large quantities and just store it in a zip-lock bag so that I don't have to mix it up every time I need it.

This was delicious and definitely a recipe I will begin using often.  I used it in the Burrito Pie recipe on here a few weeks ago and it was excellent.  Tonight I used it for tacos and it was once again excellent.  I cooked up the ground beef and drained it, then added it back to the pot with 2T. spice + 2/3c. water (roughly) per pound of meat and simmered for about 20 minutes before serving.

Very good seasoning. I will always keep this on hand. I don't see any reason to change a thing.

So much better than store bought. I loved it so did my family. I added three tbs spoons to each pound of beef. And added water in stages just so I could get the right moisture. I made 5 pounds of tacos with this recipe. I also used this recipe with chicken burritos. It was so yummy also. I just took pound of left over boneless chicken breast and cooked it in 2 cans of chicken broth and about 2 cans of water tsp spoon of a garlic powder and 1/4 tsp ground pepper. Once the chicken started boiling I turned it low and let it simmer for about 1/2 an hour more or less. Once it was done and tender I shredded it with two forks. Tossed the chicken in a skillet with a little water and 3 tbs of the seasoning and cooked as I did the beef it was so good and moist.  I plan to make a huge batch of this and freeze it. It will be used up in now time.  Thanks for sharing. Vera

EAsy and you can decrease the amount of salt so it is not as salty as the commercial taco mix.

This seasoning is great!  It allows me to make my tacos taste delicious while controlling what goes into it.  It's great for those of us who are sensitive to some of the preservatives that go into standard taco mixes.

just perfect!  i did add a teaspoon of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce.  I used slightly less salt to control the sodium.   3 tablespoons of the mixture plus 2/3 cup of water is just right for a pound of ground beef.  I'll never use packet seasoning again!

Awesome seasoning.  We'll surely make it again!  I LOVE that you can get a taco seasoning without all the additives and other garbage that they put into packaged foods.  My ONLY adjustment to this recipe the next time will be to cut down on the cumin.  Thank you for the recipe!

*UPDATE*  We're putting this on popcorn tonight!  As I'm an avid 'all-natural' mom, my son gets excited when he gets to have favoured snacks.  No dill-pickle chips in this household!  But taco-popcorn?  Bring it on!

It was great, I'm another that will never go back to packets for taco season. 3 Tbs. is = to 1 pack store brand. I doubled it for 2 lbs ground beef, browned added 3/4c. water and season mix. Our taco salads were great. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome!!!!  I am ready to make this for gifts. Only put half the salt since hubby can't have it.  Also added dehydrated onions in additon to the onion powder since we had it and looks good in it.  Not a good idea if you are planning to put this in a shaker jar though.   
Just used it for a sweet potato fries recipe where you mix taco seasoning with oil and bake.  Yum!

Just like the premixed packets from Old El Paso, and it's all stuff in my spice cabinet anyway.  Thanks for saving me the trouble of remembering to keep the .79 cent packets on hand.

I love this recipe as-is with 1 pound of ground beef, but when I make it for my kids, I like to tame it down a bit by using only a teaspoon of chili powder and omitting the red pepper flakes- still delicious! ***EXTRA INFO*** Made this yesterday: Put 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts in slow cooker, along with seasoning recipe as I have modified it and 1 cup chicken broth. Cooked on low all day and shredded it up when I got home from work. Fried up some corn tortillas into taco shells, filled with chicken mixture, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. YUM!

I can't tell you the last time I bought a taco seasoning packet! This is excellent. I make a big batch and store it in a pint jar, using 2 tbsp. per pound of meat. I use it for tacos, fajitas, and homemade refried beans. My family loves it; my step-daughter requested a Mexican feast for her birthday dinner last night.

I haven't used my seasoning yet, but I've got it ready in it's jar!  It looks and smells like taco seasoning...can't wait!  :)  UDATE: I've since used the seasoning and found it adds a very rich flavor to food.  As other reviewers noted, 2 1/2 - 3 tablespoons = one 1.25 oz. store bought packet.  YUM!

This is fantastic!!  I love the basic recipe here as is - we tend to double the onion & garlic (I always added that to store bought mixes anyway) but it is perfect - I don't need to look any further!  This is our recipe.

Ran out of taco seasoning while cooking and found this to mix up and add to the dish.  Made some more for a couple of extra meals and put in a small tupperware in the spice drawer.  Never going back to the packs!!

i can't express enough how much i love this recipe.  it tastes great and i'm so happy that i don't have to feed those msg-filled packages of seasoning to my kids any more.  
leftover?  dump your taco toppings and the taco meat over a cookie sheet of tortilla chips and top it with gooey cheese.  melt it in the oven and make your mouth happy.

Same essential flavor as the store bought packets but better because you can manipulate the taste you desire (We like it extra spicy). Also there's just something gratifying about using seasoning you made yourself. I doubt i will buy taco seasoning ever again! Rave reviews from everyone who has tried it!

My husband declared these the best homemade tacos we've ever had! We reduced the cumin to 1 teaspoon, but otherwise prepared as written. We're vegetarians, and found that one full recipe (10 servings) perfectly seasoned a 12 oz bag of veggie crumbles. We also followed another commentator's suggestion and mixed in 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 2/3 cup water to achieve the right consistency. Thanks for a keeper!

This seasoning blend is amazing. I 
will never go back to packaged taco
seasoning again. I used to make my
own taco seasoning before kids, but
I misplaced the one I had. This is
even better than the one I remember.

I upped the cumin by a 1/2 tsp. (just a personal taste) and cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp. I didn't have onion powder, so
I used dried onion flake. This 
recipe is also great to double or 
triple to have a reserve. 

Thanks for sharing this recipe. I'm
incredibly grateful.

This was great!  I reduced the cumin by 1/3 and cut the black pepper in half.  I am not sure that those changes were necessary, but don't like too much cumin or pepper.  I browned the ground beef, then added the seasoning and 3/4c water and simmered it for 10 minutes.  My son ate three servings!

I am rating this a 4 because it had mixed reviews in my house.  Nobody hated it, but hubby and my son both said it was only "okay" and needed some more flavor.  Personally, I really liked that it had a bit more mild flavor (I think the packaged stuff is too salty and has too much onion powder).  So, I will make it again if I'm in a pinch - its not terrible - I just wish it had gone over better with the boys.

The first time I made this I liked it. I dunno why though. This time around I felt that something was missing. Where's the sugar?! I added about 3/4 of a teaspoon of sugar. Yummy!

This turned out great for Taco night!! And the best part of it, besides tasting like the packets we buy at the grocery store, is that there is no MSG in the recipe! YAY!

Very good seasoning... just a little on the salty side.  I just made enough to supply me for a long time, but I used about half the salt.  This is nice to have on hand for dinner in a pinch.

very good. Easy to make.  I double the batch and store it in a mason jar. Whenever we have tacos, I have my spice made ready to go.  I use about 2-3 tbsp after I brown my meat, along with a little water (about 1/4c or 1/3c) to help it all blend in.  I brought some leftover meat to our girl's night in and we made nachos.  My friends loved the seasoning, saying that it wasn't too salty nor spicy.  THANKS!

I originally tried this recipe for two reasons.  #1, the Old El Paso seasoning at the store grows dull very quick when a 5 and 6 year old demand tacos at least once a week.  #2, it's one of the only recipes I have seen on this site with so much posituve reviews.  Well over 500!  That's incredible.  

  I did alter it a bit, as most of you did.  First thing I did, being that the little guys were eating it, I completely cut out the red pepper and only used half the seasalt.  Just to a mild version for them.  I also added half a cup of fresh chopped onion to the meat while it was browning and it turned out great!  

  In the future, I will create two mason jars of this seasoning to use on Taco Night, one Mild and One Extra Extra Spicy for good ole' dad!  

  As a father who cooks for the family, I really needed to find something that would please everyone, knowing that I am no Iron Chef.  This recipe did the trick.  Thank you very much.

Great recipe; very fresh tasting!  I used about 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and I thought the seasoning was perfect. I will keep a supply of this in my pantry!

What I like best about this recipe is it's a great base for taco seasoning, and you can add or subtract what you want from it, or use more or less overall. Plus almost everything on the list you can find as large $1 bottles. 
Another good thing about this recipe over packaged seasoning is that it's zero carbs, where packets of seasoning have some sort of starch or sugar in it.

This was just the perfect mix of spices for my taco meat. I try to slow cook a lot to save time at the "witching hour" so I toss 1 lb of (browned) ground turkey, a 14 oz can diced tomatoes and 1 sliced onion in the crockpot, add this recipe of seasoning and you've got delish taco fillings waiting when you get home. Add a can of beans (black pinto or kidney) for an extra protein boost in the last 15 minutes!

Absolutely wonderful. This taste better then the store bought stuff. I cooked the meat, drained grease, add seasoning, add 1/4 cup of water or more if needed, and then stir and simmer for about 10-15 min. to really get the spices into the meat. Excellent!

Awesome!!! We LOVE homemade tacos. This mix is far better than packages. It is a little spicey. So if your tastebuds aren't up to it, you might cut down on some of the spices. I very much recommend this recipe!!!

Wow, this is sooo good! It tastes way better (and is healthier) than the packaged stuff and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard! I left out the salt but I didn't miss it. I will NEVER buy packaged Taco Seasoning mix again. Thank you so much.

This recipe is a lifesaver!  It tastes much better than the packages and costs next to nothing to make, and eliminates all the unhealthy preservatives and MSG so what more could you ask for?  I often triple the recipe and store it in an airtight container so I can just spoon out what I need in a hurry.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I make a big batch of this and put it in a jar on my spice rack. I don't even measure it out - just shake a little bit in and go by taste. We use it with veggie crumbles and the tacos are out of this world!

Perfect!!!! I hate all the chemicals in the taco seasoning blends you buy in the store. I like to be as natural as possible. I like that I can control the salt. This recipes lets you accomplish that. It is a great blend of seasonings. I used it in taco dip and like so many others, will not be buying packaged seasoning again. Only changes I made were to use 1/2 tsp of regular salt and I skipped the red pepper flakes. Thaks for the great recipe. Never thought it could be so easy!!!

This is great! Of course I was missing the seasoning mix when I decided to make tacos last night. I put in a search for taco seasoning, never thinking anything would come up, and I found this. It's very easy to tweak to your taste. I halved the chili powder, used 1/4 t pepper, left out the pepper flakes, and used cilantro in place of the oregano. I added a little more than 1/2 c of water, and 1 t cornstarch to the mixture to thicken. It tastes just like the packaged kind, even better! As the recipe stands it would be much hotter than the packaged seasoning I'm used to using, so if you like hot, don't change a thing! Thank you, thank you! I'll never have to buy seasoning mix again.

The flavor of this is great!  Like many others here, I didn't have a packet of taco seasoning when I needed it so checked here.  I'm so glad I did! I mixed all the seasonings together in a plastic bag, cutting the amount of chili powder and red pepper flakes in half, and using regular salt instead of sea salt.  I added the entire amount of seasoning to a pound of ground beef that had just been browned along with a 1/2 cup of water.  I mixed very well and allowed to cook on medium stiring occassionally for about 10 minutes. Next time though, I will completely omit the red pepper flakes.  Even using only 1/8 of a teaspoon has left my mouth on fire.

Great recipe.  I didn't add all of that salt, but other than that I followed the recipe.  Oh, I didn't have red pepper flakes either.  This is so much cheaper than buying those little packets.  And there are no mystery ingredients.

We liked this more than packaged taco seasoning. Followed the recipe exactly (except used table salt instead of sea salt) which is good for 1 pound of meat. Will probably make a large batch and store in an airtight container for a fast dinner! Will never buy it again!

This is a great recipe.  You will never by packaged again.  I think this is better when made a head time.  This enhances the spices.  This is especially good with the slow cooker taco soup recipe from this site.

Very easy to prepare and just as good as the store bought packets. I used 1/8 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes and it was not spicy at all.

Very good.  I decreased the chili powder to 1/2 Tbsp. and the red pepper flakes to an 1/8 tsp. and my boyfriend who loves spicy food agreed that it still had a good kick to it!  Good homemade recipe when your short on seasoning.

After realizing I have a sensitivity to MSG, we had to stop buying those little packages of seasoning. I was so excited to find this recipe- it tastes exactly like the packets! I'm so happy to be able to eat tacos at home again.

I ended up trying this recipe when I figured out I had forgotten to by the packaged seasoning. I was so impressed with this recipe that I no longer buy it in the store, I make it everytime now.

Works just as well as the package mixes I've been buying.  I've doubled and tripled this recipe to keep in a plastic container in my spice cabinet.  I've used it for chicken & beef tacos.

Why pay a high price for taco seasoning when you can make your own for pennies?  This is great and I'll never buy packaged again.

Excellent!  I realized too late that I did not have a packet of taco seasoning for the chicken tacos I was making for dinner tonight.  This was just as good and cheaper than the packets at the store.  Thanks!

This was better than I had ever expected.  I use it all the time.  Love the ability to be able to make some fine adjustments.  Adding a bit of corn starch thickens the taco meat a bit.  The name of Bill will be honoured in my kitchen for years to come.

I  I think that, with that ingredient  halved, it's just right. That's a huge reduction in spice, so I'll knock off a whole star. 
I have to say, my major complaint is with the reviewers, once again. Someone said there shouldn't have been cayenne or red pepper. Uh, there's not. Someone else said it was too salty with the onion and garlic salt. No...powder, NOT salt. More people complaining about how, even if they cut the black pepper in half, it's too spicy...That's because the red pepper flakes and the chili powder are the heat, not black pepper! If you like the consistency of flour our cornstarch, add them, but don't knock a recipe for not already containing those when it's a SPICE recipe. 
Allrecipes, you really need a REPLY TO option on reviews so that reviewers can see why their recipe went wrong.

Excellent.   I used 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder to accommodate my taste, but the other seasonings were spot on.  Top with diced seeded roma tomatoes,  shredded Mexican cheese, avocado, and a few dashes of Siracha if you like it hot!

This is so good! Made chicken tacos tonight. Boiled chicken breasts, shredded it with a fork, put in an iron frying pan with some water and the mix and cooked until the sauce was thick and hot. The whole family was happy and full :)

I didn't realize that I was out of taco seasoning until I was home from the store. Being lazy and experiencing low outside temperatures, I decided to give this a try. I didn't have oregano but everything else. added it to my Mexican soup and I was blown away. I will never use the other stuff again. the dish smelled earthy and yummy while cooking all day and tasted wonderful. I think I'll make a batch to have on hand at all times. Thank you!!

This was a good recipe to use as a jumping off point for me. I thought the flavor was good, but it could be improved in some areas. All in all, I would recommend this, although it does have some heat. If you are making this for your kids, try a small amount first and make sure it's ok before giving it to them.

Omitted red pepper flakes, used onion flakes in lieu of onion powder. Turned out great for a ground turkey taco salad. You'll want to add corn starch or arrow root to any recipe that needs thickening. I added separately - well after adding this seasoning.

Way, way too much salt. To properly season a pound of meat, you need about 3 tablespoons of the seasoning, which results in an overly salty taco meat. Reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon and it may be ok. You can always add more later.

Very good! You will never go back to the commercially made stuff in the envelope ;-). Since Chile Powder is the primary ingredient, use good stuff that's fresh if you can (I bought some online directly from a New Mexico Chile farm).

After the meat was browned, I added around 1/2 cup water, then seasoning, and simmered 5-10 minutes to mix everything together

This seasoning is great!  I tried it because I forgot to buy pre-packaged taco seasoning and I am happy to say I'll never go back.  It's easy, tastes better, is less slaty and there is NOTHING artificial in it.  So glad I found this.

I'm happy to say it tasted great and definitely less salty than a package mix.  I have a corn allergy and was thrilled to find this.

I used this instead of a prepared packaged mix.  It is delish!  I used about half of this for a casserole.  I won't buy packaged again!

Went to make tacos and did not have my traditional seasoning packet..Old El Paso.  What a blessing in disguise.  This is 1000 times better.  Followed recipe to a T.  I might try to cut the salt down next time just to make myself feel better.  I did not use all the mix for 1 lb. hamburger.  Sprinkle on a little at a time to suit your desired level of spicy. Yummy!

Excellent but quite spicy.   It makes the equivalent of a store bought packet.  I will definitely use this again.

This is so much better than any envelope I have tried. I will never buy them again.  I added a tablespoon of dehydrated onion and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of pepper flakes but we like spicy in our house.     I browned a pound of extra lean ground chicken, added this recipe plus 2/3 c water and simmered until it boiled down. Then, I filled a green pepper half way with the mixture put a layer of 2% cheddar, filed the pepper with more seasoned chicken then topped with more cheese and baked until the peppers were browned.   My dieting wife loved it!!!

This is one of my favorite DIY Taco seasoning recipes! It's easy and makes just enough for a pound of meat. I like to add a 1/2 Tbsp of cornstartch to help thicken up the water I add (1 cup) so it's more like the seasoning packets from the store only without all the nasty ingredients.

Love it with tweaks to make it more like Taco Bell mild:
1 tsp. chili powder
1/2 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. paprika
1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. salt

Awesome! I was skeptical about the oregano, but I threw it in anyway and it's great. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper because we like our taco seasoning a little spicy. Also added a 1/4 teaspoon sugar.

Didn't have anything prepared in the house and I had found a great chili seasoning online, so I looked for taco seasoning. Hubby doesn't like things too spicy, so I left out the crushed red pepper. This was a winner-used it on a package of ground turkey I had browned for tacos (1.5 lbs meat). I mixed it into a cup of low sodium chicken stock, added it to the meat and let it simmer for a few minutes. Already looking forward to left-overs!!

This was very, very good. I did not really measure because I was in a rush to get dinner completed. I omitted the red pepper flakes because I can't handle too much heat. I will save this recipe and use it hoping forward. Thank you!

I ran out of taco seasoning packets while freezer cooking the other day.  I found this recipe and tried it.  I love it!  I don't think I'll ever go back to the packets again.  I'm sure this has a lot less sodium anyway!  I'm a wimp when it comes to spice so next time I'll tone it down a bit but the flavor is excellent!

Exactly what I needed; measured it directly into the pan as I browned the hamburger. Let it simmer in the seasoning/fat for a while before draining off the fat. It was fantastic.

Loved this. Ridiculously easy and cheap. I added a tablespoon of flour to make it thicken slightly when it cooked and added a quarter cup of water to the pound of ground meat. I make several batches at a time and store them in plastic baggies to use as needed. This is so much better than the store bought versions and I really hate paying for packaging and advertising that I can't eat.

As most have said this taco seasoning is amazing.  Only thing I would do different the next time I make it, and I will only use this from now on, is I would halve the salt.  Too salty for me.

My go-to 'Mexican' seasoning! I sub cayenne for the red pepper flakes (I never like biting into one of those, so the ground works just as well). If I'm making fajitas or pork I usually add an extra 1/2 TBS of cumin to knock up the flavor. Also use this in homemade black beans, refried beans, Mexican rice, and burrito filling. The taste is so much better than the packaged stuff--you're able to control the sodium and spice levels so everyone is happy.

I had every ingredient for this- EXCEPT the crushed red pepper flakes which I am not a fan of! But I was SO happy! But even happier after making the tacos! This recipe is beyond excellent! I did not use salt- I think the chili powder has a "salty" taste on its own (there is no salt in it) ... so I omitted the salt here. Just as I do with home-made fajita seasoning- I do not include salt for health reasons. Here is a tip- for those whom enjoy spicier tacos  / latin meals---- use 3 or 4 drops of Tapatio hot sauce when the ground beef is done - just before you add this awesome seasoning. Maybe 3 for starters. Tapatio is NOT hot but just "warm" enough for a bit of a kick. I do not suggest american hot sauces for Latin food. BUT- back to this recipe....I measured everything just as listed and it was fantastic. I felt so good about making a seasoning on my own without the sodium that is contained in manufactured, " store-bought" seasonings. The cumin is the beauty here. And yes I did use black pepper. I simply had the stuff in my kitchen to make these tacos magic. I kid you not! Try and enjoy! Even if you have to go and buy these seasonings- you can find them at very low prices. Some less than a dollar! Its well worth it for your health and for the unique, fresh taste of something home-made- instead of a taco "kit" or a manufactured brand of seasoning---oh! ....wait....one tip,,,,add just 1/3 cup ?? of water and simmer until evaporated. GOOD LUCK! and ,,,,Peace and love- "Jenny"

Since I found this recipe I have never bought another packet of taco seasoning in the store.  My kids LOVE tacos.  This is all we use.  I multiply everything by 20, mix it all up and keep a container of it in the cabinet.  It's perfect!

Great!  Ratios are right on.  I don't have chill powder available where I live so I made my own by augmenting the other ingredients and a tsp of cayenne pepper (which is basically what chill powder is).  Thanks for the recipe it saved me on taco night! :-)

I tried this in a pinch when I realized I had no Old El Paso Taco Seasoning in the pantry after I'd already browned the ground beef. This is a spectacular recipe with ingredients I already had on hand. I haven't purchased the pre-made mix since!

You obviously don't need another review, but I had to share my thoughts!  I am slowly getting into "clean eating" which basically means less pre-made, preservative filled junk.  The problem is, I love the pre made junk because I am so used to it, and when I make things from scratch, sometimes it doesn't taste as good.  This recipe though? Hit the nail right on the head! It was fantastic! It tasted similar to the box stuff....but better!

I can also confirm that you can make it with ground turkey instead of beef, and it still tastes the same! It's great! Thanks so much!

I substitute cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes. Still great, and much finer that way. I recommend this recipe to my friends all the time.

I have been using this recipe for a few years and it's my goto recipe.  I do have store bought that doesn't have msg but I can't taste a big difference except that the store bought is saltier.  I like being able to control the salt and pepper.  I do use less pepper, red pepper flakes and regular salt.  I've never checked to see how much it makes altogether but I use the whole thing for a packet of ground turkey which is about 1.3 lbs.  A lot of the packets have too much sodium or use msg for that addictive flavor but I'm happier knowing what's in my food and not laying sleepless at night because of the msg.  Lastly I just tried this recipe with cooked shredded chicken breast meat sauteed with onions and a can of chopped tomatoes, rolled the filling in tortillas and covered in salsa and cheese baked together - my husband and kids thought it was delicious!

This is our go-to recipe for taco seasoning. No more store-bought versions for me. I usually have all these ingredients on hand, so this is very easy to whip up -- and then use as little or as much as preferred. That being said, I always pretty much go by the recipe's guidelines. Well, tonight I realized I couldn't do that, as I lacked a couple of ingredients after I recently performed a huge purge of past-expiry spices (and hadn't had a chance to replace them). Unwilling to foray out to the grocery store in rush-hour traffic, I decided to substitute a Tablespoon of Cholula hot sauce for the chili powder (BTW, who in Texas runs out of chili powder, am I right?) and a heaping Tablespoon of instant (dried) chopped onions for the onion powder -- then, b/c of the wet ingredient (Cholula), I gave the mixture a good stir and let it sit for about 15 minutes to reconstitute the dried onions and let the other flavors meld. It all came out WONDERFUL. I was worried the vinegar in the hot sauce would overpower the other flavors -- but it was fine. Still, I'm going back to the original recipe ... that is, when I have the proper ingredients on hand. Two noms up.

I've tinkered with this recipe for about a year and have found my favourite blend. I substitute 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of Chipotle Chili Powder in place of the red pepper flakes AND the black pepper.

Easily the best tacos I have ever tasted.  It is a fairly healthy recipe, no one ingredient has a lot of sodium.  I don't find it spicy, but my girlfriend does, so feel free to cut out the red pepper flakes.  Also be warned of adjusting the recipe, the site does not do well with 1/8 of a teaspoon, so if you increase to 1.5 ounces, some ingredients will remain at 1/4 of a teaspoon instead of 3/8 of a teaspoon

Ive found that using half as much ground red pepper as crushed is easier to use but the flavors are rather good. There are people that do not like it or do not think it has flavor or has too much flavor. This is because of the brand of chili powder used. I personally prefer the types that are a bit closer to red due to the flavor being less cuminy. If you use a weak chili powder it will be bland. if you use a darker chili powder it will be more cuminy. So pretty much all I am saying is to be sure to use a chili powder you like since 1/3 of this entire seasoning is made of chili powder. I also strongly recommend using ground red pepper since it more consistent in heat, just use 1/8 tsp instead of 1/4. I say this because my most recent crushed red pepper is way hotter than any other i have ever bought. And if I used it this would be inedible to most. Using ground red pepper and a redder chili powder my wife, who does not like things too spicy could eat it no problems as could my 3 year old son. I find it slightly spicier than store bought. But with a decent flavor that i had to mix 2 brands of store bought to get before. I've made this at least 6 times so far. A last note, please do not use 10 year old spices and complain that a spice mix has no flavor.

Just like out of the package except saves me so much money!
For Christmas I made a huge batch and divided into decorated spice containers for an addition to home-made gift baskets; it was a big hit!
I always have some in my spice rack now! Thank you!!!

I absolutely loved it. I don't have sea salt, so I used regular table salt, but cut it to 1/4tsp. Also, I was worried that it would be too spicy for my son, so I omitted the red pepper flakes. Even after cutting the pepper flakes, it was still super spicy. Since I love spicy food, it was perfect for me, but my husband didn't care for it so hot & my son couldn't eat it. I will make it again because the flavor was awesome, but I'll cut back on the chili pepper too. I used the whole batch the recipe makes for 1 lb of ground beef.

Excellent and will continue to use instead of buying taco seasoning. I made a triple batch so I have some for next time. I used a heaping table spoon per pound of hamburger and I think next time I would use just a tablespoon

I love being able to control the salt since packaged taco seasoning has so much.  It has a bit more authentic taste to it compared to the generic packaged stuff.  One of these days I will make a big batch and store it, but until then I will just keep making it as is!

I use it all the time. The only thing I do is add less salt, and add more paprika, cumin and garlic. I don't like alot of salt.
I like to take the chicken right out of the freezer and give it a heavy coat of this seasoning. As soon as its half way defrosted or hours later, I sear it on all sides with olive oil then reduce it to 2 for 30 minutes and its so tender and good. The chicken really absorbs the flavor.

I forgot to get the packet of seasonings when I bought the ingredients for a taco dinner and decided to look up a recipe. I am so glad I found this recipe. I tried it out on my daughter without telling her it wasn't a packet mix. She couldn't tell the difference. I used soy crumbles because we don't eat meat...it was great! No more packet stuff for me. I decreased the red pepper flakes..we don't like it too spicy. I am going to make a big batch of this to keep on hand. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I use a little less crushed red pepper (never tried full amount) because my son has a medical problem and cannot have it too spicy, but this seems to work well with his digestion. Made it half a dozen times now and it is so simple and easy, I will never buy store bought again. I just mic it together as the meat cooks. I use some flour also, as suggested in another review. This is the best! Thank you!

Very, very good.  Doesn't taste just like the packaged seasoning, but I think it's better.  Make at least a quadruple batch and save it in a jar for future use.  I used it to season beef for freezer burritos and they wee outstanding!

I honestly cannot tell you how angry I have become because so many people are comparing this to pagacked spices for tacos or whatever you may use it for. Ther is just NO comparison so please, stop comparing this to pacgaged, not even close. I have used this many, many times and find it wonderful. Didn't change a thing like so many people to. Tweek it to fit your style is alright; but when people say it is wonderful and then change everything, it is not the same recipe.

This is the best taco seasoning I have tried. I use it for everything, fajitas, chili, tacos (beef and chicken), I absolutely love it!!! I don't add much salt to the mix though to reduce the sodium.

This is an absolute keeper.  I used a little chipotle chili powder instead of red pepper flakes.  Made tacos with a pound of ground turkey, 3 tbsp of this stuff, 2 T of masa harina, a little water, and a little beef stock concentrate (to the give the turkey a beefier flavor).  Yummy, rich flavor!

Love this recipe and always have some prepared. I no longer have to purchase the packets in the store and I can control how much sodium I put into it. So very flavorful...thank you!

I always make 50 servings and keep it in a pretty jar on my counter. I like to add sugar, cornstarch, and beef bouillon powder to this. I do not put in the salt so I can turn up the seasoning without making my recipe too salty.

Used real garlic and onion instead of the powders, also mixed half a can of tomato paste with a bit of water, the spice mixture, and a bit of flour. Then cooked the water off. 

Turned out fantastic! Better than any packet.

My husband and I love tacos and make this seasoning in large quantities to keep on hand.  We enjoy it every time!  Sure beats the sodium saturated stuff we had been getting before finding this alternative.

2/7/2013: SO much better than store bought...plus, you can control the heat, sodium and can be sure there is no MSG! I have made numerous recipes of this for myself and for gifts (I buy empty spice bottles at Penzy's Spices). I've used this most often in  Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup here on AR, and it's always a crowd pleaser. I use anywhere from 3 - 4 Tbsp. As a matter of fact, I borrowed a friends slow-cooker for a party and am returning it with a copy of that recipe and a jar of this seasoning. Thank you Bill Echols and everyone else here who takes the time to review these recipes. So much great input! ***UPDATE 9/8/2015 Still making this seasoning mix. I make it in big batches to give to family members with kids. I've re-supplied one niece a couple of times because she goes through it fairly quickly (4 kids). I use about 3 Tbsp per pound of meat. Good stuff.

This is now the only seasoning I use for tacos. I have to be careful with store-bought mixes because I get migraines from MSG. This is, by far, the most delicious taco seasoning recipe I've tried AND it is MSG free!

I never knew how easy it was to make this from scratch! I skipped the salt and the onion powder, and it still tasted great.  I have made it 2 nights in a row now, using LENTILS not ground beef.  Cooked up some green lentils, drained, added veggie oil and this seasoning.  Piled it into hard shell tacos with cheese and sour cream the first night, then with cheese on top of nachos the second night.  So delicious! I like this way better than the packaged stuff, which to me always seems to have a chemical/plastic taste.  Will try it with ground beef soon, but lentils are just so economical and healthy!

Like many others, I turned to this recipe when I was in the midst of making dinner and discovered I was out of taco seasoning packets.  This was so good.  I will never go back to the packets again.  

Made a few tweaks.  Loved it!
- Mixed with 1 tbsp corn starch
- Added 2/3 cup of water after I stirred it in the browned meat
- Used with 1 lb of ground turkey (delicious)!
- Didn't add any salt, based on feedback it was salty.  No problem with salt, unlike the packets.

Save yourself the $1 and try this recipe.  Couldn't be faster or easier.

This was way too peppery, and for me lacked enough of the fundamental ingredients that make taco dishes taste Mexican.  I added half more of the cumin and chili powder, and then it started to taste more like a really good Mexican seasoning.  But as is, way disappointing. I'm not sure what the hype on this is.

This is so good!!!  I had my husband put it together while I browned beef for the Tacos.  Nice kick from the red pepper flakes.  I added cornstarch per a previous review.  Much better than the packaged stuff.

Wounderful. Never will go back to store bought. From other reviews, I added 1/2 TBSP of flour just so the seasoning would stick to the meat.

You're a life saver! I'm making taco's right now and realized I don't have any seasoning packets. I just made this, but I didn't add the crushed rep pepper flakes because I have a 2 and a 5 year old and I don't want it too spicy. It smells fabulous and smells just like the packet seasoning, so I know it'll taste great. THANKS! This will be my new season.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Too hot for one member of the family so the second time I cut the black pepper back by half and it was perfect for my picky eater. I now make up a large jar so I can just pull it out of the cabinet and use 2T worth per one pound hamburger. I add 1/2c water to the cooked hamburger and taco seasoning mix. When the water has cooked off I'm done. Easy and cheap. Great recipe!

I will never use store bought taco seasoning again! My four year old thought it was a little spicy so I now make a double batch and use half the amount of crushed red pepper. I use a tablespoon and half per pound of ground beef. I store it in an airtight container so we always have it on hand. Thanks so much!

Did not care for it.  Too much chili power or cumin.  Did not have that good Taco Seasoning taste.  I rinsed it out of my remaining ground beef and used Taco Bell seasoning.

I love that this recipe had everything that I stock in my spice rack. I did substitute the red pepper flakes with 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I was a little worried about using chili powder but it came out great! I will definitely make my own taco seasoning from now on!

Very very good.  It is also quick and easy to mix together.  I make a big batch so when we have tacos all I have to do is pull out the air tight container and sprinkle how much we are in the mood for over the meat.  I do sprinkle a little corn starch to the meat so it is thicker and juicier.  Doesn't add any taste just a consistency preference.

Tastes just like the taco seasoning packs!  My boyfriend couldn't tell a difference, and it's without the additives they put in the packets.  Also, I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp to reduce sodium.

I love this seasoning mix.  I use it all the time. The only thing I do differently from the recipes is I double the garlic powder and onion powder, but that is just person preference. I usually make a double or triple batch and keep it on hand for making tacos or enchiladas.

Aaaaaaa-mazing! this is the best taco seasoning that we have ever had. we used less chili powder the 2nd time we made it though. this will for sure be the only taco seasoning we use ever again.

SO perfect.  I did adjust and I added half the amount of salt, and I find that it is perfect that way.  OR you could just take out the salt completely and salt the meat to taste.

This was fantastic! The seasoning has a little bit of a bite (which we like) so cut down on the red pepper flakes if you like it mild.  I used two pounds of ground turkey, 7 Tbsp of seasoning & 1/2 cup of water and let it simmer for 20 minutes (you probably only have to simmer for 5)....the best tacos we have ever had!!!

Excellent seasoning, I ommitted the red pepper flakes since I was out but tastes just like the packages.  I mixed a mild chilli powder with a hot chilli powder since our family likes a bit more kick. Glad I found this recipe!!!!!!!

Good seasoning! While making tacos one night, my helpful son accidentally spilled the store bought packet of seasoning. I searched here and came across this recipe to the rescue!! Don't think I will ever buy a packet of taco seasoning again!

My family loves this. We will not go back to the store package again. Made the recipe just as suggested, came out perfect. I make about 5 lbs. of meat with the seasoning and freeze some for another meal. I use about 2 Tablespoons per pound and add about 2/3 cup water and simmer about 15 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

No need to pay for packaged taco seasoning.  This is so easy.
9/22/2016.  I now live in Mexico. I just made tacos for a Mexican friend and they wanted this recipe. How much more authentic can this be?

Only a couple of changes to the original recipe. Skipped the red pepper flakes and used Mexican chili powder. There is some heat in Mexican chili powder. Just enough for is. Used 1/2 half the suggested Sea Salt. There is no comparison to the packaged seasoning here. The seasoning has much more depth of flavor.

Perfect mix of seasonings.  I didn't have onion powder on hand so I used a couple of teaspoons of dried minced onion.  I agree - who needs those packages of taco seasoning when this is so easy!

Way too much cumin.  It was all I could taste unfortunately.  :(  So next time I will cut the cumin in half.  Then I'm sure it will be yummy.

It's perfect....just like the packets, but so much cheaper.  I multiple the recipe by 4 and keep it in a jar.  I use 1 tbs and 1/2 cup of water per pound of ground beef, and I mix in some chopped green onions.  This seasoning also works on mexican-inspired chicken or fish.

Made this today as I was out of the storebought variety...it's not quite the same flavor, but good.  I ground my own black peppercorns with a mortar & pestle, then blended the rest of the ingredients in and mixed well.  Took about 5 minutes to make! 
For sure, it's more cost efficient and love having it on hand...I put it in a small ziploc bag for storage.  Thanks for posting this!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I had to fool around with different types of chilis to get the best flavour.  I use Dried Ancho Chilies that I get at a local Mexican grocery store.  Using them this recipe is fantastic!!!!  I also use about 1/8 tsp cayenne powder instead of the hot pepper flakes, just feel it mixes in better that way.  Love this recipe - thanks for posting!!!

Thought there were some envelopes of taco spice mix in the pantry - I was wrong.  This will now be my go-to for taco/nacho meat!  Used kosher salt (salt is salt is salt - unles it's iodized), 1/4 tsp. cayenne instead of pepper flakes (better heat distribution).  Used the entire recipe in 2 pounds of 80/20 ground beef - and added 3/4 cups water, then simmered 10 minutes.  The nachos were great!

Fantastic! Exactly like we like it.  Added 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch with about 1/2 cup water to spices and left it to simmer for about 5 min.

Several of my friends have allergies so I was looking for a recipe for a taco mix that didn't include MSG, wheat, soy, or corn and this was it! My friend was so happy I had thought of her and her kids so they were able to enjoy the taco meat at a taco salad potluck.

I didn't realize how easy it would be to prepare a taco seasoning. The flavor of this seasoning is more fresh and vibrant than the packet seasoning you purchase in the grocery store. I followed the recipe as written and, I will definitely use over and over again. Having this recipe is a plus as you can tweek according to your likeness. Thanks for an amazing recipe Bill!

Fantastic!  I will never buy Taco Season in the packet ever again!  I used this in an buffalo chicken enchilada recipe I found online that required a tomato based sauce with taco seasoning in it and it was amazing!  Went over big with the fam...can't wait to try it with tacos! :)  Definitely a winner!

Thanks, Bill, for this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  I added an equal amount of cayenne pepper to the crushed red pepper to give it a bit more kick, and also cut the salt down by one third.  I find that if there are more spices, a bit less salt is still o.k.  Thanks again, my taco beef turned out fantastic!!!

I need a pkg of taco seasoning to make Chicken Taco soup and didn't want to run to the store JUST for that/found this recipe. Used half a batch to replace that packaged mix in the recipe. Not surprisingly this does have a big more kick than the pre packaged version for the same amount!

I ran out of my jar of taco seasoning, so used this in a pinch for vegetarian tacos - this recipe is yummy!  I'll never use a packet again!  

I left out the garlic and onion powder, and used about half an onion and 1/2tsp of crushed garlic from a jar when I actually made the tacos.  I also left out the red pepper flakes because my kids would think it too spicy.  I used 2 1/2Tbsp of the mix for tacos made with 12oz veggie protein crumbles instead of meat, and it was really tasty!  Cooked everything in about 1/4 cup of water to help meld spices.  Kids finished their whole dinner, so you know it's good :)

My family loved this seasoning! The flavor is much better any store bought packaged mix. I used the seasoning on one pound of browned ground turkey and it was a hit, even with my 4 year old and my 3 year old, who are very picky eaters. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Not bad.  But it was a little salty as other reviewers have mentioned.  My husband normally eats four or five tacos and only ate two... he said it was too garlicky.

I've been using this recipe for years and would recommend it. It is better than any package taco mix for sure. I find that 1.5 TBSP is perfect for 1 lb of ground beef.

I went on a search for a taco seasoning that did not have hardly any carbs as I'm in the induction phase of a low carb diet and have to be very choosey where I get my 20 max of carbs from. The packet of taco seasoning I have had 4g of carbs per teaspoon.. that's a lot of carbs.  This tasted better and is much healthier then the package stuff.  I will always use this for my seasoning.. you know everything is healthy and fresh.

The seasonings and heat level work well together in this recipe. We then add 1 to 1.5 pounds of cooked ground beef and 1/2 cup water to make the tastiest taco meat!

Best ever!!   Like many others, no need to buy prepackaged taco mix ever again, the flavor is so much better than any of those.  Great for hubby and I as we are gluten sensitive and this eliminates that as an issue.   Thanks!!

First, this recipe had no instructions other than mixing.  How much per pound?  Add water?  Second, this tasted NOTHING like the taco packet from the store!  It was just spicy.  I like things hot, but this was a bit much.

Perfect!! Didn't have chili pepper, but used cayenne. Loved it and will definitely be using it in the future in chili, dips and anything else that calls for it!

So glad I found this after realizing I forgot to buy a packet of seasoning. Now I will never buy a packet again. Had all spices on hand except cumin and I just added more chili powder instead. Thanks!

followed to a T...i've never been one to use "taco seasoning packets", I'm more of a "season as i go" type of chick. But this lacked some serious flavor in my opinion. Kind of a let down considering all the rave reviews this has gotten. I can appriciate the smells but I needed to vamp up the seasoning in order to be remotely satisfied with the taste.

I made this for nachos and it was fantastic! The only thing I changed was using cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes. No more prepackaged taco seasoning for me ;)

I will never buy packaged taco seasoning again.  This is soooo much better and doesn't have that salty artificial taste.  Only change I make is to add a bit of cornstarch to my mix so that it thickens up when mixed with meat and a little water.

This is far better and much more economical than buying taco seasoning packets.  I always keep a shakerful on hand.  We like spicy food, so we use it up quickly.  Thanks!

Amazing seasoning base. I omitted the garlic and onion powder (didn't have any in my kitchen), and used garlic salt instead - cutting back on the 1 tsp. of salt to 1/2 to compensate. Tasted lovely with my bean/veggie filling for vegetarian tacos! Will definitely make again, and I agree - never using store-made stuff again.

Fantastic. I added some cornstarch and a bit less salt. My boyfriend doubled the recipe and put it all on about one pound of meat and it was very spicy. A little goes a long way with this one. Just add a little at a time til you get the flavor you want.

great to use when we don't have the bought packaged mix.  My husband couldn't tell the difference the first time.  Then he found out I made it from scratch, and didn't quite like it as much! Not sure what to make of that.

This really doesn't have any flavor.  All we could taste was hot, which we like spicy stuff, just needs more flavor.  We added some sugar to balance the spice but still didn't work for us.

I won't be buying taco seasoning from the store any more.  This had such full flavor.  I loved it.  Plus, I think that there's too much salt in the pre-packaged stuff so it's nice to have some control about the amount of salt I want in it.  Next time I make it I will lessen the amount of garlic powder a little bit but otherwise, this was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this!!

I am allergic to corn so most if not all packets of seasoning have cornstarch in them which is bad news for me. Its got the right amount of kick to it.

I made this when I realized I didn't have any store bought taco seasoning on hand.  I used 2 1/2 tablespoons to one pound of ground beef and it was a bit spicy for me but my husband loved it.  Next time I would use 2 tablespoons instead.  Even though taco seasoning isn't expensive I would definitely make this again.  The recipe made enough so that I can use it a second time.

My dear bf volunteered to make supper.  He thought we were out of the packaged seasoning, so he tried this recipe.  We have no paprika, so he subbed cayenne pepper!  It was delicious, though a little spicier than he likes.
Update:  I have made the recipe with no mods many times now.  It is great.  5 batches fit perfectly into an old spice jar from Aldi, so then all you need to know is to scoop out 8 tsps OR 2 Tbs + 2 tsps OR 2 heaping Tbs OR 3 scant Tbs per pound of meat

I found this recipe when I was making tacos and realized I didn't have a seasoning packet.  I omitted the red pepper flakes as I don't like too much spice, and this was great!  I will never by store bought taco seasoning again!

I used it with chicken I had chopped and cooked for wraps and it was very good. This will be a staple seasoning for me. I'd been looking for pkg taco seasoning that didn't have MSG and found one one brand (out of about 4) that didn't have it and already knew I didn't like that brand. This was a fortunate find. Very good recipe. I eyeballed the measurements and used all of it for the one meal. Happened to have all the ingredients on hand except rep pepper flakes ~ was very good.

I fryed some onion in olive oil, then browned some precooked bulgur wheat, seasoned it with this, and it was amazing. Even my meat and potatoes guy said it was really good!

Came out great.  Based on other reviews & what I had around, made the following tweaks:
Didn't have garlic powder, so used garlic granules, upped it to 1tsp.
Didn't have onion powder, so used dried minced onions, also upped it to 1tsp.
Left out the crushed red pepper flakes as I thought the chili powder would make it hot enough.
Added about 1 tsp corn starch.
I left everything else as is.

I then combined the whole thing with 1lb browned ground beef + 1 can diced tomatoes + 1 onion + 4 cloves garlic + 1tbsp tomato paste. Served over rice w/sour cream.  Yum!  Seasoning was pretty much perfect.  Can't wait to see if time in the fridge improves the leftovers!

Amazing & Simple.  I decreased crushed red pepper to 1/8 tsp and added smoked paprika.  I added whole recipe to 1 lb browned ground beef, 1 can of refried beans, and 1 can of fiesta corn and AMAZING AMAZING is what it was....even my 2 year old was in love!

Really enjoy this taco seasoning! We are a delicate bunch in my house--not much tolerance for spicy foods--so a pinch does the job quite nicely for most dishes!!

Spot on!  Didn't use paprika or peppers due to sensitive eaters and it still tastes like a premade pack.  I always have the ingredients handy, never thought to make before, but will from now on.

The last time I will ever buy pre-packaged mix!

I tried this tonight with ground turkey (for nachos), and it was fantastic! I couldn't believe I'd made it! 

Albeit, I was a bit hesitant to use it after I'd made it. The smell of cumin was overpowering, but once I'd mixed it in the turkey with some water, it tasted fantastic! 

I added about half a teaspoon more of garlic powder, as I like a lot of garlic in my food. 

I plan on making a large batch to put into a small mason jar.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of a reviewer and added beef bouillion to my meat (I browned 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 extra lean ground beef).  Good call! :)

Very good seasoning. This came in handy when I realized that i did not have packets of taco seasoning. I did not add as much red pepper flakes as I did not want it too spicy. Instead of dried oregano I used fresh oregano, chopped up. I did scale back on the amount of oregano. It smelled just like how a taco seasoning packet does only better. Very easy to put together as I had all the ingredients on hand. What's great about this recipe is that I have more control on the amount of seasonings and level of spiciness I put into the mixture. I ended up close to 3T worth of taco seasoning that I used for my recipe tonight. I used this taco seasoning for,"Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup," from this website.

This is AWESOME!!! I've looked at the other recipes and this one has the most ingredients and only the relevant ones. People flip over when they try our ground beef, chicken or steak for fajita's and taco's. They can't believe how good it is. I add a little ground white pepper and cayenne too. P.S. so easy to throw together. I make a bunch and store mine in an old spice bottle and just sprinkle some on when I need. Thanks a bunch!!!

This recipe is great! I've recently started a diet/program/whatever you want to call it that involves eliminating unnecessary additives and artificial ingredients and foods from your diet. My husband wanted tacos this afternoon and one look at the ingredients in the sauce and seasoning in the kit made me turn up my nose. MSG, sugar, corn syrup -- barely any seasoning. I swapped in this recipe with 93/7 lean ground beef and it was amazing! Even better than the seasoning packet in the taco kit. I made up a second batch of the spice to mix with tomato puree to make a "taco sauce" type addition to our meal. It all worked perfectly! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe!  This is now my go to taco seasoning recipe...packets taste bland after using this!  Only thing I change is a little less red pepper flakes (so it's not so spicy for my kids) and I do add a little ground up beef bouillon to add to the flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing! ;)

We have used this recipe for a couple years now.  We started out doing it as written, but have changed it up some over time.  We often leave out the paprika and double the cumin because we like that flavor.  Sometimes I leave out the oregano if I just don't have it.  I usually leave out the black pepper, and sometimes use cayenne instead of red pepper flakes.  Very good as written, though I think we prefer it with our tweaks.

This was really great! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 tsp of cornstarch mixed with 2/3 c water for 1 lb ground beef. It initially seemed like way too much seasoning for just 1 lb of ground beef, but I gradually added it all and I was glad I did. Delish!

This works great and at a fraction of the cost from buying the packets in the store.  It's still a bit bland for what we like, so we just have to use a bit more when we season our meat.  I make a big batch and keep it in a lidded airtight container in the cupboard.

I made 25X the recipe and the results were very consistent. I have made large batches and bottles as gifts. Very well received! Slightly spicier than store packs; just lessen the red pepper flakes as desired.

as is was a little spicy for us. I cut down the chili powder to 2tsp, and halve the black pepper (we use freshly ground pepper and it made it really spicy with a whole tsp). i also add 1tsp cornstarch so it thickens a little and sticks to the meat better. with these changes it's a 5 star recipe  for us, that we use all the time

I have very limited experience cooking. However, this recipe was super easy to follow. In fact, the most difficult thing for me was going to the store for the spices and other taco makings I did not have, and even that was easy. 

The recipe does not note the amount of water to add to the browned and drained hamburger once you add the seasoning mix. After reading some reviews and completing a Google search, I added 3/4 of a cup of water, and that worked perfectly.

The flavor had a little kick to it, which I prefer. This is way better than any of the packets you buy in the store and it is so worth taking just a few minutes to mix some spices together. 

I bumped up the quantity from 10 to 80, which results in 18 tablespoons of mix. At 3 tablespoons of mix per pound of hamburger, this is enough for 6 pounds of hamburger. Instead of mixing spices each time I make tacos, I just placed all of the ingredients into a jar, shook the jar really well, and the mixture should maintain a strong flavor until I use up the rest of the seasoning.

Excellent with game meat tacos.  I used elk ground and the spices were perfect.  I am a born and raised Texan - but home in Colorado for 42 years - will share this recipe.  I did add a little extra red pepper - as I love extra spicy.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The first time I made this fresh, it was really good. After being sealed in a mason jar, in a dark cupboard for a month, the taste totally changed. My daughter wants me to go back to old elpaso mixes. Maybe I will just make up enough as I need it.

Thankyou so much for this Bill. I searched for taco seasoning here but could only find it in the taco kits. I didn't want to buy those so came home and searched for a recipe on here. I made exactly as written and will definitely keep on hand.

After committing to making tacos with this recipe, I realized I didn't have chili powder so I substituted 1 tbsp chili sauce instead. I added 2 tbsp water and mixed everything together. It smelled and tasted AWESOME! Yummy... won't be buying the packaged stuff again that's for sure!

Excellent. Packed with taste, but not over the time. VERY close to (but better than) the store purchased packets. After trying this, I was inspired to make up a huge batch to keep on hand. Fantastic recipe!

I recently made walking taco's for my son's High School graduation reception and decided to use this taco seasoning. I'll definately use it now for my family. Much better than any store brought brand. I wanted a more personal touch for our guests!

This is a great taco seasoning. I mainly use it when making shredded chicken soft tacos. I simmer chunks of leftover rotisserie/roasted chicken, shred the chicken with a fork, adding this seasoning to the water and covering with a lid. I've used it once on ground beef tacos and it was pretty good. But I'm more of a chicken person. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Not bad at all. It is easy enough to play around with the ingredients to get your desired taste but be careful it can easily start tasting like a chili seasoning.

Home late from work and was desperate for something to make- I had everything for taco rice... except the seasoning. This seasoning is, in my opinion, PERFECT as is. The first time, I only had ground red pepper but it came out the same flavor-wise as the flakes. I will NEVER buy taco seasoning again, so thank you so much!

I didn't have any paprika or red pepper, so I substituted a total of 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead.  I also used slightly less than a teaspoon of sea salt, and it was still plenty salty, so I think that could be reduced next time.  With my substitutions, it made slight over 6 teaspoons (or about 2.5 tablespoons).  I ended up using about 1.5 Tbs for 1/2 lb of ground beef and the amount of seasoning seemed to work just fine.  Like others mentioned I added flour to the mix before dumping on the browned, drained beef and added water (a little over 1/3 cup) and let it simmer down.

Was looking for an alternative to buying a package....for a few pennies, I made this....turned out great!....i may use a little less cumin to reduce the woody flavor, but other than that, it was great.
Add or reduce pepper flakes to taste....recipe was about medium heat.

I, too, was making the great Mexican Layered Dip I dound on Allrecipes.  No taco seasoning!  I found this very quickly.  Suffice it to say, I'll never buy the other stuff again.  Great.

I love this recipe - I never buy the packaged stuff anymore.  I triple it and keep it stashed in a jar for anytime use (I DON'T triple the salt!).  It's great!

Excellent! I didnt realize that I didn't have any taco seasoning and the hamburger meat was already browning. This recipe saved the day. I even messed it up but it still came out great! Very easy with ingredients I already had in the Kitchen!

This was wonderful, better than the packaged stuff, and I love knowing exactly whats in it and that I can change anything I don't like. I used this for steak and chicken tacos and my whole family loved it, even the picky 6 year old.

This blend is always on hand now.  Good in ground meat for tacos/enchiladas (make sure to try the enchilada sauce here too).  Tasty as a rub on chicken or carne asada and grilled.

Almost perfect!  The only change I make is to also add 1 tsp of corn starch for thickening, and helps "stick" to the beef.  After placing all the ingredients (including corn starch) into a 1c container with lid, I give it a shake.  Just 1-2Tbsp of this seasoning with a bit of water works great in ground beef.  I've also used this as a seasoning on chicken breast, onion & green bell pepper when making homemade fajitas.  Fantastic!

Love this recipe.  I was in the middle of making tacos when I realized someone used the last packet.  This was a life saver and my kids loved it.  We won't be buying packets again.  I used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons for 1 pound of ground beef.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent seasoning!!  I bought about 1 3/4 lbs of ground beef and the amount of seasoning in the recipe was the perfect amount - used it all and didn't need more.  Delicious!!!  1 million times better than the packet seasoning in the store.

This is a good recipe for taco seasoning.  I especially like that it does NOT contain corn starch.  I add it to bulghur and one small can of organic tomato paste for a veggie taco (I also add diced, sauteed onion and garlic).
August 2015
I used this recipe again this month for a giant birthday party for a friend.  I seasoned 30 pounds of beef.  It was just great!
2019... still using this recipe for my taco seasoning.  Everyone raves at how good the tacos are.  I'm sure because the spices are fresher and there are no fillers, binders, thickeners.  Great recipe!

I will never have to buy pre-made packets again! I used about 2 tsp of Cayenne pepper instead of flakes (because we didn't have any) and additional garlic powder and pepper because my husband and I like spicy food. This was our venison enchilada base and it worked wonderfully!

awesome! I was spending $1 on those packets every time I wanted to make tacos, but not anymore!  I've been using a little less then 3tbs/lb, I used 3tbs the first time but the hubby said it was a little strong, so maybe use a little less for someone with a weaker stomach

This is an excellent recipe!  A great idea to do after Thanksgiving: use this seasoning and reheat thanksgiving turkey with a little olive oil and water.  Then treat it just like you would for a soft taco!  No more getting sick of those turkey sandwiches!

We have used this recipe for years and LOVE it!  You can spice it up by adding more red pepper flakes or spice it down (for company).  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It gets 5 stars from our house!

This didn't turn out right for me- followed directions exactly, except used reg salt cause no sea salt in the house.

A little spicy for our tastes, but not bad taste wise.  It would replace store bought for me, but when I didn't have the store bought this was an easy go to recipe.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I like the idea of making my own seasonings, and knowing there is no MSG in it.

Better than seasoning packets! As another reviewer suggested, I added a little flour to the ground beef wtih 2/3 cup water and 3T of the spice mixture. I loved it but it was too spicy for my children. Since then, I've just reduced the amount of seasoning and the kids like it, too.

This recipe is fantastic!  I make this recipe once a week and it works perfectly for taco's or burritos and even mexican rice!  I use 2 lbs of ground beef and follow the recipe as described and add a few more red chilli flakes because my family likes heat.  I add all the seasonings to the pan with the meat,  I then add 1 cup of water and let it simmer until reduced to desired dryness.    Very authentic and tastes even better the next day after letting all the flavors meld!

this was very easy and yummy!  I agree I may never buy store bought taco seasoning again! I however, did not have any cumin or red pepper flakes on hand so I mixed without it and it was still great!  Still had a little kick and best of all my picky 3 year old loved it!

This was perfect! SOOO glad I found this. Never again will I buy the individual packages of seasoning. I used this in my mexican casserole that is a staple dish in our home. My husband told me it was the best one I have made and the only difference was this seasoning. THANKS!

Will never use packet of taco seasoning again. Used for chicken tortilla soup, chili, tacos, to season meat for enchilada's. Have made as stated and adjusted red pepper and chili powder depending on what I'm cooking. Thanks Bill.

This is my go to recipe--I even use this as chili seasoning, because it's not too spicy for small children. Great balance of seasonings.

Excellent taco seasoning. Made this without the red pepper since I don't like and no onion powder since I was out and didn't realize. Even without those ingredients this was very flavorful. I will never buy taco seasoning again.

LOVE this I don't change a thing about it either. When a recipe calls for taco seasoning I use this. I have it pre made in my pantry to grab and pour any time.

This is really good, so much better than store bought. I gave it to my daughter, she made it and her boyfriend said the tacos tasted much better than they ever had, so it was a hit all around.

It worked...but it was really spicy and seemed to be lacking something. I just can't put my finger on what it was. I'll probably put a little less salt in next time too.

SO GOOD!!  I added 2 Tbsp of flour (for thickening) for a complete seasoning packet.  I also reduced the chili flakes to 1/8 tsp and it was still hot but not unbearably so... Will be making a large batch to keep at hand in the pantry!

Pretty darn good. I only had 1t of cumin so I added 1/2t of coriander. It was a good addition, I will do again. I made the recipe and then added 1T of flour so I could add the water and have it thicken like the storebought the family is used to. They loved it, no more packages for me, this is very easy to make with basic spices most people have on hand. It is spicy though, be forewarned.

I always read ratings first to see what in common others say is needed.  I was surprised at the ratings all being consistent of this recipe (and tickled I could use recipe exact).   I made this (with 1/2 lb. of meat) and I always add a little more water and allow it to simmer down completely and work the flavor completely in the meat (on low heat).  I do advise doubling the recipe for a lb.

Very good, very simple. I quadrupled the recipe so that I can have it on hand whenever I like.  Aside from increasing the amount of Garlic powder in the recipe, the only other change I made was adding a bit of cornstarch to help the sauce thicken and coat the meat.

Wow, this stuff is delicious! I'll never go back to store-bought mixes again! One thing it doesn't mention is to add water when mixing it in with the meat. I add about 2/3 cup of water when I make it and cook it for about 10 minutes. Also, if you've got a pepper garden, some chopped jalapeno added to the mix adds an extra bit of kick!

Excellent recipe!  I did not know what to make for dinner one night and did not want to go out to the store, I had some ground beef, tomatoes, lettuce and cheese, but I did not  have any taco seasoning;  I found t his recipe and saw that it had very good ratings so I tried it.  Great taste and will be the one I use from now on instead of the store packets.  Thanks for posting...

Very good!  I added in a couple dashes more each of cumin and garlic powder.  Also, after adding the initial 2/3c water and mixing it and the seasoning in, I ended up adding an extra 1 cup of water and let it simmer (I had to get my preschooler down for nap).  When I was ready, I boiled off the remaining water while stirring the mixture.  Thanks for this recipe!

I was really happy with this recipe. I doubled the seasoning amount for 2 lbs of ground beef, but kept the crushed red pepper the same. It was still plenty spicy! I also added about 1/2 C of water, then brought to a boil and let simmer for 20 minutes. Really a much fresher tasting alternative to the seasoning packets. I will definitely be making this again!

I substituted cayenne for the flakes, increased the oregano to 1 tsp and split the pepper 1/2 black 1/2 white. Maybe too spicy for some I guess. I read some of the negative/1 star reviews. Maybe if the recipe stated to use "as needed" because it seems some think you use the entire amount. Depending on how hot your chili powder is to start with it may become overwhelming if you do so.

Awesome seasoning recipe! I used it for a taco salad that I make with browned ground chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and Frito chips and then topped with French dressing. The light sweetness of Catalina French dressing adds a nice twist of flavor to the salad. Rave reviews from all.  Added note: add 1/2 cup water with the taco seasoning to the browned meat and simmer for 5 minutes over low heat before using in any recipe.

This recipe was very easy to put together because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I doubled the recipe to make a full spice jar.  I made tacos with it and they were amazingly good.  This seasoning will be used in my household from now on.  Thank you BILL ECHOLS!

The whole family really like the flavor. I'm kind of wimpy when it comes to spicy food so I only put in 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes. After tasting it, I will probably stick to that amount.

This is an excellent recipe. Taste better then the packets without all the bad things in it.  I've never purchased another packet since finding this receipt.    I've used this about 30 times now and am just starting to play around with the different amount of the spices for a more custom taste for my Mexican cooking.  This is a keeper for me!

AMAZING!  I followed the recipe and one reviewers advice to add some flour.  It was so good.  My family loved it.  They all told me that they no longer want the "other" stuff we normally use.  I recommend making a big batch so you will always have some on hand.  I have already done so.

I wanted to make Taco Turkey Wraps from this site today for lunch but didn't have a package of taco seasoning.  I made this recipe and it worked out great.  I am looking forward to trying it in ground beef for tacos. ***I make this all the time now for any recipe calling for a packet of taco seasoning. I use 3 T. seasoning, 2/3 cup water, and 1 lb. ground chuck for tacos.

This is easy and fun to make.  My husband keeps asking me whether I liked his taco seasoning better (so I give this 4 stars vs. 5), but then he remembered how much work his was!!  This is easy and fun!  To actually use it with beef, use 3 T for every 1 lb beef.  Add 2 tsp cornstarch (optional) to 2/3 cup or 3/4 cup water (necessary) and add to the beef.  Last time I forgot the water and it was dry!

Perfect blend of seasonings.  I didn't have any onion powder so I left it out and just used about 1/8 cup finely chopped onion when I browned my beef for tacos. I added about a tsp. of cornstarch with the spices. When adding the spices to the browned beef I added about 1/3+ cup water and simmered the mixture for about 10 minutes.  I used this for 2 lbs of ground beef and it was just right.

My family loved this!  I added more heat with the red pepper flakes and a good dose of cornstarch.  After meat cooked I drained it well and added the seasoning with the cornstarch as we like a thicker saucier seasoning.  I upped the servings to 50 and filled a big jar so I will have it for other meals.

I've been making this taco seasoning for years.  I've never gone back to packaged seasoning since!  The only change I made (personal preference) is less salt and pepper and more chili powder.

This is great and I will  never buy the pre-packaged stuff.  I made this as written for beef tacos and it tastes wonderful.  This will taste as good as the quality of the spices that you use, so make sure that your dry ingredients are not too old!

Used this last night to season some ground turkey for a recipe.  It was excellent!  I did not even measure too accurately, just eyeballed it!  Had to add a bit of corn starch and water to thicken up the juices and make a "sauce."  No more packets from the grocery store for me!

Very nice! I've been a slave to the packet spice mix for years.  No more.  Now I can adjust the seasoning to just how the family likes it (ie, less salt, more garlic, whatever) and no more ingredients that I can't pronounce!

Perfect seasoning, so much better than that packaged . I double the recipe use half on lean ground beef for my family, and use the other half of the seasoning on Boca ground for myself.

This was easy and perfect for ground beef tacos. I would like to try it on chicken as well. I fed these tacos (topped with mexican white cheese and salsa in corn tortillas) to my very hispanic boyfriend, and he was muy happy. I will totally use this recipe again, and will probably follow the suggestion of others and make a big batch of it to use whenever. I used the whole ounce of seasoning for one pound of ground beef.

This is an excellent, easy, and cheap recipe for those taco nights. However, we did find it pretty spicy so next time we will be cutting the red pepper flakes in half since we're not really spicey folks.   Also, I did like others did and I added 1/2 tbsp of flour to 3 tbsps. of the taco seasoning mixture BEFORE putting into the pan with the ground beef. I also added 2/3 cup of water to the ground beef once I added in the taco seasoning/flour mixture.

This receipe is a great alternative to buying the packaged taco seasoning.  I made large batches and keep in in a shaker.  My family can just sprinkle it on anything they want to spice up.  It is especially great on nachos.

Good...I thought it had a little too much black pepper. Next time will reduce by half.  Only added a dash of red pepper flakes so my 3 yo would eat it.  Used 2/3 cup water per pound.  Will definitely use this instead of store bought.
UPDATE 9/2010 -- reduced pepper by 1/2 and cumin by 1/3...it was perfect.

Best taco seasoning!  I brown and drain the meat and add the meat, seasoning, and 1/4-1/2 c of water and cook in the crock pot for a few hours.

I accidentally didn't buy the taco kit so I was kind of stranded, and I decided to head to my favorite cooking site and got exactly what i expected!  A great seasong with fairly common household spices,  One thing I really enjoyed about this was that it wasn't "gravy like" with the kits.  Just meat, seasoning, vegetables and condiments.  Thinking of making a jar as I usually make tacos every tuesday!  4.5 STARS

This was great! I omitted the onion powder because I prefer fresh chopped onion sauteed with the meat. (I used ground turkey) I won't be buying premade taco seasoning anymore!

Great recipe, did it almost exactly, but I took the first reviews advice of adding the flower and water.  Not to spicy if you use the said amount of red pepper flakes.  Also I had no onion powder so I cut up a portion of an onion and sauteed it with the hamburger meat to begin.

This was very good, but tasted like it was missing something. The spice was a bit hot. It's nice to have this on hand for the last minute dinners when you don't have the taco seasoning on hand. Most ingredients are in a cooks spice rack, and the recipe is easy to put together and make extra to keep on hand.

My family loves this spice mixture.  The first time I mixed it I upped it to 40 servings.  It lasted one day since my kids had to take some home with them after tasting it in chili.  I made a quart jar of it the next day.  It's perfect.

What more can I say that hasn't already been said.  It's a great recipe made of a combination of pronounceable ingredients.  And yes, no MSG!!  Made a bunch so I'll have it onhand (as to not be tempted by the packets that are sitting in my pantry).  Mmmmmmmmmmm.

This recipe is the best! I was making tacos and went to get taco seasoning out of the cupboard when I discovered I was out of it. I used this recipe instead and it tasted as good if not better than the packaged seasoning. I don't think I will be buying the packaged seasoning any more.

I may have bought my last packet of taco seasoning......this is excellent. Very easy and uses common spices that most people probably have in the pantry. Very good flavor- better, I'd say, than store-bought- and a little spicier too, which was great for us. I made extra so it's handy next time I need some...

This was good but it was alittle too spicy for our family... the only mexican food we eat is tacos and nachos so our taste buds just are not used to spicy foods. BUT... It was good enough that I will try it again and just lessen some spices till I get it the way we all like it. Thanks.. I NEVER would of thought to make my own taco seasoning!

Very good! I have used this recipe now for a year. No more packeges for me!!! If you want to turn this into a Chicken Fajita mix, just add a spoon of cornstartch to it. Allows it to thicken and stick to the chicken.

I think this recipe is great! I had to cook 20 pounds of taco meat for a birthday party and didn't want to spend the $ on season packets since I knew I had all the spices at home. Found this recipe and it worked well. I quadrupled the recipe per 5lbs. of meat and took out a bit of salt. When the meat was brown, I added 1 cup of water (for 5lbs. of meat) and the seasoning and let simmer for about 10 minutes. Food was being made for the next day, so it sat in the fridge overnight and blended all the seasoning just right. It tastes great and the heat factor is dead on. Thanks!

If you really want it to taste like the packaged stuff, you have to add more salt.  But this has a great flavor that beats the package hands down.

Best taco seasoning mix I've ever had! I also substituted 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes. I will never buy store bought packets again!

This worked really well for my ground turkey tacos.  I used the entire yield of the recipe as written with about a pound of meat, and it was perfect -  very flavorful.  I intend to prepare this in a larger quantity and keep it on hand so I don't have to make it every time we have tacos.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I can't even remember the last time I used a packet from the store- never again!  This is wonderful with ground beef, ground turkey, or cubed chicken breast, and I also use it to season things like rice and beans or tortilla soup.  Thank you, Bill!  :)

This was great!  I used it on ground turkey to make turkey tacos!  Even my picky eaters loved it!!  It was a little spicy this time, so I think next time I will have to cut back on that a bit...but there will definitely be a next time!!!!  Thanks!!!

Great flavor and easy... I had everything in my kitchen.  No more store-bought packets!  I used this recipe as-is, and a little less than a pound of beef, with 1/2 cup water.

this is delicious!  what i do when i make beef tacos is add about 1 and a half cups of water to about a pound and a half of ground beef and add the seasoning after the beef has been cooked and drained.  my favorite though is to saute about 3 chicken breasts diced, add 3/4 cup of lime juice and a half cup of water with the seasoning and let it simmer down to make chicken tacos. YUM!!! it's too spicy for my two year old but just right for hubby and I.  delicious!

This is amazing! I will NEVER buy taco seasoning again. I usually leave the red pepper out because with salsa, becomes a very hot meal. I also add about 1/2 tsp. of flour which helps when you add the water (otherwise, even after cooking, the meat is too drippy).

It has a nice spiciness to it. Not too much at all. My family and I like it. I do feel like it needs a little something else. Using homemade spice mixes has the great advantage of keeping your stock of spices fresh. Also you it allows you to get to know your spices better, thus giving you insight to improvize more successfully through personal experience. I will use this recipe again.

Tastes better than the packaged taco seasonings! I just add 2 tsp of cornstarch to help as a thickening agent. I made a big batch of the seasoning and put it in a container so I can always have it on hand. I use it all of the time and we just love it. Thank you for a better alternative to MSG infused packet seasonings from the store. :)

I added some extra garlic & onion powder,cause we like it that way, & even added a bit of cornstarch-didn't even make enough for a second packet-so you might want to start out w/larger quantities from the beginning. I will definetely be making this often, & in much larger quantities so I can share w/friends & neighbors. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this up to add to cream cheese for a taco dip.  It is a nice seasoning mix, but I added more garlic and onion powder.  I also substituted ancho chili powder for the chili flakes, so that it blended together better.  The mix was far too salty for the cream cheese, but it might be alright for meat.

Decent recipe. A tad too much salt for my liking, I'll lessen it next time. I also added corn starch as a thickener and 1/2 cup water once beef was cooked and drained. I think the beef flavoring would be good too, but if you add a bouillon cube or pk, lower the salt.

Excellent taco seasoning mix!  I was in the middle of making Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup from this site and realized I was out of taco seasoning mix...and didn't have time to run to the store.  Fortunately, I had all the necessary ingredients to whip up a batch of this.  I whirled it in my Magic Bullet to break up the oregano a bit.  I'll never buy pre-packaged taco seasoning mix again!!

Best ever taco seasoning.  I was happy to try this recipe since the packaged varieties seemed to have changed over the past couple years and tasted terrible.    The only down side is the lack of convenience.  :)

Awesome, I have no need to buy packets ever again!! TIP: I took the biggest spice jar (as big as a PB jar), with the recipe written on a large label stuck to the jar and when I run out I have the recipe to make it again in a large quantity right on the jar . Also, I once bought a cheap chili pwd that has salt in it already, and it came out too salty, so read the your spice ingredients before mixing.

This was so good!  This had enough heat to have my mouth still tingling after eating it.  I added the whole thing to my meat and just added the 2/3 c. water to help simmer for about 6 minute. Once the water was gone I served it.  Thank you again!

I like this a lot, but it is way too spicey for my kids.  I think I will leave out the crushed red pepper next time and maybe cut down on the black pepper.  Make sure you have some sour cream on your tacos to cut the heat!!!  It's a great starting point though!  Thanks!

Very good! I ran out of the packet stuff and didn't have time to make the seasoning ahead of time, so I of course seasoned the meat as it cooked. My family loved it also as ground beef burrito seasoning. The selling point was when my husband gobbled down 5 tacos and half of my burrito and my daughter said I don't need to by the packaged stuff anymore ;). Thanks!

Believe all the hype. This is an excellent taco seasoning mix. I quadruple it (at least) and save the rest in a jar so there is always some on hand. Saute up an onion in oil first, and then add a can of tomato paste (to 20 oz of ground turkey, in my case) and discover the best homemade tacos you've ever eaten!

I found myself without the packaged taco seasoning and tried this recipe as a quick fix to avoid a trip to the grocery store. I'm sold! No more packaged stuff for me. I had all the spices on hand, so it's just a matter of throwing it all together. Also, I'm now able to cut back a bit on the hotter spices to accomodate the grandkids when they're visiting. Today, I'm making a large batch so it'll be a staple in my kitchen from now on.

I'm used to Old El Paso taco seasoning mix, so I was dubious when I first tried it - but hands down it is the BEST taco mix I've ever had...I REALLY enjoy the oregano in the mix, you think italian foods when you think of oregano but it just fits so well in this recipe! I also can enjoy tacos without MSG paranoia, and the added filler! Thank you SO MUCH for this FANTASTIC, TASTY mix! Not only does it taste great but its saving me money for my taco habit!~ :)

Wow. I only tried this b/c I didn't have a seasoning pack and I will NEVER go back. I used the recipe as is (10 servings) for one pound of ground beef and did not add water and it was delicious! I did leave out the red pepper flakes b/c I didn't have any on hand, I threw in some ground red pepper instead. De-lish! Thanks so much for posting this one.

I used this once when I was out of taco seasoning packets and I won't go back to packets.  My  husband LOVES this mixture.  I did modify it a bit.  I only use 1/8 t chili peppers and I use 1/8 t heaping of cayenne pepper.

Excellent! 
I omitted the salt to keep it low sodium... tastes just like the taco mix you buy in the store without all the salt and chemicals. I like it spicy so use 2 tbsp. per 1 lb of ground beef.

I've been using this recipe for about a year now and I can't imagine going back to the packet seasoning.  This is so good!  After the meat is browned I add 2 T of flour and 2 T of seasoning, stir, then add about 3/4 C water, simmering slightly until thickened.  Last Christmas I bought cute little spice jars at The Container Store and gave this blend as gifts to my neighbors.

Good taste, but WAY too spicy for my toddlers, which is why I don't give it a full 5 stars.  I was hoping that this recipe was close to the mildness of store-bought packets, but it isn't.  Had Need to tone down chili powder considerably and maybe leave out red pepper.  Could do a dash or two of cayenne.

I am not a huge fan of store bought taco seasonings as they are typically full of a bunch of Chemicals.  I used this on in a taco soup recipe and it turned out wonderfully!  I saved extra in a tupperware for later use.

Way better than the store bought kind! I took advise from one of the other reviewers and substituted cayenne pepper for the pepper flakes, and it was a little much for me. (I am weak when it comes to hot/ spicy food). Next time I will just make it with the pepper flakes.

mmm..... we made taco seasoning with this tonight.  It was so good!  We didn't have red pepper flakes, so we used cayanne.  It worked just as well.  We're going to make a whole bunch of this to keep in a jar.  All the flavor, no funky red color.

Great basic starter. I used this for my Cinco de Mayo tacos in the crockpot and it was great. I doubled the recipe for 2.5lbs ground beef. Added beef, seasoning, 4TBL water and a small  8oz can ofGoya tomato sauce (spanish style). Let it cook on low for 4 hours or longer. DELICIOUS!

My husband had sworn off tacos a year or so again, which was discouraging to me as because it is such a quick, easy, delicious meal!  He said disliked the artificial-preservative-y taste the seasoning packets gave the meat.  This is the perfect alternative!  The taste is the classic, taco flavor--but better and fresher!  He loved it and tacos are back on the regular dinner rotation!

Perfect! Used as stated per 1 lb. of ground beef. May be too spicy for the younger crowd.  Make sure you add water to the mix & beef and let it simmer for 20 minutes or so.

awesome recipe!!! i doubled the recipe because i had 3 lbs of ground beef. i cooked the meat first, drained the fat, and then mixed in the seasoning with some water...i think it was 2/3 or 1 2/3 cup water. mixed it all in there, added diced onions and some tabasco sauce to taste. it was excellent seasoning!!! tastes like the seasoning you buy in the little packages..but even BETTER!!

I think when you want to make this seasoning less spicy, you have to cut down the red pepper flakes and not the chili powder.I did add about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and used a mortar and pestle. The seasoning was not spicy at all; just a very nice flavour! Nice, nice, nice present also. I used ground beef but I think it will be yummie with chicken breasts, too.

This is really good but oh mama is it hot! I love spicy food but had to tone this waaaay down with some brown sugar and added more garlic salt, onion powder and oregano to cut back on the heat of the chili powder and red pepper. I added about 2 tablespoons of the mix to a pound of ground turkey and let it simmer with 1/2 cup water for 10-15 minutes.  Much easier and cost-efficient than the packaged stuff and I know exactly what's in it so will use this from now on but the recipe as written is definitely is not for kids or the faint-hearted!

My husband and I use this recipe now any time we want tacos.  We only scale back a little on the salt since we feel it not only has plenty of seasoning (you won't miss it) but we try to cut down on our sodium intake.  We also add 2/3 cup of water when we add the seasoning to the meat.  Either way, this seasoning is great.  Less sodium and no msg and no artificial ingredients like you get in those store bought packets.  Best of all, you probably have all of these ingredients on hand already so no need to waste any money on buying the store bought variety!  This one is much better.

I'll never buy store-bought taco seasoning again with this recipe! I've used it for pork and chicken tacos and it's excellent for both. I've also used this as a rub on beef for grilling, YUMMY! Thanks for sharing!!

This was REALLY good!!! I did make some changes, only to suit our preferred tastes. I cut the chili powder in half because I dont like too much heat, and then only used 1/4 cumin because I've never had it before so wasnt sure if I'd like it. I also just gave a dash of salt (we're not huge salt fans!) I used this with the burrito pie recipe and it was really good! A little heat but not overpowering!

I don't know what everyone else has been smoking but this was very spicy!  My kids could not even eat it until I put a little brown sugar in to tame it down and then only one of the 2 kids would eat it.  I would cut back on all the pepper and then add more if you need it.  I found 1/2 cup water about right.

I was out of taco seasoning and wanted to make slow cooker chicken taco soup from this site - one reviewer suggested Bill Echols' taco seasoning.  I made it and used it, and loved it.  No more seasoning packets for me!

I multiplied everything in this recipe by 4 (except salt and pepper I used 3 tsp ea) and keep it in an airtight container in the cupboard so that I always have some on hand.  I purchase my spices on the Hispanic food aisle (lower price and better flavor).  Great to have on hand for my "Taco in a Bowl"!

GREAT!!! Ill never buy from the store again.  I did add 1 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch and 1/8 teaspoon of ground red pepper to the seasoning and 3/4 cup of water once the meat was browned.  I simmer for 5 minutes and that was it!  LOVED it!

Great tasting seasoning! Will never buy a packaged seasoning again. I used the recommendation to mix cornstarch (2 Tbsp) with water (2/3 cup). A little too much cornstarch. It tasted pastey. I had to drain some of the great seasoning off to dilute with more water. Next time I will reduce to 1 Tbsp to 2/3 cup water. I plan to keep a mixture of this seasoning prepared for easy use with a variety of recipes!

This is so easy and tasty! I double the recipe and and store it in a my spice rack. That way it is ready when I need it, but it is so easy to make that you could make it on the spot. I use about 2 tablespoons per pound of meat.

This made really great taco seasoning!  No need for packets when I have all of these ingredients already in my cupboard.  However, next time I will only use 1 tsp of the cumin because I think that particular flavor came across a little too strong.

Like others before, I used this in a pinch. I'd just tossed some ground beef on some heat and realized I had no taco seasoning packets. I went for this recipe, which I'd saved to my box before. I had everything on hand and put all the spices together. The meat came out so tasty and gave the tacos a fantastic flavor. Taco seasoning packets for me are now a thing of the past!

Thanks for a great recipe! I was a little worried it would be too spicy (we're wimps around here, lol) but once I got it mixed with the meat (1 pound) and a can of diced tomatoes, thickened it with cornstarch and water, it was just perfect. So nice to know exactly what we're eating, instead of the packets. No more packaged seasoning around here!

SO much better than packaged taco seasoning.  I will reduce the salt a bit next time but that's what is so wonderful about making your own.  You can modify to suit your taste.  Fantastic!

Fantastic! I tossed uncooked chicken breast slices, red and green bell pepper strips, and sliced onion in the prepared seasoning. I then added some olive oil, 3/4 cup of beer, 1 tsp. soy sauce, minced cilantro, and freshly squeezed lime juice to the mix. I marinated the chicken and veggies for about 2 hours and cooked everything in a skillet. This made a great fajita/taco filling.

I found this too bland and a little too much bite from the black pepper, and even this much sea salt is too much.  I followed to a "t" and even after adding more onion and garlic powder, I found this bland. I added a little tomato sauce and worcestire sauce trying to doctor this up, we'll see what the family thinks, but I'm going to keep looking.

Better then any packaged seasoning you can buy.  I used it to season one pound on hamburger.  Next time i would double it.

I love it when I can make something tasty without having to go to the store to pick up special items that I'll probably never use again. This recipe was one of those where I had everything on hand and it was very very good, better than store bought seasoning. I used it on cubed chicken breast and we had taco salad. I will use this recipe alot.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum, this is great to have around and takes just a few minutes to throw together.  Much quicker then running to the store to get the taco seasoning packet I always seem to forget to buy!  I used 2 rounded tablespoons (2-1/2 Tablespoons if you like to measure exact) of this mix to 1 lb. ground beef.  These are spices I already have and this recipe helps me to use them up before they get bland.  And you can choose the quality of the spices you use in it so you can have a great seasoning mix if you use the better quality spices.  I added a little cayenne pepper 1/8 tsp to a double batch of this.  I think it would be fun to give batches of this away for Christmas along with some salsas and chips, and maybe some margarita mix and call it a Mexican siesta kit.

Excellent flavor.. slightly too salty for my taste, next time I'll cut it down a little.  We enjoyed this more than the pre-packaged taco seasoning.. probably partly because of the higher quality, organic herbs/spices used.

This was a PERFECT blend!  I made "ultimate" nachos for a benefit and they turned out great!  I used one tablespoon per pound of ground beef and added cheese, sour cream, olives, jalapeno slices and homemade pico de gallo - simply delish!!!

This was great!  I made this for my sister, who is always spending money on those packets of seasoning.  I omitted the salt, due to her high-blood-pressure and she and her family don't even miss it!  I am now keeping it on hand myself, for those quickie taco/burrito nights when I don't have much time.

This was perfect.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I heated a can of fat free refried beans with a  can of diced tomatoes with green chillies, and added about 2 tsp of the taco seasoning.  This was perfect to throw in tortillas for a quick dinner!

This is a great taco recipe and I had everything on hand. Also great as a vegan recipe. I marinated extra firm tofu in soy sauce, sesmae oil and black pepper, and crumbled it. Fried up some onion and green pepper and then addes tofu and enough spice to taste. put on homemade torillas with onoin, tomato and salsa or hots-sauce. Excellente!

(8/18/07)This was a good alternative to the package if you don't have it. I already had all of the seasonings needed. At first I was going to skimp on the salt and red pepper as other suggested, but I decided to throw it all in and it was perfectly seasoned.
UPDATE (9/20/07)- I used this on a pound of ground turkey and it was great! I used rounded scoops and you could on even tell it was turkey. My husband wanted tacos again the following night.

Used this with 1 lb. of shredded chicken breast for enchilada filling. Yummy! As good as the packet seasoning, with no lactose, wheat, or soy ingredients (as those packets usually have).

This is fabulous, and I will not be using store-bought taco seasoning anymore! I had to reduce the chili to about 2tsp, because I cannot get anything but actual pure ground chillies here in Australia - but it turned out beautifully.

Even BETTER than a packaged mix!!  

I had a little more than a pound of ground turkey, so I used heaping measurements of all ingredients, except for the salt, which I reduced to 1/2 t., and the black pepper, which I reduced to 1/4 t.  I also ommited the crushed red pepper; this still had plenty of flavor!  

After browning and draining the meat, I added the spices along with 3/4 c. cold water mixed first with 1 t. corn starch.  It came out perfect!!

I never seem to have those little packets on hand, so I will definitely keep this recipe on file to make again and again!

This was good!  I subbed ground coriander for the red pepper flakes and used half the salt, to better control spice and sodium.  Threw it all in with 1/2 c water and 1 lb cooked ground beef to make quick, easy, and delicious tacos.

GREAT RECIPE!  I used 1/2 the salt and didn't miss it a bit.  This seasoning is great on ground beef, but is even better on chicken!  Coat chicken with olive oil and generous amount of seasoning, then pan-fry until "blackened."  Delicious on taco salad!

Fantastic! A million times better than the package, and much healthier too. A very nice mellow, "round" taste to it, and it finishes with just a touch of heat. Best of all, the house doesn't stink afterwards. I cut the salt in half (1/2 tsp), and it was just as tasty (if not tastier - the cumin comes through much better).

This is the best seasoning. I omitted the red pepper so it wouldn't be so spicy.  I added 1/2 cup of water mixed with 1 T . of corn starch so it wouldn't be so dry. Let the stuff simmer a few minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.

This has very nice flavor.  I added 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cornstarch, to serve as a flavor blender and a thickener.  It worked perfect!

Excellent blend of seasonings!  This was neither too saltly or spicy.  I lightly browned 1# of ground sirloin, added the entire recipe of spices and about 1/2 cup of water.  Simmered until done.  A definite keeper here.  Thank you for the recipe!

great!  no need to buy the little envelopes anymore - I quadrupled the recipe (recipe as printed is good for 1lb) and have enough for awhile.  i've more than once started to make something that required the envelope of seasoning only to find i didn't have it.  now, i'll never be without!

This is just as good as the packaged taco mix and much more cost effective.  I used only 1 teaspoon cumin, and used a heaping tablespoon of chili powder.  I used all of the mix for one package of meat (about 1 1/4 lbs.)  Thanks for the recipe!!

I highly recommend this taco seasoning! I now use this recipe regularly whenever I need taco seasoning and never worry about buying the "mediocre" pre-packaged ones anymore. I do add two extra spices: minced onion & dried cilantro leaves. However, it is great without any changes as well!

I made this because I promised my som his favorite dinner, Tacos. We were out of seasoning and I decided to check here for a recipe. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A MIX AGAIN! This makes a super taco seasoning. I add dry minced onion to it as well. Thanks for saving my promise to my son and giving us an authentic tasting seasoning recipe.

We're kind of wimps around here when it comes to spice, so I halved the red pepper and it was perfect for us. I ended up making a big batch of this for future use...it's a keeper!

This recipe was awesome.  I made it with Veggie ground mock-beef to cut down the fat.  These were honestly the best tacos I've ever had.  I made them for my boyfriend and he ate 6 and I ate 3!  (were not huge eaters, so this was a lot, definitely for him!)

This works just as good if not better than the packets-I made 8 times the recipe to keep on hand. BTW- I did not have "sea salt" so I used table salt. Worked fine!

Just as everyone else had said, I will never buy the seasoning packets for taco seasoning again!  I thought I had a packet at home last night to make tacos, so I found this recipe and gave it a try.  My husband and I loved it!  Its a little more spicy than the packets, but that is a good thing.  I highly recommend!!

Great recipe!  I will never buy package mix again.  I have always tried to duplicate the seasoning packets with "something's missing" results.  Your recipe is dead on!

This is not nearly spicy enough!  Add some cayenne pepper (1 t. in this version)to make it a bit more Mexican.

This is a great replacement for store bought seasoning.  It's fun to try different ground chili powders to get different levels of heat and flavor.  Try a mix of ground ancho and chipotle chili powder in place of the generic "chili powder" concoction.

We loved this!  Will definately use this instead of packaged from now on!  I cut down the amount of crushed red pepper, black pepper, and salt to suit our tastes (small kids) and I omit the oregano.  Perfect!  Best tacos ever! Thank you!

This recipe is just perfect! I will never buy the packaged seasoning again! I like a little extra heat so I add more chili powder, but everything else is perfect. I think it is best with chicken, but I've also added it to turkey burger and steak and it's wonderful.

This was very good. It would be a five star but the recipe never states how much seasoning to use per pound of meat. I use two pounds of hamburger when making tacos and doubled the recipe. I thought I could have used more seasoning but who wants to get out all those spices again! Next time I will use more but wish the original recipe would have provided more guidance. Still, better than buying those little packets and a definite saver as I wasn't planning on making tacos this week so I had no packets on hand. I do everything possible to avoid walmart at 5:30! Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect!  Made a big batch, keep it in a sealed container in my cupboard - whenever we do a taco night I just use what I need.  Love it!  Will NEVER go back to store-bought.  Thanks!!

Excellent taco seasoning!  Just as good or better than the mix you buy in the stores.  I didn't have any crushed red pepper flakes or paprika so I made it without and it turned out great.  I used the whole mix with approx. 1 pound of beef.  Still spicy enough for me!  This is a life saver.  My husband and I moved to Scotland and it can be hard to find taco seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used this instead of packaged taco seasoning in Simple Southwestern Chicken Salad from this site. I did reduce the salt by half as my husband needs to watch his blood pressure. It was fantastic.

Made as described and used to make the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup from this site.  Good, but VERY spicy.  Will next time cut back on the red pepper and chili powder a bit.  Definitely hotter than packaged taco seasoning!

Simply the best! I will never have to buy Taco seasoning again. I don't think you can get any closer to the store bought. But this tastes even better. At least you can control the heat and salt.

So much better than the packaged kind!  I used a little less salt than called for and substituted ground red pepper (cayenne)for the crushed red pepper flakes and used about 1/8 tsp instead of 1/4.  Terrific!  Thanks!

Good. I made this and used it with one of the Taco Pie recipes from this site. It worked pretty well. Maybe a little too salty, but that can easily be changed. I made up a triple batch to have on hand for whenever I need it.

Like almost everyone else, we will not be buying any more of those prepackaged taco seasoning mixes. I fixed this with 2lbs lean ground beef, & added in a 1/2 cup of water. The picky eater though it was too spicy & refused to eat it. Luckily, it is way easy to modify it to your likings, Thanx!

This is a great way to make taco seasoning.  Watch the salt content though, it is a little too much.

Excellent!  Gave a taco Birthday party for my sons. Everyone loved it.  Cooked almost 5 pounds of ground beef, tripled the seasoning recipe, used cayenne pepper instead of flakes and added about a cup of water after adding seasonings.  Cooked, covered until water was absorbed.

I was in a tight situation too...forgot to buy taco seasoning.  Well, now I never have to again.  I'm not a big fan of the cumin so I added only 12 tsp and could taste it but it was not overwhelming.

Great seasoning mix! I have to leave out the cumin as we don't care for it and it still came out great! Thanks for the recipe!

leaves me with no reason to look for another taco seasoning recipe. let me put it that way  : )

just because i never have these ingredients, i always substitute the chile powder with the same amount of paprika, and sea salt with normal table salt.

This really was good, spicier than the packets.  The only change I made was to add the 2tsp of corn starch to the water (good idea). I am going to try some of the other suggestions and use less salt next time.

Great no-sugar alternative to store bought Taco Seasoning.  I have also tried using the mix with cut up peaces of chicken.  Not as good as ground round, but still quite tastey.

This is the best recipe for Taco Seasoning! This recipe makes enough for 1 lb of meat and I took others suggestions and added 2/3 c water. It was perfect.

This stuff is great! I have been using this recipe to make my own taco seasoning for quite awhile now. I make it in a large quantity and store it in a mason jar. I don’t eat a lot of salt, so I halved the salt in the recipe. I also omit the crushed red peppers for my kids sake and it’s still plenty flavorful for the adults.

I prefer to my own taco seasoning because I can control the ingredients and amount of salt. It makes all my dishes requiring taco seasoning so much better; especially my taco dip.

Yields 3 Tablespoons.   Double recipe to keep in a spice container for future use.   I use kosher salt.   2 Tablespoons per pound of meat is our family's preference.

Made as written, no changes.  Added 2 T. of mixture with 3/4 c. of water to each pound of cooked, drained meat.  Allowed to simmer, uncovered, to thicken on its own.  No flour or cornstarch added.  Great flavor!

I may never use store bought again.  It was yummy .
I used the whole recipe for a 1.25 lbs burger. We like the spice. 

 Browned the meat, drained grease, put seasoning on, added a cup of water and cooked down until water dissipated. 

So good.

I’ve been using this recipe for taco seasoning for a while. It is great as written, and much better/healthier than those little taco seasoning packets, which I have not bought in years! I make a large batch of it and store in an airtight container (start with a small batch to adjust seasoning to your preference before you make a lot). I use this mix in different dishes as well and find it easier for me to omit the salt and pepper. I prefer to season meat or other sides with S&P to taste as I’m cooking, especially if adding any canned goods. For those who have issues with spices or heat, omit the red pepper flakes, as we do. You also may want to reduce the chili powder by ¼ to ½, which we have not had a problem with, but everyone’s taste preference is different. In recent months, I have replaced store bought chili powder with Chili Powder by Terri from this site (I use about ½ tbsp. of it for this recipe). If making ground meat tacos (I usually use turkey), brown the meat first, then dust with a little flour, and stir to combine. Add 3 tbsp per 1 lb ground meat, stir to combine, add ¼ - ½ cup water, and stir again. Wait 1-2 minutes, and reduce heat to low to keep warm. Sauce will thicken up while you’re finishing other sides or warming tortillas. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This has been my go to recipe for about 5 years.
I give this to our friends that have tried some of my dishes that I use this in and they now use it instead of the packages.
I make up a small jar and keep it on hand.

Everyone really liked this. I did double the garlic and onion powders, because we like those flavors. For the paprika I used half regular and half smoked.  I made a double batch to have extra on hand. As suggested by another reviewer, I used 3T for a pound of meat, plus 1/2T flour and 2/3-1c water. In my first try, I had a cubanelle pepper to use, so I chopped and cooked it with the ground beef; it added a really nice taste.

My new go-to taco seasoning. Love the kick! I took previous reviewers' advice and used 3 Tb per lb of meat plus 1 Tb of flour and 1/2 c water. Highly recommend!

I didn't want to keep buying the little packets of taco seasoning so turned to allrecipes.  This was what I have tried so far and I like it.  It tasted like store bought, and best of all, I had all the ingredients at hand.  I won't be buying anymore taco seasoning from now on.

I omit the salt for blood pressure reasons and Hubby says it's too spicy with the red pepper flakes. I would try cutting back a little on them but still too spicy for us,  so now I omit that too. I keep this on my fridge so it's handy and it's ingredients that you already have in your pantry.

I didn't have all of the ingredients so I used the chilli flakes , onion powder ,  real minced garlic 1 1/8 teaspoon per pound, some medium salsa, pepper and cumin. I have to say this turned out amazing I didn't add any water because I used the salsa. It tasted fresh and I won't ever go back to packs.

Love it I use 2 Tbsp per pound of meat, tried less and tried more but for me that's the sweet spot.  

In my tacos I add about 2 Tbsp of mild salsa for an extra kick, prior to this seasoning I used store bought pouches and also added hot sauce for flavor.  

This mixture has more 'hotness' so I no longer need the hot sauce.

I made this and LOVED it! The only thing I did wrong was take someone else's advice and add some brown sugar--I didn't like it! The addition of brown sugar made it too sweet for me. Thank goodness I didn't add the sugar to my batch. I made 3X the amount and put it in an old "creamed horseradish jar." SUPERB BLEND!!! Thank you for Sharing!

Cooked with almost 2lbs of minced meat and used entire taco recipe.  Traditionally I don't measure to exact but utilized my kitchen tools this recipe. Came out great. Used cayenne pepper because that's what I had. Will make again!

Have been using this recipe for years now, and we love it. I first made it when we were planning on having tacos for dinner and I discovered we were out of seasoning. Never realized how easy it was to make, or that I already had all the spices in my pantry! I slightly reduce the pepper to suit our tastes. Haven't used store-bought in ages.

This is the best taco seasoning ever! Way better than the stuff that comes in the pack. It makes the perfect amount for seasoning a pound of ground beef. I followed the recipe exactly- don't change a thing.

Taking a pic doesn't do justice to the aroma. I use Turkish cumin and Hungarian paprika. You'll never go back to packets.

Love this. We triple or quadruple the recipe, so we always have some on hand.  This is great in beef for my husband, and tofu or black beans for me.  We add cornstarch, as others suggested, but it's a 5 star recipe on its own.

Excellent mix.  Use this over store bought, and can adjust the seasonings to your liking, and since hubby is on a very low sodium diet, I use little to no salt.  I always make up lots extra, so I do not have to remake it so often.  Thanks for the great mix recipe.

I made this according to the recipe and it turned out fantastic! I may have added a TEENY bit more salt after the fact but the exact mix recipe gives wonderful flavors. Mixes in beautifully and isn't too spicy for little mouths. Thank you for posting! This will be my go to mix recipe instead of using the prepackaged junk they sell at stores.

This is just as if not better than the store bought stuff, and probably way cheaper because if you cook a lot you probably have most of it on hand. And if you have to go out and buy anything you can make up a big batch and store it. Taco seasoning is good on more than just tacos! I cut down on the red pepper flakes, in fact when I store it I don't even add the flakes and just add them when I make whatever I'm using the seasoning on. 3tbs to 1lb of meat and 2/3 cup water. It is a little thinner than store bought so I just added a small amount of flour (couple teaspoons) and it thickened right up! Very very good! Best part is you can tweak the taste to however you like!

Super easy - you probably have most of the ingredients already! This has heat.

I didn't have chili powder, of all things. Didn't miss it one bit. I am NOT a fan of those little packets sold in the store and would prefer to forego tacos all together if that were my only option. Thanks to this recipe, it is not!

Tough to beat being able to mix your taco seasoning that tastes better than any packet. I like to cut the salt in half and add a tsp of cornstarch, also double the whole recipe to fill a tall empty spice jar to save time for the next taco night.

I have been making this seasoning for a few years now. I usually make 2-3 batches at once and save it in a jar for later. The only change I make is to add 1 beef bouillon cube to each batch (1 cube per serving that I am making). 

I add a tablespoon of flour to the meat after draining, then add the seasoning and let it cook for about a minute before adding the water.   So good!

I have been making my own taco season for a while and I could tell it was missing something. Now I know it was oregano. I don't use the red pepper due to we don't like the heat. To me this is better than store bought because one the flavor is better two you don't have the extra ingredients of preservates they have in them.

I add flour to mine also. I make a big batch of this. This way I always have it on hand. Very heart healthy. I add nusalt to mine. Which works out great, for people who have to watch their salt intakes.

Love it! Have been using it for years. I always make 4x the recipe and have it on hand.  Love that I can use this in recipes and not worry about my loved ones, who have food sensitivities and allergies. There is milk, wheat,  corn, and soy in the stuff on the market, plus anti-caking and other chemicals we just don't need.  The taste is just like the packets. You get the yummy spices and nothing else. Perfect! Thanks, Bill!

Loved this seasoning and I use it for everything. I ran out of a couple ingredients and had to resort to store bought. My SO said, "this is so bland, this isn't yours".  No need to ever buy store bought again.

Great stuff! I left out salt for hubby's low sodium diet, and it is still great. Upping servings to 40 allows you to make a larger batch with even measures. I used cumin for red peppers. That was good too. It is easy to experiment and get to taste. Of course, I did that before making the 40 servings.

I used this when I was living overseas and now it's my go-to taco seasoning. I make it small batches. One time, I used habanero chili powder. Oops! This and water is more than enough to season the beef. No flour or other extraneous ingredients necessary. Thank you for this recipe!!!!!!

I tried this recipe about a year ago and haven't used store bought taco seasoning since.  It is really good.  I substitute fresh garlic for the powder.  After I brown the meat, I add the seasoning mix with about 1/2 cup of water and let it simmer until the water is gone.

Absolutely love this blend. I love to double it and add some extra chili powders (ancho, chipotle) and smoked paprika. Haven't bought on store bought taco seasoning in forever.

I used this with ground chicken and my family thought they were the best tacos ever! So much better than the packets. Like other reviewers I added water (3/4 cup), brought to a boil then simmered. I am going to rework the amount of spicy ingredients a little because it was a bit hot for me but I will definitely not be getting any more taco seasoning packets, thank you for recipe!!

Excellent!  I talked the kids into trying it sans the spicy flakes and they've been making it with me for the past three months.  Taco night is a weekly installation  where they quickly hand me out triple batch bottle of this  recipe.  It goes well with ground elk, bison, and beef.

I triple this recipe every time I make it, except  to the salt and pepper are only doubled and the onion powder and garlic powder are quadrupled. It's simple, quick, delicious, and far better than any packaged seasoning.  My kids love it!!! It's great for shredded chicken or beef.  To thicken with beef, I add about 1 tbsp of cornstarch to 3 tbsp of the seasoning and basically use the same directions as "the packaged stuff."  Awesome stuff!!!

This is my go to for taco seasoning mix. Better than anything you’ll buy in a store. I adjust servings to 100 and keep it in an airtight 26 oz jar so I always have plenty on hand. Changes I’ve made are no salt added; I like to salt to taste when done. I use ground cayenne pepper instead of flakes this gives me a medium hot to hot flavor . Yes, I like my tacos spicy!!

This is the only taco seasoning we use.  I make enough for 16 servings and store in a parm cheese shaker. Use 3T seasoning per lb of meat and 2/3 cup water.

Just made this. Delicious! However it wasn't spicy enough for me so I kept adding more until it was perfect. Didn't have oregano so used parsley instead and added a pinch of cayenne pepper. And, to make it more healthy, I used ground turkey! Turkey taco salad!

This was delightful! I tweaked it like a few others did, adding more onion powder, garlic powder, and a touch of cayenne pepper. It was a big hit in my house with 3 boys! I will definitely never buy pre seasoned taco meat again. It was so easy! Thank you for sharing.

Very good for a low carb lifestyle.  I love that I know what's going into this seasoning mix.  I make a large batch, and store it in the pantry.  I've shared this recipe with many people.   Many thanks!!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  It is so yummy and keeps very well.  Of course, we use it so much that it doesn't keep for very long!  Both my husband and I have an allergy to coriander and finding a recipe that doesn't use it is hard to find, so double thanks for the great taste and great ingredients.  We didn't have to change a thing!

Very good and much healthier than the packaged stuff! I hit it a little heavier with the chili powder and added it to ground turkey for mexi wraps! Whole wheat tortilla's, lettuce, fresh tomatoes chopped, sour cream, salsa, cheddar! 
Hit in this house!

Was making tacos and was out of packets. Made this as an emergency fix. What a delightful surprise!!  I echo the comments about it being so much better than the packets, also quick and easy. I didn't have onion powder so tossed on 1/2 onion to sauté with the meat. Delicious.

Never buy taco seasoning mix in the package again. This is the best! I always quadruple the recipe and pour into a relabeled empty seasoning jar so I always have it on hand. Love, love, love it!

My husband gets horrible heartburn so I leave out the chilli powder and it doesn't bother him. It still tastes great. I make this in large quantities and store it. I always add some to the meat as its cooking and then at the end. It's great to control the flavor. Also add some to Spanish rice when you cook it, it's great.

I used the entire recipe for two pounds of meat (one pound of turkey and one pound of ground beef) for our taco night and it was PERFECT!!  The perfect amount and the perfect taste!  I browned the meats, drained the fat, and then added about 1/2c of water and all the spice mix and it was just wonderful!  I was skeptical, but I really couldn't taste the difference between this and the chemical and preservative laden spice packets.  DEFINITE KEEPER!!

Super, quick & easy recipe -- 100% better than those awful store-bought packs!  Since finding this some years ago, it's the only thing I use for tacos or any recipe calling for "a pack of taco seasoning". As written it's exactly the right amount of seasoning for 1 lb. of meat.  I've always substituted cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes, kosher salt for the sea salt, and skipped the black pepper -- it's perfect.

This is all I use now for tacos or fajitas. This last time I substituted cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes as someone else suggested. It mixes more evenly than the flakes.

How I ever used store bought seasoning before I'll never know. This is so much better than any packet out there! I keep a triple batch ready to use anytime. It's great on beef, chicken and turkey. Although, I think shredded chicken thighs are the best. I haven't tried pork yet. The first time I made it for a birthday party taco bar and everyone raves about it, which is why there was so little leftover. I followed the recipe exactly, but found it a little too spicy and salty. I've since omitted the crushed red pepper and halved the salt. Works for our family. I usually triple it and always make sure to have it on hand. I also add diced tomatoes, black beans and frozen corn. It adds great flavor and doubles a pound of meat easily. Don't buy packets! It takes no time and is so much better! It wasn't in the recipe, but I found 3 tbsp. per pound of meat with all the extrasworks well.

I have used this recipe numerous times and I absolutely love it!  We will never go back to the packaged mix again.  I use the entire amount listed in the recipe for one pound of ground beef and the flavor is wonderful.  The only slight tweak I make is using 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes only because that's what I have on-hand and we don't like things too spicy.  I also add 2 tsp. of cornstarch to the dry spices to help everything thicken up while cooking.  I add the spice/cornstarch mixture to one pound of browned, well-drained ground beef and then add 2/3 C of water.  Bring it to a simmer for a few minutes and voila!  Best tasting tacos EVER!  Thank you for the recipe!

I decided to make tacos at the last minute and it turns out I had everything except the taco seasoning.  I jumped on this site and arrived at this 'recipe' and am I glad I did!  I will never buy packaged taco seasoning again.  I made it exactly as stated (except for onion powder since I didn't have that) and based on another review only added about 3/4 cup of water to my browned beef.

I love the fact my family is not consuming processed taco seasoning with this recipe.  I currently have a teenager who is vegetarian, a spouse who is on Atkins, and a elementary age kid who cannot handle spicy.  Yet, I add this to refried pinto beans and also ground turkey.  The Atkins dieter slaps all the nacho/taco turkey fixings on a low carb tortilla and he's pleased.  The vegetarian puts this on the refried beans and nachos and she's pleased.  The smaller kid puts it all together and EVERYONE'S HAPPY and eating healthier as a family!!  Thanks for sharing this.

We loved this! I used cayenne instead of the red  pepper flakes and used basil instead of oregano bc that's what I had. I use taco seasoning a lot for various recipes and I'm not use I'll ever use packets again. No MSG here and also no gluten. Very good!

Just like everyone says... No reason to buy packets any more! This was very good.  I add some home made salsa to the meat because it's the only way to get fresh veggies in some of my family members. Tomato sauce is a good way to thicken it up, too.

I really liked this recipe. Its a bit spicy so if you don't like that I would decrease the amout of pepper flakes or just omit them. I browned my beef than added about 3 TBSP of the recipe. After about a couple of minutes, I added about 1/2C water and let that simmer down. With store bought taco seasonings, I would have to add Ghost pepper salsa to my tacos but I didn't even use it on these tacos. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I added it to some ground beef before using it as enchilada filling and it turned out great. It was a little spicy for the kids at the table, but they still loved it and finished it. I will definitely be using this instead of regular seasoning from now on. I did use the following ratios: added 1/2 tbsp flour to the mix, used 3 tbsp per pound of meat, simmered with 2/3 cups water per pound of meat.

This is the only seasonings I use for tacos or most any Mexican dish. Even use this when making Hamburgers. Easy and adjustable to your tastebuds.

My husband and I can't have much salt so store bought stuff is horrible for us, makes us both really sick.  This recipe is great!  Of course, we cut the salt but the rest is perfect!  I set the serving size to 160 and make a bunch of it all at once.

This had great flavor but way too much salt,  the chili powder has salt already so the added salt wasn't necessary. I also added 1/4 cup of water and simmered it down a little. I wouldn't mind a little more heat but overall very good

Excellent recipe! I use cayenne pepper in place of the flakes and a little less of it (and I like heat). I also cut back on the black pepper and salt. You can always add more of anything if you find you need them later. I whip this up and always keep some on hand. So much better and fresher than the stuff from the stores. A winner! Thanks Bill!

Abso-freaking-lutely amazing! I add in a couple shakes of cayenne pepper because spices, and when I'm making tacos I add this to a browned pound of ground turkey and 1/4 of an onion. I let it simmer for a while and add water if I need to!

Excellent flavor AND so much less sodium than seasoning packets. I eliminate the salt altogether and double the other spices for 1.5 lbs of meat.  It's cheaper than seasoning packets, too!

This is the best taco seasoning mix I have ever tasted. I have to avoid msg and thus I avoid most package mixes. I use this mix for tortilla soup, tacos, seven layer bean dip, with Greek yogurt as a dip, in fresh salsa, in chilli, with beans and rice and even in scrambled eggs. I increase the serving size to 80 so that I always have it on hand. Everyone loves it. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe, Bill.  I just put some in the slower cooker with some chicken breasts and a batch of my fresh salsa. Wow, it smells so good.

This is so good! Thankfully others mentioned how much water to add so that helped. Because of bad reactions to MSG, I couldn't buy the packets. So thankful I found this recipe. Will def use it from now on.

This seasoning is perfect! Used it to make the Taco Casserole (also on this site) and it was superb! Wouldn't change a thing! I doubt I'll buy the seasoning packs from the store again either. Why would you? It's so easy and tastes better! :)

I will never buy prepacked taco seasoning again! This recipe is great! I make a larger batch and store it in my spice drawer. It is for sure on the spicier side so if you don't like that as much I'd suggest cutting down on the red pepper flakes.

This was fine in a pinch, definitely on the side of the hot seasoning, not the mild.  Something is missing though so I won't be making up a big batch.  I will rely on the good old packages from  the store.

We've been experimenting with many seasoning mixes for my sons upcoming 18th birthday party (Mexican theme) and this one is clearly the winner!  Tonight I made Ground Chicken Tacos and they were FANTASTIC!  The only change I will make for the party is use less of the crushed red pepper.  We love spicy, but for a party it might be too strong.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

excellent seasoning recipe! I discovered I was out of packaged seasoning one day so I went searching for a DIY recipe. I am so glad I was out of seasoning that day, because this the only seasoning I use now! 
I do add beef or chicken bouillon, and some cornstarch if I'm using it for tacos. But I have also used this for baked taco seasoned chicken as is and it was perfect.

Made exactly as written, plus 1 tsp of nacho cheese popcorn seasoning. I like the cheesy taco seasonings you can buy, so this was perfect. Soo yummy!

Very good! Great use of spices. I did find it slightly salty, so I will probably cut back on that a touch next time I make it. But this is great and so much more flavorful than what you get in a packet!

Love this seasoning! I add as much or as little as I need. Mix a triple or quadruple batch in a mason jar and keep it handy.

I haven't been able to enjoy tacos in years due to a sensitive stomach that suddenly started reacting to the package mix while I was pregnant with my son. I tried this recipe on a whim just to see if it made a difference. I left out the red pepper flakes and added a teaspoon of corn starch to give it more of a sauce like consistency like you get from the packets. 
It turned out absolutely perfect and didn't upset my stomach. Thank you for giving me back my Taco Tuesdays!

Excellent taco seasoning!  I first made this about a year ago, when i realized too late that I didn't have any packets on hand.  Was so good that I now make it in 50 serving increments to keep on hand (thanks Allrecipes for making that easy to do!).  Like some other reviewers, I leave out the red pepper flakes, and also leave out the onion powder, adding in freshly cut but frozen onions that I keep in the freezer.  For an added nutritional boost I use Boulder Salt in place of the sea salt.

Love this recipe! Make it exactly as shown and its a hit every time. Made it for Christmas presents this year. I layered the ingredients like sand art, 172 servings fits a pint and a half (24oz) Ball jar perfectly with room left to shake/mix it.

Used this recipe tonight. Forgot to buy the usual seasoning packets and decided to look up a quick recipe and give it a try. This was excellent! Came out better than expected. I didn't have red pepper though and used a tiny bit of cayenne instead...fabulous. My children loved it and that's saying a lot!

This was the best Taco seasoning we have ever had. I followed other viewers advise by cutting the cumin to only 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tablespoon of fresh milled flour,  2/3 cups of water and 1 beef bouillon. WOW, absolutely wonderful recipe. We won't buy store bought Taco seasoning any more!

A great standard seasoning mixture, I used the entire recipe mixed with 1lb browned and drained beef, added 2 Tsp cornstarch (pre-mixed with 2 Tbsp cold water) and brought it to a boil and then simmered until thickened. Made for great soft tacos!

This recipe was fantastic. I only used 1/2 of the salt as I used table salt instead of sea salt and could even go with a little less. Then I added 1/2 TBS flour like another review said, and mixed it all together. I browned 1 lb ground beef, then added 3 TBS of the mix with 2/3 C water. It cooked up perfectly; just like the packets only better. No more packets for our family!! This was a HIT.

Perfect, eyeballed most of it and it made the meat taste just like I had used a taco seasoning packet for 1/10th of the cost, if that. Used 2/3rds cup water

Great recipe. I really liked it a lot! I used this for my slow cooker chicken taco soup. I substituted the salt with season salt though and I added a bit more garlic. Since I don't like spicy things, I kept the red pepper flakes but omitted the pepper. However, after the fact I think I could have handled the pepper after all. It was still very good though. Bravo.

The best taco seasoning ever! You wouldn't believe how bland store bought seasoning is until you've tried this. I can't even stand the thought of not using homemade since I've made my own. I don't change too much, I just halve the cumin because of the taste and the crushed red pepper so that it isn't too spicy

Make this ~ use this ~ you will NEVER buy package taco seasoning again.  It is super easy and tastes so much better than the package.  I do sprinkle it over my meat and add about 2/3 cup water and let it simmer (like packaged).  Great seasoning!

Quick & easy to toss together when I realized I didn't have any of the pre-packaged kind in my cupboard. Won't buy pre-packaged anymore, though! This had a deep, rich flavor with my chicken and the right "kick" my 9 year old son was looking for. Gobbled it all up!

This is my go to taco seasoning recipe.  I don't buy packaged seasoning anymore!  I usually use ground red pepper instead of the large flakes, because I have kids and they would not like if they bit into a big piece of hot pepper.  I use about 1/8 t of it, and sub the water with blended stewed tomatoes.  It's so good!

Just as good if not better than any packet we've ever purchased. Added the 1.5 tsp of flour and 2/3 cup of water like other reviews suggested and turned out great!  Increase the red pepper if u want it hotter.

We all loved it! Didn't use quite as much black pepper or the red pepper flakes and it was perfect for my non-spicy kids. (Added them for me though and loved it!)

This is my go to recipe for taco seasoning.  It's so easy to put together that I don't worry about stocking taco seasoning in addition to the spices I already have.  Do add water to the ground beef after adding the seasoning to let it cover and cook in better.

I thought it was perfect. Use more if you like it spicy, less if you like it spiced. I used about a half tablespoon for a half pound of meat and it was delicious to me and my roomie.

I make this all the time and quadruple the recipe! Everyone loves my mexican food and this seasoning is usually snuck in there somewhere whether it's taco filling, burritos, or even dips. Perfect seasoning and way cheaper than those packets.

I made this without salt for a low sodium alternative, and minus the paprika. Personally, I love how it turned out. I made enough to last a while also.

We love this!  I make it in large batches and store it in an air-tight container so that I can just use what I want for my recipe.  I have used this in ground beef, with chicken for fajitas, in chicken taco soup, pretty much any recipe that calls for taco seasoning.  I make it without the crushed red pepper flakes, too hot for my 5-year-old, but still so good without them.

This recipe is a bit too spicy and salty for our tastes but it still gets five stars because it's so easy to adjust. After making it a few times I finally cut the chili powder by 1 teaspoon, the salt by half a teaspoon, and the black pepper by half a teaspoon. It's so easy to make a big batch--I quadruple it to keep it on hand. A really nice combination of herbs and seasonings that's useful for many dishes!

This was the best.  I will never buy taco seasoning again.  I added two tsps of flour and 2/3 cup of water.  It was spicy initially but once it cooled the hot flavor went away.  I used 3 tablespoons as suggested by others to my ground turkey.    I didn't have any dried oregano but it was still delicious.  I may cut this salt in half net time but it wasn't salty at all.  It was the perfect flavor.

Great recipe. I had to stop using commercial seasoning because they all contained whey and I have a milk allergy (in addition to gluten allergy).  I used 2 Tbsp of seasoning per pound of meat and added some potato starch to thicken.

Yes, so easy and tasty. I love that it's something I can throw together with ingredients I have on hand. I also like that I can alter the amount of salt to accommodate my needs unlike those salt loaded taco seasoning packets!

Not only did I have everything available in my spice rack to make this at a moments notice, it took all of 2 minutes to actually measure and mix the recipe.  I used it with ground turkey and it tasted great. My husband doesn't like spicy foods so I omitted the red pepper flakes and we didn't miss it one bit. Loved it!

Glad I found this! It seems every taco seasoning out there has MSG or cleverly disguises it as "spices", and with a severe MSG allergy (gives me seizures), I can't afford to chance it.  Substituting a small amount of Cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes worked out really well, also. Thanks so much!

This is great.  I did slightly decrease the red pepper flakes and used about 2 Tbs. per pound of meat.  All of my kids loved it which is a bonus!  This recipe is also easy to make a bunch at one time to store for easy future use.

i like how easy this is to prepare and to double or triple the recipe to save in the spice cupboard. no doubt this will be my go to… especially since most boughten taco seasoning has gluten in it, this one is easy and can be made gluten free!

very good. I had my doubts when I was cooking it, I didn't think it smelled enough of that lovely taco smell but then I tasted it and I loved it. I added a little extra garlic, onion and chili powder. It was perfect.

i can't believe I haven't rated this yet!!!!!!!!!  This is my go-to taco seasoning.  No need to buy the stuff in the store, everyone has all the ingredients to make this!  The only thing I omit is the black pepper because that isn't very "Mexican" I don't think!

Have made this twice now and I love it. Only modifications (per others' suggestions): add 1/2 tsp flour to mix and 1/2 - 2/3 cup water to meat after sprinkling seasoning on. Thanks to OP and reviewers.

This recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS! The spices are flavorful, but not overwhelming, just the way I like my taco seasoning! I like how there is a hint of spice in the mix as well. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

So GLAD I found this!  I only omitted the Cumin, but followed the rest as written.  The entire family loved it!  I drained the beef of fat and added water and seasonings, then thickened with a bit of flour and water.  Just perfect!

No need to ever buy packets of taco seasoning again. This is great. I did take the advice of others and doubled the chili powder.  I now make this in bulk and keep a container of it so I have it handy for all my mexican dishes that call for taco flavored meat.

I've tried several different taco seasoning recipes BUT this is the only one I now use. I absolutely love the flavor, however the only thing I did different was I used dried minced onions instead of onion power, also I added about 1-2 TBSP of flour to thicken it up some. So happy to have found this recipe, will never buy packaged again. I served this over Mexican rice, topped with chopped black olives, tomatoes and a little sour cream...DELISH!!

Mixed this mildly hot taco seasoning into a little mayonnaise and tossed some chicken chunks into it.  Used this mixture in soft tacos with lettuce and tomato and a bit of sour cream.  Family loved it.

I will never, ever again buy packaged taco seasoning.  I had every ingredient on hand and made a quadruple batch so I'd have it on hand when needed.  I didn't change a thing and I won't miss that preservative taste that packaged seasonings have.

Perfection!  I made four times the amount and have it stored.   One thing I added was 1 tsp corn starch diluted in 1/2 cup cold water and added at the end to thicken it up.   I use grass fed beef so it is very lean and quite dry so this added some moisture.

I'm not a fan of taco mix from the store, this one however is the perfect blend.  It takes the guess work out of standing at the stove, tasting your dinner and trying to figure out what you are missing.

I skipped the red pepper flakes because I don't like hot and spicy food. It took too much tweaking and adding to make this even come close to taking good to give it a higher review. I had high hopes for this but I was disappointed with the outcome.

I'm definitely keeping this recipe! It was easy to throw together when I realized I didn't have any taco seasoning. I made this for chicken tacos, and I only used a pound of chicken breasts, so I halved the recipe. That being said, instead of using 1/8 tsp of garlic and onion powder, I used 1/2 tsp of each. If you like it a bit spicier, maybe double the red chili flakes :)

Excellent! No need to buy the packets again! I didn't have the red pepper flakes so I just skipped that one. Only thing I would change is just slightly less salt. So easy my 3 year old helped make it and she loved it too!

Wonderful recipe!  I made the following changes, I tripled all ingredients!

I add about 3 tablespoons to a pound of browned ground beef after draining. Then I add a tablespoon of olive oil to the meat to spread the  flavor. 

I use this seasoning in many dishs!

Thanks Bill!

Loved this.  I left out the pepper flakes  because my kids do not like spicy.  I added 2 heaping tablespoons  per pound of meat along with 1 tablespoon of flour and 2/3 c. Of water and simmered for about 5 mins.   Love it!

Quick, fresh and tasty!  Added 1 teaspoon flour, you'll see why and used only 1 teaspoon cumin.  Used entire recipe for 1 pound ground beef plus 2/3 cup water.  PERFECT!

Like everyone else has said this is fantastic. I did as a previous woman suggested and browned the beef, drained off the fat then used 3 tablespoons per lb of beef plus 2/3 cup of water per lb. I also eyeballed the amount of floor I used then let it simmer. Soooo much better than the pre packaged stuff. It's definitely spicier but in my family that always a good thing! Thanks for sharing I'll never go back to the other kind again!

I reduced the chili pepper and red pepper flakes because my kids found it a bit spicy, but I loved it and much prefer it over the store bought kind with artificial ingredients. To 1 lb ground turkey or beef, I add 1 T flour and about 1 cup of water, bring to a boil and let simmer while I cook the tortillas

After reading the ingredients on a commercial package of taco seasoning, I decided to make this.  Very healthy unlike the commercial seasoning mix.  I tripled the recipe so I'd have some already made for the next time I need it.

Very good.I had all the spices on hand.  Didn't add  red pepper flakes, personal preference. Also, cut back on salt and pepper. (The package mixes have way too much salt for me.) I also added some cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken up the consistency. I would definitely recommend.

I really liked it as is, but to make it even better, I added a little bit of flour (1 tsp) to it for thickening and 1/4 tsp of ground Coriander. After those edits, the finished product was definitely a 5-star for me! :D

I didn't have a taco seasoning packet, and I was making tacos. I tried this recipe because so many people say they use it. I doubled the recipe only changes I made were to cut the sea salt and red pepper flakes in half. I thought it was OK, but it was still too hot for what I was making for my son. I had to rinse out his ground beef and start over with something else.

I love spicy food -- but this was little flavor and lots of heat. Tasted way too much of chili powder and not enough of other flavorings.

Here was my husbands first words after taking a bite of his tacos tonight... "Honey, did you use a packet to season this?"  I said no. His response was "Holy Cow!!! This is Awesome! It's better than a packet!"  I've always wanted to make home made seasoning but he never wanted be to. He forgot to get seasoning at the store this week, so I took the chance. It was worth it! Thanks!

Easy, uses spices in the pantry, and does the job tastefully. I always buy taco seasoning (and nearly all my seasonings) from a farmers' mkt and it is way cheaper than the prepackaged stuff. This is great when I run out or just want to make my own.

I have used this recipe over and over again.  I will never buy the packaged stuff again.  I had a taco bar for my birthday party and used this seasoning with lean ground turkey (97% fat free)…everyone loved it and they didn't mind it was turkey.  This will be repeated next year!  I also add 1 tsp of corn starch per batch.  It helps it adhere to the meat and keeps from clumping in storage.

I lost my Lawry's packets somewhere between the store and home. This recipe saved dinner! I had to do the math with the help of some comments (we were cooking 4# of meat). I ran out of chili powder so it was a tablespoon short and used 1 tbsp red pepper flakes and 2 tbsp cayenne pepper. Wasn't too spicy and the kids loved it!

Honestly, this recipe is definitely not as good as the taco seasoning packets you buy at the store. It lacks zest and tastes bland. I made it exactly as the recipe said. But it works if you are in a pinch.

Love this! I hate buying pre-made mixes that have a bunch of additives and unnecessary junk in them so this is a great DIY. I am a cumin lover so I add about 2 tablespoons of that but that is my only change.  Lately I have been just throwing some chicken in the crockpot and covering it with this mixture and cooking it for 4 hours on high or 8 on low then shredding it for chicken tacos.   It comes out CRAZY GOOD!!  I also use the chicken for taco or burrito "bowls".  I have used both boneless/skinless breast and thighs and I think for this particular recipe the thighs come out on top.

This taco seasoning is so good!  It tastes just like the taco packets, even better and spicier.  I really like knowing what I am putting in my food with this recipe, rather than a mystery packet.  Plus you can easily adjust for more spice.  I used the whole amount for 1 lb. of ground beef, and added 2/3 cup water, then simmered.  Very delicious!  I will be using this taco seasoning recipe from now on!

This recipe was entirely to spicy for me and my family. I omitted the red pepper flakes and after it was cooked and found it still to spicy, I added more paprika and cooked  some diced potatoes in with the seasoning and a bit more water until the potatoes were done. Even then it was so hot that I couldn't taste anything else...and I live in New Mexico and am quite used to eating spicy Mexican food. I will not make this again. The leftovers weren't even suitable for my dogs unless I wanted to be cleaning up vomit and diarrhea...all because of the heat factor. I know this recipe has gotten a lot of great reviews, and to each his own, but beware of the heat. Perhaps make it without any red pepper or cayenne, then add those to taste, not by following the recipe.

I started making this a while back in my effort to eat healthier and avoid pre-packaged foods. Though at first I thought it was not spicy enough, the last time I made it I used Ancho Chili Powder and Mexican Oregano....mmmmm! Much Better that way and now the ONLY way I will make it. Love having this on hand.

Great recipe! I will be using this instead of the packets from now on.  So easy and no msg so I love that.  Perfectly spicy for my husband and me who do like spicy food.  I used the whole amount for seasoning a 1.3 lb package of ground organic beef.

So easy and tastes just like packaged taco seasoning, but without all the fake ingredients! Never buying taco seasoning again. I used this in my taco stew.

This was great! I was afraid that it might be a little too spicy hot for my mother-in-law who doesn't like hot spicy food. She loved it. Next time I think I'll up the cumin by a 1/2 teaspoon.

Excellent.  I put extra garlic, onion powder, and red pepper flakes because that is what my family likes in everything.  I made a huge batch and keep it in a jar in my spice cabinet so I always have some on hand.

Just made this.  Like others I started cooking and had no taco mix.  This is the best ever.  Very simple and tastes great.  I will never by store bought again.

Perfect replacement when you don't have a taco seasoning packet...and maybe from now on I will just do this! 
I used 1/2 tsp of garlic & onion powder and substituted Lawrey's seasoning salt for sea salt.  I added this whole mix and 1/2 cup water to my 1lb of browned beef....turned out just like a packet!

This recipe is wonderful. I will never buy the taco seasoning packets again.  This mixture was much better and far less salty with a little more kick to it. I even put this in the family recipe book!  Great job!

I just tried this tonight because I forgot to buy the pre packaged stuff tonight. I had everything in my spice cabinet except the onion powder and red pepper flakes. I substituted some adobo for the salt and onion powder and added some ground peppers i grilled and peeled directly to the meat. My friends RAVED over the meat. I have to say, I will never ever buy a package again. It tasted incredible and made seem so amazingly fresh, like an authentic Mexican dish. Owning a very successful restaurant for over 20 years, it takes a lot to impress me with a new recipe. This truly did. Congrats to whomever came up with this one. A big fan here.

Excellent flavor...much better than the packets from the store. Just need to make big batches to have it on hand. 2 tablespoons seasoning mix mixed with 1/2 tablespoon flour sprinkled over the browned meat and some onion...add 2/3 cup water...stir well and let simmer.

I found myself with taco plans and no seasoning packs. Rather than run to the store I googled "taco seasoning" and found this recipe. I had all the ingredients and doubled it for 3 lbs. of ground beef. I did not add flour as I'm on a wheat free diet. We could tell as soon as the spices and water were simmering that it was going to be delicious. Not just the smell, but we couldn't resist tasters while the liquid cooked down. I truthfully don't believe I'll use packaged taco seasoning again, this was just way too easy, convenient and delicious! Thanks!

So, so, so good! This is how restaurants' taco meat tastes. I made 1/2 a recipe and substituted a little cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes. This made enough for one pound ground beef.

This is the only taco seasoning I use.  I love its versatility and the fact that I control the ingredients.  I always have a triple batch made on hand to use and share with the neighbors. They love it as much add I do.

I didn't have any taco seasoning packets on hand, so I just looked up a recipe for taco seasoning and saw the five-star rating for this one and decided to give it a try.  Now, I won't buy any more expensive packets.  This was awesome.  I doubled the recipe, and the only change I made was that I used ground cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, so I only used about 1/4 tsp. but you can adjust accordingly.  I used all of what I made with 1.25 lb. of browned ground beef, added about half a cup of water, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, and it was simply delicious!  It's so much better than the packet seasoning mix (and probably better for you, too), and most of us probably have all of these ingredients in their pantry--I did.  Thanks for sharing.

Definitely a keeper. Used regular salt and reduced it to 1/2 tsp. Added less than 1 tbsp of flour, mixed with about 3/4 cup cold water and poured over on chicken that I had cooked with a tad of oil. Let it boil for a couple of minutes to thicken. It was delicious! Will make a large batch and put in a jar to have on hand. Cheaper, better, and more fun than the packets from the store.

Great mix! A little spicy for my kids, but perfect amount of heat for me.

Update:09-10-2014

Ever since I found this recipe, I no longer buy the store bought seasonings loaded with MSG anymore. I just triple the recipe and store it so I have it on hand:) Wish I could give it 10 stars!!!

Quick and easy to make! I did, however, omit the red pepper flakes which made for a delicious mild taco seasoning.

We added a few dashes of cayenne instead of crushed red pepper, and half the amount of cumin.

Just tried this, seriously just ate it and said YUM! When trying any recipe, I typically decrease salt and pepper, not the hot peppers though because I know I love that flavor. So I seasoned my meat, tasted it and altered to my liking, like an intelligent person would do. All the people who want their tacos to taste like Taco Bell or Old El Paso are missing something. This seasoning is good but one must alter it to their liking. I added more cumin and added a special pepper that smell just too  good to be left out. I will make this in bulk and use again. Happy to be avoiding the  that is in the packets of seasoning.

Well, this was very tasty and more robust then packaged seasonings.  I like minimizing the additives in seasoning so it's fun to make my own mixes.  Not for sensitive palates but not ueber (auf deutsch)-spicy either.  very good!

As often as we eat Mexican-inspired dishes, this saves us money in the long run.  Also, you can customize it to your family's taste, i.e.  low salt, etc.

Nice! I added a bit of flour and water as one reviewer suggested and I also added more cumin for my personal taste.  Whole family ate it and we have a few Picky Pete's.  I feel  better not adding chemicals to our food.  Thank you Bill!

I use this recipe every time I make tacos and always get rave reviews.  Cut back on the red pepper flakes if your little ones don't like "spicy" and add some hot sauce if hubby likes it hot!  I use the full recipe amount for one-pound of ground beef/turkey and add it with 1/4 c water to simmer after meat is cooked through.

This is SO good! I cannot emphasize enough how delicious this recipe is. It tastes exactly like taco seasoning from the package but with less salt. Packaged seasoning tastes very salty to me. This recipe has all the flavor except the salt flavor. I will never buy packaged seasoning again!

I was in a hurry, I didn't know I was out of taco seasoning, so I didn't get a chance to read the reviews as well as I usually do. I did read a few though and took bits from each. 
I doubled the batch for 3 lbs of ground beef. I doubled all the ingredients except - I tripled the garlic, cut the salt and pepper down  a little and substituted cayenne pepper for the red pepper. I added some Better than Bouillon to the meat while it was cooking. I also mixed a little flour in a jar with water and poured that over it.
Turned out wonderful.

Excellent and so easy!  Used 3 Tbs of seasoning per 1 lb of beef.  Browned and drained the beef.  Added the seasoning and 3/4 cup of water, simmered for about 20 minutes.  Better than packaged taco seasoning.  I mixed up a bunch of this and keep it in the pantry so when I make tacos the seasoning is pre-made.

Always a winner!  I make it 8 oz. at a time, and store it in a mason jar, so that I can use it on everything. I do, however, use half the salt.

This is a handy recipe to have!  I browned a little over a pound of ground beef, and mixed in this entire batch with approx 3/4 cup water.  My husband loved it.  He said this made the best taco meat he's ever had.  Made exactly as written and would not change a thing.  I will continue to make this instead of buying packets.

The taco meat is cooking right now and my son is exclaiming that is smells awesome.  Easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Like others, I came searching for a recipe when I realized I did not have a packet on hand.  Won't be packets of seasoning in the future!

Used with ground turkey. Upped the salt and cumin a little. Added 1 T tomato paste. Instead of onion powder I grated onion to help moisten the turkey...about 2 T.

I liked the Homemade Taco Seasoning Mix (here on All Recipes) better. I think the proportions of spices sat better. I never get heartburn and this recipe gave me heartburn.

Love the recipe.  The only thing I will change next time is a lot less salt.  I guess i'm used to buying the low sodium seasoning packets, but the salt was very overpowering to me.  Going to make again tonight!

All I can say is WOW!  I have tried so many taco seasoning recipes.  They have all fallen short in one way or another.  But not this one.  It is perfect.  My husband didn't even realize it wasn't the package....he has always known in the past.  I was curious how much to use per pound.  Fortunately, another reviewer had already figured that out for me....3 tbl per pound and 2/3 cup water per pound.  I did add a little flour (I used whole wheat) when cooking to thicken up a little.  It was perfect!!  No sugar!  No chemicals! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I loved this recipe! I'm so glad to have found one that tastes even better than a seasoning packet, and is healthier. I also added dried garlic, and El Pato sauce to my meat, which adds a kick of spice and flavor. These were the best tacos I've ever made, thanks again!

Use this and make in big batches and place in empty spice jar. Better than any package!

I love making my own spice mixes, rather than buying the chemical laden prepackaged mixes available at the supermarket. This one was delicious! Adjust the red pepper flakes to taste as they pack some heat!

Perfect! As close to the packet flavor as you can get without actually being the packet, and so much better for you. I questioned adding the oregano- thought it might be overwhelming- but I did anyway because I am a firm believer in trying the recipe as written first, and it was fine.  This will be my "go to" taco seasoning recipe, no more store bought packets for me! Oh and I added the entire batch to 2lbs of ground turkey for a taco pasta bake. I like a lot of flavor though!

I followed the recipe exactly and doubled it, which was the perfect amount for 2 pounds of ground beef. This was a million times better than the packet I normally use. My husband said they were the best tacos he's ever had!

Family likes this way better than the packets that come with the taco kits.  After browning the beef and draining the fat, I like to toast the seasoning a little in the fry pan, and then I add 1/2 cup picante sauce and stir it all together, and simmer for couple minutes before serving.

This stuff is amazing. I make taco salad with turkey meat and eat it for lunch at work several times a week. I make this seasoning in bulk and use it every time. SO much better than store-bought packets. I'll never go back.

I gave this 5 stars because you can do a few slight tweaks to perfect it for your family. For my family, I reduced the pepper flakes by 1/2 and added a Tbs. of cornstarch to the mix. Used 1 Tbs. per 1/2 lb. of meat, then added some to the black beans I was preparing on the side. Since I am on a salt restricted diet, this was perfect because I could manage the sodium and know exactly how much I was eating. Thanks for this recipe, Bill. This recipe is putting tacos back into our regular rotation.

So quick and easy, and much better than store-bought.  The only change I made was adding 1 teaspoon of cornstarch - thickened up quite nicely.  I use it with a 1/2 pound of lean turkey and 1c of kidney beans for a healthier version of taco night!

This was so good and like everyone else that rated this, I will no longer buy the envelopes of seasoning mix. It's no big deal to measure this all out and also not worry if I seasoned my food well enough. Plus you always have the seasonings listed here in your cupboard. I think I will make myself a cup full and store it in a container. Thanks Bill!

I liked this taco seasoning. It was my first attempt at making a homemade version. It tastes different than the prepackaged kind, and after adjusting to it, I think that prefer the more authentic taste. I did add a beef bouillon, but that made it too salty. Next time, I might half the salt a keep the buillon.  I also added about 2/3 cup of water to the beef after it was browned.  It's so nice not to need the packages when I feel like making a taco salad! Thanks for a great recipe.

I was a little weary of making my own taco seasoning b/c I thought "How can it be just as good as packaged?" Well, let me tell you it's not.... It's BETTER than packaged. I followed the suggestions by FoodSlave on June 5,2006 which increased the garlic & onion & added beef bullion. I also added cornstarch as recommended by FoodSlave to help the seasoning adhere to the meat mixture. It was fantastic! I made a triple batch in a pint jar & will keep it on hand for my "go to" Taco Seasoning! Thanks!

This is the bomb, it blows away store-bought taco seasoning. I often add just a couple dashes bottled habanero sauce.

I have found so many uses for this recipe.  I'm very happy to have a cheaper and healthier alternative to the packets.  I put this in chili, season chicken and fish with it, put in Mexican chicken soup, rice, everything.  I even tried it in grits....do not try it in grits (duh).  

Just be sure not to pre-salt what you are making because the salt in this mix is strong enough on it's own.

I used this in my recipe for a taco dip!!!  I used hot Mexican chilli powder (in place of chilli powder)  and McCormick's 5 Firey Pepper Flakes instead of crushed red pepper flakes.  I mixed the dry mix with sour cream and spread it on a cookie sheet.  Then I use Ortega taco sauce and spread a generous layer of that on the sour cream mixure.  Next a layer of grated cheese your choice of what kind.  Share with nacho chips:)  LOVE IT!!!

This was great. I tossed this in my meat and it worked out perfectly. The spices were just right for my kids including red pepper flakes.

My entire family loves this. So much better than store bought. I make sure to add corn starch to make it thicker though.

Make a huge batch of this stuff and keep it handy!  It is liberating to be able to control the sodium level in foods, so I make this recipe without the salt (haven't missed it yet). To make the seasoning mix finer, I grind the red pepper flakes, which helps release the flavor.  We use about 1/4 cup per pound of ground beef and it tastes even better than the premixed packs at the store.  
If you really want to control your ingredients, make your own chili powder since most commercial blends use salt at a primary ingredient, I recommend the recipe at food.com.

This worked great! I added about 1/2 tsp cayenne for extra heat, and 1 tbs corn starch to thicken the sauce.

I made veggie tacos with diced mushrooms & zucchini. I sauteed the veggies with onion, garlic, & hot portugal pepper, then added a good 2/3rds of the taco seasoning and enough water to make a sauce (about 3/4 cup). Threw some kidney beans in and let it all simmer while I got toppings ready (tomatoes, lettuce, red pepper, cheddar cheese). 

The result was DELICIOUS. I'll never go back to the packaged stuff! Thanks!

So good! I followed the advice of others and reduced the salt; I used just 1/4 teaspoon.  I also omitted the red pepper because my family doesn't like things too spicy.  Delicious!

One more five star rating.  It's nice to be sure your taco seasoning doesn't have any strange preservatives in it.  I would imagine people would be thrilled to receive this as a gift. Great mix Bill, thanks.

Excellent seasoning... I didn't have sea salt so I used regular salt, no oregano so I left it out, and added some cayenne pepper.  I usually buy taco seasoning in bulk from Sam's Club (much cheaper in the long run than the little packets) but this is a solid substitute.

This recipe made my taco night a success.  While cooking the ground beef, I realized that I forgot to buy a taco seasoning packet.  I used this recipe and taco night was saved.  Forget the packets - this will now be my go-to recipe.

I like knowing what is in my food im eating so i like to make as much as i can from scratch. This has far less salt than the package stuff from the store and alot more kick. When i made it i added a 1/4 cup water to the browned ground beet and about 3 tbs of the mixture. It was still a bit dry so i added a chopped chipotle and 2 tbs adobo sauce. It had alot of heat and the texture was good.

Loved it! Althought I only used 1/2TB of chili powder because I read my measuring spoon wrong, but I loved it. I'll probably make it that way from now on. Super easy and who doesn't have these things in their spice cabinet already!

This is right on! So easy and quick to get together, and much better than the packets from the grocery store.

We love this recipe. No need to buy packets with flavor like this! We almost never have the crushed red pepper flakes, so I usually just add a bit of cayenne instead. Two tablespoons per pound of meat is plenty for us.

Use this all the time in place of store bought, since I have allergies to MSG. Very comparable in taste. Hubby says it's just fine: no need to buy the packaged kind.

Given how fantastic the reviews were, I was surprised by how unimpressed we were with this.  This is, however, more than likely simply due to our own preferences than to any flaw in the recipe, and if you are looking for something better than those taco seasoning packets from the grocery, this really IS a definite improvement!  While we will be sticking with our old taco seasoning recipe, it is always fun to try something new.  Thank you, Bill!

I can only echo other people, by saying forget the storebought packets! We like Taco salads, and that is the perfect seasoning for the meat! Don't have to worry about shelf life either, it doesn't stay there for very long!

This is great. The only thing I do different is to replace half the chili powder with chipotle chili powder. I like it that way.

Excellent!  I doubled the garlic and onion (used minced for both) and halved the salt.  Also, added in half a cube of chipotle seasoning (like a boullion cube, purchased in a Spanish market).  

Used a mortar and pestle to lightly grind everything up.  Coated some chicken strips with this, grilled them, served them over salad greens with some corn, shredded cheese, broken up taco shells, and Margarita dressing, from this site.  Yummm!!  Teens loved it, too.

This seasoning is very tasty, better than store bought. 
I'll never buy again since I also have to control my sodium intake. I just used cayenne instead of the red pepper flakes, again, thisis great!!!

Just tried this for the first time, and it was outstanding!   The only change I made was substituting about 1/8th of a tsp of cayenne pepper for the pepper flakes.  Thanks so much for posting this, Bill!   No more packets for me either!

Adds the flavors you're use to tasting at a Mexican restaurant. I used garlic salt, onion salt, omitted the sea salt and it taste delicious.

Dependable and all the ingredients were already in my pantry.  Smells so good and works with tacos better than the store brought brands.  A whole lot less sodium.

Used 1 batch for 1 lb beef. Used a little less salt, pepper, and cumin. Used about 1/16 tsp cayenne and it was good but too spicy for little kids. Followed suggestion of mixing in 1/2 Tbs flour, sprinkling over meat and adding 2/3 cup water.

This is a great combination of seasonings.  I think it is much healthier and tastier than the packaged kind and can be used in so many ways.  I will be using it frequently in the future!

This is really good, and it's now my go-to instead of packets.  
I give 4 stars only because I don't use it exactly as written.  I omitted the black pepper due to an allergy.  I also omitted the oregano after the first time, because I felt like it was an odd flavor to add to a Mexican dish.  Maybe not...but I associate oregano with Italian dishes.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Quick, easy, cheap and SO delicious. I especially like the mild bite added by the red pepper flakes.

This is a fantastic recipe, for a couple of reasons: 1) the flavor is great AS IS (although, to suit my personal tastes, I decrease the amount of cumin slightly and add a hearty pinch of cinnamon, as suggested by another reviewer-- FANTASTIC!) 2) packaged stuff always gives me indigestion, but this didn't.  This all natural recipe tastes great and is easier on the stomach, it seems.

I use 1 tbsp of the seasoning and 1 tbsp of flour per pound of hamburger. It doesn't taste exactly like packaged taco seasoning, but that isn't a bad thing. It tastes fresher and like actual herbs instead of salt and preservatives.

We loved it exactly the way it is. I did not have onion powder so used a bit of real onion. Otherwise I put the entire thing on one lb of ground turkey with about a 1/8 cup of water. My very picky family loved it and all three kids had seconds! I put meat over refried beans and crumbled tortilla chip and cheese on top. We will never use the packets again. Im making a big batch this wknd to keep in my pantry!

We have a garlic allergy in the family and this was great with no garlic and a little extra onion and salt.  I took others advice and added 1/2 cup water with the seasoning after browning, then let it simmer for a few minutes. Thanks for giving us a yummy option when we can't buy the packets!

What a great recipe. I've purchased the McCormick brand for years. Tonight I didn't have it on hand and was relieved to discover this recipe. I don't think I'll ever buy it from the store again. I had all of these ingredients in my pantry. Thanks!

this was way too hot! I am east indian and I eat very hot food but this was insanely hot. I had to throw it out.  I wonder if it varies according to the type of hot chilli powder. Maybe mine was too hot.

Perfect! Only change I made was not adding the onion powder, and that was just because I didn't happen to have any on hand. I'm planning on making this in large batches and storing. Thank you for the recipe!

This was very good with the exception of FAR too much black pepper. . . Half or even a quarter teaspoon would be more than enough. Took some others' suggestions and added a beef bouillon cube, 1 tablespoon tomato sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Will try again without so much black pepper!

this recipe has a much better flavor than store bought. I do bulk cooking and this recipe worked well for 2 pounds of ground beef (I like to taste the spices, not just see color).

I mean, do I really need to add another review to this?  Yes, because it was so great!  I didn't have cumin but it still came out fine.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious homemade taco seasoning!  My husband and I were VERY impressed!  I very well may use this seasoning for all tacos made in our future!  :)

Wow, this was so easy and so good. I liked being able to decrease amount of salt, we cut the salt in half. Used it with the allrecipes recipe for Southwest 
Chicken Bake - delicious.

This is much better than any packaged taco seasoning!  I dissolve 3-4 Tbl. in 2/3 cups water for each lb. of ground meat.  My husband loves it!

This is a great recipe and will replace prepackaged taco seasoning in my pantry.  It can be tailored to suit your family's taste.  I usually double the garlic and onion powder and sometimes omit the red pepper flakes for the kidos or add a little cayenne if I'm in the mood for a little spice.  You can't go wrong with this one!

Perfect. I used it with ground turkey. Didn't have onion powder but did have onion salt, so I omitted the sea salt and use onion salt instead. I can't imagine it could have tasted any better, but will get the powder for next time. Thanks!

this is excellent - tastes EXACTLY like the McCormick's taco seasoning packet and has no MSG... we will never be using the store bought packet again.  when we make tacos we use seasoning, cornstarch, and water as suggested by other reviewers and it turns out perfectly! thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I ran out of taco seasoning so I went here because I love this site! Now I never need to buy taco seasoning again. It is so good. The first time I made it I didn't have any crushed red peppers and it was still very good. You do not have to have them. The next time I made it I used the crushed red peppers in the package from the pizza place. Either way there is no more need for a packaged seasoning again! I think I use about half of the recipe per time. I usually cook about 3/4 lb per use.

I omit the cumin due to allergies but this is a great taco seasoning. I also leave out the salt and season the meat as needed.

I use this regularly as a base for tacos and it's a lot better than the packaged stuff. I always add extra garlic, onion, and cumin, and usually some chipotle as well. It's easy to adjust this recipe to your tastes or your mood.

My family loved this seasoning! The only thing I left out was the crushed red pepper flakes because myself and our kids don't like "heat". My husband loves spicy food and he still really liked this.

This is a great base recipe. I add about a tablespon or so of tomato paste and a couple splashes of chicken broth. Now it tastes just like taco seasoning.

This is awesome. I was making tacos for dinner and didn't realize I didn't have any taco seasoning mix. After looking in my cookbooks with no success, I got online and WOW this recipe rocks and no preservatives! Thank you . You are a lifesaver. After bragging about making tacos for two days I didn't want to let my husband down:)

Perfect! I reduced the amount of red pepper flakes by half for my 5 yr old and was still nicely flavored. Will use this as my only taco seasoning from now on! Thank you for sharing.

Great job for creating this!  We tried due to no mix in the pantry (of course, doesn't everyone) and loved it.  We only used this amount for 1 lb of beef and found it was enough!!  Yum!  Thank you for sharing Bill Echols!!!!

This was amazing!  Great butt saver since I, too, forgot I was out of packaged stuff.  My husband and I played w/ it a little and added a little  more kick.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I'm used to the subtle flavor that is commonly found in the packaged seasoning. This concoction didn't come close to replicating the store-bought version. We eat a lot of Mexican food at home and at authentic Mexican restaurants (not Taco Bell!). This doesn't taste anything like taco seasoning. Too much cumin makes for weird citrussy taste. It's back to the drawing board - or the store for me.

This did taste very similar to the taco seasoning packet, however, it was much more spicy.  My two young girls didn't quite care for it.

Made all same except used 1/2 tsp garlic and onion powder, 1/4 tsp sea salt, added 1 tbsp flour and 2/3 c. water for 1 lb of meat.  Great with a nice spicy kick

My mother and I loved this recipe. I've made it with chicken taco's so far. When we want it spicey we just add some cayan and a little more chili powder. Awesome recipe!

very good! It's a bit spicier than regular taco seasoning. I used cayenne pepper instead of flakes and at a much smaller amount.

perfect. had everything on hand and followed the recipe exactly (which is rare for me!). I'm going to make enough to fill my 6 oz mason jar to store for future use. (I figure about 2 tbs per pound of meat)

Tastes just like the packets.  I put it in the meat after cooking, just like a normal packet, but I melted 1/2 tbsp of butter and added 1/2 tbsp of flour to the butter, adding it to the meat mixture w/about 1 cup of water, let it reduce a bit - just like the "real" thing!

Definately a great recipe! More flavor than any of the pre-packaged mix. Kids complained it was spicy even after i cut down on the chili powder. Definately wil replace my taco mix from now on.

Fantastic taco seasoning!!  I didn't change a thing.  It may be a tad spicy for some but that's the way we like it.  I make a large batch and store it in an airtight container.  I've been using this for 3 years and haven't looked back.  Enjoy :)

I am never buying another seasoning packet again!

I made the recipe exactly as listed and found it a bit too salty.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. My husband likes his spicy and the kids more mild, so this was a great in-between.  

Thank you!

Made this several times. Absolutely delicious!  Never ever wasting money on packet again, and for anyone who is watching their sodium intake, it also tastes delicious minus the salt.

This was the best Taco Seasoning I have ever made, I didn't put it in my recipe box when I first made it and have been running low, even the pickiest thought it was delicious.  I was terrified I would not be able to find it again, I was so excited to see it again, I am now making it for my family for their families.  It is so great just to keep on hand....Thank you so much Bill!!!! I made it EXACTLY as written!

I change the serving size to 100 and it makes enough to fill a pint jar.  I store it in the pantry and when I'm  making tacos use 2 Tablespoons instead of a store bought packet.  Make sure you like the taste of the chili powder you are using.  There's so much of it, that it can really alter the taste.  I've made this recipe 3 times and it had a different flavor every time.

This was very good, not too spicy but had my favorite flavor of cumin nicely throughout. I made the recipe as is and added it to 1 pound of ground sirloin with about a 1/2 cup of water.

As Bill Echols said, "use as little or as much as you want." So, I did precisely that. Increased garlic & onion powders to 1 tsp each, decreased black pepper to 1/2 tsp, substituted 1/4 tsp dried cilantro for the oregano (don't care for it), and kept everything else the same. Wonderful, easy, and darn good! I'll be using this seasoning again!

Excellent! wanted tacos tonight and didn't realize I was out of seasoning packets.  A quick search got me to this, and I don't think I'll ever buy packets again!  I added 1/2 Tbsp flour to this mixture and 1/2 c water to browned ground turkey, simmered for 15-20 minutes--delish!!

Wonderful!  Will definitely make a larger batch next time to have on hand.  Very spicy.  2T per pound of meat would have been better than the additional I used.

I LOVE this taco seasoning! I use about 2 tbsp. per pound of meat, and it is perfect for me. It's spicy, but not too much, and it's definitely better than the store bought packets. I left out the cumin since I didn't have any. I made lots of extra so I can have it every time I make tacos now.

This is absolutely delicious!  While similar, it's better than any flavoring package out there and it's made with your own ingredients which is so much more appealing than manufactured food.

We love this recipe. We are a gluten free family and cannot use many of the prepared taco seasoning mixes.  I make it with a cup of water and let the seasonings simmer into the beef.

My high hopes were not disappointed.  This recipe is incredible.  There is absolutely no reason to buy packaged seasoning again.  I had to make a Taco Salad and had all the ingredients except seasoning.  I actually took the meat separate to the party so my friends could taste it before I added it to the salad.  They all agreed . . . AWESOME!!  Thanks for this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!!

I didn't care for this seasoning very much. It was too spicy for my young children (and I had even cut back on red peppers). Then my hubby and I felt like something was missing.

Very good, & will make it again..I didn't use black pepper, I used white pepper instead..I didn't need to add corn starch as some have written on here because if you simmer this mixture, it thickens itself.

My family LOVED this! I made it with to use for chicken tacos. I started the mixture out with two cans green chilis added in my shredded chicken and then added in this seasoning! KA-POW! Excellent dinner, spicy, but not too much! Dinner was a success! Will repeat often!

I was a little disappointed because I was really looking forward to this but I actually had to add about 4-5 tablespoons of seasoning to my groung beef and 1/4 cup water because it was dry and wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it would be.

I found this recipe 6 months ago and haven't bought package taco seasoning since. This is so easy and taste perfect. I make 4 times the recipe and keep it in the pantry. I love being able to spice it up more any way I like. The only addition I made is I add a tablespoon of arrowroot powder to thicken up the sauce of whatever dish I am making.

We don't like spice, so leave the red pepper out, but we have not bought a prepackaged taco seasoning mix since we discovered this recipe.  Less sodium is an added bonus!

I have recently decided to switch to a healthier lifestyle and have switched from ground beef to ground turkey. In my research for new ground turkey recipes, I came across tacos. I have never made tacos at home, nor have I ever bought packaged taco seasoning since I prefer to make a lot of my food from scratch. I decided to search for a homemade taco seasoning and came across this one. It had lots of reviews and really high ratings so I gave it a chance with my ground turkey. I made a quick black bean and corn salsa while the turkey was browning and dinner was done. Voila! Not only was it delicious, but I think that was the fastest from scratch dinner I've ever made. Thanks!

I made the recipe as stated and used the entire thing for one pound of lean ground turkey cooked with a chopped onion. My husband made tacos and I had a taco salad. I agree with all the reviewers and will not be buying taco seasoning packets again.

Made this recipe with 1lb ground turkey. We omitted the onion powder (we didn't have any) and substituted extra garlic powder. This is by FAR the best taco seasoning I have ever tasted. We will never go back to the package again. It was so quick and easy, and even my 2 year old liked it. Five stars from our family!

Very good recipe.  Suggest using 1T per pound of meet if you want it close to the packets.  I use 2T per pound for very good flavor.  Also substituted cayenne pepper for red pepper flakes and added an additional 1/4 tsp of garlic and onion.  Also works well with chicken.

Great!  I used fresh garlic and onion, just sprinkled it with salt and alternated chopping with smashing it with the flat side of my chef's knife to make a paste.  I also had to leave the chili (all of it) out for my kids :(

I didn't have any onion powder so I used seasoned salt instead of the regular salt. This was super fast/easy and is delicious. I agree with everyone who says there's no need to buy season packets anymore. This is much more flavorful.

Once you try this seasoning, you will never buy pre-made, store packaged seasoning again. Flavoring is amazing and not too hot or too spicy. Awesome.

This is a pretty good seasoning, nice and mild for people who don't like a lot of heat.  However, there is another recipe that I like better, so I will continue to use that one.

This is the first time I ever made tacos without a packet and I am definitely converted!  No more packets for me!  In addition to being much lower in sodium, it tasted equally as good (if not better) than the store bought stuff.  The recipe as is was perfect for one pound of meat.  I left out the paprika since I didn't have any but it came out great anyways.  I also added some cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it up a little. Perfecto!

This was an excellent combination of spices.  I used the entire mix for 25 oz. 93% lean ground beef, plus 2/3 cup pulverized canned tomatoes, one packet of Splenda, one can of Fritos bean dip, and a generous handful of chopped onions (1 c +)all mixed together and cooked until the meat was thoroughly cooked.  I didn't drain it (I usually have to add some liquid to that lean of beef, hence the tomatoes and bean dip) Delicious on white corn baked shells.  Thanks - it's a keeper!

This really left a lot to be desired for us.  The flour was too much and the salt not enough.  I ended up throwing in more seasonings in the end because it wasn't enough.  Thanks anyway.

Wow, very good and I agree with most that I'll just make a big batch to store and quit buying the packets!  Only substitute I made was ground coriander for oregano, only because I didn't have oregano.  Still great flavor!

Yum - husband and I really liked. I was confused on how much to use for how much meat. I used a package of 19.5 oz of ground turkey but I think this seasoning is for 1 Ib of meat. I also followed another reviewers recommendation and added 2/3 cup water after browning and adding seasoning. I let sit simmering in a covered pan for 10 or so minutes. A reviewer said it was too salty. I am not a big fan of salt so I followed their recommendation and cut by half. Not sure if this was necessary as I added more salt after cooking. Ingredients are great as is. Will NEVER buy packaged again - I feel so much better knowing exactly what is in my food!

Delish! Perfect mixture of seasonings and 100 times better than anything from a store-bought packet.  I took the advice of another review and added 1.5 teaspoons of flour to my mix and then added it to 93% ground beef.  Liked that it wasn't a drippy, greasy mess.  Definitely will make again.  Oh, but don't use anything other than sea salt.  I used Kosher b/c I didn't have any sea and it was a tad too salty.

I was missing some of the seasonings required but made due with cajun and ground red pepper not the flakes.. It still tasted amazing. We love spicy and that's definitely what we got!

absolutely perfect - so much better than store-bought and without all of the preservatives and phony stuff. i drop the red pepper flakes when making for the kids - they find it a little too hot otherwise. here's how I use it: brown 1lb of ground turkey, drain add seasoning and a few tablespoons of water to turkey. mix well over medium-low heat until most of liquid is absorbed.

So much healthier then the pre-packaged, I just use more then recommended about 3 tbsp for a beef batch. Be aware that if cumin is not your preference cut down on the amount you add.  I also tend to add a little bit of salsa when beef is almost done cooking to add a little more kick.

Delicious! It tastes like taco seasoning, but so much better and fuller. The only thing I left out was paprika, and only because I didnt have any. This is a lifesaver as Tex Mex isn't that popular where I live; people seem to think that fajitas should be bbq flavored. Anyway, thank you for posting this  recipe!!

This is so easy and good. Much better than store bought mixes and all the ingredients are already in my cupboard. Doesn't get any better than that!

I must eat only gluten-free foods and all the pre-packaged taco seasoning mixes I could all contained wheat flour. I was thrilled to find this recipe and even more thrilled the first time I made tacos with it. Thank you so much for sharing!

We loved this. A bit on the spicy side for some in our family so I may eliminate the red pepper flakes the next time. But, all in all this is a keeper!

This is AWESOME!  I doubled the spices (except for crushed peppers, used 1/4 tsp because I have a 4 year old)  I browned 3.58 lbs of lean ground beef, drained and added spice mix.  These were absolutely the best taco's I have made....I will use this over and over again.  THANK YOU BILL.  I didn't tweak anything and it was perfect!  :o)

Very nice! I substituted cilantro for oregano the second time I made it. I prefer it withe the cilantro just a bit more, but it really didn't make too much of a difference.

excellent! thank you so much for sharing this recipe, no more packages of taco seasonings for us! This is quick, simple, and very good. I didn't change anything. So happy to be able to avoid the little packages with extra ingredients I don't want, I am trying to avoid processed foods and this is just perfect.

I have been making this recipe for the taco seasoning for about 6 months now and it is the best. I will never buy it at the grocery store again. My son and husband love it and it is so easy to make.

I really don't understand the great reviews on this - this recipe needs a lot of work. It is too salty, it uses way too much chili powder, and even though you're using *too much* of some things it comes out flavorless. Also, without any thickener and liquid it's just some dry grainy stuff spread unevenly over the meat... these spices (especially all the chili powder) need liquid to even out. I added cornstarch and probably 1/2 cup of water. I do think that the 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes is a nice amount of spice for the family to share.

I love this because even though it was a little bit of investment for me to buy all the spices, it makes so much that it's WAY cheaper than the packets in the long run!  Very tasty, too.  I quadruple the recipe when I make it, and it just fits in an empty bullion jar.

Too salty!  I'd definitelley reduce the salt by 1/2 for sea salt or 1/4 for regular table salt.  But it made yummy meat!  It isn't going to be red like the store-bought kind but it's just as good and better for you!  I also added 1 t. of cornstarch.

Delicious!  Made with 1 lb of ground beef and it turned out perfect.  Just a hint of kick.

This turned out delicious!  Substituted the black beans for pinto beans.  I also cooked the chicken, beans, and corn separately.  I did not drain the beans, but I drained the corn.  Place in the oven for 15 minutes in a deep narrow dish with the Taco Seasoning (Taco Season I Recipe), then put the cheese on top for the remaining time to bubble.  For added spice, hot sauce!

Ok.  A bit salty.  1 teaspoon sea salt is too much.

Awesome recipe, sooo much better than taco seasoning from a packet....I add a few mini chipotle cubes made by Knorr to my mix (sort of like beef or chicken, I have my mum send them to me from California)

So tasty, and better than envelope mixes bought at the store. I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch for thickening. Will definitely use this, not store-bought, in the future...

I added into this recipe 1/4 tea cayenne and 1/4 more garlic powder and 1/2 tea paprika more and it was SO much better then the store bought. My family loved this and we will always make this. We also add doubled the recipe and added 2 small cans tomato sauce to our meat and it was just outstanding! A must try. Add the cayenne even if you do not like too much spice and it will be perfect!

I followed recipe as is!  I am so happy that I did because I almost doubled it, and was surprised how much this actually makes!  It was delicious! I used it for Steak Fajitas, and I enjoyed it so much!  Thank you for this recipe!  Packets in the store have sweeteners added to them, I love the fact that I can control all of the ingrediants!  It was excellent and I have already shared the recipe with someone!

Made this last night, added a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, it gave a great smokey flavor.  Next time will halve the crushed pepper flakes.  I doubled the recipe and used almost all of it in one pound of ground beef.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the instructions did not state how much of the seasoning to put into my meat. I put 2 teaspoons and I could hardly taste the seasoning. Good over all though. Next time I will have to add quite a bit more though.

Excellent blend of flavours that easily replaces the commercial version. I reduced the chili powder by half since the kind I have is really hot. I also used a 1/2 teaspoon each of onion and garlic powders. Tasted it on its own, and it still packs a punch!

This was a great seasoning! I substituted 1/8 tsp of cayenne for the red pepper flake, added a 1/2 tsp of flour to the seasoning before sprinkling it onto the meat, then stirred 2/3 cup of water in with the seasoned meat and let it simmer down. It had just the right amount of kick!

Simply great - makes all packaged mixes obsolete.  Use with high quality ground beef for wonderful tacos.  My son (who loves Mexican food) and I have already made this twice and plan to make it a weekly tradition.  I omitted the onion powder as I didn't have it.  This amount seasoned 1 lb of beef; I also added 1/4 c water.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This seasoning is awesome! It's much better than the packets you get in the store. The only problem I have is that it doesn't agree with my stomach. I'm guessing it's the cumin since the red pepper never bothers me. Maybe I'll tone that down next time.

This was a great starting block to make my own taco seasoning. We make tacos at least 2-3 times a month and it made more sense to make our own now. I bought slightly more expensive ingredients (because I know they are fresh) but I think that the cost difference is unbeatable for us. I usually only use half a tablespoon/whole tablespoon for a pound of turkey meat so I get my moneys worth. After getting it together for how we would eat it, the flavor was unbeatable, and even the reheating of the meat was better. It didn't just stay a blob in the dish. Would recommend this to anyone for 100% following the recipe or for a good starting block.

I mix up a big batch of this seasoning, store it in a jar in the fridge, and use it whenever I make tacos. I add 3 tablespoons mix and 2/3 cup water to each pound of ground meat (hamburger or turkey breast). It tastes very similar to packaged taco seasoning mix, but much better. I'll never buy the packaged mix again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I lived for a 16 months in a country where you couldn't get taco seasoning and this saved my life!  I'm back in the states now, but I continue to use this as it is much cheaper and better than store bought mixes.

Great seasoning recipe.  I've always used packaged seasoning but didn't have any on hand so I found this recipe.  I will never used packaged seasoning again!!  Much better flavor!

Love this seasoning & is my new go-to!  I used about 2T (plus a tsp or 2 of flour) to a lb of meat & 2/3c water.  Super yummy!

I omitted the  red pepper flakes, and on the second batch cut the chili powder just a bit (basically used a scant measurement) but  overall, the balance of spices is just right.  It's more fun to make spice mixtures than buy them, and they taste so much fresher that way.

Thank you for this! Now I can make my own taco seasoning instead of trying to remember to pick some up at the store (which I always forget)! And I think this is even better than store bought! I made a big jar of it so I could have some when I need it.

Definitely a keeper!  I omitted the crushed red pepper, since I didn't have any on hand, and I'm actually kinda glad because the seasoning was still spicy enough.  I will not be going back to prepackaged seasoning!

Terrific recipe! This is the 3rd time making a batch to store with my spices. So handy and much better flavor than the store brands. U can adjust the heat and/or seasoning to taste or to the meal your preparing. Love this! Thank You!!

This seasoning is awesome. Never buying from a packet again. Only difference is that we used Ancho Chili Powder instead of regular Chili Powder, only because we had some extra on hand. Made this with about 1.20 pounds of ground turkey and added some water while cooking since there wasn't enough fat to have it mix in all together.

Excellent. I subbed coriander for the oregano because I did not  have any. Since it was dried and only a quarter tsp. did not think it would be that big of a deal. Next time I make it I will not add the salt. I used canned refried beans and Morningstar Farms fake meat. So the whole situation made for too much salt. So I will omit it from this seasoning. Way better than the packaged stuff. And it just smelled so good!!!!

This was very good and extremely easy. I did leave out all the salt as I don't care for salt in recipes if I can avoid it. Everyone said this was too salty anyway so I just left it out. My husband did not even notice.

This homemade seasoning is fantastic. When you make taco meat with this, add a little bit of flower and water to the meat to create the sauce that you typically get with the store bought mixes. I WILL NEVER BUY THOSE MIXES AGAIN!

Excellent!!! I made tacos tonight and didn't realize until I had already defrosted the ground turkey that I didn't have a packet of seasoning, so I tried this one and it was great.  I diddled with it a bit (I like more cumin and also added about a tsp of brown sugar for roundness.)  Another post mentioned adding cornstarch as a thickener, and it's definitely an option if youre pressed for time want it to come together quickly just like the packet, but for me it was fine just adding the brown sugar and letting it cook down over low heat for about a half hour until most of the liquid evaporated.  A little fresh cilantro chopped into the meat mixture at the last minute and we were sitting down to excellent restaurant quality tacos!!  I don't think I'll be needing the packets anymore - thanks!

So good that we can no longer remember the last time we purchased taco seasoning.

This is a very good recipe.  I made it a couple weeks ago.  There is one glaring flaw in the recipe though.   There is nothing to thicken the seasoning.  You should definitely at a TBSp or two of cornstarch to this mix, because when you're cooking up the meat you have to add water.  If you simply add the cup of water to a pound of ground beef, it comes out very watery.  Add some cornstarch to this to thicken it up and you'll be in for some great tacos.

This was very, very good.  I agree with the others - there is no reason to purchase taco seasoning again.  Why include the bad stuff when you don't need to?  The one thing I would point out is if you have kids, or don't love spice - it is a little spicy.

Ooh, this is good! But I made a few modifications as noted by other reviewers. It IS too salty.  I doubled the garlic and onion powders to 1/2 tsp, changed the red pepper flakes to 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, and I'd recommend subbing 1 tsp of beef boullion for the salt. (I tried it instead of half of the salt, and it was still too salty.)  Surprisingly, it was better than the packets, and WAY better than the big bottle that we got from a bulk discount store.

FLAWLESS!  Perfect ingredients with the perfect amounts. Husband was highly impressed and now I keep a spice jar labeled, taco spice in my pantry.  Bye, store bought stuff!  Bill, do you have anymore recipes.  Tried searching and am having difficulty finding such.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe. Absolutely delicious with ground turkey for tacos. I added ~3/4 C water to 2 lbs of browned ground turkey before adding the seasoning so that everything mixed well. Wonderful, highly recommend.

Love the recipe! I didn't have paprika so I had to go without, but it still tasted great!  I'll pick up some paprika next time I go to the supermarket and try out the full recipe.  So glad I can break away from those seasoning packets!

This is delicious and easy soup!  I also used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site which gave it a little kick.  I let this cook while I was at work so I could not shred the chicken 5 hours in...shredded it right before serving and it was just as good.

I've started to hate the taste of taco seasoning packets, and this is the perfect solution for a homemade seasoning! It's fresher and lighter than a store bought packet and definitely tastier. I'll be making a big batch to keep in my cupboard. Thanks!

I love using this recipe.  It is such a great way to save money and time.  I add it to everything.  It is so great to have taco seasoning on hand and not have to pay 80 cents each time I make tacos.  Plus you can add more spice or more cumin if you prefer.

Yummy.  I substituted ground chipotle pepper for the red pepper flakes because I prefer the flavour.  I also omitted the salt from the mix, as I salt my meat as I cook it.  Other than that, I followed it exactly.

I was always told that you couldn't make your own taco seasoning to taste anything like what you can purchase at a store.  Those people were wrong!  This is wonderful.

Very good. I added 1/2 tsp extra of cumin and garlic bringing the total to 2 tsp cumin, 3/4 tsp garlic (probably could bump that up to 1 tsp). Added 1/4 cup water. Very, very good!!!

I tried this recipe, but made a couple of substitutions.  I omitted the paprika because I was out.  I added ground chipotle pepper for part of the black pepper.  The seasoning was very good. The added smokiness from the chipotle was wonderful.  My kids ate better than they ever do.  They said it tasted like Taco Bell.  I found that amusing, but that is a very good review coming from them. I did not find it to taste like Taco Bell though.  This had so much more flavor and was very good.  I will use this recipe from now on.

According to my husband this turned out great.  However,  my kids thought it was too hot, so I might try it without the red pepper flakes.

I used this with vegetarian ground beef, the kind in the tube (not from the freezer section. I had half a tube of "beef," used about a Tbsp of seasoning, and added 1/4 c water. It was great! Super easy and all spices I had lying around.

Awesome! I use some cayenne instead of the flakes (unfortunately not much because of the kids). I double recipe and keep it taped to the jar I store it in so I always have it handy.

We ran out of taco seasoning at home so I dug into my Allrecipe recipe box and used this.  Why did I ever waste money on those packets in the first place?  This was great!

This wasn't the worst recipe, but I tweeked it a bit and it tasted a lot better. The things I changed were:1.5 TBSP-chili powder, .75 tsp-garlic powder, I used hot paprika, 1 tsp-ground cumin seeds, .5 tsp-sea salt, and .5 tsp-black pepper. I hope you enjoy!

This seasoning has a great flavor but was a bit too hot for my husband's mild taste buds.  ha  The next time I make this, I will cut back a bit on the red pepper.  This seasoning is much better than store-bought, though I like them too.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect!  The best is you can control the amount of salt you want to add.  I cut it down to 1/2 tsp of sea salt but that's just my preference.  You could also make it more spicy if you wanted.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing.

I wanted to make tacos, and nacho for dinner, but I realized I had no taco seasoning. This is a very good recipe, though I wish I read further on some of the reviewers, a few were not that crazy about it, a little too spicy for them. Most however loved it, and said I can forget the storebought anytime. Thanks for saving the dinner for me.lol

Like most who review this recipe, I ran out of the packaged seasoning and turned to this trusted web site for help.  Found it with this recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!  Very yummy!!  I did follow some suggestions:  used dry onion flakes when I browned the meat (something I always do) so I deleted the onion powder; didn't have red pepper flakes so I used a scant 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper; and added 1/2 c. water when I added the mixture to the meat then let it cook til the water was gone.  This recipe is defintely a keeper!!

Easy and Excellent!!!  Easily add or subtract season to taste!  I did not use garlic or onion powder bc I prefer fresh onion and garlic sauteed in my taco meat.  All of my kids loved it!

Mr. Echols, wish I could give you 6 stars.  This was awesome.  Glad I made a lot of it.  I put it into two jars and will give one to my DD who cannot have any of the "bad" stuff in those mixes that I can't stand either.  This is AWESOME.  Thanks sooo much for sharing with us.  Bev

I threw chicken breasts in the slow cooker coated with your TS1 and used the meat for enchiladas.  Instead of using crushed red pepper, I used ground ancho chili seasoning and it was excellent. Kudos for posting a great recipe.

This worked out very well. 2.25 lbs of meat used up all 10 servings. I reduced the cumin by 1/3rd, added 1/4 tsp. cocoa powder, and when I made my tacos, added 1 tsp. beef soup base. It was great, and perfectly salted :) Thanks, I'll continue to use this!

This seasoning tastes like a less salty version of the pre-made packages you buy in the store. Which after making this, I will never buy again.

It sounds really good,but I found out that using taco sauce for the meat works very well,and the meat sticks together for tacos. It doesn't fall apart or crumble like the regular taco seasoning and tastes much better.

I added this to 8 oz. of tomato sauce and used as a substitute for taco sauce.  Have you looked at the ingredients in packaged taco seasoning?  Almost every brand has msg in it.  Not for my family.  This recipe is an awesome substitute.

I never buy packaged seasoning (very high in sodium) any more, I only use this recipe.  I cut back the salt by about half.

This was great.  Will definitely make this instead of buying the packets in the future.  It brought my (sigh) ground turkey, to a higher level for our tacos.  Thanks.

I no longer use the taco seasoning pouches at the store thanks to this recipe.  This blend is easy to make and just enough for a pound of meat.  Love it!  Thanks for sharing.

I used the recipe, as prepared, on approx 1 lb of ground turkey (with some flour added).  I thought the meat was bland.  Ended up adding a bunch more chili pepper, and it was just ok.

I used this in the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup recipe on this site & it was one of the best recipes I ve made according to my family, & that's saying something, since I'm a pretty good cook. But I have to give most of the credit to this wonderful seasoning mixture. This will be a staple in our house from now on. Thank you Bill!

Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I'll stick with the Old El Paso reduced sodium packet.  This worked in a pinch, since I had started making tacos but discovered I didn't have the seasoning.  It was too spicy for my family, and my meat didn't have the same consistency as it does when I use the store-bought stuff.

I made 'Mexican Mess' by using 2 tbsp of this mix, 2 c sour cream, and one pkg of cream cheese, blended well. Top with grated cheese, and you have an awesome dip! I have made this with the packaged seasoning many times, and tonight made it with this recipe...to RAVE reviews!!! Much cheaper, and better tasting! Thanks!!!!

This makes some GOOOOOOD taco meat!!!! My mom who HATES the store bought "" loves when I make taco salad using this recipe. I cut the salt by 3/4, still tasted good, because my whole family watches our sodium intake. Way better than packaged mix, easy to make, very flavorful and aromatic while it's cooking - definitely!

This is awesome!!!  I quadruple the recipe and keep in a baggie in the cupboard.  Then it is always ready to go for taco night!  I have used it as a marinade/rub on steak as well.  Was excellent that way too!

We make a large jar of this and keep it on hand at all times. We did decrease the salt. We like to experiment with it, last time we used ground ancho chilis for the red pepper flake and once we used ground chipotle pepper for it. Good recipe. Way better than the stuff in the packet!

Perfect. I can see why this recipe has over 1,000 ratings! I've been trying to cook healthier and so don't want to use pre-made taco seasoning anymore as the salt content is crazy.   This one fits the bill and tastes great. My husband and I are vegetarian and this blends really well with texturized vegetable protein (also called soy crumbles or veggie ground round. This is the vegetarian equivalent of beef ground round).   As the TVP is dehydrated, you add water or vegetable stock to rehydrate it (I used water this time as I was making a taco bake). That added just enough moisture to help the seasonings stick to everything.   Turned out very tasty and even the hubby, who tends to eat lots of salty things, enjoyed it as well. I didn't find it that spicy but omitted the red pepper flakes because we didn't have any.  Thanks for much for posting this!!

We have been using this recipe for about 2 yrs now and I can't keep enough made up. We love it because it  has less salt, more flavor and NO MSG, so no one gets headaches like we used to with the packaged seasoning.  Thank you for putting this on the site!!!

Very, very good! I had ran out of the packaged kind and decided to try this recipe. I like the fact that their isn't any MSG in it. I will be using this recipe from now on. No more packaged taco seasoning for me!

Thank you so much for the recipe! I cannot have anything with MSG and all of the commercial taco seasoning packets contain it. This tastes so great. I think it makes the food taste fresher than when using packaged seasoning.

I was a little wary of this because some of the reviews indicated it was really spicy. Granted, I LOVE spicy food, but I didn't find it too spicy or even all that spicy. It tastes exactly like the taco seasoning packets you buy, but this is so much better because you can control the amount of salt. I took a cue from another review and added cornstarch and water to thicken up the sauce it made. Really good stuff!!

I always make my own taco seasoning, but this was my first time making this one.  My husband noticed and said it was much better than the usual!  I made it exactly as is only I used just half the salt, figuring I could add more to taste later.  I cooked one pound of ground beef with the seasoning and one large clove fresh garlic.  In the end, I didn't add any more salt (not needed), just added a sprinkle more cumin and chili power (we love the stuff), and the meat came out perfect!

This was great when I ran out of taco seasoning and didn't have time to go to the store. I cut back on the black pepper and added some flour to it. My family really liked it, and I'll be using it again.

This was excellent.  I multiplied the recipe times 6 and used it to flavor 6 lbs. of meet for a "taco party" (adding water til it looked like the right consistency.  Best tacos we've had.  Will make again and again.

I've meant to review this before, as I've now used it many times, but it is the best!  It tastes better than the storebought packets, its cheaper, and way less chemical/mystery ingredients!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a great seasoning mix, and very convenient since all of the spices are ones I keep on hand. As others have confirmed, this is better than the store-bought packets! I actually made this because I was out of the packets, but I won't be going back after trying this.  The only change I made was to use dried minced onion instead of onion powder because that's what I had on hand. Next time I might try cutting or eliminating the salt because I don't think I'd miss it with all the other spices. I used the whole mix with about 1 1/2 lb of chicken. It turned out very flavorful and was perfectly spicy that way. Those who don't like their food very spicy might want to cut that ratio in half.

Same here! I had everything to make tacos, except for the seasoning packet! I searched online and this was the first recipe I found!  Good thing too - it's great! I had everything I needed in the spice cabinet.  Best of all, I didn't have a MSG headache when the meal was over.  I will never use a taco seasoning packet again. Thanks!!

This is a very versatile seasoning mix that makes delicious tacos, chili and even chip dip (just mix with your preferred amount of sour cream). I had been worried about the msg in the taco seasoning mixes at the grocery but hadn't found a recipe we liked, until now.  So glad we found this one!

SO GOOD! About 2 T per pound of meat is about right for me. I didn't have crushed red pepper flakes so made it without and it was fine. Will try it with next time though.

SO GOOD! I took the suggestions of others..cut back on some of the "spicy" ingredients. I halved the paprika, 1/8 tsp pepper flakes, and 1 tsp cumin. After I had all the ingredients together I tossed them in the blender to make the spices all the same size. The flavor turned out PERFECT, little hint of spice but not over powering. I found that this recipe is enough for about 1 lb of meat (2 tablespoons approx). I used 2/3 cups water and about 1 tblsp flour to thicken it up. Just cooked until it was thick. Thank you!

We couldn't believe how good this seasoning was. Had a less salty taste than store bought mixes. Liked that it has no preservatives! We also vary the intensity of the heat by modifying the pepper. Highly recommended!

I'm so glad to find this recipe.  I can not eat wheat and so many of the mixes bought in the store have flour (wheat) in them.  Thank you.  This has great flavor and I like the idea that I can adjust the seasonings to my family's tastes.

Excellent - my husband didn't know the difference until I told him.  Used turkey meat (1 lb), 1/2 the salt, and about 2/3 cup water.  Will make a larger batch next time for future use!

I had tacos for dinner last night and realized I didn't have any taco seasoning.  I tried this recipe because it had the most 5 star reviews.  I followed directions exactly, but I was disappointed in the flavor of the meat.  It seemed to be lacking something that the taco seasoning packets have.  Some ofhter recipes call for flour or cornstarch, and maybe that would have made the difference.  I probably won't use this recipe again.

Made this last night because, to my display, the ground beef was done but I was out of seasoning packets.  I went to my trusty reserve spot and there was no taco seasoning there either.  Looked up this recipe, tried it, and it was a hit.  My husband commented that the meat was excellent, and the kids agreed.  :)  What more could you ask for.  I have 4 children under the age of 6, so I didn't use any of the crushed red pepper flakes.  I will try it with them next time, just to see which way we like it better.  Excellent excellent and so easy.

I am never buying taco seasoning again!  I usually buy the packets and started cooking the meat before I realized I was out.  So trusty AR came to the rescue.  I whipped this up real quick and loved it!  I will be making this again.

I was in a pinch when I found this recipe- I had all my taco fixins ready and the meat browning- but no spice mix!  I put it together in about 2 minutes and it was GOOD!  Just the perfect amount of spice to leave your taste buds tingling when you're done! I used the full amount for 1-1/4 lb meat.  THANK YOU!

AWESOME! I am so impressed with this seasoning mix that I tripled the recipe and made several ziplocks of it and mailed it to my family members. I can't get enough! It's great!

This recipe is great. As others mentioned I was also out of taco seasoning and didn't want to run out in bad weather. So I followed this recipe and my picky family didn't even notice the difference. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome! I decreased the chili powder and the red pepper a by little bit.  I didn't want to make it too hot for my young children...they love tacos.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!  Yet, another person who refuses to buy the packages! I will make a batch like other reviewers did.

I have been using this recipe for quite some time now and I am not allowed to make tacos with regular store bought stuff anymore.  For more of a smokey flavor and kick I add a tablespoon of chipotele powder as well.  I also just salt to taste and usually add more garlic :)

My husband and I both LOVED the flavor this recipe gave our taco meat!  It just tasted real - it's funny how you start to taste all the artificial ingredients after you have really good natural recipes!!  I will go a touch lighter on the salt next time.

I recently made this when I went to prepare tacos and didn't have any seasoning.  Fantastic.  This was the first time in a while I impressed my husband.  He couldn't believe I made taco seasoning myself....I didn't bother to tell him how easy it was...sssshhh!  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe. I will never go back to the packaged seasonings. The only thing I changed was to add 1/4 tsp chipotle seasoning and use smoked paprika instead of regular. Thanks so much for this great recipe.

I used this recipe to season the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup and it was a little too spicey for us (too much red pepper). I carefully measured out the ingredients too. Next time I'll either reduce the red pepper flakes or leave it out. But overall very tasty.

I added 1/2 Tbsp. of flour before adding to the meat with 2/3 cup of water, as other reviewers suggested. I probably won't ever need to buy a premixed taco seasoning packet again, as this tasted much better!

I tried this when I ran out of taco seasoning and already started making my dish, this was fabulous! I won't buy the premixed again. The only thing I did differently was that I used crushed red pepper instead of the flakes (didn't have the flakes on hand) It makes a decent amount, so I have some premixed for next time. I was surprised at how easy this was. Thanks a bunch

You have to give this 5 stars when 3 of the 4 girls scarfed down their tacos.  Hubby smiled and said best in a long time!  I used a little less salt and crushed pepper.  I also added tomato sauce and a little water after browning the meat and seasoning.  Thanks, will be using this all the time!!!!

Versatile and delicious Much better flavor than the prepared taco seasonings.  Also, I can control the heat.   It is versatile with ground beef, turkey or chicken.  For a fast dinner, I tear up leftover rotisserie chicken, heat up a pan with a little oil and put in the chicken and some seasoning until it is warm.  Then with some shredded cheese, lettuce, diced tomatoes and taco shells. Voila.  yum.   We did this at a get together after an event and it made for an easy dinner.

Perfect!  This is great!  I use a little beer to bring it together with the meat, and I use more onion powder only if I am not putting onions in my meat mixture.

Very good. One tablespoon of chili powder proved a bit too hot for some in the family, but it was just right for me. Surpasses any packaged seasoning mix.

This was very easy. It tastes better than the taco seasoning packets you buy in the store. I substituted 1/8 cayenne pepper for the pepper flakes and just used 1 tsp. of cumin, as the reviewer "I'm Nuts too" said to do. I used 1 # pound ground beef for this recipe. I tripled it, with 4 sons, my husband and company around they ate it quickly.  My husband liked how spicier it was than store bought taco seasoning packets!!  I think I will make some ahead and put in freezer.  It makes 2 Tbsp.-2 1/8 Tbsp.for one recipe- 1# ground beef!!

This recipe does not need another 5 star review, but I can't resist.  I, as well as others will NEVER buy taco seasoning again.  I even made a huge batch, printed copies of the recipe & gave as a little Christmas bonus gift.  As soon as my sister-in-law received hers, she did the same LOL!  Bill...I bow to you sir!

Excellent.  I used 1TBSP for half a pound of ground beef, poured 1/4 cup of water in, threw in some chopped red pepper, mixed it in, cook until thick, and poured over pasta.  Yums!  I think I will increase the seasoning to 2TBSPs for some kick! :)

Wonderful! So much better than the package stuff! Takes only a few minutes.  I make up a triple batch and keep in in an air tight container to have on hand when needed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

excellent!
I used the whole seasoning batch on one lb of beef and it was just the right amount. I added one Tablespoon of gluten-free flour to the seasoning mixture and 2/3 cups of boiling water and that was just right. I have a gluten allergy and cannot use the taco seasoning packages... this alternative is even better!!
and my boyfriend loved it too!
Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best taco seasoning recipe I've used.  I did have to make one change, since I found myself out of chili powder.  I had some dried New Mexico Red Chiles in the pantry so I ground 2 of them in my coffee grinder, then doubled the recipe.  It was spicy but delicious!
Thank you for the recipe!

I have been using this seasoning for a few years now, and have never purchased a mix since then.  We do like spicy things, so typically we use the exact recipe with  1 pound of ground beef or chicken.  I've also been making twice as much to save for the next batch of tacos as a timesaver.

This recipe is awesome!! I don't understand the measurements, though. I am looking at an envelope of taco seasoning. It's a 1.25 oz packet. On the back, it says it contains 6 Tablespoons worth. Seems to me that if you use 3 Tablespoons of Bill's seasoning mix for a pound of meat, it would be rather bland. Am I wrong in my thinking that I should use 6 T's of Bill's seasoning?

This was easy due to having all the ingredients on hand.  It was not too spicy for my "whimpy" taste, but enough flavor to satisfy my "loves spicy" husband.  After doing some research, 2-3 Tablespoons = 1 packet of taco seasoning.  Thanks!

I've been wanting to find a good combination of seasonings for tacos because I know how bad those packets are for you... THIS IS IT! It was awesome, my husband loved it, and like a lot of the other reviewers, we will never go back to using the packet! :)

Couldn't be easier and tastes great. We used this to season ground beef for taco casserole and it turned out delicious. Has a little bit of heat to it if made exactly as the recipe states. Yum! Thank you!

This is awesome seasoning!  I am not a big salt person, so I just added a little table salt and left out the salt that it calls for.  I used this to make taco samosas.  I fried the ground beef, added the seasoning, and put it in puff pastry with some cheese.  Then I deep fried it!  Will never use a package mix again!

I'm not exactly sure how to rate this recipe...I made it almost exactly as written with the exception of using 1/4 tsp of salt (to make it low sodium).  It definitely resembled taco seasoning...just feels like it's missing something.  I used the entire recipe for 2 lbs of ground beef (worked out to 4 tbsp, so I think people's conversions are right when they say 2 tbsp to 1 lb ground beef).  I did add a touch of water to it and maybe that is what happened - seemed like it diluted it down or something - yet others on here do the same thing and rate it a 5 star.  I think it needs some sort of thickening added to it - will try to add a sprinkle of flour next time.  But I still think there's a spice missing somehow - perhaps the beef cube like another reviewer mentioned.  I'm not giving up on this recipe as it is "almost" there, and I like the idea of making my own sesasoning.  Thanks for the recipe.

Without knowing that I used this recipe instead of the usual store bought seasoning pack, my husband raved that these were the best tacos that I ever made!  My 12 year old daughter thought it was a little spicy, but she still had 2nds and 3rds!

Oh this is SOOO much better than a store bought packet!  And no preservatives or MSG.  I was out of red pepper flakes, so I used ground red pepper instead.

I followed others advice and added a tsp. of beef bouillon paste and dusted the beef with about a tsp. of flour then added the seasoning- stirred that and added about 1/2 to 3/4 c. water and let it simmer for 10 minutes or so.  I will never use the store bought packets again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was awesome! I didnt agree with the pepper flakes, but I felt I had to try the original recipe before any alterations. Next time, Ill exclude the flakes due to personal preference. (i cant handle the slight bite, Im a wimp i know) Either way, no more prepackaged taco seasoning!  :)

Great! I made exactly as stated except used cayenne instead on crushed red pepper flakes b/c I didn't have any. The seaoning is a bit spicy when tasted alone, I thought it might be but wanted to see how it was as stated. The spiciness did not affect the outcome of my tacos. Great, Great, great!! I'm thrilled by all the $$ I'll save by making this staple with spices I always have in my cupboard! Thank you so much!

Although I did cut back a little on the cumin, this was very simple to put together, tasty, and likely a lot cheaper than buying a brand name taco seasoning.  I doubled the recipe to fit in a generic spice bottle, then used it in the Shepherd's Pie Mexicana recipe, also found in AllRecipes. Very good.

Very close to packaged seasoning, although I was not sure how much to add to my ground beef.  Next time I'll use the whole batch for optimum flavor.  Will make again, no more store bought for me.

I couldn't believe how great this tasted! It's the only taco seasoning I use now! It's great for chilli.
This makes a good amount of seasoning, be prepared to store the rest, you WILL use it later :)

Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I am lazy and usually just buy my taco seasoning mix in the packet at the store.  But when I don't have any, I can use this recipe with all the ingredients in my spice cabinet.  This is a keeper!  Wonderful flavor.

Was in the middle of cooking dinner when I realized I had no taco seasoning packets.  Found this recipe immediately and glad I did.  Excellent recipe.  Easy and quick.  Had all ingredients on hand.  So much less salty than season packets.  No more season packets here either.  Thanks

i add about two tablespoons of this and about a cup of water to cooked veggie crumblers to make quick veggie taco's. I didn't have and cumin so I used curry powder instead and it worked great. I love this recipe I will never buy store bought taco seasoning again.

Good recipe.  This tastes a lot like the pre made packages, but  it doesn't haave the same processed food quality to the flavor and you are able to control the spice and salt levels.  I used half the salt and upped the cumin to 2 tsp.  I added this to 1/2 lb of 93/7 ground beef and 1 cup of kidney beans and simmered.  I also threw in some green bell peppers and an onion.  This made really good taco salad meat. Thanks for posting!

This is way better than the prepackaged taco seasoning packets!  It had way more flavor, without the extra salt.  I cut back on the black pepper, only used half what is called for in recipe.  This will be my taco seasoning from now on!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was very good, but it was too salty and had too much black pepper, to me. The second time I made it I cut the salt and black pepper to a 1/2 tsp. and changed the crushed red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. of ground chipotle chile pepper (has a smokey flavor to go with the heat). I will never buy store bought taco seasoning again. Thanks Bill. Five stars and highly recommended!

I am never,ever going to buy store bought seasoning again! This was great. It smells wonderful and had a great flavor for our meat mixture. I used this to make beef and black bean burritos and WOW! what a hit at the table. Thanks Bill for this easy and great recipe, it was made with all the things I have in my spice rack. I did however use cayenne pepper instead of the crushed red pepper flakes and it was great! Thanks again Bill!
Update-1/20/09. this stuff is awesome. I have used this is in all kinds of Mexican items. I plan an making more than enough to share as gifts in the future. I can't thank you enough Bill for sharing!!

I love that you can make your own taco seasoning, I don't like cumin so I've never been able to get past the tast of it in store bought seasoning.  That being said I decided to omit that and use only a portion of the chili powder.  I think that the portion of garlic:onion powder:red pepper flakes:oregano:paprika:pepper is spot on, but found the salt to be overwhelming (I think half would be sufficient), I also added a little ginger as well to the mix.

Wow this is great! I love that I can say goodbye to the packets Whoohooo! My family liked this, hubby said tastes like taco meat. I don't like black pepper so I used white pepper instead and also used cayenne pepper in place of the red pepper flakes as suggested in another review. I also cut the salt in half but that was because my son can't handle salt. Thanks for the recipe! Never going back to packets!!!

Very good seasoning. I forgot to buy the package seasoning and tried this recipe. I'm kinda glad I forgot to buy the package, this was great.

I thought this was a three star, my fiance thought a five star, so this is a compromise. Make sure to add water and cornstarch with the meat, or it will be too dry.

I decreased the chili powder slightly, didn't have paprika, and omitted red pepper flakes.  At first I thought it was too salty, but once you put all of your toppings in the taco, it balanced very nicely.  Next time, I will put the recommended amount of chili powder.  I will probably just make a big batch and use 2 Tbsp per pound of ground beef as in previous reviews.  Everyone loved it, and it will become a regular for sure.  Maybe I'll add some dehydrated onion next time...

Great taco seasoning!  Better than packets and without the weird chemicals they add.  I made a large batch after trying it so I will have it on hand and for gifts! Thanks!

This is fantastic.  I've used the mix twice:  once in a hamburger mixture for burritoes and the other in a chili relleno casserole recipe (found on this site) as enchilada sauce = 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 small can of tomato paste and additional water to desired consistency.  This will definitely be a staple in my spice cupboard.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is good and I made just as stated.  I gave it 4 stars, because as I like black pepper this is heavy on the black pepper.  I will cut the black pepper in 1/2 next time and I also will cut the salt for personal health reasons.  As stated this is enough for 1lb of meat.  I was looking for something, so I did not have to buy the packets, for health reasons also.  THANKS..

Good taste. I was short on chili powder and only had maybe 1/2 a tablespoon.  It tasted a little heavy on the black pepper but I would definitely make this again.  I appreciate finding this recipe because we didn't have a seasoning packet on hand.

This recipe is simply awesome! We have used it in the beef for tacos and for our chicken enchiladas as well. I will never buy store taco seasoning again. It does run on the spicy side so if you are not one for very spicy, I would recommend cutting down on the chili powder. I had every ingredient in my spice cabinet which was the reason I tried it in the first place and I'm so glad I did. The recipe makes plenty so you will have leftovers. Your food will not need as much as you would put in if it was a store packet. We used about 1-2 tablespoons depending on the dish.

We loved this recipe! No more packets for us. We like things spicy especially my husband so he loved it. It isnt to spicy though. Our 13 month old son didn't complain although for once we didn't have a problem getting him to drink his milk! Great Job!!

This is excellent.  I don't think its the super spiciest but for average regular folk, I think its plenty spicy.  I add it to hamburger meat when we want something a little different for pizzas, and also when we make nachos.  For my family, this one is 'the one'.  Would never buy packaged again.  This one tastes better!

This is the BEST seasoning ever!  I was a die hard packet user until I made this.  I will never use packets again.  It is spicier than what you would find in those premade packets so a little experimentation might be in order.  I love it just the way it is!!

PS forgot to add to review, don't forget to add water to beef and seasoning just like a packet.  Very good.  Didn't have Old El Paso seasoning so tried this and now have no desire to buy OEP anymore.  Kids don't like spicy so omitted red pepper so it was the taco flavor without the kick and used entire batch in 2 lbs ground beef for Taco Pie.  Thanks!

Delicious! The only change I made was to drop the cumin down to 1 tsp. The tacos I made with this were probably the best ones I've ever had - the perfect amount of heat and flavor, without all of that orange grease you get from store-bought packets. The flavor was really on a level of its own. Great recipe!

This was as good as everyone says. It's nice not to have to buy the seasoning anymore. I added a bit of water to the meat to keep it moist. I copied it exactly but lessened the salt, just to cut back on the sodium and it was good.

Pretty good!  I drained a can of lentils half way, warmed them up and mashed them, added 1/2 of this recipe mix, and voila!  Tasty veggie tacos.  A little too salty for me though.  Will cut salt in half next time.  We were out of paprika.

Fantastic!!  I used only a teaspoon of the cumin and it was still a little too hot for my 5 year old, so I'll adjust that again next time.  But I'm with everyone else!  Never again will I buy the packets - this is too easy!!

Being from Texas, we're sort of experts on what tacos should taste like...this is it!  I started a diet where i have to lower my sodium intake and I love that I can control exactly how much sodium I get.  If you want a different kind of heat, substitute the crushed red pepper with the ground cayenne pepper (ground red pepper, same thing)..then you can be really specific how much heat you get.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Pretty good.  Good to use for low sodium diet - either omit or decrease the salt

TERRIFIC TACO SEASONING

This recipe, exactly as written, is all we use now.  I save spice jars, pimiento jars, etc., and pack a single batch into each jar, along with the typed recipe, to give as gifts on birthdays and holidays.  Friends love it.  What a great find!

excellent seasonings.  I added to cooked beef, added 1c of water and cooked it down.  it had a nice mexican spice - perfect for ground beef tacos

P.S.  hey SHANNON91782, I grew up in Northville!!!  :)

Very good, passed it along to Mom, too and she's converted from the store-bought packages.  :)  Ours turned out pretty spicy, I might have used the wrong pepper!  Will use again.

This is a great seasoning.  I did have to cut out the salt because my husband has high blood pressure, but he loves it.  I will never use the packets again.

Great recipe!  Like other reviewers, I would never have thought to make my own until I needed some and didn't have any.  How simple and quick this is.  I didn't find it too spicy...in fact, I think I would prefer more than this recipe for 1 package of ground beef, depending on the use.  For tacos, I will try 1.5 times this recipe next time.  I used it in the Taco Quiche recipe and it was great.

Tastes exactly like what you buy in the store- it won't "wow" you but at least it doesn't have all the additives!

Great recipe!  I did cut back a little on the cumin.  Once the spices were added to the beef, I added some flour and water for thickening.  No reason to buy those packets anymore!

Wonderful!!!  I was getting ready to make a mexican dish and realized that I forgot the taco seasoning.  I quickly got onto the Allrecipies site and found this recipe which saved me!  I made an extra batch of this and use it to season all of my mexican dishes.  Watch the red pepper, it can get hot!

My very dubious 16 year old son said this was awesome and much better than those brand name box mixes I've brought home.  So flavorful.  I left out the red pepper flakes and didn't miss it. Very easy to mix up and have on hand.  I plan to use this in other Tex-Mex recipies.

Fabulous!  So much more flavor than a store-bought package.  I add 1 tbsp of cornstarch to make it less watery. 

I will make a whole recipe and mix 1/2 of it with 2/3 c water for 1 lb of ground beef or chicken. Then save the other half for another meal.

This recipe was fantastic. It tasted just like the packaged seasonings you buy in the store. I had to down size the red pepper flakes a bit though. It was a little to hot for the little ones. Other than that it is perfect. Thank you.

My husband loves store-bought taco seasoning, but he said this was even better!  I used the entire recipe to season half of a pound of ground beef and mixed it into the browned meat with water and let simmer.  I would double the recipe for a full pound.

Excellent!  To be honest, I was just sick of looking at those bottles of onion powder, cumin, chili powder that I rarely use, so I figured why not give this a shot.  Really, really like this combination!  Used it on chicken, seasoning ground beef for a taco dip and even sprinkled a bit on some popcorn for a savory snack!

Like many others, we use this instead of the package mix. I don't keep red pepper flakes on hand so use black pepper instead.  
Keep meaning to make alot at once to store or may just make alot of taco meat and freeze. Great stuff!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Oh wow....I thought I had a seasoning packet in my pantry, but come to find out when I searched for it I didnt...I didn't have time go run to the store so I figured I'd prolly find a homemade taco seasoning recipe on this website, and used this one....on my! I will NEVER buy packets at the store again! This tastes much better! I used it with shredded chicken. Awesome!!

Excellent! It is a little hot for my two year old (maybe take some out before adding the taco seasoning for the little ones  to eat or don't add as much crushed red pepper) but fine for the adults and older kids!

This is a great seasoning! It adds the spice missing from packaged seasonings. If it is too spicey you can always adjust it for your tastes. I think next time I will add a little more garlic and onion powder. I will definately make a large batch to keep on hand

Perfect. I used regular salt because I didnt have any sea salt. Mixed 1 full batch with 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 3/4c. of water. Will NEVER buy pre-packaged seasoning any more!

Ever since I found this recipe I always keep some of this in my spice rack, premixed.  It works fantastically since I often forget to buy the seasoning at the store.  One thing I have found out about this is that you need to be sure to use the more expensive spices (as you should in all cooking if you ask me) or else the flavors will be off.

I have been using this taco seasoning for a couple of years now.  It is a pantry staple in our house!  I keep a jar mixed up all the time.  I didn't add the red pepper flakes, but I did add a spoonful of dehydrated onion to the mix.  Sometimes I put a couple drops of hot sauce in the meat to kick things up a bit flavor-wise without making it too hot.  Two thumbs up!  Thanks for a great money-saving recipe!

wow, delish! I made this because I forgot to buy the seasoning packet and I will never buy a packet again. I think I might even make up some of this to give at Christmas. I did not have cumin so I used chili powder and it still came out great, thanks for sharing!

I made this for my husband and I for tonight's dinner, and it was fantastic. I took all the ingredients and ground them in an electric coffee grinder and dumped right in with a pound and a half of hamburger meat, let simmer for about 20 minutes, and the results were great. Next time I will use  half the salt; it was a little overpowering.

This recipe worked well.  I left out the crushed red pepper flakes because I don't like things too spicy.  I simmered cooked chicken chunks in water and the spices for 5 min, then spooned over tortilla chips with salsa and sour cream.  Yum!

Too spicy for us!  I'm not much of a packet flavoring person.  However, in this case I really do prefer the taco seasoning you buy at the store.  Aside from spicy it wasn't that bad.  I would use it if I needed taco seasoning for a recipe and didn't have any on hand.

Great seasoning! No need to buy the packaged stuff again!  You can control the salt and heat!  My only suggestion would be to increase the cumin and add some ancho chile powder for a nice smoky flavor.  Tastes so much less artificial than the packages stuff!

This taste alot better than the little packets.  I left out the onion powder, didn't have any.  I also added about 1/4c of the taco salsa when I add the seasoning for an extra kick.

There are already so many positive reviews, but I thought I'd put my 2 cents in...THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL COMINATION OF SPICES FOR THE PERFECT TACO.  I used a pound of ground turkey, browned with green bell peppers and drained.  I added this Taco Seasoning and a can of Tomatoes.  Oh yeah, I also used the Whole Wheat Wraps also on this site and I have just made a new family tradition! These are the most wonderful gound meat tacos.

Wow!  This turned out perfect!  The whole recipe acts as one packet of seasoning.  I think the spice portions were perfect, and did not need to modify any of it!  I've made it twice now, one time being a 1/4 batch to flavor refried beans for a dip.  Wonderful!

This recipe is absolutely incredible.  I pulled it off the website about a year ago and I've never bought commercial taco seasoning since.  It tastes so much better and you can actually pronounce all the ingrediants in it.  I usually add this and 1/2 cup water to 1 pound ground meat and let it cook for about 10 minutes.  Try it on ground turkey meat instead of ground beef for tacos.  It's not greasy and it tastes awesome.

The whole faily loved this seasoning.  I cut the chili powder down a bit, since I don't like it too spicy.  Even the kids ate it.  Definitely better than store-bought!!

Great! As printed, its good for 1 lb but I made a ton and put it in an airtight container.  Easy to make, yummy, and the husband says even better than the packaged stuff - a little spicier in his mind!

I have to give this five stars...my husband, who doesn't care for tacos and will barely touch them when I make them, said this was way better than any of the packaged seasonings I had used in the past.  He ate four tacos this evening (a record for him).

Fabulous recipe.  Used it with Ground Turkey for tacos and I was thrilled with how much better it was than store bought.  The flavor comes from the seasonings, not the salt and additives.  I also used it with some sliced chicken breast along with green and red peppers.  Tossed in some lime juice and had fantastic fajitas.  It's a keeper!

Delicious and spicy.  Love the fact that there is only a tiny bit of sodium and nothing artificial.  Much healthier option!  Served with extra lean ground beef, red. fat sour cream, cheese/salsa and soft corn tortillas

This was excellent! I especially like how there is no MSG or other preservatives. I also added a bit of cinnamon. I could eat tacos every day!

This is the best seasoning blend. I will never buy the package again. Much better flavor and so easy to make. Have almost all of the seasonings on hand. Takes little time to make. I used all of it for the salsa chicken. Very good.

This was an excellent blend of seasonings for tacos.  My husband thought it was better than the seasoning packets.  I will never buy another packet again.  I will however experiment with this recipe to make fit our taste buds.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe.

Much better, cheaper and more flavourful than the packaged stuff. Less sodium, too. I also like that I can control the heat. Excellent seasoning blend.

Good starting point.  After a few tries I settled on half the paprika, salt and pepper.  I also remove the crushed red pepper flakes and cumin entirely.

This seasoning turned out perfect - and I love the fact that I know exactly what's going into and can tweak it as needed (i.e. less salt, or more heat, etc).

Mixed up a big batch of this, leaving out the salt, and have used it in just about every Mexican dish we've had since.  So nice to have on hand and be able to reach for just the one spice jar in the cabinet.

I was so excited to make my own taco seasoning! Now I can save that 50 cents at the store, ha ha. It tasted a lot like store-bought, though not identical. I may consider leaving out a little bit of the salt next time and some might not like the hotness of the red pepper. Will definitely be using this in the future!

Quadrupled the recipe to have it ready-made and on hand when I need it.  Used it in the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup from this site, using 3T (per other reviewers recommending 2-1/2 to 3T equaling a packet of seasoning).  Worked great!  Thank you, Bill!

I even had to improvise with it a little bit because I was missing some of the ingredients and it still turned out good.  I think this is an excellent recipe.

good...but be careful with the red pepper...it can accidentally make your taco meat too hot to handle (or eat)!

Pretty good.  It's tastes just like the packaged seasoning, but with kick.  And as someone who loves spicy food, it was a LOT of kick.  I prepared this using 1 lb. of ground beef, so next time I'll either use more meat or less seasoning.  Definitely a great alternative if you are looking for the packaged seasoning taste.

I use this from now on instead of the 'seasoning packets' you get at the store.  I thicken mine with a little cornstarch dissolved in water.  Great for tacos and nachos!

I used a mortar and pestle to combine all of the ingredients.  I added this mixture to about two pounds of ground beef and a large chopped onion.  I added extra paprika and chili powder.  The taco filling leaves you with a comfortable warm feeling in your mouth.

Perfect! I will never buy taco seasoning again...this is a great way to avoid fillers, artifical colors, and preservatives.  I think if I were to use with tacos I would add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce, but I used this in a casserole in place of plain chili powder and it was just right!

Tasted great and easy to double.  Even the children loved it.  It does need a little liquid, 1/2 cup water or beef broth works well.

Yay!  Due to an MSG allergy, I steer clear of packaged spice mixes.  Now I can make my own! It was so easy. My only change was to use Spanish Hot paprika instead of the plain old American stuff. Used this with a 7 Layer Taco Dip recipe also from this site and the two together were a hit!

I wish I had known of this recipe sooner!  It tastes just like the seasoning packets, only I can pronounce all of the ingredients in it!  I added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch for thickening.  And I only had onion salt, not powder, so I substituted it and decreased the amount of salt.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! Just made this today and can't get over how great this is! Not only is it very tasty, it is economical and you know exactly what you are getting. No unpronouncable ingredients that are in the store bought packets. I put a little bit of this in with sour cream just to taste it and I wanted to get the tortilla chips out and dig in! Thanks for the post!

I do not like to use taco seasoning packets when making tacos because it's just too much seasoning.  This recipe is perfect.  I put it in a shaker and use as much (or little) as I want for seasonings in all of my mexican style dishes.  I could buy a packet and do the same thing, but why spend the money when I've already got the spices in my cabinet!

Wow! I tried this tonight as I was out of taco seasoning and like everyone else, won't be going back! I liked it better. I did modify a bit for my heat sensitive kids...3/4 tsp med chili powder, 1/8 tsp ground red pepper (didn't have crushed), and had no onion powder so just used 1 1/2 tsp onion salt instead of salt. I love that I can modify. It was a little hotter than mild and tasted wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a definite keeper. I used this seasoning to make Taco Soup for a woman who just got out of the hospital, so I didn't want to make it too spicy. I left the red pepper flakes out and did as other reviewers suggested and cut the salt in half. Didn't have sea salt -- just used regular and it turned out great! Very authentic flavor and very quick and easy to make. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is real good.  I will never buy the package stuff again.  I've grown tired of the taste and texture of the premixed packages and this is much better  Anyone watching salt intake should try this, I;m sure it hass much less salt.

I bought the shells, the beef, the sour cream, the cheese...but I forgot the TACO SEASONING!! I found such positive reviews for this recipe I thought I'd try it! I will NEVER buy a package again. THis was perfect. I didn't have any oregano on hand so left it out...it was great anyway!

I leave out the crushed red pepper flakes.  Other than that, this is a perfect taco seasoning recipe.  I haven't been able to tell this apart from the store bought stuff.  Plus it's cheaper and healthier.  A great recipe to have around.

This was a great seasoning mix, just as good as the packets if not better.  Plus my son can't eat most packaged taco seasoning since it contains wheat and he's allergic, so this is great for him.  I use the entire recipe plus 3/4 cup of water with my browned ground beef.  Yummy!

Update: It's 4 years later and this is still my go-to recipe for taco seasoning!  I can't tell you the last time I used a store-bought packet.  I mix up a quadruple batch at a time and store it in an airtight container so I have it on hand.  Love this recipe!

This is delicous!!  So much healthier than the store bought stuff, and I was able to make it a little spicier for DH and I, while keeping it mild for the kids.  A definate plus!  I used this in place of the packaged taco seasoning in a taco salad listed on this site (Taco Salad I) and it was great in that too.

I have made this about 15 times now and I love it.  It is sooo much better than the prepackaged and I can adjust it to my family's palate.  I did cut the salt in half and I omit the onion because my picky husband won't eat it!

I really like this taco seasoning over the packaged stuff you get in the store.  I left out the red pepper flakes as it would probably be too hot for my kids.

This is great to have on hand to use as seasoning for tacos, dips, chili. I make a big amount and keep it an empty shaker.

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe for 2 lbs of hamburger to use for Taco Salad. It is quite spicy, even using scant measurements. I added 3/4 cup water to the (2 lbs) meat.

My 13 yo son just LOVES this meat! Much better than any packaged kind.

To make it thicken the way the packet seasoning does, add 1/4 cup of corn flour or fine cornmeal to the mix. And to make it authentic, use Mexican Oregano - a spice that is available usually in small packets in the Mexican section of the grocery store.

Great taco seasoning, Bill. Wow, it tastes great, was easy to make, and even more economical if you make it in large batches. My whole family loved it, even my picky 10 year old daughter. I've got to join the chorus on this one, singing "I'll never buy the store packets again...No more packets for me!"

This is really good, and since it doesn't have flour (like some of the other recipes AND the prepackaged stuff), it's much better for low carb diets.

Excellent taco seasoning. I used this recipe to make Beth's Tex Mex Dip. The mix of seasonings was perfect...just like the package mix you buy at the store. I will try this recipe next time for tacos. Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  It was great that we had all the ingredients, and that it contained no extras like msg, flour and cornstarch.  IT made great tacos and we will never buy the premade stuff again.

What a great recipe! I needed taco seasoning and didn't want to go to the store so I made this. It was easy to put together and tasted great! No one in my family noticed the difference. I did the the onion powder out, only because I didn't have it on hand, it still tasted fine.

This spice mix tasted just like the packets you would buy from the store.  I felt better knowing that there was alot less sodium than in regular mixes.  I will defintely use this recipe again!

This is so good for tacos and other mexican recipes. Any time a recipe calls for taco seasoning, I use this recipe. One thing I do change is that I use regular salt instead of sea salt. I always have everything I need on-hand too.

OK but not quite like the type you buy in a package at the store.  In a pinch it was fine, but I think I prefer the store packages.

Made really good taco meat. I used 6 lbs 80/20 ground beef, drained completely, then added back some fat to taste. My wife used for walking tacos with her students, and they loved it.

I'll never go back to packaged taco seasoning again.  I use turkey meat in place of beef alot so I doubled the recipe list and it was perfect for 3 lbs.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and just like everyone else says, it was way better than the store bought packets and it has a deeper flavor. We liked it so much that  I made a big cannister of it!

This is a really good taco seasoning recipe. My grandson made it. He’s 11. We used 2.25 lbs of lean ground beef. He doubled the seasoning recipe. Before I knew it, he dumped the whole bowl of seasoning in the meat. We added water until it just covered the meat, brought it to a boil, then cooked on low until the liquid evaporated. Just a little spicy for me and baby girl; however, the flavor was delicious. Everyone else loved it as is.

Perfect. My very picky 9 year old daughter said " Mom, I think I should eat this meat more often". Enough said...I will definitely  be using this seasoning  more often.  Thanks for the recipe.

This flavourful mix works great in my chilli con carne and tacos.  It’s a smart idea that not only saves me money , it reduces  landfill waste. I'll buy ingredients in bulk and mix up a jar full.

I went to the cupboard to make my taco seasoning when I saw I was out of maltodextrin. Found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. Did not change a thing and it passed the wife's taste test with flying colors. For her taste it could use a little less red pepper flakes but otherwise she liked my “experiment”. Like so many others this will be my go to taco seasoning. Thanks for this recipe.

I first found this 5 years ago and have never turned back. I do add a smidgen of cayenne and a dash of ground mustard to the mix. If using for chicken I add a tad of dried lemon peal. The suggestion of using 3 TBSP per pound and mixing a bit of flour before dusting the meat is what I do as well. Tastes better then any mix in the store. Happy cooking!

Will never use any prepackaged taco seasoning ever after using this.  I’ve made it more times than I can think and it is always very flavorful.  I made it just as directed in the recipe and you don’t need to change a thing.  I make at least 30 times the quantity of the original recipe to always have it on hand and store in a sealed mason jar.

it really is better than the packets! I find that one recipe gives a nice, strong flavor to one pound of hamburger. cook the meat, drain thoroughly, add this mix and 3/4 cup water. cook off most of the water.
I used cayenne instead of chili flakes; omit to make less spicy.

I followed the recipe except for a few recommended changes.  1/2 the amount of salt and used table salt.  I used the flour recommendation (2 tsp) and used 1/3 cup of water.  Not enough ‘gravy’ like so mixed 2 tsp cornstarch with 1/3 cup of water and added that in,,,,,, thickened it up well.   Also omitted the red pepper flakes as the teenagers didn’t want the spice and even with that omission it was still slightly sticky.   I used these recipes amounts for 2 lbs of meat and the seasoning ratio was perfect.

Awesome seasoning that’s much better than the packets. I followed the recipe to the letter (aside from adding more cayenne bc I like heat). I doubled the recipe to have extra for the future. Great recipe!

Excellent! I'm in charge of beef taco meat for taco Tuesday at a church function we frequently have and found this tastes so much better than the well known packet version. I make 5 lbs ground beef and use almost the 45 serving amount. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

The best taco seasoning!  I swapped the crushed red pepper for cayenne and only add about 1/4 cup water as I like my tacos on the dry side.  I would NEVER buy packaged taco seasoning now.  No preservatives, easy, and ingredients I always have on hand.

I wasn't sure how much I would like this taco seasoning without the maltodextrin, dextrose, and unspecified "natural flavors" of the packaged kind, but it was SO good! I like mine hot and spicy, so there was a bit more paprika and some powdered southwestern pepper seasoning. Made it with grass-fed beef--absolutely delicious! I'll make this from now on.

I've made this Taco Seasoning Mix 2 times now.  I make it in a large batch and use as needed.  I am Keto, so this mix works well with restricted carbs.  I do add a pinch of Xanthum Gum (keto friendly thickener) to slightly thicken when added to water and cooked ground beef for tacos.  Like other reviewers, I upped the garlic and onion powders a bit -- rounded teaspoons -- I also added 1/2 teaspoon cilantro flakes and a pinch of Xanthum Gum.   I use 2 Tablespoons of this mix (very slightly rounded Tablespoons)  and 3/4 cup water to 1 lb of hamburger.  We love it, it's Keto friendly, it's cheaper, healthier and tastier than the packaged kind!!!  Thank you Bill Echols!!

I followed the recipe (with the exception of salt) and found it way to salty, and I never added the salt,  and I am not sure if the oregano should even be in this recipe, this simply does not taste like taco seasoning.  I never rate or comment on recipes, until now,  but this cost me 1# of ground beef and the spices that I wasted,  I have never had such a disaster of a meal from this site, I am not sure what your Taco Bell uses for seasoning, but my Taco Bell's  recipe is not anything close to this.  Please save your time and go to your local supermarket and buy the package stuff !

Tried it tonight. I think I was oversold on it. I even tried one of the rater's suggestions to add flower and water to it. While it makes a very good base to work from, it needed work to make it taste comparable to prepackaged stuff, and a little more work to take it over that edge.

Very good! I added 1/4 tsp cayenne. Once ground beef is browned and drained, I added the spices, cooked for a few minutes, added some water and tomato paste until it created a little sauce. Will never buy taco spice packets again!

I upped the cumin by 1/2 tsp because it’s a spice I like a lot but made no other changes the first time I put this together. The crushed red pepper flakes were too much for me so I left it out on my second batch and it’s perfect! I will never go back to pre-packaged taco seasoning with its fillers and preservatives.

Very Very Good! Makes enough in this recipe(3Tbs) for 1lb of meat so actually making more right now to have on hand in the cupboard.  We had this last night when I made tacos & my guest wiped them out. I left out the red pepper flakes bc we had Hot Taco sauce that we were using on top. I also ground my own peppercorns & cumin seeds.

I made this for a recipe of Mexican Beef & Rice. I used 2 Tbsp of seasoning mix & it was great (the recipe called for 1 oz)
I won’t bother looking for any other blend recipe, this one is good!

This is an excellent seasoning. It is incredibly spicy just an FYI, so if you do not like it as spicy I would suggest reducing the chili powder.

Tastes much better than the packets, and no MSG and I control the salt!  Awesome recipe, and I cut the salt in half and use on ground turkey. I make a triple recipe and keep in a container to keep it on hand for a quick dinner.

I have never made my own taco seasoning before and this is amazing. Once you mix everything it smells like you're really having the tacos your parents made when you were a kid. . But for adults (with increased heat).

I made this tonight for seasoning my chili Mac. The recipe I use calls for a packet of taco seasoning but I was all out. This recipe was first to show up when I googled. I followed it exactly, putting all the ingredients into the dish. I had 1lb of hamburger meat in the dish. Honestly, the meal tasted 10x better than using a packet of taco seasoning. I was afraid that since I added all the seasoning to the dish that it would be to salty or the flavor would be to intense. The only complaint my family had was that it was to spicy. Next time I’ll mix the seasoning in a bowl first and use a little less, or cut back on the pepper/chili flakes. Definitely a keeper!!

I made your taco seasoning for beef tonight and it was just great   1 Tablespoon per lb.  My 10 yr old granddaughter just loved it also.  Plus I don't get the unknown ingredients that are in commercial seasoning.

I will make again. I made some changes to suit a toddler: omitted the pepper flakes and used half of the chilli powder. Also I didn’t have sea salt on hand so used half a teaspoon of table salt. It was a tad saltier than I would’ve liked. However, I will definitely use this over and over again. Totally beats the prepackaged stuff. Also, I added water once I added spice to the browned beef and let it boil down, I didn’t see a need for any thickener. Thank you for the amazingly easy and tasty spice mix!

A very good blend! I will make this again, for sure. I used it to finish my thanksgiving turkey leftovers. Added this blend and some salsa, wrapped in a large tortilla, was a great way to finish the bird. Thanks.

Very good!  We cut the salt down by almost half, added 1.5 teaspoons sugar to the recipe and it caramelized the dry rub on skinless boneless chicken thighs very nicely on a hot grill!  We shredded them later for soft shell tacos and family members unanimously agreed it was the best taco seasoning we've ever had.

I like more spice so used 2 tablespoons of chili powder. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of curry powder, 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of  Southwest Chipotle Mrs Dash.

I love this recipe! It is hard to find a low sodium taco seasoning in stores, so I always make my own and leave out the salt. This recipe tastes great without adding even a tiny hint of salt, so that's a win for me.

I followed the recipe to the T, the only thing I leave out is the crushed red pepper as I think it doesn’t make much of a difference. This recipe is great just as it is. (With ir without the crushed red pepper :-] )

Excellent recipe; I followed the directions explicitly however, I added one tsp of Beef granules and 1/2 tsp Annatto for color. It was spot on. My wife said she liked it better than the package mix and my daughter came back fo seconds.

Tasted just like the package one. Was perfect since we have a daughter with celiac and prefer homemade mixes. The baked 3 layer bean dip was perfect with this version of taco seasoning. Will be using often!!

Loved this seasoning blend!  Only changes I made based on other reviews were cutting the salt and pepper in half (1/2 tsp each).  I used the entire recipe with one pound ground beef and 3/4 cup water.

The first time I made it, it was too spicy and too salty for my taste on ground turkey. The second time I made it, I did not add the red pepper flakes and I only used 1 tsp of Cumin and I only added 1/2 of the salt. I also used 1/2 tsp of Smoked Paprika in addition to the regular Paprika.  I used 2T of the seasoning for 1 lb of Ground Turkey. It was delicious!

Once you make fresh taco seasoning you'll never go back to store bought. So good. I like to use Turkey meat  then add fresh chopped onions to the meat. I go easy on the salt and then add later if needed.

This has become my go-to taco seasoning for quick weeknight tacos, or crockpot Tacos. I usually add a dash of chipotle chili powder for more spicy flavor!

I used this exact recipe and added it to one pound of cooked ground beef, a can of black beans, and about eight ounces of tomato sauce and it made incredible tacos.  They would be a little spicy for kids but they are perfect for teens and adults.

This is the only taco seasoning my family has used in years. I just cut back on the salt by about half and slap a bit more garlic powder in then I adjust salt at the end.  I make about 8x the amount of the recipe at a time and store it in an old chili powder container with the recipe taped to the outside of it. We use 1 heaping tablespoon per pound of meat approximately.  It's wonderful.

Great mix of flavors. I think this is fine to use just as is, and especially for people who can't handle a lot of spice.  I added the whole thing to a mexican-inspired stew of roughly 4 cups of liquid. After tasting I found it was very good but decided to double the cumin and the oregano to bring those flavors out more-so.

Very inexpensive to make since I already have all the spices on hand. I store it in an empty spice container with a shaker lid. Sprinkle on just what I need when I need it. Perfect.

No changes, used to season 2.25 lbs ground beef (fat drained) with 1/2 C H2O.  Perfect.

This taco seasoning was fantastic! It was more flavorful than the packaged store bought seasoning and less salty. I was surprised that I could taste such a big difference.

I do less pepper because we have a toddler eating this with us- and it is delicious!!!! I never take the time to make a bunch ahead but it's easy to throw together while your burger is cooking
 I add this whole blend in with 2/3 cup of water for 1 pound of burger

I liked this recipe, but definitlely needed to add a packet of sazon with it to give it a little bit of a cilantro taste that it's missing.

I've made this a couple times and getting ready to make another batch today. This is quick becoming my must-have seasoning for all dishes Mexican. Bonus is there's no flour fillers or anything - just seasoning!

I've found it great even when used liberally and have used on both ground Turkey and Beef. Looking to try today in a basic rice dish...

I add a little crushed beef bouillon and cornstarch. It makes it similar in consistency to a packaged taco mix.

I added 1/2 tsp flour and used cayenne pepper since I didn’t have red pepper flakes. For 2 lbs ground beef I added 3 T. of the mix (no water added). It was so delicious I could have eaten all of the meat by myself! I used it for taco salad. It really does taste a hundred times better than the packaged stuff and it came together in no time. Thank you!!

Made this for a taco bar, used it on both beef and chicken and was great with both. Only change was omitting the red pepper flakes because our guests aren’t into spicy food. Used 6x the recipe for 5lbs of beef and 4lbs of chicken.

I've used this recipe for awhile now.  I double the onion/garlic amounts as we both love garlic and onion. We use it on ground venison - no fat added. I make a triple batch of this seasoning and store it.   I brown the vension, add about 2 TB of the seasoning, no flour or corn starch, about 1/2 cup water, cooks down and is awesome!

We enjoy making our own spices when possible. Less containers and spices we enjoy. Able to omit spices we don't like.

Added a slight amount of brown sugar to tone down the Spices (May have added a little too much). Family loved it. Will definitely make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised; it was pretty good! I ran out of the packaged taco seasoning (I think I use McCormack's but it could be a generic) and, rather than run to the store, I tried this with 1 lb of hamburger. I also substituted Old Bay seasoning for the paprika, red peppers and then added some paprika and crushed red peppers for color and heat.

I'll probably buy packaged seasoning in the future but this worked well in a pinch.

I have made this recipe as is and it is excellent. I have also substituted out the regular salt with Larry’s Seasoned Salt. Either way it’s fantastic and I have not bought taco seasoning for years now. As others have mentioned I just use to taste but I find that approx  2 1/2 to 3 Tbsp is equal to a store bought packet.

Yes!!! We are sold! Never buying at the store, regardless of brand, ever again! This is so much more spicy and flavorful! Not a problem to make, either. I made a big container of it bc I’ll be using it more frequently with the great taste it imparts! Thanks, Bill!!!

Very good, easy to make quickly.  I usually leave out the red pepper for my son and add in some cyanne for myself.  Great with shredded chicken or beef.

This is often my go to because it allows me to omit salt in my diet, and add more flavor at the same time!  To those that have never made your own seasonings I hope this recipe makes you look up others!  Bread crumbs, Italian dressing, its a whole new (better) world than the packaged stuff.  
Love AllRecipes, thanks for this forum, thanks all you PPL for all your GREAT recipes, thanks PPL for all your comments, gives me ideas, hints, additions and avoidances!   Gotta go, time to eat another yummy AllRecipe meal!   Luv Y’all!

It turned out great.  I used it with one pound of very lean ground beef and added a can of black beans to it.  Just spicey enough.  If you don't like much spice,  I think you could add it to two pounds of ground beef.  What is great is that you know EXACTLY what's in it.

I didn’t have taco seasoning and went to allrecipes found this recipe and made it. The family loved it! I won’t go back to packaged again. I’ll try a little flour next time and did add some water but honestly was fantastic without flour.

This recipe is so much better than packaged taco seasoning.  I double everything in the recipe except the red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  I only do 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (or 1/8 tsp cayenne) 1 tsp pepper and 1 1/2 tsp table salt. I don't love spicy food but if you do you might want to just go ahead and double the peppers.  I combined w 1 Tbsp of corn starch. Added it to 2.5 lbs ground beef and 1 1/2 cups water.  Simmer.

Easy and REALLY good!  If you cook much at all you have all the seasonings in your cabinet.  Double the recipe and store it in either a Ziploc, old spice container or a soufflé cup and you're set for 3-4 meals!

Added 2 tsp of flour to mix. Will cut cumin down a tad bit next time to just over a tsp. 3 tbsp was perfect for 1 pound of beef. Simmered with about 3/4 cup of water for about 10 min after draining beef.

Fantastic. I do add a bit of La Preferida Adobo and Sazon seasoning to it as well. Used it to season steak for fajitas and my son, who was home for college even asked what I used to season the meat. I'll never buy already mixed taco seasoning again!

A solid taco seasoning- well balanced and tasty. You can use a fair amount on your meat and still not have it taste too strong. I think the proportions of each seasoning can be adjusted to taste for the spicy and savory ones, but be sure not to go overboard on the salt; I added just a pinch more than the recipe called for and even that little bit stood way out!

Fantastic, better than store bought. I used Hot Paprika instead of sweet and omitted the chili pepper flakes. For a bit more spice I added 1/8 t cayenne pepper instead! Very easy to increase the recipe to store for later use

This was a little too spicy with the amount of chili powder plus the addition of red pepper flakes. I added more onion and garlic powder to counteract the spicyness.  Beside using for tacos, it's good to add to yogurt or sour cream as a dip!!!

Love this seasoning mixture! I always cut the salt in half and only put in a dash of black pepper. Also to help it coat meat (especially fajita meat) add a teaspoon or two of corn starch and about a teaspoon of sugar :)

I can’t believe I’ve never reviewed this. All the other reviews are true,  this recipe is awesome. I make it in huge batches, for 90 servings or more, and then share it with other family. Some of my family were fully dedicated to those taco seasoning packets, and even they have come to this side. Obviously delicious with regular ground beef tacos, but really excellent with instant pot chicken taco bowls as well.

This recipe is outstanding! I've been making my own "taco" seasoning for years, but it just didn't pop. This one has the perfect balance of flavors.
I used it as a rub for fish tacos this week and the meal was a hit. The fish was wonderfully flavorful, but not so much that it was overwhelming everything else.
I've now mixed a big batch and stored it in my pantry. It's a go to for sure!

Great recipe, very authentic tasting - I like it a lot better than the store bought pre-made stuff.  Family loved it as well, even my picky 7 year old.  I did substitute the red pepper flakes for a little cayenne pepper, gave it just a little heat without being over powering.

No complaints but  I did use a slightly lower amount of salt.  I browned 1.5lbs of ground turkey, added a can of diced tomatoes (drained), a bit of tomato sauce, and the entire batch of the taco seasoning and a bit of cornstarch to thicken at the end.  Successful Taco Tuesday at our house!

I thought this was marvellous.  The only addition I made was nutritional yeast flakes.  There was some flavour missing when I tasted it, and the commercial taco seasoning has yeast extract in it so I added about 3-4 tbsp of yeast flakes and that added the extra oomph the original recipe lacked.

I did add more garlic and onion powder (and less pepper flakes because we have 3 kids under 4yrs) because we like it. This is the best! I added the whole thing to 3 pounds of hamburger with some water. Will never buy the store bought stuff again! I love all the suggestions people put on here..will try some!

Very easy!  Much better than store bought seasoning.  Can easily adjust the spice level.

Needed a little extra something to spice it up and add more depth to the flavor.  The second time I made it I added a dash of Habanero chili powder and reduced the black pepper by 1/2. The third time was even better by cutting the black pepper down to ~25% and using 1/2 regular chili powder and 1/2 Habanero chili powder.

Thanks for the recipe! The hubby loves it! 
I did cut back on the chili powder though. Instead of the whole tbs I did half.  Came out great!

Seasoned my ground beef well! I was even out of chili powder with less than 1/4 tsp to use and it tasted great. I love that I am removing any of the YUK from the packaged taco seasoning with this recipe.

I will never buy taco seasoning again. It was fantastic. I used smoked paprika, because it was what I had. It turned out great.

Super easy! Like others I won’t be buying the packaged product in the future. One change I’ll make is reducing the salt as I found it salty but that’s personal taste.

Much better for you than the store packed ones that have preservatives and more sodium. This recipe was quick to make with ingredients I always have in my spice cabinet. I did cut the salt and pepper by half because I can always add more of them to taste at the end of cooking.

Fabulous! I make a huge batch of this and store it in a jar so I don't have to make it all the time. I use a slightly smaller ratio of red pepper flakes and chili powder because I have 4 littles that think anything slightly spicy is going to melt their mouths ;) Great recipe though! It's easy to make and so nice to know what is going into it without extra sodium and added junk!

I have really been straying away from prepackaged, prepared foods, so finding a good taco seasoning that I know all the ingredients that go into it was awesome .. I find this recipe as written is a little too salty for me but I just cut the salt in half and it seems to work great.  I make a “big batch” and keep it in my seasoning cabinet almost all the time.

Sorry I started my review but is sent before I was finished...
I’m Vegan and I tried this with TVP and it came out great, you can’t even tell it’s not ground beef. Just be careful about how much you use. Add some and taste until it’s the way you like it. But it’s much better then the premade ones for sure, especially if you use organic spices!

Phenomenal seasoning that I stumbled upon luckily after thinking I had store bought seasoning at home when I didn’t. I will never buy seasoning from the store again. Everyone loved the taste and they were super impressed I could whip up my own after we thought a last minute store run was going to be needed. Delicious and super easy, can’t  wait to make again!

Taco night... worked late so late start to dinner. No taco seasoning in the pantry! No time to run to the store.... what’s in that seasoning anyway? AllRecipes... taco seasoning... this looks promising. 9 ingredients ? Hmm... are there 9 spices in that pantry? Yes ... yes....all stuff already there... luck changing.   2 mins later added to browned beef with some water and let it simmer down for about 10 mins. Dinner Saved. Family loved. No more store bought taco seasoning. Ever.   Thank you!

Worked out great. Didn't tell the family. They had no idea it wasn't the regular store bought packets. Excellent mix.

This is seriously good as written.  The addition of flour or corn starch that others mentioned really isn't necessary to get it to "stick".   I doubled the recipe and added it to about 2.25 lbs of lean ground beef (doubling the onion and garlic powder), and I added a cup of water.  As the water cooked out, the spices just naturally wanted to hang on to the meat.  I ended up with a pretty strong flavor, which I loved, but I do think I could have used 3 lbs of meat with a good result.  As for the salt, you could reduce it or leave it out completely to suit your taste or health requirements.  

I swear I will never buy a packaged taco seasoning again unless I'm desperate.

How about a warning on the spice level? I cut the red pepper flakes in half and it was still too spicy.

This was great. I was out of taco sauce and this was flavorful enough that I didn't miss it. I did do the 1/8 tsp of cayenne instead of crushed red pepper like someone else suggested, just because I thought it would mix better/smoother. I'm going to make a big batch and I'll never buy the packet again. I also took the suggestion to do a bit of flour and 2/3 cup of water. I like to let it all simmer after I add the seasoning.

I love this taco seasoning! I’ve been using this for 2-3 years and haven’t bought the store bought stuff since. It’s so easy, especially since I discovered the bulk spices at WinCo—they are so much cheaper than buying the bottles of spices!!! I don’t add salt to mine and it still tastes fine. Sometimes I just eyeball the measurements and it also tastes fine (I prefer to measure but sometimes I’m lazy lol). For the red pepper I usually just have those packets you get from pizza places and I add that. Tonight I’m trying chipotle powder instead so I’m sure it will be awesome!! I also usually add extra garlic and onion. I would say if you are using chicken instead of ground beef or turkey, you might need less seasoning. I have recommended this recipe to a few people and they love it too.

This is my go to. Quadruple the recipe to fill the jar. I omit the red pepper flakes and only add 2T of the mix, not 3, to the ground beef.

This has been my go to taco seasoning for a few years now.  my family loves it!  I make it as written except for adding a extra dehydrated minced onion.  I always make it with turkey meat and you would never know the difference.  Recently I even put it on chicken fajitas, hubby and three kiddos raved about them!  This is a must try, better than store bought, no ingredient you can't pronounce :)

Great recipe. I was looking for something to have on hand instead of store bought packages. I didn’t add any flour as I wanted a gluten-free option and omitted the pepper flakes altogether and the taste was just right for my taco salad and stuffed tacos.

Weekly taco night recipe with 93% ground turkey.  We omit the red pepper flakes and add 2/3 cup water and 1 tsp Better than Bullion Reduced Sodium Beef.  Make it with Elle Krieger's Refried Beans for a healthy side.  Super yummy!

Good.  Way better than off the shelf stuff.  Little spicier, though, but the kids didn’t mind.

Way too spicy for our taste. I didn't even add the red pepper flakes and reduced the black pepper to 14/ tsp. Was this to be used a small portion at a time? I put it all in...

This was very good!  I was skeptical with oregano and paprika, wondering how these ingredients would taste in a taco seasoning mix, but all of the flavors mixed well!

I did not alter the recipe, but I did follow GREGSGIRL63 advice, and added 1/2 tablespoon of flour, to the seasoning mix, then poured the seasoning mix over the hamburger. ( I browned one-pound of hamburger and added the entire seasoning recipe to the one-pound of ground beef).  I only added 1/3 cup of water, but do not think 2/3 cup of water would be too much to simmer off. 

It was so good!  I have tried other homemade taco seasoning recipes, and this is the best one so far.

After I cooked everything, I added some sour cream dollops, on top of finished ground beef mixture, and some Picante, and shredded cheese, and left the heat on low for a minute or two, then turned off heat and put aluminum foil over the top of skillet.  After a few minutes, I spooned some of the mixture into taco shells.  All the toppings I wanted were all together, warmed, and melty!

Thank you!

The recipe as it stands makes very little. Almost not enough for 1Lb of meat. I felt it wasn't spicy enough so I added 1/4 tsp of Cayenne to each measured combination. I made 4x the amount and used 4 Tbs for 2 Lbs of meat with 1/2 C water and 80% lean Beef. Seemed kinda bland to me still.

We loved it!! I had put my meat on to brown, pulled out my shells and opened the pantry to get out some taco mix and there was NONE!!! After a minor freak out, I decided I look online for a recipe and I stumbled across this one!! I was so glad, because I had no desire to go to the store. I had all of the ingredients already on hand, so I mixed them up quickly and added them to my meat. The kids never knew and gobbled them up as usual!!! 
 The only tweak I made was add a little Sazón w/ coriander and annato. 
 Great recipe!!

I just finished making this.  Great as I had all the ingredients on hand.  I like the fact that I could add half the salt and if needed in a recipe I can add more.  I had one bought taco seasoning mix from a spice company and it tasted like pure salt

Looks and smells great. Cooked some ground beef for taco salad with it and lots better than the packets in the store. I used all the dry seasoning and minced a snack onion and two cloves of garlic into two pounds of beef. Turned out perfect

I left out the red pepper flakes and cut the black Pepper in half, the son does not like  spicy foods, or black Pepper very much. Every one  liked it, first time in a long while that there was nothing left over, other than the tortillas. Those we like heated with a little butter or butter and sugar &cinnamon.

I don't like my tacos as spicy, so I cut down on the chilli and cumin. But this recipe is great. Even my kids love it.

I won’t buy taco seasoning anymore. This recipe is truly better than anything you can buy, both in taste and nutrition! I tend to leave out the chili flakes to tame it for the kids. Still tastes amazing!

My husband hates cumin and virtually every store bought taco seasoning has cumin.  I made this recipe exactly as written except I left out the cumin.  My husband loved it.  It was super easy and tasted great.

Best taco seasonings ever, and it can be gluten free if your spices are gluten free. My whole family loves this recipe. I only use 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder and add 1/2 teaspoon of ancho chili powder. Totally worth it!!

This is my go-to taco seasoning mix! The seasoning ratios are perfect and SO much better than the packaged seasoning mixes. I even made a batch for my mom while I was home for the holidays (I grew up using the packaged stuff) and even my picky dad liked it!

This is the best homemade taco seasoning I’ve ever made! 
I didn’t have onion powder so I just doubled the garlic powder and instead of paprika (which I didn’t have) I used a 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. I omitted the red pepper flakes as well. And added 1/2 tbsp of flour as suggested by another reviewer. 
Drained the meat. Added 2/3 cup water and simmered 3 more minutes. Perfection!

Made exactly as stated. All I could taste was oregano and cumin. I may try it again by omitting the oregano (which in my opinion belongs in spaghetti sauce not taco seasoning) and toning down red pepper. My husband did not like it either.

How much of the Taco Seasoning mix do I add to a pound of ground beef or ground turkey?
I thought 1 1/2 tablespoons per pound is this okay?

This is our GO TO taco seasoning!  I've been using this recipe for years.  It's fantastic for ground meat tacos, fajitas, taco soup - you name it!!  I make this is a giant batch and store it in the freezer for use.  I typically use about 3-4 tablespoons per 2lbs of ground beef - more or less to taste.    I also do not add the salt until I'm making the meals.

I made this right by the recipe, except for adding a little corn starch to allow the sauce to thicken. It's a terrific way to make your own taco seasoning, rather than buy packaged. You probably could add some dried cilantro for a slightly different taste.

Skipped the black pepper and the cayenne to make it kid friendly and it was fantastic! Reminds me of McCormick's taco seasoning a bit... slightly different but still pretty great!

No changes made, as I like to try the formula as is. It's a good formula I will keep useing it.  Only thing I will change is amount of salt used. Other than that its on point.

It’s awesome. I made a vegan rice dish with sautéed onions, peppers, corn and triple bean mix. I added two teaspoons of the taco seasoning (for about 1 1/2 cups of rice) while sautéing the veggies. I just dumped everything in the pressure cooker. I did add extra salt before cooking. After the rice was cooked I added some lime juice and garnished with cilantro. Not only did people love the dish but they took away the little rice that was left.

I only use this recipe.  This is hands-down the best taco seasoning mix on the internet.  I do catering on the side, and I always get rave reviews for my tacos and Tex Mex chicken because of this terrific spice mix.

I make it bulk quantity because we use it so often & use about 2 1/2 to 3 tblsp per pound of ground beef. Our whole family loves it! Not too spicy but flavorful & delicious.

I discovered this a few years ago, and it's been my taco-seasoning recipe ever since. My whole family loves it. I reduce the red pepper because I don't like spicy, but otherwise, I follow it exactly. Thank you!

This is my “go to” taco seasoning recipe! Love it exactly as written. However, sometimes I will use red cayenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes when I want an extra spicy kick. So much better than store bought packets... and no sugar. Awesome recipe!

I did not add any salt because my mom isnt supposed to have salt which is what led me to looking for a homemade seasoning in the first place. The packaged taco seasoning in the store has TONS of sodium in it and I honestly did not miss the salt in my version. It was delicious!

The best of the best taco seasoning. No clue why anybody would ever buy prepackaged taco mix when this is so much better. Doesn’t need any changes. Triple or quadruple the recipe and keep your taco mix in a small short used but cleaned out seasoning jar. By far the best! I use this on beef tacos, chicken fajitas, and shrimp.

Loved it but it is a little spicy for me as someone else had noted so will use less red pepper flakes next time. Will definitely make a large batch.

Perfect seasoning! I went to make tacos one night and realized I was missing the seasoning. I found this recipe and now it's all I use. I even premixed some in a container so its ready!

Keep most of the ingredients except rarely have red pepper flakes (I know..how is that possible with the sea of pizza packets that usually lie around?).  My girlfriend and I have used this numerous times but we usually use it for chicken fajitas, not tacos.  I know there are fajita mixes on here I just happened to try this one first and we really like it.

I love this recipe and so does my family.  I don’t think I can ever buy packaged seasoning again.  I did use smoked paprika and I also stirred in about a half of a small can of tomato paste.

Sooo..  good! I followed others advice and added 1/2 tbsp flour to the meat when adding seasoning and it was perfect! As written, it seasons about a pound of meat (3 tbsp per lb of meat), next time I'll triple it and save the rest in the pantry.

This recipe has become a staple in my kitchen.  I don't add the crushed red pepper due to personal preference as I've found it's spicy enough for me without it. I use this seasoning any time I need taco seasoning and have used it on chicken for fajitas, ground turkey for tacos, and in any recipe that calls for taco seasoning.

This is a great combination of spices. However if you have little ones or someone that prefers a little less heat in their tacos, I would omit the red pepper.

I tried this recipe tonight for dinner and my husband absolutely loved it. We love spices, we love to experiment and i thought this was a great recipe. I used 3T to 1 lb of beef, added 1 beef bullion cube to the meat which gives even more flavor. I did not add any cayenne or pepper flakes as we thought it had just enough bite to it. Will definitely use this again.

Make it just as laid out except I omit the salt. This way I can salt the beef then season as heavily as I wish without adding more salt than I want. Will never buy seasoning mix again!

Loooove this recipe! I’ve always hated all the junk found in packaged seasoning mixes and with the exception of taco seasoning had stopped using them. I just couldn’t find the right mix of spices to replace them - Now I have!

I will never buy taco seasoning at the store again. The store was out, so I tried Allrecipe's.  It is a ten. Next time I will use chipotle  powder. The recipe as written is excellent but we like a bit more heat.

I took the advice in other reviews, I double the garlic and onion...the only variation is what type of paprika I have on hand... smoked, spanish, once used hot hungarian...had to dilute the heat by making a mammoth batch and adding it to it...  My children are grown but whenever I come to visit the empty "Mom's Taco Seasoning" container is on the counter and I know one of my first missions is to refill...we just can't go back to the store bought version.   It is so versitile, add a little to chili recipe to round out flavor, add it to hamburger soup or taco soup for a nice flavor...heck I've added it to crumbs and dredged my chicken in it! Love this recipe

We recently found out our little one has severe celiac and have been shocked by the amount of things we can’t feed her now. Fast forward a tad bit and we’re finding recipes for all of our favorite things. We made this and tweaked it a bit to our taste likes. Took out the table pepper. Added some minced dryer onion. Happily everyone in our house all loved it. In fact our little one(8yrs) said is better then any of the packet seasonings for tacos she’s ever tried. This will be our go to mix. I made a giant amount and am storing it in a giant mason jar at home. This way we can just grab the jar and scoop out the amount we need per taco night making.

My son won the regional Boy Scout cooking competition with this seasoning!  The boys had to make tacos, and the judges all commented about how tasty the ground beef was.  You'll never go back to the stuff in a packet again.

I think I would double this next time so I will be able to add more seasoning if needed.  I made a single batch and used it all up in about 1 lb of ground beef.  Family said it was pretty bland.  I ended up adding additional seasonings to give it a little more flavor.

I've been using this recipe for years.  My family loves it!  Better than seasoning mix from the store.  I don't change anything.  The only thing I do differently is run the mix through a mini food processor to grind up the crushed red pepper flakes.  I make it in big batches so that I have it on hand all the time.

So tasty and since I can control the salt, I make this instead of buying it, and store it for whenever I need it. We love the flavor. I do make it a little spicier by adding another teaspoon of chili flakes.

I love this and I’ve made it over and over. I usually multiply the recipe by 4 or 6 and store it in a mason jar. I cut the salt way down and it’s still delicious. I use about 1/4 the salt. Excellent flavor. Beats the heck out of the premade junk.

I have used this recipe for years now. Everyone I've ever made it for loves it! I don't change a thing. I use this recipe for 1lb of ground beef, add 3/4 cup of water, bring to a boil, then simmer until liquid is absorbed. Delish!

This is all we ever use for tacos. Guests rave about  how delicious this seasoning is. The only changes we have made were omitting the red pepper flakes and halving the black pepper (we have children who do not care for a lot of heat). We mix about 1.5 T per lb of meat along with 1t of cornstarch (to thicken the sauce) and 2/3 c of water.

I used the recipe and most of the ingredients. I tweeked a few of the ingredients. I didn't have chili powder so I used Cayenne  Pepper. I also used white pepper,  unbleached flour, Lawrys  Season Salt.  I must say due to Cayenne Pepper it was to spicy for me. I think next time I will not use that much. This recipe was easy to follow I will definitely use it again.

I use grilles crumbles in place of beef because my wife is vegetarian. This recipe is so easy, fast and good I’ll never go back to pre packaged seasoning again.  My family loves it. I’ve actually been making this recipe for years. The only substitute I make is I don’t use the crushed red pepper and I sub a dash or 2 of ground red pepper.

I don't like using packaged seasonings because they add preservatives and other things we don't need. I used this simple Taco Seasoning recipe in my turkey taco mix, and it was delicious and so easy. I prefer to use raw chopped onion and fresh minced garlic in most of my cooking, so I omitted the garlic and onion powders in the mix and it came out great!

Great seasoning. I used Smoked Spanish Paprika, and upped some of the ingredients. Added a 1/2 Tsp of ground Coriander. Gives it a nice flavor. Use it with Ground Turkey or Pork. Healthier than Beef. Makes it better than the packets that have all the additives like corn flour, preservatives that turns the Taco filling to a gluey consistency. Adding Chicken stock or water makes the Tacos more desirable.

It tasted way better than store bought taco seasoning but the recipe did not say how much meat to use, so the second time I used the taco sesoning there was too much meat and I couldn’t taste any flavor.

I use this recipe all the time.  I prepare it in bulk so that I always have taco seasoning on hand.  I haven't bought packaged taco seasoning in years.  I also tweak as to what I have on hand or am low on.  Sometimes I add flour or corn starch as a thickener, if I remember.

this recipe makes me understand just how sub par a store bought taco seasoning is! I found this when we were in the middle of making tacos and I didn't have any taco seasoning on hand. I followed it exactly, and now I will never pick up another taco seasoning packet.

This is excellent!  I make a very large batch and keep it on hand for tacos, taco salad or any similar dishes.  I follow the recipe exactly and it is just right for our kids.  I use about 1-2 tbsp of the mix with my meat mixture.  Never buying packages of processed seasonings again thanks to this easy recipe.

I will never use packet seasoning again! My entire family agrees. We have taco night regularly for the past 20  years, so we are a good judge of what tastes good. This seasoning is the bomb! I use it over and over. I do add the flour to it as another person suggested, to thicken it up a bit. Water too. Delicious.

I have used this recipe several times now in tacos and enchiladas. This is such a great blend of spices and for me just the right amount of heat. My go to seasoning for Mexican food.

A little on the hot side for me.  That tended to override the other flavours. But that can be easily tweaked to my personal taste.  Other than that it was great.
Overall a clear winner!
Thanks!

I didn't make any changes to this but I make double batch and jar it in a small mason jar. Soo much better than the packaged taco seasonings.

I can't say enough great things about this seasoning!! My family AND friends LOVE it!  I've been asked several times for the recipe.  I add a little less red pepper flakes when I know we will have kids over to lessen the heat.  Always turns out great.

I made (ground) turkey tacos with this mix. It was delicious.  I am trying to drop some pounds, and this mix helped to season things up and make healthy eating taste better.  I like mild-medium spice and found the amount of red cayenne pepper flakes to be just right.  I also thought that this combination was not near as salty as the prepackaged stuff. I will be making more to have on hand.

Excellent, but I reduced the salt by half. I used it all in 1 lb very lean ground beef- love spicy. When I browned the ground beef I added 1 teaspoon of masa powder and 2 Tablespoons of water. Perfect .

Everyone loved the meat I used this taco seasoning on.  I will never buy packaged taco seasoning again.  The only change I made was use 1 tsp. of cumin instead of 1 1/2 tsp.

I've actually made it more than 2 times.  I just never remember to click "I made it".  I make it as is; no tweaks and my family of picky eaters love it.  I usually triple the amount I make and keep it in a sealed container.

My BF told me to stop buying the pre-made stuff and just use this from now on. I agree completely. Like others have said, if you like to put water with your browned taco meat to create a saucy texture, just add a little cornstarch to the mix. It's really good either way.

Use this recipe any time I need taco seasoning.  We love garlic in our house, so I usually add a bit more, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.

Haven't tried this as written, but I can tell even before the changes I made this probably would have been great without my intervention.  I like a kick, so I increased all of the 1/4 teaspoon amounts to 1/2. And decreased both salt and pepper by half. Has nice mild and lingering heat and full flavor. A+ (if I do say so myself).

I adjust the # of servings (that little divided pie shaped icon) to 100 and make this taco seasoning recipe in bulk. This amount of red pepper flakes is perfect heat for me, a little much for my toddler, not nearly enough for my husband.

This recipe tastes like the one  you buy in little packets!  You can adjust the spices to your liking. I used less red pepper and no salt. No one in my family has realized that the salt is missing! This mix keeps well in a small air tight container.

I have made this numerous times and every single person I have served it to has said it was by far the best! It is a tiny bit spicier than the stuff in packets (Old El Paso or McCormick) but you can adjust that easily. It is a handy hostess gift as well. If you have some jelly jars on hand you can whip this up in minutes. Thanks for this recipe and for another successful Cinco de Mayo. ;)

Fantastic. Chili powder generally has salt already in it so omitted the salt from the recipe. Now I have lower sodium taco seasoning. I also make a batch of 40 servings. Ready to use.

Made as per recipe , good but a little warmer than I like. Doesn’t really tell how much to use. I used three tablespoons per pound of hamburger and wished I had used two.

I made no changes. In the future I think I will use smoked paprika instead of the regular. Love to be able to use as much as I want instead of a packet. And there are no preservatives or "anti-caking" additives.

This was much better tasting than the commercial mixes.  I added 1-1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch and about 1/2 cup of V8 juice to the browned meat and simmered for 30 minutes before serving.

This is a staple in our kitchen. I'll make a triple recipe and put it in a jar.  We use it for tacos once a week. I've also added brown sugar to it and used it as a rub for pork ribs.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor!  I loved that this recipe uses spices that most people have on hand.  After browning 1lb of beef, I added the entire mix.  Then added a mix of water and 1 tsp corn starch to thicken it up a bit.

This is the best homemade seasoning recipe I have tried, and will be my new go-to.  I prepared with minced garlic instead of powder because that's what I keep in the house.

You can't go wrong he re - and you can increase or decrease any of the seasonings to your liking. But it tastes so much fresher and better than the packets you get at the store. Go ahead and make up a big batch (I quadrupled) and put it in a jar for quick use. I've used this twice with shredded chicken breast for a yummy taco night. Just add already cooked chicken and some stock or broth to a pot and as much seasoning as you like. Heat it up on low and perfect chicken taco fillings (or topping for nachos or filling for burritos or quesadillas. As you can tell, I could eat this almost every day.

This is a great recipe.    I never seem to have those packets of taco seasoning when I need them. I doubled the recipe to make enough for a recipe that called for a 1.25 Oz pk. Used the rest last night on shredded chicken for tacos. Previously used with ground turkey. Very tasty!

My son needs to avoid all msg and "all it's evil friends"  (Quote from his Neurologist) .  All the package taco seasonings that I have looked at are suspect because they don't actually state what "other seasonings" are.  I have had this recipe tagged for a while and pulled it out to try today.  I am VERY pleased with the flavor and will be making up more and storing in a airtight container for future use.

Did not have paprika on hand so had to substitute with smoky Montreal steak seasoning.. Turned out fabulous! We quit buying prepackaged mixes because of all the added ingredients.. Love having taco seasoning once again in the house! Thank you! :) :)

I make this exactly as in the recipe and use it to season other dishes as well. It's great with a simple dish of red peppers, black beans and corn. that you simmer in chicken stock after cooking (chicken and peppers only). It's easy and is very WW point friendly

Very easy to make and much better than the store bought kind. The only change I would make is to decrease the salt. I used 3 tablespoons of the mix but it was a tad bit salty. Otherwise, excellent!

We made extra to put in a shaker and I've used it to sprinkle on black beans and to use with our taco meat.  It turned out great.

It taste almost like the store brought one.   The only thing different I would do is use less black paper and salt.  Otherwise it was great.  I would make it again.

The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because I made a few changes to suit  our tase. I used 1/2 T regular chile powder and 1/2T chiptole chili powder.  Used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  Reduced the amout of black pepper to about 3/4t and reduced the salt to 1/2t.  So much better than prepackaged and very easy to make.

I absolutely love this recipe. I’ve passed it on to several friends because I enjoy it so much. It’s soooo much better than the packets sold in the store. Just a tip: I always make a quadruple batch so I have enough for 2-3 dinners.

I followed a suggestion to use less chili powder and I used less paprika as well.  Unfortunately it was still too spicy for my family.

This is a great recipe to avoid gluten in prepackaged taco seasoning & to reduce extra packets in my pantry.  HOWEVER, consider that you should be using dried chili powder instead of the chili powder blend that many of us in the US are used to—that is just a mix of cumin, oregano, onion & garlic.  You may have to look at an ethnic grocery, but it definitely will kick it up a notch!

Our go to! Will never buy store bought again! After years of using this blend, I tried reducing the salt and liked it even more.  We make it in big batches and use with ground turkey .

I made this taco seasoning. I increased the garlic powder to 1/2 t. and used 1/8 t. cayenne pepper instead of flakes. This worked nicely with 93% lean ground turkey and 1 rounded tablespoon of seasoning plus one teaspoon of cornstarch. I added about 2/3c. water and let it simmer.

Since chili powder is oregano, cumin, paprika, garlic, cayenne pepper, and onion...isn't this recipe just equivalent to three tablespoons of chili powder?  Why is chili powder an ingredient?

Got this recipe here years ago, it is the best and I wouldn't waste my time with any others. I make a jar full each time to have it on hand. Don't add salt until I do the cooking to control the amount in each dish. Thanks for this great recipe.

I thought the mix was very good. Next time, however, I will be leaving the 1/4 tsp Red Pepper Flakes out as my children thought it was too hot. Overall, excellent taco seasoning blend!

I was planning to make tacos for dinner, I had everything I needed except for taco seasoning. I will not buy store bought taco seasoning anymore. This was the best taco seasoning we’ve ever tasted!

I would give this more stars if there were instructions on how to use it.  I followed a users advice and put 1/2 Tb of flour in it, then 3T per 1 pound of ground meat with 2/3 cup of water and found this way over-seasoned.  But the flavor was on target.  I have some left over and will try it again but about 1.5 Tb per pound of meat. Also I omitted the red pepper flakes as my kid doesn't like things too spicy and it was still too spicy for him.  So beware if you're looking for something mild.

My family LOVE this recipe. I did make changes, but not much. I used freshly ground Ancho Chile Peppers, and freshly ground Cumin. The pepper amount I kept the same, but the cumin I cut in half because the scent was so strong, I did not want to over power the seasoning. Doubled up on the garlic, added smoked paprika instead of the plain paprika and left out the red pepper flakes. I don't really care for hot spicy sauces. 

Next time I will try grinding up the Cascabel Chiles to see if there is a taste difference. God is so amazing, He gave us a HUGE variety of spices to try, we are incredibly blessed!!!

This is a great recipe, and I always have some on hand to season meat or beans! I quadruple the recipe (adjust it to make 40 servings), and it fits perfectly in an 8 ounce mason jar. After it's made up, just use 2 - 3 tablespoons per pound of meat (or beans) with 2/3 cup water and let simmer until the liquid is absorbed. 

I like the recipe just the way it is, but my spice-averse mother preferred it with less red pepper flakes than the recipe calls for. Another variation is to substitute something like chipotle or ancho chili powder for some of the regular chili powder. This recipe is really versatile, so feel free to mix it up!

This seasoning is perfect just as it is with no changes. I've used it in my vegetarian ground beef and in taco dips. The prepackaged taco seasoning makes me so bloated, but I have no issues with this recipe.

I actually bought spice jars after making this recipe and keep one of them filled with it.  We use this all the time when we are making anything with tortillas.  We also use it as a rub for pulled pork.

Only adjust for personal taste and type of meat- I use a little more when I use turkey over beef. My husband and I prefer a little more heat, so we add a few extra dashes of red pepper flakes, cayenne, and cumin.

I did what gregsgirl63 described (ratio + adding a bit of flour) and also added a bit more onion and garlic powder, was excellent! Better than store bought and allowances me to go way down on the sodium :)

Love this seasoning! Just the right amount of kick to it, but can easily be kicked up a notch if you feel like it. Threw a little oat fiber (maybe a tablespoon or slightly more) with it to produce a low-carb sauce when added to the cooked meat along with a 1/2 cup of water. Give it a try and adjust to your own tastes.

Having never made from-scratch Taco Seasoning, at first I was pretty skeptical as I had always bought Old El Paso seasoning. I was tired of the salt content, even on the "lower sodium" version. Finally, I decided to give homemade seasoning a try, and this was literally the first recipe that came up. I made the recipe exactly as it states, with the exception of using No Salt (a salt-free substitute) instead of Sea Salt... and the results were amazing! It was very flavourful without being over-powering and being able to adjust the amount of salt used was a  fantastic change. Like it hotter? Add more red pepper flakes. Want it for dips and taco salads? No problem! I have no need to go looking for another taco seasoning recipe, ever. Great job, Sir!

Excellent! Love having a healthier homemade option that tastes great. It is a little spicy so I might cut the pepper down a little next time, but has great flavor. Thanks

Perfect seasoning mix! I made it with ground turkey which I highly suggest everyone who hasn’t tried to substitute instead of ground beef.  I made the switch years ago and find it’s more  flavorful. The first time I made it, I used it to make  tacos.  Then I used the leftover taco meat for nachos the following night.  as far as I’m concerned there’s no need to tweak the recipe.

This is a great recipe. No need to buy the mix. I add 1\2 tsp ground Cayenne pepper to it. But we like it spicy!

Awesome recipe!  It is a little spicy, so I may use less crushed pepper flakes next time.  I also added less salt as others have recommended.

This seasoning recipe was perfect. I used it for 1 lb of ground beef. After cooking the beef, I drained it. Then added the seasoning with 2/3 cup water. Then I cooked down the water, and voila! It was perfect. Yes, it is a little spicier than the store bought stuff, but I like that.

I will never buy taco seasoning again. I added more garlic & onion powder. I also added a little bit of water so the seasonings would incorporate well in the meat. I will cut down just a bit on the salt next time. It was still very delicious but, still a little too salty for me.

Loved this! I followed as is this first time making it. Next time I will cut the red pepper in half and use minced dried onion (or fresh) instead of the powder. We sprinkled in some freeze dried cilantro we had on hand. It was delicious!!! GREAT recipe!

It’s pretty good. I’m a total spicey heat wimp. I put half of the red pepper flakes in and it’s still too hot. I will omit that next time.

This spice blend is perfect for taco's.  My daughter loves this blend and asks for this whenever she comes home from college.  It is great for tailgates as well.

Why buy an expensive packet when you can make your own taco seasoning?  I quadruple this recipe and keep it on hand in a glass jar.  Exceptional!

Made this recipe exactly how it says and it's phenomenal! I used 2T to a pound of hamburger. A little spicy but will definitely make again without so much red pepper! Goodbye packaged taco seasoning!

I did make a couple of small additions.  I liked the idea of the one review where she added cornstarch and some beef broth. I remember my mother always added beef broth to her loose meat hamburgers and they were always really good.  Other than that I followed the exact recipe.  Better than packaged any day!

Doubled this recipe except the black pepper and left out the red pepper flakes to make it more kid friendly! Still had plenty of "family friendly"spice and was loaded with flavor!!!

This was kind of perfect. I didn't know I could get such good results from making my own taco seasoning.  I followed the recipe as written except added only 1/2 t salt because I read some the other reviews. It was more than enough. I also added 2 t cornstarch to help it cling to the meat. We are trying to go meat free in the house so I used the entire recipe to season 12 ounces of "crumbles" to which I added about 5 ounces of ground turkey.  It turned out so well. Definitely a keeper.

Loved it! made it almost as written, but doubled the garlic powder & used dried onion flakes, as i had no powder. Next time would use fresh garlic & fresh chopped onions, but this was convenient.  I did cut recipe in half for 12oz of grass fed ground beef from Costco.  will make again for sure!

This mixture was just right. I did add about 1/4 c of water to my drained ground beef and simmered until the liquid was gone. I won't be using the store bought stuff anymore.

I never review on here, but with this I must. Best taco seasoning ever! I completely stopped buying the package brand. Like another reviewer I added it to beef with water and reduced it down. Then I added tomato sauce to the beef and 4 tablespoons of it and turned out to be the best I ever made. I'm going to use it for chili and cheese burritos. Absolute superb recipe.

This is amazing!!  So much better than packaged. We just left out the salt...we don't use much salt...but  otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I make the recipe bigger times ten and then I have a lot to use over and over again.

This is the perfect taco seasoning. We haven't bought seasoning mix since I first found this recipe. Less salt and better flavor. Win-win! Season to taste, too! I batch make a quadruple recipe of this and we always have it on hand.

My daughter (6 yrs. old) love it cause it wasn't very spicy. I added a 1/4 tsp of red pepper for an added kick. My daughter's mother like it with the added red pepper.

Excellent recipe thank you! Switched sea salt to kosher salt. Sea salt is very inconsistent, we had fine sea salt and it was a little salty. I have learned either use same amount as called for in recipe using kosher salt, kosher salt is very consistent, or cut in half when using table salt.

Made as directed, but added a bit more cumin, Cuz I love the flavor. Only thing different in making it the second time was to double the recipe, because I love it and use it so often. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My favorite two things about this recipe are that you can make it up fresh and that you can make it with organic spices.  Well I guess there are three things I like about it:  it makes a tastes taco.

Great recipe because I don't like how salty the store packets are- this way i can adjust the salt with more or less sea salt, and for the spiciness, add more or less or red pepper flakes.

This was quick & easy to make.  Instead of the salt, garlic, and onion, I used Paula Deen's Silly Salt.  Yum!

Like a lot of people here, I reached in the pantry to grab a pack of taco seasoning and didn't have any. Looked up "best taco seasoning" and this one had the most reviews that I saw. The only thing I left out while putting this together was the addition of red pepper flakes. I read through a few of the reviews and opted to add a half tablespoon of flower suggested by the top review. My daughter is fairly particular about her tacos, and this recipe passed with flying colors. She went back for seconds....and me too. I may play with it and tweak it a little, because I love to do that with recipes, but as is, this one is a keeper. Thanks for posting this recipe Bill.

I omitted the red pepper flakes and  I was going to put cayenne in its place but that spice was old in my cabinet. I always put Tabasco on my tacos anyway. I reduced the salt. I threw the entire recipe in the browned ground beef with some water, and I added some corn starch to thicken. Tasted great, it will be my new usual recipe.

Turned out great. I followed another suggestion and reduced cumin to 1 tsp and used 1/8 tsp cayenne instead of the red pepper flakes. Just the right amount of heat for my family.

Was exactly the flavor profile I was looking for to stuff poblanos with beef.  I had already mixed chopped onion and jalapeño in with my ground beef.  By using a recipe instead of pre-packaged taco seasoning, I was able to adjust the spice mixture to compliment what I had already  put into the meat.

I have made this seasoning mix too many times to count. I will never use pre-made again. I can add just the right amount of salt or spice that I prefer. I use for ground meat tacos, dry rub for carne asada, fajita, fish tacos...you name it.

This was good! Honestly, this probably wont replace the pkg. mix for me because there's something else in the packaged kind that when water is added makes sort of a sauce and my family likes that, but I would def make this again in a pinch, as it is very tasty (I would reduce the pepper flakes next time for the girls tho and add cornstarch or flour as others have mentioned)...Thanks for sharing. :)

This is really perfect. I'm pretty certain I'll never go back to prepackaged as long as I have all the ingredients on hand! Super easy to make - I use the whole thing on 1 1/4lb of hamburger.

Best taco seasoning ever. Will never buy another packet again. I add a tbsp of cornstarch so it will thicken when I add water, that's the only thing I do different.

I made this exactly to the recipe except that  I used table salt as I was out of sea salt.  Because I am a vegetarian I used Trader Joe's beefless ground "beef" crumbles instead of hamburger meat.  My tacos  turned out great, almost like the real thing...yummy!  This recipe makes just the right amount for a pound of meat so in order to save time I'm going to increase the servings by a lot and store it in a sealed container.  Thank you for a good money-saving recipe!

Added a little dehydrated onion after doubling the recipe. This recipe is soooo worth the effort. Added about a tablespoon of chili sauce to the meat (3 lbs) before serving. It seemed a little dry. I am never buying those silly envelopes again

I was making the Easy Taco Skillet Recipe and decided to use this recipe instead of the taco package kind. I didn't have crushed red pepper flakes on hand so I substituted Hot Mexican Chili Powder. It still turned out great. I kept the left over seasoning in in an empty glass spice jar in my cabinet to use when needed.

I made no changes at all.  Made exactly as recipe.  Perfect amount for 1 lb. of burger.  I find it MUCH better than packaged stuff.  Just the right amount of salt and spice.  I make jerky and will try this as a marinade.  :)

I left the onion out because of allergies but otherwise left everything else the same. I will be making this instead of buying it from now on! Even better than the store bought stuff.

I like this with double the onion and garlic, double the cumin and an extra pinch of hot chili powder.  I also omitt the salt and use a tablespoon of beef boulion when making beef taco meat. I use masa in place of flour or corn starch with water to thicken as you would with the packet stuff. Really good.

Very good!  Much less salt than store-bought seasoning.  Liked flexibility of more/less crushed red pepper.

I did omit the cumin as I was completely out and the red pepper flakes because my husband doesn't like anything spicy. 
 I made this last minute when I realized I was short a packet of taco seasoning.  It was definitely too spicy for my family and even me who can generally tolerate a bit more heat.  I will try making this again with the cumin and a lot less chili powder.

Double the Garlic and Onion powder and add flour as a thickening agent. Use Spanish paprika and regular salt.  You are now cooking with gas!

I don't know why this has such a high star rating. I used 4 tablespoons for 1.8lbs of hamburger and still felt like it had no flavor. Not sure why? Husband and I are on a specific diet which requires no sugar or preservatives. I thought maybe this would help us eat "normal" again, but alas I must keep searching.

Awesome on shrimp!  
Nice to make up a good amount to keep on hand and not have to remember to find a packet of stuff at the store, which would generally be too salty anyway.   I keep it in a glass shaker top spice bottle that I emptied out making the first batch with a homemade label on it.  Don't have to wonder what unwanted ingredients (chemicals?) are in it.   Thanks Bill : )

This is excellent and so easy. A much better choice than the packet. I mix at least a double batch. It is surprising how much kick that little bit of red pepper flakes adds.

Yum!  Made it as recipe ran short of oregano simply because I didn't have any. Loved it!  My daughter thought it was a little hot but it didn't stop her from eating it. Full rich flavor.  This is now my go to for taco seasoning. 3TBs per lb meat was perfect for us.

Terrific.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I can adjust to the volume of what I'm making rather than having a partially used packet.  Best of all, I know what's in the mix!  Won't bother with store bought again.

This is an excellent taco seasoning! I made it because I wanted tacos and didn't have any packets on hand. This was so great that I'll continue making and ditch the packets. I didn't have sea salt so I used kosher salt and it turned out just fine. I only used half the salt that the recipe called for and stuck to the recipe for everything else. Yummy!

Absolutely amazing. I will never buy taco seasoning again! Followed one of the reviewers advice and added a little bit of flour, but other than that, followed instructions exactly, added to beef and it it was so good!

Thank you for sharing! Very good taco seasoning substitute, I made it and doubled the batch.  Added some dried chopped onion to it.

I’ve making this taco seasoning for  a few years, it’s all I use.  
Surprised to see I hadn’t reviewed it yet.

4/11/17  I thought it was very good but not fabulous. It sure is not as salty as the packets at the store. But it's SO MUCH HEALTHIER than store bought. I read the package ingredients and Maltodextrin is the #1 ingredient in Old El Paso 25% less sodium taco seasoning. Do you realize that is MSG? It's a food additive and also used in soft drinks and candy and many other processed foods.  My kids had no idea I made the seasoning and they did not know the difference. I will next time add some corn starch and fresh chili powder instead of my old jar. I also will cut down on the chili powder a tad. Seasonings get old, so fresh seasonings makes a difference.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of water to the almost 1.5 pounds of beef.  Next time I will make more of this and save it as a general seasoning.

A little spicy, even for my heat loving hubby, perhaps cut the red pepper flakes a bit. Otherwise, AMAZING. I agree with others, no more packaged taco seasoning in this house!!

So quick and easy . . . I had to leave out the onion powder as I didn't have any and omitted the chili flakes for personal preference. Nevertheless, it was very tasty added to my ground chicken for chicken tacos! Yum! Yum!

I tried this out a couple months ago and my family loved it. We've made it with chicken and beef tacos. I definitely suggest adding more paprika to the mix and using nearly twice as much per pound so you can actually taste it. Otherwise, great balance!

I thought this was terrific.  I used it with ground chicken.  The only thing I added was garlic powder, just because I like garlic in everything.  Easy and money-saving!

Great. I made it as listed, and even my spice sensitive mother loved it. Definitely not going back either. I mix up 8 batches at once and store it in a large jar for easy use.

This was awesome.  The only real change I made was to double the red pepper flakes.   I also added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch.  After the meat was browned and drained I put in the mix along with 1/2 cup of water.   Cooked until thickened.   It was so much better than the mass produced version you buy in stores.

Great staple to keep around.  I assume 1.5t cornstarch to this mix to help it stick.  Used it to flavor lentils for a healthier option.

Thank you for publishing the ratios.  Sure, I embellished the recipe by taking dried Ancho and guajillo peppers and dehydrating the peppers in 2 cups of water, saving the water, discarding most of the seeds, chopping the peppers, adding a red onion, red, orange and yellow bell peppers,  allowing the oils to release.  Finally, adding the spices and herbs called out in your recipe. 

I use 99% fat free ground turkey as the protein, which takes on the flavors very well.  Due to dryness of the turkey, I add the water from dehydrating the peppers, then tomato paste and diced tomatoes.

March 26, 2017: Excellent! I would not change a thing. Never buying packages again that is for sure! I made this last minute after realizing I was out of taco seasoning. I used 2 tablespoons of this seasoning to make a  taco dip. Thank you for the great recipe.
July 21, 2017, with food allergies it's nice to know what is in your seasoning. I made a large batch of this and store it in my cabinet for future use.

Added a tlbs of flour with the  mix to the beef and about a quarter cup of water to thicken.   As far as the seasoning itself, I Would halve the salt but otherwise delicious!  

Thanks!

Excellent! I added 1/2 tbs of flour to seasonings and 1/2 cup of water.  Also, I used 1/2 the pepper because my husband doesn't like things spicy.  It was perfect!  So flavorful!  I made a double batch for 3 lbs of ground turkey.

Terrific and easy recipe!  I did (as another reviewer suggested) add a cube of beef bouillon and a teaspoon of corn starch because it made sense and the result was delicious and not too spicy.   Definitely never need to buy the store-bought versions (with all their kooky additives) again!

I always use this recipe for my tacos since my boyfriend and I love it. I recieve so many complements compared to regular taco seasoning from the pack, that I can not go back! I used regular iodized salt and it tasted fantastic. I would definately recommend!

The flavour was just like the store bought taco seasoning package...but, without all the toxic additives and food colouring. I added two TBSPs of rice flour to the mix and a 1/2 cup of water to the meat to replicate the store bought version.

This stuff is awesome.  I'm never buying packaged taco seasoning again!  I don't have onion powder, so I substituted 1 tsp. of dried minced onion instead.   Thanks for this recipe!

I have made this several times now.  Absolutely perfect every time! It tastes exactly like the flavoring that you get at the store. I just make it and keep it on hand.

So good. I will never buy it from the store again. A little too spicy for us so next time I'm cutting the cumin back a bit. This was a dinner saver!

This was delicious and now I don't need to use packaged stuff that never tasted very well. This can easily be adjusted for amount of spice. It does only make 1-2 servings so you might want to double or triple the recipe depending on how much you use.

This is a little spicy, but not to much to handle. We mixed it with ground beef for classic hard shell tacos. It is delicious! I already had all ingredients on hand and  I made a few batches to keep in my pantry from now on.

Followed the recipe exactly as written & then used in a fajita pasta recipe.  Great substitute for the packages of taco seasoning which are very high in sodium.  Will definitely make a double or triple batch to keep on hand at all times.  Thanks!

I always bought the store packets until I was at a friends one day and forgot to bring the seasoning for our taco night. I had been trying different recipes to try to get away from all the questionable ingredients anyway and this fit the bill. My friends loved the tacos and I was hooked. A few of my preferences-  I do like to spice it up with cayenne instead of paprika. I also add a touch of cinnamon (dont knock it til you try it) and little turmeric hidden in there for added health benefits. Spices are good for you! This is full of them. If youre sensitive to salt, maybe cut it back. My taste buds dont like much salt, so I used 1/2 teaspoon and it allows me to make the dish more flavorful with extra seasoning without drowning in salt. Made a bunch of this stuff last night and added it to my spice rack so its always handy. Thanks for my new favorite taco seasoning recipe!

Great recipe.  I made this to use in the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup and it was wonderful!  I was out of red pepper flakes  so I used Cayenne Pepper in its place.

Mix this up just as stated. Add 2T to a pound of browned, ground meat (works with bison/beef/turkey) that had been cooked with about 1/3 cup chopped onions. Also add about 1T flour and 1/4 C water to help the seasoning "stick," and heat until thickened. Just the right amount of heat. This has been my go-to taco seasoning for a few years now. No need to try any other recipes!

This one is definitely a keeper. It has excellent balanced flavors with just the right amount of zap. I usually have to tone down the heat for the wife but, to my surprise, she liked this one exactly as the recipe called for it. I used this to season ground beef for taco salads and it was great. I doubled the recipe and had a lot left over for next time. The recipe as is easily is enough for a pound of ground beef with perhaps a little left over. Next time, I'll make a big batch to ensure I've always got some handy.

Prepared as outlined in the recipe. I thought that you could back off by 1/4 to 1/2 on salt but my family liked. Keeper!

It was good! Followed tips on adding water and cornstarch. Definitely a tad on the salty side, maybe start with a fourth tsp and then add to taste, and I would first make it without the red pepper and add once you taste it. I love spicy so it was fine for me , but I'm pretty sure I saw steam come out my husbands ears haha!

I made a stop at the grocery store on the way to our lake house and got the things I thought I needed to make tacos only to find myself out of taco seasoning and 14 miles from the nearest grocery store, panic mode set in! I opened up my AR app and made a search and found this recipe and I'm glad I did, the author nailed it with this recipe, great job!  I highly recommend this recipe, it matches the flavors of the #1 leading taco seasoning product on the market and you know who that is.

This was awesome! I noticed last minute that I didn't grab any packets of seasoning when I was at the store. Thankfully I am a spice lover (and hoarder), and actually had all the  ingredients!!  I absolutely loved it and my husband also said it was great! Next time I'll use a little more crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit, but it definitely did the trick in a pinch!!

Super good and very easy! I used smoked paprika because I was out of regular paprika but I think it added to the flavor. Also had a little kick to it! Which even my husband, who doesn't like spicy, enjoyed! I will definitely use this recipe again!

I used all the mixture minus the red pepper flakes (bc my kids don't like spicy) with 1 pound of hamburger meat. Tasted JUST like what you buy in a taco kit. Will make this from now on!

This is a good seasoning, easy to prepare and store.  My husband prefers "mild" so I used 1.5 teaspoons to a pound of hamburger.  It was definitely mild but very flavorful.

this had zip without the optional red pepper flakes, I will be halfing the pepper in the future, overall it will replace the packaged seasoning.  only needed 2 tsp for my 1 lb of meat.

I was out of taco seasoning and I needed some to flavor the sour cream in my Tex Mex dip.  This recipe worked perfectly, everyone loved the dip.

I've made this over and over again...the best ever.  It has a nice smooth taste and yet it has plenty of zing.  I don't think any changes are necessary  but easy enough to adjust to your liking.  My only recommendation is to multiply the recipe and keep on hand.

Great recipe.  I added a little more garlic and put about 1/2 cup water in with the meat/seasoning to prepare it.  Made a jarful to have on hand.

Amazing flavor! I truly will never buy packaged taco seasoning again. I only needed 2 Tbsp of the seasoning to 1 lb ground beef. I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper to add a little more "heat".

Um... Not sure Why this recepie got 5 stars. It was ok. I've had better from a McCormick packet. My son (10yrs) who is not a picky eater and comments on everything I make, also said it was only ok. We are taco fanatics and try new taco recepies on a weekly basis. Not even close to the best I've had. Like I said, it was only ok.

Fantastic! I will never use another taco seasoning recipe again! It really takes my fajitas and tacos to another level of deliciousness. The only thing I ever omit is the crushed peppers because of the baby but other than that I follow everything to the T. Also cooking for 4 I normally have to double this recipe.

Love this! My new go-to taco meat seasoning mix. I added a tbs of masa (corn flour) to thicken up the ground chicken I used for taco meat.  Thank you for posting!

This is a good basic recipe, but spicier than the usual prepackaged brands, even though I skipped the red pepper flakes altogether. Next time, I'll only use 1/2 tsp black pepper. However, it's a delicious seasoning and easy to use.

I love this! So much better than the store bought stuff! I use this mainly for my chili seasoning and everyone raves about it.  Its very simple to change the servings to 50 and store in a glass mason jar. I always have this on hand!

As, many others, I will never buy taco seasoning in a packet again! Used 2/3 cup of water, 3 Tbsp. of the seasoning and 1 Tbsp. of flour when browning a pound of beef for tacos.

This is a great recipe if you ran out of your packet  of taco seasoning! We had most of the ingredients already in our cupboard! Except for onion powder and red pepper flakes but it still tasted fantastic without them. I recommend, if you are not one for very spicy things, to lower the amount of chili powder you put in. Instead of a tablespoon, I put in only 2 teaspoons and it had the perfect amount of spice.

Went to make tacos one day and didn't have any more packets of seasoning- I should have looked for a recipe a long time ago. No adjustment needed for the recipe and I haven't bought a packet since.

This is a great mix... I use this for tacos. But mostly for my go to chili recipe: 2 pds lean ground beef, 1 large chopped onion (split 1/2 to cook with ground beef along with this seasoning and other half for raw onion topping) 4 16oz cans of bushs chili pinto beans, 2 can of rotel and 2 cans of plain diced tomatoes.

Just as good as the taco seasoning packet and very easy to prep. We had all the ingredients in our cabinet. Great for the times you forget to buy a taco packet.  I added three tbsp to our meat which was almost all of the seasoning I prepped.  It's not too spicy but very flavorful.

I use this all the time, it's very good. I add a little more cumin, because we love cumin. I really think the paprika makes this.  I've tried other taco seasonings, but this is the best!

How many times do you get started on a Mexican recipe and open your cupboard to find you're out of those Taco Seasoning packets?  Happens to me all the time - and it kills me to pay so much for 'em....  Well, those days are over.  This recipe uses spices you already have in your spice drawer.  I made up twelve portions in zip lock snack bags - so I'm good to go now!!

I love love love this seasoning. I first made it in a pinch when I didn't have the envelope. My hubby likes his tacos with plain ground beef (I know! Whaaaat?) so this works great - I pull off his portion and then add as much of this as I want with some water (I use about 1/2 cup water for about 1/2 lb meat). Let it cook down for a bit and the meat is covered with oozy,  seasoned goodness! There is no need to add flour, cornstarch, or anything else to "hold" the seasoning on the meat - just cook for a few minutes like you would if you followed spice packet instructions.  Thanks!

Excellent, I've made this 4-5  times now. I'll never ever buy store bought packages. Again. Taste excellent. A. Little spicy add and taste. But it's cheap it's easy and heat I'd totally custommizable.

Made and tried this tonight as written. It was awesome! I love salt and I did find this to be a bit too salty for me. The heat from the red chilies was spot on for me but I think was a bit too warm for my toddler. I'm currently making a big batch to have on hand so will put in less salt and red chilies. I can always add more salt if needed while cooking. Thank you for this recipe!! I will not be buying the pre-packaged ones anymore.

This is great as written. It is well balanced, but it's easy to tweak if you like more of  something and/or less of something else. You need about 3T per one pound of meat. If you store it in something air tight, it lasts at least a few months. Definitely a keeper! Thanks,  Bill!  :)

Really good. I cut the cumin down to 1 tsp.  I also doubled recipe so I would have 3 tbsp which is about what you need for 1 lb of ground beef.  I added 1/2 tbsp flour to 3 tbsp of the mix (stir in until incorporated)  and sprinkled it over 1 lb ground beef then added about 2/3 cup water and let it simmer for few minutes.  I omitted the red pepper flakes and it was perfectly spicy so unless you are a big fan of all things spicy I wouldn't add them.   It's so incredibly easy to make and so much better than consuming all those processed preservatives.  This is a keeper!

Very easy, tasty recipe. I used cayenne instead of chili powder and used half of what the recipe called for, turned out with a bit of a kick, but I'm a lightweight and it was delicious.

Just as good as the packages! We brown the ground beef with fresh garlic & onion, drain, add the seasoning, about a half cup of water and 1/3 cup sweet chili sauce. Bring to boil & let simmer for 7-10 minutes. Best tacos you will ever have!

This was excellent.  I used leftover chicken, small can tomato sauce,  small amount of water, can of undrained tomatoes and combined with a sauteed onion. 3 tablespoons of taco spice mixture and heated all together.   I layered with corn tortillas, shredded cheddar cheese, sliced zucchini, fresh spinach. We all liked the flavor of the spices.    Will never buy a package of taco seasoning again.

This was very hot and spicy. It really tasted nothing like regular taco seasoning. The heat overpowered any depth of flavor. I'll try it again without the red pepper flakes next time.

Tastes great and less salty than store bought.  Used it for seasons the meat in taco salad.  I added it to the meat as it was cooking to taste.  My daughter is sensitive to to Li much heat.  I left out the red pepper flakes because of this-still turned out excellent..  My wife and I loved it.  My daughter ate lot of it even though she found it a bit spicy still.:)

One of my kids hate onions in the package taco seasoning, making this is perfect! We all love it! I either got carried away with the pepper, or next time I will cute it back a little. I made a triple recipe and stored the rest. Yum!

Excellent!  Always have these ingredients on hand so never need to buy an overly salted package again.  Amounts are easy to adjust to individual tastes.  I don't find it necessary to add cornstarch or flour, but I do add some homemade beef broth (about 1/3 cup for 1.5 pounds of ground beef)and let it simmer with the spices for a few minutes.  Perfect tacos every time!

Love this! It tastes so good! Only thing if you have small kids that don't like it spicy, you'll need to cut down on red pepper flakes (quite a bit....it has a pretty good kick to it, which I love but my kiddos don't). Also, my hubby says it's a little salty, I didn't notice, but if you have heart problems then you could prob 1/2 it & it would still be excellent! Overall I love it & highly recommend! I did 3Tbls seasoning + 1tsp corn starch + 2/3c water per lb of meat & it was perfect!!!

My son wanted tacos, but we had run out of seasoning so decided he wanted to make some.  His thoughts:  We decided to make this seasoning and I was nervous about trying all those seasoning.  But now that I have tried it I regret ever being nervous.  I loved it!!!  "Now I wish I had infinite meat and cheese and space in my stomach and time to eat it!"

I love this recipe and I love being able to control the salt content. Can't do that with packaged taco seasoning. Today I was out of paprika & substituted cayenne for the red pepper but it was still good. Definitely a keeper.

Winner! I don't buy prepackaged taco seasoning anymore! This is healthier, cheaper and tastier. I make big batches so I always have it on hand. I leave out or greatly reduce the crushed red pepper flakes and reduce the salt for a "mild" and "low sodium" version. Include a bit of flour or cornstarch as some suggested - then add to cooked meat with some water as you would the store bought stuff. Perfect!

I like this much more then store bought packets.   My kids don't like things very spicy so I halved the red pepper flakes and skipped the pepper.

I used this entire batch for 1.5lbs of ground beef and used 2/3 cup of water.  After browning the meet and I mean brown.  I remove the meat and in the same dirty pan cook half of a large sweet onion that I diced and a small can of mild green chilies on med heat until the onions are soft.  Then I add the meat, seasoning, tbs of minced garlic and the water.  Simmer for 15 mins or so.

I omitted red pepper flakes, small amount of salt,  1T  chili powder, 2/3 cup water.  Very good and much healthier than
pkg.  Also used 97% fat free turkey may increase garlic & onion as others suggested.

This is very much like the recipe I already use. I use larger measurements and add the chopped dried onions. because I use it for a lot of different things. I use it on meats as a dry rub for grilling, in chili, to season meatloaf and hamburgers and of course Tacos!

I used this when I made venison taco meat. YUM! With approximately 2#s of meat, I used a bit more than called for, but not quite doubled. Of course I added extra garlic & onion powder because that's my family's preference. With the venison, to beat any of the "wild game taste," I seasoned the meat with half of the seasoning while browning. Once cooked through on med-low heat, I added the rest of the seasonings with 1/2 cup water (plus just enough) to make sure all of the meat would slightly simmer in some of the juice... mixing a few times, I let the meat simmer in the awesome  flavors for about 5 minutes (until I had all the fixings ready)... Called everyone to come grab a plate & there wasn't a drop left. Enjoy! :)

Love this spice, especially for Nachos! I add to sautéed ground beef, top it onto taco chips, sprinkle with cheddar cheese, black olives. Microwave or heat in oven until cheese melts. Serve will salsa, guacamole, sour cream.

I realized I was out of taco seasoning packs halfway through browning the grand beef. I knew All Recipes would save the day. This mix does the trick. I did add some cornstarch and added water to thicken the mix. This recipe is rich in cumin flavor so if you like a milder seasoning, you might want to cut the cumin in half. WAY cheaper than the packs. Plan to make bulk batch. This is the way to go.

Amazing recipe for make it yourself taco seasoning. it's a little more spicy that what you buy at the store pre-made but I like it like that. I have tweaked some by doubling the garlic and onion powder if I want to tone down the spicy. Otherwise great recipe, glad I found it.

This is an excellent spice mix but in my opinion the salt measurement needs to be increased, maybe doubled.  I've made it twice now and both times I thought it needed to be saltier.   Next time I will increase the salt by at least half.  A very easy way to use this is with a Boston Butt Roast.  Just trim excess fat, coat the entire thing in this spice mix and throw it in the crock pot.  You may brown it in a pan first of course, but this is not really necessary.  The spices caramelize quite nicely and no liquid needs to be added as the pork will release a lot of juices.  6-8 hours later, I just shred it in it's own juices.  This makes really excellent shredded pork for tacos, burritos or enchiladas!  Thanks for a great recipe, no more taco seasoning packets for me :)

I have tried to make my own seasoning many times and never really liked them.  I needed a low carb seasoning so decided to try again. This ones really good and will be what I use for now on. Its way better than the premade stuff  normally I end up dumping a ton of premade taco season to try to get good flavor I used 3 tbs of this and just so surprised how good and flavorful it is.  I did accidentally add double the garlic and didn't have paprika so skipped that and at the end I decided I wanted some more cumin. I am going to make this in bulk  and store it for easier use. Thank you!

I did change the amount of crushed red peppers to 1/8 th of a teaspoon, and it is still to hot for me. So i think i will skip them all together. Also i read a review that suggested adding flour which i did and it's great but hot. So we will see how it turns out next taco night!

I followed directions exactly, although I usually tweak up recipes.  I used the whole thing on a pound and a half of ground turkey.  Didn't measure, just sprinkled!  My family likes things spicy, so this worked.  If you don't like spicy, lower the amount of red pepper flakes.  I've now made a large batch to store and use next time!  Whole family loved it!  And for any carb-free cooks out there, this is great because there's no sugar in it!  The store bought brands have sugar, which is a no-no on my husband's current diet! Made a great taco salad!!

I've been making this recipe,  basically as is, for years, and absolutely love it. I'll often leave the salt out and salt each dish individually, and I'll bump up the garlic a bit because I love garlic, but the recipe is still a 5 as is. 

I like to quadruple (or more) this recipe and store it in an air tight container so that I always have seasoning on hand. I use it when making beans, dips, and more. 

Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Great seasoning, I usually leave out the crushed red peppers, and substitute the salt for Lowery's myself. My family loves taco night and we use this recipe at least once a week.

It is as good as the store bought packages. I added flour, more salt and used cheyenne  pepper instead of flakes. I probably could have done with no flour had I used leaner ground beef. I want to try other recipes which are more traditional. Anyway it is good.

I'm trying to get my picky 4-year-old to try new things and *gasp* get used to food groups touching each other. So tacos seem like a good way to start. I made this for dinner tonight but omitted all of the spicy ingredients except for the paprika, which I only used 1/4 teaspoon of. I also added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and 1/3 cup of water to the ground beef to thicken it up a bit. It was a hit! Mr. Picky had THREE tacos! I'll be making this again!

I've used this recipe 3 times now - it's the recipe I stick with rather than buying the packets. Next time I will try to remember to cut back a bit on the salt.  Thank you to the poster.  It's nice having ingredients that I can easily pronounce.  I keep the seasoning in an old purchased Taco seasoning container and follow the directions there for preparing the taco meat.

Perfect!  I needed a tablespoon of taco seasoning for jalapeños poppers and didn't have any so I had to look up a recipe for it. This is perfect for any recipe that calls for taco seasoning. The only change I make is increase the salt to a tablespoon. It's not too much salt and helps enhance the flavor. I quadruple the recipe and keep a jar of this in my cupboard for extra flavoring in Mexican cooking.

By itself a 4 star rating is fair because although it is far better than packaged seasoning and tastes fair, it did not "pop" for me. Try adding a little cayenne (1/4 tsp) and a little coriander (1/2 tsp). I liked it much better after these alterations!

It tasted great, and was spicy enough for me and my family. I thought that the sea salt would make it too bitter, but the seasoning still retained more of a spice than salty flavor. I am definitely using this as my new go-to taco seasoning!

A great starter recipe. Next time I will cut the salt in half, though. Easier to add salt to your meat than take salt out. Good spice, good blend. I'd also recommend some guidelines in the instructions for how much water to add - seems like 1/2 c. to 2/3 c. is about right per pound of meat. Could also use a thickener like some flour.

PERFECT!!  I made it without the red pepper flakes because my family doesn't like tacos to be too hot.     I also tried to leave out the salt, but i didn't taste right .  I added the salt after everything was cooked and it tasted just like I used a store bought packet.

I mixed some up to go in the slow cooked chicken taco soup I have on the go right now. The seasoning tastes great as is and promises to be a winner in the soup. Here's hoping the next 6 hours speed by so I can taste the final product.

This is a great base recipe to make your own! So much better than the packets of taco seasoning you buy at the store that I will never buy another one. It doesn't take long at all to toss this together. I halved the chili powder, doubled the garlic, onion, and red pepper flakes. The biggest change I made, though, was getting rid of the cumin altogether. I find that it overpowers most taco recipes and was so pleased without it. To give the seasoning more body I added 1/4 teaspoon beef bouillon and halved the salt. Very yummy! A note to those who don't love spicy - 1 teaspoon of pepper is a lot! At least cut it in half if you have milder tastes. Personally, I love the 1 teaspoon! I mix all that with about 1/4 cup water and pour over a bit over a pound of ground turkey... So delicious!

I made it as stated except I switched Kosher salt for sea salt (all I had) and decreased it by about 1/4 tsp.  I thought this was good but my kids thought it was a little too spicy.  Next time, I'll just put in 1/8 tsp of crushed pepper or back off the chili powder.  I thought it needed a little more salt but that was my fault since I backed off.  Next time, it will be followed to the letter with just less heat.  I followed top reviewers advice and used 3 Tblsp of mix and 2/3 cup water.  Beef came out perfectly and I had just a little bit of mix left.

So much better than the packers with so much less salt! Even my husband noticed a difference which is amazing.

Very good! A bit spicy, though. I'd cut WAY down on the red pepper flakes.

I am never buying packaged taco seasoning again! This is an excellent recipe. I use about 3 tbsp per pound of ground turkey and I also brown the meat with diced green pepper and onion. Then add 1/4 c. water to the meat so it can simmer for about 7 minutes and absorb all of the yummy flavors! Thank for the recipe!

No more packaged taco mix for me! Simple and quick with standard spices I always have on hand. This will be a good way to try the different ground chiles I collect.

Thank you so much for sharing this excellent spice mix recipe!!! I doubled it and added a packet of Goya beef bouillon, about 1 Tbsp. each of dried minced onion and AP flour, while using only about 1/2 tsp. of coarse Kosher salt. Also omitted the red pepper flakes and used about an 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper as certain people in my house can't tolerate especially spicy food! Can't wait to use this weekend on tacos/nachos!!!! This will be my permanent taco seasoning go-to, as I had every ingredient at the ready in my pantry!

I make this exactly as written and mix the whole thing with 2/3 cup of water. Simmer for 15 minutes and it is ready and much better than packaged mix.

Easy.  We were out of pre made seasoning and looked this one up. Won't need that stuff anymore. I only subbed Aldi's Tone's brand Southwestern chipotle seasoning dry peppers for the crushed red peppers. I don't think they are as hot as the red. Wife and daughter can't handle it too spicy.

Tacos tasted like tacos. As to be expected. 

Bookmarked in my tablet along with your carne guisada recipe wow that one packs the flavor.

Made this exactly the way it was written.  Way too much chili powder.  I would cut back to 1/2 tbsp.  It was also very spicy too so I would adjust the red flakes to how much spice you can tolerate.

Made it for "Walking Tacos'" at book club.  Everyone said it was a perfect flavor for the meat.  High praise in southern NM!
I did change it though.  We love garlic, onion, and cumin, so I doubled all those.  Suggest adjusting for your own taste, but combo is great.

I have made this many times And this my favorite taco seasoning to use. I half the chili powder and cumin for my family.  Much more flavorful than the packs with extra additives and preservatives. Only takes about a minute to whip up. You will not be sorry I promise!!

So tasty. I even forgot to add the onion powder and garlic powder because I was leaving it out for one family member who can't have those and it was still terrific. So much better than packet and none of the preservatives. Thank you for a recipe I will use again and again.

Perfect! I don't add the red pepper flakes cause I don't want this spicy. I'm not sure why people add thickening agents like flour and cornstarch. If you drain the fat from the beef and don't add too much water nothing else is necessary in my opinion. Unless they want it to be saucy.

This seasoning mix is far superior to any store bought taco seasoning packet I've ever used! I did sauté onion and garlic with the meat instead of using dried onion and garlic powder. I doubled the recipe for 1.5lbs of ground turkey and used nearly all of the seasoning, this was the perfect amount of seasoning for us.

I was on a taco kick and tried the Taco Bell mix packs. The mix pack was a huge disappointment, so I found this recipe and was very happy. I did add some cayenne, ground chipotle flakes, and used ghost pepper salt. I like hot and spicy. I will be using this from now on.

Perfect.

When I make it for company, I omit the red pepper. DH and I love it spicy, though.

I make this for my Girl Scouts, and they all just love it and want to eat tacos for all out troop dinners now.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  I have even made it for friends to take home after having Mexican food at my house and they all rave about it.  I find it easier to make three or four batches at a time and store them in empty spice bottles.  Then they're ready to use in your next recipe

If I made any changes I would of not added the pepper flakes, alittle too spicy for the kids. It was delicious though! Tasted better then store bought! I would definitely make again. This recipe was enough for 1lb of ground beef.

I made this as written the first time and found the black pepper overpowered all of the other ingredients. The next time I made it I only used 1/4 tsp of black pepper and it was perfect. I now make 10 batches at once and store for later use. I also add 1 TBSP of cornstarch per batch to thicken slightly.

Realized I didn't have any of the store-bought taco seasoning, and this was perfect. Better than the stuff I usually use!

I have bought taco seasoning for 15 years and I decided it was time to try and make my own from scratch. This recipe tastes excellent!  Has great flavour and is super easy to make. I made a huge batch and store it in a jar for quick use.

Fantastic, was in a pinch without my usual *gasp* envelope mix and happened upon this recipe. Never again will I fall victim to the store bought envelope again!

I doubled the garlic powder and onion powder to better suit my taste. I also swapped ground red pepper for the red pepper flakes suggested. I will never use another taco seasoning recipe again!!

I added a little more paprika, onion and garlic powder. I also added some garlic salt. Overall, it's very tasty and I will make it again. I used two tablespoons for one pound of ground beef.

Better than the scary red stuff that comes out of an envelope.  I made Salsa Chicken (from this site) tonight and used this as a rub for the chicken.  Delicious!  I baked it at 375 degrees for just 20 minutes because all I had was chicken tenderloins, not breast.  I added the cheese and went another 10 min. at 400 degrees.  So juicy.

Tastes great! Flavor without the salt of premade seasonings (I put very little salt when I make this). I change the servings to 120 and it fills a 5-inch spice jar perfectly.

Excellent.  We use this recipe for one pound of meat and it comes out pretty spicy.  Omit the pepper flakes completely for a mild version.  

Like other reviewers I add 1 tsp of cornstarch to the mix and then, after the mix is stirred into the meat, add about a cup of water to make it saucy.

We have been making this recipe for years. It is so much better than the packets!  I like to make two recipes which seasons four pounds of ground beef.  I also like to omit the salt, instead adding one beef bouillon cube per pound of ground meat.  If I'm thinking ahead I throw the whole shebang into my crockpot and let it cook all afternoon.

Easiest one to do. I make a batch of it. Then I have it ready when needed. I use about 1Tbsp per pound of meat. Depending on how much flavor desired. Love it!

Not bad. I cut the salt in half & it was still way too salty. I'm tasting something weird but I'm not sure what it is, maybe the chili powder. I used all of it in a pound of ground beef. I added 1/2 T of flour to the mixture & 2/3 C of water to simmer. I omitted the red pepper flakes & it's still really spicy.

I multiplied the recipe times eight and substituted half the chili flakes with smoke chipotle pepper. I put it all in a Gatorade bottle and keep it in the pantry ready to use.

I made it just like the recipe suggests and loved it. We eat a lot of Mexican food and this gives a lot better flavor than the packets. I will never use the packets again since I can make it as spicy or mild as I like.

Excellent! We triple the recipe and store it in our spice cabinet. This is our go-to taco seasoning. Our favourite is to sprinkle it over browning ground chicken or turkey (to taste - we like it spicy and use about 2 tablespoons per pound of meat) for soft tacos. Add a couple tablespoons of water if the meat is too dry. Serve with soft corn tortillas, shredded cabbage/lettuce, salsa, cheese and crema, and never be satisfied with restaurant tacos again! This is one of our favourite recipes on All Recipes. It's also excellent on grilled chicken breast for a killer taco salad.

This seasoning blend uses ingredients you probably already have in your spice rack and is so simple to make that it makes no sense to buy the prepackaged taco spice. I double or triple the recipe and store it in a sealed container--makes last minute taco nights really convenient. Tastes better than store bought, too!

I just noticed I was out of taco seasoning so I tried this. It tasted almost exactly the same as the one that normally comes in the taco kit I usually buy. Super-easy to make too! I'm making another batch now and I'll add it to my spice collection for next time.

Very good flavor. Only drawback was that a single recipe does not make quite enough for the equivalent of 1 seasoning packet so you need to be prepared to make extra.

This is awesome seasoning. Even better than what I buy in the store because it has almost no salt. The recipe only makes a very small amount so I quadrupled everything and then made it a little bit more spicy and put it in its own little jar. If you use 3 tablespoons seasoning and three-quarter cups water,it comes out the same as the store-bought package.

I made it without changing the recipe. Good flavor. I will probably increase the onion/garlic next time.

I use this one regularly. Not too complicated and it's tasty. It feels good to use a taco seasoning that isn't full of preservatives and fillers.

Great for low carb dieters because store bought taco seasoning has added sugar and fillers.   I multiply the recipe by 4 (makes all the 1/4 tsp into easy whole tsp) and put it in a couple of old spice jars.  I use 2-3 tbs for 1 1/2 pounds of ground meat.

I will never buy packaged taco seasoning again!! This was amazing! I doubled the recipe and used almost all of it for almost 3 lbs of beef, added some water let it simmer for a while and the result, tacos so good and juicy my husband practically licked the plate clean. Hands down the best tacos I and my family have had at home!

This is really good but I don't add any of the chili powder, to make it spicy I add spicy salsa after.  As others recommended, put 3 tablespoons of these per pound of meat. I did think it was lacking something and squeezed a whole lime on the raw meat before I put the spices and it was then amazing. I think it would be a lot better to let the meat marinating with the lime for some hours before cooking it and adding the spices.

I love this simple recipe and it uses ingredients that I always keep on hand. I quadruple the recipe and I use 1 TBS spicy chili seasoning and 3 TBSP mild and it turns out quite spicy, but my family likes it that way. I also cut back a bit on the salt. It tastes so much fresher and more flavorful than a taco seasoning packet.

I started to make this recipe and then read a review stating it was quite spicy and salty so I decided to double the recipe except I didn't add any additional salt or crushed red pepper. 

After cooking I added the seasoning and tried it. Taste was really good but it is SPICY! I'm not a big spice lover but I can handle slightly.. I'll definitely use this recipe again but I may cut out the red pepper altogether. Especially if I plan on feeding it to little people.

As is my custom, I try to follow a recipe exactly to give it a far shake the first try. I did make this as suggested last evening and my husband and I loved it! Like so many other reviewers, I will not be buying store packaged seasoning any longer. I do substitute No Salt for salt in recipes as I like to keep sodium as low as possible but still used 1 tsp per recipe. We love cumin and all the other spices so this recipe is perfect for us.  Thanks!

I made a version without the pepper flakes due to a severe sensitivity to spiciness but it was still good.  It didn't seem very fragrant when combined but once it heated up, it did!  Also added a sprinkling of flour and some water to browned meat when adding the seasoning.

The seasoning is amazing and I love the fact that you can add your own salt.   In the past when I used taco packets they were too salty.

This is my go to seasoning, since the store bought ones have too much salt and I can add any extra cumin or garlic accordingly.

Great recipe! I definitely won't be using store bought anymore. But, if you have small children or do not like spicy foods forego the red pepper flakes. I used it without trying it first and it was a bit too spicy for me ( I love spicy foods) and my spicy food loving little one. I will make this again without the red pepper flakes.

This is our go-to taco seasoning recipe!  I leave out the crushed red pepper to tame the heat, and sometimes I go crazy and double the garlic and onion powder.  I will never buy pre-packaged taco seasoning since this recipe is so good and full of ingredients I always have on hand!

This was very spicy for 1 pound of ground beef! I used ½ less teaspoon of both the cumin and the black pepper. Added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the spice mixture too.  After browning the ground beef, I  added 3/4 teaspoon of Penzeys beef boullion and also added ½ cup of water.  Next time maybe use less of the spice mixture or more meat.

Loved it !  I used this seasoning for the Nacho Cheese recipe in the "Vegan Cooking For Carnivores" cookbook.  Just learning to cook vegan I was skeptical tofu nacho cheese but with this seasoning it was great after melding overnight  in fridge.

This is my favorite taco seasoning recipe. Even my picky daughter loves it! Only changes I made were to cut back on the crushed red pepper to keep it kid friendly ( my daughter is 7 y.o.)...I just added a small pinch.  After browning one to one &1/2 pounds of ground beef and draining the fat I added all the listed spices and 2/3 cup of low sodium beef broth. This recipe is a keeper!!! We love our tacos!

Pretty tasty but also a bit salty! So we cut down the salt to a 1/2 tsp. We used 3 tbsps like another reviewer suggested or the whole amount since we cut down the salt. Also used 2/3 cups of water, brought to a boil, then simmered for 5 mins.

The family really loved this. So simple to make, just the right amount of flavor and can easily be modified to be spicy. I used with 1 lb of ground sirloin  and 1/2 cup of water.

Finally found one both my wife and I really love. The only thing I did was to cut the salt in half, and it still came out perfect. We don't use Taco seasoning all that much, so when we find a recipe using it, we make it fresh, using this recipe, and always get compliments on how fresh our dishes taste. Thanks, Bill for this great recipe

I made this once according to the directions. It was very good. Medium spicy, but just enough for me. The second time I made it, I added 1 tsp corn starch per batch, because I prefer when it thickens a little bit. I made a number of batches and this made it so there is 3 T per pound of meat.

Next time will halve the salt and red pepper flakes. A bit on the salty side, and my husband is a heat baby. I added flour as a thickener as per others' suggestions. Perfect!

We have been using this recipe for several years now. I usually increase it to 30 servings, keep it in a container and are always ready for "Taco Tuesday"

This recipe saved dinner! I had already started prepping to make tacos when I realized I didn't have a seasoning packet. I mixed this up (omitting the salt) and added 1/2 Tbsp. of flour for a thickening agent. I added the mix to the cooked and drained ground turkey with a little over 2/3 cup of water. It was delicious! I will never buy taco seasoning packets again!

I made this exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing.  It made a great seasoning for ground turkey.  I used one full recipe's worth to one pound turkey, adding it to the meat after browning along with about one cup of water to help evenly distribute the seasoning.  Let it simmer until almost all the water was gone and used it to make taco salad.  Will definitely be using this instead of packaged mixes in the future.

I always do as other reviewers suggest--I've learned that always helps.  Anyway, I doubled the garlic & onion powder--a very good tip. You don't  necessarily need to do that if you like using fresh onion/garlic.  I browned 1# lean ground beef, added 1 finely diced roma tomato, a little diced bell pepper, a little diced fresh onion, & 1/2 a can of tomato sauce.  Since I like fresh onion & fresh garlic, next time, I'll stick to the original version of the recipe.  I tasted the meat when it was ready to serve & added 1 tsp of sugar to balance out the flavor.  I think that's the only change I'll make, other than omitting the pepper flakes.  (My husband gets heartburn.) I almost forgot...I'll reduce the cumin next time also.

I would cut down on the salt and add other seasonings.  Included the 1tsp of flour and 2/3 cup of water. It was fantastic. I will never buy a packet again.

This is my go-to starter guide for taco seasoning. I triple or quadruple the amounts to keep a bunch of it in the cupboard at all times. I don't really measure the ingredients anymore, just guestimate and it's always perfect.

Great mix but too much heat for my family. I doubled all ingredients with the exception of  chili powder and red pepper. Instead of 1 Tbs of chili powder,  I used 1 tsp and omitted red pepper flakes. Also, replaced paprika with a smoked paprika for a little different flavor. Kids loved it on taco meat - added tiny amount of corn starch and water to taco meat so it made a thicker sauce.

Absolutely perfect recipe! I add about 2-3 T per pound of meat and throw in some water to help disperse it evenly and cook into the meat a bit. Goes well with beef and chicken! I double or triple the recipe each time I make and throw it in a container in my spice cupboard so I have some on hand.

I thought this was good,  but the cumin was too strong for our liking. I quadrupled the recipe,  with only doubled cumin and was still a little much for me.

I've used this recipe twice now and my husband and I love it. My husband didn't know that I had substituted this recipe for the packaged seasoning the first time I did it and he asked me what I did to make the flavor so good. I will definitely use this recipe from now on. The only change I made was substituting chipoltle chili pepper flakes and Ancho chili powder. I also added 1 tsp cornstarch to the mix. I mixed up 4x the recipe and stored it in a glass container. Next time i will make a bigger batch to have on hand because we have tacos and enchiladas often.

I love this stuff. I keep a little dish of it in my cabinets at all times. Works with beef, venison, chicken, Spanish rice; the list goes on. Works just as good as the stuff in the envelopes from the grocery when you toss in a little corn starch and water to thicken it up! Awesome Awesome Awesome!

Tasted great. Added all of it to a 8 oz sour cream/ one block of cream cheese mixture for a 7 layer dip and it was awesome. Reduced the cumin to 1 teaspoon because I'm not a cumin fan. If I were to brown a pound of ground beef, I would add the entire amount as well. Yum! Makes about 1 oz of seasoning.

Great recipe!  I omitted the garlic powder & onion powder & used about half an onion for 1 lb. ground turkey & about 1/2 tsp. minced garlic (jar).  Cut salt & red pepper amount in half for my family's taste.   Also, went with the advice of another review & added a beef bouillon cube since I used turkey.  WONDERFUL!

I made this for dinner tonight. It was great! I'll never go back to packets. I followed the recipe except for a couple substitutions. I didn't have garlic or onion powder, so I subbed with minced fried onion and garlic salt on the same quantities and halved the salt. It's excellent!

I just found the original recipe I printed in 2008! I have made this hundreds of times and love it.  My family probably would not eat packaged seasoning after all these years. We eat "clean" and this fits the bill!

I added an additional dash of salt but ultimately, I dont believe I will be purchasing another taco seasoning again. It tasted amazing with ground turkey! I used it all on 1 lb of turkey.

I thought I would give this a try instead of using the seasoning packet that I normally buy.   It was great because it used spices that I always have in my cabinet.   I thought the flavor was good and had a nice heat from the red pepper flakes.   It was REALLY salty for our taste though.   I ended up added some water to the beef to try and dilute it , but, it didn't help.   I will make this again, but, for our taste I will cut the salt amount in half.  (I did use the sea salt listed in the recipe and not table salt.)  UPDATED:  7/21/17 Tried again this time reducing the salt and it was much more to our liking.  I will be using this instead of the packet from now on.

I make this recipe at least once per month but I usually multiply it by 6 or 8 and save it in a jar in my spice cabinet. This recipe is way cheaper than buying those taco packets and taste way better! I do only use a quarter of the pepper flakes called for in the recipe because my boys don't care for spivey food. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect!

Great the way it is. It has a little kick. I cooked 1 lb of ground meat, 3 Tbsp of seasoning, and 2/3 c. water.

I made it and also added 1 tsp of cornstarch and/or flour. I also put in 1 cup of water brought mixture to a boil and then simmered for 5 minutes. It was still lacking flavor after cooking it, so I then sprinkled cooked mixture with a tad of garlic salt and it now tastes like perfection!!!

This is perfect! Since my kids don't like things too spicy, I usually leave out the red pepper flakes. I also times the recipe by 4 so I have some leftover for another meal.

I added extra garlic powder,as I love garlic and a little black pepper. I prefer this to the package mix which is too spicy for me. I definetely will make it again. it is also cheaper to make than the package mix.

This is my go-to taco seasoning.  I always have the ingredients on hand, I can easily adjust the spiciness according to who will be eating, and I can control the amount of salt.  Perfect.

Love this mix!   I use it all the time. Very easy to make & versatile.  I do not like spicy food, so I omitted the pepper flakes.  I add a little bit of water along with the mix when I add it to the meat to help it cook into it.  It tastes great on ground turkey and shredded chicken.  When using it with ground beef, I have to use a double batch.

Delicious! I am allergic to onion so I left out the onion powder and doubled the garlic powder. I also left out the pepper flakes and put in a dash of cayenne pepper! Absolutely delicious!

Much better than store-bought seasoning! Next time I might back off a bit on the chili powder to appease the sensitive palates in my family. I also added about a teaspoon of corn starch, per others' suggestions. It's a good idea to make one small batch of this first to know what you like/dislike. I plan to scale the batch up to last me a few months.

I added 2 crushed bullion cubes. I used only 1 tsp of Cumin because I am not a fan of it but a little did taste great in this recipe.  I also eliminated the red peppers since I'm a wimp at spicy things and let my husband put it on his portion.  Am making a batch ahead for quick use.

Great stuff! I like the convenience of the premade stuff but that's about it. This stuff tastes better and I can adjust it to my liking. To make this more convenient I saved an empty spice container and made a bunch at once. I used a 12 oz garlic powder jar and upped the recipe to 125 servings. Made just enough to fill the jar and leave me enough left over  for 1 recipe.

I made this last night with the salsa chicken recipe on this website. I didn't want to use packaged taco seasoning. It smelled great and had the ingredients in the house. The chicken was very well seasoned  Omitted the, red pepper flakes and cut back to 1/2 tsp salt  this time around.

I've made this twice and I doubled the second batch so I had some on hand. I left out the red pepper because I never have it in my pantry. It's a simple, tasty spice mix that gets the job done. :)

I just want to thank you for posting this recipe. I have made it many, many times and everyone thinks it's great. Sometimes I cut down a bit on the red pepper flakes for my daughter, but the rest of us like the seasoning as written. Thanks again!

Strong flavor but the salt overpowered everything.  If I make this again I will not use any salt and a lot more cumin.

This was very good. I made triple the recipe for 3 lbs. meat. I decreased the salt and pepper per other reviews. Also, I omitted the red pepper flakes because we had company, but will make with them next time. Also, per other reviews, I add just a sprinkling of corn starch near the end to thicken it up as, I had added water (habit). Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this numerous times, it is my go to taco seasoning recipe (I can not eat store bought).  I believe this is better than store bought and whenever I use it in a dip or another recipe people rave over it.

Super yummy!  I didn't have any paprika so I replaced with Emeril's blackened seasoning (it has paprika in it).  I also didn't have ground cumin but I have whole cumin and used those without grinding them up.  I also added two tbs of caldo de tomate from Knorr.  I will make this recipe again and again instead of purchasing the packets!

This is the only taco seasoning that we've used for the last 5 years or so.  I quadruple the batch and store it in my spice cabinet so it's ready whenever I need it. We use it whenever taco seasoning is listed in the recipe and it makes a fantastic taco salad.

I don't buy taco seasoning from the store anymore! For three years I've been using this recipe for my tacos and we never have leftovers. I add a little more cumin but other than that I stick to the recipe.

This recipe is equivalent to one packet of Taco Seasoning. I adapted the recipe to make extra:
4 Tbsp of chili powder; 1 tsp garlic powder; 1 tsp onion powder; 1 tsp oregano; 2 tsp paprika; 2 tbsp cumin powder; 1 heaping tbsp salt; and 1 heaping tbsp of pepper. 
Use 2 Heaping tbsps of ingredients for 1 Taco Seasoning packet!

loved this - great flavor for my "taco cheesecake" recipe that called for 1 / 3 cup taco seasoning.  I don't like using the packets and had all these ingredients in my pantry except oregano and it didn't seem to make a difference.  Not sure how much (level measure) is contained in a "packet" but I used this entire recipe in my cheesecake appetizer and it was spot on.  Will definitely make again and add the oregano next time.

I have made this recipe numerous times. In fact, I now just make "batches" of it. It is fantastic, as written, and WAY better than any of the store bought stuff! I would however, consider adding the pepper flakes to taste, as written it can be quite spicy...fine if you don't mind that, but just a note for those that are sensitive to "dat hotness!" ;)

This is it, the recipe I was looking for.  Taco night is everyone's favorite and my kids ask that I don't use the pre-packaged stuff any more.  We like ours highly seasoned, but only medium-hot, so I cut back on the red pepper flakes and use about 3 tbsp. per pound of meat.  I also cut the amount of salt and black pepper.  After the meat is browned and drained, I add some water and the seasoning mix, plus a sprinkling of flour to add a little 'body.'  Heat while stirring until the water cooks away, then remove from heat just before the mixture starts to stick to the pot. Delicious.

Excellent flavor; have used in chicken and beef dishes.  I make mine with no salt to help with limiting my dietary intake and do not miss it one bit.  It is so easy to put together and I have everything in my spice cabinet.

I followed other reviews and used heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of sugar. Brought to a boil over med-low heat and cooked for 20-25 min. Turned out great but needed to be modified.

What I love most about this recipe is it that does not give me horrendous heartburn like the pre-packaged taco seasoning packets. A very close second is how good it is! I confess to upping the crushed red pepper as I love my food spicy.

great!  This is the first taco seasoning recipe that tasted the way I like the meat!   note:  I used "Gregsgirl63" review for more details -->  adding 1/2 T flour, using 3 tb per pound, 2/3 c water per pound.

This mix can be made in minutes and without all the chemicals found in a pre made mix.

Yumm! I borrowed another reviewer's suggestion and added the 1/2 tbsp of flour.  We were out of red pepper flakes and onion powder so I didn't add those but I did add some chopped onion and green chiles into the browned ground beef to compensate and it turned out great.

I pulled this recipe up real quick when I was in the midst of making  a taco recipe and realized I didn't have a taco seasoning packet!  It was so nice to make it from scratch - knowing that what I was serving my family (and some of my kids' friends) didn't have other added ingredients.  I didn't tell anybody about the change and nobody said a word, so it was just like the name brand packet I usually get.  Thank you for this better option!

Husband was skeptical when I said I was making the taco seasoning. "Smells like the packaged stuff" he said once it was done. "That meat is REALLY good" he said after trying it. Anything that gets this picky husband's approval gets 5 stars! Thanks!

Amazing! I had been concerned about the extra ingredients added to prepackaged taco seasoning so this recipe was a Godsend to my kitchen. I add more garlic and onion powder,  but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. I make a big batch at a time and put it into a glass spice bottle.

I don't add the Oregano to the mix, it just tastes off with it. I do make large batches of this and keep it in a small mason jar in my spice rack. It usually lasts a couple months at a time.

Wonderful taco seasoning recipe! I have made it exactly as it says or sometimes I add more garlic, add some cilantro, or less red pepper. Either way its always better than the store bought! Thanks!

I honestly didn't think it would make a difference to make my own taco seasoning mix.  I was wrong.  I can taste such a huge difference between my own mix and store bought mixes!  I love this mix.

I used Smoked Paprika instead of regular and it added a twist.  This stuff is phenomenal.  You can use it on anything as just a last second seasoning to make anything taste EPIC.

I think this is an excellent recipe that can be adjusted to suit your taste.  Since finding this recipe, I never bought this seasoning from the store again, which I've found to have horrible ingredients besides the seasonings, including anti-caking agents, etc.  Enjoy! :-)

Love it. The amount was perfect for 1 kg of meat. I omitted the onion powder because I react to it and used a sprinkle of cayenne for the red pepper.

I made this in a rush and didn't fully read the reviews or instructions like I usually do and added the whole mix to the pan. It actually came out very good! I added 1 1/4cup water and let it simmer down. Excellent blend!

I love this! So much better than the artificial powdery tasting packet. I didn't have garlic powder, so I used some fresh garlic and browned it with the beef. I omitted the onion powder as well, because I had none.

I usually sautee a red onion along with the beef, drain it, add the recipe above but with a bulb of garlic and a tsp of Better Than Beef bullion, and then to finish it off I put 2/3 cup of beer in lieu of the water (I prefer a Pilsner or lighter beer to help bring out the spiciness). Even without these changes this is an easy and delicious recipe.

Good recipe.  Although I think there is a little something Mixxing from me.  I'll be tinkering with it to figure out what it is that it Lacks.

But on the side not, it's VERY GOOD, Cheaper then buying them in Packets.  I keep my Spice Rack Stocked with different Spices.  I also Mix up Spice Seasoning for later use and to Sell as well.

I'll be using this recipe again I think!

Whenever I make tacos, I add a can of refried black beans or pinto...  When I can, I use my own cooked black beans and take the "stick" blender to make them similar to refried beans consistency. This thickens the taco meat without flour or cornstarch, while adding fiber and more nutrients. 

Of course I tweak the recipe to my liking. I add fresh onions and peppers to the recipe.

I love this taco seasoning!  thank you for this recipe.  I usually skimp on black pepper and cayenne pepper because of my children.  Even so, it is very popular in our house.

I have made this quite a few times,  and I will never go back to store bought.  This recipe has an awesome flavor! I always double the recipe and keep it in a ziploc bag. I use 2 tablespoons per lb of meat.

My go to for taco seasoning.  I have shared this recipe a few times and have made it with ground beef, ground turkey, and pulled chicken.  Like other users, I use 2/3 cup water and flour to thicken the sauce.

Serves as a suitable replacement for those store-bought seasoning packets. I omitted the cayenne to cut down on spice.

Love this! Kid approved, in our house. I use organic vegetable broth instead of chicken bullion (I used to combine about a cup of chicken broth, but now I use vegetable for the allergic kids in my house). I also omit red pepper flakes so my non-spice-loving kids will eat it. But other than that--this is perfect! I put it in the crock pot and have dinner made for the day. Tastes much better than packet mixes.

A fantastic flavor combination that beats the packets by a mile! I added about a tablespoon of dried minced onion, and a teaspoon of adobo seasoning the second time around.  I also add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and some beef bouillon powder to the meat with the seasonings.  A hit in this family.

I made tacos last night using this seasoning recipe and it is really really good--much better than the packaged mix recipes.  I did add some refried beans to my meat and seasoning mixture so that thickened up the whole mix somewhat and no masa needed.  I highly recommend this mix recipe--thanks, Bill, for sharing it!

I ran out of store bought seasoning and made this to save dinner one night. So much better than the packaged kind!!! I haven't bought any since.  I usually make a triple batch and store it in Tupperware to get a few uses out of it.

It would have been better except a stupid pop up advertisement blocked the chili powder, onion powder and garlic powder.  I didn't notice it until I went to review the recipe after dinner.

I now really hate the new pop up ads on this site.

Great seasoning.  It's not spicy, though, and I like spicy food so I use extra cayenne pepper and sprinkle in Cholula hot sauce as it's simmering.  I find I need about 1.5 servings of this seasoning recipe to flavor 1-1.25 lbs. of hamburger meat.

I really like this recipe it's flavor is delicious. However there was a bit to much chili powder for me which makes it pretty spicy. Next time I will use less chili powder a little more garlic & onion powder and up the cumin a bit as well.

I am so thankful I found this recipe in my search for making a gluten-free taco seasoning. It is better than store bought and cheaper. I make a huge batch of this to always have on hand. I do leave out the crushed red pepper ahead of time and can add while making depending on how much of a kick I want it to have. I use 3 Tbsp when making a pound of meat.

Better flavor than seasoning packets.  I cut the salt in half and substituted 1/8 tsp ground cayenne in place of the red pepper flakes.  I also added 1 tsp cornstarch. When the ground beef is brown, I also add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water and let it simmer to reduce the liquid and infuse the seasoning flavor in the meat.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. My rating is based on a personal preference for less cumin flavor in my taco seasoning. I found it a bit too heavy. To lessen it, I doubled the chili, garlic, and onion powders, and salt. I ended up with just under 1/4 c of seasoning. I used all of it for two pounds of meat. I just needed to sprinkle a little bit more sea salt on it. I also added 1/2 c of water to the meat with the seasoning, and let it simmer a while. It was very good! Good amount of heat!

Ridiculously good and easy to follow. The original recipe is really good.

I normally do tweak it a little - less ground cumin and more cayenne pepper instead of paprika. I am not a huge fan of cumin and when I put about 3/4 teaspoon of ground cumin instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cumin. I feel that the flavor of cumin is not overpowering of other spices this way and they all just come together very nicely. And I put about 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of 1/2 teaspoon paprika because I like my food spicy. And I really like it this way. Fellow spicy food lovers,  go ahead and do substitute the portion of paprika to cayenne pepper. It works out great!

Was in the process of making taco salad and when I went to get a packet of seasoning out of the pantry, I learned I did not have any. Went to trusty allrecipes to see what spices I should use and thought these items sounded good. I mixed it all up and dumped it all in the pan with my ground beef before seeing it says it makes 10 servings. Oh well, it was really good. It doesn't say anything about adding water but I usually do that with the packet and I think it's a must. I will use this recipe from now on since I have all the spices on hand.

Very good, replacing my regular "taco seasoning". I personally love the kick but since I cook for 5 children and a digestively sensitive husband, I completely omit the red pepper flakes altogether. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Loved it. But I wanted to add my own touch to it. I decided on 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.  It gave the seasoning a whole new dimension and it goes great with chicken, pork or beef.

This tastes so much better than the packaged kind. You can also tweek the hotness by varing the red pepper flakes. I did modify it using much less salt than called for.

I chopped chicken tenders into about 1/4 inch cubes and cooked them just like I would ground beef for tacos. Served in a soft shell with this seasoning was amazing.

So easy. I have my son mix it for me ahead of time and I keep it in a jar. Sometimes I tell him to double it. Sometimes triple it. He loves figuring out how much of each spice he will need and using the largest measuring spoon!! We have enjoyed this taco seasoning for flavor and help with third grade fractions!!

Excellent! Way better that any McCormick seasoning pack you can find at the store. Stick to the recipe and you will love it. If you tweak it like one of the other reviewers with corn starch and bouillon cubes of course it's not going to be as good. You're not even giving it a fair rating. How can you rate it 3 stars when you changed it?

This was an excellent Taco seasoning, my family has requested that I use this from now on.
I did add a couple of things; I put 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch and one teaspoon of Beef granules or powder to the seasonings. I also left out the Red Pepper flakes ( already spicey) and cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon (was a little too salty with a teaspoon).    When added to my meat mixture I add  2/3 cup of water and let simmer for a few minutes.  Yum Yum! Better than any Taco packet or restaurant!

Not a whole lot of flavor.  But I might just be accustomed to the high salt premade mixes.  I ended up adding lots of taco sauce when using this with ground turkey.

I've made several batches of this seasoning for taco Tuesday night. Whether I use ground beef or ground turkey or even chicken, it works great.  My family loves it just as it is but it is a little spicey so for those who may want a more mild taste keep out the crushed pepper flakes.

This is now my go-to taco seasoning recipe.  My son has celiac disease, and so we aren't able to use a lot of prepackaged seasonings.  I was looking for a seasoning that I could make that he could eat, and this one fit the bill.  Ever since I first made this one, I often go back to it, even when we have a gluten-free package in the pantry!

I don't  usually write reviews for recipes but this seasoning did not disappoint!  We decided tacos would be a good meal to make tonight as my boyfriend was inviting a friend over for dinner and it would be a cheap way to feed everyone. I substituted about a forth of a  large yellow onion and a tbsp of minced garlic for the onion and garlic powder.  I poured a little olive oil in the pan and sautéed the onion and garlic in the oil until translucent before adding the seasoned meat. Everyone loved it! Thanks so much!

Fabulous recipe!  I love being able to control what's in my seasoning's especially the salt content.  I substituted 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper for the crushed red pepper and only used 1/4-1/2 tsp sea salt.  First tried without salt but it does need at least a little for our taste.  Will be making this in a large quantity and freezing it for future use.

Good but I think this needs to explain the next step when adding to ground beef.  Use seasoning with a little tomato paste and 1/2 cup water. Combine in a saucepan and simmer over heat until meat and sauce thickens.

We'll never go back to the packet variety.  This is an excellent base.  It was a little spicy for my 4-year-old so I'll use less red pepper flakes next time but the rest of us loved it!  I can't wait to try it with the ground chipotle pepper I have in the cupboard in place of chili powder.

According to my taco loving child this "tastes the same" as the packaged stuff. I ran out today and didn't feel like buying more, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I'm glad I did. I didn't have any crushed red pepper, onion powder, or paprika but I was able to sub in equal parts of the Epicure Salsa Seasoning for both the red pepper an onion powder. I also reduced the salt a little because of this substitution. I also used 3 Tbsp per pound of ground beef. It worked perfectly! Thanks so much.

This is a staple in our house. I Make a huge batch and it keeps for months. (Also a great gift for the cooks in your life.) If you want the conversions for a large batch, here is what they are:
3&3/4 C chili powder
1/3 C garlic powder
1/3 C onion powder
1/3 C oregano
1/3 C red pepper flakes or to taste
1/2 C paprika
  2 C cumin
1/4 C each S & P
Throw into mason jars for storing.

Cooked the mix into some ground beef to be used for a taco salad. My advice would be to make the recipe minus the salt and pepper and then after you cook it with something, add salt and pepper to taste. It was a great recipe, just a little salty for my tastes.

This was a delicious alternative to the sodium and gluten filled store bought packets. I added 1/2 tsp xanthan gum powder to the mix to help it thicken and cling to the meat. Perfect!

I will never buy taco seasoning packets again! This seasoning is absolutely delicious and super flavorful. I made it for a second time and tripled the batch to put in ziplocs for later. I also omitted the salt the second time and it tasted just as great. So far I have used it in a black bean mixture and in ground turkey tacos.

This was spicy and delicious!  I had to turn down my picky five year old daughter for a third taco.  I am on a low carb diet, so this is an excellent new flavor combination to add to my arsenal.  I plan to try it on chicken next.

This is excellent! Tastes a lot better than the packaged seasonings and is very low in sodium!  Add 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper if you want to spice it up a bit.

I use about  3-4 Tbsp. per pound of meat.  I also add about 1/3 cup of water and 1 Tbsp. of potato starch (could use corn starch or flour instead) to the cooked meat to create a thickened sauce.

I had to make this out of desperation, and it turned out great!  I didn't have paprika, so I substituted cayenne pepper instead. It was definitely on the spicy side, but that is what my family likes. I used 2T of mix with 1/2 cup of water per pound of meat. I hope to never go back to packet again. Thanks for the recipe!

Have been trying to use less packaged mixes. So great that I was out of taco seasoning mix tonight, as I went to the computer and trustworthy recipes.com had this recipe! I might not have tried it otherwise, it was great, I had almost all of the ingredients on hand, just have to tweek it a little I think. My husband and I thought a little something was missing, might be that I was out of garlic powder and used garlic seasoning instead. I liked other reviewers suggestion of adding the flour or cornstarch, will try that next time and maybe either tomato paste or a little brown sugar (or dash of cocoa?) to see what difference it makes. Will definitely keep using it.

After browning ground beef for taco night I realized I didn't have any taco seasoning.  I mixed this up quick (left out the red pepper flakes due to personal taste and added a little corn starch for thickening.  I will never go back to the store bought packets.  Tasted great, no "unknown" ingredients.

This was very flavorful!  I have to be careful with pepper for my family, so I decreased both the red and black by 2/3.  There was still plenty of pepper flavor.  I might try decreasing the salt a bit next time too - it was a bit salty for me.  I will definitely be making this in a large quantity to keep on hand.  No gluten and no corn and lots of taco flavor = yum, yum, yum!!!

I used fresh crushed garlic instead of onion and garlic powder and left out the crushed red pepper. So it was not hot and the kids enjoyed the chicken seasoned with this mix. Yammi!

I'll never buy packaged taco seasoning again! I doubled this for two pounds of lean ground meat and added a bit of moisture for it to simmer and flavor up. Delicious!

This recipe is great as posted however I used dried cilantro in place of the oregano and added cayenne pepper for extra heat.  I multiplied all the ingredients by 10 and will store in an air tight container for seasoning future dishes. This recipe can easily be adapted to personalize the flavor.

This is the best taco seasoning I've tried. I add 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and double the red pepper flakes for a spicier seasoning. Great recipe!

I tripled the recipe, with the exception 
of the sea salt. It was a hit with my family!
3 tablespoons per pound of meat...

I loved this recipe.  After coming from the grocery store, I realized that I didn't have the packaged stuff so I rushed to my computer to find a homemade taco seasoning mixture and this one came up.  As I looked at the ingredients, I realized that I had all of the ingredients, so I thought.  I substituted cayenne pepper for the pepper flakes since my daughter doesn't like food that is too spicy.  Also, I didn't have any chili powder so mixed all of the dry spices in a bowl before adding them to my chopped chicken and once I added the mixture to the partially cooked chicken, I poured some refrigerated Chili Sauce directly on the meat in the skillet and let it simmer in with the rest of the spices.  It was delicious!   No more packages for this momma on taco night!

I've never tried making my own, but forgot to buy one of those packets. I got lucky, though, and happened to have all the ingredients. This was really delicious. I used Kosher salt, since that's what I have, and left out the pepper flakes, because I don't like the spice. But I'll never buy those packets again.

The ingredients list gave me a starting point but I changed at least half of the amounts, so I can't rate it 5 stars. Here's what I did:

(For about 4 lbs of beef)
2 tbs cumin
2 tbs chili powder
1 tbs onion powder
1 tbs garlic powder
1 tbs Himalayan pink salt (saltier than table salt I think)
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp paprika

Very delicious. Saving this recipe.

It was simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. It came out great. I added some hot sauce for a little bit of that tomatoey zing I like, but other than that, it was perfect. I'll never buy taco seasoning again! Thank you!

So easy! I made this in 5 min with all ingredients I had on hand in my pantry. I keep it in a little jar ready to go for when I make tacos or fiesta chicken salad. This is so much better than store bought mix and without any weird ingredients.

Unexpectedly delicious!  I was concerned at first - I kept tasting the meat and thinking it didn't pack enough of a punch (I used the entire seasoning mix on about 1 1/3 lbs of ground beef).  I dumped in more garlic powder, then onion powder, a bit more salt... and just crossed my fingers.  But once it was in the taco shell with the toppings, it was a surprisingly subtle yet full flavor.  I'm used to the louder mixes from the store, but this recipe makes for a MUCH better taco!  Easy to tweak to your liking, as well.

This was great !!! Way better than I anticipated and my guys loved it. I made a double batch and I'm glad I did. It is soooooo much better than "store-bought" seasoning. Thanks so much. I did NOT edit the recipe at all, just happened to have all of the ingredients in the cupboards.

easy and tastey! I actually didn't have cumin, but I added cornstarch as suggested by another reviewer and I didn't have beef bouillon cubes so I added chicken granules. Chicken flavor seems to enhance many cooking recipes, so it can't hurt! Instead of pepper, I added Tony Chachere's spicy seasoning, which covered the pepper flakes and cayenne.

Tried it tonight. Didn't have paprika on hand (wish i did) so excluded that one. Overall it was good. But if I make it again, I would definitely cut back the salt. Way way too salty.

We make tacos a lot in the family so I make this seasoning in a big batch so we always have some on hand! It’s delicious in both ground meat tacos and chicken tacos! The only substitution I make is that I add 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper, instead of red pepper flakes because I never have red pepper flakes around.

I love this recipe! I'll never buy packets of taco seasoning again! If you don't like spicy, I recommend cutting the red pepper flake a bit.

I make this all the time.  I love it.  I don't use the kits anymore.   I add cayenne or chipotle seasoning only because I like things hot.

awesome....gluten free taco seasoning.....unlike lawrys seasoning packet.  
 You have to LOVE taco seasoning with no msg  

These are ingredients we all have handy and none of the scary stuff we can't pronounce that old El Paso seems to think we like.

I now have the freedom to add more or less salt whenever I feel like it.....and I can adjust the heat depending on who is home for dinner.

Extremely tasty.  I make a big batch and keep it in the cupboard.  My picky eater husband loves it too!  It's great to know what is in the seasoning as opposed to buying it in a packet.

Outstanding. I followed Gregsgirl63's suggestions to add 1/2T of flour to the spices and then use 3T of the seasoning concoction per pound of meat; and FoodSlave's suggestions to add 1/2C water and 1t beef bouillon, cut the salt a little, and simmer the whole mix until the meat absorbed the spices and bouillon flavor. Katie bar the door ...

I love using this combinations of spices for taco meat! I keep it stored and ready for use. I refuse to buy seasonings that are full of salt and preservatives so this is a great alternative.

Followed exactly except regular salt. I usually buy McCormick spicy taco seasoning packet. I think this is a good alternative if your out or trying to save money. However I didn't think it tasted better. Almost as good. Spice level was perfect for me

Doubled the garlic powder by accident but loved it like that.  9 year old said tasted like taco meat from a taco stand.  I got 2 thumbs up!  I used it on both shredded chicken and in the Mango Tofu Tacos recipes on this site.

This is an excellent recipe! I left out the red pepper flakes because I don't like things spicy. I used almost 4 teaspoons plus a seasoning packet for 2lbs of meat. I used 3/4 a cup of water as well. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Sorry didn't take a pic, but I tried it added a little extra red pepper flakes because my family likes it hot. I will never buy a packet again. And it sooo much better than buying a bottle of the seasoning as well its not bland. I will recommend to everyone I know.

I don't use the packets since I found out that if "spices" are listed most likely this will include MSG which I do not use in my cooking.  I was hard pressed to find a good alternate until tonight. I did increase the garlic and onion powders to 1/2t (do not confuse with garlic and onion salt as they are 2 different things.  Everyone enjoyed the flavors and the amount of heat. This is a sure winner in my recipe box.  I immediately made a 4X recipe and put it in a shaker box and will use it again and again.

I keep this in a mason jar in my spice cabinet - it's a regular go-to for many favorite recipes.  I use 3 TBS per pound of meat and 2/3 cup of water per pound of meat.  When making tacos I also usually add half a can of tomato paste.

I hate that I don't know what half the ingredients are on a packet of taco seasoning, plus the amount of sodium in them is outrageous. This recipe is great, tastes the same. I think I double the garlic... I usually do a double batch to keep some in a container to add things to...

Absolutely the BEST taco seasoning we've ever had!  No changes needed.  I have six kids and even the pickiest of them wants seconds and thirds!  I recommend making extra so it'll be ready for your next taco night.

This seasoning is authentic! I added more salt and some Tony catchers and lawrys and garlic powder, oinion powder and flakes. It really is good.

Great flavor! Like others, we ran out of packaged taco seasoning so tried this. My 13 year old says it's better than Taco Bell. We loved it and will use it for tacos from now on.

Perfect amount for most recipes and I like that now I can customize my taco fillings a little more. I'm not a big fan of a strong cumin taste for example. I'm interested in trying out the seasoning without the garlic and onion powder and dried pepper flakes and using the fresh versions in the dish. This could be big :)

I am also in the same boat as JCWGRIL where I'm looking to find ways to adopt more "freshness" into my diet so to speak. Excellent mix of spices. I too, will never purchase taco seasoning packets again. I am not sure what took me so long to discover this recipe but then again buying salty seasoning packets and cutting corners use to be the name of the game for me!

Excellent staple! I keep the list of ingredients taped inside my spice cupboard, so easy! Also nice to not have one more chemical in our diet by omitting the packages of premixed seasoning. I did reduce the cumin, but each ingredient can be adjusted to your taste.

Delicious!!! Gives your tacos a little bit of a kick, but 100 times better than store bought taco seasoning. I use it on ground turkey for a healthier taco meat and it was just as amazing. LOVE IT!!!!!

Excellent! Used it for shredded chicken tacos. Cooked the chicken breast in water with salt. Shredded the chicken, then browned the chicken in a pan with olive oil, added the seasoning and water with a bit of maizena.

I just made this and will never buy packets with all of their preservatives, dyes etc again! It is a great base recipe and can be tweaked from there. My daughter loves cumin so we added more and more chili and cayenne.

I use this recipe as a base for my tacos seasoning. I use fresh garlic and onions when cooking (instead of powder) and I add a tbsp of flour and a little water when cooking as well.

This was good but it still feels like something is missing! I don't know if my taste buds are so trained to the fake, processed stuff in the packages but I just felt this was lacking. What was there is definitely tasty but missing that signature "taco" seasoning flavor.

This has been my go to seasoning since I discovered it 3 yrs ago in allrecipes magazine. I actually multiply the recipe by 8! I use it on chicken and in other recipes too. I tweak the amounts gently according to our tastes. We love cumin and smoked paprika. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this in a pinch after discovering I didn't have any packets as I was cooking dinner. Followed the directions exactly and it was very tasty, but a little too salty in my opinion. I was glad I only made a little, I do plan on mixing a big batch up and keeping it on hand for whenever, but when I do I'll be cutting back on the salt.
Update, made a quadruple batch tonight, but with only the 1 teaspoon of salt. Added a generous tablespoon of the mixture to about a pound of ground pork with a packet of sazón, perfect this time. .

Absolutely love this recipe and it is gluten free! All the taco season packets in the stores have wheat in it so for a thickener I just add 1 teaspoon of Pamela's Artisan flour.

This is so much better than the packet.  I make BIG batches because I have lots of mouths to feed, and I am always shocked by how fast we go through it.  I cook chicken or left over pork roast simmering in a pot with water and a generous amount of this seasoning.  I also add it to refried beans when making 7-layer chip dip.

So much less expensive than buying it already made up in a jar or envelope.  Had all the ingredients in the cupboard already.  Tasted the same as what you would buy.

Very good, and very spicy! Spicy is good with me and most family members, but my husband isn't a spice person, although he thought the flavor was good, just a little too hot. Next time I'll probably pretty much leave as is for the rest of the family, and put a little aside for my husband with less black pepper and cayenne. All in all, very good! Oh..and I used regular salt instead of sea salt, just added less, I believe (rating late).

Excellent taco seasoning mix- I omit the salt altogether.  There's enough coming from other sources that I don't need to add extra.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was very good and not "chemical" tasting as some of the packets are. The only thing I would do next time is halve the salt. It was a bit salty for my taste (and I like salt)! I recipe made just over 2 TBS which is equivalent to one packet of taco seasoning mix. I used it in a pot of taco soup and it was very good. As some others said, there is a kick to it, but I liked that. I think the kick will mellow a bit if you halve the salt, though.

I skip the onion powder and garlic powder (just because I never have these on hand) and add 1 or 2 large cloves of fresh garlic .  I'm always happy with the results!

Really good base. A little hot and salty for me, but I just add a little less. I also add a little corn starch to make the liquid a bit less runny. Stays in the taco better and doesn't run down your arm when you eat them. Much better than prepared envelopes!

Better than seasoning packets.  Slightly spicier. Use 1 tbsp. per 1 lb of meat.  I stumbled upon this after the meat was browned and I realized that I didn't have a taco seasoning packet.  My 3 picky kids liked it too.

My husband and I liked this so much that we made a vegetarian version with black beans on one night and a ground beef batch the next night! I skipped adding the salt with the spices, and I salted to taste at the end. I added a heaping teaspoon of flour and 1/4 cup of water with the spices to make a sauce. I also dropped the onion powder and sauteed half an onion at the beginning.

I made a double batch of this and used a little less than two tablespoons to a pound and a half of ground beef.  I thought it was too salty and too spicy.  I am glad I didn't make too much of it.  I think I will try making more to add to the leftover mixture but omit the salt and red pepper flakes.

Great recipe and so easy.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of coriander.  I omitted the pepper and used dried onion flakes instead of powder.  I used the seasoning with the Salsa Chicken recipe from this site.  Came out fantastic.  Thanks!

love the taste.  2 heaping tablespoons is too much for a pound of ground beef.  try only 1 heaping tablespoon.  use a little water to join the two.  you may need to thin it down with a small can of tomato sauce and re-thicken.  gathering the ingredients took me about half an hour searching the cupboards for this and that (i KNOW i had cumin, where was it).

if everything was ready, 1 minute. if you have to look for it as everybody would have to, a log longer.

Excellent for those of us on a reduced sodium diet. I have been making this seasoning for over a year and love it. Now that I am on a reduced sodium diet, I make it without salt and it still tastes great. No one misses it.

I was happy to find this. I have a black pepper allergy and my husband is on a reduced salt diet so it is great to be able to make this omitting the pepper and using lite salt. We love cumin and was happy to see it included. Years ago I would add more to the packets. I made it with New Mexico red chili powder. The tacos were delicious!

This is really great!  No contest so much better than packaged mix. I used fine sea salt and next time will cut the salt as one reviewer noted sea salt is not an even swap. Also used less chili powder, added small amount chicken bullion paste w a little water and subbed 1/8 tsp of cayenne for red pepper flakes (not sure my kid could handle the flakes) per other reviewers suggestions.

This is a very good taco season mix. I will not buy it prepackaged again.  If you don't like it a little spicy you should cut back on red pepper flakes just a little.  We liked it just as written. Thanks for the recipe.

Great seasoning recipe. The family and I all enjoyed it. I will cut down on the salt a little next time.   I also subbed ground cayenne pepper for the crushed red pepper like another reviewer.

This is my favorite taco seasoning - better than the packaged stuff.   I ran out of onion powder one day - put fresh chopped onion in your meat while cooking to substitute.  Works with fresh garlic as well if no garlic powder.

After making tacos with this seasoning my husband told me I wasn't allowed to use the store bought stuff anymore,  lol.  We do ours with double the red pepper flakes & it's perfect for our tastes.

I loved this recipe. We forgot to buy a taco packet and so I found this and I will never go back. It was spicy but my young kids even loved it! I added table salt instead of sea salt only because that is what I had on hand.

This was perfect for our family and friends, because it's adjustable for our varied group. Some like it hot, and some can't have spicy food, and it has just the right base taste to add a pinch more heat to a dish after, and omit a little heat for the softies. of the two times I've made it, one was for a taco dip, and I was asked for the recipe three times!

I thought it was too salty, and after a few times making it, I decided to leave out the red pepper flakes all together and add more black pepper instead. We love cumin, so I add more of that in. I make a big bunch of it at once to keep on hand. For a quick New Year's snack, I mixed some with cream cheese to use as a base in tortilla wraps (pinwheels), then added sliced turkey, lettuce and red peppers. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed a combination of a couple of other suggestions - used 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne pepper and 2 tsp of corn starch and 2/3 cup water. Wonderful!! My family loves spicy food and it was definitely spicy enough. We all liked this much better than the usual packet or container of seasoning I buy. I definitely plan on making this in a larger batch to keep on hand.

Wanted to make tacos - but no package, so I followed this recipe. Wow! Fantastic. I didn't have sea salt so I substituted regular salt. Then I saw the other review that said to not do that and I was a bit worried it would be too salty. To my relief, it was not. It was fairly spicy (too much so for some family members) but the rest loved it. Would definitely do this again. I did 3 tbsp per lb of gr. hamburger.

perfect taco seasoning without all the sodium/MSG that you find in the pre-packaged seasonings.  So delicious!

My family and I tried this recipes this weekend, on  a cold winter day. I followed the recipe  as directed with one substitution. MY wife is not found of black beans, so I put in pinto beans.  
     I gave this recipe a four star because I felt there was something missing.  We all put in our own ingredients and it help with the flavor. For me I added hot sauce and parmesan cheese.  It gave it a kick for me. I would like to thank the original chief for this recipe.

Very good. I made 1.5 times the recipe for 1.25 lbs of venison burger. Cut back on the chili powder and cumin. Used Cayenne instead of the red pepper. Slightly spicy when using the equivalent, might cut back slightly. Added 1 tbsp. of cornstarch

I have made this recipe twice, and although it is perfect as-is, a pinch of white sugar and using 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt instead of the garlic powder and sea salt, is a great tweak also!!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I used the whole recipe, instead of red pepper flakes I used the same amount of cayenne (we like it hot) all else was left as written.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.Thank you Bill!

I loved this - mainly because I love the idea of this. I'd been buying packaged taco seasoning for many years, but now that I've actually been cooking for a while, I love the idea of cheaper home-made equivalents to packaged food products. I looked up the directions on McCormick's own website, and basically used the whole batch (I made it exactly as written) for one pound of ground beef. (I actually made burritos with this instead of tacos.)  My palate's not too sensitive, but this tasted just like the real thing to me. I always have these spices on hand, so I'll never go back!

I make this in bulk for myself and my room mates - everyone loves it! I use it to season grilled veggies, lentils, and home made salsa. I prefer to eliminate the salt and also add a dash of chipotle chili powder - though I tend to add some salt when I put it in my salsa!

A great recipe! I agree with a reviewer who suggested doubling the garlic and onion and adding corn starch to help it mix better with the ground beef.

This was really good but too salty & a little too spicy for my small kids. I will probably use this again because it had really good flavor overall, but cut down on the salt & red pepper flakes. I used sea salt.

Nice flavor. I did change the pepper flake with half the amount cayenne pepper and I used table salt instead of sea salt. Used 2Tbls per 1lb of meat.

My husband has been put on a VERY low salt diet.  If you've ever looked at the packets of taco seasoning, the sodium is huge so I tried this - without the salt.

It was great!   

I added cayenne pepper and habanero powder to give it some kick and a little spice.
To the people who said it was too spicy and too much pepper (?), all I can say is that you must think milk is spicy.

This was just amazing! The flavor it produces is deep and rich. I substitute the Cumin for Red Curry Powder and it adds a unique flavor to the meat that has my family coming back for more. Thanks!

I've been making my own taco seasoning for a while. Apparently, I've been making it wrong. This recipe is perfect. I won't be looking back! Thx Bill

Put 1/2 small chopped onion & 2 cloves minced garlic; omitted salt; used all spices. Added tomato puree to desired thickness. A low salt alternative that ist very tasty & just what I was looking for!

Really good!  I added two tablespoons of chopped dried onions and kept everything else the same.  One recipe was perfect for 1-1/4 lb of hamburger.

Made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it did have a touch of a bite to it so if you have one of those really picky kids that doesn't like any hint of spice, not for them, but it was great.  
Next time though I may add some more spicy flavors since I like the hotter the better, but definitely good and less grainy than the packaged stuff.   
It leaves room for adjustments based on taste buds too which is great.

This seasoning mix is fabulous!!  I have always used prepackaged mixes, but since going gluten free that is no longer an option.  This recipe was so much better than any prepackaged mix I have ever used!  I did omit the onion powder and garlic powder in favor of using fresh.  I sauteed my onion and garlic in a little olive oil then put in 1 lb of ground grass fed beef and just added the seasoning directly to the meat.  Putting it in before the meat was browned allowed for the seasoning to really flavor the meat.  I didn't need to add any kind of thickener or water using this method.

We ran out of the store bought taco mix just before making dinner so I went to allrecipes.com and found this! I had all the spices so no reason to get the store bought stuff anymore. I used a little less salt than this recipe called for

Forgot to add this to my recipe box and had to search for it. Glad I found it again because I refuse to buy the overly salted packaged stuff anymore.  This works perfectly and couldn't be any easier to make.

We were in such a funk from a seasoning standpoint because I have a big tub of McCormick seasoning from Costco and it was all we used. My husband asked me to please do something else with our tacos this evening, so I gave this a whirl.  I didn't measure, just eyeballed, and he said it was great!  I had almost everything on hand (omitted the onion powder because I was out) and it was so easy.

Since trying this recipe, I never use store taco seasoning. I generally make 4 times the recipe to have it handy when I need it. I follow the recipe exactly, and it's perfect. It's a bit stronger than the packaged stuff. So you have to add and taste so you don't add too much.

Like many others before have said, I will never buy packaged taco seasoning again.  Who knows what chemicals, preservatives, and other nasty cancer-causing ingredients are in those packages!  Now I have a recipe that I can make in bulk to always have some seasoning on hand. Love it!!

This is great! I didn't have paprika but I did give it a 1/4 tsp of white pepper and 1/4 tsp of Habanero Chile powder and it was amazing!

It's really not that spicy but my dad had a little bit of the hamburger I used with it and he ran to the sink as if he'd bitten into an atomic bomb. So I guess if you can't handle anything spicier than apple sauce this isn't for you.

This is fantastic. I can't have MSG so I make all my sauce mixes from scratch. I use smoked paprika instead of regular paprika for a smokey flavor. Three Tblsp. Taco seasoning to 1lb hamburger, one onion chopped, 1 Tblsp flour and 3/4 c. Water. Making it in bulk and sending it to a friend living in Thailand who can't find Mexican food anywhere. :-)

I don't use red pepper flakes as this is a mild house but perfect blend otherwise. I also use a little flour and water and simmer as others have suggested. Ill never buy the pre-packaged again!

Yummy! Tastes just like store bought! I did add one cube/packet of beef bouillon though to give it a little more meaty flavor. Turned out great! Husband and 2 yr old love it!

Perfetto.  I love having this stuff prepared in large batches to keep in the cabinet.  A great balance with lots of heat.  Not a single bad thing to say about it.

I made this without the red pepper flakes because kids were going to be eating this and, while I like spice, I don't prefer hot.  Everyone loved it, adults and kids alike.  I used three tablespoons in a pan of chopped chicken thighs (5-6).  Two tablespoons was too bland.  Will definitely use again and again.

This is a very nice blend! I had all of the ingredients and I measured it exactly as written. I will cut down on the salt next time because it was a bit too salty for my palate. Otherwise, the flavour was great!

We have an organic garden loaded with green peppers. This is the fourth recipe that I have tried and is definately the best & easiest to make! I lined all the stuffed peppers in a Lodge cast iron dutch oven and cooked on our gas grill for 45 minutes. It was perfect & peppers were cooked just right.  I added some salt & peppr.  Other than that, I made just as directed.

EXCELLENT! Got home from work, ready to make Taco's for dinner ... NO seasoning in the kit I bought (only the shells)! Came upon this recipe and had all the ingredients except onion powder (BUT I did have an Onion!). Tasted perfect. I did use a little more chili powder & a little more garlic powder & cumin...but regardless, this is a keeper! THANKS!

It's a nice flavor without all the added msg and sodium of the packaged stuff. I followed the recipe exact. I've used this a few time in non-taco dishes that called for taco season so I'm not sure how it will hold up on it's own but i'm sure it will do just fine.

Just made this; added more cumin and chili powder in the pan as well as more table salt as the sea salt wasn't enough; it was too bland for me per the exact recipe above. I sprinkled it in from a bowl, didn't measure, but used about half of the mixture for 1 lb of ground turkey; including some minced onion. Once I got everything on my taco, I thought it was a good. I'll use it again, possibly adding even more cumin.

This seasoning mix is delicious and I love being able to control the sodium content. Plan to make it in a larger quantity to have it ready-to-use.

Will be making this in bulk for future use. Didn't have paprika but it still tasted restaurant quality. I can imagine varying the quantities regularly to change the flavor.

A wonderful taco seasoning recipe. A little too spicy for my eight year old daughter, but great for the rest of us. My husband hates the flavor of packaged seasoning, therefore, we don't have tacos very often. However, this time he loved, loved, loved them. Thank you so much for this easy and delicious recipe.

Much better than the brand I've used for years. Excellent spice and no "fillers." We will be using this recipe for years to come. I make a large batch and store it for ease of use.

I really quite like this recipe. I used 1/4 tsp of regular, as I didn't have ground sea salt ready.  The only change I'll make next time is to decrease the black pepper to 1/4-1/2 tsp.

I use this as is, to make a dip with sour cream and cream cheese. Gives it a nice yummy taste. You can add as much or as little as you like of the taco seasoning mix.

Delicious and much more "taco"esque than I thought it would be.  My son who is obsessed with tacos ate five.  I have now made more and saved it on my favourite-spice shelf.

Great flavor... love the tip others provided to include 2 tsps. of cornstarch. I halved the salt and may cut back a little more as I didn't miss it.

Great! I don't normally review. If you wish to cut the heat, you can substitute 1/8 tsp ground red pepper to original recipe, for a party, etc. Otherwise, it's really good!

Excellent recipe as is.  Sure beats the heck out of store-bought packets and healthier too!  I make 300 servings and put it in a large container and it lasts a long time- we eat a lot of Mexican food.  Of course, one could alter it as needed to make it spicier if one wanted to.  I use about 3 tbsp/lb. of ground beef.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great taco seasoning!!  Not too much heat and nice array of flavoring.  Will definitely use this instead of purchasing it!  We liked it a lot better.

This is a great recipe for taco seasoning.  Make it in a big batch so you'll always have some on hand! Much better than the store bought, pre-packaged brands - no artificial ingredients in this one! Be sure to store air-tight since the flavors smell so strong!

This is a great place to start if you want to start making your own taco seasoning. I have always bought the packets, but I would like to cut out processed foods like that.
I added in more onion powder and garlic powder. Also added a little smoked paprika in addition to the regular paprika.
You need something to help the seasoning coat the meat. I used cornstarch when I mixed the seasoning with the meat (not pre-mixed in) but flour would also do the trick.

I made this last night for my 14 YO and his friends, using (frozen) ground turkey, adding 2/3 cup of water per pound of meat. Delicious! As others have said, no need to buy seasoning any more. As it turns out, I like the flavor of this seasoning combination better than the store's. Thank you for sharing!

I substituted crushed chipotles for the red pepper flakes and cut the salt and pepper in half. Perfect combination of seasoning my way and as posted. Stop buying those tasteless and overpriced pouches.

Oh, this was perfect! The only thing I changed was omitting the pepper. (first chili powder - very spicy - then red pepper flakes - VERY SPICY - and then pepper on top of all that?! Nuh-Uh!!) Anyway, this was full of flavor! :)

I am so very thankful for coming across this recipe. I was getting ready to make taco salad and realized that the taco seasoning I had the ingredients consisted of yeast which I could not have. This recipe is fantastic!  The taste was incredible and for some strange reason my meat was not full of grease as it normally is when using store bought taco seasoning. No more store bought taco seasoning for me.

I liked this recipie.  I have tried quite a few taco seasonings and they never came out nearly as good as this.  This did come out a little too hot, but I think that was because there are huge differences in how and where you get chili powder. I was using pure Indian chili powder where most chili powder in American stores are much older and weaker and a mix of different types of chilis.  I should have known to cut it down I would never even consider using this much even in super hot curry.  I guess you could just use less mix but then you will have to give up the other flavors and like someone else said I am a garlic/onion lover and I would not want to give up that flavor.  Better to adjust the powder than cut down flavor.
  But since my family likes HOT food, they just added a little extra sour cream to reduce the heat.  Next time I will stick to 1/2 a tbsp.  I made a batch to keep on hand and i also skipped the red chili flakes.  Never like them and they are redundant considering you already have chili powder. If you have kids who like the toco bell type you can consider adding 1/4 tsp of corn starch it will give it the texture they are used to.  My kids love it that way, but not me.

I just tried this recipe to make my tacos. It was delicious!!  I used half the crushed pepper that was called for since I'm a wimp. It had just the right amount of kick without being too overpowering. The hubby agreed that this will be our new favorite.

I've got to throw in with the lovers!  I made the full recipe and added 2 t cornstarch to more equal the packet that I USED to use.  Then I divided the mixture in half, and added it to 1/2 lb cooked ground beef (I was making a small batch of tacos for lunch) along with 1/3 C water (2/3 C for the whole batch as per other suggestions).  It cooked up "saucy" as I'm used to, and I thought it had a nice kick -- not too spicy, tho we eat spicy in this household. And I, too, am never going back to packets!  Thanks for this!

Absolutely delicious!  I was making a bigger batch of it (no more store bought with added sugar, additive & preservatives)and ran out of cumin.  So basically I only had about 25% of what recipe called for.  I then added a little cayenne pepper.  It turned out perfect for me...Some bite for sure, but not super hot.  Just how i like it.

I don't know why I've not rated this yet because I ave used this recipe for several years now. It is the best. The only thing I do different is I use about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. I never buy taco seasoning anymore.

TIP: add 3 tablespoons of tomato paste to 1 lb ground beef and 2-3 tablespoons of this taco seasoning, and a splash of water til you get the right consistency.  The tomato paste makes a huge difference.

We were preparing a Mexican themed rehearsal dinner for our son and needed to make lots of chicken and beef taco meat.  Found this recipe for taco seasoning and was very pleased with the flavor it gave the meats.  It was better then my previous recipe for tacos! EDIT:  Also added this seasoning to a Black Bean Salsa Soup I made today  and it  added a great flavor to that as well!

I'm disappointed in this one. A general suggestion of how much to use per pound would be nice, instead of "use as little or as much as you want." I used the whole batch, 1 ounce, in 3 pounds of beef for a big Mexican themed Christmas dinner. Considering a store bought pkg. is 1 ounce per 1 pound beef, I was actually worried it would turn out too mild, but I figured it was a safe bet for the kids. Wrong. The adults enjoyed it, although a few of us thought it was too salty and had an after kick. Unfortunately, the kick was way too hot for the kids, and my kid safe dish suddenly was being picked at and they were guzzling juice and complaining...the opposite of what I wanted. The proportions are off somewhere on this, and I'm not going to bother trying to experiment with it. Bottom line: If you try this, don't assume an ounce of this is equal to an ounce of a seasoning packet.

We really like this recipe, we have not bought taco seasoning for about a year now. I have used it on beaf, pork, shrimp, and fish. I quadrupled the recipe and added 1 tablespoon of corn starch and keep it with the rest of the spices.

Added more garlic to our liking and around tablespoon of corn startch to thicken it up... excellent, so much better then store bought.  Most probably do not know that they already have the ingredients in their cabinet.

After searching for a few minutes I found that the main ingredient CHILI POWDER is a mixture of the same other ingredients listed in this recipe.  Save yourself the extra hastle and see the Taco Seasoning (without chili powder) recipe.  I will admit that this recipe is good.

Very good!  Has a bit of a kick (I don't like much heat) so may reduce the crushed red pepper slightly next time for me and the kids.

Yum! So much tastier than packaged variety. For "medium" taco seasoning, I made the following adjustments: 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes and  1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Also, I added 2 teaspoons corn starch to mix and 2/3 cup water to cooked ground beef to create the correct consistency.

Simply delicious as is! I did add 2 tsp of flour to help the mix cling to meat but it is not necessary. After draining the grease, I add 3 tbsp of the seasoning and 1/3 cup of water to 1lb of browned ground beef. it was not too salty or too spicy as some reviews mention...this maybe because i added the flour to my mix. Thanks for this recipe!

It tastes amazing but the prep time is longer then a minute.  It takes me about 10 minutes or maybe more trying to make sure I have all measurements correct.  Usually the measurements for this can be for two different times making it with one pd of meat each time.  2 Tbsp per pound of meat is how we like it anymore would ruin it I think, overkill.

Perfect. I use this with 93/7 ground turkey and it turns out great.  I tweak it every once in a while, with a little more of this or that, but it's a solid seasoning mix.

This is easy and tasty. No more packaged taco seasoning for us. This is a much healthier option. Note: If you do not like spice (we do) limit the red pepper and cumin.

This is excellent. Easily tweaked to suit your own tastes, but is very good as is.  I added 1 t. cornstarch and beef base to 1 1/3# of ground turkey with 1c. of water and it was a perfect blend and consistency.

I loved the flavor and heat, but added a little brown sugar and water to ease up the spiciness for my kids.  Really great recipe!  My family and friends went back for seconds.

No more packets of taco seasoning for me, this recipe was delicious and natural. I only put in half the amount of salt required, and I used it with Boca crumbles since I am vegetarian along with gregsgirl's suggestion of adding 1/2 tbsp flour and about 1/2 cup of water to the "meat" with the seasoning. It came out wonderful :) My meat-eating boyfriend loved the finished tacos too.

Excellent! I like the bite that the red pepper gives the seasoning and I like that it doesn't have the saltiness of store bought seasoning packets.

Great! It was a little spicy for my family, but I loved that I could make one of our favorites a bit healthier.  Less sodium and preservatives. And I added 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch to thicken. I will be making this again, just with less crushed red pepper.

Delicious!  And for pennies on the dollar, I will never purchase a packet of taco seasoning again!  One reviewer commented that the mix is very spicy as is, and he/she is correct.  I think next time I would reduce the red pepper flakes.  I think next time I am going to try making two pounds of taco meat, using 6 tablespoons of taco seasoning (reduce the red pepper flakes), and throw in a can of Ro-Tel with green chiles, blended, in place of some of the water.  I don't mind the chunks of tomatoes, but the DH probably would.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Excellent, I have served this to hundreds of people at events with rave reviews.  Great on chicken & beef.  Did a taco with shredded chicken with a ranch mix packet and 1TBS of this seasoning topped with a pico avocado mango salsa.  Again excellent taco mix as I had been searching for the taco mix and this is it.

I just made this taco seasoning.  This is a forgiving recipe. I added more cumin, papraika and a dash here and there, it taste amazing. I also added a bit of my own touch, tablespoon of tomato paste, tablespoon of wheat flour and a teaspoon of sugar. This is a really gooooooood taco seasoning.

The only tweaks I made to the recipe was that I substituted cayenne pepper for the paprika, since I didn't have any paprika on hand and I also used regular table salt.  I added the whole thing to about a pound of browned and drained lean ground beef with about a half cup of water, brought to a boil and then let simmer for five minutes.  

Very tasty.  Spicy, but not super spicy.  Probably a touch hotter than the "hot" seasoning mixes I've tried from the store.  I've made recipes that utilize beef broth, stock, etc and they are tasty, but I wouldn't say better,just different.  I like a drier taco, the beef stock recipes generally make a juicer sort of meat.

This worked perfectly for me. I wanted to make tacos and had all of the ingredients except a taco seasoning packet. Having tried this, I don't think I'll be going back to a store-bought mix anytime soon.

Excellent recipe. I found I was out of taco seasoning after I browned the meat.  With a snow storm raging outside, I wasn't driving to town.  I'm glad I found this recipe. I used 1/8 tsp ground cayenne and a tsp of corn starch to thicken.  It's on the hot side that way, if you like spicy.

I made taco's tonight but my packaged seasoning has traces of wheat. I have celiac so couldn't have it. You can't have taco's without taco seasoning so I came here, found this recipe and tried it. I did what the first review said to and that was to add the 3tbps (which was exactly what it made) to the hamburger with 2/3 c of water. I omitted the flour. Very good! I wont ever go back to packaged.

I brown 3/4 to 1 lb. of grassfed beef and put the whole recipe of this on top after I've gotten a decent crust on the meat. AMAZING. Best taco seasoning I've ever had! :) Thank you so much for sharing this. I do up the chili powder, use granulated garlic (and more of it), as well as more onion powder. BUT, I've made it as stated above...and it was SOOOOooooooo good.

I make this in 5 to 10 times the quantity and save it in air tight containers. We love it for tacos, meat loaf and dry rub. I leave out the salt and it is still great.

Awesome!  Left out the onion powder because my stomach doesn't like it but it's good anyway.  My kids said "these tacos are better than usual" the first time I made it.  They liked it much better than the packaged seasoning mix.

This is my go to for tacos now. Much more flavor than the premade seasoning pack. It's about medium spicy.

11/14/2012 Great recipe, it was a little heavy on salt - will reduce salt in next batch. I used this in ground beef for Mexican Lasagna. Much better than store bought taco seasoning. The recipe for Seven Layer Taco Dip in the bean layer. I'll make a LOT more of this and package some as gifts. 11/22/2016 - I made a LOT the second time - and lowered the salt, which took away intensity. This time when making a LOT (175 servings) For this size - the salt is 1/3 cup + teaspoon. I used True Lime & True Lemon powder for 1/3 Cup then used salt for the teaspoon. REALLY good - and lowered the salt (husband's doc told him to lower salt intake - he is not too willing to lower salt - lime and lemon powders are my easiest solution.) 2-26-2018 - this recipe NOW I also make as a gift to friends who LOVE it! I have used simple zip lock plastic bags - to using modest size canning jars - makes a great gift for Tex-Mex enthusiasts!

This recipe saved me a trip to the store.  Won't use packaged mix every again.  Adding cornstarch or flour to the mix and water when cooking are good tips.  Going to add a bit of beef powder next time and give that tip a try.

Added these spices exactly as stated except for the red pepper flakes to ground beef, chopped gr pepper, celery and cooked rice.  Rolled it up in a wrap with salsa and sourcream.  Delicious.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

I added this seasoning to a bean dip I was making and it made the dip so much more flavorful! I've made this seasoning again since then and will continue to use it. It's great, thank you!

Left out the pepper and red pepper flakes. Added an 1/8 of cayenne pepper. Used all 3 tablespoons of seasoning for 1.5 pounds of chicken. Browned and seasoned the meat. Added 1 cup of water and simmered. Just a tiny bit spicy with tons of flavor!

This was so easy and the end result is so much tastier than a packet!
The only change was I did not use the red pepper because of the kids and regular salt instead of sea salt. 
Once you try it you won't use packets anymore either!

I only use this taco seasoning recipe and haven't bought it from the grocery store in years.  I don't change the ingredients, but use ground turkey (three pounds 93% lean) and double the taco seasoning recipe.  That a good meat to seasoning ratio.  After I brown the turkey, I drain off the fat, add about one and a half cups of water, add the double taco seasoning, and about a tablespoon of Kitchen Bouquet.  Kitchen Bouquet doesn't add flavor, but does make the turkey meat browner in color, similar to browned ground beef.  I let the turkey simmer on low, uncovered, stirring every few minutes to make sure all of the turkey cooks in the water and spice.  I simmer until almost all of the water has evaporated.  Then it's ready for fantastic tacos - and the best part is that no one will know that it's not ground beef and it's healthier for you and your family.  Thanks Bill for the great recipe!

Fantastic recipe, but I changed a few things. I doubled the garlic and onion powder to 1/2 tsp each as before the chili powder overwhelmed the other ingredients. I added 1 tsp of corn starch to give the meat a bit of a saucy consistency that the packets normally give. Also, after reading a review by someone stating that they used bouillon cubes to flavor it more, I opted instead to give the meat a splash of soy sauce at the time I added in the spice mix and a bit of water. I didn't want to use something riddled with MSG (which is why I didn't buy the taco seasoning packets in the first place) and bouillon is full of it. I figured I could still get the savory taste from a dash of soy sauce and the meat tasted fantastic!

This whole recipe with the addition of the things I added above, made enough to spice 1 lb of meat. It was slightly more than 3 tbsp worth of spices but I don't mind the meat with a bit more flavor so it tasted great!

This had a great flavor but contained too much salt for the refried beans we added it to. I will adjust the amount accordingly next time depending on what recipe I use it in.

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  I didn't have any cumin so substituted 3/4 t of chili pepper- it was perfect.  I personally could have made it a bit spicier but my boyfriend thought it was perfect as is.  As many others said, I will NEVER buy store-bought again!

Made this for the first time today and accidentally quadrupled the recipe once I got to the teaspoon measurements (don't ask) so I upped everything else to match and made taco meat with about a tbsp and 1/2 and there was nothing left! I did tweak it a bit and used a salt substitute but once the tortillas, cheese and everything else was combined I was blown away! I'll never buy a sodium packed packet again! Thanks for posting this!!

Excellent!  I will never buy the packets of seasoning again.  I used this is chicken enchiladas and the taste was way better then packet mix.  I used regular table salt and a hot chili powder and it was perfect.

I made this recipe because I needed a taco seasoning that was gluten-free. I omitted the red pepper flakes because I have young children. It was still plenty hot. I would likely cut down on the spices when I make it again, but that is just personal preference. I used regular salt and both my husband and I found it way too salty! I can't imagine how salty it would've tasted had I used sea salt. Anyway, I think next time I would cut the salt amount in half, but again, that's just our personal preference.

Worked out awesome. Good base recipe to adapt for what you like. Didn't have onion powder. Subbed garlic salt for the sea salt. Left out the red pepper flakes....they've been too hot for us in the past. Thanks!

Fantastic!

Added two pinches of superfine sugar (to bring out the robust flavors).  Substituted Smoked Paprika for regular (to give it more of a chipotle feel). 

Take some decent tortilla chips (Donkey Chips, Xochitl), and top them with shredded cheddar and monteray jack cheesees. Sprinkle this wonderful mixture on top and bake for a few min at 350.  Top with a little Cholula and you have a perfect plate of nachos for the 2am munchies!

I used this recipe x10 for 12# of hamburger meat.  It is very good, I won't go back to packaged either!  So easy to make.  My only complaint is that I should have listened to the other reviews as it is a little (not bad) spicy for the little kids.  So maybe cut back on the red pepper if you don't like it spicy.  But excellent taste for me:)

Just great! I have used this recipe a lot and have no idea why I haven't just made a huge jar of it to keep in the spice cabinet. I use taco seasoning a lot and this is much better than the stuff you get in the packets.

Made with chicken (minus the red pepper),  turned out great! Also, for some extra hidden vitamins, I pureed a zucchini and pepper and threw that into the chicken too. Added some nice texture to the dish!

This is the perfect replacement for package seasoning.  I love that I can control the salt and my family loved the flavor.  I mix into ground beef and use as a nacho topping.  Thanks for sharing.

Good stuff!  I had a spice bottle sized container of a commercial taco seasoning that was too spicy and too salty.  I didn't want to throw it out, so I was looking for something to cut it with.  I had all the ingredients already, so I made this recipe, minus the red pepper and salt.  I mixed two parts of this, plus one part of the storebought stuff and it was just right.

Like everyone else, I am so glad I found this recipe. I love that I can make this instead of using the taco seasoning packets. I didn't have sea salt, so I used a teaspoon of kosher salt. After tasting the tacos, I think I could have added more salt. That would be the ONLY change I'd make to this recipe!

I loved this recipe!!! I only changed up the onion and garlic powder by adding more.  Thank you for making our "family taco night" even better...

Fantastic! With a lot of topping on the meat it did seem it lacked salt. Maybe I didn't add enough seasoning. Tasting just the meat it was perfect.

I didn't have any of my store bought taco seasoning on hand so I search here and found this one.  It was excellent.  Only change I made was I used "lite" salt in place of sea salt, only because I didn't have any, and it worked very well.  This is a keeper!

This is a keeper! We will never go back to packaged seasoning again! I used half cayenne in place of the full amount of crushed red pepper simply because I didn't have any on hand. It came out fine, perhaps a little on the spicy side for those who don't like the heat. 3 TBS per lb of ground meat is good, as other reviewers have suggested. Thanks Bill, for sharing!

This was perfect! I was making chicken taco burgers and the recipe called for 1/2 packet of taco seasoning.  I hate having an open packet left over because I always forget it is there and it ends up spilling or going to waste.  So I made this instead and added the appropriate amount of the mix.  Homemade is so much better!  Great mix!

This tastes just like, if not a better than, packaged taco seasoning. Personally, it's so much easier to buy a packet of seasoning rather than measuring out 9 ingredients. I'd suggest that you should triple (or more) the recipe so that you have some already prepared for the next time you need it. I used it to make tacos: After browning the beef and draining it, I added this seasoning with a few tablespoons of water and let it simmer for 10 minutes.

Excellent alternative to the added preservatives and msg of pre-made taco seasonings. I tweaked to taste and tripled the recipe, but otherwise a good guidline for tasty taco seasoning. Next time, I will make a lot more and store it! Thanks for sharing!!!

I have used this seasoning so many times in different recipes and I can't believe that I did not rate it. I used this with the recipe Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup by RaisinKane aka Patti from this website. Excellent pair. Both recipes are keepers. Lots of flavor.

I didn't have oregano or onion powder but the seasoning was still delicious! I used cayenne pepper in place of chili powder and it turned out super spicy and super yummy.

Great basic recipe.  I can never resist tinkering, so I upped the garlic, chili and onion powder about a tsp each, and added about 1/2 tsp more cumin.  I also added a little beef bouillon base.  This helped to cut the chicken flavor since I was using frozen browned ground chicken.  I and added a little water and a little Bud Lite Lime (beer) to give it that 'saucy' texture.  My kids liked it (imagine that) My oldest commented that it was "really good, not just edible but really good" - pretty high praise in my house.  Served it with soft tortillas, fresh avocado, onion, toms, fresh corn off the cob, plus sour cream and cheese all rolled up - excellent dinner!

Tried this out a couple of months ago and it works equally great for tacos or as a rub for carnitas, etc.  I have a sensitivity to MSG which is an ingredient in virtually any prepared taco seasoning, so this is going to be a staple seasoning blend in our house.

This is the second time I made this seasoning. I use it in ground turkey to make taco meat and most people don't know it's not ground beef. This stuff is tasty.   I didn't have any onion powder so I browned the meat with a small minced onion instead and then added 3 tablespoons of seasoning, 2 tablespoons of ketchup and 1/2 cup of water and simmered it until 3/4 of the liquid was gone. Then I added c1/2 teaspoon corn starch to thicken the last of the liquid so it would coat the meat.  It's very good!

After finding this recipe for taco seasoning, I never use store-bought seasong anymore! It's the perfect blend of herbs & spices. When I am feeling a little more adventurous, I add a little extra of the red pepper flakes. Yum!

This is very good!  I didn't use onion powder (none on hand), and added a little flour for thickening purposes.  It really needs a thickening agent of some sort, so add a teaspoon or two flour (otherwise, you'll get watery tacos).  Will be making again and again!

We have chicken tacos almost every week and this is the spice mix we use.  Better and cheaper that the packets.  Just put in a bag with the chicken pieces for about 20 minutes and grill it up.  We will never use the packets again.

Really good. Use all the seasonings for app. 1lb of ground beef. I did only do a dash of red pepper flakes b/c my kids like things more mild.

Better (and healthier!) than the kind I buy at Whole Foods. I omitted the pepper and it was great! I also ground it up first in my magic bullet to bring out the flavors.

Easy, tasty and so glad to find it when I was out of my packets! Subbed 1/8 tsp. ground cayenne pepper for the flakes & used 1/2 tsp. kosher salt. I used a bit over half the original amount in a pound of ground beef mixed with black beans and added 1/2 cup of water with a tsp or so of flour mixed into it. Will make more next time!

No more Lawry's taco seasoning for me, which was the taco seasoning to go to.  But for the last year I have been using this seasoning blend and we love it.  I alternate at times on the red pepper flakes because it does have a bit of kick to it.   Definite keeper in my house!

Perfection!  This was undoubtedly the best taco seasoning we have ever used, and we will never go back to packaged!  I've made a huge container to keep in the cupboard so it's always at the ready.  I used my own homegrown, dried red pepper which gave it a lot of zip!  I cut the salt in half only because I am very sensitive to salt in my food.  Excellent combination of spices...I wouldn't even consider trying to improve on it =)

Good blend. Added beef bouillon as suggested and we'll be making it again.

I found this recipe because I was looking for an alternative (more natural, less salty) taco seasoning.  I love this recipe as is and I use about 4-5 tablespoons per pound of meat (beef or chicken).  I add about 1/3 c. of water to make it coat the meat better.  I sometimes like a little more heat so I use spicy chili powder or add some cayenne.  But mostly love it as is and will never buy taco seasoning in a packet again!

Made tonight for dinner - good stuff!  It was missing a little something, maybe too much of a cumin flavor, but I'd make again!!

This quick and easy recipe saved Taco Night! I usually use a seasoning packet from the store, but discovered that we had none and I had already started cooking. In a panic, I pulled up this recipe and threw it all together. Thank you for sharing this, it turned out great!

The balance here is fantastic.  I recommend omitting the red pepper flakes if it is too spicy since they are easy for each individual to use at the table to spice things up if needed.  I like my taco meat sort of saucy, so for each recipe (I always make a giant batch - so multiply accordingly!) I add 1 tsp of cornstarch to the mixture.  This thickens whatever liquid you use when simmering and doesn't take away from the fabulous flavor!

Took less time to make than going and getting a packet at the store. NO MSG!!! You can control and tweak it to suit your individual taste.

I made this recipe tonight to spice up the refried beans.  I didn't have onion granules and I used 1/2 the amount of sea salt as I am not a big of salt.  This version was a little too hot for my husband and myself.  I usually put hot sauce on  to add flavor and spicy hot, but I couldn't do this with this recipe.  Next time I won't be adding the crust chili to it.  Otherwise, it was great.  I won't be buying packets of taco seasoning again.  Thank you for the recipe!  Definitely converted.

Like others have said, I will never buy packaged taco seasoning again.  This took about 5 minutes to make, and I always have all of these ingredients on hand.  My husband said that the spiciness was almost at his threshold.  But I like things of medium spiciness and I thought it was perfect.  One of the best things about it -- no MSG!  I will use this from now on....

I will never, EVER buyh taco seasoning as long as I live.  I love that I can adjust the seasonings to my tastes (I love the smoky flavor of cumin, so I add a little more than the recipe calls for), but that's the beauty of this recipe.  Packets ALWAYS come out too salty for my tastes, but this is taco magic!  Much more authentic flavor, fresher, more robust and accentuates any dish where 'taco' meat is required.  I've used it as a gift idea and even served it up as a Tex-Mex dinner for my brother and his family who live in Maine!  My nieces LOVED it! Thanks!

I used this in a slow cooker to make chicken for tacos/burritos. It was perfect - I used the entire 10-serving amount, plus 2 cups of chicken broth and a small can of tomato sauce, and it was perfect!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and made turkey tacos.  This seasoning blend has a fresh and spicey taste without being overwhelming.  My family loved it and they are picky about spices. I will not buy pre-packaged taco mix again.

I doubled this using cayenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes.  Broke up 1 pound ground beef in the crock pot, sprinkled 2tbsp of the seasoning over the meat, poured jar of tomato sauce, 3/4 jar water, large can of drained black beans.  Cooked on high for 2 hours and added 1 bag of success boil in the bag brown rice to the pot and cooked until the rice was done about 20-30 minutes.  Served with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, crushed tortilla chips.

This is fantastic.  I make HUGE amounts of this and keep it tightly sealed in a canning jar so that I have it on hand at all times. I use it to season my chicken/beef/pork/ etc. for burritos, enchiladas, chili, nachos, refried beans, sloppy joes and so on. I even threw some into pan while preparing bacon for huevos rancheros last weekend. You can't go wrong with this. It's SO MUCH MORE than just taco seasoning. Thanks Bill!

This is great! I don't have to remember to buy taco seasoning, and I keep my other spices fresh by using them up faster.

Good seasoning! A little too spicy for my 3 and 5 year old, but I use it in a lot of different dishes. Hamburgers are great with a little of this added. Sure saves on the packets, and I love the idea that there's no MSG in it!! Thanks!

I used a scant tbsp of chili powder, heaping 1/4 tsps of the garlic and onion powders, a heaping 1/4 tsp of paprika, a heaping tsp of cumin, 1/4 tsp of sea salt, a few grinds of fresh black pepper, 1/2 tsp of brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp of unsweetened cocoa powder.  This yielded a very flavorful, mild seasoning.  I then cooked a chopped onion in my pan with a little olive oil until translucent before adding 1 lb of ground beef, which I browned and drained the fat from.  Next I added about 1.5 tbsp of the taco seasoning to the beef, and stirred in 2/3 cup water mixed with 1 tbsp corn starch, which simmered down to make delicious, saucy tacos.  Yummo!

most excellent, had to quit using salt for health reasons. This has loads of flavor!! No need to use mixes, now I can control the amount of salt I use. Used flour trick, worked great! Great color too...

This is an excellent recipe -- you can adjust it to your liking or indredients on hand.  I don't normally have sea salt, so I use regular salt, but use 1/2 of the amount of what is called for with the sea salt.  Also use 1/2 of the black pepper.  I also have added a dash or so of sugar.  Just try this - lots of room for experimenting.

Double or triple (or more!) this recipe and keep ready to go in an air-tight container. Great Sprinkled on omelet! (Might want to cut back the cumin a bit, though, unless you are a fan)

I love this recepie!!!!! I will NEVER buy the store bought "envelopes" again!!! I did take the advice of some of the other comments and scale back a little on the red pepper flakes, it doesn't seem like alot but a little goes a long way.. I also have to be honest, as the "envelopes" call for sugar I used one little pack of SPLENDA! i had browned 2 Lbs of gr beef and that one little pack of splenda was all I needed to put it over the top!!! Thanks I love it!

I like this because I can control the amount of salt added.  It doesn't taste exactly like the kind I am used to, but with a little tweaking I think it will be good.

Delicious!  I'm still working on getting the perfect amount for tacos but I've found about a tablespoon does the trick!  Love it!  Alittle spicy for young ones so I'd suggest toning down the red flakes if you can't take the heat!

My husband found this recipe last year when I was away on business and his taste buds got bored.  We have not used a store-bought taco seasoning since.  Works great on ground beef, turkey or chicken, but here's my favorite use - get some boneless, skinless chicken breast fillets, completely coat them with this seasoning, then broil them for 7 minutes on each side.

We love this at my house.  I use 1/2 the amount of red pepper flakes and 1/2 the amount of black pepper to make it a bit less spicy.  I blend all of it together with my Magic Bullet.  It is amazing!

Five star with my changes. I only used 1 1/2 tsp. chili powder, eliminated the oregano, upped the cumin to 2 tsp. and only used 1/2 tsp. black pepper. I added this to 2 lbs. of beef and the used the beef in the Burrito Pie also from this site. It was outstanding!

So nice to make this! It is much cheaper and healthier than the pre-made mixes in the store!

We never buy taco seasoning since this is so easy to make and tastes great.  We have always used it on chicken, but would like to try it on beef too.

EXCELLENT. I used this to season tacos that I served to my boyfriend and he was practically inhaling them. I will definitely use this again. It's so flavorful, but not overpowering, tasted authentic, I can't say anything bad about it.

I love this recipe and have used it several times! Many of the store packets of taco seasoning have hidden amounts of dairy, it's just not needed. I cut the salt to maybe a 1/4 tsp tops and amped up the red pepper a little more. I just mixed it right in with the meat tonight (Bison) and browned with the meat, then let it simmer a bit. Perfect!

Very good! Easy and I I had the ingredients on hand. I used the entire batch for a little over a pound of hamburger and added 2/3 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of sour cream and let it all simmer until the water cooked away. Definitely much better than store bought. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! Made this last night because I needed taco seasoning for Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup (Patti). I will not buy the packaged stuff anymore!!! Bill's recipe is pretty straightforward, but I will make a few recommendations that I hope will help everyone else. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO USE THE BEST QUALITY SPICES YOU CAN AFFORD (or find). I live close to a spice shop that sells a variety of reasonably priced spices, so I'm lucky, I guess.... I was able to purchase a few specific ones just for this recipe - Mexican oregano, smoked Hungarian paprika, fresh ground chile pepper, sea salt and a mix of whole peppercorns (I ground fresh pepper specifically for this). All I can say is WOW! My soup was fantastic and I attribute that to using a great spice blend as the base. Try this. You'll be happy you did. :-)

For those of us with a garlic allergy, this is a life-saver. Leave out the garlic powder (of course) and we're back in tacos. I have a jar of this blend in my spice shelf now. Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I made it almost exactly according to the recipe, just added a little more red pepper flakes.  My husband and I like things on the spicy side.  Made a large batch so I always have it ready.  Like the other reviews I used 3 Tbsp seasoning for 1 Lb. ground beef.  I added 2 tsp. cornstarch to 2/3 cup water, mixed well and then added it to the meat and seasoning mixture which gave a nice thickness.  Will pass this recipe on to others, thank you.

very good recipe! I live in Korea and it's impossible to buy pre-mixed taco seasoning, so this is definitely a keeper for me. And the someone said this recipe was "missing something," and added beef bouillon....Well, that "missing" ingredient is MSG!!! Beef bouillon, although they say they're "MSG free," aren't really MSG free... So this recipe is wonderful!!!

Really, really excellent.  I didn't have any onion powder, so I chopped one medium yellow onion and cooked it with the ground beef.  Tasted great!

I think it is great, but I wish it was a little spicier... might add serranos and onions next time for more flavor. But was great and easy to make

My husband had already had 2 tacos with this mix and when I asked him if he wanted more, he said, "a LOT more!" This recipe beats any store bought mix and will be the new staple in our spice cabinet!

I used this to make shrimp quesidilias.  This was an excellent seasoning.  I made 5 servings but doubled the garlic and onion powder.  I left out the cumin b/c I didn't have any, but I will definately add it next time.  I put the rest away for another time.

This  recipe is SO much better than any taco seasoning mix you'd buy in a packet at the grocery. Since it's prepared from pantry staples, it's an easy matter to mix it up. I quadrupled the recipe and put it in a little storage container with the usage instructions written on the front - I used 3 tablespoons per pound of meat, simmered with half a cup of hot water. Perfect!  My family likes things spicy, so I doubled the amount of red pepper and used cayenne instead of crushed red pepper flakes.

Love this! Smells so good. I tripled the amount to keep on hand. Now I don't have to waste a dollar plus on the boring taco packet at the store. I immediately used this on Taco Turkey Wraps!

I use this savory Tex-Mex seasoning in soups, chilis, tacos, Queso Dip and other dishes. It has just the right amount of heat for me, but if you really like to sweat, go ahead and modify the ingredients. I 10x the recipe and put the mixture into a large glass jar so I don't have to mix it everytime I need a little pizzazz in my recipes.

I made this before but made the mistake of only using a couple teaspoons for one pound of meat. It wasn't good. I figured I'd try it one more time after reading the glowing reviews and seeing the amount others used. I ended up mixing 2T flour in the mix so it was ready to use straight from the fridge. I ended up using 5 T for 1 1/2 lbs. of meat and it was great. Again, the 5T included the flour mixed in. I'm sold.

This was so good! I'll use this instead of a store bought seasoning because it's better. It's also probably healthier. There isn't anything I don't like about it. I put in more crushed red pepper because I love spicy food

This mix is great. I like the flavor and I like that I can control the salt. I do feel that it needs a little bit more but it is still significantly less that the pre-mixed stuff.

This is the best. I haven't used anything else for tacos for a couple of years now. It is also wonderful in the "Slow Cooker Tamale Casserole."

This seasoning is fantastic, I've been using it for about a year now.  SO much better than the packaged stuff, and I like knowing exactly what's in it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

For the second time, I made beef burritos, with ground beef, black beans, brown rice, and topped it with cheese. My kids who "don't eat spicy stuff and defiantly NOT meat"..ate two. Our friends thought I was a master chef! I will never buy the stuff in the store again!

After making this simple, inexpensive and flavorful seasoning, I feel silly for buying packets all these years.  I didn't add red pepper flakes--I'm not a fan of major spice, so I didn't even have them in my spice cabinet to add had I wanted to!  I also added a bit more onion and garlic powder.  While making this, I consolidated two half-used jars of basil into one, and now store my taco seasoning in the remaining empty.   It will be a staple of my spice/seasoning collection--thanks!

EXCELLENT!  I'm really glad I found this recipe!  I do think next time I'll omit the oregano and use dried minced onion instead.  But even as is - it's so close to the pre-packaged stuff - without all the bazaar, unhealthy ingredients.

Perhaps some of the spices I used were older than they should have been, but the flavor of this seasoning did not live up to my expectations.  It smelled wonderful, but didn't taste quite as good.  I would have preferred something more tangy and less peppery.  I think I'll stick with my current packet-mixing tactics.

I didn't have any packages for my burritos so I looked this up.  I didn't think it would make any difference, but I won't go back to packages.  Awesome!  Doubled recipe and added 1Tbsp of flour and 1 and 1/3 cup of water to 2 pounds of browned meat, 1 can of refried beans and a 10 oz can of green chiles.  Best I've had, restaurant quality (not fast food - beats fast food hands down)!

I used this recipe while making an enchilada recipe on this site - this was the only ingredient I was missing.  This turned out much tastier than the packets which I don't even like.  Spicier too!  I don't know that I'll ever buy a packet again.

I will never go back to store-bought taco seasoning again!  I often buy ground beef for tacos as ground turkey is so bland, but with this seasoning you can't even tell the difference whether you're eating ground beef or ground turkey.  I add this stuff to soups, stews, and pretty much anything I cook in the slow-cooker.  The recipe is just about perfect as it is.

this is sooo good!  i didn't change a thing.  my husband was complaining because i wasn't using the taco seasoning packet and he thought it wouldn't taste as good, but he bit into his taco and instantly took back all his prior complaints.  I'm going to make a big batch of this so I can just take what I need when i need it.  No more packets for us!

I added cayenne pepper instead of crushed red pepper flakes.  This is a really good taco seasoning for ground beef AND chicken. Since I already had all the ingredients I saved money by not buying that packaged stuff. The packaged stuff has sugar and other fillers that I prefer not to add to my already fresh ingredients. IMHO this recipe is just as good, if not, better.

We absolutely loved this seasoning.  I used a pinch of salt (personal preference) and didn't need to add any later.  Had a great flavor and not super spicy like the hot seasoning packets where your mouth is on fire.   Will not have to buy the salty prepared seasonings anymore!  Thank you!

Loved this and I wouldn't make any adjustments.  Used 3/4 c water and a tbsp of cornstarch, brought it to a boil and then simmered.  Came together great and my husband loved it!  I used ground turkey breast with it and it flavored it very well!

I made this mixture and have used it instead of a taco seasoning packet with both chicken for my omnivores and on veggies for me.  The only change I made was using chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder because I was out of it.  It turned out great!  I also added it to olive oil and lime juice to make a marinade and it was fabulous.  I now have a spice jar designated especially for this seasoning.

I've only tried this in a soup but it flavored the soup very nicely. I did make a few changes. I left out the onion because my husband is allergic to them. I also left out the red pepper flakes because I couldn't find them in my cabinets. Other than that I salted and peppered to taste. I liked being able to leave out what my husband couldn't eat. I have always had to skip recipes that called for taco seasoning packets because of my husbands allergies to onions and MSG. Thank you                                       To update I have now used the seasoning mix in other recipes and truly love the way it tastes.

I will never buy another packaged taco seasoning again.  Perfect seasoning blend for the chicken and rice soup I threw together.

I only had Ancho Chili Powder, garlic salt and oregano flakes on hand but this still turned out really good.  I rubbed this on chicken tenders, squeezed with a little lime, sauteed in nonstick cooking spray.  Was a little dry (from the nonstick spray I'm sure) so I added a few tablespoons of salsa and that made it even better!  Using the chicken as a topping for a chicken taco salad -- YUM!

I was surprised by how good my taco meat tasted with this seasoning, as compared to the taco seasoning packet that I have always used in the past. I will use this recipe from now on--no changes.

Great mix to have around. I like that I can control the salt unlike the mixes you buy in the store. Subbed a dash of cayenne pepper for the crushed red pepper flakes.

Perfect Taco seasoning! I used a very small amount of Cayenne Pepper (about 1/16th tsp) instead of the red pepper flakes. Thanks!

I don't think I'll ever buy packaged seasoning again.  These are spices I always have on hand.  I use about 3 T. per pound of meat.  There is a little left over, but I just save it until I make it again.  I cut back on the salt a little.

This smelled just right. I think it could be even spicier but some hot sauce could take care of that. I'm happy to find an MSG free solution as well. Thanks!

I found this recipe after realizing I was out of seasoning packets.  Wow, no more taco seasoning mixes for me!  I used extra garlic and onion.  Instead of paprika, I used extra chili powder.  I also added about 1/2 cup water and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good and such a no-brainer that I feel like an idiot for having ever bought the packaged stuff.  This is classic taco seasoning made with what is already on-hand.   I'll never buy another pouch of taco seasoning.  Tip:  One recipe makes about the amount you would need for one pound of ground beef if making tacos.

This was AWESOME. I absolutely loved it so much better than the packaged stuff. I will add a little more red pepper flakes next time, as I prefer my tacos a little spicy. I will definitely be using this instead of the packets from now on. Cheaper, better for you and tastier, what else could you ask for?

Not bad, but I like my seasoning a little saltier.  But that's easily corrected when frying the beef.

Great recipe!  I haven't mastered how much to add to my ground beef yet, but I'll have to try again.

I doubled the garlic and onion powders and divided the crushed red pepper in half only because of personal taste. I mixed this to a pound of brown 97% fat free ground beef and first made it into tacos, which were delicious, then later re-made the ground beef and put it into a mexican chip dip which was also delectable. Very good and would recommend to others.

Definitely a great and cheaper alternative to buying seasoning packets from the grocery store.  Much enjoyed at my house - I made a larger quantity so I have a container of it in the spice cabinet to grab and use whenever it's needed.

Very good... inexpensive (I bought bulk of what I didn't have and spent less than $1)... not too spicey, and easy to make a lot of.

I found myself panicking when I had everything for soft tacos but no seasoning! I tried this out (minus the red pepper because I was feeding a toddler as well :) and it was dee-lish! Hubby, who is super picky, also liked it.  I found that one batch as written was perfect for a little over one pound of ground meat. I plan on making a big batch of this and storing! yum!

It's a bit spicy for us, so we make a mild version by cutting back on the chili. But, I always keep it on hand and never buy taco seasoning anymore.  We also use this in the Seven Layer Taco Dip from this site.

Very good.  Who knew it was so easy?  I added a bit of corn flour and cornstarch, but dunno if I needed to.  Will definitely make lots of it to have on hand for taco night.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  Everyone at the party kept commenting on the flavor of the meat.  It gives it a different taste than the store bought seasonings.  I did cut the crushed red pepper in half.  I browned my meat, drained the fat, then dusted the seasoning over the meat and added 2/3 c water per lb of meat.  I did use about 3 T per lb of meat.  Excellent!!!!  You'll never buy store bought again.

Very good, flavorful, with a good amount of spiciness.  I browned my ground beef with diced onion, green bell pepper and minced garlic (I omitted the onion powder from the recipe); added a generous amount of this seasoning with about 1/3 cup water and let it simmer down.  Worked great, much better than the seasoning packet I usually use, I'm glad I ran out!  I will be using this from now on.

Based on smell and the fact that I had everything w/o having to buy anything, 4 stars just on that. Am making nachos later tonight, will review again after we've had some nachos.  I'm also thinking of using some of this in my Spanish rice dish.

Loved this simple to make seasoning!  My young daughter was able to assemble the entire recipe on her own.  Used suggestions of others and added 2 tsp. of corn starch and 2/3 c. water.  I will not be buying seasoning packets again.  Thank you!

This was great. I used it in a chicken tortilla soup I have made a ton of times and everyone wanted to know what I did to finally perfect the recipe. If I was going to use this seasoning to cook for my son then I would have made it a little spicier.

AMAZING!!! I used only 1/2 tsp of the sea salt and 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. I also didn't have any onion powder and it was still delicious! I love the idea about jarring it and giving it as gifts.  Beautiful recipe!

This was so easy and really good.  I keep all of these spices/herbs on hand anyway so it was easy to do.  I will continue to use this in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you!  I hate buying prepared foods but never thought about making my own taco seasoning.  My family never noticed it was not the same old package.  I now make a large batch and store in a zip lock bag for future uses.

I like more flavor than spice, and this recipe has a LOT of heat.  I decided to add a tsp. of beef bullion like someone else suggested, but that made it taste like lipton beefy onion soup mix.  I will add more flavorful herbs and spices next time and less chili powder and flakes.

Great! I am doing a low carb diet and did not want flour in my taco seasoning. All the store ones have it. This was just as good as any store one and I think even better! It has a little spicy kick witch I loved!

I've been using this for awhile now and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it.  This is now my standby taco seasoning-no more packets for us!  Perfect as is and I always have the spices on hand.  I use about a tsp of corn starch to about 2/3 cup of water to make a nice sauce.  I also use about 1/8 or less of red pepper powder instead of red pepper flakes.  Thnaks for the recipe!

What makes this recipe exceptional is the fact that it does not have MSG, sugar or artificial flavorings.  This is a perfectly flavored recipe. I used the entire quantity for one pound of ground beef, we like our tacos spicy. Very delicious.  I will use this recipe from now on instead of the prepackaged mix.

Love this. Per other reviewers, I use about 1 Tbsp per pound of meat and add some water to the meat and let the mix cook down and thicken. Yummy! This mix now has its own jar in my spice cupboard.

Toss out those packets, this stuff is great!  Easy to compile, spicy, with just enough zing to it.  The best thing is that it is adaptable, so you can make it spicier or less spicy to suit your tastes.  I no longer use the 'taco' packs at the store, thanks to this recipe!

Yippeeee Yahoooeeeee!  This recipe is so simple and perfect for tacos.  Especially for kids!!!  I have THE pickiest 9 year old and he even said..."Mom, these are the best tacos you've ever made!"    I sort of feel like Homer Simpson (D'oh) - because I just can't believe after several years of making tacos that I haven't thought to make my own seasonings before.  Recently, I have been trying different brands - just hating the taste - too much salt, too much cumin, too much MSG, artificial flavors, etc.  We have "Taco Tuesday" at our house - and my kids really look forward to it - but last week the store was out of their favorite brand - so I tried the store brand. A disaster - so much sodium that it was just inedible.    Today, I came on here in search of something simple and very tasty.  This is it!!   I made a couple of adjustments for the kids' tacos:  I omitted the crushed red pepper and only put about 1/2 of the salt in - because it's sea salt, I realize that you tend to need more - but I thought I'd give it a shot.  It was just fine.  When my husband and I had our taco salads, I added in the crushed red pepper and it was so great!  I also did what someone else suggested - I combined 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour right into the seasoning mix (prior to adding to the meat), and added 2/3 cup of water.  Again, perfect!  I am so happy to say that I will never buy taco seasoning in the package again!!  Thank you for posting this recipe!!

I have been using this mixture for a long time now and refer to the recipe often to mix up another batch.  It needs no adjusting whatsoever - it's perfect as is.  My only suggestion is to double it because you'll go back for more.

This taco seasoning is great!  I mixed it up as directed and used it in Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup on this site and loved it.  My kids thought it was too spicy, so I’ll cut back on the spicier ingredients next time.

Wow, I can't believe how good this was, I wanted to make taco's and realized that I didn't have a package of mix. I then came upon this recipe and had most of the ingredient's. I didn't have the sea salt, so table salt had to do. The spice was just perfect, I really enjoyed the flavor.

I had this recipe in my recipe box for a long time and never got around to making it, until yesterday.  We were in the middle of making tacos and discovered we were out of the prepackaged stuff.  It took no time to mix up and the tacos were delicious.  The crushed red pepper flakes made it a little too hot for my son but I think without them you would need to increase some of the other seasonings.

Fast and easy, and so much tastier and healthier than the stuff in a packet. It can also be adjusted for the level of heat, salt, and other preferences.

This is truly great.  I just reduce the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon though and I used regular salt instead of sea salt and used only 1/2 teaspoon.  I would never buy store taco seasoning again. Thank you.

Very flavorful but doesn't have any sort of kick or spiciness - definitely on the mild side. I followed other reviewers and added 1 TBSP cornstarch & 2/3 c. water to thicken the seasoning and allow the meat to soak it in. For the future I would substitute cayanne pepper for the red pepper flakes.

This was pretty good.  I have made it twice now and you definitly need to add over 2 tbs. to get flavor to 1 lb. of beef.  There still seems to be some missing flavor though.  Good starting point.

REALLY salty. I added another pound of ground beef just so that it wouldn't be so salty. Two stars simply because it did taste like taco meat.

I was on a search to make my own taco seasoning without all the MSG and salt. I will never use the store bought packet again. I didn't change a thing except I followed some of the other suggestions and added corn starch to help thicken. Thank you for a great MSG free seasoning!

Perfect! I used all of it for one pound of ground beef. I added it to the raw meat and browned it over medium heat. I drained the fat off and added the meat back into the pan. I then added one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and let it simmer until it cooked down a little. The tomato sauce just gives it a little more flavor as well as helps the meat stick together a little better for tacos, etc. This is definitely spicy, but we love tex mex!!! You could use less of the spice if you prefer a milder taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Great seasoning mix!  Very authentic.  The only thing I left out was the red pepper.  This is my new "staple" seasoning.  I used it in "Mexican Rice II" from this site as suggested by another reviewer and it was awesome!

Wonderful!!!  Followed a previous review to add 2 tsp. corn starch to 2/3 cup cold water, adding to the seasoning on the meat to warm through.  We used pork burger and it was seriously the best homemade taco seasoning we've made!!! :) We'll be making this in bulk!!!

Perfect!   If you don't like spicy....leave out the red pepper flake because it does give it a good kick!

It is the only taco seasoning I use now.  I only add a 1/2 tsp of red pepper.

Better than most packaged seasonings out there! You can add more or less of each spice as desired, and there is a lot less salt than the packaged kinds as well. Yum!!

For my taste the balance of spices is very good but I deducted a star for being too salty (yes, I used sea salt not table salt). I used an entire recipe for 1 lb of ground meat, but not quite enough of the spices for my taste. I added about 1 tsp cornstarch to browned seasoned meat as suggested by other reviewers, and after sauteing some water and that worked great. Once I tweak those amounts I think I will be much more happy, but I like things strongly flavored. Funny thing is I've used this recipe for the "Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup" on this site and found it perfect (oh, except for minus the salt, I added that separately). I'll definitely be keeping this spice blend, I just need to remember to make more "servings" than the default recipe and leave the salt to add separately.

I had no taco seasoning for a recipe (from this site, of course) so I looked up taco seasoning and went with this one.  I will never buy pre-packed again.  What's nice is you can tweak this to your family's taste and not worry about the high sodium, msg and preservatives the others have.  Thanks.

This works out very well and is easy to put together. Great seasoning for Mexican foods. A far superior substitute for the packaged taco seasoning, and a great submission.

This was awesome!  I omitted the red pepper flakes (don't like super spicy).  I was making "Dee's Roast Pork for Tacos" from this site, and didn't have a packet of taco seasoning.  I mixed this up in no time, and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice!!!!!!! I, like the others made some extra for the pantry. I used this on a Salsa Chicken recipe that I found on this site. Was such a good dinner. My husband is loving me more everytime I cook. I lost my job due to the economy so dinner has been extra yummy because I put a little more thought into it.

I made a huge batch of this seasoning mix a while back, and I just love using it to season ground beef for taco salad. It has a ton of flavor, and it beats those MSG-filled packets at the store. I brown some meat (usually 1 to 1.5 pounds) and drain off the fat, sprinkle 3T of this seasoning on top, add in 1 cup of water, cover, and simmer. It couldn't be easier! I like crushing tortilla chips or Doritos on the bottom (yeah, talk about MSG, right?!), putting the meat, some cheese, lettuce, avocado, red onion, tomato, and a big blob of sour cream on top. This spice blend is by far the best I've had. I love it!

I'm on a low carb diet and wanted to make a taco salad. The packaged seasoning had 4g carbs per 1/6 of a 1.25 oz packet. I always have a bunch of spices on hand, so this recipe was easy to put together. The seasoning blend was so awesome. Thanks for sharing. I will be making big batches of this!

I haven't bought Taco Seasoning in years because of this recipe.  It is also good to use up the seasonings I already have in my cupboard.  They are only good so long.

Good!! My husband doesnt like the packet mixes  so I was able to modify this  to exclude the chili powder my husband did not like, it still tasted good! i used the "10" servings of seasoning  for 1lb of hamburger. I think i might cut down just a pinch on the cumin next time....

I am not usually so disappointed with allrecipes recipes.  I didn't like this at all.  I am a die hard seasoning packet fan so I'm sure that had something to do with it.  Actually, there is only one kind of seasoning I like or use so I guess that's the problem.  Anyway, it was way too hot and it didn't taste anywhere near the seasoning packet I usually use.  I was happy to use all of my own ingredients and know exactly what was in the combination.  I used three tablespoons (which was all the recipe made) for about a pound and a half of ground beef.  WAY too hot and not what I was looking for at all!

No need to buy the packs of seasoning any longer! Fantastic blend of spices. I doubled it and used about 3tbsp for 1 lb of ground turkey. Makes me feel good knowing what is exactly going into my dish. Thanks for the great recipe.

What a great alternative to pre-packaged Taco Seasoning. We love tacos and this really makes it easy! I play around with the spices a bit depending on what my tastes are that day (more spice or less). I am going to make up a huge batch of this and put it in my spice cabinet for future use!

I usually use extra chili powder in recipes, but even after using slightly less than 1 T of chili powder and leaving out the red pepper flakes, it's too hot for me. I wouldn't mind, if I could actually taste the other ingredients through the heat. I added more water and even beans to try and cool it down, but it didn't work.

Excellent way to utilize spices that are already in the cabinet! Tastes just like it without the preservatives. I will leave the sea salt out next time.

I loved this seasoning.  I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to give it a try!!!  It was worth the chance, my new go to seasoning for sure.  It was soooo good and just could not be any easier.  I did take advice from one person that suggested adding a little flour to meat when adding the seasoning (3 TBS per pound of meat)and then when it was coated nicely I added a quarter-cup water per pound of meat.  I let it simmer about ten minutes.  I was using ground venison but I am sure beef is wonderful too.

Great taco taste. Use a chilli powder that you like though. The first time I made it, it tasted kinda burnt (because of the chilli powder I used) and the second time it was very spicy even though I omited the pepper (again because of the chilli powder)

Great flavor, WITHOUT MSG!  Love it.  I used 3 T. of this mix to 2# hamburger, added some tomato basil salad dressing and chopped green chilis, and put it on lettuce that had already been tossed with Western-type dressing.  Added shredded cheese, black olives, diced onion, and diced tomatoes - and dinner was served.

Yum! I am trying to cut down on salt and this turned out great. I modified it a bit with a small can of tomatoe paste and I added two onions and crushed garlic. I also added 1.25 cup of chicken broth after I cooked the onions and meat with the spices. I then let it simmer down until it was thick--just like the packets tell you. My husband and I loved it. Goodbye packaged taco seasoning. ;-p

LOVE IT! I use this to avoid MSG in the packets. I've been using it for years. I have given friends the recipe, and they LOVE it also. I make it in double and triple batches, and keep in an empty spice jar so I always have it on hand.

Very good. Omitted red pepper flakes so it wouldn't be too hot for my little guy.  I browned 1.25 lb ground beef, added this seasoning and 8 oz can tom sauce.

This was great!  I was out of onion powder, but it worked well without it.  I used this in Slow Cooker Taco Soup from this site (which is fabulous!), and it was perfect.  I will use all the time!

I've been using this recipe for years now and it is wonderful. I wanted to make a couple of notes. First, I personally don't use "chili powder" as in chili seasoning, which already has a lot of the same ingredients as this recipe and usually a ton of salt, sometimes fillers, etc., but rather the ground chilis that I find in the Mexican foods section of most grocery stores. They usually have a few different varieties, ranging in degrees of "hotness." Second, if you like this recipe, do yourself a favor and increase the servings to 40 and make a big batch all at once.

Tryed this and it was pretty good.  Is a bit on the spicy side, but I like that.  Would suggest this instead of going to buy a package that is half the taste and twice the price.

Followed all ingredients, except added Cayenne Pepper instead of red pepper flakes. I would not add as much Cayenne as what is called for Red Pepper flakes next time, as it was just tad bit too hot! But oh so yummy! I prefer this well over the taco packets, now!

My husband liked this, but I did not. It tasted blah and powdery, but this is what I did: Tipped by another reviewer, I added 1/2 Tbsp. flour to 3 Tbsp. of this mix to one pound of ground beef.  After grilling (flour flavor would have well cooked out by this time) I added 2/3 cup water.  I tasted it and decided to add a couple Tbsp. of grated fresh onion to give it some oompf.  It only helped a little.  *Note* some of my spices were old, and that could very well be the problem.

PUTS THE PACKAGED TACO SEASONING TO SHAME!  I make 1/2 of this recipe and use it on 1 lb ground bison meat for bison tacos... Amazing and figure friendly!

This was wonderful!  I have some dietary restrictions, plus I like to make things from scratch & now I no longer have to buy packaged (and preserved) spices!    I also reduced the red pepper (but I know I can increase it if I need to make it spicier).  I added the corn starch to the spice mixture which made it a little cakey so I'll probably add it when I make the actual meal.

This is the closest thing I have found to the store bought blends.  I use it in taco meat and in rice.

WOW!!! I should have known .. I dunno why I ever bought taco seasoning. I always had the spices at home. Believe it or not I found this recipe because I didnt want to go to the store for one thing....we all know what ends up happening when u go to the store for 1 thing..it turns into $30 later... This was a great recipe. Tasted Much better than store bought seasoning .. thats all loaded with msg and sodium. yuck.. i luv this i will keep it and use it all the time. I used less chili powder b/c my husband is not into the spicey stuff.. and always add fresh onions and garlic b/c it makes it taste FRESHER....and more FLAVOURFUL. I also added a little garlic powder just for the extra garlic kick.  thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe!!!  It will be very spicy, so if you dont like the heat dont add the crushed red peppers.  It is just as wonderful with it as it is without, just not as hot.  I will use this in place of packet seasoning from now on.

Just what I needed, I ALWAYS forget to buy the packets!  At first I thought "something is missing" - it's all the salt as others said!  Healthier and easier, love it!

WOW!  WONDERFUL!  I used 2 tbsp of this mix with 1 lb of ground beef.  I added two things: nearly 2/3 cup of water and 1 1/2 tsp of flour after I drained the meat, then let it boil a bit.  I won't go use a packet of mix with MSG in it; I'll use this.

EXCELLENT!  Have been converted to no more packets!  Perfect amount for 1 lb of ground beef!  I will lighten up on the red pepper for next time as it was a bit spicy for the young ones!  Very tasty!

Have been using this recipe for many months now, it is a great addition to many latin recipes.  I love how I control sodium content which is important to me. The family says this seasoning tastes better and fresher than any packet!! THANKS FOR POSTING!

I can't add much to what has already been said. This a great taco seasoning recipe. There is no need to ever buy the overpriced packaged stuff again. I use taco seasoning in a lot of dishes, so thank you Bill, you will have saved me a lot of money over the long haul.  I do add a little corn starch as others have suggested though.

I love this stuff... I multiply the recipe by about 10 to have bulk supply on hand. Though I am not exact in measuring, the only change I deliberately make is to omit the salt, as I simply prefer to add salt myself. But if I was making this just for a single recipe, the amount of salt listed is just fine.

Loved it!  It was a bit spicy for my family but I used cayenne pepper instead of just regular chili powder.  

This is what I did instead:

1 tablespoon Cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
1 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 
1 teaspoon paprika 
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 
1/2 teaspoon black pepper 

Added sea salt to taste. When preparing the tacos, I add one clove fresh garlic and some fresh cilantro (finely minced).

I liked the seasoning. I think I used all of it on 1 to 1.5 lb grnd beef and after cooking for a bit added about 1/2 cup water and maybe 1T or so of flour mixed with a tad of water.  Wanted to add tomato paste but had none so I threw a dash of ketchup in there. I plan to use this as my regularly when I make taco beef.

Like this because you don't get all the salt. You can adjust to how much you want not like the taco seasoning packages. This also has more kick.

I was looking for a recipe for just the taco seasoning.  This was it!  I used it with a pound of ground beef.  I did sprinkle the cornstarch on the beef mixture and added 2/3 cup hot water to the pan.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks, Bill.

Awesome seasoning!  I won't go back to store bought again.  After making it the first time, I did make one slight change.  My younger children thought it was too spicy so I omitted the cayenne pepper and that did the trick.  Great recipe!

yummm!!! so much better than the packaged ones!! i didnt have onion powder, so i just substituted w/ more garlic powder. The amount that this recipe makes is how much i used for 1 pound of ground beef. I also mixed in 2 tsp of corn starch before adding it to the browned meat. and added 2/3 cup water to simmer in.

Followed recipe to a T except for the crushed red pepper which I halved for the sake of my fiance's heartburn/acid reflux and it still had a bit of kick to it (more medium than mild). 

Otherwise this is excellent and will be the way I season ground beef for mexican dishes from now on.

Made as indicated except I used cayenne for the pepper flakes and Montreal Steak seasoning for the salt and pepper.  I put the whole thing in with 1 1/4 lbs. browned hamburger and 8 oz. of tomato sauce.

I liked this, as I had everything needed when I didn't have an envelope of pre-made taco seasoning. I guess I am a bit partial to saltier things because i thought this was a bit bland.

Love this stuff!  It can also used for a rub when cooking a pork loin - just brush with olive oil, sprinkle with seasoning, and cook.

This recipe is the best!  I use EVERYtime I make tacos and quesadillas...usually every week (our rotation is quite small).  I always add about a 1/2 cup of salsa, and it is delish!  Thanks, Bill!

Really great!  Like others I substituted cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes.  I love my taco's to have fresh onions so I used those instead of the powder.  It's much more economical to make your own spice mixes so I will add jars of this to my refill jars of Emeril's Essence and Emeril's Southwestern Blend.

I will NEVER buy packaged taco seasoning again! This was soooooooo good and in the mean time my kids are learning how to cook as well and learning that you can save money preparing your own seasoning with what you already have in the house.

Like one of the other reviewers, I didn't have any red pepper.  I went with half the amount of cayenne and it turned out great.  I also wasn't sure how much this makes - but it seemed to make the amount you'd find in one spice package.

This recipe is simple to make and has a nice balance of all of the taco flavors that one would expect in traditional style tacos.  I love that this recipe omits the cornstartch typical of many other similar recipes!

I settled on this recipe bc I  had enough of everything to make this.  Excellent!  Bf didn't notice it was homemade (he prefers the little packets--I know, a philistine!) and I like that it made enough for my dish and probably another one--I don't want a huge container of taco seasoning laying around.  Thanks!

This is really convenient and it tastes really good.  The only thing I did different is add about a 1/2 t. of cornstarch.  I cooked some leftover shredded pork with the taco seasoning and added a 1/2 c. water to the meat and simmered for about 10 minutes.  It was great!

Great Recipe!  I will never again buy packaged seasoning.  Can be made with things that are already on hand.

My family likes things pretty spicy, so next time I'll up the red pepper. But great overall flavor.

First, half the amount of black pepper, in my opinion it was a little too noticeable.  Although, I did use freshly ground black pepper, and that may have affected the potency.

Otherwise, amazing.  I use to just "wing it" for taco seasoning, but following this recipe is much better and delicioso.  Five stars!!!

Extremely easy! There is no difference in this and the packaged variety in the stores.  I usually keep all of these spices in my pantry already.  I will make my own from now on, and not fret if I am out of the packaged variety.

Tried this recipe last night because I really did not want to run to the store just to pick up a packet of seasoning. This tastes just like the seasoning from the packet only a bit spicier. I will absolutely make this again!

I was impressed. I hate buying packaged taco seasoning because there's WAY too much sodium in them. Much better alternative. Thanks!

Fantastic.  I made a minor change because I did not have onion powder.  I browned ground chicken and added an onion instead of the onion powder.  I used the chicken mixture, pinto beans, lettuce, tomato, salsa, sour cream and avocado on a flour tortilla that I toasted slightly and folded over like a taco.  It was delicious!

mixed reviews in my house. Made exactly as writter and hubby loved it however for me it was too hot.  I think it was the black pepper that was overwhelming for me. I will play around with the recipe as i always find store bought mixes too salty and love the idea of making my own.

This is the best!  My family loved it!  I added a pinch of cayenne for a little spice.  My son said "this tastes like authentic Mexican, not like the fake kind we usually have".  No more store bought taco seasoning!

Perfect.  I had these spices on hand, and I feel more "authentic" than someone grabbing the taco seasoning packet with too much sodium.

This was good.  I like that I can control the amounts of the ingredients in the mix and nothing artificial.  I used this for the Spicy Baked Sweet Potato Fries from this site.  Even though I didn't care for it on the sweet potatoes, I liked the flavor of the mix itself and will try it the next time I make tacos.

Amazing!!!  I used this in a chicken dish that called for a packet of taco seasoning and will never go back to the store bought again!  This is free from any starchy additives and just so flavorful.  I can't recommend this highly enough!

I think these is a great substitute for the packaged seasoning mix you get at the store.  It's spicier than we were used to, but that's not a bad thing!  The only thing I think it lacked is salt - it just didn't taste like there was enough there.  But that's easily corrected, and even possibly worth leaving it up to the person eating the dish to correct themselves, for their own taste.

I made this for my finicky eater (son) and he loved it.  Tastes better than the seasoning packets you buy in the store.  I will definitely make a bunch and store it and will use it over and over.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best from scratch recipe I have tried.  I omitted the onion powder because I didn't have any on hand.  I also added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to add more thickening.

I use this recipe regularly, but I combine a part from the Restaurant-Style Taco Meat Seasoning recipe, the cornmeal.

The best mix for tacos.  I will never buy this in the store again. Instead of onion powder, I use dried onion flakes, it makes a big difference.

Excellent flavour! I will not buy store bought again. The only change I made was to reduce the sea salt to 1/4 tsp.

I used the quantities in this recipe to make 12 "Mexican Turkey Burgers". 

Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this and always keep some on hand.  I like that you can increase the recipe and add more or add less.  I'm a spicy lover but the rest of the family isn't so sometimes I just add more to my own personal serving ;)

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly, but doubled it for two pounds of ground beef. Added almost 2 cups of water to the browned hamburger, all of the seasoning and simmered for about 20-30 minutes. Cooled and refrigerated over night and used for taco salad the next day! Was great; had just the right "heat" for my family, but that could easily be adjusted according to your own preference. This one is a keeper!

Fantastic recipe. I fried some mince beef in a tiny bit of oil until brown, drained and rinsed the meat with boiling hot water, put it back in a saucepan, and poured my seasoning over it. I then stirred in about 260ml of cold water and left to simmer for about 40 minutes. When the liquid had gone I stirred in 1 tin of chopped tomatoes and added some salsa and left to simmer for a further 10 minutes. Served in corn tortillas with sour cream, salsa, jalapenoes, lettuce, cheese and fresh chopped tomatoes. Family loved it. Will definately cook this again!!

Wonderful substitute for the packets, and it's all fresh!  No artificial anything.  I plan to use this again tonight, but when I used it last time, I didn't change a thing.  Followed the tip from a previous reviewer about using a little cornstarch mixed with water to make a sauce; it's fantastic.  Looking forward to dinner tonight!

This seasoning mix made the best tacos ever! No more seasoning packets for us!  I used 2 tablespoons for every pound of ground beef, but it wasn't quite spicy enough. Next time, I will try 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons. Thanks for sharing!

I was making taco pizza today and realized that I was out of taco seasonings, so I thought I would give this a try. I didn't have any cumin and was worried that it would not turn out right, I was wrong this is fantastic, so now I can't wait to try it with the cumin in it. I will not be buying ready made taco seasonings anymore! THANKS for the recipe!

We weren't too impressed with this.  It had some spice to it, but not a lot of flavor.

I cant yet review it, but wanted to thank Bill for posting this. 

I've often made my own, but I never paid attention to how much of each ingredient I used. The kids always liked what I whipped up, but it was honestly a little hit or miss. 

Thanks again!

This tasted better than the premade taco seasoning, because I was able to control the amount of sodium.  This is a keeper.

I rated this only 4 because my husband didn't love it as much as I did. I was planning on making tacos until I found out I didn't have any mixes, and not enough time to change dinner plans. This worked out well.

This is the FIRST time that my husband said the homemade version was BETTER than the pre-packaged version.  I whole heartedly agree.  I did add extra garlic because we like it, and reduced the cayenne cause my kids are weenies.  That's the beauty of this stuff, totally customizable to one's tastes!  When I used it, it took about 2 tb for a little less than 1lb of meat.  I added a slurry of 1 tsp cornstarch and about 1/4c water to the pot to get that sauce effect.  This also worked nicely on my Morningstar Farms "grilled chicken" stuff (I don't eat meat), just be careful because the soy or whatever is used to make the fake chicken really pulls in the moisture.

GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!  I reduced the salt...(boy friends blood pressure). It is easy and doesn't take long at all! Make plenty of it because you will use it all the time.  I didn't add dried onion because I put it in all my ground meat.  Thanks for this 10 star recipe!!!

This was excellent!  The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of tomato sauce in addition to the water and spices.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, this was so yummy.  I followed exactly as the recipes called for, and used about half the seasoning on 1 lbs beef.

Why buy the pre-made stuff when you can make this--Love how the flavor comes out with this. We use this recipe for ground turkey tacos.
Thank you :)

This worked great for me. I used about half of the pepper flakes, because it would have been too spicy for some of my kids. I won't be buying any more mixes at the store! This tastes better and I know exactly what's in it. Thanks.

I used this seasoning in the SLOW COOKER CHICKEN TACO SOUP found on this site, it turned out absolutely fantastic, even though there was one spice that didn,t seem to belong. I believe it was the cumin. I will use this seasong again for sure but will either omit or cut down the cumin. It all boils down to ones own personal taste. I would suggest making it without the cumin first then if you decide it is missing something then add it. Easier to add spices to a recipe than to remove.

Followed the recipe to the "T" and it was fabtastic!  It was nice to find a seasoning that I could eat being on a low-sodium restriction that had a ton of flavor.  I will never go back to the pre-made packets.

Good and easy to make. I used all natural spices so no preservatives (unlike most of the store bought seasoning).

Very good. I used this when I ran out of the packet mix and will definitely use this next time. The only thing I did was use half the amount of cumin - but I am not a fan of cumin.

This taco seasoning is over the top!  My four year old son mixed it together to give as Christmas gifts(he kept calling it Taco Susan!) and it was a huge hit.  My husband raves everytime I cook with it.  I will never make a different recipe!

My husband is the cook in the family and with us being separated for several months, he has been encouraging me to work on my cooking skills and learn more about different spice combinations.  I went to make myself some tacos tonight and found we were out of seasoning packets, so I decided I had to try this seasoning that had such high reviews--and so many of them!  I have to agree that this is a wonderful mix.  I didn't have two of the ingredients, though: onion powder or crushed red pepper.  I used the same measure of dried onions and simply omitted the crushed red pepper.  I thought it was excellent, but those two ingredients are going on my shopping list for next time.  I can't wait to make tacos for my husband again without telling him I've discovered this mix and see what his reaction is.  Thanks! :-D

It blows me away that it never occurred to me to make my own taco seasoning.  This recipe is absolutely perfect and tastes exactly like packaged taco seasoning, but without the added sodium and preservatives.

After realizing that the commercial packet mixes contain MSG, I went searching for a homemade "mix" and am so happy I tried this one.  Very good!  I took some other suggestions and only used 1 t of the cumin and substituted 1/8 t of cayenne for the red pepper flakes.  Pretty spicy!  I felt it was a bit salty, though, so next time I will omit that altogether.

SO much better than the packaged stuff, and so easy!  I used 2 1/2 tbsp of seasoning and about 1/2 cup of water per pound of ground beef, stirring the seasoning into the water before adding to the meat.  The "heat" was perfect.  Since I only had hot paprika, I cut that ingredient in half.

very mexican...i used it to make the Salsa chicken from this site. It was very good. I didn't have any red pepper flakes but that didn't matter. And I used 1 and 1/2 tsp garlic pepper instead of Garlic and pepper seperately. Fantastic. I'll never buy packaged taco seasoning again.

This is awesome nice to be able to mix something up with what are always in your spice rack/ pantry. there is an Italian dry spice mix on this site called italin butter that is the same idea, mix up spices that are usually on hand, and they are ready when you need them.Thanks for recipe and goodbye to store bought packs

Very good and saving me tons of money by not having to buy the individual packs of taco sauce. (You can't easily find the packets over here in Scotland anyway.)

better than a taco seasoning packet...we loved the flavor, and it wasn't too salty like the seasoning packets! Thank you for sharing this...I'll never buy the packets again...it's too easy to make it "homemade".

This seasoning is great!  I added it to some black beans and diced tomatoes for our vegetarian tacos.  Very flavorful.  I omitted the pepper flakes because I didn't have any around, but the mixture was definitely still spicy.  The next day I mixed the left over beans with some rice and a pinch more of the seasoning.  Also tasty!  I will use this taco seasoning recipe over and over again.

Incredible!  I don't like the packets at the store, but the Terrific Turkey Chili recipe on this site called for taco seasoning.  This recipe was right on, so I'll definitely use it next time I make tacos.

I LOVE THIS! I have alot of food allergies and cannot eat packaged mix any more. I substituted freeze dried chives for garlic since I am allergic to garlic. Also put 2 tsp of arrowroot starch in the mix- also allergic to corn.

This taco seasoning was perfect! The only change I made was to omit the red pepper, but neither my husband nor I missed it. I doubled the recipe and it was just the right amount for 2 lbs. of meat. Thanks, Bill!

Very tasty and with a bit of a kick too! I added the mix to about 1/2 cup of water and then poured it over a pound of browned ground beef and simmered until most of the water had evaporated. Yum!

No more packets for me either!  Luckily I ran out one day and was forced to try to find a seasoning recipe--boy am I glad I did.  This was good, but I am not done searching for the *best* mix.

Great alternative to pre-packeged taco seasoning!  I am always looking for fresher alternatives for my family and this has to be better for you than  maltodextin (the first ingredient in the old seasoning packet I used to buy).  Next time I will probably reduce the red pepper flakes for my family's taste.

Good recipe; Modified it, seemed a tad bland in the beginning. Added more garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, even some cayenne as well.

Really good taste-much better than even the best taco mix package that I have had. Made it exactly as it was stated on the recipe and used about 5 tbsp on 2 pounds of hamburger.

Why would you ever bother buying packets, ever??!! This is waaaay better! I'm sure this is much healthier than the processed salty packets,too. I keep a container mixed up to add to all sorts of other recipes in place of the packets. Zippy, but not over too hot spicy. We like 2 1/2 T. per 1 lb beef, but I think my husband would like a little more of the seasoning.

This really didn't impress me all that much...tasted very bland even though I used very good quality spices.  Got the same reaction from my husband and daughter.  Sorry, won't make this again.

I loved this seasoning.  It was so easy and I had everything on hand.  I did leave out the oregano though.

Put this one in your recipe box... perfect mix of seasoning for a pound of ground beef. Mix up a large jar and use 2 1/2 Tbsp instead of the taco seasoning package from the store.

Thank goodness for this recipe!  My kids always complain that tacos made with the pre-made packets are too spicy (wimps!)  I made this without the red pepper flakes, and they didn't complain!  There is a first for everything!

Pretty tasty. I didn't have sea salt so I used regular, and it didn't turn out salty enough. Adding garlic salt did the trick. I browned ground beef and simmered it with this mixture and water. I like the fact that I know exactly what's in it!

This was great! I didn't have everything it called for (onion powder or chili powder) but it still turned out great! Made a small batch first time around but will definately be keeping a jar of this in my spice cabinet instead of those icky-not-so-good-for-you packets!

I must have screwed up on this one. It came out too salty. Still edible, but salty. With so many 5 star rating I figure I must have done something wrong. But, I made a huge batch of this stuff. So I am wondering if the conversion came out wrong.

I was so excited to try this.  I have removed prepackaged food from our diet except for taco seasoning.  This was so good.  Mix up a big batch so you have it on hand and it is just as quick as opening a package.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect- if you don't like it quite so hot, however, just omit the red pepper flakes.  The salt can be cut in half and you won't miss it.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  This is the recipe I got from my step-mother almost 30 years ago, and it has been a favorite all those years.  My copy of the recipe was lost a couple of years ago when we remodeled the kitchen, and I have been looking for one like it ever since, without luck - until today.  You can believe it has been saved to my recipe box!  Thanks again.

This is great taco seasoning!  It is so nice to know that there is no MSG.  Also, you can make it with Morton's lite salt for half the sodium!

We loved it!!!
It is a little spicy for the kids.
So we will probably take out the red pepper next time. I did add sugar and corn starch as another user suggested.
We will not be buying the packets anymore either. :)

switched pepper flakes for 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  The whole mixture is just the right amount for one pound of ground beef

This was good, but a packet of taco seasoning is so much easier and I did not really taste the difference.

I made tacos last night for dinner and they turned out wonderfully. It was a little on the spicy side so next time I'll use less of the chilli podwer. Also, I didn't have paprika so I used a little bit of nutmeg. Oh and instead of using the garlic and onion power after we had browned the meat us sauteed onions and fresh garlic into the meat. IT was very yummy

One night I wanted to make tacos but I was out of taco seasoning so I looked this up on my computer and had everything already in my cubboard to whip this up.  My family thought the tacos were great.  I will make this seasoning from now on instead of buying the little packets.

This was a pretty good seasoning mix.  Next time I will use less of the red pepper, though.  But, definitely not a bad substitute for one of taco seasoning packages.

I looked for a taco seasoning mix so that I can control the salt in it. I left the salt out, used less red pepper flakes and used it for a taco soup. Much better than the packets. I will definitely use this again.

Excellent-I forgot to get seasoning at the store...so I came down and looked and found this recipe.  The great thing was that I had ALL of the ingredients in my cupboard.  I am off to make a lot to store so we have it for next time.

This was easy and pretty good. I may tweak it a bit next time to my taste. I used less cumin than what the recipe called for and it still seemed overpowering.

I make a lot this mixture and keep it in a plastic container in the pantry because I use it so much. I sprinkle it on chicken, corn, eggs and of coarse tacos.

Take out the salt and you have a flavorful salt-free seasoning. I used this to make a chicken meatloaf that called for packaged taco seasoning (gross), and it came out great. I look forward to using this blend of spices in all of my Mexican dishes.

I don't have onion powder, so I just used extra garlic, and used this recipe on chicken and I love it.  I'm never buying those cheap seasoning packets again.  I didn't tell my husband that I made the seasoning from scratch, and he commented on how good the chicken was!  Who'd a thought a plain old taco seasoning could "wow" like this!

I love this recipe.  I was cook at a camp for grades 4-6 this summer and I made this recipe x10 and added it to ground chicken.  The kids and counsellors loved it and want to have it again next summer!!  I also leave out the salt when I'm making it for myself, since I'm on a weight loss program--perfect!!

This rocks... I love the fact that you can make this as spicy as you want it by adding more red pepper.

This seasoning is as good as I have every used.  Much less expensive to make than paying $.99 for an envelope of it each time I make tacos.

I can't handle anything too spice, so I left out the red pepper flakes but kept everything else the same.  It was wonderful with ground beef for basic tacos.  I love this seasoning.

Our entire family enjoyed this recipe, even the kids.  I did use half the amount of regular salt to cut down on it for health reasons and used water as previous reviewers suggested.  I will be making a big batch to keep in our spice cabinet!

Wouldn't change a thing! Great for ground beef, shredded beef, chicken & seafood - we've tried it all:)Much less salty and far more flavorful than the store bought seasoning.

Much better than store bought taco mix (which I usually find too salty).  I use this amount for about 1.5 lbs of meat.  Goes well with game meat.

We wanted nachos last night, but didn't have taco seasoning to make the meat.  Found this recipe and decided to give it a shot since we actually had all the spices on hand.  WONDERFUL!  We're going to use this from now on instead of buying the premade packages in the store.

We use this once a week. I love not having the MSG that is in packages. I don't even add all the ingredients every time. As long as you have chili powder and cumin you can modify! Have fun!

I recently found out I have celiac disease and can't eat anything containing wheat, rye, barley or oats.  Feel great, but I can't use store-bought taco seasoning packets anymore because of the fillers they use.  This is a great seasoning mix.  I mix up a quadruple batch at a time and keep it in a container.  If I knew it was this easy, I would have been doing it this way for years, rather than run to the store every time I wanted to make tacos.  =)

Great recipe that is easy to alter the heat for those that like it hot or mild. Added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne & 1/2 teaspoon  granulated beef bouillon to the original recipe.  Then doubled it just to keep some on hand.

I omitted the salt and it was perfect to me but others who are not used to a little kick may want to use less chili powder.

Great - especially for those times when you plan to make tacos and then realize you don't have the spice packet.  For personal preferences I would a little more zing as I like my meat to be a little spicier then the recipe makes it.

This has way more depth of flavor than a packaged mix, but it was close enough that my family didn't notice, and really liked it.

I used less salt (table salt) and ground red pepper. Wonderful flavor.  A definate keeper that pleased my picky family. It is good on chicken, beef, or venison.  I also increased the recipe to keep the mix ready in a jar.

I thought this was bland as is. After tasting I ended up putting fresh garlic and onion and a little more of all the seasonings to give it more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delish!  I used 1/2 tsp regular salt and omitted the red pepper for the small children.  Added it to 1 lb. lean beef with 1/2 cup water.  Thanks so much!  I will never buy the store mix again.

Good recipe for taco seasoning. I made without the onion powder (due to onion allergy) and decreased the amount of chili powder by a little bit. Good flavor, more spicy then the typical packets bought in the grocery store.

This is a really great seasoning!  We lessen the cumin and leave out the red pepper flakes for the small children, but it's very flavorful, and we prefer it to the packaged seasonings.

Quick, easy, and keeps a long time. Easy to adapt (i used 1t. chili powder, and omitted the red pepper flakes) Good to mix with sour cream or plain yogurt as a dip.

I used fresh chopped garlic and onion, this is a great seasoning.  I would make a little extra for 1 pound of beef, though.

Awesome recipe!!  I accidentally bought the hot spicy taco seasoning mix.  It's too hot for my 2 year old so I needed something to replace it.  This did the trick!  I don't think I'll be buying taco seasoning mix anymore.  This is just too easy and I love that I can control the heat and the salt.  Thanks a bunch!!!

this is a perfect taco seasoning mix,
my husband loves it...not too spicy but it has a lot of flavor. also much cheaper than buying a mix at the store that is full of preservatives.

While this doesn't taste exactly like the packaged stuff, I'm not complaining! I used it to make my Taco Meatballs (not from this site) and I actually enjoyed them more with this seasoning as opposed to the packaged stuff. Beware though: If you don't enjoy spicy food, you may want to cut back on the pepper flakes and cayenne! I love spicy stuff so it's perfect for me. Thanks Bill!

Pretty good for starters. I also added 2Tbsp. flour, some cayenne pepper, white pepper, paprika, onion salt instead of onion powder,cilantro flakes, a bit more garlic than this called for and finally my special jalapeno powder. Without your recipe as a start I would have had to go to the store in a major snow storm just to buy the package of seasoning.

WOW! I normally have a package or 2 of Williams Taco Seasoning in my cupboard, but this time I didn't and pulled up this recipe. It's PERFECT! I'll NEVER buy this again, there's no need! You probably have all the ingredients in your cupboard to make it! Having a wheat allergy, I have to be very careful about packaged goods (thus the Williams), so this worked out wonderfully! Thank you for the post! I'm grateful!
