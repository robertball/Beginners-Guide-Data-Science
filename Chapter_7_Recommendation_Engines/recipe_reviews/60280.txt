This recipe was very easy to make and tasted wonderful!  If you cannot locate fresh cranberries, it is just as wonderful with frozen cranberries.  Just make sure you defrost them before you begin cooking.

Loved this!  I'm always looking for something a bit different when it comes to "cranberry sauce" and this one filled the bill.  It made enough that I was able to make a "cranberry chicken" dish with it as well.  Use your imagination or maybe I'll submit it here!!

Good, easy recipe.  I didn't have golden raisins so I used regular ones, but I think it would be better w/ golden raisins next time.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck meal at work and it is a very delicious cranberry sauce with a good texture!  Is, however, a very sweet cranberry sauce; would highly recommend!  May very well make again!

Exactly what I was looking for. Excellent with the Thanksgiving turkey. Makes for a nice "chutney" with pork and I LOVE it with ham !

I originally printed this recipe on 11/19/05, obviously for that Thanksgiving.  I haven't bought canned cranberry sauce for four years now. How can something this easy taste this good.  The only adjustment made was in the proportion of sugar as we use fructose.  It freezes beautifully too as the college student daughter can attest.

Really very good. I dont like things too sweet so I may cut the sugar to 2/3 cup next time. I will use the leftover sauce for apple crumble (see allrecipes.com).

Great Recipe! I am not a fan of craberry sauce with meat. But this sauce which tastes more like apricots, raisins and orange was absolutely perfect with my 12-hour smoked turkey!

Made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved about it.  It is not as sweet as other sauces, and the addition of dried apricots is wonderful.  Next time I will add 2 Tbsp of brandy at the end.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  The apricots and raisins were a great addition.  I upped everything by a 1/4 keeping the sugar the same.  (I didn't want it too sweet.)  It came out great.

So colorful and also so very good.  This one got raves from all at Thanksgiving, except those that didn't try because they don't like cranberries.  I followed the recipe exactly as written...absolutely no modifications needed.

I substituted clementines for the orange juice and zest, and I replaced some of the water for cooking with the apple cider I had on hand.  Sorry to say I didn't measure everything exactly. I had a 12 oz. bag of cranberries, so I may have used a little less sugar than what the recipe called for.

Always easy and outstanding.  This is our go-to for the holidays.  I also add about two teaspoons of minced crystalized ginger when the mood strikes.
Our grocery store sells pre-packaged bags of fresh cranberries that are 3 cups in size.  If yours does the same, simply reduce the serving size of this recipe to 18.  Use good quality orange juice to reduce the bitter taste.  Love this - So good!

This is my third year using this recipe for my family's Thanksgiving feast.  I've reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup for a less sweet/more tart taste, but other than that it's perfect!  I wouldn't think of showing up to my sister's house on Thanksgiving without it!

This was my first time ever cooking a Thanksgiving meal.  I selected this recipe for my cranberry sauce and am so glad I did.  My family loved it.  My children who don't even eat canned cranberry sauce ate this and loved it!  I used the exact recipe according to instructions and didn't find any need for modifications.

Excellent.  Sweet, tangy and delish!  Not a huge apricot fan so I may leave them out next time.

My sister in law makes this every year but adds walnuts and (dry) cranberry jello.  My favorite side dish.
