This is a tried and true, classic cream cheese frosting, especially good on carrot and banana cakes. I've made this so many times I haven't needed to look at the actual recipe for years! I've always used 3-1/2 to 4 c. of powdered sugar, but you can certainly use less, down to as little as 2 c., if you like a less-sweet, thicker, firmer, more cream cheesey frosting.  Add a little cocoa powder or melted chocolate, to taste, for Chocolate Cream Cheese frosting.

Great frosting!  I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar and it came out fantastic.

Good basic cream cheese frosting.  It is sweet, as other reviewers have noted, but isn't that the point?  I made it exactly as reciped and it was the right consistency and flavor.  It does make plenty for a three-tier cake.  I made a basic white cake with strawberry preserves between each layer frosted with this frosting for my husband for Father's Day.  I served fresh maserated berries on the side.  Excellent!  A definate keeper frosting recipe when you want something rich, sweet and dense.

this is a great recipe.  I did notice when looking at carrot cake recipe's they mention using 'cream cheese frosting II', however there are 2 of those!  I like this one.  I, like some other review varied the powerded sugar.  Since I wanted my frosting "stiff" I used more sugar, which was great.  For those who want to frost the entire cake, (I am a former professional cake decorator) here at some hints for ALL cakes.  Freeze the cake.  Use the frosting between layer and cover the entire care with a thin coat of frosting. (This way the crumbs are only in the coat and it acts as a seal on the cake.  Once again freeze or refrigerate, and then put on the final layer of frosting.  This way you won't pull the crumbs into the frosting and it looks fabulous.

I decorate wedding cakes and this is the most delicious (not to mention easiest) recipe I've come across.  Great on cinnamon rolls, mocha, spice, and carrot cakes!  I thought the consistency was perfect but I you feel you need to thin it add about a tablespoon of light karo.

I did not love this frosting. The taste was pretty good, but I actually would have preferred more of the cream cheese taste and less of the butter. The biggest problem I had was the frosting LITERALLY ran right off the cake as soon as it reached room temperature. This caused the top layer of cake to slide about three inches to the right. Once re-refrigerated, it was fine and hardened right up. Sorry, this one just wasn't for me.

Well...I might as well glue this stuff to my butt because that's where it's going after I eat it all.  This was a delicious frosting.  I did alter it a bit to suit my taste. I used about 4-1/2 cups of powdered sugar, added a splash of almond extract and about an 1/8 of a cup of cream of coconut.  I also added about a cup of chopped nuts for more of a tropical flavor.  I spread this on top of a Mexican Wedding Cake while it was still warm (my mema's recipe) and wow...soooo good.  Thanks JJ

This is fantastic! I have been searching for a cream cheese frosting that is not too sweet and this is it! It is the perfect proportion of cream cheese, butter, and sugar. Enjoy!

Very yummy, basic frosting.  I used half the sugar called for, and coconut rum in place of vanilla.  I spread it on carrot cake and it was perfect.

After trying this recipe, I wonder why I ever bought that nasty frosting from the store.  This is super easy and not very expensive.  If you can get the cream cheese on sale like I did, its almost cheaper to make it from scratch than to buy a tub of it.  Needless to say, I will never go back.  As far as sweetness goes, just keep tasting the frosting until you get it to the desired sweetness.  I figured it was a given, but I guess some people like to follow the recipe to the "T".  Lets live dangerously people and try changing the recipe a bit.

Easy and delicious! It helps if you soften the cream cheese before mixing. Also, sifting the powdered sugar keeps the frosting lump-free.  My time saving tip:  I keep my powdered sugar in a hard plastic container, and I just shake it really hard.  That seems to break up any lumps in the sugar, so I don't have to sift it.  :o)

I first made cream cheese frosting with another recipe i found on this website called Cream cheese frosting II as well.. I personally don't like frosting but that other recipe is so amazing i was literally eating spoonfuls of it maybe becuse it tastes more like cheesecake. This IS more like the cream cheese frosting you buy a tstores the cream cheese flavor isnt so strong as the other one. I do think this recipe is way to sweet as i was tasting it i kept adding more and more cream cheese to balance it out. I later realized i used the wrong recipe.. Moral of the story if you like sweet sweet sweet frosting use this recipe, if you like a truly cream cheese tasting frosting try Cream Cheese frosting II by Janni..

Perfect cream cheese frosting. Frosted a red velvet cake beautifully. FYI, this also freezes well. Just give it enough time to get to room temp/spreadable consistency.

O-M-G...lol this is sooo good.  It was hard for me to stay away from the frosting.  As I was waiting for my cake to cool I decided to put a little in a bowl and grabbed some grapes and pineapple chunks.  It was so good with the fruit as a dip.  I don't really know if that is what the fruit dip recipe is but this frosting is really good.  I wonder what it would taste like if I added marshmallow creme????

Thank you, JJ, for putting into words how to make cream cheese frosting. I am not a baker and every time I asked someone how to make cream cheese frosting they would say. "I don't know. I never measured." I made this today and it turned out perfectly! Thank you!

Delicious!  My cake stuck in the pan and wasn't terribly pretty once I patched it back together, but I was able to hide most of it with this amazing frosting.  I don't like cream cheese frosting to be super sweet, so I only added 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and it was perfect.  This will be my go-to frosting recipe from now on!!

I wanted to make double the amount of frosting so I just planned on doubling everything.  Upon doing so, as I started to put in the sugar, it just seemed like an awful lot of sugar to add.  Seeing as I was doubling it, that called for 8 cups of sugar.  After I put 4 cups in, I tasted it and it was just right so I did not add the final 4 cups.  If putting in the whole amount of sugar, it would have been way too sweet.  Alter that little bit and it it's a perfect recipe.  Also, I used that new "Whipped" cream cheese spread thats available instead of normal cream cheese but it tastes the same.

Good job, excellent recipe that I will keep!

I only had two cups of conf. sugar in the pantry, and decided to try this with the suggestions of others to use less sugar.  I thought the frosting tasted de'lish with less sugar, but the consistency wasn't quite as firm and air'y as I would like it to be.   I used two cups of sugar, but in the future I think I'll try three cups, although two cups really brought out the cream cheese'y flavor.  To help with the consistency, I refrigerated the cake, and I think it was very good ... I used the frosting to top a 13" X 9" cinnnamon swirl cake.  I thought that maybe the butter flavor was too potent, and might try a half butter half shortening route next time around with this frosting.  All in all my family thought it was very tastey, and I will try it again with a few alterations in the future. :)

I felt kind of dumb when I went back and re-read this recipe.  I made it the other day with only 1 cup of powdered sugar, and it was delicious!  Now after reading the reviews I see that the negative ones are pertaining to the amount of powdered sugar.  With fantastic results with just 1 cup of powdered sugar, I would encourage those who felt 4 cups was way to much to try it with alot less.  I'm sure up to 2 cups would work well.

I am not overly impressed.  I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar and it still was too sugary and not enough cream cheese.  I like cream cheese frosting to taste like cream cheese and not powdered sugar.  I am going to keep looking for a good cream cheese frosting recipe.

I just made this and it is wonderful. The more powdered sugar used, the thinner the icing and less cream cheese taste. I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar and it was the perfect consistency for my spice cake. I didn't ice the sides, only the tops. Loved it.

I love this frosting! My brother is getting baptized today, and I made cupcakes to surprise him. The frosting is very smooth and creamy, and it's the perfect blend of cream cheese, butter, sugar, and vanilla.

Delicious! Not too sweet with a distinct cream cheese flavor.  The kids and I loved it on the Pumpkin Cake III recipe from this site.  It kept for 3 days with no problems.  This is my new cream cheese frosting recipe.

Best of two icings I've made to date! Super simple, too. I added two tbsp of milk for consistancy and another teaspoon of vanilla for stronger flavor, and I thought it was fabulous! My mother-in-law said it was a bit sweet, but my hubby and I agree that it's perfect. I still may reduce sugar next time, especially if it were a carrot or fruit-based cake.

Nice creamy frosting. I did add a little whipping cream to it also (1/4 cup). It was nice and creamy and rich. I piped it out on top of cupcakes and it worked well. It makes a lot of frosting. I frosted 24 cupcakes and still had 1/2 of it left after piping it on. It keeps well so plan to use the rest within a week.

This was more of a sugar frosting than cream cheese, I put in 3 1/2 cups of sugar and it was over the top sweet with no hit of cream cheese and I used philadelphia brand full fat cream cheese. So I added another 5 ounces of cream cheese to make it taste cream cheesier!

This is a good basic cream cheese frosting.  I used a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also added ½ cup chopped pecans and frosted a banana nut cake with it.

YUM! I would give this more stars if possible! I could seriously eat this stuff by the spoonful. Not exactly health food, but SO DELICIOUS! I used 3 cups powdered sugar instead of 4. The perfect frosting for the yummy Pumpkin Cake III recipe on this site.

5++ stars (even before my addition)- I added a TBL of pumpkin puree that added a hint of flavor & pretty color which turned out great since I used this for the Pumpkin Cake III recipe on this site.

I halved the recipe, halved the vanilla (since my mom has hyper sensitive taste buds), & used 1 cup of icing sugar rather than 2 cups. I thought the sweetness was perfect then. Still sweet, with a little tang from the cream cheese. Since I reduced the sugar so much, the frosting was too soft for piping. I just slathered it over the top & sides of a 8" carrot cake. After refrigeration, the frosting firmed up quite a bit. Yummy with reduced sugar amounts! I like to taste food, not sugar.

Followed the recipe as directed but found that all of the cream cheese got stuck in the beaters. So I added about a tablespooon or two of whole milk to loosen it up. Maybe it was just my cheap blender The frosting is great though!

Great frosting! Love the flavor....and like some of the other reviews I did not add all of the sugar. I taste tested after each 1/2 cup and was satisfied with the sweetness at 2 cups. Great flavor and sooo simple. Will definitely use again.

Used this with Mother's cin. rolls, YUM! I think I used a bit more sugar and maybe a splash of milk b/c I made it a bit to thick to spread, and I tried a dash of vanilla, but I couldn't taste a difference. Next time will skip the vanilla.

I'm not exactly sure what the problem was, but the frosting seemed a bit runny.  It kinda wanted to slide of the sides of the cake a bit.  The cake was completely cooled so I know that was not the issue.  I'm wondering if I let the butter and cream cheese soften too much before I whipped them.  Who knows???  The taste was good, though.  I'm glad I was just playing around in the kitchen and this was not for company or anyone other than the kiddos. (They are not too discriminating!!)  It certainly isn't one of my prettier creations!!!!

Excellent cream cheese frosting. I added a bit more icing sugar in order to pipe the frosting for decorating, otherwise I would have strictly followed the recipe.

When I made it, it was much to runny.  That could be because I used margarine spread, though.  Also, it was just to sweet.  But overall, it wasn't bad.

The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I modified it to taste, so I can't say the recipe is "the best" as given, but it's a great starting place! I only used 2 and 1/2 cups powdered sugar (to taste), and only one teaspoon vanilla (to taste), and it's PERFECT! Nice and fluffy, slightly warm in color (I used cheap generic butter, not the nicer Cabot butter, which is lighter), which I think gives a nice touch to my carrot cake. I used this on the outside to frost it, and I used "Coconut Pecan Frosting I"
Submitted by Marsha on this site for the middle filling between the layers... I think I created a winner this time! I never used butter when I made this type of frosting before, and I think it adds a lot of flavor. This would also be good made in a double batch and then poured into a graham cracker pie shell and chilled, then served with fruit topping!

This is the BEST creme cheese frosting I have ever had.  Smooth creamy and delicious.  It is very rich so if you want low fat/calories, this is not it.  If you want great taste this is deffinately a winner. I have made it several times without changing anything and the other 22 people at my office agree that it is the best!

Perfect - just what I was searching for. Thank you JJ.  
A co-worker asked for a copy too and said that when she uses it with a devils food cake she mixes one tablespoon of Nestle's Quik into the frosting for a wonderful variation. 
Thanks again.

Delicious! I was never fond of cream cheese frosting until I tried this. Absolutely perfect. I used it on a strawberries and cream cake that one person thought came from a gourmet bakery, and everyone said was the best cake they have ever had. Thank you so much for sharing. This was a super easy ending to a fabulous recipe!

I made this frosting to go with an Irish pound cake. I added a tablespoon "or so" of Irish whiskey to the recipe,  it was amazing.  I loved the consistency and the flavor was spot on.  In fact,  my fiancée,  who dislikes cream cheese frosting,  loved it. He was disappointed that I only saved him the beaters. I did double sift the sugar to avoid lumps.

I just used this recipe for the first time. I had a recipe that called for a can of cream cheese icing, which I didn,t have. So I thought I would add lib ;) I cut the recipe back a little. Used 3 cups of powder sugar and it was just right! Creamy, and very easy to spread over cake or brownies. I think 4 c of powder sugar would be too much! Of course everyone has different taste buds!

Super easy and really tasty! I just didn't use as much sugar as it it called for. Only 2 1/2 cups maybe 3 at that. Really easy though, and my daughter enjoyed helping make it. Family favorite around here from now on!

I veganized this recipe by using Earth Balance vegan butter and tofutti cream cheese. Mine came out runny, more like an icing than a fluffy frosting that I was expecting. After a little while, it did hardened up. It was also a little too sweet for me. I want something more fluffy.

I took the advice of a few reviews and tweaked the ratios a bit. First of all I backed off on the vanilla by half, because I wanted more cream cheese taste. Vanilla also tends to moisten the frosting a bit too much. I also backed off on the butter (used 7 instead of 8 tablespoons) again because of the taste and extra moisture. Then I added the powdered sugar a quarter cup at a time until I got the consistency I wanted. For me I only needed 3 cups of powdered sugar to get a creamy, pale yellow frosting which was just about toothpaste consistency. After icing my pumpkin cookies, I let them "dry" for about 1/2 hour out on the counter before covering with plastic wrap. The icing didn't harden completely, but it didn't stick to the plastic wrap either.

Excellent.  I used about 3.5 cups of confectioners sugar, but four probably would have been fine. You definitely need more than two cups (as some others have used) to get it to a true frosting-like consistency.  I think any less than 3.5 would have created a cheesy glaze, vs. cream cheese icing.  I put this on homemade carrot cake and it was awesome!!  Very easy to dye and decorate with, as well.

I'm giving this 5 *'s for taste, it IS really yummy. I had a problem with the consistency but I think it's a machine malfunction...it's definitely time for a new mixer. I was only able to add 2 cups of confectioners' sugar because it was so thick it climbed all the way up my beaters. I had to use milk to thin it so the frosting would stay in the bowl lol! Other than that, mmm mmm good!

Cut back to 1 block cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups confectioner's sugar to start. Added more sugar to get desired consistency for spreading onto a cake that was going to be decorated (needed to be somewhat firm; no melting). I love cream cheese frosting and despite the reduction in cream cheese, the flavor still really came through. Very good!

This is a great recipe! I added the full 4 cups of sugar and it turned out great. I also added about 3Tbsp of blueberry jam for flavor, so so yummy!

I accidentally left out a cup of sugar out of my cupcakes.  This recipe saved my cupcakes!  I notice tho whenever I make cream cheese icing it gets runny so I keep the cream cheese in the fridge until ready to make.

just made this tonight and topped the most moist carrot cake I've ever tasted (also from this site), and the whole family agreed! The one change I made was I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar and it was fantastic! Will definetly make this again.

I forgot to buy frosting for my daughters birthday cake, but I had cream cheese on hand.  This recipe saved the day!  It was yummy and everyone enjoyed it.  If using it for a cake, I recommend icing the cake and then refridgerating it until served.  I made the frosting the night before, frosted my cake the next morning and decorated with sliced strawberries.  It was delicious, but difficult to frost since it was so stiff from the fridge, but it had softened from being left out during the party.   Our refridgerated leftovers (a small sliver of cake) tasted even better than the cake we served at the party!

Fantastic, rich recipe. If you use pure vanilla, 2 t is pretty strong, but it pairs perfectly with pumpkin/banana cakes.

I took the advice of other reviews and only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar. It was delicious. I frosted a two layer cake and had icing left over so I used some food coloring and decorated the cake with my pastry cake decorator. It was very delicious and several people complimented the icing.  I won't buy container cream cheese frosting  again.

Excellent!!!  Needed a double batch for two cakes...and didn't have quite 8 cups of confection sugar (closer to 6)...came out smooth, creamy, and not too sweet!!  Pairing this with a carrot cake and a pumpkin spice cake for fall birthdays!! Yumm!! Thanks

This was great. I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to this and used it to top the pumpkin ginger cupcakes from this site. It made the perfect amount for 24 cupcakes. Definitely will make again. Super easy.

I thought this was good, but not my favorite cream cheese frosting.  I didn't want to eat gobs and gobs of plain frosting like I do with a really great recipe! :)  The consistency was smooth, but the frosting was thinner than I expected it to be and didn't 'set up' at all.

Very good basic cream cheese frosting. I only added about 3 1/4 cups sugar and it was still a little too sweet...but this is all a matter of taste. I put it on a carrot cake and it was delicious!

Great base recipe to vamp off of. In addition to the vanilla, I added a little orange extract, plus about a tsp. of cinnamon to put on spice cake. Just right with some extra appeal.

This was really good!  The recommended amount of confectioners sugar was too sweet for my taste.  I made 2 batches of this frosting and reduced the sugar in half for the next batch.  It was so much better!  I also used tofu imitation cream cheese for one of my batches because a few people in my family are lactose intolerant and the frosting still came out delicious.

This is a great, basic cream cheese frosting. It will complement many varieties of cake including carrot and rhubarb. I used it on Steve and Jesse's Strawberry Cake from this website. Just be sure your ingredients are at room temperature - this makes mixing much easier and you will have a creamier frosting.

OMG!! This was so yummy! I was making a yellow cake and realized I didn't have any frosting in my pantry. I've never made frosting from scratch, but I had everything I needed so I figured I'd try it out. I will never buy store bought frosting again! Oh yeah, I made it with just 2 cups sugar and after tasting it was afraid to mess it up by adding anything else. This was by far the best tasting frosting I've ever had!

Everyone loved it, but when putting it on the cake it just seemed a little soft so it was sliding down the cake. Had to put it in the fridge right away. Probably just add a little more sugar, next time.

Great! We added coca to make a chocolate icing, but simple and fast and tastes great!  My 8 year old made it.

This is the first cream cheese frosting I've ever made and it's a keeper!  It was so simple to make.  And it tastes great!  I decided to add some rum to it-yum!

I have to say this is THE cream cheese frosting recipe. I have NEVER made one with such a great consistancy. One of the easiest, and tastiest frostings I've made! I used it on top of homemade cinnamon rolls.. just pure bliss!

Holy Moly...what a lovely frosting this is. I have used this frosting for multiple desserts including "Best Carrot Cake Ever". It blows me away how well this frosting compliments many cakes/desserts. This frosting can make even the yuckiest of cakes taste delicious. It's quite simple to make; I just use my creamer (not a beater) and mash cream cheese and butter together by hand. When I add the vanilla & sugar, that's when I use my beater. This frosting is "to die for!" It's melt-in-my-mouth-give-up-a-date-with-denzel-wonderful!

I thought that this tasted fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I wish it was a little thicker though.  It was a good dip for graham crackers!

I'd have given this a 4.5 star if I could have.  It tastes delicious, but it was INCREDIBLY thick.  It would have worked much better if I had a kitchenaid instead of a hand mixer.  I had to add a bit of milk to make it just a touch thinner.  Even with the milk it was really thick and very good.

Very good and very easy.  I used 2 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar instead of the 4 cups.  I think any amount between the two measurements would be good.

Perfect.  Sweet and creamy but not overpowering.  The perfect complement to my carrot cake (ok, plus morning toast, afternoon cookies, evening fruit, wait, is there still some carrot cake leftover ?).

I love this recipe.  I only had 2.5 cups of powdered sugar and it came out really well, so that is how I always do it.  I have always used margarine and I have never had an issue with the frosting "loosening up" or melting.  One thing I love about this frosting is how easy it is to customize.  You can do cinnamon sugar, which is great for cinnamon bun frosting, or you can add lemon or orange for difference types of cakes. It is a very good basic recipe that is completely easy to customize.  My mom used to make something very similar, but she would add just a bit of milk and use it as a drizzle on bundt cakes.  Great recipe, thanks!

I added a tiny bit more vanilla but other than that I did it just as it said. Sooo easy and quick. Turned out great. I’m using it to made red velvet bites for my guys at work and home. They love them.

I halved the recipe due to the fact that I was making this for my brothers birthday. He is not a cake or cupcake person so I made brownies in my small muffin pan and iced the “bites” with this delicious rich icing. I topped each small bite with a small amount of icing because it is SO rich. This is so simple and so classic - you can’t go wrong!

this serves as a good base.  I do like butter in my cream cheese frosting but also like the tang of the cream cheese to come out.  I'd probably cut the sugar to 3 cups next time but it is a very good consistency for spreading as written.

I made this recently. Thankfully, I tasted it after 1 cup of sugar and didn't add any more. I think it would have been sickeningly sweet with the amount called for. I had no problem with the consistency.

Basic and yummy. Reduced the sugar by half to have a stronger cream cheesy taste. I think adding or reducing the sugar based on the audience and the accompanying cake or cupcake is fine.

I made it and it turned out good. The second time I made it I only put 2 cups of confectioners sugar in it instead of 4 and that made it sweet but not to sweet.

This was the worst cream cheese frosting recipe.
It was so sweet I had to add another package of cream cheese and more butter. 
If you want to try it, add a cup of sugar at a time.

This was WAY too sweet.  I have to scrape off the frosting from my cake to eat it.  Even my son, who is three and loves sugar, can't eat it!

SO GOOD! And EASY! Everyone loved it. This will definitely go in my standard collection. I frosted vanilla cake icecream-cone-cakes. 2nd time: Added 1/4 cup unsweetened (natural not dutched) cocoa powder (and splashed in a little extra vanilla extract to loosen up the texture  some) to make a chocolate flavor to frost a chocolate chip zucchini cake (an adaption of Mom's zucchini bread) for my husband's and my anniversary.  YUMMY! It does get a slight crust if/when it sits out... but it doesn't last longer than a day or 2 in my house, and doesn't bother us in the slightest.

I did make a couple adjustments, I am always looking for ways to lighten things up with the sugar. So I only put half the powdered sugar, plus 2 cups of the cup for cup Splenda. I also used 1 tsp. of vanilla only, so I could make it lemon flavored for a lemon cake I juiced 1/2 a lemon and used a 1/3 of the zest. The frosting turned out amazing! (I wouldn't use the lemon juice from the bottle, use a fresh lemon)

Definitely does not work on a layer cake.  Way too runny. Maybe used 1/2 of the cream cheese much more sugar. Flavor is very good, but only works on a sheet cake in a pan.

Worked great for us.  Adjust sugar for taste and consistency desired.  Very easy.  Makes A LOT.  I iced 24 cupcakes (not piped, but generously swirled) and I could probably do 24 more.

I did not love this frosting.I had to add another 8oz. of cream cheese for it to taste like cream cheese frosting. Other wise it tasted like powdered sugar frosting.Next time I would start with 3 cups powdered sugar and go from there. Very sweet with 4 cups.

I agree, easy to make and I also used less powder sugar. I also used strawberry cream cheese spread and whipped  regular cream cheese with the butter. It gave a pretty pink color and a hint of strawberry  taste which was great on the devil food chocolate cupcakes. Just a dollop on top was plenty since I'm not a huge fan of a alot of icing. I will also make this again.

I like this frosting a lot and followed the exact recipe as stated above and would give that 4 out of 5 stars.  In my humble opinion it is too sweet but still good. The next time I made it I doubled the cream cheese and left everything else as it was and it came out with more of a cream cheese flavor and not as sweet. I would give the last batch a 5 out of 5.

This was a runny, gooey mess. I almost always pipe my frosting because it looks neater and more professional and this recipe was so runny it ruined the look of my cake. The taste was just ok. Too sweet. And, I followed to a T. This one is being removed from my recipes!

I made this frosting for my homemade brownies and it was a hit with everyone. I personally don't like frosting normally, but this one was still very good. I did use slightly less sugar, a personal preference, but it didn't affect the texture at all.
People who had issues with it being too thin may have been using fake butter (e.g. Imperial) which is more vegetable oil and much softer at room temperature. Be sure to use real butter (which is cream based) when you make this and you should get a perfect consistency.

I tried this with out change to the ingredients, and it was PAINFULLY sweet!It was a good sturdy frosting though, but I had to scrap it because it was WAY to sweet! So, I cut back to 2 cups of powdered sugar and added 4 Tbsp of heavy whipping cream (next time I will only do 2 Tbsp), and WOW what a differnce this makes!!!! Still sweet but it wont take you breath away. I made a lemon cake and used this recipe for the frosting.

This frosting was SO good! It had the perfect balance of sweetness and cream cheese flavor. I used about 3 cups of powdered sugar, and it ended up on the border between an icing and a frosting, perfect for frosting my pumpkin cookies. Will make this again, thanks for the great frosting!

Awesome. Like another reviewer said, this is a real cream cheese frosting. If you don't like it at first, guaranteed your taste buds will be satisfied by adding more sugar.

I used appr. 3 cups of sugar and I also added appr. 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Anything sweet should have a tiny bit of salt added - it doesn't make it salty, but brings out the sweetness. I heated the frosting up to make a glaze for my coconut pound bundt cake. Delicious! Not too sweet and not too cheesy/tangy.

Oh my God, that is SO good.  This is a definite keeper.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a splash of milk.  Perfect icing.  Yum, yum..

Delicious!  I only used 3 cups of sugar as this was the finishing touch on my mini-cheesecakes, which is pretty sweet already.  Came out amazing and texture was perfect.

One of the better authentic cream cheese frostings - easy to make.  I added a tsp merainge powder to the frosting and chilled the frosting before putting it on the cake.  It was just a bit too creamy for my taste.  Also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to take some of the tang away.

This was one of the easiest frosting recipes I have ever made, and yet had the most flavor! I followed the recipe to a "T" except I didn't have vanilla so I used one vanilla bean in its place and it turned out amazing! I saved the extra and froze it.... by the way this frosting freezes amazingly!

I made this exactly as the directions say. I used it to frost red velvet cupcakes. Once everything was blended, I let it sit in the fridge for about 10 min, then piped it onto the cupcakes. With a little red spray icing & some sugar sprinkles, they looked so pretty! I got rave reviews & several people asked for the frosting recipe.

This was super delicious and easy!  I only added 3 cups of icing sugar and I thought that was sweet enough for me!  I used this on a 2 layer 9" round cake and I loaded on the frosting and there was A LOT left over, so you could even cut down the proportions if you like less frosting on your cakes.

This is an excellent recipe!!!!! I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar because I prefer that taste.  I think that it is all up to how much sweetness you want in the frosting, but this is truly a keeper!!!!  I just made this and am going to use it to frost a sour cream coffee cake.  Thank you!! :D

Very good frosting. I made cupcakes and a personal small cake for my daughters 1st birthday. I made everything from scratch and choosing this recipe for the frosting was a great choice. Had a lot of compliments on the flavor and taste.

I like this recipe as a base, but I did add some changes. I did 1 1/2 blocks of 8oz cream cheese, and 2.5 cups powdered sugar. Gave it a cream cheese kick without being to sweet. I had to put in fridge to harden up. But great start!
Thank you

This frosting was really yummy! I only used 3 cups of the sugar as per the other reviews, I thought it was still too sweet, I would probably make it with only 2 cups next time. This recipe is simple, and extremely tasty!!! Definitely a keeper.

This was a very good frosting but it was very sweet like the other reviews mentioned (I used 3 cups of sugar) - ALSO, I beat it by hand and it came out very running, however after a night in my refrig. it thickened and was even better on the 2nd day (I put it on a zucchini cake).

A tasty, easy frosting. I whipped this up in about 5 minutes and used it for my  boyfriends birthday cake. I used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4 because he doesn't like foods that are TOO sweet, but *I* would have been happy with 4 cups, personally. ;)

ok, I have to first say that I am NOT a great cook.  The whole kitchen thing intimidates me.  So when I had to fix a cake for my family reunion, I went straight to Allrecipes.com for some help.  I made a simple sheet cake and poured fresh juiced strawberries all over the top.  Then I whipped together this icing and finished off the top of the cake.  SUPERB!!!!!!!   Super easy and lightening fast!  And very delicious.

MMM, MMM,  GOOD ! A great, basic cream cheese frosting. I "tweak" it sometimes by adding different extract flavors depending on what I'm baking (i.e Rum flavor for banana bars, Almond or Lemon flavor on giant sugar cookies ) The leftover frosting is not around long....eaten by the occasional spoonful or spread between graham crackers, YUMMY !

This beats the pants off canned cream cheese frosting!  Easy to make and just what I was looking for frosting a spice cake.  I only needed about half of the amount it makes to frost the top of a 13x9-inch cake.  Hmmmm, guess I'll need to bake something else to use up the remaining frosting :)

piped this frosting and had to add more powdered sugar (2 cups) and then made chocolate batch using 1/2 cup good cocoa powder.   Great recipe and very good taste!

This has become my staple frosting for all cakes and frostings. The only thing I do differently is reduce the vanilla to 1 or 1 1/2 teaspoons. I think with the full two teaspoons there is a little bit of a lingering bitterness. Other than that, this recipe is everything I could want. The texture and flavor are perfect.

THIS IS THE BEST FROSTING EVER!!! Especially on chocolate cupcakes. But we only put in 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and no vanilla extract (because we forgot).

Excellent frosting for my banana cake.  Not too sweet, just the right cream cheese flavor, super creamy and perfect for spreading on the cake.  Didn't change a thing - perfect.

I did change this to try to make it a bit healthier but still delicious.  Thank you, JJ, for the base recipe to work from.  I used 1/4 c butter, neufchatel cream cheese, and 3 c conf. sugar.  Oh, so very nice and took seconds to whip up in the mixer.  It covered a half sheet cake well.

Probably would be five stars, but I halved it, and I also don't have proper baking epuipment, so I had to slightly warm up the cream cheese and butter to be able to beat it by hand well enough.  Still pretty great.  I think next time I would cut down on the sugar by between half a cup and a fourt of a cup.  It was a little too sugary.

This was fantastic with the Pumpkin Cake III from this site.  I made the following modifications, however.  1/4 C. butter instead of 1/2 C.; 2 C. confectioners' sugar instead of 4 C; 1 tsp. vanilla; and added 2 T. milk to make easier for spreading on cake.  MaKe sure cake is fully cooled before spreading.  Really great.

Easy to make and great flavor. I had to a little bit more powdered sugar (about a cup) to make it stiffer so that I could pipe it on to a cake. (Another reviewer asked if you could add food coloring...I added a few drops and it was fine, did not chnage the flavor or texture at all.)

Yum!  I used this to frost sugar cookies.  Yum, yum, yum!  The cream cheese cuts down on the sweetness of the frosting.  I used light cream cheese.  I think I needed to add a little more powdered sugar because the light cream cheese is softer.

I made the recipe as is and it tasted just like I wanted it to...sweet and creamy cream cheese frosting that didn't taste too "cheesy." I was a little disappointed that the frosting seemed to peel off the top of the cake when I cut it. It think it was because of the density of the frosting? Not sure how to fix that but the taste of the frosting was divine!

I poured the powdered sugar in cup by cup because I wasn't sure I wanted to use an entire four cups just for frosting.  I ended up putting in all four cups--it tastes great and turned out perfectly!  Used it to frost a spice cake and loved the results.

Good tasting but you definately need less sugar! I only put 1 cup and about 1/2 strawberry preserves and it was way too sweet for me already! I can't even imagine how sweet it would be with 4 cups of sugar!

Delicious, classic cream cheese frosting!  I made it exactly by the recipe and it was the perfect consistency for filling a frosting a cake.  Also, I didn't find it to be too sweet.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good frosting.  I did cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  It was hard to use for decorating though.  It was very soft.  Maybe I needed more sugar, but then it might be too sweet.  Would use again.  :-)

Fantastic! My very first time making frosting and it turned out to be a success! The good thing about this is that you can add the sugar depending on how sweet or how cream cheesy you want it to be. Start off with 2.5 cups of sugar and keep adding sugar until you find the perfect balance according to your taste :)  I used it on top of the Chocolate Zucchini Cake III found on this website.

Turned out perfect; very easy to make. I think i needed to add more confectioners' sugar to mine though because it was slightly runny but, my cake was still a little warm (in a hurry)...anyways, still delicious!

So quick and yummy!  I only used 3 cups of the sugar so that I would have the rest for sugar cookie icing that I am also making.  For a Christmas touch I crushed up a candy cane and mixed it in to top my cupcakes and it is SOOO yummy!  Will make again.

Fabulous! I cut back on the sugar. I have made it with two cups, which is my hubbys favorite and with 3 cups, which is my favorite. It just depends on how sweet you want it. Personally I think 4 cups is way too much.

Used 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. Tasted like cheesecake and overpowered the taste of red velvet cake.

I loved the creaminess of this frosting.  It's a great addition to Sam's Famous Carrot Cake recipe from this webiste.  I used 3 cups of powdered sugar because I didn't want it to be super thick.  YUM!

This was definitely the best cream cheese frosting I've made. I made pretty much to the exact specifications except I made strawberry cupcakes and put some strawberry gelatin mix in with the frosting and about 2 cups of the sugar. It turned out just right!

Very, very good! Would give it 5 stars with my changes.  I used 3 cups powdered sugar and 3/4 cup cocoa powder to make it a chocolate cream cheese frosting. Do not overbeat and make it at least several hours before you want to consume it or even the day before. Great taste and consistency!

This is my go-to recipe for cream cheese frosting.  I love it!  Best of all, you can adjust the sweetness just by adding more or less sugar.  I find 4 cups makes it very sweet, so I'll use that much for cupcakes or angel food cake, but use less for carrot cake or anything where I really want the cream cheese flavor to dominate.  Yum!

This is one of three different frostings I used on some banana cupcakes that I made for a luau. I only used 2 C of powdered sugar and it was PLENTY sweet, I can't imagine how four cups would have tasted. I also melted 2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and folded it in to make Chocolate cream cheese frosting! Delicious and easy! I frosted 22 cupcakes and had plenty left over.

I reduced the amoount of sugar but I am not sure whether I used 2 or 3 cups.  This is a good frosting, I used it on a chocolate cake and it was good, maybe a little too buttery for my taste, but overall it was a nice frosting.  Thank you!

I've used this recipe on the best rolled sugar cookies recipe from the sight a couple of times. A huge hit every time. The frosting will harden overnight and will last on the counter for about a week.

Best frosting I've made - everyone loves it!  I use the whipping attachment on my mixer and let it run for a few minutes to break up the little lumps in the powdered sugar.  (I used to sift the sugar, but this is quicker and easier.)

Delicious frosting!!! I followed the exact recipe with no modifications- it didn't need any. This was great on top of spice cake, and I'm sure it would be very delicious on cinnamon rolls, carrot cakes, and more. Sweet, smooth, and yummy. =)

Great frosting recipe! Per the advice of others I reduced the powdered sugar to about 2 1/2 cups, but it seems that any amount of powdered sugar between 2-4 cups would be just fine. Otherwise, everything else was to the T. I used this frosting on homemade cinnamon rolls.

I made this to top "Momma's Wine Cake" by Esther Nelson and added chopped walnuts sprinkled on top.  What a beautiful tasting and looking masterpiece.  I too thought 4 cps was way too much suger, so I started with 1 1/2 cps and continued to taste, which was 2 cps for us.  Thanks again!!!

I made this recipe using Neufchatel (low fat cream cheese) instead of regular cream cheese, and it came our deliciously. I did make a couple of modifications in order to make it slightly more healthy...I used about 1/3 less butter and half the sugar...it was plenty sweet after the first half.  Delicious though!

I read the reviews on this on and cut back on the sugar also. It was still very sweet but good! I will use this one again for sure. very easy!

This is a good recipe - put it on a Carrot Snacking Cake (from a Canadian Living recipe). I used light cream cheese, and found I needed to increase the icing sugar by about 1/4 cup to ensure a spreading consistency.

I'll give this four stars because the frosting was really easy to work with...nice and smooth.  I did as others suggested though and only used 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  Of course, I tend to be averse to super-sweet stuff.

This is one of the best cream cheese frosting recipes I've ever made.  I don't think we will ever buy the can frosting again.  I didn't add all the sugar because we wanted more of the cream cheese flavor.  A very simple  but delicous.

Perfect!! I used reduce fat cream cheese and maybe a little more than half of a 1 pound box of confex. sugar. Tasted so good, creamy yet not too sweet. Used ontop of red velvet cupcakes. Will make again!

This is devine!  I have used it on chocolate cakes, banana nut bread, and for frosting sugar cookies.  This recipe yields a generous amount, so I have 1/2 it to use for smaller needs and turns out perfectly.

Tastes great!  My 5 year old was eating it straight out of the bowl and she does not like cream cheese.  I did mess up a little though.  I forgot to set out my butter to soften and then got impatient and tried to soften it in the microwave.  I ended up melting it so it was not a fluffy as I think it should have been.  I also started out with only 2 cups powdered sugar and added until I liked the consistancy and taste (ended up with about 3 cups).  I think I could have managed with only 2 if I had not melted the butter.  I will be more patient next time.  Will definately use this recipe again.

This was ok but I was expecting a creamy cheesier taste.  I was looking for a frosting for my cinnamon rolls.  This is good but I think maybe Ill add more cream cheese next time.

I think 4 cups of sugar is too much for this recipe.  The frosting ended up tasting sugary rather then creamy like I wanted.  I think it would be really great with the sugar cut to 2 or 3 cups.  I'll probably try it again that way.

I used this on a double layered half yellow/half red velvet cake for a superbowl party and it was a huge hit!  Everybody loved the icing.  It has a great texture for piping.  I was able to make a very intricate design, which is often hard to do with most cream cheese recipes.  I just found my new favorite icing recipe!  My husband wanted to just eat the icing- guess i need to work on my cake recipe.  I didn't change a thing- 4 cups of sugar make it sweet, but not too cream cheesy.

Wow. This was easy and tastes great. My girls and I used this frosting on top of sugar cookies. I tried the recipe with 2 cups confectioners (powdered) sugar but it seemed like the butter/cream cheese flavors were too strong and a tad bit too thick. We added another cup sugar but still seemed to need a bit more but definitely would have been okay with out it. Did add the 4th cup sugar and was fine. I would definitely let this frosting set for about 10 minutes at room temperature before using if you want to spread it on cupcakes. We then put the rest in the frig then pulled it back out today and let it sit again for a few minutes before using as putting it in the frig makes it a bit hard.

I like a more cream cheese taste... so I ended up adding 16 oz of cream cheese. So, next time I will use 1/2 the butter and about 3 cups of powdered sugar.

I made it chocolate cream cheese by just adding some cocoa powder while mixing.  I used this whole recipe to frost a 9x13 of Deep Dish Brownies from this site.  At first, I wasn't sure if it would be good -- tasted a little sour, but the next day the brownies were fantastic!  I wish I still had some!

This frosting was good! Very creamy. Big hit w/family. A little on the soft side, IMO. May try refrigerating it for a bit before frosting. I did have butter and cc at room temperature and it turned out so smooth and whipped up fast. I used all the sugar, b/c I don't like the cheesecake taste and although it was good, I may add a little more next time or look for a more sugary thick cc frosting. Worked well on a 2 layer 9 inch cake. Used all the icing.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this for brownies, so it made a lot more than I needed, but it's in the fridge for when I need something sweet. Graham crackers dipped in it... yum!! I prepared this exactly as the recipe says, which is rare because I almost always alter things. The consistency was perfect with 4 cups of powdered sugar, although if you're in a pinch, you could get away with as little as 2 cups. Very, very yummy!

This was great! I used it on a spice cake and my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about how good it was. I did make a few changes. I used one 8 oz package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I used the 2 teas. of vanilla but I only used about 2 cups of powdered sugar. I was becoming very creamy after 2 cups and when I tasted it, it was perfect. I honestly couldn't imagine using 2 more cups.

Good basic cream cheese recipe. We prefer to taste the CC rather than the sugar, so I cut back to 2.5 cups. Since I was frosting a banana cake, I added 1/4t banana extract.

I made this for Pat's Award Winning Carrot Cake and it was perfect as is.  It does make more than enough.  Cutting it in half for one cake would easily do.

I thought this recipe was perfect as-is.  It made plenty to frost a 2 layer cake, it's sooo yummy, and also easy to make, easy to spread.  Well worth the extra time...better than store bought.

I've made this frosting many times. People comment on it every time, saying it's the best cream cheese frosting they have ever tasted. I don't get how people claim it's too sweet. Frosting is supposed to be sweet.

Good basic recipe, but four cups of sugar would have been way to sweet. I tasted after only two cups and it was perfect. Thanks!

Very good. I think the 4 c. of sugar would have made this a little too sweet. I used only 3 and it was perfect and made plenty for my purpose (Best Carrot Cake Ever, also from this site - I made muffins and there was PLENTY of frosting with a bit of leftover!!!!!) 
I added for extra flavor 1/8 tsp of allspice to the frosting and it gave the frosting such a nice taste to go along with the muffins. Thanks for a great recipe!

Just like Grandma's! May I recommend using stick, unsalted butter. I tried to make this recipe using the country crock spread I had on hand and the result was WAY to runny. When I tried it with stick butter, it turned out perfect.

i cut the amount of sugar in half and still found it to be sweet, otherwise it was very simple and had a great consistancy, will make again just with even less sugar.

This is the perfect simple cream cheese frosting, it was just what I was looking for to frost a spice cake!  Homemade is definitely the way to go!  I would suggest slowly adding in the powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency.  I also used a no salt added sweet cream butter and a reduced fat cream cheese, and no one knew the difference.  Hey…every little bit helps ;)

Just perfect in all ways!  I had just gottem a fresh bottle of imported vanilla and used it in this beautiful frosting.  Perfect for the Pumpkin Cranberry bread that I made yesterday.  Took one loaf to the office today -- raves reviews!!  This is a keeper for sure.

Great tasting frosting, but 4 cu. sugar is waaaaaay to much.  I used 2 cu. and that was plenty.  Make sure the cream cheese is room temp and beat that first by itself before adding the other indred's.  Easy recipe when you're in a hurry!

Wonderful. I let the butter & cream cheese sit out for awhile to soften. Then used KitchenAid to blend. Add vanilla, then powdered sugar a little at a time- to avoid lumps! I added some spices to go with the cake: nutneg, cinnamon, & cloves. (I used it with Pumpkin Spice Cake II.) Thanks!

I gave this a four because I thought it tasted too much like vanilla and not enough like cream cheese. It might be because I used pure vanilla (one that has even less alcohol content then a lot of the pure vanillas in the grocery stores) instead of using imitation. Next time I will only use 1 tsp. My mother liked it though because she hates the taste of cream cheese and would just prefer a regular vanilla frosting. It wasn't bad just a little too vanilla tasting for the carrot cake I made.

I absolutely loved this frosting, but I only gave it 3 stars because I had to modify it.  I cut the sugar in half and added an 8oz bar of fat-free cream cheese, as I like my cream cheese frosting to taste more like cream cheese than sugar.  If using fat-free cream cheese, do not try to soften it in the microwave as it is much more likely to curdle.  It is much better to let it soften at room temperature or use a high-power mixer and don't soften it at all.

I made this recipe for a carrot cake. I like the taste of the frosting, but It is a stickey goohie consistancy to a  frosting. The cream cheese mellows out the super sweetnes of the sugar. It was very easy to make and went well on the carrot cake.

More or less perfect! The butter taste was too strong, however; I use half the amt of butter. I also cut down the icing sugar to 1 c. and it's sweet enough. Very easy, quick and no-mess, and above all delicious :)

Ok, I made this once before on 11-04-03. I didn't do that good of a job because of my ingredients. This time around my ingredients were as listed on the recipe. I halved everything and this time it turned out PERFECT!!! I'm so proud of myself! I put it on a chocolate fudge cake and it was awesome. Will definately make this again, but preferably with thawed out ingredients!

From reading other reviews, I cut the sugar to 2 cups and this was excellent frosting. Perfect amount of sweetness and thickness.

I spread this over Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (also found on this site)in a 9x13-inch pan and had a lot left over. Thanks for a great tasting, quick and easy frosting JJ, this one's a keeper.

This frosting is great!  I halved the recipe and added a half cup chopped pecans.
It generously frosted a bundt cake (Grandma Bertha's Banana Cake - Allrecipes).
The cake is not too sweet and this made it really delicious.  I'll keep this frosting
recipe as I'm sure it'll work well on many different type cakes.  Thanks for sharing
JJ.

I have to say I wasn't too impressed with this.  I was looking for a recipe like one I made last summer in cooking class that was sooooo unbelievably creamy and light, it was practically weightless!  The texture of this was very good (though I only put in about 3 cups of sugar), but it had somewhat gritty powder sugar stuff in it.  It wasn't really obvious, but still.  With the other recipe, we put the powdered sugar through a sieve so maybe that would help.  What I really didn't like about this though is that there was wayyyy too much vanilla!  That's all I can taste.  Ick.  This was very simple though and not bad at all, just doesn't stand up to the other recipe.

mmmmmmm. this is the best icing i have ever had. i always said that i hated frosting, but now, i could live off this. i used this to ice a coconut cake... mm. you can add whatever extract you want, besides vanilla. oh, i used "whipped" cream cheese, versus the regular.

I used this recipe today on carrot cake - another recipe that I got from this site, and I have to say that this one is good!  My five yr old licked the beaters off and then came back in for more...I thought it could be a little thicker, so next time I think I might add a bit more powdered sugar.  I added toated pecans in it for an extra touch for the cake.  Thanks for sharing .....it got a thumbs up from this family.    = )

This is the yummiest cream cheese frosting I've found - I used it on carrot cake and my husband's coworkers devoured it!  I had to add about 1 cup of extra confectioners' sugar to thicken it up, and it was still a little runny, I'll add more next time.

This frosting is extremely good. Many cream cheese icings end up being greasy, but this one is perfect. However, it makes far more than you will need for any normal 12-serving recipe. I recommend splitting it.

This yummy frosting is very creamy and thick.  It is good right out of the
bowl before it goes on the cake!  I frosted Banana Banana Bread w/ it.  I will
keep this in my recipe box and use it often.

This is a good frosting. Not too sweet. Make sure to use very fine powdered sugar. Any clumps will ruin it! I will definitely make it again though.

I only used one teaspoon of the vanilla and it turned out fine. Although, the cream cheese flavor did not come through. The vanilla would’ve been wayy too strong if I would’ve added the second teaspoon of vanilla. I would’ve enjoyed this more if the flavors came out.

Great! I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla for mine, though, and a 1/2 cup less confectioners sugar.

I made this & it tastes deliscious!  It came out a little too thick, so I added about 3T milk to get a more spreadable consistency.

Barely tasted cream cheese. Consistency was perfect, not sure why others had trouble. 2 teaspoons vanilla was too much. I agree with others, it tasted like buttercream. Won’t try again.

Great. Very popular with my family. I prefer using pre-whipped cream cheese, I find it gives more volume to the frosting and is lighter, but traditional cream cheese is also wonderful.

Great frosting! I didn’t have the problem with it being runny at all. I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar as I like mine less sweet and it got a lot of compliments with the carrot cake  I made. Thanks!

Good and easy frosting! Change the recipe to suit your needs. I used 3c of powdered sugar and that was the right sweetness for me. Add different extracts to fit what you're putting this on. Add food coloring to make it more fun!

I made this once before, but I had lousy vanilla so there was an aftertaste that was a little offputting. (Only to me, everyone else flipped out it was so good) THIS time, I made a pumpkin cake and chose this frosting for it.....with good vanilla. The only thing I  did different was I whipped it for a couple minutes after I got all the sugar incorporated, and it is just SO silky and light, DELICIOUS! 10 for 10 would recommend to ANYBODY. I' solemnly swear I'll NEVER EVER EVER purchase cream cheese frosting again. Easy and perfect.

I have finally found a super easy and true recipe for icing!! One of the areas I’ve struggled with the most is pipe-able icing but this recipe is perfection!!! The only change I made was that I used vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract, and an Irish butter that is heavier in cream. The taste was perfect, and the texture is versatile enough to pipe or spread. Sooo happy I found this recipe! Thank you!!

It was really good and easy to make. I used 3 1/3 cups of sugar instead of 4.
I made it to frost the cake on my twins first birthday cake and they loved it! Everyone actually loved it, people were stealing bites of their cake as they ate and smashed their hands in it. It went perfectly with the raspberry filling I put inside.

Great recipe.  I was happy it stayed on my three layer cake. I chilled the cake for about an hour before I frosted it. Very tasty too.  Maybe should have made a bit more for three layers.

Absolutely Delicious!!! I added about a cup of Cool Whip to the mix and it was super fluffy and held a great peak. It was a bit  too sweet, so maybe next time I will only do 3 cups of powder sugar since the cool whip is already sweet. Great recipe. A definite keeper!

The only changes I made was 1c less on the Powdered Sugar. This is such a great recipe and very easy to make. I let my wife taste it and she was certain that I was lying about making it  ????. Be sure to use the Philadelphia Cream cheese in the box pkg. I used the cup before and it still held water which made it thin. Thanks for sharing such a recipe.

Managing expectations using prior experience with this and similar cream cheese frosting lends better results in your finished product.  This is a great recipe for those seeking a balance between sweet and cream cheese flavor. Sour cream, brown sugar, and/or increased sugar or cream cheese can tailor the flavor to the cake being frosted or the lucky people that will enjoy it.

Loved this simple recipe - it only took me about 3 minutes to make. But I only used half as much sugar as the recipe says and beat it until it got really fluffy. It turned out very creamy and not overly sweet. It was total heaven on a cinnamon roll.

Pretty god & easy frosting but if you don’t like super sweet frostings, I’d reduce the sugar by a cup or so. Next time I’ll use only 2 cups of sugar & taste & add a little more if needed.

These bars are KILLER great! As stated in the notes they are very moist which stands true to the word. The only thing I changed is making basic cream cheese frosting and added several dollops of sour cream and about a tablespoon of whole milk to make thinner so it did not rip the bars while applying.

It was very good for a basic cream cheese frosting. Next time I will cut down on the cream cheese by 1/4, but overall it was delicious! Will definitely use it again!

Delicious! I used 2 cups of sugar because I love the cream cheese taste without being super sweet.  If you prefer sweeter, definitely use all 4 cups.

I used a butter substitute (Olivo brand) and a  cream cheese substitute (coconut based, goveggie brand) and it worked out fine. The recipe calls for 4 cups of powdered sugar, only three is enough.  Otherwise it gets too thin.

Delicious!  I went EXACTLY BY THE RECIPE, and this turned out fabulously.  It was a wonderful consistency, and spread very easily on my carrot cake.  It was thick enough, so when I frosted the sides of the cake, there was no falling or running of the frosting.  I changed nothing!  Five stars.  And ten, if I could.

SO easy! I made sure the cream cheese and butter were whipped, then added the extract and whipped some more, then finally added the sugar and it was done. WONDERFUL taste and texture.
  The first time I made it, I didn't have the cream cheese and butter at room temperature, and the frosting was not as light as I wanted, but the taste was still excellent. 
  Much better than 'canned'.

I followed the advice of other the reviewers and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar as well as only using 6 Tbsp of butter instead of 8 and it turned out perfectly!    This will definitely be my go to recipe for cream cheese frosting.

Good frosting. If you want it to be sweet, put in 2 tbsp less butter and about another 1/2 cup of sugar.

I made this using the 2 8oz of cream cheese, one stick of butter, 3 cups of sifted powdered sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. 

I wanted it a little sweeter and it came out perfect! I used it for pumpkin spice cookies??

Thank you!

Good consistency and flavor.  My mom really likes cream cheese flavor, so when I bake something for her I add more cream cheese (12 ounces).

Simple to make, and tastes great!
I followed  previous reviewer instructions to start out with 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.   That was the perfect combo of  sweetness and cream cheese flavor.  I doubled the recipe for a layer cake.

I followed the recipe but couldn't get frosting at right consistency. I wound up putting more & more 10X sugar in, but it never did set up like it should.  I will NOT use this recipe again.  It wound up taking a lot more time for what the result was!

Good taste but a little to runny and way to much left over. Next time I will cut the ingredients down some and see how it works for me.

Made this, but we don’t like it too sweet.  I used 1 cup of butter, 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 4 cups of sugar, and 1/2 cup cacao powder.  It was perfect...not too sweet and great on brownies.

I did like the notes said and did 1- 8 oz cream cheese 1/4 c butter, 1 t vanilla and 2 c powdered sugar. It was ok, it just had something missing.  Of course now that I look, I may have confused the notes from a different recipe.  I’ll have to give it another try.

I made this icing for a chocolate cake.  I only changed the amount of confectioners sugar.  I used 2 1/2 cups instead of 4. It was plenty sweet.  I did not find it to be runny at all as some people mentioned and their reviews. my family loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used this recipe as a base. I added vanilla bean paste (1 teaspoon) and used about one more cup of powdered sugar to hold shape for piping. I chose to slowly mix the ingredients and add moisture in small increments and the texture was very smooth, creamy and rich with an almost cheesecake flavor. 
Everyone loved the cupcakes and all 75 were gone in minutes.

As written, 4 stars as it's too sweet and butter flavor too strong. I make this using 8 oz cream cheese, 2  1/2 cups powdered sugar, 4 TBS butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 2 - 3 TBS milk. Creamier, more cream cheese flavor,  less buttery tasting and not overpoweringly  sweet this way.

I doubled the recipe and thank god I had gotten extra cream cheese in case I needed to quadruple it for the cake I was making because without at least twice as much cream cheese as it calls for it us just gritty sugar flavor. No tang or body like cream cheese frosting should have. I ended up using 4x8 ounce blocks of cream cheese, 1 cup butter, 8 cups powdered sugar, and 4 teaspoons vanilla to get the right flavor. Finally it was smooth, creamy and tangy.

I made the recipe exactly as written in terms of ingredients, but I took it just a step further and I whipped the cream cheese and butter pretty well before adding the powdered sugar, and I also sifted the powdered sugar. In addition to these steps, I added the sugar 1/2 a cup at a time and beat on medium speed for about 30 seconds - 1 minute after each addition. I think this helped make the frosting very fluffy and helped stabilize it so it didn't get too glazey/gooey like some other reviewers said.

I made a few changes, . I added a little more  vanilla, I used 1/2 the butter and about 1/4 less sugar. It was delicious.

This is a buttery, less cheesy,  cream cheese recipe good for chocolate cake and brownies.  I made it for my grandson’s birthday cake and I Got all good reviews including  good texture, not too sweet.  It barely covered a  9-inch cake so I made another small batch of icing , one cup’s worth of confectioner’s sugar and proportional amounts of cream cheese and butter, in the morning and added it to the top and sides.  I had enough left over to frost some brownies. They were a big hit too.  I’d use it for carrot cake too but some might prefer a more cream cheese frosting.

So quick and easy.  Definitely taste as you go.  That's the best part of baking anyway, right?  Only used one and a half cups powdered sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla.  Very creamy, easy to spread.  Will be my go to for cakes, cookies, and rolls.

Really tasty. Way too much sugar though. The recipe asks for four cups of sugar, but only one and a half cups of sugar is needed.

Love this ! I used 1/2 the sugar and it just tastes amazing ! I'm guessing since it has butter and cream cheese I'll have to refrigerate it , but that's ok , think it will go fast ! Ty

Soooo good! & super easy, my 12 year old son made! Based on other reviews, we subbed 1 tsp lemon juice for 1 tsp of vanilla. We added about 3 of the 4 cups of sugar, plenty sweet for us! Made for “sams carrot cake” from this site, yummo!!

Not a bad recipe but it needed a small amount of liquid (I added 1/4 cup milk) to moisturize the ingredients to help make the texture smooth. Plus, it needed a small amount of salt (1/2 tsp.); salt enhances the other flavors. When adding the two extra ingredients, the frosting's texture and flavor was delicious.

My new go-to recipe, but I cut the powdered sugar in half so it's not too sweet and the cream cheese is more noticeable.

I should of read the reviews first instead of just going with the general star count as verification. Indeed, too much butter in my opinion. Next time I'll use way less butter & more cream cheese. I didn't use all the sugar called for either, just seemed a tad too much for my taste.

This recipe was very good, I made a red velvet cake for a friends wedding and got rave reviews on both the cake and the frosting. I did modify the recipe a bit by cut the confectioners sugar by about a half cup.  I will use this recipe again.

It's my first experience making frosting and it couldn't have been simpler.  I always wreck a recipe by adding or changing things but this time when I added a bit of cherry juice for color to the mix it turned out wonderfully.

I don't understand how in some reviews the frosting would be runny unless they didn't mix the butter as room temperature. The texture was great. The only problem I had was that I only used 3 cups of sugar and I think it was a little too sweet for me. Next time I would probably just use 2.

I made this with a minor adjustment because I didn't have enough cream cheese.

I had 4oz of cream cheese, used the half cup of butter, but used 3 cups of confectioners sugar, with the same vanilla amount.

It still came out great with a strong cream cheese flavor. I was worried it may not work, but it did.

I've used this recipe many times before with the appropriate measures and it works out beautifully every single time.

this was a great recipe but a tablespoon of water was needed and also that is way too much sugar. Overall this frosting was pretty good and sprinkles made this frosting exceptionall

I was skeptical about adding 1/2 cup butter to the icing mixture. However, I followed the directions measurements and it was a complete Disaster! The icing is very slimy and once it reaches room temperature it melts. The consistency was not what you would expect  cream cheese icing to be. The following day I made  icing again. I followed every step but skipped adding butter and it was amazing! My advice: DONT ADD BUTTER TO THIS RECIPE!!!!

This is a really delicious frosting.  But it’s not the very sweet type of frosting that comes in a can.

I Just wish I didn't use as much sugar as i prefer more of a cream cheese taste. Should've read the reviews before adding the extra 2 cups of sugar it didn't need.

Basically any time I need a frosting, I use this recipe. I put it on pumpkin bread every time I make it and have used this on so many different cupcakes and always get a rave review. I keep cream cheese blocks in stock for this recipe specifically

I used only 2 cups of sugar as the cupcake I was icing was already quite sweet.  Flavour was good,  certainly sweet enough.  My issue is that the consistency was runnier than I expected and it did not hold up to piping.   I used light butter and light cream cheese so perhaps this was the issue.  May try again with full fat ingredients and have an extra bar of cream cheese on hand if it needs thickening.

Great recipe for my first time making homemade cream cheese frosting. I followed all of the directions except that I only used about 2.5 cups of confectioner's sugar since I wanted to retain more of the cream cheese flavor and not have it so sweet.  Very easy to tweak the amount of sugar to adjust the amount of sweetness. I will use this recipe again.

The taste and consistency is perfect.  I may have made a rookie mistake and frosted a layer cake right after making the frosting.  I think I should have chilled it a bit and my layers would not have slid apart.

Really good! I had to make this at the last minute as the frosting recipe that was part of the carrot cake I was making was sliding down the sides of the cake. This saved the day. Quick, easy and a great consistency. Flavor was a nice balance between the cream  cheese and the vanilla. I will make again.

I always add a small pinch of salt.  It seems to cut the super sweet taste.  One of the best Cream Cheese Frosting that I've ever made.  Believe me, I've made a lot of frosting.

This was my first time making a cream cheese frosting. I followed the directions exactly. It was slightly sweeter than I would prefer, so next time I'll cut back just a bit on the sugar. I did like the lightweight consistency, however.

Very easy.  I actually wanted lemon frosting so I substituted 1/4 cup lemonade mix for some of the powdered sugar, and 1 t. lemon juice for 1 of the t. of vanilla.

This frosting was amazing! It runs so nicely out of piping bags and holds it's shape. Taste isn't too sweet, and it's easy to make!  MR. ROBERSTRANGE.

I only used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to cut down on the sweetness and it came out very creamy but still able to make stiff peaks with it. Very easy to make and spreads easily.  One of my go to frostings when needed in a pinch.

It was good, but 4 cups of powdered sugar is way too much. I only used 3 cups, and it was still almost too sweet.

This is an excellent basic recipe for those who like it sweet. Just half the amount of sugar if you don't like it so sweet, add half a cup of heavy cream for a richer, creamier taste.

First off, let me say that taste wise, I would give this 5 stars. If I was using this as layers between a cake or as a "cream filling" it would be perfect and I may re-use this recipe in the future for that, but this didn't frost well for me at all. I followed the instructions and didn't do any alterations. I actually chilled it for an hour before frosting cooled cupcakes, but it was kind of soupy and ran right off them. I definitely couldn't pipe it as seen in the picture.

I had to use half of the confectioners sugar and it was still a bit too sweet.  Also used only 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  If I would have used the rest of what the recipe calls for, I would have thrown it out.

I've made this a few times and LOVE it. It isn't overly sweet which I really like. I would recommend beating it on high speed at the end for about 2 minutes. It makes the icing more fluffy and light.

I made this frosting for a red velvet cake and it turned out amazing.  It is so creamy and fresh that it truly complimented the cake.  I will never buy the cream cheese frosting in the store again.  Anytime I need a cream cheese frosting, this is what I will be making.  Yummy!

This wasnt at all what i was expecting for "cream cheese" frosting. I followed the directions exactly and i was surprised that the result was more of a sugary cream cheese "glaze" but no way would i call it "frosting". It was a thin and watery texture and only tasted of the powdered sugar, hardly any cream cheese flavor. I was dissapointed.

Having read the previous reviews, I tasted the frosting after adding the sugar a cup at a time and I would say that anymore than 3 cups would be way too sweet. I went about 2.5 and it was still pretty sweet. Otherwise this is pretty tasty frosting. Frosted a lemon cake with it and it was good. Had to double the recipe to cover a 4-layer 6in round cake, inside and out.

I added heavy cream  as it was too stiff in my food processor to get out but  it was creamy and piped beautifully I added Floria de silia instead of vanilla as my flavoring and it was a hit with everyone used on Red Velvet TEXAS size cupcakes

This recipe is by far the easiest and best tasting cream cheese icing ever! And I didn't change a thing.

Put this on Sams Favorite Carrot Cake (recipe from all recipes). Happy to find a recipe with only 1 block of cream cheese as that's all I had on hand. Great texture & easy to spread. Sweet yes,but that's how this family likes it!

I've tried a lot of different frostings, but my hubby liked this one the best.  I reduced the powdered sugar to 3 cups so I could spread it more easily on a cake.

Perfect!!  Easy and delicious.  Half the recipe is perfect for a nine inch square cake.  Just be certain the cream cheese and butter are completely softened.

this was delicious.  as a previous reviewer did, i used only half the amount of sugar, and it turned out great...  i was seeking to not make it too sweet, and 2 cups worked great.

I made this yesterday to go on my devils food cake cupcakes and I have to say it was way to sweet. It was however easy to make and easy to frost. I will try it again but certainly will reduce the amount of sugar.

Good recipe, however I would start out with two cups of sugar and then keep adding halfs until you get a desired sweetness. Four cups of sugar made me feel like I was eating way too much sugar.

I used this recipe to frost my cake. I put strawberries in the center between the layers and on top. It came out delicious! I slapped the frosting on quickly and put it in the fridge for a couple of hours, and I had no problems with it running

Very simple and delicious!  I use this recipe for my pumpkin bars. I love that you can add how much sugar you want depending on how sweet you like it. Our family likes it more on the sweet side, so we do 3 cups confectioners sugar. I had just enough frosting for a 17x11 pan.

Delicious!  I had to stop myself from eating it with a spoon.  Not sure if it's different with a double tier cake, but it makes a solid bowl-full, so I'd recommend making 1/2 - 3/4 of the recipe for a normal size sheet cake.  But I'm never making another kind of icing again, it's so good.

I tried this recipe and the frosting had too much butter. You could also reduce the sugar coz I felt it was too sweet.

I used this icing recipe on a carrot cake that I took to our church Thanksgiving dinner.   The icing was awesome!  The cake was a big hit with none left to bring home :)

Everything was fine, but I didn't really like that it had a buttery taste that almost took over the rest of the great flavors in the icing. Overall, I really liked this icing!

I loved this cream cheese frosting! I used it to frost an apple cake and will keep this recipe for carrot cake, pumpkin cake, etc.  I used less confectioner's sugar, I think, because I had achieved the spreading consistency I wanted.  Perfect for generously frosting a 9x13 sheet cake.

I did cut the recipe in half since I was making pumpkin cookies and did not need the full amount of cream.  Flavor was wonderful and everyone who ate them loved them.  They did not last long.  Will use this recipe again.

I made this frosting to put on top of a gluten free pumpkin spice bar mix I had. I've never made my own frosting before. I used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 because I only had 3. It tastes just like I hoped, but it is very thin and the color of butter. Luckily I am only putting it on top of bars so I don't need something thick, but if the cake isn't flat, it will run. Definitely not pipeable.

This will be my go to cream cheese frosting recipe. As per some other reviews, I did use a bit less sugar and it turned out great. As someone else suggested, depending on the cake I make, I may try and use almond extract in lieu of the vanilla.

Well, it was a very good recipe. Much better than the B.C. canned version (yuck!).  I accidentally mixed the sugar with the butter so by the time I added the cream cheese it was a bit thick. I only had soy milk or sweet cream creamer; I opted for the creamer and it turned out pretty good. Then, I added just half the vanilla and to be honest, I rather liked it before adding the vanilla. I may leave it out next time, especially since the sweet cream added nicely to the already sweet flavor.

This is a basic cream cheese frosting recipe. I made this to top a red velvet cake for work. The frosting turned out wonderful and the flavor was excellent. I read many reviews saying that this frosting was too runny or too thin to pipe. My frosting came out nice and thick. More than thick enough to pipe. In order to help the frosting keep a nice thick consistency your butter must be soft but still just a little firm. Not mushy soft. Whip your softened butter until it's nice and fluffy. Add approximately 1/2 cup of sifted confectioners sugar and beat until it's well Incorporated. Now with the mixer still going pull out your cold cream cheese and cut it into small chunks. The cream cheese must be cold. Your chunks should be about 1 inch square.  Add one chunk at a time and beat until it's well Incorporated. Keep adding these chunks of cold cream cheese until you've added the whole 8 ounces. Now add your sifted confectioners sugar 1/2 cup at a time until you reach the sweetness you desire. Lastly add your vanilla and you should have a nice pipeable frosting. Hope this works for you.

Great frosting.   Unfortunately it has to be refridgerate and some baked goods aren't meant for the fridge.  It came together just fine.  Only had enough cups of powder sugar and still came out fine.  It had a nice balance between sweet & cream cheese flavor.

I loved this frosting for my brownies! I used about 3/4 cup less of confectionary sugar and it was perfect. If you like a more cream cheese taste, I'd add less butter and more cream cheese though :) but it's good to me!

Next time I will use less butter and more cream cheese.  It was a bit sweeter then I like but overall a good texture and taste and easy to spread.

This is perfect! Great consistency and perfect for cupcakes or cake. If you are making a triple layer cake, you will need a double batch.

This recipe calls for way too much sugar.  I added half of the sugar it called for and the frosting was just so-so, yet still overly sweet.

Great frosting! I only used two cups of sugar per another suggestion. It was perfectly creamy and thick. Big hit in our house!

I would definitely make this again! I had a lemon cake that I wanted to ice but I didn't want to use the store bought one due to all the ingredients used to make it. So I gave this recipe a try after reading the reviews. I was skeptical about using the recipe because as followed seemed like too much sugar as stated in other people reviews and I was only trying to frost a 13x9 cake. So I broke the recipe down as followed: I used half of the cream cheese and 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar I also squeezed in 1 lemon juice a cap full of lemon extract. After tasting I noticed it tasted too buttery so I added another slice of cream cheese and added lemon juice and some more sugar (to get rid of the buttery taste) to my liking. Note: even after slathering on my icing I still had some left over. When I make it the next time I think I would use even less butter but I'm very thankful I gave the recipe a try and would never buy store bought icing again!

Appreciated the base recipe. I cut the sugar in half. Added a little milk for not so thick consistency. Added cocoa powder, maybe 1/2 cup or a little less.

I used 1 cup of sugar and added a little lemon zest and it's sweet but not overpoweringly sweet. 

I couldn't imagine 4 times the sugar

I have made this multiple times and I still come back to the same conclusion- I Only use 1 cup of sifted icing sugar otherwise it is WAY too sweet and besides I like the taste of cream cheese :)- otherwise awesome simple frosting recipe thanks!

The frosting was pretty good. I would recommend using a little less butter because it was very hard to even out the taste, it was too buttery. That is probably my only complaint. Great on chocolate cake and carrot cake.

Easy and made a ton. Used this on top of the blueberry cream muffin recipe for my daughter's 2nd birthday and it was a hit-- more frosting than needed though. Now off to make something else to use up the extra! :)

No changes!  This recipe is awesome!  I don't really care for butter cream.  I love cream cheese frostings.  It spread real nice.  I put it right into the refrigerator to avoid melting before we eat it.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Tastes great.  Super easy.  I added milk until I got the consistency I need to put over monkey bread.  Versatile and delicious.

Alone it tastes like only powdered sugar, no classic cream cheese taste. But after it is applied to the cake of choice, and tested with it, it is absolutely perfect. You couldn't make a better frosting unless it was whipped!

I tasted this as written before changing it to make it more palatable.  I agree with another writer that there is too much butter.  Next time I would reduce the butter to 1/4 cup.  But, what I changed up was to add about 2 Tbsp. coconut cream (can buy it in a small can or buy the milk and don't shake it...the cream will be on top of the milk), about 1 tsp. rum and about 1/2 - 3/4 cup coconut.  That helped mask the butter flavor...frosted a 9" round banana cake and still had a few Tbsp. of frosting leftover.

I made this frosting for the carrot cake I recipe on this site. It was a great pair! It was thick enough to stay on the cake and not run but soft enough to pipe a border. It also dyed easily and the color didn't sweat off onto the cake.

The best thing about cream cheese frosting? You can use it on any dessert, and there are so many different flavors you can add in! Lemon zest, orange zest, spices! This recipe is simple and exceptional! Love it!

I have never made my own frosting.  This was very easy and very delicious.  The only thing I added to it was a little bit of lemon extract.  It made it very delicious.  I could have used 2 teaspoons but I only used 1 teaspoon.  This recipe will be used again.  I will share this with others.

I decided to make this frosting for a dark chocolate cake, instead of the vanilla frosting I usually use. It turned out great! Very creamy! Very easy to spread. I will probably use this recipe from now on for anything that requires a a yummy vanilla frosting!

Made this just as written and found it to have the perfect balance of taste and texture, not  grainy at all, not too cream-cheesey, sweet but not too sweet. This was my favorite part of the cake I made! Definitely a keeper.

Yummy....this was so good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe, but only used 6 cups powdered sugar. Also I took some out and thinned the rest with 1-2 TBS heavy whipping cream. I used the thicker frosting for my thin crumb coat, put in refrigerator to setup. Then used the thinner frosting to finish the cake.

This is super easy and really delicious. You can lower the amount of sugar a little - say, a cup, without really altering the texture, for anyone who finds it too sweet. (I don't.)

I found it to be way too sweet and will cut down to 3 cups of sugar next time.  Made it frost the banana cake that I found on this site.

I used this recipe on a coworker's going away party cake. This pairs very nicely with the strawberry cake that our "interoffice intelligence team" aka "the busy bodies" told me was her favorite. At first I was scared that it was too runny. It really does have the consistency of fruit dip, but because of that it spread very well and, surprisingly, if did not slide off the sides of the cake. I was not taking any chances though. Once I finished icing the cake I kept it refrigerated until serving and it continued to hold for the hour+ we were sitting in the conference room. 

The only super minor change I made was using a half tablespoon of vanilla extract and a half teaspoon of lemon juice. This made me feel like we were having cheesecake icing. I got lots of compliments on the icing. This is a keeper for sure!

This recipe is really easy and it's good. My two favorite things in a recipe. I used it as an icing for a gluten-free banana cake (actually it's a recipe for banana bread but it calls for a gluten-free yellow cake mix so I call it a cake). It was delicious. It was a little too sweet for my husband which is why I gave it four stars.

Wonderful, basic cream cheese frosting, just as the name implies!  You can't go wrong with this one!  Used it on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake also from this site.  I did have to add a bit of milk as I felt the frosting was a bit too thick for my liking.  The milk gave it a smoother appearance and a better spreading ability. Definitely NOT low calorie...but good!

This recipe produces a very delicious, creamy and light frosting.  I give it four stars only because I prefer my cream cheese frosting to taste more like cream cheese.  But it is very good and is perfect for someone looking for more of a subtle cream cheese flavor.  Thank you very much for this recipe.

A great recipe for almost any cake (or cupcake) recipe!!! Perfect for red velvet or spice cake! I also add chocolate syrup and lessen the sugar to top devil's food or chocolate cake. Great recipe for any baker! 
PS Presentation is A LOT BETTER if you use Ziplock bag to pipe- then again this applies to all frosting.

It's pretty good. I also added almond extract to mine. I think was a little too much cream cheese, but still good. I gave it 4 stars bc my mom's recipe is much better. Good but not amazing.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly...a little too sweet for my tastes.
So, I have changed it a little to better suit to my liking.
First, let the butter and cream cheese warm up to room temperature otherwise, it will have lumps in it.
I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar and it is still plenty sweet.
Finally, I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and mixed it in well. It really seemed to add a little kick to the frosting.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted!! I was never a fan of cream cheese frosting because it always seemed to overpower the cake(my husband LOVES red velvet cake). I even added some cocoa powder to it and made a delicious chocolate cream cheese frosting!

It's good, I made it to the T, but I think it needs some tweaking, maybe a little less icing sugar and the addition of a bit of milk to make it taste less 'icing-sugar-y'.  Maybe also a little salt to balance the sweetness.  The end result was good enough to make again.

I loved this recipe, as is, for my New Year's morning cinnamon rolls. Had to stop everyone from eating it out of the bowl while waiting for the rolls to cool. It is sweet but that's why I like it. Some food should just be that way.

Followed recipe with one change used only 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar...in my opinion perfect for a not too sweet taste. Added a teaspoon of sifted ground ginger...Yum! Went well with the Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes in lieu of the crystallized ginger called for in recipe.

I just made this recipe with a few changes. I omitted the butter, added 2T whole milk and ended up needing an additional 1c powdered sugar. It's a very good recipe and not too sweet, even with my extra powdered sugar. However, it wasn't enough to frost my 10" 3 layer cake so guess I'm off to make more frosting!

I added about an extra cup or so of powdered sugar, it's definitely not your typical sweet cream cheese frosting- its very cheesy! But still good and would be very well suited to a very sweet dessert to sort of tone down the sweetness. I put this on pumpkin cookies and it's yummy. :)

My new go to frosting recipe I use for EVERYTHING!!! It's sooooooo easy to make and tastes better than any store-bought. I do make some modifications however: I start with 2 cups confectioners sugar and add as needed, and I double the vanilla. (I recommend using an organic vanilla that is alcohol free, because it enhances the flavor and gives it just the right touch!)

This is the perfect cream cheese frosting recipe.  I have tried many and this is the best.  It is the right balance of cream cheese and sugar taste.  The consistency is smooth and would work for fillings, bars cupcakes, cakes. It is very easy to make as well Thanks for sharing.  This is my new go to recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. Love it so much I eagerly ate the frosting alone. Yum! I This was easy to make. Just  be ready to beat the sugar. It is best to slowly add the sugar. I measured it in 1/2 cups which worked nicely.

I added about 5 1/2 cups of sugar to make it stiffer.  It's hot and humid today!  Have it in the fridge so I can then frost it since it's still a little soft but the taste is fabulous and I'm not a cream cheese fan.  Will use this again and again!

EVERYONE LOVED THIS FROSTING! I do have some complaints though. I doubled it  and it was too rich for my liking but, everyone else seemed to love it. Overall I would say it's a 4 1/2 star recipe. It was just too sweet for me.

Delicious.  I put on quinoa banana bread which was good by itself, but the frosting put it over the top. I would make it again!  For those who don't things as sweet I would suggest reducing the sugar as it is extremely sweet.

I used splenda in substitute for low carb option. Works great, and can be made into any flavor really with sugar free chocolates, and flavored extracts.

This is how my mom taught me to make cream cheese frosting and we love t!!! For cakes like red velvet and apple spice cakes I like to use vanilla butter nut flavoring instead of plain vanilla. It will change the color a bit but what it does for the flavor is great!!

Good and quick icing recipe. I used1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a 1/2 or LESS of almond extract.  (BE CAREFUL AND DON'T PUT TOO MUCH ALMOND EXTRACT.) Everyone looked it!!  Will make again and again!

Good recipe, but as others have stated, 4 cups of powdered sugar was too much.  I tasted it at 2 1/2 cups and it was good, so I should've stopped there but didn't.  I had a new tub of whipped cream cheese in the fridge, so I added about half of that and it was fine.  Next time, I won't add all of that powdered sugar, but I will make it again.  I put it on red velvet cake cupcakes.....delicious!

um.. well, I made this with only 20 g cream cheese, and subsituted the taste with lemon juice and lemon peel. It was really great! but it didn't turn out so white, more like creamy white. :)

Made this tonight for the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" on this site. This frosting is fabulous !!!!!  I however did not measure the sugar I just kept adding till I got the thickness that I wanted. Great texture and flavor. Thanks for sharing.

When it comes to decorating cupcakes this frosting is very easy to work with. You can use edible spray paint and it won’t run or melt it down. Perfect texture!  I used this fabulous recipe on Red Velvet cupcakes and it was a smashing hit. Next time I’ll try adding ½ cup of high-grade cocoa for a chocolaty flavor.  Yum Yum Yummy.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for tonight - not too sweet, rich, buttery consistency and great flavor.  I think I ended up using about 3 cups of sugar - it's just right for my giant cinnamon rolls!

Same recipe I've been using for years. Add small amount of water if it's too thick. Tastes great but too soft for decorating unless it's chilled.

I usually am more taken with cake than with frosting, but I could eat this frosting all by itself. It is creamy and delicious! Although, I do use less sugar than the recipe calls for. I find that it give a bit more punch to the flavor.

Excellent as is.  Make sure to cream the butter and cream cheese together for a few min before adding anything else.  I piped it onto carrot pineapple cake I and it was the perfect consistency.  Never had to refrigerate.

I followed this recipe exactly, and tasted it, and I think next time I will cut back the amount of vanilla, but thats just me (not a fan of vanilla flavored anything). I made it to put on a red velvet cake (got the recipe from this site also) and my mom said it the frosting was perfect. I made this for her birthday (1st time I've ever made a cake or frosting from scratch) and she really liked it. Will definitely be making this again, with less vanilla.

Easy, delicious frosting.  I colored it pink and put it on brownies for Valentine's Day and it was a huge hit with my husband and kids.  I followed recipe exactly and it was just tart enough to be the perfect complement to my brownies!

Perfect!  I only used 3 1/4 cup sugar (I did not need it quite so sweet).  I thinned it just a bit with 2 tbls milk and tinted it pink (for Valentine's Day).  Piped onto white cupcakes and set in the fridge to firm up.  The kids went nuts over them!

This frosting is AMAZING! Exactly everything I hoped it would be and more. I used it to make an 8" two-layer Oreo themed cake, and it was just enough to frost the whole cake. It came together quickly, and I just added the sugar until I got the desired consistency and taste. It was somewhere between 3-4 cups. I also imagine the frosting would go really well with a cake involving berries, like strawberries or raspberries. The people who ate this cake said the frosting should go into my recipe box.

I love frosting to be sweet but this was a little too much. Next time I will use less sugar. It was also kind of gritty but that's probably because I made my own confectioners' sugar. This recipe made more than enough frosting for a 9x13 cake. Overall, very good!

I used this frosting for banana cupcakes.  Since I only made 18 cupcakes, I changed the proportions as follows: half a stick of butter, half a brick of cream cheese, 1 cup of confectioners' sugar, and a splash of vanilla. It made just enough with a little leftover (enough to eat a spoonful) :-)

I see no room for improvement- this frosting recipe is simply delicious! I did put about 3-1/4 cup of powdered sugar in instead of the full 4 cups.

This recipe tastes almost like the Cinnabon frosting. I made some minor modifications: 6 ounces butter or margarine 8 ounces cream cheese 4 cups confectioners' sugar 1 teaspoons Lemon juice 1 teaspoons Vanilla extract

This was exactly what I wanted it to be. Good texture, and the cream cheese flavor wasn't overwhelming. It definitely had a cream cheese character, but it did not overwhelm my cinnamon rolls.

This is my very first try at making a frosting of any kind and it turned out pretty good.  I used only two cups of confectioners' sugar and it does seems to be just the right amount of sweetness.  I am baking a spice cake to go along with it, so I might be back to rate it five stars if it goes together well.

This was perfect for frosting the Cream Cheese Pound Cake on this site.  Everyone LOVED it.  I don't like cream cheese frosting that has more cream cheese than sugar.  So, this one was just perfect for us!

I followed another reviewers suggestion to start with only some of sugar and add more until it tastes good to you.  I ended up at 3 cups being perfect - 4 would have been too sweet, so I'm rating the original recipe as written at 3 stars for being too far on the sweet side.  I also whipped this together with the Kitchen Aid mixer, which yielded super creamy, smooth, fluffy frosting.  It was well received.

I made this to frost carrot cake cupcakes for my father's 80th birthday and everyone raved about it!  It is an extremely easy recipe which came in useful when I ran out and needed an extra batch quickly ;)  I used 3 cups confectioners' sugar instead of 4 and was very happy with the sweetness.  Thanks so much to those that share their wonderful recipes!

Mmmm good! I've been craving banana bars lately, so I decided to make some for myself (my fruit hating fiance wouldn't eat a bite!). I found a recipe for yummy banana bars (mommyluvs2cook), but it included instructions for making a vanilla frosting. I can't imagine banana bars with anything but cream cheese frosting, so I decided to try this frosting instead. What I like about this is the simplicity of it all - butter, cream cheese powdered sugar and a little vanilla combine to create a basic, not too sweet and not too cream cheesy flavored frosting (I prefer sweet over cream cheese taste). Even better? You can use this on just about anything you heart desires. :) I will certainly use this again and again. I can't wait to try this on carrot or spice cake! Thanks for sharing, JJ! :-)

Very easy to make, I used orange extract instead of vanilla (because I was out of vanilla) and it tasted like an orange creamsicle!  My children loved it!  I used red and yellow food coloring to add an orange color to it to stay with the theme.  And I used the 4 cups of sugar to keep the sweetness.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I took the advice of others and made it with 12oz of cream cheese and 3 cups of powdered sugar. I also prefer more cream cheese flavor. It would have been too sweet for me using 4 cups.  It was also very runny. I will try another recipe next time.

I use 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c butter, 2 cups confectioners' sugar, 3-4 tsp vanilla extract. This will be enough to frost one sheet cake.

This turns out a fairly soft icing. It will pipe, but only if you chill it first. It also won't hold its shape under warm conditions--but I'm guessing no one was hoping otherwise with cream cheese icing. There is another recipe on this site for a stiffer cream cheese icing--try that if you absolutely MUST have a piping frosting, but try this if you prefer the soft, less sweet kind. Thanks for the recipe!

A really good frosting recipe!  I would have given it 5 stars, but the frosting is too runny for my tastes as is.  I added more sugar, but that made it sweeter than I wanted.  Used it to top banana oat bars and it was fabulous!

This just proves you don't need a fancy frosting recipe! This was AWESOME. I used it on a layered chocolate cake. I added a little less powdered sugar and used peppermint extract instead of vanilla

Perfect as is.  I piped it onto carrot cupcakes and it piped nicely and held up beautifully.  Even the "non" carrot cake eaters in the group ended up eating these thanks to the frosting.

It was a great recipe for the inside of my Yule Log. Made a great filling, just left out 1 cup of Powdered Sugar to make it like a Cream Cheese Filling, but I will be making this Frosting again for a cake.

Really wonderful, if you use this for Gingerbread men it looks best if you outline and make eyes with white, oh my gosh, can't believe how tastey the cookies are with this frosting.  I did add some fresh ground nutmeg, ground lightly for approx 20 seconds, yummy.

When you beat this I would definitely use an electric mixer, and not do it by hand. It mixes up way easier, and gets really fluffy and good. Put on top of the Sour Cream Banana Cake recipe from this site. Very good!

This recipe was great. I like more of a cream cheese taste, so I added more cream cheese and less confectioners' sugar. I added only 3 cups of confectioners' sugar and 12 ounces of cream cheese. I put this on top of pumpkin bars. Mmmmmmmmmmmm

This is the best recipe!!! I ran out of icing and didn't have enough sugar to make another batch, so I used a can of cream cheese icing...ugh. The store bought can didn't even compare! So lesson learned...take the time to make another from scratch, or double up on this recipe for a 2 layer cake. It also spreads twice as smooth as canned icing. One good idea I tried today that actually worked: Do you have a circular rotating spice rack? I used one of those that I already had in my cupboard to place my cake on, then rotated it as I iced the cake. It was smooth as satin!

Was soooo good! I used this on top of Apple Pumpkin Muffins in place of a streusel type topping, and that made all the difference. This does make a rather large amount, but I can always bake something else to put it on.

Best cream cheese frosting recipe ever! This is way better than store-bought, and tastes fresh unlike the latter. I used reduced-fat cream cheese and salted butter, since that's what I had on hand. I did not find the vanilla overpowering at all. I used three cups of icing sugar, but that made it a little too sweet for us. I was able to tone down the sweetness by adding a generous splash of lemon juice. The consistency is perfect. Spreading this over "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" from this site, once it's done baking.

Even with half the sugar it seems too sweet, I think it would be better with half the butter possibly.

Made this to frost Pumpkin Cake III.  It was so good!  I cut the amount of powdered sugar in half and it perfectly complimented the sweet cake, and we all decided it would be fabulous on cinnamon rolls, too.  Thanks for sharing it!

Made only 2 servings to frost my mini muffins using "Delicious Pumpkin Bread." I did add a little water to make it more spreadable.

5 with the changes I made, but if I'd made it as stated I think the sweet would've about knocked me over! (If you want SWEET though, make as stated)! :) I got nervous when I saw the calorie count, so I knocked the butter down to 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) and used 2 cups powdered sugar - everything else the same. I am about to enter a sugar coma and if I die I will leave this world happy! Holy heck, this is AWESOME frosting!! Soooo creamy and smooth and super easy to spread, the flavor (with the changes mentioned above) resulted in a very nice light cream cheese flavor with a touch of sweetness, almost separate flavors. It is PERFECT with the cinnamon apple whole wheat muffins I made that came out very bland and needed something for flavor, they are now like little apple cinnamon carrot cakes... mmm!! :) (I confess, I also licked the bowl and beaters... can't remember the last time I did that)!

This is the best cream cheese frosting recipe. I have used it for years and simply vary the amount of sugar based on what dessert I'm frosting and the preferences of the people I'm baking for.

I used this icing on a red velvet cake I made for my class and it was pretty good. The problem with it is there is much too much sugar in this recipe. I used 3 cups instead of 4, and I still had students scraping it off the cake because they said it was too sweet.  I think with only two cups of sugar it would be fantastic.

This frosting was REALLY sweet, a little too sweet, and I only used half the recommended amount of powdered sugar!! This recipe could use some tweaking because I'm sure if I left out any more powdered sugar it wouldn't be light and fluffy enough like frosting should be. Maybe some whipped egg whites?

This was really good for a cream cheese frosting which is not usually my favorite.  I used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar, not too sweet but not an over amount of cream cheese flavor which I don't always care for.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I only used about 2 cups of powdered sugar but I'm sure the full 4 would taste great too!  I used low fat cream cheese and it came out very delicious.  The frosting is thick but spreadable.  Perfect!!

Really good - this frosting was perfect on the carrot cake I made it for. It's a sweeter cream cheese frosting, but then, that's what I was wanting. It's a great texture, spreads well, and colors nicely too. And it just tastes really really good!

The best frosting I have made! Lessened the sugar to 2 cups to preserve the cream cheese taste more. Works very well with Beer Bread baked with 4 teaspoons of cinnamon. Better than any store-bought cinnamon roll!!! DH loves it, and is still begging for more!

Very good :)  I made it in my Kitchen Aid mixer and the more you beat it the fluffier and yummier it becomes.....so if you like a thicker frosting dont whip it very long...

Ours was to go on top of the Buttermilk Pound Cake rom this site  so we whipped it really really well and just dolloped a spoonful on top of the cake as if it were cool whip..YUUMMMMMM YUM! 

Perfect.

I am very picky about my frosting, but I heard this went great with Pumpkin Cake III (Submitted by Sue Case).

I tried it...and wow. I couldn't stop getting little spoonfuls of it. The only thing I will say is that I didn't need to use all the confectioners sugar.

I creamed the cream cheese and butter in the food processor, added the vanilla, then added the powdered sugar.  This recipe is easy in the food processor. I let it set in the refrigerator for an hour before using it on my cake and it turned out beautiful.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I can't imagine using four cups of sugar, though; I used two cups and that was plenty sweet, even for my kids.

Amazing!!! 
i used a teaspoon and a dash of vanilla.
i also had to substitute brown sugar for confectioners sugar.
Resulted in light mocha color.
looks delish, tastes even better.
thank you so much for posting!
i will definitely use this one again and again.  
*made fore carrot cake III (hope i have enough left for frosting after i taste and re-taste it ;)). which i just realized i forgot to add nutmeg and salt to. will update with reviews from co-workers (Christmas pot luck)

This is good and simple. I like the fact that this recipe could be made so quickly, and had 10 times the cream cheese flavor that you find in those pre-made canisters.

This was just ok. I, like others, didn't have to use the whole 4 cups of sugar cuz it came out sweet enough after 2. Not a bad recipe, but also not one I would make again. I'm definitely gunna look for a better one.

This is the best cream cheese frosting.  The only thing that I did different was use 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4 cups.  The consistency was nice and thick.  I put the frosting on a pumpkin bar recipe.  YUM!!!

This is a good basic cream cheese frosting. I read other reviews and saw that people found that it was too sweet. Instead of adding 2 tsp vanilla, I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon juice. It turned out perfectly.

I used this frosting on my mom's b-day cake. I made a red velvet cake. This frosting was great with it. There was enough to frost a 2 layer 9"inch round cake. I didnt decorate with this frosting, but it was a great consistency for it, maybe next time!

The taste is delicious.  I had made a different recipe before that called for 2 - 8 oz containers of cream cheese and it was too tart.  I made this for a pumpkin cake from this site.  I knew the cake was going to be really sweet so I cut the sugar for the frosting down to 3 cups.  I have a very big sweet tooth but I think 4 cups of sugar would have been too much.  The frosting was very sweet with the 3 cups.  I will use this recipe again.

This is a nice recipe, but, in no way does it yield enough frosting to cover the layers and sides of a two tiered cake. I had to fill the center and top only which turned out just fine. Also-I followed another reviewer's advice and added the confectioner's sugar one cup at a time. After 2 1/2 cups, I knew the frosting would be sweet enough. I can't imagine this recipe with four cups of sugar.

Yum, yum, yum.  I used this to frost my daughter's chocolate fudge cake and it was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and had about 1/4 of it left after frosting a four-layer cake.  I used about 2 1/2 cups of sugar per recipe and added a touch of milk to make it a bit more spreadable.  It's working its way to my thighs and butt as we speak!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Like other reviewers we cut the sugar down - I only used 2 1/2 cups and I can't imagine using more. The frosting was delicious and perfect for our red velvet cupcakes. It makes a LOT of frosting. Yum.

This is a great frosting for a carrot cake!  Sift the powdered sugar before using it to avoid having little lumps in the frosting.  

I made the recipe as written and then reserved 1/2 cup or so for decorating borders with a piping bag and tip.  I added about 1 Tbsp milk to the remaining frosting and mixed it to make it thinner for frosting the cake.

Soooo easy and good.  If you really like the taste of cream cheese, you could use a little less sugar.  I used a 1/2 butter 1/2 blend stick and the frosting turned out just fine.

Great!  I used this to ice apple banana cupcakes from this site.  After reading the other reviews I added the sugar a little at a time and tasted frequently as to get the amount to our liking.  Also this recipe does yeild ALOT.  I reduced it to 10 servings and I covered 24 cupcakes and still had about half left over.

I needed something to make really fast and whip it up for some cupcakes for a baby shower. This was DELICIOUS! My first time making frosting and what a hit. I'm signing up for allrecipes.com after using this recipe!

After I had the carrot cake in the oven and part of this frosting recipe already being made, I realized I didn't have anywhere near 4 cups of confec sugar on hand.  YIKES!!  But I went ahead and made it anyway with my measly 1 1/2 cups.  Surprisingly it still came out just fine.  Thin for my taste but cooling it in the fridge helped a lot.  Thanks for sharing such a simple yet tasty recipe!  This will go good on anything, if you ask me.

This recipe was quick and easy to make, I added some strawberry syrup (about 2 big squirts of the stuff)to it and it was very good on my strawberry loaf cake, that started out being a basic yellow cake until I added 2 squirts of stawberry syrup to the batter. I felt like experimenting, the frosting was great and so was my loaf cake. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

Very good recipe.  I added about 4 more ounces of cream cheese to the recipe to make it a bit creamier and a little less sweet.  Was a big hit all around!  Thanks!

I put this frosting on banana bars.  Besides tasting great, I loved the amount of frosting this recipe yielded.  I had more than plenty to spread on a 10x15 jellyroll pan.  It my new favorite cream cheese frosting recipe!

Excellent.  Made exactly as written and it was the perfect consistency for frosting, and tasted rich and creamy.  Sweet enough, too, but you could still get the tang of the cream cheese.  Put on a triple chocolate cake -- yum. Next time, I'll put raspberry between the layers to complement the cream cheese and chocolate tastes.

This is fantastic! Used on Chocolate Bananna (cup)Cakes on this site - my 9 year old daughter was content to simply lick the icing out of the bowl! Cut back just a little on the sugar - tastes so much better than storebought and was so simple - thanks!!

This is a frosting recipe that I use quite often when making a three layered cake. You need to use all of the confectioners sugar for the right spreading consistency. If you are frosting a sheet cake, left in a 9" X 13" pan, you may want to cut down the recipe some.  I highly recommend this recipe. It is very good.

Rave reviews on this one. Used it to top a from-the-box lemon cake. Only used 2 cups of sugar and would probably lighten the vanilla a bit as it was a little too strong tasting.

A+. This was wonderful. halfed it and put it on cupcakes with plenty extra!! I used a white cake, and my brothers are still coming back for more!! :] UPDATE:: changed to 4 stars. Why- having made it again an tried it for myself, I wasn't satisfied with the cream cheese taste. Next time I'll go with a greater cheese to butter ratio.

I used this to top "Carrot Cake Bars".  It was the first time I'd made, it was the first time I'd made cream cheese frosting, and I think i found a keeper!  Super quick (if you remember to lay out the butter and cream cheese to thaw) and very creamy and delicious, without tasting too sugary.  I used neufchatel cream cheese (less fat) and thought it worked very well.  The kids went nuts for this.  Almost as easy as canned frosting, but a thousand times better!  Oh, and it was super spreadable, too.

OMG this is soooo good!! Kinda sweet, but thats how it suppose to be, right?! I'm waiting for my cake to cool before I ice it... I'm afraid I'm going to eat all the icing and have none for my cake! BTW... I made this to top the Banana Cake VI from this site.

Excellent flavor and consistancy. I've used it for cookies, cinnamon rolls and the "a plus carrot cake", all with great results.

It was okay and easy to make.  Just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  My son didn't like the frosting.  I only used 2 cups of sugar like other's suggested.  Maybe I should have used more?  It tasted sweet enough, but too buttery like buttercream, which I do not like.  I'm still looking for the perfect frosting for a chocolate cake.

Very good icing.  I cut down on the butter and still was great.  Makes a lot of icing for a 2 layer cake.

Very easy to make, consistency was perfect, and tastes so good.  I would cut back on the number of cups of sugar though.  4 cups is an awful lot.  I only needed to add  1.5 cups.  But add as many cups as you want depending on how sweet you'd like it to be.  I'm definitely using this recipe again.

I wasn't sure I had 4 cups of confectioner's sugar to begin with, and after reading the reviews that it can be too sweet I decided to add the sugar a cup at a time.  A cup was all that I needed for a sweet, thick icing that still had a bit of a cheesy taste!

Pretty good, I used light cream cheese and real butter.  I used about 3 1/2 c powdered sugar, I didn't want it to be overly sweet.

Delicious frosting.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar.  I used this frosting on the "Crazy Cake" recipe.  It was a great combo.  I can see making this anytime I need a cake.

excellent! i did not end up using as much icing sugar. with all frosting recipes i usually don't measure out the frosting, instead just add it and see the consistency that i desire. taste was great.... not to sweet at all. i used it on carrot cake and cinnamon buns.

Great basic recipe that can be adjusted to whatever's being frosted!  For a red velvet cake, I used 12 oz cream cheese - 1-1/2 packages (low fat), 1/4 C softened butter, 1 t vanilla and 2-1/2 C confect.sugar.  It was nice and creamy and there was plenty for a 2 layer cake.  It does need to be kept in the fridge after frosting though to maintain consistency.  Thanks for the 'keeper' of a classic recipe!

This recipe was the consistency I was looking for.  I make the carrot cake from the Gourmet cookbook but did not like the frosting recipe because it was too thin and the layers slid all over the place.  This recipe was perfect.  I'll continue to use this and have placed it in my Gourment cookbook.  Thanks JJ!

I put this on "Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Cake" and it's great!  It's good as per the recipe but I do like to make 2 slight changes.  First I use the Neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat than cream cheese) and reduce the sugar to 3 cups.  :-)  Always good!

I made this and used it to top the frosted banana bars from this site and it's fabulous.  Much, much, much better than the store bought.  The only change I made was that I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar!

I only used half the butter called for an about 3 cups of powdered sugar.  It came out nice and creamy, with a mild cream cheese taste.

The ultimate cream cheese frosting...and the easiest.  Great on carrot cake, spice cake, and chocolate cake.  Will try on other cakes as well.  Always have a little left over, so took the advice of another reviewer and tried it on graham crackers...YUMMY!

Very good frosting.  The same recipe was listed for a carrot cake that I made from this site.  It was great.  I did add another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar though (I guess I didn't mind the sweetness, maybe beucase the cake that I used it on was that sweet itself).  TIP: Cream the softened butter and cream cheese together in a blender or food processor.  It will make your life so much easier.  And it makes the frosting so smooth.  Then, once mixed, add the vanilla and powdered sugar by hand, or by using a hand mixer.

I have been making cream cheese frosting like this for years except that I only use 1 teaspoon vanilla. I tried this recipe on a banana cake that I made and, although it is very good, I think I still like my recipe better. For those who thought this recipe was overly sweet, it may very well have been the vanilla. As my husband put it, it kind of gets you in the back of the throat. I think it may be the alcohol in the vanilla extract. Anyway, it did lessen as the frosting aged and it did complement the banana cake very well, but I'd prefer a stronger cream cheese flavor, especially if using it on a carrot cake.

Tasty - just the perfect balance of sweet & cheese flavors. Easy to make too. Used half block of fat free cream cheese & light & it came out perfect. Used on the pumpkin whoopie pies. Would make again!

I used this recipe to top the pumpkin cake that I made from this site, it was so good.  Yet, some of my friends thought that it was a tad to sweet.  Will keep this recipe but maybe cut down on the amount of powdered sugar it calls for.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Easy and delicious.  Wonderful on A-Number-1 Banana Cake also from this site.  I used 1/3rd less confectionary sugar than called for, and it was perfect for this cake.

I used this on a Pumpkin Spice Cake and it was great. I don't particularly care for the cream cheese taste of most frostings, so I liked this because it was sweeter. If you prefer a stronger cream cheese flavor than you probably won't love this, but I did! Thanks!

I loved this cream cheese frosting!  Some might say its to0 sweet, but isn't that what frosting is? I noticed some crm cheese frostings use less confc.sugar, but with those I notice the tartness of the cheese too much and the frosting seems to be too thin somehow.

This was delicious! I hadn't liked cream cheese frosting up until now and I realized that it was because nobody put enough cream cheese in it! What's the point in making it if it's not going to taste like cheese? This frosting totally met my expectations! Thanx so much!

I used this with Carrot Cake XI and it was awesome!  It makes quite a bit - I frosted my cake pretty heavily and still had leftovers.  Good on graham crackers, or just out of the container.  Make sure the butter and cream cheese are softened before mixing though!

Wonderful tasting cream cheese frosting.  I didn't change a thing!!  (unusual for me) I used it with the Carrot Cake XI from this site, and everyone just went wild over it.  My son had asked for carrot cake for a birthday cake, and I looked around at this site, and found these recipes.  GREAT stuff!!!  My son says I should open a bakery!!

This icing was a huge hit! I made a cake for a neighbor as a "thank you" gift and she came back the next day asking for the icing recipe! My husband loved it and asked if I had left overs so he could lick the bowl! I only used about 3 cups of sugar though...4 probably would have been fine, but I didn't have it and it was great without it!

Very easy to make.  It comes out perfect!  I didn't realize making homemade frosting was so easy--those of you out there who have never done this SHOULD.  Keeps very well also!  It is very sweet, but that's the way it should be.  Delicious :)

This was very good! I put it on cinnamon rolls I made from the Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rollls recipe from this site. However, I only used three cups of the powdered sugar, as that was all I had. It was still sweet and yummy. Better after I put it in the fridge for awhile and it firmed up. Delish!

I thought this frosting was just ok.  I followed the advice of other posters
and only used 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  Anything more would have definitely
been too sweet.  I would have preferred a frosting that wasn't as runny.  It seemed to
barely stick to my carrot cake.  It's an ok recipe but I'll keep searching for another.

Okay recipe. I added 2 cups of sugar because 4 would of been way too sweet.  Should of added less vanilla because that is all i tasted after frosting was done.

Just like my mother used to make - excellent on fresh apple and carrot cakes; also wonderful on Chocolate cake or fudge brownies.

Loved the frosting!!!  I had some leftover from frosting an apple cake and I left it out and my family began putting it on all the desserts!  My husband who is not a big fan of cream cheese ate it strait from the bowl!

Great frosting, I doubled the recipe but only used 7 c confectionary sugar because I was topping the cake with colored sugar.  Everyone loved it- especially how well it went with the pumpkin cake recipe (submitted by Sue Case). Thanks.

This was really scrummy frosting! I adjusted the confectioner's sugar to my family's taste, but the children were licking the bowl clean. Fanatstic on carrot cake. Can't wait to think of another "excuse" to make this frosting again... :o)
