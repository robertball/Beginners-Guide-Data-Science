I have made several different granola bar recipes from this site, and I think these are my favorite: great flavor and texture and easy to substitute whatever nuts, seeds, or dried fruit you have on hand. I used apricots, cranberries, and some salted mixed nuts that I chopped fairly coarsely. As written, I think they would be pretty thin and crunchy. I took mine out after 20 minutes instead of 30 and they are fairly soft but still stay together well. I think next time I will use a 9 x 13" inch pan instead of a cookie sheet to make them a bit thicker. Great recipe!

I liked these! Used less honey & sugar. Put in some cranberries & Chico chips. Toasting is essential!

Tasty but I burnt the edges.  I took them out way early too--pay attention to your bars! To help smooth out the ingredients into the pan, I suggest using a piece of wax/parchment paper over the top and then squishing the ingredients around underneath the paper. Way less sticky!

This recipe was absolutely delicious the texture was really good!  I wouldn't make any changes making it for myself the next time I make it!

The notes I would make are, if you want to have you oats, almonds, and coconut evenly roasted I would suggest you roast them in separate pans as the coconut ended up on the bottom and toasted a lot faster than the almonds and oats.

I loved the cinnamon, the flavor of it came out strong in the final product so keep that in mind if cinnamon is not your thing .

And finally, if you don't like the mouth feel of the whole oats or your mouth is too sensitive and finds them sharp try quick oats that have been broken up into smaller pieces.  I've used this before in making oatmeal cookies for my grandparents and found it works really well.  (note: haven't tried with this recipe yet, update when I do)

These are wonderful!  I used pecans instead of almonds, 1/3 cup sunflower seeds and craisins instead of raisins.  I will definitely make these again!

I used apple sauce to replace the oil, and also halved the recipe. I also used less sugar and honey to get it a little healthier. Turned out very well. Make sure to mix well as I have some inconsistent flavored throughout. Very tasty though

This is so good!  I don't like raisins that much so I used 1/2 cup raisins and 1/3 cup dried cranberries and about 1/3 cup sunflower seeds.  Flavor is so good I think all raisins would have been fine too.
