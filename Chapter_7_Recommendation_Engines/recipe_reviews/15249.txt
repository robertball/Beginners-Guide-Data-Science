I have some experience making fudge and I have a candy thermometer. I followed the directions exactly except for one small change. I used half & half instead of milk.

Overall, I thought this was a great recipe! A REAL recipe for fudge without all the marshmallow creme junk. A wonderful peanut butter taste! I was impressed! The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the fudge seemed a bit too moist and soft for my taste. It was still firm, but I think it could be improved.

I will try this recipe again, but I will probably wait at least 10 minutes before adding the peanut butter and vanilla. 

Highly recommended!

I will be trying

When you add the peanut butter and vanilla, stir quickly (it won't take much time to blend) and then immediately pour it into a pan--if you rest and then start stirring again the fudge will be grainy :(

My mother gave me a peanut butter fudge recipe many years ago and my children lost it last year.  So I searched all recipes and this one is the closest to hers.  Very fast and easy to make.  I like the fact there is no marshmallow creme.  Very very good taste and creamy.  My wifes bowling team all wanted the recipe.  I use a probe electronic thermometer when I make fudge and it works much better than the 3 dollar candy thermometers.  Exact temerpatures you can read everytime.  Good Luck!

This is a great fudge recipe. If you have made candy before it's really very easy. If you haven't, it might take a little adjusting. You have to stir in the vanilla and peanut butter and pour it into the pan very quickly. And make sure that you bring it all the way to the correct temperature. If you don't, it will not set properly. But don't let this scare you, it is the best tasting PB fudge ever!

I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It doesn't crystalize like sugar and would never set.  The taste was great, so if it was sugar, they would have been awesome.  Unfortunately for me, I had to toss the whole thing.

Very smooth, creamy, peanutbuttery, velvety fudge.  I was very impressed with the ease and flavor.  I went out and bought a candy themometer just for this recipie (just over a buck.)
Will definately make this in the future. There is just one problem.  How do you stop at just a few pieces.

microwave! Put brown sugar, butter and milk in a large bowl and stir. Microwave 3 min. on HI. Stir. Microwave 3 more min. on HI. Stir. Microwave 2 min. on HI. While in for the last 2 minutes, stir the cornstarch into water to dissolve. When the very hot, bubbly mixture comes out of the microwave, immediately stir in the cornstarch mixture, vanilla and peanut butter. Stir QUICKLY (it sets up really quick) and pour into a foil lined 8 x 8 pan.  --Cathy

I have never eaten peanut butter fudge with brown suger.  It was pretty good, a little grainy though.  I must have over cooked it a little bit, kinda crumbled on me when cutting. Or, I might not have waited until it cooled enough before adding the peanut butter.

I made this and would like to say it is smooth, creamy and delicious just as most reviews claimed!

I want to add this to my review:

I just made a double recipe of this and realized that the first time I made this fudge I removed the pan from the burner before I added the cornstarch mixture when you are supposed to add it while it's still on the burner and then remove it from the heat. 

It turned out ok the first time as my son begged me to make more today. I have just been scraping the pan and can tell its even better and was so much easier to spread out. 

Maybe this could help someone to know?

Excellent. I don't know how anyone can eat that marshmallow gunk when you can so easily make real fudge. :) Someone commented theirs came out gritty. As long as you get to the softball stage that won't happen.

SO smooth!  It helps to have a second pair of hands to help with the final stages, or at least to measure everything out ahead of time so all you have to do is grab and dump.  But this didn't take long and it came out delicious!

This was my first try at making fudge of any sort. The fact that this batch turned out great tells me the recipe is a keeper -- I followed it exactly as written (I had no expertise to fall back on for altering it in any manner). Very peanut buttery taste, creamy texture. No grit. Excellent! Novices don't be frightened off. Just grab a candy thermometer and get started!

I chose this recipe the first time because I had all of the ingredients on hand... Now, I'll never make another type of peanut butter fudge. I've made this recipe dozens of times, and it always turns out creamy and delicious! I've shared this recipe with so many friends, everyone loves it!

This is my families favorite fudge.  I tried a different recipe this year and they all wanted to know how the fudge got ruined.  I threw the new recipe out and going back to this one.  Very creamy.

This really is a great recipe, the fudge was wonderful and it is truly a simple recipe. They really are sweet and for some that is okay but for others it can be a bit too much. If you add just a pinch of salt it really helps in cutting the sweetness and makes the perfect fudge for those not-so-sweet sweet toothes out there. Enjoy!!

I love this fudge !!!!!!  I don't use a candy thermometer, and it still turns out every time by testing to soft ball in water.  I have added the cornstarch and water to my chocolate fudge and it seems to make it creamier.  This is a great recipe.

The taste is delicious, but it was drying out and beginning to harden before I got the vanilla and PB mixed in.  Next time I think I will put the cornstarch and water in with the milk, b utter, sugar, and then add the PB and vanilla when I remove it from the stove.

very good recipe.  used a meat probe thermometer set to 234*, mixed 1/2 tsp cornstarch into the vanilla instead of water.  kept stirring to a minimum after boiling to avoid it turning grainy.  so good!  will never make with marshmallow creme again!!

A delicious fudge recipe and easy to make. I did as another reviewer recommended and let it sit for 10 minutes before adding the cornstarch.  I also substituted the milk for light cream, gave it a nice and creamy texture.  Will definitely be making this again! Thank you!

Love Love Love. This is a great fudge when I mixed this I poured it into another bowl, but next time I will keep it in the sauce pan, as I think this is why it was setting up before I poured it into the pan. But it great, I savored every bite.

This was okay--certainly not the best fudge ever. It's flavour was good, but not spectacular, and it was very dry.

I have tasted peanutbutter fudge before but never as good as this one. I loved the fact that it didnt call for marshmellow creme and it has lots of real peanutbutter flavor. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing the recipe

I am a peanut butter snob and have tried many recipes and this is my favorite of all.  Using brown sugar only gave this a praline taste. I could not find my candy thermometer and was forced to use the soft ball in water test. Thankfully I judged correctly. You do need to work quickly once you add the peanut butter and vanilla. I also line my dish with heavy duty foil or parchment paper. Lifting it all out of the dish after cool makes slicing a breeze.

I have never made fudge that used brown sugar, until this one. It was really simple and easy. Best of all, very tasty!

Very good! I was worried that it looked a bit dry when I was spreading it in the pan, but it turned out great! The kids really go for this.

These are the exact same ingredients and amounts for my recipe, but it's made in the microwave!  Put brown sugar, butter and milk in a large bowl and stir.  Microwave 3 min. on HI.  Stir.  Microwave 3 more min. on HI.  Stir.  Microwave 2 min. on HI.    While in for the last 2 minutes, stir the cornstarch into water to dissolve.  When the very hot, bubbly mixture comes out of the microwave, immediately stir in the cornstarch mixture, vanilla and peanut butter.  Stir QUICKLY (it sets up really quick) and pour into a foil lined 8 x 8 pan (or 2 foil lined loaf pans).  Cool (no need to refrigerate).    I've wondered if using less cornstarch (or none) would make it not set up while stirring in the last three ingredients and it's sometimes dry.  Delish though!

On my first attempt, I followed the recipe to the letter. Used my digital instant-read candy thermometer, heated to 238 degrees. My fudge came out very sticky/tacky, not the smooth crumbly texture I wanted. I'm confused as to why you don't let the mixture set like with other fudge, and instead stir immediately. I think I will try it again, omitting the corn starch, letting it set first, and then adding peanut butter and vanilla warmed to 110 degrees (to prevent the fudge from seizing on contact).  I gave it 3 stars because it failed for me when I followed the directions exactly.

This stuff is great! Had to hurry up though because it does set fast. I made it even better by pouring melted Hersey's milk chocolate chips on top. About 2 cups per batch. Tastes just like a peanut butter cup.

My husband and I just made the fudge and it has a great texture....very smooth and creamy.  It also had the deep peanut butter flavor we were craving and I think the brown sugar brought the flavor out because I've never made fudge with brown sugar before.  Very good recipe.  There was just "something" missing from the recipe but I can't figure it out so that's the only reason for this middle rating.

Thank you for sharing your recipe. It makes a really creamy peanut butter fudge that everyone seems to enjoy.  I think next time I make it I might use crunchy peanut butter just for the added taste and texture.

Thank you!  What a truly wonderful recipe.  I did not have a candy thermometer and it still turned out great, all I did was take it to the soft ball stage.  I've tried many fudge recipes in the past but either they were grainy or had a lack of flavor.  I feel this was very fast and easy.  The best and creamiest fudge I've ever had.  Debbie

I left in in the fridge for about 20 hours after I made this. When I got it, a thin layer had formed on the top, but the rest was just like the mixture before being chilled in the fridge. But, I rate 3 stars because it didn’t contain eggs, so it was still edible. So I still ate it, and my daughter and I loved it.

I 'd never made fudge with brown sugar before and I don't think I will again. The brown sugar flavor was just too strong and overpowered the peanut butter. My husband didn't even eat all of the batch I made for him and over half of it went in the trash. It was also very crumbly - not at all the texture or flavor I was hoping for. I followed the recipe exactly. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe as directed and it turned out good but was not quite as peanut buttery as I had hoped. This is a very hard recipe to work with. You have less than a minute to Stir in the peanut butter and vanilla and then "pour" into a pan before it turns into hard little pebbles that are better served as an ice cream topping. The fudge comes out a little dry but good. I'm on the look out for a spectacular old fashioned Peanut Butter Fudge recipe that does NOT use marshmallow. This was not the spectacular recipe I've been looking for but it is tasty. The search continues.

VERY tasty, but boy does it set-up fast!  I had trouble getting it into the pan because it was so hard.  Once it had cooled, it was a bit crumbly but, like I said, tasted great!  Oh, btw, I melted 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in the microwave and spread that over the top.  It helped hold everything together better and gave it that "Reece's" flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last year for my mom on her birthday. Peanut butter fudge is her tradition instead of cake. I love this recipe and have tried many.

Way to sweet and to grainy.  If you are not use to something this sweet it will upset your tummy.
