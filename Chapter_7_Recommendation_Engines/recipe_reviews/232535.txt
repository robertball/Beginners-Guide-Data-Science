I only had one granny smith apple, so that's what I used.  Also, used a 6-oz container of Chobani No-Fat Lemon Yogurt which was a delicious dressing for this salad.   Many apple salads are loaded with mayo, so the yogurt is a nice deviation.  Very nice fruit salad.---------EDIT 9.29.13-----Had this for breakfast today, and it held up very well overnight, did not get runny.  Just be sure to drain your mandarin oranges very well.

We had our first luncheon of the year at work today.  I work at a school and we take turns (by departments) each month and sponsor a luncheon.  I made this and doubled the recipe.  Huge hit! Everyone liked it and there was enough left over for me to stop at my parents' house after work and share with them.  I used lemon greek yogurt and everyone said they loved the dressing on this.  Very nice salad with a Fall twist to it.

I tried the recipe  but I didn't have grapes. So instead I put 1 cup of blueberries. I also add another apple,  20oz of mandarin, 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/4 cup of hemp hearts and increased  the lemon yogurt  to 1 1/2 cup.  My family loved it

Gave it two stars about two hours after I made it--the lemon flavor is really strong. The next day, though, the lemon had receded, and the flavors had blended perfectly.  We finished off the entire bowl for lunch!!

YES, Sunshine...my mother did the same! It was a little different, hers had bananas & cherries, cut in half & she called it Waldorf salad as well! She's in heaven now, but OH those memories so lovely...

I made a point of ordering a Waldorf fruit salad @ The Waldorf Hotel in NYC, I was that curious to see how close mama was? It was different, but yummy too, I'm not sure what they used to bring it all together? Now I try to do a healthier spin & all fresh ingredients...apples; pineapple;oranges;plain Greek yogurt; (flavored by me w/vanilla & truvia)a touch of mini-marshmallows;fresh or frozen cherries;I put in fridge long enough for flavors to play nice. Then add nuts & coconut before serving.It's just as tasty, but I think a bit healthy then old school recipes. Thanks for the memory...

This is a perfectly healthy modification of my favorite childhood salad. The lemon low fat yogurt worked GREAT as a substitute for whipped cream. We substituted almonds for walnuts as my picky Philly Hubby "HATES" walnuts, and fresh mandrin oranges for a bit more nutitional value. It got an official Philly LIKES it! Another keeper for my healthy recipes! (also cut down the marshmellows by half if you are diabetic)

This is awesome. I make it at least once a week. We love it for a desert or late night snack. Add a few more fruits, whatever I have at the time. Strawberries, pineapple, blueberries and maraschino cherries for a pop of color. Thanks so much for sharing.

Really good, refreshing salad enjoyed by kids and adults alike.
A favorite of my grandkids! I don't add as many marshmallows  
or none at all - I think  they make it too sweet.

My 7 yr old loved this. I used plain greek yogurt and a tablespoon of lemon juice. I skipped the walnuts. The second time I made this even my husband loved it. I used dairy-free plain greek yogurt and a little lemon juice, no walnuts.  I also forgot the oranges.

I added some of the juice from the mandarins to the Activia lemon yogourt and it was the perfect consistency for the dressing.  Also, I sprinkled some sunflower seeds on top for some extra crunch.  Absolutely scrumptious!!!  I will definitely be making this many more times.
