I loved baking the potato this way.  But I did pierce the potato several times and then brush on the oil with the garlic powder and salt mixed in, I think the flavor went inside that way instead of just staying on the skin.   I also baked them on foil and on a baking sheet to eliminate the drips and make it easier to handle.  The extra potatoes I baked made great cubed and fried leftovers!

I’ve baked many a potato but until now I’ve never oiled the skin first.  Seasoning the outside with salt and pepper was something I’ve never done before either.  As Hubs put it, this was a wonderful treatment of a baked potato.  If you’re thinking it spices it up, it doesn’t.  But it makes the peel of the potato deliciously flavorful and even kind of crispy.  Don’t wrap your potatoes in foil before baking.  And DO rub them with oil as in this recipe.  A medium-sized potato (I pricked it with a fork a few times) was perfectly baked in one hour at 375 degrees.  A baked potato never tasted so good.

I haven't done this in years, as I'm so used to doing them on the grill anymore - my husband really wanted that "old school" way of a baked potato from the oven tonight so I thought I'd indulge him. These are delicious - "crispy on the outside and soft on the inside". I didn't bother with the whole "bag thing" I just used my fingers to rub the potatoes with oil and used garlic powder and a bit of kosher salt. I pierced the potatoes a couple of times with a fork and wrapped them in foil - you really don't want a mess in your oven. These were soooo good -all that was needed was a little butter, salt, & pepper. Great classic recipe!

I liked the skin on this potato. But The outside was a bit drier than I would have liked. I still felt the inside needed a little butter but the potato was nice and soft. I think if I were to do these again I would try maybe doing as directed but them wrapping in foil. Then when the potatoes are done you could unwrap cut in half and drizzle any remaining olive oil and seasonings left over in the foil packet over the top. Yum! Great starting point for flavorful baked potatoes though!

I made these potatoes for dinner today to go with the Easy Yet Romantic Filet Mignon (also found on allrecipes.com).  I usually in a hurry so I just microwave my potatoes but the skins are never crisp or all that appetizing so I wanted to give this recipe a try.  I baked my potatoes a little slower at 300 degrees for two hours or so.  I didn’t measure anything.  I just oiled the potatoes and then sprinkled the seasonings on to my preference.  They turned out very well.  We topped them with butter, sour cream and pepper.  There was nothing left on our plates and my husband usually isn’t a potato skin eater.  Thanks for a recipe I will use again and again.

This was okay for me. The potatoe was fluffy and good, but i still needed butter and sour cream. Plus, my favorite part is eating the skin when I'm done, and the seasoning made the skin way too salty. I'm not too excited to make it this way again.

I liked this recipe a lot.  It was a great change a pace from plan baked potatoes.  It was so good and so easy I can believe that I hadn't thought of it myself.  I think I my even try it again with a mixture of different spices and salt.

Really enjoyed these potatoes!!  I made only two minor changes.  1.  Cooked on a foil lined baking sheet.  2.  Used my Misto to spray olive oil on the potatoes rather than using the baggie.  I usually 'bake' my potatoes in the microwave.  These were a million times better!

Very tasty, I have been doing this for some time . I place the potatoes on a foil pie plate to bake . As well I push a poultry skewer through the potatoe length wise, this ensures the potatoe is cooked through as the skewer is metal and heats up. 
Enjoy baked potatoes always , now to head for the grocery store ...............

This was delicious.  Had my parents come over for a thank you dinner for some remodeling help...and this was perfect.  Dad loves baked potato and he ate every bite of this.  I didn't change a thing....perfect as is.  Thanks for the post.

These were awesome!!!  I poked the potatoes with a fork to seal in some flavor & wrapped them in foil, baked for a little oven an hour just until soft.  Made some cheese sauce & bacon for the top...mmmmm!  New way to make potatoes!

I just coat the potato with olive oil spray Crisco Brand has the best taste) and sprinkle liberally with kosher salt, garlic power and pepper. Only way to make baked potatoes IMHO.

These were wonderful, but I changed the recipe, so only giving it 4 stars.  I think 2 teaspoons of garlic salt would have been waaaaay too much!  I used only 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and about 1/8 teaspoon fresh ground pepper.  I baked them, uncovered, in a stoneware dish for 1 hour, and they tasted great!  My husband loved them!  My new way to bake potatoes!

This was "OK." It is what it is... a basic potato. There is nothing complex about it (and no recipe really exists for it). I can't actually believe I am rating a baked potato (haha!)!!! All aside, I liked the subtle garlicky taste, but my fiance didn't even notice it (too bad!). Made two potatoes for the sole purpose of serving (topped) with Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue (Zane Peters), melted co-jack cheese and sour cream. Other than that, my only change was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt (garlic salt PLUS salt was too much IMHO). Oh, and I added my spices with the EVOO in my Zip-lock bag to make prep easier (as if it wasn't already!!!). Thanks for sharing Mama's Cooking 4_3 :)

I followed this recipe exactly but instead of putting the potatoes directly on the rack(i knew it would make a mess on the bottom of my oven), I put them on a layer of tin foil which solved the problem. They were way too salty for my taste. Next time, instead of garlic salt, I'm going to use garlic powder and maybe add a bit of salt.

I have made potatoes like this for years, the only difference is that I use cinnamon instead of salt and pepper. The garlic and cinnamon really compliment each other. The salt and pepper in this recipe was something I had never thought of. Excellent potatoes

An amazing improvement on baked potatoes.  I wish I knew this tip years ago.  I still add butter and sour cream to the inside, but now I eat the skin as well!

So delicious!! Also, instead of wrapping or placing potatoes on a pan to keep your oven clean, try putting a baking sheet on the rack below the potatoes. The only mess to clean is the rack which is an easy scrub/wipe.

Putting olive oil covered anything in the oven means smoke but otherwise this is a simple recipe. I poked holes in the potatos to let the garlic in a bit then of course they still need a bunch more once you open them up. De-lish!

Thank You for sharing, I will always use this technique if I am on the ball enough to start dinner an hour before time to eat!

I was surprised that I seen a recipe for a baked potato. I have a favorite way I make them, but decided to give this a try. I normally just use salt and not garlic salt. I thought it might be too overpowering, but it actually gave the skin a nice flavor. I did half the recipe and followed the ingredients exactly. I did use my normal method of baking the potato though. I may try this again and follow that part of the recipe to, to see if it is any different. This went well with a steak for dinner.

I made these this past weekend.  We loved them.  Didn't have olive oil so used canola oil, was still wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will be making these again

This recipe is a great start, but I make a few additions. After cleaning and poking holes in the potato, by hand, I coat each potato with a generous amount of olive oil, salt, and garlic powder. I bake them for the first 10-15 min at 400 degrees and at 325 for the remainder of the hour, turning them once.  They come out crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside!

These smelled so good while cooking! I used garlic powder instead of the salt and also placed the potatoes on foil to bake. Delicious and thanks, Spookpro!

Perfect Potato! I never knew how to get the outside of my baked potato flavorful and crispy until now. Because I love garlic so much, I added minced garlic to the oil. It was wonderful! Also, I cooked the potatoes on a pizza pan! They came out perfect!

Yum.  What a simple recipe to jazz up the baked potato!  I followed this recipe exactly and did not find the skin a bit salty-it was nice and crisp and flavorful.  I will surely be making this again!

I thought this was a good recipe and it tasted great.  However by putting the potato directly on the rack some of the oil dripped onto the bottom of the oven and made a huge mess.  I will make sure to put foil on the bottom of the oven next time.  Otherwise great recipe!

This is definitely an improvement over just popping them in the oven. Makes them nice and crispy, just the way my hubby likes them.  Thanks for sharing!

Needed an hour recipe to bake my potatoes, so did this. I agree, you can just spray or brush on oil and sprinkle seasonings to it. We did garlic salt and it was delicious. I also put them on a foil lined bake sheet for easy cleanup. We did add our butter, sour cream, salt, and cheese of course!

Very tasty, crisp skin hot and very soft inside. A very nice potatoe to serve company. Be careful not to put too much oil on or it will drip off the potatoe onto your oven bottom.

The positives of my 3 stars are 1) it doesn't demand that holes be poked into the skin,  2) the potatoes are cooked in the over rather than the microwave and 3) 375 for 1 hour is just about perfect.  The negatives...1 ) why not just rub the outside of the potato with olive oil or butter with your hands and sprinkle on whatever seasonings you want instead of going through all of the hoop-la of a bag, a plate, etc.? We are a family of "skin eaters" and I find that by rubbing the well scrubbed potatoes down with some olive oil or butter with your hands, then sprinkling with some kosher salt and coarse pepper (and garlic powder, I suppose), rubbing in to help adhere and baking at 375-400

This was perfect!  I love the crunchy skin and this was the way to do it.  The potato was fluffy inside and crispy on the outside but still flaky and not tough.

This was really good and just a notch up from standard foil wrapped baked potatoes! I didn't really notice the salt or garlic powder flavor, but I think the olive oil soaked through the potato skin and gave a nice creamy texture to the inside.

What a fun twist on a classic.  I'm all about flavor and these were great!  The next time I made them I added a slice of bacon between the two halves for a nice perk of flavor.

Didn't change anything, and we loved it. It will be a staple now. Perfectly crispy on the outside and perfect consistency inside. Added butter to the inside after it was done and that was all. Thanks!

I am not sure this is the person I got this recipe from but it seems close enough.  I loved it.  I make with garlic powder and a good amount of pepper and some salt.  The olive oil makes the potatoes crispy. I have grilled and baked in oven.  Everyone that comes to eat loves these baked potatoes!!  Sour Cream & butter just add to the flavor.  Thank you for the recipe, it is easy and delicious!!

Was looking for a way to make them the way I like without using grill.  I usually microwave for about 15 min (poke holes first) then afterward rub butter or olive oil and garlic salt on, wrap in foil and place on bbq for 10 min.  This works too if it rains like today!! :)  If you are a big garlic fan like we are, the BEST topping is sour cream with crushed garlic...it so sooooooo good!  Its up to how many cloves you crush, depending on your garlic preference!

my husband doesn't like potatoes and he realy enjoyed these.  I like butter and sour cream but my hubby liked them plain.  I think that part of butter or none is really a matter of opion.

Loved this.  I had to reduce the cooking time so I heated the potatoes in the microwave for 4 mins on each side.  Make sure you stick them with a fork to make some holes so they don't explode.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe, adding pepper to the skin as well and baked for 25 mins.  Topped with butter and sour cream.  The skin was so cripsy I will make my baked potatoes like this from now on!

These were just okay... I definitely still needed toppings. The skin had a nice flavor, but considering my boyfriend refuses to eat potato skins, it was a bit pointless. Very little garlic flavor was present inside. Probably won't bother making again.

I thought this was really good.  I like the method of rubbing the potato with olive oil and seasonings.  The garlic could have been a little stronger, though.

This was so simple and so good.  You don't even need butter or sour cream because the skin of the potato is so good after using this recipe.  And it was so easy!!

Nice, easy twist on a baked potato.  Even my 3 year old liked it and ate the skin!  I brushed the olive oil on the potatoes instead of using a plastic bag.  Will definitely make this again.

I needed to cook these early in the day so when ahead and wrapped them in foil... kind of made them soggy.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will put them directly on the rack.  Very flavorful!

Good recipe. I did end up putting butter and sour cream on the potatoes but that was just by personal choice. The kids liked this but couldn't really tell that anything was different.
