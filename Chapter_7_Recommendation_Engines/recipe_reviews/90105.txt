This is a great recipe; however, I made a few amendments. I used plain yogurt instead of milk/cream as a low-fat alternative, which provided a nice, thicker consistency. Since I prefer extra spicy foods, I also added in an additional teaspoon (or two) of the cumin. Using cauliflower instead of potatoes in the recipe provides a light texture, which complements starchy side dishes such as rice. Overall, I highly recommend this dish.

I substituted crushed tomatoes for the tomato soup, and used coconut milk as the milk in this recipe.  It yields a nice, mild curry, which was a good introduction to Indian food for my boyfriend, but I found it somewhat too mild for my taste, and added some sriracha chile sauce.  I'll definitely make this recipe again, but will continue to experiment with different additions, like cayenne pepper and/or raisins.

We absolutely loved this.  This was my first time to make a curry dish, but I had some garbanzo beans I needed to use and thought I'd give this a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I made it just as it said (except I used a packet of soup and half the water it called for) and it was so extremely flavorful.  I served it with naan and guferati (Indian green beans) from this site and my hubby just raved and raved!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Added note:  Be sure to not skimp on the time of cooking the spices.  This seems to be a vital step in releasing the full flavor of the spices.  The second time I made it, it wasn't nearly as flavorful and the only difference was that I was in a hurry and just stirred them around a bit this time.  It was still good, but not wow good like the first time.

Using canned tomatoes, and tomate paste give this a bolder, more thangy flavour that I think chickpeas need, as they can tend to be more creamy/nuttier and lend themselves well to the tangy thick richness of a tomatoe paste vs. soup.  Also, make sure you watch your ingredients that have too many additives (like the soup) as these additives really take away from the clean, refreshing simplicity this dish  embodies.  It's also full of digestible protein and most little kids love it!

I love this recipe!!!  I used cauliflower instead of potatos.  I use sour cream instead of cream.  I also use half tomato soup and half crushed tomatos to add more flavor.  If you don't saute the herbs first this recipe will be bland.  Cooking them by themselves brings out their flavor.

This recipe is awesome!  
Also, as a vegan, I appreciated that this recipe is was really easy for me to convert into a vegan recipe.  Instead of using regular milk, I used rice milk.  Rice milk works very well if you are trying to modify this recipe to be vegan-friendly.  Unlike soymilk, rice milk doesn't leave a distinct flavor that might clash with some of the other flavors in the curry.  
I will definitely make this curry again!

This is a really tasty recipe. Cauliflower is a good substitute for the potatoes, and really cuts the cooking time. Added zucchini for some green. Thanks!

This is nice.  I doubled the cumin, added 2 teaspoons of green thai curry paste, used a can of chopped tomato instead of soup, used half sweet potato and half carrot... and substituted the milk for 1/2 can low fat coconut milk.  I'll definitely be using this one again - really tasty :)

WOW!! This is so yummy! I followed the recipe pretty much to a tee... only difference is I added more garlic plus one red pepper, plus some ground red pepper to kick up the spice. I bet it will be even better tomorrow. I can see this being very adaptable... switching out potatoes for veggies, etc. Also, I used lite coconut milk and it was still creamy and delish. Definitely a keeper, thnx!!

WOW!! My first attempt at Indian food. DELICIOUS! My changes, after reading the reviews: I only used 2 potatoes and   added the equivalent in cauliflower to make up for the missing 2 potatoes (I steamed the cauliflower first). I did use the tomato soup base (couldn't recognize the taste at all). This had a phenomenal taste--flavourful but not very spicy. THANK YOU!

This is a nice, mild curry, which was perfect for the kiddies.  I prefer a bolder, spicier curry, but this recipes can be easily modified to ones own tastes.  Next time, I will use diced tomatoes, tomato paste instead of the soup (I think the soup made it a bit sweeter than I prefer).  I also used coconut milk, which added to the yummy-ness!  One question though...if it's called "Butter Chickepea Curry"...where is the BUTTER??  Thanks for sharing.

This is 5 stars with some modifications: cauliflower is WAY better. A little more curry powder and some more heat is good. I use diced tomatoes instead of soup. Cream or coconut milk is a must. Also, there are tons of different kinds of garam masalas out there so you should add that based on how it tastes.

This recipe was simply amazing. I used black quinoa instead of rice, and it turned out amazing. I also used fresh instead of dry ginger, and added 2 tsp of chili flakes and Thai red curry paste. To add a little variety, I used 2 potatoes, a sweet potato and two carrots instead of the four potatoes. Amazing recipe!

well, pretty good.  i was a little bit skeptical about the powdered ginger (why use powder when you could use fresh?) but it gave it a nice bite.

of note:
1.  instead of potatoes i used cauliflower because i think potato with rice is too much.  i cut it into florettes and roasted it in the oven with some olive oil, s&p, then added it at the end
2.  i double the spices, if i hadn't, i think it would have been pretty bland
3.  on the first day it still tasted pretty tomato-soupey to my palate, this flavour was gone on the second day
4.  i made sure to caramelize the onions, one of my indian cookbooks says that's usually what to do with indian cooking
5.  instead of just cream i used some cream and some coconut milk
6.  top with fresh cilantro and serve on basmati rice

Perfect for our Meatless Mondays.  I substituted a can of coconut milk for the milk, substituted drained diced tomatoes for the tomato soup and upped the curry powder to 1Tbl.  I also added 1 Tbl. honey and garnished with cilantro.  Seved with rice it makes a very substantial meal.

I brought this to a family potluck w/Afghani bread and was a bit nervous because my family isn't into spicy or 'exotic' foods.  They loved it and I received numerous compliments!  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe.  First I did half potatoes and half cauliflower, which definitely gave it a lot more texture and flavor.  I would maybe add carrots next time....  I didn't have garam masala so I substituted a mixture of tumeric, cinnamon, and ground cloves.  The flavor came out great, but very mild so I would use some cayenne or add peppers next time.  I also substituted the milk/cream with light coconut milk and replaced the recommended amount of powder ginger with fresh ginger.  I used a 26 oz. can of tomato soup (for a double recipe) which was a little more than called for in the recipe but found the sauce to be the perfect consistency for picking up with the Afghani bread.

Very happy with this recipe.  As others have suggested, i substituted the tomato soup with crushed tomatoes and about 1 tsp of tomato paste, half of the potatoes with coliflower, cream with yoghurt, and vegetable oil with clarified butter.

YUM!  I used coconut milk and I accidentally added the whole can of it to the pot but adding some canned diced tomatoes remedied that.  I added more garlic, curry powder, and added some black pepper and chili sauce to make it spicier.  This was delicious over rice.

This recipe was a big hit (I wish I had doubled it)! It could not be quicker or easier. I used coconut oil but any oil will do. I used evaporated milk because it was all I had and it went well. It tastes creamier than regular milk and it has less fat than cream. Everything else was exactly what the recipe called for. The flavour reminded me very much of "Butter Chicken" that you get at an Indian restaurant. I'm lazy and like to do things in one pot so I thinly sliced the potatoes and threw them in with the oil, onion, garlic and spices. I also threw in the chickpeas at this point. I like their flavour fried, plus they pop and jump in the pan and that's fun. I sautéed all of that together until the potatoes were almost cooked. This step really helped bring out the flavour of the spices nicely too. The last thing I added was the tomato soup and the milk. My Fiancé hates canned tomato soup, well any tomato soup really. He couldn't even tell there was tomato soup in this recipe and went back for seconds and thirds. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

Why is it called butter curry when there is no butter?  That said, this is a very easy and versatile recipe.  I steamed a small head of cauliflower instead of the potatoes. I then doubled the spices. I used twice as much spicy V-8 instead of tomato soup and 1 cup plain yogurt instead of milk/cream. I then added a can each of peas and diced tomatoes along with the chickpeas.  I added salt at the end to my liking since there would already be plenty of salt in the other ingredients.  Satisfied my curry craving!

I love chana masala and the addition of potatoes is superb. It adds more substance to the dish. Because I didn't have (and do not like) condensed tomato soup, I added about 2/3 of a 15oz can of crushed tomatoes instead. I had left over coconut milk from another dish I had made so I used that instead of the milk. Loved it. Served with white rice, naan and butter chicken.

A Little Spicy But Really Good!
Make sure you cook the onions really thoroughly before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Simple to make and delicious but on the spicy side.

I started using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  The contrast was amazingly tasty.  Will never use regular potatoes for this dish again!

I love this curry for it's ease of preparation and for it's creamy, mild, and slightly sweet flavor.  I've made it with cooked, cubed chicken instead of chickpeas, and it was wonderful that way, too.  The recipe is very kid friendly, also.  My DH loves it with naan.

Absolutely delicious.  It tastes just like my favorite Indian Restauant's.  I used cauliflower in place of the potatoes.  I also added just a little extra spice and it was perfect!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed others' recommendations and added a lot more spice to this.  Also, potatoes and chickpeas made it VERY starchy, so next time I will probably pick only on of the two and add zucchini and other veggies instead

I didn't have garam masala and it wasn't in the local grocer; so I looked up a substitute; of course I only had 5 of 7 ingredients of the substitute, but I added them in with this recipe, plus a jar of tikki masala and a cup of raisins. Along the way I added more milk; the raisins absorbed some liquid. Anyway, my husband and I both loved. Really good on white rice with a side of na'an...it was a heavy carb. night. good stuff though

Amazing! This is by far my favorite curry recipe now. The first time I made it I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand and it worked out so well that now that's my standard. I substituted about 3 tbsp of tomato paste mixed into a cup of water in place of the tomato soup. I also used coconut milk instead of the cream. I think that gave the dish a little added sweetness and kept it non-dairy for my lactose intolerant husband. I've also used sweet potatoes with stellar results. Last time I made it I turned it into an entree for company by adding chicken. Delicious in every variation!

This was delicious, easy, and very quick to prepare! I found that the cook time was only 20 minutes rather than the 40 minutes listed. The only changes I made (which made the recipe GFCF) were to double the garlic, cut the garam masala in half to 1 tsp. (it was fairly spicy with 2 tsp.), use a can of diced tomatoes with the juice instead of condensed tomato soup, and use almond milk instead of cream. I served it over brown rice, and everyone loved it!

This was delicious! I did add cauliflower and sweet potatoes as well as a handful of chopped spinach which made it look and taste wonderful. I also used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes and about half a can of low-fat coconut milk instead of the soup.  Will make this again. My guests (family) asked if they could take the leftovers home.

I followed the instructions exactly, and i didn't think that it made a very flavourful dish. i really had to add to it. 
I added some crushed tomatoes, extra curry powder, extra salt and pepper, and some extra water.
After all that it was okay.

I have just started experimenting with different curry recipes, this was nice and easy, not overpowering, my 11 year old loved it. I used my Costco can of tomato soup which is a 15 oz can and added a large chicken breast that was already diced and cooked, came out great.

This was excellent--I only left out a star because I changed it up and I don't like when people give five stars and it turns out they didn't actually make the recipe. Instead of potatoes, I used butternut squash, which broke down and made the sauce really thicken. I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the soup, and a can of light coconut milk instead of the cream. I also used two cans of chickpeas instead of one because of all the extra saucy ingredients. However, this was extremely easy and tasty and I will be making it for some vegetarian guests soon.

This dish was excellent.  My husband and I loved it, but I must say my preschoolers were unimpressed.  It is a great vegetarian main dish and tastes a lot like a dish at our favorite Indian restaurant.

Even my 4 year old enjoyed this dish! I doubled the cumin, used evaporated milk, and used tomato paste rather than the soup. I think next time I'll add more milk to make more of a sauce or even try yogurt as others have suggested. Very good!

Oh, wow, this was really good! I have a hard time liking some of the things I make, nothing seems quite right or tastes quite good enough, but this was delicious! Okay, my tongue is on fire, but that's because I took some suggestions and added part of a can of stewed tomatoes (that I diced). They were "Mexican flavor" which is what I had that I thought would go w/it, since it included cumin. It also included jalapenos! Still, muy yummy!
I used evaporated milk since I had a partial can in the fridge.. More garlic than called for (personal preference) and little more curry and garam masala.
This was so good, thank you thank you!!
I think I'm the only one in my family that will eat it (no one else cares for chickpeas) but if I can stop eating now, I will have some more for lunch tomorrow!

The flavor in this dish is simply amazing and the chickpeas offerred a nice bit of crunch. It makes for a wonderful side dish, or for a full meal. My one recomendation for this recipe, would be to not serve this over rice. The potatoes are starchy enough, and on top of rice is kind of overkill.

My husband rated this one a "5!"  I admit I was wary at first of an authentic tasting Indian recipe using a can of tomato soup, but this really was very good.  When sauteeing the onion I added a sliced green pepper to it for some color and crunch.  I served this over white rice with homemade naan on the side.  I'll make this one again!

Used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the soup and used some plain yogurt instead of milk/cream per other reviews.  It was quick and made a nice dish.  Next time I would try cauliflower per suggestions.

I used one good sized potato and would not want more of it here. I threw in a handful of multi-colored peppers during the onion saute, adding the garlic at the very end for a short while. For the tomatoes, I added a can (not drained) of fire-roasted tomatoes. Also added 2+ tsp of curry powder, as others did. I like spicy so added a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and it was PLENTY spicy for me. Had no garam masala, and just realized I forgot to add the cumin. A nice, tasty dish, one I'm sure to make again. Thanks for the recipe, Sushi!

Only gave this four stars because I made quite a few changes to the original recipe.  Substituted coconut milk for the milk and used probably about a cup's worth.  Only used half a can of the tomato soup and added a can of diced tomatoes.  Also used 2 large potatoes instead of 4 and included some leftover cauliflower.  Very versatile recipe and could use many different types of vegetables if wanted.  Would like to try adding some pineapple chunks next time.

Delicious!  I was looking for something quick, easy and tasty for my vegetarian son and this was perfect!  He loved it so much we all had to try it.  I was instantly sorry I hadn't made more. I'll be making it again for sure.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this using cauliflower as suggested, also added corn and about 50% more of each spice. I thought it was really good at first, but near middle-end I was tired of the same flavor. Definitely good but I think it might be better as a side dish.

I have made this several times using cauliflower instead of sweet potatoes. I also use fire roasted tomatoes instead of the soup and light coconut milk. The whole batch costs less than $10 to make, and with a side of rice, I fed myself and 5 friends! The level of spice is just right. I'm sure it'd be great with white or sweet potatoes, but I'm trying to limit my starches. This is a cheap, quick, and healthy meal. And guess what? My husband eats it without asking where the meat is! This has become a staple for me! Thanks for sharing, and thanks to the other reviewers for suggestions.

Very good, good flavor. Spicy but not hot.  The only things I did different was that I used dried chickpeas that I had slow cooked for 2 hours with a few cloves of garlic tossed in the cooking water instead of using canned beans.  I also used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of the soup.  will make this again!

I love this recipe. For a dairy free recipe --instead of cream or milk I use coconut milk and instead of condensed tomato soup I use regular tomato soup.

super delicious. I also substituted grilled sweet potatoes for the potatoes..made it twice in the slow cooker and both times was delicious!

This was delicious, so filling and healthy! I used a suggestion from previous comments to replace the cream with yogurt and doubled the chickpeas, but left everything else the same. This got a great reception at my place!

Wonderful new flavors for us, my husband loves it.  Amazed at the amount of spices used and how well they blend  together...going to try a full traditional meal next.

Made as directed.  It was very fragrant (my apartment smelled like cumin for days!).  One of the guys didn't like it at all; the husband and I thought it was okay.  Probably wouldn't make again.

This is so good.  Made it for dinner because I love curry.  It tasted wonderful and was so easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly.

Very good basic curry recipe. I used canned tomatoes in chunks instead of tomato soup and yogurt instead of milk to make a thicker sauce. It made a lot, but everyone loved it. :)

I doubled the spice and added 1/2 of a green pepper.  Make sure to cook the onions/green pepper until translucent.

This is a very good base recipe.  The first meal wasn't as good as the subsequent meals.  I should have cooked the spices a bit longer; this would have enhanced the flavor on the first day.  I also think that tumeric could have helped a bit.  I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup.  I would like to try tomato sauce at some point as well in an addition to the diced tomatoes.   I served this over rice with a bit of plain yogurt.  I will make it again.

Love this curry!  Made a few small tweeks...  I only had 2 medium potatoes.  I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  Added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper with the spices which I added to the oil FIRST and let cook for a few minutes before adding the onion.  Instead of cream I used 1/2 of a 13.5 oz. can of coconut milk.  And finally, instead of a 12 oz. can of chickpeas I used a 19 oz.  Came out nicely saucy (not dryish) and was mildly spicy.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I used a tomato sauce because I don't like the flavor of tomato soup and used natural soy milk instead of regular (lactose issues). Excellent flavor and I've made it a few times more for company.

This was excellent with a few minor changes.  There is one essential ingredient that is missing in this butter chickpea curry.... butter!  I replaced the oil with butter and added another two tablespoons or so.  Also, I prefer to use plain yogurt instead of milk because it gives it a thicker and creamier texture.  Other than that, no changes.  Yummy!

Yum! I've never made Indian food before - this was really easy, pretty quick and really delicious! Made it according to recipe except used a large potato, sweet potato, and about half a cauliflower. Flavorful enough for husband, but not too spicy for me.

was a good base. But even with caramelizing the onions and roasting the spices, it was quite bland. Tried again using chicken broth, tomato paste and some diced tomatoes. Ended up doing more on the spices, also adding coriander and cayenne. Made rice using thai coconut curry broth, was very good! thank you

I give this recipe 4 stars as is, but 5 with my tweaks. The spices are just right, although I might add a pinch of cayenne in the future. I made the following substitutions: two tomatoes pureed with 1T tomato paste and salt, cumin seed (which I sauteed with the onion), fresh ginger, and coconut milk. I also added peas and some greens I needed to use, and I subbed sweet potato for half the white potatoes. It's not very saucy, but it's just right if you eat it by itself rather than over rice. I'd make this again the same way.

This is a fantastic mild curry recipe if you've never tried Indian food before.  Start off with the recipe as is (but use coconut milk instead of reg milk and stewed tomatoes instead of soup) and then experiment with the spice factor to find the right "heat" for you.  We like a bit of medium spice and will add medium curry spices the next time around.  Added cauliflower and it was a nice addition.  Great to heat up the next day -- just pour in some leftover coconut milk and put it on the stove to warm.

this is one of my favorite curry type recipes. i absolutely love it! For my 13th birthday, I told my family that I would be making my own dinner for the family. I actually made this recipe! Everytime I make it, it's soooo good! One thing that I do is I usually double the batch. I put 4 of the white potatoes in aswell as 4 sweet potatoes.

It was good, even better the next day - The only thing I changed was I used tomato paste and coconut milk because I didn’t have soup, I also added chicken bouillon. Husband LOVED it, the leftovers will be going into his lunch served with pita bread.

Awesome recipe!  I made a couple of variations, but in general followed there recipe to a 't'.  I used some cauliflower in place of some of the potatoes and used coconut milk in place of the cream.  Other than that I followed 100%.  A keeper!

This was delicious! I made a few changes to make the dish a bit more flavorful.  I followed previous reviews and added an extra teaspoon of cumin and substituted plain yogurt for the cream/milk.  Then I added 1 teaspoon of ginger paste to the onion and garlic saute, used 8 oz of tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup, and added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  The flavors were unreal.  My husband LOVED it and my picky 2-year old devoured it, as well.  This will be made again and again in my house.

The recipe is good and not difficult to make! I fried the spices before the onions like suggested, and it definitely did not come out bland. I always imagined cooking curries to be really complicated, but this was easy. This recipe has now become a weekly rotation for my husband and I, we love it!

Delicious!  I subbed steamed chopped cauliflower (1/2 head) for the potato; 1 can chopped tomatoes with jalapeno for the tomato soup; 1 can coconut milk for the cream; ginger paste for the ginger powder; red onion instead of yellow and olive oil instead of canola and I added chopped cilantro at the end and served it with choice of basmati rice or naan. I tolerate raw cauliflower and HATE cooked cauliflower but I thought this recipe, cauliflower included was wonderful.  It's very flavorful, not too spicy and my South Indian husband LOVED it.

I love this recipe, I've made it several times in fact it's cooking on the stove now.  The only changes I made were to make it more healthy by using 2 large sweet potatoes (chop them up and boil them separately) and instead of condensed tomato soup I use a large 29 oz. can of Hunts tomato sauce because I like to have a lot of sauce to go over the basmati rice (or brown rice if I want to be really good)   Sometimes I add apples and/or golden raisins.  A very healthy vegetarian meal to serve the family once in a while.  Thanks for sharing.

I had to omit the ginger due to a guest having an allergy, so it missed a bit of zip, but the dish was still great. I served it on top of some garlic and olive oil couscous. I definitely intend to make this again!

I was a little disappointed when I made this, only because it didn't LOOK like what I thought it would. I don't really know what I was expecting -- maybe not so thick and red? Anyway, I took one bite and was in love! My very picky kids (5, 3, & 2) even loved it. I served it over rice, and will DEFINITELY be making it again!

This is so yummy!!  I did substitute fresh ginger for the powdered ginger and cooked it with the onions and garlic instead. As well I did not have any tomato soup so I used a can of tomato paste (5oz) and added a little bit of water(another 5 oz) to thin it out.

Quite tasty!  I used the canned, diced tomatoes and tomato paste instead of the soup, and used fat-free milk.  I think I will increase the spices next time, and maybe add more chickpeas and less potatoes.  I did not serve it with rice.

This is a a great recipe,  it's become a staple in my diet since I first made it a couple of months ago.  I also make revisions, using canned stewed tomatoes and coconut milk instead of the soup/cream,  and have played around with the spice combination,  but it's been delicious every time.  I've added peas to it, and I'm going to try it with tofu as suggested in a previous review the next time I make it. 
It's great over a bowl of brown basmati rice too.

Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time I tried an indian recipe and I have to admit that it was very easy and absolutely fabulous.  I followed suggestions from other members by using coconut milk, adding diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup and by adding zucchini or cauliflower instead of potatoes.  Please make sure to serve this with basmati rice instead of regular rice.   Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

I loved this recipe!!!
I used coconut milk intead of cream and halved the amount of curry, cumin and garam masala, so it was mild enough for my kids. I also added sweet potato and zucchini. I served it on basmati rice. Even my 3 yr old loved it!
Thankyou.

Excellent Indian curry!  I made this for dinner last night and my husband rated it a '5' :)

I substituted califlower for the potatoes and used a low sodium tomato soup -- it came out perfect!  I served it on jasmine rice.  

This recipe is a keeper!

This dish is great. I substitute about 3/4 head of cauliflower instead of potatoes. I just steam the cauliflower until tender before adding it in. This dish is well complimented by the "absolutely perfect" palak paneer dish also found on this site.

Pretty good! I would make again, but would double up on one of the three main spices (garam masala, curry, or cumin) to make the flavor more opinionated.  I also substituted the tomato soup with 8oz of tomato sauce and 14oz of diced tomatoes, drained.

Pretty good overall. Not as good as some of the Aloo Phujila recipes on this site, but still flavorful and easy to make. just a few slight changes, used 2 potatoes, 1 sweet potato and a bag of cauliflower. Also used crushed tomatoes instead of soup and used lite coconut milk instead of cream or milk. Nice, easy, tasty dish !!

My husband thought this was ok with sriracha but the 4 kids and I were not fans even though we all normally love these spices. Felt like some flavor was missing although I couldn't really put my finger on what that could be.

This was just ok for me. I added fresh grated ginger and some frozen peas for color. Next time I'll use paneer or cauliflower in place of the potatoes as they just didn't add much to the dish but made up so much of it.

Tried this recipe.  I had no garam masala, so I made a substitute with cumin, paprika, curry powder, crushed cloves and crushed bay leaves from a recipe that that I found online.  I served the dish on a bed of basmati rice.  Delicious!  A little spicy, just the way I like it.  I will be making this again.

I tried this last night. Wow is all I can say. The simplicity and explosion of taste without meat was worth the venture into unknown territory. I made two substitutions: I used tomato juice instead of soup concentrate, and 1 good tablespoon of cream cheese. Great recipe!- Louis

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used the same amount of spices called for in the original recipe, substituting fresh ginger for the powdered ginger. (I added the ginger and the garlic to the sautéing onion during the last two minutes of sauté). I reduced the potatoes to two instead of four. I steamed 10 oz of cauliflower and two carrots and added them to the mix at the same time as the potatoes. I substituted one can of no salt added diced tomatoes and 2 T tomato paste for the tomato soup. I also used 1/2 of a can of lite coconut milk instead of regular milk and added 1/2 cup of frozen peas towards the end of the final

For a healthier take, I omitted the potatoes, used coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and used canned crushed tomatoes because that's what I had in the pantry, and it was delicious!  Great with the bite-sized salmon tikka and basmati rice.  Thanks!

Easy and fast to whip up!  Really tasty but not spicy enough for us ( and I used hot curry).   - We sprinkled hot sauce on it and it was delicious.  Followed the suggestions to use cauliflower and coconut milk.  I will definitely make this again but turn up the heat!!!!

I really wanted to like this recipe, it looked like it was going to be so terrific! Unfortunately it really just tasted like condensed tomato soup to us. I think we need to cultivate our condensed tomato soup tastebuds before I'll attempt this again. Thank you all the same though!

Oh my gosh!!! This is amazing!!! I sub-ed plain greek yogurt in for the sour cream recommended by others to make it creamy, and added 1 can of diced tomatoes in addition to the can of soup. Perfect spice level for me but my partner will need to add as he like XXX hot. I also used baby red potatoes in lieu of regular white potatoes, and a red onion for the yellow...simply based on what I had available.  SOOOOOOO yummy! I’d give 6 stars if I could!

I thought this was great! The only thing I did different was add a touch more half & half for a creamier finish and tossed in some fresh spinach that needed to be used up. Looking at the other ideas it's an incredibly adaptable recipe, thank you for sharing it!

Yummy! Didn't have garam masala on hand so made it from scratch. Think it made the cumin too over powering. Will buy some real spice and try again. Here's what I used for the garam masala:
1/2 tsp cumin 
1/2 tsp paprika 
1/4 tsp cinnamon 
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 
1/4 tsp crumbled bay leaves 
1/8 tsp ground cloves

Amazing dinner! Replaced half of the potatoes with cauliflower to add some veggies. I served over quinoa and it has been a favourite with my family and roommates.

This is a great dish. I don't have garam masala, but it's still tasty. My husband is a big fan of Indian food and whenever this is our evening meal, he is delighted.  I make the Homemade Naan II bread from All Recipes to go with this...perfection!!!

We love indian food....authentic indian. I knew when I read the recipe that it wasn't going to be what we would normally make, but it had great reviews...so I gave it a shot. The taste wasn't too bad, but it was kinda sloppy. Most potato and chick pea curries are more dry, this had a fairly thick, soupy, consistency. Can soup should never go in curry. If you are a curry lover, this recipe will disappoint:(

This was so simple and tasted great. I used sweet potatoes instead of white and tomato paste instead of soup. It was quick to make and pretty fool-proof, a great recipe for a novice to make

It was ok, but the canned tomato soup turned me off.  I also prefer traditional flavors which incorporate coconut milk over regular milk.

Major YUM! Loved it and most of the kids liked it too. I did half potatoes and half cauliflower and have to say the cauliflower was my favorite part! Will experiment like others with crushed tomatoes or sauce to get away from the canned tomato soup, but the recipe is great as it is written.

This is a great, easy recipe that both my husband and I really enjoyed tonight!  I didn't have the condensed soup so instead a used a can of diced tomatoes and about half a small can of tomato paste, which added a nice tangy flavor, as one reviewer already suggested.  I also used coconut milk and only had one large potato but we felt like that was enough.  It's not really spicy so I added a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper for a kick.  Delicious!

This is one of my favorite dishes.  So flavorful and different from what I usually eat.  I'm so glad I was introduced to Garam Masala!  It's my new favorite spice.  I'm going to be making this for a potluck at work.  Hope it goes over well!

Great one! Now a regular in my house. I substitute 1 shredded sweet potato, added in after the spices with a lid, to partly steam it for tenderness.  Even my kids love this one and I've exposed many friends and family to Indian food because of it!

I must admit, I mostly used this recipe for inspiration. I used butter chicken paste from Kitchens of India (which is GREAT) and omitted any extra spices, oil, the soup and the milk. I used half of a yellow onion, a whole can of chickpeas, and about 6 red potatoes cut up. DELICIOUS.

Good flavor, but very thick, more like mashed potatoes. Next time, used canned tomatoes instead of tomato soup. Also, try it with cauliflower instead of potatoes, for a lower calorie/healthier dish.

This is the first Indian dish I've made at home that has come close to tasting like anything my Indian friends make.  Very easy!  The spices were blended perfectly. Was able to adjust spiciness by adding a 1/4 tsp. of each spice until it suited us.   Had half & half on hand, not cream but it seemed to work fine.  Also added some frozen peas in for color.  This is one of those better the next day sort of dishes and it freezes well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I really liked this simple curry recipe. I did as a few other reviewers had suggested and used plain yogurt and tomato sauce. Great recipe, I will try again using cauliflower.

I've cooked a great deal of Indian dishes and this one is quick, easy and tasty.  Based on previous experience (and preference) I subbed the condensed soup for diced tomatoes, used coconut milk as I had it on hand and fresh ginger.  I doubled the recipe with no problems.  My Mother / Father inlaw and 2 year old twin boys all ate it - no problem with heat (and my Mother inlaw is quite sensitive to heat, which is why I chose this recipe as no chilies are required).  For those who like a little heat, add some green chilies and for those looking to add extra veggies, cauliflower, zucchini, spinach & sweet potatoes all work well in this dish.  We serve over basmati rice and serve with naan bread.  Will add this to my Indian recipe repertoire.  Enjoy:)

Flavor combination was very good with the spices. I added sweet potato and cauliflower like other reviews recommended, but the texture of chickpeas out of the can were a little too hard, I maybe should've cooked them longer so they were softer.

Instead of the soup, use one small (6 oz.) can of tomato paste.  Add it to your boiled potato water.  Adjust seasonings as needed.

While this recipe was very easy to make, I found the end result to be kind of bland. I think it could benefit from an additonal ingredient that's more flavorful than potatoes and chickpeas. Maybe peas?

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used 1/2 cup light sour cream instead of cream as the recipe called for. Also, I did not use condensed tomato soup because I didn't have any. Instead I had 3/4 can tomato sauce. Cooked for a little longer to bring out the flavours. Will definitely make again, but will add something to give it a little more heat. Thanks!

This was really good!!!  I followed it exactly and it turned out great.  I'm not a big fan of cooking with canned soup, but this one worked.  And it was totally simple to make.  Tasted even better next day for lunch.  It was actually less spicy the next day for some reason.  I'm keeping this in my recipe file.

Ok, so I can't give this recipe a fair shake. I changed a lot of aspects trying to "lighten" it up a little.
I doubled the recipe in hopes of having left overs for the next few days. I used 4 red potatoes and a small head of cauliflower. I doubled the seasonings and this is where I think it went wrong. I am unfamiliar with Garam Masala and while it has a wonderful flavor, doubling in made it too pungent! Also, instead of using tomato soup I used one 15 oz. can tomato sauce and one 15 oz. can no-salt-added diced tomatoes. Yet another mistake!... I didn't take into account that pure tomato sauce and tomatoes don't have all the flavorings the soup would have had to counter the seasonings. Instead of milk/cream, I used fat-free plain yogurt and just a splash of 1% milk. Followed all preparations according to directions.
The way mine turned out was overpowering. This was MY mistake and not the recipes. I would love to try this again but I know next time to watch what I do with those seasonings!!! The cauliflower was a fantastic addition, next time I will probably completely omit the potatoes and use all cauliflower! This recipe has wonderful potential and I will probably do it all the same except for doubling those spices!

Great easy recipe. I didn't add salt, and cut the garam masala down (i find it too cinnamony.) Defiitely needs something stronger than skim milk, but that's my fault. Will do again.

I have tried multiple curry seasoning types in an attempt to make a good Indian vegetable curry.  This is the best I have tried. I will definitely make this again.  I used all spices an sauce ingredients as listed, but added a variety of vegetables that I just happened to have on hand.  It is an excellent building block recipe to be used with any vegetables you prefer.  Thanks very much for this keeper!

I substituted the tomato soup and milk with tomato sauce and coconut milk and used cauliflower instead of potatoes. The mix of spices in this recipe are perfect.  Served it with Indian Chapati Bread by INSHA87.  Yummy!!!

Wow! This was so flavorful, I had a hard time stopping eating it.  I found this recipe at the last minutes and discovered I had no potatoes or cauliflower, so I used sweet potato and broccoli.  Had no tomato soup or canned tomatoes, so I had to use a can of tomato sauce.  I went a little heavier on the garam masala and cumin. I also substituted greek yogurt for the milk.  What a fantastic aroma!

I've never made curry before, and this was so easy!  I did make some of the recommended changes.  I used 3 potatoes, added crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and upped the curry slightly.
I also cooked the spices in oil before adding the onion, added water and let it simmer for 20 or so minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Overall, pretty good.  My husband raved about it.  My kids thought it was not so great.  I did not love the condensed tomato soup.  I think I will use diced tomatoes and tomato sauce next time.  I used coconut milk.  I will also try with cauliflower instead of potatoes as others have suggested.

Didn't have tomato soup, so I used crushed tomatoes.  Also didn't have garam masala, so I just left it out.  Cooked spices in oil for about 10mins, was told that cooking for long time in oil is secret to good curries.

I followed several reviewers' suggestions. I used fresh ginger (sauteed with the onions and garlic), yogurt (homemade) instead of milk, and I used tomatoes instead of tomato soup (I freeze tomatoes from my garden to use in stews and recipes such as this). I also added some extra curry (can't get too much of a good thing). Great recipe!

Squanto liked it very much. Very good intro to curry. Squanto also made his own garam masala and curry powder by the allrecipes directions.  But he thought the recipe was a bit high in cumin, so did not put the full teaspoon as this recipe requested.  Squanto added more garlic too, and used sour cream and low-fat milk combo with tomato sauce, it really helped. Great recipe the spices are not HOT spicy but spicy goooood.

Wow- Yummy!  I try not to use canned products, so I used 1/2 cup dried garbonzo beans and cooked them completely, then followed the rest of the directions.  I used 10 oz of pureed tomato in place of the tomato soup, butter instead of oil and half and half for the cream/milk.  I used buttercream potatoes and left the skins on along with about a half a cup of cauliflower.  Very rich and delicious. Spices are perfect.  The adults in the house really liked this curry, but the kids (ages 14 years old and 2 years old) did not.

We love this curry. However, I don't like potatoes unless they are mashed, so I chop and cook a head of cauliflower in its place. I also use minced fresh ginger instead of powdered, and instead of tomato soup, I use tomato past thinned with coconut milk.  I also add a cup of thawed green peas, and  serve the dish over rice. YUMMY!

oh my - i made this recipe a couple nights ago and it was yummy! we served this on top of rice with naan and i thought i was in heaven. i would say that you could probably use less potatoes (maybe two and a half or three). using four potatoes soaked up most of the sauce, but still so good!

Very flavorful.  I opted to use a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and pureed them in the food processor with 1 serrano chile instead of the tomato soup to keep the dish inline with Indian cuisine.  I used the exact amount of spices and I completely forgot that my curry powder is exceptionally spicy so next time I will reduce the curry powder to 1 tsp instead of 2.  I also nixed the heavy cream in order to keep the dish lower in calories and fat and opted to spoon plain yogurt on top of the dish when serving to cut back the heat of the dish a little.  My 5, 4, and 2 year old loved it as well as my husband and I.  I will definitely be making this dish again!

I followed the recipe as written except substituted steamed cauliflower for the potatoes. But the spice mixture was off for us- I was hoping for a flavor like a dish we have at our favorite Indian restaurant, but this wasn't it. It was tasty and my husband still had 2 helpings. Served with basmati rice.

When I saw that this recipe used canned tomato soup I just had to try it, because I love cooking with canned soup. It's my one guilty habit in my effort to be more green and use mainly fresh organic ingredients! This recipe was very tasty. I  substituted cauliflower and used fat free half and half. I also minced an inch of fresh ginger with the garlic instead of using powder. Will defintely make it again.

I had to double my spices to get a decent flavor in this. It was very bland but once the extra spices were added it was okay.

delicious!!  due to food allergies I had to substitute tomato sauce for the soup and coconut milk for the cream.  cauliflower works well as a sub for the potatoes, but either way it is very good.

We had to make the garam masala from scratch using other spices, and we substituted the tomato soup with tomato sauce and tomato paste. We also used coconut milk instead of cream to make the meal vegan. This might just be the most delicious meal I have ever made!

This was an excellent recipe! I had to make some alterations because I didn't have everything that it asked for. I didn't have curry powder so just left it out. I also didn't have condensed tomato soup, so used some tomato sauce, and instead of cream/milk I used coconut milk. It was absolutely delicious. Tasted great with sweet baked potato on the side. Next time will put it in instead of potatoes!

It was ok...definitely did not have the traditional indian taste, but good for beginners. If you want a more authentic taste, supplement the tomato soup for diced tomatoes (fresh or canned).

This was good and very easy.  I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, but this had just enough spice.  My only complaint is that it needed more sauce!  I added a can of tomato sauce and a teaspoon of sugar instead of the soup, as the recipe called for.

A little bland for my liking but the kids actually tried it and cleaned their plates and agreed to take some leftovers in their school lunch. I used coconut milk instead of cream, because I thought it would give it a nicer flavour. I think next time I will use canned tomatoes instead of soup...there is something I don't like about cooking with canned soup. I will make it again though.

Fantastic recipe! I did have to add a little extra cream (about a 1/3 cup) because the tomato puree I used must have been salted (I'm overseas and Campbell's is just not a standard here). Also, I went with all cauliflower because I had a different dish with potatoes in it already.

This was good, but I didn't think it was great. It was easy to make so that's a plus; I even had my two year old helping me wash potatoes and rinse chickpeas. I was looking for a deeper flavor, not sure what was missing. I'll try some of the other chickpea curries and do some comparison.

Excellent!  I have made a few tweaks based on the recomendations of other reviewers: coconut milk for cream,  diced tomatoes for tomato soup,  cauliflower for potatoes,  added peas during the last few minutes for color.  Chix is optional. A keeper!

Really great, but definately needs to meld flavours overnight or all you can taste is tomato soup.  Good fibre and so easy to make.

This was amazing! I eliminated the cumin, because I've been a little sick of that spice lately. I also switched to a red onion, which really complimented the dish. My husband has always been suspicious of trying Indian food, he's more of a meat and potatoes guy, but he really enjoyed it as well. I will definitely make this again and again.

Thanks for the great recipe.  Even my picky 2- and 4- year olds enjoyed this.  My husband isn't a fan of potatoes, so I used only 2 potatoes, I added a second can of chickpeas (one just didn't look like enough for my chickpea loving family), I substituted @ 1/2 can cocout milk for the cream, and @ 6oz tomato sauce for the soup. (condensed soup has so many unhealthy ingredients).  I also substituted pureed "fresh" ginger for the powdered stuff.  It was awesome, DH gave it an A+ and said he can't wait to have it again.  Yum!

This was good, and very easy. I made it as the recipe states and it was very bland though - I more than doubled the amount of spices, and had to add more garlic too. Once I added more spice it was good. Also - I followed the recipe, and it definitely made more than 4 servings! Not that I'm complaining...

I fiddled around with the seasonings a bit, plus I threw in some cauliflower florets that needed using up. I also didn't bother pre-cooking the potatoes - just diced them into small cubes, browned them in the oil along with the onion and garlic, then simmered everything for about 30 mins until they were done. If I were to make this again, I would omit the tomato soup, and use tomato paste and water instead - the soup made it too sweet for me. It still turned out good though - don't forget to sprinkle on some fresh cilantro. Good stuff! Thanks!

This is an amazing recipe. I saved time (and eliminated a pot to wash) by cubing the raw potato and microwaving them with a little bit of water for 7 minutes, while preparing the rest of the recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again! I'm glad we had leftovers for me to take for lunch, as my coworkers ooo'd and ahh'd at the smell of my lunch (some tasted it), and I printed the recipe to share with 5. Thanks so much for a great, easy recipe!

My family and I loved this recipe. I doubled the recipe but did a few changes: Used olive oil and a bit less than what the original recipe calls for; substituted milk for coconut milk (because I had it and wanted to use it), and added a chopped apple. It was really  nice... I have to say that I'm sure this recipe would have been equally nice just as originally written. Next time I will follow it to the tee.

Delicious, easy and convenient.    I made a few changes. I used 2 extra teaspoons of curry and no masala.  I replaced half of the potatoes with cauliflower.  I also added some green peas for color.  This is a very versatile recipe.  You could make it using a bean and/or tofu combination for an easy vegetarian main dish.

delicious curried chickpea dish.  Just the right amount of spice.  Like others suggested I used plain yogurt in place of the milk/cream and it was great.

This is really really yummy.  The only thing I did differently was to add a teaspoon of cayenne.  The curry sauce could be used for other dishes.  My husband is a big meat eater, so I think I would add chicken and omit the potatoes, and serve it over rice.

This was pretty good and tasted very similar to our favorite Indian restaurant.  Per others suggestions, I used crushed tomatoes (I do not like canned tomato soup) and cauliflower.  Next time, will halve the amount of spices as the flavor was a little strong for our taste (and I like things spicy). Raisins and/or cashews would be a great addition.

This was very good. I did a few modifications based on what I had in my pantry- a can of tomato sauce instead of the soup- and 1/2 C of lite coconut milk instead  of the cream. I also put the spices in straight away with the onion and garlic to allow them cook a little longer. I also used cauliflower instead of potatos because I was serving with rice. I really great flavor in this dish. I will definately make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used half the potatoes and half cauliflower as other viewers suggested, but I think next time I will use all cauliflower because I liked the contrast of the cauliflower with the chickpeas.  Also, I hate tomatoe soup, but it tasted nothing like it in the recipe. A very good meal that smells and tastes great.

Delicious. We didn't change a thing about this recipe and it came out perfect. We'll be making this again soon! One question though: Why is it called Butter Chickpea Curry when there's no butter in it?

I ALWAYS make the recipe as written the first time. Although some of the suggestions sound very good, esp coconut milk, this is a great recipe as is. My kids and I loved it! I would add more spice next time and maybe some green peas or chicken but as it is this is a definite keeper.

A delicious delicious recipe and SUPER easy and quick.  We followed it as directed, using half and half for the "cream or milk".  The house smelled just like an Indian restaraunt!  Tasted great over rice.  We'll definitely make this recipe again.

Nice vegetarian dish...I may add a little more spice next time.  Several  other reviewers suggested using cocount milk but I didn't have any on hand so I decided to make my own by adding 1/2 tsp. coconut extract to the 1/2 c. milk and it worked great!  Served this dish over rice with Naan and Cucumber Raita on the side.  The coolness of the cucumbers balanced out the spiciness of the curry quite nicely.  :)

I would classify my first attempt as a success! I took most of the suggestions here...substituted sweet potato and cauliflower...used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup...used coconut milk instead of cream/reg milk...used a wee bit more spice than called for, esp. cumin...added some sriracha, also some peas/carrots...served over some jasmine rice...delicious and nutritious!  and let me say this...if I can do it...anyone can ;-)

You know, I really have yet to find a curry recipe that brought decent results - but this one really did.  I used diced tomatoes with jalapenos since we like our food spicy (and since it was what I had) but I did add a tablespoon or so of sugar to counteract the acidity, since Indian "Butter" anything is normally a bit sweetish.  I added a handful of french-cut green beans.  All in all, very tasty!  (Also, I used the "Easy Garam Masala" recipe from this site, and that worked much, much better than I expected!)

This is a good recipe and easy to make.  Not great enough to serve to company but a good healthy dinner to throw together with a salad and crusty bread or brown jasmine rice.  I substituted cauliflower for potatoes to make it even healthier.  The curry flavors are strong enough that you really can't taste the difference.  Another plus, it used up a lot of ingredients that have been sitting around gathering dust in the pantry. :)

Absolutely fabulous!  This is the first time I have made an Indian dish that tastes the way it does at our favorite Indian restaurant.  I ran out of cumin so I had to omit that and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the soup.

This was quite good.  My husband did not care for the fact that it was sans meat.  The sauce however is very good and leaves alot of option for future variations...with meat.

This was good, but not as good as I had hoped.  I didn't read the suggestions from other cooks though and next time I'll use crushed tomatoes instead of the soup.

I had cooked chickpeas that I had to use up  so I thought I'd try this recipe. It turned out delicious, I sprinkled in some red pepper flakes as my husband likes a bit of kick and it was a huge hit!

Awesome recipe!  I added half a can more of tomato soup and cooked some cut-up chicken tenders and added them at the end.  Also, I served with basmati rice.  Even my 8-year-old ate it!  Yum!

Loved it!  I didn't have the soup on hand, so I used tomato paste and it worked like a charm.  Definitely will make this again!  Thanks for posting it.

I absolutely loved this recipe (didn't change a thing) & even my children liked it. It's so flavorful! I served it with some white rice so it was a quick & easy meal, but not sacrificing taste or quality. Thank you!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and substituted 1 can crushed tomatoes for the tomato soup.  I also would like to try subbing coconut milk for the cream as I think that would be a very nice change (it's very good with cream also, though).  Lastly, to keep the meal low-GI, I substituted steamed cauliflower for the potatoes.  We made this last night for dinner and it was REALLY good then and I expect the leftovers today to be even MORE flavorful.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Tomato soup in a curry just doesn't sound right to me. Having said that I've eaten Buttered Chicken in an Indian shop that tasted a lot like tomato soup. So what do I know?  I used tomato sauce and coconut milk and threw in some lentils, spinach and peas. Served with basmati rice but really didn't need the rice. The lentils were plenty.

I love this recipe!  I tried it last night and it was fantastic!  The spice blend is nice, the use of tomato soup is perfect, and the cooking time is no fuss!  Like others, I used coconut milk instead and also needed an extra kick of spice, so half a tablespoon of Sriracha Chili Sauce did the trick.  You can basically use this for any main ingredient you want.  I used sweet potatoes and eggplant.  Delicious!

This was really good, but too mild for me.  I upped the spices by 50%, but still ended up adding a 4 oz. can of hot green chili peppers (not Jalapeno, they are the Ortega brand of hot green chilis -- not mild).  I didn't have any cream in the house, so I added 1/2 a stick of butter with some low-fat milk, and that was really good.  All in all, the flavors were excellent.  This is a keeper.  Thank you!!

Yum, this was good! Four stars and not five because I did make some changes to it, based on other reviews. I used lite coconut milk in place of regular milk, as well as a can of diced tomatoes and a few TBS of tomato paste in place of the condensed soup. I also used fresh ginger instead of the powdered ginger, and used 2 potatos, a handful of baby carrots (cooked with the potatos), and threw in some sliced crookneck squash that I had in my fridge (that I just put in when I added the potato/carrot mix to the sauce). 

I also made the Indian green beans recipe from this site and got some naan for dipping. (If you have a Trader Joe's nearby, they have a really delicious Tandoori/Garam Masala flavored naan that's perfect to accompany this curry!)

Definitely cook up some extra rice for the leftovers--I can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow!

Can I just start with this preface...I don't cook, I bought all the spices and ingredients just for this dish...and cooking makes me nervous.   But I eat out at Indian restaurants a lot.  This curry was extremely delicious!  I couldn't believe that I could pull it off.   Restaurant grade for sure.  Impressed all my friends.  thank you!

Took the advice of others and added carrots to the potatoes while they were boiling. I also opted to boil the vegetables in veggie broth as opposed to water. Made for very tasty potatoes. Guests were enamored with the dish. Served over a bed of rice mixed with raisins. Thanks for a marvelous recipe. I will use again and again.

Real good! Following the advice of other reviewers, I subbed carrots for 1/2 the potatoes; used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup; and coconut milk in place of cream or milk. I added about a cup of frozen peas and doubled the spices. Turned out great!

Excellent flavor, easy to make! I would suggest adding something with color since everything other than the sauce is white - rice, onions, potatoes, chickpeas. My husband requested adding cashews for more texture and currants for sweetness/color. Great recipe!

Wow! So simple and so good. I didn't have any milk so I substituted yogurt and I liked the slight sourness it gave the dish. I'm not usually that crazy about chickpeas but they were really good with this yummy sauce.

This is ok - certainly tasty and went down well but a bit too tomatoey for my taste.

I added 4 medium strength chilies to it to give it a bit more kick.

Next time I'll probably use passata rather than tomato soup and some more onions to thicken

This turned out great. I used a small can of tomato paste and two or three of water in place of soup, and fiddled with the spices since I didn't have garam masala, using some cumin and cinnamon, a little black pepper, cayenne pepper, dash of vinegar, couple tbsp honey, even a few saffron threads. Obviously I'm comfortable winging it. Next time I might try adding some cauliflower and carrots. I considered running to the store to get TOFU -- it would have gone beautifully in this.

Yum! I made this last night, with a few changes, and it was excellent. I only used two potatoes but added cauliflower, as some others had suggested here. Also, I don't like onions, so instead I chopped up an apple and sauteed it along with the spices. Great substitute -- the apple brought out the flavor of the spices and added a nice hint of sweetness. I used Progresso Hearty Tomato soup, which has lots of salt in it already, so I omitted the additional teaspoon of salt. This dish tastes great and is pretty easy to make -- I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good and forgiving recipe.  I used a can of diced tomates that I pureed with my stick mixer.  I also used two big spoons of sour cream (I'm sure it was between 1/4 and 1/2 cup) as opposed to milk/cream.  I didnt have all the spices, instead I used an extra tsp of curry (3 total), 1 tsp of all-spice, the cumin, salt and ground pepper.  Make sure you give the spices all the time with the onions over the heat, you'll be rewarded later. Very good!

Fab recipe.  So Simple to make and tastes absolutely delicious.  Is as nice with Naan bread as it is with rice!

This was delicious! I used organic tomato sauce (any tomato sauce would do) instead of the soup...(soups usually have too much sodium) I also added some fresh tomatoes from the garden. Great recipe! I will definitely make this again!

What a thrill to be able to make something that tastes like I ordered it in a restaraunt!!  This recipe has everything going for it--Quick, easy and very very tasty as well as being vegetarian and boosting the bean quotient.  I've also shared with sevreral friends who are just as enthusiastic about it as I am.

This is terrific!  A lot of flavor and not too spicy, although it has some bite.  I used 2 large potatoes instead of 4 medium and the proportion seemed right.

I bought cauliflower to add (as recommended by another reviewer) and it's a good thing I did, because it turned out I didn't have a can of chickpeas in the cupboard like I'd thought! I also ended up using a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup. But even without the chickpeas, the curry was fantastic. There's a bit of a kick but it's not too spicy, and the flavor is surprisingly complex. I really enjoyed this dish and will be making it again and again!

Very yummy and very simple.  A great dish for vegetarians.  I added more cream as I like a lot of sauce and 1 tsp of dark sugar to add a bit of sweetness.  Excellent and very quick and easy.  Great for the whole family.

update on old review: made recipe exactly as stated except substituted potato for double chickpeas and I loved the creamy flavor the tomato soup added and the fact that it didn't take so long to cook potatoes to put in.  Sooo good!

I did it without any changes just to see how it was and it was pretty good. I think I'd like it saucier so next time I may up the cream and tomato soup. I served it over rice and it tasted good!

Really loved this one :D Made it a bit more heart healthy by:
1)omitted the oil, you can use water to loosen up the onions!
2)used mini potatoes and quartered them, in addition used up some cauliflower
3)Omitted the salt in the spice mix because I always add salt at the end. Turns out the salt from the canned tomato soup was enough. Trust me on this one.
4)Reduce the sauce before adding everything in to condense the wonderful flavours!
5)added everything else, including two handfuls of spinach!

Really good. Use 50/50 cauliflower and potato, diced tomatoes and a splash of milk. Just enough spice. Would definitely make again.

I'm really baffled at all the good reviews for this. I followed it almost to a tee except I used fresh garlic instead of powdered and dried chickpeas instead of canned. Bland! I doubled the spices and it was better but still just okay. The canned tomato soup is probably the biggest culprit in this recipe, it's such a one-note flavor that it seemed to override everything else. My husband wouldn't even finish his serving which happens about twice a year. I found it edible at best.

I added 1.5 of recommended spices and still found this recipe to be a bit bland, although my family does love spice! I also added cayenne pepper to give it a kick. Would recommend boiling the potatoes until they are still firm and tossing them in with the sauce so they soak up more of the flavors. Over all, good recipe. Will make again with more spice!

This was absolutely delicious, I made just a couple of changes,  Quadruple the chickpeas and leave out the potatoes altogether, just use 1 1/4 cup of tomato puree instead of soup. I served this over Basmati rice and it was a hit.

I was in an Indian cuisine mood so, when I got online, I found this recipe to be simple. I went to the grocer, bought my missing spices and fresh onions and made it as instructed. It was as good as I imagine it! I served it with jasmine rice. I can’t wait to have this again and maybe next time modify with the great alternatives from the other reviewers. It’s chickpea curry heaven!

I've made this dish several times and it's a solid base that's very forgiving.  I've actually merged about three different curry recipes to get it how my family really likes it. I use coconut oil to first cook onion and garlic, then add double the amount of spices listed above and cook them for at least five minutes. Then I add a large can of (drained) diced tomatoes, a small can of coconut milk, cooked potatoes, cauliflower, and chickpeas. When done, squeeze a lime on top before mixing and serving over basmati rice. I also serve with naan and a small side salad. Perfection!

This recipe is amazing. The flavor is so authentic that it's like eating at an Indian restaurant. We don't find condensed tomato soup where I live so I made it by blending a can of diced tomatoes, 2 tbsps of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of cornstarch and 1/2 tsp of salt. It turned out perfect.

Great and easy recipe! I doubled up on the spices, halved the salt and added 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup. I will make this again and again! I gave 4 stars only because i changed the recipe.

A-ma-zing!  Better than any Indian Restaurant dish I've had yet, this was lick your plate that good!  I used 4 medium sized sweet potatoes (adds a nice sweetness) in place of regular and used Silk Vanilla almond milk instead of cream.  I also used a can of Heinz tomato soup, 1 tsp of sea salt for the salt and 2 large cloves of garlic minced.  Everything else I did as the recipe states and it turned out fantastic.  My house smells so amazing, I can't  wait for my leftovers!!  I have to admit, the thought of the tomato soup in this kind of turned me off at first but wow, the end result is incredible!  Thank you for sharing this, it's a winner that I will be making again and again!!

This was a good quick dinner, but certainly not the best curry I've ever had.  I doubled the spices and used fresh ginger instead of powdered.  The tomato soup worked better than I would have expected, but this is a very dry curry.  I thinned it out with a bit of vegetable stock and used yogurt in place of milk / cream.  It still didn't have much flavor, so next time I will add more spice (some ground coriander and more cumin) and more salt.  I would also use ghee instead of oil.  All in all, for the effort, not bad, very filling, and a good starting point.

I didn't change anything except to cut the curry and garam masala a bit to lessen the heat.  Recipe was easy and quick with ingredients I always have on hand and tasted comparable to a dish I've had in an Indian restaurant.  A winner!

I made it exactly as written and it was under spiced. If you want something with a kick (which curry recipes are usually supposed to provide) then I would double the seasoning. It was good after I did just that.

Edit: Just realized that the creator mentions in the recipe that the maker should "control the spice" so I upped the score.

Slight modification but very tasty seasoning. I used a half can of tomato paste with coconut milk because that is what I had on hand.

I started out making this exactly as written, but did end up adding an additional 1/2 cup of milk because the finished recipe was so salty (and this from someone who uses a lot of salt).  It's still a bit too salty, but I think it will be fine once it's put over rice.

Next time I'll omit the salt and add it to taste. I'd like to try using coconut milk instead of the cream/milk instead, too.  I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for a yummy recipe!

Made this for dinner last night. It was good, except I think the potatoes either should be omitted, or specified to use waxy ones (like Yukon golds) because I used baking potatoes and they kind of soak up a lot of the moisture, so they felt extraneous in this dish. I didn't use any salt, it didn't need it with the two spice mixes. I added a cup of green peas. If I made this again, I would maybe use some cut up bell peppers as well - the sweetness would balance out the spice.

I've made this several times, and always use cauliflower instead of potatoes.  I use Vanilla yogurt because its what I have on hand, instead of cream.  Love this dish, you can play with the spices however you like.Its great served over brown rice with naan bread.

Not enough flavor for our family.  Hoping its better as leftovers.  

We used diced tomatoes instead of soup.
Coconut cream instead of milk.
Added peas (one of us added peanut butter which helped a lil)

A nice indian recipe. You can just cook the potatoes in the microwave while you're prepping the other stuff, makes your life even easier. I added peas for some colour, and it tasted great. Also no need to add that salt to the spice mix, most canned soups are plenty salty on its own.

Delicious...So glad I stumbled upon this recipe..I didn't have tomato soup so I mixed up a can of tomato paste in the specified amount of water and used almond milk instead of cream and it was still delicious. Will definitely be throwing this recipe into my rotation. Thanks!

My husband liked this, but found this too carby as we had this over rice with naan (potatoes, rice, bread). You could serve it without rice or naan, but it won't taste the same. At any rate, I discovered I still hate chickpeas, so I can't really rate it honestly, but am giving it a 4 based on DH's eating all the leftovers voluntarily - even though there was no naan left. Thanks for sharing! (P.S. I used a can of crushed tomatoes - 15 oz, and fat free plain yogurt, non-Greek.)

I loved this recipe. I used some frozen Christmas turkey in place of potato and opted to use cream this time as I was feeling indulgent. In the future, I'd probably use coconut milk or non-fat plain yogurt but the cream was absolutely delicious. Might try it with cauliflower next time, although the turkey made for a nice main dish. Easy preparation and clean-up, easy to adapt to suit your taste. Awesome!

I was cleaning out my cupboard and found a lot of chickpeas.  I tried this recipe only because I had all the ingredients already (I made a substitute for the garam masala with ingredients I had).  I had no idea such an easy recipe could be SO DELICIOUS!!!  I love Indian cuisine, but never really tried to make it myself.  If I had known this fantastic curry recipe was so good, I would have been making it for years!!  In a word - WOW!

This was pretty good. I didn't have chickpeas, so I steamed some cauliflower and carrots and threw those in. I substituted sweet potatoes for regular. I also used 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of the cream, as recommended by another user. I will say, for my kiddos, the 2 teaspoons of Curry was a bit much. I liked it myself, but will probably cut it back to 1 next time.

I thought this was very tasty.  I only made minor changes (i.e. red potatoes, white onion, 1/2 can coconut milk, and fresh ginger) and it came out very well.  My only suggestion would be to boil your own chickpeas instead of buying a can.  Boiling them yourself tastes better anyways :)

It was too thick, too creamy, and too bland.  It was definitely lacking in spices.  I doubled the garam masala, curry, and cumin to make it edible.  Did not double the ginger.  I will not make this recipe again and will create my own.

I was looking for a a good, simple vegetable curry/korma recipe after having it for the first time on a cruise ship and falling in love with it.  I decided to try this recipe as I had most of the ingredients on hand, and I just adjusted it to what I had.  I omitted the garam masala and ground ginger as I did not have any and instead added extra curry powder, I only used 2 potatoes, and  added half a can of canned carrots and a small can of peas.  It was SO DELICIOUS over rice, I will definitely be making this again!!

Very good. Followed peoples suggestions. I used cauliflower instead of potatoes. I also used diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup. I also added gresh ginger (instead of dried spice) and added 2 cloves of garlic. I did 1/2 hot curry and 1/2 curry. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. When the flavors can develop even more. My husband added siracha to his to really kick up the heat.

I made this last night and I don't know what I could have done wrong as this was a super simple recipe, but I didn't think much of this.  It was missing something.  Maybe I should have used coconut milk in stead of regular milk.  And I had to use a lot of extra milk.  I don't think I would make this again.

Very yummy =) A really good option for when I don't have a lot in the fridge, since pretty much all the ingredients are things I have in my pantry. Not too much work either - not a lot of chopping compared to most vegetarian recipes I've made! I did adjust it a bit but nothing major, would be a great recipe as written!

Changes: I started by simmering the spices in oil, so they got nice and fragrant. I also added the boiled potatoes early on (before the liquid ingredients) so they disintegrated a bit and made the sauce nice and thick! In fact I had to add a bit of water afterwards to make it saucy again, oops! But I liked the texture that way. I used a bit of minced ginger instead of powdered; I subbed crushed tomatoes for the soup; and I added a touch of lemon juice, sugar, and cayenne for kick. I agree that tomato soup wouldn't be as nice as actual tomatoes. I did find I had to add extra spices, but I think that was my fault 'cause the potatoes soaked a lot up at the beginning. Tasted fabulous!

This is what I've been looking for! Instead of condensed tomato soup (which I never buy), I used a cup of mild home-made salsa. I also used plain non-fat yogurt instead of milk. The result is perfectly spicy. A keeper!

My family LOVES this recipe! It's one they request when coming home from college. I've swapped out some of the potatoes for cauliflower or carrots, and it still tastes great. Also I like using coconut milk in place of the cream, but have also used plain milk. This is a very versatile, tasty curry!

When I tasted  the dish after cooking it, it tasted too much like tomato soup...however, after letting it sit for a few hours, it tasted MUCH BETTER! I recommend this recipe, I didn't have enough milk, so along with the tomato soup i added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup coconut milk. This is also very mild, so if you like spicey, then you may want to add a spoon of chilli too. I am going to use this to make butter chicken as well.

It was fairly simple to make but I was really disappointed with the dish.  I've had chickpea curries in Indian restaurants that I've loved, but this didn't taste anything like them.  It wasn't a great combination of flavors.

Very good recipe.  I wanted to educate my father's tastebuds to appreciate curry so I tried this recipe.  He REALLY liked it so it is now a family favourite! :-)

I love this dish!  I love Indian spices that are brought together in a creamy mild dish and that is what this recipe delivers.  I did use only half measured amounts of the spices (but use 3/4 of curry and 1 tsp salt), heavy whipping cream, half a med onion and tomato bisque condensed soup.  My husband was so impressed! I can't wait to eat the leftover tomorrow!

I really enjoyed this curry!  I used one piece of chicken to replace one of the potatoes and increased the spices a bit.  Yum!

This is such a great, easy recipe! It tastes delicious and it only took me half an hour to make. Even when I make enough for leftovers, my family and I eat the entire pan of food!

Easy and versatile. My masala spice went missing and I was able to make up a batch out of other spices I had, I added a block of frozen spinach to the recipe, and used stewed tomatos and tomato paste, and a sprinkling of sugar since I wasn't using the soup which would have had sugar in it,  and nearly tripled the whole thing for plenty of leftovers. I had brown rice for me and white rice for the family. Served it with grilled chicken legs. Maybe next time I'll throw some chicken right into the curry. You really could do anything with this.

I was surprised to realize I've been using this recipe, with assorted variations, for a couple of years now, so I figured I'd put my two cents in about how good and versatile it is. 

I've made it exactly as written, added things like peas, cauliflower, chicken and shrimp, subbed crushed tomatoes and/or coconut milk, and it always comes out great. I neither know nor care whether it's authentic; what matters is, it's a good, filling, inexpensive, delicious meal that refrigerates and freezes well so I can enjoy it for days on end. WIN.

This is more like a masala than a curry, I think, but it was delicious! I subbed 8 oz. tomato sauce for the cond. soup, and coconut milk for the cream. Not too spicy, so the kids could handle it. Definitely making this again!

awesome basic curry, lots of variations come to mind now that I made it once. definitely cut down the potatoes if you shop at standard grocery stores that feature monstrous sized specimens in the produce dept. and you like to have a little sauce left over after mixing everything together.

Delicious, thanks!  Used coconut milk + a little half and half. For the soup I used home canned tomatoes, a bouillon cube, and a teaspoon of sugar. Had to use cauliflower (had no chick peas).  The potatoes thicken it nicely.   It's not a runny curry, more of a clingy one.  As others have said, cooking the spices for several minutes first is important and storing it overnight if possible is even better.

Really loved this recipe. I tweaked it a bit it to suit my taste : substituted the cream/milk with coconut milk, and added a bit of water as the sauce was way too thick for my taste. But all in all, yummy yummy.

Great recipe. I use it once a week. I've adjusted the recipe to suit my young family's taste as follows: I use butter instead of oil & can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup & leave out the ground ginger. It's a keeper for us!

This makes a LOT--- more like 6 servings than 4.  May tone down the spice level next time I make it- it wasn't that it was too hit, the spice just seemed to be overpowering, if that makes sense.  Served it with the "naan" recipe on this site and it tasted great.

This was awesome!!  I didn't want to mess with cooking the potatoes separately, so I cut up broccoli and added that instead.  I doubled the amount of chickpeas and added some water to make more sauce, then let it simmer til it reduced a little. Wonderful!  I'll be adding this to my regular rotation!!

As written, I found this to be quite bland. I added an extra teaspoon of each spice (except the ginger) and I still wasn't satisfied. I do think using tomato sauce instead of soup makes a difference, and I added some coconut milk to add extra flavour. Might be nice with some extra veggies, or letting it sit in the fridge to let the flavour come out.

Fantastic, easy recipe! I made a few changes, but I don't think it made a difference: omitted potatoes and added broccoli and red and yellow bell peppers to make a veggie curry. I didn't have tomato soup or diced tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce. Also, I used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of cream/milk. But the portions of the seasonings are perfect! Even with my healthy substitutions, the flavor is definitely there!

This is so good!  I used crushed tomatoes, half and half, and accidentally put in 2 t of cumin instead of one.  It all worked out great, though.  I added 2 chopped chicken breasts so I decreased the potatoes to 2.  I'm serving it with basmati rice and I will definitely be making it again.  It tastes creamy and spicy - not hot, but spicy.  Just perfect.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight because I needed to make a quick meal and had everything I needed in my fridge and cupboards. I omitted the garam masala because I didn't have any here and pureed some canned tomatoes instead of using tomato soup because that is what I had on hand. I never use onions because my husband is allergic. This was a delicious and incredibly simple meal to make and I will definitely make it again - next time for friends!

A quick and tasty dinner.  I used real ginger in place of powdered.  I think that always lifts the taste. Just had it as a stew as I don't put potatoes and rice together.  Next time I will try it with cauliflower and serve in over rice.

I followed the recipe exactly because this was my first time making/tasting curry.  I'm pretty sure it's my 'blue collar' roots but this was just "ok" to me.

This recipe is delicious, though I did make a few changes to pack in a few more vitamins.  Instead of 4 potatoes, I used 1 large potato and 1 sweet potato, quartered and boiled them as directed in the recipe.  I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, replaced the cream with lite coconut milk, and added a 9oz package of frozen, chopped spinach (thawed) at the end. Yum yum!

Very good recipe! I did make some changes: 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of soup. I used 3 potatoes, and a slightly bigger can of chickpeas. I didnt have garam masala so i added red chili powder and a little more curry. Threw 2 bayleafs in and added some more water and let it simmer down for about 10 minutes. DELICIOUS.

First off, this is not really butter curry since it doesnt have any butter in it. So, I sauteed my onions and garlic in 2 tbsp butter since it gives way more flavour than oil.    I didn't have any tomato soup so I used diced tomato's (which gave it a pretty color) and also a squirt of good old ketchup for some extra taste ( i didnt have any tomato paste.    The spices were so perfect balanced which made this dish awesome! Even my 2 year old loved it. thanks for sharing.

I never realized how easy it was to make such a good curry. I always relied on the jars! Never again. This is easy to make, no complicated ingredients, takes little time and is very very flavorsome. A keeper!

Fantastic dish! The tantalizing aroma filled the house. Was looking for something Indian to make for dinner with just the ingredients on hand since it's snowing and didn't want to go to the market.  Substituted coconut milk for the milk or cream and 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes for the canned cream of tomato soup.  Going into my real recipe box!

Delicious! Served over rice, this makes for a very hearty (albeit starchy) meal. Like another reviewer, I served this with Guferati (Indian Green Beans), and the combination of flavors was excellent. I will make this again, and probably toy with using different vegetables (for example, cauliflower instead of potatoes).

Love this Recipe.  We have friends over every Friday for dinner, and during Lent, this is a great choice because not only is it "Lent friendly" but those who don't adhere to meatless Fridays are just as satisfied.  I generally don't put in the ginger just because I rarely have it onhand and I will usually substitute other veggies for the potatoes because I serve it over rice, but whether you make it as is or make modifications, I bet you're happy with this one.

Very easy recipe. I substitued the soup for diced tomatoes and sour cream for the mik. I definately think yogurt would have been better though. Also, I felt that more curry was in order. It wasn't bland but, it wasn't bold. All together it was a good recipe for my first attempt at Indian.

Great recipe! I had to leave out the ginger because I didn't have any, and I added a pinch of cayenne, but otherwise I made it as per the recipe. I'd like to try it with diced tomatoes/tomato paste and coconut milk sometime, but it was tasty as is. Thanks!

Quick & Tasty!  Some easy substitutions I did - tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, sour cream instead of milk and added more chick peas instead of the potato.  Served with rice

Made the recipe exactly as it's written. I like the combination of items in this dish, but it seems to be a little too "tomato-ee". I also thought that it was missing something, seasoning wise.  I eat at this Indian restaurant right down the street from my place quite often, and the food is delicious... maybe I'll leave the Indian dishes to the professionals.

Pretty good. I wasn't making so much (only had one potato and a mini can of chickpeas) so I cut the recipe down a bit. Used some leftover tomato sauce and a few tablespoons of canned tomatoes instead of soup, added 3 teaspoons of red curry paste, a pat of butter, and used a small can of coconut milk instead of milk or cream- gave it a rich thickness and extra sweetness. Also used one tiny sweet potato I had in the fridge. Great side dish.

Following this basic recipe, I subbed coconut milk for the milk, and diced tomatoes for the tomato soup. I felt it needed color, so I used red potatoes and added some frozen mixed veggies. Awesome!

A bit mild for my taste. I didn't like using canned soup - next time I'll use crushed tomatoes & tomato paste, up the spices, and add cayenne for spiciness.

I seem to be the only one, but I did not like this recipe!  The curry was too thick and surprisingly bland, considering the spices in it.  I wouldn't make it without some of the modifications suggested by other reviewers.

WOW AMAZING!!! I wanted to try a new recipe and came across this. As there's no (good) indian restaurants in town, I'm going through withdrawals! I took a chance and doubled the recipe so I could take some in my lunches, and I'm SO glad I did! What a GREAT recipe! Very easy, as well! Served over some brown basmati rice with naan, and I barely tasted it I ate it so fast!!! This will DEFINITELY be a part of my regular meals!

Good stuff. Not the most sophisticated flavors--you can't really escape the tomato soup base. However, its homey and easy and I've made it multiple times. Easy to adapt/improvise with.

The flavor of the sauce overpowered the flavor of the potatoes and chickpeas....I enjoyed this more then my family did but definitely will be experimenting with this recipe because I think it is a great jumping off point. Putting it in pita bread with cucumbers and some lamb is where I might take it next.

Great, easy to follow recipe.  I cut potatoes a little smaller than suggested and half mashed to mix with flavor more thoroughly. Next time I will double recipe since there wasn't too much left over after dinner for two adults.  All and all, great recipe that I will be making again this winter.

The spice combination in this dish is really fantastic.  Like other reviewers, I substituted canned diced tomatoes and yogurt for the cream (I added a bit of vegetable broth to make up for the thickness of the yogurt).  Even though I realized afterwards that I had goofed and used vanilla yogurt, the flavor was still excellent.  Next time I make this I think I will add some greens and another can of tomatoes for more color and moisture.  This is very easy and flavorful and my four year old dug right into it!

I made this as a side dish to Chicken Satay.  It turned out nicely. I did not put the full amount of onion in, due to my kids' preferences. I also only used 1 Tbsp oil because of less onion. My husband and I enjoyed this.  He said the intensity of the flavors was "just right."

My boyrfiend made this for dinner tonight and it was good. He used half the amount of potates and put in some cauliflower. We didn't have any ginger so he left that out. This was good served with rice but next time I think we'd spice it up a bit. Will make again, thanks.

This is a really good recipe, very similar to what you might get at an Indian food restaurant.  To make it a vegan dish I substituted plain soy yogurt for the milk and about 1/4 cup of water as the yogurt made it a little too thick to stir well.

This is SO delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and used cauliflower instead of potatoes for more fiber and less starch. I also used light coconut milk instead of regular milk and it was really tasty! I was wary of using the canned tomato soup, but I would recommend using it, it was one of the ingredients that MADE it! Because I was using cauliflower, I let it simmer for longer than 5 minutes to let the cauliflower take on the flavours a little more. Next time I make this I may add the cauliflower at the point of adding the spices. My boyfriend, who loves Indian food thought I bought it pre-made.

This recipe is so good. Tastes just like an Indian restaurant meal. I added 1 tsp tumeric (for the health value of the spice) and it worked really well. There is no way it simmers for only 5 minutes though, reduced it for about 45 minutes.

This recipe is very quick, and it really tastes authentic.  I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes in place of the tomato soup.

I've made this at least 5 times and my husband (who would not each chickpeas  before) loves it.  I like to add a little more tomato paste and garlic, so it doesn't have such a canned tomato soup taste, but otherwise it's easy and delicious!

With a couple of tweaks to give it a little more flavor this was a great alternative to my main chickpea spinach curry. I doubled the cumin, used 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger (add with onions and garlic), nixed the salt, substituted yogurt for milk and instead of condensed soup, tomato sauce + 1 tsp brown sugar.  Not very spicy, but definitely delicious--will make again soon!

This was very good. Next time I am going to use carrots and maybe some peas instead of the potatos because I think it might go better over the rice.

This is a really excellent recipe! I fed this to 5 really picky guys for dinner tonight and they absolutely loved it! I followed it exact with 1 exception: I put half an onion and a leak bc I was short on onion. However, next time I will add the spices to a heated tomato soup with milk. Adding it to the grilling onion and garlic caused me to waste a lot of the spices bc it wasn't moist enough to absorb them. Amazing taste and really simple to make!

Very tasty dish....added 1 tsp turmeric.  Never thought to use tomato soup, but it worked out well.  Used milk as tomato soup was "cream of".  Will add to list of yummy recipes.

I found this recipe to be really lacking in flavor. I was expecting something with a more authentic and full bodied taste. The final product wasn't bad, but I won't be making it again.

First time ever preparing a curry dish.  I'm always looking for different things to change up our dinner routine - this is a great addition to our repertoire.   Like some of the other reviewers suggested, I substituted coconut milk for the milk, and crushed tomatoes for the tomato soup.  I also added raisins.  My husband was impressed, so that's all I can ask for!  My four year old wouldn't touch it, but that was expected (good thing I had back-up chicken nuggets).  All in all, it was a good recipe to change things up a bit.

Delicious!  I made a few changes: canned tomatoes instead of the soup and coconut milk in place of the cream.  I topped it with cilantro and served with naan.

This was great.  Lots of flavor and easy to make.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato sauce for the tomato soup, used two potatoes and cauliflower instead of four potatoes, and added 1 tsp. cayenne and green thai curry paste. It actually could have been spicier, but was still fantastic.

This recipe was great for my first homemade curry! I used it mostly as a base for my curry creation. I followed the spice amounts for the most part (2 cloves garlic, used some fresh ginger), but changed other things: olive oil instead of canola, whole cooked tomatoes in their own juice, a giant can of chickpeas, and most of a little container of coconut milk. I also added half of what turned out to be a pretty spicy pepper (a piment in French markets; cooked with the onion, garlic, ginger). Served it with basmati rice and fresh cilantro. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because a) I didn't follow it to a T, and b) it's still not quite on par with restaurant curries. It is a really fast, really easy and pretty nutritious meal. I will definitely make it again!

To make it healthier, I followed other reviews and substituted the cream for skim milk and canned, diced tomatoes in place of the soup.  I increased the amount of spices to make it more flavorful and substituted roasted cauliflower for the potatoes. I also mashed some of the chickpeas to change the texture.  I would make this again!

Very good, I was hoping for bolder flavors so next time I might adjust the spices to fit my tastes.  Also used steamed cauliflower instead of taters to cut down on the carbs. Thanks!

We've made this several times and its always a hit. Garam Masala was hard to find, but we could definitely tell the difference when it wasn't included. We substituted heavy cream for soy milk and it was just as delicious, although not as thick. It's a tasty veggie dinner that we served with whole wheat couscous or quinoa.

I really enjoyed the flavors of this dish. The poatoes added nice bulk to the curry & the sauce was fabulous. I tweaked the ingredients a little to fit what I had in my pantry & the results made a great, quick dinner served with rice. This is a great use for those cans of garbanzo beans.

This recipe was good but not as great as other curries I have made. The tomato soup gave it some flavor but I would rather use other forms of canned or fresh tomatoes next time. Also, I would reduce the amount of potatoes and increase the amount of beans in this recipe.

Did not enjoy at all. Made it with skim milk and served over brown rice. It has no flavor. I added double the spice in an effort to give it some flavor. Maybe I should have used cream and served with white rice but I wanted to keep it healthy.

This is a great curry recipe!  I added more spice then the recipe called for - but I used a large can of crushed tomatoes rather then the soup so I created more volume.  Absolutely delicious.  I served it with rice and naan bread.

This was great, even my picky two year old LOVED it (aside from the onions, which she picked out). I ended up adding more spice than this called for, and used tomato paste instead of soup (it's what I had on hand) so I had to add a little water. I would also recommend adding extra coriander powder- the coriander with the chickpeas was awesome. I also subbed yogurt for the milk.

Excellent!  I took the users' advice and only used 2 potatoes, which I think was plenty (I used large russet potatoes).  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly as written.  This was absolutely delicious, thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wow, this curry recipes is much easier than other recipes I have tried. The cauliflower being substituted for potatoes was delicious!   Definitely a new favorite at our house

Turned out incredible.  I didn't have the garam masala, and just added curry and garlic, and still had a rich flavor.  Served over brown rice and with a side of bread, it made for a cozy meal.

Nice. I replaced the milk with coconut milk, left out the salt and used reduced sodium condensed soup. I liked it less salty, more sweet.

No matter how many spices I added I could still taste the tomato soup, next time maybe I'll try canned or fresh tomatoes.

Delicious.  I didn't have tomato soup or onion, so I left these out but it still tasted great.  A little cayenne pepper made it even tastier!

My first attempt at Indian cooking and it was a success! I think my pototoes were too big so I wish the recipe had an amount that just a listing for potatoes. I found the specialty spices at the co-op and Penzey's had them too (I'm lucky enough to live in a town with a store). This recipe also freezes well. there was soooo much food! I served it with Naan and a tomato, feta, cucumber salad.

My boyfriend said this reminded him of his favorite chickpea curry at the Indian restaurants.  The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because I added a considerable amount of half-and-half so that it didn't have the consistency of mashed potato.

We love this recipe!!  It is full of flavor!  Nice amount of heat!  I made this on what is normally our take-out pizza night.  It's a very inexpensive recipe to prepare for a family of six. I made a few changes.  I cubed the potatoes and onion, omitted the oil, added 1 1/2 cups water and 1/2 small can of tomato paste. Also, omitted the milk. I added all the spices and used fresh ginger.  Didn't have Garam Masala so I googled it and made my own.  I cooked hot Italian turkey sausage separately in a frying pan then cut it into bite size pieces and added it to the simmering pot.  I served the curry over brown rice.  I'll make this time and time again.  Thanks for the recipe! mg

This recipe seemed very starchy to me.  Between the potatoes (a starch), the chick peas (starch-like consistency), and the rice, it was just too much.  I made it because I wanted to try using some chick peas I had.  It was not a hit at our house and I will not be making it again.

I just made this recipe!  I loved it!  The only suggestion I have is to use Yukon gold potatoes they give an extra layer of flavor, and do not break up as easily as other potatoes!

I followed this recipe in every way except that I used a 15 oz. can of chickpeas. This meal was excellent! What an easy, quick, and inexpensive curry this is! It was the perfect compromise between the spiciness my boyfriend and I love and my parents' and son's virgin tongues. My picky toddler ate everylast bit and even scooped the rest of the sauce up with his bread. This is a great easy, quick, and cheap recipe, especially when one considers how great it tastes!

I really liked this. I did 1/2 cauliflower, half potatoes. Did a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato paste, added a zuchinni and it was fabulous. I actually forgot to add the cream (I was going to use yogurt,) and it was still good. Healthy and flavorful dinner. Served with rice.

Can I give this 6 stars?  The simplicity and outstanding flavor of this recipe make it one of my top 3 favorites.  I will be making this routinely.  If you enjoy Indian food, you MUST try this recipe.  The only modification I made to the recipe was to use leeks instead of onions for a more mild flavor.

Great recipe. In addition to the potatoes and chickpeas I added a frozen veggie medley (carrots, peas, corn and green beans).  Other than that I did not change a thing. I served the curry over brown rice with garlic nan.  The dinner was great, but I think the leftovers were even better.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely a five-star recipe with the suggestion of diced tomatoes and a couple tablespoons of tomato paste in place of the tomato soup.  However, I would not replace the potatoes with cauliflower (as some users have suggested) without trying the recipe with potatoes first.  I think chickpeas are meant to pair with potatoes in a curry.  To add to the "butter" flavor, I replaced the oil with butter and used a sweet onion.  I could eat this every week for the rest of my life.

We loved this! I followed the recipe as is and I did not find it too bland at all, like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I made it the night before so I think the flavors had a chance to blend. Delicious served over jasmine rice and topped with a dollop of yogurt. I will make this again.

Made it for the first time. Outstanding and so simple. Will substitute some of the potato with cauliflower next time..and cut  the potatoes smaller.I like the idea of  using some coconut  milk. Perfect dish for substitutions and/or add-ins.

Quite simple and tasty.  The only changes were to eliminate salt (I rarely put salt in any recipe) and use 1/4 cup plain fat free yogurt and 1/4 cup fat free half & half in place of the milk/cream.  I like having a heavier consistency to my curries and want to eliminate excess calories so I've found this is a good mix to replace heavy cream without making it too thick.  Only change I would make next time is to double the sauce.  The potatoes soak up a lot of the sauce and I'd like to have more so I can put it over my rice.  I might also add some frozen peas just to get a veggie in there.

I cant put my finger on it but there was to much of something, as far as seasoning goes. I thought the chickpea and potato goes very well together. I followed the recipe exactly but next time i think i will add more veggies like others have done & substitue coconut milk for the reg milk. I will make this again but make minor changes next time.

I found this recipe and I made it last night!  Absolutely wonderful!!  I took the advice of some of the reviews written; I used coconut milk and tomato paste.  I added a little more spice...just because I like spicy foods.  I substituted the chickpeas for chicken;I already had cooked chicken breast and I threw that in at the end so the chicken wouldn't be over cooked.  I made it so it wasn't that much stew because I didn't eat with the rice; eaten along is great. I brought some in for lunch today and can't wait to eat it.

Good basic curry. I doubled all the spices and used ketchup (used a long squeeze out of the bottle) instead of soup since I didn't have any. Added a dollop of sour cream and 1 can of coconut milk and just a tiny bit of regular milk. Didn't pre-boil the potatoes and just let them get soft by simmering the whole pot for like 30 minutes so the sauce would be nice and thick. I simmered the onions, garlic and spices in olive oil before adding the wet ingredients. I also added a teaspoon of celery seed, season salt, and onion powder. I can't wait for it to sit in the fridge overnight. I find curries ALWAYS taste better the next day.

I am one month into being a vegetarian and this was the first recipe I tried off of this site and let me tell you.. it was great! Easy to make with much flavor in it as well. I think next time I make it I will take another review's advice and use canned tomatoes opposed to tomato soup.. but it definitely is excellent as is.

Awesome curry recipe with lots of "wiggle room" for adaptations depending on what you have handy. Add a little cayenne pepper to make it spicier!

This was delicious! My roommate said it was the best food she's had in months! I'm thinking of trying it again but also adding chicken. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was great.

I thought this recipe was a little bit bland, but perhaps that is b/c my family eats Indian food 3-4 times a week. What I loved about it was that it is SO fast to make, and very creamy. I would make this recipe again on a weeknight, but add way more spices.

I made a quick version of this recipe - I used canned potatoes instead of boiling fresh potatoes and it was ready in 10 minutes start-to-finish!  I recommend using half the amounts of garam marsala and curry powder (1 tsp each instead of 2); I thought the flavors in mine were overpowering.  I also added about 1/3 cup fresh chopped cilantro after it came off the stove. If you're cutting calories and others at your table aren’t, this recipe is good with or without (calorie-rich) rice.

Really good curry and quick and easy to make.  The only change I made was to use a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) instead of the soup.  Will definitely make again!

This was pretty good, but lacked a little spice. It has a lot of spices in it, but next time I would add some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. I prefer "Aloo Phujia" on this site, and would rather add garbanzos to that recipe.

I liked this a lot.  It isn't what you would think of when you think of a curry, but it tasted great and was easy to make.  I made it exactly as written, by the way.

This is a REALLY great recipe.  I'd rate it 5 stars, but I did use several modifications other reviewers used.  With these modifications, it's a 5 star recipe:
- use a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomatoe soup
- use coconut milk instead of regular milk

After cooking and tasting it, I wanted more heat, so I put a pinch of red pepper flake in, but I think most people would like this recipe without that.

This recipe is just delicious!  It is so easy to make. I used red potatoes and the garbanzo beans and when it was ready, it was served over rice. This is something I will make over and over. Thank you so much for posting it!

This was a good recipe for a quick and nutritious dinner.  The taste wasn't fabulous - guess I'm just not a fan of chickpeas or potatoes; but I'll probably do it again because it was easy to make.  Oh yeah - and steam your potatoes instead of boiling!  Good way to save some time.

This recipe is awesome!  The only things I changed, was I added cooked chicken, and instead of heavy cream I used coconut milk.  Very good, even my 4 and 2 year old ate it!

This was such a good recipe! The combination of spices was wonderful. I doubled the recipe because I was making it for a group of friends and the only change I made was to use plain yogurt in place of the cream because it gives it a more authentic taste. This has gone into my permanent recipe file!

Quick, simple and delicious!  I will make it again.  Instead of heavy cream or milk I used soymilk and it still tasted great.  I will try some of the other recommendations such as cauliflower and maybe the coconut milk for variety next time.  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

Very good. To make it vegan, I used coconut milk in place of animal's milk. Served over jasmine rice. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for posting.

The great thing about this recipe is the speed at which it is cooked.  Once everything is at hand it is 15 minutes (microwave the potatoes by the way).  The fresher the ingredients the better it is, I didn't use any cans, ground the the spices myself and cooked the chickpeas from scratch, a world of difference.

Excellent recipe.  I also substitued cubed tomatoes (blended) instead of tomato soup.  I also boiled chicken and shredded it then added to the mix.  Will make again.

I halved the recipe (it's just me here, and I don't always like eating the same thing 4 days in a row), and it turned out great!  I did add some more tomato soup and milk as the sauce was starting to dry out, but that is a simple change to make.  I served it over German spaetzle noodles (leftover from yesterday).  Really tasty.

Excellent.  I love it.  Bf said he likes coconut curry better, but he did like it.  It doesn't take long, and reheats well--made it last night for tomorrow's dinner, and just popped it in the microwave.  Served with naan (don't like rice much and didn't want to make it) and I loved it.  Thanks!

I was so excited to try this recipe and finally found the time to put it together this evening. Being new to the world of Indian food I thought this would be a good recipe to start off on as it had good reviews and the general sentiment was that it was easy to make. I have to give the recipe props for being easy (the hardest part was taking the time to peel, cut, and cook the potatoes.) However, in terms of taste, I thought it was horrible. I made the recipe just as called for and found it to taste like a odd combination of christmas cookies and a poor curry recipe. Talk about anything but appetizing! If I were to make suggestions, I would recommend leaving out the ginger. Not only was it overpowering, it made it incredibly spicy.. in the christmas cookie sort of way no less. Beyond that change I am not sure exactly what would help the situation. In my case I ended up rinsing the sauce off of the potato/chickpea mixture, adding milk, butter, salt and pepper to it, and mashing it to make a fiber fortified mashed potatoes of sort. At any rate, hopefully your experience with this one will be better than mine! Best of luck!

I am not a good cook and this came out like my favorite restaurant dish.  I was a little less than careful with measuring the spices and could taste too much ginger.  Next time I will be extra careful.

I made this exactly as written except for adding fresh steamed green beans after the onions were sauteed.  I also mixed my own garam masala from a recipe on this site.  I made it yesterday for lunches this week.  Spiciness was perfect for me.  I think it would be good with peanuts (salted?) tossed on top.  And as another rated noted, the tomato soup sounded so odd but tastes perfect with the spices.

This is very easy and delicious. I left as is using milk to keep the fat down, and add extra spice and carrots.  I have made this many times, it is a favorite in our house.  I serve it with tandoori chicken.

Great recipe!! Tastes delicious! Way cheaper than prepared Indian dishes bought at the store. Also, easy weekday recipe - you can prepare the potatoes, onions and garlic ahead of time. You can also mix the spices ahead of time. Then, just mix it all together, takes about 10 minutes. We will make this one of our regular meals.

Fantastic.  Following a previous reviewer, I added a can of crushed tomatoes and some coconut milk because I didn't have any tomato soup on hand.  I also added some sliced carrots while I was cooking the onions and  some curry paste because I was lacking a few of the spices.  Yummy!

I'm patting myself on the back for this one!! I made this for dinner, and I'm dreaming of tomorrow night when I can eat the leftovers. We're pretty die hard meat eaters, but we didn't miss it a bit in this dish!! I did sub a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato soup, and coconut milk for the regular milk. Served it over the Carrot Rice recipe from this site. Divine!!

pretty good. the problem i had was that i served it with a couple of other very spicy dishes, and the flavour was simply lost among them. i liked it more the next day, but i think i would have to kick up the spices a notch if i were to make it in combination with any other indian foods again. that being said, it was tasty and quite easy to make. thanks!

DELICIOUS!  I used coconut milk instead of the regular kind (actually, 2 parts cream of coconut + 1 part water, when coconut milk is hard to find).  Also, I pretty much tripled the spices--depends how spicy you want it.  I added green beans to the mixture--they sautee well with the rest of the seasonings.

This was such a great dish!! However I did alter it a little. I added vine ripe tomatoes instead of condensed soup. Salt to taste. Instead of cream I used yogurt.

I was so impressed with myself after I made this!  Delicious and relatively easy.  Would have loved to add baby carrots, but didn't have any in the fridge.  Definitely satisfied my curry craving...it's a keeper!

Using coconut milk makes all the difference here, (I use the light version to watch calories and nothing is lost in the flavor). I also used an extra teaspoon of garlic and a teaspoon of red curry paste to add depth. A wonderful recipe!

Really great flavor, but I had to double (at least) the amount of spices and instead of cream, I used coconut milk, which made it so good and rich.  I do like my food spicy and flavorful though, so I recommend tasting after the first batch of spice and add more if needed.  Also, I added carrots and used a variety of small potatoes, like Yukon, red, and purple, that I found all together in a bag at the grocery store.  It really added to the dish I think.  I made some whole wheat naan to go with it and it was a fabulous dinner!

My family really loves this recipe. The flavor is wonderful. We reduce the potatoes slightly, and we've added chicken at times. It's very versatile, and wonderfl over Basmati rice.

I've tried making Indian and Asian food before and failed miserably.  This was finally a winner!!  I added chicken instead of potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I added about 1 1/2 pds of raw  chicken breast, cup up, in after I cooked the onion.  I browned the chicken and then continued to add the other spices as the recipe instructed.  I then let it all cook on the stove at a simmer for about 2 hours.  I served it with spinach and rice.  Yum!  Next time I may try it with coconut milk instead of cream.

This made a tasty, filling, and inexpensive meal. I microwaved the potatoes to make the process a little faster. It made plenty for leftovers the next day, too. It tastes fine when made with skim milk, but is extra delicious if you use coconut milk instead. I serve it with rice and papanaan.

Very easy preparation and quick to the table.  Tasty, but a bit too spicy for us.  I'll cut back on the cayenne next time.  Yummy--Will make again.

Used milk and coconut powder instead of tomato soup. Add a chicken cube, and a bit of sugar for flavor. Also used a lot more spice than called for. Four fresh chili for med/hot spiciness.

This is a really great recipe and satisfied my curry cravings.  Next time I am going to try and use tomato sauce and paste instead of the tomatoe soup to get a more red color in the curry.  I suggest using whole milk too so you can use more than cream to get saucier curries.

Fantastic meal! I don't know why, but I started mashing the potatoes and then remembered that it was not a mashed potato meal. Nevertheless, it was a blast with everyone. I kept my mouth shut about my mistake, and no one batted an eyelid. :)

Although it was very simple, after reading the reviews I was rather disappointed.  I used 1% milk, added approx. 1 tbsp butter in addition to the canola oil, used only 2 1/2 medium potatoes and followed the rest verbatim.  Pretty much tasted like spiced up tomato soup.  I may try this again but will cut up fresh tomatoes and add a bit of tomato paste or something.
Okay it's now day two after having cooked and refrigerated it all and it definitely tastes better.  My advice would be to cook ahead and serve for lunch or something the next day - the flavours mixed nicely.

Very very good! The first time I made it I added the entire teaspoon of ginger, which proved to make it a bit too spicy for my taste. I used a can of petit diced canned tomatoes instead of the tomato soup, and accidentaly curdled the cream the first time, so on the second try mixed it in a small bowl with some of the liquid before which worked great.

This recipe is really good, and easy to make.  I didn't have any garam masala, so to substitute, I used: a dash of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and dash of coriander.  And instead of using a real onion, I used onion powder.  It tasted just like dishes I've had in Indian restaurants.

This is a family favorite. I use 2 sweet potatoes, and 2 regular potatoes with awesome results. We've tried cream, milk, and yogurt, and cream tastes the best by far!

We also serve it with turmeric flavored jasmine rice with a handful or two of raisins. Yum!

I'm going with a 3 stars b/c well i thought it was a 4 star but my husband thought it was a 2 so 3 is even -- we thought it had a strange taste - i cook a lot of curries so i guess this was a bit disappointing - i did add some peas to give it some color - i guess i can't make it again b/c the hubby has to like it and he didn't. sorry but it was a 4 star for me - easy to prepare - maybe just add tomato sauce in place of the soup - maybe the soup just gave it a strange flavor for us.

My family thought this was pretty good but not fireworks-inducing.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of soup and added some cauliflower and substituted coconut milk like others suggested.  I really enjoyed it a lot, especially for a vegan dish, but the family didn't rave, so it may not make the shopping list again.  Thanks for the recipe though!

This was good.  I think next time I will use 2 sweet potatoes and cauliflower rather than 4 potatoes... it was just too starchy.  I did love the flavor of the sauce though.  I used coconut milk rather than cream, and added diced tomatoes, which I think really added something.  Served with Indian Basmati rice from this site.

Stumbled across this recipe looking for a way to use up a few potatoes. This was SO good...tasted like what I have had at Indian restaurants. I made it to the recipe except for the canned soup. Just couldn't see adding that with all the other natural ingredients. I used a can of stewed tomatoes, chopped up. My 9 yo and my teenager loved it! I put some red curry paste on the table to add for those who like it spicy. Made the naan from this site to sop up all the juices. I will make this again!!!

This is a great curry, and seems versatile. I used no-salt-added diced tomatoes instead of the soup, and Lactaid milk. Perfect level of spiciness for me, but my husband would have preferred more heat. I may have to make two batches next time to accomodate.

I loved the spices in this recipe!  However I thought the tomato soup flavor came across strongly in the finished product.  I used cauliflower instead of potatoes, but didn't steam them before adding which I think was a mistake.  I also used Campbells condensed soup, which combined with the salt in the recipe caused mine to come out too salty.  In the future I'll use crushed tomatoes and steam the cauliflower first, or use potatoes.  Peace!

This was easy to make and very flavourful.  I love chickpeas and curry, so this was perfect!  Will be a regular dish here.

Great recipe, I modified it as someone else mentioned by using chopped tomatoes instead of soup and I also cut back on the garam masala to suit my guests taste. They loved it!

Wow.  I tried this today and it was AMAZING.  I made a few changes:  I sauteed a diced apple with the onions and garlic at the beginning, and added the spices then, sauteeing them for a bit as well before adding a can of diced tomatoes and the chickpeas.  Then, because I had the time, I simmered all of that for a while, before adding the potatoes (I used a sweet potato and 2 white ones), and, because I had it on hand, some shredded chicken breast.  I cooked the potatoes right in the "stew," and because of this had to add more water as they cooked.  I threw in a handful of frozen peas a few minutes before serving, and served it as a stew, with a crusty bread.  Maybe not a true curry the way I did it, but it was unbelievable.  Both kids (2 and 4) and hub loved it as well.

My husband thought this was great but I didnt really like it - kids were indifferent.  I thought the can of tomato soup gave a weird taste to it and the curry really didnt have enough flavour (I increased the spices too).  I may try this again with a can of tomatoes instead of the soup like someone else said but wouldnt rush to make this again.  Fresh coriander may help just before serving..

Yum!  I would definitely make this recipe again.  This was my first try at any type of curry, and the recipe was easy to follow and it tasted great!  Next time I'd put in fewer potatoes, but that's just a personal preference.

So easy and really tasty! I found it had just enough spice to give it a little kick but added some raisins to add a bit of sweetness.

The potatoes made this a little bland. Next time, as another reviewer pointed out, I will omit them. Cauliflower or another vegetable would be a better substitute.

I absolutely love the base of potatoes and chickpeas of this curry.  I am in Japan and my local supermarket didn't have a some of the ingredients, so I decided to give it an exotic kick.  I replaced all the spices with 2 tablespoons of Thai green curry paste, the cream or milk with coconut milk, and the tomato soup with a can of diced tomatoes.  It was really excellent.  Next time I'm going to try a couple tablespoons of Thai yellow curry paste.

This was great! And so easy to make.  I added some yellow bell peppers chopped up for more vegetables.  If you like butter chicken, this is an excellent vegetarian substitute!
