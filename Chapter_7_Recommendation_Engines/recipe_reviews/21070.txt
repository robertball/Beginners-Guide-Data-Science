This is a nice, quick, healthy cold salad, but the amount of vinegar that is called for is entirely too much.  I think that cutting it half would provide plenty of flavor without being overwhelming.

I made this salad for our Mother's Day lunch and it was great. I made a few adjustments: 2 cans of garbanzo beans, seeded & chopped 1 samll cucumber, seeded & chopped 1 tomatoe, added 1 Tbsp dried minced onion, 1 tsp minced garllic, 2 ribs celery diced, 1/2 red bell pepper chopped, 1 tsp dried parsley, some fresh ground black pepper and I used bottled low fat Balsamic Vinagrette salad dressing.  It was a big hit and I will definitely make this again.

Nice side dish. I combined  balsamic and red wine vinegar to equal 1/4 cup combined. This was plenty. I also added a splash of olive oil. Thank you for a healthy, tasty recipe.

I'm sorry to say but this recipe was a disaster and a blatant waste of food.  How anyone can ingest the amount of vinegar this recipe calls for is beyond me.  Maybe the amounts for the vinegar should be 1/2 T. and NOT 1/2 cup.  This recipe was so easy and fast that it was made before I realized how much vinegar the recipe called for--it was disgusting!

Very good "outline". Must cut vinegar 'to taste' OR substitute fresh lemon or lime juice. MUST add minced onion, garlic and parsley. YUM!

This is a DELICIOUS recipe that can be made in less than 10 min, which is a plus for people on the go!  I just recommend that you cut the amount of vinegar in HALF.  Enjoy~

I really liked this salad, though I did make some changes.  I used 1/2 of a green bell pepper in place of the cucumber, and I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, and coriander.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, a splash of white vinegar, and some olive oil.  I also added just a little granulated sugar.  It was delicious!

Tasty.  I also cut the vinegars in half and next time I might even cut it down to 1/4 cup combined as the other reviewer recommended.  Very quick and inexpensive to make and yummy, too!

This is really good--even my 2 yr old was begging for my bites!  I agree that as written there would be WAY too much vinegar.  I took the advice of another to use equal parts red wine vinegar and balsamic totaling 1/4 c which was still more than sufficient.  Next time I'll try adding some feta.

(After reading some of the reviews I reduced the vinegar by half.)

great and super easy!  i didn't have an onion on hand and i used a whole cucumber.  i also only added 1/4c of liquid (half white wine vinegar and half balsamic vinegar).  maybe it was my substitutions, but it could have used some more salt.  i will make this again!

This need livening up a bit while reducing the vinegar.  I use my own vinaigrette dressing, coriander (cilantro), mint and flat leaf parsley. I also include a small deseeded red chilli, a red onion, and some peeled diced cucumber.  It always disappears at barbecues and buffets.

Hubby and I both loved this!  I made some changes: 1/2 chopped green pepper instead of the cucumber, no onion (I don't like raw onion), small tomato's worth of sliced grape tomatoes, only a 1/4 c. of red wine vinegar and 1 t. sugar (1 T red wine vinegar + 1/2 t. sugar substitutes for balsamic vinegar, which hubby is allergic to - so for those who are not allergic to balsamic, this is equivalent to 2 T. red wine vinegar and 2 T. balsamic vinegar). I added in a dash of coriander, garlic powder, salt, and pepper per another reviewer's suggestion. Very good!

Very easy, elegant for a side dish to take to parties. But for those not big into vinegar, add a pinch of sugar ( I use brown sugar ) to "soften" the vinegar taste.

Upon the recommendation of the other reviewers, I also used less vinegar.  It turned out fabulous.  I would highly recommend this salad as a quick dish.  It has a really balanced flavor that I wasn't expecting from so few ingredients.  Definitely a winner!  Thanks!

this is a great combo for a quick, tasty salad... my very successful variation- using red wine vinagrette and balsamic vinagrette- about 1/4 cup total- instead of tomatoes- shredded carrot... and adding cumin, garlic powder and dill... yum yum yum!

Just made it and it was quick and delicious!  I tweaked it a bit, a la some other followers.  I omitted (okay, forgot) the tomato, add a bit of seasoning (salt and pepper), used a dash of olive oil and used a quarter cup total vinegar, the majority red wine.

This is okay.  It is quite simple, but I don't think you need that much vinegar, and I LOVE vinegar.  I 1/4 it and I think it's too much--maybe I'm considering it more like a salad dressing and don't think it needs so much.  Not bad, though, for flavor considering the simple ingredients.  I added a bit of dill and used garlic instead of onion.  Thanks for the recipe.

I liked the salad, but I made some of my own changes. First, no tomatoes, I added sweet red pepper instead. As for the vinegar, only about two tablespoons, and I didn't have any more balsamic left so I used Italian dressing. Tastes really good.

Very good, I would mix the vinegar separate from the rest so you can add what you think is enough.  I just did 1/4 cup of each, and didn't even put the whole amount on there...it was plenty.  I also added some celery.  It is a nice refreshing salad.

way way way too much vinegar.  I would cut down vinegar to a few tablespoons and add olive oil if I make this again.

Nice and healthy salad. The recipe is WAY off with measurements of vinegar so I am giving it 3 stars. I only had a 7.75 oz can of chickpeas so I scaled down the tomato, cucumber and onions. I only used 1/2 TEAspoon of both the vinegars and it still was kind of strong! Very good! Made for a great lunch.

Too much vinegar!!!! I am eating this right now for my lunch and I can barely finish the small container I have of it next to me.  I think I might not eat what I have left at home.  What a waste of food. Its easy to make but the amount of vinegar is way too much.

The first bite, I thought it was bland.  But it tasted better and better every bite.  My 2 year old and I had this for lunch today on a bed of red leaf lettuce.  She thought it was great!

Rather than leaving all the chick peas whole, try coarsely smashing about half with a potato masher. It changes it up just enough.

This is a good salad and a good way to get some fiber!  Everyone else is right - you don't need that much vinegar!  I used 1/8 cup of each plus added a bit of olive oil. I also added 1 tsp each of dried parsley and sugar and added salt and pepper to taste.  I put in a couple ribs of celery and a tomato too.  If you let it sit in the fridge for a bit it soaks up the dressing and is really quite nice.

The salad was swimming in vinegar. I added two more cans of chick peas. 1 cup of vinegar is excessive.

I've been making this for years. Really tasty and easy. I call it my "whatever I've got in the fridge salad" because I usually use all the ingredients in the recipe but if I don't have onion, I leave it out. Sometimes I add avocado, or feta cheese, or mozzarella cubes, bell pepper (any color) diced/sliced carrots - anything!  I don't use as much vinegar and I never use Balsamic because I don't like it - but I do use cider or white vinegar, oil (prefer Olive) salt, pepper and oregano (or whatever spice I'm in the mood for).  Very fast and easy to toss together - tastes better the next day if it lasts that long.

MADE CHENGES:  Similar to my "usual" lunch (but I dice/chop the cucumber).....only I omit the onion, and instead of the vinegar for dressing, I use a small amount of (lite) Sweet Vidalia Onion dressing.  YUM!  Occasionally I will add one or two chopped hard boiled eggs to change it up.  I have had this for lunch at work nearly every day for the past 2 months and haven't gotten tired of it yet!

Made it exactly as written except I put in a whole cucumber, oh well I also didn't have quite a whole 1/2 Cup Balsamic but.... Many people said they didn't care for it or cut back the vinegar but we loved it.   I tasted it after it had marinaded about and hour and said this is great, husband tasted it said yes it's good but I think it needs more vinegar - he was serious, my son also said it wasn't vinegary enough.  Also in this meal we had wilted spinach served with hard boiled egg and vinegar... :)  I guess we are just weird.

I picked this recipe because I wanted something easy for some chic peas that I cooked the day before.  I agree, I would never use this much vinegar.  I sprinkled with extra virgin Olive oil and about 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar.  I prefer the mild taste.  I added some pepper, a little oregano and garlic powder, a little Italian twist never hurt anyone.  WaLa...My husband loved it.

This recipe is a great base for an easy, healthy salad.  As with other reviewers, I feel that the amount of vinegar indicated is far too much.  (And I LOVE vinegar!)  I went with 1/3 cup each balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar, and even that was too strong.  I'll definitely make this recipe again, but will add other items as I have them (red or green peppers, additional spices, etc.) and will reduce the amount of vinegar significantly.  I recommend using red onion.

kind of a dull recipe. I love vinegar, particularly red wine vinegar, I also love chickpeas, but this recipe is just lacking a lot. I think if you want to have a good chickpea salad use chickpeas, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese, and red wine vinegar...plus whatever other normal salad toppings you like such as tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, bacon bits, etc.

Agreed, a good outline. I cut the vinegar in half, add some green pepper, lime juice, cilantro, green and jalapeno peppers...yum.

I use this just as a starting point. It's the right idea, though I change it to include just 1/4 cup-ish of balsamic, plus tomato, red onion, and fresh cilantro. Could add things like peppers, etc. Done like this, it even works as a salsa with nacho chips, which is how I served it at a Christmas party last night.

I loved it!!  It was a big hit at a BBQ.  I did reduce the vinegars and added some olive oil, parsely, green onions, pepper, and I used red onions as well.
