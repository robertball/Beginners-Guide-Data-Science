Funny story, I thought I had chicken breasts, but I didnâ€™t and with one hour til the party I was in trouble. I found a box of dinosaur chicken nuggets, air fried them, and cubed them as a substitute. The breaded chicken parts made this recipe that much better!!!

Oh, wow. I saw the video while hungry, and IMMEDIATELY went to the store. This was absolutely amazing! We didn't just use crostini for ours; because my family ate this as a meal, we used sandwich rolls, and it was DELICIOUS.

Instead of cooking our own chicken, I got some chilled rotisserie chicken breasts from the store. Since we didn't have pan drippings from fresh-cooked chicken, I didn't drain the ricotta, and it worked very well. I think I used too much chicken, though, so I ended up having to add another 1/2 cup of sauce.

Please make this. You won't be disappointed.

So good!  This would be great party food. I followed the recipe as written and don't think I would change anything.  I used a loaf of french bread for Crostini from this site.   We had this for dinner with a salad.  Even my 4 yr old devoured it!

Easy and definitely tasted like chicken parm!  I used Short Cuts chicken and did not bother draining the ricotta, otherwise made as directed.  I served it for dinner with Crostini D'Emily from this site and my family liked it tho still prefers real chicken parm.
