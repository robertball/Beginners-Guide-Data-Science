These is the BEST spritz cookie dough I have ever made!  It is the perfect consistency for easy "spritzing"...not too sticky, not too dry.  And the cookie flavor was delicious!  These don't spread much and really retain the spritzed shape...they looked really nice.  I substituted butter for the butter shortening (yuck) and added 1 t. orange extract for a little bit extra orange flavor.  I also experimented with a light orange glaze icing that I drizzled over the top of a few...YUM.  These can be dressed up or down and my kids loved playing around with different candy sprinkles.  At 12 minutes, they cooled to a crisp texture.  I think 10 minutes would be better since we really like a chewier cookie.  These can EASILY be adapted to any flavor...lemon, almond, coconut...etc.  It is the PERFECT spritz recipe!!!  :o)

I just ate one of these melt in your mouth cookies and they are so awesome!!!  BUT.....I am still in the middle of baking them and the cookie press is just not working out for me.  The dough keeps sticking and won't come out and stay on the cookie sheet.  For every 10 cookies I try, I get one that turns out.  The only thing I did different than the recipe was to use butter instead of the butter flavored shortening.  I can't believe this would make such a huge difference.  I want to try these again with the butter flavored shortening.  The taste is so good, I hope it turns out, but so far, it's been a huge pain in my butt!!!....I tried these again with the butter flavored shortening and they turned out a lot better than my first time.  I guess that's what it was. This makes a lot of cookies.

Jessy, thank you for this wonderful recipe -- my family loves these cookies!  This was my first time using a cookie press, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was easy as pie, and so very delicious.  The very slight hint of orange flavor from the zest is perfect.  In fact, I may use even a little more zest next time.  I had some leftover Nestle's white morsels from another project, so I melted a cup of them in the microwave with a TBS or so of shortening, then stirred in a few drops of orange extract and dipped some of the cooled cookies halfway.  Oh my goodness...they were heavenly and looked so pretty with the coating (which set up very nicely so that I could still easily stack the cookies).  Again, thank you so very much -- your fantastic recipe has certainly brightened our holidays! :)

Excellent recipe!  I've been making traditional spritz cookies for years, and was skeptical about these but I wanted to try something different.  The texture was perfect for the cookie press, and baked a little softer than regular spritz.  I opted for 2 tsp. almond flavoring, since I don't like orange.  It was wonderful--will replace my traditional recipe!

I just bought a cookie press a couple weeks ago and tried several recipes already.  This has got to be the best one!  The cookies came out so soft and flavourful, and went through the press so well!  I didn't have any orange zest, so I just used some almond extract.  I split the dough into three parts and added a few drops of red and green food colouring to each of the other batches and made an assortment of red, green and plain Christmas cookies in different shapes, topped with sugar sprinkles.  I'll definitely will use this recipe again.

These are the best spritz cookies I've ever made.  Last year I had to throw out 2 batches of spritz because they were horrible.  The dough goes thru the cookie press great.  I took advice of others and eliminated orange zest, replaced with 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract, increased suger to 1 1/2 cups and eliminated the cinnamon.  Can't stop eating them.

These cookies pressed so easily and beautifully.  I didn't use the cinnamon or orange zest, but just used the cream cheese base and then separated the dough into three bowls and added maple, coconut, and butter rum extracts for a variety of cookies.  They were each so soft and melt in your mouth good!  I'll be using this base and trying all kinds of flavorings, but this is my master cookie for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe held up great in my cookie press.  It was very tasty and easy.  I had to make 100 cookies for a cookie exchange party and these were perfect because you can put nearly 2 dozen per cookie sheet.  My only piece of advice is to make sure your cookie sheet is cool when you put the cookies on the sheet - they will hold their shape better.  Additionally this works best on a ungreased cookie sheet.

I used 1/2 C butter & 1/2C shortening. They turned out awesome with a little powdered sugar dusted on top. Definately a family favorite!

This is THE perfect dough for a cookie press.  I used it with an old Mirro cookie press and a silicone baking sheet.  98% of the cookies pressed out perfect -- they don't spread once in the oven -- and they tasted like a perfect butter cookie.  I have had so much trouble in the past with the dough not going thru the press and especially spreading once in the oven.  This recipe has solved all of those problems. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Very tasty and easy!  Resulted in buttery cookies with a very nice texture.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Note: I had to use the cookie press designs with larger holes, as my dough turned out a little thick for the ones with smaller holes.

I just received my cookie press on Friday, this is the first recipe and the ONLY one I'll use.  The taste is phenomenal and I doubt I could improve upon it much.  I didn't have orange zest so used a half tbsp of orange juice - probably could have added more but am not about to blame the recipe for that.  These cookies are just perfect and it was all I could do to keep from making a second batch just to get past the learning curve of a new cookie press.  Fabulous recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

Yummy! For a slightly crisper exterior and a whiter dough, substitute egg white for the egg yolk, and use regular non-flavored shortening. This also "lightens" the flavor. I also tend to sprinkle with a very fine dusting of cinnamon and Tang.

This is an old handed down family recipe.  We LOVE it very much!  We always have to double the recipe because they literally FLY off the wire racks.  If you don't do orange zest/orange rind you can use 1-2 TBS of frozen OJ concentrate (that's what we usually do).  Love these cookies!

Excellent cookies. Very good flavor, moist and not dry like many spritz cookies are. I sprinkled with powdered sugar and they were gorgeous.  Would be easy to sub lemon or lime flavors for the orange and they would be just as good.  Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

So at first I thought this was a normal butter cookie but after a few days in the cookie jar, I could really taste the Orange in the cookie.  Make sure you use the Orange Zest.  I mean why wouldn't you? It's delicious!  I made cookie trays for X-Mas and everyone raved about this cookie.  I used the Wilton Ultra cookie maker and they came out perfect.  I added sprinkles and they looked like perfect little Christmas Trees and Flowers.  I recommend this cookie!

This was a really great recipe.  I used real butter instead of butter flavored shortening and I used 2 tsp of almond extract in lieu of the 1 tsp of orange and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also sifted my flour, cinnamon, and salt.  I have a convection oven so I'm not sure if that's what made the difference, but I found that especially the snowflake shape tended to get brown around the edges any longer than 10 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was not very good. My sister loves spritz cookies and these were horrible. The dough got too dry before you could use it all and the cookie tasted way too much like shortening.

This recipe is wonderful. The cookies are light,crisp and melt in your mouth good. If you are giving Christmas Cookies as gifts, this is an excellent choice for one that will be loved by everyone.  You can color it, take the left over egg whites add a two tbl of water and brush the egg white mixture lightly on the top, sprinkle whatever decorations (colored sugar, candied cherry halves, sprinkles) and bake.  I could not find butter flavored Crisco in a can here, but I did find the sticks. FYI, 1 stick is 1 cup, so it couldn't have been simpler to make. Just dump the stick in.  No goopy mess.  Thanks for the recipe and the reviews!

The dough handled well and worked with my press well. baked the first batch for the 10 minutes and the bottoms were super browned...reduced time to 7 minutes and they were wonderful. They were really good coming out of the oven, but after a couple of days they got to be really hard.

I just love this recipe!
In the Netherlands shortning is expensive to obtain, so I used regular butter, but made sure it was very soft, though not liquid/molten.
Kept the original seasonig, though subsituted the orange with satsuma.
A bit of green food colouring, my trusty cookie press with x-mas tree insert and christmas cookie galore!
Thanks so much for this recipe (also from hubby ;-) )

These are, by far, the best "spritz" cookies I have ever had, and that includes my own mothers'.The orange zest and the cream cheese are absolutely perfect together. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Very tasty and turned out great. I didn't have any orange zest, so just omitted it and they turned out very good. I have an old cookie press, so it makes small cookies and with the convection oven at 325 F, they baked in only 6-7 minutes. My little girl says they are a "MUST" to leave for Santa!

I am very impressed w/ this cookie! At first I thought the dough was too dry, but after I worked it a bit, it came together beautifully! I left out the orange zest and added a touch more cinnamon- and put a glaze and sprinkles on top. This recipe is a keeper!

These are yummy!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I use 1/2 regular shortening and 1/2 real butter.  Turned out great.  I also glazed the tops.  I did find that I preferred baking them for 8-9 minutes instead of the 10-12.

While this recipe held it's cookie press shapes very well, I would omit the orange zest if I made these again.  The orange was way overpowering!  Maybe substitute almond or lemon extract.

I followed the recipe just as written, the cookie batter would not come out of my cookie shooter very well and they did not cook right. I had to leave them in longer than I wanted because they would not come off the cookie sheets because the cookie was so soft, like it was not done. They tasted good the same day I made them, the next day they were hard and not soft at all. I will go back to my old recipe.

The only change I made was adding the zest of an entire orange.  THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING. I haven't made any spritz cookies because I consider them to be a boring cookie, lol. This recipe intrigued me with the addition of cream cheese, orange zest and cinnamon.  It didn't disappoint! The dough worked perfectly in my cookie press.  I was using a Martha Stewart press I got for Christmas last year.  This batch made almost 9 dozen cookies! I decorated them with sanding sugars, but I have even bigger plans for the next batch.  I'm going to make an orange glaze and apply after baking.  You could still add sugars for whatever holiday!  I plan on adding this recipe to my cookie baking arsenal!  It's a winner!  My house smells a-m-a-z-i-n-g right now.

I did  not care for this. It tasted like grease and literally was flavorless.I do not know the value of putting cream cheese in unless you use a lot more.It was hard to put thru the press maybe the measurements are different in Canada.

Gorgeous cookies! This recipe was my first attempt at 'spritz' cookies and I couldn't be happier! The flavor is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and am thrilled with the results! Can't wait to make these for the holidays - people will love them and be impressed!

At first I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I didnt really like the taste and the texture was too soft. However, it must have needed to sit for a while before eating because it was much better the next day. It reminded me off the butter cookies you buy in the tins around Christmas time.

Classic spritz cookie recipe! Absolutely fantastic!! The dough turned out beautiful and worked perfect in my spritz cookie press. The only change that I made was used almond extract in place of the orange zest. Definitely my "go to" recipe for spritz cookies.

I was really excited to include this cookie in my countdown for Christmas 2009.  I've never heard of cream cheese in a 3 oz package; I am only familiar with 8 oz.  I was confused while reading the ingredients list and decided to go with the 3 oz that the author had.  BIG MISTAKE!  The dough was very stiff and made very rough looking cookies.  I had hope that things would smooth out after baking...they did not.  There was an awful flour taste.  I decided to include the other 5 oz of cream cheese for a total of 8 oz - PERFECT!  The texture was beautiful and very easy to work with.  I didn't think the flavor combination was anything to get excited over.  Thanks, but no thanks - I won't be making these again.

I love this recipe.  The orange zest gives this recipe that "special touch" that makes these cookies stand out among other Spritz cookies.  I had forgotten to put the colored sugar sprinkles on one batch, so I took the advise of another poster and made a glaze of orange flavoring with confectioners sugar and a little milk.  Well, THAT topped it!!  Now my family say's, "Glaze them all from now on!!"
This is an especially easy recipe to follow and baking time is real quick.  I baked them for 10 minutes and they were perfect!!
I didn't get as many cookies as the recipe stated, but I will just double the recipe for next time.
You can't go wrong with this one!!
Enjoy!!

We made these last night.  We omitted the orange and cinnamon and replaced the vanilla extract with peppermint.  We really had fun!  Perfect consistency for the cookie press.  I agree with another comment that the cream cheese leaves an aftertaste.  I love cream cheese, but not in spritz cookies.

I babysit for a girl allergic to wheat and eggs so we used 1 1/2 tbsp. water + 1 1/2 tbsp. canola oil + 1 tsp. baking powder in place of the egg yolk.  We also used Whole Spelt flour instead of regular flour.  We had to add 1/2 cup of additional flour because of the egg substitute recipe above is for one whole egg - dough was too wet.  With the changes we made, the dough still worked wonderful and the cookies were great.  A very good recipe, just personal preference concerning the cream cheese thing.

I made this recipe with three other Spritz recipes from this site.  The dough was absolutely delicious (I couldn't stop eating it) and the texture was perfect for making press cookies.  I was a bit disappointed with the taste of the baked cookies, though.  Not sure why, they seemed a bit bland.  I took all the cookies to work and to a church social and asked folks to rate them.  A few people liked these best, but not all that many.

Just made them tonight-yum!!  Changed the follwing: butter instead (straight from the fridge), omitted the orange zest, and used neufchatel cheese, and bakers sugar instead.  We have two types of presses, worked great on both, and the kids did them (so it was slow) and the dough still held up!  This is a keeper!

Very easy.  I make a batch every Christmas with my Pampered Chef press.  I sprinkle red and green sanding sugars on before baking.  These are light and subtle, and freeze well.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I omitted the orange and cinnamon though, and just stuck with the 'basic' recipe.  Aside from that I used the exact same measurements and everything.  I found NO NEED to add more flour when using with my cookie press (I have the pampered chef cookie press).  I think that the dough needs to be a little more 'sticky' for presses than if you are just going to drop them.  The recipe yielded 4 dozen cookies for me.  I have also done this recipe with almond extract instead of vanilla, also, very good.

I didn't like the sour after taste the cookies leave. The dough is hard to separate from the press, I had to use a knife. I made them for my son colleagues at the day care, now I am thinking to convince my husband to eat them. I don't recommend them.

This recipe was everything everyone said it would be.  Melt in your mouth good!  I was so glad to read the review that mentioned not to chill the dough.  I am used to doing this with all cookie doughs and it would have been a mistake!  

I would prefer this cookie without the orange zest.  I thought the orange flavor overpowered the cookie a bit.  I will definately make this recipe again without the orange zest!  Thank you Jessy!

Great taste, texture and easy for my first time using a cookie press. The only mistake I made was chilling the dough and it wouldn't come out of the press until it was back at room temp. So good, even I couldn't mess them up!

These definitely had a great flavor, but I would add more orange zest and more cinnamon next time.  At about 2 and 1/4 cups of flour, the dough seemed perfect, so I didn't add the other 1/4 suggested.  That would have made it too dry, in my humble opinion.  They came out beautifully from the cookie press- very easily and not messy.  Also, just a note, I didn't have anything but margarine, so I figured I would use that (not the shortening).  Dough and flavor did not suffer with that substitution.  All butter and/or margarine can be used in this recipe.  11 minutes was perfect in my oven, but check them after 10.  I like my cookies a little under-done.

I have been making these for the past few Christmas's.  We love them. I substitute butter for the shortening.  After cooling, I melt white chocolate and milk chocolate for dipping some of the cookies half-way for a fancier look and taste. Adding sprinkles, crushed peppermint, or drizzling the opposite choc. over them adds even more flavor.

VERY tasty! Much better flavor than the average butter cookie. I changed a couple of things to our tastes: used half real butter and half regular shortening, added 1/4 tsp. almond flavoring and omitted cinnamon and orange zest. Sprinkle colored sugar on tops before baking.

These came out perfect, every cookie!  Not sure if it was my new Wilton Ultra Pro Cookie Press or the recipe!  Left out the cinnamon and the orange zest, taste awesome, drizzled chocolate and sprinkles over them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this recipe with my 2 year old son "helping".  The consistency is perfect for my brand new cookie press!  I did not use orange zest but did 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond.  YUM-O!!  Now I am chronic recipe changer so I'm sure I will have MANY variations on the flavors as well as frostings, but this is a FANTASTIC start!

The dough worked great with my cookie press. I used almond extract in place of the orange. I found that baking these on my faberware cookie sheet produced a better cookie where my airbake sheet left them falling apart. This was the first time I made a spritz type cookie and while I am not a fan of the flavor on a regular basis, the still tasted good.

Alterations I made... 1/2 Butter flavored shortening 1/2 Butter 1 and 1/4 tsp almond extract instead of the orange zest  I added the almond because the flavor is a signature to me when it comes to spritz. Like mom makes. These spritz turned out wonderful, great flavor with the almond I think. I am going to lower my cook time next time to 7 minutes because even 8 to 9 was way too long for my oven. They ended up browning more even after they were off the pan. That kinda irritated me, but what can you do, live and learn that's what.   Possible alterations... I think maybe more cream cheese next time. Around 5 once's maybe.

5 stars for the texture and taste of these cookies! I will omit the orange and cinnamon next time though since it does change the taste of the cookies and I love my traditional buttery and delicious spritz cookies with colored sugar sprinkled on top. I also used butter instead of shortening and put the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes until it was firm enough to go through the cookie press. Great recipe altogether!!!

Nice change from hard, bland, traditional spritz cookies. These cookies turn out soft, and the cream cheese gives a nice, subtle tang to the flavor. However, I made a few changes by using 1/2c. of butter-flavored shortening and 1 stick of margarine instead of the 1 c. of butter-flavored shortening listed in the recipe. I also reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. and mixed in 20 drops of green food coloring before stirring in the flour. The recipe yielded 8 dozen cookies, using the cookie press tree-shaped plate. I used a silicone baking mat on top of a pre-heated baking stone for 9 minutes until well set but not brown on the edges. Then I took the cookies out of the oven, let them sit on the stone for two more minutes, removed them from the stone, and cooled them on a wire rack - they turned out perfectly!

These were awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great.  I didn't even really notice the orange/cinnamon flavors.  This is much better tasting and easier to handle than the recipe that comes with the pampered chef cookie press.

My daughter an I tried to make these cookies.  I saut tried because we ended up throwing away the cookies we make, they had very little taste.  We could not get the dough to come out of the cookie press it was very very stiff.  We both experienced at baking, we've NEVER had an experience like this

Very good recipe.  Dough was just the right texture for my cookie press.  I did not notice any "aftertaste" like some reviewers describe.  The addition of the orange zest was perfect for adding just a little something extra.  I followed the recipe as written except that I used butter instead of shortening.

Better than most but still short of amazing. Dress them up with FROSTING, SPRINKLES, or SUGAR & CINNAMON and they can ride with the best of them!

This recipe is fantastic.  My entire family loved it.  My 3 yr old daughter said, "MMMMM mommy, you  make great cookie dough"--she helped me make them & got to taste test the dough.  I had an awful time with my spritz cookie press though and ended up rolling the cookies into balls & then pressing with my thumb or a fork.

These cookies are FANTASTIC. I made them as a gift - boy was it hard to let them go! I admit with a blush that the raw dough was irresistable too. This recipe is going into my personal hall of fame for reliable great recipes.

Three Cheers for this recipe!  I've owned a cookie press for years now and I always have issues with the dough.  Not with this recipe, for the first time ever most of the cookies came out clean and only a few had to be put back into the press.  I didn't have an orange so I debated on whether it was important, in the end I used a clementine and YES the essense of orange adds so much to the dough. I used the heart press insert, and after they were baked I drizzled criss crosses of vanilla glaze and melted chocolate, or vanilla glaze and pink glaze. My outcome was dozens of cute cookies for valentine parties in school!

Just made these tonight because I got a huge order for valentine's cookie trays and wanted to start now with something I could easily freeze in bags.  Used a few drops of pink food color, used my trusty pampered chef cookie press (the absolute best!!!) and piped these pretty cookies into heart shapes.  I sprinkled a little crystal sugar over each one and they baked up beautifully!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the easiest and best tasting spritz recipe I have made.  I used butter instead of shortening.  Also, I didn't have any oranges so I used lemon zest and the cookies have a nice lemony after-taste.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

BEAUTIFUL!  This was my first attempt at spritz cookies with my new Villaware power cookie press....OMG!  They are PERFECT!  Thank you soooo much for the awesome recipe.  I've always wanted to make spritz cookies, but everyone's I've ever tried tasted so blah-ho-hum to me. This recipe went thru the press like buttahh....heehee.  EASY EASY EASY!  I used butter instead of shortening and only put a dash of cinnamon in.  Can't wait to make pink heart cookies for Valentines Day!

I just got a Pampered Chef cookie press and was looking forward to making these. This is my first time making spritz cookies and it was a very easy recipe to work with. The cookies turn out great and the taste is very good, my daughter gobbled up quite a few of them even before I had a chance to decorate them.

These cookies are lovely and flavorful.  I used mint extract and green food coloring with the "tree" cutout for the cookie press.  This recipes works even better with the Pampered Chef cookie press than the recipe PC includes.  I don't notice any aftertaste, as some have said but maybe it's masked by the mint.  Either way, this is a keeper.

These pressed great. A little bland. I had to use butter instead of the butter shortening. I  am going to try the butter shortening and lemon next time.   My son added an M&M to the center of about half the cookies. Went over big with the M&M, added a little zip to the cookie...

This is probably the best Spritz Recipe I have tried.  I had a little bit of trouble with the cookie press because I grated the orange rind too big.  Next time I will make sure I grind it finer.  I made snow flake shapes and I dipped them in powdered sugar ~ it added a little something extra...yummy!  I will definately make these again.

These were good, but they didn't do too well in my cookie press.  Does anyone have any tips for cookie presses.  I hear conflicting things.  Some say the dough should be chilled other (including perfect chef tips) say dough should be at room temp.  I had trouble with my dough releasing onto the cookie sheet.  I tried parchment, no parchment, cold cookie sheet, nothing worked.  What's the secret? Any cookie pros out there?

Very good cookie, these do not last long at our house.  I omit the orange and cinnamon. These work better if you bake them on parchment paper so you can easily slide the paper off and start on the next batch.

These are more flavorful than most spritz cookies.  They have become a holiday favorite.  Plus, the freeze beautifully so you can make them ahead of time.

Good flavor but I found the dough to be very dry and difficult to work with.  I added about a tablespoon of milk which helped.

The house smelt beautiful when these were baking.  Used limd zest instead of orange because I didn't have any.

This recipe worked great in the cookie press and the orange peel and cinnamon really put the flavor over the top.  I used butter instead of shortening.  These were the holiday cookies that disappeared the quickest this year.

This was a great recipe!  Didn't have butter flavored crisco so I use 1/2 cup crisco and 1/2 cup butter.  Turned out quite nicely.

Delicious!  We've had a semi-hard time getting them to release easily from the press but the flavor is so good.  I did use other recommendations on 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I also had no orange to zest so I used orange flavoring.  It's fine but I know the zest would have made them even better and brighter!  Will add to my box and use this as my go to Spritz recipe.  Thanks!

I was thrilled to find this recipe on line finally.  I have made these most years of my life.  My mother got this recipe with a cookie press approximately 50 years ago.  My family absolutely loves these cookies.  I am not as organized as my sister and often have to pester her for this recipe again when I misplace it.  I am thrilled it is now on line for all to enjoy.

ok, followed recipe exactly.  I have a battery operated cookie press, dont know if that played into it, but the dough was way too thick to come out of the press.  Did not work at all.

awesome! I wasn't sure the cinnamon sounded good, but it adds just the right punch to the flavor. Addicting cookies - better make 2 batches.

Excellent little cookies. Nice and crispy. Nice flavor too. The orange and cinnamon are there, but just barely so, not strong on either flavor. These are better than the butter cookies you buy in the tins at the store. This is a keeper! Thanks.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the cookies are wonderful! I'm new to making spritz cookies, and was very disappointed in the recipe that came with my cookie press, so I've been searching for something better. This is definately it. I'll be using this recipe from now on.

Hey,everyone

I have to tell you I got this website from a friend of mine and I have to tell you. I'm not a baker! No one could belive I made these. Including myself! They looked picture perfect, and tasted great! That being said I made this recipe and took them to the office for Christmas, they were a HUGE HIT. And trust me if I can make these anyone can!!! Thanx again!

The recipe was great - easy to handle (I did use almond extract for the orange zest as several reviewers suggested), and I was looking forward to trying my new cookie press, which - didn't work (defective part). So, I made the best of the situation, and made cookies using a cookie stamp. The taste of the cookies is great, and I iced them with Butter Icing for Cookies (from this site). Next time - I'll use a cookie press, but the stamp was a fine substitute under the circumstances.

I've not had good luck with my cookie press in the past, but I was determined to give it another try.  This recipe worked wonderful with the press.  I made Christmas tree shapes for Christmas cookies.  I did use butter in place of the butter flavored shortening per the recommendations of the cookie press manufacturer.  I also melted about 10oz of almond bark and dipped the bottoms of the cookies in the melted chocolate.  The chocolate really taste great with the orange zest.  I will definitely use my cookie press more and this is my cookie press recipe for now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were awesome! They came out soft and flavorful and were very easy to work with. I used butter and almond extract due to lack of ingredients, and I'm looking forward to trying them with the orange zest. The flavor reminded me of buttercream frosting or cream cheese sugar cookies.

Despite using butter-flavored Crisco the cookies lacked any butter taste. It tasted like Crisco had been used.

This was great dough to work with, and I love the orange zest.  I really didn't like the taste of these, it's the cream cheese "tang" at the end.  I had to give it four stars though, because of the dough being so perfect.  If you don't like the taste of cream cheese frosting (which I don't and should have known better) I wouldn't recommend these. Otherwise, great spritz recipe!

Didn't have orange zest, used mint extract and tinted the dough with dye. The consistency for the cookie press was PERFECT! Will use this again!!! Also, have used only butter and it is perfect. Instead of orange or mint, you can use almond extract too for a more traditional taste. Kids love these!

this is the spritz recipe I will use from now on.  I have tried many spritz recipes including a couple of celebrity chefs but this is the best ever, bar none!  I am a bit new to an electric cookie press and this is made for a novice press user.  This is such a versatile recipe.  I stuck to the recipe but added a bit of orange extract and the use of a microplane for the zest caused no problems in the press.  I did refrigerate briefly between batches.  Came out of the press like a charm. They had a lovely orange flavor (1/4 tsp. orange extract) and I used orange food color to highlight.  Perfect off the cookie sheet; no sticking.  Buttery good and cream cheese was not overpowering but added a nice touch.  Will experiment with extracts next christmas.  This batch is going air mail so will update on how well they travel.

These cookies had the best flavor of any spritz cookie I've ever made.  The orange is very faint but wonderful.  I will be making this again!

Pretty good.  I failed miserably in using my grandmother's old cookie press, so I just rolled the dough into small balls, coated them in cinnamon sugar, and then flattened them with the bottom of a waxpaper covered glass.

Yuk. At first I found these bland. I omitted the orange but the cinnamon was barely detectable. Then I noticed a sour after taste, probably from the cream cheese. These cookies went to a party and were barely touched. And whoever comments that the dough is dry is right. It was almost impossible to mix in the last 1/2 cup of flour. The dough was hard to crank through the press and hard to separate from the press. In fact, the pattern left a ridge of dough on each cookie. I will not make this recipe again.

Good if you have left over egg whites from a yolk demanding recipe, otherwise a bit too sweet for my tastes. It is easy and they do keep well.

Considering this recipe had many great reviews, I was quite dissappointed in my results.  First, the dough was too dry for the cookie press, so I had to add a little water.  In the end, the cookies were rather heavy and tasted quite dull.  Although I baked them for a holiday reception at school, I ended up throwing what I didn't send to school away.  I won't make them again. I'll stick to my favorite butter cookie recipe when I want to make something with my cookie press.

I was looking for a replacement for my old standby spritz recipe, and this is definitely it!  The cookies have a very nice flavor, work very well in the cookie press, and turn out nice and soft.

Yum, we loved these! I think they are best when they age a day or two so the tang of the cream cheese really kicks in. 
This is the second year I've put these in the holiday cookie rotation.  When I made a 1/2 a batch to test these, the family had them gone by morning.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe two times this season and both times the cookies came out of the press perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I brought these cookies to a cookie exchange and they were the prettiest ones there!  I have never made cookies from a press before, but from now on, this will be my go-to recipe.

Wouldn't press through the cookie press; bland, hard cookie. First time using Crisco, still not a fan. I might use the rest of it to see if my pie crusts come out more flaky, like they claim. But my last crust with butter was pretty darned good, so...

Yes, very soft and the cookies did retain their shape. However, I would definitely use a combination of shortening and BUTTER next time. I didn't use orange zest, but doubled up on vanilla. I thought they were pretty bland. That could be because of the butter flavored shortening or not enough vanilla. Will give it another go.

These are amazingly good.  I did alter the recipe slightly.  Instead of cinnamon I used all spice and added a mixture of both orange and lemon zest.  I used the left over egg white with a little water to brush the cookie before baking and sprinkle clear sprinkles on the cookies.  I used my cookie press with the snowflake or flower press.  Uncooked size 1.5 inch final size 2 inches.  Baked for the full 12 minutes on a cookies sheet with a silicone pad.  Will definitely be making these again.

Would have been a 5-star review, but my husband and I didn't love the orange flavor.   Also, had to add about a cup more flour in order for this to work in my cookie press, and neither my husband nor I felt that the cookie tasted too flour-y at all, even with this big addition.  Perhaps a different cookie press would have yielded a different result?

Loved this recipe, had never made these before, however not new to baking.  Adjusted the recipe several times. Used the almond and butter shortening the first go. Too buttery. Used orange zest and cinnamon with 1/2 reg. shortening an 1/2 reg. butter. AMAZING, can't stop eating them. 3rd go omitted orange and cinnamon and added 1 tbs. of almond, good but orange and cinnamon taste better to me. Thanks for sharing this one! Dough was VERY easy to work with. Bought a Wilton cookie press for $5 and worked great. Did only bake them for about 6 or 7 minutes too. Reading the reviews really helped to watch for things and made this so easy, after 1st go I had recipe memorized.

This was my first-ever cookie press recipe. Read many of the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great! Not too sweet, just a hint of orange, and basically just plain fun to make (and eat). The dough was soft enough to easily fit into the tube and my teenage daughter had no problems pressing out perfect little cookies. We did cut the cooking time down to about 9 minutes but other than that we didn't change anything. Not sure why the complaints- can't wait to try some of the variations people have posted! Glad we chose this recipe to break-in the cookie press and would definitely recommend it.

Excellent recipe.  Worked great in my cordless cookie press, even my 4 year old made beautiful snowflakes!  I used 1/2 C. shortening and 1/2 C butter.  Tastes good but I'd like them to melt in  my mouth like the powdered sugar recipes.....those don't work well in my press though!

Just had to let you know this is the best spritz cookie recipe around.  I did use 1/2 shortening & 1/2 butter along with 1 tsp almond extract and omitted the orange, vanilla & cinnamon.  Couldn't have been easier.  This recipe worked great with my new Wilton cookie pro Ultra II.  about 30 cookies per fill up.

I thought this was a great recipe.  The cream cheese was what interested me the most about this recipe. I used 2 tsp of almond extract instead of the vanilla and orange zest as suggested by others and it was awesome. I used regular shortening. My cookie press broke halfway through so I ended up making the last half into thumbprint cookies and filling the middles with raspberry jam and apple butter just for fun.  Both versions were definitely addicting and I would make this again!

These are a nice, flavorful cookie, but unfortunately I don't think they're as good as an all-butter spritz cookie recipe.
However, the consistency of the dough was absolutely perfect for the cookie press, which I appreciated.

Thank you so much for the perfect spritz cookie recipe. I have not been able to use my cookie press due to lack of a great recipe. The dough came out smooth and they taste great. I was definitely my daughter's hero today; she is very excited to take them to her kindergarten X-mas party.

I believe that the issuer may have meant 8 oz. cream cheese.

Loved the flavor the light orange and  hint of cinnamon were great, a nice change from usal shortbread taste.  I used real butter, so they were crisp not soft.  I will make again and maybe use half shorting for a softer cookie. The orange taste goes great with chocolate.

Perfect texture for spritz.  I will make this my standard cookie press recipe for the holidays.  Next time I will use less cinnamon and more orange zest.

I pressed these using the heart shape in my Mirro set(for Valentines Day)and had great results. I didn't have any oranges for zesting so I used 1/8 tsp of orange extract. I chilled the dough for about an hour. I brushed them lightly  with canned white icing and sprinkled on Valentines decoration. So cute!

Made mine mint flavored instead of orange, and tinted them green. This was my first time trying out a cookie press, so maybe it was my inexperience with using one, but I had a really hard time getting the cookies out. I had to prise each one away with a small spatula. Cookies tasted good though. Thank you for posting.

This is the first recipe that I tried with my cookie press. It worked great and I liked the orange flavor. The cream cheese tang started to loose it's appeal the more cookies that I ate. I made these ahead of time for Christmas and froze them. They seemed to loose some of the orange flavor.

The dough worked great in the cookie press, but we found the orange zest to slightly over power the cookie. If you are looking for a traditional spritz, I would omit the orange.

This is a good cookie.  Not sure that I would say it is the "best" spritz cookie.  It definitely has more flavor.  I used butter and almond extract.  Did not have any problems with the cookie press.  My husband really liked them.  This is a recipe to keep around and use again.  As always, if you don't use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for, the recipe is bound to come up different.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

The best cookie press recipe I've ever tried.  Most of the time I find this type of cookie to be bland but these have great flavor. Will make these again.

I have been using the recipe from pamperd chef since I bought my cookie press, then I saw this recipe and decided to use it. Wow! I am so glad I did. The cinnamon truly compliments the cookie. Thank you for this great recipe.

Very tasty.  I used a new Kitchen Aid cookie press, and it was difficult to work with.  The dough wouldn't stick to my pan.  Next time I'll chill the dough a little to see if that helps.

Just made these for a cookie exchange.  I added almond extract in place of the orange zest.  I also replaced the shortning with butter.  The cookies were so light and tasty. The only reason I give the recipe four stars is that I was only able to squeeze out 4 dozen, the recipe says it make 6 doz.  I even used my smallest cookie press form.

I was not familar w/ spritz cookies but they taste alot like shortbread cookies.  The dough was very easy to work with and my family really enjoyed them.  I now have to make another batch b/c they ate so many of the ones I had planned to give away. :o)

I choose this recipe b/c others said it was easy to go through the cookie press and I wanted to let the kids help.  That was not the case at all for me, in fact my husband had a hard time getting the dough to go through.  I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of evaporated milk.  The cookies still tasted wonderful but were too crumbly (probably from the evap milk).  I would try another recipe especially if the kids are helping.

This recipe is very easy to make. There is a slight after taste from the cream cheese. If you like cream cheese than you won't mind. I divided the mix in half and added food color for more festive looking cookies.

I would give this 5 stars because I LOVED them.  But, at my christmas party I was the only one eating them.  They weren't much of a hit.  I don't know if people thought they were bad or if they have just learned to stay away from my cooking!  : )  I thought the cream cheese made them WONDERFUL!

EXCELLENT! I omitted the orange zest and cinnamon and made 1/2 a batch of drop cookies, and 1/2 a batch of spritz. Both were delicious and had a nutty flavor much like the brandy recipe pizelles.

This recipe is my new favorite for spritz cookies.  They bake up nice and tender, and are much more flavorful than your typical ho-hum spritz cookie.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it over 5 times in 2 weeks since finding it here. Everyone loved these cookies. Even my husband who never eats sweets said they were awesome. I did change it a bit though added a little more cream cheese and vanilla and ajusted for flour. Thanks for sharing this one is added to my recipe book.

These were the best tasting pressed cookies I have tasted.  The cream cheese gave them a nice texture and flavor.
