The recipes as it is written is a little bland so I enhanced it by adding rosemary thyme and garlic. Also to make it a little healthier I browned the chicken w/ PAM used the reduced fat Cream of Chicken Soup used chicken stock instead of milk and used reduced fat cheese. It turned out VERY good especially when served over rice.

This was a hit at my house! I took it to a gathering as well and it was gone in an instant. I actually made a mistake and bought chicken and rice instead of cream of chicken but I am glad I made the mistake. It added some needed starch and flavor!I had a cream of mushroom on hand and added it instead of the cream of chicken. So I did follow the suggestions of adding bread crumbs topped it with cheddar cheese and baked it off. NUMMMM is all I have to say. (I did not add milk) All in all you'll love it. I will be making this again;)

This meal was awesome. I love chicken and I love broccoli so this meal was perfect for me. I was looking for a healthy way to cook both and I found it. My children (4 & 5 year old boys) even loved it.

Great recipe. I started out by coating the chicken in a 50/50 mix of corn starch and breadcrumbs though. I also added an onion to the broccoli. Turned out great.

Once of the best "quick" sponsored recipes on this site I think. I have made it several times now and it's always a hit with just the right mix of fresh ingredients and canned to make it taste great while still being easy to prepare. I prefer to mix the cheese into the broccoli and chicken and have also served with fried potatoes. Very good!

Such a great fast easy dinner option! It has definitely become a fan favorite in my house. I follow the recipe as is but always layer the mixture over white rice in a casserole dish. I sometimes use a combination of broccoli and cauliflower instead of just broccoli. Delicious!

I just made this meal earlier this evening. It was so easy and so good. The only thing I changed was that I marinated the chicken in a store-bought marinade after slicing but before cooking. It was delicious! This dish will be a staple from here on out.

This was an instant hit at our house. Very filling and amazing flavor. I can't wait to try it again. I think the next time we go for it however I will substitute half of the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom and add some asparagus. As its stands untouched it made for a great dinner.

I tried this tonight but made quite a few changes. I used a little less chicken fresh steamed broccoli and a bag of frozen peas and carrots. Instead of the cheddar I used Velveeta thinking it would be creamier. It was a little too thick with the Velveeta even after adding a little extra milk. I put it all in a double crust to make a pot pie. It was OK. I would possibly try this again with the recommended cheese.

Really good. A little too much sauce and not enough chicken for our taste though. Also I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt pepper and Italian seasoning. I also topped the dish with the seasonings as well because the sauce and cheese by itself is a little bland. Instead of using cheddar I topped it with some fresh mozzarella and parmesan and in my opinion it tasted a lot better.

As written the recipe is very good. Use olive oil instead of butter add some garlic salt Cavendar's and rosemary and it is a slam dunk. Quick easy and delicious. We served it over brown rice.

Really good. I actually sauteed some onions first in about a T of oil seasoned the chicken pieces with garlic powder season salt and fresh ground pepper (before sauteing) I added some of the same spices to the milk/soup mix using 1 can worth of the milk. I also added a little more cheese than called for. Later I felt that it was good but still needed a little more salt and pepper. I'm surprised there are no spices called for at all in this dish. With the white rice I served it with it would have been extremely bland but the spices made it a real hit. I think this gets a 4 because even though there were no spices it was a minor fix and the basic recipe is very easy and very good. And fairly healthy as well and inexpensive as well. I also used fresh broccoli. I think that frozen would have been too mushy. Just my 2 cents.:D

Fast easy. Not too shabby. Added some thyme as suggested by other reviewers. Would probably make some white rice to serve it over next time. I missed the rice that is in the traditional dish.

Pan fried the chicken with EVOO and some salt pepper garlic powder and onion powder. Then removed chicken from pan and added chicken broth to deglaze pan. I'm sure wine would be fine but I don't have any. Then tossed in broccolis and soup/milk mix. After it gets up to a simmer reduce heat and add the chicken back in. Cover to cook broccoli and chicken more thoroughly. We ate this over penne then topped with cheddar cheese. Verdict? It was quick and easy to make but still rather bland. Will need to experiment with spices and herbs to get the right taste. Probably use less milk because that diluted the cream of chicken soup taste quite a bit.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. Very easy and very tasty. I used Cream of Mush instead of C o Chicken and added cauliflower. Also I cut sliced Kraft chedder cheese into strips and arranged in a circle and put it in the mic for a min. It looked and tasted great.

Super delicious and it really does just take 20 minutes. I was looking at different Chicken Broccoli Divan recipes and settled on this one because it had fresh broccoli and uncooked chicken (what I had) and was stovetop. Because I was looking around I misread this recipe and used a can of cheese broccoli soup: we liked it I could see using chicken if I wanted lots of cheese on top or more chicken flavor to fit whatever sides I was serving with it. Using broccoli cheese we didn't feel it even needed shredded cheese on top. I followed the milk portion as stated and thought it made plenty sauce. I might even use sour cream instead to make it super creamy but this recipe needs no changes to be wonderful. I felt like I needed a zip this particular evening so I added some red pepper flakes: purely preference. This is what I'll make for lean protein and veggies alongside say sinfully rich mac and cheese: thanks for sharing:)

Yummy! My Mom made this for the family growing up. We all licked the plates clean. Although she made it a bit different just by adding a good curry powder garam masala to taste and serving it over basmati rice. She always used fresh broccoli steamed and arranged in a casserole dish brown your bite size chicken pieces in olive oil arrange on top of broccoli and pour over mixture. Sprinkle with grated cheese. Cook at 350 until cheese has melted and it's bubbling. 15-20min. Excellent! (always rinse your basmati rice well as they put a talcum powder on it some say boric acid. Rinse soak rinse soak a few times.)

Excellent & easy. I added onions to mine and stir fried them with the broccoli at the same time as the chicken. I left out the cheese topping entirely just seasoned the dish with salt & pepper. Could be served over rice too. Yum!

Added pepper at end. And added more milk and cream of chicken so the broccoli was extra steamed.

I spiked this with some Asian flavors and it came out really tasty! I marinated the chicken for 30 minutes in 1/2C soy sauce 1Tb ginger/garlic paste 1Tb brown sugar and half a red onion thinly sliced. Then browned the chicken on medium high added the broccoli and some chopped garlic (4 cloves) stir fried for a couple minutes. Add cream of chicken soup 1C milk and cheese and simmer for 15-20 mins. Served along side oven fries but it would have been fantastic over rice or rice noodles!

This recipe was easy which is a huge plus but I've decided I'm just not a fan of cream of chicken soup. For those that do like it definitely try this recipe but I'd recommend adding a little additional flavor as others have mentioned it was bland. I saw the variation at the bottom using cream of mushroom soup with swiss and I might try that to see if I enjoy it better since I DO like cream of mushroom.

Well I tried this recipe because #1.Not a cook and like quick meals. #2. It was easy. I followed this recipe to the letter except for the seasonings. I used a bunch of home grown Mexican Tarragon in this and it was delicious! I also cut up an onion and several cloves of fresh garlic. Made a pot of rice and put this dish on top of the rice and then added breadcrumbs and popped it in the over on 350 for 15 min. and it was great!:) It fills you up and keeps you warm on a cold night. Freezes good too! One thing I love about this recipe is that you can add whatever you want and it will be good! Sweet peas leeks a bit of carrot (shredded is my thought) celery... it's got endless possibilities!

I agree with the other posters that mentioned that you need to season this recipe - it is too blah as is. I added some kosher salt pepper garlic powder onion powder and a pinch of herbes de provence. I also lightly steamed the broccoli before I added it to the sauce because I was worried that it would still be undercooked. However once I had made those small modifications it was really yummy. Even my four year old liked it. I served it over egg noodles with a tossed salad. Will make it again.

I used heavy whipping cream and sour cream instead of milk and crushed pork rinds on top to make it low carb. Will do again.

This turned out very well. I added pepper. I love pepper on everything. I also made a side dish of buttered noodles. I am diabetic so this was a great meal for me but my husband and daughter needed some kind of filler.

I sauteed the chicken (I used 3 large chicken breasts) in some olive oil and added rosemary garlic powder minced onion seasoned salt and parsley to the chicken while it was cooking. I used cream of celery soup and about 1/4 cup of skim milk. I used fresh broccoli and frozen peas and added shredded cheese the last 5 minutes. Served over white rice. It was absolutely delicious with the changes I made. My 1 year old couldn't get enough and my picky husband loved it!

Although I was looking for something quick and easy with broccoli and chicken this recipe was very bland. I would not make it again. If you are going to attempt this you may need to add some spices to improve it...

Yummy. My husband really enjoyed it. (I added minced garlic to the butter and pepper to taste at the end.) Next time I will try Cheddar Cheese soup instead of the Cream of Chicken.

I made a batch exactly as written for my family and they loved it. I made a vegetarian batch for myself substituting Quorn brand chicken and cream of mushroom instead. I also added fresh mushrooms to mine. We all agreed that the cream of mushroom one had a little bit more flavor but both were excellent!

The great thing about this recipe is that it's a quick chicken divan that is made on the stove instead of the oven when you don't have alot of time. I did find that it needed a little more flavor so I added a little salt and some Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and it was perfect! I made rice and quinoa on the side to serve it over and everyone loved it!

This was quick and easy. I added a little bit of extra milk- maybe 1 1/3 cups instead of the 1/2 cup. Needed more liquid because I went heavy on the broccoli. It was REALLY good. I have Celiac Disease so I used some homemade gluten free condensed soup. Worked out well. Good as a family meal but also if you're cooking for yourself... will make yummy leftovers.

Super quick with very little mess and it's really hearty! I doctored it up a bit with some garlic & onion powder and extra pepper. With a couple biscuits on the side for dipping this is a great weeknight meal.

In looking over the notes from others who ve made this dish I added a few things: One clove of garlic 1 cup low sodium chicken broth (instead of milk) rosemary and thyme to taste and 1 cup cheddar cheese. It tasted delicious over rice! I even did it on my hot plate as we re without a stove right now. It s definitely one to add to the rotation!
