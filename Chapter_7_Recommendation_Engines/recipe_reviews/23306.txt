Very good! The spices remind me of some sort of Indian flavored chili- my husband said I should put it in a contest.  Awesome!

This is a great meal, even my anti-vegetable, pop tart-fed brother likes it.  I added 1 cup of frozen corn for a little more sweetness.

MY family loved this, and I was afraid they wouldn't because they are big meat eaters. This actually satisfied them at home, and they asked if we could make it when we went on our camping trip.  They said it was real rustic like a true cowboy would make.LOL. Silly kids. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this dish ok. It was nothing spectacular. I only used one large can of beans. I would make this again, but not as a main dish, because it's not good enough by itself. However, I do think it would be much better served as a dip with tortilla chips.

I did alter the recipe a little and that is why I am giving it three stars instead of two.  I left out the bell pepper and parsley because I didn't have it on hand.  I also added a can of corn.  Even so it was utterly tastelss.  We ate it with chips and cheese and we kept adding salt, pepper and tabasco sauce to add some flavor.  My husband and I didn't care for it but my kids ate it ok.  Maybe adding some bullion and jalapenos might help.  I don't know and I probably won't try it again to find out.

This dish was very flavorful and so easy to make!  I mashed the kidney beans while they were cooking with a potato masher to thicken it up a bit, and I put all the veggies in the food processor till it was a fine chop consistency (my kids don't like lumps too much).  Overall, excellent flavor that is great over tortilla chips with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Thanks for a new, quick family dinner!

My husband and I are on a new health kick. This was wonderful. I dislike kidney beans in sooooo many ways, but this was really really good. I made exactly as stated. I put in on tortilla chips and a litte "veggie" shredded cheese. When the tortilla chips sofentened, it was really good. I served it with baked salmon in virgin olive oil and seasoning. Hubby is getting it for the 3rd time now. Excellet!

This was excellent!  My family really enjoyed this dish!  Even my 3 year old and 5 1/2 year old gobbled it up and my 5 1/2 year old said, "this smells so good and tastes great." She also said that she would like to have it again.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because these were some of the best beans I've ever tasted. Delicious! I didn't have tomatoe paste, so I used a little ketchup and I served them over brown rice. Even my picky 4 year old who doesn't like beans ate them!

A very good recipe, although nothing to bring down the house.  Nice and hearty with rice.  I'll definitely make it again as it's a great recipe for a double batch in the crock pot.

This was a really good meal after a long day and not wanting to make something elaborate.  We doctored the recipe up by adding a can of pinto beans too as well as adding in Beef Smoked Sausage.  It gave it a "franks and beans" taste that was nostalgic, filling and even better leftover.

Great for a cold winter day! I added corn to mine and used a green bell pepper instead of red.  I also added a little bit extra chili paste to make it spicier.

For all the spices added, I actually found this recipe a little bland. I would make it again, but only if I was in a pinch.

My family really enjoyed this with a few additions. Based on others reviews, I decided to serve it over brown rice as a meal.  A few said it tasted Indian so I figured we would go for an Indian curry feel. I also added a can of corn, a can of chickpeas, and one potato diced. I must confess, I wasn't too sure about it but it ended up being delicious. We also topped it with sour cream since it has some similar flavored to chili with the chili powder and cumin. I will definitely be making it again!

This was delicious and nutritious, as well as easy on the budget. I have no idea how this could simmer all day without going completely dry. As the liquid simmers away, the spices intensify, so keep that in mind when seasoning this dish, especially if children will be eating it. I had it with toasted whole wheat English muffin with  cheddar melted on top and loved it. Thanks!

Love love love this! My first ever "curry" recipe and it turned out soooo well! I added 1 can of corn w/o the juice, added about half a jar of tomato jauce (was what i had) I didn't have any cumin or parsley so I just used 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning for susbstitute. I did puree the kidney beans, and it gave the mixture a nice consistency, like others had said I don't prefer lumpy texture. THe added corn gave it a nice crunch. Will be making this again! Tomorrow I might try with rice!
