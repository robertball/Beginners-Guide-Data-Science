The cloves & allspice were overpowering.  I will try it again with 1/2 the recommended amount.

Plech!  Too sweet.  I wouldn't make this again and I love pickled beets and fresh dill.

I just really, REALLY wish people writing recipes would not use language like "a bunch of beets".  If I get "a bunch of beets" from my CSA it weighs around 1.5 pounds with the stalks, and ends up around  pound after removing stalks.  My grocery store has a "bunch of beets" that is more like 1/2 pound after removing stalks.  What is so hard with just saying something like "approximately 10 ounces of beets that you put into the pot????
I used a lot less sugar, about the called for amounts of allspice, 1/2 tablespoon of whole cloves and added around 1/2 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger.  It was pretty good, but I have no idea if I had the same ratio of the hero of the dish .... beets to spices because I have no idea what the author intended by saying "a bunch of beets".  After peeling and trimming my beets after cooking, removing the tops and peeling, I had 14 ounces (400 grams) of cooked and cleaned beets, or perhaps 1 1/4 cups of cut up beets.
That really wasn't that hard to come up with that, but is really useful for my cooking notes for next time I work with this recipe.  And this was good enough to work with it again .... I just need to refer to my notes and not this recipe.

Really good once you add about 1/2 the spices. I also add a pinch of cinnamon and since I didn't have normal vinegar I used rice wine vinegar

These were good. I added less sugar, knowing I could add more if needed and liked it with 1/2 the amount written.I also used whole allspice berries and cloves. Quite tasty! Thank you for the recipe.
