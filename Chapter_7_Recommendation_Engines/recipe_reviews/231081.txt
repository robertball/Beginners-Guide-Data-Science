This is a very good base hummus recipe.  It has a good texture and some flavor.  Because I like lots of flavor, I would probably add additional garlic and maybe some cayenne, but that is just personal preference.  You can't go wrong with this recipe and then you can tweak it with additional seasoning from there.

Whoa!  Garlic overload! Obviously garlic cloves vary greatly in size and mine must have been particularly large. I used just one good-sized clove and now as I write this it's all I'm tasting. Thank goodness I made this well in advance of serving so that I had the opportunity to adjust - by making another full recipe omitting the garlic altogether and adding it to the original batch. (Now we're going to have "hummus overload!")  Perhaps it might be better to just start out with "a teensy bit of garlic" instead of the rather vague "3 cloves garlic."  Other than that this is a good, basic hummus, tho' for my taste it could use a touch of salt.

Good basic recipe I think water takes away from the flavor so the second time I made it I used the juice from the garbanzo beans. That helps with the flavor issue.  I also added a touch of salt and used two cloves of garlic instead of 3 as the flavor intensifies as the hummus sits, and I love garlic.

A simple recipe to follow that yields great results. From now on, I'm making my own hummus instead of buying it and spending more $$. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is a hummus fanatic.  He claims this is the best yet.  I upped the lemon juice to 3 tbs and added 8 oz of drained roasted red peppers.

Regarding the differing opinions from reviewers about the amount of garlic to use, I would like to point out (from experience) that assessing how much seasoning to add (whether to this recipe, or to recipes generally) should always take into account how much of that food will likely be eaten by any single person. If this hummus is to be served as an appetizer or party dip, especially as just one among several options (and it's most likely that people will have just a few bites of it), then it can be highly seasoned. But if it's to be eaten in larger amounts, or even as a meal, then the garlic (or, for that matter, other strong seasonings in other recipes) should probably be toned down. By the way, with this recipe, you might begin by mincing the garlic and letting it pre-soak in a dish with the lemon juice for a bit before proceeding with the recipe. The acid in the lemon juice should help tame some of the raw garlic's emphatic assertiveness.

This hummus is delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing, although I made a triple recipe and made two alternatives with part of it:  one with steamed yellow squash with cinnamon and cloves and one with chopped basil added.  I baked up some pita chips and have been having the best lunches, sampling my 3 dishes alternatively.

I love this recipe. It turned out great. I doubled the recipe and ended up adding an extra tablespoon of olive oil and the juice of one lemon. It tastes authentic and like it came from a restaurant. Thanks a bunch for this one.

An excellent base recipe. I followed the suggestion of "Doug in Manhattan" and cut up the garlic and soaked it in the lemon juice for a few minutes to reduce the 'assertiveness' of the garlic. I also added about 1/2 of almond pulp and a 1/2 cup of cooked beans as they needed to be used up! Thus just needed a little more liquid in the blender.

Ok so this recipe will get you close.  In my opinion 3 cloves of raw garlic is too much.  I only put two cloves and my tongue was tingling.  And this desperately needs salt.  I easily added a teaspoon of salt to this.  So next time, less garlic and salt and I'll have the best hummus.   Best part is none of the additives and hidden ingredients that you get with the store bought brands.

A good, basic hummus.  I used home cooked garbanzo beans that I soaked overnight, then cooked in a crockpot.  I've discovered that if the hummus seems too lemony, it works to counterbalance the lemon flavor with a little extra salt.

This was an okay start to good hummus.  I felt that as made, it didn't have enough lemon juice or tahini. I upped the lemon juice by one tablespoon and added two more tablespoons of tahini. Also added some salt.  If you want creamy hummus, peel the canned chickpeas before putting them in the food processor. Time consuming, but worth the effort!

My husband and I like this recipe very much but not before  I added more liquid than 1/4 cup, another 1.5 T of lemon juice, and a full teaspoon of cumin.  Next time I'll use more lemon juice or try some lemon zest.  I used the full 3 garlic cloves.  It took all the flavors overnight in the refrigerator to come together for the best result.

Made my own tahini from store bought roasted sesame seeds and olive oil. For personal taste, I added more garlic and lemon juice. Left out the paprika an parsley. Very nice taste and texture.  No pita chips on hand so using wheat thin crackers and veggies. Thanks for the recipe. Very simple to make.

This was my first time making hummus, and it couldn't be any easier! Really, why do people pay so much for a small container of this stuff in the grocery stores, when you can make three times that amount, for less, and it tastes so much better? We really enjoyed this. I do have to say, that the garlic flavor does enhance as it sits. I used 2 pretty small cloves of garlic, and after sitting for a few hours, you can really taste the garlic - so keep that in mind when you are deciding on how much to add. You can always add more, but once it's in there, you can't take it away!

Really good basic recipe.  I didn't drain the can.  Didn't add water.  Did add some avocado (instead of oil), I like more pizang so added more lemon juice.  And also added several green olives.  Holy yum!  And then, I like to pretty it up with some more zing - Frank's Hot Sauce and crumbled feta.  Oh my.

I used unsalted canned chick peas, so I added some salt. Pretty good hummus, and certainly fresher tasting than store-bought.

I will make this again for sure. I made the mistake of adding about 1-2 cloves extra and the recipe really didn't need it. My reason for doing this was to compensate for a doubling of the recipe using 2 X 19 fl. oz. cans of beans. I also added about 1 - 1.5 tsp of salt and extra lemon juice to taste. Thanks! Amanda

We LOVE hummus but I'd never made it before. I'm so glad this was the first recipe I tried! I omitted the parsley (cannot stand it), and added a pinch of salt and a few more TBSPs of water. One quite large clove of garlic is adequate for a single can of garbanzos, imo. Served it with celery sticks and baked pita chips - was gone in five minutes! Thanks for a great recipe!

I will definitely make it my basic humus recipe. I did add some salt to it and next time I will probably add some red pepper...just my preference. This is an excellent recipe.

good flavor.  It's quick and easy to make. I , as another user did, added cayenne and extra garlic.  Will definitely make again.

Hummus is one of my favorite snacks with chips, crackers or veggies, so I was excited to try this recipe. Instead of using all water, I also used the liquid I saved from the beans. I highly recommend doing this. Next time I won't bother with the water and just use the bean liquid.  Also, I erred on the side of caution and only used 1 large clove of garlic and that was plenty.  I had trouble getting this to blend, so I ended up using about double the liquid than called for. This also needed salt to enhance the flavor. A great base recipe and 5 stars with a few tweaks.

I use this basic recipe ... difference being that I do not add the paprika and parsley ... but I do add 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne to the mix and 1/2 tsp. of kosher salt ... and more fresh lemon juice too.

We love this recipe. I used some cayenne pepper, onion powder, and 1 tsp of cumin. I also used only two garlic cloves because I always use jumbo garlic bulbs. I was bummed I only had cannellini beans, not garbanzo. It was still wonderful.

I processed the beans just a bit first so they'd be smoother and added a bit more tahini. This has become a party staple for us!

First time we made this (last week) we followed the recipe to a 'T' and it was AMAZING!  Since we love garlic in our foods (all vampire jokes aside), this week we upped the amount of garlic to 3 tablespoons of minced (about 10 small garlic cloves) and a smidge more water.  Once again.....AMAZING!!

I can eat the whole batch myself!  I agree with the others that this is the perfect base hummus recipe.  The tahini is key.  It thickens as it stands so I usually will add enough of the bean juice to make it a creamy consistency, then it will thicken to a sour cream consistency as it stands.  Add a little olive oil to thin it later if needed.

This is a good recipe albeit basic. I agree with some others that it is a bit bland and three cloves of garlic is too much for my taste.  I only added one large clove and added enough lemon juice instead of adding the water. Also, I used cannellini beans instead of garbanzo which is what I had on-hand. I used a bit of salt and some fresh basal from the garden. Yummy and you can add ingredients to suit your taste.

Here's my story: my 4-year-old daughter loves hummus but has grown to hate store-bought versions, so this is my first attempt at making my own at home, hoping that she might like it again, and she loooooved this! I used 3 small garlic cloves, I think if I used too much more and she would have been put off, and possibly me, too! We also added some salt, per our taste.

dont drain the chickpeas can instead use the water in it, it will make a big difference in the taste, like if you will use two cans drain one & use the other.

This is an easy and tasty recipe! The only thing I would change about it is to use less garlic. That touch of cumin, makes a huge difference. Loved it.

Great, simple, tasty very easy hummus recipe.  Everyone's tastes buds are different, simply adjust to suite yours. The longer you let the food processor do it's work, the creamier the turnout.  Will be making this my go-to hummus recipe. :)
