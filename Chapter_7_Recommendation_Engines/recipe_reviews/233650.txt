This is the first time I've put avocado on a salad, and I discovered I love it! I wanted this salad for my lunch, so I cut it down to 1 serving. Too hard to figure out 1/8 of everything, so I just eyeballed the ingredients and  substituted what I happened to have: green leaf lettuce for the romaine, yellow and orange sweet mini peppers for the green. I used 2 slices of bacon, but bacon makes everything better! I was surprised I liked the lime juice for the dressing. But really, this is a very good and light salad!

I did try this salad but found it lacking in flavor so I changed it a bit and added artichoke hearts and many other ingredients to bring up the flavor.Sometimes I will add chicken or pork to make it a complete meal that my Hubby will enjoy.
