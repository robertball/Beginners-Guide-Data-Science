I made this with fresh okra (sliced then soaked in milk for 15 mins to get rid of the sliminess) and canned diced tomatoes and fresh. This was a nice fresh-tasting side dish. I think some corn would work well with it too. Thanks!

I use fresh okra and add a pinch of sugar to bring out the natural sweetness in the ingredients.  I serve with Tobasco and my husband loves it! Great recipe!

I've made many variations of this side dish, but this one stands out with the cayenne pepper. Being a fan of it, I was extra generous with the amount I used. Very tasty and it had the perfect kick. Well done.

This was really good. I goobered and was going to make something different when I pulled out my okra, But I had them in the steamer and didn't have the ingriedents I needed for the other recipe..so when searching for an okra and tomato recipe and found this. And I also didn't have bell peppers...go figure. But with not having the bell peppers it didn't stop the recipe. I only added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper because my kids were eating it, but all in all simple yet delish recipe. Yummy. I had only one child that didn't eat this, but I expected that. But everyone else enjoyed it. TY

My aunt used to make this all the time and i loved it even though i couldnt stand okra! I decided to make it on my own and it turned out great! I only used diced tomatos and left out the stewed but it was all the same. I also put this over some yellow rice (although the rice was the wrong kind) it turned out really great!

I made this with fresh okra instead of frozen, but otherwise followed the recipe at least to the end. When made, I thought the recipe would have been better with about half of the amount of cayenne pepper, as I thought it overwhelmed the balance of flavors. Normally, the stewed tomatoes will add the sweetness, but in this case (because of the cayenne) it needed some sugar. I added almost a TB before thinking it was back in balance. I'll make it again, but will not add all the pepper called for. BTW: One of the reasons I tried this dish was because of the cayenne. I love hot peppers.

Five stars because someone else told me it is.  I used half the cayenne, which I think is probably enough for most people, but it won't be hot.  Used only a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes but threw in some romas from last summers garden to chunk it up.  Skipped the green pepper and didn't miss it.  This recipe goes well with fish like haddock or tilapia.

Very good!  I would use 1/2 the cayenne pepper next time - a little too hot for our taste.

Methinks it needs some corn; fresh cut off the cob or frozen.  Being of "southern' heritage......some bacon fat is also a needful addition!  Bon appetit ya'll!
If the 'sliminess' of the okra bothers you, add a tad of vinegar and it firms-up the okra nicely.

Great recipe!  My family doesn't like too much heat so I replaced the cayenne with tumeric.  Also left out the green peppers, which I don't think we missed at all.  I didn't have any stewed tomatoes on hand so I used a larger can of diced tomatoes and agree with others that the chunkiness was nice.  Also used fresh okra rather than frozen.

I love summertime for all the wonderful okra and tomatoes! This is a wonderful recipe and yes, fresh corn is really good in it! I've also made a "drier" version of this with chopped, seeded fresh tomatoes and put it in an omelet! Yummy!!

This was good.  I've made it twice now.  The first time around, I loved it.  I was tired of my failed attempts at fried okra and wanted to try something new, and this worked out well.  My second time around, I made it way too spicy (even with red pepper flakes subbed for the cayenne, since I have kids).  The seasoning came out well the first time around, but the second time it was too bland and one-dimensional, aside from the spiciness, I think because of all the canned tomatoes (and I used unseasoned, no salt added ones).  Both times I thought it needed some celery to give it some extra flavor, so I will add that in next time.  I also think maybe I will ditch the pepper flakes altogether and add in some homemade creole seasoning.  It needs more flavor, but definitely not any more heat!

This was really very good.  Used fresh garden tomatoes because I had them.  Added about 1/2 cup celery since I didn't use the stewed tomatoes.  Also added 1/2 cup instant brown rice and 1 cup water to make it a little bit more "substantial".  Will be great for lunch or as a side dish.  Will definitely make again.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love this recipe.  I make it exactly as written except that I add a can of tomatoes with jalapenos instead of plain diced tomotoes.  It is wonderful and tastes even better the next day, after the flavors have developed and blended more.  You won't be disappointed.

This is SOOOO good!  I've made this twice; once straight from the recipe and once with modifications when I was out of some things: halve the cayenne and use salsa instead of stewed tomatoes.  I really preferred it with the salsa and will make it that way from now on.  You can make a ton of mods to this and it still turns out great.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

This recipe is a good way to use okra. Made some really important changes to suite my personal preferences. First of all, the cayenne pepper amount listed here is too intense for me. I cut the amount down to ¼ tsp and added 1 Tbs sugar for a little bit of balance. Fresh okra was also used as opposed to frozen. For those of you worried about the slimy consistency that comes with cooking fresh okra, don’t concern yourself. When cooked, the tomatoes release a liquid which form a sauce that conceal it. 
I’m not the biggest fan of stewed tomato chunks. I replaced it with two fresh diced tomatoes and blended it with the canned diced tomatoes.  Adding ¾ cup of corn not only added a playful color, but some crisp. Season well and cover for the last couple minutes of cooking. This is a nutritious recipe and a nice way to get your veggies in.

this was fantastic!  i put half as much cayenne pepper in b/c my tastebuds can't handle too much spice.  i made a lot of it and kept in in the refridgerator over the course of a week and it seemed to taste better every time.  thanks!!

We will definitely make this again, with about 1/4 amount of the cayenne called for. This recipe was too hot for us. We added sweet corn and some sugar. It was fantastic.

Made this recipe tonight.  I like it because it used frozen okra and that is usually what I have on hand.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper....I used about 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and also crushed red pepper to taste.  I had home canned tomatoes...so I used a I quart jar of those and four fresh chopped small tomatoes.  I didn't need sugar cause these tomatoes are sweet.  I added 1 finely chopped jalapeno.  I used 1 1/2 small onion and 4 big cloves of garlic.  I added extra bottled hot sauce on top when I ate it and it was awesome!

I have never made okra before, but I will be making it again! This was a great recipe. I seem to tweak everything to make it mine,  but this is a wonderful recipe to work with!  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, and the stewed tomatoes. I probably added a bit more garlic, a bit less onion, and a bit more green pepper. I love cayenne, too! I just took it to work as a side dish for Shrimp Etouffee that our boss is making. I'll let you know how it was received!

It is cooking as I am writing this, I only used half of the cayenne, then noticed in the description of the recipe it says crushed red pepper and the recipe says cayenne,big difference, think it would be better with the crushed, I will rate it later

It was great except too spicy for me! I would tone down the cayenne a lot in the future. I love spicy but this was almost to the point where it was hard to eat without lots of water breaks.

I cooked two pieces of bacon and removed from pan, sauteed onion and fresh okra in bacon grease then added ingredients (substituted tomatoes for two cans of rotel) and it was perfect!  Recipe as is needs some spicing up for my taste.

I used fresh okra.  Not all cayenne is equally hot,  At the lower end of hotness perhaps 1 teaspoon might work ok. My cayenne is toward the higher hotness end, and even 1/2 teaspoon gave a pretty good kick, which was very nice.  But anymore and it would have a challenge to enjoy.  Very simple and quick recipe.  I had a little bit of left over ring sausage that I sliced and threw in there and it was great.  Wish I would have had some corn. I love the simplicity of this recipe.

My mom made it all the time when I was a kid. Always reminds me of summer.  My family thought fried was the only way to eat okra but they love this. They have ask for it several times.

Good recipe. I took advice of others and cut the cayenne in half and it still had plenty of heat. I added a little extra garlic after tasting it halfway through cooking and it added a little more flavor. I couldn't get an 8oz can of diced tomatoes, so I used a 14.5oz  size. The few extra tomatoes can't hurt!  Will make this again!

I added Chipotle Beef Sausage, Fiesta Corn, and mexican style Rotel with Lime and Cilantro.  What a winner! My family loved it.
