Chef John, you rock!  This is a great dish that uses pantry foods.  I cut it in half since it's just my husband and me (usually more but we are doing the social distance thing!)  Anyway, it's really a good staple meal.  I cut down on the cayenne and put out the Frank's hot sauce for my hubby which is our usual compromise.
Edit:  normally I don't make changes to the recipes, but since we are in the middle of a pandemic I did.  I used Rotel in place of the salsa.  Worked fine.

Loved it! And I'm not the biggest fan of anything involving beans. Used black beans. I halved the recipe and it made at least 6 servings. Served with sliced avocado and sour cream. I might reduced the salt a little next time. The salsa is what makes this dish so good. It takes 5 minutes to assemble. This will definitely become a staple recipe.
Update: made this again, this time just using water (no broth, because I forgot it) and only 1 cup of rice (for half a recipe). It turned out great, with all of the rice completely cooked. Served in flour tortillas with sour cream.

I love chief John's recipe! I substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I left out the oregano because it is my dads least favorite seasoning. I added 1/4 cup dry onion. It turned out great!!!

I don’t usually leave reviews for recipes on this site, but this is an exception. This is an amazingly easy and comforting dish to make during these rough times. The ingredients are mostly pantry staples and the salsa can be subbed out for canned tomatoes in a pinch (I like Rotel). Chef John came through during this pandemic to create a dish that is maybe “easy”, but definitely comforting and we all need a little comfort, I think!

'Made this first just as written.  Excellent, but I wanted to try it with brown rice.  I kept all measurements the same but used only 2 cups brown rice and added 30 min to the cook time.  It was perfect and maybe just a little healthier.

We made this last night. It may have been the type of rice we used, or a weak foil seal, but we had to about double the fluid (which added cooking time).  

The dish is great. It was hearty and flavorful, and the recipe is easy. We topped it with a little cheese, cilantro and scallions. I added a dollop of sour cream, my spouse added a bit of extra salsa. It would be good as either an entree or a side dish.

The next time I make this I'll halve the recipe because this completely fills a lasagna pan.

My picky family teased me all day because I was making beans and rice. I assured them it was a Chef John. Needless to say this is a great recipe. My husband says he cannot wait to make it again!! I had some leftover sausage that I added. Changed nothing else, came out perfect down the the cook time. Thanks Chef John. You are a rock star in our house.

Love this!  I didn’t have chili powder so used smoked paprika instead, and also halved the recipe and it still made a lot.  So easy and so tasty!

Great recipe, would make again.

Changes I made:

Used 2 cups of water with shredded, grilled, leftover KFC chicken instead of chicken broth since I didn't have any of that.

Subbed some of the chili powder for smoked paprika, and upped the cayenne to 1 teaspoon because we like it super spicy.

Used black beans instead of kidney beans.

Chef John does it again!  This dish was so flavorful and very simple to make. My family loved it and has requested it again.  
I substituted some of the ingredients by using organic brown long grain rice (2.5 cups), vegetable broth, Rotel, crush tomatoes (15 oz) and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper.  I initially cooked it for 1 hour and 30 minutes however the rice was still hard.  I added the remaining vegetable broth (16 oz in total) to add more moisture and cooked the dish an additional 40 minutes.  I let it rest for approximately 15 minutes with the aluminum foil tightly sealed before fluffing the rice mixture with chopped cilantro.  Delicious!!

This was very good!  Flavours were  nice.  I followed the recipe exact but my salsa jar was a little less than in the recipe.  Therefore, mine turned out a bit drier.  I would add a bit more liguid next time.

This is very tasty.  Used basmati  rice and felt that it wasn't cooked as much as it should be.  It could be because I didn't use the tinfoil cover.  I used the glass cover that might have let more of the moisture out of the pan.    Comfortable quick meal with baked chicken.

Surprised at how easy this is to make. I followed the recipe but the red beans looked mushy when I unfolded the foil. I think I need to make the dish again, it could be my setting in the oven. The spices were great, lots of flavor. My daughter couldn’t stop eating it. She added sour cream. Also, for breakfast, she enjoyed the rice and beans with scrambled eggs and avocado. Yum! I can’t wait to add this dish to our regular family options. Thank you Chef John.

This was a tasty dish, but a bit too dry for my taste.  Next time I will add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more of chicken stock.  I liked the basmati rice over typical rice.  Adding oil and tossing it with the rice to evenly coat each grain before cooking really kept the rice nice and light and separated, not clumpy.

Way too much rice for the amount of liquid. I reduced the rice to 2 cups, and still had to add water several times during baking. I am a huge fan of Chef John, but this was a disappointment. In addition to the rice issue, the taste was pretty bland by his standards.

Super nice and easy dish that didn`t require any ingredients not already in the pantry. A really savory and filling dish that I even forgot to add cheese to when eating the first day, when reheating the next day I didn`t bother as nothing was lacking. Thanks Chef John!

Tonight will be the third time making this. It is my new favorite thing. Perfect fluffy rice and meaty beans. I added a can of sweet corn last time and will add it again. It's so delicious and feeds two of us at least 3 times.

This was delish!  I made half a recipe using brown rice.  I were an extra 1/2 c of broth as whole grains need a little more liquid.  This is yummy on it's own, but I put some homemade veggie chilli on top!  Wow!  Froze in small portions.  Thanks for the tasty,  easy peasy, recipe!

After reading the reviews I decided to cut the ingredients in half, except for the chicken broth.  I skipped the cayenne pepper and used only a teaspoon of chili powder because I can’t take that much heat.  I checked it after about 45 minutes, and most of the rice was cooked and plump, except for a layer lying under the beans and salsa in the center of the dish.  I gave it another 15 or 20 minutes and the rice in the center was done.  Like one other reviewer said, the finished product seemed like too much rice in proportion to the beans and salsa.  I may use only a cup of rice if I make it again.  I have enough ingredients since I bought enough to make the whole recipe.  Spices were good.  I hoped it wouldn’t be too salty, since I used 2 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon to make the 2 cups of broth.  Nope, not too salty.  I’m glad I cut the recipe in half this first time making it.

I made this in an 11x17 baking dish. I feel like 9x13 would have been too small. I added a piece of Polska kielbasa I had left over from the Hungarian sausage and potato soup also by chef John. I used half the cayenne and this tastes great! Thank you CJ!

We have made this dish about 10x since Chef John posted his video. It is absolutely a staple for us now and it never gets old! Since there are two of us, we can get 3 meals out of this one.  The first night we have it as-is, the 2nd night we have it in tortillas, and the 3rd night we eat it like dip, with tortilla chips, sour cream, and guacamole. I've made this dish with short grain rice (calrose) and I don't have to adjust the liquids or cooking time. It comes out perfect! I've also made it with homemade beans instead of canned (black and pinto) and it's wonderful. The only consistent substitution we make is to use a can of Rotel for the salsa, which gives it even more heat. I just dump the Rotel in a 2 cup measuring cup and fill it with a little extra water until it hits the 16 ounce line, since this recipe calls for 16 ounces of salsa. It's perfect every single time. I can't recommend this one enough-- the flavors are better then any other beans & rice dish I've tried, and baking the beans and rice give the dish a superior texture vs. stove top.

Family loved it- I had to add an additional cup of chicken broth and cook it another 20 minutes.  (So am not sure how people got it to cook through using the recipe as written.)  I thought it was spicy, my husband thought it wasn't spicy enough LOL.  Next time I will reduce the cayenne by 1/2 and just let my husband add hot sauce - which he did anyway.

This was delicious.  I halved the recipe and cooked in a 9x9 glass dish. I used Better Than Bouillon and water since I didn't have any chicken broth. I also used a little paprika along with the ground chili pepper and other spices (my husband added cayenne at the table). We had only about a third of a 16 oz jar of salsa (need to buy more!) but I think next time I will add tomatoes or Rotel because that wasn't enough. It turned out a little dry but that was probably because my foil didn't seal tightly enough. Added can of black beans to the leftovers and have more than enough for another meal. Also used Fage yogurt and cheddar cheese for the toppings. Chef John, I've been making your sourdough bread for 2 months - it's super with black olives and the discard makes great crackers.

Amount of broth listed is wrong. 2 cups of liquid is not right for 3 cups of rice. Ratio is 2 to 1 water to rice. Even accounting for the liquid in the salsa it resulted in hard rice at the end of cook time. I added 2 cups each broth and water and baked another 40 minutes and it was delish.

This was fantastic!  Unfortunately, I forgot to cover it before baking.  Because of this mistake, I cooked it longer and added liquid to it (I used tomato sauce and water).  I saved it!!!  I served it with corn muffins, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Delish.  I plan to eat the leftovers as dip for nacho chips!!!  I don't care for too much "heat", so I omitted the optional cayenne.

No salsa in the house.  So I replaced with: 3/4 cup of a canned pasta sauce (No spices) and 1/4-1/3 cup of taco sauce and 1tsp of onion powder. I omitted cayenne.  Used regular long grain rice. Added shredded cheddar cheese to just melted after removing the foil and a dollop of sour cream on each serving.  No cilantro so I used fresh chopped parsley. Ahh the quarantine.  Baked for 1 hour at 360 in a heavy baking dish. Was perfect.  I will make again and add shredded chicken before serving next time.  If I can get chicken! My kids used a soft tortilla to scoop up the rice.  Texture was outstanding.

Halved the recipe and it still made a ton - used as a side with tacos. It was easy to throw together and tasty but might not make again because kids were not too keen on it. They are picky and not fans of casserole-type dishes, so not the fault of the recipe...

Made this 2 times, the first time the rice never got all the way cooked even though I kept adding more broth and increased the baking time to an extra 40 minutes, it was too dry and there was not enough beans for me, but it had a great taste but it took a lot of re-engineering it aftwards to make it somewhat eatable because the rice never cooked until I fiddled

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe since it was only my husband and I . I used black beans instead of kidney beans and regular Carolina long grain white rice.  The seasonings were perfect. No cheese needed. Did put a dollop of sour cream on them and could use corn and tortilla chips but definitely delicious just as it's written!

This was awesome, however if your not a fan of spicy food like me, this is what i did to fix that. Use only 1/2 of the chili pepper and no cayenne. Then subsistute tomato salsa for Peach Mango salsa. Also my rice did not finish in 1:10 min, it was twice the amount of time, so i will pre cook the rice next time, or even look at using a crocpot

Yummmmmm! This is a keeper. Followed others’ suggestions and used two cups of brown rice. I love so planned to use black beans but the store was out so grabbed  three cans of tri-beans  (a mix of pinto, kidney and black beans). Cooked up very nicely in my Instapot. Topped with a bit of cheese and extra salsa. Hubby loved it as well but asked me to up the beans so will add four cans next time ... and there WILL be a next time. Thanks, Chef John!

How easy and tasty and quick ! I did doctor it up a bit with garlic and onion powder, a pinch more of salt. Used a little more chicken broth.  Not as much chili powder , mild salsa, no cayenne pepper to avoid it being too spicy.  Suit it too your own taste. Did half the recipe. This is a great side dish any time . This is a keeper.

I had short grain sushi rice so I used that instead (it's what I had). This still turned out really good, not mushy at all like I expected.

Everyone in the family really liked this! We added lettuce, cheese, sour cream and tomatoes. (I would say adding sour cream topping is a must. I’ll exclude cheese next time since we couldn’t taste it over the other flavors.)

I made this with short grain brown rice cuz that's what I had on hand and cooked it an extra 45 minutes and added water a few times.  I think next time for this rice I'll double the broth!

Chef John strikes again with another winner!

No changes. I used medium Salsa and a little Cayenne - it was very spicy! But good. A little on the dry side.

Hit the spot! Easy and delicious. I added chunks of smoked sausage and highly recommend. It was a little dry, so I would add more liquid next time. Not sure if that was because I used regular long grain rice (instead of basmati) or the sausage.

Very tasty. I think I'll tweak the rice content (1/2 cup less) and bean content (a third can) when I make this again. Heavy on the rice for my taste, but the spices are great. You can toss on all kinds of toppings with the recipe - I added chopped green onions and extra salsa on the top when taken to a friend's party.

I halved the recipe, making it for only 2. I put it in a 1 and 1/2 qt pyrex dish covered tightly with foil. I checked it almost 1 hr in. Rice was not near done and appeared dry. Added more chicken broth and salsa. 1 hr, 30 min in the rice still had a little crunch. Took it out of the pyrex and spread it out more into a 13x9 and added yet more liquid. After more than 2 hrs the rice was still not completely done and the dish was dry. Im not sure what else I could have done. It had good flavor, though. I may try making this again using different rice and less of it. I used the exact ingredients but half of all to start. Im open to suggestions as to what went wrong. I'm a pretty decent cook normally.

Good recipe to go meatless with and it has great flavor. We used canned lentils, canned chickpeas and diced tomato instead of black beans and salsa. I will try the recipe again and maybe try adding frozen shrimp.

EASY EASY EASY meal to make using pantry staples.  We didn't have salsa, so subbed a 15-ounce can of diced tomatoes and slightly increased the seasonings.  Very good!  Would make this again for a crowd..... that is, if we'll ever get to be in a crowd again.  ; )

Great technique. When I went to the pantry there were no  red kidney beans so I used cannellini and the salsa was very hot so I skipped the cayenne. I'll be sure to have a less aggressive salsa and kidney beans in the pantry as I'll surely make this again.

Delicious! It seems simple, but it’s really very tasty! I used 3 T of olive oil instead of the 4 and we didn’t miss the extra, plus skipped the optional cayenne. I made it in a casserole dish slightly bigger than 9x13” with an extra cup of water and 5 more minutes of baking time (high altitude). Thank you for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! I halved the recipe and I think I added to much cayenne because it was more on the spicy side so that just meant I ate it with more sour cream so it was still absolutely delicious. I also served it with pulled beef to make it like a burrito bowl and now I'm thinking I won't need to ever get Mexican take-away again.

I followed the recipe as is with one exception, Im not a big fan of Cumin so I used one teaspoon in stead of two.  This dish is amazing. So full of flavor and easy to make.  Who knew using salsa would taste so good in rice.  I put some cooked ground Italian Sausage in it after it was done.  It turned it into a main dish.  Fantastic. Thank you Chef

We love this, especially with homemade guacamole, but even on its own. We make it exactly as is Except that we use our pressure cooker. If you want to use a pressure cooker leave the salsa and canned beans out till after cooking the rice or you’ll get a burn notice. There’s enough residual heat after the rice cooks and the beans and salsa are already cooked. You then do 3cups broth to 3cups rice

Excellent and very simple meal. You must keep the foil over the casserole while baking as a regular lid will not keep the liquid in and rice will be undercooked.

Thank you Chef John, my family are very picky eaters and they dislike meatless Monday's how ever this recipe truly lived up to the Best meatless Monday entree as evidenced by the multiple helpings by all members of the family including my wife!
I did use one can of Kidney beans plus one can of black beans.The cayenne pepper provides the perfect amount of heat. The only other comment like many of the other reviewers this must have a tight Aluminum foil around the edge and even then I would add an extra 1/4 cup of water. This recipe was printed out and put in my binder of ten out of ten go to recipes that are fast ,easy, healthy and inexpensive to make.

I am making for the second time tonight - both kids requested it!  It is so easy and delicious.  Baking rice is the greatest idea and wish I had learned this method sooner :-). Served it with cheese, sour cream, green onions, and cilantro.  If my daughter was not a vegetarian, I would love to try it with ground beef or chicken.

I made a few adjustments. 

I used 1tbsp of taco seasoning, instead of the spices. 
Did half black, half kidney beans. 
Added a tin of chicken. 
Finished the dish with diced pimento olives. 

I ended up cooking mine for 1hr and 30 min and added a quarter cup more liquid when I found the rice wasn’t done and it was getting dry. 

The original looked delicious and is a great base for any number of variations.

I was a bit worried  after reading reviews but following the recipe exactly, even with regular foil, it was perfect at the end of the recommended cooking time.  Will be making this again. Thanks Chef John for another winner!

Very very dry.  If I made it again I would add less rice with same amount of wet ingredients.  Some salsa are rather thick so that may have been the problem.  I also used black beans.  Would not use them again as they too were quite dry.

6/8/20. Made with following changes:  eliminated the oregano, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth since daughter is a vegetarian, and added taco sauce to the salsa since I didn't have a full 8 ounces of salsa.  This was fantastic!  The recipe cut in half easily feeds five people.   This will be in our rotation from here on out! Yum!

Also sprinkled some Trader Joe's Chili Lime seasoning on top. The family had huge 2nd servings.  This will go into my regular rotation,  just like Chef John's baked fried rice, which I have made several times! Thank you!

This is good, easy and cheap to make.  I did not care for the kidney beans.  Next time I will make it with pinto or black beans.  This is a great meal by itself, but it also would go great served alongside tacos, fajitas and any other Mexican meal that you want beans and rice with.  For this particular meal, I served it with Cilantro Lime Coleslaw from this site and a can of corn.

This recipe was a great start.  I used brown rice and au jus from a pork butt that I had cooked and skimmed the fat off.  Gave it a great flavor.   I will definitely make it again, and will use the chicken broth if I don’t have au jus in the fridge to use up.

I halved the recipe.  I could only find white kidney beans, and I ommitted the chili powder as my friend doesn't like spicy.  I think next time I will add some additional seasoning and maybe even a lil cooked tomatoe paste.  Good recipe to tweak to your liking.

Easy and delicious. It makes quite a bit so I made only 1/2 a recipe.  It has wonderful flavors and smells terrific. Leftovers reheat well in a rice cooker with a little added water. I did leave out the cayenne pepper because the salsa was very hot. This recipe is a keeper.

First time I made this I messed up completely by using dry beans and not soaking them for long enough and using too much of them

Second time I made one or two alterations: The rice I kept the same, I only used one can of beans (I used black), and I had only one can of chicken stock so I added a can of no bean turkey chili along with some water to clean out the can because there's less liquid in the chili than in a can of chicken stock. 

Wow. When I took this out of the oven it smelled amazing, and when I tasted it for seasoning it was incredible. Highly recommend adding half the chicken stock along with a can of chili and about half the chili can's worth of water.

This was delicious!! My family loved it! We all had eaten two helpings before we even realized. 

I prepared it with a simple chicken curry. I did make a few substitutions based on what I had in the pantry. I used store bought garlic spaghetti sauce in place of the salsa and a quality Italian seasoning in place of the oregano. 

Oven cooking makes perfect tomato rice in my experience and coating it with olive oil first made sure it was flavorful and cooked evenly. It was also great to have the stove top space. I put in the oven, set the timer and forgot about it! It did require about an extra 30mins in my oven, but that was not a problem.

Thank you for this recipe! Well done!

You really have to keep the foil on it- So, it will not dry out.   I  liked it, but it made a lot for two people .

There is something about the combination of rice and beans that I love.   This was excellent and so easy.   And my super-picky husband also loved it.    I cut the recipe in half, and didn't have any salsa so just used tomato sauce, and added turmeric and coriander because cumin, coriander and turmeric are a combo I alway use.   Came out great.  I've already made it twice.

Family loved it!  The only rice I had was for sushi but it worked.  I used black beans.  All the flavors came together so nicely and you can't beat how easy it was to make.

The flavours were okay and it was easy to make but it was very dry. Not sure if I’ll be making it again... if so, some changes will be necessary

I halved the recipe and changed the portion of rice to liquid because of the other reviews - 1 1/2 cups rice and 2 cups broth and also  halved the beans and salsa otherwise kept the spices whole. It made for a very spicy delicious rice and it cooked perfectly.

Love it!  I can only imagine how good it would be with sour cream!  And the servings are huge!  Keep doing the quarantine recipes, Chef John (I've used a lot of your recipes when it wasn't quarantine time).   :)  Had to use what I had; no salsa, but had some Rotel, and I used 1 can (made 1/2 the recipe, as I live alone).    Also had cheddar cheese, no jack.  Everything else was the same.

Followed the recipe to the T.
 Way too much rice! 70 minutes and under done...added more liquid and 20 mins more...not right! If I do this again, I’ll do it in a pot...kick up the spices and add sausage, chicken, etc. Surprised that onion, peppers - and even garlic were not included! I see remarks that, “pre-cooking” the rice was highly suggested. Going to that length, you may as well make the traditional recipe - Cajun Style!

A little disappointed at the texture.  The rice is very dry and brittle.  I feel like it would have worked better over the stove top.  I followed recipe to a t and had to add 40 min extra to cooking.  The flavor is good.

I loved the flavor of the rice. It ended up a bit dry, so next time I'm not going to drain the beans. I used pinto beans, just because my hubby and I prefer them over kidney beans. A great and tasty dish.

This is a great side dish for Jay's Jerk Chicken.   The recipe as written makes about 12 servings in a 9x13 dish.  I cut everything in half, except I add a full can of chicken broth.  Otherwise it's a bit dry.  Love this recipe though.  It is a quick and easy side dish.

I'm cooking at high altitude-1 mile to be exact! I had to add more liquid and bake longer. Wonderful flavor!

This is an amazing way to cook rice!  So simple and very hands off. I’ve made this twice and both times it took an extra 10 mins but came out perfect. Only complaint is it makes a ton of rice, consider halving the recipe.
