This is really good, a refreshing difference from bottled salsa.  I did add corn to ours.  We also decided this tasted better the next day, but the dressing was too strong tasting after only a couple of hours. So I tried it again with 1/2 Italian dressing and 1/2 roasted red pepper vinegret dressing.  We really liked that.  I also used red, yellow and orange bell peppers, and a couple of times a bit of avacado. I Will definitely be using the recipe regularly.

I originally tasted this while living in San Antonio.  The recipe I was given used 1 each green, yellow and red bell peppers, and diced tomatoes instead to make it easier to scoop and dip.  Looks like confetti - great for a party!  One thing is missing: be sure to add a can of hominy.  Serve with Frito's for true Texas flavor.

I made this for a barbeque tonight.  I added a few extra jalapenos and no coriander because I didn't have any and put just a bit of dried cilantro.  Very good recipe.

yum, tasty and lively presentation with all the different bright colors.  One change I made was to substitute the black beans for a small can of mexi-corn, otherwise I thought it to "beany".  Also, used a red onion instead of yellow.  Substituted a can of petite diced tomatoes drained for fresh, (just for ease).  I also seeded the jalapeno peppers so it wasn't too hot.  Serve with corn chips for the authentic texas way.  Great party appetizer!

I made this recipe as stated, and it was wonderful. I made with fat free dressing, and a co-worker made this recipe with regular dressing, and it tastes much better with the regular dressing.  Wonderful recipe!  Need to let it sit for a couple hours to let the flavors blend together.

For convenience, used 1 can petit diced tomatoes, drained, instead of cherry tomatoes.  Added 1 can of yelloe corn for color.  Followed suggestion of other reviewers and added the juice of one lime.  Got a lot of compliments on this dish.  Definitely a keeper.

I took this to a New Year's party, and it was a HUGE hit! I changed a few things, just to make it a little easier on myself. I used fresh black-eye peas instead of canned and a bunch of parsley instead of cilantro (some people are weird about cilantro), and a can of fire-roasted tomatoes for extra flavor and less prep time. I also seeded one of the jalapenos, and it was neither too hot nor too bland. And I let it sit a day to blend the flavors. Thanks for a great recipe that will be one of my go-tos for parties and potlucks!

Delicious.  I made this without the ground corriander.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes-- but then ended up adding 3 chopped plum tomatoes.  Next time I will cut back a little on the salad dressing-- perhaps pouring out an ounce or two of the oil in the salad dressing.  It gives off alot of liquid and with the salad dressing there's even more liquid.  It's definitely better after it has set up-- but not more than 3 days.  I ended up throwing a bit of it out on the third day.  I am planning a party and will be using this recipie-- it really is delicious

There must be a misprint in the way the recipe is written. It says (correctly) that it makes 8 cups. But then it says that it makes 64 servings. That's a one ounce serving! Most people will want more than that! Just keep it in mind.

Wonderful and fresh taste!  I did substitue pinto beans for the black, and added a couple of cups of grated jack/cheddar mix cheese.  What a great, cool dish to serve this summer too!

I made a variation of this recipe for an office party, and it was a huge hit.  I used black beans, blackeyed peas, picante beans, white navy beans, and regular navy beans.  I also added shoepeg corn and used 4 jalapenos instead of 2.

This always goes fast.  I omitted the green bell pepper and coriander and added a can of whole kernal corn to the mix. I have used dried cilantro instead of fresh and it is pretty darn good as well. It is really a tasty and refreshing dip.

This was a VERY good recipe and I will definitely make it again.  I tasted it before and after I added the cilantro and I liked it better without (even though I love cilantro).  I will either leave it out next time or at least cut back on the amount it calls for because it really over-powered the rest of the flavors.

Make this recipe even better by doing the following: 
Drain the "caviar" mixture before serving.
Spread an 8 ounce box of cream cheese on a plate, and gently layer the caviar on top of it.
People will eat this up and the cream cheese also mellows a little of the spice even if you go a little crazy with the jalapeno!

This was great!  Using half black beans & half black-eyed peas was perfect and tastes much better than some other recipes I saw using all peas.  I did fiddle a little based on some other reviews:  I did not use tomatoes since family members don't like them; I added corn instead.   Kept the seasonings the same except put in red onion (for some color) and used a couple tablespoons of recaito (cilantro base; in ethnic foods aisle) since I had no fresh cilantro on hand.   I like using recaito since I find I can use less salad dressing that way & cut down on fat.   I will definitely make this again -- maybe today :-).

This makes a LOT of dip!  Make sure it is a big party!  It was really good though.  We had to take it to our New Year's Eve party in the trunk though because the smell will knock you over.  I think a little bit of lime juice would add something.  I didn't use the coriander either and I don't think we missed it.

This is a very easy and very delicious salad.  Feel free to adjust vegetables to what you have on hand; this is a very flexible recipe.  Also, instead of using cherry tomatoes, I used a drained can of diced tomatoes.

Yup, this was phenomenal. I don't know if I was supposed to seed the jalapenos, but I did. I don't mind a little kick, but didn't want it to be too spicy. I also lightly rinsed the beans and peas so the mixture wouldn't be too gooey. It turned out perfect and got rave reviews at the Superbowl party I attended. I'm not even a big fan of bean dips, but this is a healthy snack that I'll definitely make again.

I have made many dfferent variations of this recipe.  They have all been good.  This one is no exception.  Very colorful!  Pretty healthy with lots of veggies and fiber from beans/peas.  I used an olive oil based italian dressing.  Can used baked chips.

I made this for an open house party we had at our business.  I made a ton of different stuff from truffles to shrimp dip.  This was hands down the favorite with everyone.  People just couldn't get enough.  I served this in scoops with about a tablespoon in each.  It looked fabulous too.  Thank you.

Great! I don't know anybody who doesn't like this stuff. I used 4 oz. only of Ken's Zesty Italian, 2 jalapenos didn't make it too hot (and I don't like "hot"); used dried cilantro, canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh; needs to sit at least 2 hrs., but the longer the better; served with tortilla chips - so yummy!

Excellent! We added Cumin instead of coriander (did not have on hand). Also added 1/4 cup of lemon juice and a dash of lemon salt shavings. I roasted the jalapenos in the over first. Serving this tomorrow night with thinly sliced sour dough baguette slices.

I made this in addition to my "famous" salsa, and everyone preferred this!!  Including me!  I added a whole onion, a can of diced jalepenos, and no cilantro.  I couldn't wait to try it, so marinating it for an hour didn't happen.  In my opinion, it didn't need it.  It was pretty much gone in an hour anyway!  Very good.  Will be a staple at all bar-b-ques from now on!

Too hot to cook -- well I prepared this for a bbq last night, placed it in a beautiful glass salad bowl served with a fancy assortment of tortilla chips and whamoo! friends went nuts! This is a five star, refreshing, divine dish! Thanks so much from someone who cooks for a living and is always expected to impress with unique and wonderful creations. BTW red onions made it especially pretty.

I make this a lot, but one thing I like to do  to these types of bean, corn, Tex-mex salsas is to use some Sprite/ 7-Up, any citrus soda I have on hand it gives it an extra interesting flavor!

This is a staple at every party and get together I have.  I change it up a bit every time I make it.  But it's a favorite!  I always add a red pepper and a half a red onion for more colour - it ends up being a pretty good looking dish.  Serve it in a wide white bowl and you are set!

WOW!  What a big hit!  At my dinner club, this was the recipe that the guests wanted to take home with them.  I kicked it up a little with more jalapeno and garlic but other than that this recipe is a winner!!!

This was quite tasty. With that being said I had to sub ingredients for very similar ones I had in the house. I also did a half a recipe but kept the amount of beans the same as the full recipe and used low-sodium ones. I didn't have a green pepper but had yellow and used that. It gave it a nice sweet after taste, so I guess that was a good substitution. I left out the jalepeno because I don't like dishes too hot, but it still had a slight kick to it anyway. I had black beans for the recipe, but no black eyed peas, so I used pinto beans in place of them. I used a regular tomato in place of the cherry tomatoes and I didn't have cilantro so I left the garnish off. Regardless, of any changes I made out of convenience, it went really well with baked corn chips and there was no complaints. The only downside is it didn't refridgerate to well, I thought, so I would only make what would be eaten that day. It is best fresh in my opinion.

Very good, I did add the mexicorn. I think some more Jalapenos might be good to add some more kick to it. But I like my food a little on the spicy side.

This is going to be a summer dish hit! I just made this pretty much as instructed but I omitted one jalapeno and added a can of baby white/yellow corn. Yum, yum, yum! I wanted to let it sit overnight so I can serve at a function tomorrow, but my husband, my oldest son and me kept eating it as soon as it was made. I know it will be even tastier tomorrow after the flavors marry. I can't wait to take this to upcoming summer outings. Maybe I should take copies of the recipe....just in case. :-)

I used mixed color bell peppers (red, orange, yellow and green) since I was also using them for Fajitas and had bought the mixed peppers.  That with the other colors made it beautiful.  As always I used some salt, a little cajun spice and a dash of hot sauce because the jalapenos alone at first didn't seem to make it hot enough.  Well, good thing we like it hot.  As it sat the next couple of days in the fridge it got even better and hotter.  So good.  I'd come home from work and just have some with chips!  A real treat!

Great recipe. I couldn't find canned black eyed peas so I used a 2nd can of black beans.  I also added a can of corn for color and crunch.  The fresh cilantro makes this recipe so fresh and tasty.  It makes a ton so I used the leftovers for dinner the next night in a tortilla with chicken.  Perfect.

Very Good. Made with fat free zesty italian dressing. I do like the olive oil and sugar version of this recipe better but this is much healthier and only 2 WW points for 1/2 cup portion! (with no-fat dressing)

What a wonderful surprise! The colors are ery inviting and the taste is soo fresh! I made it and ate it alone (added avocado), in tortillas as part of a quesadilla and with chips. I can't wait to put it on top of some grilled chicken or steak.

I doubled the recipe and used a half of a green, red, yellow, and orange bell pepper. Instead of  the cherry tomatoes I substituted two cans of Rotel. Delicious recipe!

Wonderful as a salsa or bean medley side dish.  I served it with tortilla chips but it was so tasty it stands on its own two feet.   My guests loved this recipe and I will definitely make again.  Thank you for the contribution!

This dish wouldn't be complete for me if I didn't add a can of corn.  Sometimes I also add avocados to the mix.  Anytime I have this at a party or a dinner, it always gets rave reviews.  Plus, it is relatively healthy compared to most other dips!

I made two alterations: I doubled the amount of black beans, and used lime salad dressing instead of Italian.   I'm from Texas, so there's just something about Mexican food and limes that go together.  I also let this marinate overnight be fore I serve it.  Can't tell you how many people have emailed me for this recipe!  So good!!!

Very good recipe, but be forwarned: quality of ingredients really makes or breaks this recipe. I made it the first time as written, with fresh tomatoes, and it was absolutely devoured. I made it again, with canned tomatoes and the results were drastically different. It barely got touched. If you are going to use canned tomatoes, make sure they are a good quality, preferably with the coated lining that prevents the tomatoes from taking on "that canned tomato taste."

Fabulous! I've made this twice with a few variations using the comments of others. I added a can of corn and used a can of petite diced tomatoes. I also added fresh lime juice and some garlic - I like spicy. I didn't use the entire bottle of dressing - just enough for a good coating.

I made this without the black-eyed peas since I don't like them, and used Fat Free Italian Dressing.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

Very good!  I skipped the black beans (because I don't like them) and added a can of mexi-corn instead.  It makes a lot but tastes good for a couple of days.

The whole family loves  this, especially my boyfriends son (3rd grade) who took it to his class and shared it with them, they also loved it.  I like to add a bit of chopped olives and a can of corn just for color and to mellow the somewhat acidic taste (and feel) of the dip.

I can't get enough of this!  I used a can of diced tomatos with jalapenos (for simplicity) & added about 2.5 T of garlic.  My family loves garlic, so if you like it a bit milder stay with the recipe amount.

This was fantastic!!! I will make this in place of salsa, and it is great for a side dish. My picky son tried it before I could let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours and he couldn't stop eating it.

This was really good except for the fact that I sent DH to the store for the cilantro and he came home with mint!  He also told me the "cilantro" cost 3.99 (which it didn't).  I'd love to try this with the cilantro next time!  I didn't use the mint! :)

I took this to a potluck & everyone loved it. I only had 2 cans of black beans with jalapeno bits so I skipped the jalapenos. Seemed like too much onion with green onions & regular onions so I just used the green. I made my own Italian Dressing using the Italian Dressing Mix recipe on here. Skipped the coriander. Added an avacado, Delish!

Great recipe! I served this on a platter in Tosititos 'Scoop' chips on New Year's Day, along w/champagne and a plate of water crackers, cream cheese & caviar. It was great! I then some more for a friend who had just moved into her new house (last weekend), and I also plan to serve  it tomorrow at a book club (eve of MLK Jr. holiday) - all for good luck. My friends & I should hopefully have lots of prosperity this year.....

This is always a hit. Very colorful and flavor is great. I always make it at least 6 hours ahead.   A tip if you have leftovers: I used it in soup. Add bean dip to following ingredients: 1 can chicken broth, 1 can of tomato soup, 1 cup salsa, 2 cups chopped chicken, chili powder, cumin. Simmer for 30 minutes and you have a delicious chicken chili.

I just made this for a party and got raves reviews. 
I skipped the coriander and bell pepper, I took another reviewer's advice and used a small can of petite canned tomatoes. I only added about 2-3 oz of zesty Italian salad dressing and added the juice of one very juicy lime. 
I was sure to drain and rinse the beans before I used them so they were not too sticky. 
This one is a keeper for sure -easy and yummy!

I've made this dip numerous times, but I usually skip the green onions, cilantro and coriander because it's not something I keep on-hand.  It's always a crowd pleaser.  Use red onion for color and throw in a can of Rotel instead of the cherry tomatoes.  Goes great with Scoops. Yum!

This was excellent. I served it for my 4th of July party and everyone loved it. I love all the fresh ingredients! I also just add enough italian dressing to coat. I have added corn, it's good either way. I use multi colored peppers. I am a BIG fan of chips and salsa, and I haven't bought salsa again after I discovered this! I often whip this up to take to work or serve along side supper, its a good way to get your veggies. I have made it with just black eyed peas,tomato,sweet onion,jalapeno, and dressing, cause thats all I had and I was craving this! It tasted great like that too. Great recipe!!

this recipe is very similar to one I have from a 5 star cookbook.  the instructions state to let it sit for 3 days (stirring daily) before serving (at room temp is best) so the flavors blend together.  - that is really the key element here.  tried it before then, and the flavors were okay, bland ...  so much more flavorful if you let it sit. I also add a can of yellow hominy, only 4 oz of zesty italian dressing, no coriander or cilantro.  I use the scoop tostitos, they work best to scoop up the flavors.  for any food day at work, i have to bring this dish - - it's addicting..

I made this for a housewarming and it was a huge hit.  I left out the coriander and it wasn't missed.  I chopped up the cilantro when I mixed it that morning and it was fine.  I know it's a dip but I treat it like a salad and eat it straight out of the bowl!  :)

Tasted so fresh and tasty! We ate it with tortilla chips, and then used it as filling for chicken wraps. I added corn, and the mixture of sweet and spicy was awesome. If I was going to a BBQ and was bringing an appie - this is what I would bring.

Excellent!  I left out the tomatoes (not a fan) and added a can of corn. I made this last weekend for a Labor Day cookout and will make it again this weekend for a football party. Go Ravens!

Delicious! As a poor college student, I made this for a little party and everyone loved it! I also snack on it when I should be studying.  I also added corn, just because I liked the color. I would definitely not put as much salad dressing in there as the recipe calls for, mine was way too strong at first, so I drained some off. Now it's delicious, especially after sitting and marinading all night. I also put shredded cheese on the top for fun, it's great :) definitely going to make it again

I made this for a friend who needed a dish for a party and didn't have time to cook.  It was a big hit.  I have tried it both with regular and low fat dressing and honestly couldn't tell a big difference.  My 17 year old daughter loved it too, and plans to whip some up at her Girl Scout summer camp next week.  Great with corn or tortilla chips, and even good in pita as a sandwich.  Make it up the day before for extra flavor.    I have found it keeps at least two weeks in the refrigerator.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!  Had it at a party as a dip and promptly asked for the recipe.  It was THAT good.  Anyways, I made it the next day here at home.  I've put it in baked potatoes, quesadillas, omelets, microwave nachos (yeah, I'm classy like that)... I've yet to find something it's NOT good with.  Ok, my 2.5 year old refuses to eat it, but that's a whole different story.  =)

Absolutely wonderful! We love to sit on our porch in Colorado on a sunny summer day with this dish, a great glass of iced tea or sangria. Add a little fresh lime when serving for an added fresh taste.

Easy & awesome!  We also added 1 can of mexi-corn for an extra crunch.  And a little cayenne pepper for added kick.  You can tailor this recipe to your tastes very easily.  Will definitely make this one again.

Everyone except my daughter really enjoyed this (she's just going through one of those phases where she doesn't want to try anything "different").    I couldn't find cherry tomatoes, so I bought grape tomatoes instead.  I didn't use all of the tomatoes because I'm not fond of uncooked tomatoes.  But after it sat for a day, the tomatoes really mellowed out, and it might have been okay.  And I skipped the cilantro, because no one in our house likes it.    I  will be making this again today.  This time I'll be using cherry tomatoes.  :-)  Thanks for the recipe -- what an easy and tasty way to feed my husband his black-eyed peas!

**May 4, 2010 UPDATE!**
Some of the moms were putting together snacks for the teachers' lounge (it's teacher appreciation week).  I took a double batch of the Texas Caviar and a couple bags of tortilla chips.  My daughter's teacher and one of the librarians both e-mailed me before noon asking for the recipe, and I was stopped by two more teachers this morning . . . again asking for the recipe.  And I was worried that no one would like it!  They said it didn't last long at all.  Thanks again for the excellent recipe!

Adding coriander and fresh cilantro is like adding garlic powder and fresh garlic. Try cumin instead for a smokey falvor..the fresh cilantro is awesome. Add a squeeze of 1/2 a lime and can of corn for a twist.

I added an extra jalapeno, and used half a bunch of cilantro.  I think next time I will also use maybe only 4 ounces of dressing, and add more if needed, it is hard to take away!  

Also, I used leftovers on top of spinach for a yummy salad for lunch or dinner!, (addition:  two days later, I mixed what was left with some quinoa (or you could use orzo, or small pasta), and made a pasta salad with it....we ate every last bite of this!)

Pretty good, I've never had black eyed peas before, but they aren't bad. I also added an extra jalapeno and a bit more cilantro. I made this a day ahead, and the next day, I drained everything before I served it. Everyone really liked this.

Awesome recipe! My 2 year old toddler and meat and potatoes husband both loved it.  Instead of Italian dressing I used 1/2 bottle of New man's Own Light Lime Vinagerrete and I added 1 avocado.  Delicious as a side dish, a dip with tortilla chips, or atop mixed greens for a hearty salad.

Texas Caviar I Haiku: "Words cannot describe, just how amazing this was! Was a party hit." I chilled mine longer in the fridge than 2 hrs. which made it better (and even better yet, hrs. after our party ended and we went sniggling at what few leftovers remained.) We ate our's w/ Fritos' Scoops, and couldn't have been happier w/ the results. Just. Wow. Really. Wow.

Made this for the Super Bowl as a healthier option and it was a big hit!  Followed recipe exactly except the supermarket was out of scallions, and I couldn't find black-eyed peas.  I ended up using one can pinto beans, one can black beans, one can garbanzo beans, and one can hominy.  I also reduced the Zesty Italian dressing to about a half bottle.  The fresh cilantro is a MUST....so good!

I made it with all the ingredients listed minus the Coriander and added another Jalapeno because we like it hot. 

It is absolutely fabulous!
I will be making this at least once a month. 
And as others have stated. It is better the next day.

Very tasty.  Only needs 1/2  the salad dressing or it's swimming.  Great if you add feta cheese and red and green peppers.

Very good. Had to make a couple changes based on what I had available. I used about 1/2 cup of dressing and that was plenty strong. I also used pinto and black beans, and added some corn. Excellent as a dip and we heated the leftovers and put it over rice.

I made this for Christmas with tortilla chips.  It was a hit.  My sister and sister-in-law both asked for the recipe.  I did change a few things.  I did not add as much onion as it called for - personal preferrence.  I did not put in the jalapenos this time but am sure it would be great with them in.I added a diced avocado which added to the wonderful flavors of the dish.  I used our local grocery store's brand of LIGHT Zesty Italian.        Be sure to allow time for flavors to blend at least 2 hours, it was even better the next day!

We made this for Thanksgiving and I'm getting ready to make it again for our family's Christmas gathering...that's how good it was! Everyone loves it. Most of us tend to like our food less spicy, so I used 1 jalapeno with the seeds removed, very finely chopped. I also made sure the onions were chopped fairly finely. I added 1C of frozen corn, warmed up in the microwave, but not overcooked...it was still nice and firm. I used a bit more than 3/4 of the bottle of zesty Italian, since a full bottle seemed a bit too much. My husband doesn't care for bell peppers or tomatoes, so I also made half of the batch without either of them. That can ruin a lot of recipes, but not this one. He gave it 5 stars as modified. We were in the mood for experimenting, so I made another batch of the other texas caviar recipe where you make your own dressing. Our diverse bunch (from a 2 year old to teenagers to grandparents) enjoyed both versions, but preferred this version. We made the texas caviars the night before...about 24 hours ahead of time (with the cilantro mixed in) and thought it just got better and better as the flavors melded. It's really nice to be able to make it ahead of time. YUM! Thanks for the recipe!!

I love this recipe.  I used canned black eyes peas and frozen corn (I did not have any canned corn).  I did cook the corn for approx 3 minutes then rinsed with cold water before adding to peas.

Very good - salsa-like but different.  I used frozen black eyed peas as I though canned may be mushy.  Also put the cilantro in the food processor to make sure it was thoroughly chopped - much easier!

I served this as a dip with baked corn chips on Thanksgiving and people seemed to really like it. 
I substituted one can of mexicorn for the black eyed peas and used a little less dressing than called for. I also seeded one of the jalapenos which made it just spicy enough for my family. I made this the night before and let it sit overnight in the fridge, which I felt helped the flavors blend.

Excellent! I only used half a bell pepper and a 1/2 pint of tomatoes, and I left out the coriander (I didn't have any). It still turned out great. Next time I will add fresh sweet corn or canned shoepeg corn.

Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe. It is very fresh tasting and goes great with chips and guacamole or any other Tex-Mex dish (and a cold beer or some sangria)! It has become a big family favorite - especially with my husband and all the other men.  I agree that it needs a few hours (or better yet overnight) for the flavors to blend.

This is the bomb!  When my husband sees me on this site, he groans.  But when I made this for him ... he asked for more.  So now he's not too bothered when I experiment... err practice.  I've done some of the variations that others have posted (like mexicali-corn or avacado) and it still comes out GREAT.  Wonderful for New Years Eve/Day ... as Black-Eyed Peas are a tradition of that time of year.  We eat this with corn-chip scoops -- yummy.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

I added corn like others have but also added black olives to give it some depth.  Did NOT put in the italian dressing but instead added an olive oil vinaigrette with blue cheese. I also doubled the Jalapenos but overall followed the recipe fairly closely. I made it a second time and used Olive oil with Balsamic dressing..was ready same day otherwise it needs to set up over night. Great base recipe for sure.

Not the best version, but still good. Needs corn though & a little more green pepper (just a preference). Also- don't waste a good vinaigrette. It's way better with plain, cheap Italian dressing! I ended up rinsing  off the vinaigrette & using apple cider vinegar and olive oil because I didn't have Italian, but still not as good as Italian.

Perfect as written! I did add in some black beans and subbed orange bell peppers for the green just because I wanted the colors. It was a MAJOR hit at a party and I couldn't have been happier!

Excellent. Great for something when you may neither want to cook nor sit at the table but crowd around in the living room's TV.

L oved this.  I must say however, that I was the only one who did.  My husband, my daughter, and our two guests, did not care for it all that much.  It was the cilantro that they did not care for.  But I did love it!

Very tasty, I added chopped celery, corn, Lawry's seasoned salt and black pepper. I didn't have the bell pepper, cilantro or coriander. But will use next time.  I served it with Tortilla chips and grilled barbecued Conecuh sausage- yum!

This is such a fantastic recipe!  Everyone young and old loved it with tortilla chips and frito chips.  Even if you don't like black-eyed peas (I don't), you will find this a winner dish to serve!  Oh, and it is simple!

I did make a lot of additions to my version of this recipe, but the base was fantastic and the proportions were perfect for spicy-ness. I wanted to make a main dish out of it, so I added tinned tuna, which was wonderful!

Made for a big birthday party - perfect with colorful blue corn tortilla chips.  Followed others' advice and omitted cilantro; also used multi-color peppers to add more variety, plus added 1 can of mexicorn, and cut back on the amount of dressing (Kraft Zesty Italian) Fabulous!

This is AWESOME for tailgating! Have done a few variations with the beans and onions and added a few Thai peppers to give it an EXTRA kick. Make sure to let it sit overnight before serving so the flavors can meld. We had guys just eating it by itself after they ran out of tortilla chips....

Festive colors and great flavor.  I did not have fresh cilantro, and added corn but was still very good.  Only down size is the large amount that it makes.  The flavor does get better overnight but you loose the color.

This is a big hit wherever I bring it and I'm always asked for the recipe. My mom asks me for the recipe at least 2 times a year because she doesn't know how to use a computer or save anything in her email. WE eat it as a side salad, not as a dip. 

One hint: serve with a slotted spoon!

I don't like black eyed peas at all, so I use a can of black beans and a can of garbanzo beans. I always use red onion.

This is such a popular item, I almost always double the recipe. When I do, I use a combination of mostly red onion but slip in some Vidalia if it is in season. I like to add even more color with a combination of different bell peppers. And I use a combination of black beans, garbanzo beans and mexicorn to prevent it from being too "beany". I gotta work with the people after they eat the salad!

Individually I love all the ingredients so I thought since I love everything in the recipe maybe this would be yummy mixed all together.. Wrong... maybe some shredded sharp cheddar mixed in at the last minute before serving would make it tastier.

I keep getting requests to make this tasty appetizer.  I would suggest squeezing half a lime if you don't have coriander on hand.  
I always make extra to put it in my salad.

This is a great dish as a side for BBQ or pot luck. Every time I make it there are never any leftovers. My family likes it so much that when I make for a party or get together they ask me to make extra and put some aside for them to have later. The only I change I make is I do not use bottled dressing, I like my dressing simple for salads like this so all I used was red wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. You can add dressing to your taste, as little or much as you like) just add 2 parts vinegar to 1 part EVOO. This small change makes a big difference. I personally think bottled dressing takes the fresh flavor away from the simplicity of the dish.

Great party dish, as a side or with chips. Used onion powder instead of real onion and I overdid it. Need to only do half a tsp or so.

I didn't have quite as much bell pepper(s) as the recipe called for, but I added corn to make up for it.  Was wonderful!  A lot of it got eaten at the party, and the leftovers made for GREAT hangover food;-)

Such a fresh tasting dip and one that feels healthy. I used a combo of red and green peppers, omitted one of the jalapenos, and omitted the cilantro because no one in my family except for me likes it.

I get asked for this recipe all the time and it's so easy to make!  I add some white frozen corn and a serrano peppers for a little more heat.  LOVE this!

I've been eating this for years and had no idea it was so easy to put together! Instead of using bottled dressing I made my own Italian dressing from the Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this website. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it!

Very delicious.  I used fat free zesty italian dressing and added a tablespoon of sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

This is such a refreshing dish.. I love it for lunch with corn chips and a cold drink. Takes the place of a more filling heavy dish.   Also great as a dip for a little get together. Yummy !

This can be used as a side dish or a salsa or a topping for fish or chicken.  Very versatile!  You can use fat free dressing without sacrificing taste in this recipe.

This  is good as a dip with chips but I will also be using this as a side dish.  

I didn't use cherry tomatoes I  used fresh Roma tomatoes because that's what I had on hand and reduced the amount of dressing. 

I will make this during the hot summer months coming up. It not only tastes good but looks very fresh and appetizing.

I also added a red and orange pepper and only 1 jalapeño. Also the fresh juice from a half of lime. I would add diced tomatoes next after reading reviews to make it easier to scoop. Very easy and yummy!

This was a big hit!  I did exactly as instructed.  I made it the night before which allowed the flavors to marry and the outcome was fantastic.  My sister in law is from Texas and she asked for the recipe.  I will definitely repeat.

I added two cans of corn. I also used a food processor to chop the pepper, jalapeno, and onion for quick work. I didn't add any spices and only had the dressing. It's quite good and the jalapeno adds a nice kick!

I was unprepared for the absolute delicious addictiveness of this!! My extended family has already decided it's another one of my "things" that I have to bring.  (I added a can of roasted corn).  Bomb.

Definitely can't wait to make it again. Doubled the recipe for a pot luck dish. Added a purple onion and white corn and a red and orange pepper. Only used about 1/2 bottle of dressing. Served with scoops multi grain chips. Many wanted the recipe!

This is a definite home run.     My additions were thus:  a small bag of frozen corn and a 15.5 oz. can of organic black olives sliced and doubled the garlic and coriander, used good seasons salad dressing mix prepared with light olive oil and organic apple cider vinegar.   Served generously over an equal parts mix of arugula, spinach and butter lettuce,  black bean chips and sweet potato corn chips on the side. Stupendous!

Absolutely the best way to eat your black-eyed peas for luck on New Year's Day. But really good at parties, too. It gets eaten quickly. Also good as an accompaniment to grilled pork chops or chicken.

I really was craving the dip one night but it was dinner time and I had to feed my kids. So I cooked up some chorizo and pasta and chilled them.  Mixed  the texas caviar up and then  mixed it all together for a great summer time salad.  It was a hit.

Delicious. Recipe is very forgiving of substitutes/additions. I left out coriander and jalapeño, used red onion instead of green, orange pepper instead of red, a container of fresh salsa instead of cherry tomatoes. I added a can of white corn and used Wishbone Robusto Italian dressing. One bag of scoops chips was not enough. Probably need 3 next time. I will make this again.

Our go to for the summer time. We tame it depending on the crowd by using only 1 jalapeño instead of 2. But it's always a hit.

I used a 4oz can of diced jalapeno and that was probably twice what was needed for this recipe. Also added a can of fire roasted corn to make it a side dish instead of a dip. This recipe is so delicous and gets better the more it sits. Even worked great as a dip with the corn. This is definitely going in my cookout dish list. I love having things different from the norm, especially vibrant simple things like this. Thanks for providing!

I made this with a few alterations and it was sooo good I could just sit and eat it with a spoon. Instead of the jalapeños I use bell peppers (I just didn't have jalapeño handy). Instead of the dressing I used 1/2 c olive oil and 1/3 c white wine vinegar. I also didn't have coriander so I used cumin.

This is fantastic! It's extremely versatile too. We substituted the black eyed peas for corn, took out most of the jalapeño seeds, added fresh and dried cilantro, went with half a green pepper and added yellow and red peppers, and only used about 4 ounces of Newman's Own zesty Italian dressing. Was amazing after sitting for a couple hours and was even better the next day. Next time, I'll only add a couple ounces of dressing or just toss it with a bit of olive oil and vinegar. We served it with a bit of sour cream too. Will be making this regularly!

I thought it was a pretty good receipt..I left out the jalapenos due to GF being allergic and used Diced tomatoes with green chilies, so was not  spicy or hot. Flavor was good though. will make again with the jalapenos. Wanted to try the red pepper vinaigrette but it can't be found around my neck of the woods.

Delicious! I made it just like the recipe.  It was a little too much garlic for my taste, so next time I will use a little less. I will definitely make it again.

Love making this in the summer as a snack- friends love this always ask for the recipe. I'm sure I've made this 5/6 times, allays add a little twist of my own - diced tomatoes, black eyes peas, cilantro, all thre colors of bell peppers. With scoops tortilla chips this is so easy and you can make ahead for a party!

OMG WoW I don't even know what to say about this. Absolutely delightful. I added corn to mine and only had kidney beans and black beans. Did not have coriander but added garlic salt. Used plain tortilla chips to scoop it up! Very fresh, tasty, super addictive. I got the most compliments on this dish...Making it again for our New Years Eve party!!

I make this every year for New Year's and other occasions where an appetizer is requested.  This is wholesome and delicious, a colorful delight for the senses.  People rave and request the recipe.  Leftovers make a delicious salad and never go to waste.  I typically use 1-1.5, not 2 whole jalapenos.  Otherwise I follow the recipe as written.

This is one of my most-requested dishes at any family gathering.   I often use serranos rather than jalapeno, and I put more in because we like a bit more heat.  But very, very good just as written.

I love this-- especially in the summer when we have fresh bell peppers, jal peppers , and cherry tomatoes. when I am making this in a hurry for a get together-- i cheat my using two small cans of green chile rotele, which gives a little spice, but no too much for those who like milder dishes.
