Very flavorful. I used coconut milk instead of skim. The whole meal was served over a bed of basmanti rice also made with coconut milk wine and I threw in some peas for luck. See http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/guys-big-bite-/coconut-rice-and-peas-recipe/index.html for the rice recipe. ENJOY!!

Seemed like a lot of ginger but it wasn't. I also used coconut milk -- fantastic. I can't wait to gobble up the leftovers.

I liked it but next time I will not try to substitute ground cinnamon for the cinnomon sticks. Take my advice don't even try it it makes the dish waaaay too cinnamon-y.

Best Chicken Saag I've ever made. I did triple the spices AND I roasted a whole bird in the same spices before adding to the pan. This way the chicken was VERY tender. I also used coconut milk instead of skim....

This is great and it goes together quickly. I added additional garam masala and until I added the yogurt and milk I used medium high heat therefore eliminating the need to cook as long as directed. My family suggests tying a string to the bay leaf for easy recovery and making more sauce. I'll make it again!

I liked this very much but I was confused by the lack of salt. Is this an oversight? Either way I added salt to taste and it was great.

This was good but it's lacking some depth of flavor. As with most Indian recipes ended up nearly doubling the dry spices but it was still a bit bland. Maybe I need to saute the onions longer to develop their flavor more or use more garlic...I'll have to have a play around with the recipe. Thanks!

I've also found that most Indian recipes don't have a strong flavor. So I took the suggestion to double the dry masala this was great! I finely chopped two onions also I blanched peeled and pureed three small tomatoes. Rather than adding the ginger root and garlic clove I added two tsp of ginger-garlic paste and one tsp of garlic paste. I also added one red chili for kick. I added the yogurt but I left out the milk. I liked the taste and I didn't want to change it. Maybe next time I'll try adding the milk. I love saagwala chicken and I'll definitely come back to this recipe. This recipe has good flavor.

I thought this was super easy to make but if you don't have a well stalked pantry might require a little shopping. For those that don't want to buy full sizes of the spices stores like Sprouts Whole Foods etc... let you purchase in smaller quantities. I thought the flavor of this dish was good but missing something. I also used coconut milk. The only major thing I changed was the cooking time. If you cook as long as it states the chicken might be over cooked. I cooked chicken over medium and it was completely cooked thru in 5 minutes. Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and tasty dish. Like other reviews I used coconut milk in place of regular. Will definitely continue to make this.

I made this vegetarian by using Morningstar Farms Chik'n Strips and we all liked it (including children). It was really good with the rice recipe recommended by Bruce (Sep. 2011).

I have made this recipe a number of times and my husband and I both love it. I follow the recipe exactly except I add 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of ground pepper in with the other spices and I double the spinach. I've also made this vegetarian before with mushrooms and paneer (the paneer was made with a recipe from this site). When modifying the recipe just make sure to add liquid to replace the liquid you would get from the chicken. I browned sliced mushrooms with the onions then continued following the recipe and added the spices garlic ginger and tomato paste. At this point I began adding vegetable broth and continued to do so as needed until the mixture had simmered for 10 minutes (this is important just add enough so your mixture can simmer and bubble softly not too much that it's really soupy but enough that it doesn't burn and stick to the pan) then I added the spinach let it wilt a minute then added the yogurt milk and paneer. Brought the mixture back up to a simmer and let it simmer for another 10 minutes. I also should note that this dish is quite spicy; halve the pepper if you don't like the heat. To make this taste a little more Thai use coconut milk instead of skim.

Very flavourful and yummy! I was sad when there wasn't much gravy because it would have been so good - but maybe this is not a gravy heavy dish. The spices are spot on for sure. I omitted the plain yogurt as I didn't have any and used whole milk instead. Also I just eyeballed the milk amount to my preference.

I put 1/4 red and 1/4 green pimiento with the onion. They added even more taste to this delicious dish.

It wasn't bad but I was disappointed with it. The house smelled so good while it was cooking and I was excited but the flavor was so bland. I even doubled the spices based on the reviews stating that it was bland. I also added coconut milk in place of the skim and that helped but not enough. If i knew more about this type of cooking maybe I could think of something to add but I don't so I'm going to have to explore another recipe.
