Loved it and my family raved about it because the sauerkraut wasn't over powering and the pork was done perfectly. Thank you for sharing!

I followed the instructions with the exception of the Macintosh apples. I used red delicious and I used a crockpot and let it cook for 6 to 8 hours on low. It was tender moist and delicious.

Loved this dish! We used half the sauerkraut amount or 1 bag. Pork loin was so tender even after letting the meat cool that I had to use an electric knife to slice. Even better warmed up 2 days later as I had some boiled potatoes and sat them on top of the sauerkraut when I put the dish in the refrigerator. The potatoes absorbed the flavor of the sauerkraut/brown sugar and made the meal a one-pan meal. Will definitely make again.
