I made this recipe following the instructions exactly and it was soooo salty I had to throw it out.  with 2 tsp of salt plus 1 tbsp of chicken granules which are in themselves salty it was overwhelmed with salt.  And then the cheese on top which is also loaded with salt.  I may try it again and omit the salt but it is definately inedible as the recipe stands.

Fourteen tablespoons of butter for six servings!?!  No wonder some people thing it tastes good, butter is like that, but where does it end???  Zucchini can taste great without all of that butter........  ?????

Leaving out the recipe saved me. I took it to a pot luck BBQ. Made 2 pans, thought I would get to take some home. Nope. It was devoured and I have sent this recipe on to multiple people from the BBQ. Next time I am going to try it with a little less butter.
Thanks

I give it five stars with the adjustments I made. After reading other reviews, I left out the salt in the mix. And rather than mixing the bread crumbs with half a cup of butter, I just mixed them with the cheese and sprinkled on top. It was very tasty. Two of my kids didn't like it, but that's only because they don't like zucchini. They ate the rest of it.

This dish is awesome and easy to put together for even a beginner like me. I left out salt and only olive oil to saute veggies.  No butter just bread cubes and cheese mixed.I only had Mozzarella and it was still good. I will be use this recipe many times.

way too much effort, as well as too much salt.  I don't know why I have to completely cook the ingredients before they get into the casserole dish.

I have learned over time to use at best 1/4 of the salt suggested in almost any recipe and I am glad that I did. Next time I will also cut back on the butter suggested in this recipe but overall it is a plain but tasty side dish. I might experiment with the type of cheese the next time I make it and add other herbs.

Step2: I added garlic to onion & butter, omitted the parsley & added some dried thyme &         oregano.

Step3: I used panko bread crumbs & Parmesan, didn't bother with the melted butter.

I made a change on accident, but I loved the way it turned out; I accidently added the cheese to the sauce instead of sprinkling it on top. Also, instead of measuring salt and pepper, I added them to taste. Will absolutely make this again, with the same "mistake!"

I'm not a big zucchini fan, but even I thought this was tasty, so I'll give it 5 stars.  Used only 3T butter to cook the onion/zucc, then only sprinkled in a little seasoned salt.  Had some half and half to use up, so used that in place of milk and left out the bouillon.  Mixed about a 1/2C of bread crumbs with the cheese and sprinkled on top before putting in the oven.  Very yummy and the family cleaned out the pan!

So salty, lacks flavor.
