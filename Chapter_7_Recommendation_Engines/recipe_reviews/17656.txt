This recipe is AWESOME.  So easy, tastes delicious and never fails.  I've been making it often as my house is for sale and it gets the house smelling just wonderful for people walking through.  It's very adaptable too.  I like to add a touch of cinnamon and vanilla to it and often substitue other fruits for the banana.  This morning I used 1 banana, 1 peach and a 1/2 cup of shredded zuchinni and a handful of raisins.  Yesterday it was 1 banana and 1 c of zuchinni.  Before that it was all zuchinni and a 1/2 c  pineapple and raisins.  This recipe hasn't failed on me yet!

This was easy to make and tasted good. I agree with others that the mixture was a bit on the dry side (used US measurements) so I added some milk. I also used butter instead of shortening (I didn't have any on hand), made them in muffin form (for quicker cooking) and added some rolled oats, flaked almonds and shredded coconut.

I was hesitant that this would work at first but it came out GREAT.  The loaf was gone by the end of the night and it made the whole house smell wonderful.  I added 3/4 cup of milk to the recipie but I reccomend cutting it to 1/2 to make a more bread like consistency.  I will definately make this one again.

I never knew you could make a quick bread without eggs.  I was skeptical so I had to try.  It was delicious.  I used applesauce instead of shortening and replaced 1/2 c.  of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I also add 1/2 cup milk since I only had 2 bananas.  This will go in my regular rotation.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It was pleasantly surprising to find one without eggs.  I also substituted unsweetened applesauce (3/4 cup) for the shortening.  And yes, the house did smell wonderful!

A flawless recipe!  Excellent!  Moist!  I have a friend who's allergic to eggs so this is perfect for her!  Add walnuts and/or chocolate chips!

This bread is wonderful!  I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes, and my family liked this one the best.  No one would have guessed that it is egg-free.  This will be my banana bread recipe from now on.

I've got a B&B in Tuscany and recently had some vegan guests. These muffins were suitable to their dietary restricts and we're enjoyed by all guests . I don't have access to shortening so I substituted 2/3 cup of olive oil.  They received rave reviews.  The following day I modified a bit with processed fresh apples, 3/4 whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour and 1/4 cup oatmeal. Added  some raisins, cinnamon and vanilla. Proud to say they received the same rave reviews from guests. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!  As per other reviews I add 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t cinnamon, and 1/2 c chopped walnuts or almonds (or dried blueberries!)  I always replace the shortening w applesauce and sometimes I reduce the sugar.  I've been substituting wheat free flours (or gluten free) as well.  I make a dozen muffins baking at 400 or so for 25-30 mins.  Easy serving sizes.  SO GOOD!

This may be tolerable for those w/ allergies to eggs or milk, but for those of us who are not I recommend using a traditional recipe w/ eggs.  This recipe is a bit to "gummy" for me.  I will not make again.

I was looking for a vegan banana bread recipe as my daughter has severe dairy and egg allergies. Although I don't ever use shortening so I substitute pureed veggies (sweet potato, pumpkin, carrot, etc.) for the shortening for a moist and extra nutritious banana bread!

This is the best banana bread ever! After reading reviews, I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Added 1/2 cup of milk and made muffins.  They are so delicious. I am adding this to my recipe book!

I used 4 bananas, one stick of butter, sugar-free sugar (because I didn't have regular sugar), didn't add milk. I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the butter and sugar mixture. It came out better than I thought. I sprinkled walnuts to the top of the loaf before baking it and spread butter on the top when it first came out of the oven. It was pretty good...although I think I'll make it again with regular sugar :  )

This is a fabulous eggless banana bread (with some adjustments). It came out as well as if it had eggs. I followed others suggestions and added 1/2 c. milk, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the recipe. And now, because it doesn't have eggs, I can share it with my husband... not that I want to. This is my new official banana bread recipe.

Update: This is also great with a 1/2 c. of fresh blueberries folded into the batter. Yum!

I made two side by side BB's this day and sent them to my husband's office. Hands down, this one won! I used butter instead of shortening. I added one small Activa peach yogurt and some vanilla extract, then cooked it 15mn longer. Perfect! Very moist and they all loved it! Now I have to make one for me to enjoy :)

Seems to be a fool proof recipe.  I made some revisions and it turned out great! Instead of shortening I replaced it with 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c cinnamon apple sauce and used 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 3/4 c white flour.  Also used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.   Next time I think I'll just do the 1/2 c brown sugar and skip the add'l white sugar.  Super easy to make.  This version took 55 minutes to cook on convection.

I used whole wheat white flour. That was the only change I made I ended up getting 12 muffins out of this recipe. These were good but honestly, I missed the eggs and the banana bread seemed to have no flavor, other than flour and banana. I think it could use a little baking powder, too as well as vanilla flavoring. I also thought it was too sweet.

I really like this recipe. I was looking for something vegan because I am on a low cholesterol diet, but ended up making it with a splash of 1% milk. I also used applesauce in place of the shortening and added 1 tsp of baking powder. It came out a tad rubbery (I think I overmixed it, so it was my fault not the recipe) but really good! I also used bananas that my husband had frozen, so they were super sweet, giving the bread a crazy big  banana flavor.

Delicious! I used butter Crisco for the shortening, added some cinnamon and 3/4 cup milk to the batter to make the consistency more spreadable, and it turned out perfect. Looking forward to trying with other fruits as well.

Yum!  Takes a while to cook.  Don't use a deep pan or the top of the bread will turn dark brown before the inside is cooked.  Probably makes a good muffin.

This was delicious! I made muffins instead of bread. It made 11 muffins. 
I did the changes some people recommended of adding 1/2 c milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and then added 1 TBS of wheat germ. Sprinkled a little sugar on top and cooked for 30-35 min. Everyone loved them. Thanks!

I used a 9 inch round pie pan instead of a loaf pan.  It started to burn around the edges, cooked it about 10 minutes less. It sure is good now!!

My daughter is allergic to both egg whites and milk. it's so difficult to find a recipe w/o them. These were delicious. Also great for grandpa who shouldn't be eating too much egg. Thank you!

This is pretty good.  I was looking for a low-calorie version so instead of shortening I used applesauce.  I added a teaspoon of baking powder (not sure why that's not included in this recipe because it kind of needs it to rise a little).  I had tiny bananas so used four.  When I "creamed" the applesauce and sugar together I used an electric beater on high for over a minute to get some additional air into the batter.  I only used 2/3 cup of sugar.  So, this turned out good--not great, but good.  Next time I'll use less bananas and one more teaspoon of baking powder because it comes out a little dense.  Overall, a good effort -- got the calorie count down to 104 calories for 1/16th slice.

Banana Bread is one of my favorite things to bake and I found this recipe when I was out of eggs.  I am so impressed at how the loaves turned out I had to add my comments.  This is a keeper, easy, moist and yummy!  I only added mini chocolate chips.

Excellent!  This bread is moist and delicious.  I did use canola oil instead of shortening, added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter, and used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup wheat flour.  I also added a streusel topping made from 1/2 C flour, 1/4 C Brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon and 2 TB Butter.  Who knew you could make such great banana bread without eggs!

A very forgiving and easy recipe. I used only 1 T of shortening, the rest applesauce, splenda instead of sugar, and added 1/4 c of milk and spices as suggested by others. I also used all wheat flour and added 1 t vanilla and some chopped pecans. After all the changes I was leary of the results but it was moist, cooked perfectly, and delicious! This will become my staple bread recipe.

This recipe is great! You seriously can't screw it up even if you mess with it. I used 1/2 C. cinnamon applesauce in place of the shortening, 3/4 C. splenda/sugar mix, and the rest the same. Had a beautiful and tasty loaf of bananna bread that is very cholesterol and vegetarian friendly. Thank you!!

Very good banana bread - moist, flavorful, easy to make!  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract & 1/2 tsp cinnamon as suggested by many others.  Took exactly an hour in my oven.  I substituted Olivio margarine instead of shortening (packed with omega 3s & trans fat free!).  Was a bit worried about not adding eggs, but the recipe worked!  The best use of almost rotten bananas ever!

I really liked this recipe because of how simple it is. I used apple sauce instead of shortening and brown sugar instead of white and also added oats. It made me feel less guilty eating it, but it still tasted delicious.

I thought this was okay but I wouldn't make it again. The texture is moist but almost gummy. I found it too sweet and I think the sugar masks the banana flavor.

I first tried this recipe because my little grandson is allergic to eggs.  It has become a family favourite.  I make muffins instead of bread.  I use margarine instead of shortening, and I also use 1/2 cup of brown sugar & 1/2 cup of white instead of all white.  I have added walnuts and miniature chocolate chips.  Today I put aboaut 1/3 cup of chopped strawberries with the chocolate chips.  To make it a special treat, I frost with cream cheese icing!  It makes exactly 12 good size muffins and they freeze well.  Depending on how big the bananas are, I have added a little milk, as some have suggestred ~ only if the batter is a little dry.

Wow!  This is the best, most delicious banana bread I have ever tasted!  I accidentally used 1 cup flour instead of 1 1/2 cups, and it came out moist and rich, kind of dense, like steamed pudding.  Yum! What a delicious mistake!  Otherwise, made it exactly as written, except reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp - added nothing.  Baked at 325 degrees for one hour, as recipe states.  Next time, I will try it with the 1 1/2 cups flour and add to my comments, maybe it will be just as good.  But I really liked it with my "mistake" and might keep making it that way! (that's how brownies were invented - a botched chocolate cake)

I cannot argue with everyone else! I loved it, but I did add a handful of chocolate chips and one extra banana. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Try adding the banana in before the flour. I have made this several times now, and most people can't stop eating until it's gone.

I can't rate this recipe because the substitution I made totally ruined the recipe.  I was out of shortening and butter, so I thought I could maybe use oil, BIG mistake!  It was cooked, but was very dense and clumpy (I actually had it in the oven for 1 hr 30 mins).  Smelled wonderful, but tasted otherwise.

I was dubious when I started - so few ingredients and the order of adding them to the bowl is  a bit strange - but this is really simple and good. It's a great base to add your own twist to or leave as is when you want something yummy but don't have much in the pantry.

Thanks for the great recipe.  I had some bananas that were beyond ripe but didn't have any eggs...found this recipe and made in a muffin pan to shorten the baking time...turned out WONDERFUL!  Probably the best banana bread I've ever tasted!

Ohh, lovely. I couldn't resist tweaking (added some walnuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips) and I had to use whole wheat and applesauce since that's all I had on hand... I can only guess that if I hadn't done that it would have only been sweeter and more tender! Excellent simple recipe! Took well over and hour to bake, though!

This did not turn out for me. The texture was really wet even after baking 65 minutes. It was edible only if eaten out of the fridge to dry it out a bit. Otherwise we couldn't even pick a piece of it up without it falling apart. Sorry, won't make this again.

I'm giving this 2 stars because once I had mixed in all the ingredients, I had a dry mess! There was no way this was "pouring" anywhere!!! I had to add 1/2 cup of milk to get a batter consistancy, so that I could pour it into my loaf pan. Once baked, this was great, not too sweet, and very banana-ry. I would say this is more of a cake than a bread though, because I have tried other banana breads that are more like a bread than a cake. This would be good with raisens added in too.

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love it. i cooked it in  muffin form, and used butter instead of shortening. tastes great! milk was not needed and i have no idea why i listened to the other people. i made the mistake of listening to other reviews and added 1/2 cup milk, resulting in me adding a lot of flour to make up for it. i followed the recipe almost exactly, but cooked them for 1 hour 10 minutes instead of 1 hour because they turned out a little raw when cooking 1 hour. i also added about a cup of walnuts and that was like the final touch. one of the best banana breads ive ever tasted.

This bread didn't rise much and the servings are kind of small. Next time, I'll add a bit more sugar. Also, the bread looked done after 40 min., but was still a little undercooked. I'm glad I checked it 20 min. early, though, because 1 hour is probably a little long.

I had to give this 5 stars! It was very moist and very versatile for adding almost any other ingredients. I added vanilla and used plain yogurt for shortening and it was delicious! The crust was a little darker than expected, and yet was just as moist as the rest of the loaf. It was easy to make as well.
Thank you for offering it!

Used Fat Free Vanilla Yogurt in place of shortening and it came out amazing and saves all the calories from the shortening...which makes it virtually fat free.

Great taste! Super easy to make! Mine didn't require any alterations, although I did have to cook it for 70 minutes instead of 60. I'll use this recipe again!

This recipe is awesome! I read the other reviews that said it was a little dry, so I added about 1/2 a cup (give or take) of plain greek yogurt and that worked like a charm! I also added rolled oats & chocolate chips. YUM! definitely going to make this recipe again!

WOW! I love this recipe. I had some old bananas just lying around and my son was starting table food and I wanted to make some bread for him but, without eggs because I did not want him to develop an allergy. I am very impressed with this, but just like other posters....I would add 1/2-3/4 cup of milk. It is great...I plan on adding nuts or chocolate chips next time.

My kids love this recipe.  I make it at least twice a month. I change it a little by adding 1/2 cup of flax seed meal, and I always add 1 egg for a little protien.

This is a wonderful recipe! I use applesauce in place of the shortening to cut the fat and it's so moist and tasty. Sometimes I add strawberries or blueberries to it as well as chocolate chips and walnuts. This recipe is wonderfully versatile.

I was looking for a recipe that did not have eggs because my son is allergic to them.  This recipe was Excellent!  I made a couple of minor changes after reading other reviews.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the bananas, used half whole wheat and half regular flour, decreased sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Baked as muffins for about 23 minutes. These couldn't have been better!

Not bad, lacking spice but not bad! I added a bunch of allspice and a dash of nutmeg and i think the smell of it baking was better than anything else. I would use this again, over and over!

Oh, this one is a keeper.  By far the best banana bread I've eaten...even beats the slice I had in Hawaii!  I followed this recipe with the only exception being, I used raw sugar instead of pure white....for health reasons....I'm trying to blot out of my mind the shortening part :)  This bread is VERY moist, so I'm not sure what happened to other reviews when it is listed as being too dry. Mine came out to perfection....just had to bake an extra 10 minutes.  Love it! Love it!

I've been using this recipe for years now, and everyone loves it.  No one believes it has no milk or eggs in it.  The first couple of times I made this I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a good, simple bread.  Now I add different spices, like cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and vanilla.  I have made this with Splenda as well, adding unsweetened applesauce to get the moisture back... and I have also used flavored applesauce with wonderful results...  my favorite so far being to use Splenda, and add a container of no sugar added blueberry applesauce.  I do grease and flour the bread pan to avoid sticking.  I mix the wet ingredients in the KitchenAid, including the bananas tossed in whole, then mix the dry.

Well, this is not bad considering there's no egg. A little heavy, maybe some baking powder or more baking soda would have lightened them up? Or it could be cause I added some chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. I also used half white sugar, half brown, and butter instead of shortening. Not a bad emergency recipe when you're out of eggs but the egg versions are definitely more light and tender.

This recipe is too salty. I should have followed my insticts while making it and added 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp.  Other than that, I added the 1/2 c. milk suggested by other reviewers.  Might try again with 1/2 tsp salt instead.

I followed the advice of others and added mashed bananas AFTER the creamed mixture and dry ingredients were mixed together. Also added vanilla (to mashed banana) and cinnamon. Was a nice doughy consistency, looked great! Can't wait to try it.

This is my ALL TIME favorite banana bread recipe.  The other day I wanted to make strawberry bread, and I used this recipe and it turned out great!  i used 1 cup of strawberries in place of the banana.  I'm sure you could make it a strawberry-banana bread (1/2 cup of each) if you wanted, i'm just not one for that combination.  well, again this is AMAZING and oh, i usually sprinkle brown sugar and nuts on the top of the bread...extra yummy!

I love this recipe! It's a snap to make, and the end result is delicious.  I've seen some people adding milk, but milk is not necessary.  The mixture will be very crumbly but as soon as you add the mashed bananas, it will all work out.
I use half sugar, half splenda... and I use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour - it doesn't alter the final flavour very much, and I feel better about eating half a loaf in one night :)

This was my first time making a banana bread and I was looking for an egg-free, milk-free recipe my 14 month old could enjoy. I followed the instructions exactly, no additions, so substitutions. The recipe was quick and easy and the loaf cooked up beautifully. I did personally find it a little sweet for my liking and a little ... tacky, if I can use that word. Sticky might be a better term. But it wasn't undercooked. I liked it very much and apart from mabe reducing the sugar next time, I think this will become a staple recipe in our home. Thanks!

Did not work out for me, only because of my cooking skills, certainly not the recipe. From all the batter I licked off the bowl it was yum! Also the stuff I burnt even tasted delish, so I can tell it would have been great if I cooked it properly. Will definetely be trying this one again in the future! (Even just to end up licking batter rather than eating it)

This is my favorite recipe on this site.  I do not cook with eggs (if possible)and am elated with the results!  I used plain yogurt and applesauce instead of the shortening.  I also have added pineapple and apples to the bread.  Both came out absolutely scrumptious.  I also sprinkled a layer of brown sugar over mini loaves.  I added crushed walnuts on a few of them.  My husband likes cream cheese icing on his.  Divine!

This bread was delicious! I made mine in a 9 by 5 pan since that's all I had and I will make it again but just double the recipe for a 9 by 5 pan.  Soooo moist and doesn't dry out!  I made two banana breads on the same day and this one kept much longer and was the best tasting! My one year old loves it :)

I used the recipe to make mini-muffins and they came out quite good for flavor and texture. A tiny bit crispy on the outside and soft and moist of the inside. I (of course) added chocolate chips. I also used apple sauce instead of shortening with no trouble. Made 30 mini muffins, baked at 400F for 12 minutes.

I needed a recipe for Banana bread without eggs, so I tried this one. I don't know if I did something wrong or if it was the recipe, but we did not like this. Too dense, no flavor, all around not good.

The BEST Banana bread recipe I have found!  Easy, quick and SO moist!  I've always been disappointed with past recipes b/c they were dry.  This recipe is very moist!  I did add 1/2 cup milk and 1 tsp vanilla and some cinnamon.  Can't wait to try other variations with chocolate chips, nuts, etc!  YUM!

Very easy and fast to make, and I love the fact that it has no eggs in it. It was an extremely dry batter though, so I added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of buttermilk. I also added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla to taste and made into  muffins. After that, it came out perfectly moist and delicious! If it wasn't for the dryness of the batter, this would merit a five star. Thanks for sharing!

Thanks for this recipe.  My daughter is allergic to eggs, but banana bread is one of my husband's favorite foods.  We've been using this recipe for years now.  Last week I made regular banana bread with eggs, and my husband and I both agree that this eggless recipe is better.  It has more banana flavor, is more tender.    I like to top the banana bread with raw sugar before baking it.  I usually use butter instead of shortening (avoiding transfats); I have used palm oil shortening with it and it's good that way too.  I do usually add about 1/2 cup milk but if your bananas are large, that liquid isn't necessary unless you want it.  The batter will be dry and firm 'til you add the bananas, if you don't add milk.

I made this for a class breakfast potluck with vegan students.    I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup walnuts, and 1/2 cup of applesauce just for kicks. 1/2 the flour I used whole wheat. I also put a streusel topping according to another reviewers recipe.    They were sooo great, everyone loved them and asked for more.

Okay so i had some perfectly ripe bananas for baking (only 2) so i looked up banana bread recipes. There was a catch i didnt have any eggs and i came across this wonderfully delicious and easy banana bread that does not require eggs! I used the suggestions of others and used 2 bananas and 1 cup of milk. I can not believe this doesnt have that many reviews as some other bread recipes. This was so so simple and so so so good. Yum. U wont be sorry.

Oh my goodness this bread is so good! I didn't think an eggless bread would be, but it is delicious. I also added about 1/2 cup of milk, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, and added a pinch of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. I made muffins with it and my son loved it too!

This is the best banana bread I have ever had.  I added a grated apple, 1/4 C wheat bran, 1/4 C oats and 1/4 C chopped walnuts.  No need for an egg!  Fabulous!

Everytime I make this bread it disappears quickly and no one ever imagines it isn't made with eggs or milk.  I make it with extra bananas and I wait until they are extremely dark in color so that the flavor is richer.

This is the first recipe I ever made from allrecipes and it's been my favorite banana bread recipe for years.  The only thing is, you can't mix nuts in with it or it will crumble apart.  You can sprinkle them on top, though.

I've substituted all whole wheat for the white flour and brown sugar for the white and it was still very good.

The description when I clicked on this said it was low-cholesterol, but I can't find that description on the actual page.  It should be noted that trans-fat is horrible for cholesterol levels, so anyone who is concerned about cholesterol should not be cooking with a lot of shortening.  Dietary intake of cholesterol does not actually have much effect on cholesterol levels.

I made a healthier version of this recipe with 1 1/2 cups of ground flaxseed in place of the shortening, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup splenda, whole wheat flour, an extra banana, and I added about a teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I don't have an electric mixer, so I just mixed it by hand.  I tasted great but was a bit dense.  However, it was just what I was looking for considering that my options were limited as I didn't have any milk or eggs.

I added 1/2 c. milk, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. DELICIOUS! Dense and very moist(we like it when slightly undercooked and fudgy - yum!). My FIL devours this when he comes to visit! Good with walnuts, too. I'm now known for my yummy banana bread - thanks for the recipe!

For an eggless recipe, this bread rocks!  I wanted to make a banana bread, but didn't have any eggs - I figured allrecipes would have an eggless recipe, and wonder of wonders, they did!  I substituted margarine for the shortening and it turned out delicious.  I also added a bit of vanilla for some flavor.  
I even made a plum version once!  Instead of bananas, I substituted 1 cup of pureed plums (threw some canned plums in heavy syrup into the blender) and decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup since the plums were VERY sweet.  This variation turned out awesome too - you should try it - an interesting and strong flavor, especially for those who are fans of other quick breads besides the regular banana.  UPDATE*** Today I baked this banana bread with the addition of an expired 6 oz Dannon fat free raspberry and white chocolate yogurt.  It made the banana bread more tender and fluffy, closer in texture to Janet's Rich Banana Bread on this site, which is the only other banana bread I bake.  If you do this, however, decrease the baking temperature to 325 and bake for at least 15 minutes longer than indicated.

I used to make banana bread with eggs, but my son has developed an egg allergy.  I tried this so he could eat this with his sisters....and this was fantastic!  I added 1/4C milk, and the bread was a bit mushy.  I will try this recipe again w/o adding milk and see what happens.  I did also add chocolate chips and some walnuts to top it off.  Overall - a great EGG FREE recipe!!!

**It did firm a little overnight, but much.  That did not matter as the kids LOVED it and we are making more this morning!!!

I did not care for this, maybe it was my shortening, who knows.  I knew it was bad when my 4 yr old (who eats everything) didn't want any more after I gave him a nibble.  I'll never make this again, stick to the egg version.  Sorry.

This is a good egg-free banana bread, but I made some changes.  I added 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for extra flavor.  I also put in an additional 1/2 cup of milk (after reading the reviews), which turned out a VERY moist bread.  I think 1/4 cup would have been plenty, or maybe even none at all.  I think the moisture in the recipe is fine as it is.  Overall, the bread had an excellent banana flavor and was enjoyed by many :)

Wow.  Fast to put together ... easy ... and tasted fabulous!  Only alterations the first time were to add vanilla and substitute about 1/2 cup all-purpose flou with whole wheat.  Both add a little depth of flavor that I like.  Whole family loved it ... will make it again - many times!

This bread is unbelievable! I'm amazed that a quick bread recipe that excludes eggs and, through modification, fat turned out this good. I, like other reviewers, subbed yogurt and applesauce for the shortening. I mixed unbleached all-purpose and whole wheat flours, and I also added a 1/2 cup of organic creamy peanut butter. This was the best banana bread I've had in a long time. Thanks for another great recipe!

I picked this recipe because I wanted to bake with my son (and I have a few brown banana's), and since there is no eggs,its kid-batter friendly.  I did substitute margarine for the shortening (I didn't have any), and used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.  It recently came out of the oven, and me and my son tasted it.  We both really like it.  My husband came home and rated it a 5.  So, I guess it's a keeper!  Hopefully it will stay nicely for tomorrow's breakfast as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Amazing banana bread.  My boyfriend, his roommate and I ate half the loaf before it even could cool.  We used a 4th banana and loved the extreme banana flavor without the distraction of any nuts.

I slightly altered this recipe, substituting 1/2 c sweetened applesauce (or 1 applesauce snack cup) for shortening, used only 3/4 c sugar, and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  To reduce cook time I baked in an 8in. round cake pan for 45 minutes.  Turned out perfect!  Absolutely love this recipe.

Delicious!  I am constantly in search of eggless recipes that taste great because my daughter and husband are both allergic to eggs.  I tinkered with this recipe just a tad, I used butter flavored crisco, 1/2t cinnamon, 1t vanilla and used the 2 banana 1/2c milk combo that so many suggested and its just wonderful.  I can't wait to try this recipe with shredded zuccini & carrots or blueberries or chocolate chips!  Thank you so much Deborah.

So I always follow this basic recipe and love it.  The alterations I made each time include:  Butter instead of Shortening.  1/2 C White and 1/2 Brown Sugar instead of only 1 C White.  I add chocolate chips and sprinkle the top with White Sugar before baking.  My loaves always take over an hour to cook.  Usually closer to 1 hr 20...  But delicious!!!

I added milk, but I think it made it too moist.  I will try it again without modifications.  Except for adding cinnamon; we like adding cinnamon.

This was great! I didn't alter the recipe at all and it turned out just fine. It wasn't dry at all.

This recipe was awesome. I used butter instead of shortening and will try it next time with applesauce. I wasn't sure what 3 ripe bananas is actually equivalent to - since bananas come in all sizes. So I started with two and ended up with a third to make it more batter-y than dough-y.

I felt it necessary to add about 1 tablespoon milk to get a better texture.  I also add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Not bad.

This is a really easy recipe to follow- and perfect for my friends who are allergic to eggs! The only complaint I have, is I would add more banana (We're banana lovers in my house!) I also made a second batch and added chocolate chips to it. I had to add about 1/4 cup of water to compensate for the extra ingredients, but it works just fine! It's really easy to customize this recipe, I'll be making several more with raisins, nuts, dates, bananas, etc.    I used mini-loaf pans instead of a large loaf pan and cut the cooking time down to about 40 minutes.

I love this recipe because it is soooo easy to make! I will keep using it whenever my bananas start to become too ripe. I also added a dash of cinnamon and yes the house did smell wonderful.

This banana bread is EXCELLENT!  I replaced one banana with a half-cup of unsweetened applesauce (because I didn't have enough bananas), used around 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, used Country Crock instead of shortening, and added about 1/8 cup canola oil to make sure it didn't end up too dry.    Came out as the best banana bread I had ever made!!!

So good! Very moist. I added as much milk as I needed to get a more flowable batter.  Next time I will add walnuts.

I'm not much of a banana bread person, but my husband who loves banana bread and knows what is good, loved this banana bread so much that all I heard was "Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm" for a good minute before he said anything else.  I love that it turned out so well despite all the tweaking I did to the recipe to use the ingredients I had at home.  I substituted 1 1/4 cup bread flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for the All Purpose the recipe calls for.  I also used unsalted butter instead of shortening and added 3/4 cup of whole milk since several other reviewers suggested it.  I also used 1/2 cup raw cane sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar instead of white sugar, since I didn't have any at home.  The result was a wholesome, rich, moist bread.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I just tried this recipe for the first time and loved it. I made a couple changes to it though. I used whole wheat flour instead of white all purpose, instead of 1 cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown, plus I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. It turned out so moist and delicious! Possibly the best banana bread ever!

This was the best recipe. And super easy and helpful when I was in a pinch-I didn't have any eggs but promised the kiddos we could make banana bread! 
I followed a previous suggestion and only used 1 cup of flour. It made it much more moist and gooey!!! Yummy!

This is a great recipe. I had no issue with fluid amounts or having the consistency become pourable. I have experimented with adding some cinnamon and nutmeg and allspice, all of which has been tasty in about one teaspoon doses. In fact, this recipe is so good, and knowing that the eggless batter is a bonus, I have actually started buying extra bananas to keep for the next loaf!

I read some of the reviews and quite a lot of you said the mixture was too dry and needed to add milk. This is because it asks for too much flour in the US conversion! If you take a look at Metric it says 190g of flour and 200g of sugar... but it says 1 and half cup flour and 1 cup sugar at US. Anyway the mixture was fine for me :D i recommend cutting down on the salt because it was very salty! Other than that it was good bread.

Very good.  Moist and dense.  I will add some crushed nuts next time.  My substitutions/additions:  butter instead of shortening, added 3/4c. soy milk, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. almond extract.  Sprinkled top with cinnamon.  The interior of this bread was very colorful.  I used overripe bananas and 8x8 Jadeite pan.

This was excellent!  I have been trying to eliminate any animal products from my diet, and who knew you could make BETTER banana bread with no egg in it!!!  I only had 1/4 cup shortening so I added 1/4 cup applesauce.  I intended to add vanilla and cinnamon, but forgot....might try that next time, but again this was great as is!

Wonderful texture and very strong banana flavor, even with only 2 bananas. I added the 1/2 c skim milk, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t cinnamon and used butter for shortening. Will update when I try yogurt and applesauce for shortening. Thanks for healthier twist on this treat!

I tried the substitute of yogurt for shortening and I don't know what happened but mine was like glue in the middle.  I will probably try the recipe again because it smelled so good while cooking, but next time I'll stick to the actual recipe.

Wow - what a great recipe!  The bread baked up nicely, and was promptly devoured by my family...have made it twice since then, with matching results!  Nice to find an egg-free recipe that bakes up so well!

I made this bread two different ways:  1st time I used yogurt instead of shortening.  And in the 2nd batch I used 2 bananas instead of 3, 1/2 cup milk, and shortening as the recipe states.  I added 1 t vanilla and 1/4 t cinnamon to both.  
Both recipes were good, but the second time was the best.  I don't know if it was using the shortening or if it was the one less banana.  But the second loaf had a great flavor and consistency.  Thanks for sharing!!!  And thanks to all, for the suggested modifications!!!

Wow.  I think that sums it up.  I used cake flour and this bread came out like dessert.  All I have to say is, "DANGEROUS."  The flavor and texture is wonderful.  I'm eating it on a Tuesday after baking it on Sunday and it's just as good.  This recipe is sooooooooooooooooooo moist.  My hubby doesn't like dessert and he was super impressed with this.  I'm going to try it with wheat flour and Splenda to see if I can turn this into a daily, healthy treat for us.

UPDATE: I massacred this recipe.  Whole wheat flour, splenda, and margarine.  I was afraid I was wasting my precious bananas but this still turned out great.  So if any of you want to make this healthier - you can!

This recipe was so good. I added one egg, cinnamon, and vanilla extract to the recipe. Sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top and then cooked it for about ten minutes longer.

This banana bread was so delicious, but fell apart when cut.  Could it be because I substituted brown sugar for the white?  Regardless, I'll try the recipe again, especially because my son (allergic to all dairy) was able to eat it!  Thanks.

I make this often and my family actually likes it better with fat free vanilla yogurt rather than shortening or butter! I sometimes add choclate chips and coconut-YUM!

Wonderful recipe! I actually had eggs, but tried this just because of the reviews. The bread cooked for 1 hour and 20 minutes for me, and came out a dark brown (but not burned) with a nice soft interior. I used four bananas because I had them on hand, and only 3/4 cup of sugar. Highly recommended!

This is easy and tastes great.  Just make sure to let it cool well before removing it from the pan, or it will break apart.

This is an excellent vegan recipe! I replaced the shortening with 1/2 cup of natural unsweetened applesauce. The white sugar and bananas are enough for sweetness. I also replaced half of the unbleached white flour with wheat flour. For the spices, I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of ground cloves (roughly) and a dash of nutmeg.

This is a great bread.  I doubled the recipe and used a cup of milk in place of two bananas.  I also generously sprinkled a cinnamon & sugar mixture that also includes allspice, nutmeg, cloves and ginger on top of the batter before I baked it.  It make a crispy suguary top that was delicious.  I definitly recommend this recipe!

This was really good.  I had to use butter flavored Crisco so it was too rich (I think I'll try applesauce next time), but I really liked it.

The bananas make it more of a heavy bread.  I think using some milk in place of the last banana might make it lighter.  But my daughter is allergic to eggs and I'm so glad to have this recipe.

Note--I accidentally overcooked it a bit.  The texture is softer than with normal banana bread.

I desperately need to go to the store, but I wanted to make something with the two brown bananas I had.  Being out of butter and eggs, my hopes for a good dessert were not very high.  But I found this recipe and made it last night, substituting half a cup of milk for the third banana.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  It is just as rich and dense as any banana bread that I've had. I would make it again, bare cupboards or not.

This recipe was a fabulous success.  I added a half cup of milk, a tbsp of vinegar, a tsp of vanilla and a cup of chocolate chips to the mix.  I substituted baking light olive oil for shortening.  In hindsight, because it turned out a shade too sweet, I should have substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown sugar instead.

We really enjoy this recipe at my house, it works really well with brown rice flour and coconut sugar substitutions. I also add half a cup of shaved coconut and half a cup of dark chocolate chunks. We bake it in a brownie pan for 45 minutes and it turns out much nicer.

Made it for my staff. They LOVED it. I used softened butter because I didn't have shortening on hand, added mini chocolate chips and an extra banana because the bananas I had were on the smaller side. I baked it in a bundt pan because it makes a pretty cake/loaf and I didn't have my loaf pan. It took 45 minutes to bake at 325 degrees -  I would suggest checking it at that time - otherwise you risk over-baking your bread which means it will be dry. 

Will definitely continue to use this recipe!

I love this recipe I've made it a couple of times so far. I've added about a half of cup of chopped walnuts to it. It makes the best bread for my Cuban coffee in the morning. Also instead of using regular bananas try Cuban bananas they are a little more sweeter. It usually takes about six to eight cuban bananas to equal the amount of regular bananas needed.

This was wonderful! But I only gave it 4 stars because I modified it. Instead of shortening I used applesauce and added vanilla and cinnamon. It tasted like bread pudding (so moist)!

This is the best banana bread!!! I have made banana bread since I was a kid and this rivals any other recipe (vegan or not).  You can add whatever you'd like or make it without any additions (choc. chips, nuts, etc).  I use VERY ripe bananas.

Excellent! I was skeptical of making bread without an egg. My husband said this was the best banana bread he had ever had. He liked it because it wasn't too sweet.

-I omitted the butter and instead added a single serving of cinnamon applesauce (about 1/2 a cup).

-I added a tsp of vanilla for flavor

-I also added 1/2 a cup of finely chopped walnuts

I added the rest of the ingredients and made into muffins. Turned out perfect!

This recipe is OUTSTANDING. I've baked banana bread for coffee shops the normal way but this recipe exceeds anything I've ever made before, and I've made a ton of banana bread. Seriously, this is the banana bread that dreams are made of. I used all brown sugar (I didn't have any white), margarine for shortening, added some baking powder, a tblsp or so of cinnamon, about a 1/2 cup of light cream and about 2/3 of a cup of oats. I baked it all in an 8x8 pan for about 35 min at 325. The banana bread that came out is as close to perfection as I've ever gotten: super moist, intense banana flavour, a sweet hit while still tasting smooth and mellow. Thank you! I had no eggs at home so this bread was intended to simply fit my ingredient availability but ended up exceeding all expectations and will now definitely be my go-to recipe!

First time makeing this bread. Not sure how it will turn out I used butter instead of shortning because I didnt have any... Hope it works I saw in a post someone used butter instead and they said it worked well.... Hope they are right. So far it looks good also i used small bread pans they are like 2x4 pans not even sure the size but not the normal size I was able to get all the batter in 3 pans none the less filled half way on each. only thing i should of done was instead of 3 half full maybe 2 half inch from top full ... oh well as long as it tastes good I dont care :P

I wanted to find a recipe for Banana Bread that didn't use eggs.  I followed the instructions but added 1 t cinnamon, a dash of cloves, a dash of allspice and 1/2 t of vanilla.  This was a great recipe!  The bread is moist and flavorful!

I've been using this recipe for a while and love it. This week, almost by accident I made it even better. I didn't have shortening so used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 applesauce. Then I realized afterwards I had left out that last 1/2 cup of flour--which resulted in deliciously moist bread. This is a mistake I will be making again.

This recipe can have substitutions, in order in a 1 quart measuring cup i added 1/3 cup of olive oil, put in 1/2 cup packed brown sugar or less, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 1 of salt, 1/2cup to 2/3 cup of milk, then 3 small thawed black bananas from the freezer.  I added some chocolate chips too for an extra.  I poured this into a 9X9 pan instead of a 8X4, it works just great!  same time 1 hour at 325 F in the oven.  Totally awesome banana bread like almost cake its nice and moist.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe to use, but I always make it even creamier using real butter instead of shortening and 1/4 cup cream cheese! Yum yum even picky eaters like this one!

I cut this recipie in half and took the other's suggestions. I added some cinnamon and 1/4 cup of milk. Turns out I made a very tasty banana bread pudding. I checked it at 60 min. and left it in for an additional 15 min. And I was worried it would be a "dry" bread. I will try it again-this time without the milk.

I added 1/4 cup of milk and 1/2 brown sugar because I was low on the regular stuff. It's certainly affected the flavor but not in a terrible way. It's not my favorite though, and I likely won't make it again. The milk did help with the moisture level but this didn't make any fireworks go off for me.

I made this once about 2 years ago and I did not care for it.  I ran out of eggs again last night and really needed to make banana bread.  
Grudgingly, I went ahead and tried this recipe again.  Like last time, I substituted 1/2 c applesauce for shortening/butter and halved the sugar.  Reading more recent reviews, I added 1 tsp of baking powder.  I baked it in my conventional oven.  
From the last experience, I was not expecting much, just something edible to munch on.  What a surprise that it came out good this time.  Maybe the addition of the baking powder and baking in conventional oven??  
I still prefer the Low-Fat Banana Bread I but wouldn't mind if I ran out of eggs more often!!

Loved it!! I added 1/2 c of milk, and a dash of cinnamon as suggested, and used butter for the shortening.

It was sooooo yummy! Full of texture and flavor. Highly recommend!

This is heavenly. I'm munching on some warm as I write - bliss! I added 3/4 cup of whole milk (but as I used metric, I could perhaps have gotten away with less), half a tsp of cinnamon and substituted half the white sugar for brown sugar. It's moist as anything and the brown sugar gives it extra richness and 'tooth'. This is definitely the easiest and best banana bread recipe I've ever made.

This is the first time I've made an eggless banana bread that didn't taste like baking soda! Thank goodness. My son has severe egg and milk allergies, and I don't like to use shortening so I used a salt-free margarine, and an extra banana in a 9X5 glass bread pan. Added some milk free chocolate chips and it came out great. I did have to cook it for an extra 20 minutes.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I tweaked it a bit. I added 1/4 milk, 1/4 t. cinnamon, and 1 t. vanilla as other reviewers had suggested. It turned out fabulous; dense, moist, and perfect in taste. I will definitely make it again.

i doubled the recipe and i was very cautious not to over mix the batter.  the cake came out moist, but quite crumbly.  my husband said the "other" banana bread was so much better; if only i can find the recipe.  my niece, however, enjoys them and said that the sides, including the top, are somewhat candied.  i agree.

So delicious. I added 1/2 cup sour cream at the same time as the mashed banana, and it made the bread even more moist (if possible). Everyone loved this.

This is a wonderful recipe. The first time I made it, I had two beautiful, done on the inside and done on the outside loaves. My biggest problem has always been having the bread evenly baked, and with this bread I didn't have a bit of a problem with it. It was so good, my kids (5 of them and some of the neigbor hood kids) gobbled both loaves down in a matter of minutes.

Very simple, no frills banana bread recipe! I love that this has no eggs in it. My boys can lick the beaters. Thanks for the post! PS I added some chocolate mini chips to mine for a little flavor and variety second time I made this.

Just the texture I was looking for. Tasted a little salty when warm, but was fine when completely cooled. Has a little bit of  a sticky end result which I like. Thanks for sharing.

These turned out great!  I doubled the recipe to make a bunch of muffins.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and the rest white.  I also added about 1 cup of milk and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Also instead of shortening I used butter.  Yum!!  I had to cook them about 25 minutes per batch of 12 muffins.  Everyone loves them!  Oh yeah, almost forgot.... I also added some chopped pecans.

The taste is quite good but a little too sweet for my personal taste.  Next time I will add only 3/4 cup of sugar instead.  I also added the 1/2 milk like other readers suggested and to be honest I would like to try without it next time to see what the texture is like.  The milk made it very dense (I think) and not "bread" like.  Overall, very good recipe and easy.  I will definetely make it again.

I made some changes.  I'm vegan, so I used raw sugar (same amount) instead of white sugar.  I added a tsp of cinnamon and of vanilla.  I also (accidently) added an extra tsp of salt and baking soda.  It turned out good, so I probably will keep the recipe the way I made it.  My husband thought it was bland, but I can't go by what he thinks.  I told him it was a vegan recipe and so he was already prejudiced against it.

i felt like it needed some spices, although it was very moist.  didn't rise as much as i expected to, but maybe my baking soda is old?

This was a very yummy recipe.  I did what someone else suggested by adding crushed pineapple in place of one of the bananas.  I used whole white flour, used strawberry/banana yogurt in place of the fat, and subbed 3 tablespoons of the sugar with molassas.  I also cooked it in an 8x8" pan and it only took about 35 min. to cook.  Very moist and almost buttery-tasting, which was odd since there was no fat in it!

This had good flavor, but I wasn't crazy about the texture. It was very dense and it didn't rise enough. I don't know if omitting the shortening and eggs was the cause. I used yogurt instead of shortening and added a small amount of coconut. Don't think I'll be making this again.

Very good and simple. I was skeptical at first because there were no eggs in this recipe. Very moist and yummy, no eggs needed. The middle caved some while cooking, but will definitely make again.

Our favorite banana bread recipe. I, too, used 1/2 cup milk and two bananas, plus a bit of vanilla and cinnamon. I've made this bread several times, and it always needs about 10 extra minutes in oven.

this was very very moist and delicious, but for some reason the star ingredient was being overpowered by another.  i think i should've blended it a little longer.  or maybe it was because i made them as muffins (baked for 25) and mini-muffins (baked for 15).  or perhaps i could really tell what was in the batter because i doubled everything  and used butter instead of shortening.  could it be?  no matter, i will be using this batter again.  it's unbelievably moist.

not that this recipe needs another 5 star rating, but i can't resist.  it was excellent!  i even substituted all of the shortening with fat-free vanilla yogurt and it was STILL moist, flavorful and delicious!  i added cinnamon and vanilla like some others did. HIGHLY recommended for a lower calorie (with the yogurt sub) banana bread!!

Great vegan recipe!  I only added vanilla...tastes moist and wonderful!  I made 6 mini loaves and cooked for about 40 minutes.  Can't wait to try this on my non-vegetarian friends!

i made this for my son who can't have eggs, i thought it tasted good but it did not rise well, it turned out he did not like it but everyone else thought it was good, the only reason i am giving it a 4 star is due to the not rising, just wished my son had liked it since it was made for him

Oh, such a great loaf of banana bread! I was looking for a recipe not requiring eggs (we always seem to be running low on eggs), and this was perfect. I changed it slightly: I used ½ cup of white sugar plus 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, I used margarine instead of shortening, I added a few good shakes of cinnamon and a couple handfuls of chopped walnuts, plus I did what other reviewers suggested and used ½ cup milk plus 2 bananas. I ended up having to bake it around 70 or 75 minutes. Wonderful! Dense and banana-y! A wonderful way to use up bananas without using eggs! Thanks, Deborah, for sharing!

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times, it is perfect when you don't have eggs on hand.  I took the advice of other reviews and added 1/2 cup of milk to the recipe.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  Last time I made it I also threw in some applesauce and chocolate chips.  Delicious!  Everyone loves this recipe, it has become a staple in our house (especially for entertaining-it is so quick and easy to make).

I don't know how helpful my review will be, because I changed pretty much everything except the baking soda, salt, and bananas, but it shows how durable this recipe is.  I made it using 1/2 cup minus three tablespoons canola oil, 1/2 cup honey, 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 cup of oat flour, as well as the recommended 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  It came out very moist, sweet, and delicious.  My dad even said it could have used less honey.  A note of warning, no matter how good it smells when it comes out (and it smells pretty good), don't try to eat it hot, or it will turn into a mushy, crumbly mess.  Just be patient, a great piece of  banana bread awaits you when it cools!

This was really easy and really yummy! Even my picky roommate liked it... which is really saying something! I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon, and added about 1/3 cup of milk because my bananas were pretty small. I was absolutely impressed- this one has a permanent place in my book!

I'm not really picky and I also altered it slightly so kind of hard to rate the actual recipe but it tastes good to me.

I modified recipe with 3/4 cup brown sugar and coconut oil. Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Set oven to 350 degrees. Outstanding!

I am so sorry to everyone, I posted to the wrong recipe!  This recipe is awesome and always comes out great!  I tried another with Sour Cream and it was horrible.  I am truely sorry to both the Author and anyone reading this.  This is a loaf that has always worked for me....I'm stupid to have tried another.

Happy Holidays to everyone, I am making loafs of this wonderful banana bread tonight!

It wasn't terrible. The texture is off for someone who is used to breads with dairy and eggs-- it was softer and more gooey. But overall, for a breakfast in a pinch, this recipe was good. I am at high altitude, so I reduced the sugar to 3/4c, used all whole wheat flour and added an extra 1/2 c., and included vanilla extract and an 1/8 c of sour cream.

Very good recipe! My grandson is allergic to eggs so I really appreciate this recipe. Going from other reviews I substituted applesauce for shortening and added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon. I also cut the sugar in half because of the sugar in the applesauce, added 2 tbls. lemon juice and reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp. Very, very good.

Ran out of eggs and was craving banana bread!
I halved the recipe and used 2 bananas. Substituted butter for shortening. Added chocolate chips. Baked at 325 for 45 mins then 350 for 10 mins (wanted to get it a bit browner) and it came out great! Will have to try substituting applesauce for the shortening next time as other reviewers have had luck! I did not add extra milk like other reviewers and it worked out well. Once I added the bananas in with the other ingredients it all came together. Awesome recipe for when you're out of eggs! so quick and easy.

I modified this quick bread a little. I omitted the shortening and added 1/2 cup unsweetened organic applesauce, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup of milk, doubled the bananas and substituted 1/2 of the white granulated sugar for 1/3 a cup of brown sugar. 
Baked as muffins for 25 minutes.

So yummy! I was snowed in with no eggs and 6 overripe bananas so I doubled this recipe. I used the exact proportions however I creamed the bananas with the butter (instead of shortening) and sugar, I think this helped to prevent the dryness others were experiencing.  This made a loaf pan size as well as 12 muffins (I cooked these for 30 mins).

I didn't have shortening so  I used coconut oil. Added vanilla & cinnamon. Had very ripe 4 bananas, it was more than a cup mashed. It turned out great, maybe next time will add 1/2 brown sugar instead of just white sugar

Made this for my daughter who is allergic to eggs (among other things). I used olive oil instead of shortening , read some of the other reviews and added a half cup milk (I used Lactaid milk due to my daughter being lactose intolerant ) I also added cinnamon and vanilla.  Taste way better than the one I made for us with eggs. Will use this one from now on.

the eggless recipe was delicious. I made a couple of tweaks..I only used 1.5 bananas, used only half the sugar. added 2/3 cup of unsweetened desiccated coconut, and more importantly I added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of yogurt. I've made this recipe with these changes several times and added nuts and or chocolate chunks in it..looking forward to adding other dried fruits.

I normally do not go out of my way to make a different recipe than the normal ones I always tend to stick to. Unfortunately I was out of baking powder and butter, and then I found this recipe. I must say I am amazed with the turn out of how basic the ingredients are in this recipe. I made 12 perfect muffins out of it, and I even forgot to cream the butter and sugar! I will be making this again! My 2 year old and I love this recipe!

Very moist and delicious recipe! I used a 1/2 stick Smart Balance "butter" stick instead of shortening since there wasn't any available. I also only used 1/2 cup sugar instead of the whole 1 cup. The flavor was still rich and plenty sweet even with the decrease in sugar.

This wonderful recipe can be made GLUTEN FREE and VEGAN! 
I made muffins with it and here are the subs I used: 
-Spectrum Shortening instead of regular (it's non-hydrogenated and made with organic palm oil).
-Vegan sugar (regular sugar is made with bone char)
-1.5 c Gluten free flour (Grandpa's Kitchen Flour Blend).
I also added cinnamon and 1 tsp. of vanilla and  2T of coconut milk.
I baked these about 10 minutes less than the regular time and these turned out so moist and tasty and the flavor was great! The whole house smelled like bananas! Next time I will be trying the bread and adding vegan chocolate chips to the mix as well! Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)

Not a lot of ingredients which is great when you don't have a lot of time.  This turned out really good.  I did sprinkle a little cinnamon in the mix.  Definitely recommend.

Not a fan! I added cinnamon, nutmeg and walnuts and it still had no flavor. It also seemed undercooked even after it tested done. More of a thick brownie consistency than bread consistency. Just not my preference.  My 2 & 3 year olds ate the batter with a spoon though!

Delicious. We made this with the following substitutions:

Butter instead of shortening
A few tablespoons molasses and less sugar
Baking powder instead of baking soda
Half cup of whole wheat flour substitution for white
Giant squirt of vanilla extract
Pecan halves on top
Round cake pan instead of loaf
45 min cook time instead of 60

That's a lot of substitutions. My apologies, was working with what I had and trying to get a few healthier ingredients in - all in a hurry.  It still tasted great!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out great.  The second time I made it I added about 1/4 cup of coconut milk (my husband is vegan).  It turned out even better!  This is a keeper!

I made this recipe for my vegan brother and his wife.  It was my first vegan bread attempt, and I thought it looked suspiciously "wrong" before cooking it, but it did turn out great.  They loved it, and we non-vegans gave it a shot and thought it was good too.  This bread has a strong banana flavor, which hides any thought that ingredients are missing.  I'm not going to swap this for my current banana bread recipes, but for those with dietary restrictions, this one is a winner!

Followed the suggestions of subbing yogurt (vanilla) and molasses = BEST BANANA BREAD EVER! Thank you! I had to beat my bf's mom's bread - and he said I did ;)

Absolutely delicious!!! I made it and added ½ cup of milk like BRIGAKOSSI suggested. The results were fabulous. I will definitely make it again with some added spices for a kick.

I can't make a definitive review of this  receipe as i did make some modifications.  The bread was moist and fluffed up nicely however in my variation it was a bit bland. For people interested in using whole wheat flour and half the fat content i would suggest the following:
1/4 cup butter/shortening, a  1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, at least one tsp cinnamon, another banana, and about 1/4 cup more sugar.  I would also suggest checking up on your bread around 20-25 minutes into the cooking time. I found the bread to cook faster than the recipe suggested. I would also suggest some nutmeg (1 tsp) for those who enjoy a nuttier banana bread.

I tried this recipe and used yogurt in place of the shortening. It was a very dense, sticky bread. VERY tasty but I like a lighter bread better.

I made this yesterday, and the only change I made was to use 1/2 cup applesauce instead of shortening. I did not care for this recipe much. The bread is rather "rubbery" in texture . Makes a small loaf,without any eggs or baking powder. Sorry, but there are much better banana bread recipes on this website.Perhaps with the shortening it may have been better.....

This was very tasty. Mine took a bit longer to cook.  But it was worth the wait.

I'm almost ashamed to admit this was the first time I've ever made banana bread!!! So glad I used this recipe though; I will definitely make it again. It was very moist and simply delicious. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top and wish that I read the suggestion about peanut butter...Yum!

Easy, few ingredients, moist and mild.  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 oil, 1/2 orange juice, sprinkled it with cinnamon and nuts.  Baked for 1/2 the time in 2 round cake pans instead of loaf pans.  Will make again! It was gone before it was totally cool!!!

I made this tonight following the milk suggestion in place of one banana, and instead of the fat free vanilla yogurt mentioned, I tried vanilla Silk yogurt (soy product) as it was all I had in the house. WOW! It turned out fabulous and will quickly become a house favorite I'm sure!

I made this recipe over the weekend.  I didn't have any shortening so I took advice from other reviewers and made one loaf with applesauce.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  My oven is really weird so I only cooked it for 45 minutes!  DELICIOUS!  Then I made another loaf but made it with Fat Free vanilla yogurt.  This one came out even better!  I will be making this recipe for now on.  I love that there is no eggs!  My SIL just gave me a ton of bananas so I will be in banana bread heaven with this recipe!

I use Spectrum organic shortening -- no cholesterol -- so this becomes a no-cholesterol, no-trans fat treat!  If you've never made banana bread, don't worry that it's very dry before you put the bananas in -- they'll make up for it. Also, for fun I tried putting in a couple handfuls of chocolate chips -- yum!!!!!!!!

This is an easy and delicious recipe, I've made it twice in less than a week. I made these modifications: I used margarine instead of shortening; half a cup of whole wheat and one cup of white flour, and a hearty dash of cinnamon. I can't keep it in the house.

I made this and added vanilla and cinnamon it was delicious.  I tried one loaf and made 2 more!  I was so happy becuase I had no eggs and about 9 bananas I had to use up!  Perfect solution!
