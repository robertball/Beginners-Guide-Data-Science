I tried this recipe last night for the first time and my husband and I loved it!  This recipe is easy, quick and tasty.  I only added 4 Tbsp of curry powder to the mixture instead of the 5 listed because of personal preference and the chicken turned out perfect. We really liked the spicy flavor. Great recipe!  Will definitely use again.

I made this tonight and it is WONDERFUL!!!!  I cut the recipe in half.  I used a pyrex dish to put 4 drum sticks in and just laid them out in a row.  I cooked for 5 minutes, turned the chicken over and cooked 5 more minutes.  Then removed the covering and turned over again and cooked another 5 minutes.  I took the cover off for the last 5 minutes to make the sauce thicker.  This turned out great in taste and looks!!  

I also made another recipe from this site called "Italian Chicken".  It was good too.  But, the Loga's Microwave Chicken was better.  It was more tender, faster, and much less mess and tending too.  Gosh, I will surely be making this time and time again!!  I even took a picture of it...need to try to figure out how to add the picture to the site.  

Thank you for this reicpe!  Oh..also..my husband that claims he isn't that crazy about curry...he loved it!  LOL!

When I first saw this recipe, I thought "is this a joke?" Chicken legs cooked in the microwave? Well, I will be eating those words. I have tried it twice now, once with only 1 leg, scaling the recipe to just 1 serving. I was totally shocked that it actually tasted ok. But, since I scaled it down so much, my ketchup mixture burnt. So, I decided to give it another try with 2 legs and more of the ketchup/curry mixture. I'm new to curry, so I did use a lot less than called for, and since I was only doing 2 legs I cooked it 6 minutes - stopping after 4 to let it rest and continuing on for 2 more minutes. Leaving it to rest & continue cooking outside of the microwave. It's my belief that for this to work, you really need to know your microwave & be comfortable cooking in it. If you have an older one, it probably doesn't cook as fast & if you have a newer one (like mine) it can cook the heck out of stuff. This is extremely easy, economical and really quite good.

The seasoning was tasty, a lot like 57 sauce. The only thing I didn't care for was that the chicken looked so unappetizing. But the microwave didn't heat up my kitchen like the oven would; so that's a decent trade off. I served this with brown rice.

Surprisingly pretty good.  I've made this a couple times now and found that even with a newer microwave 15 minutes doesn't come close to getting the chicken to a safe temperature. Also needed a few things to jazz it up, I added a little salt and garlic powder as well as a bit of chicken stock because the first time I made this the sauce burned while the chicken barely cooked.  Also, cooking it at a lower setting for longer resulted in a better overall dish (I did about 25-30 minutes at 70%).  One addition that was fun was adding and mixing in a can of rinsed pinto beans with about 5 minutes left, which resulted in what was basically bbq beans.

This was really good for chicken from a microwave! I've had this recipe in my box for years and finally made it; I'll be making chicken like this again. It's a bit messy to eat (micros don't make crispy chicken), but it tastes great. I used 1 T less curry powder and didn't measure the cayenne, just shook some in. Mine took 15 min- I checked at every five and turned them over and spooned sauce on all the legs. Next time I'll serve this with rice because the sauce was very yummy.

I only needed to cook 4 (very large) legs so I followed another reviewers advice and did 3 five minute stints in the microwave, turning and then venting. I reduced the sauce by 25% but my family didn't love the sauce as much as I did so next time I'll reduce it by half (1/2 c ketchup, 2 T curry powder, and just a dash of cayenne).  The sauce was amazing spooned over brown rice.

When I first put this together, I started to wonder if it was a joke of a recipe. Mixing all that curry with ketchup was just seemed bizarre. But my hubby really likes it! SO easy. Will definitely be making it again.
Thanks

Made 3 drumsticks and adjusted recipe accordingly.  Very nicely cooked and the spice was just right.  Not a great curry lover, but this was quite enjoyable.  Will make it again, for sure.

This was a huge hit! I cut curry back to 3 tbsp., added 1 tbsp. minced garlic & used half ketchup/half salsa.   I added extra cheese on top.   Yummy, quick & easy.

I had three bone-in thighs. Was almost out of curry powder, so used about a tablespoon each of curry powder and curry paste and a quarter teaspoon of cayenne. Nuked it for three five-minute periods at 80%, with a rest to check temperature and turn over between each. Delicious.

Caution: Microwave ovens don't heat very evenly, as anyone who has tried to eat a Hot Pocket can tell you. So when microwaving a large piece of chicken, there is a fairly high chance that spots within the chicken will be under-cooked, and therefore at a higher risk of spreading food-borne illness. Regular ovens heat uniformly and provide a much more predictable method of heating the meat all the way through.

I flipped the chicken legs and put more excess sauce on them halfway through the cooking. Also added soy sauce, along with substituting garlic powder for the curry, added these to the ketchup mixture. Turned out great!

Very tasty , easy, and quick!  I made it with drums and thighs, and made extra sauce (for the amount of chicken I used).  I turned the chicken over  after 7 minutes.  I found that 12 minutes did not cook the chicken all the way; cooked it 4 more minutes.  Nice with brown rice.
