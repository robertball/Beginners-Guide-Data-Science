A delicious classic similar to the peperonata from Sicily. I used fresh basil and oregano instead of salt and pepper. This was a treat at my in laws every Sunday and I still make it weekly. The leftovers are happily tossed with penne pasta or put inside a risotto the next day and I think my family loves it more for the leftovers! Serve this with crusty Italian bread to sop up the juice! Thank you homecook626 for sharing this simple yet wonderful recipe.

Way good!  I added oregano (we are Italian)   I found that 30 mins was a little to much.  Next time I will cut my veggies bigger - that should take care of that !

This was very good! A nice healthy side dish. My only change is that I added fresh grated parmesan cheese at the end.

This is fantastic!!! I wish I had fresh herbs on hand, but since I didn't, I added a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar and some chunks of soft goat cheese.  This accentuated the flavor of the slightly caramelized roasted vegetables. I will be making this again.

I add two or three types of gourmet mushrooms, sometimes a red or yellow "bell" pepper, and a few fingerling potatoes..  I steam them, starting with the densest vegetable like mushrooms, potatoes & peppers, then adding summer squashes & chopped eggplant.  At the end I sprinkle liberally with a good quality swiss cheese broiled to melt.  Watch the broiling process carefully!!!

This is a great recipe that I’ll repeat often. It’s simple and I even add some to a neighbor who dropped by.  Good combination of roasted vegetables.

This was delicious. When I reheated it, I added some leftover canned corn and it was perfect!

Very enjoyable!  Added cubed red potatoes, giving them @ 10 minute head start.  Cut all ingredients into smaller sizes for quicker roasting while maintaining fork-tender firmness.  Added about 1 tsp. oregano; personal preference.  
Most certainly will make again, and again.

Just started to eat baby eggplant. This was perfect. Used up all the tiny tomatoes from my yard, added a pepper for my husband and as recommended oregano and foil. We added fresh mozzarella for the last 10 minutes. Loved it

Really good. Made enough for one and added a sprinkle of dried oregano and basil.  Someone said the egg didn't cook, but you must put a lid on the pan so it can steam.  Came out perfect.

This was very good! My husband doesn't like eggplant. We were given one, so I made myself a midnight snack. I made a much smaller quantity and pretty much eyeballed the ingredients, probably using proportionally more olive oil. (Not sure you can really go wrong.) Think next time I'll try adding mushrooms.

Made as per recipe, needed help with seasonings. I served this with a cajun turkey sausage on the side and that helped a lot. This recipe is a good start..
