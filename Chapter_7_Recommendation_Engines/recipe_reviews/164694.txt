These fries are great! My sister made them, so I know they took some extra time to make, but the end result was wonderful!  A big problem baking sweet potato fries is that they don't get crunchy enough to mimic fried sweet potatoes, but adding the Rice Krispies coating adds that extra crunch!  We could not stop eating these!

Bags to shake the flour & topping worked well - less mess/quicker.  I also increased the spices to 1/2 tsp (except for the C.pepper).  I am surprised how crisp the fries were.  The Mayo/mustard dip is nice too. This recipe is a winner.

These turned out awful :-( They had no flavour at all. I used two sweet potatoes instead of three, and I ran out of coating mix way before I ran out of sweet potatoes. After cooking them in the oven at 300 degrees for 45 minutes, they were still hard. The coating did come out crunchy, which is the only thing about this recipe that worked.

These were great! The toppings didn't really stick to the sweet potatoes as much as a thought it would and in fact it made a huge mess! After they were cooked thought--HOLY COW--so good! I mixed equal parts of yellow mustard and mayo to dip  them in and the tanginess of the mustard really complemented the sweetness of the potatoes. So crunchy and delicious it's hard to believe they are so good for you (well, minus the mayo!)
