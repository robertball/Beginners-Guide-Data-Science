Fabulous recipe. made it for the parents and they loved it. However, for a less fattier recipe I changed the ground beef to ground turkey. Takes out more than 50% of the fat. Used Italian Seasoned Stewed Tomatoes for a little extra seasoning and I also cooked the peppers a bit longer. Added shredded cheese to the top for the last few cooking minutes. NICE 'N' EASY!

Everyone loves this dish! I boiled the peppers for five minutes to soften. Used one pound beef and 1/2 pound garlic sausage. One 28oz can crushed tomatoes in place of whats called for and I added a diced red pepper to the onion saute. I also added a healthy tablespoon of herb de provonce and a little oregano. The last ten minutes I topped the peppers with motz cheese.

This was my first foray into making my father's favorite dinner...and it was a HIT. Although a little more labor intensive than I had imagined, the end result was true comfort food. I made a few tweaks to the reciped: Subbed 1/2 cup of meat for Italian sausage and added fresh garlic. The recipe made more than enough for three peppers. I could have easily gotten two more out of it so I froze the rest. This mixture could definitely be made ahead and frozen for a quick dinner.

Hubby wanted Stuffed peppers, i didnt know how to make em.  First time at this site was happy to find this easy recipe...I suggest altering the recipe just a lil COOK for 45 min. covered or the peppers will NEVER get done.  Tasted great, very good flavor after the peppers finally got tender.  My son wouldn't even try em so hubby and i will have leftovers tomorrow night

My entire family loved these stuffed peppers!  After reading the reviews, I decided to add some garlic & chopped peppers to the filling and increase the baking time to 45 minutes.  Perfect!

Wonderful recipe! My first time ever making stuffed peppers and they were very good. 
My husband loved them. I can see adding just about anything you like to the mix, corn ect. 
The only thing I did different was making my own sauce, this way you can add whatever spices you like.
Thank's this is a keeper, gonna try it on the in-laws now with confidence!

Good start but I added quite a bit to make this recipe amazing. First, blanch the peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes. Brown meat with 1/2 of an onion, 2 cloves of crushed garlic, dashes of celery salt, oregano, basil and chili powder, and 1/4 cup of quinoa.  Drain. Add in rice, water, 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles, 2 diced fresh tomatoes, 3-4 handfuls of fresh spinach and a few dashes of chia seeds. When the rice is tender fill the peppers. Top with a spoonful of pasta sauce and cook in 345 degree oven for 15min. Top with cheese and cook for another 5 min. Pour more sauce over peppers to serve. Great with garlic bread. Delicious!!

I made this for my boyfriend's parents and it was a HUGE HIT!  I'm not great at cooking, but this was super easy and very tasty.  I followed all of the directions on here. The only thing I'm going to change next time I make it, however, is to use Prego sauce.  I used Bertoli and it didn't have the flavor I wanted.  Also, I layered with cheese, then spaghetti sauce, then more cheese.  I left them in the oven to cook a little longer as well.  This is just a great recipe and I will never buy frozen stuffed peppers again b/c I know I can make them way better.  (See picture)

I thought this was very good and would make it again. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a clove of minced garlic to the onion and ground beef. I would add more garlic and rice next time. I baked the stuffed peppers at 350 for about half an hour.

Good starting recipe but based on the ingredients listed I thought it may be a little bland so  I make a few changes.  Pre cooked the rice in beaf broth for more flavor. Used Hunts fire roasted tomatos. Added garlic power and italian seasonings.  Did not add cheese to the meat mixture.  When peppers were almost cooked I poured some spagetti sauce over the top.   My husband loved them.

These peppers are fantastic! They're almost impossible to mess up, they cook quickly, and they're delicious! I like to add a dash of worchestshire to the browning meat. Also, if you use extra lean meat, there's no need to drain it.

I was a little disappointed with this dish.  It came out pretty bland & the peppers were pretty tough after baking for 45 minutes.  I will add a lot more spice next time I make this dish & boil the peppers before hand.

I baked the stuffed peppers for 35 minutes at 350 and they were still not cooked enough for us but flavor was fine so I will bake them a little longer next time.  I cut the recipe in half so used 1 can of diced tomatoes and left out the stewed tomatoes and that worked just fine.  I also used some leftover rice so didn't need the water.  Just heated the hamburger, tomatoes and rice together in the microwave before stuffing the peppers.

Really, really good, though I changed quite a bit.  I added a chopped red peppers with the onions and  also basil, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, and balsamic vinegar to the meat mixture.  I only added one can of diced tomatoes and substituted about half a cup of spaghetti sauce for the stewed tomatoes.  I also added mozzarella cheese to the meat mixture. That made the entire thing very creamy.  Then more mozzarella cheese on top during the last 5 or 10 minutes of cooking.

I didn't like the way they were put together, i'll go back to mixing all the ingredients in a bowl then stuffing the peppers and let them cook in the peppers. (boil the peppers first) and bake them for 1 hour at 350 degrees or untill done.

Good basic recipe but next time I swap out one of the cans of the tomatoes for a can of rotel's tomatoes with diced chilies.  And it needs to cook for 45 minutes.

Yes, i changed it some, but the basic recipe is easy and tasty. I will make again and again. 

The  minor changes i made were: I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb mild italian sausage,  basil and garlic diced canned tomatoes, 1 cup instant rice and I halved the peppers so i had more (and smaller portions for my youngest.)

Loved this recipe.  I boiled the peppers for about 5 minutes, but probably would not have had to, because I picked the peppers fresh out of my garden and were super tender.  I added cheddar cheese on top and melted it as they cooked.

Great recipe original way. Now that we're on a post-pregnancy diet, I substituted chicken for the beef and chopped cabbage for the rice. I also boil the green pepper for 5 min before stuffing. Very weight watcher's friendly and delicious.  Cumin adds a nice spice as well.

They asked for stuffed peppers, since we had about 20 come in at once in our garden.  I tweaked this a bit, adding about 1/2 cup of diced green peppers, diced fresh mushrooms, and diced fresh tomatoes to the browning beef.  I left out the stewed tomatoes and used regular rice from the rice cooker instead of uncooked minute rice.  It took a bit longer to bake to get the peppers softer (more like 40 minutes) but when it was all done, it was great!

Definite keeper! Didn't have any leftovers for this one whatsoever. I've tried making stuffed peppers for many years that do not dry out when using ground turkey in place of beef. This recipe is it. Although there were changes to my recipe (9 servings). After cleaning peppers, I microwaved for 5 min., used 2 cups cooked organic brown rice, drained liquid from tomatoes (both types had garlic & oregeno added) and used garlic pepper to spice it up. I also put the mozzerella on top before baking. Good stuff!

My family enjoys this recipe every time I make it. There are only two things I change. The first is that I substitute a can of diced tomatoes for the stewed for the convenience factor. Second, I add way more salt and pepper because it is quite bland without additional seasonings. Otherwise it is a real crowd pleaser.

Baking the peppers for the suggested time did not leave enough time for the peppers to get done. You'll either need to cook the peppers longer or preboil them.  Good flavor, though.

Had this for dinner.... my husband and I both loved it...added Italian seasoning and salt & pepper before baking.  Also cut peppers in half before stuffing. Trying to figure out how many calories are in 1 stuffed pepper.... Anyone know? ricountry@cox.net

I had to cook it a little longer than usual. And next time I may go a little lighter with the water because it was more moist than I thought it was going to be.  But I loved them otherwise.  I added a little garlic to it as well as some crushed peppers.  I'm gonna do this again, but maybe change it up.  I made six of them (2 red bell peppers and 4 green) and boyfriend ate them all in two days.  C:

I tried this recipe and thought that it was a very good recipe.  What made it nice for me, in my family, I am the only one that doesn't like bell peppers.  By cooking the mixture on the stove beforehand, I am able to still enjoy what the family was having without the shell!  :-)  I have used this recipe, like many others, as a starting point (as most cooks do)and added a multitude of things but as a basic recipe it is good.

Really good, easy to make, but the peppers were a little undercooked, probably will benefit from cooking another 10-15 minutes.

I made this with ground turkey, green bell peppers, red bell peppers and 
green chiles and I used brown rice instead of white rice. I added a little bit of corn to my rice and meat mixture and crushed red peppers. I made the stuffed green chiles the same way. My hubby loved it!!!

wonderful!! i halved the peppers and cooked them first and then put them together in the baking dish so it was more convienent to pull of the fridge at supper time and just throw it in the over for 25 min. at 325.
to cook the peppers first i cut them in half removed seeds, stem, membrane and placed in baking dish wish a little water in the bottom and lightly sprayed peppers with olive oil. baked on 200 for about 30 min. Then i drained water out of pan and assembled the stuff pepper halves.  

i also diced up a green pepper and sauted it with the onion to add to the beef mixture just to get more peppers!!

I used 1 Cup of cooked long-grain rice.  You could substitute brown rice if you wanted to. I used one large can of petite-diced tomatos, one small can of tomatos and diced chilis and added two Tbsp of Chili Powder and 2 tsp of Chesapeake Bay seasoning and Italian seasoning along with ground black pepper and seasoning salt. Be sure to get peppers with 4 points on the bottom so they will stand up in the baking pan. Any extra filling I kept hot & poured over the peppers when served. I didn't use the spaghetti sauce or stewed tomatoes at all and my family absolutely loved them.  I will fix them (with the changes) again.

My family really enjoys this recipe. I did substitute 1 serving of cooked couscous to the recipe instead of the rice because we don't like the texture of rice and I also added some Italian seasoning and garlic. This is a real hit.

Very good. Replaced the ground beef with ground pork and added some garlic. I might spice 'em up a bit more next time but they were good as is.

I found this to be very yummy.  The husband loved it! 

I used a lot of italian-style seasonings for an italian flavor. 

Next time I want to try italian sausage with it. 

Yummy! Thanks!

I followed the original recipe, but made the following changes: I added two cloves of garlic, and some chopped red and green peppers to the ground beef/onion mixture.  Instead of the spaghetti sauce, I used the two cans of tomato soup/water misture as found in the Stuffed Green Peppers I recipe.  I covered it and baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  The peppers were still pretty crisp; this was fine for us, but if you like your peppers softer, you would have to bake longer.  Next time, I will bake for at least 1 hour, or precook the peppers.  The prep/cooking time for me was much longer than indicated.  We really enjoyed this, though -- and will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe!  I made this recipe last night and reheated for my parents tonight.  They both thought it was great.  My mom asked for the recipe.  My dad said it brought him back to when he used to have it when he was a kid.  I did use ground turkey (I browned it with a little olive oil).  I topped it with mozzarella cheese before putting in the oven.  Also, I cooked it at 350 for one hour.  Thank you Julie!

I used ground turkey and precooked the rice in chicken broth and they came out GREAT!  I also put the empty peppers in the oven for about 10 minutes before filling them.

My husband & I really enjoyed this recipe....will be making it again!!  The only change I made was not to use spaghetti sauce (not a big fan of it)...instead I just increased the amount of stewed tomatoes and used them and the juice from them to add the necessary moisture.  I had extra of the mixture left over after stuffing the peppers and my husband ate the leftovers by just heating it up and adding some homemade salsa to it. He loved it, too!!

I used yellow and orange peppers rather than green peppers and did not use instant rice.  Instead, I cooked basmati rice in chicken stock for that extra flavour.  I used mild italian sausage for the meat, out of its casings.  I found that the spaghetti sauce really took away from the flavour of the peppers.  Also, this was much tastier as leftovers.  I don't think I will make it again, but I did freeze the stuffing and will eat as a side by itself.  The stuffing is great!

I simplified this a little and cooked the rice mixture in my mother-in-laws homemade tomato sauce instead of the strewed tomatoes. I also used veggie ground round instead of beef (I might also try black beans for another vegetarian option.) It does require a little more baking time than the recipe says, but they turned out great with a little bit of cheddar cheese melted on top!

yum! the only complaint i had is that the peppers were still not quite as soft as i wanted them to be after 45 minutes. i added shredded mozzarella to the tops with ten minutes left and they melted nicely on top. yum! i also left out one of the cans of tomatoes because i didn't have them and they still turned out nice. and i only used half of an onion. i'll definitely make these again! they were moist and very flavorful.

this could be a 5 star but instructing to bake for 20 minutes is not enough. the peppers were hard and raw at 20 minutes. we have them in the oven now for another 20

this is very good. I usually make mine on the stove top, but doing it this way in the oven is so much better. Great recipe, Thanks!!

At first, when I told my housemates that I was making stuffed green peppers for dinner, they were skeptical. By the time dinner was done, though, I had made believers of them all! This is a very tasty dish, and easy to throw together. I did find, though, that the peppers didn't soften very well, which disappointed me. Next time I cook this, I will definitely cover it before baking.

I love these. I make a few changes to mine. I like to add some spicy sausage along with the beef for a little extra kick. I also add petite diced tomatoes along with the spaghetti sauce and mix in some shredded cheese to the filling mixture. I also boil the peppers for about 10 minutes because I like them really tender. These always turn out beautifully!

For those that don't want melted cheese on top, try placing a cube of cheese and a chunk of garlic in the bottom of the pepper before stuffing.  It is really great to reach that.  But I do put some tomato sauce on the top before going into the oven.  Also, I never preboil my peppers.  But, of course, then they take a couple of hours.  But that's my preference.

This turned out pretty well, but next time I think I'll add some garlic to the filling for that extra something.  I left the tomato sauce off for drier stuffed peppers and put a few spices (oregano, parsley, etc) in with the filling instead.  (I did keep the tomatoes in the filling, however.)  You have to be careful the filling isn't too dry or it'll dry out in the oven without the tomato sauce.

The filling tasted a little bland.  I think next time I might use a sausage/hamburger mixture. I will make again but will work on adding a little more flavor.

I prepared the filling and stuffed the peppers the night before and refrigerated overnight. I was worried the peppers would wilt but I baked them the next day topped with spagetti sauce and I thought they turned out delicious! My husband thought it was okay, because he would not eat the green pepper! He loved the filling though.

Great recipe! I made a couple of changes... instead of water I used beef broth and I only used diced tomatoes, but instead of spaghetti sauce I used tomato soup. Big hit with the family! Will make this every couple of months.

I chose this particular recipe as it appeared to be quick and easy. However, I used 1/2 turkey burger and 1/2 ground sausage, 2 cans of fire roasted chopped tomatoes, additional garlic/herb seasoning and cooked them for an additional 10 minutes.  First time for stuffed peppers in this household and they were a hit !

Overall good. Need to find a way to spice it up a bit. I subbed in rice cooked in the rice cooker rather than dry rice. Added in shredded mozzarella at the 25 minute point in baking and then went 10 minutes more. For my oven that worked fine. Used ground turkey. The brand of spaghetti sauce makes a difference. I just grabbed what was on the shelf. Will think harder about that next time.

This was a bit bland for us. I even mixed in extra sauce to the beef filling and it was still not that tasty.  I will not make this recipe again; my son did not care for it at all.

I dont like tomatoes or onions and I'm not big on green peppers, but this combination makes it all taste great!  I only made 3 stuffed peppers (I like the extra stuffing) and it still wasn't quite done after 45 min.  They were still very good.  I have some for left overs so when I reheat it tomorrow they'll be perfect.  Next time I will try baking on 350 instead of 325.

I browned italian turkey sausage, added brown rice, two cans diced tomatoes (italian style), added balsamic vinegar, hot sauce and other seasonings.  I cooked with spaghetti sauce (also added balsamic, hot sauce and basil).  I cooked at 350 degrees for @45 minutes.  these were great!  Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe. I used very big peppers and should have cooked it a bit longer but the dish was wonderful.

My husband hates green peppers, so we used red peppers and a little extra pepper (red & black) & some garlic in the cooking process.  Turned out great.

Too much meat - 1/4 lb per pepper.  I had to cook mine a lot longer to get the peppers past crunchy.

I love these! i like to use regular long grain white rice, and just boil it before i mix it with the meat and sauce. i find they cook nicer and are easier to eat if i halve the peppers, fill them with the mixture, and then top them with heaps of grated cheese. yum! i play with the mixture  a lot too-- if i have leftover chilli, it's really good to just mix that with the rice and stuff the peppers.

We used turkey italian sausage instead to cut down on the fat and yellow and red peppers to add to the eye's delight.  Great dish involving grains, fruit, vegetables, and meat.  Extra tasty with the italian spices.

Wonderful...my boyfriend loved it (he's a tough one to please)I used ground turkey, to cut down on the calories. I cooked the peppers a bit longer so they were more moist, but my boyfriend prefered them more crisp. Just a matter of your taste...

I was very pleased with this recipe, and so was the man of the house. I think next time I will probably add more spices and maybe some different cheeses!

I made this recipe last night, though I made a few changes.  I added in 2 tablespoons of garlic, plus instead of using the spaghetti sauce, I put shredded mozzerella cheese on top of the meat filling - YUM!  My husband loved it.
