I used this only once as it was written since I don't keep seasoning mixes on hand, and normally used the individual seasonings. 

Both times I made this, it was almost entirely used up that same night for pizza with our family of 8.

This was a fun addition to our pizza crust. I did use an egg wash to help the mixture to adhere better. I am going to use on soft bread stix next.  Endless possibilities and combinations!

I used this as a seasoning for homemade croutons, which I ground up and used as a coating for Chicken Parmesan. This is fabulous! After using the batch I made for the chicken and seeing how good it was, I made up another double batch for my pantry.

RUN to your kitchen and make this, you will not be sorry.  This Pizza Dust knocks any pizza  out of the park. I basted my crust with garlic butter then sprinkled on. Added a little more after topping. I put everything in my mini chopper and blended it all together.

I usually buy pizza seasoning online from a spice house so when the kids asked for pizza popcorn on movie night I knew I was out and panicked. With the stuff I buy I always have to add parm and this one had everything. I have to admit its way tastier than the one I purchase and made with things I always have on hand anyways. Soooo good thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This combination is wonderful on pizza crust, pizza, popcorn, Italian dishes, etc.  I have a container made up in the fridge at all times.  It is great on any item that uses Parmesan cheese.  I first made this, to use on 'Paula's Bread Sticks' from AR.

I love the pizza dust sprinkled on at pizza places.  This is the first time I've gotten a recipe for it.  Made it tonight for my cheap frozen pizza and it was great!

Made this as written and it was a hit w/ my toddler - she kept licking it off of the stromboli crust I had sprinkled it on, lol. I think I'll add a bit more garlic salt flavor for next time.
