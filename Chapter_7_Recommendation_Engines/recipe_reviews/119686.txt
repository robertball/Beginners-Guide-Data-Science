Delish!  I chose this recipe because I wanted my ingredients to go into the peppers raw and cook slowly in the oven all together. Most of the other recipes have you cooking everything first.  I tripled the recipe to 6 red and yellow peppers, and wedged them perfectly into a deep baking dish.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough sauce on the bottom of the dish to wet the insides of the peppers as you are eating.  I will add AT LEAST another cup of sauce next time.  Even my teenagers ate this!

I have been making a similar version of this recipe for years except I never put the sauce in the meat mixture before!  It did add some additional flavor to the meatball.  I now cut my peppers in half instead of cutting the top off.  That way I can serve a smaller portion and have leftovers the next day.  I don't use ground beef but a mixture of half ground lean turkey and half fresh country sausage (full flavor).  My kids don't like peppers so I always double the meat mixture and make extra meatballs with sauce.

As the name states, this is a classic dish.  I thought it tasted really good, and so didn't my husband. I took the advice of another by adding more sauce but not a full cup (3/4ths). My husband is a little picky when it comes to these familiar dishes... because he tends to favor his mother's versions over mine. With this recipe, though, he kept talking about how tasty it was and how I should make it again (and I shall)!

I made this with a few changes and it was excellent.  My husband loved it!  I had to double the recipe and I actually used a whole jar of Classico Italian Sausage pasta sauce. Mixing 1 cup of the sauce in the meat, and after the peppers were stuffed I generously poured the rest of the jar on top and in the bottom of the dish. I omitted the Worcestershire sauce and the onion and I added garlic powder. I cooked the 4 stuffed peppers for 1 1/2 hours.  This is our new favorite dish!

Wonderful start/base! I used Boca Burger instead of high-fat hamburger, brown rice, and tomatoes in addition to the spaghetti sauce. Added bread crumbs to the top 15 minutes before finished and it was a hit, even with the beef eaters!

These were delicious...I made 6 peppers to have leftovers and My hubby ate 4 and I ate 2. 0 leftovers! He said I could open a restaurant the way I have been cooking lately!

Really good.  Added a lot more sauce and I had to cook it a lot longer.  Closer to 1 1/2 hrs.

These turned out perfectly! I used ground turkey breast instead of beef to reduce the fat...very good nonetheless.

Like the last poster, I like the flavors of this recipe because you are not pre-cooking everything.  Make sure the insides are cooked enough though.  It is hard to tell without cutting it open.

Tasty. I chose this recipe because it is stuffed with raw meat then baked. It was pretty good but I did add minced garlic and garlic powder into the meat. When there was about 5 minutes left of baking time I topped each pepper with a slice of provolone cheese. Served with angel hair pasta and wilted spinach. Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loved this, even my 2 and 1 year olds. I made it with ground turkey because we don't eat beef and added cheese to the mix. Also baked it for 90 minutes per other reviews. Absolutely fabulous!

I doubled recipe and used 1 small onion minced, added about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp oregano, basil,salt and garlic.  I put 2 cups of spaghetti sauce in pan and simmered covered on stove top for about 30 - 35 minutes.

Yum! I gave it a 4 because I made a few changes. I used a whole jar spaghetti sauce, added chopped garlic, garlic powder, some bread crumbs, italian seasoning to the meat, used egg whites, baked 20 mins at 425 then 30 mins at 400 and topped with some part skim mozzarella cheese. But I loved the technique of boiling the peppers first and then adding ingredients uncooked. It is much easier and tastier than cooking first. I had never tried it this way and will always make it this way from now on! Thanks!

Very easy to make! I didn't have any spaghetti sauce, so I used tomato sauce instead. Just be sure to add extra seasonings (more onion, fresh garlic, etc) and some extra salt if you use tomato sauce. I like that you don't have the extra step of precooking the meat and rice. A real timesaver!

With such a simple ingredients list, I must admit I was skeptical, however it truly was excellent.  The only two changes I made were to add 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic, and I used half an onion.  Very good recipe!

Easy, Yummy, and Fast Preperation!  I changed the portion to 6 and I used all the extra peppers from my garden!  They were smaller than the ones you'd buy at the store, so I had plenty of extra meat/stuffing.  I hollowed out some tomatoes and filled them with the extra.  They turned out great too!

Good.  Not the best I've ever had - but very easy and good.  The use of spaghetti sauce makes it easy to prepare.

These were almost flavorless and you end up with a giant meatball inside a green pepper shell. Would not make again!

This recipe was excellent.  I used all of the ingredients called for and doubled the recipe.  I did saute half a minced onion and minced garlic from a jar and browned the ground meat (because I read the recipe wrong) before mixing it with the other ingredients and stuffing it.  This cut down on the baking time which was great since my husband and I were "starving."  Liked it so much, I emailed it to my mom and cousin.  Thanks, Donna!

These were delicious.  I did make a few small changes, I omitted the Worcestershire sauce, added some diced green pepper to the mixture and added another cup of sauce (half to the bottom and half to the tops).  I also increased the cooking time to 90 minutes.

VERY good! Bake them an hour and a half with sauce poured generously in the pan and on the peppers. My boyfriend scarfed his down and afterwards admitted he had never liked stuffed peppers before these.

I doubled this recipe, so I can have some leftovers. A couple of changes I made: I added a packet of onion soup mix because I thought the recipe as it was written may have been too bland for my taste (hence the 4 star rating instead of 5). I also used cooked rice and a whole can of Hunt's spaghetti sauce, according to a few other reviewers' suggestions.  All in all, it turned out very flavorful.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe in my rotation.

These peppers turned out great! I did add extra Worcestershire and onions to the mix. The whole family loved them!

Finally a recipe like my mother made!  I doubled the recipe.  I used very inexpensive spaghetti sauce and it was wonderful.  I did season the meat with salt, pepper, and basil.  I did not put the meat to the top of pepper, I left room for sauce to sit on top plus cheese.  I did put additional sauce on bottom of pan which steamed the peppers nicely.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, will definitely use again.

I followed the recipe, i used ground chicken instead, but I felt it needed more seasoning.  Next time I think I'll cook the meat first so I can check the seansoning before serving.  Overall good recipe.

Good base recipe!  Doubled recipe, used more sauces and added more seasoning.  Use a good spaghetti sauce that has lots of depth and flavor.  Took 45 minutes in the convection oven.  Family really liked these - will make again!

I took these to a potluck with the minor change of using miniature peppers instead of full-size. Perfect for a potluck and very tasty. I doubled the recipe and it made 2 dozen with leftover stuffing. It would have made 3 dozen easily. I kept the cooking time the same. I was so glad to have a few left over, which I had for lunch the next day. I froze the leftover stuffing and plan to make a fullsize one for me in the near future. This is on my list of keepers!

The amount of stuffing turned out to be more than 2 peppers' worth (I was using yellow peppers from my friend's garden, so they were a little on the small side), but otherwise very good.  I always add a little onion powder and garlic powder to most things, because what isn't better with a little onion and garlic? I also substituted Italian sausage, as this gives a little more zing than ground beef. I will note that the rice was crunchy after 40 minutes of cooking (it reached 160F after about 35 minutes).  I cooked the remainder (after I pulled out what I was eating for dinner) for another 20 minutes, but the rice was still crunchy.  I recommend cooking the rice ahead of time. But in general, very good! My husband requested that I make this again.

These are great, however I did add a few things to spice up the recipe.  I added italian seasoning, used sausage and ground beef, sauteed the onion w/ some garlic and mushrooms and topped w/ cheese at the end.

This was great!!  I have been looking for a stuffed pepper recipe for a couple years now and I have finally found it! I used a combo of Hunt's Tradition and Hunt's Four Chesses sauce and I did increase the sauce by an extra cup since we are a saucy family.

I had a white pepper and a purple pepper from the Farmer's market and was in the mood to try and re-create one of my mom's recipes that was a fav.  However, she makes in a crock pot which I don't have so I turned here for help.  This recreated it exactly and my boyfriend and I enjoyed!  Omitted onion per my preference and used tomato sauce.  Delish!

I made these (stuffing) exactly like the recipe and loved it. I don't like lots of green pepper (my problem)so I sliced one green pepper and placed a large "meatball" on each slice topped with sauce in the baking dish. It's a hint of green pepper without all the burps!

Just OK... tasted like a meatball inside a bell pepper.  I guess I was hoping the flavors would meld together a little better.  Maybe I shouldn't have used such lean meat?  Not sure.

Mmmmm!  Made these tonight and I have to say they were the best stuffed peppers I've ever had! I love the spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. The meat stuffing was tender and flavorful and I used the entire remainder left from the jar of sauce to pour on top because I love saucy food!  I did add 1 clove of garlic to the meat mixture, because I love garlic and I think it made them that much better.  Thank you for a definite keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly as published. Easy recipe to follow but found beef mixture to be bland and a bit dry, even using an exceptionally flavorful and spicy spaghetti sauce.  Suggest adding minimum half cup of onions, garlic, stewed tomatoes, spices and extra sauce to beef mixture and on top.  Cooking time to 160 internal temp was 1 hr, 15 min.

Very scrumptious! I have never had stuffed peppers with spaghetti sauce before and I was a little skeptical but these were awesome!

Yummy!  The only thing I do different is add cheese to the tops but I love cheese and these are good without too.

I made this for my meat and taters family, and they loved it!  My husband said it tasted a lot better than it looked.  (We don't normally do baked beef meals.)  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad.  I made it for a family of 7, and everyone from the 18 month twins to the 15 year old ate it.  Good recipe.  I did use a little more sauce.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  The only change I made was I added shredded cheddar cheese to the top of the peppers.  I did not pre cook the peppers but I did increase cooking time to 1 1/2 hours.  Served with mash potatoes...Thanks for the recipe

This sounded much better then it tasted. It was very bland; I even added a couple sausage links to boost flavor and that didn't work.  I won't make this version of stuffed peppers again.

Great recipe!  My four year old son has requested that I make this again!  He usually hates everything other than Chicken nuggets! Very easy to make, doubles the recipe and it was perfect!

good recipe.  only suggestion is to cook rice first.  this recipe leaves the rice undercook and still hard.  add cooked rice to basics of this and this is perfect stuffed peppers.  i also make my own sauce which is just a preference as I don't really like jar sauce.

This is now my favorite stuffed pepper recipe! I had never thought of parboiling the peppers first, but it really helped to make the peppers not so overpowering. I wish I had added more sauce; I definitely will add more the next time. It was sooooo good that I just wanted to keep lapping it up! This recipe's a keeper!!!!
