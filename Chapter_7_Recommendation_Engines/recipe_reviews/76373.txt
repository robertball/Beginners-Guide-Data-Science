Since my heritage is Puerto Rican, I grew up on Cuban cuisine as well as native ones.  One of my favorites is picadillo.  This is very close to the way my mother made the dish.  However, I find it best to chop up the raisins, capers and olives (no nuts) and mix them in.  The reason as mentioned in other reviews is that people don't like biting into an olive or caper or even a raisin.  The flavor comes through.  Also, if there is too much broth, I strain the meat mixture, put it aside, and boil down the broth separately.  Then I add the meat back into the remaining broth.  If you cook the meat in broth too long it loses flavor.

Suprisingly flavorful, sweet, spicy and complex. Goes excellent with rice, or better yet gorditas. One of only two recipes I have tried on here that is knock out delicious.

Trying to keep the cholesterol content down, I substituted ground chicken for the beef, and low fat chicken andouille for the chorizo.  The result was a delicious picadillo that was quite a hit at home.  Being so successful there, I made another batch to bring into the restaurant where I work, and the kitchen staff devoured it enthusiastically.  This recipe will become a staple for me.

This was very good. I cooked it with the lid off to try and get the broth to thicken. it didn't so I added 1 Tbs of cornstartch (mixed with cold water until smooth) so the sauce would be thicker. Served it with cornbread. It ws very good, but my husband and kids only thought it okay...

Both my husband and I agree that this tastes just like his Venezuelan mother's Picadillo that I wished I had gotten from her before she passed away. I followed the recipe, using vegetarian (soy) chorizo (that I buy at the grocery store in the refrigerated section) instead of the pork chorizo. Tastes the same, but with less fat and "msytery meat". Serve Picadillo over fluffy long grain white rice or thicken it with a beef gravy mix and bake with a topping of mashed potatoes and cheese to make a sort of Latin shepherd's pie.

Pretty good picadillo recipe.  My Cuban father always made this growing up.  I somehow didn't get the recipe.  This is pretty close.

I fixed this for dinner last night and prepared it as written. It was the BEST, The chorizo added something special. I served it over spagetti squash for something different. Big hit. My kids almost licked the dish. I forgot the lime and almonds, didn't miss em'

I made this today for lunch for my family. It was a hit! (and I had my doubts as some family members don't like raisins or olives or vinegar). But I had Picadillo growing up and remembered the green olives and raisins and loved it then. The Chorizo is a little weird because of what it is made out of but I just closed my eyes and made it as is. Thanks for the walk down "memory lane".
We all really liked it.

I really enjoyed this dish. I like the contrast of the saltiness from the capers and olives with the sweetness of the raisins. Although next time I'd like to try it with dried currants instead. Served it over rice. Delicious!

After reading other's reviews, I halfed chili powder, cayenne, and paprika to make it less spicy.  I also added Idaho potatoes, and omitted the olives.  This dish was delicious!  My husband is Cuban and grew up with Picadillo and he LOVED it!!  I made homemade fried plantains and white rice on the side.  Delicious!!  Thank you!

Now this is picadillo! There are a few taquerias here in Central Texas that come close to this. Wrap some up in a flour tortillo for breakfast and you've gone to heaven. Don't tweak the recipe until you've tried it; the olives and raisins are what makes it special.

Must beg to disagree with the reviewer who says this isn't Cuban! Though I will concede that my Lenanese-Cuban side of the family might add almonds, cinnamon (& maybe the flatbread in the photo), the rest of the recipe is pretty true to most Cuban cooks' versions, including my mom's & mine. Frankly, those tweaks are great by me. I love fusions & I'm especially fond of middleastern food. "Picadillo" is just a humble, mountain folk "hashed/chopped meat" dish. I'm sure Mexico & others have versions using their own assortment of ingredients. This one's nice. :)

First off, you don't need the olive oil as there is enough fat in Chorizo and ground beef.  The cinnamon is a little overpowering so I would reduce that next time.  This tastes like a fancy sloppy joe.  I chopped up the raisins since I dont like raisins and followed someone else's suggestion to simmer the raisins and capers with the mixture so the flavors could meld more.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the omission of the almonds and olive oil.  Its a good hearty recipe.  We served it over white rice.  Will make again with less cinnamon and will try adding achiote to go with my puerto rican heritage.

While this is good, it's not Cuban  - traditional Cuban food does not have spicyness to it (so none of the peppers) and picadillo while traditionally having raisins and olives does not have almonds or sausage in it. It's a nice twist, but it's not exactly Cuban - maybe Cuban fusion. Good recipe, though.

I omitted the raisins and capers because I can't stand either of them, and I wish I hadn't upped the amount of olives I threw in. We did, however, really enjoy it. There were so many flavors, and they all worked really well. Served it with plain white rice. Good stuff. Thanks!

Now, I must state that I know next to nothing about Puerto Rican food. There is one restaurant in San Rafael, Ca I go to and my fiancee can not stop ravign about the food there. His favorite dish is the picadillo. I did make a few modifications due to a shortage of ingredients. I omitted the bell pepper since when I got home I found out the one I had had spoiled. Also I didn't have any raisins on hand. NO onion since I hate them, I added 6 cloves of garlic instead. * I have since doubled the spices and it is very tasty. I used 1.5 cups fresh tomatoes because I had some from the garden that needed to be used. Chicken stock since I didn't have any beef. NO chorizo sausage at the store so I bought linguica and cut it into thin rounds Lastly no almonds since I am allergic to them. With all these modifications I made some fabulous puerto rican chili! Served with beans, this is amazing. I am adding this to my winter recipes. Generally cheap to make once you have the capers and olives on hand.

This was amazing. I was skeptical as I was throwing everything together but it turned out wonderful. My husband, who doesn't like olives, had a 2nd plate. I will definitely be making this again.

To quote Pirates of the Caribbean, kinda sorta! . . . "recipes are more guidelines as opposed to a set of rules!" My family just finished eating this tonight for supper (actually my 2 year old is still eating, but it is her fourth helping!) I mostly followed the recipe until the last couple directions. I went ahead and added all the ingredients and then simmered. I like my food to have a chance to 'flavor meld'. I tasted it after it had been simmering for a while and thats when I made it mine! So many people feel that they have to follow a recipe exactly . . . then the food is ready, you eat, and you go away thinking, "man I can't cook". But that is not the case. Use the recipe as a guideline and then keep adding things that taste good to you. Once you've got the 'flavor' that you like. Serve it up and enjoy it. Recipes are way overrated. Make it like it's written and if the flavor isn't right for you, change it up and make it right for you. All that to say, this recipe was ok as is, but then I made it my own and my family loved it. They gobbled it up and asked for more!

I thought this was just okay, but my boyfriend loved it and he's from southern Florida, so he has much more discriminating taste in Cuban food than I do.  I did have to double up on all the spices (again southern Florida boy) and I replaced the beef stock with white wine.

Good deep flavor.  I could taste both the green olives and the raisin, which is why I like Picadillo.  Only one complaint... Really lost its flavor over night.  Leftovers were very bland and ended up tasting like just your run of the mill Sloppy Joes.  With that said, I will make this again, just won't eat any leftovers.

dh doesn't like olives or capers, yet I still put them in and he adored this. The only changes I made was omitting the chili powder and using ground turkey and soyrizo to cut down on fat. We ate it with middle eastern flat bread inspired by the photo.

This is a great recipe. I usually make it with a little tomatoe paste and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. In many latin american countries, this is the recipe used for stuffing empanadas. You can buy the empanadas discs ready to stuff. Great for parties or as apetizers.

It looked like a lot of spices, but was wonderful!! I added some salt, omitted the lime. We had it with taco's and shredded cheese. The flavours are really great with taco's! I added raisins, chopped almonds, olives, capers and vinegar and let it simmer for a while, because I think in 5 minutes the flavours can not blend together. Maybe next time I will not add the capers, bc they don't go very well with the other ingredients.

I first ate Picadillo at a Mexican restaurant in San Antonio, Texas. This recipe is quite similar. I served it on Tortillas, along with Mexican rice and Guacamole.

Not bad. It has good flavor, but a bit on the sweet side. I don't think I'll make it again, but if I did I'd cut the raisins down by at least half. And I think I'd leave out the nuts completely (they just seem odd to me). What I really want is something more like the picadillo in Austin Grill's picadillo tacos, and this just wasn't it. Oh well.

This was fantastic!  I did leave out the capers and olives but stuck to the rest of the recipe.  Will make this again and again..big hit in my home!

I made this for dinner last night.  Both my husband and I loved the blend of flavors.  He requested I add it to my rotation of menus.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch.

Who would have thought that beef, sausage, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon green olives, raisins and all of the other ingredients would have made such a delectable meal.  We had left overs so the second night I served the meat portion over fresh, organic salad and topped with ranch dressing.  It was awesome.  It is definitely a keeper.

Loved the combination of spices.  It smelled GREAT.  But we were disappointed in the taste.  I blame this, however, on the chorizo that I used.  I think the key here might be in using a really good sausage.  Mine was rather bland.  I will try it again using a different sausage.

I was cruising All Recipes for something different to do with hamburger.  Wow!  At first my family was skeptical as they looked at the contents of their bowl, one bite and we are all Picadillo lovers now.  Even made it for company only to find out that one of the guests was sensitive to spicy foods.  She ate it without any problems - or indigestion after wards. I don't always have all of the ingredients on hand, but it is a very forgiving recipe and always tastes delicious.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it was incredible!  I served it with canned black beans (mashed, with onions and garlic sauteed in olive oil) and fried plantains.  My husband I both ate until we couldn't eat another bite.  The spices in the picadillo, and the melding of flavors with the beans and plantains were just fantastic.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I was thrilled with the reaction I got when I made this.... all the guys raved and the one who never has seconds had seconds! I had to improvise since I didn't have capers or olives- I threw in a little homemade pesto I had on hand instead. I can't wait to try it the right way, though. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good and something different.  I did not ad tomatoes because I wanted to roll it in tortillas, and I didn't have almonds or raisins.  Next time I'll add them and see if there's a difference.  Very good!

This is so good!!  I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned and skipped the cayenne for those who don't like spicy food but it would have been great with it.  I also chopped the raisins and olives in the food processor to avoid huge bites of them.  I also used ground turkey and chicken broth instead of beef. Everyone loved it! It tastes even better the next day!

We eat little red meat, so I substituted ground turkey breast for the beef, and chicken stock for the beef stock.  I did not add chorizo either due to the high fat content.  But the spices and wonderful contrasting flavors made this a wonderful main course served over whole grain rice and accompanied by baked plantain slices.  I would use the same recipe for shredded chicken or beef.

I tried this and my wife thought i was screwing up the recipe but I followed all the instructions but left out the vinegar,raisins,capers, and almonds.  It still came out great.  The yield for servings was off though. Next time I will add more chorizo and ground beef.  Great dish..will try it again.

I have always considered Picadillo to be a Cuban dish something like this one but without all the spices.  I've seen the Cuban style made with beef, black beans and little green peas on top.  This recipe is way too spicey, its not necessary.  Picadillo is a simple dish that can be cooked in 20 minutes.    Picadillo is nothing like sloppy joe.

This was so good.  I really followed the recipe to a tee (which is so rare) except I had to sub lemon for lime and green pepper for red, but other than that it was just a great ground beef dish.  Will definitely make again.

We thought this was great! It almost had that "Cincinnati Chili" taste with being slightly sweet. My husband took the leftovers to work and even his coworkers liked it. I would make again.

Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious. I wasn't sure how it would turn out initially, but the flavors blend perfectly. Not too spicy or too sweet and very filling. Great over rice or a sweet cornbread.

Loved this meal! The chorizo adds a nice touch! I added 2 lbs of beef to make sure there were leftovers...and skipped the lime juice, raisins and almonds to match my families likes. A keeper for sure!

OMG! This is delicious. I made as written except for using only half of the chilies just to be safe on the heat factor. The sweetness of the raisins combined with the olives is amazing. I’ve tries other recipes - this is the best. I did make one change - I used a red bell pepper because I’m not crazy about green bells. We served it over rice. I ate the leftovers with warmed naan bread.

I've been making picadillo for a while but it never turned out like my local cuban restaurant until now. I modified the recipe a little bit based on what I know my husband and I like and dont like. It turned out amazing.

I only used the 1lb ground beef, 3/4 of the rest of ingredients, no lemon, no capers, no vinegar.  Delish!

Great tasting recipe. Forgot the capers and the chorizo. But it was still full of taste. Made a beef version and a ground turkey version. They were both excellent. Definitely a new favorite.

Very yummy! With the chorizo, I used a combination of fresh and dried, which I chopped and browned with the meat. The dried chorizo added a little more spice and texture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is. Served with some yellow rice and maduros. Will definitely make this again!

My family loved it. No leftovers. It is not as spicy as the versions I have had while eating out but it was very good. I tried to follow the recipe exactly.

I made this last night and it came out pretty good. I've also been told that came out really good. one thing though is that the recipe says nothing about lime juice and almonds in the ingredients. the recipe would work better I think for the amateur cook like myself if it's specified how much lime juice and how much almonds somewhere before the last step in how to make it.

Really good, I didn't make many changes except for having to use dried cherries instead of raisins (Walmart grocery screwed up my order :-/)
I did not cover the pan at all; I live in a humid area so the liquid would've never evaporated. Also, my husband hates peppers, onions, capers and olives, so I threw all of those ingredients into a food processor until they were the consistency of pulp, so he had no idea and actually loved it! Next time I will try it with just ground beef so my kids can eat it, as the chorizo made it slightly spicy.

I have never eaten picadillo in my life so I have nothing to compare it to however, this recipe was a hit in my home. I omitted the raisins and sugar because I knew my family would not like it. I also doubled the spices. My finicky family actually LOVED it! I'll undoubtedly be making it again.

The family loved it!  Perfect with white rice and a baguette for dipping in the sauce. I didn’t use chorizo, i used pine nuts and I left some olives whole for presentation.

My husband has been hungry for this since we had it at a small cafe in Orange, CA. This was an excellent recipe but we are not fans of cumin so I reduced the cumin to 1 tsp and added a dash of worcestershire sauce as well as a dash of maggi. I also let it cook without the lid so it intensified the flavors. WOW I certainly will make this a repeat.

Adapted slightly (cook it down until very dry) this also makes a great empanada filling. If you like spice, increase the cayenne by 4x, that's what I did and it was pleasantly hot, not overly spicy at all. I think the spice suggested in the original recipe is way too mild.

Yum!!  I subbed smoked turkey sausage for the chorizo, but it was still very good.  i think i will look for the chorizo next time and see if i like it better.  also, i thought it was just a little too much vinegar, will probably reduce next time.  But, still very tasty - much different flavors than we are used to in our house - fun!

Loved this and made a few omissions: the meat produced quite a big of liquid (not fat).  I kept that liquid and omitted the beef broth.  I also omitted the cayenne because I used smoked hot Spanish paprika which was plenty spicy.  I did take the advice of another cook and chopped up the olives, capers and raisins and omitted the almonds.  It was excellent and I am looking forward to making it again soon!

This recipe calls for 5 stars hands down! My husband wasn't a fan of the amount of cinnamon so I use 1/8 of a teaspoon. I also chop up the raisins, olives and capers before adding them. I add these ingredients when I add the diced tomatoes, beef broth and sugar before simmering. I also use a full package of ground chorizo (10 oz I think it is) and I omit the olive oil. I don't drain the grease of the meat, because the juice that comes out of the chorizo is way too flavorful! The flavor explodes in your mouth and you end up craving it all the time! I have made this recipe at least 5 times and will never try another picadillo recipe, because this one is perfect! I serve mine over jasmine rice.

Wonderful! I don't care for olives or capers so I leave those out. I also use half the amount of vinegar because I could smell slightly too much of for my liking (although it still tasted delicious) the first time I made it. It freezes very well.

Fantastic! I didn't change a thing. I put it on buns. It gets even better after a day or so, because the raisins soften and expand as they continue to soak up the moisture. My mom used to feed this to us, but her recipe wasn't as good as this one.

Liked this a lot.  Could have used a bit more heat but really tasty.  Followed the recipe exactly --- next time I'd use turkey + turkey chorizo or at least replace the beef with turkey.  It was pretty greasy and unnecessary to have that heavy of a meat with all the flavors going on.

I had no raisins, and don't use sugar. I only added worcestershire sauce and lots more garlic. Probably  added more spices, but it was pretty good.

I lived for several years in Florida where i had many cuban friends.  I learned about Picadillo from their families.  In my opinion, this is an awesome recipe!  Often i don't have the almonds on hand so i usually omit those.  Its just as good without them.  Honestly, i never had it with almonds anyway in the past.  Otherwise i follow the recipe and its GREAT!

We like Picadillo and like trying different versions of it.  Had to use Italian sausage since I didn't have chorizo on hand.  I am sure chorizo would have added more flavor to it but we did enjoy this.  Served it with  "Black Beans and Rice" from Allrecipes.  It was a nice dinner and enjoyed the leftovers for lunch.

Used this recipe for my first picadillo. We omitted the green olives and raisins, but added small cubed potatoes.  Next time I may also omit the capers and vinegar as it was a little too vinegary for our taste (even though it was still quite good).  Our friends saw my post on FaceBook and we had them come over. They really enjoyed it.

This was the best new dish I have tried in a while.  I forgot to add the vinegar but it was still delicious over some brown rice.  I am going to add some vinegar when I have leftovers and see how I like it.  I think it will be a nice addition.

It is such an interesting mix of flavors.

I'm having a Cuban-themed dinner party in a couple of weeks and tested this recipe tonight to see if I wanted to use it. Wow! It is really delicious. I didn't change anything other than not adding the lime juice, and that's only because I forgot to buy it. It was so good without it but I know it will give it that extra special something. This is a simple dish to make and tastes fantastic! Tastes very similar to the picadillo my favorite Cuban restaurant in Key West makes! Definitely try this one, you won't be sorry.

This is one of my new favorite meals!  I served it over rice.  I didn't have any green peppers but it still tasted amazing!  My husband is a picky eater so I thought he might not like the idea of raisins and olives in this dish (he doesn't really like either one), but to my amazement he really liked this dish.  I served fried plaintains on the side.  This is a keeper!

Nice recipe, but next time might leave out the sugar. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the tomatoes, but I didn't.  Took some of the broth out & added cornstarch to thicken a little, served on Jasmine rice with tossed salad, Tostones & Cuban bread.  It was good, but not excellent...leaving out the sugar might help.

Possibly one of the most amazing things that you will ever eat. It is spicy, sweet, complex, and not hard to prepare at all. When you add the dry spices, and they release their fragrance, your mouth instantly starts watering. You have to make this!

This was a real winner in my house! I served it over tortilla bread. Stuck to the recipe except I did not add the cider vinegar. This will be made it my house often. Very yummy!

Excellent! Made it according to written recipe (although did it in two days, browned the meat last night and held that mixture out until I had sauteed the onions and peppers). It is colorful, flavorful, and delicious! Spices appear to be just perfect. I didn't think I would like the capers and olives but chopped them up and they added to the overall flavor just fine. Probably added the salt that is not in the recipe. I served the dish in a bowl with a warmed piece of flat bread on the side to "dip" in it. My husband loved the dish and I would definitely make it again.

My family loved this recipe, including my toddler.  I made a big batch, so we ate it as leftovers several times.  It was great served with simple cornbread, and in wraps.  I think I'll drain it a little better next time as the chorizo is pretty greasy.  I did leave out the olives and cumin because of our tastes.  Overall the taste is amazing, with lots of variety of flavor in each bite!

Pretty good.  Made some changes as per our taste.  Will make again.  Left out the cinnamon, sugar and raisins and capers.  Used a bit more olives and white vinegar.  Would consider leaving out the almonds next time.  Easy and something different to make.

Made this last night, it was wonderful.  It needs the lime juice, don't omit, could even increase a bit.  Left out the raisins and almonds for last night's meal,,,got brave for leftovers today at lunch and added in,,,,again wonderful, wasn't at all like I thought it would be.  They added just a hint of sweetness and texture.  Don't be chicken like me,,,use the recipe as written!

I took a chance on this and I was very very pleased with this recipe. I bragged about it and even gave the home ec teacher a copy. This has a somewhat unusual combination of ingredients, and I was a bit a  unsure at first, but we loved  it and I will definitely make it again and again.

This was a fantastic recipe! I couldn't imagine all the different ingredients together in this recipe but they were perfect together. We are vegetarians so I left out the chorizo and substituted Morningstar crumbles for the hamburger and used veggie broth.  We served the Picadillo over toasted naan and without the meat this was a very low fat, flavorful meal.

I made almost exactly. The only thing I didn't have was almonds. Seriously fantastic combination of flavors. I have been looking for years for a similar recipe to one I made in a cooking class that has disappeared. This is the closest I've come. Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved it, and was surprised at how well everything went together, especially the raisins and olives. 

I used ground turkey because that's what I had, and it still turned out great.

Always looking for something to do with ground beef that involves multiple veggies.  This was really good; the combination of spices was very pleasant without adding tons of heat.  I could not find chorizo, so I subbed Italian sausage, but I didn't think the Italian sausage blended in well with the other ingredients.  Next time I'll skip the sausage altogether.

Wow this was a great recipe! My husband had the brilliant idea to make it with lamb (1 lb. locally raised ground lamb) and it was fantastic; the recipe has so many strong flavors and the lamb was the perfect balance to them.  He used fresh tomatoes, left out the chorizo and the almonds, and used lemon for lime juice.  Will make this for dinner guests as soon as I can get more local lamb.

This was so good.  I didn't have the chorizo sausage but except for that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit with my family.  It only needed some salt.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe mostly for my husband. He is from Puerto Rico and I had heard him mention this dish. Reading the ingredients it did not appeal to me at all. Surprisingly though I really liked it. I made it exactly as written. Every bite was a surprise. Sometimes it was sweet, other times spicy, or crunchy. My husband preferred it without the slivered almonds but I liked the crunchiness it added. I might be a little more bold with the cayenne pepper next time. I thought the raisins would not be good but they really added to the dish. We served our picadillo next to a bed of rice with sweet plantains on the side. Yum!!

I felt inspired (and envious! :p) of my co-worker's tales of vacationing in Cuba for 3 weeks and made this dish this weekend. It tasted amazing and "homey" with the sausage, spices and the crunch of the almonds. Tasted great over rotini pasta the first day, but even better over hearty whole wheat noodles the next day for lunch! I give it only four stars because, while it was good, it was not outstanding. Will make again for a comforting meal. Thanks for sharing!

This was simply delicious!  I served it over jasmine rice.  Very easy to make.
