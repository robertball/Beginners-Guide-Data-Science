My mom said it best.  "If Dad went for seconds...it has to be good!"  I served this as an alternative to a traditional noodle kugel for Kol Nidre dinner.  The cranberries were a nice complement to the fall holiday table.  

It was very easy to prepare.  I didn't have a pan larger than 9x13, so I cooked it in a 8x11 and placed in a 9x13 dish for the bath.  

I already plan to make it for Thanksgiving and I've been asked to forward the recipe to my mom who plans to serve it for an up-coming dinner party.  This will definitely become a part of my cooking repitoire.  Enjoy!!

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving.  It was really delicious and I will certainly make it again.

I made this for Shabbat dinner without the cranberries and substituted fresh white corn for the canned white corn, and soy milk for the creamer.  Baked it until it was set, approximately 1 hour.  While I liked it well enough it was a little more "custard-like" than I would have preferred.  My family/guests didn't care for the taste or texture, saying it was too mushy for their preferences. Everyone thought the dish smelled fantastic! I think if I try this again I would cut way back on the milk/creamer to obtain a more "cake-like" texture.

We absolutely love this.  It's going to become a staple at our Shabbat dinners!  The cranberries add a nice touch for the fall.

This was very good, would definitely make it again if I was in the mood.  The cranberries added a lot in terms of color and flavor, I would maybe add more next time.  It is a very thin kugel, but I am afraid that it would be too custardy if I baked in a smaller dish.  It was excellent as is, although I did keep it warm for about 1.5 hrs in a 225 degree oven after it was baked, so that might have helped it firm up a little more.

This was really good.  I made it for my family on Passover, and everyone loved it!  I've gotten several requests for it since.

This is not what I had in mind when I read 'kugel'... This mushy mess cooked a lot longer than an hour - mostly because I was worried that it wasn't done; it was very watery. I didn't serve warm because I was afraid the whole thing would fall apart. The flavor was okay and my guests ate it - to my great surprise - but I thought it was just kind of a waste of craisins.

I made this for a Chanukah celebration and it received rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. It was super easy to make and perfect to take to a potluck. You might want to make it a double batch as one will not be enough!

Absolutely wonderful!  Although I fully intended to add the cranberries, I forgot to do so.  I did not have any non-dairy creamer so used 1% milk.  I also did not add any salt since salt was already in the canned corns.  Next time I hope to make the recipe "as is!"

This recipe is the worst. It tastes way too much like flour. It was s bad that I threw it out after dinner. Will not make it again.
