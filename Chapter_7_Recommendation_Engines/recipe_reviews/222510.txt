This was my daughter's choice.  She had her first one in Mexico on her honeymoon.  We followed the recipe, using Sauza Blue Agave tequila and she pronounced it perfect.  I found the combination of orange juice and grenadine too sweet, but then, I didn't have to finish it ,she did and very happily.

Super easy and very yummy!  If you use cold OJ there's you can skip the straining the juice and tequila with the ice cubes. It will be cold enough over the ice.

Stumbles far too much on his presentation and the finished product is lackluster at best. A T.Sunrise should look and taste like passion in a glass because it embodies its namesake.  I give him 2 stars because he continued on even through his mistakes so he has gumption, but he needs a lot more practice with his hand work.
