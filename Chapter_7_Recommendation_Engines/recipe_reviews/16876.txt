I almost didn't make this recipe because of the last review that it had gotten by being too sweet, but it is absolutely delicious, so easy, and far from being too sweet!  My family couldn't get enough of it- I have 4 teenagers at home and they can be very picky.  I did the Cherry Version.  Maybe the ingredients make the difference.  I used Betty Crocker's SuperMoist White Cake Mix, Comstock Cherry Pie Filling, Unsalted Butter, and Pecans instead of Walnuts.  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!!  Thank you, dear lady, for posting this recipe.

This is my absolute favorite dessert recipe.  I have made it many, many, many  times always with rave reviews.  It is so easy and so delicious -- warm or cold.  I do not like real sweet or fat filled desserts.  I use 2 Jiffy cake mixes with 4 1/2 Tablespoons of butter instead of 1/2 cup as called for in the recipe.  I usually make  it with berries that I canned or froze.  I add only as much sugar as I like in my desserts.  When I use canned pie filling, I always buy the light ones that are not as sweet.  I usually add a few more nuts that called for in the recipe.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I think that the cake mix made entirely it too sweet.

I'd been looking for a one crust blueberry or cherry pie and this recipe looked perfect.  I made this but in a unbaked 9" pie crust and used half of the butter and cake mix (I skipped the pecans).  I covered the crust with tinfoil and baked it about 10 min. longer than the original recipe called for.  I saved the rest of the cake mix to top off a cherry pie I'm going to make like this.  Very easy and a big hit.

Got Rave Reviews!  Out of necessity I had to make a couple of changes... I didn't have any blueberry pie filling so I used cherry.  1 can didn't seem like enough so I used 2.  I had to use 1/2 a cup of whatever nuts I had lying around including sunflower, peanut and pecan mix!  Didn't quite have enough butter so I substituted a couple of Tbsp worth of butter-flavored shortening to make up the difference.  I LOVE RECIPES THAT ARE FORGIVING!  This still turned out great.

So easy, you can do this with any combination of cake mix and fruit pie filling. Chocolate cake with cherry pie filling (no nuts) has become a cherished favorite in my circle of friends - and they can't believe how easy it is!

To me this serves the same purpose as those novelty fruit pies in the Hostess section served as a kid -- over-sweet and over-rich, but once in awhile seemed like a good idea.  The flavors tasted very artificial to me and is just about nutritionally bankrupt, but cures a sweet tooth right quick.  My son liked the buttery topping.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!  I made this as a last minute dish for a family dinner.  Since then I have made this numoerous times for my family and each time they rave about it!  I have used apple pie filling as well as cherry filling.  I also used two boxes of the cake mix and two cans of pie filling.  Lovely!!!

This is really good!  Yes, sweet, but aren't desserts supposed to be sweet?

I made mine with a can of apple pie filling and a small handful of fresh blueberries thrown in (it's what I had).  I added a teaspoon or so of cinnamon to the cake mix and omitted the lemon juice.  And I used walnuts instead of pecans.

Nummy

i had some fresh blueberries to use up, so I tried this recipe. It turned out fabulous. I didn't think it was too sweet. I added 1/2 cup splenda, 1tbls. tapioca and 1tbls. lemon juice the the bluberries. I didn't have a white cake mix, so I used the the new sugar free yellow cake mix. Very easy and will make again.

This is an old favorite of mine. I always use fresh blueberries which cuts the artifical flavor and also makes it not as sweet.

I used frozen berries and 16 oz of 7-up with the cake mix.  Just the right amount of sweet and tart.

I am a trained chef and I cooked this for over an hour and the middle did not cook.  In fact the middle did not even begin to cook.  Perhaps this recipe is formulated for fresh blueberries, if that is the case the writer should not have put in fresh or frozen blueberries.

Man, this stuff is sooooo good when you are craving something really sweet and totally unhealty. Kids love it because it tastes totally artificial.  Balance it with a good helping on ice-cream!

This is just so good and easy to make! Yes it's sweet...it's a dessert so I'd be upset if it weren't. The important thing is it tastes great and it's easy to throw together at the last minute!

What a great easy recipe! I remember my mom making this but she called it Dump Cake. I substituted cherry pie filling and used sliced almonds. I accidentally bought a 30oz can of pie filling, but I think it ended up being just the right amount.

Very good, although I changed it a fair amount to fit with what I had in mind.  I used 6 cups fresh blueberries (YUM!) and made them into pie filling by following the measurements on the back of the tapioca box and then cooking them on the stove for about 10 minutes.  Instead of white cake mix for the topping, I used a Krusteaz Crumb Cake mix (I combined the 2 packets then put butter in)--more of a cinnamony, deep flavor.  It was really yummy, although next time I will probably put in a cup or so of oats so it will be more "crumbly" (this time it was just dough that I had to break into little pieces on top of the blueberries.  Or maybe I'll cut in the butter instead of melting).  All in all, it was WONDERFUL, especially with vanilla ice cream.  My husband went straight for the leftovers when he got home from work!!!

BTW, this recipe reminds me strongly of a recipe my mom used to make called "Dump Cake".

I have tried this with cherry pie filling and it is wonderful.  Also a unique variation is to top it with vanilla ice cream and drizzle with a little warm chocolate sauce.  Your guests will love it.

I did not use the lemon juice.  I will use 2 cans of pie filling the next time I make it..  It's very good and super easy to make.  I will definitely be making this again.

didn't think 1 can of blueberry pie filling is enough as its spread pretty thin across a 9x13 pan. The "batter" doesn't really get crumbly, especially if you add melted butter. I would try slightly softened butter and cut it into the cake/nut mix to make more of a crumblely topping. Added prespiced pecans I use for baklava (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove).. really helped bring some more flavor to the cake mix.
