My husband said this was just like his Mom used to make. I did add 1/4 t each of cinnamon and vanilla, as one other reviewer suggested. This pie is SO easy and tasty. Also, it works just as well with frozen chunks of rhubarb as it does with fresh, you just have to bake it longer and protect the crust from over-browning.

Wow, this was a hit the first time I made it! One guest said this can't be duplicated, and I'm afraid too that if I make it again it won't come out that good. But it should! Fingers crossed! I beat the eggs and sugar first, then I added the melted butter and flour. It was a little thick to be poured, so I added about 3 Tbs milk and poured it on top of the rhubarb. Perfect!! I'll make it again with no changes, it can't be better than this! Thank you for this awesome recipe!

2 things didn't work well. I made two identical pies using same batch of rhubarb. We baked the pies as directed and found the rhubarb to be tough n stringy.  I baked the other pie about 30 minutes more and that made a big difference. I think I had the oven on 275 so the edges of the crust wouldn't burn. The second thing I decided is that I don't like pies that use flour as a binder. I wouldn't use this recipe again.
