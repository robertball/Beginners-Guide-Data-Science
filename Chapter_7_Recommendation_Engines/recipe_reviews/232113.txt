Seems so simple but very good.  I dumped a bunch of water out the bottom but then worried it would be too dry... just dolloped some sour cream on top = perfect!  Next time I will cut squash smaller so easier to mix the layers.  Thanks for the recipe!  (Oh, needed to use up some pinto beans and was able to put in 3 1/2 cups!)

This is my third time to make this, and we love it! I'm vegan, my husband and son are not, so I separate this into two casserole dishes, one with cheese and one without. I top mine with diced avocado, and I'm convinced that mine is every bit as good as the one with cheese. Mmmm. I did find that the squash was a little undercooked the first go round, so I started putting just the squash in the casserole dish, covering it with foil, and baking it for 15 minutes before adding the other ingredients.

I love the flavors of this recipe, but I think it might need something to make it less watery.  I worried about the texture when I put it in and it came out with a lot of liquid.  I think next time I'll add some crackers to the mixture as well as sprinkling them on top.  Really the only things I change was I used 2 yellow squash and 2 zucchini and I tossed in the squash/zucchini with the other vegetables to cook just a touch (not all the way through.)  When I realized it wasn't as thick as I hoped, I put it on top of some refried beans and it was great!  I think I might strain out some water and use this as either taco salad topper or layer this with some tortillas for a Southwest casserole.  The flavor is EXCELLENT - just gonna play with it to get the texture I want.

I used acorn squash and went easy on spice in order to accommodate my family and it tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again. I also did not sauté everything as long as the recipe suggested. Instead, I threw it in the oven while peppers were still crispy and then baked until tender.

I used butternut squash instead of summer squash (pictured above) since that's what I had in the house and it worked really well. The sweetness of the squash with the spices was a great combination.

This is delicious. It made a lot more than an 8 x 8 casserole dish could hold so I used my cast-iron skillet and it was perfect. Next time I will add a lot more spinach because one cup kind of disappeared. And I of course added a lot more garlic because…it’s garlic! And more cheese because I come from a family of over-cheesers. It’s a spicy dish so approach spices with caution if your family members faint easily.

I've made this several times, now. Found I liked layering thickly sliced mushrooms (or Portobellos), cheese  and peppers like a lasagna.  Good flavor and texture, and even good visual appeal out of the oven!  This has become a regular menu addition in my house!

Loved it! I think the recipe means 4 small squash or 4 cups? But I used two large and upgraded to a 9x13. I like that you can change the recipe to how hot or mild you would like and the other half who always has meat with his meals actually liked it! (The black beans help that scenario) I will be making this again and sharing the recipe with family members!

I made this recipe to the T except I got a little confused about the crackers.  I put the cheese on then put the crackers on.  My husband and I both liked it very much.  We did add a bit of sour cream on the final product.  I will make this again in the future, but I might try the other topping another reviewer suggested made from cheez  crackers.  It sounded interesting, and the crackers while good were somewhat dull.  I think adding butter crackers would even be better. Great as is, but I might fool around it it next time around.

Turned out great. The first time we made it, there was too much juice and not enough beans so the second time we drained the diced tomatoes and added a second can of beans. We also left out the cayenne and added chilies separate from the tomatoes to control the spice a bit more easily. We have some food allergies so I substituted gluten free bread crumbs for the crackers and vegan shreds for the cheese. Will definitely make it again!

I hate to rate and change the recipe, but I'm going to anyway. I made this with butternut squash instead of zucchini and summer squash.  I also cooked and shredded two organic chicken breasts as I am a carnivore.  I used cheese but wouldn't have missed it if I hadn't.  I omitted the saltines, too.  Very tasty and healthy.

Fantastic recipe.  Makes a great main dish or a side dish, as is.  Or, serve with tortilla chips as an appetizer.   Also great over rice or in a flour tortilla (with or without the rice).  

It is very forgiving with respect to personal preference or available ingredients.    Don't have Rotel?  Just add a bit more salsa.  Don't like mushrooms?  Leave 'em out.  Only have half an onion?  So what?    Odds are, it will be delicious unless you just totally mangle it.  

The concerns about excess moisture are valid.  I mix in some Wondra flour to thicken things up a bit. Otherwise, just minor tweaks to suit my preference that day.   Oh, and I add chicken on occasion, particularly if I don't have enough squash or am feeling a bit carnivorous. 

Great stuff.

I had a box of cheddar rice crackers in the pantry which I used instead of saltines and cheddar cheese.  I layered half the squash, half the tomato sauce, with half the crackers  to help with the watery factor many squash casseroles can have, repeated layer and baked according to directions.  Very tasty way to use up all those great garden veggies.

This was a huge hit with family and friends.  I omitted the mushrooms and substituted crushed Cheez-its, crushed French fried onions, and Italian bread crumbs for the crackers.  This was mentioned in a comment so thought I would try it.  I also used a combination of yellow summer squash and zucchini and I upped the amount of salsa and added a can of corn.  I made this twice and once I added chicken.  I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil.  EVOO doesn't have a high smoke point so is not good for cooking but coconut oil does and is very good for you. I also didn't put cheese on top just mixed into the casserole.  I added more of the cracker mix at the bottom than called for to soak up so liquid. I came out perfect and very Delicious.

Delicious flavor and great way to use bountiful zucchini.  We added diced, cooked chicken breasts and it barely fit into a 9x13 pan.  Instead of crushed crackers, we had leftover topping/breading from the "Amazing Crusted Chicken" recipe on this site.  The topping from that recipe is crushed Cheez-its, crushed French fried onions, and Italian bread crumbs.  Best. Substitution. Ever.  We also added an additional 1/2 cup of this breading to the bottom of the dish to assist with the moisture that other reviewers commented on.  Our dish was not runny at all.  Will make again!

We loved it! I made a couple of minor adjustments - more mushrooms, more garlic and a little more spinach - because we love those ingredients. Plus I did not have any saltines so I crumbled some hint of lime tortilla chips. It was fantastic. As some other reviewers mentioned, the casserole was a bit juicy, next time I think I will as some rice to absorb the liquid and add some substance to the dish. I especially love this recipe because my Vegan son and my fussy husband both liked it. I will be making this again and again.

I thought this would be 'pretty good' but it was excellent! The only thing I did different was start it with some bacon I had to use up.  It is a great and delicious way to use your squash. Have a fork handy when serving it off your spatula so it holds up nice.  Looking forward to our leftovers tonight.

We just had it for dinner last night using summer squash from the garden.  It came out fantastic and we will definitely make it again. It actually made so much that we had to use a 9 x 11 size pan to fit it all.  Makes great leftovers, too.

I'm not quite sure why I didn't love this since all the ingredients are some of my favorite things. Only things I did differently was to use Adobo seasoning in place of the S & P and I used Ritz garlic butter crackers. Maybe garden fresh squash doesn't lend itself to these flavors. Next time I will ditch the squash, add another can of beans and top it with corn or nacho chips.

Surprising. I was not expecting it to have so much flavor and it is filling. I read the other reviews and worried about it being too watery so I drained the liquid from the Rotel and I didn't add the salsa. I used Ritz crackers because that is all I had on hand and I also used red onion,I am glad I did. For me this filled a 9 x 13 pyrex dish not an 8 x 8. It is a bit spicy so my little guys didn't like it but I thought it was fantastic.

I used this recipe as a guide and it turned out tasting great. Thanks for the inspiration! I'm not vegetarian; I just had a squash lying around that I didn't know how to use. This was tasty and pretty filling.

The ingredients I used were largely the same, except I left out mushrooms and added a red pepper for some extra kick. I didn't have beans handy, so I used a powdered mix. Long story short: good flavor combo. I'm happy with the results.
