I was surprised with the undesirable results of this receipe. This frosting turned out much like molasses. I couldn't possibly frost a cake with this syrup.

I made the mistake of making this even thought there was a poor review. I had the same results--a thin molasses. I do have some experience making caramel icing so I don't think it was me. Usually the recipes offered in Allrecipes are great.
