I love this basic recipe for summer. I prefer a prepared Italian dressing vs. dry, and add fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers and some rosemary from the garden to make it fresh. Make it once, feed an army!

Very, very bland. It had a pleasant taste, but certainly not one anyone will be craving. Turned out pretty, though.

I like snow peas, but they seemed too big for the rest of the pasta salad, but tastes good.  :)

I followed the recipe pretty well to the letter, except I added 1/3 cup vinegar to give the dressing a little zing. Everyone liked it. I'll likely make it again.
