A great dessert and so very easy to make!
The mango+honey+lime was a bit too sweet for my taste so i added some lemon juice, which gave it a wonderful sweet-tart taste.  This recipe can be used for many kinds of fruit.

Quick and easy, yes, but that's not worth producing a boring dessert.  The mango was so diluted with the whipped cream and egg whites that the flavor, not to mention the color, suffered. The amount of honey didn't seem generous enough so I sweetened the cream with 2 T. of sugar as I whipped it.  Even with that I wouldn't call the finished mousse  sweet and I can't imagine how even MORE boring and flat this would have been without the additional sweetener.  Further, I agree with another reviewer who remarked that the texture was "odd" - indeed it was, and I agree with her that it is because of the puree which still, of course, retains fibrous bits of mango. For a succinct way of describing this, this tastes like mildly mango flavored, non-smooth egg whites.  The rich, juicy, sweet mango would have been infinitely better on its own, or even topped with fresh whipped cream.  I don't necessarily have to have a rich, sweet, robustly flavored dessert, but this all but put my taste buds to sleep.

love this recipe! i've made it half a dozen times or so, and it always turns out great, and garners many compliments.  just thought i'd let everyone know...i sometimes use canned mango puree instead of mangoes, if they arent in season. it turns out fabulous that way, too.  oh yea, and i usually refrigerate it for around 3 hours before serving.

This recipe is very easy to make. I did make a few adjustments to it.  Instead of honey I used agave nectar and I also added vanilla & sugar to the whipping cream.  This entire recipe can be made in the blender as long as you do it in sections.  I blended the mango puree first, then added the whipping cream, and lastly I added the egg white.  This mousse is very tasty, but more mango would've made it a little better.

Light, sweet dessert that pairs nicely with a heavier meal.  I would recommend using the large mangoes, or double the amount called for if you only have smaller mangoes.  It's easy and fast.  I served it with a dark chocolate curl on top.  It was quite festive

I disagree with another reviewer who said this was boring, flat, lacked sweetness, and it was lacking in color.  If you need the color to be more  "mangoish," then just add some food coloring, it won't ruin the flavor. I've never had Cuban mango mousse before, and just maybe it's not supposed to be super sweet.  Just saying..............  I halved the recipe, and the only thing I did differently was add a little more lime juice, just because I had some extra.  If anything, I think the lime juice enhanced the mousse's flavor.  I thought the texture was fine, the flavor mellow, and wouldn't hesitate to make this again.  A nice, light ending to a summer meal!

This was amazing!!!! I made it for a party  and everyone enjoyed this light fluffy fruity treat. It was fast and easy. The only thing i would change is to buy egg whites and  not try to do it yourself. It took me forever to seperate and beat the egg whites. But still this was so good and i would recamend it to anyone. I will make this recipe over and over again.

I thought this was quite good. I found the reviews scolding for making a "flat" or bland dessert overly critical. This is a cuban style dessert, not an american style, so respecting their flavors is the way to go into this. I've made a similar dessert in the past and simply processed the mango thru a chinois or food mill to remove the fibers. Also, not all honeys are the same - most in US use the cheapy bear honey and that would not taste good in such a fine dessert. Cuban honey is unique with a light floral scent/taste. Agave sweetener may work, or Cuban honey imported from Canada, but I enjoyed the acacia honey from Italy best. This is a light dessert, creamy and slightly rich - not something that will pack a punch of flavor - but great after a spicy caribbean meal. I top it with a sliver of candied mango and a crunchy tuile cookie. Thank you for posting this recipe - it reminded me it's time to make it again!

This was nothing like a mousse. Would have tasted good like a frosting or topping, but not very good by itself.

This is such a great recipe that could go along with a chocolate mousse depending the meal and the time of the day.

I just made this and it is wonderful.  It is very easy to make and was quickly eaten by my children. I plan to make another full batch for my girl's night out crew, can't wait to see what they think about it!  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you.

Mouth watering with a gentle flavor the perfect combination for a kick dinner or lunch. (with a Chardonnay wine) I used this recipe on a menu I prepared for my last culinary class and it was a complete success.  This recipe will be use for further classes by my culinary teacher.   Regarding what to do after is done please use your imagination :)

I added a little lemon juice with the lime juice because it was too sweet. Tastes delicious. I had to make this for a Spanish 2 extra credit project. Going to make more because my dad wants to try some!

Made this without the egg whites since I wasn't sure who at my dinner party might have egg allergies. I also used canned mangos because fresh was not available to me.  It was a hit. It's light and  not too sweet.  I think the lime juice is the key ingredient. Very yummy.

This was very light and refreshing on a 96 degree day.  An after thought was to fold Champaign in just before serving  for an adult desert.
