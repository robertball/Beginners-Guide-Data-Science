5.14.16   Made exactly as written, wouldn’t change a thing, simply delicious!  It’s already in the 90’s in Florida, and I’m looking for new summer recipes that’ll keep me out of the kitchen in the evening--this one didn’t disappoint.  Made this early in the day and popped in the fridge.  Removed the pulp from a juicy, ripe tomato, stuffed it with the tuna salad, and served with crackers, sliced avocado and cantaloupe, a tasty light dinner.  So nice to see a tuna salad that doesn’t incorporate mayo, and that fresh dill adds incredible fresh flavor to the high protein tuna.  flamingo1012, thanks for sharing, this one’s a winner!

This might be the best salad with tuna I have ever had. I was a bit nervous about the amount of dill, but I like to make the recipe exactly as presented first before making any changes (I got a kick out of the woman who left a review but made it without the tuna--sort of like making beef stew without the beef). It was wonderful. Fresh, vibrant, colorful. The perfect summer lunch or light dinner. Right before serving, I chopped up some cherry tomatoes and sprinkled them on top. Yummilicious!

I was looking for a salad with artichokes and fresh spinach.  Admittedly, I did leave out the tuna and reduced the dill to 1 tablespoon of bottled dill since i was not sure how I would like the dill. I increased the chopped spinach to 2 cups. I also tried it with and without the chopped red pepper and I prefer the flavors with NO red pepper.  It was so easy to make and was a very good and nutritious  small salad. A nice change from the traditional salad.  I will make it again.

Very good and fancy when stuffed into a cored out tomato.  I think I'll try basil next time instead of dill.  The dill was good, I just think the basil will be better.  Easy, delicious and healthy.

Would give it ten stars if possible!  This is so quick and easy, takes no time at all, and presto!  A very light, flavorful lunch is served.  Two of us consumed it all in one sitting.  One chose to add a tortilla with it.
Usually don't have fresh dill on hand, but happened to have just enough for 1/8 cup and it was perfect!   Everything else was created as written, with the exception of adding  several sliced cherry tomatoes.  
This one is a definite winner and keeper.  Thank you very much flamingo1012!

Delicious.  I did add chopped onion and elbow noodles to "beef" it up so it worked as a main course.  Because of noodles I added extra oil, lemon, and seasonings. Tried with and without noodles and both were great.  Even my kids (5, 3, 18mo) ate it.

Started back on Weight Watchers and this was a wonderful dish with very little points that count. I will make a few adjustments the next time adding more flavors that we like at home.

i made it just like the recipe, except i didn't have fresh dill, so i used a T of dried.  Maybe my dill was bad or something, but i thought this was just weird.  Didn't feel like the flavors really blended at all.  Not horrible, just weird.

I am on a very restricted diet for an auto-immune, anti inflammatory diet and it has been hard to find any.  The only thing that had to be removed that did not fit in the diet was the red pepper.   It needed little salt, but otherwise it was great.  The dill added a fresh flavor to it.

This made a fantastic lunch! I was looking to change up my typical brown bag and this fit the bill. I made it by the recipe the first time and the second time omitted the garlic and dill only because I didn't have it on hand and it was just as flavorful.  Co-workers were jealous both days!

I thought this was a nice change of pace and very colorful, but a bit bland.  I added some sea alt and some green Tabasco sauce. I also used Tuna packed in oil, which is more flavorful than regular tuna.

This is a very good, light salad.  I left in the frig for the flavors to meld before putting on spinach.  I made it as written, but there are so many different things you could add.  Great for those on a restrictive diet, like myself.  I thought the dill weed would be overpowering, but it's wonderful.  Always taste better if using a fresh herb.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again.

Quick and good. I followed the directions - though it does not indicate tuna in water or in oil, I selected albacore in water and used artichokes in brine (rinsed them). I liked the results but wonder if the oiled versions would be better. This is a recipe that could be adapted to so many other items.

This was a big hit -- it is flavorful, easy, and perfect for a quick summer lunch or dinner.  The fresh dill is a wonderful addition.  I had a bit left over, as I'd doubled the amount made, and it was fantastic the next day, incorporated into a pasta salad.  This is a real keeper.

Very easy. Super low calories so I can double portion for lunch. I think 2 cloves of garlic is too much for this recipe. Somewhat overpowers freshness of other ingredients

Soooo good!! Fast and easy to prepare. I used only one can because it was only for me, so I eyeballed the amount of the other ingredients. Did not have dill. It came out delicious!!!!
