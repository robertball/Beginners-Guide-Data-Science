I've made this a couple of times and also tried using all honey, 3 packets of stevia, and walnuts instead of almonds. Prefer 1-1/2 cups of carob chips. This is a great cookie!

Instead of the sugar I used honey and so had to add extra flour to make up for the moisture the the honey adds.  I also used walnuts instead of almonds, though I imagine that most any nut would work depending on taste.  I also left out the coconut.  I would like them to be just a little sweeter next time, but overall a wonderful cookie.

I really didn't like these.  I love carob and molasses but these cookies did not live up to my expectation.  My boyfriend (who eats anything) didn't like them at all, so I know that it wasn't just me.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted honey for the sugar.  Maybe that was the problem?  They were kinda bitter at the same time being sickly sweet.  I also thought the 1/2 cup of butter overrides any potential health benefit.  I rarely rate anything bad, but I did not care for these.  Will not make again.

Yummy!! I made these all vegan by substituting veggie oil for the butter, and arrow root for the egg. I also used pre-made almond butter and all honey- no sugar. Soo good!

Great recipe, used a bit of natural peanut butter instead of the almonds, only used 1/2 butter and now oil.  Also used rice flour and oat flour instead of wheat flour.  Didn't use sugar just some agave nectar (1/4 cup.)  They turned out awesome!

Reviewed on Wednesday, May 20, 2009 by iLoveMaitreya  I've made these cookies a couple of times now, and really appreciate the tip for trying different nuts for the nut-butter portion. I tried using sucanat with this recipe instead of turbinado, and poured in a little honey for good measure. I thought it was interesting all the comments about using honey. If you're vegan, stick with the sucanat or turbinado. And 1Tb ground flax with 3Tb water will replace 1 egg. I think if you're not used to the unsweetened carob and over compensate with the honey it really won't be good. I couldn't rate this less then 4 stars!

My whole family loved these.  The only thing I did was sweeten it more to our taste (unforturnately, I did not keep track of this).  My husband commented that they tasted similar to brownies. Next time I will add half a cup of chopped nuts when I add the carob chips.  Great healthy cookies! Thank you!

I had to add 2 extra minutes to the time, and switched the chips for bittersweet but they were pretty good, they did crumble when I picked them up but they tasted awesome.

My only change was using Earth BalanceÂ®, instead of butter, due to dietary restrictions.  Nice little cookie and none of the flavours overpowered any of the others. Mine did take 12 minutes and I removed them before the tops looked dry. I couldn't get the almonds and oil to make a paste in my mini food processor so I used the emersion blender. Thanks for sharing.

Very good flavor but too crumbly. They didn't seem dry but just wouldn't stay together. The only thing I changed was the carob chips. I used 1/2 cup choc chips and 1/2 cup dried cherries.

I've made these but with carob chips instead of chocolate because I'm allergic to chocolate. But I'm wondering if it would be possible to make these with something other than wheat flour. Someone wants me to make them but they are allergic to wheat.

These are really great! pre-made cashew butter worked really well. These are not sweet, the way we like it. Thanks!

I used blackstrap molasses and it made a really nice molasses flavor - DH thought it overpowered the carob though. I didn't have coconut, so made without, and I used honey instead of sugar. Next time I think I'll add some vanilla, because every drop cookie should have it, and use all honey instead of sugar and molasses. I also used an estra egg, since we like more cakey cookies. 7 minutes was perfect bake time.
