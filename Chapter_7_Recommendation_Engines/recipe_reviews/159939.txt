I wish I could rate this higher, especially since it really was pretty good once I tinkered with it. Unfortunately, there are some problems with the recipe as I see it.  First, you'll need more of the ground almonds/Parmesan to coat your filets - I ran short. Second, medium-high is too high a temperature, especially since you're frying these in butter, which has a low burning temperature.  I used medium heat to fry the fish in a mixture of butter and olive oil. Third, after frying the fish on each side for 3 minutes, it was done!  I can't imagine cooking it another 5 minutes once you sprinkled it with more Parmesan, which leads me to four, MORE Parmesan cheese?  No - there's plenty in the mixture the filets were coated with.  And you sure don't want to cover it, which would only turn the coating soggy. So in a nutshell, fry the fish coated with a mix of Parmesan and ground almonds (the seasonings were fine) for a few minutes on each side on medium heat in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  Serve.

I've now made this a few times, I did add some lemon pepper to the dusting flour and use eggbeaters for the egg... this is perfect everytime, I've also used orange roughy with this also amazing. I do make a lot of the crust mixture and just put left over in the freezer for the next time. Oh, and I bake this instead of frying, I spray with pam and put in the oven at 425 or so and flip half way (time depending on how thick the fillets are) and spray again and put back in, perfect.

What a great recipe! I made this last night for my husband and he loved it! I did make just a few minor changes to this wonderful recipe! I did not add the lemon (I didn't have any on hand), and I added a salt-free garlic and herb mixture to the eggs instead of what the recipe called for. Once the tilapia was coated, I put it on a baking sheet, sprayed it with some cooking spray, and cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes. The coating was crispy and the fish was moist. Thanks for such a fabulous recipe!

I made this last night for my bf and a friend; and I think my bf told me at least a couple times throughout dinner how good it was, and then again later on in the night how much he liked it.  It is definitely better than the other tilapia recipe on the site (Broiled Parmesan Tilapia), although both are good.  The almonds with the tilapia and cheese were awesome.  I cooked basically according to the recipe... but also seasoned the flour rather than the egg wash.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and peas.  Also, the lemon garnish at the end should be included, it added that extra zest and accented all the flavors perfectly.

Tilapia is about the only fish I can get my family to eat, and up until now, our favorite recipe has been the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan on the AllRecipes site.  However, my husband thinks this tilapia is even better!  I used packaged Italian Parmesan flavored almonds and a freshly grated three-cheese blend.  I also substituted garlic salt for the garlic pepper since I have never seen the latter in my grocery store.  The previous reviewer mentioned that the almond mixture didn't go far enough, so I used 1-1/2 cups of almonds and 1-1/2 cups of cheese for five fillets.  (I have no idea how much each one weighed.)  It was barely enough!  I had to end up increasing the flour, too, and I should have used three eggs because my last fillet was barely moistened. The end result was wonderful, though.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I always double the Parmesan except this time I used Asiago and ground almond. I also baked it at 350-375 for 30 minutes. I coated the glass baking dish w/ Pam (olive oil). I added pads of butter around the fish and added fresh broccoli crowns. I sprinkled the top w/ the remaining almond and Asiago mixture and a couple more pads of butter. I also squeezed a fresh lemon over the top and covered with tin foil. I definitely will be baking this recipe rather than cooking in a pan in future. It was much easier and the fish came out perfectly!

I don't usually review recipes because I am usually very happy with the results but this one really gave me a hard time. The breading clumped together on the filets and there wasn't enough to coat all of them.  The breading fell off in the pan and stuck to it.  I used butter in stainless steel cookware on medium heat.  The tilapia ended up in pieces.  I really don't know what went wrong.  It was edible, just disappointing.

Very tasty recipe. I used olive oil instead of butter, and sub. Mrs. Dash for the lemon pepper and garlic pepper, and my whole family of picky eaters loved it!

Excellent recipe! Just made it last night and it was a complete hit. No doubt the butter helps to make the end flavor terrific. I could also see using this breading recipe for orange roughy or other mild fish. I only had three filets and ended up using most of the egg mixture and much of the breading mixture as well. If serving this for a large group I would advise increasing the egg mixture and making sure you have extra almonds and cheese for the actual breading. Also, while the butter definitely helps with the flavor I may try finding any alternative next time to cut the calories. (But boy was the buttery flavor good!)

I'm on the verge of giving this recipe 5 stars for the simple reason that it got my young daughter to eat fish!  She HATES fish and will not eat it.  But she ate almost half a fillet and would've eaten more if I had made more!  I'm simply amazed!  However, my husband didn't like this recipe as much as another tilapia recipe I make, so I have to give it 4 stars.  It is an excellent recipe, however, and definitely one to make occasionally when looking for a change from the norm.  Thanks for sharing!

My boyfriend loved this.  Usually he is pretty reserved in his judgements, but the first bite he took he said "Mmm this is good!" I didn't use as much cheese on top as it called for and I thought it was good but he sprinkled more on his.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I did do some things differently, which I HATE to do, but didn't realize I was missing a couple of ingredients until I started making the dish.  I didn't have lemon pepper or garlic pepper so I mixed the eggs with pepper, garlic powder, and fresh lemon juice.  I baked rather than fried and used only a small amount of butter and half the cheese.  Still amazing and on the healthier side!

This is our favorite tilapia recipe and my husband LOVES it!!  I use egg whites and bake it for 15-20 minutes at 425 degrees. You MUST bake it, so much better!! I have made this about 25 plus times. We eat this about every two weeks. Also, bake it on a cookie sheet with parchment paper and spray olive oil PAM on top of fishe before baking, no turning of fish needed.

I made this today, I only used 3 fillets so I adjusted the recipe by using 1 large egg, Mrs dash instead of lemon pepper since I was out and pepper. I also only used 1/4 cup of flour and almonds. I blended the almonds using the "dry blade"on my blender and used already shredded Parmesan cheese. First of all I think this recipe is great but it needs a few changes for my taste. I used regular butter which if you're not careful will burn. For this I recommend using clarified butter instead. Using this will allow you to fry up to 400 degrees. Another thing I would add is fresh lemon zest to the almond/cheese mix. It would definitely add depth flavor. Other than that I really enjoyed this quick and easy recipe. For those having problems with the fish cooking properly it could be a few things like your pan is way too hot. This can cause your fish to stick and burn. If you over cooked the fish it will fall apart and if your pan is too cold it would cause your fish to sweat a bit therefor your coat will fall apart. Another thing is that you need to handle your fish gently since it is somewhat delicate. I hope this is helpful to most. Thank you for the recipe!

Loved, loved, loved this!  I followed Naples suggestion and fried in a butter/olive oil mixture on medium heat, only 4 minutes per side, and it was perfect.  The kids complained, "we hate fish . . .why do you always make things we don't like" . . . but then cleaned their plates!  One for the "do again" list for sure!  Thanks!

Everyone in my family really liked this fish dish. I used less parmesan than called for and only 3 large tilapia fillets. Some of the crust did fall off while I was sauteeing them, but I think it was because I tried to turn them too soon. This would be good with some herbs added to the crust too - dill or tarragon would both be nice. Thanks!

I did modify this slightly, but mostly stuck to the original recipe.  Part of the modifications were due to what I had on hand.  I made this using whiting from a recent fishing trip.  I increased the almond/parmesan mixture by an extra half a cup for each.  I also added the garlic powder and pepper in there, along with dried parsley.  I chose to bake the fish on a half bakers sheet with a rack so I wouldn't have to turn them.  I just heaped the parmesan mixture on the filets prior to baking.  I baked them on 325 for 30 mins, and broiled them for the last two minutes (didn't move the sheet, had it on the middle rack) to brown the topping.  Very tender, perfectly cooked, and even my daughter who doesn't like fish asked for seconds.

This was so good! My husband and I both loved it! I did bake it in the oven instead of cooking it in a skillet, and I think that was a very good idea! :) Outside was tasty and crunchy and the inside was soft and moist. I also used bread crumbs instead of flour. If you like Tilapia, you HAVE to try this recipe! I will definitely be making it again.

Excellent! Very close to the Parmesan Tilapia fish that I had at Red Lobster lastnite! I added a few bread crumbs to the cheese mixture to assure a golden and crispy texture. Baked in buttered cast iron pan for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. No turning of the fish was necessary. Topped with buttered whole almond slices and grated parmesan cheese last few minutes of baking time. Check fish often to avoid overbrowning. Amazingly, the leftovers that I had the next day were even more flavorful. I microwaved two fillets on high for one and a half minutes...perfect! Wonderful, must try recipe for tilapia!

this almond/cheese crust turned out even better than I expected it to. Use the strongest cheese you can find as it gives it some ummph.  I improvised with the seasoning to suit our tastes...

This was so fast and easy to make. The few differences that I made were I seasoned both the egg and the flour with the lemon pepper and garlic powder (didn't have garlic pepper) and I ground some lemon zest into the butter in the pan. Also, I didn't use fresh Parmesan because I didn't have it. I used the shaker kind and it wouldn't melt but oh well, it was still really good.

This was the best fish fish recipe that I have ever made. I substituted oil for butter to make it healthier and it still came out very well.  I didn't have lemon pepper but I put in black pepper with fresh lemon juice instead.  I'm only 14 years old, but I prepared this dish very easily and quickly, so that shows how easy it is.  I would definitely make it again many times, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like fish much.

I enjoyed this very much, but husband and kids did not. I followed the recipe exc. didn't have lemon pepper/salt (used some garlic powder) and used flounder instead of tilapia. I enjoyed the crunchy, finely ground almond & fresh parm coating, but rest of family felt the topping was too overwhelming for the fish.The coating would also be good on chicken tenders.

Fantastic and absolutely restaurant quality! The extra cup of parm is unnecessary and you don't need to cook it as long as the recipe states, but these two issues didn't deter me from giving this five stars. We enjoyed it so much. I ground sliced almonds in my coffee grinder. I used half butter, half olive oil (as I usually do when pan-frying). I browned the tilapia on both sides and it was done. I skipped the extra 5 minutes cooking and extra cup of parm. A fresh squeeze of lemon and it's good to eat!

The extra parm was a bit much however the next day when I had it for lunch it didn't taste like too much so I will have to play with the amount a little but overall a great change. I ommitted the flour all together to make it gluten free

This was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great though I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for.

I used this recipe but instead of frying, I baked the fish for 30 minutes at 350 degrees at the suggestion of another reviewer.  The fish was a little overdone, next time I would cook it for a shorter time.  The flavor was perfect and the crunchy breading made the overcooked fish not matter.  Will be made again and again.

I used crushed pecans instead of almonds because that's what I had on hand. It was very good. I will definetly make this again.

Very good tilapia.   Bf approves!  I didn't fry it--he's trying to cut calories, and I wholeheartedly agree--so I just did as a few other reviewers did and sprayed with cooking spray, then baked.  I planned on baking for 20-30 min at 375, but I ended up starting the filets while I still had cupcakes in the oven at 350.  So, I put the tilapia in at 350 for 10 minutes, then jacked up the heat to 375 for another 15 minutes.  Worked perfectly.  Next time I think I'll toast the almonds to bring out the flavor, but otherwise it's great as is.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty!   The almonds and the parmesian cheese coating were a great combination.  I think next time I will try to bake it though as it seemed so rich with the butter and I did have to add more. I also had a problem with it sticking to my pan but it did not fall apart as one reviewer noted.  This would be a great dish to serve company.

O-M-G. . . that's all I can say!  I must have REALLY been in the mood for this dish because it was incredible.  My husband made it for me along with mashed-potatoes with wasabi and it was TO DIE FOR!!  He followed the recipe exactly, except for cutting the parmasan in half.

I just made this for my husband tonight. He loved it! I baked it in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes. I made a few changes. I used eggbeaters instead of real eggs. I used a real lemon instead of lemon pepper. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I made garlicky roasted asparagus to go with it.

Made this slightly different, using skim milk to dip the fish then into a parm, almond, lemon pepper, flour, garlic powder mix.  Pairs very nicely with mixed veggies and a small potato.

This was my first attempt at a 30 min meal.  I always think the longer it takes the better it will be but my husband and I love it.  He even helped me get everything together and chop the almonds.  It was delicous. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolute Outstanding! This is one of the few recipes that I've ever made where I would not change one thing. I do my Tilapia on the BBQ in a fish grilling rack and this produced the most wonderful crispy golden browned almond crust ever. Spray both side of the basket with Pam before placing the coated fillets in. I do most of my BBQ'ing on medium (MOM) so I left the fillets on for about 7 minutes total per side turning twice until the crust on each side was a golden brown.

The kidlets really liked this fish but was not too fond of the almond crust. I liked it with a squirt of lemon juice on top but it still lacked a wow factor.

Fantastic!  Make sure you grind the almond finely in a food processor.  We tried to grind them as one would for baking but it wasn't quite enough.  Also, we substituted fresh lemon juice and freshly ground black pepper for the lemon pepper seasoning.  Next time we will also use less cheese.  Great recipe.

This recipe wasn't bad, it just didn't WOW me like others have, like the Tilapia Parmesan on this site.  And, between cheese, almonds, and butter, if I am going to put that much fat and grease in my mouth, I would have expected more flavor out of it...

This was really good.  I am on a low carb diet for medical reasons and I was to the point where meat/fish of any kind was making me sick to even think about it.  The almonds, cheese and butter really perk up the fish so that it makes it enjoyable to eat.  I only used half the butter and added olive oil because I just couldn't get it to cook right without burning it.

AMAZING!!!  The only thing I did differently was used fresh lemon juice instead of the lemon pepper.  Mixed it with the egg.  I've never been a fish-eater, but I and my family loved this.  I even gobbled up the leftovers the next day!

Delicious! Smelled great, tasted even better. I substituted with sole and used olive oil instead of butter and the recipe came out fantastic. Very easy to make. I had some out-of-the-carton scalloped potatoes to side 

I had an almond theme going for the meal so I added the green beans almandine and followed with the bananas fosters II off of allrecipes.com

This recipe was excellent. My boyfriend does not eat fish nor nuts (especially NOT almonds) but he LOVES cheese. So, I sold him on that, but after one bite, he loved it -even ate the leftovers.
Not too strong of an almond flavor, the cheese seems to come out very well. I added more cheese than the recipe calls for, but it still didn't overpower the main dish. The almond gives a crusty texture adding crispness to the palate that you don't normally expect with fish. Lasts long in the refridgerator, stores well for leftover nite. Very happy with this recipe as it livened up a fish that I was sick of eating plain. Great recipe!

We loved this recipe, however, next time I'll use less butter and add EVOO. Also, the recipe doesn't need the flour for dusting or extra parmesan during the final five minutes of cooking.

This is really good. I didn't use dusting flour, just dipped the fish in eggs and then in the mix of almond flour, grated Parmesan, lemon and garlic peppers and dried parsley. I then placed on foil-lined baking sheet sprayed with olive oil and misted the tops with the spray also and baked in the oven for a healthier option. I flipped over halfway through, didn't use extra Parmesan on top as I didn't feel it needed it.  My kids loved it as much as we did. A definite keeper, thank you!

I followed the recipe, but instead of frying, I baked it for 10 minutes or so and it came out great! We even heated it up for leftovers the next day and it wasn't too dry. Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was frying the tilapia in evoo mixed with a little butter and I skipped the extra cheese at the end of the recipe.  This tasted fantastic.  Had a wonderful flavor with a great crunch from the almonds.  My family loved this, even my 12-year old daughter asked for seconds.  After we ate, my husband made sure to let me know I should make it again.  Some of the best tilapia we've ever had!

This turned out excellent!  I also made a few small changes to the recipe.  I added lemon and herb seasoning to the flour along with some fresh ground pepper, not to  the egg mix.  I also used toasted crushed almonds and fresh grated asiago cheese.  I baked the fish for about 20 mins btw 350 and 400 degress (I had to change the temp to add something else to the oven halfway through cooking).  The fish turned out delicious, however.

I loved it! I didn't have lemon pepper so I used ground black pepper plus some grated lemon peel and I didn't use the extra cheese on top. Other than these changes I followed the recipe to the dot. I'll definitely make it again. I'll also have to try the oven-bake version of it.

This was a good Tilapia recipe.  To make up a "garlic pepper", we used 1/2t garlic powder and 1/2t black pepper.  Baked in the oven (375, 30 min, per another reviewer) and it was a very easy, very tasty meal.  The ground almonds really add a different flavor than bread crumbs.

Very good. I'd give it 4.5 if I could (I save 5 for truly exceptional recipes). I baked it and it was perfect. Husband asked for it to go into the regular rotation. Next time I will fry it just to taste the difference but I thought baked was delicious.

These were very good but when i was pan frying mine the breading would not stick to the fish. It kept peeling off and sticking to the pan. I would say about half of the breading stuck to pan and the other half stayed on the fish. I'm not sure how to prevent this problem. I followed the directions in the recipe exactly. Despite this minor setback the fish had a wonderful flavor, which is suprising since Tilapia is a very mild fish. The breading tasted wonderful too, we just had to scrape some of it off the bottom of the pan and use it kind of like a garnish. I squeezed lots of frsh lemon juice over my fish and it tasted excellente!!

This is a great way to crust a light flavor fish.  I think this is going to become my new "everyday" crusting technique!  This time I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and added a pinch of red pepper flake into the egg wash.  Next time I don't think I'll add the extra Parmesan on top at the end.

First let me say that I HATE fish (except for shell fish).  Most of it makes me gag but hubby just had a bypass operation and I needed to cook healthy.  I scaled down the recipe for two people, didn't add as much Parmesan cheese (only because my hands were sore after grating some of it) and I added Mrs. Dash spices (regular and spicy).  I put it on a sheet of Release aluminum foil with a mixture of butter & olive oil and put it under the broiler rather than frying it.  This was incredible!  No fishy taste at all.  This is a keeper for this non fish eater.  Thanks for sharing.

i used to make this buttery, bread-crumby parmesan tilapia recipe on the back of the tilapia bags they sell at Aldi... but this is fabulous and so much healthier, esp. if you use olive oil instead of butter. my husband couldn't tell the difference.

I used the recipe for 4 servings for 3 fillets and was still a bit short, but other than that, this is a tasty way to cook tilapia. I doubled the peppers and baked instead of frying the fish.

This is an amazing recipe!  We omitted the flour for a low-carb option, and used our new cast-iron skillet..now newly seasoned.  We ran out of fresh parmesan, so we used fresh pecorino romano...very tasty!  My almost 3 yr old loved it.  I don't even have to tell you what my hubby thought of it.  :-)

I made this for a group of friends, some of whom watch what they eat. I switched the butter for olive oil and used less parm in the crust and none on top. Just the lemon and parsley made a light garnish. Served with brown rice. Healthy and delicious.

We loved this recipe! I've made a chicken version of this and I always run out of the almond mixture. For three filets of tilapia, I left all the measurements this same and I didn't run out. I also used egg whites and omitted the butter and used some olive oil instead. I also used garlic powder since I didnt have garlic pepper. I didn't have fresh parma cheese so used the grated topping for spaghetti and it was fine, since it's all I had. It was excellent on will become a regular dish for dinner.

Amazing!
Baked instead of fried. 425 for 20-30 minutes. I used a meat thermometer and made sure it was 150 degrees or higher.
Otherwise I didn't change anything!

Delicious and a definite keeper! I baked it in a foil covered baking dish and butter instead of frying it after I read some reviews that said it was a nice modification and it came out great! The whole house loved it!

We loved it!! Changed alittle to make it a bit healthier. Floured fish, dredged through egg mixture, and then patted the almond cheese mixture. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes as suggested by another reviewer

This came out great! The only changes I made were that I baked my fillets instead cooking them in a skillet and I did not use butter. I simply lined the pan with aluminum foil and applied a non-stick spray. I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe but I did not have enough almonds so I ended up using peanuts instead.  This came out really good and I can't wait to make it again for my wonderful girlfriend.

Tried this and, as a non-fish person, loved it.  It was full of flavor, not fishy and easy to cook.

I tried this recipe with two halved fillets, using naples34102's alterations (lower heat, fry in a mix of butter and olive oil, cut the time down to 3 minutes, don't cover or add more parm) and since I don't have lemon pepper or garlic pepper, I just used garlic powder and regular pepper, and used a little bit of lemon infused olive oil when frying. It came out pretty good, and I thought it was quite tasty. However, there was a problem with the excess breading coming off in the pan and burning, which coated my last two halves in burnt almond. I was able to pick the majority of it off, but I still wish it hadn't come off at all.

The breading was horrendous. It was incredibly clumpy, and wouldn't stick to the fish.

Everyone liked.  I baked at 425 for 25min. My tilapia was somewhat frozen when I started baking.  Check the temp and time before next time.

I forgot to use oil.  Remember for next time because it stuck to the foil and was difficult to remove.  Panic!

I loved the simplicity if this recipe, but made a few changes. I did not use almonds, but rather walnuts as it is what it had on hand. I omitted the flour to keep it gluten free. It was FANTASTIC!!

Very good!  I didn't dredge in flour just the egg with a little olive oil added (it helps the egg adhere to the fish).  Mine was a tad dry, I did it a little too long on each side but I loved the coating.  Will make this again.

Delicious! I used olive oil instead of butter, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The only issue was that the crust cooked faster than the tilapia so it burnt a little bit, but it still tasted amazing, and the tilapia cooked through. Definitely would recommend this recipe!

I was looking for something different for the Tilapia and came across this.  I did not have any almonds so I grabbed a Nature Valley Roasted Nut Crunch Almond bar and smashed it to little bits and it worked perfectly!   Great idea.

This recipe is awesome.  Easy to make and turns out great each time.  Tilapia is such a good tasting fish and the almonds and cheese make it even better.

Family loved it! We are gluten free, therefore I switched out the regular flour for coconut flour. Did not add garlic powder. Squeezed lemon on the fish after it was cooked. Fish was nice thick fresh wild caught Atlantic Cod. Cooked at 400 degrees for 25 min. Served with wilted spinach with lemon juice. Even my 2 year old grandson loved it.

Wow, this is 5 stars all the way! It was very easy to make, but did not taste like it! I made it slightly healthier by not frying it & using almond flour. first put lemon juice and lemon pepper on the fish before breading it in almond flour. Then I dredged it through the egg and the almond/parm mixture (which I grated finely in my food processor). Then I baked it in the oven at 375 on a dark cookie sheet for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through. With 5 minutes left, I sprinkled more parm on top. Thanks for the great recipe.

Good seasoning blend; it seems as though the garlic pepper called for should be garlic salt.  Fish may be sauteed or baked.  Either way, 10 minutes total for 1 inch for pacific whiting.

Wow this was good!!!  My entire family loved it--what more could you ask for!!! The only thing I will do next time is to season the fish with a little extra lemon and garlic pepper.  Otherwise great as is.  Will definitely be one of my go to recipes.

I didn't have any lemon pepper, so instead I used a garlic and herb seasoning that I have. I made the mistake of not measuring the seasoning and probably should have used more of it, because mine turned out a bit bland. Thankfully, though, a few splashes of lemon juice on top of the finished fillets really helped. The crust on this is amazing! I'm sure the crust would be good with pork chops or chicken fillets as well. I will make this again, but I will be sure to have (and measure) the lemon pepper. ;)  Would give 4 1/2 stars if I could.

This was by far the best tilapia recipe I've ever prepared!  I served it at a dinner club last night and everyone raved!  I chose to melt a very small amount of butter in a 9X13 pan and baked it in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes.  Divine!  Trying it with macadamias next time!

I love this recipe. Easy to prepare and the almonds add a nice nutty crust that compliment the talapia nicely. I didn't change a thing.  Most of my favorite recipes come from allrecipes.com; I always look here first.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My brother and I love this, but hubby thought it needed a bit more flavor so I was sure to season the fillets more (I normally use less seasoning than a recipe calls for) the second time and that did the trick. I like to pair this with steamed vegetables.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

A keeper! The changes I made: garlic powder instead of garlic pepper. I added a little lemon juice to the egg mixture. I also didn't put parm cheese on at the end of cooking b/c two cups of parm cheese just seemed like too much to use and it was delicious with just one cup mixed with almonds. I also used half butter and half olive oil for pan frying instead of just butter. Got lots of compliments. Will make again.

Delicious, perfect. My husband was very happy with it, along with myself and my 3-year-old. Because it is breaded, we didn't even need a starch. Just green beans as a side dish. Thanks-

Very good!  I use this with chicken sometimes.  I also bake as recommended by another reviewer.  I just place the fillets in a baking dish sprayed with oil; no 6 tbsp of butter is needed (at all).  It is better and healthier without.  I bake at 375 for maybe 30 minutes (depends on whether it is tilapia or chicken and the size of the meat).

Great flavor, but the breading stuck to the pan.  I made a batch of breading to use next week while I was at it so I'll see if there's a better way to cook it so that the toppings stay on.  Excellent flavor and easy to make.  My family devoured it.

This is the best tilapia I have ever made!  The flavor is amazing! The only thing I did different was that I used freshly grated romano cheese in place of the parmesan as that is what I had.  I am so thrilled to add this to my recipe box!

Wow! This is a fantastic & easy recipe...so much better than the Costco prebreaded tilapia!  My husband keeps asking me to make this all the time. I will definitely make this for dinner guests in the future. No changes needed for the recipe, it's perfect just the way it is.

This is the best fish recipe I've ever made. Everyone in my family loves it, including my father-in-law who ordinarily doesn't like fish, and my 4-year-old daughter. The only changes I made to the recipe was the seasoning: I used one tsp lemon herb seasoning, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp pepper since I don't have lemon or garlic pepper on hand. I also mix it with the dredging flour rather than the beaten egg. As another reviewer mentioned, cooking on medium at 3 min. per side was plenty of time, and you still get a crispy coating. I've used this recipe with tilapia, swai, and pollock, and it's been terrific every time. Delicious!

My Husband & I have tried a lot of different fish recipes lately-mostly from this wedsite. We both agreed this was THE BEST one we've tried. I don't like fish as much as he does and I think this is probably the best fish I've ever had-definately the best I've ever cooked. I didn't change the recipe at all. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! I can't wait to cook it again!!!!

This was just excellent!  There are enough positive comments for you to choose from - suffice to say that I made this dish in record time for me, and even if my husband likes something I'm still pretty critical.  Not this time!!  In terms of ease, time, flavor, as well as ingredients readily on hand, this was an excellent recipe.  Thanks!!!

Just wonderful! I only used 4 fillets but kept everything else the same. Next time I will try with veg oil instead to make it a bit healthy. I highly recommend this recipe I wish I tried it sooner!! Thx!

I thought this was very bland and way to dry. The almonds gave it a weird texture and if I were to ever make this again I would not cook it at med high...but I wont ever make this again. I wish  I had made the broiled Parmesan Tilapia instead.

This was delicious and easy!  I was having company when I made this, so I breaded my fish before and let them sit in the fridge until ready to use.  I did not have any lemon or garlic pepper, so I subbed in two teaspoons of lemon and herb seasoning, which complements fish very well.  I also used two frying pans for the 6 filets, so as not to crowd them and ensure a more even cooking.  This is a keeper.

This fish recipe is excellent. My wife says it's the best fish she's ever had. Very flavorful with the almonds, cheese and lemon all together. I burnt it a little the first time. Heat the butter up really hot, then reduce stovetop heat to medium when you place the fish in the pan.

Tilapia is a staple for my family. So I'm always looking for new recipes to try with it. I prepared this last night with a side of rice and vegetables and it was fantastic! I halved the recipe and did add a tiny bit of milk to the one egg, but other than that I made no changes.    On our gas stove, however, medium-high heat seemed to be a bit too high. I was afraid I had charred the poor fish but it turned out perfect! Overall this was fast, easy, and earns 5 stars from me! I will definitely be making this again.

tasty new way of cooking tilapia- but i had 2 problems:1) the almond/parm cheese mixture started sticking to the plate, and wouldnt adhere to fish and 2) lack of seasoning in end product. Would double seasoning next time, as some of fillets were large. I will try grinding the almonds Less next time to see if that helps with the sticking. I also added Paprika to the egg and seasing mix, which was tasty!

I really enjoyed this recipe! The crust was really tasty and went well with the white flaky fish! I had no problems with it sticking to the pan (I have t-fal pans) and did not add extra butter. I sprinkled an italian cheese blend on top, it worked really well! I might add extra pepper and spices next time but the almond/parm taste is good on itw own too...

Recipe is fantastic! My favorite way to eat Tilapia thus far. The butter burned a bit fast but this will be made time and time again in our house. My parents are my critics and they didn't say much with their mouths full until my dad went into the kitchen for thirds only to discover it had been devoured. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was and is a wonderful recipe. I actually made it twice.Once I ran out of almonds and used pecans. The pecans made it even tastier, if that is possible!! Thanks for a great recipe....

Great recipe, since I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand. I decided to bake my dish, like a few other reviewers. Next time, I broil the fish and use only 1/2 cup parmesan and 1/2 breadcrumbs. Believe it or not, it was just too "parmesan-y" for me.

Made this tonight - it was delicious & easy.  The whole family loved it (including my 8 yr old).  I substituted Mrs Dash for the Garlic pepper, Olive Oil for the Butter & Pecans for the Almonds.  YUM!

Great recipe. I'm not the most talented chef but I was able to pull it off pretty easily.  I went pretty aggressive with the lemon juice as I didn't have any lemon pepper and it turned out just fine.  As to the person who threw a fit about the breading "falling apart", that's more of a matter of technique with the spatula, not the recipe!

Very yummy - instead of lemon pepper I just squirted some lemon juice in the eggs, and I squirted some more juice in the pan before I put the cover on for the last 5 minutes. Some lemon wedges would definitely be great for this dish - the almonds gave the fish a great crunchy flavor

Wasn't too thrilled with this-the almonds gave it a weird, yet bland taste.  Made exactly as called for, but family didn't care for it-ate the fish, not the coating.  Broiled parmesan was better liked by the kids, sorry!  Wouldn't make this again.

This recipe was good. To cut down on cholesterol I used eggbeaters. I felt that 1 cup of parm was enough so I did not use the second. I baked in 375 degree oven for 30 minutes per another review. Next time I will probably cut the parm to 1/2 cup and add more almonds or maybe whole wheat bread crumbs.

This is a great recipe.  Very easy to execute also.  We loved the thick crust it got.  I may use less almonds next time though because my husband thought it a little too nutty.  Other than that, the recipe as written is great!

I'm just starting to cook so I'm a bit shaky in the kitchen, but I made this last night and it was FANTASTIC! My BF raved that this was the best fish he's ever had and could not stop talking about it...I added a little lemon juice and garlic salt to mine and it was a hit. It was so simple to make...even I couldn't mess it up! I will be making this again!

My whole family loved this, even my two finnicky daughters who wouldn't eat fish if you paid them!  The only changes I made were to use garlic salt instead of garlic pepper and to add a small dash of fresh lemon juice to the egg wash.  It turned out great and is definitely a keeper!

This was very good (and would have been better had I not cooked four fillets at the same time!) The coating could have used a little more flavor--next time I think I'll add some salt and maybe some garlic to the coating itself. The only problem with this recipe was the number of dishes it dirtied--otherwise it would be a five-star recipe.

Very good.  Probably because of all the butter and fattening ingredients.  But its definately a keeper.  Be careful about adding too much salt.  I salted mine while it was cooking and it tended to be just a little too salty.

Oh Wow! We are not big fish fans, so believe me when I say this recipe is great! It will be in our regular rotation. The only thing I will change in the future is to season the flour instead of the eggs.

Thought this was good.  I halved the butter and used butter flavored cooking spray in a non stick pan.  It was great.  BF like it too.  I think it would also be good with pecans.

Absolutely delicious!! I never know what to do with fish since it's not all that filling. The almonds gave the fish a more hearty texture. Very filling, and very healthy too! I'll definitely be making this again soon!

I had to make a meal with what I had on hand and this recipe fit the bill. It ended up being a much fancier meal than I deserved for no planning! Fairly easy to make and very tasty;  I made the recipe as written except without lemons because that was the one item I didn't have. I just squirted some lemon juice over the finished product.

I roasted the almonds and crushed them, I used lemon juice and pepper and a some garlic bulbs and substituted the parmesan for American cheese. My kids loved it so much they wanted more. That's a lot to say since they don't like fish. I'm going to make it again tonight but with all the ingredients on the list. It has an excellent taste. It's definitely one of those recipes you want to do over and over again because it's so good! Thank you for sharing.

We loved it. My daughter has Celiac so we tweak recipes to be gluten free. We used Almond flour and it added an additional nutty taste.

For the amount of work and mess involved plus number of dishes to dirty  it is not super yummy  for all this effort. You need a pan big enough for dredging unless you have a flour shaker. You need a pan big enough to dip the fish in the egg mixture and a similar sized pan for the almond/cheese mixture. To coat the fish. After flipping fish over  the first time some of the coating came off. Then by the time fish was done the coating was really dark brown. If this could be baked it might look better in the presentation.

I made it according to the recipe and served it with Mango Salsa, from the Grilled Tilapia with Mango Salsa recipe on this site.  Grilled asparagus, a few lemon wedges and fresh parsley.  It was a real hit and delicious.  The breading stuck to the pan which took away from the visual appeal but next time I'll use a cast iron or non-stick pan.

This dish is so good. The fish was crispy and very flavorful and tender on the inside. The thin coating of ground Almonds and parmesan cheese did not fall off the fish! I will make this for company - it was so delicious!

A great starting point for a gluten-free recipe (just leave out the flour and no harm done)! I saw some reviewers state that it didn't have enough flavour and they liked the Broiled Tilapia recipe better. So....I combined both. Sort of. Here's what I did:
~ 1:1 ratio of almond flour to parm. (I used about a cup each)
~ 1/2 tsp dried basil
~ 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
~ 1/4 tsp-ish onion powder
~ 1/4 tsp celery seed
~ probably 1/2 tsp salt

I then cooked it as per the directions, using 2 eggs with salt for the first step (probably only needed 1). This was enough for 5 ocean perch fillets with about 1/3 cup of almond flour mix left. I wanted to make it into a hushpuppy type thing, but didn't get a chance.

It was great. I was looking for a new way to make Tilapia and this was it. I did bake it instead of frying and so skipped the butter.

It was good but I wouldn’t make again. Wasn’t a fan of breading on tilapia. I may try costing on a different flakier white fish.

I thought this was so good.  I didn't use flour to coat the fish, and decided to bake it.  I baked the tilapia at 375 for 25-30 minutes (took out when it flaked nicely).  I sprayed the top with Pam as per other reviewers.  I bet this would even be better with the butter method!

Pretty much stuck to the recipe, except did not have parsley. Then to keep the crust crispy, I did not cover. cooked over just medium heat and in 2 batches. It was delicious with the lemon.

I didn't have any parmesan so  I used mozzerella and it still tasted good! I also used some leftover almond flour that I had and I didn't have garlic pepper or lemon pepper. Still fabulous! I can't wait to make it again.

Let me clarify this review- the recipe is excellent but DO NOT use Tilapia. Why use a fish typically farmed in China or Mexico (check out Tilapia on the web and see what these farmed fish eat and how they are processed). Any of these recipe's that use Tilapia can be substituted with fresh Alaskan Cod or a number of other sustainable and better choices. 

I typically used Cod from the cold waters of the Bering Sea. Never will use Tilapia again!

My girlfriend and I enjoyed it very much ...... an absolutely delicious meal (we made a nice side dish of rice and grilled vegetables). The prep time and cooking time are minimal when compared to other nice meals.... so even for a quick "spur of the moment" dinner, we both give it two thumbs up.... or if that is both of us, is it really four thumbs up?!?!.... either way, prep, cook, eat and enjoy..... we have this one saved as a fave  - Carolyn and Dave

I have pecans instead of almonds usually. No matter, they are fine. Lovely fish- I don't have much experience with fish, which usually doesn't come out well for me. This seemed like an easy-enough recipe. I started with frozen Tilapia- instead of a skillet I baked them in the oven on a cookie sheet, wrapped with foil. Absolutely delicious. This is giving me courage to try more fish recipes. (By the way, I haven't tried this fish 3 times: my fat fingers don't agree with the little buttons on today's technology!)

I crushed the almonds in a ziploc bag and it was super fast and easy!  Although I didn't add all the ingredients and used lime instead, this was an easy dish to whip up in a few minutes!!

We lightened it up a bit, omitting the egg and the flour and reducing the butter considerably.  It was still delicious.

This is the second time I have made this recipe as is and has turned out great both times, actually a bit better the second go as everyone remarked at how "surprisingly moist" the filet was inside that crispy crust as I have become more confident and comfortable cooking in butter at higher temperatures then the first time I tried it.

Made 2 times now. 1st time did exactly as stated, 2nd time I used suggestions & put lemon pepper & garlic in with the flour. Neither time could I taste the lemon pepper. We'll keep this & make again but doubling the lemon pepper & reducing the butter to cook in. I'm going to go back to original recipe to putting lemon pepper & garlic in with the egg.

I didn't think there was enough salt or other seasonings.  Also, it didn't brown in the oven so I had to put it under the broiler for about 3 minutes which then over-cooked it some.  Will not make again.

The only thing different that I did was bake it for 20 minutes instead of frying it. My husband and I thought it was pretty delicious.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have garlic pepper so I used garlic powder and black pepper and I omitted the parsley and lemon garnish because I didn't have that either. Super easy and quick! I plan on making this again. Next time though, I am going to make sure to use the lemon.

perfect as instructed. I used olive oil instead for a healthier choice but I'm sure butter made it even tastier.

We liked this fish and would make it again, but with few changes. I had some Flounder and  that's what I used. 1st, I sprinkled the fillets with some salt and pepper. I kept the breading directions the same but fried in a mixture of butter and vegetable oil. 2 minutes per side was  enough for the Flounder ( usually thinner than Tilapia). And, as another reviewer did, I omitted the step of adding more Parmesan cheese and further cooking of the fish. It would have made the delicate fish  very dry.

This was just okay.  Maybe the fault was because I used almond flour instead of ground almonds?  Maybe in the preparation?  Anyway, it was edible and made for a fast, easy meal.

Made this twice and it was delicious both times.  I cooked it in a mixture of butter and coconut oil  and also skipped the last step of adding more parm at the end.  It really is perfect as it is and doesn't need anything else.  My husband loves this.

I didn't have tilapia  so I choose to use Minnesota northern fillets.  Once you know how to remove the Y bone you end up with these beautiful fillets that are  phenomenal t.  I highly recommend this recipe.  it took a simple fillet and made it something that would be served in a very high-end restaurant.

Delicious! And so easy. It took 25 min prep time. I turned the stove to high heat until the bitter was melted and then the first minute of the filets. The I turned it to medium for the next 3 min flipping it.

Tasted great but my fish fell apart while battering it and then the batter didn't stick to the fish. Not so pretty, but tasted good.

This was delicious!  Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I added the lemon pepper and garlic pepper to the flour. I also mixed the butter with Canola oil to avoid burning the butter.   I only had 3 large filets and the parm/almond mix was the perfect amount.  If you have more, you will definitely want to double.  I finished with lemon and salt as well as the garnishes.  Everyone loved it, and it is quite pretty on the plate!  I will definitely make this again!

Flavor and crispiness of crust was awesome. Next time I will make cooking time adjustments because it wound up overdone. I would recommend closer to two minutes each side and maybe four minutes covered.  I will definitely make it again.

Cut the recipe in half and used 16 oz of fish instead of 24 oz. Still ran out of egg mixture and almond/cheese mixture.  Did not put more cheese on after cooking.  It tasted great but be aware that  you may run short of ingredients so stretch a little with more egg and maybe some bread crumbs.

I think the overall flavor and crunch of the fish with the almond crust was wonderful, I don't think the parmesan cheese on top added any value. The next time I'd make a sauce to give it a little pop.

The coating sticks to the pan and it is near impossible to flip the fish without tearing it up.

I thought this was excellent .... as has been stated by many others, the coating was barely enough for the fish - I suggest making more, by at least half.  We used garlic powder instead of garlic pepper, and olive oil instead of butter, and it turned out great!

So delicious. The almonds were in perfect combination with the cheese and added the right amount of crunch. My crust came off a little when I flipped the fish but it didn't matter. Still perfect.

Loved it !    Made 9/20/15.   My only note is that since I used only 3 large tilapia filets I made half of the recipe for the coating - but it was not enough.   I had to grind more almonds and shred more parmesan.     So if I ever was going to make this for more people I would make alot more of the topping.

This is very good, but it is important to know that the tilapia that the submitter is talking about, which comes from the Sea of Gallilea is not the same tilapia that we buy in the States.  Yes, they are both tilapia; however, the fish from there, which is called St. Peters fish, is so much more tasty!  It all depends on the water from which the fish comes from.

It was really easy and quick to make. I would recommend to make sure you have a big enough pan to cook all the fish at the same time so that they all have the same coloring of the crust. It was a huge hit in my house! Definitely going to be making this again.

I had two large tilapia fillets. I cut this recipe in half, and had the perfect amount of breading to coat both of them. If you have eight fillets, I don't think this recipe will make enough of the almond/parmesan coating to cover all of the fillets. That said, it was a huge hit at my house. We will probably make this again in the future.

I didn't have the recommended almonds.  Instead lemon pepper, I used lemon juice, and used garlic salt instead of garlic pepper.  So, it wasn't the actual recipe, but it was a good starting point.  We enjoyed it, I might try it again, with the right amount of almonds next time.

I baked, as did so many, with coconut oil brushed in the pan first. Dotted the fish with butter, no additional Parmesan, and it was quite rich. The almond/cheese flavor is so delicious, yet didn't detract from the fish. Oh, found the ground almonds at Trader Joe's, ready to go.

This was a good tasting recipe, but I made a few changes that I think added a lot of flavor. I decided to add 3 TBs of olive oil to the butter.  After the fish was done and removed, there were had some incredible drippings with pieces of almonds and the flavor from the parmesan and garlic, so I decided to make a roux. I added finely chopped green onions and a tsp of chicken bouillon then sautéd until the onions were translucent. I added a half cup of water and voilà! It was so savory!

This recipe sounded like it would be really good, but I was disappointed in the results. It's possible that it is something I did wrong, but the recipe is pretty straight forward. So I don't think so. I didn't have any tilapia, so I used halibut, and only 3 6 ounce pieces. I doubled the almond parmesan mixture thinking I would have some left to use at another time, I glad I did because I used all of it. I baked the fish in a NuWave oven which generally takes less time than a conventional oven, and lightly spritzed the fish with olive oil before baking. (This may have been part of my problem.) Aside from the couple of changes mentioned, I followed the recipe exactly. At any rate, the coating was not crispy at all. My husband said he liked it, but I thought one of the tastes was a bit overpowering. I also think it could have been better with a little more seasoning, possibly garlic. As it is, I didn't think it had much flavor. I may try this recipe again, but next time I will use different spices, and possibly less parmesan cheese.

I cooked this tilapia dish this evening and my family liked it! I used a combination of butter & garlic flavored olive oil to pan fry it.  I added sea salt and Old Bay seasoning at the end before covering it. The only other variation was that I omitted the parsley, only because I didn't have any.  I will definitely try it again, will probably bake it next time.  To the person who couldn't find garlic pepper, Walmart sells it, it's by Lawrys .  This was a great recipe, easy to make and delicious!

Great recipe!  I love the almond/parmesan combo!  I also baked the fish (400F for about 25 min).  My 19 month old, my husband, and I all loved it!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe but the fish just didn't come out the way I thought it would.  I've cooked tilapia before and never had any problem with it but I think the almonds just don't work with the fish.  Wasn't terrible but definitely not something I will be making again.

Yummy! First time ever making breaded fish. It was so good and pretty simple to make. My one year old son ate it up. I did burn the bottom of the fish a little. So I  just peeled away the burnt breading  but it was probably my fault so just watch the fush closely.

This was extremely good.  Followed most of the direction but since I am following South Beach diet(low Carb) so i skipped the flour and used 1/2 canola oil 1/2 I cant believe it's not butter.  Delish

Wow! THANK YOU for this recipe! A friend made it for my family and we loved it. I made it myself for two other families yesterday and both RAVED about it and asked for the recipe as well. What a winner!
Per the popular review on here, I added the seasonings to the flour.  I also omitted the second layer of parmesean cheese, and it was still terrific. The lemon wedge really cinches the flavor.

First, I wish I had done like others and baked instead of fried and used a olive oil/butter mixture since butter burns at low temps. And if I were to commit to frying, I wish I had fried at a lower temp. Med high is too high. It was OK. I have many many other tilapia recipes that I enjoy much more than this one. I'll try once more just in case it was me, but man was I disappointed!

This recipe was so tasty! I found that there was not enough of the almond mixture or egg to go around...I'll be sure to double it next time. I used garlic powder instead of the garlic pepper, olive oil (only about 1/2 tbsp for 2 fillets) instead of butter and cut the cheese back to half of what the recipe calls for. I also didn't add extra cheese on top as we don't eat a lot of cheese. I would definitely recommend squeezing a bit of lemon on top before eating, it added so much! Next time I will try baking instead of frying to cut the calories. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe! I omitted the flour and used a mix of butter and olive oil to fry the fish. I didn't have any lemon pepper, but it was delicious all the same.

This is awesome! I'm not a big fish eater, so it's often all about the coating. I often have trouble with my coating sticking, but the melted parmesan must work to hold everything together beautifully. Once when I went to make this, I realized I had no almonds, but had some pistachios that weren't getting eaten, so I used those instead. Yummy!

I thought the recipe was great!  I did add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to the butter to keep it from burning to quickly when frying. (Julia Child's tip!)

I replace the almonds with pistachio nuts because I am allergic to almonds.  I served this at a dinner party.  People kept asking for the recipe.  Because the fish is so soft I can't get it to look beautiful but the taste is spectacular.

This was delicious, but I made several changes which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I didn't egg/flour the fish, I seasoned it with garlic, salt & pepper then dipped it directly into the cheese & almond mix. Also used 3 types of cheeses, parmigiano reggiano, pecorino romano and classic parmesan (all freshly grated). I also took the advice of some other posters and used a mixture of butter and EVOO to cook it in. The fish turned out a beautiful crispy golden brown and was delicious.

This dish is the best talapia dish that I've ever had!  Of course I would substitue certain things to make it healthier!  I would use 3 egg whites (no yokes), a little more lemon pepper, whole wheat flour, only the 1 cup of cheese (low fat), and olive oil for cooking.

Delicious!! I used 1/2 cup of parm, 1/2 cup of almond meal, and 1/2 cup of coconut flakes for the crust. I let the tilapia sit in the fridge in the juice of 2 lemons.

I tried this recipe out on some wild cod fillets and it was delectable.  I've been using only stainless steel skillets for quite awhile for everything from eggs to crepes with no problem, but now I'm going to invest in a non-stick skillet just for this parmesan-loaded recipe!  I really blew my diet, but it was worth it!

This wasn't the easiest nor cleanest recipe to make but it was extremely tasty! I will make again but next time I'll lower the heat so to not brown the butter.

We're not wonderful cooks and we're always looking for something fairly easy that we can handle and still tastes good. This is definitely one of the best things we've made! Awesome recipe.

This was pretty good.  I added a little olive oil to the butter and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on it before serving.

I thought this would be an interesting mix of flavors, but I found the outer almond crust was bland and the lemon pepper/garlic did not make up for it. Next time I suppose I could add more lemon pepper and/or garlic, but I think there are better recipes out there.

Cooked it for dinner tonight...used mix of 6 cheeses instead of Parmasan and added few squeezes of fresh orange to the egg mixture. Instead of all-purpose flour use unbleached organic bread flour. Ate it just with a salad (mix of spinach, tomato, celery, avocado, scallions - with olive oil, lemon squeeze, sea salt, pepper)...yummy...

SUCH an amazing recipe! Great flavor, easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter, but I substituted garlic pepper with fresh, minced garlic, and nixed the lemon pepper since I didn't have any on hand. My husband, the picky one, loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

INCREDIBLE! A definite staple in my cookbook now. I didn't follow the recipe to a "t" but fairly similar and the whole family (even the son who doesn't like nuts) raved about it! :) So yummy served with healthy brown rice, white hominy and a salad. Can't say enough!!! :) Thank you for posting this recipe.

absoultely delicious...I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great! Not bad the next day either; if you heat in an oven. I would imagine the microwave would not do it justice.

This was good however, we actually prefer the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan from this site.  We didn't have enough parmesan cheese to melt over the top but this had a good overall flavor.  In my opinion, this recipe was missing just a little something.  I think a light sauce to go with it would have brought this from a 4* to a 5* recipe.  We will make this again but will need to work on a sauce to accompany it.

I used redfish for this recipe. I baked in glass dish with 2 tbs butter melted in bottom. Crust peeled off a bit and never got crunch. Will Try pan frying next time. Also used 1 tsp Lemon Pepper and no Garlic Pepper, because I didn't have any.

This is by far, one of the absolute best fish recipes here on allrecipes.  It's easy and perfect and YUMMMMMY!  Usually the topping falls off when it's in the skillet but this kept on and was a nice golden crunch.  I cannot rate this recipe high enough!

This recipe is delicious!!  We made this the other night and it turned out perfect!  Very easy and very fast.  We used 2 thawed tilapia fillets and cut the recipe down to 2 servings.  They melted in our mouth!  I highly recommend this recipe, especially for the non-cook cook :)

I never know what to do with my Tilapia. I finally found an interesting recipe. One bite and I must say, it was impressive! Next time to cut down on the fat, I will exchange the butter for EVOO.

This was just okay. I do not eat any gluten so I subbed the flour for rice flour. I thought there just was not enough flavor for me. I used high quality parmesan that I grated and it did not add the flavor I hoped for. I will make the Broiled Parmesan Tilapia next time.

I only used 1/2 the parmesan called for as it seemed like a ton of cheese for such small filets. If I made it again I would not use the full amount of butter, the recipe calls for MUCH more than is needed to brown the fish. It is a nice comforting sort of meal, but very mild in flavor and buttery. I might try it again with my alterations and some more spices.

I had purchased Tilapia and wasn't sure what preparation my family would like. Well we tried the almond crusted and it was fantastic.  I added olive oil to the butter so that it wouldn't burn. And the only seasoning I used was Old Bay.  DELICIOUS

OMG, this is definitely a great recipe! I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I seasoned my fish with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I didn't have any flour, so I skipped that step. Luckily, I used a non-stick pan, as I noticed that the fish stuck to the pan a little. It must have been the parmesean cheese melting. And a little squeeze of a lemon complimented the fish very nicely. It was quick, easy, and it tasted so good! This will quickly become a staple at my home. Thanks again for the great recipe!

This is so yummy! I had a friend try it, who absolutely hates fish, and he liked it! Very easy to prepare.

Very good. Will make again. Maybe a bit too much pepper for my taste.

This recipe was good.  I don't like fish all that much.  Tilapia is one of the few I'll eat.  I do think this is too much butter and would cut it in half.  I like that the almonds gave it a crispy coating.  I didn't serve with parsley but I did use the lemon wedges.  I think the lemon added a nice flavor.

It is Ok.  A lot of trouble and expense for it to be ok. We all ate it, even the picky eaters, but that's all anyone said was that it was OK.
