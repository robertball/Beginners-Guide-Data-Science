I like this a lot, but I changed it a little by leaving out the dill weed, I just don't care much for dill, only dill pickles.  I also added some shredded Monterey Jack cheese and a touch of garlic powder.  I don't think I would like it as well without the addition of the Monterey Jack.

Oh, my gosh!  After making this several years in a row for Christmas, I had misplaced the recipe last year and made my old one...everyone complained!  This year I was still unable to locate it and on a hunch, came to my favorite site hoping to find something similar.  What luck, I got the exact recipe!  Always a hit, thank you!
