This is one of the best salad recipes I've made from this web-site.  The combination of flavors is great, and the salad dressing is awesome.  My husband, who does not like eggs in his salad, couldn't get enough.  The only change I made was I used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and the dressing was not too oily at all.  Wonderful tasting salad!!

I'm sorry but I could only give this a 3 star. Too oily and very bland tasting. I do love Tarragon that is why I chose this spinach salad but there are many other spinach salads here so I wll have to try a few more.

Couldn't really taste the tarragon but it was still very good.  I decreased the amount of dressing by half, otherwise it probably would've been too oily.

I did this salad without the bacon (vegetarian). I did the dressing the night before and out it in a jar and shook it well before using. It was a good salad, needed to up the salt to cut out the sweetness a bit. Good with pasta as a basic spinach salad. It was well received by my guests.

Serve a bit of this dressing on the side. IT's delicious for dipping.

The vinaigrette is the best!  The salad can be dressed up with fresh mushrooms and grape tomatoes to make it perfect!

This is a great, simple salad.  The first time I made it I put a bit of the bacon fat with olive oil.  It was a bit greasy - but so yummy!  This last time I made it, I cut out the bacon, used only olive oil, cut the dressing ingredients in half and used sherry vinegar.  So good.  I love the tarragon with the spinach.

I created this recipe adjusted for 6 servings and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, using olive instead of vegetable as another user suggested. But there was just way too much dressing. Instead if I had it to do again, I'd reduce (for 6 servings) my olive oil to a 1/4 cup and the other dressing ingredients to half of the original amounts. Otherwise I enjoyed it and it received rave reviews from three other family members for flavor.

Loved it. I used fresh taragon, proscutto, and lime infused olive oil. Thanks for the idea!
