This turned into a dry, sticky, hot mess! I will not make again. when we were making the batter it was so sticky that we joked it was chocolate glue. they did not turn out well.

Followed the directions, and the cupcakes came out very very dry. I would agree the flavor is quite bland and the texture was quite disappointing. I wouldn't call them cupcakes, they remind me more of bad brownies. Would not make this recipe again.

Used good-quality 77% dark chocolate and I really can't say it was bland. A tad dry perhaps, but not bland. Adjusted it for high altitude (9,500 ft), turned out fine. My daughter and I had a blast decorating with chocolate butter icing and red M&Ms. Needs the icing, definitely. Not a fudgy cupcake, decidedly cake-y.

I think these turn out great, but makes better brownies than cupcakes;  as cupcakes, they are just too heavy.

I loved these cupcakes so much! I made them for a friend picnic and they were a hit! No leftovers!
