I used four sweet potatoes so I increase the cook time to 9 minutes.  Instead of transferring the juice to another pan to reduce it I used the saut√© function of my instant pot.  Everyone loved the result so we will definitely be making this again.

Didn't have orange juice...used pineapple juice instead.  These were wonderful. This is now a favorite.

Increased the servings to 10, still did well in pressure cooker.  Everyone loved them!  Way better than the old candied yams!

Perfect recipe. I added Craisins & choppee pecans just before serving. Next time I'll add some orange zest.
