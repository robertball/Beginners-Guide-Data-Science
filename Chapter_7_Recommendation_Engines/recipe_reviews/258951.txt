Loved these.  I didnt have whole wheat bread crumbs so I used what was in the cupboard.  Golden beets may be a little tricky to find.. I only found them in organic vegetable area, not with regular vegetables. The almonds were the best part of the trail mix I used in the burger so next time I will use a higher ratio of those I think..  I had these cold too during 110 degree weather.. yum

As this recipe is, the burgers are too mushy. I do really like the taste, though! I gave it 4 stars only with the following changes.
Use only 1-1/2 cups mashed sweet potatoes. Drain the beets. I think these two mod's will provide for a firmer burger. Other than that, they are delicious!
