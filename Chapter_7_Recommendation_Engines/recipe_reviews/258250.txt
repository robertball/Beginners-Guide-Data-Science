tasted great! could probably get away with making more enchiladas (i had some filling left over but no more tortillas) prep is the longest part but i didn't change anything on the recipe. will definitely make again!

These enchiladas are a treat bursting with flavor. It says it serves eight. I halved the recipe. I was able to fill 10 - 8” tortillas and still had leftover filling. The recipe requires a lot of preparation but the end product is definitely worth it. It took longer in the oven than 15 minutes. In the end, I increased the temperature to 190°C and cooked them 10 minutes more. Thank you for the recipe
