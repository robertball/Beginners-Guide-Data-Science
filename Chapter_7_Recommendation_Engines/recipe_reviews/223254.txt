I'm rating this a 5 star even tho I messed it up.  I combined the flour and the sugar and the egg but found it wasn't quite pliable.  I figured the recipe must've meant to add some peach liquid into the dough...so I did.  Then I forgot to melt the butter until after I had it in the oven.  I'm thinking it's good enough for a repeat as it's very simple to make, but next time I'm going to melt the butter and add it into the flour mixture.  Oh and if you don't have self rising flour just add 1 1/4 tsp baking powder & 1/4 tsp salt to the bottom of a 1 cup measuring cup, and level it off w/ all purpose flour.

Great taste and so easy to make!  I did sprinkle a little cinnamon on top just because I like cinnamon.  Next time I make this, I will cut down on the amount of juice I use - I think I went a little overboard this first time.

I was so puzzled when I mixed up the flour, sugar, and egg since it was dry and crumbly.  The recipe said to "pour" it over the peaches, so I thought it should be wet, like batter.  But, I dumped it on top of the fruit and spread it out.  Poured the butter over and made sure it was all covered. I used my 9 or 10 inch deep dish pie plate, and it just fit.

It was fantastic!  My husband loved it, too.  I might try adding a little cinnamon next time, but it's 5 stars as written.  I love the old time recipes.  My mom's cooking was from the 40s and this tastes like something she would have made.   Simple and tasty, and easy to make from simple, everyday ingredients.  Thank you for sharing this!  Your great-grandma would be proud.

Delicious and very easy to make. Tastes fantastic with vanilla ice cream. The inside was nice and soft and the top layer was just a little bit crunchy, which was yummy.
I did not have self-rising flour, but another reviewer suggested simply adding baking powder and salt to regular flour. This worked great. I used 1 1/4 baking powder per 1 cup of flour (didn't use any salt).
When I put it in the oven, I noticed the butter pooling a bit in one spot along the side. Once it was cooled off a bit, I noticed that it was also a bit too crunchy in one place along the side (probably where the butter pooled), so be sure to drizzle the butter evenly and not too much at the sides of the dish.

oh my goodness! just as easy as it is delicious. this is three times I've made this in a month and every time I experiment a little more (cinnamon, ginger, all spice etc...) I like to have fun in the kitchen, it's like a great big chemistry lab to me. in fact why discard the remaining juice? it made a wonderful fuzzy navel while I waited.

This was delicious!! It was a little too sweet paired with ice cream....but I ate it cold today after lunch...HEAVENLY! Will definitely make it again...soon!! Hint...when you mix up the egg flour and sugar...it will be a little clumpy...but just pour and spread over peaches...when you drizzle the melted butter on top, it will be enough to go over all of the mixture to make it come together and stick more. Soooo good!!

This was very good. I halved the recipe bc I only had 1 can of peaches. I also subbed oats for 1/3 of the flour, subbed brown for 1/2 of the white sugar, mixed the butter with the topping mixture before topping the peaches, and mixed a dash of cornstarch and lemon juice with the peaches.

This was one of the easiest recipes I've followed. It turned out very well, I used a cast iron skillet as my "baking dish" which cooked the cobbler superbly. I followed another review and add a teaspoon of cinnamon.tastes great!

I've made this multiple times in the last year or so; sometimes with the peaches, sometimes with other canned fruits, sometimes with fresh fruit. Always a hit around here. It's easy, and the biscuit-like topping turns out a little crunchy outside, soft inside....yum. No need to change a thing. It's definitely more "sprinkle" than "pour", since the topping stirs up crumbly but it all comes together as it bakes.

Was quick and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and baked it in my deep cast iron skillet. I will use less sugar next time, it was just a tad too sweet. I love the crunchy top!

Cobbler, by nature , means the 'crust' is moist on the bottom, over the fruit, otherwise it would be pie. We have made this recipe as written, the next time reducing the sugar by half (even better!) and today are experimenting with using stevia and peach juice instead of white sugar to further reduce the sugar content (my mother is diabetic and doesn't get to try many desserts). This recipe is simple and flexible enough to lend itself to experimentation.

I made this for a family reunion this week and everyone loved it.  Because I wanted to expand the servings, but only had 4 large peaches, I decided to use an 8x12 glass baking dish instead of round smaller one.  I sliced the peaches and they covered the bottom of dish.  Then I made double the recipe for the topping, using the 'make your own' self-rising flour mixture as mentioned in previous review.  This was so easy, mixing, baking AND the cleanup, only used one bowl, 1 measuring cup, 1 measuring spoon.  What a wonderful recipe

So easy to make a caveman can do it.  I printed the recipe and left it on the countertop.  The next day, my husband made it and pronounced it to be just like mom's.  Next time we would sprinkle some cinnamon over top of peaches before adding the flour. I would also prefer a little less flour 2/3 C and the rest oatmeal to give it more of a crisp topping - this was a bit thick for me.  Am curious if you didn't have self rising flour how much baking powder & soda one would need to add.  First experience we had with this type of flour and it does save a step.

I can't believe how tasty and easy to prepare this was. I served it to a friend and she has talked about this cobbler to everyone. And to think, it's made with canned peaches. I am making it again today but this time I am going to try it with canned pears. I hope it's taste just a great as the peach did.
Update: Made it with canned pears and it was very good. I even made it with fresh blueberries and it was very tasty too. I even made it once with all purpose flour (accidently) and my family even ate that but I don't recommend doing that. I baked that joker for more than an hour and it still didn't look done.

This is really really good!  But next time I think I will use less juice or put tapioca beads to thickin' it up a bit.  I will use less butter too, it ran over.

This was a great recipe!  Very simple and should be in every "Guys" cookbook.  I made the peach as a last minute addition to supper and we had no ice cream....tasted so good I did not even miss the ice cream.  Two days later I made it with 2 21oz cans of apple pie filling and had another 5 star desert.  Can't wait to try the cherry pie filling!

I followed the recipe. It was awesome. The only change I would make in the future would be to use a bit less butter. Also if using canned peaches make sure to use the ones in light syrup or juice, heavy syrup makes it way to sweet.

I made with 2 cans tropical fruit with the liquid and added 1/4 cup brown sugar with the rest of the recipe followed. This was delish, probably the best one I have had. I did raise the temp to 375 and cooked additional 7 or 8 minutes , and used a 9 x 9 metal baking pan.  This is my new go to cobbler recipe.

I followed the directions and the results were very unappetizing. The top looked wonderful, but upon slicing it, the underbelly of the crust was soggy. I will not be making this one ever again.

I came across this recipe and it proved to be very easy to make. It's great when you want a great dessert and everything is available both in your pantry and refrigerator! I did add some cinnamon on top for decoration. Delicious!

I liked this recipe a lot! Normally I incorporate a minimum of 2-3 tweaks from the reviews in each recipe. For this one I added a little cinnamon, but otherwise made it as described, and it came out very well. I was worried it would be bland, but it was nice. The crust had a cookie flavor. Easy and very tasty.

My family and I liked this recipe but, said to use more peaches next time. The topping came out a little too crunchy though. My Granddaughter took one bite and said she crunched into something.

Use freestone peaches for better result.  Make sure that you mix the prach syrup in the dry ingredients. The recipe was confusing, but the other reviews helped me understand the missed step. My family loved the recipe. It was gone in a few hours.

Great flavor and smell. I used a jar of fried apples instead of peaches. Probably need to cut down on the sugar though, it was a little too much.

This is actually now my go to peach cobbler recipe. I've Made it exactly as is and it's great just as written. I usually tweak it by sprinkling just a bit of cinnamon and sugar on the peaches first but you cant tweak a recipe then rate it. I give it 5 stars as written. It's the easiest recipe and after mastering the topping for this I use the same one for my homeade blackberry and other fruit cobblers. Last Thanksgiving I accidentally left out the salt since I just make my own self rising flour. I was so embarrassed to take it to Thanksgiving but hubby talked me into it anyway and STILL got raves! Several people said it was the best cobbler they ever had. Do not add any liquid to the dough. It's a strange recipe but make it exactly as written the first time before you tweak it. You wont be sorry.

Very tasty with less sugar. I used 2/3 cup, sprinkling some onto the fresh peaches to make up for no canned syrup. It still could have been less. Also I used regular flour w 1.5 tsp baking powder. Great way to use up peaches that were going bad!

this is yummy and easy! I did as recipe directed assembly wise,  but added a tsp of vanilla to flour mix, used 3/4 cup butter and drained off about half the juice from the peaches.  I really think you could go down even more on the butter. I also melted the butter in the baking pan as I have read in many recipes that the pan should be hot before adding ingredients.

Great 5 star recipe, Thank you!

I used 4 over-ripe peaches from last week’s market, peeled and sliced with maybe 1/3 cup sugar.  After resting to let a syrup develop I did the recipe as written except dividing it in to 4 large ramakins and used a fine cheese shredder for the butter on top instead of melting it.

Glazed, crispy crust with carmel cake and super sweet juicy peaches.  Didn’t need ice cream but if we had some it would have been impossible not to add a scoop.

Flavor wise and ease this is an undebatable five star recipe, it is PHENOMENAL!
I take away a star because I followed the directions exactly and knew by looking at it the breading mix was far too much. Did everyone else make it with a cup of sugar and a cup of flour? I imagine it was pure bread! I'm glad I followed my instincts and saved half of the mixture for another time, because when it came out it had just enough (if not too much) breading. I'm not upset it made too much because it just means I have to make it again.

The melted butter on top did not work for. I made a addition of orange marmalade. Just a little, this allowed me decrease the sugar. Giving the peaches just a nip of change to the taste buds.

However, I don't use peaches in juice, I use 2 cans of peach filling and drain nothing. 
Everyone in my family raves over this recipe!!

Well, that was easy. This is a great concept, but I did make some changes. No offense intended to Grandma, but maybe she wasn't fat like me! I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, melted it and mixed it with the crumb mixture. This made a nice, moist crumble with even butter distribution, so you can use a lot less butter. For sugar, I used 3/4 cup "Sugar in the Raw" turbinado sugar. For spice, I added 1/2 tsp garam masala (cinnamon, cardemom, etc.) to the peaches before topping with crumbs. Made in a cast iron skillet, this turned out homey  and wonderful. Thanks for this recipe!

I made as directed, but was surprised to find the flour mixture crumbly.  I guess when it said to pour the flour mixture, that it should be in liquid form.  Its not.  I was a little concerned about this until I poured the melted stick of butter in top.  Between the liquid on peaches and the butter, the flour mixture turned out nicely!

I made a few adaptations to this recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour (Red Mill ground) and 3/4 cup white flour.  I used frozen fresh peach slices and also sprinkled the top of the batter with a cinnamon/sugar mix, which made it crunchy afterit was finished baking. It was very good!  I'll definitely make it again.

This is my favourite nice and simple, it always turns out wonderful. My man will almost eat the whole thing alone!!! The only thing I did different is I mixed butter (cheap margarine actually) with the sugar mixture.  I didn't realize butter went on top until yesterday I was reading the directions to Dennis, and saw my mistake. It's like you can't get  it wrong.  I'm a great southern cook not a Baker, I rarely eat sweets. So I love easy desserts cause men have a sweet tooth

The only thing I added was a tiny bit of cinnamon on top of the peaches before spreading the flour crumble mixture on top. It was so delicious and didn't last the rest of the day! Cooked in 10" cast iron skillet. One of my new favorites!

I had one can of peaches (15 oz) and needed a late night sweet treat.  I had all the ingredients in this recipe, so it was a no brainer to make.  Recipe that doesn't require milk was what I was looking for.  Since I had only one can of peaches,  I halved the recipe,  I did replace some of the white sugar with dark brown sugar, used some cinnamon and didn't use very much butter (less than 1/4 cup melted), mixed the butter and some of the peach juice with the flour mixture. Basically I made a thick batter like sticky cookie dough, but it turned out nice and brown when cooked, like cake.   It definitely hit the spot, late at night straight from the oven.   (I buy peaches in 100% juice not syrup, they're less sweet, so the use of the sugar didn't make it too sweet like some reviewers have said).  I'll make this again when I buy more canned peaches.

Yes!  Like Grandma's!  Thank you.  I've been looking for quite sometime for this.  I did make twice the dough and put half on top and half on the bottom but kept the butter at total 1/2 cup. 'Cause that is the way Millie made it!  Cut the sugar in half.....  Crunchy on top and bottom and soggy/slimy/gooey in the middle.  Love the goo and the crunch makes the goo so much better.

Anything with Great Grandma in the name is a must have! Made these adjustments:  used fresh peaches, left out the egg, added 1/2 cup pecan bits and a sprinkle of cinnamon, crumbled the topping. It’s a little soupy but the added crunch from the pecans makes it phenomenal! YUM.

I used fresh peaches, so had no syrup.  Instead I poured over 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water, then proceeded with the recipe.  Next time I will add some gated nutmeg.  My family loved the texture of the crust.

I followed the recipe with a few modifications: I sprinkled cinnamon, allspice, and cloves on top of the peaches; and I added some syrup to the cobbler mix, just enough to make it pourable. It came out marvelously sweet. Even the cobbler is sweet! We loved it!

I made this recipe as is the first time, it was too bland for my liking. I modified it to make the topping not so thick and sweetened everything a bit more with brown sugar and cinnamon. The second modified version was MUCH better!

Excellent and exactly what I hoped for.  I too added cinnamon, first on the fruit, then cinnamon and sugar  on top.  I also used a regular size can of peaches and a can of pears.  It was delicious.  This is a classic southern comfort food and I will definitely make again soon.

I had to half the recipe because I had a smaller can of peaches!  Also had to add baking powder and salt because I didn't have self rising flour!  And mixed in a little brown sugar.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again!!!

I used two 15% cans of peaches from my pantry and used the juice from only one of the cans to pour over the peaches in the baking dish. Instead of self-rising flour, I used one cup all-purpose flour, adding 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt. I also substituted half brown sugar  and half white sugar instead of all white sugar.  I used a pastry blender to mix the dry and wet ingredients together. I accidentally forgot to pout the melted butter on top before placing the dish into the oven; after ten minutes I realized my mistake, took it out and poured the butter on top, But it didn't hurt anything, in fact, the top was nice and crunchy and moist underneath. Very easy to make, and great served with whipped cream or ice cream! I do plan on making this again very soon!

I used fresh strawberries for this cobbler.  Therefore, I had to sprinkle them with sugar and let them sit in water over night to make a simple syrup.  To get the desired browning on top I had to cook it 55 minutes and still the middle dough wasn't cooked completely.  However, the crust was perfect and slightly crisp.  I will make it many times over with various fruit!

Loved the topping.  Followed the instructions even though it seemed strange that it was so dry.  However, it made sense after I drizzled the melted butter on top.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I mixed 1 1/2 tspns of baking powder and 1/2 tspn of salt into the 1 c. flour.  The topping turned out to be soft on the underside and slightly crispy on the outside.  A lovely mix.  Also I only had dehydrated peaches I had made up several months ago from peaches off my trees.  After rehydrating them I used about 2 cups of rehydrated peaches and added only a light amount of the juice.  Will definitely make this again.

Overall tasty but maybe it was too "wet"?    Next time I make this I will cut down slightly on the amount of juice I used.     I had two cans of Freestone peaches to equal 30 ounces and then used half of the reserved juice from those cans. Without an actual measured amount of juice to use, I must have overestimated.

This was a hit with the family yesterday!  Made exactly as written except that I had to use two 15 oz. cans as I didn't have a large one.  Really glad I read a review stating that the topping looked to be far to thick (you have to kind of "cut in" the egg with the dry ingredients and spread around your pieces on top).  Turned out nice and crispy on top with some soft under the crisp part.

I made this recipe as written, and I am not sure The directions were clear enough. I used fresh peaches was the only change I made. It was good, but mine had too much butter, it was swimming in it. The topping was wired, very soggie with islands of crunch. I won't be making this again.

Using canned peaches, I thought the flavor might be a little mild, so I added an 1/8 cup or so of freeze dried strawberries (broken into little pieces) on top of the peaches before adding the flour-sugar mixture. I also, errantly, browned my butter rather than melting it, so I added a dash of vanilla to the butter, then sprinkled a teaspoon of brown sugar on top before baking. All in all, I was very pleased with the strawberry-peach flavor, and the ease of the recipe!

The cobbler was ok, I added some cinnamon. Personally I'd rather use fresh or frozen peaches with a bit of cornstarch mixed in to thicken the juice.

Delicious. Next time, I'll use 2 cans of peaches. I like the top a little more brown so I set it back in the oven on low broil for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally.

We really enjoyed this version of cobbler! it was not as thick as my version, but I liked this one better! We ate it with vanilla ice cream! I will use this recipe again.

We made this tonight. Be sure to place a cookie sheet under the baking dish! It bubbled over and my oven had a small fire which was extinguished quickly. Tasted great though! We served it with whipped cream!

I love this recipe. We have a peach tree. I make this every year. It's fast and so delicious. It makes me wish I would have gotten my Gran's cherry pie recipe. How awesome you have something that is passed down.

This a very good cobbler. The best I've found. Do as the recipe says. It comes out great. I added a dash of nutmeg, and cinnamon, and 1 cup blueberry's . With vanilla ice cream, it was to die for.  Well make this again. Over, and over again

I made this and it was fabulous! I took it to a gathering and they almost licked the dish. I added a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla, and a tablespoon of cornstarch to peaches so therefore I used all of the peach juice. Topping: added a splash of milk then sprinkled the topping with scant quarter cup Brown suger, oatmeal and cinnamon to personal taste. I may have to make one for just me! Thank you.

This was very good, but I found it to be more like a peach crisp, as opposed to cobbler.  It was delicious either way.

Awesome and so easy. I doubled the recipe except for the butter. I cut back just a tad on the sugar and the whole thing was fabulous.

I used fresh peaches that were getting a little too soft, sprinkled some ground cloves on top, and since I didn't have peach "juices" I added just enough butterschnapps to the peaches. Also, I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar for the crust. (I wanted to use the rest of my brown sugar up.) I'm certain this recipe would have been wonderful without my alterations...but it seems I just can't help myself! Next time, I'll try pears, cloves, and brandy...

Very good and easy to make. I did have to add some of the peach jucie to make the topping spreadable. It was way to thick. I double the recipe (all but the butter), and used a 9 x 13 backing dish. I also added some grounded cinnamon to the flour mixture. Peach cobbler would not be the same without it.  Becareful and don"t put to much of the juice over the peaches or it will not thicken. I made that mistake but it still looked and tasted great.

Great recipe! I gave my stepdad "dessert of the month" for a year and this was this month's! He loved it! Thanks again for such a great and easy recipe.  Note: I did not use self rising flour - used baking powder/salt as suggested by other users.  Also did use a little of the peach juice in the egg/flour mixture to make it not as dry and easier to spread over the peaches. Thanks!!!!!

We loved it! I followed it exactly and it came out great!
I needed to make a cobbler for a school dinner and  chose 
this one.  I made it, sent it then made one for us to 
eat. Very delicious!

Delicious and super easy!  I followed blondprincess advice below since I didn't have self rising flour.  Started with the melted butter and added a little peach juice to the batter to make it easier to stir.
