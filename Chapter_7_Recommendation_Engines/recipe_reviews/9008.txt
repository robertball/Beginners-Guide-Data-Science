The flavor of this dish has a lot of potential.  To increase the layers of flavor I made some alterations.  I sauteed the chicken with salt, pepper and added 3 cloves of garlic before adding baking. This step keeps the juices in the chicken which prevents the sauce from becoming watery, as this was a complaint of many others.  I also increased the sour cream by 1/4 cup and flavors melded together. I have also considered adding sauteed creminis for more texture in the sauce.

This is one of the few recipes I've tried on AllRecipes that I didn't really tweak and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!

This was excellent! My husband and I aren't huge fans of swiss cheese, but I decided to give this a try anyway.  I agree with other reviewers that the swiss/sherry combination is very nice.  It tastes more sophisticated than your typical cream of mushroom recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly. Cooking time was perfect.  The chicken was moist and tender.  Hubby and I both really liked this.  Prep was nice and easy too.  Next time, I may try bread crumbs in place of croutons.

We really enjoyed this - my 18 month old kept wanting more.  I adjusted this for 2 and it was great-tasting, but it didn't present well after baking.  This could be because I had only 2 breasts in a baking dish.  When I make it again, I will wait to put the swiss/bread crumbs on in the last few minutes.

Fabulous chicken dish!  This was super easy to prep and the cook time was perfect.  The only thing I would change next time are the croutons.  I will probably try fresh bread crumbs or crush the croutons rather than full.   Overall though great dish!!!

5 stars as it gave way to a new family dish!  My hubby loved it! I had to increase things (dill/sourcream/sherry and added garlic) as my family loves big flavors.  Still mild but it's a start for us!  BIG THUMBS UP! Heavily sprinkle SEASONED PEPPER on breasts---salt----2 slices per breast----MIX TOGETHER: 1 can of the mushroom soup--one soup can of sherry--1 Cup sour cream--2 chopped garlic cloves and POUR OVER CHICKEN.***Crush 1 1/2 cups of Texas Toast croutons to smaller bits (but not fine) and add 1/2 Cup Panko Italian crumbs.****Add 1 teaspoon dry dill (I didn't have fresh) to the 1/2 cup melted butter then toss in crumbs.  BAKE CHICKEN FOR 20 MINUTES-THEN ADD CRUMBS ON TOP.  BAKE ANOTHER 20. The flavor reminded me of San Remo Dip Olive Garden used to have.   I would even venture to add CHOPPED PIMENTO!

Good receipe!  I changed the cooking time to 375 degrees for 45 minutes. Turned out perfect. I also used fresh bread crumbs instead of croutons. My husband really liked this dish.

Tweaked it just a little - pounded the breasts, seasoned them with s&p and paprika, and browned in a little butter with garlic before placing in the baking dish. I left off the crouton topping but did spinkle a little dill on top. Delicious! The flavors of the swiss cheese together with the sauce were amazing. Definitely a keeper.

I'm always looking for recipes that keep chicken breasts moist, and this one caught my eye.  I made it last night (cutting back to 4 TBS of butter) and it was fantastic.  I served it on a bed of rice.  My picky 19 year old daughter absolutely raved over it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper

Made it as written. Didn't pound the chicken and had to add about 10 minutes to the cooking time. The whole family enjoyed this one, moist chicken is a rarity in my kitchen. Serve over egg noodles, there was plenty of buttery sauce to go around.

This was a very tasty weeknight meal.  I took reviewers suggestions and sauted some crimini mushrooms, then added the soup, sour cream, and sherry with some black pepper, and poured over the chicken and swiss.  I skipped the croutons, and just used plain breadcrumb with butter and dill.  Delicious over jasmine rice with peas and carrots.  I'm thinking about doung a lower cal version of this next, low fat sour cream and soup, and skipping the cheese and topping.  Thanks for a nice recipe for sherry lovers!

I was wanting Chicken Marsala, but I didn't have Marsala wine. I stumbled upon this beauty, and with the reviewers help, I created a delicious dish! Omitted sour cream (didn't have) and used parsley instead of dill. Add a bit of lemon juice and a can of mushrooms. Served with asparagus. Delicious! (Beware: searing chicken cuts down on bake time!)

this was fabulous.  my daughter "yummed" through her entire dinner!  I did crush the croutons coursly because the ones I had were those big "restaurant style" ones.  And - here's a good one - after I had everything all put together and it was ready for the oven I opened the fridge to get a glass of wine and saw the swiss cheese - that I forgot to put on the chicken!  So I just broke the cheese up in chunks and tucked it under the crumbs - it worked fine but I will definitely do it the right way next time.  :D

For some reason, the groc. store was out of chix breasts...so I used turkey breasts. I cooked it at 350 for about 50 minutes..but it turned out great. Very tasty sauce. I asked hubby if next time he'd like to try it w/chix...he said no, turkey was great.

This was really really good. My husband hates cream soups so I wasn't sure that he would like it, but after we were done eating tonight he said this recipe is definitely a keeper. The only change I made was to crush up the croutons. Next time I will probably use less of the mushroom soup since we had a ton of sauce leftover.

I loved this recipe!  The sherry makes the sauce taste fabulous.  I served it over rice pilaf, with asparagus on the side.  I will definitely add this to my repertoire.

This was really good! We didn't have any sour cream so we just put in a splash of milk. The chicken came out juicy and it had a great flavor.

This was really tasty, but definitely not too healthy. Served it over brown rice.  I cut back on the butter, only put about 2/3 of what was called for and that was still too much.  You could also use cream of celery soup and it would be really good. Had too much sauce for the amount of chicken I thought, ended up throwing a lot of that away which was a shame.  Will make again, but try to sub in some healthier ingredients.  It was super easy to make, so I did love that!

This is good. I used bread crumbs instead of croutons and used fresh dill. I finished this off in individual baking dishes over sauteed mushroom. If you decide to omit the dill, I would suggest replacing it with another herb - even parsley - and more than the recipe calls for. This dish needs a fresh green flavor accent, in my opinion. Thanks for the recipe!

This is easy to make and delivers a good, tasty meal. We modified this recipe by sautéing 1 lb. of sliced portobella mushrooms & 1 large red onion, diced, and added them to the soup, sherry, and sour cream mixture. We added an extra can of soup. The 6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts we used weighed 4-1/4 lbs. Not precisely sure of the cause, but the cooking time seemed off which has been noted by a few other reviewers. I suspect the large breasts were a factor, among others. Next time, I’ll cook at 375 for 45 minutes. The outside breasts fully cooked quite a bit faster than those in the middle so you may want to rotate about half-way through the cooking time. When making this again, plan to substitute Pepperidge Farm Herb Stuffing mix (dry) for the croutons, and cut back to 1/2 stick of butter. Overall, this is a very solid recipe with added potential to customize to your specific preferences.

Very popular with the family... We are health conscious, so I used fat free sour cream, and lite jarlsberg instead of swiss.... unsalted butter.... I also sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro under the cheese... I've made this many times

This was okay, but nothing special in my opinion. There are way better things you can do with chicken.

I made this chicken dish tonight for dinner.  It was really great!!  I substituted bread crumbs for the croutons and cut back on the amount of butter as another reviewer suggested.  Make sure you serve it over rice or noodles because you'll want to eat every drop of the gravy!

Very good with added cream of mushroom soup and wine instead of chicken broth.  I also sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and green onions.

What a tasty dish, the Sherry and Swiss cheese give such a great flavoring to this sauce. I did make a few changes since I had a ton of mushrooms to use up. I sauteed sliced mushrooms in some olive oil and minced garlic and green onions, and added that to the sauce mixture, also used about 2 tablespoons of fresh garden dill. I added a bit more than 1/4 cup sour cream. I didn't precook my chicken breast, just spiced them up with salt, pepper laid them in the dish with ample amounts of good sliced Swiss cheese and poured the sauce with mushroom mixture over it all. Baked at the specified 325 for 40 minutes and then topped with Panko bread crumbs mixed with some French fried onions that I also needed to use up and baked another 10 min until golden brown. No extra butter, in fact the soup was Healthy request and the sour cream light. The chicken was so  moist and tender and the sauce makes this dish, I liked the added crunch topping also. We served with mushroom rice recipe on AR.

This was awesome. I made some changes but I think it would have been good as is. First thing I did was sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and then I sauteed it in olive oil and garlic until it was brown. Also in regards to the sauce I doubled the sour cream(reduced fat) and added a can of mushrooms. I also put the dill weed in the sauce. I did not use any butter with the breadcrumbs (which were garlic and cheese flavored) because I wanted to cut on the fat content somewhere. The croutons added a wonderful crust that was really flavorful and it browned beautifully even without butter. I increased the oven temp to 350 and cooked the chicken 50 min since they were thick breasts. It was so good and so moist. My husband loved it and so did I. Thanks for sharing!

My changes: cream of chicken soup (mushroom allergy), unseasoned bread stuffing (that's what I had), half the amount of butter (plenty!) and almost double the dill.  Cook time: I have a convection oven and it only needed 21 minutes.  Comments I received: "Wow!" - husband.  "Awesome Mom" - picky daughter.  "You can make this at my wedding!" - 8 yr old son!  Thank you for the great recipe!  :o)

This was sooo yummy! I saved this dish for my "cheat day". I browned my chicken and I also added some mushrooms. I was wondering what others served this with. I just did fresh green beans.

Great dinner!!!!!!! I had some baby swiss left over from our trip to amish country and I used that in place of regular swiss and it had a wonderful flavor, the sherry was a very nice touch and the croutons i used had a great flavor with the dill - thank you for a great dish

This was really good.  I par-cooked the chicken in a skillet with pam (medium heat, add salt & pepper, several minutes/ side, till seared/slightly browned) and then put it into the 9x13 with a piece of swiss on each.  I covered the chicken with the liquid mixture (only use the amount of cream of mushroom soup recommended - I used too much :-/.  Also, add chicken broth, to make it more broth'y).  In the same skillet I cooked the chicken, I put the butter and dill that the recipe called for, & also added mushrooms  (I'll use less butter next time).  When melted, I added 2 bags of crushed Focaccia garlic croutons to the pan for the crunchy topping, mixed it up & put it on top of the 9x13 layers.
Cooked at 350 for ~25 minutes, and the chicken came out perfectly!
Thanks for sharing - great recipe!  I'll make this again. :-)

Yum!  I stayed very true to the recipe.  The only thing I changed was to substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream and cut the amount of butter in half.  I did add a few things.  I wanted more sauce so I used a second can of cream of chicken soup, but I ran out of sherry so I used a little home made chicken broth.  I also added mushrooms and onions to the soup mixture.  Served with steamed asparagus and green beans.  Can't wait to make it again!

Made this last night for dinner.  It was wonderful, the sauce is to die for.  I used shredded Swiss Cheese and did not add the dill.  I also used Italian bread crumbs in the place of crutons.  I only made three pieces of chicken (half of the recipe amount) but made the full serving of the sauce.  It was all gone, very addictive.

AWESOME!  What a flavor this dish had.  The sauce is absolutely wonderful.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic and Panko breadcrumbs for the crutons. My only negative thought for this recipe is - if you like dill, you need to add more or just do not bother to use at all.  I did not taste the dill whatsoever in this dish.  But it was still awesome......

This was okay. Why did mine come out so watery? Was it because I used chicken tenderloins? I wish I would have added flour to the sauce mixture.

Great recipe!! Very fast & easy. I added some granulated chicken boullion to the soup mixture for flavor. I put cheese on the chicken and then cheese on top of the soup mixture the last 15 minutes of cooking time until browned/bubbly for presentation. Omitted the dill, the butter and used fresh toasted bread crumbs. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was such a lovely, simple recipe - great for weeknights - yet the flavor was quite sophisticated.  I think it was the sherry that elevated it from an ordinary mushroom soup casserole.  I only changed a few things - added a dash of worchestershire sauce, and I used dried parsley instead of dill - I'm not a dill fan.  I might add more cheese next time, and maybe some sliced mushrooms and green onions to round it out.  But really, it was fine just as is.

I liked this recipe; it was good.  But the next time I make it I will use less butter than what the recipe says.  It taste too buttery the way it was.  Also I would use more sour cream than the recipe to mellow out the flavor.  I used aged Swiss cheese this time but I will probably use baby swiss next time.  I liked the recipe and I plan on making it again.

Great recipe, next time I will leave the dill out.  Just not my favorite seasoning but hub loved it.  I also added a sprinkle of granulated garlic.  Would have liked a bit thicker gravy.  Over all, Very Good, I will make it again!

Family loved it.  Sautéed the chicken in some minced garlic before baking it to keep the chicken moist.  The sauce  was great, but need to make sure you bake it long enough to cook the sherry down.  Used cornflake crumbs instead of croutons since that is what we had in the cupboard.  But I'd like to try with the homemade bread croutons next time. Served with rice and roasted broccoli.

I made this, but unfortunately ( or fortunately ) I had to make a substitution...my dear sweet husband used the last of the cream of mushroom soup and did not put it on the shopping list, so only thing I had to substitute was a jar of Alfredo sauce...it was major Yum! Served over a bed of rice yummy yummy yummy!!

I served this dish over rice and it was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make this again and again.  The only thing I changed was the type of cheese.   I was out of swiss but had provolone on hand.

Excellent sauce! Next time I would double it because it was great on mashed potatoes. I used skinless boneless chicken  breasts. I skipped the croutons with butter and just sprinkled dill on top.

Great recipe for chicken breasts. I did sear my chicken first in a pan with garlic then baked as indicated. Had a lot of flavor which sometimes lack with chicken breasts. I will make this again!

This was an excellent dish that everyone, even my picky eaters, enjoyed. I have also made this with cream of onion soup and jarred mushrooms (I was out of cream of mushroom soup). Either way is outstanding. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!  I pounded the chicken breasts and then browned them in about a tablespoon of olive oil.   Mixed the sauce in the frying pan to pick up some of the flavor of the chicken and heat the sauce more quickly. I didn't have any croutons, so browned 3/4 c. of panko bread crumbs in about about 2T butter and sprinkled with garlic salt.  I wanted to reduce the fat, so didn't add any more butter.  Cooked until bubbly.   We'll definitely have this again!

I'd say three and a half. I made two large chicken breasts but halved the toppings listed here. I think I might have used a bit less sherry (wound up a bit tangier than anticipated). Definitely a filling dish. Thanks!

This probably deserves 4.5 stars, but it is somewhat fattening and clean-up is a bit of a pain, so 4 stars. It is really tasty and almost decadent. I think pounding the chicken thin would improve this.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought the sherry and swiss combination did not work.  I have never given a bad review of any recipe...but I had to with this one.

So good! Don't be shy with the cheese. If you're doing more than 4 chicken breasts, I would make 1.5 or even 2x the sauce mixture. The sauce is awesome!

I have had lots of "flops" upon trying different recipes from this site, but this one was not.  Sooo easy and tasty.  Mine came out too salty, but otherwise impressive.    I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I crumbled Ritz crackers and I would do it again.

This dish was amazing!  My entire family, including the kids, loved it.  The only thing I did differently was use garlic butter flavored croutons.

All i can say about this recipe is what my gf had to say after her first couple of bites....Amazing. She loved the taste the mushroom soup added and the swiss was a big hit. Her grandmother loved it too (even without the cheese).

I seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt, black pepper, fresh garlic and onions. I also added some extra dill cause i like the taste. I threw the seasoned chicken in the baking dish and kept everything else the same.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very simple to prepare.  :) I doubled the sauce and I used bread crumbs mixed with butter instead of croutons.

This recipe was easy and really good. I used the low sodium cream of mushroom soup and about half the butter, I only had 1/2 cup croutons so made up for it with fresh bread crumbs.

Thank you very much for this recipe.  I've had it copied since 8-1-2003.  I couldn't review it then because I wasn't a member, but I've tried it plenty of times.  My family loves it.

I found this dish easy and very flavorful. I really enjoyed the Swiss cheese flavor with the chicken. The chicken was moist. I love to cook with sherry and this is another reason why. I cooked an extra chicken breast and the next day I sliced the "planned over" chicken breast and warmed it gently in the leftover sauce - served over rice - great !!!

This receipe is delicious!  The taste of sherry is just right ....and the chicken is so tender!

So easy to make!  I served this with Rotini pasta...and spooned the extra sauce over it!

Can't wait to make it again...5 Stars!

Thanks!
