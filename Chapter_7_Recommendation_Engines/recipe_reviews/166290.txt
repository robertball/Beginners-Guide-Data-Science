I found this very bland so I added 1/2 tsp fresh ground ginger and 2 tbsp soya sauce.  I didn't have a pkge of frozen vegies so I used 1 can whole baby corn cut into pieces, 1 can sliced mushrooms, 1 can slivered bamboo shoots, and 1 can sliced water chesnuts.  It makes a big dutch oven-sized pot, so if you plan on leftovers I would suggest doubling the amount of potstickers.

My husband and I love this recipe for a nice warm asian style soup. We use chicken and vegetable potstickers. Yum!! edited to say... We eat this often and decided to change it up a bit and added some frozen shrimp to the soup and it turned out so good!

My girlfriends and I hold a monthly cooking club in which we rotate the hosting. This was my month and I decided to go with an asian-themed dinner. I used this soup as my entree -- what a hit! It was so quick and easy I was able to entertain my guests and prepare this sound without messing it up at all! I substituted the regular chicken broth for low soduim chick broth since the recipe calls for sesame oil and salt. I also used pork and veggie steamed dumplings instead of just veggie dumplings for a little variety. My boyfriend can be a picky eater and he absolutely loved this! Definately a keeper.

I found this recipe while searching for something to do with a bag of chicken/veggie potstickers that had gotten stuck together on the ride home in the car and refrozen - and used it to unstick them. While the broth of this soup is a little bland for my taste, I so much appreciate the quick idea and base for a fun and tasty soup. You can add anything you want to it, use up leftover veggies in the fridge. This soup is truly ready in 15 minutes max, even if you screw around with the flavoring for a bit. I added a splash of oyster sauce, crushed red pepper and green onion, and mushrooms, carrots, water chestnuts and pea pods in place of frozen vegetables. Great idea - thanks!

this was a good base recipe, but i added some more flavor by sauteing some fresh mushrooms with the garlic and onions, and used fresh stir fry vegetables instead of frozen (Trader Joe's has a good fresh mix)  I also added a 1/3 of a bullion cube to the broth for more flavor. Also, I through the green onions in last so they'd retain their color.  I served in deep bowls, and doused with a little soy sauce for extra asian flare, and it was fabulous!

This recipe was delicious, most people who gave it negative reviews changed it so much they were hardly making the same recipe anymore! Also, if you do not use sesame oil (which I love and was the main reason I made this recipe) I doubt it would come out very good.

Great starting recipe. I added some crushed red peppers, ginger, and a little soy sauce. A little bland on its own though.

Great soup for a quick meal! I saute fresh ginger along with the garlic and onion, and added some fish sauce to the broth. Love it!

this was enjoyed by all, I couldn't find a frozen strifry mix that looked good so I substituted out for fresh veges and added to the chicken broth for about 20 minutes before adding the pot stickers.  Also added ginger to the onion & garlic.

This was really good. I used what I had on hand to make 1/4th the recipe. I had to use a 14 oz can of vegetable broth plus a 14 oz can of beef broth and it still turned out great. I substituted frozen snow pea pods for the stir fry veggies and I added 1 thinly sliced cooked pork chop to the recipe. Thanks SLOcook for sharing this recipe!

Yes I made it but I have to admit I improvised a lot. I had no stir fry veggies so I cut up four scallions , a half of an onion, I carrot, one green pepper, 1 small summer squash , one celery stick, for the veggies. I chopped them all in small pieces. Sautéed it along with the garlic in 2 TBL of sesame oil and one TBL of olive oil. Added my homemade chicken broth, 3 TBL soy sauce, 2 TSP of rice vinegar, grated ginger,  1 TPS salt and pepper to taste. I used organic chicken and vegetable potstickers from  Cosco.  At the he end, last two minutes I added scallion greens and the potstickers till they floated. All my veggies were also organic. This came out awesome!

Added about a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes to the onions while they sautéed. Turned out nice and spicy.

Excellent.  Added soy sauce, ginger powder as suggested which added good flavor to the broth. I did not add green onions and stir fry vegetables till last minute because I like my vegetable al dente.  I also added fresh spinach.

No changes. I agree it was a rather bland broth and I used a good brand sesame oil.

This was a big hit with my husband and kids! I do recommend adding 2tbsp of soy sauce to the soup for a little extra flavor. And I'm having a hard time finding a good stir fry veggie mix that we like, so I've started adding fresh sugar snap pea pods, fresh sliced green beans, and fresh sliced carrots. Making this tonight and I'm going to add a handful of fresh baby spinach leaves at the very end, and I think a can of sliced water chestnuts would be great, too. This is a wonderful low calorie meal that you can alter with ingredients that you have on-hand!

Thank you SLOcook for this recipe. It was excellent.  I made it as is and the sesame oil makes this recipe oh so tasty. However I only gave it four stars because I followed others advice and added a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce and instead of frozen I used fresh stir fry vegetables.  I have added this recipe to my favorites and will be making it again . Not because I want to, no not the case,  but because my hubby say he likes it and he would like to have it again. :>)

Although I upped the seasoning quite a bit, this soup didn't need it.   Taste as you go along.  Freezes well.

This is a good and fast soup recipe.  We love asian dumplings and I was looking for a new way to have chicken soup, and this is it.  I did not have frozen asian veggies so instead used a red pepper, broccoli, peas, flower mushrooms, and onion.  As written the broth is bland, if you are accustomed to asian food.  I added soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, fresh ginger and some siracha.  As other reviewers have stated that did the trick and I would serve this again.  Thanks for a great idea.

This soup is delicious!  I always read the reviews and suggested "edits" to make the recipe better.  I did add a generous teaspoon of red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.  Don't substitute the sesame oil.  It gave the recipe a great flavor. This soup was even better the next day.  Delicious!

I've made this several times.  I add some grated ginger at the end and it makes it even better!  I also add some garlic chili sauce to my bowl because I like it spicy (as I do with many Asian soups).  For those that say it's bland, I suspect their potstickers aren't very flavorful.  I don't see how this soup can be "bland".

Used the sauce that comes with the pot stickers to dip them in and even added some to the soup. Added some seasoning salt to taste.

Trip to TJ's today prompted having this soup for dinner tonight. I love how fast it came together and the result was delicious! We used TJ's Thai Veggie dumplings and added a bag of medium shrimp as well as lots o green onion.

I just made this for dinner....wow! We love it. It's so quick and easy.  Next time I will add more pot stickers since I'm feeding two teenage boys.  Thank you for sharing.

This was a delicious dish. I had to adjust the recipe because I didn't have  2 32 ounce cartons of chicken broth. I also added some shrimp. It was very tasty.

Good quick soup recipe! I used the chicken potstickers, miso ginger broth and French green beans from Trader Joes and it turned out well. I didn't have regular onions so just used garlic with the sesame oil, then added the broth with green onions and sesame oil. I will attempt to make this again once I have onions and actual stir fry veggies but this turned out pretty good!

I thought this was a good recipe, although bland, as-is. I salted the onions/garlic while saute-ing them, to help them wilt. I didn't have any fresh ginger, but added 1/4 tsp powdered ginger just before adding the broth; I also added 1/4 tsp dried red pepper flakes to the broth along with a teaspoon of soy sauce (in lieu of table salt).  When it came time to add the frozen potstickers, I kept the broth at a low boil (rapid simmer) and added potstickers a few at a time, so as not to drop the heat too suddenly.  I then followed the instructions on the back of the potstickers bag for cooking in a soup (in my case, low boil for 3 minutes).

Such an easy recipe! I followed some of the suggestions in the other comments and added red pepper flakes, chicken bullion, and fresh ginger. Better than a lot of soups you would order at a Chinese restaurant.

This is a great and light soup. I followed the directions with two changes.  The chopped green onions I put on the bottom of the soup bowls before serving (they float and stay bright green).  Insead of salt and pepper, I used soy sauce and pepper.  The quality of the pot stickers makes the soup and we used frozen potstickers that had a lot of ginger and spice. Thank you, thank you for a feel good and easy recipe.  Better soup than you can get in most Chinese restaurants and so quick and easy.  A keeper for sure!

Good and easy as pie.  My husband and I eat lots of soups and this is a winner.
