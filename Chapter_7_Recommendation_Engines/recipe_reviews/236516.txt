I was not lucky with this "Sriracha Deviled Eggs" recipe (my fault: not the recipe). I made it for my husband and it was not spicy enough for his taste, so I doubled up on the sriracha. It still wasn't spicy enough for his taste (he likes it hot, hot, hot), but the sriracha I have must be salty. I had already added sea salt to the egg yolks and with the extra sriracha they became way too salty. I suggest that if you want to kick up the heat in this recipe that you do it with extra cayenne pepper (not extra sriracha). I also suggest caution with the salt. Thank you jmacsaunders for sharing your recipe.

Tasty, yet not overly spicy. I like a lot of heat, but dinner guests do not always share that enthusiasm. This is the right amount of spice to serve at a party.

We had a deviled egg taste test between this recipe, 'Popeye Deviled Eggs' and 'Simple Deviled Eggs' all from AR.  This was the favored recipe by all the men in the family.  They liked the zip that the sriracha added.  A great recipe that I will be using again.  Thanks jmacsaunders, for sharing your recipe.

This is going to be my go-to recipe for deviled eggs now. I had to use regular mustard since I did not have dry mustard. Very pleased!

The flavor of these eggs was great. I put a jalapeño pepper on top and a little more mayo in them. I personally had a hard time with the color. They looked like the egg was bad.

One of the best deviled eggs I've ever tasted. I added a little more Sriracha Garlic Chile Sauce and transformed them into spiders for Halloween - thus Sriracha Deviled Eggs with a bite.

Made these for a baby shower with another dozen standard deviled eggs. Didn't really taste like much last night when I stuffed them but sitting overnight really added to the Shiracha flavor. The time really allowed the flavor to build. All eggs gone!

These have a really nice flavor.  Had to use a lot more mayo though.  The 2 Tbl of sriracha does have a burn, but not overpowering.  we didn't use any paprika on top.
