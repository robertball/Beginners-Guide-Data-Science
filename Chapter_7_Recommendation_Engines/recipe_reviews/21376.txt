This was really a quick preparing dish. I didn't have any green peppers or minced onions so I used a small white onion chopped. I went with Amanda's idea and added 1/2 cup of water to the soup mix. It just didn't look like it was going to be enough of it to add to the mixture. Now I did cook it in the crockpot but turned the heat up to high and it only took 4 hrs to cook. Next time I'll add other veggies like carrots or even broccoli to it. I think the type of ham you use also decides the saltiness. Mine hardly had any salt in it and I think thats what made the difference on the flavor. Was very filling.

Great idea for leftover Easter ham, Mary. I was worried that the crockpot would make this dish too soupy. For this reason, I put it all together, topped it with corn flake crumbs, and baked in a casserole for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Yum. I think this would make a nice brunch entree.

My family didn't like the canned soup and corn. They definitely detracted from this recipe. Next time I will use fresh corn and make my own cheese sauce. This is sort of a typical midwestern type meal - starchy and filling but a little bland and uninspired. It's quick and easy though, and with a tweak or two here and there and possibly the addition of some spices, could be pretty good.

I used pre-cubed cooked ham and it turned out overcooked.  I would probably add it later in the cooking time for better taste.  Make sure to spray pot with non-stick cooking spray so the potaotes won't stick.

Such an easy and tasty dish!  It was a bit dry the first time I made it, my slow cooker seems to run a bit hot so I added a 1/2 cup of water and it came out perfect the second time.

My whole family ate this up!  I used some leftover canned ham I had made the night before with pineapple and brown sugar and around a 1/4 of a real onion instead of the instant.  I also added a little salt and pepper.  I stirred once about 3/4 of the way through cooking.  Yum!

Great use for leftover ham. I was expecting it to be cheesy for some reason, but it wasn't. That being said, it's a quick & easy, great tasting crock pot meal that your kids will eat too.

We didn't like this recipe at all. The flavour was off and so was the texture. Won't be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe! I don't have a slow cooker, and I wanted to use my Tupperware stack cooker, so I threw it all in there and microwaved on high for about 20 minutes (I don't remember exactly how long it took), stirring every 5-10 minutes. Right before the last five minutes, I added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I've made this more than once, and I plan to make it again!

Very hearty and easy for a quick dinner.  I used cubed hash browns and pre-chopped onions and peppers to make it even easier.

I'm not sure why some thought this recipe bland. It's comfort food and therefore shouldn't be required to taste gourmet. It's easy to prepare and tastes great. All I changed was I added fresh ground pepper and fresh dill weed to the potatoes before adding everything else. It cooked all day and when I came home from work, I had a lovely meal that was very filling!

Bland. I had to add additional minced onion, garlic powder and hot sauce for flavor. We made this for my wife and I and my in-laws. No one liked it. Everyone said it had no flavor.    This recipe needs revising.

Me and my wife loved this recipe. I doubled the ingredients with the addition of a few others and it made a total of four meals for the two of us. The extra ingredients I added were: 2 cups of shredded cheddar (might have been better to use cubed but I needed to use up the stuff I had), substituted broccoli for the peppers, 1 - 2 cups of water (I like my soup to be soupy), Salt and pepper which I would not recommend; mine came out very salty, chopped onion, celery, and carrots. I also used uncooked pork ribs for the meat. Besides being too salty for my taste I would definitely give it 5 stars, and it was even better the second and third time around, so left overs are a plus!

Very delicious!  Whole family loved it.  Kids ages 9, 7, 4 all had seconds!  Was especially good because of the cold weather outside! (Well cold for us here in CA!)  Could have used a little more spice for us adults but all in all, Great!

We are NUTS about this dish!!  We didn't even have any ham--just a $1 can of Treet from the Dollar Tree store--but it all cooked up great! And my husband, like I say, is nuts about it. So good for you too.

I am pretty flexible with it comes to different meals and there is no way to say it nicely. The flavor was horrible, didn't taste any cheese and the canned corn overpowered everything. It was nasty and a waste.

I have made this several times and ways and it always comes out great! It is a thick, tasty dish that is wonderful after a day outdoors in snowy New York! Today's variation is to double the recipe, omit the ham all together, making up the difference in additional potatoes. I will serve it at our Christmas party tonight with a spiral sliced ham, roasted asparagus, a green salad and bread. Couldn't be easier!

My rating on this recipe is AFTER my alterations. After reading all the reviews, I changed a lot of stuff. I did not put in the green peppers, instead I put in broccoli. Also, I added the can of regular corn, and a half can of cream corn. I did not put in minced onion, instead I put in half an chopped onion. When it came to the sauce, I used 2 cans of condensed cheddar cheese soup and a half can of condensed cheddar and broccoli soup. I added 1/2 real cheddar as well to the crock pot, cubed.  I also used 1 1/2 cups milk and about 6 or 7 tablespoons of flour. Then I added about a tablespoon each of salt and pepper. It came out perfect! It was think with cheese and very hardy. I refrigerated what I did not eat the first night and it was even better because it thickened up very nicely.

This one will be part of my rotation for slow cooker meals.  It was easy to prepare and the family liked it.  Its not up there with spaghetti and meatballs or mac and cheese as family favorites, but it was hearty and satisfying.  I used two cans of cheddar soup and added canned carrot medallions.
The second time making this I added a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese - perfection!

I love this quick and easy recipe. I have been using it for about a year and just now getting around to a review. I do add some milk to the cheese soup, about 1/2 cup. This is great served with a fresh lettuce salad and bread. Thanks Mary Lee!

I love cheddar cheese soup but it did nothing for this recipe. I put butter in my scallop potatoes and it is very tasty.

My family loved this. I used onion powder instead and left out the green pepper and bought Smithfield cubed ham. My son asked me to make a bigger batch next time.

I used cream of celery soup with a can of whole milk. I also used 1/2 of a large onion minced. I thickened it last hour with a little corn starch and water. It wasn't quite enough to cover the potatoes so I added low sodium chicken broth enough to top it off. It was delicious I'd make it again for sure.

Delicious and easy, I added a can of cream style corn, onions, red pepper. I cooked it in the oven at 350, for about 45 minutes in a roaster.I did not use the soup , as the cream style corn made a sauce.

I think this may have worked better as a casserole.  I put this on low for 8 hrs.  My husband stopped in at lunch and added water as there was very little liquid. By the end of the 8 hrs, the mixture was brown. It was okay tasting, but not at all cheesey.

Wasn't quite sure this would give the 6 servings the original recipe said, but it did with surprising amount.  We didn't find this at all salty although it could have been a bit thicker on the sauce, it was soupy.  Served with fresh baked rolls this was a quick and satisfying family meal.

This dish was pretty tasty and very easy to make.  The only change I made was to add 2 1/2 cups of ham instead of 1 1/2.  Cooking time was right on at eight hours on low.
