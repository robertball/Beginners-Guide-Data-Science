Great recipe, very tasty with some kick.  I found using Andouie sausage instead of the kielbasa and adding a little habenero pepper makes it a very spicy and tasty chili.

I made this recipe for a chili cook-off and won!!! Its easy and tasty. It does say to reserve the juice from the tomatoes but doesnt tell you how much to reserve, so I used it all. I also dont drink and substituted the wine with alcohol free wine, no one could tell the difference.

Wow is all I can say.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of the plain whole tomatoes and I used banana peppers instead of bell peppers.  I also added quite a bit more chili powder as we like oour chili spicy.  This is one of the best Chili recipes I have ever tried.  Thanks for the great recipe Monica.  A must try.....

This is a very interesting tasting chili. I love Merlot, and the wine taste is very distinctive in this chili. This is a recipe that can easily be adapted to ones taste, such as maybe using diced tomatoes instead of whole, chili beans instead of pintos and adjusting the amount of spice. But I just made it as written and I really like it alot. It is in the crock pot simmering now and my husband is going to love the addition of the kielbasa. Thank you Monica, I really like this chili!

We did not find this spicy at all, so I added about 1/2t cayenne pepper.  Doubled the chili powder to get the right flavor for us.  I used pre-cooked bacon, which lost all crispiness once combined (it had the consistency of uncooked bacon - bleck!) - next time, I'd either use real bacon or crumble pre-cooked on the top of each bowl.

this was one of the best chillies that i have made. i put in a bit more jalepeno, and used smoked sausage. the smoked sausage and bacon give it a nice smokey flavor.

It says to reserve the liquid from the tomatoes, but doesn't say how much to use, so I obviously used my own judgement. It also said that it was spicy and I didn't think so. So I added cayenne pepper and thought it was better. My boyfriend absolutely loved it!

This chili is awesome.  So easy and quick to prepare after a long day.  I also added more chili and it was great.  The flavour is amazing.

Smally kanockies! This stuff will buzz snap yer suspenders right off ya if I’m makin it! What a well thought out, flavorable, tasty, and easy recipe. However, I’m an adventure seeker, so status quote never makes it for me. Added more bacon, some habaneros, used rotel diced tomatoes with Chile’s, and pinto chili beans. Threw all of this in the insta-pot, and squeezed that concoction like I did that gal I got my first kiss from....WOW, THE ROCKETS RED GLARE, BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR, AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF VETS CHEERING FOR OUR PRECIOUS COUNTRY! Dang this stuff is great. Many thanks for the contributor of this one.

I'm sorry, but this just didn't cut it for us. I ended up kind of combining it with the Pasta e Fagioli recipe I have to give it more flavor and appeal. Really wanted to love this recipe. Maybe I'm not a Merlot wine fan. It seemed to give it a spoiled scent and flavor to me. JMO

Very good!  I made it exactly as stated; however I sauted some fresh garlic and added some Adobe Lemon Pepper Season.  I really enjoyed the wine flavor.

Folks.. the best chili bar none.. You can mess with it to add or even remove spice, the melding of the meats is outstanding.  Had an outdoor party in November (Chicago) and this chili was perfectly paired with the fire pit and Blackhawks game on the projector!
