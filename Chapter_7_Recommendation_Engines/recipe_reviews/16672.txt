I have made this recipe again and again with only one modification-I waited to add the evaporated milk until the end. I add it last with the clams, then heat through. Keeps the milk or cream (depending on what you use) from curdling! My original crock pot was fine with the recipe as is, but the new one burnt and curdled it. So, waiting until the end to add the milk was the charm for me!

Great foundation recipe.  Only 4 stars because chowder original recipe more watery and not as creamy as my family likes.  We needed a good hearty hot meal to eat with buns during our ski day, so I doubled the recipe for our 7qt crockpot. Cooked on high for 5hrs.  See 2 photos I contributed for my results from this recipe.  I added additional ingredients & adjusted some of the original items (these are for the doubled recipe unless otherwise specified).  Added: 2tsp thyme, 1 bottle clam juice (236ml) & the reserved 1 3/4cup clam juice from cans), 250g chopped crabmeat, 1/2 cup roux to thicken soup (heat on the stove 1/2 cup melted butter & whisking in 1/2 cup flour for less than a min.)  I only used 1/2 a carrot total, cubed 6 potatoes (1/3" size), & fried bacon slices first. I then added 1 can condensed cream of mushroom & 1 can condensed cream of potato.  As per other reviewers, evaporated milk was added at 1.5 hrs left to cook to prevent curdling. Added the clams & crabmeat at this time too.  Added roux with 50 min left when it looked too watery to me.  My 7yr old is so-so with chowder (doesn't like chewy clams), but she ate up her whole bowl (she liked the crabmeat). Changes for next time, not double original clam juice amt, therefore add only 1/4 cup roux.  My 10yr old & husband also were impressed at the results.

This is great! I've never made Clam Chowder before, but after reading the reviews decided to try this with a few additions. I did use two cans of clams, and I'm glad I did; even with that they seemed a little thin on the ground. I used 4 potatoes, which seemed just about right; I used 2 onions, rather than measure a cup. My crockpot cooks pretty hot, so I added the milk when I added the clams; after 4 hours on high. The milk and clams got about 20 minutes on high, 20 minutes on low, then we ate. Yum yum yum! One suggestion for a side; Garlic Cheese Quick Bread, from this site. I made this for my birthday dinner and was not disappointed! Thanks for a great recipe!

This chowder curdled in my crock pot.  I followed the recipe to put crock pot on low for 9 hours.  I was very disappointed that it did not work out.

Our house smelled so good as this cooked! It was really good, but was more of a soup then a creamy chowder!  **Not complaining** It was still really good! Made a lot for a family of three!  But still good reheated!

This recipe turned out awful.  All the milk curdled.  You can't put the milk in and then cook it for 9 - 11 hours!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time the milk curdled in the crock pot when I didn't stir it.  The second time I was home and stirred it every 2 hours or so.  It did not curdled, but it came out with an odd brown color and a film over the top (I'm assuming from the bacon grease).  It was edible the second time but I probably won't make it again.

I made this for my mother's birthday and she absolutely ADORED IT! And that's a lot coming from my mother, she's VERY picky.  I made a few minute changes. For example I used 3 cans of minced clams because my mother loves clams. I also used hormel real bacon bits instead of the sliced bacon because that's what I had on hand. It worked out GREAT! I will definitely be making this recipe again! Thanks!

I have used this recipe several times, but with a few changes. I use 2 cans of clams, and I put at least 2 cups of liquid into the pot. I also add some garlic, and I don't add the milk until I add the clams close to the end. With those changes, this is my family's favorite clam chowder recipe, and something I will be cooking for years to come!

I doubled the clams and potatoes as others suggested, but still needed more clams. I left it on low for 8 hours and came home to a slightly burned chowder. The flavor was pretty okay, but the potatoes cooked for too long and were mush, and it was slightly brown from being burned.  I might try again when I can get home sooner. Maybe my crock pot cooks too hot.

Watery, bland, non-clam Chowder. I made this exactly to the recipie and it was very bland. Very watery and tasteless and a teeny 6 oz can of clams gets lost in all the liquid.. I'm shocked it has a 4 star rating. It also is way more than 6 servings since given so much liquid is in this recipe.

I can't get over how disapointing this recipe is.  I came home to find brown curdled soup with a black crust on top.

This was delicious and rivaled all of the chowders I've had in New England in the past 25 years!  I did use 3 cans of clams and their juice; one can didn't seem like enough.  The bacon cooked nicely, potatoes done through; I did set the lid askew for the last hour so it would reduce and thicken a bit.  This recipe is a winner!

Absolutely critical to HOLD the cream until your last phase if you have a newer crock pot or one that often cooks faster that what most recipes suggest on a 'low' setting.  Ours can cook a full pork butt on low in less than 8 hours to perfection, but almost every recipe we find says 8-10 at least while some say 12-16.  It truly depends on the age of your cooker and the manufacturer, so with a cream based soup it's best to wait as long as possible or it will CURDLE.

Yes, the milk curdles, but it is tasty.  I would add that it needs some extra salt. Definately worth making if you are searching for new crock-pot dinners.  Carrots work out nicely, too.

This recipe was easy and delicious despite the fact that the half & half (instead of evaporated milk)curdled. Had great flavor; would make again but may try cream next time.

didn't rate this recipe because i we didn't care for it and it's probably because of my sons and i are used to more robust meals. followed the recipe and added 3 cans of clams, but being from south louisiana(yes we did indeed survive Katrina without any government help) this dished lacked the flavor that we are used to. for folks that are in other parts of the world, this might make a good dish.

This was delicious! The only changes I made was using turkey bacon and adding the milk the last hour since my crockpot runs hot.

It was a bit watery but, otherwise, okay. I'll try again.

Definitely loved it!!  The soup was super-creamy and delicious, and my family and friend loved it. The only change I made was adding two cans of clams instead of one, and I added some extra black pepper. Definitely recommend it!

I did really like it. But I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I'm still looking for that "Perfect" Clam Chowder. And I've done both "Shredded" as well as "Cubed" carrots and prefer it cubed. All-In-All though, I was impressed. Really good!

Turned out great! Yes = save dairy for the end. Yes = had to add roux/thickener for creamier texture after dairy. No = 5 hours on high was not long enough for my (old?) crock pot. I fortified mine with: double the carrots (2 shredded, 2 chopped, added sweetness), new/red potatoes,  1/2 pound of shrimp, 5 oz of poached salmon (used this AWESOME recipe: www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233932/poached-salmon-in-the-microwave ). Tip: refrigerate poached salmon an hour-ish so it chunks instead of completely shreds when added at the end. BTW, I used bottled clam juice and frozen smoked clams from the H-Mart (Korean Supermarket). My spouse loves chowder and ranked this one "up there with Pike's Market" in Seattle! THANKS for sharing it!

I used 4 cans of clams which gave me the 1 3/4 cups of liquid.  I cooked the bacon, then crumbled   and added along with the clams and only 1 can of evaporated milk an hour before it was ready to serve.  Will definitely be making again, especially since cutting my potatoes small this was ready to go in 5 hours on low!

I substituted turkey bacon and it came out absolutely delicious! I have rarely cooked using condensed milk and normally would use heavy cream - this was an easy to make and hearty dish!

I didn't have any bacon, but it was still great. I subbed cream of celery for the soup (all I had), added a few bay leaves, and a can of drained corn to make up for the missing bacon. I waited to add the milk as suggested by others. So great and easy! Next time I will add a little thyme. Mine was done after 3 hours on high. My crockpot runs very hot. Will make again!!!

I liked this recipe and I will make it again.   I doubled the recipe and instead of two cans of cream of mushroom soup I made one a can of cream of potato soup. I also used one 2.8 oz. bag of pre-cooked bacon bits (Oscar Meyer Hickory flavored) instead of frying the bacon myself.  I added the bacon bits, minced clams and the evaporated milk during the last hour of cooking.  I cooked it for five hours on the high setting.  It turned out very good!

My family loves this!  I modified the recipe a little...I use 2 cans of clams and I also throw in some shrimp and scallops (so I guess it's more of a seafood chowder at that point).  I add the seafood and the evaporated milk at the end as suggested and it turns out great!

This was amazing! I added the milk at the end, as did some others, and added some changes that BlogAlotAliCat made. The only thing I added was at the very end, before serving, I sautéed some fresh lobster and crab meat in a pan, topped the bowls of soup with the meat, and then sprinkled some "Old Bay Seasoning" atop it all. Great recipe!

I used 3 cans of minced clams. I left out the carrots and used 4 potatoes. I added a little of Old Bay seasoning. I added the clams in the last hour.  My family really liked it. I will make it again.

Delicious! I took a couple of the other tips. First, I waited to add the evaporated milk until the last hour so it didn't curdle. I also added a can of diced tomatoes in the beginning. Definitely a keeper!
