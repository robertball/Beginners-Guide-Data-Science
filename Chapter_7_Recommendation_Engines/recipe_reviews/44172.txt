Many low-carb recipes use pork skins as a subsitute for bread crumbs.  This is usually what makes the food so salty, not the garlic.  Keep this in mind- I usually skip the salt all together and add a little fresh garlic or onion instead!

A great way to serve meatloaf with less fat and more protein. I did mine "Cheeseburger-style." I used 1 lb. extra lean beef and 1 lb. ground turkey, 3/4 cup cheddar cheese flavored pork rinds, 1/2 cup egg beaters instead of the 2 real eggs and Lawrey's seasoning. I layed it out on a sheet pan and topped it with 1/3 cup green onion and sliced low-fat American cheese on top, then rolled it up and baked it in a loaf pan for one hour at 375. Turned out so pretty and tasted fantastic!!!

Since my husband and I are on the Herbalife diet plan I needed more protien and less calories.  So, I made a few adjustments that boosted the protien to about 30 and lowered calories to around 300, as well as added a side dish.  Use 1 lb. Ex.lean ground beef (93/7)and 1/2 lb. ground chicken. Replace eggs with 1/2 cup Southwestern egg beaters. Exchange plain porkskins for BBQ flavored and omit Chili powder. Replace garlic salt with fresh or jarred chopped garlic (helps reduce saltiness others complained about). Keep garlic pepper and add 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I forgot the worchestershire and it was okay without it. Add about a 1/2 cup of finely choped onion. Mix well and form loaf. Put in retangular casserole dish.  Bake as directed. About 20 minutes before meatloaf is finished remove from oven and add 2 cans french green beans and 1 can diced tomato around sides of loaf and coat top of loaf with a mixture of 1 sm. can tomato paste, 1 Tblsp. chilli sauce and 2 Tblsp. ketchup. Return to oven and finish baking. I recomend using a meat thermometer to make sure meat is thoroughly cooked. I served with a salad for a wonderful, tasty and healthy meal.  My son didn't even know he was eating "diet" food, so everyone was happy.  Thanks for a great recipie...this one is a keeper at our house!

Meatloaf is very salty!  I would use maybe just regular powered garlic next time instead of the seasoned salt.

I did as instructed and also made the following changes: omitted garlic salt and used 1 Tbsp garlic powder, 2 tsp minced garlic, BBQ flavored pork skins. Added 2 ounces of heavy cream, 1 Tbsp oregano, 1 Tbsp cayenne pepper, chopped green onion. Put half the amount of meat in the loaf pan then added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and then put the rest of the meat in the pan so the cheese is in the middle. (Got the idea from Emeril!). It came out so delicious and flavorful and very moist! The grease from the cheese does rise up making it look odd, but it is a great low carb dish that tasted excellent! Will be doing this one again. Thank you!

I never add the pork skins.  Adding filler to meat loaf was started to make the meat stretch not in enhance the flavor.  I add lots of chopped fresh mushrooms, onions, and red peppers.

This recipe rates well for ease of preparation (my boyfriend made it on his own in less than 10 minutes -- and he DOES NOT COOK!); but it rates low for flavor due to an excess of chili powder (2.5 TBSP!!!) and salt. I'd follow LOWCARBGIRL's advice to not add any other salt outside the pork rinds. Being on Atkins, this one is a keeper so long as I replace some of the chili powder with other spices like thyme, oregano, parsley... The kids ate it, but noone asked for seconds.

I love this recipe! I use ground turkey and I add basil and Italian seasoning! I also use spicy pork skins, being from the south, it really adds to the spices! It is a great meal for those watching their carbs!

Upon reading the previous reviews, I went ahead & left out the garlic salt entirely - just added fresh minced garlic instead & only used 1 Tbsp of Chili powder w/ this one.  2.5 seems excessive & my kiddos can't take that much spice ...yet! Otherwise - it was wonderful & had great flavor - & that's coming from someone who previously - since I was a child - HATED meatloaf! This is definitely a keeper.

Did not form a loaf at all, and I used over a cup of crushed pork skins.  Its close to a loosemeat than meatloaf.

This recipe was a great idea! Was looking for low-carb recipes..perfect for us on that diet. Turkey chopped meat works great as well, try that. Didn't have the pork skins, so I chopped up pecans-sounds weird, but it's good. Ran out of worcestershire so I used lite teriyaki instead. The seasonings are good, but i substitute the garlic pepper with Adobo seasoning, adds great flavor. Also try adding some dried onion flakes. Then sprinkled shredded cheddar on top at the last few minutes of baking.

This recipe is as good as any other meatloaf I've tried and this time it is lo-carb. I did reduce the amount of garlic salt to 1/2 teaspoon as others had complained of it being too salty.

This is a great recipe.  I too modified like others did.  I used 90/10 ground beef.  I cut back to 1/3 of the garlic salt and used no salt added tomato sauce.  I also cut back a lot on the chile powder due to personal preference...a tablespoon was plenty.  We don't do pork rinds, so I replaced that with grated parmasean cheese.  I also used egg beaters instead of eggs.  Had a bit of jar pizza sauce left and coated the top with that during the last 15 minutes of baking.  Before topping with the sauce, I poured off most of the liquid in the pan.  All in all, delicious.  I served with cheesy broccoli and it was a hit!  Definitely a do-over.

My husband is a meatloaf lover and we thought he'd have to give it up when he went low carb.  I do not like meatloaf, but even I like this recipe!!

Twice now I've forgotten the crushed pork rinds and it has turned out fine, anyway.  I think I'll just leave them out on purpose in the future.

Made this straight from the recipe with no changes.  I've enjoyed jucier meatloafs but this was tasty, spicy, and very easy to make.  All in all, a solid recipe.

Just made this and it is pretty good. A little bland but will continue to experiment, maybe with hot salsa and a little extra onion. My husband and FIL ate it on bread as a sandwich and loved it (of course they don't worry about carbs!!)

Wow - this was great!  I will never go back to my old recipe!  I used minced garlic and omitted the garlic salt, added pepper and dill, and only about half the chili powder.  My family loved it!

Couldn't tell it was low-carb!  Made a few modifications and deleted all garlic salt/pepper and added half a raw diced onion.  Topped with a small amount of ketchup mixed with chili powder to carry the flavor from the meat!  GREAT DISH and definitly a keeper!

I gave this 5 stars because the no carb concept is
great and with changes for our personal taste it
turned out perfect. I left the chili powder out,
added 1/2 teas. ground mustard, garlic powder
instead of salt and used 1/2 ground chuck and
1/2 ground pork like I would for any meatloaf.
Put a little more tomato sauce on top and YUM!
Next time I might up the pork skins and see what
happens.

I used 2 pounds of ground beef and otherwise followed the recipe pretty much.  It was a bit sloppy but the last 5 min, I put some slices of cheese on top and that helped keep it together.  Pretty darn good.

This was a really good meatloaf, although I added a few things. I added 1/4 cup of onions and diced tomatoes in the meat before baking and used another half a can of tomato sauce for the top. I also use Hot and Spicy pork rinds. It comes out excellent and my family LOVES it so much I have to make 2!

This is great- my son recently was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and I've been looking for low carb versions of his favorite foods- I omitted the chili powder and added dried onion instead- everyone loved it!

My family declared this meatloaf to be the best I've ever made.  I subbed salsa for the tomato sauce because of such a large amount of chili powder.  I put some grated cheddar cheese in the middle. Fabulous!!

I liked the recipe but 2 1/2 Tablespoons of chili powder??  Too HOT for me!  I used a roughly a 1/4 of that and it came out great.  Also, I used fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt.

2 1/2 tablespoons of chilli powder was WAY too much! It was inedible. 

Also, needs at least 60 minutes to cook at 375.

After reading the comments I cut the salt to half. I also substituted the tomato sauce with a splash of A1 in the mixture and then a thin layer on top. It came out WONDERFULLY!

I gave this 5 stars because I was looking for this type of recipe and it did not feel like diet food. I used less chili powder because of reviews. Fresh garlic and omitted any other salt other than what was in the rinds and worchestershire sauce. I topped with Monterey Jack cheese and had with mashed cauliflower. It was a wonderful meal and I do NOT like meatloaf but this was good and my husband is not eating low carb and he loved it too. Thanks for posting

Meatloaf would have been really good minus all of the salt.  I would have just added garlic alone, not garlic salt.

My husband is very picky and asked that I not make this again....but I'm sure with a few changes it would be ok.  I used 93% lean beef and it was just too dry.

My family loved this! I omitted the garlic salt and went with 1 tbsp of garlic powder. I used plain ground pepper instead of the garlic pepper. Added 1 cup of minced onion. Served with garlic mashed cauliflower!!! Total hit!

Tried it, loved it.  Since I love hot and spicy,  I made it again using hot and spicy skins and pureed rotell in place of the tomato sauce.  The last 5 mins. I melted no carb pepperjack cheese on top.  It was wonderful.

Not bad at all. When I took it out of the oven, there was literally a puddle of grease on top of the meatloaf, which I poured off... I suppose that was better than having the grease in it. Maybe all meatloafs are like that? This was my first time making/eating meatloaf. My boyfriend (Mr. Low Carb) really liked it, which is who I made it for. I did omit the garlic salt and garlic pepper, using garlic powder and black pepper instead. Thanks!

The whole family thought this meatloaf was good, including a husband who doesn't count meatloaf as a favorite food item in general.  I had to up the amount of meat to a full 2# from the 1.5# called for in order to feed the 3 guys at the table.  I used the servings app on the right side to get the new ingredient amounts, which made the seasonings up to 5 Tbsp all together!  No. freaking. way.!  Suffice to say I used the spices called for in a total amount of 1 1/2 Tbsp.  I had to use Montreal Grill Seasoning instead of the garlic pepper since I didn't have that spice in my cabinet.  I did not add in any salt by itself.  I baked the loaf to an internal temperature of 140' as requested by husband.  It was plenty moist and flavorful.  Will use this as my primary meatloaf recipe from here on in since we look for ways to cut carbs these days.

Before eating low carb, we liked ketchup baked on top of our meatloaf so with this recipe I added another small can of tomato sauce that had been sweetened with a little stevia to the top before baking and it was delicious.

really good esp for keto. I don't like pork rinds, and my keto plan allows no nuts or carbs (no nut flours either), so I usually add finely chopped carrots, squeeze out moisture first!. I also add cumin and granulated garlic.

It was delicious, and I used 4% fat ground beef. 
It held together really well.
I eliminated the pork rinds since we don't care for them.

Made with bbq pork rinds and added green onion to the mix.  Layed flat and topped with shredded cheddar and rolled up.  It was so yummy!

I made this exactly as written and my wife and I could not eat it. There is way too much chili powder in it.

I really like the idea of using the pork rinds instead of breadcrumbs or crackers to make this low to no carbs. I was not impressed though. The meatloaf did not want to stay together and I think there was to much chili powder. My husband made the comment "meatloaf isn't suppose to taste or smell like chili". I agree. When we opened the left overs I really smelled the chili powder. I will make this again but less chili powder and maybe a higher fat content in the meat.

I made this for my husband, who is a ground beef lover, and he really enjoyed it! I substituted Panko for the pork rinds, as I didn't have them on hand, and it was still delicious. I had been looking for a good turkey meatloaf recipe, and I have found it here. It's stored in my favs! I would just warn folks to go light on the salt as it was saltier than I expected, and I'm one who almost always puts salt on food when at the table. Enjoy! Bon appetite!

This meatloaf is a great recipe and delicious! Switched out pork rinds for 3/4 cup steel cut oatmeal, added finely chopped onions and ketchup and brown sugar on top (last 5 mins). Paired it with sautéed bell peppers and onions. Great low carb meal!

This meatloaf is tasty and easy to prepare.  As with other reviews, the salt and chili powder are excessive.  Personally, I love salty dishes but this was too much even for me.  Somehow, I suspect the "tablespoon" could have been intended to be "teaspoon ".

I made it exactly by the recipe. No one in my family really liked it. Everyone said it had way too much chili powder in it and I totally agree. I think backing off on the chili powder would help it tremendously.

This is a pretty good recipe when you're trying to do a really low carb diet.  I personally like more stuff in my meatloaf, such as onions or mushrooms.  But this was good without.  The other reviewers complained about it being too salty, so I left out the garlic salt and used minced garlic, but it ended up needing salt.  I add green chile, which enhanced the flavor but you couldn't taste the green chile.  I'd definitely increase the amount next time.  I'll make it again.

It was good.  The pork rinds don't bind as well as bread crumbs would have.  I added rotel tomatoes to spice it up a bit.

We absolutely loved this meatloaf. I used a combination of the regular pork rinds and the barbecue hot pork rinds  and it gave it a little bit of a kick to it. Wonderful recipe

very good although I'd agree is a tad salty. added shredded cheddar and seemed to help. used 2 lbs meat for a larger loaf but increased the other ingredients as well. very good! definitely did not taste like boring old meat!

A bit too salty.  If made again I would use grated parmesan for the bonding agent to hold it together.

I thought it was really good.  The meatloaf wasn't salty , but it is unfortunate about the amount of sodium in pork skins so I might try and find a different alternative next time.  Otherwise it was fast, simple and delicious.

I do like this recipe, but did change somethings.  I didn't use the pork skin, because I didn't have any on hand.  Used reduce fat Ritz.  Used egg stubsitute for whole eggs.  Next time I will put more Ritz in, because it was too moist and not like a loaf.  Over all it was good.
