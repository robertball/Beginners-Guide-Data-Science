This pie will be great for the summer.  Very easy and yummy.  I used crushed pineapple in juice instead of syrup and added a litte bit more sugar and it worked out just fine.

I found this pie to be excellent.  I doubled the receipe, used fresh squoze lemon juice, extra large eggs, and a 20oz can of Libbys Pineapple sweetened with Splenda (I had that for some reason) I took the extra pineapple to equal the receipe and reserved it for a grilled mahi mahi with fresh ginger root, lemon,,,etc.  Made Ina Gartens Perfect Pie Crust in the food processor and this was a truly inspiring dish that I will make again!

I followed the recipe except did not add any milk.  My 8 oz can of crushed pineapple was in juice rather than heavy syrup and measured exactly one cup, eliminating the need to add "enough milk to make 3/4 cup".  I used a pre-made refrigerated pie crust rolled out to a a little thinner consistency.  The pie was easy to make, light and very good.
