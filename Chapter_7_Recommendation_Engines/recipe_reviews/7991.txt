I wanted a very "whipped cream" type of chocolate frosting and this was the closest I could find. I followed the recipe with some exceptions. Instead of 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream. (I'd bought a pint and didn't want it to go to waste, so I figured it couldn't hurt.) Then, once the beaten whipped cream had been folded into the mixture, I didn't think the frosting was fluffy enough for what I wanted. I also could still detect some grittiness from the pudding mix even though I beat it with an electric hand mixer for quite a while. So I took the remainder of my pint of whipping cream and beat that up and folded it in too. The texture came out exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to spread immediately. The texture is light and the flavor is chocolatey with just enough richness.

Simply "dreamy"... light, fluffy, creamy, and satiny looking. Not too sweet with a pudding flavor. Delicious! Want to avoid the fat content in the recipe? Here's how you do it: Purchase fat-free condensed milk and, in place of the heavy cream, use one 12 fl. oz. can of fat-free evaporated milk. Omit the water in the recipe. Chill the evaporated milk in its own can (do not open it yet) to the point of it almost starting to freeze. Poor the chilled milk in a blender cup and whip until it triples in volume. Add it to the thick frosting base and mix slowly in a folding motion until well combined. Let it sit still for a few minutes to thicken before you start frosting your cake. Frosting made with evaporated milk will be very soft. Drop it by dollops on the top of your cake and near the top edges. It will slowly spread on its own and, with your guidance, it will smoothly slide down the sides of the cake, forming a thick layer as it goes down on its own. If this type of consistency is a bit too thin to your liking, put the frosting in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to 1 hour before you spread it on your cake. Chill frosted cake for several hours prior to serving so the frosting can set. The frosting has a nice satiny look, which makes the cake look even yummier.

Fantastic recipe. This is not like any frosting I have ever made. Here's a great thing to try: instead of 1/2 cup of water, add 1/2 cup of coffee liquer (such as Kahlua or Starbuck's). This give the frosting a great mocha flavor!

Not really a frosting as its name suggests, but quite good on icecream. Its more like a fudge sause than a frosting. The texture is like a glaze. I tried it on angel food cake and it was delicious. I wouldn't reccommend it on a layor cake though.

I guarantee the reviews that say this recipe is "runny," "too sweet," "like a chocolate sauce," and "milky" made a mistake.  I would bet they didn't whip the cream, and instead thought "1 cup heavy cream, whipped" meant "1 cup whipping cream."  If you whip the cream like the recipe calls for, this recipe is ANYTHING but runny or too sweet.  It's smooth, light, and just right.  Just MAKE SURE YOU WHIP THE CREAM WELL with an electric mixer!

OUTSTANDING! This frosting is a winner because it's not too sweet and has great flavor & texture. TIP: When whipping heavy cream, shake well first and use a CHILLED bowl. I also doubled the amount of unsweetened chocolate and used chocolate-fudge pudding. This frosting is not as "pretty" as the store-bought kind (which uses additives to make it glossy), but it wins hands-down in taste!

This was very good.  Easy to make and went great on the yellow cake I made for a birthday party.  So easy to spread.  Not real sweet, and definately has a chocolate pudding flavor.

This is the best chocholate frosting recipe i've ever made. It's so creamy and works great with a ganache.  I do add another square of chocolate for a bit more consistancy. Also refridgerate for at least an hour before spreading onto cake.

The "frosting" had a good flavor but it was not the texture of frosting at all. I could not get it to stick to the cupcakes. I instead spooned it into a graham cracker crust and topped with cool whip and walnuts! It was a hit after my changes!

I have never made frosting before and this was SO easy and probably the best I have ever tasted!  I wanted to eat the whole thing and not even frost my cupcakes with it.  In some of the reviews people said it was too runny, so I wanted to make it clear that you need to WHIP the cream until it's "whipped cream," and then fold it in.   It took a while by hand but MAN was it worth it!  I frosted banana cupcakes with it and made monkeys--a hit!

I'm being forced to give a rating of 1 star(minus 5 stars more like it). I wasted sooo much time AND money making this. I should have listened to others reviewers about the clumps from the pudding mix. I can follow any basic recipe and this one was not to my liking.

This recipe was time consuming to make and the colour was milky.  It was very sweet and in the end, I didn't use it.  The cake turned out great and it seemed a waste to ruin it with this frosting.  Expensive and didn't use it anyway.

This frosting tastes great, but it is not a pretty frosting.  It's light brown in color and of course needs cooling to keep.

I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but the pudding ended up forming little balls in the frosting.  We used it anyway, and it wasn't too bad, but I'm glad the queen wasn't coming for tea.  I don't think I'll try this one again.  Even if it had come out smooth I would have found it too sweet.

Wow...super easy and to me what chocolate frosting should all be like. Served it at a dinner party and everyone said they loved the frosting on the cake! I wanted a rich chocolate so I double the chocolate and added more whipped topping (actually using the kind of whipped topping in the bottle as that was all I had on hand) and I also added one more small package of instant chocolate pudding mix that I had on hand (and it was a sugar free one) and I ended up with a GREAT frosting and it was easy to work when frosting the cake. I just added more water I needed to get it more spreadable. I will surely keep this recipe!

This was ok....I thought it was interesting, so I had to try it. I think if I would have whipped the heavy cream more, it might have been siffer. But the pudding clumped here and there, and it took a bit of extra time to remove or dissolve the clumps. It had an interesting chocolate taste between the pudding mix and the condensed milk, it was alright, but wasn't great. But having used it for cupcakes, it did just fine. I wouldn't frost a whole cake with it.

This frosting is awesome.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used the cream in place of the water in the recipe.  Turned out tasting truffle-like without a real heavy chocolate taste.

I used this frosting with the "buttermilk chocolate cake", thats on this site. I wanted a whipped frosting instead of a fudge frosting.  The frosting was delicious!  I wind up using almost a pint of whipping cream so I could get the consistency I wanted.  Also after I folded the whipping cream in I beat the frosting until light and fluffy.  I didn't frost the cake immediately like the recipe states.  I put it in the fridge for about 30 to 45 min. prior to frosting.  I made a double layer cake, so in between the layers I made a cream cheese frosting and beat the rest of the whipping cream ( about a 1/2 cup was left) in with the cream cheese mixture for a filling.  The cake just melts in your mouth!!!!

This recipe goes amazingly well with desserts that are already sweet, but need an extra touch.  It is especially good in chocolate eclairs, because it won't overpower the filling.

Delicious!  I used this frosting on chocolate cream filled cupcakes the 1st time I made it and on the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake from this site the 2nd time.  It's absolutely great tasting because its not too sweet.  The 1st time I made it the frosting was runny.  The 2nd time I made it I realized that it was runny the 1st time because I didn't whip the whippping cream first.

This frosting tastes great but I disagree with the directions.  If you frost the cooled cake as soon as the frosting is done the frosting is way too runny.  I put the frosting in the fridge and tried a little later with a lot more success.  The flavour is excellent.  Just like chocolate pudding!

Total failure . Came out like soup. Will never be frosting. What a waste of cream and money. Followed directions to a T.

This is such a light and creamy frosting!  I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so I substituted 1 Tbsp of cocoa powder and it turned out perfect.  I didn't have any problems with lumpy or gritty texture.  It was smooth and creamy and easy to spread.  This is definitely going to be my go to frosting.  I'm thinking I might try it with different flavored pudding mixes...

Perfect as is! This is my go to recipe and I love it! Fluffy and light but flavorful and not too sweet.

absolutely wonderful. I used 3 squares of chocolate and 1 package of white chocolate pudding.  Made a very large amount of frosting. Enough for 2 9X12 cakes.  So much better than canned frosting, and almost as easy.

I was very sceptical of this 'pudding icing', but I made it just minutes ago, and I can tell you, it was just plain YUM!! Its silky smooth and just glossy enough, and this taste is simply wonderful- neither too sweet nor too chocolatey. Thank you so much for this one!

First the color - mine did not come out anything close to as dark as the picture - not a big deal, except it blew my plan to pair it with a light brown sugar frosting for decorating and as a different flavor/color in the middle.  I'm also a bit of a purist and like to make things from scratch precisely because I don't like processed foods.  I took a chance with this one based on the reviews, but I honestly find the flavor of the pudding distracting.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

This is the best frosting that I have ever made.I chilled it for 45 minutes like other reviews suggested before spreading.I did add 1 extra oz of chocolate, I also added 1 pkg of cream cheese at the end. I beat it until all the lumps were gone. It turned out great!

Very yummy recipe.  I made this with white chocolate and vanilla pudding mix, and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour before icing my cake.  By the time I used it, the pudding mix had set and wasn't at all gritty.  I'll definitely make this again!

Really good. I made it even simpler though by meling the choc by it's self. Then, in my mix master I combined the pudding mix, 2 cups of whipping cream, and melted cooled choc. till fluffy. So easy, and really good too!
