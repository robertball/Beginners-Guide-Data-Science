The taste was ok, but the method has several problems with it.. first, just just soy sauce for seasoning is going to result in a very bland dish. I added some salt and red chillie flakes to the eggs. second, using 8 egg whites will result in a rather crisp sort of frittata which I didn't fancy so I used 8 whole eggs instead of 4 eggs and 8 egg whites. Third, the cooking time is way off... 8-10 minutes on medium flame will result in a well burned bottom. I cooked on the stove about 5 minutes but it still burned pretty badly, which is why I had to top with cheese to mask the burnt flavor that came through even after cutting a layer off. so overall, it's ok, but I dont think I will try this again...

This was a lot... crunchier than I expected; while the taste wasn't bad, I didn't enjoy the texture. Unless I followed the recipe incorrectly, it seems that the meal tastes more like a lumpy thrown-together concoction.   Since that is my only complaint, and the actual taste wasn't so bad, I don't think it was completely negative; it's just that the texture threw it off for me.

My parents liked this, but I however was not a fan. Something about having an asian inspired breakfast just didn't work for me, I like to stick to my classics. Not to mention all the prep work and making it just wasn't wort it...sorry!
