My first review on this site and after being a visitor for over a year. This recipes warrants it. Just served this over Xmas and the family raved!! My suggestions....use the carbonated water in the recipe for the ice cubes. I decorated my cubes with thin lime slices and mint leaves. Made 2 trays of cubes and put one in each globlet I served. It fizzed immediately in the glass to the "oohs" and "ahhhs" of guests. My wine was a $10 bottle of reisling, not great solo, but in the punch it was perfect. I also used inexpensive champagne called Seaview (from Australia) at $10 a bottle. This champagne was rated above Moet & Chandon's White Star in a recent review and was perfect for the punch. A beautiful recipe all around. Thanks!

Wonderful!  Served this at a bridal shower and it was a big hit.  Only used one bottle of champagne so it wouldn't be so potent :)  It turned out great.  I made an ice ring with lemons and mint and it looked lovely.  Thanks!

Classic party punch recipe.  DEFINETLY consider doubling the recipe, this stuff goes down really easily.  I stretched the second batch further by using an extra can of cranberry concentrate and an extra bottle of champaign.  I used a white riesling wine to offset the sour flavors of the citrus juices and it worked great.  I wouldn't waste money on expensive alcohol; the cheap stuff doesn't taste nasty when mixed with the juice concentrate.  I would serve this again without a doubt.

I served this at my son's Baptism brunch and the whole family loved it. I made an ice ring with cherries in it for decoration and to keep it cold. I also only used 1 bottle of champagne and just added some Sprite instead.

"Oh My Gawd, this was the best ******* punch we ever tasted".  
Directly quoted from Carolyn, Susan, Rita, Cheryl, Sandi and Debbie.  We all enjoyed this punch.  We give it 6 thumbs up.
People say to double the recipe, we say TRIPLE it!!!  If you drink it at an afternoon party, try to make sure you get the rest of the day off work, it is really tough going back to work when all you can think about is drinking more of this special tasty treat!

I don't like sweet punches so this was great. The guests all raved about it and I should have double the batch to make more. I doubled the wine and eliminated the club soda and it was wonderful

I made this for a bridal shower I was hosting and EVERYONE raved!! In fact, there was a variety of drinks available including mimosas and this drink was the most sought after. I took note of the other reviews posted and used a bottle of Riesling for the white wine and instead of cranberry frozen concentrate, I used a can of White Grape & Raspberry concentrate. I kept everything else as listed in the ingredients list. You won't need the suggested half cup of sugar if you go with a Riesling but you will if you use a regular white wine. I stuck with club soda instead of gingerale and it was perfect!! You will definitely have many people asking for the recipe!!!!!!!!!! P.S.-- make sure the concentrates are completely thawed prior to mixing.

Wow! I made this for a friend's baby shower and it was wonderful.  Everybody loved it - even though I doubled the recipe, we ran out because people went so wild over it.  I made an ice ring with lemon slices and fresh mint to go with it.

This is a really good punch!  Its strong and tasty!  I used a cheap riesling and cheap champagne and it was sooooo good.  FYI I made it for a bridal shower of 30 people, I got enough to make it 3 times and we ran out half way through the shower and everyone was asking for more!  next time I would probably get enough to make it 5 times.  Oh and if you double the recipe it fits into a punch bowl perfectly! There was even enough room for an ice block!  Hope this helps!

....Pretty Good but, instead of the lime slices, I used orange slices, and I used pineapple juice concentrate, not limeade.  I also added half a bottle of Vodka.  I didnt use the mint garnish because, by the time I drank HALF the punch, I really didnt care....... but, it was tasty. The next morning, I used 2 asprin and 3 Alkaseltzer and stayed in bed all day..... and I'm not exaggerating.

Loved this punch!  Made this exactly as stated (except subbed limes for garnish instead of lemons, since that's what I had on hand) for Christmas, along with an ice ring made by freezing cranberries, a few mint leaves, and lime slices in a bundt cake pan.  My grandmother had about 3 glasses, and was happier than I've ever seen her before.  =)  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

Good stuff and very refreshing!  I made it for a baby shower with an ice ring.  Makes a very pretty pinkish color.  A bit tart for my taste with all the lemonade, limeade, etc. but still good.  I'm sure it could be sweetened up with frozen CranRasberry or gingerale instead of seltzer for those who like a sweeter taste.

This was a great drink. I'm 14 and my mom made it for company. She only put the alcohol in one and I loved the non-alcoholic version. Everyone else must have, too, because both bowls were gone within about 15 minutes! Great flavour

I made this punch for a holiday party and it was fabulous.  Everybody raved over it and finished the whole batch within the first recipe, so my only advise it double the recipe.

Yum! To counter the tartness just a bit, we poured in a 20oz bottle of Sprite. Our party needed this a little stronger, so we added about 3/4 cup vodka and 3/4 cup UV cherry vodka (the UV brand is red and has a lower alcohol content). I made ice cubes out of the soda water instead of pouring it into the glasses. Oddly enough, they did not fizz up, but it was still cute since I'd put a small piece of lime in each one. An important note, even with the vodka added, it didn't taste strong at all, but it definitely packed a punch after we'd drank it down. Hmm, must be why they call it that. :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Next time I will use a drier wine and/or champage, because it was just a bit too sweet.  Also, I made an ice ring in my bundt pan (filled only about 1/4 of the way) and added cranberries and mint leaves, and that looked beautiful in the punch bowl.  I also put some cranberries on toothpicks, and then froze them.  Then everyone got a cranberry stick in their glass, which looked really pretty.   This punch looks and tastes impressive, and I will definitely make it again.  And because it uses frozen concentrates, you can keep the ingredients on hand if you need to bring something to an event at the last minute.

I made this for a candle party I hosted at 2:00 pm. I only used one bottle of champagne and it was wonderful for an afternoon party. Thanks so much. I will be making this for Christmas and will definately add both bottles for that party.

This was a huge hit at our Christmas party this year. I ended up using 2 liters of carbonated water and 12 oz of limeade just to make it go farther, but it still tasted great. We floated cranberries and lime slices in it, and it was very pretty.

Great punch!  I served at a bridal shower for about 20 guests & everyone LOVED it.  Not too sweet at all.  I'm sure it depends on the kind of wine/champagne you use as well since some are sweeter than others.  I used Riesling wine and Cook's Grand Reserve Brut (only about $6-7/bottle) for the champagne.  This is a keeper!

This was way too sweet and had too much of a citrus taste.  I even substituted a bottle of white wine for the carbonated soda and it still was not good.  If I make this again, I will not use the lemonade and limeade concentrates.  I will probably double the cranberry concentrate or even use grape juice concentrate.

Crazy addicting! I forgot the carbonated water, but it was still delicious and a huge hit at my holiday party. However, because I used an ice ring (by filling half an angel food cake pan with water/fruit slices and freezing it), I'm not sure the extra liquid would have fit in the punch bowl anyway.  My party guests drank the punch so fast that the ice ring had barely melted before the bowl was empty! I wish I'd bought enough ingredients to double the recipe. Everyone was talking about it the next day.

Excellent recipe - used it for a bridal shower and everyone loved it.  I agree that you should add extra carbonated water to keep it lighter.  Very pretty color, nice flavor, and not too sweet!

Made for New Year's Eve party.  Everyone loved it, even the guys.  Couldn't find Frozen Cranberry Concentrate, so I used White Grape Juice and then added about a cup or so of Cranberry juice to give it a nice pink color.

I have made this punch going on five years now for my christmas party... and it never gets old! Forget about doubling the batch, you may want to triple or quadruple it! Goes great in a punch bowl with an ice ring or in a glass container with a spigot.

I just made this for a Memorial Day BBQ.  The punch is slightly tart but overall very good.  I made the punch as is, but I did freeze about 5 cups of Sprite in a plastic container and then added it to the chilled punch to keep it cold during the party.  I plan to make this again for a baby shower.  By the way, using a cheaper champagne is okay, the other flavors create a nice balance.

this was way too sweet. i made a double batch thinking it would be great based on the reviews, but the frozen concentrates are just way too sweet. i probably should've used the amount of concentrate for a single batch and doubled up the champagne, wine, and everything else.

Served this punch for our New Year's Eve party and it was a hit! The only ingredient changed was instead of using frozen limeade I used about 1 litre of Sprite-that's it. It was delicious! Not too sweet, just enough fizz, and it practically filled my punch bowl! It was literally gone in less than an hour. Definitely making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Made this fir new years eve. Ended up making three batches for ten adults. If you are having a long party, be sure and have enough for at least a double batch. Made an ice ring with Sprite. Everyone loved this, even the guys.

Oh yeah!  This is what I'm talking about.  I made this for my daughter's engagement party.  Boy howdy, I should have prepared a double or triple dose, as others who have reviewed have suggested.  It didn't pack a huge wallop but it is definitely mellowing.  It was perfect for the occasion.  I used Martini and Rossi Asti Spumanti  and a bottle of Pinot Grigio, neither very expensive.  Yummy, yummy stuff!  I'm sending this recipe to several friends!

This punch was a total hit.  We served it for a Valentine's Day event of about 100 people:  we multiplied the recipe 5 times and had lots of other drinks available, and we still ran out.  I used frozen raspberries for garnish--they also help to keep the punch cold.  I found a $4 Piesporter at Trader Joe's and used that for the white wine--perfect--and used inexpensive Tosti champagne (about $6 at Costco).

I used this recipe for the first time for a large gathering of about 75 people.  It was a risk to use a new recipe for such a big event, but it was a big hit!  I got tons of compliments on it.  Because I was trying to stretch the recipe, I doubled all the ingredients, and added additional sparkling water to taste.  Great recipe!

Very good. I halved the recipe and had to use refrigerated limeade as my grocer did not have frozen. Very tasty, but a little tart which can be toned down with the club soda.

Made this for New Years Eve and it was the main drink by everyone. Its so nice that one can use less expensive champagne and wine. Could not find frozen cranberry concentrate so used cranberry juice. Was a little tart for our taste so we added some Mango juice that we had and it countered the tart perfectly. This is one of those recipes that you basically can adjust at the end with sweet/tart/etc to suit your taste.

This punch was a hit at my last party; however, its just a bit too sweet for my taste.  I may add more club soda and maybe a little lemon juice or unsweetened cranberry juice to git it more "punch" next time.

This punch was delicious!  Used $5 bottles of Spumante and a $6 bottle of Riesling. I made an ice ring out of the carbonated water and left out the mint. Served at a wedding shower consisting of about 15 guests. There was none left over at the end of the shower. Thanks for the recipe, will be making this one again and again!

very very yummy... i added strawberrys instead of a citrus fruit to make the taste sweeter as other reviewers stated it was very tart.  Also, I was suprised at how potent it was... didnt expect that at all as other reviewers didnt seem to notice... but i did!  All in all it goes down wonderfully and was a hit!

I made this for Christmas. It was too tart and much too acid, lemonade, limeade, cranberry was not a good flavor combination for us. Our stomachs were too upset to eat dinner. I should have known better when I read the ingredients but with all the good reviews I thought I would try it. Shame on me!

This is a great champagne punch - I served it for a bridal shower and everyone loved it! I had 20 guests, so next time I will definitely double the recipe and add some fresh fruit to pretty it up. Excellent and potent!

Delish. I am now asked to make this punch at every party I go to. For a virgin version, use white grape juice instead of white wine and sparkling cider instead of champagne.

Mmmm!  I love this punch.  I have served it at several showers and it is always a hit.  Very refreshing and light.  Looks pretty and tastes delicious.  Much better than the sherbet punch.  I always use riesling, dry champagne and club soda.  Highly recommend this for any party!

I've made this recipe at two showers and it was a hit!  Always make a double batch if you're making it for more than 10 people.  As others said, I used Reisling for the wine and used ginger ale instead of carbonated water.  It was great--not too sweet, not too sour.  I'm making it again this weekend using a Gewurztraminer, so I might use 12 oz. of limeade to balance out the sweetness of the wine.

I made this for my Mom's 60th birthday party and it went fast!  The only thing I changed was I used ginger ale instead of carbonated water.  I've given out this recipe and it was recently used at a bridal shower!  I will definitely make this one again!

This is really good! Pretty color. A good way to use some white wine we bought but didn't like too much.  This is a good punch for those who don't want a hard liquor punch.

wonderful! So refreshing, almost like sangria! Made the whole recipe and WAY too much for 8 adults, but also served beer and wine.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I used lime slices instead of lemon and did not add the mint leaves.  I used Sprite ice cubes instead of the ice ring.  My friends all LOVED it and the 7 of us had no problem finishing it off - they all asked for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing!! I just made it last night for a Christmas party for my friends. I thought that it would be a girly drink but I think that the guys drank it just as much if not more than that girls. I tried to explain that I had beer for them but they weren't having it!! So true about needing to make an additional batch. I didn't take heed to the reviews so my fiance had to go out and get more!! Definitely will do this again!!

I'm not a big fan of overly sweet drinks so this was perfect.  I skipped the bottle of white wine (I made this for an office party and didn't want people to get hootched unexpectedly -- sometimes punches pack a wollop!) and used club soda.  I floated frozen cranberries on top (and a sprig of mint would've been pretty if I'd had one). I'll absolutely make this again.

Love this recipe!  The lemons/limes/mint add color and make the punch more inviting so make sure you get something to float on top.

I made this for our New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit. I made three batches, one with the cranberry, one with fruit punch and one with fruit punch and apple juice and they all went pretty well. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks for this new new years tradition.

Got RAVE reviews at my New Year's Eve party.  Everyone just LOVED it!!!  Added lemon slices and frozen raspberries.  Would definitely do again.  Used Bellatore ($6.99/bottle) Gran Spumante champagne, and a cheap white wine.  Cheap is not bad in this punch.  You can't tell!!  Be careful where you put this though, it's quite red (beautiful), but can stain and is sticky.

I used this recipe at a mid-day party I had yesterday - the only thing I did differently was to a small package of frozen mixed berries when it came time to serve it. I didn't have lemon or mint so that didn't get added. Overall, everyone seemed to really like it! Thanks!

This was a huge hit at my book club holiday party.  I made an ice wreath in my silicon bundt pan (easy to release), using mint leaves and raspberries in lemonade and gingerale, freezing in layers to keep stuff from floating.  It really dressed it up--but the punch was delicious anyway!

Sooo delicious.  I used ginger ale instead of club soda and it tasted delicious.  Some of the people I served it to found it a bit acidic (and some a bit too fruity sweet after several glasses), but I loved it.  Even those that could only drink a couple of glasses loved the taste, just not in huge amounts.

I made this for a fashion show last night. I didn't garnish with lemons, only fresh mint. Even though I doubled the recipe, it didn't last long. Everyone LOVED it! I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe. It is perfect if you don't want to drink had alcohol but you still want to serve something light and boozy. YUM!

We served this punch at our annual Christmas party for 75.  It was a hit!  We had to make three batches.  Guests were offered punch served on a tray and passed by waitstaff.  What a nice way to greet holiday guests!

I served this with rasberry lemonade concentrate and added frozen rasberries with mint leaves as floaters. I also used reisling for the white wine which made it a little sweeter. It was not a sweet punch just perfect!

Wonderful recipe, big hit!  I used passion fruit concentrate (the one in the plastic can that you are able to microwave if you needed to thaw...) instead of craberry juice.  To make ice cubes, I bought some of those new silicone muffin holders in heart shapes, and frozes bits of frozen berry mix or limes into the hearts.  I only used 1/3 bottle of seltzer per bowl.  I floated the frozen berries and lemon and lime slices in the bowl, with the heart shaped ice it was beautiful.  Everyone loved the punch, and two bowls disappeared in about an hour!

This was AWESOME.  I used a riesling and brute champange. Next time I might use a little less champange, it was strong.  I garnished with the lemon and frozen raspberrys. It was beautful. Lots of recipes request and request to make it for the next function already.

I made this for a party and it was gone in a half an hour. Everybody loved it, including my mother who is not a drinker! This was great- I would even do a non-alcoholic version for a kids party!

Made the punch for a New Years Day drop-in.  Had other beverages available, but everyone went after this one.  Made an ice ring with carbonated water, raspberries and lime slices.  Will definetly make again when having the next holdiay party.

This punch was an absolute success at my wedding reception!  I used Strawberry Zinfendel for the champagne and regular Ginger Ale.  I also added frozen raspberries into the mix.  The guests enjoyed the punch and I overheard a lot of comment.  They also very much liked the raspberry addition.  A friend, who never consumes alcoholic drinks because of the strong alcohol taste was taking these back all evening and was quite tipsy at the end of the night.  I will definately make this again.

This looks like an awesome recipe!  I haven't tried it yet, but when I do, I would like to have an idea how many a batch REALLY serves when people keep coming back, eventually licking the bowl!!!  Therefore, it would be extremely helpful, if you could note how many people were at your event, and how long the punch lasted!  Thanks so much!

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it! It was a big hit on New Years Eve. Someone recommended using a Riesling wine to give it some sweetness. I couldn't find Riesling and used a Pinot Grigio and found it to be perfect.

This was a very good punch. The Luscious Slush Punch on this site is still my favorite, and you can add alcohol to suit your taste. This recipe makes a lot, but it goes down pretty easy. Even so, it makes plenty for about 10-12 people. I wouldn't double unless you were have more guests than that.

I needed a champagne punch for a church brunch and this was quick and super easy. I couldn't find frozen cranberry concentrate so used juice and a little less seltzer. Also made an ice ring out of cranberry juice, lemons, raspberries and mint leaves. Was a huge hit. Made a double batch and it was all gone. This is definitely a keeper.

I served this recipe exactly as written for a Christmas party last weekend, and got raves from everyone who had some (including myself!!)  I used Reisling for the wine, and an $8 bottle of champagne.  This one's a keeper.  Thank you for submitting such a good one!!

My husband and I brought this for a pot luck along with Kerri's Holiday Punch, also from this website.  We both thought this one was good, but liked Kerri's better.  However, we doubled this one and did not double Kerri's, but this one even doubled was gone first with everyone raving about it.  Therefore, have to give it 5 stars.

This was awesome, as all the reviews said! We had it for a holiday party, and everyone loved it. Even the guys. We had to use cranberry apple juice instead of just cranberry because that's all they had at the store, and it still tasted great.

WOW!  This is fantastic!!! So light and tasty, it really doesn't taste like there is any alcohol at all.  A friend made this for a baby shower and I could have drank the entire bowl!   I can't wait to make this for another event. I think it would be perfect for a bridal shower or any brunch/lunch event.  Fantastic! Thank you for posting!!

Yummm! I make lemonade ice cubes with pieces of lime and mint for decoration and to keep it cold.  I've made this for a homecoming party and I intend on using it again for a baby shower and probably a christmas party.  Doubling is a must for any occasion!

This punch was incredible! It was so refreshing and tasted more like a spritzer. Super easy to make! It was the first thing gone at a bachelorette party I threw.  I made orange juice ice cubes and garnished the punch with sliced lemons, limes and oranges. Big hit!

Absolutely delicious exactly as written.  Can also sub a can of mojito concentrate instead of lime juice.  I thought there was NO WAY we would need to double the recipe even after reading all the other reviews (we only had about 20 people, several pregnant and not drinking at this party), but the punch was gone in an hour and everyone was disappointed I didn't have more.

This is a great punch recipe. The store had ran out of limeade concentrate so I used 12 oz White Grape juice concentrate instead and it was perfect! That may solve the issue some people had with acidity. I know I wouldn't try it any other way.

I made this punch for our early Christmas party with my family, we LOVED it.  I will be making again for New Years Eve.  The only change I made was I used 12 oz frozen limeade because I couldn't find a 6 oz.

Made this for my sisters bridal shower and my mom loved it so much she served it at the reception (a non alcholic version works well too with ginerale and club soda).  I garnished the puch with limes, mint, and cranberries frozen in a heart shaped ice mold.  Very tasty and easy!

I've made this punch several times now and it is always a hit. Each time there is at least one person that asks for the recipe.

At my last party I had someone fill up a water bottle with the punch so they could take it home for their husband to try-it's that good!!

Delicious! I made this for a going away party in late August. No leftovers and even my brother's beer-drinking friends had seconds lol. So many compliments, refreshing and strong enough to get the party going. I would definitely make again - I used an inexpensive bottle of pinot grigio and some champagne we had in the house - nothing too fancy. I couldn't find frozen cranberry concentrate so I used regular cranberry juice instead and it worked just fine.

Agreed, definitely worth doubling... it goes quickly.  This is a great punch!  We've made it for 4-5 events. Even if you use poor "champagne" it still turns out deliciously.  It's either this recipe or another non-alcoholic (or both) that we serve at parties.

Made this for my 2008 champagne party.  Might want to go with a low pulp lemonade... the pulp stuck to the bottom of the flutes.
Also made it for Christmas... very tasty!

I made this last night or our New Years Eve party and it was a big hit.  I made a few changes that I don't think I will do again since it made it really almost to sweet.  I used Arbor Mist wine and 7-up but even the guys were liking it.  I will make this again!

Excellent punch used for a wedding shower.  A hit with everyone.  This was NOT TOO SWEET and I was really worried it would be sweet.  I just used cheap $6 a bottle champagne and only made 1/2 the recipe...  ended up making the other half of the recipe since it was gone so fast!

I made this punch for a New Years gathering and it was a big hit - especially for those who prefer not to taste the alcohol. It tasted like spiked kool-aid with pizzazz! Wouldn't call this a classy fine cocktail but it served its purpose for me perfectly. Served out of wine glasses made it seem more special.

I made this for a housewarming and it was a big hit.  As others had suggested I used frozen fruit and I don't think I used the full amt of frozen juice because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  This would be great in the summer.  I will definately make this again.

Way too mcuh corn syrup in these ingredients.  I made this according to recipe and I found it to be too sweet and too syrupy.  Had a lot left over, and with such expensive ingredients I decided to freeze it into ice cubes.  Don't know how I will use it in the future.  Maybe with cold sparkling waters.

I made this punch for my friend Susu's New Year's Eve Party in New York.   I used three bottles of bubbly rather than two, made sure the white wine was a reisling and i also added about 1/4 cup of superfine sugar as my tasters found the punch to be intially a little bitter.   Everyone loved the punch without exception.   After three glasses of it I was flying and the green and red illuminated Empire State Building looming out of the  living room window nicely complemented this luscious and sassy punch.  Well done Debbie!

I've made this recipe now for the last 6 or 7 years and finally decided to leave a review. It's the perfect recipe for a holiday party because you can put it in a 2 gallon dispenser (double the recipe). It looks pretty and tastes great. Use a Riesling for the white wine, club soda for the water and an inexpensive champagne. Let the frozen lemonade and limeade thaw out. Top it w/ frozen cranberries and the crowd loves it. Not overly sweet which makes everyone happy because I am not a sweet drink kind of person. The club soda and champagne balances out the concentrated juice.

I had another champagne punch recipe very similar to this that I wish I would have made for my party. This recipe wasn't as sweet as I hoped. I even added in some lemon/lime soda for added sweetness. It was still slightly bitter. I doubt I would make it again only because I have the other recipe I like better.

This punch was very sour! I made it for a New Year's Eve party. I brought enough to make more after reading the other reviews but we never finished the first batch.

Was not impressed. To bitter and tart for my taste. I like a sweeter, fruitier punch.

Let's put it this way: at my recent party, I made this punch and one of my guests, when faced with the very last drops left, picked up my punchbowl and poured the 1/2 cup of dregs into a cup and drank it. Every last drop was consumed. It was gone within an hour of putting it out! I'll definitely make it again. Thank you!

Oh my gosh, this punch is sooo good !! If I were stranded on a deserted island with just one food choice, it would be this punch !!  I served it at a bridal shower and the girls loved it so much they practically licked the bowl clean!  I plan on serving it during Thanksgiving brunch; I can't wait until Grandma Faye gets 2 glasses in her system.  Cheers!

I made this for a bridal shower and thought it was great.  I followed some suggestions here and used only one bottle of champagne and doubled the seltzer water.  Next time -- and there will certainly be a next time -- I'll add all of the champagne (mine could have used a bit more kick) but still double the seltzer.  I put the mint leaves and lemon slices in an ice ring.

Wonderful recipe for a bridal shower.  My friends and I loved it.  We had people from age 23-53 -- everyone enjoyed it.  I had to run out halfway thru to get more champagne for the second batch.  I used a Reisling (as someone earlier had suggested) and Korbel Brut.  I also made heart shaped ice cubes for the occasion.  Great!!!

I served this at a bridal shower and it was not good. I had to add sugar because it was not sweet and some Sprite which made it tolerable but I was embarrassed about a punch that had such high ratings!!What a disappointment!!

I have made this punch more times than I can count. everyone loves it!! it goes down so smooth so silliness may ensue. I have used every type of juice concentrate, I make it for graduations so I go more for color. Have also used all different types of fruit for the ring and it always turns out great!!

Classic party punch and thankfully not too sweet. Have made it twice now, once in traditional punch bowl and once in a drink dispenser. Will say that next time, I won't use the cranberries in the traditional punch bowl, as they were pesky for guests to ladle around. Will continue to use them in the drink dispenser though since they float at the top and look pretty! Both times, the punch was all gone at end of night.

This was good. Followed exactly and it def had the champagne taste. It was sweet though and we couldn't finish it nor could we get a buzz of it. Prob won't make again unless I halve it.

I have made this recipe 3 times and each time it has been a huge hit!  I can never find frozen cranberry, so I just use cranberry juice. I also use a Sauv Blanc so it's not too sweet, and use lemon-lime seltzer to add a refreshing taste.  Absolutely delicious!

I made this for New Years. I loved it! I found it to be a little bitter, but I like that. I used 1 bottle of champagne and 1 small sample size of Barefoot Moscato, and I didnt have mint, but evrything else was the same, and I'll make this again!

This is very good. I made it yesterday for Christmas. I couldn't find cranberry concentrate, so I used a little bottle of cranberry  
juice.  I made a club soda ice ring with maraschino cherries and lemons in it. Will definitely make this again.

Great punch! I did triple the recipe to serve 90. the color was a beautiful red. I put out 2 large punch bowls and by the end of the night the only thing left was the ice ring! I would definitely make it for my next function.

This punch is absolutely fabulous. It has become a staple for parties now. As advertised, it is sweet, tart, refreshing. Absolutely delicious. This recipe is very forgiving with measurements so you can add as much or as little of some of the ingredients as you want to suit your tastes. So I think we ended using more of the wine and champagne than the recipe called for just to balance out the intense sweetness of the concentrated juices. This makes a lot so it's perfect for large parties. The mixture also keeps well in a pitcher overnight, in case you have some left over.

Really well balanced, not too sweet. Made it for a HS Reunion of about 80 people, mixed up 3 batches, really good.
I didnt use the carbonated water, and used about half a bottle of Sprite per batch. If it's too sweet, you may need to use a dryer champagne. I used Brut in the first batch, Spomante in the 2nd and 3rd

I'm making this for Thanksgiving this year but i had a difficult time finding frozen cranberry juice concentrate.  Not really sure what to do about it, I read some other reviews and they said to use Grape Juice Concentrate will see how this works out.  I cut some lemon and placed it on the bottom of my bundt pan with some cranberries and some mint leaves and poured some sprite over it and placed in the freezer this will be for ice ring.  I will write again once I taste it.

Loved it!!  The 40 guests loved it.  Be prepared with ingredients on hand to make a second batch!  We used club soda for the carbonated water and had a decorative ice ring, but the ice didn't get a chance to melt.

This is a great drink for a large group. Just made it last night for my Ladies Game Night and it was a big hit. I doubled the recipe and have enough left over to share with my neighbors tonight!!

EVERYONE loved this punch!  I got so many requests for the recipe.  Plan on making a second batch.  Was out of white wine for the third batch so I substituted another bottle of champagne and it still tasted great.

Love this version of the champagne punch. It's just the right amount of sweet and citrus flavor is refreshing.

Delicious.  Perfect combination of flavors; not cloyingly sweet.  To look festive we froze maraschino cherries in a ring: drained the cherries and added water to a bundt pan and put it in the freezer for a few hours before serving the punch. Served it to my daughter's bridesmaids as they got ready at the house.  Everyone loved it!  I was concerned about serving a punch that would be too strong and get the girls tipsy for the wedding ceremony; not a problem with this recipe! We did halve the recipe to make a single punch bowlful.

I loved this punch! It's exactly what I like in a drink -- it's tasty and it gets you drunk. Check. Check. Only one guest didn't like it, saying it was too tart and sour. Sourpuss aside, this was awesome.

This punch was great!  I was very surprised.  I don't like sweet drinks and was a little worried, but it wasn't sweet at all.  Everyone at the party loved it.  Very refreshing punch.  Not too strong tasting either.  Other reviews cut back the alcohol, but I wouldn't.  It wasn't too strong for the non-drinkers either.

Reisling is a nice choice for the wine.  I used the carbonated water to make the ice cubes and poured the remaining water into the punch.  Garnished with lemon & orange slices.  I've already made this punch a couple times.

While we usually toss recipes that we give a three-star rating, we'll probably be keeping this one, although we'll experiment with the flavors of the concentrates we use.  My husband wants to try a more fruit punch oriented concoction, and that sounds good.  But it's a good mix of ingredients, and we'll just have to suit the specific tastes to our own taste buds.  :)  Thanks for the foundation, though, of what will soon be a wonderful party punch!  :)

I made this for our Christmas party last night and it was a hit! I omitted the cranberry juice in fear of it getting on my new carpet and it was not missed : )I also made an ice ring with orange juice, lemon juice, and mint for garnish. I had 3 people ask me for the recipe after taking one sip.

This punch was delicious and sooooo easy to make!  It was a hit at my housewarming and was so popular that I made it again at my birthday party.  Perfect for those who do not want a strong drink but want something more than just punch.  I changed the recipe to taste, which included adding a little more wine and half a can of frozen fruit punch concentrate.  It was such a hit it was gone within an hour and I had to scramble to make more!
