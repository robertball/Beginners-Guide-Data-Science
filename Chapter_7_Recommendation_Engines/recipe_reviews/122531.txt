I gave it a 5 but i did change 2 small things. I took out about 1/4th cup of the white sugar and replaced it with brown sugar when i realized the recipe didn't call for brown sugar. I also added about a tsp of milk because my batter was really thick.   They are really good. They rose perfectly. And the more they cool the better they taste.

Awesome cookie.  I had to add more sugar (used brown sugar instead of reg. sugar), but all in all, my whole family loved it!  Thanks.

They turned out very flat.  They tasted okay, but were nothing special.

Best basic cookie recipe ever. I did not add anything (ie baking soda) and am so glad I didn't change the recipe! Nice and crunchy with buttery melt in your mouth. I am going to try the variation someone mentioned to add a cup of oatmeal to make less sweet. Also, I made this batch with milk chocolate yum! thank you for posting this super yum recipe!
