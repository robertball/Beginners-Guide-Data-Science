Too mayonaise-y, it masks the blue cheese flavor - add half sour cream instead

I followed the hints of others and used 1 cups mayo and one cup of sour cream. I also added little extra balsamic vinegar and a dash of lemon juice. It was a hit, gotta make it again since it is all gone.

I have used this recipe three times.  Have doubled it as we eat it so fast.  We didn't care that much for Blue Cheese Dressing until I made this.  I adjust the ingredients a little for our own taste.  I have never used balsmic vinegar as I have never bought it.  I've used a different vinegar each time.  This is a real keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

My honey said, "Better than any other I've tasted!" AND HE'S A TOUGH CRITIC.  I think the balsalmic adds just the right touch to mellow the sharpness of the blue cheese.  It is on my favorites list

I have never liked blue cheese dressing before. I own a sports pub and grill, wanted to make home made dressings, pulled this one up and make it weekly!  The customers and i love it!

I tried this recipe because I didn't have any sour cream. Luckily I cut it in half because it is way too mayonaisse flavored for me. Since I used it on the Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza (from this site) it worked out fine. With what is left I will mix some sour cream and some more buttermilk for a salad topper. I won't make again, but will try other recipes from this site.

Use 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream or plain yogurt and you've got a real winner.

Scaled this down to 8 servings and had to add a bit more milk to reach the consistency we like, but this dressing is pretty tasty.  Duke's Light Mayonnaise is what I had in the fridge, but I would use regular mayo the next time, as I think it would add a lot more flavor.

Way too much mayo, and what? ... no sour cream?  No, the buttermilk doesn't cut all this mayo, leaving you with a mouthful of mayo taste.  Change it up a bit and you're closer to better Blue Cheese Dressing.

I've been making this dressing for years- my husband even asks for it by name. And many thanks have been given to Alaine for sharing her recipe!

So easy. I just threw everything into the food processor. I'll never buy it in the jar again!
