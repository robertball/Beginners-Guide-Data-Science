I thought this was just OK.  I was leery about green beans cooking, so I used food processor to gently chop the green beans, onion and cranberries, which worked very quickly and easily.  I think if you are a fan of turkey meatloaf, you'd like this.  I'm not sure I enjoyed the cinnamon and nutmeg flavor in the gravy; if it were a more traditional turkey gravy, I believe the gravy would have appealed more to my personal tastes and helped to make the meatloaf taste more to my liking.  It did look pretty, and the pancetta crisped up beautifully on the top.  Next time, I'll layer more on the top than the nine slices I used since it shrinks.  I followed the recipe exactly.  See pics in pan and sliced.

The meatloaf was great, but the sauce was gross.

instead of "regular rolled oats" try crushing some seasoned bagged stuffing mix - omit the green beans too!

Tried to make the loaf without the pancetta. I think it really needed the fatty taste of pork on top, since the loaf was not as tasty as I would have liked. The cranberries were very sour and did not incorporate well into the recipe at all, and this is saying something since I love sour things and love them in recipes. I would recommend celery in place of the green beans and sweetened dried cranberries in place of the fresh.

Good with some substitutions... chicken instead of turkey, half an onion instead of a whole one (yikes, that would be lots of onion!!), sweetened dried cranberries instead of fresh, and no sauce. I'll make it again and keep tweaking the seasonings.
