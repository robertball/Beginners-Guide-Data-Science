This recipe is a nice combination of salty and sweet which is a nice alternative to the sweetness of just waffles and syrup. The added vanilla to the generic waffle mix was a nice addition.

I made the mistake of dicing the SPAM too small which, while more like bacon, it  became chewier than I would have liked. I'm only mentioning it so others don't make the same mistake.
