These would be 5 stars for us if the recipe included 1/2 tsp salt.  The batter is very thick as written and using medium heat allowed the center to cook through.  I added a little splash of milk to the last batch of batter to thin it just a bit as it thickens up even more as it is standing.  Using a 1/4 cup measure I got 10 pancakes.  These were really great with the addition of the salt.  Thanks so much for a tasty Sunday breakfast.

It's simple, good flavor, but the thing I would change is the temperature. Medium-high is too hot, and I burnt the first pancake and the inside wasn't cooked. Stick to medium or a little less and these are perfect.

These were easy and awesome!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon allspice and a splash of vinegar.   I made them again the next day and cut the sugar in half and they were still just as good!! My husband and teenager loved them. I really like them with real maple syrup but they like the fake stuff better.

These are sooo good. The golden color they have is so pretty and I love the creamy texture that the pumpkin puree gives it.

I tweaked the recipe a little to give the pancakes more of a "pumpkin pie" flavor. I didn't have any nutmeg on me so I added some pumpkin pie spice in its place. I also added half a tablespoon of vanilla and increased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup. And instead of maple syrup, I served the pancakes with powdered sugar and whipped cream.

The original recipe is delicious, but if you want more "pumpkin pie"-ish pancakes, try the changes I made above.

I used Bisquick for the flour & baking powder & added a pinch of allspice & ginger.  If you really want to die for use real maple syrup & pecans. OMG I'm in love. A little sausage patty on the side & I'm in heaven on earth.

This recipe is soo good.Fluffy,and great flavor. I would make it everyday, but I'm too lazy to clean up the mess. I added a little extra cinnamon, because I looove my spices. I thought there would be too much pumpkin, but once you cooked the batter the flavor wasn't too intense. I will be making these again for my children

We love this recipe! I always substitute raw honey fir the sugar, and we eat them with butter, honey and cinnamon! Tastes like pumpkin bread! Yes, you do have to watch your temp- as these pancakes are very moist with the pumpkin added.- it can be easy to over cook the first side. But after a few you get it!

I tried a gluten free version. I used this instead of the flour called for:
1/2 cup millet flour
1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour
1/4 cup Trader Joes gluten free flour
2 tsp cornmeal

I have made this 3 times with a few modifications.  Others said it was too thick and I have added some water and then also spread the batter on the griddle with a wooden spoon in a circular motion (if you have ever seen crepes made, think that technique) after pouring some on.  I also double the pumpkin and have added 1/2 cup of pecan granules (I am in the South after all) and they come out divine.

Made this exactly as written, they were perfect.  I'm about to make another double batch to use up the rest of the pumpkin. We'll keep these in the freezer for a quick breakfast. 
Thanks for this recipe

The batter is thick so once I poured a pancake, I spread it around a little to thin it out.  That allowed for normal cook time and it cooked all the way through.  I also tried adding 1/4 cup water and that helped.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon, almost doubled the nutmeg, and added pumpkin pie spice - I like lots of flavor.  I've made these several times now, very easy and delicious!

These were amazing! So delicious with REAL maple syrup. I omitted the nutmeg and added a dash of vanilla with the wet ingredients. Also, substituted 2 tbsp. Kerrygold melted butter for he oil. Yum-O!

I read the comments and added a little less flour and more milk and vanilla extract (1tsp). 
I made them with a tablespoon and they were thin and tasty.    Loved them

The batter was too thick so after I cooked the first ones, I added a bit more milk...none of the pancakes cooked through even at 400 degrees on an electric griddle...definitely won't make again.

I made these awesome pancakes, and to reduce the sugar and fat a little, I used Stevia in The Raw and egg whites, and instead of white flour, I used whole wheat flour and a tblsp. of flaxseed meal to add some fiber and good nutrition. I cooked my pancakes in a seasoned cast iron skillet, so I had no problems with the batter sticking at the recommended 350 degrees, and they turned out perfect!! I like to add Greek yogurt sweetened with a little Stevia, and some fresh fruit to top off my pancakes, and it all came together perfectly. Love it!!! I have your app on my phone and use it all the time for finding great new recipes to try.

These came out nicely.   I prefer a thinner batter, because my electric skillet is not consistent with temperature.  The thinner batter seems to cook more thoroughly on my cooking surface.  That being said, I tripled the recipe.  I added about a cup more milk.  It needed salt, so I added after the first round of pancakes.   For fun, a bit of vanilla, ground flax, and shredded organic coconut.

I loved these pancakes!  I followed the directions, but I only had stevia on had for sugar. So I suggest using at least half stevia and half sugar. With syrup they were fine but by themselves they were blah.  I will be making again with sugar.... thanks for sharing!

This recipe was simple and had a great flavor.  I would definitely make these again.  I added pecans to the batter and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk to make the batter thinner and the cakes  came out fluffy.  Others complained that the pancakes were raw in the middle, but I did not have trouble getting the inside done.  We topped them with Cinnamon syrup, yum!

Very delicious! Probably my favorite pumpkin pancakes ever! Followed the recipe exactly, and they came out awesome! Medium heat. They are thick, but you can just spread the batter out a little with your spoon when you put it in the pan. Top with blueberries and a little whipped cream. Tasty!

I added salt, walnuts and used a variety of flours to make it healthier.  The pumpkin flavor is mild, next time I may try to figure out how to amp it up.

After reading comments we did add 1/2 t salt and splash of vinegar. Also since I had a lot of pumpkin that was more liquid we used 1.5 cups and adjusted the milk to the desired consistency.

These were thick and heavy. Too heavy to bubble on the edges, cooked on the outside, raw in the inside, or burnt on the outside to be cooked inside. My husband said they were like pikelets. After the first few were made, I added more milk. Gave them better consistency for pancakes. Flavour was fine

Very good pancakes! Added banana and dark chocolate chips (and the extra egg and vanilla as others suggested).  Perfect!

I made the pancakes and my daughter loved them. She is a very picky eater. I did change the sugar to a sweetner kind and added more milk and it made 4  big pancakes. I'll try and make mini ones to get more.

I added a little more pumpkin plus a little fresh grated ginger.
Then I eased up on the milk for consistency sake.  

The pancakes were DELICIOUS, light and fluffy.  Topped them with a dollop of whipped cream.  

I'll make them again.  Yum.

As other reviews mention,  the batter was WAY too thick as is. I added a lot more liquid to thin it some. The pancakes had great flavor but were extremely dense & quite dry. 
I will try another recipe next time.

Super tasty! I added a little extra pumpkin, a little water cuz they are super thick, a dash of salt, white chocolate chips, and pecans. Ate them with whip cream and bacon. Super freaking good. Will make them again this week probably since I still have some pumpkin left..

I cut the recipe in half. Everything divided easily except the egg.  I didn't divide that.... just used a whole egg.  I had pumpkin left over from another recipe, and it was a little more than the 1/4 c, but I used it all.  They were delicious!  The weather has turned cool,  and I'm all about pumpkin right now!

I added the extra 1/4 cup of milk along with the original recipe & when I cooked the first one I was happy to see that it was working well. Y'all who say this recipe is bad just need to learn to cook pancakes! although I will say that it could use some adjustments. By the end my batter was a bit thick, but not bad.

I thought it was a mistake in the recipe that it didn't call for salt, can add if you want. The batter was a little thick, so I might add a little more milk next time OR maybe a little more pumpkin. The finished pancakes didn't have a strong pumpkin taste; I'd like to try adding pumpkin pie spice next time and a little vanilla.   They are light in color and light as a feather, too, not heavy like you get in a restaurant (I like those, too, tho'!).  I was concerned they'd not cook in the middle, so I spread out the batter after pouring on the griddle and didn't turn the fire up too much. Topped with molasses.  I will definitely make them again!

I was surprised that these pancakes were so good! They were just a tad bit oranger than normal so the family really didn't notice that I sneaked in a healthy ingredient (pumpkin). I used self rising flour without adding the baking powder and salt because I did not have all purpose flour on hand.

Amazing.  Hands down, the best pancakes I've ever had!  This is what I substituted-

1)Added 1/2 TSP of salt
2)Added 1/2 TSP of Vanilla
3)Used Olive oil
4) Substituted pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg
5)Added 1/2 cup of PUMPKIN PIE CHIPS- 1/4 cup would've been perfect but I couldn't help myself.
6)Reduced the sugar by half.
7)Used homemade pumpkin puree.  

I took one bite and started prepping a double batch right behind the first one.  I'll be freezing these, and also making these for our Christmas breakfast.

This is a very simple recipe to make.   They don't take any longer to mix or cook than my normal pancake recipe, but they are a nice variety.   I added 1/2 tsp dry ginger  by accident, but it turned out to be a Good addition.  I also found they needed a little more milk than the recipe called for and I added an extra tablespoon of oil as well.  I always make our pancakes in a cast iron pan.   I think the heat is superior to a griddle for pancakes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.   I froze the rest of my pumpkin puree to use the next time I make this recipe for my family.

Wow! These are really good! They're very hearty and have a lot of pumpkin flavor! They are fairly easy to make. I personally mixed all of the dry ingredients in a ziplock  and mixed the wet ingredients (except the eggs) in a container and put it in the fridge overnight. In the morning I added the eggs and mixed the dry and wet ingred. It turned out very well. It is a very thick batter, but I think that helps to make the pancakes thick and hearty. I did thin the batter a little with milk though. I also doubled the cinnamon-I love cinnamon :)

Beautiful pancakes!  Mine were a bit thick and slightly dense, heartier than regular pancakes, but I don't consider that a problem. I changed the spices a touch because I think most people do to suit their own tastes. Yummy!

Flavor was decent. No matter how cooked they were, they were still soft in the middle. Could be a tad more sweet.

My family loved these pancakes ! They were a little too thick, so I thinned out the batter by adding extra milk. I will definitely be making these again and again. Definitely a keeper !

Very good and simple, just needs a bit of salt (1/4 tsp or so). Also, I added a bit more milk (I used coconut milk) as they were too thick. Cooked on medium heat. Will make these again!

Couldn't get the pancakes to cook all the way through - even on med-low heat, 1/4c serving, and spreading the batter out thinly.   What's the magic touch?

Definitely very thick.  I added extra buttermilk, used leftover sweet potato, half  and half whole wheat/white flour and brown sugar.   Very tasty indeed!  Thank you for sharing.

I made my pumpkin pancakes gluten free by substituting the flour with Pillsbury all-purpose gluten free flour blend. I also replaced the two tablespoons of oil with two tablespoons of unsweetened natural applesauce. They were thick so they cooked longer than suggested. I'm excited to find a glaze to put on top instead of maple syrup. They were yummy!

I tossed these together this morning and was so pleased at how fast and good they were. Only caveats: I would use 2/3 c. pumpkin puree, a dash of salt, and a little bit of vanilla next time. I like a tangy bit of saltiness in most of my recipes, and there wasn't enough pumpkin flavor for us. But otherwise, this is a great recipe.  Recommend.

These are spongy and GREAT! Personally, I don't think it's lacking salt at all, unlike some of the reviews mentioned . The spices balance out the flavor. The second time I made this recipe, I was out of nutmeg, so I just substituted 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice  and it tasted just as good (in my opinion, anyway).  Yes, they are spongy and thick, but that is what makes them WONDERFUL!! By far my fave pumpkin pancake recipe, and I have tried LOTS of different recipes for it.

The flavor was decent but wow, the texture was spongy and dense (but in a creamy sort of way). Don't think it was the recipes fault... just the pumpkin puree. Be warned,  it not like light and fluffy regular pancakes. More like cake.

Great recipe. I added a little sea salt as others suggested plus dropped a few pecans  on each as they cooked. Came out nice and thick. Added a little butter to pan each time I started a new batch to prevent sticking. Delicious with real maple syrup and butter.

Great recipe. After the first batch I also made a couple of tweaks that after looking at more posts others also did.

1/4 tsp Salt
small splash of Vanilla Extract
Splash of Vinegar

Cooked on Med/Low heat.

Perfect

I love these! I am not a great cook and they still turned out well. I used buttermilk in addition to regular milk and added a little more oil to thin out the batter. I also used butter and lower heat to cook with because the first few burned.
