Very delicious but the recipe is missing some information. It doesn't say what to do with the milk. So I added the milk just before I added the butter/flour mixture and it came out just fine.

I think this recipe is amazing!!! I make enough to freeze about once a month. I've had my mom over for lunch and she loved it as well. People ask for the recipe all the time! The only real change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water. As well, I always add extra veg and I leave the skins on my potatos.

This potato soup is great and very easy to make. The first time I made it I followed the recipe as stated and the second time the only change I made was that I used Yukon gold potatoes and a little chopped onion and they both turned out great. The only other suggestion I have is to top with chopped green onion and crispy pre-cooked bacon before serving. Great recipe.

Absolutely wonderful!!! Yum, yum, yum! I had to find a good potato cheese soup recipe when I found out the restaurant I used to eat it at used chicken broth (I am a vegetarian.) This was simple to make, and so good! We used vegetable broth instead of water, and we used twice as much. I also added onion and garlic with the carrots and celery. I would highly recommend trying this...the perfect potato cheese soup!

This soup was really good and is a family favorite.  My husband loves spicy foods and this soup had just enough spices to please everyone.  It is a really cheesy soup and very delicious!  I top my soup with extra cheese, bacon bits and chives.  I recommend this soup to everyone and will fix it again!

This soup is sooooo good!  As a vegetarian it's hard to find potato soups that have no bacon in them, so I made some myself.  But  couldn't have done it without this recipe!  Only thing is it came out pretty thick- I had to add water to thin it out.

Needed a bit more flavor.  I think next time I'll use broth instead of water.  Oh, and I made a white sauce w/margarine, flour, and milk, then melted the cheese into it.  Then added the potatoe/broth mixture into the white sauce.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It is very easy to prepare and tastes like something you would get out at a restaurant!  It's that good.  The only change I made was that I used soy milk (unsweetened) because that's the kind of milk I have on hand.  I added chopped bacon right before serving it.  A delicious addition.  Also a little green onion.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good potato and cheese soup!

Amazing potato soup! I had never made it before but have had others and this is by far the best. The steak seasoning really adds awesome flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I prepared this as a side dish to go along with grilled cheese sandwiches for a group of 110, most of which were high school students.  It was outstanding!!  Everyone loved it!  I sized the recipe for 40 servings, and made two batches of it each in its own pot.  I used 30 lbs of potatoes, no carrots, and used salted butter in place of the margarine. I had sour cream, chopped green onion tops, and bacon bits available for toppings. This soup is now a part of our regular menu!!

This was awesome!! It was my first atempt at making any kind of soup and it turned out great! I did make a few changes though, I added 1/2 c sour  cream and only used 2 c milk. I also mashed half the potatoes to make it creamier. My husband who HATES soup loved it as did my kids:)

This recipe is delicious!  I've been making it on a regular basis for over a year.  Make sure you use white potatoes for it though.  I used to make it with russet potatoes, they turned to mush and absorbed the broth, white potatoes stand up much better.  I also like to use freshly shredded cheddar cheese instead of a four cheese blend.  It's very addictive!

This is a great recipe!  I boiled my potatoes in chicken broth, added a tbsp of hot sauce and a tsp of oregano.  I topped it off with a tbsp of sour cream, crispy cooked bacon and scallions.  My family loved it!

I  substituted chicken broth for the water.  I also added approx 2 cups chicken broth rather than the 1.5 cups of water.  Added some more carrot and more celery than called for in the original.  Topped w/ bacon crumbles it was YUMMY!  Kids ate some, but daughter aged 7 said it was too spicy for her.  Son age 5 is not a big fan of potatoes but he did eat some.  Hubby and I enjoyed this very much.

This was super easy and really good.  I was surprised at how much flavor the steak seasoning added.  I did put in bacon and extra cheese and used fat free half and half instead of milk.  I didn't use the flour and margarine mix because other reviews said it was really thick the next day and I made it for a potluck tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing!

Needed more flavor and wasn't very cheesy. Definitely would be better with some bacon and green onions, even though I added red onions and garlic. Still a good potato soup recipe, though.

It says to use, basically, a potato per serving but my potatoes were smaller so I just eyeballed it. Was a little runnier than expected. Overall, this was very tasty, had a lot of flavor and leaves you plenty of room to add things on your own. I added fresh garlic, onions, italian seasoning, bacon, and green pepper. Most of the flavor came from the steak seasoning that was called for. I will make this again but next time I'll cut the broth/water amount down so the soup isn't so runny.

This was delicious.  I didn't add celery (I didn't have any on hand and I don't care for it in soup), and I added a small, finely chopped onion.  I didn't have nearly enough cheese, but it ended up tasting amazing anyway! I will definitely be making this again, everyone in my family loved it.

I tried this recipe yesterday when my boyfriend made it, and again today at my own house. Turned out very well both times. Boyfriend used Russet potatoes, whole milk, a bit of half & half, and a freshly grated block of extra sharp cheddar. He also added cooked bacon and chopped green onion...wonderful served with cheddar/jalapeno bread! I made it today with 5 small Yukon gold potatoes that badly needed to be used up, added 2 chopped garlic cloves, a small onion, and no celery. I also used skim milk, and pre-shredded cheese with about 1/4 C. leftover canned corn. I'm a vegetarian, so I topped it with soy-based bacon bits.  You can go lower fat or totally decadent with this recipe and it's great both ways! Green onions really add a lot as a garnish. Thanks for the recipe!

1/22/10 Great soup, although I did change somewhat.  I felt that there wasn't enough carrot and celery and also added 1/2 small onion.  Chopped 2 carrots, 2 ribs of  celery and onion together in food processor.  Wonderful, creamy and thick soup for a cold, winter day. 03/03/10 Have made this soup several times since my initial review.  I do really believe that adding more carrots and celery to the recipe results in a much better soup.  This is a great basic potato soup recipe and have enjoyed finishing off the leftover soup.  I use a homemade broth to cook the potatoes, carrots and celery in and find it truly adds to the depth of flavor of this recipe.  Wonderful, flavorful soup.

This is a great recipe that is easy to make, it also doubled without any hassel.  I made two changes; I added a small onion with the potatoes, carrots, and celery, and I used red skin potatoes with the skins on.  This was a big hit with my whole family.

I have made this four times in the past month. My sister and I love this soup. We double or triple the recipe and have leftovers whenever. This is comfort food at its finest. I leave out the carrots cause I don't like them. Thanks for the great soup Mandi.

Both my husband and I thought this was bland. Perhaps with a bit of tweaking, we could ge it to our liking. I think, however, I will keep looking. Thanks for sharing.

My family LOVED this soup!  It was rich and creamy with loads of flavor.  I added half and half to make it a bit thicker.  Be advised that this soup cooks quickly.  I allotted an hour for this to cook and simmer however, it was done within a half hour minus prep.  This soup is great with a loaf of fresh sour dough bread.  I will make this again and again!

Very good. I used broth instead of water. I pre-made an reheated on the stove and had to add a lot more broth and milk to thin it back out.

Very very thick- it was warming, but we didn't need much to fill us up. I doubled the amount of milk and cheese, and topped each bowl off with more cheese and some chopped bacon.

I have been searching for a delicious potato soup recipe.  Have tried so many and this one is the absolute best yet!  I added chicken bullion cubes to the water for additional flavor, and added chopped onion with other veggies.  Served with a sprinkle pf real bacon bits.  Best.Potato.Soup.Ever!!

This is a great easy recipe.  I changed things up a bit when I made it by cooking veggies in bacon grease, then adding the bacon pieces back in at the end instead of the steak seasoning.

Loved this soup!  Will be a definite keeper for a long time!  My 12 year old was able to follow this recipe mostly by herself. We did add our own touches: two cloves of garlic, onion, chicken broth instead of water, and chopped ham. Can't wait to make it again!!

I made this for lunch today and it was delicious and so easy!  I used dried minced onions and dried celery leaves, since I did not have fresh.  I also sauteed the potatoes and veggies in beef broth for more flavor.  I used a gourmet burger spice mix instead of steak seasoning.  I also didn't have a 5-cheese mix so I used a mix of sharp and mild cheddar.  And I added a couple of tablespoons of dried potato flakes to thicken it up. It was so good, and my family loved it too!

This recipe was very good. I needed to find a cheesy potato recipe for a function and this worked out great for me. I did however add twice as much milk so it wasn't as thick. I added more celery and carrots. Instead of the steak seasoning I used garlic pepper seasoning. It turned out WONDERFUL! You might find you need to tweak it a little bit to fit your taste.

Easy to make and tasted great! The only thing is for me, there was a bit too much sauce and not enough potato. Next time I'll add more potatoes than called for.

Both my husband (vegetarian) and I LOVED this soup. Only change is I used 1 can of vegetable broth instead of water (about 2 cups) and added half a small onion to potatoes when boiling. Thanks for the great recipe, will definitely make again.

I took this recipe as my base and made several changes. I made a rue with the steak seasoning,flour,milk, added pepper. I took half the soup stock and put in blender to puree then added back to stock with remaining potato chunked stock. Then added the rue and cheese. This was very yummy. I then divided the soup and in another pot with half the soup i added brocolli. This was soooo yummy. Great base recipe. Thank you. 5 star on base and 5+ on changes.

This was delicious!  I added about 1/4 cup finely chopped onion and two (cooked) strips of bacon, chopped fine.  You can add more bacon if you want.  You can also add more spices if you want, since potato soup tends to be on the bland side.  I prefer my soups smoother, so I put the potatoes and carrots through the food processor first, to get them really small.  The chunk size is up to you!  Will definitely make this one again!

This soup was delicious! I brought it to work for a soup/bread fundraiser and it was the first to go. It however is not a great make ahead soup, so would not recommend if you want to make it the day before as I did. It turned more into mashed potatoes than soup and had to have 3 cups of water added to it and it was still really thick. It was great fresh though.

Delicious. Thanks to other comments, I added the milk right before the flour mixture and it worked out well. I used a mix of cheddar, colby and monterey jack cheeses, which was delicious! I'm glad I now have this warm, substantial soup for the cold days ahead.

Ok so I changed this recipe a bit but it was amazing and I'm sure it would have been amazing if I would have kept it the same.  Instead of carrots and celery i added one small can of chili's and one can of corn, and in place of steak seasoning I used taco seasoning.  Next time I will try it with the chicken broth.  This soup was incredible, will make again for sure.

Added a small chopped onion to the carrots and potatoes.  Before I added the milk I ran everything through a blender (kids like it better with no chunks).  It was amazing.  We were seriously licking the bowl.  LOVED IT!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I had been craving cheesy potato soup for months when I finally found this recipe and I have to admit my expectations weren't very high. I was very pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was!

If you make this without any changes, it's quite bland.  That's what my fiance and I thought, at least.  If I were to make this again, which I probably won't, I'd probably add bacon and green onions or chives at the very least.

This is the best potato soup and has fast become a family favorite!  I always double the recipe, but it still doesn't last long enough.  The steak seasoning is the secret ingredient that gives this wonderful flavor, I have used several different brands and all have been good.  I usually use some half and half, if I have it on hand, but it's very good with milk as the recipe calls for.

I was a little scared this recipe would be bland. But I was wrong. I did add some chicken broth as a substitute for the water. Next time I would add some bacon.  I made it with skim milk and it turned out great.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

My husband and son raved about it.  We all enjoyed it very much.  I did use yukon gold potatoe's and added shredded cheddar cheese to the top before serving the first night.  The second night I added some sliced avocados to the top as well.  Very good!!!

I'm doing a lot of vegetarian meals right now and this is a hit. I don't have steak seasoning, so I added good quality garlic powder, some paprika, cumin and salt to the mix and it was delicious.

Awesome soup. I used red potatoes and left the skin on. I added some diced yellow onion as another reviewer did and it turned out great. The spice I chose really made it flavorful-- Mrs. Dash Steak Grilling Blends. The Kraft 4 cheese blend was a very good cheese for this as well. I doubled the recipe and was very glad I did, yummy leftovers! Oh, but if you are reheating.. add a bit of milk, after it's left in the fridge it thickens up a lot. Still tastes wonderful the next day!

SOOO good- the only difference I make is that I add however much water it takes to cover all the potatoes, carrots, and celery and then before I add the milk I remove about half the water.  I also add about 2 carrots and 2 celery hearts.  Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly and it's just perfect!  As a vegetarian, I really appreciate recipes like this.  It's so hard to find vegetarian soups especially!

I found this to be very bland prepared as is.  I used five potatoes, but perhaps mine were larger than the reciped intended.  I added quite a bit more steak seasoning, dried dill weed, and salt to bring more flavor to this.

Delicious! This was a gorgeous soup, really thick and filling and perfect for a cold winter's night. The only change I made was to use soy milk, and 1T of Italian seasoning mix instead of steak seasoning. I wish I had doubled the recipe!

My husband liked it. My son and I thought it was good but nothing to get excited over.  The soup was very thick and a bit bland.  I followed the directions to a tee.  All I can think of is that I used a different steak seasoning then every one else since the other reviews were so positive.

Amazingly simple and o'h so good! I almost felt guilty when I served this to a group of people and they all said it was the BEST potato cheese soup they've ever tasted...  But I got over the guilt real quick and dished out 2nds.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it into a loaded baked potato soup. I used one cup of heavy whipping cream instead of one cup of milk. I added two chopped green onions, one tsp paprika, and one tsp of garlic salt. I used mild cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese.

I love this recipe! It has become a family favorite so much so that people celebrate when they hear I'm making it. I always add something more but it's always different. I've added corn, cooked crumbled bacon, mushrooms, and any other veggies in the fridge that sounds good! It ALWAYS pleases and I always make extra! A huge plus-it seems like it gets better in the fridge overnight and throughout the week!

Had to add additional flour as the soup was too thin for our tastes.  Also next time I'd add some bacon bits or sausage pieces.

Changes:
I cooked the potatoes, carrots & celery in chicken broth.
 I didn't have steak seasoning so I used Cabela's steak fry seasoning.
I used evaporated milk mixed at a 50/50 ratio with water instead of whole milk.
My intention wasn't to change the recipe but needed to use what was on hand.....It was delicious.

I can give my spin 5 stars but I did not follow this one exact. First I used chicken stock instead of water to give extra flavor, and omitted celery. I used an extra half cup stock because the liquid didn’t look enough to cook potatoes properly. I used half and half instead of milk as well. My last change was the addition of bacon fat and cooked bacon. Needed more salt and onion though.

Great warming soup. We loved it! I added a tsp. of garlic powder, cooked the vegetables in chicken broth, and used 1 can of condensed milk and 1.5 cups of 2% milk. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper at the finish. Will definitely make it again.

LOVED This recipe!! I doubled it so we would have plenty of leftovers!! I didn't use the carrot or celery since I have a picky eater on my hands. :P  I did everything else and the only thing I had to add was  a few shakes of onion powder and just a tad more salt for some zest, but that's more personal preference. It was super easy and quick to make while also being relatively inexpensive!! Definitely putting this is my recipe box

This soup turned out delicious. I did put a splash of dijon  mustard  and worcestershire sauce in it. I also added onion. I did use beef stock instead of water. And added a little more milk to thin it out a bit at the end.I used cheddar and mozzarella  cheese.added thyme and basil to give it a little more flavor.

Too watery, very bland flavor. Tasted more like chicken noodle soup. Cheese didn't melt as described. Poor quality. I'll keep looking for another recipe.

It was pretty good!  It was the first time I'd ever made potato soup.  I have a large family, so I doubled the recipe and found I had to use an additional tablespoon of flour... I substituted chicken broth for the water, added 3 tablespoons butter before adding the cheese and I used 5 cups of cheese vs 4...it was really good.  I might add 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon of steak seasoning next time to spunk it up some.  Overall, we were pleased with this recipe.

I tried it, and it seemed easy, until I realized that I had added the milk to the flour and not to the potatoes. It worked out well, however, until I realized I wanted ham in it, and so I cut up some thinly sliced ham. not my brightest move; the ham has a funny texture since it's so thin. other than the ham, it is great. I'm giving it a 4 star since I think that is what it would be rated if you kept it without ham or at least used ham cubes instead of sliced ham. Bon appetite!

This soup is very delicious, My husband and I fell in love with it. The only thing I change is instead of using milk, I used half & half, It turned out absolutely wonderful, but I think either way would be great as well. My husband requested if I can make it again tonight for dinner.. Awesome! very delicious, full of flavor & healthy. =)

Delicious. I make this recipe ALL the time. I just use chicken stock instead of water and 1 tbsp less flour as it gets very very thick if you follow the recipe. Perfect base though, make it as-is once and then tweak the next time to get it how you like. The steak seasoning is brilliant!

Simple, hearty, simple!
I used mild cheddar only, vegetable broth instead of water (2.5c), and corn starch(1.5tbsp) instead of flour. Used an immersion blender before adding the cheese.

This was really good.  As written, a 4-star rating.  I added half of a beef bouillon cube to the water, and had half a zucchini that needed to be used, so I threw that in as well.  Plus a bit extra of the carrots and celery (a whole celery stalk, and two medium carrots).  Left the skin on the potatoes, too.  Super, super delicious.  Oh, and I didn't have any pre-made steak seasoning, so I found a recipe which called for hot pepper flakes, dill, coriander, peppercorn, and garlic powder, all of which I chucked in liberally.  Got raaaave reviews.

This recipe is pretty good as-is, but it's not great. To make this recipe excellent, you have to add bacon. Crumbling in a few strips before adding the cheese brings out the flavors of the recipe and adds a smokey flavor that really accents the cheese.

Yum.  Mani's soup is a wonderfully tasty, comfort food.  My family loved it.  I left out the cheese and two cups of the milk, then served the cheese on the side to allow people to use it to taste.  My family found that they liked it better without the cheese.  Next time, I will try using just a bit of sharp cheddar cheese as a garnish.

I did not use all the cheese it calls for. I think I used about 1 1/2 cups of cheese and some bacon chopped. Thanks

This was easy to prepare and tasted great.  The consistency was excellent.  It did take me about 1 hour to completely prepare this dish, including cutting veggies, etc.

I used low-sodium chicken stock in place of the water and had great results.  Because I read the ingredient list incorrectly, I added 1 tbls of A1 sauce in addition to 1 tsp. steak seasoning (my brand is very bland).  The A1 gave it a wonderful richness!  A good mistake!

This is a great recipe!  I changed it a little though.  Instead of carrots, I put in a half chopped onion and I used garlic powder instead of the steak seasoning.  I also lightened it up by using low fat cheddar cheese, skim milk, and low fat margarine.  Even with the lower fat ingredients my husband loves it!

Great recipe!  I switched the water for chicken broth for flavor and since I didn't have steak seasoning I used about a teaspoon of garlic.  Mmmm...even my very picky nephew loved it!

this is exactly what i have been looking for in a potato cheese soup!  I changed a few things, i doubled the potatoes, cause mine were small, and i added half an onion and i added half a box of chocken broth, as well as the water it calls for and the milk. I also doubled the cheese (becuase i love cheese) i made it like it calls for the first tiem, and i love the soup!

A little lacking in spunk, so i doubled the "steak sauce" amount, used a 3yr Sharp Cheddar Cheese along with swiss and parmesean.  Awesome!!!

Delicious! Like others, I added bullion to the water. Also, I didn't have celery so I didn't add that. I was a little worried the steak seasoning would make it too spicy for my 18 mo. old, so I didn't add quite as much as it called for, but it wasn't too spicy at all. Next time I will add all of it. We all just loved this soup!

As soon as I saw this recipie, I knew it was for me.  Being a vegetarian all my life, I have always used steak sauce on my mashed potatoes.  I put a little extra into this soup and it was so good.  Thank you Mandi!!!!!  This was the perfect soup for a cold Ohio night.

This is a wonderful soup.  I added a little extra celery and carrots.  And a lot of cheese to it.  It was wonderful.  Perfect for anyone who is on the run.  You could easily prepare the veggies ahead of time, which helps to cut down on the time for preparing.  Everyone loved this.  Even our 3 year old and she's very picky.

I made this easy soup tonight with chicken broth instead of water and added thinly sliced steak instead of ham.  It was terrific!  Will definitely make again!

Soup was awesome!  Only thing was to make sure you cube the potatoes small otherwise they get too hot!  I will definately be making this again though!
