This is a GREAT recipe.  My mom calls these polish mistakes and adds a few dashes of Worchestire sauce and garlic salt to taste.  You can freeze them too and then just stick them in the oven and enjoy them all over again!

These are wonderful...guys, especially, like them for a party appetizer.  Another review mentioned adding worcestershire sauce.  I do, too, along with oregano to give them more of a pizza flavor.  The extra "sausage" that I've used was pork or you can simply use ground beef.  They can be frozen and heated, as needed, but they are best hot, out-of-the-oven.

I make these every once in a while and people always enjoy them.  It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture the flavor - meaty and cheesy.  Eat them within 20 minutes out of the oven and they are wonderful

We've made these for years and call them party pizzas.  great to make in batches, freeze and bake if you want a quick snack.  We also add Worcestershire and garlic powder for extra flavor.  A family favorite and staple around the holidays!

Made as per recipe.  Processed cheese seemed to "gum up" the meat.
