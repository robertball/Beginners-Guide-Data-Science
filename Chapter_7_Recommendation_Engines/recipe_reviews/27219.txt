This recipe - despite the few ingredients and ease of preparation - won the crowd over at our church potluck.  I used frozen corn, fyi, and it was fine.  Also, you really need to increase the cooking time.  I cooked it for almost an hour until the top was lightly golden. Just keep an eye on it.

Everybody in my family LOVED this casserole(except my youngest daughter, but she's 12, what can you expect? Although she did say it was "OK") I substituted a 28 oz. bag of frozen corn for the canned corn and I cooked it in the crockpot for 5 hours on high instead of using the oven. I was nervous about using the crock pot but it came out "PERFECT". It starts out kind of "chunky looking" but ends up nice and creamy. I stirred it a few times, maybe once every hour. My dh was really mad at me at first that I was trying a "NEW" recipe on Thanksgiving,especially because he really loved my old corn casserole recipe, but he said he likes this one even better. I said, "See? You'll just have to trust me. I know what I'm doing. I'm a professional!" This recipe satisfies all three of my requirements, 1) It's inexpensive, 2) It's easy 3) It's absolutely delicious!

Sorry, I managed to change four things in a four-ingredient recipe, which I have to admit is terrible. But I liked the basic idea so this is what I ended up with - and what got very good feedback from my guests:
I halved the amount of cream cheese and butter, used yellow kernel corn (only 4 cans, though) and substituted 1 diced green bell pepper for the jalapenos. And last but not least: a little bit salt and pepper doesnâ€™t hurt this recipe, so I added to taste. This served easy 12 people as a side dish, even though everybody liked it a lot. And it was creamy enough - I'm happy that I didn't drown it in the amount of butter that the recipe asks for.

I would consider this a dip rather than a casserole because it was a bit soupy.  I served it with tortilla chips. This dish had quite a bit of heat to it with the jalepenos (and I used less than recommended!)    I backed off on the butter per other reviews and it still was a bit much. The butter wasn't absorbed and stayed on top making the dish look a bit greasy.  I did melt some cheddar cheese on top to give it more of a solid look. I served this dish at a potluck and people generally liked it, but I did end up with left-overs.

Very Good !!!  I could not bring myself to use an entire cup of butter though.  I only used half a stick and also added a little grated cheddar and was very happy with the results.

This is BY FAR the best corn casserole recipe on this site...or anywhere!  My family begs me to make it for every holiday.  Not only is it ridiculously quick and easy but it tastes unbelievable.  My only comment is to beware of the type of jalepenos used.  The amount called for in the recipe is perfect if you use the mild pickled jalepenos in a jar.  If you use regular canned jalepenos you are in for some serious heat!

I used fresh corn cut off the cob - you could use a more mild green chile - frozen corn would work too.  Not diet friendly but oh so good!

Everyone loves this!! I use Green Giant Super Sweet Nibblers Corn, 1/4 to 1/2 jar of pickled japs & sprinke with paprika before baking. Serve with FRITOS...sinfully delicious!!! I am asked to bring this to any pot luck occasion & never leave without giving out the recipe to more than one person.

I used chopped green chili peppers instead of jalapenos and hominy instead of white corn.  It turned out really good. A real crowd pleaser.

I served this at an office Thanksgiving party, and it was a huge hit.  Also, served it for my family at Thanksgiving, and there were no leftovers -- will become a family tradition.

However, I'm a big spice fan, and even I reduced the jalapenos by 1/2.  Still was very spicey.  Also reduced the butter by 1/2 because it was swimming in butter the first time I made it.

I liked this recipe although no one else in my family did. My six year old son thought it was too cheesy, and my 11 year daughter just made a face after tasting it and wouldn't eat it. My husband ate it, but it didn't WOW him. I did make some substitutions.  I was afraid of the peppers since every one else mentioned how hot it was so I used green chilis instead, because they are milder.  I also added salt and pepper.  It was good.  It was even good the next day with cooked onions, garlic, and steak added to it.

Yowza, that's some spicy corn!  I used a little less jalepenos than what the recipe calls for and it still had plenty of bite.  I used fresh corn cut off the cob and I think it could have stood to bake a little longer.  It was a good dish and we enjoyed!

Total hit!  It made A LOT so I halved the recipe.
2 cans corn, 1 can hominy
1 block cream cheese
1/4 cup butter
also - I mixed in a good amount of cajun seasoning to give it some extra flavor and topped it with bread crumbs for the final five minutes of cooking. 
Everyone loved it and the dish was scraped clean!

Very good flavor, if you like it HOT.  For a milder taste, use green bell pepper instead of jalapenos.

I reduced the recipe to four servings so maybe something got messed up in the conversion. I liked the flavor of this dish BUT it was way too buttery, meaning there was melted butter on top of the dish that never got absorbed. When I make this again, I will definiately reduce the amount of butter. Also, added fresh ground black pepper and reduced the amount of jalepenos. It was plenty hot with the small amount that I used and I love spicy foods.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and although it is not your "traditional" holiday dish, everyone was asking for the recipe.  I, too, used a lot fewer peppers, but it was still quite spicy.  I think this would be the perfect side dish for enchiladas or something Mexican.  This is such a great recipe - original, quite tasty and oh-so-easy to make!

I love corn casseroles so I decided to give this one a try. I did dice some red and orange bell pepper and added that along with the jalapeÃ±os. It was very tasty and creamy. Oh, I did use frozen corn. Canned has too much sodium and the corn is too mushy.

Love it.  There's a barbecue place in town that serves something very similar.  I had been searching for a recipe like this and I love it.  Next time I might use a little less peppers, but otherwise it was so good!

Yum, yum, and YUM!
Thank you so much for this recipe!  I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  
I used only half the butter and jalapenos like the previous reviews said.  Added a bit of salt, pepper, garlic and POW!  
I bet some Louisiana hot sauce would be great in it as well!  Thanks again!

I chose this recipe due to its simplicity, but will choose it again due to its taste.  I served this at a recent dinner party and boy was it a hit.  I was asked to bring this dish again to future gatherings.  I used reduced fat cream cheese to cut back on the fat and no one could tell the difference.

I love this dish, but I love hot food. My family on the other hand, does not, so to tone it down a bit, I use half the jal peppers and half diced bell peppers. Use red bell peppers if you want to make it real pretty.

This is really good and something a little different for a side dish.

What a hit! I am now making this in a double recipe ( 10 cans of corn etc...) and it is devoured! I take it to pot luck and make it for the holidays. I make it exactly as the recipe. The key to this is definitely the white corn. Thank you for making me and your recipe the hit of the holidays!

Great recipe for those with a taste for spicy.  Even with the peppers cut way back it's still pretty hot, but tasted excellent.

Excellent!  Made this for a pot luck supper and it was the hit of the supper.  Makes a lot and easily serves more than 10.

Great recipe, really spicy though, I'll cut down the jalapenos next time.  It was done in 15 minutes.
