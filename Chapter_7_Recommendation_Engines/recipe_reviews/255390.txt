This turned out good and I loved the addition of kale chips. As a matter of fact, I munched on the leftover kale and loved it so much that I plan to play around with different flavors and make just the chips again soon. I did not feel the orange added anything to the dish but that is just my opinion.

Loved this recipe. Did not use the Red wine vinegar though. Will be making it again for sure.
