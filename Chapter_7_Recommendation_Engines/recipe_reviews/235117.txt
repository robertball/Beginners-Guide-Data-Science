Made it without the prosciutto as I didn’t feel the need to add it to a shrimp dish.  It was delicious! The lemon gave it just the right amount of zing.  I also added a bunch of cooked asparagus mostly for color and I’d make it again with it. Two thumbs up around the table!

I adapted this for the Instant Pot - 5 minutes on high pressure, quick release, then add the shrimp, cheese and butter.  Delicious!

this was delicious.  I was looking for a lemony shrimp risotto.  the lemon flavor was forward and flavorful.  I added 1/4c roasted pine nuts at the end, which address some texture and nutty flavor, family liked it. used about 1/2 the prosciutto recipe called for.  it was enough and added a nice flavor, but not overpowering. I didn't add all the butter, probably about 3T and only 1/2 the cheese and used a parmesan blend.  will definitely make this again.  overall a delicious blend of flavors.  thank you.

I did not use chicken stock, and added Parmesan cheese instead! Really good and easy dish to make!

Will never make this again.  Until I added the cheese it was ok. The Romano cheese overpowered everything.
