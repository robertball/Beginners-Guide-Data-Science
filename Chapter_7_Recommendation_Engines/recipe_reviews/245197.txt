I have to follow a gluten and dairy free diet, so sometimes dinner options feel limited. I followed this recipe almost exactly (I left out the cheese) and it turned out delicious! The sweet potatoes balance out the heat of the chorizo perfectly. I did have to cook the egg for longer than the recommended time, but other than that- I didn't need to adjust anything. Thanks for the easy and flavorful recipe! I'll definitely make this again :)

These are pretty decent.  I think I'll leave the egg out of mine next time, though.  That baked egg yolk just really kind of creeped me out.  I had to use a can of green chilies instead of a poblano pepper because I don't even know what a poblano pepper is, let alone where to get one.  Still.....it's a good recipe and not too much trouble.  We had green salad and crescent rolls alongside.

Fan-freaking-tastic! I wish they didn't take so long to make. But they are worth the wait! I took the sweet potato that I scooped out of the boats and mashed it with some butter, brown sugar, and pumpkin spice and served it along with the boats as a nice sweet accompaniment. Delicious and filling breakfast.

I made a couple changes just because I was not sure how hot the chorizo would be. I used half of the medium chili because it looked like the right amount in comparison to the other ingredients and I used a Mexican blend of shredded cheese in place of the pepper jack. We both like it a lot and I will definitely be making this again. My eggs took about 25 minutes to cook, so you might need more time than anticipated.

It was difficult for me to find sweet potatoes that were similar in size at the grocery store, so I decided to cook various sized potatoes and mash them into individual ramekins. This recipe might be my new obsession. I've cooked it on three separate occasions for different groups of people, and my friends are still talking about it.

Wonderful recipe for a different take on Mexican cuisine.   I personally use "red garnet yams" for the best flavor and fresh roasted poblanos.    Easy to roast-chop and big rewards on authentic flavor.  The canned chili's pale in comparison!
You don't even need the egg on top, my hubby does not like eggs much, so I just leave his off.   I also sauteed a large shallot after meat was almost done, gives it more flavor.
Pretty tasty brunch or dinner dish!

I tried to make this but after baking the potatos the first time they fell apart as I tried to slice them. Maybe I didn't let them cool enough? I don't know. But the skin was not strong enough to be a boat. The whole thing fell apart like wet paper. So I ended up using the ingredients and making the same thing but as a mashed potato in a bowl. It tasted good. Just disappointed it fell apart

I really really loved it. I did changed the recipe a little bit: I used a regular red bell pepper instead of the hot pepper and I used pepperonni instead of the chorizo because it's cheaper.

I also cut the potatoes in halves and put an egg in just one half of each potato. 

It turned out awesome! My bf is very picky about food and he had a second plate. My daughter however didn't like the peel of the potato so I'd recommend to take it off for your toddlers before chopping everything in small pieces.

I will do that again for sure with guests.

This dish is good for breakfast or dinner. It's not spicy even though it sounds like it should be....but you can spice it up if you like by putting a little cayenne in the chorizo while it cooks.
It's a big recipe that makes good leftovers!

Great recipe! I didn't have any peppers and used turkey sausage since I had some on hand but it came out very good. Easy to make as well. Will definitely make again!

I was initially a little skeptical of this recipe but I love all of the ingredients so decided to give it a shot. My local supermarket didn't have bulk chorizo sausage so I made my own the day before finding a simple recipe here on Allrecipes. To speed up the cooking process I pressure-cooked the sweet potatoes in the Instant Pot. In the process of hallowing out the potatoes to make boats, I found myself with a pile of skin and sweet potato flesh. I took the extra skin and placed it beside the completed potato boats in the oven. They crisped up nicely into chips.  With the extra flesh I added some maple syrup and butter. Made a nice desert for the next day. I had a lot of extra chorizo/pepper stir fry. My son was thrilled and made burritos. I ended up with an extra boat. Microwaved the next day for lunch and it was still really good. Fantastic recipe, thanks much!!

Great recipe with savoury & sweet taste. Did not put egg as did not have any. And used Parmesan instead as that was what was in the pantry. 
Awesome taste! Thanks for sharing

I made one change. I love Chorizo but can't handle to greasy gritty meat. So i use soy chorizo vegan and tasty with a lot less grease

VERY GOOD We liked the sweetness of potatoe with egg.
I will be making again but with a bit larger potatoe. I used a mini which I love  but once baked a little small to have 
a nice bit of onion mixture plus have egg fit into boat. I just mixed a few pieces of  bacon into the onion mixture. No sausage. 
Very nice with a Korean rice and beef bowl.

Fabulously marvelous! I used a log of Cacique pork chorizo (had never eaten it before) and loved it! I added jalapeños to mine because I had that on hand. I was not so successful with the boat idea (my potato was on the mallee side) so I followed the advice of other reviewers and put some Potok in ramekins and proceeded. I would never in a million years thought up this combination myself. It’s a lovely change from the usual. Although it may become a usual candidate!

Good use of sweet potato, but more effort than it was worth for result. I might slice the potatoes to speed up the process, and layer in a ramekin rather make a boat if I make again.

I found the chorizo to have a bitter aftertaste which was pretty unpleasant.  I see others have tried other ground meats and given good reviews with that so i may try that before completely giving up on this one...maybe some ground beef with a can of Herdez salsa ranchero

This is very tasty and easy to make.  A big hit with my friends.  It also works well as a vegetarian option by just leaving out the chorizo.
