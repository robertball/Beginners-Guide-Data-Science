The hardest thing about making these cookies was keeping our youngest son entertained while the dough chilled LOL!  They're really nice tasting - not too sweet or too bland.  My daughter took these to school as a treat for her class and the teacher asked me for the recipe to hand out to the kids because the kids all want their parents to make these...said they were like brownie cookies :)

Wow, these are great. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the nuts (didn't have any) and used 1 tsp of almond extract instead of the 2 tsp of vanilla. I was out of vanilla also. The almond extract gave them a great flavor, and they taste just like brownies. The texture is fantastic, chewy but not mooshy. Next time I will try them with the nuts.
This is a very good chocolate cookie that my friends and family just love!

I made 2/3 of the recipe and was told it is one of the best things I have ever made.  They are like little brownie bites and mine baked up beautifully with the white outside crackled with dark brown inside.  They are very tasty as well as visually appealing.  I am currently making another batch with cinnamon/cocoa.  They smell amazing.

Followed recipe exactly turned out really nice. A little bitter for my taste, but people at work seemed to really like them!

This was an old recipe of my mothers that I had misplaced. I was thrilled to find it on the internet. Thank you, Thank you !!

These cookies are great.  They were always my favorite when I was growing up.  Over the years the recipe got lost and here I found it on the internet!  I was so excited that I went home that night and made them.  They are, by far, my favorite Christmas cookie to make.

We have made these cookies from this recipe annually at Christmas time at least since 2006. They never disappoint! We always love them and receive many compliments on them as well! I have even made a gluten-free, egg-free version and they are delicious too! We cook them a bit longer - 16 minutes - so they re a tad more chewy and soft. We share them with friends, our church family and neighbors. This year we made over 12 dozen, mostly to give away, and we are making more for a party this evening!

I'm not much of a baker, really, but I have made these twice, after several requests. I was paranoid that they didn't bake long enough the first time, as they were gooey in the middle even though I gave them a couple extra minutes. So the second batch I left in even longer, and they were too crunchy on the outside. I suppose they should be a little gooey, more like a brownie. These were wonderful to zap for about 15 seconds in the microwave from right out of the freezer. Awsome cookies.

Added chocolate chips and might follow the recipe for chocolatey chocolate cookies in ATK next time, but still coat them with powdered sugar - Hubby will still think they are close enough to wagon wheels.

Didn't have nuts this time around, will add them next time, I think it will give them the crunch I need! Great cookies.

This is a good cookie - addictive with the chocolate and walnuts.  I think it would work well with almond slivers, which I might try next time.  Grandkids coming over for cookies, so they will be the testers between walnuts and almonds!

These cookies are a must eat!!I am so glad someone else had this recipe, I lost mine that has been used in my family for years.  It is probably the best cookie ever created, everyone that has tried them and this recipe loves them. Thank you.

I have not made this recipe yet.  MY aunt used to make these cookies for us when we were growing up.  Now we make them for our kids.  The only difference in the recipe is we use 4 squares of Baker's unsweetened chocolate and 2 tsp of baking powder and no salt.  I will have to try your recipe and see if there is a difference.. When we make these cookies they do not last for long.  They are one of the best cookies I have ever had.

These cookies are fabulous. I too have grown up with them every year at Christmas! I try to get them out of the oven when they look just barely done to be more chewy.
