this was really good !!  as it was cooking i had my doubts.  i added salt and pepper, and substituted PLAIN YOGURT for sour cream (much healthier) - the result was yummy.

I love Shepherd's Pie, and this version was pretty good.  Consistency was perfect; however, I must agree with other reviewers who commented that it was lacking in flavor.  No salt or pepper in the ingredient list?  I found that odd, especially considering that low-sodium broth is recommended (I used regular) and ketchup is quite sweet.  I tasted the ground meat after it was cooked (I used lean ground pork), and I added both salt and pepper, as well as some Worcestershire, but the dish still ended up quite plain.  

I will make this again, as I am a huge fan of this "comfort food," but I will definitely add onions and garlic when cooking the ground meat, substitute tomato paste for the ketchup and add salt and pepper to taste.

I have made this several times and my family loves it! It's so easy and instead of making the mashed potatoes, I use Bob Evans Original mashed potatoes and it tastes delicious!

This was terrific, but I made a few changes since I'm on a low carb diet.  Instead of potatoes, I boiled the garlic cloves with 3 large parsnips and 1/2 head of cauliflower.  I also added a little ground black pepper on the finished product before sprinkling cheese on top.  For veggies, I used approx. 1 cup of frozen peas and 1 cup of chopped fresh carrots.

Very easy dish to make.  The recipe hardly called for any seasoning. To avoid the dish being bland I recommend seasoning to taste while cooking all parts. I also added a little A1 bold and spicy for a little smoke and a little kick.

This is a very basic recipe so I added my own touch. I used salt and pepper, 1 1/2 tsp dry mustard,1 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp coriander and 1/2 tsp fine herbs. I also sautéed the meat with 3/4 cup diced onins. To make life easier I also made instant potatoes in the microwave (adding more flakes than called for). I used low fat plain yogurt and 1 Tbsp low fat cream cheese in the potatoes. I'm sure if your making this recipe for a family you might keep it bland, but my husband and I enjoyed the additions I made.

It was easy and tasty. My family loved it. I  sauteed galic and onion with the ground meat and added salt and pepper as well. I used the low fat sour cream and some 2% milk  and 1/2 cup of finely shredded cheddar to the potatoes and mashed them together.

I don't have a review, but a question. I'm considering making this dish, but since I'm out of ketchup, I'd like to use Mexican restaurant-style tomato salsa. Has anyone ever done this, and would you recommend I do the same? I suppose it would give it more of a Latin flavor, to which I am not opposed. Thanks for your suggestions!

This was my first attempt at Shepherds Pie and I will definitely be making it again.  The only thing I added was salt and pepper.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good.

Nothing fancy, but mild and good. We added salt and pepper at the table. I forgot to add the ketchup. Oops.  This could be used to finish off some partial packs of frozen veggies. I like the idea on reviewer had of using Bob Evans mashed potatoes, but honestly, my first run through using the small potatoes...even with the peeling and going from cold water to boil, it was not too much trouble. I used my Pampered Chef smasher-thing. Can't remember what they call it; it's not a potato masher, but it worked fine.

I also added salt and pepper. Used a can of corn cause that is what I had. The rest was really good.I think most people will also add what they like.

I was disappointed in this Kraft recipe. I don't care for frozen green beans so should have tried another variety of frozen vegetables. I used regular beef broth to add more flavor and put salt & pepper in the potatoes.  Still it was rather bland. When I heated it up the next night I was liberal with catsup to add flavor.  I won't make it again.

Very good with a few changes.  Yes, add salt and pepper!  I only put about half of the veggies in, otherwise it was a lot of veggies and not that much beef.  Yes add about 1/2 chopped onion to the beef.  The potato topping is delicious.

I've been making Shepherd's Pie for 30 yrs.  This was bland, but not horrible.  Definitely a bay leaf & pepper.  I don't ever add salt to my recipes...I let the individual person add salt to taste.
 I use non or low fat beef gravy (or leftover when I have it).

recipe sounded bland so I added lawrys seasoning salt, fresh black pepper a little Worcestershire and chopped 1/2 small onion. added to meat while Browning the meat.  I love to cook in flavor.   Also stirred in a little cheese before panning it up for baking. Smells delicious and the taste test was heavenly on the taste buds!

I gave this 5 stars because I spruced it up a bit. Added salt and pepper and some other seasonings that I like to use (from epicure and stuff like that). I also used ground pork, sautéed onions ether the meet and stirred in some raw shredded carrot. I used probably almost double the potatoes (because we like them), and used Gouda cheese for the potatoes. To top it off, the last 5 minutes I used fresh Parmesan. It has a sweetness to it because of the pork and carrot, and saltiness to compliment all the flavours from the different cheese and the regular salt I added while cooking the meet. Make this all the time and we love it!

I made this today and it was delicious! As always I added my spins to it. I added onions, red peppers, and garlic to my meat mixture, as well as worshtishier sauce. I also added parsley, salt, pepper, and a little Cajun seasoning for some flare. Will definitely be making this again.

Perfect week night dish. I followed the directions but made some changes. I seasoned each layer, used more potatoes and less vegetables (10 oz). Instead of ketchup, I used worcestershire sauce. I also used regular sour cream and beef broth. I will be making this again.

The whole family liked this!  I used canned peas and corn because that is what I had.  Worked great.  Next time I will add a little more seasoning to the gravy/meat mix.

Super easy. Super good. I’m just a clumsy recipe following guy who cooks sometimes. Easy to prepare, easy to clean up. I mixed in some shredded cheese with the mixture, and some diced jalapeños. But that’s just me.

I did like this whole recipe at the end I did wind up at and Parmesan cheese on top and some salt and pepper to give it just a tad bit more flavor it would probably be better with seasoning but as it was my first time ever making mess it was pretty good

I followed this recipe changing out the beef gravy with beef broth. I did not need to extra salt with this substitution. My family liked it, I  added barbecue sauce to my portion.

This was my first attempt at Shepherds Pie and it was very good. It was very easy also. I will make it again. The sour cream was a surprising nice touch.

I made a cow's milk-free version of this recipe due to an allergy and it was very good! I used goats milk cheddar instead of regular, used sheep's milk pecorino - romano, chicken stock instead of milk and a buttery spread in the potatoes. The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is because the meat mixture lacked flavor even after I sautéd onions before adding the meat. I needed to add quite a bit of salt and will absolutely add other herbs and garlic the next time I make it.  But I will absolutely make it again!

I used peas/carrots, no corn since there's enough starch with the potatoes and personally feel the flavor is better.  Added a layer of cheese after meat and didn't mix the veggies with the meat, layering the peas/carrots after the meat instead of mixing together and added some Worcestershire in the beef.  I mixed an envelope of Knorr Beef Onion Soup Mix with the veggies before layering. I also used low sodium beef broth as I'm very sensitive to sodium taste. I added some other herbs such as rosemary and garlic to the potatoes while mashing and a little more low fat sour cream.  It came out nice with the additions. :)

Tasted great !  I made mine with ground BISON,  without ketchup, with Worcestershire.  Veggies on the bottom, meat in the middle and potatoes on top.  Made a gravy to pour over meat.  Loved it.

I think this was a great starting point. I changed a few things. I didn’t put in the beef stock I substitute it for a can of cream of mushroom soup. I used instant potatoes because I didn’t have real ones so I put the sour cream in with the beef after it was cooked. I also didn’t have frozen veggies so I used a can of green beans a can of corn kernels and a can of sliced carrots. I added minced garlic onion powder garlic powder chili powder and Cajun powder to the beef while it was cooking to give it flavor and added pepper salt onion powder minced garlic to the potatoes to give everything more flavor because it seemed bland without it.!! After these few changes it was just like mom used to make.!!! Will definitely be making this again.! ??

this recipe is a little too sweet for me. the sour cream made the mashed potatoes too thick, I had to add milk and it was still really thick. My kids didn't like it either.  Ok overall, but I won't be making it again.

This is my go to recipe for Shepherd's pie! Delicious all the time. EDIT: I forgot to add that I chop a bit of onion and cook it with the meat for extra flavor and use about 1 tbsp of tomato paste instead of ketchup. Edit 2: I have made this pie many times with my few modifications. This time, I decided to add a dash of Worcestershire sauce, one minced garlic clove, and 1/2 tsp of dried thyme. Results are even better! These additions raise the warm comforting food aspect of this one plate meal!

Yes I added diced onions, celery, mushrooms and carrots to the  ground meat for depth and substance. Also added a generous dash of Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning and a bit of curry powder to ground meat  for flavor.  Came out super tasty and delicious! Don't give to the dogs as they will be addicted!

I made several revisions to this recipe but it was still really simple. To flavor it up I added salt and pepper to the meat mix and used turkey. I salted the water for the potatoes as well and used broth in the mashed potatoes. I added some Worcestershire sauce about a tablespoon, chopped half and onion, and added garlic to the meat mixture. More cheese to the top and bam!! Pretty hardy and delicious. Will make again.

Why give this 5 Stars when it REALLY needs revamping..Like maybe some worcester sauce, salt and pepper and the consistancy is horible.  Needs more gravy in my opinion.

This is very good, with a moist, gravy like consistency, and the oh so creamy mashed potatoes on top. I didn't add ketchup, as I don't like to cook with it, but did serve cherry tomatoes on the side. It's a great combination of veggies too. I did use half sharp cheddar cheese and half mozzarella, and added salt and pepper when cooking the meat mix. My new fav recipe for beef shepherd's pie!

Awesome recipe, although I made a few changes based on what I had in my pantry.  Browned the ground beef, added a couple tlbspns of Bisquick instead of flour, a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce & about 3-4 tblspns of Ketchup.  I used half a small bag of frozen organic peas & half a small bag of frozen organic sweet corn (no carrots).  Mixed together and put in the bottom half of my round Pyrex bowl.  For the potatoes mixture, I drained 2 cans of whole potatoes & cut them up into cubes, added some milk and butter, used my mixer but not fully whipped.  Poured them over beef mixture and then.covered with shredded cheddar cheese.  Pyrex top on & into the oven it stayed for about 40 minutes.  All I can say is YUM!  Easy and a good hearty weeknight meal!

I made this. However, I seasoned my ground beef. I used instant mash potatoes, frozen peas, canned corn, green beans, and tomatoe sauce instead of ketcup.  Oh and cheese. I was looking for a receipe to use what I had in my pantry. I came across this. Everyone loved my version of Shepard's pie.

Love this recipe. Always get great reviews whenever I make it. I use whatever potatoes I happen to have around. When cooking the meat I add garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, dill, and other seasonings that sound good at the time to help bring up the flavor. I also don't use four cups of veggies just a single bag of steamable veggies and it is plenty. Also, for the potatoes, I just make mashed potatoes like I normally would with butter and milk rather then using sour cream.

A little bit on the bland side but it was still very good. I added some Worcestershire and a little bit more ketchup to the mix. I plan to add garlic powder and maybe some onions next time to kick it up a notch.
