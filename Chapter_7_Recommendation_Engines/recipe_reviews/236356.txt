While I love working with Barilla pastas, This recipe was off-tasting to me. The three cheese sauce was good, although I way upped the garlic, I didn't care for the sweetness of the veggie (carrot and squash) pasta with the savory cheese sauce. We really enjoy the whole wheat pasta, but the veggie ones are just to odd for me. Husband doesn't care either way. Thank you for this opportunty, Barilla! I will continue to buy your products.

The perfect creaminess of the cheese sauce  created an interesting contrast with the crunchiness of the bread crumbs. The cheese sauce tasted incredibly good but a little too salty. I don’t like okra so I substituted  it with peppers and the results was delicious!

this was so good!  I had never tried okra before, so I was a little hesitant, but it was delicious!  The combination of the cheeses was amazing and the veggie elbows were as well!  I'll definitely make this again!

This one was not well received by my family. Despite all the cheese, it really didn't seem to have much flavor. It is probably just a matter of personal preference, but I probably will not make this again. I did like the cruchiness of the bread crumbs with the creaminess of the cheese sauce. 
Also, the directions are not very clear on this.

I made this recipe minus the okra. Don't skip the bread crumbs, it adds depth to the flavor in addition to the fresh sautéed garlic. This is a wonderful "grown up" version of macaroni and cheese.
