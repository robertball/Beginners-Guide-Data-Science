I followed the recipe exactly and it came out too thick salty and without enough kick but I think it gave me a good base. I fixed it by adding a can of coconut milk 1/3 of a cup of sugar and half a bottle of sriracha chili sauce. That made it just what I was looking for:)

Loved this recipe made a salad and used this for a love gift to my daughter in law that was having chemo and was having a hard time with food. She ate this with gusto and so did everyone else. I use it often.

I wish I had read the other reviews they were spot on. Way too thick with no taste. Added a whole can of lite thai coconut milk and 2 T red curry paste. Then put into blender helped the taste a lot.

When I mixed the ingredients and put it in the microwave it was a paste not a sauce- basically like dark peanut butter. I had to thin it out before I could use it. I will not be using this recipe again. I tried to eat it (and I hate wasting food) but it is just not appetizing.

As other reviewers have stated this was very thick but a good base for adjustments. I use a Thai peanut sauce on a cold soba noodle salad all the time. I had to thin this one out before using it for that application. I saw a review that recommended using coconut milk. I will need to try that next time.

I cut the fish sauce to 1 tsp not table spoon. Obviously too much salt. I also added 1 TBS of water to thin it out. This was great. Thanks for the great base.

You could add a can of Thai Coconut to make it more like a sauce instead of a paste.......

I used this recipe for a dipping sauce for spring rolls. It ends up very thick and not spicy enough. I added more soy sauce(1-2 tbsp) minced garlic (3 tbsp) and red pepper flakes to enhance the flavor. I warmed it in a sauce pan over low heat and added 2/3 to 1 cup of water whisking frequently. It separates at a higher heat. I plan to use the leftover for noodles and chicken.
