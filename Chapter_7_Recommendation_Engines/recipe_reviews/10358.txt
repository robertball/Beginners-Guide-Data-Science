These cookies were very good I prefer a more cake like oatmeal cookie and these were kind of flat and crispy. Next time I would use less butter as they were a little greasy but over all very tasty

My co-worker makes these all the time and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. An easy recipe that makes a great crispy oatmeal cookie. Don't make if you are looking for a chewy cookie these are not that. But boy are they good.

These cookies wouldn't form a dough without some effort. There seemed to be too dry. Next time I make them I may try adding some milk. Regardless they tasted good.:)

These are really good but are more like a sugar cookie than a traditional oatmeal cookie. I liked them but still prefer the traditional more cake-like oatmeal cookies. I also added half a cup of flaked coconut to this recipe and it made them extra yummy.

This is a great oatmeal cookie recipe - I like to add a little bit of peanutbutter and some peanutbutter chips!

I really enjoyed these cookies. I did make one change though. I always taste the cookie dough before baking and thought it was a bit bland so I added 1/2 tsp. salt. I think if you used butter or margarine you wouldn't need to add salt.

These were okay. I thought they were too sweet and they didn't spread out like I thought they would. The dough was a bit dry but I just used a scoop and it worked pretty well.

Great crispy cookie. This is a traditional cookie recipe. Did not add the cinnamon. Just prefer it without it. Different oils will change the texture of the cookie. Some may want to add a little salt I did not. Pick another recipe if you want a soft cookie.
