The first time I made this according to recipe and my family of picky eaters loved it. But then I sprinkled southwest seasoning on chicken breast and cooked and cut into bite-sized pieces, added it to the mix and added extra cheese on top, and they devoured it.

Excellent, fast and easy.  I added some salsa to make it a bit more saucy, chunked the cheese and used a bit of Pepper Jack too, since we like more cheese and spicy foods...awesome.  I'll be sending this recipe to my son in college who needs some easy recipes...this is a DEFINITE keeper.

I'm sorry, but this was BAD. To begin with, it had an intimidating odor. Also, it was kinda bland? It really didn't have much of a taste to it. I could have done something wrong but I'm not willing to attempt to make this again.

This was really good. Next time I'm only going to bake it for 30 minutes.

I tried this dish because it was easy and I was surprised how good it was! Hubby didn't care for it but it is a good weekday meal and one I feel the grandchildren would love. Definitely try it. The leftovers are good too.

a little spicy but the family loved it! this is also good if you cook about a 1lb or less of ground beef with taco seasoning and mix it in.  Delicious!

The recipe sounded like it would taste too plain so I added chicken with oregano and cayenne and some left over spaghetti sauce I had (about a jar full).  It was so good the fam got seconds.

Great easy dish. I used diced tomatoes with chili flavour and a combination of shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Delicious

I'm a young guy with limited kitchen experience. This was about as simple as it gets and turned out fantastic. I loved it and everyone else did too.
