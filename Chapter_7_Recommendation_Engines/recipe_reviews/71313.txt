This was a hit for my family.  I modified my second recipe a bit based on what others here have suggested and enjoyed it even more.  I added: fresh garlic (2 cloves, saute with carrots and onions then add to burger mixture) Worcestershire sauce (2 Tbsp) Lime Juice (1 Tbsp)  Then I made a sauce to serve on the side that really compliments the burger (adjust to taste): Mayonnaise (4 heaping Tbsp) Worcestershire sauce (1 1/2 Tbsp) Lime Juice (1 Tbsp) fresh pepper & salt

For me, this was a middle of the road recipe -- tasty enough to repeat, but only with necessary adjustments. Pros: includes veggies (with room for lots more), pretty healthy, unique way to cook ahi. Cons: overall taste is bland (if you use recipe as-is).

I think a necessary ingredient to add here is dijon mustard, to enhance the flavor. A little Worcestershire sauce will help as well. 

Overall -- C+. Give it a try and determine the changes you'll want to make for yourself.

I loved this recipe. I made sure to buy some nice pieces of tuna and did not sub packaged albacore (although you mince it anyway, not all parts of a tuna-or kinds of tuna- taste the same, just like any other animal). I think I may disagree with the reviews that call this bland. It is a burger after all and should be served with accompaniments like any other burger. Taking that into consideration it is very flavorful. I minced everything by hand and it held together perfectly. Not sure that it wouldn't seem mushy to me if done in a processor. Every time I make patties I either refrigerate or freeze them for a little while to help the flavors meld and help them stick together. I love another reviewers suggestion of mixing a mayo/chinese chili sauce spread:) Definately going to try that! One more thing....these are four very large servings, you could probably serve 6 easily.

I love Ahi Burgers! When I make them I try not to put too much mayonnaise, eggs, and/or bread crumbs in the mixture if I can help it. Instead I add chinese fishcake as a binder, grated carrot, minced mustard green cabbage, chopped green onions, garlic clove, fresh grated ginger, a little sesame oil, soy sauce, salt and black pepper. I cook the mustard cabbage down and cool it before adding it to the Ahi mixture. I put some of the Ahi into a food processor and grind the Ahi up.(Sometimes, I do add a 1/2 block of extra firm tofu to the Ahi mixture). I mix everything together. When I make them into patties I put them into the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. I heat a large skillet with a little sesame oil and heat up the pan to medium high heat. I put the Ahi patties into a skillet, fry them about 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. I serve them with rice and soup. Very tasty!

Good recipe. The store didn't have fresh chives so I used about 3/4 cup green onions,bulbs and stems and no other onion.I also added 1/2 red bell pepper minced,and used seasoned crumbs and garlic powder. Came out very good. A keeper

I love this recipe.  I use the panko crumbs and add zucchini along with the carrot.  I mix up a little chinese chili sauce with some mayo and use as a condiment.  Delicious!

This was good and easy. I would recommend not putting all ingredients in the food processor at once, as some have done. Doing them separately allows for different textures. This made 8 patties for us and they cooked in half the time suggested in the recipe. My daughter liked the burgers plain, my husband liked honey mustard on his and I liked tarter sauce. So, serve with your favorite condiment as the recipe suggests. This is healthy and good...we will be making this one again.

Excellent, used one egg and added more seasoning to the mixture.  Will be making this again for sure.  FYI, Sam's club has great Ahi!

i got a really good deal on some ahi so i decided to try this recipe; i'm glad i did!  i just plopped everything into the food processor (rough chopped carrots and onions).  it was so easy!  i followed the recipe pretty much to the "t" except didn't use measuring cups (who does?) and substituted green onions for the chives because i had them.  i didn't have a problem w/them falling apart like the other member...maybe it's because i didn't try to shape them w/my hands?  i instead used a large ice cream scoop the plopped directly into frying pan and patted them down w/pancake flipper; they fried up real fast.  i served them on onion hamburger buns w/mayo, lettuce and avocado and my family LOVED them!  they almost taste like the fish patties at the local fish market - i think the difference is the fish market adds MSG...we don't use it.  i think the next time just to experiment i might try adding oyster sauce as an additional seasoning.  thank you very much for sharing this super easy and yummy recipe!

This is the best!! Nobody believed it was tuna. I added 1 egg instead of 2 and coated the burger in flour before cooking it, but other than that, this recipe was perfect! Yummm.

These were terrific! I followed the recipe pretty closely, except used italian bread crumbs and they were a big hit with my husband.  Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good. I think i would use green onions next time for a bit more flavor. I used the albacore tuna in the envelopes--just didnt seem right to buy $10/# tuna steaks and then mince. But I still thought it was good, reminded me of salmon patties my mom used to make on Fridays in Lent, except a healthier version.

Delish sauce works well with more frugal fish, like salmon, cod or even trout.  For trout, you need to up the seasonings like 1 Tbl Dijon, or Worchestershire sauce (ty previous reviewer!) or oil toast some curry powder or Old Bay, my fave. With a stronger tasting or oily fish, it's nice to add a mild or sweet shredded veg (1/4 cup) to mitigate that: zucchini or potato (russian banana is fabulous); or carrot or sweet potato.  Really, a great jumping off point! thanks for posting the original, and all the suggestions.

My family and I enjoyed these.  They did not have Ahi at the store so I had to buy tilapia instead.  I forgot to add the carrot, only used one egg, had no chives so I had to use green onions, I did add in some chopped fresh cilantro.  Well, I took the advice of another reviewer and sauted the onion and two cloves of garlic in olive oil.  I also made a sauce recommended by the reviewer with mayo, worcesterhire sauce and lime juice.  Great recipe and will make again!!  Thanks for sharing.

I made these tonight and they were so delicious!  I added in a clove of chopped garlic and a little bit more panko. I also had to use green onions since the grocery was out of chives.  They stayed together perfectly and the flavor was really great.   I will be making these again for sure.

I should have read the other reviews - I made this as written, and it turned out pretty bland. Next time I'll add some soy sauce, green onions and sesame oil, and cut back on the egg. It definitely needs some kind of sauce - cilantro mayo would be good, I think.

Delicious! Used a clove of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and chopped scallions for the onions as I needed to use them up.  The carrots add some nice color, and while the patties were very moist - almost mushy -  they stayed together beautifully in the skillet.  Ten minutes on each side might be a little long - I think mine were more like six minutes on each side and perfectly cooked all the way through.  Will definitely make this one again!

Awesome! I made a few changes to suit my preferences and followed a few suggestions from others. Used my food processor to chop/blend and added a zucchini, green bell pepper (red would taste fab too!), onion (yellow b/c that's what I had on hand), carrots, two garlic cloves, dill, soy sauce (low-sodium), pepper, and Ahi. I omitted the salt since the soy sauce had enough salt and used one egg white instead of two eggs. I eyeballed all the amounts and just made sure the consistency in the end resembled hamburger meat. The end result was divine! Will definitely make again!!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe would have been impossible without coating in flour, because the mixture was really quite wet even when I used just one egg. I added some soy sauce, but still these weren't very flavorful. I would recommned LOTS of garlic and LOTS of pepper. I served this over rice with Whole Foods 360 Pan Asian Marinade for more flavor. My husband who is typically a meat eater, loved this meal.

Like others, I added fresh garlic and some soy sauce.  The flavor was good, but the consistency was too fine (my fault - blended in a food processor, and they didn't stay together well when flipping in the pan.    I will make again, but will add celery for some texture, and will not blend as long.

I made this recipe and enjoyed it quite much. When preparing I cubed the Ahi and threw it into a food processor on the chop setting which gave the tuna almost a ground beef like consistency. I found this easier than hand mincing and made for well mixed burgers with no chunks. I also took the advice of other reviewers and used around 3 cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic salt. 
As some reviewers were saying the burgurs came out a bit bland I added a 1/4 cup of dried parmesan to give it a bit more flavor. I will be making this recipe again.

Really good, fresh way to get more seafood in my diet. I don't care for fish too much, but this was great! My family loved it--my 8-year old daughter had two patties. We served it over rice, but we want to try it on a bun next time. Will definitely make again.

Great way to use up leftover fish.   I used swordfish leftovers with the other ingredients as listed in the recipe.   Served it on toasted potato rolls with mayo, lettuce, fresh basil, roasted peppers and a squeeze of lemon.   Will definitely make again and interested to see if other kinds of fish are as tasty.

These turned out great!  Next time I feel it needs more garlic salt and some lemon. But great recipe!  Make sure to dice your onions small.

Used ahi tuna from Costco.   Couldn't  get chives, so I used a mild onion.   It tasted like mayo.    If the fish wasn't so blooming expensive, we may have enjoyed it more.    Just weren't impressed

Loved the texture... hated the flavor, it lacked spice. I'll try it again for sure!

These are sooooo good.  I made them exactly as the recipe calls for and served them with a sriracha mayo/sour cream sauce.  The hubs had them quartered on toasted Hawaiian rolls like sliders and I had it with lettuce and tomato, no bun to cut back on carbs.  Delicious!  Also tasty reheated the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, these were awesome.  My husband loves Ahi Tuna, and so many recipes have  wasabi, and he hates wasabi.  So this was perfect.  He ate 2 of these huge burgers. So fresh, and perfect for a summer meal.
