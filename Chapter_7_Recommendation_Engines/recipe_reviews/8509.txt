This is a great dish!!!  The family loved it!!!  However, 2 things 
1. When you melt the butter make sure you only dip one peice of chicken in the melted butter, don't put all the chicken into the melted butter the cold chicken will harden the butter.
2. Spray the aluminum foil with spray because the chicken will also stick to it.

What a yummy recipe! I have done this several times now, to the delight of the family for whom I cook. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly (but doubled for a big family). It was good, but seemed to be missing something. Since then, I have always added some Italian Seasoning, Paprika, and bread crumbs to the dry mixture. This makes the right mixture for me, and still produces extremely good chicken. I usually pour any remaining dry mixture on top of the chicken before putting it in to bake. I usually make this with thighs and legs. This is a regular in my monthly menu for "Fried Chicken Friday" where I generally serve a different fried/oven baked chicken recipe each Friday. Also, I have never had a problem with mushy coating. There will always be a little mushiness because of the juices from the chicken cooking out, but it is usually minimal, and typical of oven baked and coated chicken. I would say it is best to always use foil instead of a greased pan. You don't have to spray the foil either, that will help reduce the moisture in the pan and keep the potato flakes from reconstituting.

What an incredible recipe!!!  My father was on a chicken strike but no longer.  He caught one whiff of this chicken and before he knew it, he was sucking the bones.  I used 2 tablespoons of grated romano cheese and completed the 1/3 cup with parmesan cheese.  I also added dried parsley (for apperance), dried basil(for flavor), black pepper(for kick) and paparika(for color).  This recipe is a keeper.  Now all I need is a tastey creamy pasta dish to go along with the chicken.

This recipe is very similar to an "Oven fried chicken" recipe that I've been using for years. We enjoyed this very much. I added Mrs. Dash to the coating ingredients for a little extra flavor. Baked it at 400 degrees to obtain a crispy coating. Chicken turned out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Thanks Diana.

This is a great starting-point recipe!  I added Italian seasoning, a tiny dash of poultry seasoning and a healthy pinch of dried rosemary - crush it in your palm before adding to the mix, which will release the flavor as well as saving someone from getting a giant pine needle stuck in their teeth! I sprinkled the leftover potato mixture over the top of the chicken pieces in the pan, which made for extra crispiness and flavor. I can't wait to try this with flavored potatoes as another reviewer mentioned.  Super fast prep, and a tasty dinner.

This was a good recipe base.  However, based on other reviews I tweaked and combined recipe methods to come up with a really great recipe.  First, melt the butter, adding 2 Tbsp of canola oil to help prevent butter from over browning, and pour into bottom of baking dish coated with cooking spray. TO KEEP THE COATING FROM COMING OFF WHILE BAKING: First place about 1/3 to 1/2 cup flour in a dish big enough to for the chicken breast to comfortably fit in. Next, place 1 egg in a similar dish and beat egg well. Then place coating mixture in a third similar dish. Dip each chicken breast into flour, egg and then coating. Then place into prepared pan.  THEN TO IMPROVE FLAVOR:  If anyone has the all|recipes Family Favorites Cookbook published in 2005, look on page 183 - this exact recipe is printed differently - the one in the book has printed to add 1/4 tsp each of dried time and rosemary. I also made a couple of additions: 1/4 tsp sweet paprika, 1/2 Itailian seasoning, 1/4 tsp salt-free all-purpose seasoning and 1/4 tsp ground shallots and I also added 8 crushed saltine crackers.  Then I baked for 30 minutes and turned to bake on the otherside for 15 minutes, then I turned them again and baked an additional 10 minutes. I know this sounds like alot of extra to do, but my family really liked it. Hope this helps.  Thanks for sharing the recipe - very versatile :0)

I've found that it's better to bake the chicken in foil until about the last 15 minutes, then open up the foil to crisp it up.  Delicious!

This is the BEST coating for chicken around.  My 5 kids loved this the first time I made it.  Now it's an addition to our weekly menu.  Asfaras the other reviewers saying mushy and not crispy, I disagree.  Mine has turned out GREAT and crispy both times.  The first time I used skinless chicken, the second time, I left it on.  DELICIOUS either way!!  Thanks Diana!

With the addition of onion powder, italian seasonings, paprika and cayenne, the chicken was delicious. I baked whole chicken pieces, which I skinned, on a rack to prevent a mushy bottom. I also used garlic powder in lieu of garlic salt as the parm had enough salt in it by itself.

First of all, the name of this recipe does not suit the actual taste. Herb chicken? where's the herb flavor? Anyway, This tasted like chicken with mashed potatoes on top. I can see why so many people add ingredients. I didn't add anything, rather followed the recipe to a T. Hence, the 2 star rating. Sorry, but wont be making this one again.

This was pretty good.  I used low fat margarine instead of butter and baked on a rack to help keep bottom from turning to mush.  There was no crisp to my chicken but good flavor so I'll make this again.  Plus my husband liked it.

Oh, this is quite good! I have miserable luck with breadings and the like on chicken that I cook so I was surprised just that it came out intact. Add my vote for getting the chicken off the pan onto a cooling rack or the like as it cooks in the oven; I would think it would really be disappointing without.  I’m like most folks here, you just know the next time I am going to fool with DCANTER’s recipe some: I would not be afraid to really punch up the seasonings. I added a little Italian seasoning this time, which I would think more of that, more good cheese, more garlic salt and some ground pepper would add to this. The recipe is fine as it is, though and thank you DCANTER! I was really just looking for a way to use up a little potato flakes but because of your recipe I have a whole new direction to take chicken. And isn’t that something that we are looking for?

Tip:  Use a cookie sheet, line the bottom with foil and then place a cooling rack on top of the cookie sheet.  The breaded chicken goes on the cooling rack for baking.  It will prevent your chicken from getting a soggy bottom.

Absolute perfection! My husband and I both agree that not only is this baked chicken the closest tasting to fried, it is also just about the best chicken we have ever tasted. My search is finally over for a baked chicken that taste like it has been fried. I had no problem with the coating coming off, and I also broiled it the last 5 minutes to make it a nice golden, crispy brown. This recipe is a great find for anyone who likes the taste of fried chicken, but looking for a healthier way to prepare it. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!Update!! I have made this wonderful chicken twice since my first review. If you really want a treat, experiment with different kinds of potato flakes. Tonight I used buttered flavored. Fantastic!!

I admit, I look here almost daily just for dinner/ entertaining ideas. I almost invariably take the recipes I find and use and tweak them. As a person just learning to eat gluten-free, this was an awesome recipe, with minimal 'tweaking'! First, I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper rather than tinfoil. Then, After rinsing the chicken (I used tenders) I dipped them in potato flour, then in the butter (added an egg, also) and then in the potato flake/ parm cheese mixture. In this mixture, I also added italian spices, garlic powder pepper, and some ground flaxseed.  WOW! SO MOIST AND TENDER AND CRISPY! I flipped the chicken halfway through as well. My kids went ape-s*** over this recipe and I will definitely make again!

Just ok.  Was not crispy at all.  The coating would not get crispy, even after I broiled it.   It tasted too much like parmesan cheese, with no other flavors.

This is pretty good,first time I tried this with potato flakes. yum!  I added some ranch dressing mix that comes in an envelope (1/2 pkg).  Baked for 1 hour at 350 .  Little Trick: just so  that the bottom stays crispy also, I bake on a rack placed on baking pan.  both sides crisp this way.  You can also substitute ritz crackers or corn flakes, toss in food processor for a few seconds first, then mix with spices and coat chicken. I would make this again!! :)

Easy and delicious! I altered the recipe slightly by adding a half cup of Italian style bread crumbs and instead of butter or magarine I coated the chicken in olive oil before dipping in the breading mixture. This recipe was so easy that I was able to make it on a very busy night and unlike other oven baked chicken recipes I've tried, this one is not messy. My family and I loved this, including my picky toddler, so I will add this to my regular rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome recipe!! I made a few modifications though. I added Italian seasoning and paprika to the mixture. I used slightly less Parmesan cheese and less garlic salt due to personal tastes. I coated chicken tenders with the yummy mixture and my nephews, niece and I gobbled up every tender. Thanks for posting!!

Another great dish!  I did read and follow the reviews, added 1 teaspoon Basil, 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon Onion Powder, 1/2 teaspoon Salt and 1/2 teaspoon Pepper.  DH said "Outstanding!  This is so good and moist!"  And it's easy too!

Little bit disappointed.  It wasn't bad, just wasn't anything great.  You really need to flavor this one up a lot.  There really isn't much flavor the way it stands.  Thanks for the post, anyways.

VERY GOOD!  I used boneless skinless chicken which I cut into strips and pounded thin.  It took about half the time to bake.  I too was wondering where the herbs were, but served this with "clone of a pretzel dip" and it was very tasty!  Thank you DCANTER for sharing your recipe!

I have to say I never tried the original recipe, I followed others advice. I too made changes, I used boneless chicken breast and pounded them a little bit, as Marion suggested I added the bread crumbs to the dry mix and also basil, oregano and paprika, I then sprinkled on some of the extra dry mix and sprayed it with Pam cooking spray.  Baked it at 400 for 30 minutes and it was fantastic

Very good recipe. I added some onion powder and used real garlic (grated). I kicked it up a few notches with some of Emeril's Essence and that knocked it out of the park!

Delicious and simple! My husband rated it "Better than Shake & Bake". It was crisp and golden when done. I used partly skinned chicken breasts with bone in, and baked them on a rack in a parchment-lined pan. The presence of skin didn't affect crispness. 
Those people who rated the recipe as 'mushy' or not crispy may be getting different results depending on type of potato flakes used.
Next time I will add a dried herb - rosemary sounds good!

This is really good! I used breadcrumbs instead of potato flakes. 50 minutes was the exact amount of time for cooking. Will cook again!:)

This is a very good chicken recipe. I had 4 bone-in chicken breasts in my freezer and I decided to try this recipe. I cut the recipe in half for just 4 chicken breasts. I used organic roasted garlic flavored instant mashed potatoes and added 1 tsp. Italian herbs. The chicken came out very moist and flavorful!

Great recipe but 2 things should be changed:

Where in the whole recipe does it call for any sort of herb? There's actually none.
The seasoning of the chicken should be changed here's what I added to make it better:

Cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard, paprika, rosemary, basil, oregano, parsley & poultry seasoning. 

The only thing is that the mashed potatoes & butter thing are brilliant.

Great recipe. I've cooked this twice. The first time was pretty meh.. kinda bland. This time, however, i added a half teaspoon of paprika and red pepper flakes. I used olive oil instead of butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. My girlfriend raved about it, so it must have done great. She was licking the plate.  Great starter recipe! Easy to fiddle with!

These were good and quick to make.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.   I also substituted skim milm for the butter.  Turned out great.  My family enjoyed as well.

I made this recipe for dinner last night it was delicious (incidentally a similar recipe is on the box of Hungry Jack potato flakes).  The Hungry Jack recipe adds 2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes, which I did.  I made it with skinless/boneless chicken breast.  My husband loved it and raved about it over and over.  Even my 3 year old ate it as is and I usually have to remove all breading from chicken for her.  Definately a keeper!

An excellent dinner with minimal effort. The second time I made this I added parsley, black pepper and salt to the potato mixture and it was even better than the original recipe. Does NOT make for good leftovers however, but if you make it right there won't be any leftovers!

Quite a simple recipe, but the taste is extraordinary.  I made this dish as a quick, late night dinner and everyone loved it.  They loved it so much they even scraped the aluminum foil of its remains and were looking for more.  This is definitely a recipe that will please almost anyone.  The big question in the house, when am I going to prepare this dish again?

I have made this many times and actually got the recipe off a back of a box.  I have found the brand of the potato flakes determines if it is mushy or not.  "Potato Bud" name for a major manufacturer work great.

I made these for dinner tonight.  Although the recipe is called Crispy Herb Baked Chicken, there aren't any herbs in the recipe (so I added 2 tsp Italian seasoning) and the recipe is not crispy (as I imagined, the potato flakes got mushy). I used chicken tenders cooked at 400F for 13 minutes.  I don't think that any of my changes made the outcome worse than the original recipe would have done.  My DH was happier with these than was I hence the 2 stars instead if 1 star.  Thanks DCANTER, this one just isn't for me.

This was an excellent start; I added oregano and basil for the "herb". I also used chicken breasts. It tasted delicious, the cheese really shines on this one. My kids ate it right up. I only wish that the coating stuck a little more

This was a bit too salty for our taste and would like it to be a bit more crisp.  Will try again using 1/2 teaspoon of granulated garlic instead of the garlic salt and will cook on a cookie cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet pan to try to get a crispier coating.

YUM!!!!!  I will make this again!  It kind of tasted like shake and bake to me!  My chicken so sooooo juicy and tender and the crispy coating was delish!  Here is what I did differently:  added italian spices, paprika, and breadcrumbs to the dry mixture. Then I cooked it at 300 degrees for 1 hour, then 400 degrees for 20 mins.  SOO JUICY AND PERFECT!

Just a few tips after a couple of tries:  1. Season the chicken and marinade a couple of hours before baking it.  2. Free your imagination to suit the taste of the marinade. I used german Bratkartofeln seasoning and it was just perfect.  3. Use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter to make sure it will have a fried texture.  4. backe the chicken on a rack and convection fuction if the oven has it. This will make the chicken chrispy. Start with 180 ºC, and finish with 210 ºC to get a golden brown colour.  Enjoy your chicken.

A few changes: I dipped the chicken in Smart Balance instead of real butter; I used butter flavored potato flakes and added garlic POWDER, onion powder, Italian seasoning, ground red pepper, and black pepper to mixture.  I baked the chicken on a rack and this made all sides crispy.  I served this with cheese tortellini and homemade marinara sauce.  Turned out to be a GREAT combo!

You can use this for baking any kind of meat basically.  My main suggestion is to put it on a wire rack over a pan covered with foil, turn throughout cooking process (about 2-4 times) until all areas are browned, and it is perfect-just like fried chicken without all the oil.  I have used this to make chicken strips and most recently with drumsticks.  Excellent.

Nice recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast to avoid the sogginess from other fatty cuts of chicken.  I seasoned chicken with pepper and garlic powder.  I also added some breadcrumbs to the mixture.  Along with paprika, and pepper and a little onion powder.  I used Herb flavored instant mash potato flakes.  I also sprinkled the remaining crumb mixture that was left over after breading over all of it in the dish.  Nice and crunchy and flavorful.

My family ate this chicken like it was going out of style.  

The few modifications I made- I added crushed red pepper to the potato mix.  After I put the chicken on the baking pan, I lightly drizzled the leftover butter over the pieces of chicken then spooned the leftover potato mixture over the entire pan.  While it cooked, the potato mixture on the bottom of the pan absorbed any extra melted butter/chicken fat/etc.  

The chicken turned out beautifully.  
Great color, juicy, lightly crisp outer layer.

Will make again for sure.  Next time I will add Mrs. Dash to the potato mix as well, I was out this time.

I was pleasantly surprised by how tender and flavorful this recipe turned out to be.  I did make a few changes: sprinkled chicken with salt and pepper and coated with beaten egg instead to make it leaner and I used chicken .  Baked at 400F for 15min per side, and it was perfectly done.  It's a keeper!

I liked this one.  The potatoes gave it a great texture and when you bit into the chicken it tasted to me like mashed potatoes (literally)! I did add some spices such as garlic and italian seasonings just to give a little more flavor.

This recipe is wonderful.  We made no changes & it is perfect. Potatoe flakes are just an envelope of instant mashed potates.  I wasn't sure at first.

Very good! My husband loved this. I baked on a rack till chicken done, then broiled on low each side for about 3-5 min. This really crisped it up and added a golden color, sooo good.

This was very tasty.  I used thighs and it was good.  Although I was confused by the name, since there are no herbs listed.  I doubled the ingredients, but not the chicken, and added 2 tbsp of Italian Seasoning.  Rating is for recipe as written, not with me adding the seasoning.  That gave it more taste to me.

The flavor of the chicken was really good.  But I did add ALOT of extra seasoning.  I rubed salt,pepper, garlic on chicken before dipping and I added salt pepper and 2 extra tsp of garlic to mix.  This was NOT CRUNCHY. It was actually soggy.  Once the chicken was cooked we broiled it to crisp the breading which made a very dry chicken.

I only give this recipe 3 stars, because I altered it, so I can't even rate the original recipe.  I followed other's suggestion to use Italian bread crumbs, which I did. I also soaked the chicken in salt-water for a couple of hours. It turned out very delish! The breading was kind-of falling off, but otherwise, very good!

This is a pretty good recipe, and very easy to prepare. I bought wings so could not remove the skin easily, but thought they were good nonetheless. I might add a little more garlic salt next time for more flavor.

I found that this recipe wasn't very "herb-Y' so I added a few things: 1 tsp whole oregano 1/4 tsp of ground sage 1 tsp of crushed pepper 1 1/2 tsp of paprika and 1/2 tsp of black pepper. This makes it a little hot but my family loved it. However  I didn't find it to be crispy. I'll read some reviews and see what others did. But other than that: Love it!

This recipe was very good.  I added some italian bread crumbs to the potato flakes along with some garlic, poultry seasoning and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick.  Excellent!  This one is going to become a new staple in my house.  Super quick and easy to make, with a ton of taste!

This was such a nice change to the regular baked chicen I've made for years! The flavor was perfect (although I did add seasoned salt, pepper, and extra garlic salt to the flakes). The texture was nice and after putting it in the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, the chicken came out a perfect golden brown. Strangley enough, my 5 year old didn't like the batter on it, but he can be a weird eater. I do think most kids would inhale this recipe.

Loved the crunchy outside, without the skin! Very simple and tasty! I have made with boneless breasts, too. In my opinion, this recipe is too plain without the bone to give some flavor. And... it is called crispy HERB chicken! Where are the herbs in the recipe!? I will definitely make again, using bone-in chicken and adding HERBS!.

Wow! Excellent!  I used 3 large boneless skinless breasts and then cut ea in two.  I served baked potatoes and green beans with it.  They were just so tasty, had a wonderful crust, very juicy and tender too.  Very easy to prepare.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

WOW!! This was my first attempt at chicken, as I am new to cooking and deathly afraid of ruining my meal, especially overcooking chicken! But let me tell you, this was as juicy as it gets!!! I added basil to the mix , and then sauteed basil and onions which I then put on top of the chicken before baking it, and it came out absolutely INCREDIBLE!! Thank you so much for a good first chicken experience!

We really liked this, to cut back on salt intake I cut out the butter and used 1% milk, one egg, with a little olive oil whisked together rolled chicken in then coated with mixture.  The olive oil really helped to hold breading. Used Garlic powder in place of Garlic Salt.  Sprayed pan with butter flavored pam.  Cooked as directed.  Very Very Good.  Thanks for the post.

A wonderful treat!  This is one of the first recipes that I tried on this website, and my fiancee and I both loved it!  This is definately going to be in my regular menu!  I spiced it up with some oregano and italian seasoning.  I was out of fresh parm, so I used the dry grated kind.  Yummy!

This recipe is really good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breats.  The only complaint I had was my crust didn't get crispy because I had to lower the cooking time.  Based on that fact alone I would recommend using larger pieces or boned chicken breats.  The parts of the chicken that did crisp were the best.  The chicken has a mild flavor and the strongest thing I tasted was the cheese.  Next time I think I will add some spices in addition to the garlic salt.  This is a really nice change from breaded baked chicken though and I think I will continue to experiment with it until I get it perfected to my families tastes.

I took the other reviews advice and added more herbs. I used garlic, paprika, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and parsley. I added to my chicken and to the topping mix. Very Easy to make, I put it in a glass baking dish with a very light coating of cooking spray. Was very tasty, will experiment the next time I make it with other spices.  It was a nice change to the same ol same ol'.  Brenda

I wasnt so sure about the potato flakes, but it smelled so good while it baked.
Then I pulled it out of the oven it looked good, and when we ate it.
It was so good we were eating the flakes off of the baking sheet.
It reminded me of fried chicken without the mess.
I will def be making it again.
ASAP

This is so good, and easy to alter the recipe to fit as many servings as you need. Also, you may add more spices (parsley flakes,pepper,Italian seasonings or whatever)- to taste. We like it with rice pilaf and a salad.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added the seasonings mentioned in a previous review: a sprinkle of paprika, Italian seasoning cayenne and onion powder. I used garlic salt, not powder and the recipe needs the salt so I wouldn't recommend garlic powder.  The thinner chicken pieces cooked in 40 min. and the thicker pieces were 50 min.  The chicken was crispy and moist and I will definitely make it again.

I would'nt call this CRISPY chicken, but I would call this delicious!!  Everyone loved the flavor.  I added one teaspoon of Mrs. Dash to the potato mixture and baked the chicken on my broiler rack and pan, as the other reviews said that the chicken was not as crisp as they liked it.  I will be making this dish again and again.  Thank you Diana.

Great coating for chicken when some extra spices are added.  I added onion powder, pepper, cayenne, italian seasoning.  I also baked the chicken on a cooling rack so it wouldnt get mushy.  Turned out great

I loved this recipe.  I never would have thought to use potato flakes, and actually made my family guess what the coating was.  (they did not guess it).  I used chicken thighs because of the price and hubs prefers.  Was nice n crispy.  I did add about a teaspoon of chicken "rub" to the potato mixture to jazz it up a bit.  Yum!

This is by far the best chicken I've ever made. I used chicken breast tenderloins because I have not had much luck with chicken breasts (they are so thick, have to cook them for so long to bring them to a safe temperature and they dry out... maybe it's my oven). The tenderloins were thinner and turned out perfectly! I used the potato flakes, parmesan cheese, garlic pepper (instead of salt) and paprika. I will definitely be making this again!

My sister and I could not decide what to make for dinner, so we pulled up all recipes and found this amazing recipe! We added some italian seasoning and a tiny bit of poultry seasoning, and also put a tad more parmesan than what was called for, but it came out GREAT! It was delicious. And what makes it even better is my 14 month old couldn't get enough.

We love this chicken. I make it regularly. I sometimes add poultry seasoning to the mix. Tonight, I am subbing panko bread crumbs for the cheese. Just don't have it and don't want to go to the store.

It was good, but ironically the "herb baked chicken" does not contain herbs.....so I added italian seasoning. Turned out great. Felt like a healthier version of KFC's extra crispy.

So yummy!  I added Lawry's season salt to the potato flake mixture which was great except for forgetting there was already salt in the garlic salt.  Bummer!  Resulting chicken was too salty but still really good.  My husband raved and raved and said we should have this every week. :)

These were ok, mine never got that crispy. I added some parsley to the potato flakes. I don't think I would make these again.

i loved this chicken. however it only gets 4 stars cause i had to make some changes.  First i added some spices other than just the garlic like others suggested.  I added small amounts of pepper, parsley flakes, basil, mrs. dash, papkika, and cayenne papper.  I dont know how much of a difference some of those made but but this mixture turned out perfect and had a tiny bit of heat.  Also I don't have a lot of luck with baking so I cooked them in a skillet with a little olive oil and cooking spray.  Lastly I used butter and egg white to coat the chicken in istead of just butter to make it stick better.  But over all great recipe will make it again.  The potato flakes were definantly a great alternative to traditional bread crumbs

Very good recipe - my family enjoyed it very much.  I used skinless, boneless cut into "chicken fingers"  because that's what I had.  I may add some extra spice next time - Italian seasoning like suggested.  I did not need to grease the pan.  Just used foil and as long as I was using butter and it was fully cooked, it was very crispy and not mushy at all.  Because the pieces were boneless, skinless - I cooked for only about 35 minutes.  I was happy to cut down on the cooking time.  I will definitely make again!

This was great. I am glad I read the reviews and used other suggestions as in adding oregano, basil and paprika to the mixture. I also used garlic powder instead of salt. Dipped in egg/olive oil instead of butter. And turned it over 1/2 way through. I will make this again!

The way I made it was five stars, but this recipe really needed a little adjustment! I added 1/2 t. italian seasoning, 1/2 t. papricka, and 1/4 t. pepper. I also used a butter/egg wash, instead of just butter to help the crumbs stick better. I baked the chicken (I used boneless skinless chicken breasts) on a rack and turned them about 2/3 of the way through. My large chicken breasts took about 35 minutes at 375. They came out moist and very flavorful! This was definitely good baked chicken!

I, for the most part followed the recipe but earlier in the day I made a rub out of olive oil, paprika, onion powder, pepper and thyme. I used a whole chicken, cut up, then put it in a covered bowl and let it sit in the fridge until I was ready to bread it. This was the most delicious chicken and will become a regular in our house. It turned out nice and crunchy and everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe, but like others I tweaked it a bit. I need to feed more so I added more chicken and but instead of doubling the potato flakes, I added crushed corn flake crumbs. I did the flour dredge and then the egg, and then into the potato, c. flake crumbs, and then parm. cheese and other herbs to taste. I too, did the garlic powder instead of g. salt. Then drizzled the melted butter over the top of the chicken pieces. SOOOOO GOOD!!! Yes, the bottom wasn't crunchy, but, its a keeper anyway. My kids loved it as well as the hubby!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I used skinless - but not boneless - chicken thighs.  I followed the directions but made modifications as suggested by other reviewers.  I used olive oil instead of butter and added a few tablespoons of cracker meal to the potato flakes.  I added some herbs (to be true to the name) - it was a mixture of 5 or 6 herbs that is salt free - I added about 1/2 tsp. also substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I used a half tsp. of onion powder also and 1/2 tsp. of paprika.  It turned out very juicy but not as crispy as I'd have liked.  It was very similar to shake and bake.  My DH liked it and he gives out the ratings (I cook - he rates).  He said it was a keeper and was very good but not that wow factor that a 5 star deserves.

I use panko bread crumbs instead of potato flakes. Get them in the asian section of the grocery store. They don't get mushy; they stay nice and crunchy. Also, add some paprika and italian seasonings (basil, parsley, thyme, oregano, etc.) as mentioned by other users... it's better that way.

We loved this dish. I did add lemon pepper, Adobo w/cumin, Parsley and some Mrs. Dash table herb blend. This was so easy to make and so versatile you can change the herbs and make have whatever flavor you want. I used boneless skinless thighs and they worked great also. Great and easy my favorite things!!!

This is a great recipe, basically, because my husband likes it. (He is very hard to please.) The only difference that I make is to cut back on the cheese and use some seasoned breadcrumbs, in it's place. I also just skin my chicken breast, but leave it on the bone. I bake it between 45 and 60 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken breasts.(To Lois, You asked about herbs...Just mix in some Italian seasoning (dried)...a teaspoon to a tablespoon, depending on how strong a flavor you are looking for.)

Very good. Definitely bake for at least 1 hour. I followed other user who broiled for two minutes. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper, italian seasoning, paprika, garlic and onion powder and pepper.

This was really great, my family liked it. I added a Parm/Ramano cheese and few other herbs, I used eggs instead of butter to dip it in to lower the calories.  One thing it took a little longer then 45min for it took to was about 1.5 to realy get golden brown useing Leg Quarters.

I gave this recipe a 1 because even after adding onion flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika more salt and pepper, it was still super bland! I even mixed a little EVOO in with the melted butter but with no avail. I will admit the chicken came out really crispy and golden brown, but the powder taste and odd texture from the potato flakes makes this recipe a dud. Will not make again.

Simple and tasty.  I didn't have potato flakes (instant mashed potatoes?) so I used crunched up rice crispy cereal.  Worked well.  Chicken was crisp and moist despite being served later than anticipated.

OK, so I was sort of scared of using instant potatoes ever- but this was REALLY naughty and delicious.  We used a four cheese flavored variety and real parmigiano reggiano.  I will absolutely  make this again.

I made this exactly as directed and cooked it for one hour. The chicken was good but I felt that the coating was lacking something. It was crunchy and light but I would have liked a thicker coating. Will probably make again since it's so, so easy unless I find a better recipe.

I made one alteration to this recipe to reduce the fat content.  I dredged my boneless/skinless chicken breasts in plain yogurt before putting it into the potato flake mixture.  YUMMY!  Next time, I will thin the yogurt with a bit of water and double dip into the potato flake mix.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made!  I used skinless, boneless breasts, added some freshly ground pepper to the coating mix, and drizzled the leftover melted butter over the chicken just before I put it in the oven.  It was fantastic!!  I think I'm going to try this next time on some breast tenders to make homemade chicken fingers.  Thank you so much for a fast, easy, delicious recipe!

I use this recipe constantly!  We've been doing a lot of variations:  substituting the Parm cheese with powdered ranch dressing, using dijon mustard instead of butter, or using the flavoring that comes with the mashed potato flakes.  Great, simple recipe!

I have been using this recipe ever since "Hungry Jack" featured it on their Instant Mashed Potatoes box. I also add some Italian seasonings, instead of butter I brush chicken with garlic infused olive oil much healthier and often use a combo of Romano, Parmesan cheeses, have even combined "Kraft" Parm Plus, with regular Parmesan or Romano. My husband loves fried chicken and agrees this is as good and much healthier! Sometimes I substitute Pork cutlets, Fish steak/fillets. Fast, simple, delicious and healthy!

AWESOME! I used garlic herb flavored potato flakes and this was a huge hit with my husband. The chicken remained juicy but had a great coating, much healthier than fried!

Good flavor and easy to make. I wouldn't exactly call it Herb chicken since it only has garlic salt in it but it is very easy to make. Similar to the recipe on the Hungry Jack box but hey it's all good! I added dried parsley as well and it was super yummy! Thanks so much Diana!!

i used boneless breasts- pretty good alternative to plain chicken. had a hard time getting the mixture to stick really well, so i coated the top once in the pan- will definitely make again.

The crust on this chicken was delicious! The only mistake I made was adding a little extra salt making it a bit too salty. My family really enjoyed this very moist chicken.

I agree with Lynn; this recipe was fine, but nothing special. Keep the chicken away from any moisture, or the coating turns back into mashed potatoes!

this recipe is wonderful as is,, but after reading the reviews, I understand some of the problems. made this as written first time,, but it is way too greasy and fat from butter as a coating.  I used low fat mayo the second time. coat the chicken with the mayo and then dip in the breading.  it tenderizes the chicken and helps the breading stay intact.  also I added seasoning.. basil, paprika, and hymalayan salt, and garlic powder. the very best  way to use potato flakes..  thanx so much Diane for the recipe

Loved this.  I added garlic to the butter too.  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken as it is just the two of us.  Will be making this again.

Yummy comfort food (and by the way, gluten-free!) AND my picky daughter loves it too!! Used boneless chicken thighs, and followed the recipe with only slight "tweaks".  Used garlic flavored instant potato flakes and used half butter, half organic coconut oil just to make myself feel a little better about the calories. :) Thanks for the recipe, DCANTER!

Tried this a few nights ago and it's yummy! I also added more spices as suggested for added flavor. Will definitely make again and again. I had no problems with the coating coming off while cooking. I placed a cooling rack on a cookie sheet, then placed the chicken on the rack and baked it. Came out perfect!

I was scared that I wasn't going to like it because the last chicken I made with a little bit of Parmesan cheese I didn't like. But this was great. The only thing is that I used drumsticks and let it cook longer because it wasn't getting crispy.

This was the best baked chicken I have ever had the pleasure of making.  After reading the reviews, added  powdered garlic, salt and italian seasoning to the potato flakes and parmesan cheese. The smell of the baking chicken was amazing.  The baked chicken was just so delicious and crispy.  I baked at 395 for 1 hour.

Once in a blue moon I find a recipe that all 4 kids in our family love. This is one of those recipes. I am so glad I tried it tonight. I didn't have any garlic salt so I used Cajun spice mix instead. Also I didn't want to use the butter so I used egg whites to coat the chicken with. Everyone LOVED it!! Thank you!!

Very tasty and so simple to make. I'm new at learning to cook and so this recipe was a great starter! My girlfriend asked me how hard was it to make and I had to brag about the simple steps, which lead her into asking me to cook enough for 20 people for her parent's 30th wedding anniversary!! Wish me luck! Very good meal and enjoyed every bit of it!

This was good but didn't get as crispy as I liked. And some of the breading pulled off the bottom and stuck to the foil. It could also use a little color. Maybe next time I will add paprika to the coating, and spray the foil.

just what I was looking for.  Everyone loved it, the only problem was that I didn't make enough!  my 2 kids wanted more.  The second time I went to make it, I was out of potato flakes so I used italian bread crumbs instead and threw in some adobo and paprika~it was still delicious.  Thanks for such a wonderful and versatile recipe.

This was a good dish, but I can't help but wonder where the "herb" came from in the title when the only spice is garlic salt?  Anyway, I took the advice of other readers and added some italian seasoning and a little Mrs. Dash to the garlic salt and it was very good. The aroma in the house was wonderful! I followed the rest of the recipe to a "t", the potato flakes didn't stay on as well as hoped but they were kinda crunchy, not mushy like some others stated.  I made some stuffing and corn as side dishes.  My DH stated this recipe is a "keeper".

A great quick, easy and yummy recipe that smells delicious while cooking.  This can be easily be modified with any additional spices. I used the aluminum foil lined pan with no spray and didn't have any issues with it sticking. Just as quick to clean up!  The family loved it.  Will make it again.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! Who knew? Instant potatoes makes a delicious coating! I added about 1/4 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs, used roast garlic potato flakes, so skipped the garlic, pepper, basil, and some red pepper flakes. Cooked the chicken in lightly greased foil, with 10 minutes left I flipped the chicken and took off the foil. Crunchy goodness... Yum!

I have been using a recipe pretty similar to this, except, I use Betty Crockers Roasted Garlic instant mashed potatoes, coat the chicken, melt and drizzle the butter over the chicken. It's already flavored and the butter over the pieces help from it sticking to the foil or the pan. My family loves it and so do the friends i've told about this recipe!

This was very very good... I used boneless skinless chicken breasts so I only baked them for about 35 minutes and I added seasoning to the crust and it just turned out great! thank you.

This chicken is amazing.  The crust is light, flaky, and crunchy.  The chicken is moist.  My family asked me to make it the next day again.  This is the BEST chicken recipe I've ever made.

this was pretty good chicken! i used chicken breast tenders so it was almost like chicken fingers. i sprayed the tops of the chicken with i can't believe it's not butter spray to make the chicken crisp up and that worked well. we enjoyed this! the flavor was a little plain so i think next time i will add some more spices to the coating.

I really love this recipe, and this is how I will bake chicken for now on.  Sometimes I change it up by using different flavored instant potatos.

My entire family loved this. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and Sour cream and chives potato flakes. This make the recipe. I also tried it with a Grated Romano, Parmesan, and Asiago cheese blend - fabulous. I have also dipped the chicken in an egg wash (a little milk and an egg) both methods work well. Boneless, skinless breast only take about 35 minutes though. Try this and enjoy.   A great tip I recently learned - put a cookie rack on top of the cooking sheet, then put chicken on top of the rack. This keeps the chicken from getting soggy on the bottom.

My husband loved this so much that 1) he wished that I had made more and 2) he wanted it again the next night. I talked him into maybe once a week. I rarely get such compliments so this is definitely a keeper. We like spicy food so I added some paprika and a small amount of red pepper flakes. I used Greek olive oil instead of butter (healthier) and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing and making my night!

OMG...you HAVE to try this using Idahoan flavored mashed potato flakes...escpecially the flavored varieties...it's a no brainer..the seasoning is already in the potatoes.  Don't use any other brand though...seriously...you'll be very disappointed if you do...

I made this and it was far from crispy chicken.  We didn't even eat one breast and threw out the rest.  I did bake on rack as someone suggested.

The flavor was so-so.  My chicken, however was so moist that everything was so soft, not crispy at all.  I even used a pan with a rack to keep the drippings away from my chicken.  That texture of mush on my chicken was not appealing at all.  The day after was better with some ranch on the side.

This was delicious! Had everyone asking to make it again. I modified it a little though.  Instead of regular potato flakes and garlic, I used roasted garlic potatoes. I think next time I'll use a cheese potato and see how it turns out.  Also, instead of a whole chicken, I used boneless breasts. We never have whole chicken in the house, we usually buy boneless.

We loved this recipe. It's is a great  basic starting place for everyone. All you have to do is tweak it to your family's taste. I made ours spicy. I washed a 4.4 lb. chicken and cut it up as usual except I cut the breast into 4 pieces instead of 2. It will bake more evenly with the smaller pieces. I saved all the skin, back, rib bones,neck, and pieces to make soup. Then I rinsed and dried the parts well and coated with flour before an egg wash and then into the potatoe coating. Baked on a rack over a 9x13 dish for 52 min. and it tested 165*. It was very good and did not need turning. This will be one of our very favorite recipes.

I loved this recipe! I did use some ideas from other reviews. I cooked the chicken on a rack. I added Adobe to the recipe for more flavor and I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The chicken was moist and tasted great! I will make this again and recommend it to a couple of friends.

Excellent Recipe.  You should be able to cook it for only 40-45 min.  It is so juicy and tender.  Be sure to add egg to the butter.  It always makes batter better.  Experiment with the dry mix.  You will never wrong with this recipe.

This was amazing and the family all loved it.  I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 1/2 tsp onion powder.  I also beat an egg into the butter which made the coating adhere better.  Kicked up the heat to 400 degrees, used a rack to put the chicken on because otherwise the chicken gets mushy on the bottom from the potatoes, and cooked it in my convection oven for 45 minutes.  Perfect!  And so simple.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Excellent chicken recipe....I made a few of the suggested modifications such as adding italian seasoning, parsley, and basil as well as a little cayenne pepper for kick. I used boneless chicken thighs and served with wild and brown rice with steamed whole green beans.

The chicken was okay.  I admit that I also added paprika and a little extra of the other seasonings.  The color of the chicken came out nice and I turned the chicken over to make sure it browned all over.  But unfortunately my chicken wasn't as crispy as I hope.  The chicken tasted fine but I doubt I will make this again because I personally didn't like this enough to tweak my cooking method to suit this to my taste.  However, if this suits your tastes, this is a good base recipe to try.

Really nice recipe for oven fried chicken..I made some minor changes here as suggested by some of the reviewers (adding some spices--lemon pepper, oregano, basil) and also used it to cook some thighs and drumsticks as well. Since I'm a dark meat chicken person, I can tell you that the thighs came out very moist and yet crispy coated. This recipe really lends itself to trying different versions with switches of spices and types of seasonings/potato flakes, etc. so it will be fun to make again and again.  A family pleaser!

This chicken is GREAT! I used whole breast pieces and stuffed them with bread stuffing. Then I brushed with butter and put the mix all over the top of the chicken. My house smelled so good.

This was great....used butter flavored herb instant mashed potatoes and mixed in some grill seasoning and crushed red pepper flakes.  Used boneless/skinless chicken breasts...2 dipped in the butter and 1 sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray (for me since I'm cutting back on fat) and all turned out delicious!  I'm sure if I'd sprayed them all, they wouldn't have noticed! None were extremely crispy, but enough to be delicious.  Thank you!!

Pretty good. I took the suggestions from the another review and added paprika,cayene, italian seasoning and onion powder. I also used light marg. instead of butter and it was still great.

This is a good base recipe. I thought it might be a little bland, so I added basil, onion powder and oregano. I also doubled the base ingredients as what was required for the chicken I had wasn't enough. Smelled wonderful when it was baking and tasted even better. Even my dad, who was visiting, couldn't stop talking about how good it smelled.

This makes a good starting point. I made several changes/additions. For one thing, I ALWAYS brine chicken for a couple hours before cooking to keep it moist while it cooks. For the crumb mixture, first, I pressed 4 large cloves of garlic and mixed in dried herbes de provence in a bowl. Next the potato flakes and parmesan went in, followed by a teaspoon of potato flour and a couple tablespoons of breadcrumbs for texture. (All measurements are approximate. I believe in eyeballing). For the dip, I beat 2 eggs with a drizzle of coconut oil and a dash of lemon juice. I dip the chicken once, coat it in flour, and then flash-fry them to a pale gold-brown in the pan with some coconut oil. This also helps hold in the moisture! Once it's cooled enough to handle, I dip it a second time and coat it in the crumb mixture. The baking time worked pretty well for me, but the flakes started getting a little over-done, so I added dry flakes over the top of the chicken periodically as it baked. This was a HUGE hit ... everyone loved it! Crunchy, moist and the herbs are wonderful.

This was quite good.  I did make a few changes to give it a bit more spice.  Instead of dipping the chicken in butter, I dipped it in Ceaser salad dressing and then into the potato flakes to which I had added 1/2 c Italian cheese (instead of just parmesan), 1 t rosemary, 1 t oregano and 1 t granulated garlic.

I was searching for something quick to make with chicken breasts and found this recipe. Happening to have all the ingredients, I made it for dinner and my husband loved it. He doesn't care for garlic much, so I just used onion salt instead of garlic salt. We'll make this again!  It was easy and the chicken was tender and juicy.

This was very good, but not as 'crispy' as I had thought it would be.  But by no means were they soggy.  It baked for 60 minutes, was done, but maybe I should've let it go a little more.  I did add 1 tsp Italian seasoning and 1 tsp paprika.  I also sprayed the chicken with olive oil per another reviewer to save some 'fat'...  I will make this again.  It was an easy recipe.  Thanks!

Not bad!  I added Italian seasoning, pepper, paprika, lawry's, and used garlic powder instead of salt.  Cooked perfectly (I always use a meat thermometer, take it out at 170* and let it rest for 10 mins before serving), was juicy and the coating was flavorful.

This chicken was definately crispy but I didn't think there was enough "herb" in it so I added some Seasonall to the potato flake mixture and also used garlic powder in addition to garlic salt. This not only gave it some kick but also gave it a very nice color. Yum!! Will definately make again!

This was a good recipe, however, the outer coating was a bit on the dry side, the center was moist.  I did add a few bread crumbs and herbs to the recipe for extra flavoring (as others indicated it had a bland flavor.)  Once they absorbed the juices from the rest of the food they were served with, it became moist all around.  It had good flavor; adding the herbs is a definate must if you want herb chicken.  Next time I'll add a twist with some home made sauce and shredded parmesan on top.  I think it makes a great base recipe.

Very good starting point recipe. I added oregano, a bit of paprika, italian seasoning, and extra garlic salt. I also used half the butter and substituted a beaten egg for the rest.

I used skinless boneless chicken breasts, and dipped them twice instead of once. Then baked 45 mins, turning once, and drizzling with just a tad of butter.

Delicious and crispy!

I don't know, this was just blah. I used boneless breast of chicken and I tasted the seasoinings 10 mins. after eating it, just not a lot of flavour while eating it. I used butter and herb potatoes too. I sprayed the breasts with butter flavour cooking spray and cooked on a rack to make it cripsy and it was. Next time, I will flatten the chicken breasts, I think they were too thick. I think this made them kind of dry and chewy.
Nice idea though

This was the first time I used a "crust" kind of recipe for chicken.  I was always worried it wouldn't turn out.  This was easy and delicous!  I stuck it in the oven, pulled it out and served it.  And the chicken was quite juicy, which I didn't expect.  Thanks a lot for a fun, easy and tasty recipe!! ~Rebekah Davis

I loved it and so did my entire family.  It's fairly easy (for a man) to put together and comes out wonderfully.  Put this on your "must make" list.

This was GREAT!  I added some poultry seasoning to the mix. It had a great taste.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe a while back, and the flavor was just tremendous, I even added a bunch of seasonings of my own.  I love lots of flavor.  I used smaller  pieces of chicken, so baking time was different and they were baked a little too long.  But all in all, they were enjoyable.  Next time I will use bigger pieces of chicken.

Great chicken recipe. Easy and delicious. I followed the suggestions of NYCDAVE and added the herbs and spices. I also used only chicken breasts and they cooked in about 25 minutes. This would be perfect for company.

Be sure to use garlic salt, not just powder, or you will need to add salt.

This was a pretty easy recipe.  I did add quite a bit more spices, though.  It came out well.  I lined the pan with foil plus enough to cover.  I cooked it covered for half an hour then uncovered it for the remaining time.  It wasn't exactly crispy but still tasted good.

This recipe was in the oven within 5 minutes, an hour later, what a treat!!  I am passing this along to my son who is away at college.  I will make this again, and I will likely adlib a bit with some herbs, although it is delightful just the way it is, a nice surprise for my husband who isn't always happy being a guinea pig for my internet cooking ventures! Thank you for sharing!

Tasty and moist. Easy to make. Used grease foil. Browned nicely but wasn’t super crispy. Added seasonings based on other reviews - Italian seasoning, thyme, seasoned salt and garlic powder. Made 4 thighs and took 40 minutes.

overall my family loved it. I prepped about 10-12 wings which required me to increase the amount of dry seasoning and added garlic powder. For a crispier texture I left them in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.

I made this dish and my family love it but, "no herbs"  but I did add Italian seasoning. I also used Roasted Garlic instant potato's to add more flavor. I will make again but with more added seasonings for more flavor.

There’s a colloquial expression that I learned from a long passed elder of my family.  She was a great cook (chefs be damned) and I’ve  come to judge good food by her standard and it is this,  “So good it will make you slap your mama “.

Follow this recipe and I promise you’ll be using such silly expressions.

Not an exceptional recipe by any means , regardless of the fact  there are no herbs in this recipe  whatsoever.  Don't bother with it without adding some Iitalian spices, or whatever herbs you want.

This recipe was just okay. It seems more geared toward people who do not really know how to cook. You're better off using an egg wash and flour with spices.

Awful. Chicken overcooked, no crispy coating just dry potato. had to throw it out, inedible. I cook baked parmesan chicken at least once a week and 20-25 minutes is enough. 45 to 60  minutes is way too long.

Tasteless and not as crispy as I thought it would be.  I would add more seasonings and don't find the potatoe flakes tasty.  Family did not enjoy.

Not that great.... definitely lacking in the flavor department, and time needs adjusted, depending on your cut of chicken. Wasn't terrible, but I don't see myself trying this one again.

Very good. I used the Applewood Bacon flavored instant potato's  with parm. and it was wonderful. I lightly dusted chicken with cayenne pepper and paprika with good results. I would use a rack as well.

I soaked the chicken in Buttermilk for several hours prior to dipping it in the potato/Garlic Powder/Salt and spices and it was so juicy and tender.  This is now a staple for our family.

This was amazing!  Made a few adjustments for dietary reasons. Used boneless chicken breast, added an envelope of ranch dressing seasonings and I cooked this in the Power AirFryer!  Juicy, crispy, and tasty. Weight Watchers Smart Points = 5 in a 3oz serving.

Everyone loved the flavor. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use half Parmesan and half Romano cheese, and I also added a little bit of cayenne. I cooked it in a rack over a baking sheet but was still mushy on the bottom. I'm afraid if I turn it midway through the coating will fall off. But the kids didn't complain, so I'll be making it again.

After reading the other reviews, I added more herb seasoning to give it more flavor, and used a baking rack to position the pieces above the cookie sheet (keeps the bottom from getting soggy).

I love fried chicken, and prefer the dark meat.
However, for this recipe I would say that rather than using a cut-up whole fryer, it would be better with boneless skinless chicken breasts.

This is a good dish for something that is on a bit on the lighter/bland side.  Like most, I had to add extra herbs to my liking.  But overall it is a good starter recipe.

Delish!!  Family loved it.  Added some extra seasoning.  Watched carefully and used foil for some of the time because of all that butter.  I have a daughter with celiac disease, what a great gluten free recipe!  Will add to the regular rotation.

We are GF in our house so using GF instant potato flakes.  Have been making this recipe for years -- always good.  Cook covered and then take off cover at end to get crispier.

This was so great! However I made it with some slight differences. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken, and store bought butter herb potato flakes. I opened up the chicken and put some potato in there and then closed again for baking, and there was delicious mashed potatoes on the inside, and crispy coating on the outside. Sooo good! :)

This was OK but it sure wasn't crispy!  Followed the recipe exactly but got no "crispiness" out of it.  Probably won't make again because there are other recipes out there that I like better.

This recipe provides you with a good start for breading. However, like other cooks, I added more seasoning and herbs to enhance the flavor. I threw in some thyme, basil, salt, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, onion powder, paprika, a tiny bit of cayenne pepper, and black pepper into the breading in addition to the potato flakes and Parmesan cheese. Before cooking, I always preseason my meats with at least black pepper and garlic. I did that for about 3 hours. I baked the chicken on a rack as to reduce the mushiness of the coating. Came out reasonably crispy and tender on the inside.

This was good with several modifications.  I added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in lieu of garlic salt and 2 dashes of paprika to the breading.  I only used 1/4 cup butter and still had some left over so will use less next time.  I used drumsticks and removed the skin.  I baked the chicken on a rack in my baking pan and flipped them after 30 minutes.  

The drumsticks came out crispy all around and tasted very good.  My wife loved it.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

This was fantastic, full of flavor and tender. I took some suggestions from other reviewers and cut the butter in half. I didn't have any mustard so I mixed dry mustard with sour cream and sprinkled a bit of cayenne on top the mixture. I also increased the amount of curry to a tablespoon and only used a pinch of salt. The added sour cream gave the sauce a nice smooth texture which helped it stick to the chicken. I'll definitely make this again :)

The only flaw to this recipe is the obvious omission of actual herbs in the ingredients. The process and method are hands down the best baked "fried" chicken EVER!!

Easy to make and tasted good.  My son helped make it and liked it.  The coating turned out crispy for me in some places and soggy in others.  I added pepper and poultry seasoning for some more flavor.  I don't understand the title-- is garlic salt considered an herb??

This was wonderful, but I was in a huge hurry and didn't pay attention to the foil instructions...I thought the recipe said to cover in foil, not line the pan with it, ugh.  I baked it for 30 minutes with foil on, then 20 minutes with foil off.  The chicken was moist and tasted fantastic, just wasn't crispy - totally my fault.  I added 1/4 tsp. pepper to the potato flake mixture, and loved that addition.  I will definitely make this again (and not cover it with foil!).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good but I did make a few changes. I used 1 packet Four Cheese potato flakes (Betty Crocker) and added a teaspoon of basil and a teaspoon of parsley. I brushed on olive oil instead of butter.

Very good.  I used potato flakes and italian bread crumbs, added a little basil, and cavenders. Also, I used chicken tenderloins.  Baked on a greased cookie sheet for about 45 minutes.

The butter made the chicken very tender! However, I lowered my cooking time because my chicken pieces ere not that big.

Nice and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. My first attempt at this recipe and will definitely try it again! I took other reviewers' recommendation and added some herbs like basil, oregano & black pepper. I didn't have garlic salt, so I chopped up some garlic and added salt into it. Will get some proper garlic salt in future to compare the difference.

I never would of thought to use potato flakes.  I used the flakes and some Tony's seasoning.  Also, mixed the butter with an egg and placed severel chucks of butter around the chicken while it was cookin.  Everyone said it was very tastey!

This recipe was delicious.  The whole family loved it.  It doesn't get super crispy because of the chicken juices, but we all liked it anyway.  I followed it exactly as written, except I used chicken breasts.  Will definitely make again.

This had good flavor and potential- I actually cut into tenders so it would take less time to bake and then I turned the broiler on so that it would crisp a little. It worked a bit, but it still wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. The only other thing I changed was dipping the chicken in flour before the butter to help it stick. May try again. Thanks!

This was really good!  The texture came out crispy and kind of grainy, but it was interestingly different.  I added a little extra basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary.  It really woke up the flavor of the chicken itself.  The bottom didn't come out crispy, though.  Very mushy.  But that's my only complaint with this recipe.

I added corn flake crumbs to the mix and substitute water or chicken broth with a few tablespoons of canola oil instead of using melted margarine or butter. The chicken is still moist and delicious but now a tad healthier for the family. Next time I'll need to use to 2 chickens and add more wings!

I added Italian bread crumbs to the potato flakes and added sweet basil, Italian seasoning and red pepper. I also added some of the flake/crumb mixture over top of the chicken before cooking. The chicken came out moist, but crunchy on the outside. Its one of my husband's favorites!!

Not sure why this is called crispy "herb" baked chicken because there are no herbs in it. But it was crispy (on one side).  It was easy to prepare and clean up since I lined the baking sheet with foil as the recipe sugguested.  It was also a little on the salty side.  I think if I were to make this again (and I probably will since it's so easy) I would cut back on the garlic salt say maybe by half and add garlic powder to make up for the rest of the garlic taste.

This was delicious!  The soon to be hubby and I are on a low-fat diet (Alli plan) and so we are always looking to spice things up, but stay healthy.  We used Eat Well Stay Healthy thin sliced breasts.  Reduced fat grated Parmesan.  Smart Balance low fat butter.  There wasn't a piece left amongst ourselves and our roomie.  Next time I'll be better prepared and try coating the chicken with non-fat buttermilk instead!

I really wanted to like this because it got such great reviews. I made it with two butterflied chicken breasts and baked it at 400 for 25mins on a baking rack. The chicken was crispy, but a bit dry. I might have overcooked. I had to go out to buy the instant mashed potaotes specially for this recipe when I had breadcrumbs at home. And I couldn't make the difference between the two. Also this recipe is called crispy herb baked chicken, where is the herb in the recipe? I added paprika and thyme in the mix. I thought the parmasan was a bit overpowering. I'd suggest using less. I will not be making this again...i don't even know what to do with the 2nd pouch of mashed potatoes...we prefer real mashed potatoes.

This is a tasty and very easy chicken dish to make. My son commented that it would make a great chicken marinara with spaghetti. For some reason it didn't get as crunchy as I thought it would even though I baked it on a baking rack. Thanks for sharing.

I wish I liked this recipe more.  The flavor was good, but the chicken didn't really get crispy...and the bottom was a bit mushy.  To be fair, I might give this another try. I may have just had an "off" night in the kitchen...

Added a dash of Cookies Flavor Enhancer, thyme, 2-3 T of Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs with potato flakes to equal 2/3 c., freshly ground pepper, and not all of the garlic salt called for since Mom was eating Sunday lunch here. Jesse and her raved about how moist and tender the chicken was and said it was delicious -definite keeper.  I dipped each of the 3 boneless, skinless chicken breast 1 at a time in melted butter and then dredge through mixture. I have more than 1/2 of the mixture left so cut it in half next time you fix it.

Not sure why this is called herb chicken when there are no herbs in it. But you can easily add them.  Very easy, very yummy, this will be made again.

Very Good!  My husband loves anything with  potato in it.  I used olive oil instead of melted butter and added generously parsley flakes, dried garlic, rosemary, cayenne pepper, paprika, and freshly ground black pepper to dry ingredients.  Thanks for submitting recipe!

This was really good.  I halved the recipe because I was only doing two chicken breasts and I still have a ton of coating left.  I added some more spices (basil, parsley, and paprika as well as some salt).  Instead of using the butter I sprayed the chicken with cooking spray before coating.  I also baked on a sprayed wire rack over my baking sheet in the oven.  I love finding new ways to cook chicken.  Thanks so much!

I would give this recipe a 5 but the bottom of the chicken was soggy. The taste was good. I did have to cook it for about 8 minutes longer than the recipe said, but I think that is because all chicken pieces are different. All in all this recipe is a keeper.

Very tasty and easy. Used boneless,skinless chicken breasts and it worked great. Our only complaint was it seemed a little on the salty side but will definitely make again.

These were wonderful! I used boneless chicken breasts cut in halves and baked them for about...35 minutes, I think (I know it was less than 45). I also seasoned the chicken before dipping them in butter and rolling them in the potato buds and cheese. They came out so good!

Great tasting.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and the only thing I would change is "turn them over half way through baking" then I think they will be crispy on both sides.  Will try that next time.  Thanks

Great recipe but I found it a little too salty for my taste.  I will try garlic powder next time instead of garlic salt.  I also sprinkled a little paprika on top as suggested in another review.

I invited my parents over for dinner last night and served this dish.  They loved it!!! I had to flip my chicken mid way so that it was crispy on both sides.  I agree with other reviews, it is wise to season your chicken in additon to what the recipe calls for.  I seasoned my chicken with Lawry's Season Salt and several other spices I had available and left it overnight to absorb in the poultry. This chicken was very moist and flavorful.  This is how I will be serving crispy chicken in the future. It's a keeper!!!

I'm a huge fan of butter but the waistline, she doth protest... I've lightened this recipe up by using (3)egg whites instead, spiced up with a couple healthy shakes of hot sauce. The chicken stays super moist and I (almost) don't miss the butter.

I just made this for supper last night and I'm just now sitting down to write the review, This was a good,very good dish,you taste the mashed potatoes on the chicken but it's not overwhelming,it's a little of having two dishes in one,it's really easy to make. I'm glad I made it.

This was so good. I was worried, alot of people said it was bland. When I made it I used the romano cheese only instead of parmesan, and added some basil and italian herbs. I used some organic paprika, and I coated the chicken in some margarine. To ensure that it was not bland, I used Adobo seasoning wich is a perfect balance of garlic salt and pepper. It turned out soooo good, crispy and moist. I used chicken thighs I deboned myself and left the skin on to ensure moistness. Most def will be making it agian, my two year old ate almost a whole thigh. Is very good with a side of noodles w/marinara

It is just as delicious as the reviews state! And I have Celiac disease so this is a great alternative for me because I cannot have a normal crispy breaded chicken coating! My family loves this and we will continue to make it!

I have made this recipe (called Potato Bud Chicken in another cookbook). The only difference was that it called for seasoning salt (the orange kind).  I think it really adds to the flavor.  This was always my daughter's birthday dinner request when she was little.  Now that she's married, it was her first recipe request from me.

This is an amazing recipe!!

I bought a pre cut whole chicken and de-skinned it. 

I used butter and herb flavored potato flakes and added some onion powder and montreal chicken seasoning to the breading mixture. 

Line the pan with foil and Just pop them in the oven and don't turn them at all, they come out great! 

Super easy clean up, also.

This is sooo good.  Made as written, it would have been too salty for me.  I increased the potato flakes to 1 cup and added 1/2 tsp. of italian seasoning.  I'm looking forward to making it again and playing around with the seasonings!

I love simple recipes like this one and it was delcious to boot!!!! Instead of melted butter I used a beaten egg to dip my chicken in and then rolled it in the dry mixture. I also didn't have any potatoe flakes so I used the garlic potatoe flakes in one of those Betty Crocker instant potatoe mixes. Nice garlic flavor!!  My family loved it.

I made this recipe last night and boy was it delicous. I added in a lot of the extra spices that other reviews have mentioned and I also used boneless chicken which cut down on the cooking time a little. I think the next time that I make this I will cut the chicken into thinner strips so that it is a little more crispy. I baked it in the oven on a cookie sheet with a wire rack to help prevent the soggy effect that others had mentioned and it worked wonders.

I followed this recipe to the T and was a bit dissapointed. I think the chicken lacked flavor, however I did like the idea of using potatoe flakes for the crust, but I think it really needed something else.  Dont think I would make it again.

I made this recipe today and I have to say that it came out pretty good. I did take some other's advice and added some paprika and italian seasoning for more flavor and it was great. I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs. I will definitely be making this again.

This was THE BEST DARN oven fried chicken I've ever eaten! I added garlic powder instead of salt, pakrika, and parsley flakes besides the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it for an hour without turning any chicken pieces and it came out perfectly cooked and extremely juicy. I also love the fact there was no greasy mess. I just threw away the foil and the pans were clean.

Turned out very well and my fiance loved trying out this one! I used a potato flakes mix with onion which gave it more flavour and be sure to use fresh parmeson cheese instead of the pre grated kind. I also threw any leftover batter over the chicken before putting it into the oven.Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Yum!  This chicken was so good. Everyone loved it.  I used all skinless, boneless thighs. Just be sure to add some spices to the coating.

Made this recipe for the first time tonight with a whole cut up chicken and absolutely loved it!  It really tasted like "fried" chicken. Mine came out pretty crispy. I took the suggestion from other reviewers and added dry Italian Seasoning mix and Italian Bread crumbs, salt(instead of garlic salt since I didn't have any) and pepper (would of liked to use Paprika as well,but again, didn't have any). Had it with homemade mashed potates and corn-on-the-cob...tasted like a Southern home-cooked meal. This will be one that I make again and again.

This recipe was a little milder in flavor than what I was hoping for, but still pretty good. Actually, this is an excellent base recipe for chicken parmesan! You don't need to put any cheese on top!

Here's what I did to doctor this up:
-For the parmesan mix: I used parmesan with a little romano, added powdered garlic because I didn't have garlic salt, used some pepper to give it a little more of a kick, and added rubbed sage, crushed rosemary, and some paprika (color). I poured this on a plate and set it to the side. (I forgot to put the potato flakes in at this step).
-I heated butter with olive oil (to prevent over browning), then set that aside, making sure it stayed melted.
-I prepared an egg wash (using the same bowl that I'd mixed the cheese coating in, to give it a little spice): One egg and some milk. I then added a little more seasoning: Some garlic powder and pepper.
-Before I put any kind of coating on the chicken, I used chicken seasoning salt to give it a little flavor at the base.
-I then dipped the chicken in flour, then the egg wash, and then the parmesan mix.
-I greased a foil coated pan with the melted butter mixture and put all the chicken on.
-It was then that I realized that I'd forgotten the potatoes! So, I tossed them on the plate that had held the cheese mixture, and coated all the chicken. I found that the chicken was crisper when I didn't dip the chicken a second time in the egg wash.
-In the oven, I covered the chicken with a piece of foil (I didn'

My family loves it when I make fried chicken but, I just don't have the time anymore I'm a busy mom of 3 the youngest being 3 mos old. Anyways, this recipe is so easy, very tasty and a good substitute to fried chicken seems a bit healthier too. Followed directions as stated but, I just added a few spices to add flavor: basil, lemon pepper and an all purpose seasoning. I lined my baking pan with foil and drizzeled it w/ olive oil I didn't have a problem with the sticking that others had. Very good will definetly make again!

As simple as it sounds, it really is quite tasty. The ease of preparation is a bonus. I didn't want to use butter so I sprayed the chicken pieces with olive oil cooking spray and it turned out beautifully. I'll definitely be making this again. It was a hit at our home.

This was so yummy!! I did add some additional spices, some italian seasoning, extra garlic powder, onion powder, etc. I served it with asparagus and parmesean rice...it earned raves from my hubby, and my 2 year old loved it too...I will definitely make this again, but I will double coat it...I double dipped a couple of the pieces, but I was unsure if the breading would be too thick, so I did not double coat every piece...but the double dipped pieces were perfect! Thanks for the yummy recipe!!

Great weekday meal. I took other suggestions and added seasoned bread crumbs, italian seasoning and pepper. I also dredgged the chicken in flour, dipped in an egg/milk wash and then put on the potato mixture. then i drizzled them both with melted butter. I also baked them on a rack in a roasting pan so the air could get under them. I also baked at 400 for 20 minutes and then turned down the oven to 350 for the remaining time. I forgot to remove the skin, i usually do, but was in a hurry. I won't forget this step the next time. I would really give it 4 1/2 stars

Quick and Easy recipe did tweek it a bit though, I had bone in chicken, and I added more garlic, about 1 tsp, and parsely, and some all purpose seasoning, the coating stayed on for me, before putting it in the oven, I sprinkle paprika on the chicken.  The resuslts were fantastic.  One other note, instead of spraying the pan, I used the non stick foil, and it worked great!  My husband and son loved it.  Will make again!

This was okay, but basically it was baked chicken.  I turned at the end of cooking and most of the breading fell off! I may make again with a little tweaking.

This recipe is very good with a little tweeking. Instead of using garlic salt, I combined 1 minced clove fresh garlic with the butter and added 1 tbsp. McCormick's herb chicken seasoning with the potato flakes.  I also baked the chicken on a roasting rack to prevent it from getting soggy on the bottom as many reviewers mentioned.  Will make again!

This was a good basic recipe.  I would suggest turning the chicken during cooking, to get it crispy on both sides.  I used legs rather than mixed pieces.  There aren't actually any "herbs" in this herb chicken, but that's easily fixed.  You can add spices to your own taste (I added paprika and pepper).  The breading became slightly mushy on the bottom - and more so during reheating the leftovers.  But especially on the first night, my daughter and roommate both liked it.

This recipe was OK. I added even a little bit of Italian style bread crumbs. Still didn't have that uummpphh I was looking for. Although this is a good recipe if you are watching fat and calories. I will probably make it again sometime.

I followed the recipe exactly and think I would fiddle with it next time.  Its a good base recipe, but definately needs some more flavors.  As it is, there are no herbs in it at all.  Next time I would add some italian seasoning and try that.  It did come out with a nicely textured coating.

Mine did not get crispy on the bottom however, so I recommend turning for the last 5 minutes or so and broiling the bottom to get a completely crispy piece of chicken.  Regardless, was really good!!  Will definitely be making again!

It was pretty good - I used butter herb potatos and spiced them up some more with more seasonings and cut down on the parmesian - also I thined out the bonless chicken breasts a litte - but they turned out very moist and very good quick and easy

Great Recipe.  My husband & kids loved it.  I used skinless drumsticks and they couldn't each enough.  It was also great reheated the next day for lunch!

This was excellent. I used whole chicken breasts and baked at 400 degrees and added some Mrs. Dash as had suggested. My coating was crispy and golden brown, and the chicken was delicious! My husband loved it, and he usually doesn't care that much for chicken. This will be my main chicken dish.

I modified this recipe a bit--instead of garlic salt---I used 1/2 tsp. Adobe seasoning--1/4 tsp. dry thyme--1/4 tsp. crushed dried rosemary and I found I needed more melted butter for the 
1 1/4lbs. of boneless chicken tenders I used--but I had just enough of the potato bud mixture.
I baked this in a 400 oven for 15 mins on each side.
Very tasty --not too salty(remember parmesan cheese is salty ) and it's easier to add salt at the table if you're heavy handed with the shaker.
Will make again trying different spices in this very good basic recipe.

I added some Lawry's to the potatoe flakes and used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  It had a wonderful flavor and wasn't dry.  Easy too!  I will definately make it again.

This was good and fast and easy.  Flavor was good, maybe a little bit bland.  This could be spiced up with some herbs or seasoned salt.

Pretty bland and didn't brown well in the oven.  After eating it I wondered why it was called Crispy "Herb" Baked Chicken! Where were the herbs? Would be better if a lot of herbs and some chicken seasonings were added.  Drizzle butter over top to brown better, maybe.

I prefer the old standby, Rice Krispie Chicken.

This can't be called Crispy Herb Baked Chicken because it's not crispy and it's definitely not herbed! If you want some herbs add some oregano, basil, parsley and thyme. I prefer using this sorta parm coated recipe w/ my chicken dipped in mayo to make it juicer.

I really enjoyed this recipe, simple and very tasty. The only thing of note is there are absolutely no “Herbs” in the recipe. Garlic salt while very good is not an “Herb”I’m my opinion this should be “Oven Baked Crispy Garlic Parmesan Chicken”

Based on other reviews, I made some changes.  I added oregano, basil, onion powder and Italian seasoning.  I baked it on a cooling rack on the cookie sheet and also used boneless, skinless breasts since that's all I had.  After baking it until the desired internal temperature it still wasn't crispy so I put it under the broiler on high for a few minutes.  One piece caught on fire and was a bit too crispy but the others were quite tasty.  I will make it again, albeit with a fire extinguisher close at hand!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe except I baked it for 45 minutes at 375 degrees and 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was very crispy and brown.  My husband absolutely loved it.

This recipe as is rather bland.  And where are the herbs?  Anyone who has rated this recipe above 2 stars added multiple herbs and spices to make it a 4 star recipe.  Sorry, but I rate them as written because recipes are a repeatable process that should come up with the same outcome.  The outcome created by those who rated it 4 stars would not be the same as those who actually used the recipe as is.

Loved it.
I drizzled the leftover melted butter over the top of the chicken before putting in the oven just not to waste it. 
Fixed it twice in the last week and am going to make it again this week.

I made A slight adjustment per others recommendations but overall this is great ‘fried chicken’.  I added A bit of Panko breadcrumbs, paprika, Adobo, Italian seasoning and parsley.  Will I repeat?  You bet.

I had mashed potato flakes i had no use for so i thought i'd give this a try since reviews were promising.  I'm glad i did.  So simple to make and mine did turn out crispy.  While i think it lacked flavor, that's such an easy fix.  Will definitely be making this again.  I used a pizza pan and laid a sheet of foil the rack below to catch drippings.  I'm guessing since the pizza pan had holes, it prevented sogginess.  No sticking problem either.

Great easy recipe.  I used all the ingredients listed.  I think prep was all of 15 minutes.  The only thing that took me so long was taking the skin off the chicken legs.  I used chicken pieces from my freezer (which equaled a whole chicken) instead of buying a whole fresh chicken.  The butter I used was home made in a small handheld churn I bought on Grommet. 

I cooked it for the whole hour on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  Overall it came out well with the only dislike being the melted cheese on the baking sheet.  I used grated Parmesan but in the process I guess it combine with the butter  and then cooked to form like a skirt around each piece of chicken.  One  thing I did that was different was I used a quart Ziploc bag to coat the chicken with the dry ingredients. I coated one piece at a time.  I don't think it made any difference in how it cooked.  Everyone loved the flavor and the crunch.

I didn't have butter on hand, so I used olive oil instead. The chicken came out delicious.   I hope to try it with the original ingredient the  recipe called for butter.  I paired it with steamed spinach and mashed potatoes.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Since there are only 2 of us, I used half a chicken breast and cut it into 2 pieces. Then I cut the recipe in half. Worked well. I’m sure this will be on our table again.

Not bad. The mashed potatoe don't make as crispy a crust as a cornflake recipe I like. Very tasty, though.

This is the best oven baked chicken!! So easy to make.  I did not use the butter to reduce the calories and fat.   I used boneless breasts inside of bone in chicken.   This is a keeper!!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts that were still partially frozen at prep time so I expected the 45-60 minute bake time would be required. I set the timer for 45 minutes, then checked with a thermometer @ 38 minutes; they were all more than cooked at 175 degrees, even the thickest parts. I used “Sam’s size” breasts. Next time I will definitely check at 30 minutes bake time or use 350 degrees instead of 375. The flavor was very good. I will make again. It will be a good recipe for my son that only eats chicken.

Did not see where the "herb" was coming from so added some McCormick Monterey chicken seasoning, very tasty and crisps up well

Where did I go wrong?  My chicken turned out okay, but not crispy and not really browned - even when cooked a little longer than the recipe says. It looked nothing like the picture. The top side was sort of crisp, but the underside was mushy. Cooking any longer would have dried out the chicken too much.  If anyone has a suggestion please let me know. I love the idea, but the result was disappointing.

I made a few varations.
 made skinless boneless chicken thighs. 6 thighs in package. I used potato flakes with parmesan and roasted garlic include.

Love this recipe.  It’s easy and tastes great.   Even great when warmed up next day.   

I have many food allergies. But this is one I can have in my diet.   
Give it a try.   Well worth it !,,,

Great recipe, the chicken turns out moist and crisp. I added few extra herbs (onion flakes, a bit of rosemary) to tailor the taste slightly. Recommended.

Made a few changes - used 2/3 c potato flakes + 1/3 cup panko bread crumbs.  Eliminated the butter, instead sprayed the chicken with olive oil spray.  Added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning + 1 tsp garlic powder vs. the garlic salt.   Hubby was pleased and liked it.  Asked if he wanted me to make again and answer was affirmative.  I thought it was fine, but it was interesting that my husband like it since he is a fan of greasy fried chicken but liked this.

This was delicious!! I followed the directions to a tee and made it with sour cream potato flakes. I loved the taste and will certainly pass this along and try it again.  Even though I used foil and a light mist of cooking spray, it still stuck to the pan, so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The taste is great, but I need to fix the sticking problem as some of the flavor gets lost.

quick and very good.  The first time I made it, I did not have any parmason cheese, so used shredded cheddar instead.    I think I liked it better with the cheddar as it gave it a bit of color as well as taste.  But use whichever you prefer.  All family gave it good reviews.

Tastes good. I think it needs a little “crunch” though. Maybe add some Panko crumbs.

My daughter asked to have it everyday. The whole family loved it. 
As others mentioned, I added poultry herbs and basil. Also baked it on a rack in the pan. I've never cooked chicken that came out so tender.

I read the reviews before making this and so I added some Italian herbs and Paprika to the mix.  I also took the advice of a number of people who suggested using a cookie rack over a pan.  This all worked out well and made for a delicious meal.

I followed what was suggested by many other reviewers and added more spices. It still had very little flavor. We ended up not even eating the chicken.

I really like this recipe. Just wish I had read about using a rack, as chicken was mushy on bottom. I used garlic mashed potato flakes as that’s what I had on hand, and added a little Italian seasoning, otherwise stuck to the recipe. Will definitely make this again, it’s so easy!

This was a great recipe! My family loved it! It was easy to make and thank you so much for the nutritional information. I added a few spices to the flakes and parmigian such as a little bit of spicy Mrs.Dash and some complete seasoning and I used real butter to dip the chicken in. Add some steamed broccoli and you have a great dish.

Did not care for it...…..really never browned and left one piece in to see if it would get browner and it dried out...….most of the crust stuck to the foil in pan...….

Only 3 stars, b/c mine is waaay better!  I've been making something similar this for many years, and I call it my "Scarborough Fair Chicken".  (Remember the Beatles' hit?)  To the breading mixture I also add (get ready...) parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme.  Seriously, this recipe needed a slight boost, and adding these herbs took it over the top.

This chicken was the hit of the potluck. I used chicken tenders instead of full breasts. The 1st time I did it right from the recipe. Yummy!
The next time I decided to try dipping the tenders in egg instead of butter before breading and it was just as good. Everyone loves this dish.

Only gave 4 stars because I changed it quite a bit.  But the main thing I learned was that potato flakes and grated fresh parmesan make a great, delicious, crusty and gluten-free breading for chicken.  I couldn't  bring myself to remove the skin because most of the chickeny goodness is in the skin.  With the skin on, there's already plenty fat, so I replaced the melted butter element with my old standby  for dipping breaded chicken, italian salad dressing.  This time I used creamy Italian (thinned with a very little water).  I also added italian seasoning to the breading.  Then with all those changes I gave it a 5-star rating here at home.

I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasonings before dipping it in butter.  I did make some changes to the recipe which may have resulted in the chicken being a little too salty.  In the future, I will try the recipe close to as is.  There was a crispy coating that I enjoyed but I did think the chicken became a little too dry.  This is probably because I used chicken breast that I cut into big strips.  In the future, I will cook the chicken for less time.  I will say that I did not really taste the potatoes at all and I was looking forward to tasting potatoes.

I tried to d this recipe with chicken tenders doesn’t work. You need something that needs more coking time like what the recipe calls for which s a whole chicken with bones. You need to cook for a full hour to get the browning and Chocken tenders don’t require that much cooking time. Also I didn’t forget dnd the flavor very satisfying. I salt and peppered the tenders fist and also added onion powder as well as garlic salt but it just didn’t have enough flavor for me.

The chicken was very good - not because of the recipe, tho - This one could have been greatly improved with a few changes.  Salt and pepper to name one.  Also - The chicken should be dipped in egg yolk instead of butter - then use the butter in the pan. The egg yolk will seal in the juices a bit, and keep the chicken juices from turning the potato flakes into mashed potato's.  Better yet - Use panko bread crumbs.

I am going to try to double dip it next time to see if  I can get a thicker and crispier crust. But it was delicious just as it's written out.

This was easy and very tasty. I am not much of a cook and this was right up my alley. I used breasts instead of chicken pieces. May add a little spicy pepper to the mix next time.

I wasn't too impressed with this. Tasted dry and no crisp to it. Not sure if I'm a fan of dried potatoes on chicken. Possibly would be good if adjusted? Could have used more herbs. Definitely needs some work.

I made the dish last night; the flavor was very good and the meat moist. Since the title is "crispy herb," i wondered if the herb was omitted from the recipe!  The finished product was not as golden as the photograph; nonetheless very good. I'll try it again with a modification or two.

This is just delicious!  That's all I can say. I did sprinkle some paprika, thyme and rosemary to add some herbs since there really were none and it was great. I've used cayenne pepper as well. I've also tried soaking the chicken pieces in buttermilk with the seasoning and then using the potato flakes for coating. I've made this recipe so many times adding different things.  I use the copper chef roasting basket on a cooking sheet and it stays crisp on all sides. Can't go wrong with this basic recipe.

good basic recipe to start from.  i added some herbs and spices to the breading (thyme, rosemary, paprika, pepper, salt) but really loved the potato flakes as the base.  very yummy and mine turned out nice and crispy!

I took a risk and made this for the first time while making dinner for my parents. We all really liked this! My Dad couldn't believe it was oven baked and not fried. And my 5 year old ate every bite! I used garlic potato flakes and added some Italian breadcrumbs, onion powder, garlic salt, pepper, and paprika. After dipping them in the coating I sprinkled the rest on top.  I baked it on foil and turned them halfway through.  It had great flavor and wonderful crispiness! Not mushy at all. Will definitely make again!

Everyone loved this!  The amount of butter & coating were spot on, and the coating crisped up well.  I lined a metal pan with parchment paper and it worked well.  A huge hit, will make this again!

Like some of the other reviews, mine ended up a little mushy on the bottom.  I will make again and add some spices and turn it half way through baking. Very easy to prepare.

On its own this is a great gluten free option to fried chicken. I used chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken cut up. I dipped the chicken in gf flour and then a buttermilk wash before rolling in the potato flakes. I heavily seasoned the potato flakes with oregano and basil. My family finished all but two of the thighs! I have a large family, 5 children and my husband and everyone loved this! Our whole family has been gluten free for 11 years and this is the first crispy baked chicken recipe the whole family has enjoyed.

My family loved this chicken - will definitely make this again! Basically the coating gives the crispness but add more spices if you want to kick it up a notch.

Made chicken per receipt and would not make it again. All this receipt does is coats Chicken in crackers but adds nothing to the basic taste of chicken ; only the cooked texture is modified. The receipt should add in some flavoring to the cracker coating to enhance the blan final product.

Great recipe, have been making this with the same ingredients except parmesan with pork chops with added thyme to taste, which i made the chicken and it turned out great. Next time i will put the  chicken on a cooling rack to bake to make sure the underneath is crisped.  It is quick and easy

I followed the recipe as written.  I found it bland and I did not like the crispy potato crust taste.  I do love fried chicken and have been looking a alternative methods.  My husband had the same reaction.  It was OK but left me wanting more flavor.  I did use the leftovers in chicken salad with Best Foods mayo and celery.  I added some green chives, fresh ground pink salt and pepper and some salted cashews.  It was delicious.

You can also use panko breading which what I have switched to from bread crumbs. My herb flavoring is italian blend but one can add any combination finely chopped up into the breading coating. ( I blend all flavor and seasoning into the breading to save time)

I seasoned it really good...that is all it had going for it.  If you like your chicken with mashed potatoes mixed up on it...you will like this.  I couldn't get it remotely crispy...and the bottom was just seasoned mashed potatoes.  
I used some Rosemary and garlic seasoned parm I had in the fridge...gave a little extra.

This was okay.  I used drumsticks, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was not crispy, and to potatoey for me.  However, it was much better the next day.  I am going to try this again but use bread crumbs instead of potato flakes.

I did not like the way this one turned out. The potato flakes came out mushy and did not cling to the chicken like crispy fried chicken skin.

Great recipe and easy to prepare. I used skinless chicken breast and it came out great. My kids actually thanked me for dinner. I did not have garlic salt and so i improvised with a little pepper and chicken seasoning. Will surely make again.

So Yummy!  Added Nature's Seasoning and garlic powder to the flakes and cooked it on the broiling pan.  Crispy and Juicy!

I can't believe how flavorful this is!  I followed this recipe to the letter, did not add or omit anything, and my chicken drumsticks turned out tastey.  (I used olive oil to coat my baking dish and it did not stick).  One tip I would give though is to lay the cut part of a the chicken downside in the baking dish, so the blood can drain off while cooking...Otherwise, blood will get infused with the crust while baking.

This was so delicious! I usually make this with bread crumbs using a different recipe. But I decided to try it with the potato flakes and I like it so much better! It had great flavor and it makes a very easy, delicious meal. I will be using potato flakes instead of bread crumbs from now on!

Erm... Where is the herb? The idea of using potato flakes was great but other than that, the overall taste was pretty bland and ordinary... Don't think I will do a repeat of this.

Had three chicken legs that wanted eating. The ratio of flakes to cheese is 2 to 1 (easy-peasy!), so 2 T flakes, 1 T parmesan, a few shakes of Italian seasoning.  I skipped the butter - the mix stuck to the chicken just fine without it - and just put a bit of olive oil in the baking dish.  Nothing difficult about this, so it's perfect for busy nights and it can be tweaked all over the place with just what I have in the pantry. This is going in my file for sure!

I thought this smelled & tasted quite good - my one complaint being that the skin on mine didn't crisp. However the boyfriend loved it & didn't think a thing should be changed. I see some people cook it at a slightly higher temp? That might improve the skin. Overall, a tasty recipe and a keeper.

Very good. I will be making this recipe again. My husband loved the coating. I used boneless breasts, and did overcook them, so they were a little dry. Next time I'll have to reduce the cooking time.

Such a good, easy recipe. I only buy boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and they worked well. I seasoned the chicken pieces with poultry seasoning before topping with mixture. I added some bread crumbs to the dry mixture, along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. I baked the chicken on a baking rack on top of a cookie sheet to allow the bottom to crisp. Definitely a keeper.

did exactly as recipes says, wonderful.  Before dredging chicken through mixture, cube some potatoes, spray with pam, and sprinkle over the top, turns out wondeful and you won't waste the mixture.  But spread mixture BEFORE you dredge chicken through.....also thinking of trying it over green beans....

It was absolutely delicious and easy to make!  The only mistake I made was to add some salt so bits of it became very salty.  I served it with garlic bread and garden salad and my family loved it!  Will certainly be making it often.

This was very tasty, but I did make modifications, which is why I only rated it 4 stars.  I did an egg white wash, omitted garlic salt and opted for potato flakes that were flavored with garlic.  I also used olive oil spray to periodically during the baking to make it crispier.  It's great the next day over mixed greens!

My family really enjoyed this.  It's easy to make.  Even with some of the added spices, as suggested by the reviews, I also used garlic powder instead of the salt to cut down on sodium.  Later in the week I used it on pork chops in the oven and it turned out great as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  I did add some Italian Seasoning and some onion powder to the coating mix.  I was dissappointed that the coating did not stick to the chicken, but I did not skin it first.  Will try that next time.

Very nice option for baked chicken.  I tried it with the seasoned breadcrumbs added as suggested by another reviewer and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  "A keeper" is what we would call it.

This was a good recipe.  Really needs tweaking to make it more flavorful, but the chicken was moist and tender.  I used thighs, as that is what I had on hand. Can't say I would make it again as I like bread crumbs better than the potato flakes.

Really simple recipe that tastes awesome!  I made mine with Panko bread crumbs though to skip a trip to the store.  The cheese in the mix is excellent, I'll prob. make chicken parm out of it next time. Oh, I also added some black pepper and paprika to the dry ingredients for some extra flavor.

this was good - I followed other's suggestions about using different herbs - Italian seasonings etc. - I used boneless chick breasts and they did not seem to need a full hr., but for the coating to get nice 'n brown, it did seem to - I would try higher temp and less time next time !

A yummy dish!  I followed some other advice and added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning and 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning.  I also sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with PAM.  Came out very crispy.  I will definitely make this again.

It was good and definitely one my family will want me to make again.  Not terribly refined, but the kids liked it.  The mashed potato flakes I had were flavored, so I think mine would have been better with garlic powder rather than the strength of garlic salt.  Next time I will try to cook it on a baking rack, since the juice from the chicken actually formed little blobs of mashed potatoes around the chicken, which don't brown very well.  Overall, the taste was a lot like KFC, which leads me to believe that the heavily guarded secret recipe might contain a powdered version of dehydrated potatoes!

This recipe came out very good. As another reviewer suggested, I tried using flavored instant potatoes. It did come out a little bit salty so I might try plain potatoes next time. Other than that it was great!

Oh man this coating beats the standard bread crumbs any day. I also like how versatile it is- you can add any herbs OR cheese you desire. Baked @ 400 degrees on a rack for almost an hour, turned halfway through. Perfect. Will be making this again.

This chicken turned out awesome for the amount of work it requires.  I tried it on a group of about 50 and it was as easy as any other chicken recipe I normally use.  Not really an "HERB" recipe though you could easily your own mix to this exelent base recipe.  BTW i used margerine instead of butter and it turned out great!

This was okay.  I know the "skin" was potato but for some reason I expected this to taste different then potato covered chicken.  I added paprika, basil, and pepper, and I'm glad I did because this would have been really "blah" otherwise.  Sorry!

Loved this! Even our 2 year old ate it all up. I made it with 6 large boneless chicken breasts instead. I made the dry mix 1/2 potato flakes and 1/2 breadcrumbs. I also added 1 tsp Italian seasoning, and a 1/2 tsp each of: paprika, black pepper, and basil. Excellent dish!

This was ok, but I don't think I'd make it again.  Putting it under the broiler the last few minutes is a must.

Not the best breading, in my opinion.  It was fairly bland w/o the added seasonings & mine came out a bit soggy - just like eating mashed potato covered chicken! I even put some bread crumbs in it and put it back in the oven, for a bit longer, and then it was ok at best.  Won't be making this again.

I have made a very similar dish and instead of coating the chicken in butter/margarine I have used egg- cuts down on fat.. similar taste... yum!

This is definitely a keeper! Everyone in the family cleaned their plates! We followed some of the previous reviewers' suggestions and added crumbs and Italian seasoning, paprika and black pepper. We didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, but put some seasoned croutons through the food processor to make the crumbs. We'll be sharing this recipe with everyone in our family! Thanks!

Great recipe with such an interesting taste!!!! So good! The only thing that I did different was added some italian seasoning, bread crumbs and I left the skin on the chicken. Another family favorite to add to the list.

I did do what others had said and added italian seasoning to the breading.
Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe last night for my family and a guest. The only alteration I made was to add some poultry seasoning with a little mesquite in it. HUGE hit ...they ate it all. I made boneless strips so the cooking time was reduced. Great recipe!

This is certainly Crispy Chicken! Please be advised that you must add your own blend of spices/herbs to make it flavorful! I seasoned my chicken after skinning and washing it with Tony Chachere's, freshly cracked pepper and a few herbs. I used a Parmesan/Romano cheese blend which was a really nice touch. I served this with rice pilaf and mac & cheese. I'd make this again for a quick-less mess alternative to fried chicken. Thanks for the recipe =o)

My chicken came out rather dry. It might be because I instant potatoes instead of the flakes. I couldn't find flakes here in Sweden. Anywhoo....I don't think that I will be making this again.

This tasted great!! Although my brother and cousin wouldn't stop commenting on how it looks like shake 'n' bake!! But everyone liked it a lot. It was really easy, which was awesome. At first, my brother didn't want any meat, but afterwards, he said, "I want more chicken; I didn't know it was going to taste that good"!! THANK YOU!!!!!

Such an easy recipe!  The chicken wasn't as crispy as I expected it to be. The mashed potato flake topping gave the chicken a hearty flavor without the weight of breadcrumbs in typical breaded chicken. I added extra spices as well after reading the reviews. I added paprika, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.

This was okay.  It was quick and very easy, but I am wondering how to turn the chicken in the pan without the crust coming off even when the pan is sprayed.  If the crust did not come off, I would have rated much higher.

Now I made a few changes to this recipe, so bear with me!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts & roasted garlic flavored potato flakes.  Also I added paprika, italian seasoning, and black pepper to make it a bit more "herby"  Well, it was tasty, but a little bit dry because I think the potato sucked the water out of the chicken!  I think the reason I thought it was so good was because I made a side dish with red sauce that helped to rehydrate the chicken as I ate it!  So, I guess the moral of the story is - add some sauce and it's fabulous!
----
Edit - I made this recently with drumsticks and it was awesome!  I guess I recommend against just chicken breasts b/c it ends up dry.

This is definately a nice idea. The potato flakes give it a great texture, but it needs more seasoning. I added 1 tsp of italian seasoning. Next time I think I'll use garlic powder and a little salt. The garlic salt made it little too salty for my taste.
