These pancakes do NOT bubble like regular pancakes.  They are a very hearty, thick pancake.  You also HAVE to add the blueberries/fruit BEFORE you cook them. I put 1/4 of the batter on a lightly greased pan (cooking spray) and spread it out until it's about 1/4 inch thick. It will not spread on it's own like a regular pancake. My husband can eat two maybe three. That's how filling they are. I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does!

Wow! These were great! Instead of using the oats as-is I ground them in the blender. It was delicious! To try it this way double the amount of oats used(I halved the recipe so I ground 2 cups) and just set your blender or food processor on a high speed and grind for about 1 minute and voila! I also threw in a handful of sliced strawberries. Great recipe! Thanks HJWilson!

This is interesting.  It's a twist between an oatmeal breakfast cookie and a pancake.  Very dense texture.  I wanted a finer texture in our pancakes so I threw everything in the blender to turn the oats into a flour texture.  I also only added 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and I halfed the oil and used canola oil instead of coconut.  (that much fat and I'm going to eat it in chocolate!)  I also added a little more skim milk.  When you put it on the griddle I took a spoon and spread it thiner otherwise they are so dense they will just be doughy.  Used frozed blueerry, thawed them and added them to the mix.  I also crushed them into the dough.  If you leave them as whole berries the rest of the dough has a hard time cooking because it's lumpy from the berries.  On the whole it was good.  Very filling.  I would eat them just as a breakfast cookie.  I'm going to try freezing them in baggies.

These "pancakes" were so tasty!  They reminded me of Amish Baked Oatmeal, only made with much healthier ingredients.  We ate these tonight with free-range scrambled eggs and more than once I had to tell my kiddos to close their mouths -- their "Mmmm"s and "Oh Yum"s while chewing was a bit gross. :)  We didn't have any berries, so I finely diced up a slightly bruised and softening organic pear.  Also, I melted the coconut oil, but it reconstituted as I added in the other wet ingredients.  I just made sure to blend it well before I added the wet to dry, and the little chunks of coconut oil melted away as the pancake cooked.  Next time I make these, the melted coconut oil will be the last thing I add.  We loved these SO MUCH -- we'll absolutely be making them again at mealtime and for snacks.

Loved these!  Lately I've really been reducing my flour and processed sugar intake and these were perfect!  I didn't have blueberries and substituted half the honey with agave syrup.  Made half a batch and it was perfect for me and my husband!

Great wheat free recipe! Thank you.  I used one chopped up banana in place of the blueberries.  My 3 year old kept coming into the kitchen and grabbing them to eat plain!  I used 1 cup oats and 1 cup oat flour for a little more pancake like texture.  Loved the coconut flavor from the oil!

I made the recipe exactly as written and these were very good.  They don't bubble.  You have to flip them despite them looking wet on the top.  They flip easily.    I loved them.  
       
I then made another batch and this time I reduced the honey to 1/4 cup and I did not use the coconut oil.  I was trying to get them to have less calories and fat.           

The first time made 13 pancakes,  at 120 calories each.  After the changes I made 11 pancakes at 90 calories each.    

The reduced honey and not using the coconut oil didn't make a difference. The pancakes taste the same.

I really liked them.  You can't just eat one.

I took some liberties such as using two eggs instead of four egg whites, a mix of brown sugar and honey since I was low on honey, and canola oil instead of coconut oi because I couldn't find any. They didn't hold together very well, but they still tasted wonderful.

These pancakes were sensational! I made a few changes, but they were very simple and pancakes still turned out AWESOME. I pureed the oatmeal in a blender to give me 2 cups worth, substituted plain almond milk in place of milk, olive oil rather than coconut oil, and because I was out of vanilla extract I used french vanilla flavored liquid stevia. I also folding in the blueberries before pouring batter on to skillet. Delicious recipe...I will definitely be making these again. :p

I was looking for some recipes using coconut oil, since it is so healthy, and I'm so glad that I found this one.  These pancakes are delicious, much better than traditional pancakes.  Here are some of the reviewer suggestions that I either followed or did not follow, along with my own advice.  I did grind the oats in the blender before using them, but I did not double the amount, as one reviewer did.  I measured the two cups before grinding, and used the proceeds. To melt the oil, I took a heaping amount of oil on a serving spoon, put it in a glass measuring cup and microwaved for a little under a minute.  The liquid amount was a little bit less than a quarter cup so I added a bit more coconut oil and it melted on its own, without additional microwaving. I did not want to miss out on all of the nutritional benefits of egg yolks, so I used two whole eggs. I mixed the blueberries into the batter, some of them popped out when cooking, and some stayed in.  The oil that I used in the pan was coconut oil. These pancakes are just loaded with healthy ingredients, taste great and are so satisfying with a relatively small portion.  I did put a small amount of maple syrup on them, but hardly any is needed, for my taste.

These are very tasty, but much more like breakfast cookies than pancakes. They are very thick and hearty and do not bubble like regular pancakes. I needed to form the batter on the griddle as it did not immediately spread out. The blueberries needed to be pushed into the pancakes. Thanks for a tasty recipe.

The kids like it and we will try them cold on a future day.  (Also made some with banana).  I used 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites, canola oil instead of coconut oil and rice milk instead of milk.  Also, used raw honey because that's what I have. It seems very sweet, so perhaps less will be needed next time.  Great option for a health(ier) breakfast!

I've made this twice and I've come up with some changes to suit my taste better. This makes it a softer, moister pancake. 
1. Grind oatmeal in a blender.
2. Add a pureed ripe banana (I might try 2 next time) to add moisture.
Overall, this is filling, easy, and yummy :)

The flavor was good but I didn't care for the texture.  I will try them again but this time, I will grind up the oatmeal to make oat flour so it will be a lighter texture.  It will aslo be easier to put the pancakes into the pan.... I hope!

Really delicious! Thanks for creating this recipe HJWilson! As some others recommended I threw the oats in the blender to create a coarse type of oat flour. I also used 2 whole eggs instead of whites. Otherwise the recipe is just great as is. It's a great use for my new jar of coconut oil and a very healthy alternative to the typical white flour pancake.

I was looking forward to making this but was pretty disappointed.  The pancake was slightly salty for some reason and otherwise dry and lacking in flavor.

Made these without blueberries because I was without them. I did pulverize the oats in the food processor. These were really good. I guess the pulverizing made them less oatmeal like, because they did not taste like either oatmeal or regular pancakes. They did get "crispy", but softened up once I added butter. I think I may add some apple cinnamon instant oatmeal next time, and take out the sugar. Definitely better than white flour and/or pancake mix.

Very tasty. Read the reviews by others and ground up the oats in our Magic Bullet. I didn't have honey so I substituted with light syrup, and used "I can't believe its not butter" margarine instead of the coconut oil. I added walnuts and bananas to the mixture. Own their own they taste a little on the dry side and very "oat-y" but with syrup they taste great!

This was excellent! I personally feel you don't have to have the fruit inside the pancake, cause I just dumped a bunch of strawberries on top and it was fabulous! You don't even have to add syrup to them. The issue I ran into was I added the milk ( I substituted almond milk ) to the coconut oil, it solidified, so I had to mix it again, but the tiny pieces melted as I stirred, so it was fine. Great for a cold morning ;-)

We made these when a friend visited who is allergic to gluten.  The kids ate them and they were delicious.  I think I'll make extras to have for snacks.  I used regular, not quick cooking, oats and didn't have berries, so did without them.

I used this recipe when a friend who can't eat wheat stayed with us, and we loved it!  We make it now on a regular basis for ourselves.  I love that you don't need any special ingredients to make it.  Thanks!

Everyone I've made this for has LOVED these pancakes! I substitute vegetable oil for coconut oil and have used Agave nectar instead of honey. I've also processed the oatmeal as others have suggested and added a few walnuts before doing so. The pancakes freeze well and make for a yummy, quick breakfast when you're on the run.

This is a great portable breakfast. I've tried making just one or two servings at a time, but it doesn't hold together as well. What does work well is making the entire batch and wrapping serving sizes to take to work for reheating.
I just use an egg rather than egg whites, and use applesauce in place of oil. The spices and fruit can easily be varied.

These are great! I was only making enough for myself, so I used the calculating tool on the site to adjust to one. I ground the oatmeal in my little bullet blender then added everything to the container and let it run for a couple of seconds. I used a whole egg instead of the egg white, and added about a tablespoon of flax seed as well. Stirred in the blueberries by hand and poured it into the pan. Easy and delicious!

Amazing.  The kids loved these!  They thought they were better than regular pancakes for sure!  We only had 2 eggs, so we used the whole eggs - whites plus yolks - and that was fine. We were nervous about having no flour, so we sprinkled a little in.  We took the advise of another reviewer and added the blueberries to the mixture instead of placing on top.  Set the griddle to 325 degrees.  Can't wait to make again! ...oh, used canola oil not coconut.

I put all the ingredients in my Vitamix and the pancakes were fabulous!!!  They are very filling, so the single batch fed our family of four.  So glad to have a healthier option for pancakes... Gluten Free, too!

Yummy! I was a little skeptical at first, because I've never tried oatmeal pancakes that I like. This one is definitely a keeper. I made a few changes. I used 1/2 a cup old fashion oats (because it's healthier) I kept the cinnamon and baking powder the same. I didn't add the salt. I used 2 egg whites instead of four (I was only making 2 pancakes) I added an extra TBS. of milk, I used extra virgin olive oil instead of coconut oil, I kept the vanilla the same and the blueberries. I added 1/2 of a scoop of my cinnamon protein powder to make it healthier. Thanks for sharing 8) Yum! I'm enjoying them right now 8)

These are great! We used whole rolled oats, so they were a little more dense and chewy like a breakfast cookie. We like to spread peanut butter and raisins on them and serve apple slices to make them more like a meal. mmmm. - i think the honey causes them to burn a little more easily, so watch them closely

We had just picked fresh blueberries and my son wanted pancakes. I didn't want to feel like I was eating dessert for dinner, and sometimes that's how I feel with pancakes. I looked around, saw this recipe and gave it a shot. 
Took the advise of other reviewers and put the flour in a processor for a finer texture. Also blended some blueberries in the batter then tossed a few handfulls of whole blueberries in and mixed them. 
As long as u keep a timer of 2 1/2 minutes around and flatten them a wee bit when first placed on the griddle, u won't have a problem with doughy cakes.Keep them relatively small too so u don't have a problem with breaking as they flip. 
Wonderful recipe. My entire family loved it and ate them right up. I will certainly be making them again and adding nuts, seeds, an fruits of all sorts when I do. I can see these breakfast pancakes being an awesome breakfast bar as well. 
Thank u for your research and thank u for sharing!!

These were very good!  The only changes I made - I used two whole eggs instead of whites, real maple syrup instead of honey & I stirred frozen wild blueberries right into the batter.  I served them to my six year old twin boys w/out any added syrup and they loved them as did I!  This recipe is a keeper for me.  Thank you HJWilson!

These were delicious!  My husband thought thy were too grainy, so next time, I may try putting the dry ingredients in the food processor.  I thought they were very good, though.   I did not have the coconut oil, so I used canola oil and added a little bit of coconut, which tasted great.  I also used 2 extra large eggs instead of 4 egg whites.  It worked just fine.  I would definitely make these again.

Great recipe!! I like other ground up the oats but I only ground up half of them. I added a little extra milk and some shredded coconut. Used nutmeg instead of cinnamon cause my wife is allergic to cinnamon. I smashed the blueberries and mixed in batter before. Kids loved them too!!

I started making this recipe a couple of months ago, and it is now our go-to recipe for pancakes!  I just removed one star because of the two tiny changes I make.  I add a banana and use 2 whole eggs instead of 4 whites.  I also run the entire mix (before adding the blueberries) through the blender (we have a Vitamix, not sure how it would do in a regular blender).  I have had no trouble flipping or seeing the bubbles to indicate doneness as some reviewers have mentioned.  Definitely give these a try!

These are amazing! Next time I'll try a little less coconut oil to save some fat and tone down the coconut flavor a bit. They taste a lit like the oatmeal pancakes my favorite breakfast place makes.

Exceeded my expectation, really good.  I ground my oats in my mixer as others had suggested, and used canola as my oil and added about 1/2 cup of applesauce to add some moisture. Yum!!  Thanks for the recipe.

LOVEEEEE this flourless oat pancake! I skipped out baking soda since I don’t have any, but it turned out just fine! I might want to reduce the amount of honey cause it’s a lil bit too sweet for me. Overall this is a very nice GLUTEN FREE pancake. Will make another batch some other time!

I’ve been looking for a recipe like this for a couple years,  after having some oatmeal pancakes at a locally owned breakfast place nearby. Typical oatmeal pancakes don’t have the oat consistency I was searching for, so when I saw the pictures in this recipe, I knew I had to try it out and see if it was a match - it matched and even exceeded my expectations!

I'm on the fence with these... however, my daughter and nephew loved them. I made a couple changes so perhaps they would have been better as written. Decreased honey to 1/4 cup, omitted coconut oil (didn't have any) and used 1-T of canola oil and 1-t of coconut extract instead. Also used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites and did not add blueberries to the batter. They were good, just not great. I agree with other users that call them hybrid pancake-cookies. I've dubbed them "pancookies". They are hearty with a dense texture. I follow weight watchers... with my changes, the recipe yielded 8 1/4-cup pancookies that were approx 3.5 to 4-points each. Served with blueberries and bananas.

It was okay.  It didn't taste like a pancake.  More like a fried oatmeal cookie with blueberries.  It was easy to make and healthier than a normal pancake.

Turned out so yummy! I substituted almond milk for the regular milk. I had to add extra to thin out the batter. It was a great gluten-free, dairy-free breakfast!!

Like others, I ground the oats and added the blueberries to the batter and slightly increased the milk. Used sugar instead of honey. Prior to adding the berries, I made some with no fruit. They had a nice cinnamon flavor. Will definitely try some additional modifications to make them more "regular" pancake-like.

I also ground up the oats into more of a powder and added in 2 oz of blueberry yogurt for moisture. I didn’t have enough honey so I used part honey part maple syrup for sweetness. These are healthy and ACTUALLY TASTE GOOD TOO! Win!

This is my favorite GF pancake recipe, and like them much better than even conventional pancakes. These are very hearty and have a really unique texture. So addictive! I prefer reducing the amount of sweetener and I'll often vary the fruit. If you omit the sweet ingredients all together, they make really good savory pancakes when served with sour cream and caramelized onions.

We really enjoyed these. Guided by other reviewers, I put one cup of the oats in a food processor and added in the other cup whole - though on reflection might not bother next time.  I also used two whole eggs.  I did not have coconut oil so used regular oil and used artificial sweetener instead of honey for the diabetic in the household.  I ended up adding about 1/4 cup of extra milk though the batter was still thick.  The fresh blueberries put this treat over the top delicious. These are heavy textured and very filling.  No syrup needed - they were rather like oatmeal cookies without the richness (calories) of the butter.  Will definitely make again.

I used old fashioned oats and 2 eggs instead. I also cut the honey in half.  I put frozen blueberries on them as they were cooking. Served with pure maple syrup. Yes, these were a bit heavy but I was ok with that. This recipe was pretty much exactly what I was looking for.

Wasn't sure what to expect but this recipe turned out much better than I thought it would! The pancakes were moist and very flavorful. I halved the recipe and added 1 tbsp of ground flax. I will definitely make this again. I may even try baking it in a ramekin next to have breakfast muffins on the go.

Just made it with 1 cup ground oats and 1 cup quick oats. Didn't have blueberries but subbed chocolate chips for them and maple syrup instead of honey. My family devoured the whole batch and asked me to make a double batch next time. Super fast and healthy meal! Will definitely make it again!

Yum! I used a little less salt and no sweetener, and griddled them without the blueberries. I had to use half-and-half for lack of milk. They work well with regular rolled oats. I topped the finished pancakes with thawed banana slices (they are like syrup!) and blueberries. Delicious!

Wow this was so delicious! It was better than flour pancakes to me. Like another reviewer, I made it with ground oats so it was less textured than the picture. Can't wait to make it for the family.

Excellent!  And good for desserts. I substituted vanilla for almond and added almond pieces. I wanted extra for the week so I added 1/8c more milk for reheating. I have made these twice now and the flat top skillet is the way to go. I have also substituted apples for blueberries. Delicious!  Tastes like an oatmeal apple crisp/ pie. This will definitely stay in my back pocket.

I love these pancakes, because they have no sugar, and are super easy to make. This is my third time making them!

I always make birthday breakfasts for my kids, but my youngest wanted pancakes and I was out of flour, so we tried this recipe. I was out of oil, so I used butter and I used half honey and half maple syrup because I was low on honey also. I also used some frozen, diced apples instead of blueberries. They turned out amazing. Next time, I will shred the apples first. The big chunks I had cut them into were too big for the pancakes. This is a great recipe to play around with! Also, if you buy gluten free oats, it's already gluten free

I cut the recipe I half and made a couple slight changes. I ground the whole oats, I added 1 whole egg instead of egg whites, and I used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce in place of the oil. It was slightly more dense but very good pancakes.  I enjoyed mine with sugar free blueberry syrup. Thank you for sharing!

It gets 5 stars for taste (no syrup needed!) but this is a poor showing of a pancake.

Loved the texture. Added a dash of nutmeg. Flavor was great. 
Next batch will have some chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chips.

I've made them as is and using 1 cup oats, 1 cup flour and 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites (just to use ingredients on hand) and they are amazing! The flavor is great!

Great taste. Would also add blueberries before cooking to help batter cook evenly.

My kids and I really enjoyed these!  My only change was to grind the oats into a flour.  Very tasty alone or with syrup!  Thanks for sharing.

Just knowing that my kids think they're getting to eat cookies for breakfast makes these a wonderful addition to our recipe box. I only had old fashioned oats on hand, but also had baby oatmeal. I mixed some of the baby oatmeal in for a binder and it worked perfectly. Used an additional teaspoon of almond extract. Loved them! I will try lemon zest and juice in them the next time. These are a keeper!

This recipe turned out "pan-fried oatmeal" rather than "pancakes" for me. I used the adjustments mentioned by other reviewers but didn't grind the oats into flour, which I think is essential for binding, otherwise, they just fall apart. The blueberries on top also make the "cake" way too wet when they're turned over. But the taste was wonderful and I still ate the pile of oats and berries on the plate! I've been looking for a gluten-free but hearty breakfast treat, so will probably try these again with major modifications.

Delicious!  Nice and sweet!  They're a little more dense than normal pancakes but still delicious. I didn't melt the oil and I blended the mixture. Definitely recommend.

These were as good as I had hoped. I made a few minor changes to suit our own taste, but otherwise made the recipe as stated. They were sweet and delicious even before syrup and very filling! I'll try grinding the oats in the food processor next time as some others have done. Overall, we really loved them!
