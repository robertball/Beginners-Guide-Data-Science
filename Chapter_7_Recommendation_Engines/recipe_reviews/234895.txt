I halved the recipe and it still filled my crock-pot. I did use the whole onion, green bell pepper. It is a pretty meaty and bean chili, not heavy on the tomatoes or tomato sauce for those that want more meat and bean chili. The flavor was a good balance and not spicy hot. I went ahead and added in my whole 7oz. cans of El Pato and tomato sauces, and it was still a pretty thick and meaty base. I didn't have Mexican stewed tomatoes but a 10 ounce can of diced tomatoes and green chilies was perfect to give a bit more tomatoes to the brew. The only thing missing for me after I tasted it was heat. So I added in a minced jalapeno. I totally forgot the optional red wine, but it was still good without it. This chili reminds me of the chili my friends in the Mid-west make, the ranch beans added a great flavor. Was good on a cold night and we did top with crushed tortillas and cheddar cheese.

Made this recipe exactly as written, including adding 1/2 cup red wine for the final 2 hours of cooking. Flavor was perfect, not too spicy nor too mild. I will make this again and recommend it just as written.

Good basic recipe. I think the green pepper and onions are great and I love the different kind of beans. I added black beans to my mixture as well.  I also use half ground beef and half ground pork. It serves plenty of folks!

Tasted great! My family loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I substituted A-1 sauce and came out fine.

Ultimate Slow Cooked Chili Haiku: "Halved the recipe, but still way too many beans. Good, not 'ultimate.'" The ingredient list is unneccesarily long, but I was faithful to it, only not using the optional red wine, and sauteeing the bell pepper w/ the onion, beef and garlic in step 1. It just seemed like so many of those ingredients either competed w/ the others, or were just straight drowned out by the others. Definitely not saying it wasn't a good chili, just not mind-blowing. Glad that it called for Ranch-style beans though; we love those!

Great chili recipe. Made it for game day this past weekend and got great compliments. I couldn’t find the Mexican style stewed tomatoes or the Mexican style hot tomato sauce so I used a fifteen oz and seven and half oz can of regular tomato sauce and put in about a tablespoon of Cholula hot sauce and I used one can of regular stewed tomatoes and a small can of Ro-Tel original diced tomatoes and green chile ‘s. It turned out GREAT and I will be making it again. I don’t like super spicy chili and this recipe was perfect. Just enough heat for you to know it’s chili but not overpowering. Perfecto.

I made this chili for a large party and received MANY complements.  It is thick and meaty with a complex home-made flavor.  If you are looking for an excellent chili to impress your guests, this recipe is for you. I could not find "ranch beans" or the hot tomato sauce.  As a result I used 3 cans of kidney beans and 3 cans of great northern beans.  In place of the hot sauce I used diced canned tomatoes.  I did not add the wine.  I really liked the addition of the canned tomatoes since the recipe is a little light on tomato taste.

My family  and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I had to make a few modifications due to my family not eating beef. I substituted ground chicken and chicken broth in place of the beef and beef broth. I did not have Mexican style tomato sauce on hand so I used a can of spicy V8 juice. It was delicious as we love a meaty/beany chili. I can't wait to try it with beef when my girls and I have our next get together. Thank you!!!

I received this recipe from a co worker after she won the chili cook off. I didn’t have the ranch style beans, but it still came out very good! My son is a picky eater and he loved to dip his tortilla chips into it. I would say that this was still a 10 out of 10 recipe. However my co-worker somehow made it a 15 out of 10! Lol.

Great chili! The recipe made plenty for five people plus leftovers. it's a very thick chili which we all loved. the only complaint I heard was it wasn't spicy. nothing some cayan couldn't fix at the time. might add some jalapenos the next time to make it hotter.

We made this chili for the Superbowl last year, and my husband has raved about it being the best chili he's ever had. It's got a great, complex flavor (I never would've thought about using the Mexican-style sauce or beans or vinegar!), and it filled our crock pot. We made it exactly as the recipe says and had great results. Will definitely be keeping this one as a new family favorite.
