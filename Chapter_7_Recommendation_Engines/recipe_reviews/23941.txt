we had fresh chives to use and had picked them in the woods! We did not use any yogurt or mayo. Just the sour cream , lemon juice and vinegar, garlic and chives. Used my little blender and it was awesome with celery and crackers!

Change the mayo to miracle whip(salad dressing) and add some relish and this becomes a great tarter sauce for fish!

This is a keeper for those ingredients. I replaced the yogurt with cream cheese. It's great!

This was NOT very good. Had too much vinegar and lemon juice. Tried to doctor it, but I wasn't happy to serve it to our friends. Thanks for sharing.
