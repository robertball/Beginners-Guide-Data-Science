I'm sorry but this had no flavor, I marinate, I baste and it got no taste. Maybe marinate overnight, or something.

This is great!! It only took about 40 minutes to make. It can be a little spicy with the crushed red pepper so If you are not a hot and spicy person go lighter on the crushed red pepper. The vegetables compliment each other very well. I doubled the sauce on mine and it turned out great.

This was okay, but it really needs to marinade for more than 30 mins.  I would start the marinade overnight and should turn out much better.

My family loved this recipe, and so did I.  Oh so easy to make... and a great taste that you cant beat in the time.  I served this on the back deck and arranged a nice display with the vegetables... Parents and Wife ate it up... neighbor even poked his head out the window to grab a plate.

(I omitted the red pepper, but that is a taste thing for us)

This meal was wonderful.  My whole family loved it.  The veggie combination on the grill having been marinated is so great and we did not need to add anything else to them.  The rice pilaf with some of the reserved marinate was a wonderful mix.  We will be keeping this one around!!!!
