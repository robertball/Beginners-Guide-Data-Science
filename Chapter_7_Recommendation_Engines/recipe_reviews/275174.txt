My family loves this. The first time I made it I used the tablespoon of sriracha sauce . It was a bit too hot so used a half tablespoon the next time and it was perfect. We are all adults you may need less for kids. Overall easy to make and very tasty. Am making again for the third time with rice and broccoli.

The flavor was there but it was too runny.  It needs some cornstarch in it to thicken it up

Did not have siracha so I substituted Louisana hot sauce.  Put in 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon...will add more hot sauce next  time.  Very good, will enjoy this recipe again.

This was delicious and relatively easy to make. It is great served over rice. And there is a nice complexity of flavors. I look forward to taking it to my book group or to a potluck some day.

I followed the recipe exactly EX CEPT cut the Sriracha to 1 teaspoon (knew that one tablespoon was beyond my heat index!) I served it over white rice.  Delicious and definitely on my to be repeated list.
