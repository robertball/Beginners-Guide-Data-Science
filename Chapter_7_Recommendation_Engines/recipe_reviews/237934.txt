I love this salad.  Couldn't find arugula so used a combination of baby spinach and butter lettuce.  Left out the pecans, but will probably use next time.  Dressing was fabulous.  Again, LOVE this salad.

Love this recipe! Added some salami chunks, used bottled avocado ranch dressing. So fast : great for a quick lunch.
