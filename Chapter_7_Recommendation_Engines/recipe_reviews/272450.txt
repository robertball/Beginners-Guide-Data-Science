Do yourself a favour and mix by weight using an 8:1 water:coffee ground ratio (i.e, 800g water for 100g coffee). Going by weight ratio makes it super-easy to adjust to make just the right amount of concentrate. For the easiest cleanup, I use a bowl with a spout for the steeping process and filter it into a Chemex brewer.

The ground of your coffee also matters a lot for cold-brewing. Use a coarse grind, as for a French press for best results.

Terrific! The ratio of coffee to water is spot on. The syrup is delicious. Taste the coffee before diluting. I didnâ€™t care for it diluted at all. Thank you for the recipe.

I've been making this for a couple of years now. I absolutely love it. I prefer my coffee poured over ice with milk. No sweetener.
