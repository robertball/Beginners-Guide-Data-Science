This recipe was a huge hit!  I made it for my husband and parents around the holidays.  Our grocery has a limited offering in the way of chilis, so I substituted with jalapenos, and it worked fine.  While it made a lot, it was perfect to serve four people and have leftovers for lunch during the week.  I've been recommending the recipe to all my co-workers who enjoy cooking.

followed the recipe but for some reason came out extremly watery, drained some of the liquid off and added a can of tomato sauce, was able to salvage the meat, will not make again

This is the best most authentic Chile Colorado I've ever had, it doesn't get any better than this.  I have people begging me to make this at least once a month.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I liked this recipe but I added garlic and fresh tomatoes (trying to cut down on sodium) and will recommend it to my friends.

My friend and I cook at a Sober LIving Environment once a week.  We doubled the recipe, used non-Alcoholic beer, served it with 4 giant cans of beans, 50 tortillas, and rice.  The 15 guys  LOVED it.  
I seeded the serrano peppers.  Next time I might leave the seed casings in 1/4 of 'em to make it a bit hotter.  I want to try making the cubes 1" vs 1.5" just because it's easier for me to cut when buying already cut chuck roasts as my source for beef.

With all the wonderful reviews on this dish I expect a great dish.  I must have made this wrong because my family didn't like it at all.  Good thing I only made half a recipe.

good flavor but proportions of ingredients was off. it was way too much liquid. I would cut that consirably in the future.  also I only used half the recommended canned chili's and less than half the Serrano chili's and it was still really spicy. any more chili's and my family would not be able to eat it

I made this last week and my husband LOVED it!!!! His mom was half Mexican, so he grew up on Mexican food. He was very happy that this was so close to how she made it!!!!! I will HAVE to make it again :)

It is a lot though, I made half of the recipe and it still would have fed at least 6 people with a large appetite!!!!

Not a recipe my husband was used to but we still found it yummy.  It made so much we had to freeze leftovers.  It lasted two weeks.
