this is great frosting with everyday ingredients.  I substituted 6 tablespoons cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons veg. oil for the unsweetened baking chocolate.  It worked great.  Mine was perfectly thick.

This has excellent flavor, but as a previous reviewer wrote, it is extremely thin.  It took me six cups of powdered sugar to reach spreading consistancy.  The next time I make it, I will only add 2 TBSP milk to the butter and chocolate.  Then I can add more if needed after beating in the sugar.

I followed this recipe exactly, using high quality real butter.  My frosting came out seeping with the oil from the butter---it was pretty gross.  I threw it away.

My mom has been making this recipie ( under a different name) for over 40 years.  Everybody loves it.  Sometimes I even add cream and use it as a ganash or use less milk and make a fantastic fudge.

Yikes - this one didn't turn out very good at all.  Waaaaaaay too buttery for my tastes.  After it was spread on brownies, I had to set paper towels on top to absorb all the extra butter that was pooling on the top.  Followed the directions exactly - never had an issue making frosting before.  Next time, I'll stick with "Chocolate Frosting I" on this site.

Me and my husband used this frosting on brownies and loved it! The flavor is great and I loved the texture of it. Warning though, it is rich.
We will definitely use this recipe with brownies from now on.

I tried this recipe tonight, though I reduced the amount of milk as suggested.  I used 3 Tablespoons. Although the flavor was great, it was unbelievably greasy.  After I spread it onto some brownies, the butter "pooled" to the top and I had to blot it off with papertowels!  That aside, there were no complaints and they were gobbled up in no time. I'm not sure how to correct this, so am not sure I would make again.

Super easy to make.  I reccomend just over 4 tbsb milk for the right consistancy.  You can always add more sugar but this changes the taste.  This is a lighter frosting - not heavy chocolate.  The perfect complement to fudge brownies.

Good flavor, but definitely needed work. I wanted it to look shiny, so I added about 3 Tb corn syrup. Thin, as has been pointed out before, so I placed it in a bigger bowl with ice and water, and stirred gently until it firmed up. Do not use a mixer over the ice and water, unless you want the color to lighten up considerably. I was going for a dark, fudgy look, so I just stirred it with a rubber scraper. It will thicken up on the bottom, where the bowl makes contact with the icy water. Not to worry. Just take it out of the ice water and stir until the thicker part has blended in. Then return to the icy water and continue stirring until it reaches your desired consistency. I was using it for my 9-layer vertical torte, so I increased it by 50%. Held its shape very well, and with the addition of the corn syrup, it sported a lovely, appealing sheen.

I cut the recipe in half cause I didnt need alot of frosting. But I had no issues with making this recipe. I read alot of ppls reviews. I melted the butter in a pan. I used cocoa powder cause its all we had. Added the vanilla,salt, and cocoa powder. Mixed that til smooth then added 1 1/2 tbs of milk and the sugar. Turned out perfect. I have been trying to find a thick chocolate frosting recipe. This is it. Just gotta know how to work it is all. Thank you for the breat recipe Miss Amy! :)

Very easy to make but definitely follow the reviews...I went with 3 Tablespoons milk and about 2 cups extra sugar to get it a spreadable consistency. Very fudgy and delicious though!

VERY GOOD, but you do need to play with the numbers. I used about 1/3 c butter and only put enough milk in to make a consistency I was happy with.

This frosting needed a lot of extra powdered sugar in order to reach the correct consistency, as another reviewer has said. But other than that the taste is really great, and tastes almost exactly like fudge. My brother said that he thought it had a slight coffee taste to it, but was mostly like fudge. This is a great recipe.

I read the other reviews so I reduced the butter by 3 tblns and used only 3 tbln of milk.  I beat the  out of it with my kitchenaid mixer but couldn't get it to fluff up enough to spread.  So--I rolled it out like a fondant and draped it over the cake.  It was delicious!  I'll probably not be able to reproduce it again, but it ended up fudgy and good tasting.

I was in a hurry and didn't read the previous reviews, so I ended up adding a lot more sugar to thicken this frosting up.  It tastes really good, just wasn't spreadable without the extra sugar.

Did not have chocolate squares so I used 6 tbs cocoa powder and 2 tbs veg oil as another reviewer did and added about another 1/2 to 3/4 more powdered sugar.  It separated a bit but after mixing it with the powdered sugar it turned out great. So don't sweat it if it separates while you are cooking it.  It works out in the end after mixing. My sister said it was the best she ever had, and I agree with her.  Used it on brownies as suggested and they were delicious!!!

I spread this on my delicious chocolate zucchini cake and it was wonderful! I made this recipe mostly as directed, but with two slight variations. The first variations was that I doubled the chocolate called for, because I love really chocolatey frosting. The second variation was that I used a double boiler to melt the butter, chocolate and milk - stirring constantly, then I moved my double boiler into an ice bath and stirred constantly until it was completely cooled. Then I transfered the cooled chocolate mixture into the other ingredients, and it turned out perfectly fluffy. Every baker needs a good chocolate frosting recipe, and this is a great recipe. Thanks!

This is GREAT if you are wanting a glaze or icing for brownies as the contributor suggested.  I did add a little corn syrup for sheen, but the consistency is wonderful.

Good, with modifications. As suggested, I only used 3 TBS milk. Also I used 70% belgian chocolate (from Trader Joe's- what I had on hand) and 1/4 cup of butter. Because I don't like my frosting too sweet I added in a few teaspoons of corn starch after it was adequately sweet.

Very easy to make when you are in a pinch.  I was baking brownies and forgot to buy frosting.  I found this recipe and made it and was very happy with the results.

It needed way more chocolate. I melted 2 more cubes and added them in at the end. I also needed about a 1/2 cup more confec. sugar to make it spreadable, but it did harden well out in the air.

Thick and fudgy!  If that's what you want this is it.  I had to substitute unsweetened cocoa and oil for baking chocolate.

Super easy and really tasty. The only issue I had was that I didn't have any baking chocolate, so I did the 6 TB cocoa powder and 2 TB of vegetable oil as suggested in one of the other reviews. I definately will NOT do that again. The oil kept separating from everything else, and left a really bad greasy shine on the cake. I ended up blotting the top with a paper towel! :( Next time I will just replace it with either extra butter or milk and I think it will turn out just fine.

The trick to this frosting is making it aprox. 10 min. before you need it. I also added a little bit more sugar and it works perfectly. If adding sprinkles do so before frosting hardens, which happens very fast.

This is a great recipe.  I was very happy with how it turned out.  I did reduce the amount of milk to 5 tabelspoons.  It was rich, chocolatey, and better than from the store.  I would definately use this again.

Well I made it just now to decorate two chocolate cakes. I had to add more milk than the 2tsb one reviewer suggested - just poured some in though so I don't know how much! It was a bit lumpy so I guess I should have sieved the icing sugar (?confectioners sugar in USA?). Otherwise, tasted delicious!

Very good. Easy and delicious. The only thing I did different was to use 4 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream instead of the 6 of milk. It had perfect spreading consistency. It also had a very rich chocolate flavor. I will definatly make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Great icing but I only used two tablespoons of milk and probably just 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar -it came out sweet, chocolaty and really easy to spread -yum. definitely start off with less milk, though , I think.

This is a very easy frosting recipe.  It is rich, smooth.  It is a little on the thin side when it is spread, but is so worth it when you taste it and then enjoy the texture in your mouth.

Not perfect but pretty darn good. Of course I didn't follow the recipe exactly..didn't have unsweetened chocolate and so used 1/2 cup chocolate chips and then added enough powdered sugar (about 3 3/4 cups) until I got the consistency I wanted. Next time I'll use a richer deeper chocolate. It made more then enough for a 9 x 13 pan of brownies and we're right now eating the leftovers by dipping fresh strawberries in. (Would be fun at a dinner party kept warm in a candle lit fondue pot with strawberries and marshmellows on skewers).
Yum

This frosting is delicious! It's great for brownies as well as cakes. Perfect texture -- not too thick, not too thin -- and very tasty! It's also very easy to make. I plan to use it as often as possible. Thanks for sharing! :)

This is a great, easy frosting recipe for brownies, cupcakes, etc.  Very easy to work with--not sticky at all and very smooth and yummy chocolate flavor.  I used this with the Fudgey Special Dark Brownies from this site and it was a perfect combination--the dark, fudgy brownie with the lighter chocolate frosting.  Absolutely delicious!!  Thanks Amy!

I gave it 4 stars because it was too thin as directed. I also was looking for the dark color and consistency in the photo--and that is not what I got. This is more of a milk chocolate colored & tasting frosting, not a fudgy frosting. I did end up adding 2 more squares of chocolate melted with 2 tbsp. of cream to get a richer chocolate flavor, but it is still not what I was hoping for. This is a good frosting if you want something more in line with a lighter milk chocolate frosting.

I made this and loved it. I used the unsweetened baking chocolate powder because I never keep baking chocolate squares on hand. I used 5 tablespoons. I used only about 2 tablespoons of milk because I wanted a thicker frosting. It turned out perfect! Easy to make and tasted wonderful. I also love that it's super easy to make a thinner frosting by adding a tad more milk. I just eyeball the amount of milk.

I only gave this 4 stars... because of the amount of butter. I start with 2 tbsp and add more as needed. I also used heavy cream... I needed this thick. If you allow this frosting to completely cool, it will not separate. It appears that some users were in way too big of a hurry.

It's baking. You do it with love. Don't try to whip it up and toss it on the table. Take your time.

While in the end this tasted amazing, I had to make a lot of changes. I had to add A LOT more confectioner's sugar, and after it sat out it got too thick to spread so I had to add a bit of half & half to make it creamy again.

This is the best brownie frosting recipe.  I've tried many versions but they become sugary and hard after a few days.  This one is creamy and has a wonderful chocolate flavor. I made 1/2 recipe for a 9"square pan of brownies.

A quick and easy recipe I used in an emegency. My 17 yr old daughters brownies cracked when she rolled them out of the dish. We pushed them together but needed a frosting quick to cover the damage.  I used the advice of other reviewers and halved the milk and still had to add more sugar to thicken it. It came out very good but next time I'll cut back on the butter too.

This frosting has a good flavor, but when I was boiling the milk, butter and chocolate together the butter began to seperate from everything. I ended up adding in baking cocoa to try and soak up the butter. It turned out fine, but if I make it again I will use less butter. It was also kind of runny, as other reviewers have noted.

Really tasty frosting, but a bit too thin.  It is on the sweeter side as well.  But overall I liked it.

My husband just loved this frosting! He said it almost tastes just like fudge. I also liked it. I will be making this frosting again. I also liked that is was so easy to make.

This was waaayyyy too sickeningly sweet. I normally have the sweetest tooth in the family but even this was too much for me! The recipe came out too liquidy, aswell. The picture looked promising but I'll stick to my dad's frosting recipe next time!

This was such yummy frosting!!! I have never made homemade frosting before, and this turned out to be the best recipe to start with! It was super easy! Like other users said, the chocolate/milk/butter mixture separated after boiling, but after adding the sugar, the texture was creamy and smooth. I will definitely use this again!

My son brought home a chocolate cake recipe from preschool, so we of course had to try it... making this frosting was the saving grace!  My daughter only ate the frosting and I don't blame her!  It was the perfect sweetness, chocolateyness and consistancy- didn't get dried out and hard after a few days like most frostings.

Not sure where I went wrong. I melted the butter, chocolate and milk, but as it came to the boil - it seperated. Weird. I added the sugar anyway - cause it was the last of my butter - and it smoothed back out. However, after it cooled - it got lumpy again. Microwave helped. Anyway, it tastes like a brownie which we LOVED, but it was an odd frosting.

This recipe certainly came out the correct consistency for me, but it turned a weird texture after it hardened and cooled. It looks so pretty in the picture I had high hopes. But I will try this one again as the flavor was great.

I added powdered sugar until it was spreading consistency and then chilled it.  I re-whipped while cooling and before spreading. It was too thick and not very smooth.  I added light corn syrup to it and it was wonderfully shiny and easy to spread.  Great recipe.

This was an excellent simple frosting. I made it just like the recipe said but at the very end added 1/2 tsp. strawberry extract. It was just enough to give it a hint of strawberry flavor

I did not beat the frosting but tried to whisk it. Made a huge mess and I had to throw it away. May have been my mistake but I will not make it again.

THIS WAS VERY EASY TO MAKE AND VERY GOOD.  KEEP THE FROSTING IN A SMALL CONTAINER AND WARM UP A SMALL AMOUNT EACH TIME YOU HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE OR BROWNIE.  THIS IS VERY GOOD!!!

This frosting tasted fine but the consistency wasn't very good.  It was way too thin so I added some more powdered sugar as the directions suggested.  It was still too thin and slid right off the cake.

This turned out great!  Was careless in measuring and it still turned out wonderful.  Great texture and didn't dry up.  Hubby was doubtful there would be anything that toped his favorite store bought- what a pleasant surprise!  He requested another cake this weekend!

This is the perfect brownie frosting! When it's cooled the frosting isn't a bit sticky and really makes that pan of brownies something special. It's  a little more work since you need to whip it with a whisk for a while but it's worth it. I'll use this recipe every time I make a batch of scratch brownies. Next time I'll cut the recipe in half since I have a lot left over in the fridge. Anyone know if you can freeze the frosting?
