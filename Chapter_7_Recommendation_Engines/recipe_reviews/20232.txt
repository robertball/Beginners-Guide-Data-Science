KFC's coleslaw is the only slaw I will eat, so I was so happy to find this recipe. But I did make a few changes - I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and left out the buttermilk (I don't like it, so I don't buy it!).  I also used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I added some celery seed for a little extra flavor.  My husband says it's the best he's ever had, so I have to beat him to the bowl if I want any!

This was great!  I hate buying a carton of buttermilk for recipes that call for 1/4 cup, so I made a substitute using regular milk & lemon juice.  I also used pre-shredded cole slaw mix & let the salad marinate overnight.  Next time, I will lessen the amount of milk as suggested by others for a thicker dressing, but this was still outstanding!

The recipe I have been searching for for years!  Delicious!  Because of the comments of others, I was going to cut back on the milk, and I ended up forgetting to add it entirely!  Throw away the other cole slaw recipes you have.  This one's the "keeper".

It's been years since I've eaten at KFC, so I have no idea how closely this coleslaw resembles theirs. In addition, I'm not a big coleslaw fan so I guess you could say I was a  tough sell.  I admit I made this only because it seemed fitting to include it in my barbecued rib dinner.  I made it easy on myself and simply used a packaged coleslaw mix, and I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I also added celery seed.  I tasted it right after I made it and was disappointed - it was noticeably sweet and mayonnaisey.  I kept my fingers crossed that a couple of hours would mellow this out and balance the flavors.  It did.  I still can't call myself a convert to coleslaw, but everyone enjoyed this, including me.

Great slaw, Steph! My family thoroughly enjoyed this with our New York steaks and horseradish guacamole found on this site. For a closer version of the "chicken place's" recipe, try subing tarragon vinegar for the white vinegar. You'll be amazed at the difference in flavor!

As far as I'm concerned there *is* no other cole slaw recipe. It's the perfect blend of sweet/tangy and just creamy enough without water-logging the cabbage. I've used nearly exactly this recipe as a restaurant cook for years. I always split the mayo amount with salad dressing, but tried your recipe exactly and it was every bit as good and perhaps just a touch less sweet. Thanks SunFlower~

This is the exact tasting cole slaw served at KFC. It's delicious and so easy. I added dried cranberries to mine and it was wonderful.

Really good and refreshing. I just bought the precut slaw and didn't have buttermilk like the others but just used some heavy cream n put my vinegar in it. I had cider vin on hand so it worked great. Thanks so much. O and I made this with that slow cooker pork. Mmmmm

This was a very good slaw recipe; we agreed it was a lot like our local restaurant salad.  I omitted the extra milk entirely as well as the lemon juice, and the taste and consistency was perfect.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe easy to make, and was a crowd pleaser.  I did make some changes for my taste.  I added another 1/3 cup mayo, and a dash of celery seed.  next time I will cut the lemon, and sugar way back.  but that is just for my taste.  I don't like to use much sugar as my husband is diabetic.  that being said.  I didn't have any leftovers.  I think that speaks for itself.  Re-reviewing this recipe.  after letting this set until the next day  (I had only about 1 cup left that I had forgotten was in the refrigerator cause it wouldn't fit in the serving bowl.) I tasted it the next day and OMG!  that was GREAT!!

All we could taste was the lemon juice.  It hid the flavor of everything else.  It was also incredibly runny.  I'll keep looking for another coleslaw recipe.

This coleslaw is the gold standard for mayo based slaws. It accepts you own custom ingredients well, like grated onion , or green pepper or chopped apples, the list is endless. This should be a keeper for any cookbook!

This is a very tasty coleslaw. I used a prepackaged coleslaw mix with shredded carrots. The marinade  was easy to whisk together. I marinated for about 7 hours today. The flavors really work well together. The slaw (cabbages, carrots)  really softened up while soaking up the marinade. It is sweet and has a nice balance of flavors. I like the creaminess and consistency in the dressing. Nothing was powering - the sugar, vinegar, buttermilk and lemon juice all worked well. I served this with, "Breaded Chicken Fingers," and "Mom's Favorite Baked Mac and Cheese," all from this website.

Having managed one of the un-named chicken restaurants, this is a very close recipe.  I used tarragon vinegar and 1/2 a yellow onion.  We didn't use butter milk, just additional miracle whip.  I like the butter milk idea.  If you have it, white pepper works well in this recipe too!  Great slaw!  Reminds me of my younger years!
  If you use a true eight cups of cabbage, compacted, it is not runny.

I think you could either leave out the 1/4 cup of milk or add it by dabs-if needed.With the buttermilk, lemon and vinegar there is a lot of liquid already in the dressing. Mine came out pretty watery, and I like coleslaw dressing to stick to the cabbage. I will make it again because the flavor is wonderful, but I will try cutting back on all the liquid ingredients.

I have made this several times and it's the best creamy flavor slaw sauce I've found.  I finally decided to leave out the milk because it always seems too runny for our taste. I also reduce the sugar because we find it too sweet as written. We usually make a vinaigrette style coleslaw but this is a nice change occasionally.

I use this recipe and its good, but I use Miracle Whip and don't use the vinegar and use 1/2 Tbsp less of the lemon juice.  I also tweak with a little more onion because I really love onions...

This is so delish.  It reminds me of KFC's coleslaw except this is much better.

I did not have buttermilk, so I left that out... and this still turned out great. (I followed the rest of the recipe as written). I brought some to work and my co-worker who usually does not like cole-slaw loved it, and asked for the recipe for an upcoming dinner she is hosting.

This was a very good TASTING slaw recipe; however, like other reviewers I found the dressing to be too runny, so ended up adding about 1/3 cup extra mayo. BF and company loved it!

apparently our KFC uses a different recipe cause this tastes NOTHING like ANY coleslaw we eat around here.  There was hardly any flavor at all and that was lemon juice :(   So, I mixed up a combo of CIDER vinegar, milk and mayo to salvage it-hopefully it works.

I made this for my family and they thought it was a great success.  It is easy and I can make as little or as much as I need. The only thing I changed was instead of buttermilk I use low fat condensed milk and it still tastes great.

This was good stuff but seemed like it was missing something so we threw in some grated red onion and that seemed to be it. Thanks for sharing certainly one we will be using again.

This is an excellent coleslaw recipe! I cut down on the milk, used 2 tbsp half and half and 1 tbsp. skim milk. I added more mayo to thicken it up. I also reduced the recipe to 4 servings because I have found coleslaw to not keep well for very long. Will definitely make again soon

This was very similar to KFC's cole slaw. It wasn't really creamy though like I prefer. I didn't have buttermilk so I made a "sour milk" with milk/lemon juice for this. I used light mayo and cut this in half to use a package of cole slaw mix. It was 4 cups worth of slaw. I did add a little onion powder for flavor. This was okay, but I prefer a creamier dressing on mine. Thanks.

I made few minor changes: cut down on sugar and cut milk in half, and did not add the lemon juice.  My husband really liked this recipe.

If you don't want creamy coleslaw do this: omit milk & add 2 TBSP pineapple juice instead. Add a handful of roasted almonds & 1/2 a small can of pineapple chunks. You can also substitute the sugar for honey or maple syrup.

Quite good; made only 2 servings. Left out the buttermilk and used store-bought coleslaw mix in lieu of freshly sliced cabbage/carrots. I added a teaspoon of horseradish (with beets, I like the pretty pink colour if gives)- I'd probably use more next time, and also include a little celery seed.

Tastes as close to KFC's as you will get without having their exact receipe.  The only change I made was I grated 1 carrot which was more that the 1/4 cups and added all of it.  I also added celery seed, like one reviewer suggested.  I would have liked a little more of the dressing, next time I will make 1-1/2 times the dressing.  This is definately a keeper.

THis was awesome!!! Followed some other reviewers suggestions. Used store bought cole slaw blend. Used about 1/2 the sugar suggested. Omitted the buttermilk (did not have) just used about 1/2 cup milk and alittle extra lemon juice. Also added alittle more black pepper, because KFC's is pretty peppery. SO good!!!

YES! A great slaw recipe! I don't keep buttermilk on hand usually either but I do keep powdered buttermilk on hand and simply mix as needed or I also use the lemon juice and milk option. I also used the juice of a lime I had already halved in the fridge. I think this is a sure-fire staple for us now--especially if my picky sis likes it!

This was excellent!  The dressing is perfect and I like that it's not too sweet.  The lemon juice addition is right on.  Thanks to the ladies of RE for this recommendation!  Was awesome on our pulled pork sandwiches.

This definitely has the flavor of KFC to me.  My husband loved it and has requested it again and again.  It's a bit sweet for my tastes, so I try to cut down the sugar.  According to my husband, the perfect coleslaw, but to me, who gives the ratings here, a definite keeper, but not "the best."

It was ok.  Was hoping the dressing would be creamier, should have read the other reviews first.  If I make it again, I will leave out the buttermilk.

Amazing does not even come close to describing this recipe! I believe I added a little more salad dressing/mayo than what the recipe called for but overall this coleslaw is EXACTLY like the popular food chain!

First dish to be eaten up at our 4th of July party.  So good, and so easy! I used a whole large head of cabbage and two medium sized carrots.  The amount of dressing was perfect.

I could say I made changes, but then it really wouldn't be this recipe would it?  I have made this several times.  The first time I made it I didn't want to make so much so I cut the recipe in half.  It worked.  We liked it well enough to make it again.
I made this to take to a luncheon, and made the full amount.
It was even better than the other times.  
I didn't change a thing.  It is a recipe that could be changed easily I suppose, depending on dietary restrictions etc.
I would suggest that you try it at least once.

Excellent.  Cut back on the sugar (just guestimated), added celery seed and used white wine vinegar.  Only used a tablespoon of lemon juice and all buttermilk.

I've made this coleslaw three times recently and keep forgetting to post a review. Every time I've made it, I've had many compliments. Tonight, I told someone it is supposed to be a KFC copycat recipe and was told it is better than KFC. It goes with burgers, hot dogs, and coleslaw. You just can't go wrong with this recipe. One more thing, I used the bagged coleslaw mix to make life easier.

This recipe definitely needs a couple of days in the fridge for the flavors to really come together; I highly recommend making it well in advance of meal-time.  Also, it was a good "base recipe" for a slaw, but it wasn't quite all I had hoped it would be.  Add celery seed, horseradish, etc.  Perhaps because I substituted half of the mayo with Greek yogurt, but it was not nearly as "creamy and dreamy" as I had hoped it would be--and I actually doubled the sauce recipe!

Yum~~~~~~~~~ Just like KFC but better with fewer calories adjustments! I didn't have butter milk so I used my reduced fat milk instead. I also reduced the amount of mayo and it still tastes fantastic!!! Thank you for the recipe!!!

I made this slaw for our Church event and the taste was a big hit. I had to write down the recipe for the ladies. The cabbage texture is firm after sitting in the dressing. This recipe is a keeper and is perfect. No need to change a thing.

Oh so good!!!!!  Took to a party today and received tons of compliments and a big empty bowl to take home!  I used cider vinegar as that is all I had on hand, but other than that, I doubled the recipe and followed it to a tee.  PERFECTION!  Thanks for submitting, Steph!

This recipe was just OK. I thought it was a little bland and not creamy enough so I doubled the sauce and it still wasn't what I was looking for. This one just isn't for me.

This recipe is so delicious! I like it better without the lemon juice(made it both ways) and some celery seeds...Definitely make ahead of time--at least a few hours better if overnght IMO. I've made it with  all regular milk and also with the buttermilk and it's good either way...I think it tastes almost exactly like KFC's--if I would shred my cabbage more it probably would make it even more like it but i am too lazy! I just use a bag of dole cole slaw mix...

LOVED IT ! Followed the recipe the 1st time and it was great. The 2nd time i omited regular milk, used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled vinegar and added a pinch of celery salt. The buttermilk is a must it makes the recipe.

This stuff is fantastic. Funny thing is, I completely forgot to put the sugar in and it came out just right. Maybe it was the carrots and/or mayonnaise. Anyways, try it without the sugar at first - you can always add to taste later on!

I followed this recipe exactly as is and loved the slaw. I will make it again without the milk, just because I had a lot of liquid. But this is great. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is awesome! I have changed it around a bit by buying a bag of coleslaw mix and leaving out the buttermilk. My family loves it and has me make it whenever we buy the bag of mix.

This slaw is excellent!  Only took about 10 minutes to make and I didn't buy the bagged slaw, just chopped up the cabbage and grated the carrots.  Had this with pulled pork sandwiches.  Saving to recipe box.

I made, as written, using pre-shredded cabbage and this was delicious.  Very important to make several hours before serving for the flavors to blend.  I made the night before and it was perfect.  Used on pulled pork sandwiches.

Maybe just a smidge sweet as written, but that's a personal taste and easily adjusted. It's nice to finally find a simple cole slaw recipe that doesn't try to be too much.

This almost hits the mark of the resaurant taste I was looking for. It has a good flavor and was super easy to make (my 1st time making cole slaw). I also opted to not buy buttermilk and I only marinaded it for the 2 hours. Maybe that's why it missed the mark? Anyway, I'm making it again for a camping trip and will make it the day before to get a fuller taste. Thanks to all for the help I got to find this recipe :-) UPDATE: took this camping, and it was very much more like the KFC flavor after marinading for a day and a half, I will continue to make this often, planning ahead to give it a day or so to "stew"

This recipe is easy and it tastes better than the big restaurant chain, the only thing that I suggest is to add more sugar.

Great recipe! Tastes "almost" like the popular restaurant chain coleslaw. Very tasty! Will use it again and again. Does need to be refridgerated for at least an hour before serving. Don't skip this part or you will have a not so flavorful slaw.

This tasted like a typical coleslaw. Nothing speacial about it. It did not taste like KFC which has the best coleslaw. So I think I got my hopes up a little.

This was fantastic.  Made it for a camping trip everyone raved even the kids.  Omited the milk and made my own buttermilk with 2% milk and lemon.  This sat for two days and was perfect.

Very easy and tasty, too!  I followed the suggestions of others and made my own buttermilk (milk + vinegar) and omitted the 1/4 cup of milk, which made a creamier dressing.

Yummy coleslaw. I usewhatever milk is in the frig - and just add a tsp of white vinegar and it worked out fine.  The lemon juice is good - but try it with lime.  A bit of a different flavor....very, very good!

It was okat, had a strange aftertaste. Probably won't make again. My husband tried one bite and didn't have anymore. Sorry, I really wanted this to turn out. Only left out the buttermilk, don't know if that would have made a diffrence.

I used the ready to use coleslaw mix instead of cabbage.  It was fantastic - will make again.

I made this recipe for a BBQ and it was so easy.  It tastes just like the one from KFC which is my favorite. I did use a bag of the already shredded cabbage with the carrots. Saved a lot of time. Will definitly make this one again.

I used the bagged coleslaw mix and substituted regular milk for buttermilk because I did not have any and it turned out great!  I have made it twice since then.  Thank you!

Just awesome!!!!  Tasted exactly like my favorite restaurant style -but better because it was homeade!  My family has been trying to duplicate it for years to no avail -amazing to be able to finally get that same great taste and so easy to boot!  One note -I did cut back on the lemon juice and only used 1.5 Tablespoons.

I like to use Publix tri-color slaw mix for the cabbage and carrots. It does make a little too much liquid after it has been in the fridge for a few hours, but if you use a fork or slotted spoon to serve it drains the excess off. Other than using the pre-chopped cabbage mix, I don't change anything in this recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  Got rave reviews.  Decreased sugar to 1/4 cup, used one package of shredded cabbage and carrots slaw mix, and added a dash or two of celery seed.  Fabulous!

3.8.18  Had a little bit of buttermilk to use up, so this was the perfect coleslaw recipe to make to go with our pulled chicken sliders.  I did add  some celery seed (my mother always added this to her slaw) and cut back both the lemon juice and sugar just a bit (personal taste preference), and we were happy with this coleslaw.

Perfectly nice coleslaw. I usually make it for 3 or 4 servings, not 8, and leave out buttermilk if I don't have it on hand.  A wee bit of regular milk is fine - it turns into buttermilk when it mixes with the acids, anyway. I make it with a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix from the store - fast and easy, and tastes better/less heavy than the kind you buy in the deli.

I put just half the sugar and I found it still on the too sweet side. 
I added much less lemon juice (1 tbs I think), but other than that, it was nice. Will probably make this again soon :)

I always follow the recipe closely, except I like onion, so I add about a half of a medium to small onion.  I am very happy with the results.  Everybody loves it and I always have to dig up the link to share it with them.

It's true what others have said, there's an excess of liquid.  But, I think that's partly why it tastes so good.  And, it's perfectly fine with me.  It's not a problem.  After marinating, you can strain it to remove the excess moisture.

Finally, do make it well in advance of when you intend to serve it.  I normally make it 12-24 hours early.

Excellent all the way around. Just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Despite the cabbage being so finely chopped, it retained its crunchiness.

Definitely tastes just like KFC slaw! Followed the recipe exactly. Family couldn't get enough! Will be making this many times for those potlucks and barbecues!

This has become our one and only slaw for cook outs and when we are having smoked tenderloin... it is the perfect topper for BBQ pork sandwiches!
I made a few personal changes... I don't use the regular milk only the butter milk. I have also increased the vinegar to 2 Tbs but I use half rice vinegar and half white wine vinegar. I also add approx 1/4 teas crushed tarragon to the vinegar. I normally use the bagged Angel hair shredded cabbage from the market . I prefer the finer shred and less of the extra thick core cuts of purple cabbage you find in prepackaged slaw mix.

It was really tasty! My first time ever making slaw, and I loved it. Next time I'll use less sugar though, as it was a little too sweet for my tongue. However, the sweeter slaw is excellent on a spicy pulled pork sandwich!!!! Mmmmmm....

Made just as described.  It gets creamy once it sits.  Don't give into the temptation to double the liquid.

I have made this many times now, my friends even have me make it for their events! lol. Love the recipe, the only change I make sometimes is I double the sauce mixture on the slaw. But it is great the way it is.

I was able to find bags of finely chopped cabbage and put an entire 10 oz bag of carrots to 2 lbs of cabbage. Used apple cider vinegar because that's what I had and a little less lemon juice. And always Hellman's mayo. It was perfect and everyone raved and said it tasted like the original KFC and not what they serve now. It was a big hit with grilled pork chops and a definite keeper!!

I highly suggest you try this the next time you are craving a great coleslaw. This is by far the best recipe I have found and I personally think it tastes better than Colonel Sanders!

It did taste like KFC but it was runny.  It did have a strong lemon taste on day one but after sitting for a full day the flavors blended well.  However,  next time I will use less lemon juice.

Caring for dying man who has such weird food preferences, Especially,
will Only eat Kfc slaw, I held my breath & tried 1 last attempt at
making a slaw he likes. Breathe ! He agrees- tastes just like his
beloved kfc slaw, was So easy to make, I did add 1/2 tsp. celery salt
instead of plain salt because h loves it-only change. Total Thanks &
appreciaton to Stephb1 for this.  is So hard to find "set in his ways"
foods he truly likes. This is 100 Gold stars.[I made some for the rest of us but cut sugar in half for diabetic son who also loves it.

Have made this a number of times. Left out the buttermilk, didn't have it. The recipe is stuck to the fridge. Everyone LOVES it. I put everything in the food processor as we all like it finely chopped. The longer it sits in the fridge the better it tastes,  but, no one lets it sit too long! yummy!

Good recipe. Used 1 small green cabbage and 1 small purple cabbage.  I added another tablespoon or so of vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar). I also took cues from others' comments and used Miracle Whip. Season to your liking and it's really a well-rounded dish.

I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar for the Distilled White Vinegar. I also don't buy buttermilk, so added more Apple Cider Vinegar and Lemon Juice to taste. It was so good my roommate and I devoured all of it the first day!

This is our go to coleslaw recipe for the dressing but I usually use the bagged salad. The dressing I used to make was much heavier, I like the lightness of this. Make it a way ahead of time so the flavors can mingle.

Very easy to make! Didn't think the coleslaw dressing was right when first made it but after it sat for the required 2 plus hours - it came out great! Very tasty.

This was good, but we didn't think it tasted like "restaurant style coleslaw".  Was a little bit bland.

We are pretty picky about our coleslaw.  This coleslaw was probably the best we've tried making.  I will keep this one at the top of my list when making coleslaw.

After reading the other reviews, I omitted the buttermilk (didn't have any anyway) and reduced the sugar to 2 Tbsp. Oh, and I did half lowfat mayo to reduce the calorie content. It was still way, way, way, waaaaaaaaay too sweet. I ended up having to put in a ton more mayo/vinegar/milk to make it even remotely palatable. 

Anyway, right ingredients, way wrong proportions unless you want your coleslaw to taste like candy.

Great recipe! My 7yr old son loved it!! My husband and I felt it was just a little too sweet and there was a little too much liquid. But otherwise we enjoyed it especially with the addition of some celery seeds as suggested by another reviewer. (Now if only I could just get my daughter to try it!!)

I am also very picky about my coleslaw.  This is the best one I've had so far.  I also cut the sugar to 2T, didn't have any buttermilk so I just cut it out all together and added celery seed. This will be a common recipe in our house.

I had to play with this one a bit. I found it much too sweet, so I added more salt, pepper and vinegar. I didn't have buttermilk, but I don't like it anyways so I just used more mayo. In the end, it was delicious! This is a good base recipe, you may just have to taste it and play around with the seasonings as I did.

Yummy - i used pre-washed/ pre-cut cabbage (gotta love it) and this was super-easy. . . I made it once with the sugar and found it too sweet. Its nice and tangy with no sugar and no buttermilk . . . I added some chopped green onion and dill for extra flavour - delicious!!!!

As a rank beginner, never having made a slaw before, I was impressed how easy it was (and how much the volume shrinks).  It does get better with age.  Too much oil for my taste, though.  I will make it next time with maybe 1/3 cup oil and substitute sesame seed oil or something tasty like that.

This is the best I have ever made and sooo easy too. When serving, I drained off all the liquid and should have left half of it and server with a slotted spoon. Draining the liquid drained some of the taste.

This was like KFC's!  I served my guests went back into the kitchen for something and returned to "mmm this is so good" because they had already tucked into the slaw.  Thanks for making me look so good!  This is my last coleslaw recipe!

Best coleslaw I've ever tasted! Like previously mentioned, I left out the milk and just used the buttermilk. Really simple to make and I made it even simpler by using bagged shredded cabbage. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe tasted just like the coleslaw I used to have at home in England. I used half of what the recipe asked for on the sugar as our coleslaw in England aren't as sweet as in USA. I never realised coleslaw was so easy to make. Thank you!!!

Great recipe! It does taste like the restaurant coleslaw! At last I found a good traditional coleslaw recipe. I am very picky about coleslaw and I have tried so many! This one I will make over and over! Thanks!
