What makes these better is rolling them in peach schnapps instead of brandy. Then roll them in dry peach jello and orange colored sugar. Mmmm... so good!

I LOVE this recipe - for presentation alone it deserves 5 stars!  You can see in the picture I submitted that I used gumdrop slices and almond slivers for the leaves and stems.  There is a similar recipe on this site that uses butter instead of oil, but I find the butter makes the cookie halves spread too much - I like to use a combination of both.  Neither of the fillings are very appetizing to me, so I've been using a chocolate ganache to fill these (2 parts chocolate to 1 part heavy cream).  I find this recipe to be a LOT of work - but I really like it for special occasions.

Amazing.  These cookies look like the real thing.  I took them to a BBQ and every few minute you would hear someone say oh, they're not real peaches.  I used Mint leaves for the stems. I made my own colored sugar by dropping a few drops of food coloring into a cup of sugar and mixing with my fingers..be sure to use a glove or plastic bag over your hand or your hands will be the same color as the sugar.  I was a little nervous about the filling but followed the recipe to the letter and it tasted fabulous.  After people realized they were cookies they could stop talking about how good they were. I took a photo, I will post soon.

What did I do wrong?  the cookie is sort of dry and tasteless.  The filling is good and I added a peach colored butter icing on top of the filling and it helped to hold the 2 cookies together.  The decorating with colored sugar and dry jello was fun and worked well.  They are pretty, but the cookie isn't very good. Now I am looking for a recipe that will still hold the same shape and taste great.  Any ideas?

I made this recipe. I would omit the crumbs. I would also use Jello instead of sugar. These are very time consuming. They need to be hollowed out while warm, not cool. My cookies did not look as pretty as the ones in the picture. They also need to be refrigerated.I would not make them again!

This is one recipe that needs a video to help explain it!  How the heck do you make them look like the ones in the photo?!!!  Mine were a miserable representation, to say the least :^(.  So the 3 rating is for the difficulty in the presentation.  However, I really did like the flavor, and would have rated it a 4 or 5 for that!  Since others mentioned the cookie was "tasteless", I did add some nutmeg to the dough. I think it tasted great that way.  I used peach preserves, since they look like peaches made sense to me! I did use the instant tea as well - peach flavor (it contained some sugar substitute, as I could not find any that didn't have some type of sweetner in it). I also coated the cookies in peach jello, dyed with some red food coloring.   I might try these again, but may just give up on making them into "peaches" and just have them as a standard sandwich cookie - unless some other reviewers pass along their tips on how to make them successfully!

In over 40 years of baking cookies, this must be one of the most tasteless cookies I have made. I would throw it away but I hate to waste things. Too much trouble for such disappointing results.

This recipe was given to me by a dear friend years ago, with changes as follows:  omit instant tea powder and cinnamon in filling.  Brush cookies with oj and peach schnapps, roll cookies in dry peach jell-o.  They are wonderful and do have taste with the jell-o!

I have been making these for at least 25 years and I have some tips for those who say the cookie is too dry and tasteless.  My original recipe calls for a pastry cream for the filling (yummm!) although I've used peach or apricot preserves mixed with either the cookie crumbes OR Chocolate cookie crumbs for a more realostoc peach pit look.
Then, and here is the secret for a luscious tasting cookie. My original recipe called for SWEET VERMOUTH (although you could certainly use peach schnapps), tinted with a drop of red food color and a couple drops of yellow color, or just use a few drops of orange...  At least a cup of the liqueur is needed.
Now fill both halves of the cookie and put 2 together, then  the cookie is gently dropped into the liquid for a FEW seconds, turning so all sides are coated,  (brushing them is not enough to make the cookie moist and flavorful). Not too long or they will begin to break apart!!  But the flavor added makes them to die for!!  Now you can roll them into just plain granulated sugar, as the cookie itself has the color already on it.  Perfection!!   Enjoy...

My Brother in Law had the odd request of Austrian Peach Cookies for his birthday dessert which I had never made, seen or tasted before. Since AR had two versions of this recipe with similar doughs, but vastly different fillings, I decided to make both. This recipe was our favorite by far. What made the filling so special was the instant tea powder. I used iced tea powder (in the US, what we Canadians call 'iced tea' you refer to as 'sweet tea'). I photo journalled my process of making the cookies in hopes that they may help out anyone who wants to try this recipe, but might be intimidated by it :)

I agree with the reviewer that said these cookies are tasteless. They are dry and taste like flour. I found that only baking them for 8-9 minutes helps. 15 minutes turned mine into little bricks. I'm also having trouble with mine staying together, and I can't get mine to look nice like the picture.

Was doubtful at first but it turned out great! I changed it based on what i had in the house, rasberry preserves, peach schnapps, instead of tea powder i actually used lemonade powder and it was still good. I also used orange jello for the outside. With more practice it could look more like a peach.

Here are a few tips for more flavorful cookies.  This is what I do.  Tint your sugar in a zip lock and kneed till mixed.  Add yellow tinted sugar to 1 - 3 oz pkg of peach jello.  Same with red tinted sugar with strawberry or cherry jello.  Roll peach shaped cookie in egg whites.  This also makes a more refined looking cookie.  I make a totally different filling but that is changing the recipe.
