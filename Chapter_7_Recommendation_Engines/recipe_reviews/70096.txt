With the diversity of reviews, I almost didn't try this, but it was either a rave or unedible, so I made it.  Very glad I did. It is a very tasty dinner that we have enjoyed and will make again and again. Suggestions: 1. Meat Selection - Do NOT use corned beef brisket.. plain beef brisket should be somewhat marbled with fat for super tender results. 2. Chili Sauce - Use 12oz bottles of Heinz Chili Sauce.  If you can't find it, mix 1C Catsup, 1Tbs Worchestershire sauce and 1tsp dried mustard per pound of brisket instead of the chili sauce. 3. Sliced Onion - Put on bottom of crock pot. 4. Sliced mushrooms are a great addition. 5. Potatoes and carrots - Very tasty addition but cook at least 4 hours, but OK to put in the crock pot at the start. 6. Gravy - I used 2Tbs flour mixed in 1/4 Cup water added to the gravy after removing the meat and veggies.   We planned to do sandwiches the next day, but liked the veggies so well that I added more veggies and made more sauce/gravy without putting meat back in.  7. Extend sauce  - I used 2 Cups catsup, 2 packs onion soup mix, 3 Cups water and 3 beef bullion cubes.  Thickened with flour/water mixture after cooking additional mixture 4 hours.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  My kids LOVED this.  The only reason this recipe doesn't have a solid 5 star rating is because some people used red pepper sauce instead of CHILI sauce.  Look for "CHILI sauce" near the ketchup.  Hint:  the ingredient is labelled "Chili Sauce".  I added sliced onions and 1/2 tsp of black pepper to increase the flavor, but it doesn't need that.  Serve with mashed potatoes, green beans and a salad.

I have eaten brisket made this way since I was a little girl.  The only thing my family did was add sliced mushrooms to the rest of the ingrediets.  On Jewish holidays Mom would add a kishke to cook in the pot during the last hour or so.  YUMMY!  Your Cousin's legacy certainly lives on.  Also just a note to you not familiar with brisket.  Brisket and corned beef are not the same thing, although a corned beef is made out of a brisket of beef.  Corned beef has been cured, or "pickled" before it is cooked - and has a very distinct taste all its own. The Guiness rcipe on this site is wonderful for corned beef. However the BRISKET called for here is just the plain cut of beef.  I can't imagine what a horrible mess this recipe would be if you used a corned beef............

I needed a brisket recipe that I could do in the crock pot...limited oven space!  The flavor was good, and the meat was very, very tender.  I cooked the brisket overnight, refrigerated during the day, then sliced it, poured the sauce on top and reheated it (covered) in the oven before serving.  I will make all my briskets in the crock pot from now on!

This is a delicious & simple recipe.  My brisket was about one & a half pounds, so I only used one jar of chili sauce.  I cooked it for ten hours, and it was fantastic.  The leftovers were good too.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  My husband loved it.  I served it with carrots and potatoes.  I had the chili sauce but didn't have any onion soup mix so in a pinch, I substituted brown gravy mix and added my own sliced onions.  The beef was very tender and the gravy was delicious.  Because I used the brown gravy mix, I didn't have to thicken the sauce.  It did that on it's own.  This one's a keeper.

This was very good, but I only used 1 bottle of chili sauce, because that's all I had on hand.  I am not sure we would have liked it with both bottles.  There was plenty of gravy for the mashed potatoes even without the additional chili sauce.  Salad, Crusty bread and salad along with the potatoes and you have a great easy meal.

I am making this for the second time!  This was a great dish to make ahead of time for a party-- I sliced up the brisket after it cooked - along with the sauce  - then showed up to the party with a basket of rolls so as an appetizer - you could take the small rolls and put the brisket on them.  Everyone loved this dish - and when the brisket was gone some were just dipping leftover rolls in the remaining sauce!  Very tasty and EASY!!!

This recipe was excellent! My family really enjoyed it. The meat was tender and fell apart nicely! The only thing I did differently was I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to make the gravy a bit sweeter. I added fresh mushrooms ,and onions then served it over extra wide noodles yummy! Thanks for a great recipe. I will make this again for Passover this year!

Made this yesterday, after reading a lot of the reviews I made the following changes; added more garlic, splash of worchester sauce, black pepper, used one bottle of Heinz chili sauce. I sliced one yellow onion and placed it on the bottom of the crockpot, put my briskit in, poured 3/4 bottle of ale in, then poured on the chili sauce mixture, finally topped with a large handful of sliced mushrooms. My boyfriend and I really liked this dish. Served with garlic mashed potatoes & green beans. Sooo good. Thanks Dorothy for sharing your cousin David's recipe.

This was so awesome -- wow.  I did add some brown sugar, maybe 2 T.  Just remember that you need to make the sauce to your liking before you start cooking.  If you don't like it at the start, you probably won't like it at the end.  Tweak it until you are happy.  By nine hours on low, mine was spectacluar.  If you think two bottles of the chili sauce will be too tart for you, use one bottle chili sauce and then maybe 12 oz tomato juice or plain tomato sauce.  Tweak, tweak, tweak until it's perfect, *then* fire up the slow cooker!  The sauce was sooo good sopped up with bread.  Yummers!

The first time I made this I did not like it at all. It took a lot of brown sugar just to make it edible. The taste was too vinegar-y for me. However, I decided to try again and used half bbq sauce and half chili sauce and again added brown sugar; and the second time I thought it turn out really good.

This was really delicious, but, wow, is fresh brisket expensive in my area (Maine). Since my son hates a strong onion flavor, I followed another member's suggestion and mixed my chili sauce w/a package of Knorr brown gravy mix and put sliced onions under the brisket. I cooked for at least 10 hours on low and at that point, the meat isn't really sliceable, so much as "chunkable." We really loved the flavor -- the meat just melted in your mouth, and the chili sauce gravy was just delicious. I will make this again when brisket is on sale.

This is a terrific recipe! My family went crazy over it. It doesn't get much easier than this, either. The confusion over the ratings on this, I believe are over the people who used a corned beef brisket. You must use a regular beef brisket and you will not be disappointed. I followed the directions to the letter. I was concerned for awhile that the gravy was too thick and might burn, but all went well. Mashed potatoes go so nice with this recipe so you can put that yummy gravy to good use. This recipe is a great comfort food addition to any recipe box and I will be making this one again. My family is insisting on it-lol. Thanks for posting it! Super easy and tasty is a winning combination.

This WONDERFUL easy recipe gave me the opportunity to recreate an oven-barbequed beef brisket recipe I had quite a few years ago.  All I did was take this recipe as written and added 2 additional ingredients to the chili sauce: 1/2 cup of grape jelly and about 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar; also left out the onion soup mix and added a large sliced onion (placed under the brisket). I can't even beGIN to describe how delicious, juicy, and tender this brisket turned out.  This is without a doubt the best beef dinner I've had in years!  Thanks to Cousin David for this recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time ever cooking brisket and using this recipe was not good at all. It tasted too sweet and katchupy at the same time. I asked my sister how I should fix it and i emptyed everything out of the crockpot and rinced off the brisket and just used the onion soup recipe and added some carrots. I need to find someone that cooks brisket every year for passover for the perfect meal! Sorry

omgosh bgosh, Cuzzie David, this was the absolutely best way to make brisket I have ever tried and I've been making this for years.  My husband even said how delicious it was and had 2nds and would have had 3rds if I didnt want some for myself.  I eyed the chili sauce, but the more the better.  Thanks for this amazing idea.  May try this sauce with pot roast.  yummmmmm

I have been making this recipe for 30 years (courtesy of a friend of mine).  The only difference is that I use a can of Coke (or Diet Coke) along with the Lipton Onion Soup Mix and Heinz Chili Sauce.  Everyone loves it!!!

I made this recipe as is except I used two tri tip cuts of beef because that was all I had on hand and it turned out perfectly!! The smell that greeted us when we walked through the door from a long hard day was revitalizing, we couldn't wait to dig in and it was absolutely delicious, I recommend serving it with mashed potatoes. thank you for submitting this one!!

Not as good as my oven roasted brisket but certainly easy to make.  For those who are not familiar with brisket;  slice against the grain and you will have nice tender slices.  Also, I put onions, carrots and celery on the bottom of the cooker.  When done, I put all the juices and vegetables in a blender and puree.  It makes a wonderful natural vegetable gravy.

Delicious. Used a homemade dry onion soup mix from this site. Also used just one bottle of chili sauce because I was using a 2 lb cut of brisket.

This was a fantastic dish! I also cut 3 onions, 3 carrots, and 2 red potatoes into one-inch chunks and put them on the bottom of the crockpot before putting the meat in. (I skipped the onion soup mix, and added 2 tablespoons brown sugar and a teaspoon of chile pepper.) I cooked it for about 11 hours. The vegetables were fork tender, and the brisket was perfectly done. It was all so easy, and my friends now think I know how to cook.

This was our New Years Day Dinner. 100% great--added halved sweet onions to the base of the crock-pot and they were soooo yummy after cooking. Had to do it on the high setting which made the meat approach dryness. I'm sure it's perfect when you have time to do it on low.

This turned out soo good.  I did the recipe as follows, except I poured three bottles of guinness stout and two bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce in  my slow cooker, which is very large.  I sliced 5 white onions and placed on the bottom, seared a 10 lb brisket, and let it go for 9 hours on 250 degrees. I poured the juices in a skillet and added flour, salt, garlic, and back pepper to make a gravy. Da Bomb

My husband and I did not care for this recipe at all.  It sounded so much better than it was.  I made it exactly, including the 3lb. corned beef.  I have not found a recipe I like better than the Guinness Corned Beef Recipe and that will be the one I continue to use.  I will not be cooking this one again.

I tried this but added a quartered whole Spanish onion, baby mini carrots, sliced mushrooms and instead of the 2 12 ounce bottles of chili sauce, I used Bulls Eye smoked bar-b-que sauce instead. WOW---what flavor. There was only 2 of us with the 3 lb brisket but--we FINISHED the entire thing in one meal. It WAS that good!! I was hoping for 2 meals out of it but we devoured the entire thing at dinner. The smoked bar-b-que sauce gave it a whole new twist. I made it both ways, original recipe once and now with the smoked bar-b-que sauce. From now on, only the smoked bar-b-que way!!! You must try this way once.

I wish I could not even give this one star. This was the worst crock pot recipe I have ever come across. Followed it to a T and had to throw it out and open the doors to air out the apartment as the smell was so vile and no, it did not burn. I am glad people have been successful with it but I do not know how. I use my crockpot at least 3x a week and this is the worst recipe I have ever made......bar none.

This may be my new favorite brisket recipe. I used the ketchup, worchestershire sauce and dry mustard replacement for the chili sauce as suggested by one other reviewer, and I added some Sriracha Asian chili sauce for some heat. Terrific!

Great old recipe.  If you can find it, use Bennett's chili sauce...it makes a BIG difference.  I like a thicker sauce, so at the end I cheat and stir in a package of brown gravy sauce into which I have stirred in a little water to make a loose paste.  Everyone loves this recipe !!!

Seriously, surprisingly good for something so simple!  I've even tried this w/ a basic cut of roast & it was still fantastic.  I only rated it 4 stars on account of the sodium content & use of pre-packaged ingredients, but I have to tell everyone: the cold leftovers on a sandwich the next day are almost even better!

The flavor of this brisket was absolutely magical!  I was amazed that the prep took less than 4 minutes.  I made sure to buy a first cut (or flat cut) brisket, not the point cut.  I added chopped onion on the bottom of the pot, put in the meat fat side up, allowing the meat to fold up the sides of the pot, poured in the chili sauce mixture, then sprinkled 8 oz of sliced mushrooms on top of the brisket.  It was snowy outside, and the aroma made our mouths water as it filled the house for 8 hours.  Even my super-picky husband was begging for seconds.  It probably could have used a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the tang, but we loved it as is.  Thank you, Cousin David, for leaving us the gift of this amazing dish.

I was so happy to see this recipe-- because I was looking to make my grandmother's brisket recipe (almost identical to this one- with the Heinz Chili Sauce) but I wanted to make it in a slow cooker, which I  had never done.  Omigod- it came out so much better than I had ever made it in the past... and I didn't have to keep basting it every hour, I didn't even touch it for 11 hours and it was so tender and amazing.  My changes were-- since I am temporarily living in Australia had to make my own Heinz chili sauce-- got recipe from http://www.recipezaar.com/192123--
then did not add onion soup mix, and added a lot of kind of thick sliced onion under the brisket and on top.  It came out so amazing. Note-- the brisket was so big I had to fold it up the sides of the crockpot-- but it shrunk so much it was perfect. I'll never make brisket in the oven again!  I served it with a sweet potato casserole which was mashed sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows and sweetened flaked coconut and baked.

Well, in a word...ick.  The meat was nice and tender, but the chili sauce is kinda nasty.  We wound up drowning it in bbq sauce.  Next time we will just use bbq sauce instead of chili sauce.

*Had to come back and edit my review to add that after eating this last night, I was up all night throwing up.  WON'T be having this one again.

Yummy, and it's not BBQ flavor, which is good because I was worried it would turn out just like any other BBQ recipe and I needed something different.  I followed it almost exactly, same ingredients but I had to cut the measurements because I only had a 1.13 lb well trimmed piece if brisket and 1 jar of chili sauce.  

Since it's just my husband and I we don't need 3lbs of meat and I was not going out to buy more, especially since it was already 1:00 and I just decided to make it. So I used the 1.13 lbs, 1 jar of chili sauce, half of the 1oz onion soup mix, & 1 teaspoon of garlic powder (I basically halved everything, even though I was using 1/3 proportion of the meat called for in the recipe and I cut the cook time too). I cooked on low for 3 hours and it came out wonderfully and just in time for dinner! Plenty of sauce to use over the meat and over the mashed potatoes (highly reccomend mashed potatoes with this). Use whatever side veggie you want (green beans were good). The sauce was not too thin, it wasn't thick.

I took someone's recommendation and rough cut 1 onion (chunks not slices) and put them on the bottom, then the brisket, then poured the sauce over it. 

Some people's reviews said it was too tangy or too salty or too sweet, everyone has different taste buds but to us it was perfect.  Also you HAVE to use plain brisket not the kind used to make corn beef, they are not the same and would ruin this recipe.

I will keep and use this recipe again.

Not bad, but a little too tangy for us.  Maybe only one bottle of chili sauce should be used?  With a little brown sugar to balance it?

This was good but a little too ketcup smelling, half way through cooking I tried to salvage it with Worcestershire sauce, and ground pepper and onion/garlic powder. The sauce was a little oily for my taste as well.

Okay so I love my slow cooker and this recipe was great for it! First off my husband and I are from the south and we love for our food to have flavor. This recipe has it! But we also experimented. I couldn't find the Hinez Chili sauce, so we used store brand sweet chili sauce. I added sliced onions to the bottom of the crockpot like someone reccommended in a review. Also, I added hot sauce, chili powder, and cheyenne powder. We love spicy food and this just kicked the flavor to a whole other level! It was AMAZING!! My husband couldn't get enough and ate on it all week bc I cooked so much.

Simple and delicious. BUT, after 8 hours on low, the meat just fell apart. There was no way we could slice it! Next time, I'll cook it for half the time, remove it from the slow cooker and slice it, then return it for the remainder of time. Meanwhile, we're enjoying our "shredded beef brisket!"

Just OK...tasted more like bbq than I expected, and since I like my current BBQ brisket recipe much better, I won't make this again.  Not offensive, and it certainly is easy, but not good enough to justify the cost of ingredients.  Thanks for sharing.

Had only 1 bottle of chili sauce so added some BBQ as the second.  The smells wafting from our kitchen all day were awesome.  The brisket was wonderful even though I had a corned beef brisket.  Will definitely try this again without the cornning.  Yes, it was salty, but the sauce was a hit and today those leftovers will become a pulled beef.  Served with baked potatoes and green salad.  What a hit.

Wasn't too sure how this was going to turn out. It was my first time using a crock pot and also the first time making a beef brisket. I figured with the simple ingredients, it couldn't hurt to try it. I added a cup of soda to the ingredients because I thought the sauce was too thick and it made a big difference. My hubby who was trained at a top culinary school and is now an executive chef loved it! and wondered where I had gotten the recipe. It's still my little secret. ;-)

Tasted wonderful! Everyone loved the brisket served with garlic mashed potatoes. Made gravy by straining the liquid and the stirring in some flour.
The next day, we had the leftovers as sandwiches. Even better the second day.

I saw the mixed reviews on this but gave it a try. This was beyond nasty and I cooked it just like the receipe showed. My husband agreed it was horrible. Made a good meal for the dogs since we couldn't finish it.

This is a great, easy recipe. I did a few modifications-used 1 & 1/2 bottles of chili sauce & a quarter cup of red wine.Browned the meat 1st, browned onion and 1 red/1 green pepper and garlic. Meat on top of veggies, topped with sauce. Poured gravy through OXO strainer, blended cooked veggies & mixed w/the gravy-Yum!

This was surprisingly fantastic.  I was not sure of the chili sauce, but it added the right kick.  The only change I made was add a half bottle of stout beer because I thought the sauce might be too thick, and it still was. next time the whole bottle goes in.  My husband loved it and I'll make this again and again.

I have been make a similar recipe for 40 years.  3 lb brisket (not a flat, if possible); 1 bottle Heinz Chili Sauce; 1 8 oz. bottle Catalina salad dressing; 2 onions coarsely chopped on bottom; 1 cup dry red wine - NO OTHER SEASONINGS NEEDED! People know me by this brisket recipe - sauce needs no thickening.  Left over sauce can be frozen and reused to cook tiny meatballs served over egg noodles or rice!

I did a slight variation because I only had one bottle of Heinz chili sauce. I used that and a jar of salsa, along with the other ingredients. Puts a little bell peppery kick into the flavor. I have made the recipe as is as well. And yes, other reviewers are 100% correct-make sure you are not using a corned beef brisket, and make sure you are using a ketchup based chili sauce, not a hot pepper sauce. Blessings on the family of Dave. What a sweet tribute.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! This was so easy and good, we were speechless (scarfing the brisket of course)! We tried this for the first time today and ... wow. Just wow. I have  to admit, I changed one little thing, only on preference - I used a dry veggie soup packet instead of onion because my family is not crazy about onions too much. But it's the chili sauce that makes this dish, and I think it would work with anyone's favorite soup flavor. We cooked it in the slow cooker on low for the full 10 hours and it came out so moist and pull-apart that we only needed a fork to cut it. The sauce from the cooker drizzled over the meat was the icing on the cake. Not to mention how great it smelled cooking all day! I'm positive we will be making this one over and over. Thank you for sharing with all of us!

I really enjoyed it! It was simple, and very flavorful. 

I used Heinz Chili sauce, but it had a flavor very similar to ketchup. My husband who doesn't like ketchup would have preferred a different gravy, so next time I might try it with one of the other sauce suggestions that others have posted.

Definitely loved the texture of the meat; melted in my mouth!  However, like most of the other reviews, if I make this again, i'll probably cut it down to 1 bottle of chili sauce and maybe half a packet of the onion soup mix to make it less salty.  Nice to try though!

I absolutely love this recipe. Although I suggest using only 1 bottle of chili sauce- I've made the recipe a number of times with only one bottle, but second guessed myself this morning and added 2 bottles per the recipe. The meat came out way too tangy for my taste tonight- it was still OK, but I'm not excited about the leftovers like I usually am.

I made this brisket for Passover for my non-Jewish friends and family and EVERYONE raved about it!  Even my friend's 3 year old son always asks if we're having brisket whenever he comes over now!  A+++ for any meal.  Thanks cousin David!

This was my first attempt at brisket.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  It came out so tender and the sauce was great!  The only thing I want to change is to get a bigger crockpot and bigger cut of meat!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe last night and it was SO EASY. All of my dinner guests enjoyed it but I would have liked for the meat to be more tender (e.g. falling off the bone v. just tender and juicy). I also put in onions and mushrooms - they were phenomenal tasting! If I make this again I will definitely put in more vegetables. Overall it's an easy recipe that is very tasty. However, I'm still going to keep on searching for an amazing brisket recipe.

For the first time ever, I followed a recipe to a "T".  Boy was this one a disappointment! Although extremely tender there was NO taste!  The sauce was bland and I expected so much from the chili sauce (we are spicy kind of people).  The meat soaked up just juice I guess but no flavor.  This recipe will NOT be a keeper for me!

I loved the taste of the sauce as it cooked. And the smell was incredible.  I used only one bottle of the chili sauce. One reason was I've never used it before, two my hubby doesn't like things too tomato-ey. The meat was great but I do have to agree with other reviewers that the sauce was too tangy once I put it on some egg noodles. I too think that next time at the last minute I will add some brown suger and other things to make sure it isn't too tangy. But all in all I really liked it and plan to make it again with a few minor changes.

Absolutely loved it, my first time making beef brisket!  It turned out really tender, and smelled wonderfull cooking all day.  I only cooked it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours.  I added onions, and fresh garlic per other recommendations, can't wait to make it again!

My only beef with this (pun intented) was that a beef brisket is kind of expensive and because it is so lean, mine turned out a tad dry. Next time I'll use a chuck roast. The flavor was awesome! A nice change from my standard cr of mush and dry onion soup I usually use.

This is a very delicious recipe, but I don't feel like it's good for a brisket - especially if you plan on putting it in a slow cooker. It ends up too soft. Almost all the photos that I've seen have them cut along the grain because that's how it falls apart. I think it makes a better roast than brisket. Still quite good and simple.

I made this as a pot roast because I couldn't find brisket at the grocery store.  The meat came out super soft and delicious (shredded, not cut), and I added just a little cornstarch to the leftover sauce to make a gravy.  Good recipe, will make this again for sure!

Don't know if this is a Canadian thing or not, but could not find brisket except Corned Beef which I knew not to buy.  Bought another cut, nicely marbled.  The sauce/gravy was a bit too tangy for our liking.  The meat sans sauce was quite dry.  Going to use leftovers with brown gravy instead.  Tossed the chili sauce.

Cooked according to directions and it was outstanding!  My kids said it was the best crockpot recipe I have made thus far.

I prepared exactly as listed.  Although the brisket was tender, I removed the brisket and discarded all of the sauce.  I added a good BBQ sauce, chopped the brisket and served over hamburger buns in order to save the meat.  I will continue to use my old tried and true recipe.

I am making this tomorrow for the 3rd time.  The meat gets so tender, it melts in your mouth.  I use mix fresh garlic with the chili sauce and soup mix and also cook it with baby carrots and chunks of potato.  The whole family loves it!

Truly awesome!! Couldn't be easier...put it on at 9am & it was falling apart tender at 6pm.  I did put 2 sliced onions under the brisket & since I only had 1 bottle of chili sauce in the pantry.  I threw in a can of beer.   
I really don't know how you can mess this up.  Thanks for an great recipe.

This was pretty good, but I ended up adding about 1/4 cup brown sugar towards the end to counteract the vinegary taste from the chili sauce.  Maybe it's because I used store brand and not the Heinz brand chili sauce?  I don't know.  I cooked for 7 hours on low, then added the sugar and turned it to high for 1/2 hour.    By then, the meat was falling apart so I couldn't slice it properly.  We ended up eating shredded meat!  It was very tasty and easy to do.

This is one of the recipes my fiance and I turn to when we know we're going to have a long, busy day and want to come home to comething comforting and delicious and EASY for dinner.  We buy several briskets around St. Patrick's day when they're on sale and freeze them for year-round eating.  We love this recipe- the brisket comes out INCREDIBLY tender and although the idea of using all that chili sauce may seem daunting, it will make a delicious gravy to pour over your mashed potatoes! This recipe couldn't be easier, and once we got the basics down, we tinkered with it, so we've done things like rubbing the brisket with spicy brown mustard before placing it in the slow cooker, substituting asian chili garlic sauce for the chili sauce, etc.  Every time it's come out so tasty!  This is one of the easiest "comfort foods" you'll ever make- give it a try once!

i thought this was excellent.  i didn't have to slice it as it just kind of came apart (in a good way).  i served it with rice, but i thought it would be better w/ boiled potatoes and cooked carrots.

I decided to make this for a small dinner party (my husband, myself and one other couple).  I only had one bottle of chili sauce so I used it and then filled the bottle with water and poured it in also.  The smell!  I could hardly stand to wait for dinner to taste.  It was SOOOOOOOO worth the wait.  The taste was incredible, the meat just fell apart and the praise I received was pretty wonderful too.  I just kept to myself the fact that it was so easy to make.  I can't believe the review that said it wasn't good.  We loved it.

The best ever!  We just finished dinner and we had to say thank you! My 16 year old said it was the best thing she'd ever eaten.  I just served it on toasted whole grain rolls with coleslaw on top.

Made this last night for family who have never had braised brisket before. It was such a hit there was barely any conversation as they were eating.  I added 2 sliced sweet onions, and 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the crockpot first and then placed the meat on top.  I let it go on low for 9 hours and the meat was fork tender.  I served with roast red potatoes and broccoli. This is a keeper.

ThIs was my first brisket ever and it came out great. I doubled the onion soup mix since that's a family favorite. The meat was tender and tasty and everyone loved it. I WILL make this again.

I made this exactly as written and it literally feel apart after 8 hours on low - yum!  The taste was perfect but didn't use the sauce it cooked in to eat, I just used bbq sauce.  Made with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts - perfect.

I do have to admit I was worried about making this because I have never made a brisket before. I tried a savory garlic and herb soup instead of the onion soup mix and it came out delicious. I cooked it for 12 hours in the crock pot over night and I will definately be making this again.

Simple but bland.  I've never used chili sauce before so I was curious.  Strong vinegar smell and the sauce was somewhat sweet.  Just not our cup of tea I guess.  I'm glad I got my brisket on clearance.  I recently made the "Oh So Tender Brisket" recipe from this site and also very simple but it was fabulous.   Sorry Cousin David not for us!

Delicious, though I made 1 change.....only had one bottle chili sauce.  Added 1 cup of red wine in lieu of the 2nd bottle.  GREAT.  Will make again.  Came out tender with lots of sauce.  Side dish worthy of adding is Oven Roasted Red Potatoes (add carrots to roast too!)

I made this for our families Sunday lunch. It was really easy and appealed to everyone. It wasn't dry and had good flavor. The sauce/gravy was really good.

It went well with potatoes, cooked carrots, green salad and bread.

While I like the idea of doing brisket in the slow-cooker, maybe I am used to how it comes out when we do it on the grill with barbecue sauce - it came out very chewy (tough even?) and too ketchup-y for my taste.

This was OK, I used a beef brisket and Heinz Chili Sauce. Easy to make and very tender.  We really did not enjoy the sauce.  May try again using BBQ sauce.

This was good but i agree that 2 bottles of the heinz sauce (i used both) made it too tangy/sweet and i love tang in my food.  I ended up adding a cup or so of red wine to the sauce in the end and it gave the sauce more depth.  I refrigerated the meat and the sauce separately after the initial cooking, skimmed the fat off the sauce the next day when it had cooled and the fat had hardened, added mushrooms and the now sliced meat back to the sauce and reheated on the stove top on low.  It was good but still a little too sweet for us.

Made this dish last night. It was terrific. Cooked it on top of the stove in an 8 qt stockpot. Added approx. 1 cup of water to the sauce to cover the meat. I left it on for 5 hours over a low flame. Shredded it with a fork and everyone loved it.

Made this just like the recipe called and it was wonderful, will cook this again, but for personal taste will add some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Overall very flavorful, tender.

The overall taste was wonderful, but the meat was a bit dried out.  Will make again, but maybe not cook as long.

I made this yesterday and it was so easy.  I thought it didn't have as much spice as we like so I added some BBQ sauce and more garlic.  My husband really liked it.  I will make this again, and I will also share this recipe.

Fantastic! I tried thickening the sauce with cornstarch the second time I made this, but decided I really like it better unthickened, poured over garlic mashed potatoes. It will make your tastebuds sing.

This was nice and tender but the gravy was a little too much like a bbq sauce for my taste and the dry onion soup mix made ut very salty.

wonderful recipe and easier then anything, made the house smell great all day long.  I added a little water to thin the chili sauce, I was worried about too much tang.  I also added about a capful of liquid smoke.  I will for sure make this again.  Maybe even try this sauce on chicken or pork!

Made this for today's snow day.  Oh the house smelled great!  It tasted awesome.  Just enough bite but not over powering.  Flavorful and dinner doesn't get much easier.  Added garlic potatoes and a salad.  DONE!  I did make a bed of sliced onions as suggested in a few other reviews.  The sauce was awesome.  I'm glad there's lots of it.  Will make this again.

My family loved this, but I thought it tasted a little "ketchupy" Next time I will add beer to the crock pot and maybe less chili sauce.  It tasted best reheated the next day.

I made this as a last minute addition to our menu for a party we had. The other meat dishes were roast turkey and baked ham.  Since this was only an afterthought, I only bought 9 pounds of brisket. It was so tender. I just let it cook until it was super fork tender.  It was all gone and gobbled up before the ham and turkey. Our guests couldn't get enough of it. I even saw one guest literally pick up the tiny pieces of beef,  with his fingers,  left in the chafing dish. Personally I thought it was a little too sweet, maybe I should've reduced the chili sauce. I didn't serve it drenched with the sauce, just a little on top.  I will make this again. I had to use two crock pots to cook this. Next time, I will just have to use 20 pounds.  Since I would have to use a large amount, and at $4.99 a pound, brisket gets expensive. Thanks for the recipe.

While this is one of the most tender briskets I've ever made.  My family found this to be just a little too sweet and "ketchupy".  My son liked the sauce over his potatoes that I boiled seperately.  The carrots that I added per the suggestion of another reviewer we a little to mushy and took on some of the vinegar flavor from the chili sauce. Nobody ate them. It's not a terrible recipe but my family prefers the more simple flavor of my boring old recipe.

Excellent! Will be making this again. I did follow some of the top reviews ideas, by adding a large sliced onion, three carrots and two peeled potatoes into the sauce. I also added half tea spoon of ground pepper. I was a little hesitant, because I had never made a brisket before, but it turned out great and tender. I cooked it on high for five hours and an hour on low. Served with black eyed peas and steamed Jasmine rice.

This is a wonderful recipe whether or not you are Jewish.  The meat comes out fork tender, and the sauce is beautiful.  I cooked it as part of an effort to introduce my young granddaughter to Jewish cuisine (she is four, and no other Jewish family members, so I am feeling my way here).  It pleased the family -- but the four year old reaction was typical.  A "polite bite" but nothing more.  Maybe she will appreciate it in a year or so.  Anyway, this is a wonderful, super-easy recipe to leave cooking if you have a busy day, and want to come home to a savory meal.  The best.

This was fantastic - I only cooked my meat for about 5~6 hours and it was done, so the time definitely depends on the type of meat you buy and how large it is. The sauce was awesome on top of mashed potatoes though!!

This was OK.  I had not used chili sauce before, and frankly I don't like it that much.   If you like chili sauce you would probably love this.  In all fairness, I don't use brisket that often and in retrospect I think the one I used was too lean,

Tastes just like the brisket my mom made when I was growing up. I used the "homemade" chile sauce (ketchup, etc) and lined the crockpot with onions. Very delicious!!! A little on the sweet side, but that's how i like it! I used a 1.5 lb flat cut brisket, and it took about 5 hours on low.

This was a very good recipe. I used a can of cranberry sause instead of chile sauce because thats what I had and it came out delicious. I also layed thick sliced onion rings at the bottom of the cooker for a little more flavor. It smelled great all day. I searved it with mashed potatoes and salad, it was perfect.

This turned out incredible!!! I served this over egg noddles and the sauce was perfect. The only changes I might try is to add onion and maybe some bell pepper to add texture, color and a little more flavor. This was perfect on it's own by I'll still try the additions on the 2nd go around.

I'd never even heard of chili sauce until I tried this recipe. It really works for this dish. It's not smoky Texas BBQ, but it is really delicious. My family was highly dubious, but the taste and smell completely won them over. And it's among the easiest recipes you'll ever find on this website.

I've made this twice and it makes a wonderful barbecued brisket.   I found the sauce too overwhelming to put over noodles, so I served it with baked potatoes and corn.  Family loved it!

My husband & I liked this but none of our four boys would eat it!  They did not like the sauce.  Probably will not make again :(

Sorry Cousin David...this wasn't one of my favorites.  The brisket was overpowered by the chili sauce and that's all we tasted.  A very easy recipe, but not a hit in my home.

While I am sure people will really like this recipe, it was just okay for me.  The flank steak was very tender, but, my own taste buds and the sauce didn't jive.  I rate it a 3, but realize others may like it more thus the 4 rating.

This was delicious and unbeliebably easy to make.  A big hit with my familyl.  We made brisket sandwiches the first time with veggies on the side.  I look forward to the leftovers tasting even better after marinating longer in the gravy.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I did it exactly as the recipe called for, and it turned out great.  A little too much sauce, I thought, but the family wants me to make the same way again.  Even better the next day.  I also cooked it on high for 6 hours, and it was tender enough to slice, but wasn't falling apart like.  Thanks to Cousin Dave's cousin for sharing!

Maybe I got the wrong kind of "brisket" but this didn't turned out well. Not the flavor of the recipe ~ it was delicious and smelled wonderful all day. But when I bit into the meat it was chewy and filled with fat. I got what was marked as "brisket" at the store, but I think it was wrong. I was really looking forward to it because it smelled so wonderful all day long. *sigh*

This was an ok recipe. I only used 1 jar of chili sauce mixed with a little BBQ sauce and minced garlic instead of the powder. I have decided I'm not a big fan of chili sauce. I used a 3# brisket and took it out of the slowcooker after 7 hours. 10 hours would have been way too long. Meat was very tender. Doubt if I would make  a brisket this way again.

I don't know what I might have been expecting of this recipe. I did use a brisket - not corned beef of course but it turned out more like pot roast and was completely disassembled and did not slice like traditional brisket. It's worth another try though and watch the cooking time. Taste is good though.

I really expected more from this after reading the reviews.  I was very disappointed.  It smelled amazing, but was too "tangy" for me.  I did try adding a package of the brown gravy but it didnt help.  I was hoping for a more BBQ flavor like one my mom used to make and noone has the recipe for,  but this was not it.   Was worth a try but I will not be making again.

My family loved the flavor of the sauce in this dish.  Definitely an easy meal to come home to after a long day at work.  The only problem is brisket, in general, is not a great cut of meat so we were disappointed.  I would definetely make again but not with brisket.

Made this today for my family - it is AWESOME!  I forgot to start early in the day, so I cooked from about noon on high in my crock pot.  We didn't really like the juice as a "gravy", but I will definitely make this again, using only one bottle of chili sauce.  DEFINITELY a keeper!!  Thanks for the recipe

This was delicious!  Even though it sounded strange, I followed the recipe.  Looked odd when it was cooking too - I did stir and baste it a few times.  Well let me tell you it was to rave about, which my husband did at least 5 or 6 times.  He said this is definitely a keeper and we are having leftovers for lunch today!  I think it would also be good on other types of beef roasts.

This recipe was very easy to make.  My family loved it!  My co-workers loved it as well.  The only thing I did differently was use beef bouillon and dried onion in place of the onion soup mix (I was out).  Oh, I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I'd make it again.

Outstanding.I used a fresh onion sliced and forgot the garlic powder. The brisket was so good I gained 2 pounds with the potato latkes..

This is the easiest brisket recipe ever!  I agree with other reviewers, make absolutely sure you have chili sauce, not cocktail sauce!!!  Big difference!  I made it for a bunch of guys and used a huge brisket from sam's and there wasn't a shred left.  It's even better if you make it a day ahead and reheat to allow time for the flavors to blend.

This was REALLY good.  It smelled great and tasted terrific over egg noodles.  Definitely give it a try!  But, I only cooked it for 7 hours and it was plenty tender....any more and it would have dried out.

The meat came out perfect, and was VERY tasty! I personally didn't care for the gravy, but my husband and kids thought it was great. I will make this again, especially since it was so easy and the meat came out tender and perfectly moist. I think the leftover meat will make a delicious fajita filling too! Thanks!

Wonderful! I hope the folks who made it earlier with incorrect ingredients will try again with the right ones.  I cannot imagine anyone not liking this one.  I will be making this for my son's graduation party.
Using corned beef would be like using ham in a pork roast recipe.
Thanks for sharing this tasty and REALLY easy recipe.  Cousin David did good!

I love this recipe!  It is a family favorite.  I’ve shared this recipe with a few friends and it has become a family favorite for them as well!  I do add some fresh chopped onions and I serve over mash potatoes.  It is so good and easy to make- great recipe!!

This was very good and easy. Some of us ate it sliced as a roast and some of us put it on a kaiser roll -- it was great either way! Thanks to the person with the tip on where to find the correct sauce at the store! I probably would have made the same blunder as others and bought hot sauce!

Very simple but...chili sauce....I must be dumb because I struggled to pick a good chili sauce thinking it was chili pepper sauce. I am recently engaged and I hope cousin dave's brisket wont make me have to give the ring back!  All day "john" commented on how good it smelled while cooking.  After the first bite he started drinking and hasn't spoke to me since.

This was excellent! We added sliced fresh mushrooms as suggested. The whole thing had a really good flavor. We used a 3.5lb brisket (smallest we could find) and it almost fell apart after about 7hrs on low..Thanks!!

Not a bad recipe.   I had a hard time finding 'brisket' that wasn't frozen and 7lbs!  My butcher suggested an alternative - beef tip.  I will cook it for a maximum of 8 hours next time - 9 hours tended to be a bit dry.   I also added fresh mushrooms as an earlier review suggested.   The sauce was tasty and I plan on using it with a different cut of meat next time (roast perhaps.)

Family and friends enjoyed this very much.  Used more beef than called for and made my own onion soup mix.  Even with extra beef had plenty of sauce.

Made exactly as written and it turned out deliciously and tender. Not sure if the negative reviewers just aren’t a fan of chili sauce, but we loved it. Super easy to make, too.

I made this for my cousin David.  Turned out well, but the chilli sauce debate is ongoing.  We used sweet chilli sauce with tomato paste so it wasn’t so hot.  Turned out well.

The changes i made no Chili Sauce. Added Red Wine to make it tender. Cooks fast 4 to 5 hours on high very, very tender. Then turned down to warn. Gravy made in Cooker after it was cooked for mash potatoes. Excellent.

Followed  recipe as described. Used sweet chile sauce thinking it would not be as spicy.  Meat came out very tender, but all I tasted was the chile sauce.

Our family loves this dish. My kids can't get enough. I have made this the last few years for Hanukkah and it always turns out great. I do add a spoonful of brown sugar with the sauce. The remaining sauce is wonderful on potatoes!

I only used one bottle of chili sauce (Heinz), and kept everything else the same in the recipe.  Boy, what a disappointment.  The gravy/sauce was a sweet, vinegary and overpowering- really awful.  My kids ate the meat because it was tender, although there was nothing spectacular about it.  I did not think it was moist or flavorful.

This has to be the easiest and best brisket out there.  I wasn’t sure how it would taste because it was so simple to put to put together.  But when it was done, the taste was so delicious.  Wasn’t dried out and definitely was full full of flavor. I made it for the holidays and I got so many compliments. It is now a staple for our family holiday meals.

This was definitely easy. Couldn't find brisket, so used tri tip. It was done in about 7 hours on low. I did as others recommended and only used 1 bottle of chili sauce. For the other I used 1 bottle of beer. Put a large sliced onion on the bottom, then added the roast. Mixed the chili sauce, beer, onion soup mix and garlic powder together and poured over the roast. A 3 lb. tri tip made enough for dinner for 2 and about 4 sandwiches. May make it again, but not a favorite.

I didn't think it was as good as others have rated it-it was just o.k. I gave it 3 stars for ease of preperation, but I thought it was too salty overall...

This was FANTASTIC made exactly as directed. My brisket was a little bigger at 5 pounds, and it's a good thing, because my family loved it! The gravy was a little too sweet to serve over the potatoes for my taste, but on the meat, it was spectacular! Thanks for the delicious, insanely easy recipe!

I took this recipe on vacation and couldn't find any brisket so I made it with flank steak on the grill.  Tasty meat marinade, but the sauce is too ketchup-y for my taste to serve over the egg noodles.

Well after reading all the 5 and 4 star reviews the other day, I was expecting to come home to a wonderful dinner and then coming here raving about it.  I was sure diappointed.  I made sure to buy the Heinz Chili Sauce, when when looking at the ingredients it is basically just ketchup but a little different. We really didn't care for the sauce it makes and it was too sweet for us. Maybe sweet BBQ sauce lovers will like this recipe. The meat wasn't too bad, but wasn't great either. And I made the mistake of putting potatoes in with it, they soaked up that sauce and tasted yuky. Very very disappointed I made this recipe. Will not make again.

This was east and delicious. I like the tangy sauce that it makes..it's great over mashed potatoes. It's the perfect Sunday comfort meal.  The brisket comes out very tender. I had mine on low for the full 12 hours.

This is a REALLY good recipe—and if you don't like chili sauce, mix up some brown gravy mix or whatever...

I liked this more than my husband did, he said he's not big on the chili sauce flavor.  I served with mashed potatoes & our 14 month old son and I ate it up!  I will make again b/c we liked it so well!

I thought this recipe was great. I read all the mixed reviews and was scared to try it...I'm happy I did. The smell of the Chili Sauce didn't smell that good....but it was DELICIOUS

Oh man, I wish I'd read these reviews before I started.   I've got mine slow-cooking right now after using 2 bottles of Louisiana Hot Sauce ... My wife (who hates really hot/spicy foods) walked into the kitchen and said, "What's that smell?"

Oh My!  Just read about the person who used hot chili sauce.  That must have been awful.  The chili sauce this recipe calls for is usually sold by the ketchup, cocktail sauce and barbecue sauce in my store.  Heinz makes it, but I usually buy the store brand.  I make this recipe all the time.  The other day I used the leftover gravy to jazz up some store bought chicken salad and it was delicious!
