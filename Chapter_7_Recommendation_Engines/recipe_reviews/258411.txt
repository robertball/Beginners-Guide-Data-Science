My husband and son really loved it. I did have a hard time getting the crumbs to stick and followed the advice from another reviewer which was to put a little bit of mayo on it first. It was good. Not sure if I will use crumbs just on top next time.

I made this exactly as described and it was delicious, especially as I was able to purchase fresh local fish.

I made the recipe as is. First piece of fish the coating wouldn’t stick SO the remaining pieces I brushed lightly on both sides with mayo and it worked perfectly! My Husband and Son at it all up.. no leftovers. I’m not a fish fan but my guys said “ this is a make again”! Thank you for sharing your recipe

An interesting and delicious change from our usual haddock dish.  I used a smidgeon less honey and used fresh parsley from the garden.
