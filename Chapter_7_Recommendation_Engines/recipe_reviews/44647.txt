We did a full wood smoke of a whole chicken and used this marinade.  I would not recommend this recipe for a slow smoke, because the sugar in the recipe will make the smoke cling too much causing a slightly acrid flavor to the skin of the chicken

Iit does not state how many pounds of meat this recipe will marinate and it does not state how long to marinate it. So, I took a guess and it turned out perfectly. This recipe works great for 5 pounds of beef marinated overnight or at least 8 hours in the fridge. The sugar put a really nice crust/bark on my brisket. For exact cook time/temp you will need to Google for what type of meat you are cooking. Again, I used beef brisket on the smoker and it was done it 8 hours. Plan ahead on this one and you will not be disappointed in the end result.

I didn't have the full amount of teriyaki sauce when I made this and subbed what I didn't have with soy sauce. still came out super delicious and my kids ate better than normal and my wife loved it! I'm going to add a bit of minced garlic next time for a bit different flavor.

I followed the recipe and my family didn't like it. I won't say want my grandson said it tasted like. I think it was the liquid smoke. Next time I'll add honey.
