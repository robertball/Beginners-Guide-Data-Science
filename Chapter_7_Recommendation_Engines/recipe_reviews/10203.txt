My husband and I drive an hour and a half to Brooklyn for these cookie, and I like this recipe better. The hint of anise is nice. THANKS!

HINT!!! I went thru about 6 oz. of sesame seeds to roll. Make sure you have about a half a pound ready.

I also used my bread machine to mix the dough. It's much easier.

I really liked this cookie - takes a little time to make since there are so many of them.  Brought them into the office and got rave reviews.  Not a kid's type of cookie more of an adult taste.  Great with coffee or tea.

Not as good as they should have been...definitely need to add 1/2 tsp of Anise oil and 1 tsp of vanilla

this recipe was great!! you certainly need the anise.  Also I made the cookies a little thicker than called for because of personal preference.... great results, I felt like I was back in NY!!

these are my favorite italian cookie.  We have been making these in my family for as long as I remember with a recipe handed down through 3 generations.  They are great witha good cup of hot tea.

Anise oil is really not an "optional" ingredient.   NOTE*  the recipe as written is for 7 dozen.  Use the adjuster function provided to make a small batch to try, I believe you will like them.  The second time I made them, I used vanilla and almond extracts - 1 tsp each for 1/2 of the recipe as written and they were good that way too.  Thank you for the recipe!

I have a similar recipe on my website that is a little less complicated. The photo of the finished product was so similar to mine, I thought it was the same. Mine is different with more of a Mediterranean flavor!

These are Fantastic!! Iv never made these before but a friend of mine wanted me to make her an Italian cookie tray up so I thought id try this recipe! So good! I did add some sesame seeds to the batter as well as coating them for a bit of extra flavor and used almond extract! These are Delicious!!
