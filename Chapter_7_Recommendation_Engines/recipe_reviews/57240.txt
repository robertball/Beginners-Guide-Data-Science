Here's what you do-- add 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar to the egg whites after you've begun to froth them. This will keep everything from separating. I served this mousse hours later and it was incredibly smooth, rich, and delicious. I also made a ginger syrup by boiling some slices of ginger with a couple tablespoons of water and white sugar, then straining the ginger. I added this to half the batch to make some regular chocolate mousse and some ginger chocolate mousse (topped with candied ginger). Both came out great.
Thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Advice for others --- the mousse is not made to sit. It's supposed to be prepared, then eaten.... Letting it sit in the ice box will allow the proteins and fats to break down and seperate. So... EAT EAT EAT!!

I can't really rate the recipe because I haven't made it yet, but I was reading some of the comments and I have some advice. Add a tablespoon or so of corn syrup to the melted chocolate to solve the clumping issue. The molecular structure of the glucose in the corn syrup helps to prevent crystallization. It is very often added to frostings, puddings and jelly for this reason.

Incredible!  Make sure everything, except the cream, is at room temp before starting or the chocolate will not cooperate.  If you don't have the alcohol try some vanilla or strong black coffee.  I've used dark, semi-sweet and milk chocolates and all were successful.

This is mousse as mousse should be, with beaten egg whites.  I would have preferred this with semi-sweet chocolate, but that's a minor criticism and no fault of the recipe. It turned out perfectly without the cream of tartar some reviewers say is a must, tho' adding it won't hurt anything.  I didn't use the optional kirschwasser, but added vanilla instead which actually heightens chocolate flavor.  I do have a favorite chocolate mousse recipe, however, where butter is melted along with the chocolate, and I prefer the added richness the butter lends. Still, this is a fine recipe. I piped it into chocolate shells and plated it with "Raspberry Sauce," also from this site.  It was a dessert I'd be proud and confident to serve to anyone.

This is a great recipe as long as you make it right. If the cream and eggs aren't whipped exactly how it specifies, weird things may happen.

Here's some suggestions from a Kitchen Witch who knows how foods work.   The recommendation of Cream of Tartar in the eggwhites is right on.   The thing with the melted chocolate is that is your get one tiny drop of water in melted chocolate, it will clump up (called freezing up) and there isn't a thing you can do about it. Well you can let the chocolate cool and chop it up for cookies, but it isn't even real good for that since it crumbles. If your chololate clumps up, throw it our and start over. Trust me, I have tried everything else.

This is extremely good.  Same problem as everyone else though, the chocolate clumped while it cooled down.  Still extremely delicious.  Even so, I probably won't make it again, I'll look for a recipe without raw egg and something made with cocoa powder rather than chocolate.

While the taste was good, i left the mousse overnight and it seperated making it disgusting to eat with the egg whites pooling at the bottem. also it took both a lot of time and it had those chunks everyone is referring too.

I took all the warnings about the chucnky chocolate to heart and I let the chocolate cool as much as it could without getting hard, but it was still grainy. I don't know if my picture will post, but you'll see the graniness in it. We added cool whip in the middle and it added a nice touch. It still tasted great!!

I have made this a few times, and absolutely love the recipe.  I get the best results with the following changes:  1)  I melted 2 tsb butter with the chocolate 2) I used semi sweet chocolate 3) I only used four eggs and two full cups of cream 4) I use dark rum This gives the recipe a buttery, sweet flavor, and makes it less stiff.  Highly recommended

Made this over the weekend and it was wonderful!   I did make 4 changes to the recipe, some of which have been commented on by others:

1.  Added 1/4 tsp of cream of Tartar to egg whites
2.  Added 1 tsp of powdered sugar to whipping cream
3.  Added 2 tbsp of butter and 1 tsp of vanilla to chocolate.

I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it was very good.

I followwed this recipe to the letter of the law and the chocolate clumped, making it a disaster.  I let the chocolate cool while I whipped the white and the cream and it apparantly still clumped.   I  tried to blend it into the whites and I ruined the fluffiness of the whites.   A day later it separated even with the  cream of tarter added.

I made this mousse and I must say that there are way better mousse recipes out there. The only way I was able to get the chocolate to blend was to follow another reviewers advice and add 1/4 cup water and 2TBSP butter to the chocolate. It is also very important to add the tsp of cream of tartar to the egg whites while beating in order to keep them from separating from the mousse while in the fridge. The mousse was very creamy, however it smelled eggy at first because of the raw eggs and this was a turn off for me. I also felt that it did not have a rich chocolatey taste, and this is important to me. If you do try this recipe, take the suggestions above or else you will end up with consistency problems.

Simple, light and delicious! Problems with this recipe are due to user error, not the fault of the recipe. Make sure all your bowls are completely clean and dry before starting. Contaminated egg whites will never stiffen properly. Chocolate that gets water in it or gets too hot will be clumpy and horrible. If it cools too fast it will leave chunks of chocolate in the mousse. While the chocolate is still warm, blend in the egg yolk a little bit at a time. Chocolate should be warm enough not to harden, but not hot enough to cook the egg. Blend it with the yolk first before folding it in with the whites and whipped cream and it will be fine. Proper mousse separates. Using really fresh eggs and whipping the whites in a copper bowl will slow the separation down, but you really should try to finish it the day you make it. I halved this recipe because 10 servings is a lot for two people to finish in an evening!

This mousse was lovely and decadent!  The only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is that the texture wasn't as stiff as a mousse should be, and I whipped everything correctly.  Also the flavor could have used more depth.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Delicious! everyone who tried it loved it. I did replace the alcohol with some very strong coffee. 
The mousse actually kept a shelf life of a few days in my fridge and even then i never noticed any separation. 
i also made a raspberry sauce with some fresh raspberries that made this just perfect.

This was pretty good--I made it for Valentine's dessert. I used kahlua, and added the corn syrup as recommended by another reviewer. Unfortunately the corn syrup turned the chocolate into a playdoh-like substance. It never would have blended into the egg mixture, so I tried again, adding much less corn syrup this time. The chocolate still came out chunky, which is what the corn syrup was supposed to fix. It still tasted good, though, and it was nice that it wasn't really rich. I served it with whipped cream and hot fudge sauce.

I tried with semi sweet chocolate instead, and it was AWESOME!. The cream of tartar to keep it from separating is a must.

I've made this twice now and it was a massive hit with both family and workmates. The only change I made was to substitute some vanilla extract for the kirschwasser - with apologies to all my Swiss ancestors but I just don't care for it. I did get a few chocolate bits in the second batch because the chocolate had cooled a little too much before going into the egg whites, but people seemed to like finding the solid bits.  I will be making this recipe forever!

We liked the fact that this wasn't your typical sweet type of dessert. The chocolate flavor was the major taste and the cream makes it so amazingly light and fluffy. We enjoyed it!

Yum yum! This has an amazing creamy-chocolate flavor. Mine was kind of liquidy, so I don't think I blending the heavy cream and/or the eggs long enough. The recipe says it takes 45 minutes to prepare, so I guess I should have blended accordingly. If anyone can post how long these things should be blended, that would be great.

This was delicious!!! Although time consuming, it was easy and good tasting.  Everyone enjoyed it and unlike some previous reviewers, we thought that the tiny chuncks of chocolate in the mousse added a yummy touch.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

I had the same problem as another person... I had chunks of chocolate in mine.  In fact, the whole experience was a fiasco.  and to top it off, it separated the next day.

This was okay, but I had the same problem another reviewer did: the chocolate cooled before it was completely folded into the egg mixture and the mousse ended up being chunky. It did taste great, though.  I'll probably stick with the Hershey's recipe from now on because it uses cocoa powder and also because it doesn't contain raw eggs.  Thanks anyway.

Very tasty, but the chocolate cooled too fast and left chunks in the mousse.  Next time I'll try letting the chocolate cool more before adding to the eggs.

This was a great mousse and turned out perfectly and was sooo yummy! The only alterations i made was to add a bit more chocolate and cream to make it really rich. This is definately my new desert to make for everyone!

The perfect mousse recipe!  I followed all of the directions (did use Purdy's milk chocolate), and vanilla in place of the Kirshwasser.  So simple, and elegant.  This one will be passed on to my family and friends.  Thank you for your amazing recipe Je_suis_unique!

This dish was ok I guess.  A precipitate formed when the egg whites were whipped, which definitely looked extremely gross.  However, I decided to put the whole thing back into the double-boiler and cooked it for a couple minutes on medium heat.  And that made the weird white clumps go away.  It also cooked the raw egg, which was a plus.  It tasted reallllly good after referigerating for an hour.

I made this and it all fit together well, but it was so bitter that my guests barely even finished it! How embarassing! I will make it again, but next time I will definitely add more sugar, or use semi sweet chocolate instead.

This was a really good recipe. I topped it off with some chocolate sprinkles and whipped cream which made it super good! Though, it turned out a little soupy torwards the bottom, and the eggs didn't quite ever get to medium stiff peaks.

This was a lot of work but definitely worth it.  I took the suggestions of others and added corn syrup to the chocolate and I didn't have any of the "graininess" problems; and I added cream of tartar to the egg whites to prevent separation.  It all came together beautifully.  It was not too sweet and so creamy.  I added whipped cream on top with chocolate shavings and raspberries.  You definitely need to take your time but again, worth it!

Devilishly decadent!  I had the same problem as others with the chocolate "chunks" in my mousse, but this is a result of my not letting the chocolate cool enough before adding it to the egg mixture. Next time I'll know better.

Yum! This mousse is so easy to make.  I improvised since I didn't have all the ingredients handy (I didn't add the sugar, used semisweet chocolate, whipped cream from the can, and Covesieur), and it still came out delicious! This would be perfect to make for a dinner party.

This was excellent, but after making it, I wanted to try it again and make it a bit richer and sweeter in the chocolate taste.  So I remade only a half batch, and used a bit more chocolate (I used 4 oz in a half batch) and a bit more sugar (2T in a half batch).  It was perfect, in my opinion!  Great recipe overall, just suited it to fit my personal taste.

It doesn't say anything about the speed you mix the chocolate, although when you mix too fast the chocolate will break up in the mousse for a almost gritty texture. I will say it is still perfectly good this way but it isn't what you think of when you see "creamy mousse".

My family loves it, I made it into a mousse pie using a chocolate cookie crust and I froze it solid then I let it thaw, I had no separation and there was enough mousse to make 2 pies but I only made one it was gone as soon as it was served. Very very good!
