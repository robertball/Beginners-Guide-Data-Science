Did not fry the onions, garlic and ginger, just sauted them in a little oil. Also, I used linguine instead of egg noodles. Worked perfectly and tasted like something from home. Thank you for the recipe that reminded me of home.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I enjoyed the taste of the fresh ginger root although I used a standard potato peeler to peel it into really thin strips that get absorbed really well during cooking. I gave this recipe 4 stars because the first time I made it I felt that it needed a little something more. Then someone recommended I add 3 tablespoons of "Iron Chef" General Tso's sauce - I added this when stir frying the chicken and the veggies together and it was divine! You can find the Iron Chef sauce series at any grocery store.

I followed the recipe exactly. Sorry but this was a lot of work for what ended up tasting like soy sauce and cilantro and not much else. Fortunately we like soy sauce but I don't think I'll be making this again. Thank you Tatiana for the chance to try your recipe.
