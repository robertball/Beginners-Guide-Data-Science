Thanks to Fishyon for pointing out the error in my recipe.  In step 3, I forgot to say what to do with the other half of the oil.  Step 3 should read:

Heat half of the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the bok choy stems first; stir fry for a few minutes or until the pieces start to turn a pale green. When stems are almost cooked, add the remaining oil and the leaves; cook and stir until leaves are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the bok choy to a serving dish. Pour the sauce into the skillet or wok, and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce has thickened slightly, about 3 minutes. Pour over the bok choy and toss lightly to coat. 

Once the recipe is published, Allrecipes will not make changes to it.  They suggested that I post a comment here which seems odd since I have to include a rating.  Naturally, it gets five stars!

Very good flavor, although I'd cut down on the sugar a bit more!  I added several more cloves of garlic, so I'm not sure how the original would taste.  Along with the bok choy, I also added matchstick carrots and a few quartered button mushrooms, and I subbed palm sugar for the brown sugar, as I had it on hand.  Because of others' warnings that it made a lot of sauce, I added the entire dish to about 2 cups of cooked Japanese noodles (similar to angel hair pasta) at the end of cooking, and it turned out great.  I think the recipe would benefit from one or two thai/bird chilis instead of the pepper flakes, so I'm going to try that the next time I make it.
Warning for those who are new to bok choy:  make sure you soak it well to assure all sand/dirt is gone.  I bought mine from the farmers market and had to change the soaking water 4x until the sand was gone!  It would have been awful if I'd have not realized that necessity ahead of time.  :)

This was delicious!!! Both my husband and I loved it. I didn't change a thing, except adding 1 tbsp of sake. It came out GREAT. As other reviewers have said, it does make a lot of sauce, but it's perfect to serve with rice. The sauce is delicious, I want to stir fly other veggies using this sauce!!! Thank you for sharing this!

The sauce for this recipes is awesome and full of flavor!  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I am new to stir fry so I was leary of the oyster sauce (hate oysters so why would I want to flavor my food with it) but it turned out awesome.  The second time I made it I added a little corn starch to the liquid to thicken it a bit since the sauce is very thin.  I will definitely do that from now on.  Also, if you like the taste of fresh ginger, but don't feel like you use it often enough, buy a root and freeze it.  Whenever I have a recipe that calls for ginger, I pull out my frozen ginger root, shave off a few pieces with my knife and pop it back in the freezer until next time.

Loads of flavor for a quick and simple side dish. Not a fan of the ginger, however, so next time I'll leave it out - along with the sugar.

The flavors are amazing!! I didn't have ginger root or oyster sauce and it still tasted great. I used chili sauce instead of red pepper flakes and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will definitely be using this recipe again, thanks!

Delicious bok choy. This does make a lot of sauce, probably more than you need. I used 3 heads of baby bok choy and had plenty of sauce left over, so I threw a pork chop in it overnight and pan-fried it the next day. Absolutely delicious, and a great use of the leftover sauce as a marinade. I will try this with brocolli later today.

After reading the recipe and all of the reviews, I knew I would enjoy this recipe.  I wanted to make it a main dish so I doubled the sauce, following the recipe to a "T".  I used about 1 1/2 pounds of bok choy, about 3 cups of fresh broccoli, 6 small carrots juliened, 1/2 large onion and 6 cloves of garlic.  I quick fried each of the vegetables separately adding the oil as needed and starting with the onions and garlic.  After frying all of the vegetables I added the "Baked Tofu Bites" from this site that I made last night then poured the double batch of sauce over all and tossed.  A very hearty and flavorful dish.  I have saved this one and will make again.

This was very good. I added some Asian braising greens to the bok choy, used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, and used chili-garlic sauce instead of red pepper flakes. The flavor was just the right balance of sweet and spicy, although next time I might add another clove of garlic.

This is a great recipe that can be adapted to include whatever veggies you have on hand. I cut way back on the brown sugar as I find oyster sauce plenty sweet enough already. If I'd had a carrot, I would have julienned it, and thrown it in too. Good stuff. Thank you!

I added more veggies.  This was really good.  I added more veggies to the dish beside bok choy.  I added broccoli, string beans, mushrooms, canned baby corn, and bean sprout.  Cooked all the hard veggies first.  I sauteed the garlic and ginger first and added the rest of the ingredient to the pan towards the end.  It was GOOOOD!

This was a wonderful and easy dish... my only substitution was I used sriracha hot chili sauce as my husband suggested and it worked out great.  Love this recipe... Try it, if you haven't:-)

Half way through preparing the recipe I realized I didn't have Oyster Sauce, so I subbed equal parts Hoison Sauce and Black Bean Sauce (because both tasted good to me).  Probably should have just used the BB Sauce because this came out a tad sweet (my fault).

This was tasty and a great way to use bok choy. I added cashews, cooking them along with the stems, and would definitely highly recommend it. They added a lot to the overall dish.

I found a printed copy of this recipe on the train. My lucky day! Great recipe. Great website!  The sauce is really good. This was my first time eating bok choy, and I'm glad I tried it with this recipe.  I did find myself wondering what to do with the remaining oil until I went back and saw in the first review that it should be used to stir fry the remaining bok choy.  I had already passed this point so I used it to stir fry shrimp.

Great recipe!  I bought a pound of bok choy from my local asian market for $0.80!  It cooked down and I ended up eating the entire thing in one setting.  Instead of chilis I added asian chili sauce.  Other than that, I kept the recipe the same.  Despite using soy and oyster sauce, I didn't find the dish too salty.  I'll definitely make this again!  I want to try this recipe with Chinese broccoli!

I don't make bok choy often, but we really enjoyed this!  I served it over plain white basmati so that the sauce from the bok choy could be enjoyed with the rice!  We had spicy shrimp on the side, very yummy meal :)

I made bok choy for the first time a few months ago, when I decided to find a good recipe after hearing about the health benefits.  I did omit a couple of ingredients:  ginger (we don't like it) and oyster sauce (couldn't find it at the market), and dark agave instead of brown sugar!    The whole family loved this recipe, and I make it frequently now!  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good.
I made it without the sesame oil (an allergic family member or I'd have used it) and had it with white rice for dinner. Nothing else.
The bok choy I used was a huge bunch. Giant.
Even the picky eater liked it.
Yay and thanks Spyce!

Delicious!  The good thing about this sauce is that you can use it with any hearty, leafy greens.  My kids LOVE this one as opposed to other similar recipes because this adds a hint of sweetness with the brown sugar!

Great, basic recipe! The trick with the sauce is to let it simmer away for about 3-4 mins to get it nice and thick. That way it isn't watery, yet you don't need cornstarch. I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it, and continue to experiment by adding different veggies and proteins. Thanks!

Very very good.  I had a little over a pound of baby bok choy.  I didn't bother separating them because the white & green parts cooked just fine.   I only did 1 tablespoon of olive oil and bottled minced ginger.   I also used a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce instead of the red pepper flakes.   Other than that, everything else was the same.   I need to go back and buy more bok choy!

Yummy sauce!!  I steamed some broccoli and threw that into the mix as well.  A very tasty side to a steak dinner :)
FYI I didn't have oyster sauce so I subbed hoisen sauce and it was great!

I omitted the ginger (don't care for it), used vegetarian mushroom oyster sauce (to make it vegetarian), and used Sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes. Wonderful!

I got Bok Choy in my CSA box this week so I tried out this recipe, we'd never had it before so it was a tasty experiment. The recipe is pretty good, I added some red Chinese long beans I grew for color and flavor and served it over brown sticky rice. I used the extra sauce to glaze some shrimp skewers and broiled them, just perfect for this. It could use a tad more ginger and garlic, but otherwise it was well liked by the whole family, even my 8 year old. I'd eat it again.

Gotta like that Bok Choy!   I thought it had a little too much oil,  so next time I will cut out the vegetable oil all together and add a little water in its place.  Other than that, this is a simple and tasty recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very very pleased. Next time I think I'd add a little more crushed red pepper - I like spicy! My four year old didn't care for this, but he really liked the sauce over his rice. Thank you!

I've never had bok choy before and found this delicious recipe. I only used 1/2 a pound, so I scaled down all the ingredients. I used all the ingredients except the red pepper flakes, but used them my own way, like I minced the ginger instead of grating it, and I added a drop of chili oil and olive oil instead of vegetable.

The only other difference is I cooked the bok choy in the sauce rather than afterward. It was excellent. The sauce is amazing, and I wish I'd made more. Next time. :)

I used ginger powder (1/4 tsp) because I didn't have fresh. The bok choy cooks down a lot, so... even though my wok looked full I ended up with enough for two or three servings. It was delicious. I had googled a recipe for this and found a video on youtube for the same exact recipe, just take the "spicy" out (if you need visual instructions). Will make again!

Great sauce! I could see it being good sauce for other vegetable dishes, noodle dishes, or as a marinade for fish.

Loved it!  I left out the oyster sauce, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used 1/4 tsp of whole red pepper flake, and threw in some diced turkey keilbasa.  Turned out beautifully!

I had some mushrooms and asparagus that really, really needed to be used up.  I work Fri, Sat and Sun nights and there is no way those vegetables could have waited until Monday. I needed leftovers for the DH to eat over the weekend.   So I found this recipe and I had a smallish head of bok choy in the refrigerator, and I decided to combine everything.  I made the sauce exactly as written.  I started cooking the mushrooms and asparagus along with the bock choy stems.  Then I put in the bock choy leaves and poured the sauce right on ove the whole shebang.  It came out wonderfully.  All those terrific vegetables and that incredible sauce!  Thank you so much for the post!

Loved this and was so happy to have an Easy Chinese dish to make with all  my leftover bok choy! 
I used Hoysen sauce instead of oyster because I didn't have oyster, but it was still great. I doubled the garlic, added onion and served over steamed white rice! YUM!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was truly outstanding!  I didn't have enough bok choy but I still made a full recipe of the sauce so it was pretty "saucy".  I just let the bok choy sit in the sauce for a minute or two and then removed it to a separate serving dish.  Outstanding!  I didn't even think I liked bok choy before this!

Don't overcook this dish. The bok choy should have lots of snap. The flavor is a good compliment to an asian dish that is heavy on meat.

We have a winner!  I had never cooked bok choy before but had to deal with the two heads that came in my friend's share of a CSA while she was on vacation.  We loved it!  I used slightly less ginger and added shitake  mushrooms.  I will definitely make this quick veggie dish again!

Excellent! I think the name is a bit misleading in that the dominant flavour isn't really garlic. The bok choy was swimming in the sauce when we were done. The sauce seemed to water right down once it hit the bok choy so I used that to pour over brown rice. Delish! We are not bok choy lovers but this worked really well for us. Thanks for sharing your recipe Spyce!

Loved this!  I used fish sauce instead of oyster because that's what I had.  I also didn't have sesame oil, and found only one Tbsp of oil was needed anyway.  Quick, easy and oh, so good!  Thanks for sharing!

This was great!  I haven't eaten bok choy very much in the past because I hadn't found any recipes that were very special.  I'll be doing this one again and again!  I didn't have any oyster sauce, so I took the recommendation of another reviewer who used black bean sauce and hoisin sauce instead.  I went heavier on the black bean sauce than hoisin sauce.

[Added later...] As an update, I make this all the time, using oyster sauce and all the other correct ingredients except for ginger (because I normally don't have it, and this is great with or without it), and it's awesome on all other vegetables I've tried too -- zucchini, asparagus and broccoli.  Since those are vegetables okay to cook steamed or in boiling water, I just cook them in the sauce instead of separating sauce and vegetables.

YUM! I have to admit that I was out of sesame oil and used tahini instead, just added it with the sauce at the end. I also used less water so I didn't have to simmer the sauce for the three minutes so the veggies stay crisp!

nice, easy way to cook bok choy. Next time, just add the sauce ingredients right with the bok choy minues the water, or with cornstarch to thicken if you keep the water.

Easy, fast and very tasty recipe for Bok Choy.  This was a grand slam.  I think this dish could make a great base for a chop suey variant by adding other vegetables to the dish.  YUM.

This recipe was soooo yummy!  I broiled some salmon with lemon and salt and then ate the bok choy and fish over a big bowl of white rice- the sauce poured over it just made this dish so umami!  I think next time I will cut the bok choy into smaller pieces and use half the oil.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Very good. I'm a vegetarian so I skipped the oyster sauce. Instead used a tablespoon of mango sauce and did not use sugar. Great, easy and quick.

I had only tasted bok choy from the chinese food buffet before I tried this recipe and always thought it could've been done better.  This recipe makes it the best!  The sauce is delicious and would be good as a marinade for chicken, shrimp or pork.  I had to substitue a few things for what I had on hand including dried ginger, hot sesame oil, garlic chili paste, teaspoon of seasame seeds, light brown sugar and regular fish sauce.  It turned out much better than I had expected.  I can't wait to make more of this dish!

This was a hit! Since bok choy wilts upon cooking (like other leafy greens), I will purchase 2lbs next time & double the sauce. I used baby bok choy & my family of 3 was fighting over the veggies because 1lb wasn't enough. 

I omitted the oyster sauce since I didn't have it on hand. As others have stated, the sauce was awesome. Nice combination of flavors.

helped cooking the stems first, i added some juliann baby carrots here and followed the recipe as it was. great dish, even my kids ate it without complaining! there was too much of the sauce left over but it's not like i'm complaining since we saved it for toppings on rice.

I fell in love with garlic bok choy after having it in a chinese restaurant. We moved away from that restaurant and have stuggled to find another place that made it the same way. It's simple, but easy to mess up. I've tried several times to make it at home but it never tasted quite right. Well, FINALLY!! This recipe is it!! It's better than the original bok choy that I fell in love with. I used ginger spice instead of fresh ginger and used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2, and used baby bok choy. I highly suggest trying the baby version of this veggie. Just cut off the bottoms and toss them in. Some of the leaves will fall off and you will be left with some yummy, crunchy hearts that are still small enough to fit in your mouth. Yes, it's pricier, but worth it. Make sure not to overcook the boy choy. It's best with a little crunch. And yes, there was enough sauce leftover to save or pour over rice/noodes. I could literally eat this recipe every day. Yum!

This was so good!  I've never had bok choy before trying this recipe.  It was delicious!  I didn't have oyster sauce, so I just added a little extra soy sauce.  I also halved the sugar since I'm not big on sweet.  I will definitely be making this again.  It had such a great flavor!

Very nice side dish!  I used only 1T water since others said it was too saucy.  I used fish sauce (1tsp) instead of oyster sauce because that's what I had.  I served this with rice and Asian salmon from this site.  My husband mixed it all together like a stir fry and gobbled it up.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is superb! Just like in authentic Chinese restaurants. I even made several minor substitutions because I did  not have things. Regular sugar, no red pepper, and regular oil not sesame. Still outrageous!

I've never made bok choy as a stand-alone dish, but this was really yummy!  Omitted the pepper,and was still too spicy for my little one - but perfect for the adults.  Thanks for a yummy way to eat greens!

Makes for a pretty veggie dish. I used baby Bok Choy. Rather than chopping my Bok Choy, I steamed them and poured the sauce over them. Then added a touch of lemon zest.

Ohhh! The flavors were amazing, If you have never tried bok-choy you really have to try this. Bok-choy is healthy and delicious especially with asian inspired flavors. Cut back on the oils if your concerned with calories. I dod not have chili flakes so I used asian chili paste 1 tsp. the garlic flavor with the brown sugar and a hint of sesame oil is delicious, I will making this again and again.

Delicious! Better than what I can get at any Chinese restaurant! No significant changes - except that I used baby bok choy and cut it into strips (like cole slaw) so I didn't have to worry about cooking the white parts separately. Less work, I think! Don't forget to rinse the bok choy either!

I am so happy to find a great recipe for bok choy. We have moved to Japan and bok choy is very available here. So I need some great recipes. Nice flavor with the seasonings.  But what are we suppose to do with the other half of the oil?? I put mine in the seasoning and poured over the top of the veggies. Enjoy! We did!

I made this with my boyfriend and it is delicious! We added lacinato kale and skipped the oyster sauce. Super yummy and a pretty healthy meal. Definitely recommend!!

This was a simple side dish that was very tasty! My guys who don’t like too many greens really enjoyed it. The sauce was delicious. I added a little more ginger that what was called for. I love bok Choy so I will definitely make it again and again.
Thanks.

I doubled the sauce, and sautéed 5 boneless, skinless chicken thighs  with1 T oyster sauce in oil before reducing the sauce.  Delicious!,  Kids loved it!

This was excellent!  I added a bell pepper for more veggies.  To the sauce, I added extra red pepper flakes and 1 t cornstarch so it'd thicken.  GREAT flavor!  Plus easy and quick!

My MIL likes to randomly give me various vegetables. This time she decided to give be a head of Bok Choy. Luckily I found this AMAZING recipe. My 2 y/o and I whipped it up this afternoon and the best part is my son really enjoyed it and had seconds and even thirds! I think next time I will cut the oil down a little bit to cut down on calories, but otherwise, I would keep everything as is. If you want more spice, you definitely need to up the chili flakes.

This was so yummy I ate the whole thing for lunch!  I did change up the addition of the sauce...added it just before the greens were completely wilted...also added some leftover turnips.  I grow both here, in my Phoenix garden.  Think I'll try this recipe again TOMORROW, using turnip greens!  I'll let you know how it turns out...

We made this delicious recipe and added shredded carrots and a leek.  It came out wonderfully.  This dish was so full of flavors and the leek added that little extra punch to the already huge explosion of flavors.  Thanks Spyce, you made our day

Shoot! We ate this so fast that I never had a chance to take a picture! Trying to add more greens to our diet and this recipe is a winner! It's not really Spicey but the flavor is perfect and it goes together quick and easy. I served it with grilled shrimp tossed in old bay and brown rice with wasabi and tamari. YUM!!!

This is very delicious! Instead of brown sugar I used palm sugar and I left out the sesame oil because I misplaced it in my pantry. With the remaining sauce in my serving bowl I added some cooked quinoa. The sauce took the quinoa to a tasty level. Great recipe!

I made this recipe last weekend, when my husband invited two of his buddies over for dinner. Everyone loved it and asked for recipe. I followed the recipe to the dot.... with one exception.... instead of 1TBS of brown sugar, I used 1 TSP of brown sugar. Our family tries to cut down on sugar consumption, and everyone agreed that 1 TSP was the right amount... just enough to elevate all the flavours in this dish.

I substituted a few things based on what I had in my garden and what I didn't have in my pantry. I used jalapeño instead of red pepper flakes, used powdered ginger, added cilantro, and sesame seeds. It was delicious.  I wouldn't recommend the jalapeño substitution unless you really like it hot!  I think the cilantro and sesame seeds were good additions. I think fresh ginger would have made it even better. I am going to make it again today with bok choy from my garden.  I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil

Excellent. Made it 4 or five times over this Winter using what is called Shanghai Bok Choi in Toronto. Now experimenting by sautéing Portobello mushrooms, returning these to the pot near end, adding sliced water chestnuts for crunch, have added shrimp at last 4 minutes, very versatile recipe. Thanks.

Great flavor, really served 2 in my opinion.  I substituted ground ginger and brown sugar splenda - no issues. Skipped the oyster sauce due to allergies.  Awesome side dish to Asian salmon recipe.

This is really a great tasting side dish.  It is so easy, fast, and delicious.  The recipe says it takes 30 minutes total time.  It has never taken me more than 15 minutes though.  I use pre-washed baby bok choy which helps cut down on prep time.  I've made it exactly as written with oyster sauce, and without using more soy sauce and a couple of dashes of fish sauce.  I like it both ways.  As written, it's wonderful!  We love this dish!

If you really want to make this different try adding a mixture of one or several or all of these schezuan pepper flakes,schezuan peppers the numbing ones, ghost pepper powder and trinidad scorpion pepper powder this makes the bok choy so good. The original version is very nice also though.

Pretty tasty. I found that 1 head of bok choy to be equivalent of 2 adult servings.

This is wonderful.  I followed some reviewers suggestion about the sweetness if using both brown sugar and oyster sauce and omitted the oyster sauce.  I added some julliened carrots and water chestnuts and 1 tbs. rice vinegar to balance it out.  Remember oriental cooks like to have sweet, hot, sour and salty flavors in the same dish!

Delicious and easy!  Used baby bok choy, and added shiitake mushrooms while cooking the bottoms.  Served over chow mein noodles. Would double sauce recipe next time, when serving with noodles.  Thank you, Spyce!

I loved this recipe. I added a bit more garlic. It's funny to see people add other vegetables to this recipe. I live in Taipei, Taiwan, and when you order bok choy at a restaurant here...this is exactly what you get- nothing but bok choy in a garlic/soy sauce! I like the simplicity of dishes here.
Thank you for this recipe, Spyce!

This was ok.  I follwed the recipe pretty closely, but found the bok choy got very watery once I removed it from heat and let it set.  When I added the sauce, it didn't cling to the bok choy, leaving the veggie pretty flavorless.  It was an ok preperation, but I won't do it again.

Very good recipe.  Well balanced flavor, although I used honey instead of the brown sugar.  the description on how to cook the bok choy was right on.

Great recipe!  The ONLY change I made was that I cut the water down to 1 Tablespoon since Bok Choy is such a watery vegetable to start with.  I love the veggie, but have had trouble cooking it correctly---this recipe hit the mark!  Thanks so much!

thought it was great.  careful not to overcook i over cooked mine a little and i think it would have been a bit better if i had been more "gentle" with the greens. flavor was wonderful the only reason i gave four stars is because it was a bit watery i think you could get by with not adding any water at all.  i followed the recipe and i think mine as overcooked because i was waiting to cook down the sauce so it would thicken like the recipe said.  i used a jar of pre-prepared stir-fry garlic and ginger paste.  about four bucks in the refrigerated fresh herb section.  really saved on time. flavor was  great will make again.

Great recipe for bok choy. I've been growing it for awhile but needed a new recipe for bugger. I didn't have quite enough garlic so I chopped some fresh basil which went well. I also used some fresh garden broccoli shoots which gave the dish a little more texture. Paired it with some brown rice and had a great meal. Thanks!

Yum! This was fabulous! I did make a couple changes - I used baby bok choy because we like that better. We also grilled these on the gas grill and it added tons of flavor. I wouldn't make them any other way. I also omitted the oyster sauce because I didn't have any and we don't really care for the fishy flavor it gives. This recipe was wonderful without it. I will definately be making this recipe over and over again!!!

Very good! This side dish has a nice, subtle flavor and a pleasant presentation. I did not have all of the ingredients available at the time, (i.e. sesame oil, fresh ginger, oyster sauce), so I doubled the amount of canola oil that I used and used 1 1/2 times the amount of soy sauce. I look forward to trying this recipe again with the ingredients that I did not have this time around and imagine that the added ingredients will lend more sweetness (from the sesame oil and oyster sauce) and a little spicy kick (from the ginger) to this dish. Yummy!

Excellent! I left out the oil and the ginger, and added about 4 additional cloves of garlic, which I sauteed/cooked with the bok choy at first. We've never had bok choy before, but we love it now!

I was in the process of making shrimp stir-fry and wanted a change of pace for my sauce. This was easy and I had most of the ingredients on hand. No oyster sauce, so I used the shrimp stock that I'd made from boiling the shrimp skins and left out the water. I had no light soy sauce, so I used regular.  I made twice as much because I was using it as the sauce for the entire dish-mixed veggies and shrimp. The result was delicious!!  UPDATE:  Just made this again, but with no oyster sauce or shrimp stock, and added a splash of rice wine vinegar; again, I left out the water. Couldn't taste the vinegar, but the resulting bok choy was very tasty!

This was delicious--followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't weigh the bok choy.  I may have had less than a pound, as I had extra sauce. I werved this with roasted chicken and baked potato, and enjoyed the extra sauce with bites of each!

Delicious way to cook Bok Choy.   I did everything as directed except the optional red pepper flakes but I may try that out next time.  Next time I  might add shrimp or chicken.

I added some veggies I had on hand (scallions, kale and purple cabbage) and substituted fish sauce (nam pla) for the oyster sauce, a pack of splenda for the brown sugar and garlic-chili hot sauce ("rooster sauce") for the chili flakes and served it with marinated pork tenderloin and it was GREAT!! The bitter greens made a very nice contrast with the pork. Super easy, too.

I love this sauce. I minced ginger root instead of grating it, and added minced garlic and green onions, too. Beside bok choy, I also threw in sliced veggies like carrots and mushrooms to make it in volume. Simple recipe, easy and quick, great side dish.

This was wonderful! I hardly ever follow the exact directions as I tweak most recipes to suit my family's taste, but this I made as directed. Excellent flavor. I doubled it and had some of the sauce to serve over our rice. Served with grilled chicken that had been marinated in bottled Soy Vay sauce.

Very good!  I had to omit the ginger as I didn't have any.  I used a red chili pepper paste to spice it up. Also, didn't have any oyster sauce so I subbed fish sauce and it was good.

This was great.  I added red bell pepper strips to the bok choy and stir-fried chicken separately.  With those add-ons, it was the perfect amount of sauce.  We served it over brown rice and it was a delicious-- will become a staple recipe, especially when we have baby bok choy.

This was a great base recipe.  I improvised a bit and added some toasted sesame seeds and red onion, left out the oyster sauce, and added Thai garlic pepper paste.  Over brown rice, it was a delicious, easy vegetarian dinner.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted delicious.  Hubby and I loved the sauce (we did add the red pepper flakes), and I'm going to adapt it for more stir fries.  This one's a keeper!

Excellent recipe! Made the recipe as is and it was very quick and easy.  My husband was weary as it was his first time having bok choy and he loves it now.

Update: Still making this recipe as is and love it, adding some crushed red pepper when we want some spice!

Great recipe and very tasty. It was the first time i made bok choy and it was a side dish for a chinese hot pot. However, I made a few modifications.. only used 1.5tbsp seasame oil, used black bean sauce instead of oyster (as I didn't have any on hand) and reduced the amt of sugar. Also I added the garlic, peppers and ginger to the oil directly to infuse more flavour.

Very tasty / healthy side dish. Made as is but ended up adding a bit of salt at the end since the stems don't soak up the sauce like the greens do.

This was very good.  I didn't add any sugar, as I didn't want sweet bok choy.  It ended up being a bit salty from the oyster sauce (I used low sodium soy), so I think I'll add it next time.  We loved the recipe and it'll be added to our repertoire.  Thanks.

Very tasty, but the receipe does not indicate what to do with the other half of the oil.  I used it to sautee shrimp to add to the dish.  I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Pretty good. I doubled the recipe and added in 6-7 cloves of garlic. I did find the recipe needed a bit of salt. I used vegetarian oyster sauce instead of regular sauce. I cooked the roots of bok choy and when they were almost cooked I added in some julienned carrots and once they were light green I set them aside. After I stir fried some onion and mushrooms and added the leafy part of the bok choy to that. Put that aside and cooked the sauce. Ate this dish with chow mein noodles.

Super easy, quick and tasty. Great with a little rice. Roasted the garlic a bit (just about golden) because my family did not like the near-raw garlic in some other dish.

I like it a lot, but I had to substitute some ingredients or else go to the store. I skipped the Sesame oil, used black bean sauce rather than oyster, and used a bit of Sweet and Spicy Tai sauce instead of the red peppers.  The end result was good but a little salty. I expect it is even better if you follow the recipe.

I made the recipe and used coconut oil and avocado oil in place of the other oils because of availability. I also added cherry tomatoes for a spontaneous color. I will make this again and keep experimenting with other variations.

Really fast to make.  Probably can alter the amount of garlic that you use to your tastes; my wife liked somewhat less.  Also a healthy dish to dieting and vegetarians.

I have made this several times for my husband and I and we love it.  I use fish sauce vs oyster only because that’s what I have on hand.  We like really spicy food so increase the crushed red peppers.  I also add bean sprouts only because they are so very yummy.  This recipe is quick and easy and a real favorite.

I gave it 5 stars but I didn't make it exactly the same but still delicious. I didn't use oyster sauce or brown sugar, used ground ginger and I added shrimp. I based it on this recipe because it was mine and my hubbies first time trying bok choy. Loved it! Thank you

This is good as is and great with some modifications. I cut the brown sugar by half, added an extra two cloves of garlic, extra chili flakes, and a generous squeeze of lime at the end. Since this makes so much sauce I also threw in some mushrooms and blanched broccoli, which makes this a very satisfying side dish. I'd imagine this would work great with almost any other kind of vegetable as well.

This is a regular in the dinner rotation. Sometimes as a  side,  others we make a dinner by adding some chicken or pork and cooking up some rice.  The flavor of this sauce is mouthwatering!

I served these to my sisters expecting to get razzed by them.  There wasn't a morsel left!  One sister remarked that she hadn't had bok choy since she lived in Hawaii ten years ago!  I rarely follow a recipe exactly, but I followed this one somewhat.  I had hoisin sauce on hand and used that instead of the oyster sauce.  Still very good.   I've made this three times and will make it again tonight with kung pao sauce.
Additional review.  I made this again last night adding toasted sesame seeds.  Awesome recipe!

This has become my go to recipe for bok choy. I just love it! FYI, I usually substitute fish sauce for the oyster sauce since I have that on hand, plus I add a wee bit of hoisin sauce and actually cook the garlic with the veggies. Tastes amazing!

Made this for my daughter who is vegan. My oyster sauce had no mention of oysters in the list of ingredients. I added a sliced carrot, 1/4 an onion and a sliced mushroom for a little extra variety. I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful!

Had never made just bok choy before and this was a fantastic way to start. I left out the red pepper, (because no one in our family likes spicy Asian food,) and added some broccoli.  Didn’t matter. Was a delicious sauce for vegetables and easy to make. Will definitely be using the recipe again and trying the sauce with other vegetable.

4.22.18  Perfect blend of sweet-spicy and crunchy bok choy.  This is so good that I could make a dinner out of just this!  Served today with basmatic rice and Scallops a la Peking House from this site.  Thanks for a new winner recipe!

taste was very nice but I had to put this aside for a few minutes while I completed another dish and it ended up very limp after sitting around for a few minutes.  Maybe stop cooking a little sooner next time

Delicious.  Great flavors.  At first you think you have too much Bok choy but it cooks down quickly.  To add more greens and make our veggie side bigger we added in spinach.  So good

The sauce was great - I just added extra garlic! I like my bok choy a little soft so I cooked it a little longer than the recipe said. My husband and I ate the whole thing with rice for dinner. It was filling and delicious. Next time I will add a little more red pepper, and I will try adding a little sake!

I was looking for a different side dish rather than the same old vegetables. This was very easy and made a nice sauce. I might try it again adding some other vegetables for variety.

Wow, wow,  wow!  Fantastic! I added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms just after the stems, then added cherry tomatoes to the empty skillet before heating the sauce. Removed the tomatoes after a couple minutes, made the sauce, then threw everything back and tossed. Served it over brown rice for a delicious, meatless meal. I didn't have or want oyster sauce --- just added an extra tsp of soy sauce and used only 2 tsp brown sugar.

I love this! To make it into a full meal, I add shrimp and serve over rice. Plus I try to brown the bok choy a little and it seems to take on the Sauce faster than not doing so. I've made this twice now. The second time I used a little less water and the sauce thickened up so nicely.

reading through the reviews i was worried this was going to be a little boring so i made a few changes.. i was looking for inspiration for a sauce to put over some stir fried veggies.. i left out the veg oil, stir fried the veggies (carrots, celery, squash, orange baby bell peppers & mushrooms) in the sesame oil, subbed fresh squeezed orange juice for the water, used regular soy sauce, subbed honey for the brown sugar (only using half the amount), and added 1/4 tsp of chinese five spice and some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.. this would go great over rice or quinoa.. ty for the start of a tasty dish

I received two large bunches of bok choy in my farm box this week so I made this as a side to go with grilled meat.  It was a hit.

My husband and I liked the flavor, but it was too bland, I added more garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce , ginger and red pepper flakes which helped, but we still wanted more flavor.  I also added cooked shrimp to the dish, which was a nice touch. I think I would only make this again as a side dish, for which it was intended

My husband & I enjoyed this dish very much! I did add two ingredients in the recipe: fish tofu, tempe, and Indonesian sweet soy sauce (Ketjap Manis is the brand). I got the fish tofu from local Asian store and Whole Foods market for the other.  I would cook tempe first with cooking oil (per recipe) then added the rest per recipe.  I would think just add all ingredients per recipe would have been great! I just wanted to use other ingredients before they go bad. Enjoy!

Used bacon fat instead of vegetable oil (because bacon makes everything better!) Added cabbage in with the bok choy stems. Used 3/4 of what the brown sugar called for. Came out very tasty! I'll make it again for sure.

We loved this recipe!!!!  We added sliced mushrooms to it and didn't add the brown sugar.   Next time (tomorrow) I will add 1 tbs of corn starch to the sauce.   Thank you for this recipe.  It has so much flavor.

I really enjoyed the sauce it was great. I did modify to what I had. 
Sauce - oyster sauce, soy sauce, Asian chili paste and brown sugar 
Veggies - I added carrots, onion and mushrooms 

I cooked the veggies with olive oil because I didn't have other items on had. I would love to try the original recipe to see the difference with the depth of flavor but my way was great because I feel that it was the base for the sauce. 
The sauce would be great over rice and adding either shrimp or chicken. 
I am trying to eat a vegetarian meal once a week and this was a great meal in itself. I would make this again.

Delicious! I omitted the oyster sauce because I didn't have it and I used coconut oil because I just ran out of olive oil. Still came out great! Only had coconut sugar in the cupboard and used that, and this still tasted fantastic. I did add some shallots and extra soy sauce to the mix. This is a keeper!

Superb dish as is.  To make this an entrée, I added one red bell pepper, one carrot sliced on bias with the bok choy stems, then added one can of straw mushrooms, one can sliced water chestnuts and one can baby corn cut into thirds with the bok choy leaves.  Doubled the sauce mixture and served with Jasmin rice.  Topped with toasted sesame seeds.  It was tough to quit going back for more.

Amazing!  My husband who doesn't really like bok choy loved it.  Said it was the best bok choy he's ever had.  I'll be making this again.

It's not very flavorful. I was expecting more flavor but definitely good for a quick meal

Flavor was good, but sauce was watery.  I also added some carrot and chicken.  Was tasty, but liked other stir fry recipes better.

Since it is sauteed in oil first, the sauce just slips off the bok choy and doesn't permeate. I put the sauce on the fish I cooked with it, and all enjoyed.  Need another bok choy recipe though!

Great flavor but too much sauce for our taste - next time I plan on cutting the sauce amount in half.

Great flavor and my husband really liked it, but it was a little watery for me.

I added a container of tofu and half a can of beef broth.  We all liked this one.

I think I over cooked the bok choy as there was too much liquid when I added the sauce a little runny but still very tasty. I served it on a bed of rice with grilled extra large shrimp excellent..

Pretty decent recipe, nothing terribly exciting, but given the ease of making it and the relatively short list of ingredients, this is a keeper.
