Very simple and tasty. I am only giving this 4 stars because of the serving sizes. I made 1 serving and wound up with enough eggs to cover 2+ muffins.

Wasn't Sure how this was going to turn out but to my surprise this is extremly good! A little to much salt, Next time i am going to half it. But other than that this is one of my newest Favorites.
