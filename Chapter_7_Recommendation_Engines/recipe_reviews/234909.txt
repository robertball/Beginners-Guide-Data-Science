I diced 2 apples, soaked them in orange juice, and made 24 phyllo cups instead of 12 flat sqares (cut the sheets into 12 and used a half thickness to form the cups in a mini muffin tin). I used about a pea-size cube of butter and drizzled with Cherry preserves (with a splash of OJ to help thin it). Flavor combo was on point and used ingredients that I had.

Really awesome. But in my usual cooking style, even though I'm not a baker, I had to make some revisions. First, instead of lemonade I tossed the apple slices in lemon juice with some cinnamon and brown sugar - not much. I put only a little bit of butter on top and when it came out of the oven drizzled less than a teaspoon of no sugar added (warmed on the stove) apricot jam. Delicious!!

I did substitute Splenda for sugar as my husband is a diabetic.  Otherwise, followed recipe and it turned out great.  It was a nice treat for my husband who doesn't get a lot of desserts anymore.

Easy recipe and the dessert was good! I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar before sprinkling the mixture over the tartlets prior to baking. I also used peach preserves because that's all I could find at the store. I added cinnamon and a little sugar to the preserves as well. Nice and flaky crust paired nicely with the thinly sliced apples. I only used 2 apples and just over a 13 ounce puff pastry split into 16 rectangles.

We loved it! I ended up using peach preserves instead of apricot because that is what I had on hand.Big hit at our party! Such a buttery, sweet taste!

Didn't turn out so great I think because the butter pays I used were probably too big, so it took almost double the time to bake. Would be better if the pastry were drier. The taste was good if you like apricot preserves. I do, but my family did not. Maybe an apple flavored preserve would be better for them.

This was very good. I always have apples on hand and I had to use up some puff pastry. I only needed 3 apples for both sheets and I used granny smiths. I also subbed  cran-lemonade and raspberry jam- it was what I had on hand. I had to add 7 more minutes to the baking process and up the temp to 375.
