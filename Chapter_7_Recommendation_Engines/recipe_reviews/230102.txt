My grandmother had a therapeutic chicken noodle soup recipe as well. It is similar to this one but tastes MUCH better by far.  And I will tell you why.  
You first boil a whole cut up chicken with BONES IN and SKIN ON!  this is the flavor of the whole soup. Don't use chicken bullion because you are just putting artificial flavoring in and too much preservatives.  After your chicken is boiled, remove chicken from pot. Skim off fat.  Cook all your fresh vegetables in chicken stock you just made.  After veggies are tender, remove skin and bones from chicken (if desired) and cut chicken in small bite sizes to desired sizes and return chicken to pot with veggies.  Cook as long as you like on stove.  When cooking is done, boil egg noodles in separate pan with water.  Only add noodles to bowl of soup when you want to eat.  Keep cooked noodles separate in container and add as you eat soup.  Keeps noodles from sogginess.  Grandma' secret.  There it is!!  Wonderful yummy!!

I really liked this soup.  It is exactly what it is supposed to be and that is a basic recipe for chicken and noodle soup, and you can adjust the measurement of the ingredients to suit your tastes.  The only change I made was to cut back on the water, I thought that was too much water, I like a chunkier soup, but that is a personal preference.

As for the person who said this gave her a stomach ache?? There is nothing in this recipe that would cause someone to get sick unless they have an allergy to one of the ingredients or perhaps she used spoiled chicken?  I don't know, but to blame the recipe on her stomach bug is beyond ridiculous.

I hate to give a new recipe such a mediocre review, but.... This wasn't to my liking at all (sorry!). I can't put my finger on it, but this just didn't taste right and left me and my hubs with a terrible belly ache (which wasn't a good thing for me since I am already battling the stomach flu). It was probably the flu (and my hubs coming down with the flu) that caused our discomfort, but it was sure a coincidence.... That aside, while my hubs and I didn't think this was terrible, we both agreed that we've had better. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do much for us. Thanks anyways, BakerBee. :-)

I use bouillon granules (and chicken base) more than bouillon cubes, and the cubes that I used for this recipe had been in the cabinet for a while.  Although they tasted fine, I think that's why the soup is darker in color than a traditional chicken soup  (impact on appearance only).  I used peas only, rather than peas & carrots, since this recipe already has chopped carrots.  From an eye appeal perspective, IMO sliced carrots would look better in this soup.  I did cut back on the water, omitted the salt because of the bouillon cubes, and after tasting when cooking was complete, added some parsley flakes and a little bit of marjoram.  Pretty nice chicken noodle soup.

The only thing I did differently was instead of using 12 cups water (3 quarts) I used 10 cups of water. I like my soup a little thicker, that's all. Other than that it tasted great, and my man loved it also!

Great Starter recipe. I also cut back the water we prefer chunkier soups. I also added some corn. I didn't have packaged noodles on hand so made my own noodles. I used the same dough recipe I use for homemade PA duch style pot pie ( many would say chicken and dumplings) but cut noodle strips instead of squares. The entire family thought it was great. I didn't have any leftovers and my husband informed me that he wants me to always make it this way with homemade noodles.

I made this on a chilly winter day and it was a hit with everyone!  My boyfriend isn't a fan of peas, so I omitted the frozen peas and carrots and added more fresh carrots, celery, and onion.  It seemed a little light on the herbs and spices, so I added more for flavor to suit my tastes.  I thought the recipe would make enough to freeze quite a bit for an easy meal later (not that this is hard), but the crew left very little over and everyone commented several times on how yummy it was.  I didn't think it was too watery or anything like that, I liked the consistency and this will now be my go-to recipe for my favorite comfort food!

Very nice recipe! Only think - I pre-fried the onions to a golden brown before adding. Yummy!

I made this soup for the first time tonight, and my husband and I loved it. I used the recommended 3 quarts of water, and it wasn't too liquidy at all. In fact, I ended up adding more water before reheating the soup for supper. While the stock was heating up, I cut up raw chicken breasts, added frozen peas, along with the carrots, celery and onion. I then added black pepper, basil, and oregano. Since bouillon was already added, I saw no reason the add more salt. I cooked the soup for 20 minutes, then added the egg noodles, and cooked another 15 min. I made the soup in the morning, and just needed to reheat later on for supper. We had corn muffins and a salad with it. It was the perfect meal for a rainy day. My husband had two bowls, and there is plenty for tomorrow night too. This will be a go to chicken soup recipe.

Used this recipe as the basis for the soup I just made my family. My father just got out of the hospital and has to eat a more strict diet, so I've been making everything from scratch this week. I used the low-sodium chicken and vegetable stock I made yesterday instead of bouillon, added in some broccoli, cauliflower, and green peppers, and also used Bucatini instead of egg noodles (only because I didn't have any on hand).  The house smells delicious and just cooking it made everyone hungry.  Glad to use this as a great base for many different types of soups from here on out. Next time I have all the ingredients as written I will definitely write another review.

Very glad to have another chilly day here in Florida so we had another excuse to make some soup. :-)

My review for this (so-called) Chicken Soup (disaster) is less than 1*.  Folks who made it and liked it OBVIOUSLY aren't any kind of cooks, nor do they care about their health This recipe also calls for 8 additional chicken bullion cubes, (which are 840 mg.of sodium EACH).... for an additional total of 6,720 mg. of sodium in this soup.  Sometimes, 'short-cut' recipes don't work very well (as in this recipe), so why not make a REAL Chicken Soup from scratch.  It may take longer, but will be well worth the time & the effort.

This recipe is easier than many soups as you cook everything in the same pot. My family loved the deep chicken flavor and the thickness of the soup. It makes a lot! I put a whole bag (8cups) of egg noodles and 6 bouillon cubes. We thought perfect!

I doubled the amount of veggies (and added some fun off-recipe veggies)  because my  BF likes hearty soup. The soup being PACKED with veggies and chicken made it awesome. It turned out extremely savory. We had so much soup and we ate it all in 3 days. My BF  kept eating it for lunch and dinner. We'll definitely make this again. Bookmarked this recipe!
  
1. Easy/Fun to make
2. Tasty & delicious - great recipe!

I really loved this recipe and I will be making it many more times!  I made 6 servings instead of 12 servings the first time in case I didn't like it, but I was very pleasantly surprised with how it turned it out.

I added a little more water than the recipe called for since I like my soups a little more brothy, and I added a little more salt (kosher salt).

Then to add more flavor  I added half a packet of Lipton Recipe Secrets - Garlic & Herb. To thicken the broth a little I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch (which I dissolved in water  first) and cooked in the soup for a few minutes toward the end of the cooking time.  The next time I make it I'm going to take some of the other reviewer's advice and grill the onions first before adding to the soup, may substitute some of the veggies with broccoli and/or cauliflower, and use skinless chicken thighs (either boneless or bone-in)  instead of chicken breasts for even more flavor.  I'll also make cornbread to go with this soup the next time (see an excellent recipe on this website - Homesteader Cornbread - has some sweetness to it - be sure to brown top for delicate crispy crust); but this time I had sourdough artisan bread topped with real butter.   YUMMY!!

A hearty soup that the hubby liked too! I reduced water to 2 quarts to make a thicker soup. I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I added a bit more salt, oregano, pepper, and added minced garlic and rosemary. I also used chicken thigh meat, which almost tasted like dark turkey meat with a tasty buttery quality.

This was a pretty good soup to serve my family as we are all nursing colds. I used unsalted chicken stock, and left out the salt. I also only had 2 chicken breasts, so I added an extra cup of the frozen veggies to make up some of the difference. I used whole wheat egg noodles, used 1/4 tsp Italian herb seasoning instead of the basil and oregano, and left out the bay leaves (didn't have any). I cut the celery and carrots into slices rather than chopped, out of preference. After getting the water, stock and bouillon boiling, I added the whole chicken breasts, carrots, celery, onions, pepper and herbs, let boil 20 minutes, and then shredded the chicken. Then I added the frozen veggies and let those cook for just a few minutes, and then added the noodles for about 10 minutes. The only other change I would make next time is to reduce the amount of black pepper by just a smidge.

This recipe needs fresh parsley root and leaves, fresh dill.   I use chicken stock with a little added water... no bouillon because it adds too much salt.  A little kosher salt is good to add. Or you can add a small amount of soy sauce to the soup instead of salt.  Just remember that a little soy sauce goes a long way.  The skin and bones of the chicken add a ton of flavor.  Just remove them (along with the parsley leaves and dill if you choose) before serving,  I happen to like eating the parsley and dill with the soup.  You can also cut them up into smaller pieces before adding them to the soup so they can remain as part of the richness of the soup.
