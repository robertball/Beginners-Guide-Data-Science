This is a pretty good recipe, it does need something but not sure what.  I also added half can of drained peas/carrots, some chopped green bell peppers and some cubed chicken.  I don't think it needs more soy sauce but it does lack some sort of spice. Either way, will make again and plan to experiment.  Very easy and good, quick lunch or side dish.

Great recipe! I substituted carrots for the green beans because that's all that was on hand. Turned out wonderfully! Thanks for the recipe!

I made fried rice a long time ago and attempted it again today using this recipe as my guideline.  I altered it a little but had great results.  I didn't use the green beans. I shredded about a 1/2 cup of cabbage and several spinach leaves and sauteed this along with chopped garlic.  I also threw in a handful of bean sprouts and shredded carrots.  I used a little more soy sauce than called for..(but I love soy sauce, so for me the more the merrier).  I made this to go along with the broiled tilapia recipe also found on this site.  Thanks Krista.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I don't use the greenbeans though.  I use about 1/2 cup frozen corn (or 1 ear of fresh corn cut from the cob) and about 1/2 cup frozen peas. Definately use 2 eggs.  This goes so well with Honey Pork Oriental, a recipe you can also find here.

Excellent! I am such a fried rice fan but have never previously attempted to make this dish at home. Constantly was ordering this dish frequently at restaurants and never NOT order it when eating chinese/thai/japenese food. It occured to me that it would be fabulous to simulate the type of fried rice I devoured at these restaurants right at home. This recipe looked the easiest as I am by no means an experienced cook. I put in green onions and carrots instead of normal onions and beans and I also had left over chicken breast which I sliced up and added in to make it "Chicken Fried Rice". At the last minute I realized I had no Soy Sauce left so I improvised and used Lea and Perrins Worschestire Sauce instead. It turned out to be delicious!! Obviously, It didn't have the soy sauce flavour but what I ended up with was tasty and unique. This was soooo easy to make and I am considering making it again tommorow! This is a home run!!!

I'm sorry to say this but this is the worst fried rice that I have ever had. I just made it a few minutes ago and I had to end up throwing it all away.I was really expecting something much better from all the reviews that I read. I would have to say that I would never make this again, I'm goin to stick to my usual recipe.

This should really be 2.5 stars. I made the following changes to the recipe: sesame oil instead of veggie oil; 1 cup mixed frozen (thawed out) veggies instead of onion and green beans. I also used low sodium soy sauce. The rice came out pretty tasty for homemade Chinese food, but it was a bit too salty for my palate. I might decrease the salt next time to 1/4 tsp since soy sauce has a good amount of salt in it to begin with. I also feel like the taste is "missing something," though I have no idea what. I will look to reviewers' comments next time to make improvements. Will try this again and play with it a bit.

This was very tasty.  I added ginger and used peas instead of green beans.  Next time I will omit the extra salt, because this was a bit salty but as it sits it gets a good flavor.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good. It can be made much better with a few substitutions. I used short grain Asian rice for a more authentic result. Cooked the rice in chicken stock (1 part rice to 2 parts stock) laced with the soy sauce. Great touch for even flavor penetration - much more effective than sprinkling on the soy sauce at the end and stirring in. Added a tsp of very finely chopped ginger which lent a lovely fragrance and taste. Stir fried everything using a touch of sesame oil. Minced scallions were subbed for the onion. Skipped the green beans and subbed baby peas. Some water chestnuts adds a nice crunch. All of these "subs" were pretty simple and gave a deeper, more authentic Asian flavor. This recipe is, however, an excellent basic spring board for countless variations.

The one cup of water to cook rice alone is hilarious. Use two cups of water to a boil, add rice and then STEAM your rice. Nonetheless I followed the recipe and the rice was hard as predicted and the recipe was bland. I added some garlic and spicy stir fry sauce and it seemed to help somewhat.

This recipie was great.  I added two extra eggs cause I love them and I added cayenne pepper and saffron for a special kick.  Also I used a veggie stir fry mix finely chopped instead of the veggies listed on the recipie.  This was my first time making this dish and it turned out great.

Bland. For those who are complaining that one cup of water isn't enough to cook the rice, you need to read your recipe better. This recipe calls for INSTANT RICE. The ratio of water to regular rice is 1:2. However the ratio of water to INSTANT RICE is 1:1.

I wouldn't make this if I had a craving for amazing fried rice, but as a quick flexible side it was very good. I used chicken broth instead of water, and with the soy it gave me a nicely flavored base. The egg was delicious and filling, I might add two next time. Thanks for sharing.

my fave for fried rice! Cooking the rice in the soy sauce is the touch I wanted, rather than just adding it at the end. Use any veggies you like (I've never made with green beans) it's great with anything, even adding pork or chicken works out great!

My husband loves fried rice so I thought I'd give this a try.  I'm glad I did.  It was delicious!  I did use the 2 eggs as suggested and chicken broth.  Next time, I think I'll cut back on the soy sauce a bit.  It was a little salty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added an extra egg like everyone said to do.  I also used broccoli instead of green beans.  I had to add like a tablespoon of spike also.

Tried this last night. It was so quick and easy to make. I love recipes that don't require a added  trip to the store. I made it with peas and an extra egg. I thought it needed something but will definatly try it again with different veggies and seasonings. The kids loved it! Good recipe.

I used green onions, sliced mushrooms and peas and left out the green beans.

Quick, easy and pleasing!  I served the rice with the "Sweet & Sour Chicken I" from this site.  A delicious meal.

Yum! I forgot to add the soy sauce to the rice water, so I just added it when I mixed the rice with the veggies and onions. I also used two eggs, since I love scrambled eggs. I didn't have canned or fresh green beans on hand, so I used a frozen veggie mix (corn, carrots and green beans) that I had. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this.  I made it for my extended family and my sister-in-law had to have the recipe.  Instead of using green beans, I use a small can of peas & carrots, which is makes it more like the fried rice that we are used to eating.

Great recipe for on-hand ingredients and really tasty!  i only had 2 soy sauce packets but three would have been optimal, and i used 1/2 box of frozen mixed veggies.

This was easy to fix, even for a rookie, and it's a treat for the taste buds. Instead of green beans, I used 1/2 cup of asparagus and 1/2 cup of Chineese snow peas. It's so good, it could be a meal in itself!

This was such an easy way to make fried rice!  I added an extra egg, some peas, and leftover cooked turkey for a really tasty main dish.  My husband and four year old son both loved it and my hubby asked me to make it again soon!  Thanks!

This recipe was so tasty and so easy to make. I followed some of the other reviews & added an extra egg and instead of green beans I used frozen peas(1 cup). This is a keeper. Thanks!

This is the best fried rice I've ever had that wasn't from a restaurant (it's the closest thing to Chinese restaurant fried rice I've tasted).  It needs a little more egg and beans, I think.

Quite good, needs a little more egg in my opinion. But I will tinker with it as I will definitely be making it again. My toddler loves the fried rice at our favorite Chinese restaurant, and often asks me for "rice and peas" for lunch, so I've been looking for a good recipe. This is the best one I've found.

I was so excited to make this, and after all was said and done, I felt it was just okay.  I added frozen peas as well as a can of mushrooms, because I thought that the dish was quite bland.  Per other reviewers, I added one more egg (although a third would probably be the best choice) and then added garlic as well.  I will definately try this again but tweek it alittle more to my liking!

This tasted nothing like fried rice from a chinese restaurant.  It just tasted like rice with egg in it.  It was really bland.  I guess some things just can't be replicated at home.

Great recipe. I recommend little less onion and instead of green beans use canned peas and carrots. Really any way you like it it can be cooked. Great recipe though. I loved it.

Great recipe ! Just made it for lunch and was great !
I added in some chopped ham which was delicious. The only issue was that I needed to return the rice to the stove as it wasn't cooked enough. Quick and easy and will be made again !

This was quick, easy and delicious.  I added a bit of leftover chicken and some garlic, and left out the salt and papper.  It is so good I had a hard time NOT finishing off what was left at the end of the meal!   Oh, and I used instant brown rice because I didn't have any white rice.  I will use brown rice the next time, too.

Rice turned out well, soaked the rice in a cold bath for 30 minutes. Then sauteed in salted butter and vegetable oil. Cooled in fridge for 1 hour. Followed by sauteing green onions in vegetable oil, adding rice and 2 eggs, 2 table spoons of soy sauce. Even tho this isnt the recipe, i looked at this when i made it.

This is how I made it. I sauted frozen peas and carrots a 12oz bag with half a white onion. Then I added cubbed ham about 1/2 cup and put that with the vegetables. Then I added the egg and scrambled it for 2mins and put 3 cups of cooked white rice in with soy sauce oh my goodness it was heaven

This is a great recipe.  I substituted green beans with half a bag of frozen peas and carrots.  I added bean sprouts and sliced green onions.  Also, once all in the same pan, add sesame oil and stir at high heat for maximum flavor before serving.

So easy and delicious- cooked brown rice in a rice cooker then added the soy to it after- fried up edamame, shredded carrot and fresh corn with the onion then added the egg then added the rice and fried it up for a couple of minutes- this is a great recipe for kids!

Yum!  I added chicken and used peas instead of green beans.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp. or so of garlic powder.  4 stars as written and five with the changes.  Thanks Krista B.!

This was the first time for me to make home made fried rice and it couldn't have been easier, or tastier.  I did add carrots and garlic instead of onions and green beans, but that is because that was all I had.  I will be making this again.  Also I read another review and I agree, 2 eggs is better.

1) You must use cold rice to make proper egg fried rice. If you are really in a pinch, spread it out on a pan and broil it under low heat, stirring frequently, to get some of the moisture out. This isn't ideal and the texture will still be effected, but it is much better than using rice fresh out of the pan.  2) Oil makes it taste..well, oily. Use butter instead.   3) I just add the soy sauce once the rice is in the pan.

I'm also sorry to say that this is the worst fried rice recipe ever. Had I read the reviews I would have known...I followed the recipe and added less soy sauce and it was still extremely salty! WOW! I was disappointed! : (     If anyone uses this recipe OMIT the salt and ADD garlic and ginger to flavor it some more. Use chilled cooked rice for the best results as the glucose won't be as high when it's cold-meaning less stickiness in the end.

The dish as-is is only average, but it gives a nice base to build on by adding other ingredients.  I've added ground beef, sliced chicken and different spices (cumin, coriander and cayenne being the top three) at various times to turn this into a recipe worth making again and again.

This recipe turned out great! I did tweak it a little. I started with the rice like the recipe says and let it sit. I used olive oil and fried the fresh onion and frozen peas and frozen corn on medium heat. I let it take it's time, added some salt. Then I added two eggs instead of one, let that fry for some time, still on medium heat, added a little more salt. I then added the rice and fried it some more on medium heat. My hubby loved it and so did I. I would like to try adding some meat next time.

For the time and energy you put into making this, it can't be beat. I added a little extra egg and also had some shrimp to toss in to it. Very good. Thanks.

This is the easiest fried rice ever. No need to precook and chill the rice, so it can be made with very little advanced planning. I substituted frozen peas for the green beans--it was a huge hit and so quick to make!

Very good.  I like a little more egg in mine, so I'd probably put in 1 additional egg.  Also, made a nice amount that was eaten up in one meal--no leftovers!  Which is great.

Yum! I didn't have green beans but for just a simple fried rice, it's great and beats the little instant fried rice kits I *used* to buy. This will become a staple side dish for me.

This is a good recipe to have on hand, especially if you make a lot of chinese food.  I used real rice (I had to steam it 20 minutes and add another cup of water) so it took longer but it was still very good.  I also added another egg and omitted the green beans because I don't like them.  Next time, I might add just a little less onion.

This was the first time I've made fried rice. This recipe worked, but I won't use it again. It had a very heavy "brown" taste, and it took much longer than 2-3 minutes to properly cook the onions and other vegetables. Maybe if you cut the amount of soy sauce and added something else...like garlic?...the recipe would be improved.

This is by far the very best homemade fried rice I have ever tasted!  I omitted the green beans, substituted green pepper, and added a little pork to make it meaty.  This recipe is extremely versatile - you can add nearly anything you want - and it still tastes better than any fried rice I've had from takeout.  A definite winner!  :-)  Thanks, Krista!

UPDATE:  2/15/08
I decided to clean out my recipe box and to re-review the recipes that I haven't made in a while, and this one still rates as one for permanent rotation.  I make this all the time, with chicken, pork, any meat that you can think of, and it tastes delicious again and again.

This recipe isn't great. It gives you no directions for how long to cook the rice. Following the vague instructions, makes your rice come out crunchy and undone.

Used Frozen Rice with Veggies to save time, and added fresh green onion, chopped garlic, and a little less soy sauce. (And of course the egg) It was delish!!!! We've made it twice! And didn't have any leftovers either, it was that yummy!!!!

Super simple and delicious, though I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil for added taste.  I also added some diced chicken I baked the night before and about a tablespoon of onion powder.  A favorite at my house now!

We like to make this recipe to serve under sweet and sour stir fry chicken. I cook the onion and some sugar snap peas together first, then add the rice and egg. Yummy :)

This dish was a hit by my husband and 10 year old step son. I modified it slightly by using lower sodium soy sauce, no onion, and a clove of minced garlic. I will definitely make again!

Just made this because I didn't really have many things to eat for lunch. I did have white rice, carrots, onions and garlic! I rinsed the white rice so I could get rid of some of the starch that makes it clump up. Followed the instructions to the letter (sans rice) and added a bit more soy sauce while it was cooking. I let it sit for a while (about 15 minutes) stirring it a bit every 3 minutes. Came out crispy and delicious, I mean, even the egg tastes really nice and I'm not a fan of egg yolks. I doubled up on egg, rice, onions, garlic and carrots because I was really hungry.

It's a great recipe with the ingredients it has. Not many people have sesame oil lying around, or oyster sauce. I had veggie oil and basic vegetables, so I went with it, and it was good.

Very tasty.  I used brown rice and cooked it in low sodium chicken broth and soy sauce.  I let it cool in the fridge for a few hours and then sauteed onion, garlic, peas, green pepper and spam (all finely diced) and added two eggs to that.  The original recipe was a great jumping off point.

I guess we are to spoiled with the restaurant style fried rice in our area. We didn't care for this at all. Very bland. The reviewer that said something was missing was right. I even tired adding more soy sauce, garlic, and onion powder. Still flavorless. Bummer!

I just cooked this Fried Egg Rice Recipe. However, after reading the reviews I didn't add soy sauce and I didn't make it with beans. I added my own twist in it by adding Chilli peppers sauce and yellow Capicum. It tastes great and spice adds to the flavour. Other then that the recipe is OK.

This was great and super easy, which is great for me. I also managed to make it really cheap. Of course, I added things. This time around I did Turkey Meat Balls and was a little heavy on the Soy Sauce. It was delicious though. Even my finicky mother enjoyed it.

I made some changes to this recipe which contribute to the 5-star rating.  I thought I would share those changes for any who may be interested.  We don't care for minute rice and we had some leftover rice that we wanted to use (particularly considering the rice shortage these days) so I used that instead.    I followed the directions to saute the onions and green beans, but added some carrots and peas in addition.  I used 2 eggs instead of one.  Then I put in my rice.  It needed some moisture in reheating and so I used 1 cup of chicken bouillon (to add more flavor).  Everything else I did the same.  My husband loved it and that really does say a lot for this recipe.

I paired this recipe with Sweet and Sour Chicken 1 from this site and had sauteed pineapple and bell peppers as another side. It made for an amazing dinner, much better than any Chinese restaurant that I've ever eaten in and for a fraction of the cost. This is a very simple recipe, easy to make and has a great flavor. I didn't have to go out and buy anthing to do it, the only change I made was that I added steamed peas instead of green beans and it turned out great. Also I didn't add any extra salt that it called for because Soy tends to be so salty anyway.

I only had regular rice so I added more water and a bit more soy sauce and increased the cooking time.  I didn't have green beans so I used soybeans instead.  Really liked the recipe.  Will definately make again.

Wow - this is really good.  i've been looking for a good fried rice recipe. i had to double it due to our rice cooker, but hey, just means more for later.  i did half soy and half teriyaki sauce and substituted peas and corn for green beans, would probably throw some carrot in too next time. it came out a *little* dry, probably due to sitting in the rice cooker, but nothing a little more teriyaki couldn't fix. definitely a repeat recipe!

Very good basic recipe. I substitued peas for string beans.  I doubled the recipe for a family of 3. This is a great recipe b/c it's a good base recipe and you can do all sorts of variations off of this one.

Good. I will make again because it was quick and easy. I like a lot of egg in my fried rice, so I added another egg and some green onion for color instead of the green beans. Hubby liked it so it will definitely make it back on our to make list.

Used canned green beans. Added some red pepper flakes & garlic powder. Served along with Ginger Veggie Stir-Fry & Pork Tenderloin (both from this site) along with an Asian inspired fruit salad made with bananas, mangos, apples, oranges, strawberries, topped with almonds.

fabulous! I used regular rice and just added an extra cup of water and cooked it like normal. I also used frozen peas and carrots for the veggies and i just used a bit of cooking spray instead of the oil. I'll definitly be making it again!

I loved this recipe!!! My 20 month old son ate 3 bowls of it! I used some mixed veggies and used a little more soy sauce. and it was sooo yummy!! I will be making this again!! I also left out the onions. Next time I plan to use the bean sprouts in it. Thanks!!!

After I started making this I realized I was out of green beans....so instead of adding the regular onion I decided to use green onion for the color factor.  It turned out ok.  Not my favorite recipe, but I liked it.  Thanks for the post.

A very awesome and easy and fast recipe! Thanks so much. I tried it twice, once with mushrooms because I ran out of green beans. It was equally good. Probably any kind of vegetables would be good.

This rice was wonderful! Instead of beans I used peas and carrots. Everthing else was by the book and perfect. I will definitely make it again.

I will stick with my regular recipes for fried rice. The green beans were awful and I think that using regular rice, cooked ahead, works best for fried rice.

Finally, the true secret to excellent fried rice, fry the darn egg first; none of this omelet making, slicing into strips rubbish... but of course!  Thank you - after 30 years, it's great to get it right.

I thought it was ok.. my husband didn't care for it much he said it tasted like curry was added, I don't carry curry in my house so I don't know where he got that from. I don't think I will make it again.  I will be on the hunt for another fried rice recipe.

Great Recipe! You can adjust the soy amount to taste...goes well with grilled chicken!  I also used peas once when I didn't have green beans. great way to get the kids to eat them. Thanks!

My family did not like this recipe. I felt bad because they only "picked" at dinner. I did not use instant rice and I don't know if that had anything to do with the lack of flavor or not. Another reviewer used non-instant rice so I felt safe. I would not make this recipe for my family again. I have made fried rice before that came out much better. I tried this one because my family loves egg. To end on a positive note, thank you for taking the time to share perhaps this recipe was just not our taste.

good.  I didn't use green beans-instead I used asparagus and celery and red onions.  I added a tiny bit more soy sauce.  it was good enough to keep taking bites before the rest of the supper was done.

This recipe was ok. Unfortunately, my husband is picky so I had to omit the veg. Probably would have been better if I could have left them.

Quick and easy recipe. I like the flexibility of the ingredients. The only veggies I used in making this (the only ones I had on hand!) were white onions, scallions, and garlic (no meat added) and still it was fine. I've also made the House Fried Rice which is also a good recipe that I would recommend but I think this one is easier if you don't want to make a big deal. I will be making it again. You might want to cut the soy sauce just a bit if you don't like it strong.

Good recipe, good and simple. I used peas in place of green beans.
