Though this takes several steps, the results are well worth it.  We actually completed the recipe in less than an hour, and used a hand-blender instead of mashing the sweet potatoes & lentils.  The flavors are perfect together-hearty, nutritious and spicy(but not too).  One of the most delicious soups we have made from an allrecipes.com recipe.  Thanks!

I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers since I didn't have either ingredient and this worked out well.  I also sauteed some garlic and ginger with the onions and added extra black and cayenne pepper.  I blended all of the ingredients using an immersion blender (which is the best investment if you like to make soups and smoothies).  Soup turned out wonderfully!

The taste is great!   I used yellow split peas for lack of yellow lentils, and that may be why I needed extra liquid in this!  I'll be making this again!

Use a full bag of lentils. Cooked them a long time with Vegetable broth stock and 3 1/4 Tsp of Tumeric.  Used three fresh chopped and seeded tomatoes and diced carrots. Followed the recommendations of 3 jalapenos (fresh) and 4 cloves of diced garlic. Microwaved two large sweet potatoes which I blended in by hand to the other ingredients. Also used 2 heaping tablespoons of Sambal Oelek (Huy-Fong foods), which brought a consistent low level of tasty spice. That has really become a favorite addition to most of the recipes I have tried lately.  I kept putting water in the mixture to give it a more soupy consistency, but after 6 cups of water and 2 cups of veggie stock, it remained very thick like mashed potatoes. Still very good. I will make this again.

This one's definitely a keeper!  I microwaved the sweet potato to save time and dishes and then just squeezed it out of its skin into the pot with the lentils before mashing.  At the end I used vegetable broth instead of water (but only a little so that the dhal was very thick).  I used LOTS of black pepper, and also some red pepper flakes.  The cilantro leaves contribute a nice flavor.

YUM! I have a big bowl of this right now and am really enjoying it. A few changes I made: 1) I used 2 sweet potatoes and microwaved them to save time and dishes. 2) I sauteed a ton of garlic in with the veggies - about 4 cloves worth! 3) I added a ton more pepper 4) I used a big bunch of fresh cilantro, chopped it up, and threw it in with the veggies 5) I omitted the tamarind (didn't have it!) 6) I only used 2 jalapenos 7) At the end I threw everything in the blender all together, so my soup is really creamy. 

This is so delicious, nutritious, and simple. Thanks so much for sharing!

I thought this was very good, especially with some fresh cilantro. Next time, I will add more turmeric and another jalapeno.

I make this all the time.  I use less water so it is like a mash not a soup, and I serve it with rice.  I often make double batches and freese it.

I doubled the recipe, added more turmeric, used fewer jalapeno peppers because I was afraid they'd add too much heat.  Turned out really bland. I tossed in a bunch of garlic in oil from a jar and quite a lot of cinnamon--better but still bland.  I felt I had to save this large amount of dhal so I dumped in maybe 1/4 cup of curry powder and it was edible but not really flavourful. We all ate it but won't make it again--looking for a more flavourful recipe or else maybe I'll use some adjustments from others' recipes.

I followed the directions but added some extras as I'm fond of Asian food and thought there would be a few ways to kick this one up a bit. added  about 1 tsp pre chopped garlic and the 1/4 tsp chopped ginger, 2 pinches of masala, to the soup while the onions and jalape√±os caramelized a bit.  I'm not a huge fan of cilantro so I added one or two bits chopped.   I noticed in the other picture the person didn't mash the sweet potatoes. This gives the soup a nice creamy texture and is very hearty. Overall I loved it and will repeat!

Delicious!! I had to make some changes since my market didn't have fresh jalapenos. Used a small can of nacho jalapenos and 3 habanero peppers. Also added extra tumeric and about 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper. Very filling and soo easy!

This a spicy,filling soup.I blended the soup after cooking and used quite a lot of pepper.I live in England and several of my asian friends make an almost identical soup as an old Indian family  recipe-very authentic.
Great if you are on Weight Watchers as both lentils and sweet potatoes are 'free foods' if you are on the Core plan.

The recipe was a little bland for my taste as it was.  

I added 1 tbsp of ginger paste along with a tsp of cayanne and a tsp of smoked paprika.  At the end, I added the juice of one small lemon. 

Like another viewer mention, it's even better the next day.

So it was my first time trying something like this and I ended up enjoying it. Basically it is a lentil stew that is really popular in India and Pakistan. This recipe mixes it with sweet potato, tomato, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, and seasonings.  I adjusted a few slight details from the recipe. I used green lentils because the local grocery store does not carry the yellow and red varieties. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to slightly increase warmness. The magical touch was adding ¬æ tsp of curry and finishing it with a small amount of cream. Adding the cilantro at the end made it really nice. It is very nutritious as well!

Loved this!  Made it on a cozy Sunday afternoon for lunch during a game. My market only had yellow split peas-I assume they are close.  They worked well for the recipe. I used a potato masher with the beans & the sweet potato.  Added 4 cups of vegetable broth and used a stick blender to mix.  I left some texture but it was mostly a smooth soup. Has a great kick! My husband always adds hot sauce to my soups, but this didn't need any.

Great, hearty, comfort food. I too cooked the potatoes in the microwave. I mashed the potatoes enough to allow a little chunk here and there and barely mashed the lentils into the potatoes to retain most of their shape: the textures were excellent. I also minced and sauteed three garlic cloves with the onion and added cinnamon, cumin and red & black pepper and salt to the spices, using fresh parsley for lack of cilantro. Served with warm basmati rice this made an excellent meal and even better warmed for lunch the next day. If one were to add much liquid at the end I would suggest increasing spices and salt.

We weren't too impressed with this the day I made it.  We tasted the heat from the jalapenos, but not much flavor.  It was much better the next day after it had time to sit.  I had it for lunch and it was delicious!

This was great - used red lentils and subbed sweet red pepper in lieu of the jalapenos.  SUPER filling, and cheap to make.  I added cumin and chili powder, and a lot of salt.  Delicious.

Fairly bland. I had to add a few spices to give it some flavour. Also a little gritty because of the lentils - kind of an unpleasant texture.

Amazing, once you season it to your liking. It takes a fair amount of salt; I couldn't really taste the turmeric when I made the recipe as-is. And two jalapenos was plenty for this Midwesterner-turned-Texan palate.  What really completed the dish for me was the addition of curry powder -- or, you can experiment with cumin, coriander, and more turmeric as you see fit.  It doesn't seem absolutely necessary to steam the sweet potato. Microwaving it would be a much quicker way to get it into a mashable state.  I will definitely be making this again.

Comfort food!!!  I did find that I needed 2 sweet potatoes, maybe even 3 the next time.  The onions did not soften as I would have like, but that's my error.  I added cumin, coriander, and red pepper at the end. I used black beluga lentils that looked wonderful with the orange potatoes...perfect for halloween!  I cooked the lentils separate from the potatoes, as in the recipe.  But I only mashed the potatoes...I did not mash both the potatoes and the lentils as I wanted to maintain the texture of the lentils.  The tomatoes seemed a little out of place. I'll try cooking them down further, but if that does not work, then I will omit them.  I did not feel the need to add extra liquid to make it stew like as I considered it comfort food as is.

This was absolutely lovely. I really mashed everything together,and it ended up more of a thick soup,but it was so,so good. It will be a favorite of ours,for a long time to come. Thank you. I was looking up yams to use,because I am on an Ayurvedic diet, and this is the best recipe yet!

Wow! This was an incredible recipe! I had to change a few things because I didn't have fresh jalape√±os or tomatoes (I used both from jar/can) and I added a few more spices (garlic, cinnamon, cloves, and hot sauce). It was phenomenal.

I was sadly dissapointed in this recipe.  Followed instructions and the end result was quite bland and that was including the three jalepenos.  I had it for left overs for lunch and it still lacked flavor.  Not sure if I'd bother with this recipe again.

I agree with the others who have posted.  It need some kick.  I saluted onion, ginger and garlic and added it to the stew along with more jalape√±o peppers.  My daughter and I had this with Basmati rice and it is a go to meal for us.  I bring leftovers for lunch.
