I make mayo in my processor all the time. Use the regular metal blades, pulse the egg, vinegar and seasonings until well mixed. Then slowly pour in the oil through the holes in the top with the processor running. Nothing will happen at first, then all of a sudden it will emulsify and get all creamy and thick. Voila, Mayonnaise! The first time I did it I didn't wait long enough for it to emulsify, I thought it was a failure, but after that I realized nothing was going to happen until most of the oil was added. I can't quite imagine using an immersion blender, you need one hand for the blender and the other to pour in the oil slowly, I'd want another hand to hold the jar just in case. Unfortunately, I only have two.

I made it,
Exactly as recipe asked. It never thickened and in refrigerator it keeps separating. Now, I've tried to make it into the 'easy Caesar dressing' and it tastes like oil, no matter what I waste adding to it in hopes of improvement. I'm definitely going to stick with actual cook books for while.

Unfortunately I have no blender so I have tried to use a food processor with little success.  However I like this anyway.  I added lemon pepper and dill  since I will use it on tuna.

This was my first time making mayonnaise! Everyone thought it was 5 stars. It had a different flavor and was really creamy. Simple to make! Made no changes!
