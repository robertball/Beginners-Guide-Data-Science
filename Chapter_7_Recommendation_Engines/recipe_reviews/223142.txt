I Loved this recipe. For those of you that said it was chunky? I Ground the oatmeal first, into fine powder. I have a Vitamix Pro 500, so this did it quite fast and easy. I keep a container of ground oatmeal to use in smoothie recipes.

Flavor was okay but quite chunky. I would have liked it to have more fruit. I might try this again and double the fruit, then see how I like it.

A super quick way to get your breakfast in! This is so nutritious and keeps you full. A well-balanced smoothie, with lots of protein from the Greek yogurt. This is definitely not a sweet smoothie. It's very tart from the yogurt, but it's SO good! It's not a thick smoothie either. I think next time I might add more frozen blueberries to make it a bit thicker, but either way, it's a keeper! I will also try this with rapsberries and strawberries too. YUM. Thanks for the great recipe! I will be making this often.

I thought this tasted okay. I like all of the healthy stuff in it the blueberries, oatmeal, and flax. I am not a big fan of yogurt in smoothies, but had some vanilla yogurt I wanted to use up and subbed it for the plain. I thought this was filling and was able to get 2 servings out of it. It's just a little on the thin side.

This is a really good berry smoothie. I used the almond/coconut milk and added a splash of vanilla extract and sprinkle of cinnamon which really brought the flavor out. I also used frozen triple berry blend. Very tasty and refreshing!

Yum!  I only gave it 4 stars because I think it's better with 2 small changes...  I added some raspberries and strawberries to the blueberries, and increased the amount of fruit to a little more than a cup.  I also added about a tablespoon of honey to counteract the tartness of the plain yogurt.  Blended it for a while to reduce the chunkiness.  Super yummy and filling!

This was a quick breakfast to whip up, and it did travel well.  I was a little disappointed with the taste.  I think that can be improved with less milk and yogurt and more blueberries.

I love this smoothie...been having 3-4 a week for the past 2 months...the only mod I made was substituting blueberry greek yogurt as I can never have enough blueberry...this smoothie is by far the most filling and when combined with a fiber bar, makes you feel like you've eaten a full meal, when really all you've filled yourself up with is vitamins, protein, and antioxidants...nicely done!!!

What I did was in the beginning, process the oats in a blender until they are fine granules. They add the rest.  Super filling.

This was disgusting. It was so chunky, and I couldn't get past that. I'm a fan of all the ingredients, but the flavor combination was questionable at best.

Itâ€™s grainy but still tastes good. I did use unsweetened vanilla soy milk and dairy free vanilla yogurt so those probably helped.

This is great.  The only way my husband will eat fruit is in a smoothie so I am always on the lookout for more options for him.  I only had a mixed berry blend to work with but, it still turned out great.  Blending the oatmeal and flax first is a must and for us a double helping of the fruit was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really like this morning smoothie. I blended my oatmeal in my Vitamix until it was a fine powder. Then I added the rest of the ingredients, using almond milk instead of regular.  Personally, I needed a little sweetener, so I added some stevia. Lots of good protein to hold me until lunchtime.

It needed some sweetening so I added some agave. It's a bit gritty, so I might try adding a banana next time.

I can't do hard seeds, so I used mango, blueberry,strawberry or vanilla yogurt without seeds, and quick oats, which I use in lots of things after blending.  Especially good in waffles. I think I'll add those oats to my vege smoothie I am supposed to drink...kale,spinach,cuke,mango juice and ginger.

The oats in this made it for me.  I have never thought of putting oats in a smoothie nor heard of it being done.  The suggestion of grinding the oats up first was a winner as well.  As far as the flavor is concerned, its up to your imagination at that point.  Yogurt, berries, bananas, milk, ground oats and away you go.  Great smoothie and loads of room for creativity.

This was delicious! I used just a normal serving size cup of blueberry yogurt since it all I had on hand, and I added some peanut butter to make up for the protein and consistency difference. My cheap blender ground the oatmeal just fine, it just needs to be left on for a while.
