This is sort of obvious to some of us, but some people may not know...heavy whipping cream is not interchangeable with Cool Whip.  Cool Whip is sweetened and non-dairy and heavy whipping cream is in a  carton sold next to the half and half and is unsweetened.  You would be better off substituting softened butter as that's what heavy whipping cream is after a heavy whipping, lol. Or possibly a creme fraiche or sour cream.  Not trying to be snotty, just trying to help.

This is a wonderful base recipe for many variations of chicken salad and pretty darn good on it's own too!  Definitely 5 stars as written and for it's potential!  HELPFUL HINTS:  Heavy whipping cream is NOT cool whip which changes the complexity of the salad.  ADDITIONS:  For a different salad built on the recipe base, try adding cranraisins, chives, pecans, candied cashews (found at Trader Joes) and/or cayenne pepper.  Also, curry is a nice spice to add to give the salad different character.  A crowd pleaser to be sure!

Let me start by saying that I am a chicken salad traditionalist (in other words, I typically do not like `foreign' ingredients in my basic salads, things like grapes, raisins, and so on).
So, I was very reluctant to try this recipe despite all the good reviews.  But, I took a chance and made it for a friend's baby shower.  Even while I was mixing it I was cringing and afraid...old opinions die hard...grapes and mayo...yuck!   

Anyway, I have no regrets.  Wonderful recipe that I got many compliments on.  The grapes were awesome with the other ingredients; they fit right in and were delicious.  It's a lot of work to make fresh chicken salad, but when I make it again, this is the recipe I'll use.  

So if you are a traditionalist, like me, go ahead and try something different.  I bet you will be pleasantly surprised and expand your food horizons!

One more thing, I used pecans instead of almonds...really I think any nut you have on hand would work as well.

Good flavor, but WAY too much mayo!  I used 4 chicken breasts, and I recommend cutting the mayo down to 1/2 to 3/4 cup, according to your tastes.  Also, if you want more "tang", use more grapes.  My husband, who is studying to be a chef, thought it was good, but that it had too much mayo, and it needed some cayenne  (about 1/4 tsp)for some kick.  I recommend mixing the chicken and stuff together,  THEN adding the mayo/whipped cream to your tastes.

My mother has been making this recipe for all her social functions for over 15 years!  It is the BEST chicken salad recipe EVER!  My friends always want the recipe when I serve this.  This recipe can be modifed to be very LOW FAT by substituting mayo with fat free plain yogurt and the real whipped cream with fat free canned whipped cream or cool whip.  Tastes the same (even better) in the low fat version.  Preparation time can also be cut down by using canned chunk chicken.  Also tastes great served on croissants.

This was GREAT!!!!  I roasted and cut up, and chilled (in ziplocs) my chicken on Friday, prepared my salad on Saturday, and served it on Sunday and it held up great!!!  I tripled it and added more grapes, 2 apples, walnuts in stead of almonds b/c I was having them in my salad, onion and salt to taste, and cayenne to taste...needed some kick and this did the trick. I used Miracle Whip and Cool Whip...no mayo. Sunday, I added a little more Mir. Whip and Cool Whip, to moisten.  I served it on croissants w/leaf lettuce, that I made up about 3 hours ahead, and covered tightly w/ Saran Wrap and put in frig. Croissants also held up well in frig.  Very easy -- and "make ahead" friendly.  Actually better if it sits overnight!!!!!  Will DEFINATELY make again!!!!!

WOW!  This is the best chicken salad I have ever made.  It was the Hit at my daughers daisy scout induction ceremony.  My platter of sandwichs was the only ones eaten up!  It is truely best to make the day before so the flavors blend well. I did some of the other suggestions from the other folks who tried the recipe.  Used walnuts instead, used some granny smith apple too, little pickle relish, cayenne, fresh ground pepper and sea salt to taste.  I cut back on the mayo and added chopped green onion.  My husband ate a sandwich for breakfast this morning, he said it was so good!  Thanks a Bunch Becky for giving us this "now a staple" for my family.

This chicken salad was incredible!  A great way to use up leftover chicken. The second time I made this I took chicken breasts and baked them in a can of chicken broth at 350 for one hour. Let the breasts cool then chopped them up. Like another reviewer I mixed the mayo and cream together separately before I added it to everything else.  I also added a chopped red delicious apple to the mix. I used red grapes instead of green. (About half red apple/half red grapes) This recipe is a keeper.

Very good recipe. I love GOOD chicken salad and this one is good. Next time I will change the almonds to pecans for a different flavor. I also used sweetned whipped cream that I had left from a pie. Thanks!!

The almonds make this superb- but definitely toast them first (at 375 degrees for 4-5 minutes, shaking frequently).  Also, don't add the salt right away.  I think it's better without any, especially if you use roasted chicken that has been seasoned with salt and herbs.  I served this salad on croissants at my daughter's baptism reception, where it was gobbled up!

Excellent dish!  I tasted somthing like this at a local high scale  restaurant and this was just as good.  I added chopped up apple to it (like in the restaurant)!  I think this gave it an extra good kick!  It complimented the chicken and grapes perfectly.  My husband ate all the left overs when I wasn't looking.  Will make this again soon!

The second time I made this, I used toasted pecans instead of slivered almonds. That is an incredible improvement on what I already thought was a perfect recipe!

Edited 2009:  So funny-- I was rereading my reviews from 6 yrs ago when I was a brand-new cook. I was DEFINITELY one of those irritating reviewers who made a zillion changes and then gave the recipe fewer stars.  My apologies! I have learned SO much about food since then. I now realize I should have used heavy whipping cream as written and avoided canned chunk chicken. I promise to give this another try w/ the correct recipe ;-)   I was really excited about this recipe, but ended up slightly disappointed. I used canned chunk chicken, and realized after the fact that I should have then omitted the salt.  It was definitely too salty.  I used light mayo and cool whip, which was a nice combo.  The salad was a little bland though.  However, I probably will add almonds and coolwhip to my future chicken salads!

Whipping cream and whipped topping are NOT the same thing! Miracle Whip is NOT mayo! Now that I've said and repeated these two crucial things, I must say this chicken salad is outrageously good. I do make a couple of changes: a little more cream and a lot less mayo (I'm a mayo hater...still, it does not ruin this salad for me at all!)  I add a chopped apple and just an extremely tiny sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Wonderful and I will be serving it at my daughter's baby shower!

This is a great recipe. The recipe I have differs slightly. I also add a can of drained mandarin oranges.I use less mayo and more whipping cream. For something different add small cooked pasta shells and you have a delicious pasta salad. Hint.. If you have no whipping cream just use cool whip - It is just as good I promise!

The whipped cream REALLY makes a difference.  It takes away some of the heavy mayo flavor and adds a light fluffy favor and texture to the chicken salad!

This recipe has a lot of potential! But when I made it exactly as the recipe directed, I found it on the edge of being inedible. I think making just two adjustments would go a long way:

1. Decrease the amount of mayo. 1 cup is way too much. I'd say start at 1/2 c, and add from there, maybe up to 3/4c. 
2. Eliminate the salt. Though it was just 1 teaspoon, it made the entire thing very salty. And you can't undo that. Perhaps just add salt to taste, or none at all (which is what I'm inclined to do.)

This is FABULOUS!!  I have attempted to make chicken salad before, but I've never been thrilled with the results.  Today changed all that!!  I did cut back to 3/4 cup of mayo, left out celery (we don't like it) and it was perfect!  I will make this one again and again =)

I made this recipe using baked chicken.  The only difference was I used 1/2C light mayo and 1/2C fat free sour cream to lighten the calories.  I also added 1/2tsp black pepper.  Mayo was very strong at first but settled the next day and tasted great!  The almonds didnt stay crunchy. May suggest saving those for right before serving.

This recipe is a great way to get rid of any left over baked chicken. I took the advice of other members and used half of the salt and only 3/4 cup of mayonnaise and it came out yummy.

A very tasty chicken salad! I really enjoyed this salad. I diced up some leftover rotisserie chicken. I chopped up celery and halved the sweet red seedless grapes and mixed it in with the chicken. I chilled the chicken until just ready to serve. It took almost 2 minutes to whip the heavy cream with a hand mixer. Once I had soft peaks I added the chicken, celery and grapes, then the slivered almonds to the whip cream. Instead of adding a full 1 cup of mayonnaise , I added a little at a time, mixing it into the chicken until I got a desired consistency I wanted. I added a little hawaiian sea salt and chopped fresh parsley. The chicken salad is absolutely wonderful! The whipped cream makes the salad taste lighter. I like the sweet juicy grapes with the crunch of the celery and slivered almonds. Its nice texture with light flavors made for a tasty chicken salad. I am glad I held back on the amount of mayonnaise. I think this recipe is good -but only with less mayonnaise. I served this along with, "Bacon Corn Chowder," also from this website!

I took this to a brunch and people thought that I had bought it.  The only changes I made was reduce the may to 1/2 cup and the celery to 1/2 cup celery and I added 1/2 cup apples.  I did add a little extra whipped cream and a sprinkle of sugar.  It was delicious! I was proud to tell the ladies that I made it! :)

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is much too salty as written.  1/2 the salt (or none at all) and it gets 5 stars.  I also used half and half to cut down on some of the fat.

I got lots of compliments on this recipe. I made it for a baby shower. I did add a few things. I added toasted walnuts instead of almonds because that's what I had on hand. I added some diced red onion, 2 gala apples chopped, zest of 1 lemon and juice of 1 lemon. I quadrupled the recipe for the baby shower. Such a huge hit! I'm thinking that I might add just a splash of white vinegar for some zip. With the leftovers, I boiled some penne noodles and mixed the chicken salad into it, DELISH!!! I will be using this recipe often. ;o)

I made this tonight for my husband, he loves chicken salad but doesn't like things that have too much mayo. I added a little extra chicken (about 3 cups) and it came out perfectly coated, not dry at all. He loved it and so did I, I served with croissants as sandwiches. I will absolutely make this again although with one or two changes. 
I thought it was too salty, I probably wont add any next time. I also added a little pepper which I thought helped add a dimension which I will do again. Don't skip on the parsley, I almost did and I'm so glad I didn't. I used Italian parsley and the flavor was a nice addition.
I can't imagine making this with cool whip, I don't think the sweet would be good addition to this, it reminds me of yams or fruit salad with marshmallows, yuck. Use the heavy whipped cream, it makes it so creamy and cuts out some of the mayo flavor.

I have heard many people say this recipe is bland.. I have been making this chicken salad recipe for more than 10 yrs. There is one ingredient that I believe has been left out of this recipe which makes it fantastic! It is Cavendar's Greek Seasoning. Think my recipe calls for 1 to 2 tbls but just use what you like.

I was hesitant to use heavy cream... but it turned out great! I like having less of a mayo flavor.

Man... I get the BEST recipes here!!!  This is another winner!!!  Used apples instead of grapes and did not add salt.  Also used seasoning salt on the chicken breasts before I baked them.  The cream adds that little bit of sweetness that sends this one off the charts!!!

really tasty, added a little less mayo than it calls for because I don't like mayo.  I also added some gala apples for more sweetness!

hands down the best chicken salad recipe I've ever made.  The whip cream (cool whip) is the secret ingredient, I think.  I've never made it with heavy whipping cream as I think the slight sweetness of the ready made stuff plays off the other ingredients.  A little cayenne for kick and you've got a real treat!!

This was wonderful! I'm gluten-free and this was a nice treat. What a great idea to use whipping cream. I made a few changes... I would just used a spoon full of mayo at a time until you like the flovor instead of the whole cup. It's so much better to not over do the mayo.

My boyfriend called me to tell me that this was the best sandwich he ever had, and he wanted to know if I could make him two instead of one for lunch tomorrow!  I made a few alterations to the already great recipe, incorporating some of the suggestions of other reviewers, and this was the final recipe: I started with boneless, skinless chicken, which I cubed and sauteed with white wine, a little butter, olive oil and lots of tarragon (salt to taste); I let the chicken cool, then added the following: I used much less mayo than called for, added minced pecans and walnuts instead of almonds; I also used red seedless grapes and minced red apple, and lots of fresh, chopped tarragon, a little dijon mustard, fresh fennel sliced thinly, a dash of cayenne pepper, and salt to taste.  I served it on soft, slightly sweet egg twist rolls, and it was delicious.  I did use lots of celery, but I sliced it very thinly, and I also used more grapes than called for.  Thanks for the great recipe, and thanks to all the other reviewers for great suggestions!  Tomorrow I'm going to try it on a croissant!

This was good. I was expecting something extraordinary after all the reviews, but I was just OK with the original recipe. The almonds aren't quite the right complement to this salad either. It has too much mayo and is a bit bland, and that is why I will only give it 3 stars. After following other reviewer's suggestions though, I was able to make a delicious salad adding apples as well as walnuts, cutting down the mayo, adding a little sweet relish and even a hint of nutmeg, then serving it on a croissant. I wish I could give this recipe a 4 or 5 star rating, but most of the recipe was altered based on other reviews.

first off..Cool whip is NOT whipping cream or heavy cream..2 different entities..Heavy cream or whipping cream comes in a cardboard carton like milk or Half and half.  I cannot even fathom adding cool whip to this recipe..eww..Sorry but..eww..

okay had to get that out of my system..eww..

anyhow..I love this recipe..not really too much mayo, one thing I cannot stand is a dry chicken salad..I like to add onion, or chives to this.  some paprika over the top looks pretty..Served in croissants, or with crackers.  Delightful!!

I love the mixture of mayo and heavy whipping cream. This does make it a little runny, but it tastes exactly like the chicken salad from my favorite restaurant. Sometimes I prepare my chicken salad with fruit and other times I like to use onions, celery, and boiled eggs. Either way the mayo and cream mixture makes it so much tastier.

This is close to the salad that was served at my bridal shower so many years ago. I loved it then and I love it now. It is easy to make and excellent with croissants although served on lettuce is just as good.

Perfect! My father-in-law loves this, says it is just like his mom made.  I add a bit of lemon juice and lately have been substituting sour cream for the whipping cream and I think it is just as good.  BTW: if you half it, it is perfect for one can of chicken.

I only gave it a 4 because, to me, it doesn't offer much flavor.  Of course it would make a difference if your chicken was marinated in something before used.  This is a good basic recipe though.  I made it 3 times and experimented with various ingredients.  Each time it turned out good.  I never put in the grapes, parsley or salt (I doubt it would have greatly affected the flavor-maybe the salt would help a little).  I toasted the almonds perfectly (375 for 4-5 min. turning constantly)  Probably cooking them in butter with a little salt would have really made them good or use cashews!  The first time I cut the mayo in half and it worked fine.  The second time I used low-fat plain yogurt (only 1/2 cup).  It tasted pretty much the same. I think the idea of using cool whip instead of whipping cream or adding a little sweetener would be nice too.  I heard low fat mayo breaks down so I never used it. I added a 1/8tsp of cayenne pepper and one time I added 1T of bottled ranch dressing.  I think the dressing was on the way to increasing the flavor.  I never used any onion even though i love them.  I don't think it would work.  And I do think if you like it with grapes, it would be just as good with apples and walnuts instead of grapes and almonds.  Sorry for all the info, but my sister-in-law sue likes alot of detail.

I thought this recipe was awesome, my honey thought it tasted "girly".  I got mini-croissants at Costco to serve the salad on, and the presentation was cute!  One mistake I made: didn't have sliced almonds, had whole ones, so I put them in a nut grinder and threw the nut bits into the salad.  Mistake, the whole almonds are unpleasantly crunchy in this dish, almost like chewing down on something the texture of bone.  Stick with sliced almonds, can see how this would be MUCH better.  I used red seedless grapes, thinking the color contrast would be better.  The flavor was great, but there ended up being no point since it's all covered with the mayo/cream binder anyway...color doesn't show through really.  So use green or red grapes, whatever you have or is available.

Good, basic chicken salad recipe  I followed loosely, adapting it to suit my tastes.  I left out both the grapes and the almonds, and didn't bother to whip the cream.  A dribble of fresh lemon juice and, for me, this was perfect.

Pretty good chicken salad - 1/2c mayo is definitely enough, next time I will only use 1/4c sliced almonds.. 1/2c overpowered the salad. I also added a few dashes of garlic powder to add some flavor, which definitely made it better!

This was my first attempt at a chicken salad and it came out great - thanks for the recipe!  I did make modifications for what I had on hand - instead of celery, I finely chopped a granny smith apple to color contrast with the red grapes, toasted the almonds - and used whipping cream, not cool whip ; ) .  Definitely make this up a day ahead because it is even more delicious the next day!

This is one of the best chicken salads I have ever had (and I have had several since I love it!).  I wanted a new chicken salad recipe to make for a baby shower this weekend, and I came across this recipe.  I made a trial batch today.  I made a few additions/changes based on suggestions from other reviewers.  I toasted the almonds in the oven for a couple of minutes.  Before I put the almonds in the oven, I lightly salted them.  They were delicious!  I waited until the very end to add the mayo and whipping cream, and as suggested, I added to taste.  I left out the salt, but added a little at the end.  I also added a few sprinkles of onion powder.  A couple of reviewers suggested adding 2 tbsps. of sweet relish, which makes it absolutely wonderful.  This is a delicious dish!

Great comments from a ladie's luncheon. Only suggestion - next time I will slice the grapes in more than 3 slices per grape - smaller pieces would be more desireable.

If I could give 6 stars to this recipe, I’d do it!  My hubby is a “Meat and potatoes” kind of guy, so I was apprehensive about trying this recipe.  I followed the recipe, using some of the suggestions from other raters as follows:  I used a full cup of Miracle Whip® and a little more than a ¼ cup of Cool Whip®, as suggested by others.  I don’t like almonds, so I used pecan pieces.  I, too, thought it could use a little “zip,” but I didn’t have any cayenne pepper (as suggested by another cook) so I used a half-teaspoon of hot curry powder.  I will definitely make this again, but I think I might add some grated onion to the mix.  I served it on Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls with leaf lettuce.  Excellent!

This was a hit with the crowd!  I wasn't too sure about it the night I made it, but after being refrigerated overnight, it was much tastier.  I used only half of the mayo and used walnuts instead which helped the taste too.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I LOVED it!  I made it 24 hours in advance, and it was just perfect!  Also, I used Miracle Whip, and cut it in half, and added 1 cup of Cool Whip instead of using whipping cream.  It still tasted great 3 days after I made it!  A Party Hit!!

I wanted a recipe with grapes.  This one is a keeper.  It was a hit at my Christmas party.  My daughter ate the leftovers for 4 days straight and did not want to share.  Anytime I want chicken salad from now on, this will be it.

Sorry to give this such a poor rating, but I made this and it was WAY too creamy for me. While I loved the grapes and almonds together, the taste was a bit bland so I added some paprika and cinnimon to kick it up a bit. I would try again but go lighter on both the mayo and the cream...

This is an excellent recipe, I've been making it for over 25 years.  If you want to do something kinda fun, put the chicken salad in a pre-baked pie shell, lined with some torn lettuce. Add a small amount of finely grated cheddar and sprinkle some paprika on top for color. Cut in wedges when serving.

This is one of the best chicken salads I've ever had!  I took it to Book Club and it got rave reviews, they ate every bit of it, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I made another batch for myself the very next day.  I did add some chopped dates I happened to have, and that was a nice extra flavor.  Very good, this will be a regular.

Thanks Becky!  This is a great recipe, similar to that I had at a friend's house, but better. I took others advice and used 1/2 cup of lowfat mayo and also used canned high quality chicken breast that contained salt so I left that out.  Added all the ingredients except the mayo and whip cream which I mixed together with a pinch of cayenne pepper and added it last. Yum Yum!

I'm not the most experienced cook, but I made this salad several months ago for a baby shower where most of the women in my family "had the market cornered" when it came to chicken salad.  They raved! I took a few recommendations from previous reviews; using white wine and taragon with the chicken, walnuts instead of almonds, red grapes, very thin slices of celery, a bit less mayo and just a pinch of salt.  You don't need as much salt when using the walnuts, they naturally add a lot of flavor. And don't skip the cream if you're worried about it being a bit runny.  It makes the salad, so just add more chicken. Even the leftovers were a hit. The other day I asked my husband "if you could pick anything you want for dinner next week, what would it be?" It was a rare moment and couldn't be wasted, so he really thought about it... and he'd love that chicken salad I found online!

This is the best chicken salad I've ever had! I make a big batch of this almost once a week, and my boyfriend and I chow down for days.  I've used sliced almonds and whole ones, and I like the whole almonds because it adds a pretty color to it and the crunch is bigger.  We eat this with warmed pita bread; it is awesome.

This was SO good, and a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party. There was not a bite left. I followed the advice of another reviewer and poached the chicken breasts in chicken stock to cook them. (Then you can make soup with the leftover stock.) I made it the night before, and it held up just fine--just needed a little stir before serving. I thought the amount of mayo was fine, but then I love mayo!

I made this for a baby shower and got many comments about it being the best chicken salad the guests had ever had. 

I used meat from two rotisserie chickens (about 3 pounds each) and shredded it in my kitchen aid with the paddle attachment. I ended up with 8 cups of shredded meat so I multiplied the recipe by 3. 
I left out the celery (I got lots of thank-you's for that. Many people told me that they hate the celery in chicken salad) but the almonds, which I toasted, provided the much needed "crunch".
I also added a couple handfuls of  craisins. 
I served them on croissants and rolls. There were no croissants left over but there were a quite a few rolls. I guess chicken salad just needs to be served on rolls. 
It was so successful and so easy that I'm making this again for another baby shower tomorrow. 
Thank you for this great recipe. It will be my only chicken salad recipe from now on!

The mayo/cream made a great dressing. It was creamy with a little sweetness without adding sugar. I didn't have grapes tonight so added 1/4 c of chopped sweet onion and 1/4 c. chopped green pepper and 1/2 c. of Craisins. I used chopped pecans instead of almonds as that is what I was hungry for.  I have made this several times before and always change the ingredients but use the mayo/cream dressing. Use your imagination. I served fresh fruit on the side and baguette bread.

This is my all time favorite chicken salad.  People request me to make it all the time. I love it with the fresh whipped cream, but you can substitute cool whip.  the salad will come out a little sweeter but it is lower in fat and quicker this way.

YUMMY!  Took the advice of other reviewers and subbed plain yougart for whipping cream, also reduced to 1/2 cup mayo.  Chopped smoked almonds--what I had on hand and served over spinach for dinner.  Can't wait to have chicken salad sandwiches tomorrow!!  Great recipe, great advice from reviewers too!  Thanks!

If you dice all of the ingredients up very finely (got the idea from Chick-fil-a), then it turns out smooth and fantastic.  And, the recipe is just great as it is, and feel comfortable substituting the grapes for apples. Worked fine.

i gave this 4 stars because ive made it twice the first time step by step to the recipe and it seemed to have too much mayo. i made it the second time reducing the mayo by 1/4 cup. i also put just a sprinkle of cayenne and it was amazing.

I have been a member here for a few years, and have only found a couple of recipes here that have inspired me to rate.  I am eating this with crackers for lunch right now...and I am inspired.  The only thing I changed was to use 1 c. miracle whip in place of the mayo and cream, which I didn't have on hand.  I LOVE this recipe! I might try red grapes and add in some apple next time too :)  Thank you Becky!

This is almost exactly like the chicken salad I make....I thought there was too much mayo in this recipe, so I will continue to use my old recipe which is 4 chicken breasts, boil them and cool, then dice into cubes.  Sprinkle cubed chicken with seasoned salt.   Take about 4 handfuls of red grapes, and slice grapes in half.  Take 1/2 cup slivered almonds, and toast them in melted butter over stove top. Mix grapes, almonds and chicken together. Lastly mix 1/2 cup whipping cream with 1/2 cup mayo.  combine everything together and it is perfect.  I dont use celery or parsly and I dont miss it at all.

This is a great recipe.  You can make it ahead of time, but I recommend leaving out the grapes and nuts until the last minute, otherwise the grapes get squishy and the nuts lose their crunch a bit.

This was very good and I got a lot of compliments however next time I will not use the whipping cream.  I do not see a need for it.  It made the salad runny and I was not able to taste the mayonnaise no matter how much I added.  I will definitely make again but w/o the whipping cream.

We made this recipe exactly per directions on low carb tortillas. It was fantastic. All I added to mine was a pickle and my husband added bell peppers. We are going to make this every beach trip!

I made this for a small get together today. Everyone liked it. I would use a little less whipping cream, it was a little thin because of the liquid. It was great though!

YUM!  I have been looking for an amazing chicken salad sandwich for YEARS and I have finally found it!!  I substituted fresh dill for parsley, because I love dill-otherwise I kept everything the same.  The secret is in the whipped cream!  EXCELLENT- and I don't give out 5 stars easily!

Great recipe.  I add about a third of a red onion diced and I also added about a tablespoon of sugar to the heavy whipping cream before shipping it.  I didn't have sliced almonds on had, but I did have some Salad Pizzazz (the one with the dried oranges, cranberries and honeyed almond slivers).  I put a little over 1/2 cup of the Salad Pizzazz in and WOW, I had some awesome Chicken Salad that everyone raved about.  Thanks Becky!

This is so good - but even better if you adjust your dressing to 2/3 cup of mayo , 1/4 cup heavy cream and 2 TBS of vinegar - gives it some zip balanced with the grapes.  It is *****!

I thought this was a great base recipe for chicken salad.  I made several adjustments.  I added more fresh parsley - about 1/2 cup, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and about 1 tablespoon of dill weed, and maybe a little bit more salt than the recipe called for.  I didn't have any problems of the chicken salad being 'runny' like other reviews that I've read. Next time, I'll probably add diced apples. I made this recipe twice now when I had my friends over, and they loved it!

I substituted whipped cream cheese for the whipping cream, green onions for the parsley and added about a 1/2 cup more chicken.  Tasted great!

Excellent, easy and delicious! I didn't use the whipped cream, but instead substituted with a little more mayo. The grapes add such a wonderful flavor and texture to the salad! I will be making this for a casual lunch when my sister comes in town this week!

Delicious - Delicious - Delicious!!!! I absoultely loved it. I will continue to make this and share it with friends. I decided to make it the night before for lunch the next day since other reviews recommended it. I added apples and relish and used half a cup of mayo the night before but when I went to serve it the next day it looked a little dry so I added the other half of mayo and it was perfect!!! However...by my mistake, I bought fresh cilantro instead of parsely so I used a hair of it since I had no parsely. It was still yum yum!!!

It really is as good as all these reviews say!  We absolutely loved it!  I used about 1/2 cup mixture of low fat mayo and light miracle whip and toasted the almonds and used red grapes.  Served in Pita bread w/ a fruit salad and was a perfect lunch!

OH MY GOODNESS!!  This is, without a doubt, the BEST Chicken Salad I've ever tasted.  To the basic recipe, I added a teaspoon of fresh chopped tarragon.  It was wonderful.  I served it for a luncheon to a group or elderly ladies at my house.  All of these ladies are fabulous cooks and I really wanted to imprress them.  I was extreemly pleased when they asked me for the recipe.  This one is a keeper!  Thank you very much.

If you follow the recipe exactly it is excellant. But for personal taste next time I will add a little less mayo to make it a little more solid in texture and more celery. It was the best chicken salad I ever made.

I rubbed the chicken with a little olive oil, basil, onion powder, salt and pepper, and grilled it on my George foreman grill. I also used light whipped cream in a can, half light miracle whip half light mayo, a pinch of sugar and a few squirts of dijon mustard. I served it on whole wheat bread with leaf lettuce. It was fantastic!

What a hit!!! I made this for a party I was having and everyone loved it.  I subsituted 6 big cans of chicken for the cooked chicken and doubled everything else, using a lttle less mayo than 2 cups.  My kids also loved it.

The salad was delicious and received rave reviews.  I thought 1 cup of mayo was too much for the recipe and used 
1/2 cup instead.  I will definitely recommend the dish to others!

This was good.  I would definitely make this one again!  I made half of this as written, but omitted the whipping cream and subbed a little milk to achieve the consistency I was after.  I added the salt to taste, probably not using the full amount.  And I added a couple of chopped green onions.  Next time I would cut back on the celery, probably by half and increase the grapes, again by half.  Good chicken salad and especially nice on a hot humid day.  UPDATE: 6/7/15 - I made 1/2 of this recipe again and decreased the celery to a generous 1/4 cup and increased the grapes to about 3/4 cup.  I just eyeballed the onions and again didn't use the heavy cream.  We really liked this served with a little extra bunch of grapes on the side.  Although please take note, half of this recipe only made two entrée size servings for us.  No way does the full recipe serve 10.

LOVE this! Here's the small changes I do:
1) I exclude the whipping cream. I would end up wasting the rest of the container if I bought it and it's just as good without it! 
2) I like the taste of walnuts better so I use them instead. 
3) I shred the chicken instead of cube it. Just preferences. :)
4) I season my chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it, so I don't add any additional salt to the mix.
I make this again and again as it's great to have on hand for quick lunches or snacks! Thank you for the recipe. :)

Excellent! I've been looking for a recipe like this for quite a while. I left out celery due to family preference and doiubled the grapes. Added a little dash of garlic powder. Served stuffed in croissants. Delish.

Admittedly, I didn't whip the cream to soft peaks, just whisked into mayo and combined with other. But I made this for 100, 25 pounds of chicken, and it was all gone at my wedding! People, including a local restaurant owner, have been begging me for the recipe! Ok, so here's what I did; boil skinless bone in breast meat with some salt, bay leaf and a pinch of powder chicken bouillon. Boiled the first batch of 12 pounds in that, didn't change just added water for second batch. Deboned and shredded, salted, added whole small red grapes, walnuts and mayo/cream mixture. It was GONE!

Very good as is, but I added dill and craisens.  I also shredded chicken instead of dicing.  Thanks for recipe.

Delicious! Toasted almonds add a great taste. Would have never thought to add whipped cream and it really adds richness.

this recipe is awesome! a way to tone down the fat is to use plain lowfat yogurt to sub for mayo (even half mayo and half yogurt is an improvement!) whipped cream was the best addition. my husband asks for this at least 2 times a month. definitely needs a kick so i add cayenne pepper and cracked pepper. that sends it from 4 star to 5 star.

Thank you for sharing this one - I have been making this chicken salad for 10 years.  I found it right after I got married and have been using it every since.  I would give more stars if I could.  I don't usually like chicken salad - too sweet.  But this is wonderful.  Every time I make it I have to pass on Becky's recipe.

This recipe is great. I made it once and thought it was fabulous so I suggested to have it for my brother's wedding reception. It went over so well I've had so many people ask me for the recipe and say that this is the best chicken salad recipe they've ever had!!! It was an absolute hit. Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe.

After reading other reviews and knowing every pallet in the house, I used 1/3 of the mayo and 1/2 of the whipped cream.  Of course with any salad recipe, we all add what will make our tongue dance!  Thanks for the recipe and the cayenne trick!

This is the BEST chicken salad ever!!  I used seedless red grapes and walnuts.  Immediately after I mixed all the ingredients together it was very salty (and I love salt).  I put it in the fridge to chill overnight until the party the next afternoon and it no longer tasted salty!!!  Everyone loved it.  I DO NOT suggest decreasing the salt!!!

I made some changes, used what others had suggested. I used toasted walnuts and added one green apple peeled and chopped. I used just under 1/2 cup spraycan wipped cream and a couple spoonfuls more than 1/2 cup mayo. I also added a touch or yellow mustard, I know it seems it would clash with the sweetness but it gave it the flavor it need it. Just a pinch. I used a bit more chicken then called for, some canned breast meat and some breast cooked with oil onion powder and paprika. With these minor adjustments it was DELISHIOUS. Good recipie to adjust to your taste. My boyfriend said it was "soooo bomb". Thats good. :-D

Wow, I never imagined using whipped cream would make chicken salad so creamy and delicious!  My husband loved it.  This was a great basic recipe.  I just used ingredients I had on hand and didn't really measure anything.  I was a little afraid I had too much whipped cream and mayonnaise for the amount of chicken I used, but once it was on a sandwich, it was perfect.  No additional mayo was needed for the bread and the chicken was moist and delicious.  I'll definitely use whipped cream in all my chicken salads in the future!

This is my all time favorite "girly" chicken salad.  The whipped cream makes it heavenly.  I usually use red seedless grapes, and only use breast meat.  I'd be disowned by my Southern family if I put dark meat in chicken salad.

The Male Point of View:  BRAVO BECKY!!!  This one is a winner!  So quick and easy, so tasty!!  Even my Mom, who hasn't liked anything for the past 2 years since her stroke, LOVED this!!
I followed some of the ideas left by others:  I used leftover Breaded Italian chicken cutlets, used half the mayo and added cool whip to taste.  I also toasted the almonds (I used slivered almonds) in a frying pan in a bit of butter flavored Pam.  Served cold on croissant or a light lunch with some melon cubes on the side.  This would be great for a brunch, served in cold melon halves.
Thanks for making mom happy Becky!!

Delicious!!  My hubby raved over this!  I used grilled chicken leftover from last night.  I also followed suggestions from other reviewers and added a dash of onion powder and cayenne, used about 3/4 c. (instead of 1 c.) and used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream.  We ate ours on Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers.  YUMMY!!!  My hubby mentioned that it would be great to serve to our friends as an appetizer too.

I tried this recipe because of all the rave reviews it got and boy was I disappointed. I should of known that it would not have any flavor when the only seasonings called for are parsley and salt. I had to add a ton of other seasonings to give it any flavor and even than it was still too bland for my taste. Am I the only one who prefers their chicken salad to be flavorful?

Made this for a baby shower and got rave reviews!!!  Light tasting...not so "mayonnaisey"!  I cut the mayo in half...I can't imagine why anyone would want more than that...it was plenty moist, creamy and delicious with half the mayo, and all the whipped cream.  Awesome recipe...we all loved it!

This is a nice, basic chicken salad.  I used a little more of the cream than called for and cut back on the mayo and I thought that gave it a lighter taste (I'm not a big fan of a heavy mayo taste).  I did add some red pepper flakes to give it a little zing. My mom kept eating it trying to figure out what gave it the little zing-and I never told her!

A big hit at my ladies group!!!,  It was quicker to make than I thought.... just threw some frozen chicken on the George Foreman and chopped the rest in the food processer and then added the chicken minutes later when it was done.  Fantastic!

This was SO good.  I omitted the salt, and added a little less mayo, as some other reviewers suggested.  One other thing that made it yummy: I cooked the chicken breasts in the crock pot with some water, then shredded them into small pieces and prepared according to the recipe.  Made the chicken very tender.  Also added a dash of cayenne, which added some zip!

This was fabulous. I added diced apples and toasted almonds for a bit of a crunch. There was too much salt in the recipe though, so next time I'll cut the amount in half. A keeper for sure!

Great recipe - however I modified things quite a bit, I merged it with the Holiday Chicken Salad recipe already posted and boy was it delicious!! I sub. the grapes with dried cranberries and the almonds for walnuts. I used 2/3 c. of mayo and added paprika (try to use Smoked Spanish kind), it gave it a pretty color and smoky flavor. I also minced two shallots into it. Oh and one more thing, 1 t. each of onion and garlic powder. Be sure to serve on crossiants. If you did not get all that e-mail me and I will send you copy. I would submit a whole other recipe but could not figure out how. Oh well.

This is a great base recipe for chicken salad.  To save time I bought a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store and it took me under 5 minutes to make this salad!  I would recommend using Miracle Whip instead of real mayonnaise as it adds some extra flavor.  I also added fresh dill to mine and it was fabulous!  This recipe is definitely a winner. :)

This recipe is fantastic!  I used it recently for a party with about 25 guests.  I grilled the chicken to add a nice flavor, then used lowfat plain yogurt and Cool Whip for the dressing.  It was so good and very low fat.  The guests loved it and raved!  We served it on mini croissants with a bit of leaf lettuce.  Make it--you won't be sorry!

Thought the whipping cream thing was odd but thought I would try it out since my family doesn't like things that are too mayonnaise-y. What a winner, it was nice and creamy and I used only half a cup mayo. This is going to be my new summer potluck dish.

Recently I had a Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich from Panera Bread and I was interested in recreating it. I know it has chicken, grapes, celery and almonds. This seemed like a good match. I did not use a cup of mayo or the heavy cream as my waste line was a little nervous about that. I used a 6 oz cup of plain Greek Yogurt and about a 1/2 cup of mayo. It could have been more... wet. But overall this is good. I ate it over a bowl of fresh spinach. I don't know that I would add as much salt next time though. Maybe 1/2 tsp.

Wow...the fact that people think whipping cream is the same as whipped cream/Cool Whip kills me. Even I know the difference and I'm not much of a cook.

I made this receipe the first time exactly.  While others really liked it, I found it a little bit heavy.  The next time I made it I followed some advice of other reviewers by adding more green grapes (double the receipe).  I added 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper and 1/4 c seasoned rice wine vinegar to the mayo/whipped heavy cream.  This dressing I tossed on slowly tasting until I was happy.  I ended up only using 1/2 of the dressing mixture.  I'll stick with this modification in the future with perhaps a wee bit more vinegar.

A good recipe but a little too salty. I will start with less mayo, I can always add more, and cut way back on the salt. I used green grapes but I think next time I may use red. One reviewer said they used Craisins. I may try that one time too!

I felt it was a bit salty for my taste. It wasn't too bad but honestly I've had much better. This is an easy recipe though and can be just a base if you add your own ingredients.

Great recipe, but of course I modified it for my own tastes!  LOL!  I used about 2/3 c mayo instead of the full cup, added red onion and swapped out the almonds for pine nuts.  This is my new fave!

I made this for a bridal shower - made the recipe as it was written. The whipping cream added a nice velvet texture to the salad, but some of my guests thought it was too "wet". I think it could have used more grapes or something else to impart more flavor. I like another member's suggestion regarding the addition of green apple and a bit of diced onion. Perhaps I will amend the recipe a bit to get it just right for my taste. Overall, it was good but did not knock my socks off.

VERY GOOD! I added pecans instead of almonds ( didn't have any) and some chopped onion, I replaced regular salt with crazy salt and it was WONDERFUL!! Thanks for a great chicken salad recipe!  To the people ho complained that it was too runny, you need to WHIP the WHIPPING cream, it will make all the difference.

This chicken salad is really good and easy. I used the bags of precooked and diced chicken that Tyson makes. I was talking and accidentally added an extra cup of mayo so I had to find other things to add to the salad (I didn't have anymore chicken at home). I added apples, red pepper, lots of extra grapes, and yellow pepper. Since the chicken pieces are larger, I think it really helped make the extra mayo not as noticable. I had a friend that will not eat chicken salad and he just looked at this salad and had to try a bite. He ended up eating my whole sandwich.

This chicken salad recipe is A-1, top o' the heap, chicken-licious! I took the advice of others and cut down on the mayo and cream. Also, the whipping cream is a must! I used some leftover grilled chicken and 1 5oz. can of chunked chicken. Otherwise, I prepared the recipe to the letter. The salad was quite quick and easy to prepare, also. Thanks, Becky!

I LOVE this recipe. I have received so many compliments as well as requests for the recipe. My husband, who is a total meat and potatoes guy, requests this often in the summer. Adding the heaving whipping cream really makes the recipe. I added a few drops of tabasco as well as a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. I have also been know to add diced apples and/or green peppers, depending what I have on hand. I usually double the recipe and then enjoy leftovers for a few days (if my husband doesn't eat it all!) Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I also used a ready-made Rotisserie Chicken. The only flavor they had was "jalepeno honey", and it was fine. I also had to substitute craisins for the grapes because the grapes were iffy at the store. I think the grapes would have been a little better. Still, it was the best chicken salad I have ever made. And I have tried a lot of recipes. Thanks so much! This one is a keeper.

I have made this recipe many, many times.   I use about 3/4c. mayo and 1/4 tsp. cayene (as suggested by another reviewer).   Often I don't bother with the whipped cream, just use the mayo.   We love it.

This is the recipe I've been looking for for 6 years. The only difference was the almonds.  The recipe calls for sliced almonds - use slivered almonds, toasted.  The almonds make all the difference, I'm sure it's good with other nuts, but almonds are my preference.

Wonderful! I tweeked it just a bit.  Of course our grocery store was out of grapes, so I used dried cranberries!  Loved it.  Also added some garlic powder and Mrs. Dash.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful simple recipe! I too altered it and added apple and used walnuts instead of almonds. I plan on using this for a wedding shower this spring. Thanks!

It's really good.  For those that get a runny result, you did not whip the cream enough.  I used red graped instead of white (they're sweeter).  May try using walnuts instead of almonds next time.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I used pecans for the nuts and I think I will add a few apples next time.  But overall, I thought it was a great starting point.
I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just left it out, but will try it next time.  For all of those people who said that the cream made it runny -- you do realize you have to beat it into a whipped cream first, right?  LOL

THIS recipe is da BOMB!  It's even better the next day! I was skeptical since I don't really care for chicken salad but when I took it to work to treat my co-workers, they raved about how delicious it was and I had to agree! I plan to make it again today for a picnic this weekend.  I used rotisserie chicken from Costco and adjusted ingredients as other viewers suggested (3/4 cup mayo and 1/2 cup cool whip, 2 Tbsp pickle relish, onion powder and cayenne pepper) Be sure to "re-season" after it sits a day or so in the fridge instead when you mix it up.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe Becky!

OH my!!! I made this for my girlfriends for lunch. I made two batches one with almonds & grapes and one without. Both were delicious. I served the salad on large croissants--just gave the recipe away minutes ago!! The cream really makes it!!! If you like a drier salad--cut back on mayo or cream just a tad. Will be making this often!!

I gladly give this recipe five stars even though I didn't have grapes on hand.  I substituted some on hand crushed pineapple, 16 ozs, and it turned out fabulous.  Made this for a party and loved it.  Note:  cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.

Since I've found this great recipe - I've made it every Sunday.. I make alot - using the regular recipe with 10 chicken breasts (not too saucy that way)- and it is gone by tuesday at the latest.  I've actually resorted to putting it in 2 containers and telling my husbnad which half is his (otherwise, I'd never get any!) 
Great recipe - Can't wait to have a lunch or shower now!! 
Thanks!

I automatically take the recipe for this chicken salad with me wherever I go, because I know everyone will want it!  It is delicious.  I cut the mayo in half and use Cool Whip - sounds weird but tastes divine!  Thank you Becky for such a great recipe!

Excellent chicken salad.  I forgot to whip the cream, which made it soupier, but it was still good.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!!! I agree, I wish I could give it 6 stars! I kept the celery and chicken chunky and the only other thing I changed was in addition to almonds, I added a splash of chopped pecans. This is a keeper and so delicious, its sinful! My boyfriend and his friends were gobbeling it up. yummy! Thanks, Becky!

Not bad, not great.  There is something very odd about the combination of flavors that only certain palettes would like.  Test this one on a small scale first.

I made this chicken salad the night before for a ladies luncheon (16 guests).  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  Here's what I did a little differently than the recipe called for:  1) I used Miracle Whip rather than Mayonnaise, 2) I added lemon juice for a zing, 3) I added some Spinach & Herb dry seasoning mix from Tastefully Simple.  It was excellent!

I added the mayo as the last ingredient following the other raters advise. I did not have any whipping cream and I did not add any salt. I did however add a little pepper and a dash of curry. It was very good.

I was clueless as to what to prepare for a potluck item at our office holiday party.  I came across this recipe at the fabulous AllRecipe web-site.  It was very easy to prepare and everyone loved it.  I had to post it on our company's intranet in order to fulfill all the requests for the recipe.  Thank you Becky, for a wonderful addition to my "fav" list!

Good stuff!  This was the first time I've made chicken salad and it was delicious.  I added cayenne pepper and held the mayo off until the end and added it until the consistency looked right.  Thanks, Becky!

Someone I shared this with at work STILL raves about it to our co-workers!  The prep took a bit of time but the results were yummy.  I never would have believed that plain whipped cream would have made such a difference in chicken salad.  This is perfect for me because I'm not a big mayo fan and the cream in this is much lighter than mayo.  Definitely try it!

Great salad, my husband scarfed it up in no time.
I didn't use grapes as I don't like them in sandwiches.  If you go that route, please be sure to decrease the mayonaise by approximately half,  depending on how creamy you like it. This will keep the salad from being too runny.  I will make this all the time.

Delicious!!  I made this chicken salad yesterday and both my husband and I really enjoyed this very different salad.  My husband was surprised when he saw me cutting up the grapes as neither of us ever had grapes in any salad but they were delicious and we especially liked the almonds (I too toasted them).  I did add lots of pepper (as it did need a little something) and I added lots of spices to the chicken before I baked it.  Will definitely make this recipe over and over again.  Thank you Becky!!

I made this recipie with yogurtinstead of mayo, and it was terrible.  I threw it away after one bite.  I will try it again using the right ingredients.  I've learnedmy lesson- thats the last time I try to substitue ingredients to reduce the fat.

DELICIOUS!! I substituted most of the mayo for plain Greek yogurt to make it a little healthier. I also added red onion and some chopped up honey crisp apple - SO good. To serve it, I put a big scoop on top of a toasted English muffin, put some cheddar cheese on top, toasted it in the oven just until the cheese melted, and added tomato and avocado. My boyfriend  couldn’t stop raving about it - I will definitely make this again.

Great Basic Chicken Salad Recipe. The only change I made was to use Sour Cream instead of Whipping Cream (too much fat and calories).  Used a dash of black pepper and it's a winner. Wrapped up in a wrap with some Cranberry Sauce...and My husband loved it!  Oh and guess what - we used some leftover Turkey from Thanksgiving...and it was wonderful too!

This recipe was huge hit with our guests at a special luncheon for our county school teachers!  It was very easy to adapt it to feed 200 using the edit option on the recipe! I did substitute half as much raisins for the grapes and 1/4 cup ranch dressing for the whipping cream.  we served it on Hawaiian sweet mini sub rolls.  My sister says its the best she's ever had!  Thanks for the great website and my new favorite recipe.

Oh so amazing. Thank you Becky from saving me from the deli to get store bought. Try topping the chicken salad with craisins, even those of you that say "I don't like cranberries" Do it anyway! You'll thank me for it. Me and my husband both hate cranberries but craisins on top of the chicken salad is amazing.

Nice chicken salad. I really loved the grapes in this. My grapes were a little on the sour side so next time I hope to use sweeter grapes.  The whipping cream is a nice addition to the salad. I find it hard to believe that people actually used sweet whipped cream from a can or cool whip. Can't imagine what that tasted like but to each his own I guess. The only thing I would do different next time is omit the almonds. Didn't like it in this salad.

This is a great base recipe!  To reduce the fat content, I subbed nonfat Greek yogurt for the heavy whipping cream, and used olive oil mayo (it tends to be less watery the next day than regular low fat mayo).  I also added about a tsp of Dijon mustard to give it a little tang.  Yummy!

This Chicken Salad is delicious! The addition of the whipping cream is fantastic! I, as others, did not add the salt and was cautious with the mayo. The only thing I did differently was, I toasted the almonds to bring out more flavor! Thanks Becky for an awesome recipe  :)

I have never really been a fan of chicken salad but crave it ever so often. Decided to give this a try ... boy am I glad I did! I live in the south & its in the 90's didn't want to heat the kitchen up. Followed the recipe & some of the reviews used 3/4 c. mayo. & used 1 sm. gala apple chopped...no nuts ...was having my daughter for lunch & she's not a fan of nuts in her food. Used white seedless grapes quarted..Served on little dinner rolls...like a chicken salad slider & made some potatoe salad to got with it....it was FABULOSE...Thank You for such a wonderful recipe!

The whipped cream makes this chicken salad amazingly light and moist.  I had to whip the entire half pint of cream (for technical reasons) and found that the extra unsweetened whipped cream makes a great topping for steamed vegetables!

I made this for a women only wine tasting/skin care party...served it on croissants.  It got rave reviews..however, I thought it could have used a little more flavor.  I will play around with my seasoning on the chicken next time.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Makes awesome pasta salad too- I followed the recipe (toasted the almonds) plus added about 1 1/2lbs of small pasta shells. SUPER yummy and was a huge hit at the potluck I brought it too. Will definitely make it again.

OMG...Absolutely addicting!  I used two cans of prepared chicken and 1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes because I had no fresh ones on hand.  I also used blue grapes instead of green since that is what I had on hand!  The secret to this recipe is the whipped cream.  To lighten the mayo, I used 1/2 regular and 1/2 low fat (made with olive oil).  Incredible dish!  Thanks!  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this as the recipe was.  It was nice, but a little bland.  One complaint:  The almonds make it "pokey".  I read that others have used walnuts instead and I will try that next time.  After trying, I added some onion powder, black pepper and a few hard boiled eggs to jazz it up and it was much better.   The chicken with the grapes was a nice flavor combo.  Unexpected.

I never heard of using whipping cream in chicken salad before, but it was good! It makes it creamy without being too mayonnaise-y. To be honest, with this recipe, I didn't measure anything because I was lazy - just added mayo until I thought it was creamy enough - so I can't comment on whether this recipe uses too much mayo or not.

Way too much mayo and I like mayo. I even added extra whipped heavy cream. Needs more grapes. I used granny smith apples in place of celery which was very nice. Added nice crunch. Used pecans but it wasn't necessary. My kids wouldn't eat this and they eat just about everything.

This is the perfect, simple chicken salad with a twist!  I added a few of my own ingredients (green onions- which I feel MADE this recipe much, much better), but stayed with the basic recipe. They only thing I omitted was fresh parsley, only because I didn't have any. I added dried parsley into the mayo mixture, with some cayenne pepper. I made only 1/2 recpie for the 'dressing' part and the salad was perfect! Not too wet, not too dry.  I poached chicken breasts in chicken stock, chopped onions & carrots, only because I needed to get rid of them. I'll be making this for a long time to come. Word to the wise: the recipe calls for HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM, not whipped cream or cool whip.  EDIT: I've made this a 2nd time, didn't have green onions and it made a huge difference; still good, but a bit bland. I definitely won't make this again without them.

This was excellent. I also added Craisens, which not only tasted good, but added a pop of color. As I was using this for a tea, I put the chicken salad into mini Fillo tarts. It was beautiful and tasted great. It was a favorite at the party.

This is a really good Chicken Salad Recipe, but like any recipe that includes chicken as one of the ingredients I think the flavor of the chicken makes a big difference. I like to cook my chicken breasts with a lot of seasonings or even use leftover roasted chicken. I also use Toasted Pecans. Wow, are those good. These are great served on some nice fresh croissants.

I love chicken salad.  And I love it with fruit.  I utilized the other reviews and mixed it all up except the heavy whipping cream and mayonaise.  Added the 1/4 cup cream and then put in enough mayonaise until the consistancy was what I like.  Oh, and I used chopped pecans as I like them better.  This is very good and the way I will continue to make chicken salad in the future.  Thank you Becky!

Yummy! I toasted the almonds (as suggested) and I really think this made a difference. They were really flavorful and extra crunchy. I ate mine with regular bread, but next time will try pita bread instead. It's so good and the bread covers up some of the flavor.  It did take me more than 20 minutes to prep everything. It takes time to wash everything and cut/dice into little pieces. It was good though, and I would make again.

This is the basic chicken salad recipe I've been searching for.  I used red and green grapes, walnuts instead of almonds, left out the celery (not a fan) and added green onion.  For the dressing, I used about half Miracle Whip and half sour cream, about half the salt, and added black pepper, a dash of cayenne, a dash of lemon juice and a pinch of sugar.  Delicious!  Thanks, Becky, for a great recipe to play with!

This is my "go to" recipe everytime my daughters-in-law visit. The men all turn up their noses, and then we end up fighting them off of it.   Wonderful simple recipe. Sometimes I have used sour cream in place of the whipping cream. Still delicious!

I made this for my husband and kids minus the nuts, (my son has a tree nut/peanut allergy)and subbed 1/2 craisins 1/2 chopped carrot to make up some texture. They ate.it.up. I'm thinking of ordering sunflower seeds from a safe non-nut contaminated source for the next time I make this so it'll be more authentic, but they loved it. It made a great quick dinner for them on a beautiful sunny day :).

This was great!  The only thing I did differently was to halve the mayo and this was still plenty.  I also omitted the almonds for the picky eaters :)

Absolutely divine!  I was looking for a recipe to knock off the Tom Thumb deli chicken salad which sells for $8/lb and this turned out even better.  I did leave out the celery because I'm not a big fan of it, other than that I made it as written.

I made this for a baby shower and got rave reviews. The grapes added just the right amount of crunch. I made this the night before, then right before the party, I served it inside of mini crossaints. Perfect!

Really tasty!  For a lighter version, use 1/2 c light mayo and 1/2 c light sour cream instead of 1 c mayo, and 1% works fine instead of whipping cream.

This is a wonderful chicken salad recipe!  There is a local restaurant that has the BEST chicken salad, and I have tried for years to copy it, and this is IT!  I just subbed the almonds for toasted pecans, and there you go!  Thanks a LOT for this recipe!!!

I keep forgetting to rate this!  A very good chicken salad!  I leave out the whipping cream (there is enough moisture from the mayo) and usually use pecans in place of almonds.  The fresh parslsey really adds to this, so do not leave it out!  This is excellent served on croissants!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit when I made it for a luncheon at work. Used a bit less mayo and added cayenne as suggested. I know I'm just saying what about twenty of you are thinking here: please, please, PLEASE use the whipping cream. Whip it in a spotlessly clean, chilled bowl with a hand mixer, but don't sweeten it. Cool whip is great for desserts, but this isn't dessert. Terrific recipe!!!

This recipe is wonderful exactly as written.  I added some leftover crushed pineapple I needed to use up and it added a refreshing kick. I also added a handful of chopped pecans along with the almonds...delicious. I would recommend making it the night before so the flavors have time to blend. This is my all-time favorite chicken salad recipe.

Becky - this was an AWESOME recipe and thank you for sharing.  I just got done tasting it for breakfast and it does taste even better in the morning!  I made it yesterday and I doubled the recipe and after reading the reviews, I decided to add 1 TBS of Cajon Seasoning (just to give it a kick) and I diced up  pineapple chunks and it was yummy.  This is a nice creamy recipe and I was hesitant about the adding the heavy whipping cream (I didn’t sweeten it - were you suppose to?) and I was interested to see how it held together over night - it was just a beautiful today as it was last night (just more flavor).  This one is a keeper - I too think it would have been super good if apples were involved.  Thanks again!

Let me start by saying 5 stars are only for food that is "Thank God for this!" food and is not to be given lightly.  That said, this is one of the best Chicken Salads I have tasted.  Crunchy, fruity, and refreshing.  Next time I will add a little for whipped cream as I like it a little creamier and the kids like a little less celery (I like it though).  Overall, this is a keeper.  Thanks Becky!

I make this using apples instead of celery and I use red grapes instead of green, I think they have a sweeter taste, however the last time I made it, I only has black grapes and it was just as good.  I skip the whipping cream altogether.  I think it is better without it.  This is without a doubt my favorite chicken salad!

WOW! While I didn't follow the recipe since we don't like grapes and nuts in our salad, we just LOVED the lightness the whipped cream added. We decided this was the best chicken salad ever. (I added onion powder, celery seed and chopped gerkins in addition to the cream and mayo.) Thank you for a great idea!

I made this exactly as written.  Tastes great.  Good consistency.  I will use red grapes next time to help with visual appeal.  Also I agree with earlier reviews re: walnuts.  I will use them next time.  The almonds provide a little texture but are otherwise "lost."  They may be better if toasted.

Very good and creamy, but I would like a little more flavor next time. I did use less salt, added pepper and more chicken. I will also try with Taragon, as someone suggested.

I made this for a baby shower, and it got rave reviews.  HOWEVER, watch the recommended amount of salt; I put in what the recipe called for, and the salad was almost inedible until I added more chicken and mayo to fix it!  The recipe is a great one, though; the whipping cream made it SO creamy! Also, I substituted craisins and walnuts for the grapes and almonds, and it turned out fabulous!

Very good!  Comes out a little salty sometimes, tho, so we don't put any added salt in it.

I used the Moist Garlic Chicken recipe (easy!) from this site, then threw it in the food processor instead of dicing. I loved the texture and lightness of this salad, but something was definitely missing flavor-wise. I really like the Holiday Chicken Salad from this site, I'll try to use some of the seasonings from that.

This is a good starter but I am from the South and a good chicken salad starts with sweet relish that you can get from any grocery store. 2 tbl spoons per can of chicken.Canned Chicken works good.Boil 2 eggs for about 10min. Make sure you put cold water in the pot and add the eggs instead of boiling and then add. After boiling drain water and crack eggs and peel.Put in a bowl and them mash them up. Add the canned chicken. Make sure you drain the canned chicken A few stalks of celery trimmed and cut length way then diced.Don't forget to add that relish.. Add some mayo until consitency.I also add a little dab of mustard to this. Mix all together before you put on bread.
On a bagel or toasted bread of your choice, Bread decked out with lettuce and a slice of tomatoe. Salt and pepper to taste with a splash of paparika. Try it with some potatoe soup. For potatoe soup take 1-2 ribs of celery left over from salad and saute in a little butter in sauce pan. After they are opeque add condensed potatoe soup, 1 can milk measured from soup, 2 tablespoon sour cream. You can also add chives. Bring to a boil stiring to mix in sour cream. Follow directions on can. Salt and pepper to taste. Add on's would be crumbled bacon already cooked or my favorite shredded cheddar cheese. Enjoy!!

This chicken salad is so good!  I had heavy cream left over after making frosting for a cake and had lots of chicken, so I made it over the weekend and I didn't last long.  Substituted low-fat miracle whip for the mayo, and cut down the celery to 3/4 cup and toasted the almond.  Used it on pita bread, crackers, and on lettuce, it was wonderful all ways.  Can't wait to make it for a large group!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Got rave reviews at a baby shower I hosted.  I served it on croissants, and used champagne grapes instead of sliced grapes to save time.  It was the "secret ingredient" everyone was wondering about.

I love love LOVE this recipe!!! It is so great for pitch-ins, picnics, baby showers, bridal showers. I get so many compliments when I make this and people have asked for the recipe. It's just a huge hit. My brother, who loves the chicken salad from a fast food chain said, "This beats their chicken salad hands down! " It truly is the best chicken salad you'll ever eat!!!

LOVE it!! I'm all about easy, and that's what this recipe is. Plus the taste is fabulous!! My 2 children ages 2 1/2 and 7 eat it all up. I tweak it a bit by adding 1/2 cup of Craisin's(sweet & colorful) and toast the almonds...YUM!!! I double dare you not to make it!!! :^)

This is probably the best chicken salad I've ever had!  I left out the almonds and almost left out the grapes (because I've never liked grapes in chicken salads), but I'm so glad I didn't!  I tasted the salad without them and it was bland.  The grapes were perfect!  The whipped topping added a lightness that is missing with mayo-only salads.  I really liked it.  Even my husband, who loathes, chicken salad ate a ton!  THANK YOU for a definite keeper!

I love chicken salad made with grapes and nuts (I usually use walnuts), but wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  The heavy cream seemed completely unneccesary.  Just not as flavorful as I had hoped.

This is by far a crowd pleaser, I made this for a race for the cure bunch.  I scaled the recipe up to feed forty.  Instead of using fresh chicken I used the can chunked chicken.  (Time friendly) I also add shredded carrots for color.  My mom want me to make more this weekend,  Thanks.

I love this recipe.  It keeps well in the refrigerator.  I cut back on the mayo and used enough cool whip to hold it together to cut back on calories. Still tasted great.

Nice recipe! i had to use pecans rather than the almonds (i was out), but the whipped heavy cream added a nice sweet touch. i was planning to have the leftovers for lunch, but Hubby had already eaten them! It's quick and easy (i save leftover cooked chicken in the freezer), and plates up nicely.

This is an awesome chicken salad recipe.  I used grilled chicken sprayed with butter flavored non-stick cooking spray...and used green seedless grapes.  It was not too dry and not too moist.  Perfect for sandwiches...and the almonds just added the "perfect" crunch!

I am not a chicken salad person; however, I had a party with mamy guests that were.  So I found this recipe and tried it for the get together.  I loved it and so did my guests.  I have used the recipe for 2 years now and pass it on to tons of people.  Thank you Becky for the great treat.  Jamie

I served this Chicken Salad at my daughter's fourth birthday party -- everyone absolutely raved about it!!!!  It was fantastic.  We have a large family and invited her entire preschool class so we ended up making enough for 60 people, and even that didn't really take all that long (considering the size of the group).  This is now a family favorite, and I have forwarded this recipe on to many of the people on our birthday guest list.  Best on pita bread, for sure, but good on anything!!!!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe. It is close to the one I always make except for the addition of whipped cream. I used plain whipped cream(no sweetening!!) It added a nice smooth texture.I also toastd the almonds.  Try adding 1/4 tsp. curry powder and 2 OR 3 chopped hard boiled eggs. FABULOUS!!!!

This was great!  I didn't have grapes on hand so I diced up a granny smith apple and it was excellent!

This is a great chicken salad.  I used toasted slivered almonds in place of the sliced almonds.  Toasting the almonds in a non-stick fry pan gave the nut a golden color, crunchy texture and delicious flavor.  Thank you Becky for a wonderful recipe!

I chose to use sour cream instead of whipping cream, and walnuts instead of almonds, because of personal taste preferences. Yum!

Light and fresh; this is terrific!  It doesn't have a heavy mayonnaise coating.  I used both dark and white meat.  The only changes I made were to use slivered almonds - toasted a bit to brighten the flavor, I added a bit of fresh-ground pepper, and I added a can of mandarin oranges (drained).  I will definitely make this again!

It was good.  Just a little too heavy on the mayo and whipping cream.  I would not use as much as it says.

This is a good recipe.  I cut the recipe down to 5 servings, so about half of the original.  To the halved recipe, I added about 3/4 c pomegranate to it as well and the flavors were very nice.  My husband liked it for lunch and said I should make it again sometime.  We will have the left overs from lunch for dinner tonight along with another dish.  And I used cool whip and canned chicken when I made it.

I absolutely love this chicken salad recipe.  It is perfect in a sandwhich as filling or by itself. I've made it at least 10 times since I found the recipe and I always make enough to have leftovers.

I made this recipe one night because I had most of everything on hand except the parsley.  It came out great!  I didn't notice the video until after I had made it. I didn't whip the whipping cream up like the video I just poured it in with all my ingredience and it came out great.  I also used red grapes instead of green.  Easy recipe I would recommend.

This is my favorite chicken salad. I do not use the cream and instead use 1/8-1/4 of a cup of plain yogurt. I've also subbed the almonds with pecans. Love this!

This was very salty!!!  I had to add some pepper to counter balance it.  I'm thinking if we eat it on croissant bread the sweetness of that will help.  I also added more grapes - just our own personal preference.  I think less mayo would be better - maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup instead of a whole cup.

I thought it needed more stuff inside, eggs would go well and more of the grapes and almonds.  I would also omit the salt and then this would be perfect.

Overall a really good recipe, just a bit too salty.  I would cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. I also used just 3/4 cup of mayo, and it was almost too much.  I will probably use 1/2 cup next time,  other than those minor adjustments it really was a nice recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great. I have made it for years. I often make it as written and add madarin oranges and tarragon. The fresh parsley and tarragon make all the difference. I also like pecans better than almonds in it.

I'm not into fancy-schmancy foods, and at first look, this recipe had all kinds of reasons not to like it.  I've always been happy with the basic chicken salad.  Well, this screwed that all up.  So many textures and layers.  Soooo good.  Do yourself a favor and get some croissants for a very elegant chicken salad.

I made this chicken salad for a baby shower I was hosting. It was easy to make and turned out wonderful. I prepared it the night before (I used light mayo) and let it chill overnight. I served it on croissants. I used red grapes.

This is awesome!  I used a bit more whipped cream, used Miracle Whip instead of mayo, added about 1/2 of an apple chopped up and added pecans rather than almonds.  It was excellent and I will definitely make again.  Thanks Becky!

Very adaptable recipe due to taste preferences and ingredients you have on hand.  I always use this as my base recipe because I happen to LOVE the addition of the heavy whipped cream. While I've used canned chicken in a pinch (don't add salt), this recipe is far superior with chicken breasts or even thighs IMO. My favorite version is seasoned chicken thighs shredded in the crockpot and cooled, 1/2 c real mayo, a 1/2 c heavy whipped cream, 1/4 c super finely diced onion (I omit celery), a few shakes of garlic/onion powders, and diced apples. If I sub grapes, I use quartered red grapes. I also toss in some candied walnuts or pecans right before serving to preserve  their crunch. I make this ahead of time and refrigerate so the flavors have time to meld. Served on bakery croissants with some butter lettuce, a side of sweet potato rounds, and a few slices of melon is my ultimate favorite!

This is delicious!  I used diced apple instead of grapes (all I had)... And it turned out great.  I used more cream to get an even creamier and fluffier salad.  My husband approved, so I will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty, fast and easy.  I use light mayo to reduce the amount of fat because the whipped cream alone has a lot of it.  That is the key ingredient.  I may try it with fat free mayo soon.  I'm often pressed for time so instead of cooking chicken I use a 12 oz can of chicken and reduce the remaining ingredients by half.

Great recipe,Becky. I usually stick with a recipe precisely when trying it the first time just to be fair. I was out of grapes and almonds, but I did want a little something to make it sweet. I put a little sweet pickle relish in. I loved thinning the mayo with the heavy cream. My husband is still raving. It was delicious. I will try it with the grapes and almonds next time. I have successfully put chopped pecans in chicken salad before, and that works well also...especially if they are slightly toasted. This was great!Thanks!

Delicious! I used this for a Pampered Chef party, my consultant was more than willing to try it. Everyone LOVED it! I did use pecans instead of almonds because I don't like almonds. The only other thing we did differently was we didn't add the parsley so that people could try different PC seasonings with it instead. I, personally, would use the PC Dill Mix with it instead of parsley. We served in on wraps with lettuce and tomato.

This is a great recipe. I used pecans instead of the almonds. My husband loved this. Thanks for this recipe.

I served this at a luncheon and it was met with delight.  I used chicken that I grilled with a marinate of cranberry sauce and chili sauce (use equal parts of each).  Other than that I followed the recipe. Also, I didn't make sandwiches, I served it on shredded Romaine lettuce  with Black Bean and Corn Salad II.  I received so many compliments for the luncheon!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used this as a template rather than a strict recipe.  Had leftover grilled honey dijon chicken breasts (recipe from this site) which I highly recommend for this salad.  Added celery, sliced grapes, diced apple, toasted pecans,chopped parsley, salt, and bit of cayenne.  For the dressing, used light mayo (about 1/2 cup) and light sour cream (about 1/4 c).  Served on a bed of lettuce. Truly fabulous (didn't feel right giving it a 5* because I made so many changes, but my version definitely achieved this rating).

Great summer salad! You can add different fruit in as well, depending on what you have a taste for. I love the fact that if I forget to thaw something for dinner, I can always throw this together after work because we normally have all of the ingredients on hand.

I'm not a chicken salad fan but when I made this for my wife she raved about it for the next 2 days. It is now a "must make" whenever she craves chicken salad. THANK YOU BECKY!!

Hands down the best salad recipe I've ever made.  I made this for a luncheon and it received rave reviews and not one finger sandwich was left.  I was so glad I had leftovers at home for myself.  Yum!

Fabulous & easy!
I reduce in half for a quick lunch. My two year-old ate it up. I threw everything in the food processor, substitued sour cream for cream, lettuce for parsley, and a couple of quick pulse in the food processor a delicious and easy sandwhich toping is done. Thanks sooo much. Definate keeper.

I made this about 1 year ago and haven't made any other chicken salad recipe since...it is delicious! The grapes give it a nice summery taste..I usually use one of the roaster chickens from the store so it saves some time,.,it's very addicting! Thanks!!!

Becky, where ever you are, you deserve a hug...and a cookie! This is THE best chicken salad ever!! If you're thinking about making this, and the mixture of ingredients is scaring you, don't worry! It will turn out awesome...the only thing I changed was to cut down on the mayo a little, and also, I didn't have sliced almonds, so I used almond pieces...TERRIFIC!

Very good. I used red grapes, omitted the celery, used about half the mayo, used walnuts instead of almonds, and seasoned salt instead of salt. I served this on croissants, which was a great compliment. I will make this again, but must experiment a bit. I loved the cream - made it very light. Overall, pretty good recipe.

I thought that this was a good basic recipe to start from. I doubled all of the ingredients except for the mayo and whipping cream. I used only one cup of mayo and no cream. I added curry powder to make it a curry chicken salad. I served this at a luncheon and got rave reviews.

I love this recipe but make a few changes to it. Substitute the whipped cream with cucumber ranch dressing, also add grapes. Lots and lots of grapes. Believe me, it looks weird at first but every1 will love it.

Great Recipe! The only changed I made was using 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of miracle whip. It gives it less of a total mayo taste. The whole family loved it! Thanks!

We had a few chicken breasts left over from dinner that had been baked in the oven. I decided to try this recipe and am so glad that I did!  It was fantastic prepared just as stated in the recipe.  We served it on fresh baked whole wheat bread with chips.  It was a great summer meal.

FANTASTIC!  I used a rotisserie chicken.  I followed the advice of others and  only added half the salt and it was too salty.  So, to fix the salt problem, I just added a bit of sugar and it turned out great.  I love the almonds and grapes in this recipe.  I will keep this recipe close by for entertaining!

This was a really good recipe with a mild flavor.  I didn't measure everything in it, but just did it to taste.  I used canned chicken so I left out the salt.  I served this at my 4 year old's birthday party and everyone loved it.  I had to leave out the nuts because some of the guests were allergic, but I'm sure the extra crunch would have been great.  I will use this again.

Great recipe! I made it for my own birthday lunch that I had my family over for. Used canned chicken but didn't add the extra salt. Also used pecans instead of almonds. Everyone loved it. Very good on a buttery croissant. Yum!

This recipe was really good, I should have read the recipe and actually whipped the heavy cream, just added the liquid, not sure how it effected recipe. I should have listened to previous reviews and not added the salt. I used canned chicken and it was way too salty!!! and I love salt. I added some more grapes to try to even out the saltiness.

I love this recipe.  It's even BETTER when you use pine nuts instead of almonds.  Just toast up 1/2 cup of pine nuts...delicous!

Oh my word this chicken salad is SO amazing!  My Aunt made this for a baby shower only her recipe didn't call for parsley so I made it without that and also a half cup of whip cream instead of the heavy cream.  (That couldn't have made much difference in the flavor though.)  Anyway, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!!!

There are so many great chicken salad recipes on this site, its sometimes hard to chose! I love the sweetness that the grapes add to this. I don't ever add celery, personal perference. Thanks, Becky, this makes a terrific sandwich! The wh.cream in this also gives a unique blend to the ingredients.

This is a nice change from the ordinary chicken salad.  I boiled two chicken breasts with Adobo (R) seasoining and celery seed.  I took the advice of many other viewers and added about 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper (I think crushed red pepper might be nice too) and added 1/4 c. minced red onion, though I think it didn't really need it, but I like onion.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I subsituted 1 tsp. dried and also substituted 1/2 of a chopped gala apple for the grapes.  Too late in the preparation, I realized I didn't have almonds and substituted toasted sesame seeds(I know it's not even close but it did add a nice flavor.  I also, like others, reduced the mahyo to about 2/3 of a cup and it was perfect, along with the whipped cream.  Can't wait to try it with almonds.  Thanks Becky!

My favorite chicken salad on this site is Holiday Chicken Salad but I've been wanting to try this for a long time.  I left out the nuts and the whipping cream since many said it left the salad runny.  Also only used 3/4 cup of mayo and that was plenty.  Used l/2 the amt. of salt and that was also plenty.  My partner actually asked me to try this recipe but agrees that for us Holiday Chicken Salad is the one!

This was fantastic! My husband, who has never liked chicken salad, LOVED this! I used red grapes and skipped the whipped cream altogether. The almonds add a great flavor.  I'll definitely make this again, especially with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Thanks!

This chicken salad turned out SO GOOD. I used pecans instead, and I added a lot of extra spices such as cayenne pepper, onion salt, and paprika. I also added a bit of mustard to give it some more flavor. But I loved how the whipping cream made it so smooth. I didn't put in a full cup of mayonnaise; only half a cup; but I think that was plenty. I also cut out the fruit, and added more chicken than the recipe called for. I was really delighted with the result, and I will definitely make this again!

I would have given this 4 stars if I was only rating for myself, but since my husband didn't like this, I gave it only 3.  

The taste was good, though nothing new or exceptional.  I served it on toasted whole grain bread, which I thought made it better.

I made this for a baby shower I hosted, and it got rave reviews from all in attendance.  I left out the celery, used pecans, and only 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  It was yummy, and as an added plus - since my husband doesn't like fruit in his chicken salad, I had the leftovers all to myself.  Yum!!

I started using this recipe in 2002 and have made it dozens of times since. When my fiance's friends visit town, they always beg me to make up a batch. I don't use the celery (can't stand the stuff) and instead add about two cups of dried cranberries.  I love that it uses whipping cream rather than just mayonnaise - we don't feel so guilty eating it!  Also it's a good idea to season the chicken breast before you bake it.  I use kosher salt, pepper and dried dill.  Great recipe!

This is great!  I added salted cashews and not the salt and red grapes for color.  I really think the kind of mayo you use is important.  I used Kraft and would like to know what others have used and what you think. Will make again and again!

I used red grapes with great success. I used chopped pecans instead of almonds, but decrease the quantity to 1/4 cup. I found there was a little too much celery, but this is a matter of taste I guess. I am still unsure if whipping the cream is necessary or not, I may try to take a shortcut next time and not whip the cream.

YUM! This was really good! I made a batch of this to take on a camping trip, and it barely lasted 2 days. The only change I would make it to reduce the amount of celery. It was a little much for my taste.

Excellent recipe! I made this spread for sandwiches. My advice would be to double the recipe to get 10 servings. I served it on whole wheat sandwich buns and it was a hit. I also added extra grapes and almonds. Very yummy!

WOW! I was expecting good, but not this good! I ate this for lunch and dinner every day since I made it until it was gone! I added some choped up granny smith apple and substituted walnuts for the almonds. Also I didn't use near the amount of mayo called for, probably half. But it is so so so good! Especially good in a flour tortilla!

It's ok.  I liked the grapes and almonds, but other than that it didn't have much flavor and it seemed there was too much celery.

I'm not a big fan of chicken sald, but I made this for a family party and it was a HUGE hit!  I omitted the whipped cream (mostly because I forgot it) and used 1 T dried parsley, miracle whip instead of mayo, and I chopped the almonds.  It was so good that I was glad that I had leftovers.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.
I served this on croissants for dinner and it was perfect.  Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch.
I actually forgot to add the salt but that didn't appear to be a problem.  Will make this again for lunch or dinner.

This is so good.  I omitted the celery and added extra chicken. Still a lot of mayo.  I will probably decrease the mayo next time.  I love this recipe!

The first time I made this was for a bridal shower.  We served in pitas (along with "Good for you Greek Salad" and it was a HUGE hit!  I had five people ask me for the recipe there and I received a phone call from a friend that night saying she was craving it!

Two things I did differently: I used canned chicken. I don't normally use this but I was cooking for a large group so in the effort of saving time and money I did and it worked out great.  

I also added a generous amount of dried tarragon--my favorite herb for chicken sald.

I made two little changes, first I added about 3 tbsp. of finely chopped onion and secondly, I toasted the almond slices.  That being said, this chicken salad was great.  Hubby said I should keep this recipe and toss all my other chicken sald recipes out.  Believe me, this one is a keeper!

I found this recipe while searching for a chicken salad similar to Butterfinger's Deli in Highland, Indiana.  IT IS DELICIOUS!!  Every time I make it I get rave reviews.  I have substituted red grapes for the green ones on occasion.

Not much flavor. I think trying Miracle Whip Salad Dressing instead of plain mayo would help. Or perhaps add dill or a dash of vinegar/sugar mixture. Also, chopped green onion would be a great addition.

Mmmm this is good.  I did make some changes to suit my taste though.  I used red grapes because I had them on hand.  Also, I used less mayo, only 3/4 cup and it was plenty.  I boiled my chicken, so it didn't need the extra moisture, however if you used broiled or baked chicken, you may need to full amount of mayo.  I didn't find this salad sweet at all.  The heavy cream really makes it taste richer than regular chicken salad.  Although I haven't done it, substituting Cool Whip seems like a bad idea.

Thanks for a great chicken salad recipe!  I used light mayo and did whip the cream to stiff peaks to make it a little thicker.  Everyone loved it.  Great on croissants!

This is the best chicken salad!  I thought my recipe was good, but the whipping cream in this recipe makes the difference.  I always add just a little curry powder to my chicken salad dressing, and I did this time too.  Great!

Love it!
Easy to adjust with a variety of ingredients, but tasty!

Might be a little sweet for some, so perhaps substituting more light mayo for some of the whipped topping.

Fantastic!  Tried the original, which was very good, but tried some other ingredients the second time 'round that sounded good.  I used plain yogurt instead of the whipping cream, and subbed Miracle Whip Light for the mayo.  I also used 2/3c of diced apple and 1 stem of green onion.  Makes a good size batch so you can put it in the fridge for later :-)

This recipe was pretty good- it tasted good but it had a little too much sauce for my liking. I added more celery, fresh peas from the garden and water chesnuts to add some flavor and make it so I didn't feel like every bite was a mouthful of Mayo. Hubby liked it- which means a lot! I plated it up on homemade crescent rolls.

This is a good basic chicken salad, but I don't think the whipped cream was necessary. It didn't add anything special to the salad, and mayo alone would be just fine.

This was great.  Good flavor.  I combined the mayo, whipped cream, and salt, then only used about half the amount called for, it was too much when I made it with all that it called for.

It was okay but WAY too much mayo.  I have been looking for a recipe similar to this, but this ain't it!  Definatly cut back on the mayo and this will be better.

My kids request this all the time.  Over the years, I have added half of a diced green apple and a little bit of diced onion and served this on large deli croissants.  Definitely cut back on the mayo, but this is excellent otherwise.

I accidently bought heavy cream instead of whipped cream so I didn't add the cream, but it still turned out delicious!!  Definitly double the recipe because the serving sizes are not acurate.

This is a great chicken salad.  I left out the grapes and almonds because I didn't have them on hand and it still tasted wonderful.  I eat it on toasted bread.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

When I cooked the chicken I saved the broth for later use. Also santeed the Almonds and sprinkled them on top just before serving. Made enough for 15 people who were working to build a Habitat for Humanity house here in Fort Myers, FL. THEY LOVED IT. I loved the fact I could do all the work ahead of time and serve really, really cold. Served with an Iced Lemon Soup and got rave reviews. Thanks. Misty Lenz

This was a delicious chicken salad which was gobbled up at a recent potluck. I received many compliments. I think the whipping cream gave it a great texture. I roasted my chicken for 45 minutes to give the salad an even better flavor.

the best chicken salad I've ever tasted. I didn't use quite as much mayo as the recipe called for. I loved the crunch from the almonds and the flavor of the grapes. Will definitely make this again and again!!

I served this at a Mother/Daughter Luncheon at out church and it was absolutely fantastic! It was a very dressy luncheon with a Victorian theme.  As a keepsake I gave everybody a small booklet with the recipes that were used at the luncheon.  The first thing they looked for was the recipe for the chicken salad.  Thanks for a simple but super recipe!!!

I made this recipe for a volleyball team luncheon and the girls just loved it. It was so easy to make. The only thing that took any time was cooking the chicken! It was such a hit it will become a regular at the team's luncheons. KA

Made this last weekend but used granny smith apples (instead of grapes) and added some chopped pecans.  It was great!  My picky 13 year old daughter loved it!  A keeper!

This is very good.  Several changes might be to toast the almonds and cut the salt if you salted the chicken during cooking.

I made a few changes but overall it is a great recipe. I used apples instead of grapes, I used canned chicken to make it easier, and I didn't put any parsley. Except for the nuts, it was great for my 16 month old!

I did cut back on mayo and added more cream. A little cayenne pepper would be a nice addition. Very good!

This is a great recipe! I read the reviews before I made it and I got some really good advice. The recurring suggestion to reduce the mayo was spot on. I also increased the whipped cream. I only had walnuts on hand so I toasted them and added them (as suggested). I added some other ingredients too, 1/2 of a granny smith apple (another suggestion), I couple of garlic spiced pickle chips, a little green onion and a spinkle of paprika.

Oh. My. Gosh!  This salad was amazing!  Every single person who ate it LOVED it.  One guy told me it was the most delicious thing he had ever eaten.  I asked him if he was being serious and he assured me he was.  This salad had everyone convinced I am an excellent cook.  I took this on a 9 day whitewater rafting  trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho.  We have our own raft and float with a large group of friends. This trip had 8 boats with 12 people.  I made the salad with frozen, cooked chicken.  This managed to keep the salad cool  in our cooler for the entire trip!  Normally, I would have added the celery, but my husband cannot currently eat it, so I left it out.  I also sprinkled some garlic powder in for a nice contrast.  Other than that, I made the salad precisely per the recipe.  Fantastic!

I followed the recipe pretty well except I subbed some sour cream for part of the mayo.  It was delicious, the chicken was perfectly cooked.  I also threw in some diced jicama seasoned with lime and chili powder because I needed to use it up.  Great recipe!

I used a rotisserie chicken to save time. If I use this type of chicken again I will eliminate the salt or use about 1/4 the amount.

I made this and it is very bland. I left out the cream as it breaks down quickly in the chicken salad if you do not use it immediately.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of Karo Corn Syrup.  As the Karo chills it thickens the mayo and the chicken sticks to it better and will not break down. Also I substituted chopped pecans for added flavor with additional spices - onion powder, pepper, and instead of salt. a dash of Lowery's Season Salt.  So much better.

This is a very popular chicken salad in my family. I use cold rotisserie chicken, which gives this salad quite a big flavor kick. We serve this with soft potato rolls for the bread, and plenty of crunchy chips.

Delicious! I did make a substitute but  only because I didn’t have whipping cream. Added about  1/4 cup chicken broth that was leftover in fridge to the mayo. Tasted the salad and felt  it needed an ooomph ,so I did what another reviewer suggested, cayenne pepper, about 1/4 teaspoon. Loved the sweetness and hotness. Will definitely make again!

NO changes at all, we loved how creme made the salad seem richer than it truly was and the chicken flavor really came thru, perfectly spiced.  Lettuce was all it needed.

Discovered this recipe here some time ago and have been making it ever since. A great way to use leftover cooked chicken. I did make a few changes (so beat me up already). Did not want to whip cream for so small amount (I cook for 2) so just used a squirt of Reddi Wip...it's sweetened but better than Cool Whip. This element is important to take the edge off mayo. I used low fat mayo because that's what I had. When I feel svelte, I substitute pecans for the almonds and eat it with a croissant. When I feel porky, its delicious with the almonds and wrapped in a lettuce leaf. Yum!!!

I just didn't add the almonds, only because I didn't have any.  The absolute best chicken salad I've ever had!  I used Tyson Pulled Chicken in the freezer aisle and Duke Mayo.  Yum!

I did make this chicken Salad and it turned out great. I did a few substitutes though, i used cilantro instead of parsley, I added chopped walnuts, some dried cranberries and mixed green grapes with some red grapes and finally a little bit of celery seeds. I liked it !

I love this recipe. I love that it has whipping cream. I used toasted pecans instead of almonds but everything else was exactly as written. Great tasting recipe!! Will make again.

Chicken salad is one of my favorite dishes to serve when entertaining, and it is ALWAYS a hit. After reading the reviews before preparing this recipe, I was quite motivated. I made a couple of inconsequential changes: a cup less mayo, added green onions, and (MAJOR, maybe) I grilled the chicken breasts. Frankly, I don't know what I've doing all these years, but THIS is the chicken salad-must have! Thank you, Becky. Can I give it 10 stars, please?

So good! It's similar to my regular chicken salad, but with the whipping cream it goes to a new level. I did NOT add the salt, however, because I used leftover baked chicken which was already well seasoned. Thinking about the amount of salt called for, it does seem that a teaspoon would have made this dish quite salty as noted by other reviewers. I also used sugared pecans that were in my freezer from Christmas because I had no almonds. They really complimented the dish. It's a shame that I have none left for the next time I make this. It's not Christmas time, but perhaps I need to make more of those anyway just for this salad. I'll certainly be making it again.

I used a rotisserie for this recipe.  I like honey mustard so I added a 1/4 of a cup of sweet baby ray’s honey mustard dipping sauce.  Also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.
This was great.  I served it over a bed of lettuce.  In the future I will also use in pita pockets and coissants.

I basically followed the directions other than using other's recommendations to add the mayo and salt in smaller quantities so could adjust to our taste, adding a bit of chopped green onion and cayenne, and using roasted pecans rather than almonds because that's what I had. We enjoyed it very much even though we ended up not eating it until the next day. I wish I would have waited and added the nuts right before we ate it -- but just because we ate it the next day and the nuts were not as crunchy as they would have been.

Love the whipping cream. Adds such a nice light lift to this salad. I did add some diced apple which adds just a touch more sweetness. Great recipe.

This is excellent just the way it is. I've made this several times and will often substitute pecans for the almonds and I prefer more grapes than it calls for. Tastes great whether strictly by the recipe or if you experiment.

I have to agree with a few others who said it was too salty, and had too much mayo.  But in all fairness, I used rotisserie chicken for this, which is already salty, so I never should have added the salt.  It was almost inedible.  Even putting  the saltiness aside, it just lacked something.   Maybe instead of adding salt, next time I will add  sugar, or at least not use rotisserie chicken, since that has salt in it already.

I made this over the weekend and it was so good. I doubled the recipe and followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers ( added a chopped Granny Smith Apple, some white onion, chopped up a few sweet gherkins, used pecans instead of sliced almonds, added cayenne pepper). I boiled and seasoned chicken breasts  for this dish  and made it 24 hours in advance so the flavors would combine. Served this  with the options of mini croissants, sliced bread or crackers. It was some work, but well worth it! t was a hit! This is now my go to recipe for chicken salad. Thank you, Becky!

I added some cayenne pepper, cut the mayonaise back to about 1/2 cup and used about a fourth cup of cool whip.  I used  both red and green apples and grapes and substituted walnuts for the almonds.  Everything else was pretty much the same as the recipe.  I like "guestimating" amounts until I come up with what looks and tastes good.  Will probably add a but more grapes next time, a little more cayenne and a tad more whipped cream.  It was very good, but I think I can make it even more popular with my family next time!

One of the best chicken salads I have ever eaten. My husband loved it so much, he overstuffed himself. I didn't have any heavy whipping cream but it still turned out perfect. I have even learned to roast my own slivered almonds which really make this chicken salad the best ever.

This was very yummy! I made some substitutions because of what I had on hand. I used grilled chicken and chopped roasted almonds. I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo. This turned out delicious! Next time I will try adding a little bit of onion.

Delicious, but too much mayo for our taste, especially with the whipping cream.  I'll definitely make again, but use maybe 3/4 cup mayo.  We prefer pecans in place of the almonds, and I just keep adding grapes (red and white if I have both) until it looks right.  I'll probably use 1/2 tsp seasoned salt in place of the tsp of salt next time, too.

I attended a bridal luncheon over 20 years ago and this recipe was the star of the shower!  I have made it using leftover turkey breast and it is just as good as chicken.  A tip for making the night before, hold the whipped cream and almonds and add those two ingredients just before serving.  I have also topped the salad with toasted sliced almonds...yummy!  Easy to make and you will get lots of requests for the recipe.

This is the perfect recipe.  The flavors meld well and you get the sweet, salty, crunch with this.  We served on croissants and this has become a staple at our house for light lunches and dinners.

I had no celery, so I used a tsp of celery seed for flavor. I also added about 1/2c dried cranberries and about 2 tbsp fresh tarragon. It was GREAT and even better the next day!

Added 1 T of chopped poblano pepper and 1 T of fresh tarragon. I did not have any heavy cream and tried about 1 cup of Cool Whip instead. Oh yes, and I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. All in all, very tasty.

This was really good, and the heavy whipping cream really added an extra fluffy taste. I felt like it did need some more seasonings (personal preference) and will probably add some things next time I try this out.  I used chunks of chicken breast that I boiled. Very easy to make though!

Been wanting to make this for a long time.  Had some leftover chicken tikka masala from last nights takeout, so finally got the chance and it was Amazing!  Chopped up the chicken, used Vegenaise, walnuts, purple grapes, parsley, whatever kind of apple I had in the fridge and sprinkled in some diced onion. Added two chopped lettuce leaves. Didn't need to measure anything. Served in between two slices of wheat bread with roasted garlic flavored kettle chips on the side.  Thank goodness it made enough for tomorrow's lunch it was absolutely delicious!  Didn't use celery or whipped cream.

I had it at a church fundraiser and loved it.  I made one change ~ Cabot whipped cream in the aerosol can.  It was as quick sub. for the "whipped cream."   I never eat Cool Whip, so would not substitute with anything other than Cabot.

This was the perfect chicken salad recipe I was looking for.  I don't keep  cream on hand so I used a bit of sour cream thinned with a small amount of milk and a pinch of sugar to reduce the sour cream tang.  (In the end the sour cream tasted similar to regular cream.)  The 2nd day I still had some chicken salad leftover so I added canned pineapple tidbits to it and that was also very good!

I made this yesterday when I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover chicken. I had two things differently. My husband will not eat uncooked celery so I used celery flakes instead. I only had 1 1/2 cups chicken so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I was unsure how it would turn out using the heavy whipping cream but it's wonderful! I read a couple of other reviews where they chose to substitute cool whip. I would suggest not doing that as using real cream helps it bind together better. Eve R

LOVE this recipe! Scoop it onto a sesame seed bun and it's delicious! It's important to note that whipping cream is NOT the same thing as whip cream or cool whip... Use heavy whipping cream from a carton, it'll be by the milk and half-and-half in the grocery store. My family prefers more of a "plain Jane" chicken salad so I left out the parsley and almonds and simply served grapes on the side instead of incorporating them into the salad. I LOVE salty food and usually add more than a recipe calls for, but I think without the sweetness of the grapes the recipe calls for way too much salt, so if you skip the grapes like I do, use half a teaspoon of salt instead. I also added a teaspoon of paprika and chopped green onion to sprinkle on top.

I followed the directions as is, and loved it.  I used Perdue Short cuts instead of the cooked chicken and salt (in the recipe).  Other than that, I think the flavors were really saturated into everything the next day, but still oh so good the day that I made it.

I was lazy and actually didn't even whip the heavy cream up and it still came out delicious.

Fabulous recipe. I used 4 fairly decent sized chicken breasts so most likely had more than 2.5 cups chicken breast. Since I don't like my chicken salad very creamy, this was prefect for me. I did everything else exactly as the recipe stated.

This recipe is good, but it made a few changes which made it great. I used roasted turkey breast instead of chicken & added lots of dill. The dill is what pushed this recipe from good to great. 
The cream makes this very rich so I can't eat too much at one time or I get a tummy ache. I like this better with salad greens as a salad than on bread as a sandwich.

I had a 1/4 less mayo than the recipe called for and I think it was perfect this way. I also used left over boiled chicken from making chicken noodle soup stock earlier this week, and I had the perfect amount of chicken left from that recipe for this one.

I love this recipe! I have been making it every couple of months for a little over a year.  I do make one slight adjustment and replace half the mayo with plain greek yogurt to add a boost of protein and a little less fat.  It came out delicious, perhaps a tiny bit less sweet though. Definitely recommend this.

I thought this was very yummy! Instead of heavy whipping cream I used Greek yogurt and I wasn't disappointed. I think it is a healthier option. I also used a rotisserie chicken, so for the person that was complaining about tasteless chicken they should try that. My husband also thought apples might be a welcome addition. Didn't try it this time, but I will next time!

This chicken salad is really good.  It's the kind of food where after you eat it, you feel really really good.  Instead of the celery I used 1 chopped onion and 1 pear.  I also put in some cayenne pepper.  It gave it a hot/sweet taste.  If you put it on a croissant it's heavenly!

The grapes and almonds were a great addition to this chicken salad. They added sweetness and a nice crunch! I had trouble with whipping the heavy cream because I made such a small batch that my kitchen aid wasn't able to whip the heavy cream properly. But I would make this again!

I really liked this but hubby didn't which is why I gave it the 3 rating.  I don't care for sweets so I was surprised at the reverse rating.  But I liked it!

Finally - I can make one of my favorite foods! This is a great traditional chicken salad recipe. I served it for a family brunch and everyone had seconds. I plan to make it for a baby shower in a few weeks. A few small tips if you are going to make this: add salt to taste, add mayo to taste, and DEFINITELY let it sit overnight before serving to allow the flavors to mingle. Thanks, Becky!

This is fabulous! My family devours this. Use the cream - it works very well here. I've been making this recipe for so long, I sometimes use different fruit, but I've also left out the fruit and used diced red bell pepper and scallions and celery. My kids prefer this with the apples/grapes combination and my husband prefers the veggie combination. Very, very good!

The key to this salad is the fresh whipped cream.  It allows you to use lots less mayo and keep a creamy texture.  Seems like a nice base recipe as far as the "additions," but as you can see from the reviews the possibilites are endless.  Our additions were walnuts, apples, onion, and date pieces.  Overall a great recipe, but the fresh cream is what really really makes this good.  Thanks Becky for giving us the secret ingredient to a good chicken salad!

This was an absolutely delicious twist on the usual! As other reviewer's suggested i toasted the almonds and also was very very careful with the salt (its easy to over-do it,especially if you're using seasoned or roasted chicken). I also added some chopped apple. This chicken salad is amazing on thick multi-grain bread.

I LOVE this recipe.  It has been a hit at all of the functions I have brought it to.  I use red grapes instead (for color) and I use pecans.  Also, I only add 2/3 of the amount of mayo called for.  It's way too much otherwise.  DEFINITELY use fresh parsley!  It makes a huge difference.

This is very good.  I just made this for the second time.  I like the crunchy celery with the grapes.  I used walnuts the first time (out of almonds) and it was still good.  This is a good salad to have for a few days of lunches at work.

Excellent chicken salad! I had been meaning to try this for a long time and won't hesitate again! The whipping cream cuts the mayonaise and gives it a lighter creamy flavor. I used pecans instead of almonds. I would add more seasoning next time and maybe some onion..but great the way it is!

This was a lovely little recipe. I made it tonight, but first pan fried three skinless, boneless breasts with butter, garlic powder, onion powder, and some Zatarains seasoning. (PS- I'm from Louisiana) Once cooled and chopped up, I added it to the ingredients listed (sans the grapes and almonds since I like neither). Had I put more forethought into it, I would have also left out the salt suggested as the seasoned chicken was salted enough. I will definitely make this again. The whipped cream was an excellent move for chicken salad.

This is the best recipe. I used red grapes and left out the celery. This was very moist. I'm in the South and used Dukes mayo. I made this for our ladies luncheon at church. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. Thanks!

I was concerned that the grapes and whipped cream would be an odd contrast with the mayo and chicken.  And I have never enjoyed celery. However, this recipie was wonderful. I added extra salt and pepper and served it on fresh crissonts with a piece of lettuce. Do not try to whip the cream by hand.

The missing ingredient is onion, not cayenne.
If you think this needs a little something extra, try a little onion powder or chopped onion (depending on preference) 
This is my version:
Double the grapes, red, quartered.
1 rotisserie chicken, torn (about 3 cups..if you snack a little :)
1/2 tsp onion powder
3/4 c light mayo, no whipping cream (i like it light)
toast your almonds, i prefer slivered to sliced
everything else the same
Serve on a fresh croissant with red lettuce and a side of canteloupe.  My favorite lunch EVER!
Or for a different trick, my grandma's way is to serve inside 1 canteloupe half and eat like a salad.

I'm giving this a 4 because it actually had a good flavor but the almonds really turned it off for me. I used less than the recipe called for and it was still all I could taste and I love almonds. Next time I'll make it without.

I used a third of the dressing, and instead of the heavy whipping cream and mayo, I used miracle whip.  This is a meaty, crunchy treat! I also prefer walnuts rather than almonds. I will be making this again when I cook a whole chicken!

It was a good basic recipe but seems like it is missing "something" to make it taste just right. I will probably try it again and experiment a little.

This is by far the BEST chicken salad recipe I have ever had!  Don't change anything about it, it is perfect just the way the recipe reads.

Yummy! As a personal preference, I don't use the celery. I also use light mayo to cut down the fat. You might want to start by only adding 1/2 c of mayo and adding additional to taste because the 1 c is quite a bit.

I made this for a baby shower using fresh roasted chicken from Costco. Served it in a mini crossiant with green leaf lettuce and it was a hit! Everyone was asking for the recipe. But I must admit that the mayo was a little too much. Maybe cut it down a bit.

This was a great recipe--I like light mayo, both in terms of amount and reduced cal/fat, so I followed suit of others and reduced the amount to my liking.  I used green grapes and it was quite a crowd pleaser.  I wondered if perhaps a dash of nutmeg might be tasty too--not with cayenne, which I opted not to use for this batch.

This makes a really good chicken salad. I did use 3/4 cup mayo instead of a full cup though. Overall, a keeper!

I liked it.  I am thinking I wasn't too happy with my chicken, wish I would have just used precooked cubes- I had used some leftover chicken (white and dark) from another recipe.  I needed maybe an apple.  It wasnt as sweet as I was thinking it would be.  I did use 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 mayo.  Thanks!

amazing chicken salad!!! Also great as a base for Curry Chicken Salad. Just add a T of curry, t of cumin, pineapple tidbits, white raisens, etc. I cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot with some broth. Shredded some of the meat for the salad and used the rest for chicken soup.

So easy, and tasty!!  I cut back the salt to 1/3 t. and cut back the mayo to your liking.  I've tried it with almonds and walnuts, and while they are both good, I prefer the walnuts.  great addition to my recipe box.  THANKS!

This is what happens when you change the recipe too much. We added onions and tomatoes. For some reason it was really soupy. It never really seemed to thicken. Less salt could be used also.

This recipe is exquisite! It tastes as great as it looks and is better than chicken salad I have had at high end restaurants! I doubled the recipe and used four 10oz cans of chunk chicken to save time. Doubling the batch yielded 10 cups of salad. I added 1/4 cup of craisens and about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for zing. I used miracle whip with the whipping cream and may have whipped the cream too long b/c my batch definitely does not have too much mayo. In fact, it may need more by tomorrow, it may get a little dry after it sits! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This was good, and even better the next day.  It was almost a little too salty for me, though...  I'd suggest holding off on the salt until you've tasted it..  Otherwise, this was good and I WILL make this again!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty, but did have to make some minor changes and that's why it only gets 4 ****.  First, only use recommended amount of salt if you have boiled chicken.  If you have chicken that's been flavored in any way, or canned chicken, make the recipe first and add salt last.  Otherwise, this will be a very salty recipe.  I also added dried cranberries to enhance the flavor with a mild tartness.  I did get requests for this recipe, so it is very enjoyable.

This is awesome!  I made this for myself and a friend for lunch the other day and the only thing I didn't add was the grapes.  I whipped up a little whipping cream since I had some on hand and put the salad on croissants and added some sliced red onion and avacado.  Wow, we both couldn't believe how delicious this salad was. will make this for lunch for friends as much as I can! Thanks.

I made this for a recent birthday party and put it on croissants and it was delicious.  It was easy to make the day before and was even good the day after the party.  My friends commented they liked the added crunch of the almonds.  I will make again!

The whipped cream really does do something special. I split the batch in half and did with and without nuts for the allergy people. It is a recipe in the rotation now.

Three teenagers voted this as so-so, but my husband liked it. I think it was good, but needed more kick. Next time I will add dill relish, more salt and pepper, and perhaps some minced onion. Thanks for sharing.

This has become a family favorite in my house! This is a great summer dish that takes very little time to prepare. And for a bigger crunch, we sometimes substitute chopped walnuts for the almonds. Excellent recipe!

To bring down fat content, I substituted half light mayo and half light sour cream and left out the whipping cream.  A tablespoon of marsala adds a nice touch with some bit of sweetness.  Also add half a finely diced apple sometimes and half the celery for crunch (I'm not much of a fan of celery either!).  Thanks for the post!

Took this to a party and everyone loved it.  I used pecans instead of almonds (personal preference), and rotissere chicken.  I didn't really measure anything except the cream.  I just kept adding stuff to the cream until it tasted good to me.  I probably used a little less celery and mayo, and a little more pecans.  I also added tarragon cause I love it in chicken salad.  Definitely a great basic recipe to modify (or not) as you see fit.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband really didn't like this recipe at all...I like it well enough...and my mother in law thought it was great. It definitely missed some zest in there somewhere. I added a 1/4 of sour cream to try to liven it up a bit, which did help, but very little. I recommend maybe 1/2 c of sour cream or maybe some mustard because this definitely needs a zip. Otherwise, good base, just needs some work.

The best chicken salad I have tasted.  Definitely do not skip the whipped cream.  I have made this recipe at least 10 times and it always turns out great.  The only change I would make is to go easy on the salt.  I don't think it needs a whole tsp.

I have never made chicken salad before. This was fabulous.  I added red grapes, a bit of dijon mustard, 3-4 Tbsp. green pepper (didnt have celery), a dash of onion salt. Bought a chicken already cooked, and added 1/4 cup Miracle whip.  Hubby sat there eating it as he was adding ingredients. You have a fan with this recipe.

This recipe was easy to make, my eight year old loved helping make this. The only thing I thought is it had a little too much mayonnaise for my taste. I didn't have any almonds so I used finely chopped walnuts instead and they worked great. I put this in a pita with some leafy green lettuce and it was very tasty. We will be making this again for sure!

I had been looking for a good chicken salad recipie and this is it.  My mom and sis think it's divine and I couldn't agree more.  I made a few changes by taking someone's advice about using whipped cream cheese, added red onions and red seedless grapes for color and tossed in some tarragon and parsley.  Oh yeah and I used a rotiserrie chicken from the store.  Next time I make it, I'll toss in some toasted pine nuts and soy nuts but this recipie is a definite keeper!!  Thanks Becky!!

I made this for a trip to the beach for Memorial Day weekend and it was a HUGE hit!  I smoked a whole chicken and pulled it apart for the salad, added walnuts in place of almonds and used red grapes instead of the green.  It yielded enough for 20 people and made for a great quick and easy snack throughout the weekend.

I have made a recipe very similar to this one.  I use red seedless and walnuts though.  No Whipping cream...just the mayo.  I always get compliments from guests and make enough to take to work for lunch!  Very good in salad or on a grain bread.

I can't believe this could taste this good. I've made it for several showers served on a croissant.  Instead of mixing in nuts, I sprinkled cashews over the top.  Big Hit!!!

It was a bit soupy for my tastes, but I'll just cut down on the mayo the next time.  Very easy to prepare and kept all week in the fridge, making it the perfect on-the-go lunch.

Best chicken salad I have ever had!  I serve it on crescent rolls and never have any leftovers.  I cook for our women's retreat every year and since serving this recipe 2 years ago I must now make it each time. The first year was for 30 and this year, 2005, I will convert it to feed 45, conversion to large groups goes over very well.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. Be careful with the almonds- don't burn them! I used Cool Whip and added more grapes. Very good!

I doubled everything except the mayo/cream mix.  Maybe it's the cool whip substitution that makes it runny.  Husband loved it.  I used pecans - trying almonds next time with a few extra thrown in for crunch.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes to make it a bit lower in fat.  I used fat free Cool Whip instead of heavy whipping cream and Miracle Whip Light instead of mayo (goes better with the whip cream).  I also seasoned, grilled and cooled my chicken before adding to the salad.  This is definitely a hit with the whole family - I always make extra for leftovers.  Thanks, Becky!!

This is absolutely a wonderful spin on chicken salad.  I added a little more mayo and whipped cream (and a little sweet salas cubes) and it was a hit with everyone at work!

Wow!  This is just so good!  I didn't put as much salt because I used a rotisserie chicken...which did great.  I also toasted the almonds.  You might even be able to cut the mayo just slightly.  Overall, just great!

I loved this recipe and now make it all the time!  I did use cool whip instead of cream as others had suggested and that eliminated the runniness. I liked the sweetness it added. I also cut back on the mayo quite a bit.

This was far too saucy and rich, and quite bland also.  It was too runny to use on sandwiches.  As others have written, cutting back on the mayo and omitting the cream might help, along with adding some other herbs.

I picked out this recipe for my husband who is on a low-carb diet and he loved everything about it.  I thought the taste of the mayo was a bit on the heavy side, so I plan to substitute some of it with more cream next time.  I loved making the recipe...it's so colorful, easy, and rewarding. The ingredients complement each other so nicely!

Good chicken salad recipe - I used 3/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup cool whip for the dressing since I like it a little sweeter.  I also added a handful of cherry flavored Craisins - they added wonderful sweetness.  I thought this salad kept well also - was just as creamy the second day.

This is the best chicken salad that I have ever had!! The cream really does the trick - but I added about 1/2 less so it wasn't too runny. This was delicious on a toasted croissant. Yum:)

I tried making this chicken salad yesterday but i did not add whipping cream and yet my husband really loved it. I'll have to make it again some other time.

I loved this chicked salad. The only thing I will do differently next time is eliminate some of the mayo. I also used canned chicken and it tasted really good.

This was very good, I'd make it again.
