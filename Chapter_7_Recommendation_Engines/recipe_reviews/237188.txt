I added about a cup of ketchup, it made this recipe the right amount of sloppy

This is terrible.   Not enough sauce for the amount of meat.  The sauce is not even a little sloppy joe-like.  Added bbq, salsa, and cholula.

Love it! I double the recipe and  I've made it a bunch of times and always get compliments.   I do add a can of tomato paste and some water to make it a bit more juicy.  I make sure I drain and rinse the beef to reduce the fat. I'm making it right now for the Packer game.

This is a good base. We added tomato paste and water. Ketchup would work but it's higher in sodium...

I made this recipe and used red bell peppers instead of green. I have some diet restrictions and am trying to stay away from heavy sauces but still want flavor. My husband and I both loved it!! I will definately make it again!!

Good, very good - BUT - to me, Sloppy Joes have to have some tomato. I had some leftover Classico Sweet Basil sauce in the fridge so I added about a cup to the mix. I wonder if tomato or tomato sauce got accidently left out of this recipe as even in the accompanying photo, it looks tomatoey!
