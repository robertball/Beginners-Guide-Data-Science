I was looking to make fudge but I had no evaporated milk on hand. There was a terrible snow storm happening outside at the moment and I was going nowhere to get anything. Luckily I had these ingredients on hand,  well, I did use margarine instead of butter and it worked great. I did add some coconut which I love in everything and it was terrific.
This is an easy peasy fudge recipe. I would suggest adding other things, such as candied cherries, nuts, coconut and or raisins.
I would make this again and suggest others to try.

I'd say this a good example of you reap what you sow.  It has a very smooth texture but doesn't stay firm at room temperature.  Keep it in the fridge and it's a good treat.  It is very easy when you have a chocolate craving but if you are planning on giving it away I recommend putting in a little more effort than this recipe requires.  I will probably make it again for my family but that's about it.

Edible, but certainly not fudge. It's certainly not cooking. Easy for children to whip up and have fun with.

Great recipe!!  I experimented with this ~~ peppermint flavored chips and white frosting is delicious. Could be done using any flavor combination.

Normally, I don't look at reviews, but in this case I did after I made one batch. There is 2 things wrong with this recipe during the 1st round. #1, when melting 1/2 cup of butter with the semi-sweet chips it was very oil like(super shiny), so I proceeded to mix the frosting with the chocolate mix and to this I did follow to a T, it looked not gritty but not super lumpy either, like it didn't bind well, I checked it with a finger test and it wasn't either, just looked it but when chilled you could see whiteness over the top of the batch indicating too much butter. #2, by buttering a 9x13 pan and pouring the mixture into it...made the batch spread rather thin, the batch thickness was barely 1/2 inch thick. Wrong size pan for such a small batch, this is best utilizing an 8x8 size pan, nothing any larger. Now having said that, I looked at the recipe again and then the reviews, consulted a friend and we agreed, while it tasted more of chocolate frosting and tasty, this was slightly a miss. I proceeded with a 2nd batch that I decreased the batch to 1/4 cup of butter...used an 8x8 pan and it was a complete and utterly successful. Looking and tasting much more like a rich fudge, then the 1st batch. It was far better then the 1st batch as written. Still quick and easy-peasey, do take the suggestion of others and myself, decrease the butter to half as written and use a smaller pan. And you will come back to this easy recipe again and again.

I melt the chips and only 1/4 cup butter in the Microwave instead of the stove. Which work just as well. I bought prepared fudge frosting by mistake but used any way. I also add 1/2 cup walnuts. It worked great. Some people like a soft fudge which this is.

My kids and I enjoyed making this.  We significantly reduced the butter (two just a couple tablespoons) and it set up nicely.  Made three batches: one with Duncan Hines Fudge Supreme frosting, semisweet morsels, and chopped walnuts; the second batch with white frosting, white chips and pecans; the third batch with white frosting, white chips, and crushed peppermint on top.  Easy and fun to make with the kids!  Thanks!

Even easier: microwave the butter and chocolate chips.  Same effect, even less effort.  Very easy recipe, decent results.  The fudge is smooth, but starts melting as soon as it's removed from the refrigerator.

A very easy dessert to make. A great recipe for the busy, holiday season.  Does not get as thick as other fudge that I have had, but it is a great recipe if you are short on time.

Very chocolatey! Enough yo satisfy even PMS-style cravings...however, 13x9 is the wrong size pan unless you like very  thin fudge

After some trial and error, I found that leaving out the butter altogether gives me a better result. I also use a "tad" more chocolate chips to avoid the frosting flavor. This recipe makes a great base for creative additions. Nuts are a natural. I've also made this recipe with white frosting and chips. Strawberry frosting with the white chips has become a Christmas Eve demand from my grown kids. The possible combinations are limited only by what's available at your local store.
