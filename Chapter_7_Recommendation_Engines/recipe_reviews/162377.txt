This is a nice recipe for habanero paste.  The 24 serving size makes more than 1 and a half cups though.  We ended up with almost a tomato sauce jar full.  Tried it this morning on a breakfast burrito and my lips are still burning.  =)

My boyfriend loves habanero in his chili, so this is great to add to any crockpot dish for a little kick, I have found.  He is 'mr plain', so I put the water and pepper in the blender and puree them, add a cup of what ever applesauce I have around and simmer uncovered until the water cooks out and jar it up. Great consistency and tastes true to the fresh habanero flavor every time.

Blistered the Habanero, Jalapeno  & some Holly Mole' peppers on the grill for this past. I did not seed the peppers before blending up  the past. The past is very hot but has a great flavor and will make a nice addition to any home made hot sauce.

Nice hot sauce! I added some canned pineapple along with the carrot. Also added a Tbls of Honey. The fruit and honey made it slightly sweet, but it is still a very hot sauce which I like. Makes a great dipping sauce for everything!

Itâ€™s hot!  But really no flavor.
