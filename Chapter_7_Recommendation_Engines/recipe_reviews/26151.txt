I used these for a shower I went to where we ate hot dogs.  They were such a hit!  Everyone thought they were so cute, and they are pretty tasty too!  After reading the reviews I decided to add a little bit more sugar and they turned out wonderful.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I baked this cookie for my cub scouts, big hit!!! I used some green food, with the red, to make it look more like a hot dog.

These are adorable cookies!  I had a blast making them with my 6 and 3 year olds last night.  Very fun and tasty too!  I may try to make the dough a bit sweeter w/ some more powdered sugar next time.  The cookies just melt in your mouth.  This will be on my list to make the next time I get called for cookies for the school.  Would likely have to dbl. the recipe for that though.  Thumbs up!!

Definite cute factor but the taste was terrible.  The driest, most tasteless sugar cookie I've ever had.  Kids thought they were cool but took one bite and left them on their plates.  A disappointment.

Really cute!  The 1st grade class loved them for their year end party.  I made them with the hamburger cookies I already make and they had a "cookout" at school.

These cookies looked adorable, however, they weren't very sweet. They were also very heavy. Perhaps next time I will make them smaller in size so that they aren't so dense. Cute Idea though!

These were easy and SO MUCH FUN! My daughter took them to her preschool and some kids wouldn't eat them because "I don't like hot dogs" -- so they were very realistic too.

LOVED this recipe!!! I was shooting just simply for looks with taste not being too big a priority but they tasted melt in mouth good! We had a potluck at church with a Hot Dog theme and these were a hit on the dessert table!

The cookies definitely looked like little hot dogs, but they tasted kind of bland.  Next time, I would add more vanilla, or possibly some almond extract to give them more flavor.

The taste was very good.  I added about 1/4 cup more powdered sugar as was suggested in a previous review.  I gave it 4 stars because mine didn't look like the picture.  I am no pastry chef, but the bun flattened out so much while baking that it looked like a cookie, not a hot dog bun.  Still a good cookie and easily recognizable according to the kids that gobbled them up.
