OMG!!! This was a great recipe!!! A bit labor intensive with the grilling then broiling in the oven, but the end result was completely worth it! I suggest putting the chicken breasts in a freezer bag, add the Cajun seasoning, close it and shake it up. It makes it easier to evenly coat the chicken and itâ€™s less messy.
