I had a butter flavor cake mix, used real butter and these have to be the BEST bar recipe I've ever, ever made in my 54 years!  The dates I used were in a resealable pouch from Dole and they almost melted into the bars so that they are the most flavored bar.  The walnuts are perfect.  I will make this recipe again and again.  Thank you so much for posting this Linda!!!

This is an easy delicious recipe.  I used Duncan Hines Butter recipe cake mix and have forwarded the recipe to all my siblings.  My 81 year old aunt went to the store to get the ingredients and made them the same day.  She loved them as well!

I took these bars to a party last night and they were the favorite thing there!!  They were delicious and so easy to make!  Everyone wants the recipe now. I stuck to the recipe and wouldn't make any changes in the future. I'll be making them regularly now.

I first saw this recipe years ago in Taste of Home magazine.  These are awesome!  We love adding a cup or so of dried cranberries as well.

These are soooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  They are quick & simple to make.  My two & three year old love them and so does my husband.  It's nice that a small piece can be quite filling- great snack.  Plus not messy so perfect for the car.

These were nice and chewy, and I love chewy bars, but way too sweet for my taste.

I had 1/2 a cake mix and adjusted the recipe, more or less.  Added cinnamon and cloves.  These were moist, chewy and full of flavor.  My husband says save this recipe.

So good and so easy. I didn't change a thing. Be careful if you sample them fresh out of the oven you might not be able to stop!!! Do cool completely before you cut for serving as it is a little gummy while warm.

The recipe was delicious! However, I did not use the dates. At first I had no idea what dates were, until I bought and tasted them... they taste awful! So i doubled the amount of walnuts instead. I think maybe it was too much nuts. Next time I use 3 cups of walnuts.
