The blend of spices is delightful!  I thought the amount of cumin was spot on.  I did change the method of cooking because I was doing so many chops.  I baked them at 375F for 35 minutes, until they reached 145F.  Delicious!

Made this for lunch today. I used 6 small pork chops and there was plenty of sauce to cover nicely when it was finished cooking. The pork chops were tender and flavorful. I think next time I will let the chops sit for a longer duration for more flavor. We loved the spice combo!

This was an absolute hit! My other half stated “this is a gourmet meal.” Delicious combo of seasonings! Will definitely make again. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Instead of cider I sliced and peeled apples and baked on top of meat... DELICIOUS!!!!!!

No changes; have made it twice now. This blend of spices and cider results in delicious, moist pork.

This was very good.  I modified it to make it in the instant pot, because that is how I cook everything these days.   I prepared everything as directed, the only change was to the cooking method.  I used the sauté feature on the instant pot to brown the pork chops in the butter, then removed the pork chops, poured in the apple cider & the rest of the spice mix, stirring to deglaze the pan.   Added pork back in, sealed IP, cooked manual high pressure for 30 minutes, then did natural pressure real ease (about 15 more minutes).
