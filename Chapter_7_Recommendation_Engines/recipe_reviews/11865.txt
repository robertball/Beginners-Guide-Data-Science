4 Stars because the concept is so simple.  Three for taste with the recipe as is.  I had to double the spices, because the first time I thought it was too blah (but I like LOTS of flavor).  Next time I will also top with cheese and then it will definitely go in our rotation.

This was pretty good.  I prepared exactly to recipe instructions, and the noodles were kind of mushy.  I prefer a firmer pasta.

This was delicious and super easy. I used 8oz of canned mushrooms and 1 cup of marinara sauce instead of plain tomato sauce (just because it's what I had on hand). I'm definitely adding this to our regular rotation and think there are lots of possibilities to customize it -- add sausage next time, maybe?

This was quick, easy and so delicious! My husband had two plates and even our 5 year old daughter, who NEVER finishes a meal, ate her entire plate!  I left out the onion since my daughter won't eat it and used 8 oz of mushrooms.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My daughter thought there was a little too much pepper in it, and I agreed that it was a little too much, so next time I will cut back on it.  This will be a regular at our house served with salad and rosemary french bread from the local bakery.

I loved the one pot idea.  I thought it was tangy and mushy.  I wouldn't cook it as long again.  Next time I will add a little more sugar and top with cheese.

I first made it as written, and I agree with other reviewers it was pretty bland.  I made this again with fresh tomatoes, herbs, garlic, and added some zucchini from the garden and it was wonderful.  This time I also added a pound of hot italian ground sausage for my meat loving husband but I'm sure with the fresh veges & herbs it would have been excellent without.

This was really good.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it was a bit too sweet for us.  Next time I make this I won't add the sugar.  It is a 5/5 with no sugar.  I use canned mushrooms and fresh garlic.  Also I use a regular pot, not a nonstick, and haven't had any problem with sticking at all.

I took others advice & put in more spices than it called for, and maybe that was my bad.  I have never had any luck with tomato based sauces before anyway so it could just be me, but I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

This meal was made out of desperation because there was "nothing to eat" and I wasn't expecting much, but it was excellent!  It's easy and I'm sure I will make it again on a busy weeknight.

The pasta was very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly and then sprinkled some mozzarella.  My husband really enjoyed it and said it is a keeper.

I made this last night and was pleased with how easy it was and how tasty it was!  I did stray from the "one pot" ease of this dish and cooked my pasta in a separate pan after reading reviews about mushy pasta.  I used whole wheat and was concerned with the texture.  I also threw in some fresh spinach and fresh garlic because I needed to use the spinach and I love garlic (hee hee.)  Extremely happy with the results and looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

This was a good concept but the pasta never really cooked completely. It was very starchy and gummy. I recommend cooking the noodles separately even though it means using an extra pot.

As someone else said, 4 stars for the ease of cooking the noodles in the sauce but 3 stars as written. I tasted the sauce about halfway through and I found it to be lacking in flavor. I ended up throwing in red pepper flakes, some garlic salt (in addition to the garlic powder, but I love garlic), and some ancho chile powder. As you can tell I like things spicy. :) With the added spices, I enjoyed it much more. I would say doctor this up with whatever spices you prefer, but I do think it needs additional flavoring. As-is, it was somewhat bland. I also added some fresh spinach in a minute or so before the onion and mushrooms were done cooking both for color and for added nutritional value. Next time I'll add more - it made for a very pretty dish!

super easy and super good! i thought it would be so ordinary, but it was surprisingly tasty. the only things i did different were to decrease the cook time once the noodles were added to 12 minutes. also, when it was finished, i added lots of shredded mozzarella. this is so inexpensive to make too!

This was good and very easy, but I only needed to cook the pasta for about 12-15 minutes as other reviewers suggested. My husband wasn't crazy about it, as he's not a big tomato fan, but the fact that he ate it anyway is impressive.

I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper, orange bell pepper, browned ground turkey and sliced black olives and it turned out great. Had to increase the amount of water by 1/4 cup since I added so many ingredients.

easy, hearty, but BLAND.  Trying to cut out sweets, so I left out the sugar.  If I do it again, I'll add parsley and bay leaves.  Maybe even add cheese.

For a college student new to the kitchen, this is an easy dish to make. I ditched the mushrooms, but it smelled so good while I was making it! I also didn't have any sugar, but I don't think it needed it anyways.  I thought there was too much pepper in it though, so next time I'll half it and see what happens

This worked out fine for a quick vegan meal. I used whole wheat pasta instead of regular pasta. I added kale and textured vegetable protein. I also substituted agave for the sugar. Next time I will add crushed red pepper.

Good basic and easy pasta dish but does need some more spices.   
A good addition is to swap out tomato sauce for a spicy marinara and add lots of garlic and chopped black peppers.     Just use your imagination.

This was good and easy! Great for those nights when you don't have a lot of time.  I substituted black olives for the mushrooms and added frozen Italian meatballs with the uncooked pasta, then topped with fresh grated parmesan for more flavor.

Excellent dish - needs a few extra items to add some kick though. Such as jalopenos, banana peppers, and several colors of bell peppers.

This had just the right spices in it, and was very tasty! I would recommend trying this recipe!
