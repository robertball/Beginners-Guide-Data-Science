I loved how the icing required no cooking, and it had a wondeful fluffy texture. I didn't feel it had the strongest chocolate flavor, however, and tasted too "sugary". I melted two squares of unsweetened chocolate and whipped it in - the flavor improved greatly and the texture was not compromised. I think next time I'll leave the cocoa powder completely out and just use unsweetened squares. Thanks for sharing.

I used this frosting for cupcakes.  I added 2 additional tbl of milk to get the right consistency.  Frosting is not too sweet and just right.  I will never purchase store bought too (like a previous rater said).  Thanks for the receipt.

This icing went great with sugar cookies, I left out the cocoa powder and added an extra tsp. of vanilla. Also about 2 tablespoons more milk to get the right consistency.

This is just fantastic! I am here in Norway and often get a craving for good old buttercream frosting. I used it for a devils food cake and I thought it not only tasted delicious but looked really nice too. Thanks for sharing!

Perfect! I needed a basic vanilla frosting recipe and couldn't find one with good reviews.  So I took this one and ommitted the cocoa then added one extra teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by another reviewer.  It was excellent!

This frosting certainly stands as is, but for my needs (I frosted "Banana Cake l" with it) I wanted it more buttery and more chocolatey - I added more of both.  I beat it on low speed (2) of my KitchenAid stand mixer for 10 minutes.  I used half-and-half rather than milk.  Rich, smooth, creamy, silky, chocolatey, and spreads like a dream.

I picked this recipe because I tried to make some chocolate chip cookies from a box, which was a big mistake because they came out very bland, and because they were so bad I decided to make bars out of them instead of cookies.  So I was looking for a very chocolatey frosting specifically for cookie-bars.  When I followed the recipe exactly as written, I loved the texture, but barely tasted any chocolate at all.  It didn't even look chocolatey-- just very light brown.  After adding *several* squares of baking chocolate, it's just okay.  It's better than no frosting at all, but not really what I had in mind.

Freaking YUMMAY! I did make a couple changes though.
I doubled the butter, kept the sugar amount the same, and added WAY more cocoa powder - Probably about 1/2 cup. I wanted it not overly sweet and really chocolaty, and that's what I got. DELISH!

Eh, this was very lightly chocolate-flavored. That's OK, that's what I wanted for the peanut butter cupcakes I made from the recipe on this site. But I can see how folks would be disappointed if they're looking for something hershey-flavored or even darker. I was slightly disappointed in the amount of frosting, I made two dozen cupcakes and was piping the frosting on, and even though a few of the cupcakes had been eaten without frosting, this batch made barely enough to pipe the rest. So the '24' servings shown would have been *very* thinly frosted cupcakes or rather small cookies. Eh well, I thought it might be too little going in but I didn't have any more powdered sugar than called for or I would have doubled it. Anyway, I think next time I would double the recipe for the full batch of cupcakes, and maybe add a little more cocoa powder if I needed a heavier chocolate flavor. I might toss in a dash or two of salt as well, as I really like salt with chocolate. This was quite a sweet frosting as well. Not really picking faults, you understand, just describing the result so that others will know what they're getting into. The texture was good, it was nice for piping without adding any extra milk beyond what was called for. If you are looking for dark chocolate, seek elsewhere. This is very lightly chocolatey, very mild, good for a mild-tasting cookie or cupcake.

I give this recipe 5 stars. I used it to frost a cake and it crusts perfectly. It was very smooth, very easy to make, and tastes great. My new favorite chocolate buttercream frosting. Thanks Nancy for the great recipe.

This isn't the best chocolate frosting I've ever had, but it's really close.  I made a chocolate cake that was really rich, so I wanted a lighter chocolate frosting that's not too sweet or rich.  This definitely fit the bill.  It's light and fluffy, not dense like 'fudge' frosting.  It's almost as good as chocolate ice cream.  The only thing I didn't like was the small quantity.  I doubled the recipe and it still makes less that the Wilton Buttercream frosting recipe.  So if you're going to use this to frost, say, a layer cake, don't expect much frosting.

Pretty good. I only had half the powdered sugar and I thought that was the right amount. I don't like overly sugary frostings. Just the right amount of sweetness.

I made some cookies that were a little bland to say the least and this frosting saved them.  It's such a basic recipe that most people would have all of the ingredients on hand.  This tastes so much better than canned frosting and is very easy to make.  I'll never buy chocolate frosting again.  This recipe is also good for a vanilla buttercream if you omit the chocolate and add a little more vanilla.

It's a good base to work from. I was looking for a chocolate buttercream frosting. I had to double the cocoa just so I could taste the chocolate. Super easy to make and will for sure use it again with 6 tblsp of cocoa ;)

Just the perfect sugar-butter ratio. The frosting is light and not to sweet. The vanilla adds the perfect hint.

Very good frosting! I used this to frost "Chewy Brownie Cookies" from this site. The cookies had mint chips in them, so I added 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract to the frosting. Yum! I did have to add more milk to get it to the right consistency.

Wow! What a great recipe. I used this as the frosting for a double layer chocolate cake and it was awesome! Just used 4x the frosting for a whole cake. Definitely a keeper.

I wasn't impressed with this frosting. It didn't have much of a chocolate flavor and then it didn't want to frost onto my cake. I will not be using this frosting again.

I believe I did it wrong. :( Before adding all the ingredients together I melted the butter and it was too liquidy so I had to add an extra cup of powdered sugar. It's in the refrigerator now and I don't know how it will turn out... but so far the taste is good so I will give it five stars. Next time I will keep the butter at room temperature.

Good recipe-I used it to frost the Black Forest Cake II here.  I took the advice of others and substituted melted chocolate squares (dark chocolate) for the cocoa powder.  This was a very yummy frosting for the cake and everyone raved about the whole dessert!

I wanted a buttercream frosting with no shortening (blech!).  I omitted the cocoa since I wanted vanilla, and estimated the milk based on consistency.  I doubled the recipe for 24 cupcakes.  It came out delicious!  This will be my go-to frosting from now on.  Easily adaptable to many flavors.

I made this to frost "Butter Cake" from this site.  I had to add more milk/cream to make it more of a frosting consitancy.  This cake was one layer of a 9x9 so if you have a bigger cake to frost double the recipe.

Amazing recipe - five stars for flavor (not too sweet, smooth chocolate and buttercream flavor) consistency (good for decorating - just add 1 tsp milk at a time until reach spreading consistency), and simplicity (really, it's hard to mess this up).  Used it on a 9x13" cake (doubled recipe)... look no further for a perfectly balanced chocolate icing.

Remember that the type of cocoa powder you use will determine the "darkness".
If you use a dark cocoa powder, you'll get a more chocolatey taste and darker appearance.
Also, an organic dark cocoa powder actually gives it a much cleaner, brighter taste.

This was the most disgusting chocolate icing I have ever tasted!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was nasty.  It looked good, but tasted like pure sugar with a hint of chocolate aftertaste.  What a wast of time and ingredients.  Luckily I had some store bought frosting in the cupboard or else I would have to gone all the way to the store to buy some because I had to dump this icing.  Yuck!

The texture was a little too sugary for me, so I added 1/4 cup sour cream and some extra milk, which made it better but a little thinner. I also added a few spoonfulls of Nutella and topped a banana cake with the frosting. Nice results! You just have to tweak the frosting to your taste.

This was easy and delicious.  It frosted a 9 x 13 cake with very little left over.  Perfect.  It seems better to let it stand for a little while before you frost the cake to let the the flavors meld.

I love this recipe! it is fast and easy to make and doesn't require a lot of ingredients.I added a  little bit of extra milk and it was the right consistency for me.I would suggest leaving out the cocoa powder and replacing it with lemon juice/zest, lime juice/zest, peanut butter, almond extract, peppermint extract, and orange juice/zest.it does not make as much frosting as it looks though since the butter, vanilla and milk dissolve the confectioners sugar and cocoa powder.This goes well on chocolate chip cookies.:)

I made this frosting to go with Grace W.'s cream filled chocolate cupcake recipe (without the cream, I just wanted the cake part) This was my second recipe attempt in recent days, and it turned out perfect. Like I said about the cupcakes I'll say about the frosting: I'll never buy it out of a box again. I chose this buttercream frosting over others because some didn't contain butter, instead using lard. Um, what's "butter" cream frosting? It has BUTTER! This was light and creamy, totally unlike the heavy, chemically taste of tub frosting. And so absolutely simple. I followed the recipe exact and it whipped up just fine. One note, I took the advice of other reviewers and flavored it with melted baking chocolate instead of powder. So much healthier than tub stuff, and when it comes down to it, cheaper to buy the real ingredients, too.

This was really tasty as-is! I did use 3 tbsp of milk. It was a little thick after it set, so I probably should have used 4 tbsp of milk. However... there's no way it made 3 cups. I had to double the recipe to get 3 cups. When I did that, it turned out way too sweet and less chocolatey than I'd like, so I'd recommend using less sugar and compensating with the same amount of cocoa powder.

Tasted great and worked well with my frozen buttercream transfer. My technique/results were less than desirable but the buttercream frosting still tasted great!

I reluctantly tried this as I do not like buttercream frosting which tends to be too airy in texture. I like frosting I can really sink my teeth into.  I needed a chocolate frosting recipe and was looking for something simple and settled on this one.  This is a rich and creamy frosting. It is nothing like the buttercream frosting I'm familiar with and I love it!  Our cupcakes, topped with this frosting, flew off the counter they were so good.  It did take more than 2 tablespoons  of milk for the mix to go from powdery to smooth and creamy, though.

Very quick, easy frosting.  After following directions I did add a LITTLE more butter and milk for a smoother consistency.  I would suggest when mixing do so on a higher speed as this also helps with consistency.

I'd still rather use the "Betty Crocker" chocolate icing recipe which uses unsweetened baking chocolate (will upload soon), but overall it was good, I reduced the cocoa powder to 2 tablespoons and I didn’t had to add more milk.

Very easy recipe. Whipped to the right consistency, this frosting is perfect for cakes/cupcakes. I doubled the recipe and it was exactly enough frosting for 24 cupcakes. Delicious flavor as is. Add a touch of almond extract for a slightly more sophisticated taste. This one's going in my recipe box for sure.

This is a fantastic frosting recipe, especially since I just moved and am without an electronic mixer.  I halved the recipe to make half vanilla and half chocolate.  For the vanilla, I doubled the extract in it per other reviews.  For the chocolate, I used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Cocoa Powder and the taste was incredible, perfectly chocolaty.  I ended up putting the frosting in between two peanut butter chocolate chip cookies that came out a little on the crispy side to make a sandwich of sorts.  They taste fantastic! Thanks!

Perfect texture and flavor, especially with the dutch processed cocoa and Mexican vanilla! It was only enough for 20 cupcakes, so next time I make the frosting, I will change the portions a touch.

WoW! This is the best chocolate frosting EVER!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I had to mod it just a little.  I made it "as is" the 1st time and it was sooooo incredibly chocolatey it kinda made me cringe, & I'm a chocolate lover!   I needed more than what this made so I doubled the recipe but did not add more cocoa or extract.  It was almost perfect!  I think next time I will try it with 2T of cocoa and add more if needed.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  Added more milk to get the right consistency.  Just enough to frost a 13X9.  Would need to double for a larger cake.  Will definetly make again.

Great chocolate flavor. I doubled this, used unsalted butter, and used it to frost a chocolate cake. I ran out of milk though so I used heavy whipping cream instead. Very good frosting. Thanks, this was great. I will use this recipe again. I did have to add more cream though as it was still too thick for frosting the cake.

When I made this frosting (for a cake), this is the first time I made frosting from scratch. I found it to be pretty easy, but here are some observations I made concerning the instructions: 1. You absolutely have to sift the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. 2. I found it worked best when I first mixed the super-softened butter and about 1/4 to 1/2 of the powdered sugar, very thoroughly creaming them together with the spatula. 3. Heating the milk a bit (to about drinking temperature) helped. 4. After creating a thick cream of the butter, sugar, and milk, I worked the rest of the powdered sugar and cocoa in until it was smooth.  One of my great aunts always made a family-favorite chocolate cake. Now I know why it tasted so good--she used home-made buttercream frosting. =)

I only give this 3 stars for "as written."  I used less than 2 cups of powdered sugar, and made up the difference with cocoa powder. Without the extra cocoa, it was not very chocolatey, though the texture was great. With that change, it was delicious. I also sometimes puree defrosted frozen strawberries, and use the puree instead of the milk to make a chocolate strawberry frosting.

I was disappointed with this frosting.  There was too much powdered sugar taste and not enough chocolate taste.  I did appreciate that it didn't make a ton because I was frosting a small pan of brownies, but that's not reason enough for me to make it again.

I wanted to use this frosting for cupcakes so i took advise from another reviewer and used just under 1/4 cup milk for a creamier frosting. Quick, easy and delicious. Makes just enough for 24 cupcakes.

I just wanted a good chocolate frosting recipe to pair with some graham crackers, a fun treat. This was an easy, very yummy frosting. For the sweet tooths out there, this is perfect. For those of you who don't like things that are very sweet, I would recommend finding a different recipe. The powdered sugar and butter shine in this recipe to create something rich. This frosting seems so versitle (sp?). I hope to make this again! I really liked this recipe. Oh, and the other great thing about it was that I didn't need to pull out my mixing machine to deal with this. I only made 3 servings and I just used a fork. This was a very easy, quick, and yummy recipe!

This was the gooeyest chocolateyest almost-didn't-ice-the-cake-but-instead-ate-it stuff I have ever put in my mouth.  I double batched it and made 2 9" rounds which I cut into four layers.  I put Solo cherry filling on between the first two, then a layer of this icing, more cake, more cherry filling and topped it with the last layer of cake.  I gave it a thin coat around the cake, then I added more milk to the remaining icing and watched it ooze down the side of my cake like you seen in commercials and my most awesome dreams ever.  My chocolate cake is always so moist and I can't ever find the right icing - this has the IT factor!

Easy and good. I added more milk to make a glaze for a bundt cake. But if you wanted a deeper chocolate taste use dark chocolate cocoa powder.

Loved the consistency of this frosting. Many of the frostings I've tried have been too gooey, and I really prefer a more "stiff" buttercream that can hold its own on top of a cupcake or brownies. Definitely suggest this for bakery quality chocolate frosting!

I followed the recipe as stated and ended up with a great consistency... but it also turned out extremely sugary. However, I thinned it out using milk and then iced my cake and put it in the refrigerator. The coldness allows the icing to thicken up just enough and the cold temperature actually cancels out the shock factor of how sweet it is. I used this on the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" and it suited each other wonderfully! I highly recommend!

Loved this recipe.  So simple, and it produces a delicious, soft and fluffy frosting.  I chose this one because it called for way less sugar than most others.  Frosting does not need to be sickly sweet.  I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa, and a little bit of extra milk to get it to the right consistency.  Add your milk slowly, and just little bits at a time, because you don't want too much and then need to compensate by adding extra sugar.  Used these on Cheesecake Topped Brownies and it was almost the best part!  :)

This is a great basic buttercream frosting. I did not have cocoa powder so I used half a cup of melted chocolate chips and the consistancy was still just right. I also followed a previous review and added an extra tsp of vanilla.

I always have way too much leftover frosting so I appreciated the smaller yield from this recipe. I used 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa and generously measured the vanilla. This was plenty chocolatey for our taste. Great on cinnamon/chocolate cupcakes.

Perfect as is. I used this on a cake I made for Easter, it was the "dirt" & I tinted some coconut green for the "grass". Best chocolate frosting ever! For people that said it wasn't chocolatey enough, mine was very yummy. Try using Ghirardelli cocoa powder. It is hands down, better than any of the others out there.

Perfect is the only word that comes to mind. I needed a chocolate frosting that would "dry" for lack of a better word to frost cookies with. This was the perfect amt of sweetness, the perfect texture and just all around perfect.

Used this recipe specifically because I needed something quick and had all the ingredients in my pantry.  It would not be enough frosting for a cake, but it covered my cupcakes.  It involved no cooking, so I loved the ease and quickness of the recipe, and the flavor was great.  I'll probably use this again.

24 servings dont make very much. Maybe consider doubling recipe. Taste is excellent! I used Baker's Mysetery Flavoring instead of vanilla. It gave is sort of an almondy flavor. I had gotten it thru a baking catalog and it is clear flavoring.

This worked as a good base, but needed some major tweaking.  I added 4-5 tablespoons cocoa powder to add some chocolatey taste, and then added probably double the milk.  I also mixed this with a hand blender to get it nice and fluffy (which isn't mentionned in the Directions). 
The recipe gave me an indication of how to make a good frosting, but ultimately I changed it so much that I was no longer following the directions given.

Thank you, Nancy, for sharing this great frosting!  What's great is that it's good just as written but is forgiving to the point that you can make pretty much any adjustments according to your liking and/or needs -- and it works.

I thought this was okay. I used butter insted of shorting and little lumps of butter stayed solid in the icing and it wasnt very thick so it was okay. Probally wouldnt use again

Nice frosting.  I cut back the sugar by about 1 cup and added some shortening for more body.  It was so nice to pipe on the frosting and it set up nicely.  Will use again.

Big fan of this recipe!  Will definitely use it again!  I used half butter and half butter flavored Crisco because it was a very hot day ( I was afraid the icing would melt if made with all butter).  It was great, and everyone at the party loved it!

This was fantastic!  I made a plain white cakes and wanted a nice chocolate frosting, and this was it!  I used reduced fat margarine for the butter but otherwise, no extra milk or anything.  Perfect consistancy and spread so nicely on an 8x11 vanilla cake.  Thank you Nancy for the perfect chocolate frosting.

**LOVED IT** So easy, so fast, and just darn TASTY stuff! I made some sugar cookies (which, to me, are not very exciting but my BF loves them)... and wanted to make them more yummy. This was PERFECT! I loved how creamy it is; velvety goodness! Can't wait to use again. And again. And again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and thought this had a nice mellow flavor and good consistency.  As far as chocolatety-ness, for me, this fit the bill perfectly for what I needed, which was something my kids could spread on their own homemade cookies for a fun Friday night activity.  And honestly, if you dice the butter into small cubes and whip this up in a stand mixer, it is almost as quick and easy as opening up a can of frosting...good recipe!

This is a really easy recipe.  I used it to frost cupcakes.  When I first tasted it, it was just okay -- but after chilling the cupcakes in the fridge for a few hours it was PERFECT!  I made a chocolate batch and omitted the cocoa for a vanilla batch.  WONDERFUL and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe.  It was almost exactly what I was looking for.  I added some melted chocolate chips to it to give it a little more of a milk chocolate taste, the original was slightly too much cocoa for me.  But the recipe is excellent and easy to work with!

DELISH and amazingly simple and quick. Couldn't be any yummier. It's says 24 servings I believe but we ended up making a double batch and it wasn't very much -- so then made another single batch and that seemed sufficient (for cupcakes). Just a heads up. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

This was a nice, easy chocolate frosting, but it was very light on the chocolate taste.  The recipe also doesn't make very much -- I had to double it.

It was ok, but not a buttercream. Very sweet, ok on the chocolate flavor.  Noticed that it was very similar to the recipe on the back of the cocoa box.  Made enough to frost a 2 layer 9 inch round.

I love this frosting!  It was so delicious and it actually saved some horrible cookies that I'd made.  The perfect frosting recipe.

Instead of cocoa, I melted some unsweetened chocolate and put it in, and I also had to use a couple more tablespoons of milk to get the consistency I wanted. Tasted amazing, this will definitely be my go-to chocolate frosting!

This was WAY too sweet as written.  I had to add extra butter, whipping cream and finally some cream cheese to cut the sweetness.  I will admit, though, that I'm not a huge fan of really sweet stuff but this actually hurt my teeth when I tasted it!!

This frosting had a very pleasant, light, and buttery chocolate flavor. It was a little sweet, however. Since the recipe makes nowhere near 3 cups, I tripled the recipe. This was just about the perfect amount for frosting my 4-layer chocolate cake! I did have to add a lot of extra milk to make the frosting the right consistency. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first buttercream frosting I've ever made and it was fantastic!  I used them to frost cupcakes for my church gathering and they were devoured!  My sister-in-law says she doesn't like chocolate, but when she tasted this frosting she really enjoyed it! This is definitely my "go-to" frosting recipe for all time!  Thanks!

So much better than store bought! I did have to add 1 Tbsp. more of milk but other than that I didn't change it for the chocolate.  It made for excellent black tinted frosting for Halloween sugar cookies.  For regular vanilla buttercream I left out the cocoa and added 1 tsp. more of vanilla extract.  For this one I didn't have to add any extra milk.

I just want to make a big ole bowl of this and swim around in it.  :-)
I had never made un canned, un store bought frosting.  I used this as a crumb coating on a cake I'll be putting fondant on later.  I was dipping bananas into the bowl before it was all over.  YUM YUM YUM

I doubled this recipe for frosting a 9" 2-layer cake.  Amount of frosting was perfect for the cake.  I added a little more milk for ease of spreading, but icing held up well.  I loved the way it hardened ever so slightly - it will be perfect frosting for cupcakes or cookies (gooey frosting on cupcakes just won't work for me!)

Butter cream isnt quite my taste, but I made it for my step dad and he deemed it "good" which is high praise from him indeed. Pretty easy to work with.

quick easy and good frosting. I omitted the cocoa and added neon blue and green food coloring to make them more colorful for my 4 year old son. Thanks for this one!

wowzers.  i didn't think i'd make another chocolate frosting after my first attempt failed.  i'm glad i chose otherwise because this frosting's fantastic.  next time though, i think i'd just lessen the cocoa powder a bit... i still taste a little bitterness in the frosting.  nevertheless, 5 stars!

I took out the cocoa powder, used 3/4 the amount of icing sugar the recipe called for, beat it with a electric mixer, and it turned out nice and fluffy!Sweet, but not in an overpowering way.

This is a nice creamy frosting but I find it to sugary.  Next time I will cut the sugar by a 1/2 cup. I did what another person said and added 2 unsweetned chocolate squares and 1 tsp of milk.  Also if you let it stand the flavor improves.

This has a good flavor and is not overly sweet; however it was not quite the consistency I needed. For me there is too much butter and not enough sugar for it to be as creamy as I prefer.

Great basic recipe.  I made a cake thinking I had a tub of frosting....when I went to get it-it was gone.  So I resorted to the home made kind and it was very yummy and very easy to spread.  I will make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

So easy, required few ingredients and was the perfect balance between creamy and stiff.  Will definitely use again.  Thought it was great.  Appreciated the absence of shortening as I think it leaves a film on the roof of one's mouth!!  Very great submission

This is really delicious! So yummy that I licked the beaters!  
I made it as is to start. The frosting was too thick for my purpose so I added another Tbsp of milk. It was the perfect amount for my 13x9 pan of brownies. Thanks!

Made as directed except used half &  half instead of milk. It's really sweet and you can taste more of the confectioners sugar instead of the cocoa.

I made it with vegan butter and soy milk.  I put it on a cake, not cookies, and was licking the bowl after.  It was great and I will definitely make it again!!

wonderful! I always thought making a chocolate frosting would be difficult, this recipe really isn't. I didn't use a hand mixer, I think it would have been very messy because of the powdery mixture so I just used a fork. I also didn't let my butter get to room temp so I melted the butter a bit in the microwave. I also didnt measure the milk exactly. just added cap full (from the milk jug) until I thought it was right. worked out real well!

Simple and delicious. A very light, milk chocolatey kind of chocolate. A nice option for those that aren't "death by chocolate", 900% cacao kind of people.

I made this recipe as is, and it was perfect for icing the cookies that I had made.  I used a premium brand (not store brand) cocoa powder and this made a very big difference.  The flavour was very chocolatey and rich.

After reading some of the comments, I used half of the powdered sugar and replaced the coco powder for half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. It turned out sweet with a bit of a bite at the end.

pretty good; I can't quite say how it was because I just used the recipe as a guideline. I added an extra cup and a half of powdered sugar. I wanted maple frosting for an angel food cake, so I tool out the cocoa and vanilla and added three tsp. maple syrup. It's not that bad, but it's got a kind of grainy texture from the powdered sugar.

Easy and delicious!   I used half the cocoa powder because I wanted it to be just slightly chocolatey for Pistachio Marble cupcakes.   I'll put in the full amount of cocoa when I make this to frost a devil's food cake.

I really do love this recipe for frosting. You can always play with vanilla and cinnamon for something else. I add the milk half a tablespoon at a time.

I loved this recipe. I changed it based on my family's personal preferences by using only 3 cups powdered sugar. I used 3 oz melted bittersweet chocolate as well as 2 tsp cocoa powder with 2 extra tbsp cream for spreadability. I think it would taste good as written, my family (not me) are addicted to packaged stuff. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Took the advice of one person and added a couple of chocolate squares, I love chocolate! But, after melting I didn't get back to it fast enough and it became chunky. I didn't mind the chunks in the frosting but I'll follow the recipe as is next time. This one is a keeper!! Thank you!

I've made this for my birthday cake, twice for sugar cookies, and once for cupcakes. It's just sooooo DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!
:] :] :] Although once I made for sugar cookies once, I ate 3 spoon fills of it It's a little drippy and I might suggest to add a little powdered sugar to it or not as much milk. But otherwise it tasted great!  #LicktheBowlClean

WoW! I thought it was great, I did add the tbs of sour cream like she said. 
I also used this recipe to make vanilla buttercream frosting, 
I used the sour cream in that as well. I do like the vanilla better, but that's just my preference.

Easy recipe to whip up and it's acceptable if you're in a pinch for some frosting , but I thought it was a little too sweet and it didn't really have that rich chocolatey flavor I was after.

Loved it. I added day old coffee to the recipe to give a coffee taste and added it to a chocolate cake. Got lots of compliments. Will be putting this in my cookbook.

Substituted two squares of melted unsweetened chocolate for the cocoa powder as others have suggested. Delicious! Super easy to make, super easy to spread.

I made this icing for a yellow cake. The recipe was very flexible. Due to personal preference, I added 2 T of shortening, 3 melted squares of unsweetened chocolate squares and ended up adding about 4 T total of whole milk. Not that you have to, but I always sift the powered sugar. I beat the heck outta the frosting in my mixer for about 10 minutes and it made a very light and chocolatey frosting.

This was a good frosting. We used it on some okay sugar cookies and it made them taste a bit better. I am still searching for a better recipe, but would use this one if I was in a hurry.

This was the perfect frosting for my daughters ice cream cake!  Not to rich, very tasty!  I used a combination of heavy whipping cream & milk to get the consistency I needed.  This has now became my "go to" recipe for frosting!!  Thanks so much for providing!

I think I'll do a bit bigger portion the next time (there will definitely be next time!) - I calculated the ingredients to 16 servings and it was barely enough for putting a bit of it on 15 cupcakes. It was really delicious though, thanks for sharing!

This is really tasty chocolate frosting that is super easy to make.  It wasn't too rich, which was nice, since I used it on an already-sweet birthday cake.  I would recommend using a little more milk, as recommended in the recipe.  Also, if you need to go back and touch up the recipe, make sure to use a wet spatula.  It dries pretty quickly.

Fantastic recipe!  I used this frosting to ice simple white cake cupcakes for a birthday party.  The cupcakes were light and fluffy, with a wonderful flavor.  I wanted the frosting a little more "chocolatey," so I melted some milk chocolate chips and added to the mix.  The consistency was still perfect.  Wonderful frosting!!!

This is maybe the second time I have ever made frosting and it was really good. And like other raters said, very sweet...which I happen to like. Also needs a little extra milk. So easy, I have no idea why anyone would buy frosting. Thank you!

This worked great for my cup cakes, and was very easy. I had to use more milk than it called for, but used too much, so I suggest adding it very slowly. It was still very good, my husband put the extra in the fridge, too good to toss!

Let me point out, I did follow this recipe, and I didn't like it the way it was to begin with. Changing it made it worse, but it was pretty bad to start off. Here's the original review:  This was terrible. It was disgustingly sweet. I tried to cut the sweetness by adding the unsweetened chocolate squares like someone else said, then by adding more co-co powder and more butter. That just ended up making a greasy frosting.

This is really good. I don't like frosting or icing. I was making it for my husband who does. I actually really enjoyed this because it was light and not too sugary. I did add a bit more powder as we wanted a more chocolatey taste and more milk to make it smooth. We put it on a white cake.

Like a previous reviewer, I substituted the cocoa powder with melted chocolate. This frosting hardens quickly, so if you want to add sprinkles, shake them on right away.

Loved it! I did melt an oz of baking chocolate, increased milk a touch for spreadibility and threw in some extra cocoa powder. I licked my food processor clean! Well, except for the blade, but i did use my finger on that. Frosting held up nicely and was great the next day.

Easy to make.  Flavor was a little light.  I added a little extra milk, which made it creamier. It stayed creamy even after several hours.

Great starting point, but not chocolaty enough. I ended up adding ~1 more tbs cocoa powder and melted down some dark chocolate with milk and added that to get a better chocolate flavor. Great for cakes, spreads nicely.

I used this on the Dark Chocolate Cake I recipe from this  site.  The frosting was very good! The only thing was that I think it needed a bit more milk to start with (maybe 1/2 tbsp more) because it started drying as I was icing the cake. I know it says to add more milk as needed, but I think initially if you start with a bit more milk and add more from that it would be more spreadable. A very tasty frosting though and I will definitely be using it again!

Thanks!

Easy to make with items in my pantry, not too sweet or rich but light and fluffy. I love it. My daughter requested it as frosting on her birthday cake!

I was expecting a chocolatey frosting, as pictured, but it in actuality, it's a very light brown/tan color and doesn't taste anything as chocolately as store-bought frosting.  Not that I like store bought frosting!!...but I was looking to make my own version of chocolately frosting.  But, to give credit to this recipe, it's not a chocolate fudge frosting, it's a chocolate buttercream.  It tastes good, is light and fluffy, and I'd probably use it to make vanilla/white buttercream frosting (great texture).  I added a whole lot more milk though.

I've tried so many different kinds of chocolate frosting, including storebought, and WOW DOES THIS ONE BEAT THEM ALL!  It's very light and fluffy.  I use a KitchenAid mixer to make it, and it's amazing.  You can't help licking out the bowl!  :)  I would definintely recommend it for anything chocolate - I use it for cakes.

This frosting was DELICIOUS! I made it and put it on a yellow cake and everybody gobbled it right up! I would recommend adding a tad bit more milk but besides that, the flavor was great and this will be a permanent addition to my recipe box!

This is a wonderful frosting. It needs more milk and I added enough to give me the consistency desired. Do not leave standing too long at room temperature as it will dry but if it happens, a few more drops of milk and whipping will give it back its texture.  
It is sweet and applies well.  Thanks

Very tasty and easy.  I realized as I was mixing it that I wasn't going to have enough to frost my two layer cake, so I added a bit more sugar and milk, it worked out great.  YUM.

Thank you for this recipe!! I was looking for something to frost some brownies with and this is perfect! I just hope i have enough left to frost them after all the spoonfuls I keep sneaking!
