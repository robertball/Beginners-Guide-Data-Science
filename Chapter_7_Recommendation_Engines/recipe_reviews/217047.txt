This soup is SO flavorful and tastes like it must have something unhealthy in it, even though it doesn't! Definitely a favorite.

I made this recipe.  It is first very time consuming and expensive.  Can anyone say Pizza night?  I am sorry it was just not for us.  I did manage to salvage the quinoa and garnish.  Mixed those two ingredients together which were very tasty, but the soup will be thrown out.  From now on, I will make sure I prepare a recipe that has been reviewed more prior to spending so much cash and effort.
