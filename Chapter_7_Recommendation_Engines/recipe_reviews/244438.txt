YUM, I tried a peanut butter version of this from Pinterest and misplaced the recipe. I had to try this one when I found it. I made 1/4 of the recipe or about 4 servings. So, the full recipe is about half the servings suggested. That amount was equivalent to 1/2 cup choc chips and 2 Tblsp + 1 1/2 tsp of coconut oil. I used Ghiradelli mini choc chips, from the freezer, and it took 1 minute to melt stirring half way through. I tried it on top of Edys 1/2 the fat vanilla bean ice cream. It set up very quickly. It doesnt crack, but it does solidify. I cant imagine why anyone would buy the stuff in a bottle with the ease and taste of this. Edit Note: I didn't store it at room temperature as suggested. I put it in the fridge. To re-melt it, I put it back in the microwave for 1 minute stirring half way through. As it wasn't as warm as when just made it did actually crack into a few pieces, after it set for a minute or so, if that is desired.

I love this recipe!!! I was making a experiment with cookies and I wanted a chocolate coating. I tried melting chocolate and failed miserably. It tasted really burnt something. So I tried this recipe.  added a little sugar because my family has a sweet tooth and it tasted even better. I would DEFINITELY make this again! The only thing I hoped was a little different, is that it would harden on warm surfaces too.

A dream come true! Thank you so much for submitting this amazing recipe. Magic Shell was a childhood favorite of mine. I had bought some a couple years ago and it was so difficult to get out of the bottle I gave up on ever thinking it could be a possibility again. I quartered the recipe which gave us just enough for 3 servings. 1/2 c.  Chocolate Chips, 1/2 of a 1/3 c coconut oil. (Specifically-filled a 1/3 measuring cup halfway). Took under 3 mins of my time and was a perfect shell!

The first time I did this it was to top cherry flavoured ocing so I added a some marachino cherry juice.  The next time I did it as directed.  It was wonderful both ways.

So much better than store bought. I'll use it all the time now. Add a splash of vanilla for a change.

This is FANTASTIC! I have now tried two variations. One where I spin 1/4 c of walnuts in the food processor until just more than fine and the same thing with hazelnuts. Stirring in these at the very end gave an AMAZING flavor. Simply put over vanilla (cheapo type from Costco) ice cream! 

P. S. I have learned that making a decision milkshake until fully blended and the adding this special sauce as the blender is on low creates a super special treat!
