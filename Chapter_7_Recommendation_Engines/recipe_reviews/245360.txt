These were good and easy to make.  The instructions are lacking and need to be clarified.  It doesn't say how much butter to cook them in nor does it tell you how much oil to add to them. I googled this recipe and found it on another site and made the additions as necessary.  Hopefully the recipe will be updated, other than that they were very good.

Working with the sticky dough is tricky. I had a very difficult time transferring the risen dough to the skillet - they stuck to the baking mat, despite having used a lot of cornmeal.   The finished English muffins tasted fine, but they were a little too messy.  Overall, these were OK but I don't think I would use this method again.

Hello, Chef John! This muffin recipe is OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I made it on a Monday and doubled the recipe. By the end of the day, the entire family had ate it! Every single one! It was soooooo good! We had it with a bit of homemade peanut butter and strawberry jam. So delicious I had to hide it outside so they wouldn't eat it all but they did. I would really recommend it and I definitely will make it again. I love it with all my heart!

Wow, really nails the english muffin experience. I made it exactly as per the recipe. The only thing I had trouble with was the cook time. I burned the first two and filled the house with smoke by following the directions and leaving it as long as stated on each side, so on the last four I turned the heat down quite a bit (to medium low) and left them maybe 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Those turned out perfectly. I might try this again if I'm in the mood to risk setting off the smoke detectors again. ;-)

I kept the the ingredients the same, just changed the method a little.  The dough is truely like glue and adding flour to my hands and work surface didn't help this at all. I ended up using a spoon to pour them pancake-style onto a generous amount of cornmeal (okay, I did use about a 1/4 cup) while using a second spoon to help it along. This worked very well. Despite not being able to hand-form them, they did become English muffins. After letting them rest for 90 minutes before cooking, they were dry on the outside and full of lovely air pockets, like I hoped. They were easy to handle with a spatula and came out crispy outside and the right texture and taste inside. Thank you for a baking success (rare for me).

did not change a thing, tat would not be fair to the original recipe. I have made several different recipes over the years, I found cooking slowly in butter low heat  5 minutes on each side first then set the the timer to 3 minuets to finish . let cool first and use a fork don't cut with a knife my wife has been the test dummy over 40 years and she loves it.

Turned out great. Only thing I did differently was I let it rise overnight since I started the batter late and didnâ€™t want to stay up. Cooking tip, i used a coal as well as a standard frying pan Both cast iron. But the frying pan cooked much nicer I start using the comal. I think that the comal is thinner so they browned way too fast and got a little burnt. So much better than store bought.

Thank you for yes indeed, EASY and tasty !  Next time I think I will try to make 7or  8 as they were large and of course I had to eat the whole thing !! Thanks for sharing!  I like the idea of adding cinnamon and raisins for another reviewer too !!
