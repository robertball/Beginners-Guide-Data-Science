This is very easy to make, as promised, and is not "bad", but is kind of bland "as is".  I can make the following suggestions:  first, double the amount of eggs stated from 4 to 8.  "Eight is enough!"  (Ok, I'm sorry, that was cheesy.)  :)  Speaking of cheese - use sharp cheddar, more than what she recommends (a cup, also, doesn't appear to be substantial enough) and don't add it until maybe the last 20-25 minutes or so.  If you leave it on the entire time it gets really dry and too crispy, almost burned in places.  You want it to be nice and melty, not dried out.  Thirdly - more is needed to give the dish some oomph.  I would recommend doing any of the following:  tossing in some chopped green pepper to the onion/mushroom mixture, adding some Tabasco sauce to the egg mixture, or topping with pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar (and again - only during the last 20 minutes!).

I made this dish for an Easter brunch with my husband and my parents - all ate their portions, but they all gave me suggestions as to how this could be better the second time around.

I also have to say that using Oscar Meyer pre-cooked bacon saves LOADS of time and doesn't leave your whole house smelling of bacon grease!  My parents also suggested that you could use ground sausage, spicy or non-spicy, or perhaps some cubed ham (as other members have suggested) instead of the bacon.

I hope my suggestions have helped!  Again, this is not a bad recipe, just needs some tweeking.

This is a good breakfast recipe but I'm not sure if the presentation is so appealing (minor flaw).  I layer per directions and noticed my top was cooking faster than the bottom.  By the end, the top was beyond done while the bottom was somewhat mushy.  It still had a good taste and the second time I made it, I mixed it all together.  Solidified better and blended well.  I also added sauted green bell peppers, used sharp cheddar cheese, 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 cup of chopped ham and 6 eggs instead of 4.  Second time was a charm.

My family really enjoyed this for breakfast.  I would recommend adding 2 more eggs, covering and baking for 45 minutes instead of 1 hour.  I also used full pkg of shredded cheese on top.  The house smelt wonderful and my family was delighted with their full tummies.  Thanks!

I too made a few changes and it turned out great!I used 6 eggs, 1 can cream mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, only 1 cup milk and 2 cups cheddar. I also used only 1/2 Lb bacon. Layer 1/2 potatoe and veggie mixture, then all of cheese then remaining potatoes. This will keep cheese from getting hard and crusty. Mix all of liquid ingredients well and pour over top. Liquid should cover potatoes.  I baked in 7 x 11 glass casserole dish. A smaller pan will also keep it from getting too dry. 375 for 45 min then top with French's Onions last few minutes of baking time. Great Mother Day brunch!

This was very good!  I made a few adjustments to the recipe.  I reduced the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  I used thick-sliced pepper bacon, which I cut into 1-inch pieces before cooking, so the bacon could be evenly distributed.  Be sure to drain fat between frying batches of bacon, so your bacon will be crispy.  To save time, I used an 8-oz. package of sliced fresh mushrooms.  I also deleted the 1Tablespoon of butter used to saut√© the onions and mushrooms, and cooked them in 1 Tablespoon of bacon grease.  I increased the eggs to 6.  I did cover and refrigerate overnight.  My casserole was cooked in 45 minutes.  Thanks Pam for sharing!  I will definitely cook again.

Excellent!  Everyone enjoyed this when I made it for Christmas morning!  It was so easy with most of the prep done the night before, so I was able to spend the morning with my family instead of in the kitchen.  I used more eggs than the recipe called for (I used 6 or 8... I can't remember because it was a couple of months ago), and I omitted the mushrooms because we don't care for them.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use less salt (maybe eliminate the plain salt and only use the garlic salt and maybe a little seasoned salt)- it was plenty salty with the bacon.  Really almost too salty.  But still good!  I will definitely make this again!  Oh, it was very good leftover, too!

The recipe only calls for 4 eggs, and they act as more of a binding agent than an element of flavor. I add 2 to 4 more eggs to include all the tastes of a great breakfast. A little greasy and fattening, but always gets rave reviews! Perfect for a once-a-year special breakfast.

Made this for Christmas morning; it was easy to prepare and tasted GREAT!  We used Tony Chachere's seasoning since my family likes our food spicy and we used precooked bacon to save time.  We also mixed up the potatoes, bacon, onion and mushrooms as suggested.  The only change I would make next time is to add the extra couple of eggs as suggested by others.  Will definately be making this again!!

Delicious!  Nice alternative to the usual sausage breakfast casseroles.  I added 10 eggs instead of the 4 as I wanted mine more eggy.  I also added a little red pepper for color.  Good leftovers.

It was delicious! So nice to get up Christmas morning and really not have to cook, just throw it in the oven.  I used the hash browns with the peppers and onions already in it and it make it faster. Thanks for sharing!

I placed this recipe here several years ago.  For some reason it was changed to state thawed hash browns.  I never thaw the hash browns first but I always make the evening before, refrigerate and bake the next day.

I cook this every year.  I make it the day before. Fantastic to be able to drink mamosas and relax opening gifts with family while breakfast cooks.  More eggs for sure, at least 8...and more cheese too.  I add both ham and pre-cooked bacon.  Maybe some biscuits with honey would be a good side to this casserole...Try this and you will never make a messy xmas breakfast again where you would be stuck in the kitchen the entire morning again!

I found this recipe on this website about 6 years ago.  I have been making it on Christmas Eve to have Christmas morning ever since. We all love it. Do not be afraid of all the onions in it. They add an almost caramel sweetness to the dish once they are sauteed in the butter and soaked overnight and then baked.  The only thing I have done different over the years is substitute sausage or ham for the bacon.  It just depends what we are in the mood for that year.  But I definitely give this five stars!  Thank you for adding to our Christmas tradition.

I made this Christmas morning, I followed Kate's recommendations from her review on 12/10/06; with only a few modifications.  I used red and green bellpepper for the Christmas theme, I precooked the bacon, the onions and bellpeppers the day before.  On Christmas morning I warmed them up, I had put the hash browns in the refrigerator the night before to thaw  and then compiled all according to the recipe.  I didn't use the dill.  Since I doubled the recipe, I still only used one large onion and 1/2 red and 1/2 green large bellpepper.  I did substitue heavy cream for 1/2 the milk and added in about 21 eggs.  Since it was doubled, I cooked it at 375 degrees for 1 hr 15 mins., adding the cheese the last 25 minutes.  Check it frequently and cover for the first half of the cooking time with foil.

Everyone gave rave reviews about it.  I found the posted reviews very helpful and gave me confidence to try this with 15 guests and no doing a sample test.  

I presented it in a large Chrismtas casserole and it was not only delicious, it had a great presentation.

I'm really surprised at all the high reviews on this recipe.  There are much better breakfast casserole recipes out there.  I agree with other reviewers, though, that this recipe needs more flavor and eggs.  If I ever make it again I will double the eggs, add more seasoning (I did use tabasco sauce as another reviewer stated, but it still needs more flavor) and mix the ingredients together better before cooking.  Otherwise, if you follow the directions, the bacon and eggs don't really mix in with the hash browns enough to give them flavor and the bottom portion of the casserole tastes really bland.

I thought this was good, but a little dry.  Will top with cheese next time.  I sprinkled it with ground ancho pepper powder, gave it a really nice color!  Also added thyme to the eggs.  We made half with sausage and bacon, and the other half with sausage, onions, and mushrooms.  Also layered half of potatoes first, then meat/veggies/cheese, then rest of potatoes.  Also used 9 eggs.

Forget just for Christmas, this is great for anytime.  I love something I can prepare one day and finish the next because of my work schedule, and this fits that bill.  The only changes I made were leaving out the onions (we don't do onions) and once I didn't have hashbrowns,  so I used tator-tots, and that is what we prefer now.

I made this on Christmas Eve and served it Christmas day. I omitted the mushrooms (not a family favorite). I think next time I make this I will use pre-cooked bacon. That was alot of bacon to fry up on Christmas Eve. I think I will continue to make this every year for our family though, it was gone by the time we were done opening gifts!!! Thanks

this was ok, but i was not overly impressed with it. it was sort of bland. i did make some changes as suggested by others. i cut up the bacon into small pieces and fried it. i also only used about 3/4 of the package. i mixed the hashbrowns, bacon, onions, and mushroom together and then dumped the egg mixture on top. i used 6 eggs. it really needs more than the four called for.  i used fresh parsley as i has some.  i did not use the garlic salt and maybe that made the difference with it being bland.  i don't know for sure. i think maybe if i had made this with ham or even sausage it would have  had more flavor. i will say when i had leftovers the next day it did seem a little better than when we first ate it.  i may try this again with a different variation of ingredients to see if i can get a better flavor.

What a fantastic dish.  I've had it with many different variations but all of them following the basic premise of the recipe and all of them delicious.  When I make it I skip the mushrooms and use some red and green peppers instead to add to the Christmas theme.  I also mix it all up as others have suggested and add the cheese near the end of baking.

This was very good.  I prefer hash brown potatoes with fresh peppers instead of O'Brien potatoes.  I took the advise of other reviews and increased the eggs to at least 5 and used 1 cup of cheese.  This can be a bit dry on the bottom so I sauted the mushrooms, onions, peppers then put in 1/2 the potatoes with the seasonings and 1/2 of the vegetables. Then add the rest.  Add the cheese to the last 15 min of baking.

My family loved this casserole Christmas morning!  It's very fast and easy to make!  Next time, I'll use diced ham instead of bacon.  I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in olive oil and garlic.  Delicious!

This is a good recipe although I did change some things, so the rating is with my changes. Going by other suggestions I used 8 eggs and only one cup of milk. I also sauteed half a red pepper and half a green pepper (dice small) with the diced onion (but left out the mushrooms because I don't care for them). I used Crystal Farms O'Brien Hash Browns (in the refrigerator section, not frozen). I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I mixed the salt, garlic powder and black pepper with the hash browns, then placed in the greased dish, and layered as the recipe states. I baked it for one hour, but next time I will check it sooner (it was a little brown around the edges). Another thing I really liked is I was able to cook the bacon, and sauteed the onion and peppers two days before (kept it cold) and then put it all together on Christmas (didn't have time x-mass eve). This recipe does have a lot of flavor, and was hardy meal my family and I enjoyed on Christmas morning. I'm sure I will be making this again.

This is an awesome recipe! I had one like this a long time ago, but lost it.  I did not use the mushrooms, as no one in my family likes them, and instead of Bacon, I used sausage.  What flavor!!!! This Christmas I will be making 2. One with sausage the other with diced ham.  

We will def. be adding this to our traditional Christmas morning breakfast. I can make it the night before, and put it in the oven in the morning, and when the kids are done with presents they have a warm breakfast that I didn't have to slave over.

Thanks for sharing!!!

It was good.  I made the mistake of draining all of the fat.  Next time, I will leave some.  I would probably add a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Otherwise, great and easy!

Maybe just omitted, but I would drain off most of the fat after browning 1 pound of bacon.  Otherwise, really greasy.  Delicious

Changed the recipe a quite a bit, but was a great base recipe.  Very easy to substitute ingredients to your liking.  Used 9 eggs, potatoes O'brien, 1/2 cup chopped jalapeno pepper, 1/2 cup cup-up tomato, 1 lb sausage, and about 3/4 lb chopped ham. Left out the salt.  Left out the onion and mushrooms, as was in too much of a hurry to prepare and cook them. Did add some dry onion to the egg mixture.  Layered it as suggested by a reviewer--1/2 potatoes on the bottom, covered with the cheese, meat, vegetable mixture, and topped with the rest of the potatoes. Baked it the same day.  Then sprinkled about 3/4 cup shredded cheese on top, 10 minutes before it was done.  Looked very nice when cut with the layers.  Very presentable with the cheese topping.  Very filling and delicious.

Tried this today for Christmas morning and it was great! I used a pint of whipping cream in place of milk and of course more cheese is always good!  I sauted my mushrooms and onions in butter (yum!) and used bacon and ham as well.  Definitely double the eggs!  i did and it was perfect!  I took the recommendation to cook it covered for 1/2 hour and then cooked uncovered the last 15 min.  i wish i had taken a picture!  it was gorgeous! but they ate it all too fast!  this is a great recipe to make your own little changes to and it's still great! thanks for the recipe! Plano TX Lady. :-)

I followed the advice of various other reviewers plus made a few little  changes myself when making this recipe, and it turned out great! I assembled and baked this recipe all at the same time, and did not refridgerate overnight. I baked it at 375 degrees for just over an hour, and covered it for about the first 30 minutes. I did not put the cheese on until the last 20 minutes. In place of the mushrooms and bacon, I used 2 red bell peppers and ham, and substitued 1/2 cup of heavy cream for a 1/2 c. of the milk. I used one instead of two onions, and I also used 7 eggs rather than 4 and added some dill with the salts and pepper. I don't think this recipe would earn a 5 star rating if the instructions are followed, but with these changes, it's great and I will definitely be making it again.

This was a huge hit Christmas morning.  I made the recipe the night before, using 8 eggs instead of four, and I broke the bacon into bite sized pieces.  I stirred everything together, so nothing would burn.  I baked it for an hour, and added the cheese at about 40 minutes.  One tip is to REALLY grease the casserole dish first, because the cheese and potatoes make a sticky mess if you don't.

Very Good but.... 400 is too high if you use a glass caserole pan, I did and it was a overcooked. The bacon cooked too much and lost it's flavor. Love the ingredients though. I will lower temp to 375 and might even cook for a shorter time. Took it to our church get together and they seemed to like it so I will keep this one mainly because I love Bacon!!!

I made this as posted on Christmas Eve for Christmas brunch. The entire casserole is bland and dry.  It needs more seasoning and maybe twice as many eggs.  This is a decent base recipe but will be making adjustments in the future.

This was a good starter recipe for a breakfast casserole that doesn't use bisquick. I used 8 eggs and sweet Italian sausage, no mushrooms but red and green onions, and mixed the hashbrowns in with the eggs and sausage instead of layering. Still used the same amount of milk, but added spices ad seasonings our family likes, red pepper flakes, onion and garlic powder/salt, Italian seasonings, etc. We never really go by the spice amounts on any recipes, just what we are feeling at the time. I reduced the heat to 350, covered for thirty min, added 2 cups cheese and baked uncovered for 30 more min, and it was perfectly cooked, all bubbly and browned on top. Very yummy and easy to prepare Christmas Eve. Got to enjoy a great hot breakfast Christmas morning without spending it in the kitchen!

I have been making this recipe for the last three to four years. My family absolutley loves it. The ONLY change I make is to cut the bacon up before frying it. It is perfect the way it is!

We really like this recipe! I have made it at Christmas the past few years and there's never any leftovers! Rather than layering the ingredients, I mix the mushrooms, onions and potatoes together. It's quick and easy and is very filling. I'd reccommend giving it a try- you won't be sorry!

This was a very tasty Christmas morning breakfast.  I used the following suggestions from other reviewers:  I used O'Brien potatoes, pre-cooked bacon (zapped in microwave for a few seconds for crispness)used 6 eggs instead of 4 (will try 8 next time) and increased the cheese amount to 2C.  I also used real garlic powder and then added regular salt.  I think this helped the flavor.  I put this in the crockpot before church and cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours.  It was ready as soon as we walked in the door.  The flavor was great and big hit with the family and Christmas company.  Will be a Christmas tradition from now on.  Thanks!

This was great the first day but Somewhat dry when re-heated for the next. Mind you I make a casserole on Sunday and take it to work for breakfast all week long. Will try to add some cream soup on the bottom on the casserole to help the potatoes -- but awesome flavor and loved all the veggies -- hubby enjoyed :-)

This was a wonderful recipe. Much better than the brunch casserole with bread.  My family loved it. I made one without onions and added more mushrooms and peppers and one as directed. Both were delicious. You could certainly adjust the recipe as desired (more mushrooms, onions etc.)

YUMMY & EASY!! We had brunch on Christmas and all the family LOVED IT!! I used sausage and 8 eggs, no mushrooms. I put the hashbrowns on the bottom and mixed the rest together like others suggested. We will have this again and again. Not just for Christmas.

This was a Christmas breakfast disapointment!  I made it just like the recipe said and the cheese came out too dry and overall this dish very boring.  I made this dish for company but was too embarrassed to serve it.  If I were to try this recipe again I would use about 1/2 the potatoes and double the amount of eggs and onion.  I would also mix the cheese into the mixture instead of adding it to the top.  Definately try this recipe before serving to guests!

I made this for the morning after a New Years party knowing that no one was going to want to cook for a house full of company. I will now make this anytime I have family over for holidays!!!! My only mistake was I did not thaw the has browns which (like it clearly says to) so there was a bit too much liquid.

I assembled this on Christmas Eve as suggested. In the morning I just put it in the oven while we opened presents. The whole house smelled like I was slaving away in the kitchen, and I wasn't. YAY!

I doubled the amount of eggs to 8. I put the cooked bacon in a baggie and sprinkled it on top before I baked the casserole...I was worried that the bacon would get soggy, which I HATE. My oldest son, 19, said in the middle of breakfast, "This should have bacon all the way through." LOL. 

It's definitely a keeper, and I plan on making it again for Easter Breakfast.

Ehh. I'll use the hashbrown technique again. This was pretty good but wouldn't want to serve it to company because it wasn't very attractive. Next time I'll probably only use one onion and add green bell pepper and leave the mushrooms out. Sorry to be negative!

Best Christmas casserole I have ever tried.  I love texture the hashbrowns give the casserole. In the past, I used crescent rolls and they always burned. I also double the eggs & add a jalepeno or two.  I fry bacon and crumble in the mixture. I also adda pound of spicy sausage.  It is only Christmas once a year:o) I mix a bit of cheese in the casserole while it is cooking, but then I add the rest to the top towards the end. This is a family tradition. I make it the night before and just pop it in the oven in the morning.  YUMMY!!!!

I used sausage instead of bacon (hubby's preference) & added chorizo & bell peppers.  I used 5c hash browns, 3c shredded cheddar & 8 eggs & seasoned all with salt & pepper.  I baked 50 minutes covered and another 20 uncovered.  I ended up smothering each serving with New Mexico hot red chile & hubby said he wouldn't have liked it without the chile because it wouldn't have had enough flavor as written. Great concept.  I'll have to play around with it!

I always make this when I have lots of people over for brunch.  They always go back for seconds.  If I don't have hashbrowns, I use crostini's. They are like  little bagettes that are tosted with olive oil and garlic-- they are premade in a bag.  Just one single layer at the bottom of the dish is all that is needed.  Yummy.

I loved this!  I didn't have bacon so I used country ham (very salty!) I left out the salt in the recipe and forgot to put in the parsley. I also used the Country style hash brown potatoes with onions and peppers and used a little more cheese...it smelled wonderful and tasted great.  Very easy to make!

I made this on Christmas Eve day and took it to my family's Christmas morning.  It cooked while we opened presents and it was a joy to have that aroma in the house while we finished our gifts!  I mixed it all together like was previously suggested, adding 2 more eggs and more cheese.  It came out beautifully and my very picky and opinionated family loved it, even my 4 yr old who doesn't like anything mixed together! I was asked to add this recipe to our traditional christmas breakfast every year! I will double the recipe and still add 3-4 more eggs next year!

This was delicious! I threw it together the day before Christmas in a 6 qt electric roaster (the pan came out and went in the fridge).  Christmas morning, I got up, plugged the roaster in, and it was ready to serve in an hour.  It got rave reviews and kept me from having to prepare a big breakfast on Christmas morning, which allowed me to spend more time with my family. It will definitely be a family favorite.

when our family of 17 decided to do a brunch for Crhistmas,
 I decided not to work too hard. This recipe is so easy and tasty. 
 Plan to combine the ingredients the day before,then relax the next morning
 while the wonderful aroma fills the kitchen. My grown sons loved the new recipe. 
 And teir wives asked for a copy of it.  All 9 small children liked it also. 
 My 2 yr.old helped layer the dish the night before. I'm sure this won't be saved
for just the holidays.

This dish was very tasty. I made it for my family for Christmas breakfast and they loved it. Some of our guests arrived early for Christmas dinner so I offered them a taste of it to tie them over until dinner. When they were getting leftovers the guy asked me for some of that "great breakfast dish" to take too. My husband doesn't like mushrooms so I subsitituted one 10oz box of frozen spinach for them. It was wonderful. I cooked my bacon really crisp but it was still kinda limp when it was all done. Just a heads up. It did not detract from the dish at all!

So I chose this recipe because my daughter has a gluten intolerance and this is actually gluten free... Don't be fooled by my rating. This is a great recipe and very delicious but it needs lots of adjustments. Instead of bacon I used ground sausage (we just like it more). There wasn't much egg to it, so next time I will use 6 instead of 4. I also added a diced green bell pepper and about 4 green onions sliced and sprinkled just beneath the cheese. A cup of cheese wasn't quite enough either so I would make it about 1 1/2 cups instead next time. Everything else about this recipe is great. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again with the adjustments.

This a a great basic recipe.  I doubled the eggs as suggested by others, and generously seasoned the hash brown potatoes (which were basically chopped raw potato) before layering up the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I ran the cooked bacon through the food processor, so it was chopped super fine. I added the cheese half way through cooking, otherwise it would have been burnt. It did not take one hour to cook, more like 45 min.  I took it to work for a brunch, everyone loved it!

I used fresh potatoes, more eggs, less milk, and more cheese. I still thought this could use some more flavoring. Overall it was satisfying but next time I'd add some more spices or cheese liven up that much potatoes! Thanks for sharing.

This was good and would have been better if I had actually watched it so it did not brown so much.  It would be less cooking time for me next time.  But it was tasty.  I made it as written and had no problems with it being dry.  Also I did not let it sit overnight but just threw it in the oven.  It turned out fine.  I also used 8 eggs instead of the 4.

Delicious!! I made some strata from this site at Thanksgiving. This recipe was preferred by every member of my family!
We don't like spicy food, especially for breakfast, and since the potatoes I used were already somewhat spiced I sprinkled onion powder on the hash browns and omitted the onion. Added a box of Jones precooked breakfast sausage chopped with the bacon. Took other suggestions and used 8 extra large eggs, but just 1 cup of milk. I put 1/4 cup of the cheese in with the eggs, and put the rest on top 20 minutes before taking the dish out of the oven.
It wasn't too wet, or too dry- what we call a "goldilocks" meal. Served with fruit salad and a sour cream coffee cake. Yum!
I didn't get a chance to put this in the frig the night before, so cooking time was about 40 minutes.
Wow, wow, wow- this is one my husband said to put in my recipe file- high praise, indeed! Even my picky teenage daughters loved it.
Thanks so much for posting this delightful, easy recipe!

Great flavor.  Found that the ingredients were too much for one pan, so I added extra egg mixture and made two pans.

I used the frozen hash brown patties.  I added the cheese 20 minutes befor it was done.  This is a keeper. Lefty7

This is a flexible casserole!  There was no bacon in the pantry, but there was a 3 oz package of proscuito! Added one onion, the mushrooms, 2 cups hash browns, no salt, tarragon, parsley, garlic powder and plain soy milk!

This was excellent with a few changes.  I added some chopped green pepper and minced garlic to the saute mixture.  Increased the eggs to 6, plus added some dry mustard and used sharp cheddar.  I have a similar recipe that calls for the casserole to cook at 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. This seeemed to work well so the top didn't get too brown and it was done to perfection all the way through. By the way, your house will smell AMAZING while this is cooking!

I used this recipe as a basis and made a few changes to suit our tastes and based on other reviews.  I added red bell pepper just for a bit of color, used 8 eggs, substitued fat-free half & half for the milk and tried pepper jack cheese for a bit of zip.  My son and our guest said it was awesome.  I highly recommend using this recipe as a starting point and have fun making changes to suit your own tastes and preferences.

Delicious after my *minor* alterations. I halved the recipe, yet used a total of 6 eggs. I added chopped green and red bell pepper with the saute mix, as well as a dash or two of chili powder to the egg mix. Finally, I mixed the bacon with the veggies, then layered the cheese, then poured on the egg. I needed the full hour at 400 for it to set. Thanks for this decadent breakfast!

Everyone loved it!  I left out the mushrooms and used 8 eggs.  I didn't layer... I mixed the first ingredients together then poured the egg mixture over it all.  I added the cheese during the last 20 minutes.  I particularly liked being able to put it all together the night before. It's a winner!

Needs more eggs for sure.  I made it with ham and bacon, mixed in some of the cheese with eggs and then added more cheese on top the last 20 mins.  Definitely use pepper or a little cayenne pepper for flavor.

This was a hit with the family. I am not a huge fan of onions so there were too many in the dish for my taste, but my husband loved them. I took the advice of others and added two extra eggs. I had to foil the dish about 20 minutes into cooking because the cheese was burning. Next time I will wait until nearer the end of baking time to add the cheese.

really really like this. i read through all the reviews and did changes. here are my changes: decreased potatoes a little, decreased milk to one cup, decreased onion to one, omitted salt, used garlic powder instead of salt. i mixed the cheddar with the eggs and stirred the whole thing a little. today i sauteed some fresh asparagus in with the mushrooms and onions and it was soooooo good.
the potatoes come out soggy, and i don't know why. next time i'm going to eliminate the milk altogether.
anyway, i love this recipe. i want to give it a mexican flair, use green chiles. i always put some cholula sauce on when i eat it, too.

Fantastic!!!!  We brought this to work for a group breakfast and wow!!!  Rave reviews!  We increased the eggs to 8 and decreased the onions to 1.  Didn't have any parsley and used shredded hashbrowns.  Also used 2 cups of cheese.  Yummy!!!!

I made this for a breakfast potluck at work and it was a hit!  I did use 6 eggs, put the cheddar on for the last 20 min only, replace onions with green onions, and use fried and drained ground pork sausage instead of bacon.  Will use it for Christmas morning , very handy.

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast. Only two of us, so I scaled it down to 9 servings instead of 12 and baked it in an 8 x 8 pan. I followed the recipe except I substituted pork sausage for the bacon. It was pretty good, and I can see lots of room for variations on this theme. The only thing I didn't care for is that the potatoes were mushy by the time it was done. Next time I think I'll try leaving the potatoes frozen or partially frozen when I start it. Try this one for an easy and tasty breakfast.

I made this recipe Christmas Eve night for breakfast Christmas morning and everyone in my family loved it! Even my father who is a picky eater couldn't stop talking about it. It's now a tradition that I make this dish every Christmas morning. I did change the recipe a little. I added chopped up maple links, 6 more eggs, maple flavored bacon, and took out the mushrooms. I was finally able to enjoy Christmas with everyone else and not be stuck in the kitchen cooking all morning. It was simple to make and tasted great, thanks for the great recipe!!!

Simplified this by using the Oscar Mayer pre-cooked, bagged bacon - and put it in the crockpot on high for 2 1/2 hours.  used only 1/2 the milk stated.   DEEELISH !!!!
Kids and all ate every bit !  Perfect for a Sunday morning - turn crock pot on before church, and off you go !  Ready upon your return.
Add a favorite baked good, juice/tea/coffee -
and you have easy entertaining !

I took tips from several reviews and added 2 eggs. I increased fluid by adding 1 can mushroom soup-one with roasted garlic, then omitted the garlic in the recipe and cut back fresh mushroom, and then doubled the cheese. I used diced potato instead of schreaded, bacon bits instead of fried, and cooked 30 min. at 350, covered, and uncovered 15 min. at 375. It was wonderful. A little salsa on top for those who enjoy spicier flavor. My rating would have been 5, if so much alteration hadn't been necessary.

My whole family loves this recipe. I made it as a trial run before Xmas morning, and it made a great fast supper. My husband usually made breakfast on Xmas Day and it is hard to have everyone's eggs and toast/bacon ready at the same time. This year he wanted to do this and asked me to help him prepare the night before. He is not a cook but I told him he can do this anytime now that I have showed him!! We had 8 for breakfast on Xmas morning and their only negative comment was "Why did you not make more?" Will make many times throughout the year. Thanks very much.

quick and easy.  Family liked it but prefer the recipe similar to this using bread slices instead of potatoes.  As for the limp bacon, I put it on top of the cheese as the last ingredient and the bacon cooks up much nicer, don't even have to cook it first.

I made this for the first time last week and doubled the batch, as I expected a whole hoard of family on Christmas morning.  They went crazy over it--and I don't get some of the previous reviewers who said the bacon didn't get cooked enough.  I made sure I fried it crispy to begin with before even putting it in the casserole.  I was afraid there would be too much saltiness with the bacon and the garlic salt, but the double batch of ingredients probably alleviated that.  I doubled everything precisely, except added extra pepper.  Nuthin left!

This is a great "starting point" for this casserole. I made a few simple changes and it turned out perfectly. I used the already cooked bacon and just heated it in the microwave to make it crispy.  I used a can of sliced mushrooms and chopped them up a bit. I used 7 eggs instead of 4 and I used more cheese than the original recipe called for. Also, I added about a cup of ham I diced, from the previous nights leftovers. Rather than layering the ingredients, I put the potatoes in a greased dish, mixed everything else together (with a dash of nutmeg) and poured it over the potatoes. I added more cheese on top and baked it until set and browned at 375. Delicious! Everyone from my 1 year old daughter to my forty something husband loved it.

I liked this "as is" but loved it once I made modifications. I feel this is a great "foundation" recipe, so the more or fewer things one adds to personalize the casserole the better. I used one more egg than called for along with egg white; used only half the amount of bacon and substituted sausage, which I cooked with green pepper, onion, and garlic in the bacon grease; added paprika and cayenne pepper; and used both a sharp cheddar and cheddar jack mix. I loved that I can prep this the night before and it still came out great. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was delicious! I increased the eggs to 6 only because I wanted to make sure there was enough to go around. I added a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce just to perk it up a bit but I`m not even sure it made a difference. I know I`ll be asked to make this again.

Absolutely Yummy! My whole family loved it so I will definitely make it again.  I did change it up a little bit.  I used 7 eggs instead of 4 and only 1 cup of milk.  I also used 2 cups cheese.  I think next time I make it I may include sausage or Ortega green chilies.

Superb just as the recipe is!
I made this yesterday evening and we had it this morning and it is delicious.  

The next time I make it, which I will, I am thinking I will chop the bacon before frying.
And also, I will try a method someone else recommended and stir all of the ingredients, except for the cheddar cheese, together in a large bowl versus layering and then put it in the pan/dish and then top with the cheddar cheese.

Seriously folks, try it - you'll like it!

Thank you pamjlee! :o)

I thought this was only ok. But maybe it was because I changed it up. I used turkey breakfast sausage instead of bacon and Obrien potatoes instead of hash browns. I also added a red onion and took other reviewers recommendations on doubling the eggs. It was alright, but it seemed to lack some flavor. Would probably be better with bacon.

I think I would have really liked this recipe but the butter burned on the bottom. I was leary of using butter but I did it anyway and the whole casserole tasted burned. Luckily, it was just my Mom and me and her taste buds aren't that good anymore. I will try it again and will use Crisco.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this casserole. However, I edited a few of the ingredients. I am a pescetarian (the only meet I eat are fish and eggs), so I replaced the bacon with spinach (I did not cook or sautee before putting in casserole). I did what other people have suggested, and added more eggs (7) and more cheese (almost 2 cups). I also used a mexican 4-cheese, to vary it up a little. Also, as suggested by others, I threw a green pepper into the onion and mushroom mix, which I sauteed in olive oil and garlic (I still used the garlic salt, because my boyfriend LOVES garlic and salt!). And instead of the dried parsley, I used rosemary, and more than a pinch. We have a rosemary bush right outside our front door, so it's very convenient (we usually put rosemary in our eggs for breakfast; I would only recommend using rosemary if you know for sure you enjoy it's flavor.) Also as suggested by others, (having refrigerated over night) I baked for a total time of 50 mins on about 375-400 degrees, and added the cheese in the last 20-25 mins. Hope this helps, or at least gives you some ideas of your own!

Really tasty.  Loved the ideas that c-jay provided with more eggs and cream of mushroom soup.  I did not have onion, so I used a cup and a half chopped celery and half cup garlic chives.  Good base recipe.

Delicious! I felt like it needed just a bit more moisture, as the hashbrown part was a little dry. But the flavor was wonderful. Maybe an additional egg would do the trick.

It gets all stars for ease and taste.  I used hasbrowns with the onions and peppers in the mix and added the onions called for in the recipe and skipped the mushrooms.  Super yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

Exellent! I added an extra egg and it come out fabulous.  I also thinly sliced 2 tomatoes and layed them on the tol of the casserole before baking.  It looked great!  My family typically does not like casseroles and they loved this one.

This was PERFECT for Christmas morning!  Love that you prepare it the night before!  The only changes I made were adding more hash browns and omitting the mushrooms (dont care for them).  I also sauteed the onions in the bacon grease which added much needed flavor!  Next time I will break up the bacon to distribute it more evenly as it was a pain to cut with a fork.  Will be making again and again!

This breakfast casserole was delicious.  Next time I make it I will put the hash browns in the bottom of a dish with a little butter and bake it for a few minutes, just to get it to crisp up a little.  Also, I will not let it sit overnight.  Adding some fresh herbs will help add a little more flavor too.

I had my family over for Christmas Brunch, my grandmother says she hates egg casseroles, but she tried this one.  She loved it!!  My only suggestion would be to season the potatoes before putting them in!!  Salt, pepper, and a bit of garlic was nice!

This was a great dish, nice and hearty!!  Everyone loved it, it is perfect for a large group.  I followed the recipe with the exception of no mushrooms, extra eggs, and that I mixed everything together as opposed to layering!  Excellent :-)

Absolutely delicious!!! This was very easy to make and so nice in the morning to wake up and just put in the oven. My husband and I love this dish! Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I didn't use mushrooms because my husband hates them.  Here is what I used, spicy thawed hasbrowns(1 bag of Simply Potatoes, bacon, breakfast sausage (cooked and crumbled), onions, shredded cheddar cheese.  I didn't really follow the measurements on the recipe for the seasoning, but gently sprinked over the hashbrowns in the dish.  I also added an extra egg (recipe called for 4 and I used 5...will probably add an extra egg or two next time).  Next time I will try also adding chopped green peppers, chopped jalapeno peppers, and maybe a few tomatoes

I made this recipe for Christmas morning and it was a huge hit!  I served it after opening presents and it was gone before I knew it.  I have already had requests to make it again.  Next time I will omit the salt.  I thought it was a little on the salty side.  I also left the bacon in strips, I should have chopped it up.  This recipe is an absolute keeper!!!

This was nice for Christmas morning...only having to pop it into the oven. Be prepared, it makes a 9x13 pan and it is pretty heavy~ you don't eat too much at once. Would be great for a crowd.

I used quite a few suggestions from other reviewers. I used 6 eggs and kept the hashbrowns frozen and used sausage instead of bacon and also 2 cups of cheese added the last 20 minutes of baking I used a glass pan and decreased oven temp to 375 and baked for one hour.  The casserole was ok, the hashbrowns were mushy and it was thinner than I expected, maybe it was due to all the changes but I don't think so.  Will have to keep looking for a breakfast casserole recipe.

Although this TASTES great and is easy to make, I morally could not make and serve it again.  With 75 grams of fat and over 1200 mg of sodium, I can't subject my loved ones' hearts and arteries to such abuse.  Even for a once-in-a-while treat, it's a little too much.  Yummy but dangerous :-)

I used this recipe as a ruff guide.  I had a lot of poeple so i used a whole bag of tater tots instead of hash browns, a dozen eggs, and sausage instead of bacon.  the green pepers and mushrooms were also vetoed.  It still turned out very good

As often happens on allrecipes, the reviews have evolved the original recipe to something almost in recognizable from the original.  If you make the recipe exactly as outlined above, you will have a bland pan of soupy veggies seasoned with some meat.  There is too much milk, not enough eggs, and WAY too little seasoning.  Following others' advice I increased the eggs (to 8), then added a tablespoon each of onion powder, garlic powder, a teaspoon of cayenne, and a whole chopped bell pepper.  I also reduced the milk to 1 cup and doubled the cheese to 2 cups.  Then as others did I layered veggies, half the cheese, then the egg mixture, removing from the oven about 20 minutes before it was done and adding the remaining cheese to the top.

The thing is, what I ended up with was tasty but almost nothing like the original!  It's a good recipe to tinker with, so I gave it 3 stars, but on its own it rates 1 star.

This was very good. I used turkey bacon and 8 eggs , which seemed just right. I only used one onion, two just seemed like way too much. After buttering the dish, I spread the potatoes on the bottom and baked them until they were slightly crisp. I then added the rest of the ingredients and stirred it all together, as opposed to layering them. It was pretty much perfect, everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe, pamjlee!

This is the second year I've made this for Christmas.  It was a hit both years (with all ages...even my picky 3 year old daughter).  While this did NOT change my rating (this recipe is good, we just found this year with my changes they work better for our family), we added spring onions to add color (and my oldest loves them) I also used 6 eggs.   I put the cheese on the last 15 min of cooking.  That way the cheese was nice and bubbly rather than too crusty.

Tasty and not hard to make. There were no leftovers after brunch and with picky eaters in the house that is a great accomplishment.

This is fantastic!  I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the amount of eggs and omitted the extra salt (it had enough salt from the bacon and from the saut√©ed onions in bacon fat).  We used chopped-style hash browns, but next time we are gong to use tater tots to line the bottom of the pan (mmm tater tots).   40 minutes into baking, I noticed the cheese topping starting to brown- added a foil sheet with holes poked through to prevent further browning.  At the 55 minute mark I removed the foil and added some more cheese.  We then let it set for about 15 minutes before serving.  The leftovers were just as delicious the next day.

I think this was a very delicious casserole, and very easy. I only changed it just a bit after reading reviews and to suit our tastes. I used 8 eggs and about a cup more hashbrowns because I love potatoes. I used 9 slices of bacon. I omitted the onions because no one in my house (except me) enjoys them, and also did not use mushrooms because I had none on hand. However, I do think it would make a nice addition. I had a red bell pepper so I diced half of it up and added it raw where you would add the sauteed mushrooms and onion. I made this on Christmas morning instead of overnight, so I baked at 350 for 45 minutes and added the cheese the last 15 minute so that it was more melty instead of a crust on top. I think this is a great recipe and you can customize it to your liking, much like an omelet. It also warms up nicely for leftovers, a big plus!

Made some adjustments to original recipe. Used eight eggs, mixed everything together, added only the garlic salt and omitted regular salt, thawed hash browns in micro and removed excess moisture. Also I used a mix of cheddar cheese and mozzarella and added french fried onions last five minutes only. This was perfect in appearance and everyone liked it. I also used two generous cups of milk. Perfect.

I found this recipe a few years ago, and have had it in my AllRecipes recipe box ever since... the absolute BEST breakfast casserole-type dish I've ever had.  Savory and yummy without being greasy or bready.  Using the hash browns instead of bread is genious!  The only changes I've ever made is to add some fresh garlic when I saute the mushrooms, and to add a little cayenne to the egg mixture.

Used all the recipe ingredients (added extra eggs), just put them in the pan differently. I layered the hash browns on the bottom of the pan,mixed the remaining ingredients together & poured it over the hash browns. I didn't refridgerate it but baked it right away. This is a keeper!

I liked it, but my husband did not.  He said you could not taste the eggs enough, and this was after adding an additional 2 eggs.  But it was not BAD by any means.

Overall, a nice dish.  The only change I made was using finely diced fresh potatoes as I had no frozen hashbrowns.  Worked out perfectly!  I also used 6 eggs as others suggested and mixed everything together instead of pouring over.  Will make this again for sure.

It's not like this was a bad recipe... it just wasn't out of the world yum.  I wonder what other people added to it to add flavor, but I did find that it lacked flavor and tasted much better when served with salsa.  The only changes I made was to add olives but IF I make it again I would add seasoned salt to the potatos, then add diced green chilis and red peppers or some other veggies, then go without the bacon and substitute ham instead.

This was OK, but not special enough to make again.  Since my son is a vegetarian, I used soy bacon - maybe that made a difference, although no one complained.  It seemed like there were too many potatoes and the egg mixture wasn't enough to soak through them, even though I did assemble the casserole the night before.

This was a great casserole. We made it on Christmas Eve and served it Christmas morning.  So easy and really yummy!  We didn't add bacon to keep it vegetarian.  I can't wait to make this again.

Had this for supper last night and Hubby and I both liked it very much.  I did use much less bacon and halved the recipe for just 2 of us.  I plan to serve it for Christmas Day Brunch for 4 of us.  Will probably use it for a quick supper more often.  Thanks for sharing.

Added later:  served it for Christmas brunch and everyone enjoyed it.  Half recipe served 4 of us.

Super Yummy! I made it for a brunch gathering today. The only changes I made were: used chicken apple sausage in place of bacon, diced potatoes instead of hashbrowns and added 1/2 tsp dry mustard - as someone else suggested. Everyone loved it and was easy to make.

Loved this recipe and so did my family!!! I didn't put mushrooms in it because my daughter-in-law doesn't like them. I didn't make it the night before either just because we were busy Christmas Eve and it turned out great.

Use half the onion, double the eggs, add some extra cheese to the potatoes, and put the cheese on top of the casserole in the last 20 minutes of baking or it will burn. Everyone loved this and even came back for leftovers later in the day!

I made this caserole last year...it was a hit, even with the kids! I've been asked to make it again! It was easy. I took the advise and prepared it the night before. All I had to do the next morning was stick it in the oven!

After the rave reviews of this casserole I was very disappointed in the taste.  I like many others added more eggs than the receipe called for.  I'm very glad that I did that.

I was so excited to try this recipe.  I made it Christmas morning for my family.  It was easy to prepare and sounded wonderful.  I was disappointed in how it tasted though.  It was ok, just not as good as I expected. I would change the bacon to sausage, cut back on onions, and put cheese in the potatoes and on top.

There was not one crumb left of this Christmas morning. Everyone loved it. I was thinking of making it with sausage next time. Loved the hashbrowns instead of bread. Will keep this one on file.

I used some of the suggestions I've seen in previous reviews. I used 350 and it didn't even cook in an hour...so I think the orginal 400 would have been the better idea. I also added more cheese, and used sausage. But it turned out really good, and even my picky parents in-law went back for seconds.

I loved this breakfast casserole. My family ommited the mushrooms. (As much as I would love NOT too.) We also added about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream in place of 1/2 cup of the milk, because we love to add insult to injury. Thanks Pam!

What an excellent time saver recipe!  I made this for my extended family for Christmas morning, and it was a huge hit.  There are bacon and mushroom haters, so I left out the mushrooms and used ham instead of bacon.  I ended up tripling the recipe, and it still disappeared!

Great Recipe! I made it exactly as it was posted except I used O'Brien Hash Brown Poatoes. I did not have to cook it as long either. I used a glass dish so I decreased the temperature to 375degrees and still only had to bake it for 45 minutes. I made it for our New Years Eve Sleepover Party and my guests all loved!! it. I will be making it for many years to come.

This also was for our "morning after" New Years breakfast.  I lowered the temperature and cooked it for a little longer.  It was browning too quickly on the bottom at the higher temperature.  I substituted crumbled sausage for the bacon.  We all liked this!

I loved the ease of this recipe plus the ability to make it a bit more health conscious.  I used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk chedder cheese instead of the two cups called for in the recipe.  I also used turkey bacon instead of bacon.  I made it a bit bigger to serve more people and it worked great.

I made this Christmas Morning.  I used leftover ham from Christmas Eve dinner. I will try with bacon sometime.  I was disapointed there wasnt much egg taste to it.  It was more like cheesy potates, but it was good.

bacon that is not really crispy. It's a big piece

I used the recommendation of others and used 8 eggs, used southern style hashbrowns which already has spicey ingredients, and added the cheese after the egg bake was cooked for 30 minutes and cooked it for another 25-30 minutes with the cheese.  I also made it again the following weekend for my family and friends and everyone absolutely loved it.  It'll be my go-to dish for brunch get-togethers!  Thank you.

This gets rave reviews but I have added my own touches - added fresh spinach - did ground breakfast sausage instead of bacon - for a larger crowd added a few more eggs and extra milk - lots of cheese on top!

Since the bacon has salt, I would omit adding salt. I found it a little too salty. Other than that, was great!

Pretty good recipe- with some adjustments.  After reading lots of reviews,  what needed to be seasoned is the potatoes.  Mixed some of the bacon and cheese and onion/garlic/mushrooms along with seasonings (cooked in bacon fat) in with potatoes before "layering".  I did use 8 eggs instead of 4. Oh,  I added a little (4Tbsp) sour cream into eggs/milk before pouring over potatoes. Update: forgot to include,  baked covered 45 minutes/ uncovered 15 minutes.  (Had already sliced into it :-p)

Great recipe. Easy to make. One caution though is to watch the cooking time. I cooked it fresh for 45 minutes and that was too long. I will be making this again.

I agree that this is a good basic recipe but you can take this in any direction.  I am Italian so for flavor I added fresh garlic, dry oregano and parsley to the mushrooms.  Doubled the eggs and added Romano cheese.   I have also done this like a Taco bake with cilantro, chili peppers and fresh chopped salsa topped with manchego cheese.  Just be creative.  Add what you like!

I made this during Easter week when I had family guests for the week.  Christmas guests asked for a repeat. It was delicious just the way the recipes calls.  This will be my new go to recipe when I need a big breakfast for lots of people with little time spent cooking. I also adjust the servings when it‚Äôs just me.

Was easy and worked great for a do ahead breakfast.  I basically doubled the egg and milk mixture as it barely covered half the dish. I added the extra just before baking as it seemed like even more of the liquid was absorbed over night.  Came out well and would definitely recommend. Family all enjoyed.

I have made this before but not for a while. Before I made it this time for Christmas day I read the reviews and made some additions. I may have used a little bit more hashbrowns than what it calls for and I used bacon. A lot of bacon! Probably 2lbs thick-sliced in bite size pieces. I also mixed the seasonings with the eggs and milk before I added them over the hashbrowns and bacon. And I added a ton of cheese probably at least 3 cups if not a little more. I used 1/3 mild cheddar and 2/3 sharp cheese. And I didn‚Äôt add the cheese until about 5-10 minutes before it was supposed to be finished. That seem to be perfect. Everyone loved it and raved on and on about it. I will definitely make this again

Family really loved it.  The only thing I will do differently next time is really watch the last 15 minutes and reduce the cooking time.  It could be my oven, but an hour at 400 degrees almost burned the top of the casserole.

Pretty much followed the recipe.   I used a 8x8 pan, so reduced the quantities a bit (3 eggs vice 4).  I sauteed some green peppers with the onions and, with the bacon, browned and crumbled some spicy breakfast sausage.  Everything turned out great.

Easy, yummy, flexible recipe. I roughly doubled everything in this recipe except the  bacon. I used 12 eggs, two 8 oz packages of diced ham (no bacon), 2.25 c skim milk, one 32 oz bag of diced potatoes, one 2 c bag of shredded sharp cheddar, some garlic & I accidentally threw 2 T of butter into the mix instead of using it to grease my pan. I thought for sure it would stick without it, but it didn't at all.  I used a 9x13 glass pan & these ingredients fit perfectly - if I had added much else I would have needed a second pan. I mixed it all together in a bowl before pouring into pan & refrigerated about 24 hours before cooking. I cooked it for 45 min at 400 degrees & it was done. I left it in on warm for 15 more minutes because it wasn't time to eat yet. I didn't add any veggies due to picky eaters, & although I didn't find it bland, I thought it could use a small amount of onion & green pepper. I think this recipe would work well a variety of ways.

I tried crisping the hash browns on the stovetop prior to pouring into casserole dish. Then added bacon, egg mixture and cheese. I did not refrigerate after prepping, just did everything at once.  I was concerned the cheese would burn prior to the eggs cooking but it was ok. My son requested mozzarella next time instead of cheddar. I omitted the onion and mushroom but my hash mix did already have onions and peppers. I may try covering with foil next time until the last few minutes.

Boring, not tasty, and nothing to recommend it.  Only gave 2stars because the recipe did actually work and made an edible casserole.  I don‚Äôt understand why so many people loved this recipe.  Potatoes made it very bland, feel like if I ever made it again (won‚Äôt), I‚Äôd stir it all up before cooking and I‚Äôd add something tastier, like sour cream or cream cheese or feta, or all that... would also double the meat and use/add breakfast sausage (for more flavor).

This was a big hit this Christmas morning.  Followed the recipe to the letter but I got 8 servings out of it.  Feel this could work for any occasion where a make ahead breakfast is needed as well as Camping Trips with the Camp DutchOven.

I made this casserole with a few modifications.  I used turkey bacon, saut√©ed onions, 1 1/2 cups milk, 2 cups of cheese and  4 eggs.  Instead of using frozen hash browns, I made my own which I seasoned which I‚Äôm thinking saved this otherwise bland dish.  I wish I had read the reviews before making it per the directions. My chief complaint is the cheese was burned. I think it would‚Äôve made more sense to bake at 350 instead of 400 and for less than an hour if prepared and refrigerated over night.  Also adding more eggs to the recipe would‚Äôve made it feel less like a potato casserole. Overall the flavor was great and I definitely will be making this again however with more eggs and maybe adding the cheese in later to prevent the hard crusty feel it has. Thanks for sharing!

I will be serving this at church this morning and another one Christmas morning. Since there will be many kids around, I left out the mushrooms and onions. It's in the oven now. Can't wait to see how it is received! Merry Christmas!

I basically triple the recipe and use about a dozen eggs. I use frozen tator tots but I cook them first in the oven then throw the other ingredients on top (well mix together). I find this way the potatoes have a bit of texture instead of just getting mush. I also add some cooked Jimmy dean hot sausage and a mild sausage (we like meat). I also add cilantro and green onion. I also add some more seasonings such as chili powder garlic powder onion powder, paprika, and sometimes a smidge of cumin. I bake in a huge foil disposable container for 350 for almost 45 or until the egg is all set. I bake it covered for about 30 min then uncovered the last 10-15 to let the cheese brown up. I also use a blend of Mexican cheeses.

I didn't have my 9x13 pan so I split the ingredients into 2 pie pans. I added spinach & herb seasoning to one of them. I baked it 20 min then added the cheese and only had to bake another 5-10 min.

I made this recipe for Christmas morning.  The only complaint was that there was not enough for seconds.  So I made it again on New Years Day and doubled it.  I can't wait to make it again next Christmas.

Similar to other reviews I would double the eggs and half the potatoes to make it taste more eggy. I made it the way the recipe states and it was more of a potato dish with a topping.

good blank slate of a recipe. I would assume it would be bland if done as is. I added more veggies and did sausage and bacon and it was still potato heavy. I realized after that adding the cheese INSIDE the dish would have made it cheesier and more flavorful

I prepared this Christmas Eve and popped it in the oven Christmas morning.  The entire family loved it- which makes it a bit of a Christmas miracle.  I like heavily seasoned food so I just added more of the spices but that's just personal preference. I think next time, and there will be many next times, I will sautee garlic with the onions and mushrooms. 

The casserole didn't last the day, but it did reheat well and I added a dollop of sour cream to my second helping and enjoyed that as well.  I also think the recipe is very forgiving and would be a great canvas for anything you might wish to add to it.  I am very grateful I found this recipe. It's a keeper.

We will definitely make this again!  When I was making this, I was afraid it might be too salty.  It was not at all!  Using a 9 x 13 pan, I baked it UNCOVERED for 40 minutes, let it sit for 10 
minutes, and was very happy with the results!  I think using ham would be a good substitute, if desired.  Thank you for posting this!

Delicious! We used to have breakfast casserole every Christmas morning however I didn't have the recipe my grandma used. This was amazing and I highly recommend it. Now I did mix everything together instead of layering and I left out the mushrooms. Still stayed close to the original.

This casserole was for New Years, since I was staying with family, I thought I bring it for brunch or a snack.  My son-in-law said it was really good.  He ate it for breakfast on the first day, and then heated it up in a skillet on day 2, which was even better.   

If I make it again, I will use sharp cheddar cheese and maybe less milk, because I found it a bit bland myself.

Not as pretty as some breakfast casseroles but very tasty. Your choice of sausage meat will be a key to success in flavouring.

For the sake of the mushroom-haters in my family, I only put them in half the casserole. Followed the rest of the instructions. Everyone loved it, though I did think it was too greasy. Next time I would drain much of the bacon grease before sauteing.

I used 12 fresh eggs from our farm so there would be enough for 8 people. I only used about 1/2 a cup of milk because 1 1/2 just seemed like too much. I also sauteed the rest of the hash browns in the bag and put them on top so that it looked more appetizing. Everyone loved it!

Add a small garden salad & you've got a nice meal.  I prefer to make 2 ar a time so I freeze one.  It's not twice the work but I have 2 meals.  I only added more onions as I love them, but otherwise prepared it as directed.

My family loved this casserole! I disagree with any of the comments that said it was bland. Cooking the onions and mushrooms in the bacon grease added just the right amount of savory to the entire dish. I also thoroughly salted and peppered the hashbrowns on the bottom before adding anything else. I also didn't measure out the mushrooms or cheese, but used an entire 16 oz. carton of sliced fresh mushrooms and an entire 2 pound bag of shredded sharp cheddar. I do agree that the bottom is a little mushy while the cheese on top was a little overly done. Next time, I'll cook it a little longer and wait to add the cheese in the last 15 minutes of cooktime. It was absolutely delicious, though, and so super easy to prepare. Loved only having to pop it in the oven on Christmas morning.

Good breakfast casserole. Added peppers and 2 extra eggs, plus added chez at the end of baking.

Great recipe with a little tweeking. I added a red bell pepper and used 8 eggs and I had left over ham, so I used that instead.  I made it the night before and added the cheese 20 minutes before it was done.  It smelled wonderful and my family raved about it. They topped it with a dot of sour cream and hot sauce. Absolutely delicious! I'll make this again.

Made this for Christmas  Eve morning, the day after my son's  wedding and the brunch we were having with his new in-laws.   It was great!! Everybody loved it and while I have made similar casseroles before, I think having this sit in the fridge for two days (had to make it so early because of the lack of time with the rehearsal dinner and the wedding and all) really improved the taste.

Tasted pretty good.  Got a little crispy leaving it in for the alloted  time.  Found it easier just to mix everything together and bake it.

It is very bland...not bad with salsa. It definitely needs added ingredients to give it some flavor. I will be adding a lot of onion, bell pepper and red pepper the next time I make it. Salsa saved the day on this first round!

Love it! I made this for a girl's brunch and everyone had polished plates afterwards. Hubby had some afterwards and he loved it too. Just a couple of minor tweaks. Cooking the onions and mushrooms is going to take MUCH longer than 5 minutes to cook down. Instead of garlic salt, I used 2 large cloves of minced fresh garlic and added it along with the onions and mushrooms towards the last few minutes of cooking in the frying pan. In addition to parsley, I also added some thyme which added a lot of great flavor. I think the next time I make this recipe I will also try adding a bit of cayenne just to give it a little zip.

Great recipe! I used 1-1/2 lb. sweet Italian pork sausage, brown and drain well, instead of the bacon. also added 1 large minced garlic clove to the onion and mushroom mix. I'll definitely make again!

This is a great recipe. I didn't have any hash browns so I grated some potatoes instead. I doubled the eggs and it turned out good. I think I'll add more veggies next time I make it.

I made per instructions. It tasted strange and bland. I really did not like it. The hash browns were mushy and should have had far more seasoning.

I followed the direction of a few others, and added more egg, using 10, skipped the mushrooms as no one in my household likes them, and cut the onion down to one.  I didn't have hashbrowns, so I shredded five medium potatoes.  This came out awesome.  As others have said, its a great base recipe that allows you to mix and match ingredients.   Simple prep, and the fact you don't have to cook in the morning is great.  
I also cooked at 350 for 1 hr covered and 30 minutes uncovered.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I decided to make it for breakfast today, without letting it stand in the fridge overnight.  I am not sure what frozen hash brown potatoes are (already cooked e.g.?), so I just used raw, shredded potatoes.  Like some reviewers did, I mixed all the ingredients together before pouring the egg over.  I did add some cheese on top.  Perhaps next time I'd like to first fry the shredded potatoes slightly, and then top it with the filling and egg.  It could be quite nice if it had some sort of crust at the bottom.  The way I made it today, does not really appeal to us.  After breakfast, my husband remarked that he still preferred bacon and eggs and trimmings - I always ask for honest opinions.  Not sure if I will try it again.

VERY GOOD EASY. Made for Christmas morning and all enjoyed. I put peas and corn in with Costco hasbrowns.
Used ham instead of bacon and packaged cheese,
Could easily add a few red pepper flakes to pick it up a bit.
I will make again.

This was amazing! I substituted one box (can) of Cream of mushroom soup in place of the eggs, as I cannot have them, and added green pepper to the mushroom/onion saut√©. This was a HUGE hit for Christmas morning!! :)

We enjoyed the flavor of this, but there were just too many potatoes for us.  Next time I would decrease the potatoes by 1/2 and double the eggs.

I made this for Christmas morning, after putting it all together, and refrigerating it the night before.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding three additional eggs.  It just didn't look as eggy as I wanted it.  I was glad I had read the reviews, and saw that so many people had done that with good results.  This was done in one hour.  It was very good.  I put some hot sauce on mine, but family liked it as it was, with additional salt and pepper.  A great way to feed a hungry bunch in the morning, with no fuss, no mess.  Will do this and variations of this quite often.  Will be great with leftover ham, hot sausage, leftover taco meat...endless possibilities with veggies too!  The hash browns I used were the cubed ones with bell peppers and onions, and I still used the fresh onions in the recipe.  Will have fun with this recipe for years to come!  Thanks for posting, and thank you to all the people who took the time to give reviews.  They are very helpful.

Excellent Christmas brunch recipe. Made it this morning for the first time. Used bulk sausage instead of bacon, minced my mushrooms and onion (used only 1/4 of one onion)since the kids aren't fans and they didn't even know they were in there! Added a little Thyme, increased garlic salt and used 7 eggs per other's suggestion. Family loved it!

Loved it and will make it again. This time the only thing I changed from the recipe was to use 2 cups of cheese instead of one (one small package of pre-shredded cheese). I also cooked it for the first 45 min with tinfoil on it and then uncovered for the last 15 minutes and it was cooked beautifully. Next time however I will use only 1/2 tsp salt, as I did find it a bit salty. Also I was thinking of using more eggs but wanted to try it once as per the recipe. Next time I think I will add the extra eggs.

This was  very good.  I did tweak, I used 7 eggs and was heavy handed with the pepper.  I also used half pound bacon and half pound sausage.  Other than that followed the rest of the recipe.  My teenage son really enjoyed it, even said I should make it for dinner sometime.

My 3 star opinion surprised me. Normally when I see a high star value on this site the recipe is great. In this case, it was just OK. 

I agree with some of the past comments - the casserole was mostly flavourless. My guess is that there is too much milk, diluting the eggs too much - you really couldn't taste eggs in the dish at all.   

Admittedly, I also halved the bacon and cheese to save some calories - that was a mistake because they appear to be the key seasonings. 

My guests enjoyed it. It was very easy to make, and it was a really nice part of the meal. But, I can see that it will take some more experimenting to perfect this recipe. Next time I prepare it I will increase the eggs and cut the milk by (at least) half.

We had this Christmas Brunch Casserole for brunch today...Christmas Day...and I must say I do like the ease of Christmas morning when all you have to do is put the pan in the oven while you have family time opening gifts.  Had not made a casserole like this for many years cuz the kids were not fond of it when they were little.  Made it today and there was only two pieces left!  I changed the recipe a little as per our family's tastes: red pepper instead of mushrooms; more seasonings; more cheese that I added to the whole mixture as well as on top in the last 10 minutes of cooking and more eggs. (I have hungry boys!)  I love the fact I can use potatoes in this recipe instead of bread as per other similar recipes as there are gluten sensitivities in the family. All in all a good recipe and a great concept!  Thanks for sharing!

I used sausage instead of bacon and 6 eggs instead of 4. Still, at 400 degrees for an hour, the cheese on top was completely burned and the bottom was pretty much the same. What was left in the middle was okay. I should have checked it during the hour, but I put it in to bake while we opened Christmas presents. Very disappointed. I'll try again with a lower temp and/or less time, maybe mix it up as some suggested.

I just tried this recipe and loved it!  My guests also went back for seconds so I guess they enjoyed it also.  Very easy to make.  I did tweek a few things.  I mixed all ingredients in a bowl.  Left out the mushrooms and substitued red bells peppers (cooked with the onions).  I used 8 eggs (think I could have used a few more) and since I didn't leave it in the refrigerator over night I cooked it a 350' for 40 min.  Will definitely use it again!  Thank you for the recipe! Cindy C.

I decided to try this for Christmas morning.  Everyone loved it!  It was immediately a new Christmas tradition. Two weeks later,(I couldn't wait) I made it again for Sunday Brunch.  Now I make this monthly.  It's wonderful making it the night before & just being able to relax in the morning with a great breakfast.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a good start but needs improvemet. 4 eggs is not enough. I added 6 but 8 would be better. I also added green peppers and a can of green chiles, and it was still kind of bland. The cheese really needs to go on at the last 10 minutes or so otherwise it dries out and gets rubbery. With some adjustment it has potential.

I made this breakfast casserole and a similar one with ham and hashbrowns.  We liked this one a lot, but, I would use hashbrowns instead of the shredded potatoes.  Love the bacon and garlic in this dish.  Easy to prepare the night before and then just pop in the oven in the morning!

This was very good, even the kids liked it. However I think it needs more eggs to help hold everything together. In addition to the bacon I added some precooked sausage links. I also followed the advice of another and put on the cheese before the egg mixture.

Sooo good. The only caveat is it does need more eggs. Try 6-8 instead of 4.

The recipe brought raves from my family on Christmas morning. Preparing it the night before helps me in the morning after choir at church. My son who goes with me for the midnight Mass puts it in the oven and its ready to eat an hour later. A+ 
Next year I intend to bake it for 50-55 min. Using less potatoes as suggested was perfect!

This was a good recipe to make ahead of time.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave ahead of time.  My children don't like anything with onions or mushrooms, so I left them out.  Next time I would add the bacon and 1/2 the cheese until the last 20 minutes of cooking.  This way the bacon will stay crunchy.

I wish I'd never heard of this recipe.  Now, whenever I'm binging as I have been over the holidays, I see myself preparing this amazing brunch casserole.  Because it has elements of breakfast and lunch, it's ideal for a brunch situation.  Further, it has a festive and colorful look, which makes it great for a holiday.  While it does take a little time, it's doable.  I cooked the bacon at the same time I sauteed the mushrooms and onion.  I baked the casserole immediately following assembly.  It was done in 40 minutes.  I was afraid if I left it in any longer, that the cheese would turn black.  Compliments from everybody who tried it.  You can bet I'll prepare this one again.

I doubled the recipe using 1 lb. bacon and 1 lb. of cut up sausage and instead of topping with cheese I mixed the cheese in with the egg mixture.  Served at a business meeting and brought home 2 empty dishes!  Thanks!

The family loved this.  I used green onions instead of onions and added tomatoes.  I think I will try sausage next time.

I used 12 eggs...It served about 8 people. Everyone raved about it. The texture was great. The onions gave it a great flavor. This one is a keeper!

I made this for our Christmas breakfast.  It was good.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer to use O'Brien potatoes.  I also considered the remarks of another reviewer regarding the fat content of this recipe.  I used egg substitute and vegetarian breakfast sausage halfed with regular sausage.  This cut down on the fat and the richness without sacrificing too much of the taste. I also cooked the regular sausage in a colander inside of a bowl to drain the fat as it cooked and rinsed it afterwards.  I served salsa with it.  Next time, I want to add a can or two of chopped green chilies and more mushrooms.

This turned out pretty good. Would use less hash browns next time though. I did use the suggestion of another reviewer and added in a 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup.

Wow, was this a hit with my guests! I must confess, I had to make a substitution (Durkee French Fried onions for fresh...I just didn't have the time to chop them up). I didn't do mine the night before, so I baked it for 45 minutes, as the recipe stated, and it was fine.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream on the side of each plate, as it reminded me so much of potato pancakes.  This recipe is definitely going to remain in my repertoire; however, I'll have to pretend I never looked at the fat content in the nutritional information.....

I made this for Christmas breakfast; everyone ate most of their serving, but I wouldn't make it again.  I used 6 eggs, but it needs more.  The hash browns taste like mashed potatoes; mushy.

This is quick and easy. I would add more bacon and crumble it through out the hash browns. I might try adding and extra egg or 2 next time as well. The kids aren't very fond of the onions and mushrooms. Overall though it was a treat and I would try it again.

Very good.  I cut out all the salt since the bacon has enough salt already in it.  I also cut down on the fat by cooking the onions and mushrooms in some of the bacon drippings.  I also through in some minced garlic in the sautee to account for the garlic salt.
