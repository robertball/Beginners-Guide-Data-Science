This is a good base for the stew. The changes I made were based on what was home and personal taste. I used 3 sweet potatoes and it seemed like not enough chicken. Next time I will make 2 chicken breasts. With the onion I added a stalk of celery. Ingredients added with the chicken were: small amount of balsamic vinegar, dried rosemary, dried parsley, and garlic. Bay leaf was added with the broth. So yummy

I turned this into a crockpot meal. I substituted black beans for kidney beans. It turned out well. I cooked the chicken, onions, and chicken broth for three hours in low. Shredded the chicken and added the carrots, sliced mushrooms and two giant cubes sweet potatoes. I thought it was a good comfort food meal. I have one picky eater who ate everything in this.

Simple and delicious.  As usual I added Tony Chachere's and Cayenne and took another's advice and sprinkled a dab of rosemary. Next time will add celery and a bay leaf. Not quite a stew but still great!
