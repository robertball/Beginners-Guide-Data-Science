What a fabulous recipe!  Doubled the recipe and used one pound king crab and also sprayed the crab lightly with olive oil spritz bottle.  I added about 4 jalapenos in addition to the serrano peppers.  Made homemade guacamole, spread it on toasted corn tortillas and topped with crab mixture.  Out of this world!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Avocado was an interesting addition as per the other reviewers, and it turned out delicious! Also, subbed. the serranos -too spicy for me- for jalapenos and it still turned out excellent. Great recipe, I wouldn't change anything else! We served this with shredded fried tortilla pieces, and nothing was left!!

Loved this.  Had some crab meat from another recipe and didn't know what to do with it.  I had everything on had.  Simple, easy, inexpensive, and delicious.  Thanks for the post.

Even my grandson's loved this! I subbed jalapenos for serranos & I served it in big martini glasses on a bed of crushed tortilla chips as suggested by Caroline C. ...good idea! My grandsons thought they were so grown-up eating it! I did cut wayy back on the oil (I only sprinkled just a bit to help moisten) & I also cut back on the cilantro.

Should be called Super Ceviche! Great for those who don't care for raw fish dishes. I found a few shortcuts: used the chopped tomatoes that are sold in cartons- used fresh Cilantro paste that's sold in chilled tubes. Make the effort to find Lime Oil- it's KEY in this recipe!! Then have fun tweaking the heat to your own taste! Great with the scoop-shaped
tortilla chips. For a crowd, doubles easily.

Whatever you add or don't add, just don't forget to pour in some Clamato juice--not tomato juice-- but Clamato juice. Will make you hum!!  Your guests will keep wondering what the secret ingredient is. I serve with potato chips or sour dough bread with butter.

This is a very good, quick and cheap ceviche recipe. When I made it yesterday, I let it marinade in the 'frige for a couple of hours, and the lime really overwhelmed the other flavors. I made it again today, but let it sit for one hour as suggested; this time the lime didn't dominate. I served it over a handful of roughly crushed tortilla chips. Husband loves it. Thanks!

We made the ceviche with real crab and used 1/2T olive oil with 1/2T Lime Oil (as suggested by another reviewer).All ingredients were very finely chopped. I baked some Pepperidge Farm dessert shells and spooned the mixture into those just before serving. Made for a nice presentation.Thanks Louis!

Great recipe.  I doubled the recipe and we still ran out with only 4 people.  I served them on tostadas for dinner and the kids and husband couldn't stop raving.  The only change I made was to substitute lime oil (found in the Asian foods section..GREAT STUFF!) for the olive oil.   As one other reviewer said, it's like Crab Pico de Gallo.  I'm adding this to my permanent recipe collection, thanks!

Very good.  Especially for using imitation crab meat.  This is a very cost effective way to make ceviche.  I couldn't find serrano peppers at my grocery so I used canned serrano peppers.  They have a bit of a kick, but not too spicy.  I will add two next time then taste it before I add the 3rd pepper.

No imitation crab meat used in this house!  Only the best from Costco.  I added some spice with tabasco sauce and cooled it down with avocado.  Good recipe.

Great recipe.  I made it for a get together and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were I used fresh jalapeno and I added fresh minced garlic.  I will definately make this again.

This is awesome!!! My family loved it, especially the kids. I've made ceviche before using other recipes and the kids have not been such fans. But this time they raved about it..they even admitted it was real spicy but that did not stop them from coming back for more and more!!! Of course, us adults loved it. This is by far one of the best ceviche recipes on this site and that I've made thus far! Like others I used real crabmeat, since I don't like the imitation stuff and also added scallops since we love them.

I didn't change anything, I even used the cheap fake stuff that it calls for and it tasted good. I'm sure it is much better with real crab and adding chopped avocado as many have suggested doesn't sound bad either. Thanks for a great recipe!

This ceviche is SO good!!  My family loved it and I will definitely make it again.  I used real crab and added 2 cut up avocados and eliminated the olive oil.  This is a great recipe and could be used for many occasions.

Great recipe, I did not have cilantro but it was still tasty. I used a jar of crab meat but will also try it with imitation crab since it is cheaper. I like my food spicy so I added some chilli powder and hot sauce. Will be making this recipe a lot, especially this summer.

Really, really wonderful!  I didn't use the oil (really not needed).  I added some hot pepper sauce as some others suggested.  I have made this same recipe in the past, but used tuna instead.  Never even thought of using crab.  I used real crab, and it was delicious!

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe but added half the onion and half the lime juice it called for, just for my tastes, and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again.

This was good!  So simple!  I could not stop tasting it and was worried it would not make it to the fridge to allow the flavors to marry.  I did add just 2-3 dashes of Old Bay Seasoning, and had to use dry cilantro since my fresh cilantro is not ready to pick just.  I plan on making this for my lunches next week, serving it over a tossed salad.  I used canned crab but will buy the fresh or imitation to use.  That I believe would be kicker!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!  Can't wait for it to be ready to eat!

I took this to a party for a bunch from my excercize class and got Kudos all over the place. The girls went nuts for the fact that served with whole grain crackers and chips, this appetizer is low fat, low calorie and full of flavor. Not for the picky eater, the cilantro does have a big impact on the taste buds. I did tweak the recipe a bit - I doubled it all, but substituted small salad shrimp for the extra crab.
Overall, a wonderful alternative to the usual dips served.

Very good! The entire dish was devoured before dinner was even cooked. It's basically pico de gallo with crab meat, who would have thought it'd be so yummy? I plan to use this recipe whenever we have a potluck or picnic to contribute to. Thanks!

Tastes delicious!!! Chop everything very small and make sure to let it sit so the flavors blend. I left out the olive oil and didn't miss it. Would like to try it with some avocado.

Hey, not bad! I love Ceviche and didn't think I'd go for the imitation crab but this really came together nicely! I added some cubed avocado and finely diced cucumber (I think these belong in any Ceviche), but other than that stuck to the recipe. I ate it straight up, but it would be excellent with tortilla chips. I think next time I will try it over guacamole on a tostada shell as some have suggested. I can't wait!

Excellent poor man's version of Ceviche.  I use jalapanos instead of serano peppers becasue serranos are a little too hot for me.  Also, I add an avacado if I have one.  It adds a little extra to the dish plus it's super healthy.

Absolutely delicious.  I left out the tomatoes because I'm not a fan, but my husband and I both loved this.  It was incredibly easy to put together and tasted great an hour later and a few days later.  Yum!

What?  Ceviche is raw fish that is "cooked" using acid from other foods.  If you are using imiation crab meat it is already cooked.  This is not ceviche. This should be titled "mock ceviche"  It is still good

Really flavorful! We used fresh dungeness crab and used only 2 peppers as it had plenty of heat for us. Avocado is a definite must have addition!  Will become a regular keeper for when we go crabbing! Thanks!

I was looking for a ceviche recipe that didn't call for fish, and this was perfect! I didn't have cilantro, but it came out awesome anyways.  I now keep extra crab meat in the freezer to make this whenever we want a nice snack.  I added some garlic powder and onion salt... delish!

yum & easy, but a little time consuming chopping stuff up.  doubled the recipe. store had bad limes so used bottled key lime juice - had ugly red onions so used white one.  used jalapenos instead of serrano.  was very good but i think fresh lime juice & a red onion would be even better.  did use the imitation crab.  tried 3 ways: fresh roma tomato, canned wood-fired tomatoes, and no tomato.  wood-fired was best!  served on tostada and tostito scoops - really good with texas pete.  i like it even better 24+ hours later.  (tip: use a pizza cutter to cut the cilantro!  just roll back & forth!  soo easy!!)

Hmm, ok. After living in Nicaragua and having proper ceviche, this can't compare. It works but not like freshly caught fish. I used the fake crab meat as called for in the recipe, maybe it would be better with fresh/real crab meat.

Wow!  Thank you for this recipe.  I added 1 can of white crab meat because I had it on hand and adjusted the other ingredients to match the crab addition and everyone loved it.  I will add another serano next time as I like things a little hotter but this was awesome!

This was really good, and easy to prepare, but it is only as good as the imitation crab you use.   I only used 1/2 pepper and that was good.   Would probably be even better with a few shrimp thrown in.

Here is an addition you must try -- a package of powdered guacamole mix. You'll  find it in the produce dept. of the grocery store. Adds so much flavor.  It comes in regular (mildly spicy) or spicy (extra spicy).  I always use this when making ceviche - my little secret until now ;) I serve on tostada shells for lunch/dinner, or with tortilla chips for parties. Even people who were skeptical of ceviche go crazy for it. If using the "spicy" version, you will probably want to cut back the Serrano pepper to one, unless you and your people are really into heat! I always add  a small, peeled diced cucumber, and use a combination of imitation crab and small cooked shrimp.

Really good recipe, though it was a bit spicy for us. I  stirred some light mayo in, enough to make it creamy, and some sugar to taste. We ate it with tortilla chips, like a dip.

I love ceviche and this didn't fail to please. I used jalapenos because I can't handle the heat anymore and I used a sweet onion (didn't have a red one) instead of red. I served it with tortilla chips for dipping. It was delicious! I will be making this a lot now.

Love it. Definitely let it sit for an hour before serving as it mellows out. I tried some right away & it was very overwhelming, but sooooo good after sitting in fridge for an hour.

Great recipe. Making for a second time but will only use one lime. I didn't use any peppers and did use the avocado per another suggestion. Served over a bed of spring mix lettuce. Super easy, healthy and delish!

Good recipe, easy to make, but I found the onion completely overpowering. I will make this again but next time will only use 1/2 an onion.

My teens love ceviche so picked up the ingredients and tried this version. They loved it!  My tweaks included adding 3 avocados chopped, diced cucumber and a few glugs of jalapeño ketchup which we always have. Chilled for an hour. Great with tortilla chips and watching the World Cup! Refreshing!

I did use this recipe as a guide, and it is right on.  However, I don't like my foods too citrus-y, so I only juiced one lime.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, added some jalapenos and juice from a jar, and added a splash of Clamato, the way a Mexican friend showed me.  My guests devoured it.

Finally!  A ceviche recipe that came out right the first time.  I have had a terrible run of luck in about a dozen attempts with other seafood. This time I used fresh lump backfin, but followed all other ingredients and proportions exactly. So delicious!  I can't wait to make this again.  Thank you!

Only had a small amount of crabmeat, but found this soooo delicious! I only added a little chopped red onion-didn't want the taste of crab overwhelmed. Too, I just sprinkle some dried cilantra and parsley over. And, since I am not a "spicy fan", I omitted the peppers-guess I am the only non-spicy person in the www! Still, I am making more today for the football games! A great appetizer!

This was the base of a great creation at my house.  My husband has a beautiful garden which sometimes determines our ingredients.  I used 8-10 oz imitation crab legs, 4 small red tomatoes, 1 medium yellow tomato, 3/4 of a large cucumber, one small white onion, 4 small jalapenos, 1 green chili, squeezed 2 large limes, some fresh dill, a few tbsp. olive oil, a bunch of black pepper and a generous amount of salt and mediterranean sea salt.  I diced all of thes ingredients and served it with some Hint of Lime Tostitos.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

This was really good, however I think if you cut back to just one lime, it would be perfect. 2 limes seem to overpower all the other flavors. I'll be making this again, thank you.

This recipe was fantastic!  I did add avocado and some hot sauce per other reviewer's suggestions, but I'm sure it would have been great without those items.  This will be a regular staple in our household!

Great recipe! I used real crab meat, omitted the oil and subbed green peppers for the serrano. This sat for awhile in the fridge and got better and better. Hubby enjoyed very much. Thank you.

Admittedly, my three year old daughter fed most of hers to the dog. HOWEVER, the rest of my family enjoyed it very much! I needed something cool and substantial on a hot day. I am also seeking generally healthier recipes as I am working out to lose weight. I doubled the recipe to feed seven and only the toddler was disappointed. We served on tostadas as recommended and omitted Serrano peppers because they were out at the store! I would like to try this with fresh crab in the future and maybe butter if I ever reach my goal weight. Excellent, light, fresh and filling. Will make again.

I made this just now , it is important that i mention right off break that this is absolutely delicious. I made no changes and love it. Already my family is asking when I will make this dish again.  My son mentioned that he could have used less of the pepper seeds in it and more of the crab meat. I personally wouldn't change  a thing. Thank you so much for sharing, instantly moved to my favorites.

I was amazed how simple and tasty this was.Only "changes" I made was to add more cilantro and lime juice and used jalapenos. I ate this on a tostada with a little mayonnaise as suggested by the poster and it was great. Next time I will try with an avocado spread as some reviewers suggested

A lot of onions so next time I will add half and add more crab other than that we enjoyed it. More of an adult version since it is a bit pricy in my families opinion.

This was wonderful! So yummy! I used real lump crabmeat instead of the imitation stuff, and I spooned it on a heated corn tortilla from a tortilla skillet instead of on a tostada or chips and it was great! The 3 Serrano peppers made this extremely spicy, and although I like spicy it seemed a little overwhelming for me. I may omit 1 pepper the next time I make it. But it’s a definitely a keeper in my recipe book! Thanks!

I used real crab, no oil nor salt and pepper. It was delicious, fresh and had a kick from the serrano peppers.  

Served two ways; with lettuce leaves, like a wrap. Served with tortilla chips to dip in the ceviche. YUM!

I have to be upfront and say that I've never eaten ceviche before, though my husband is a big fan of it.  I made the recipe almost exactly as it says. . The store didn't have any large tomatoes so I used 3 smaller ones, which was the only mod I made (at first). Initial taste test and I was surprised I liked it. Our limes seem to be on the small side, so husband added the juice of two more. Then we added avocado as others have recommended. I don't like avocados to eat as a general rule, but even I liked it with them added. It was good before we added the lime and avocado, it was good after. I'd eat it either way so it gets 5 stars from us.

I gave it 5 stars but don't use a big purple onion. I doubled the recipe and used 2 large red onions and my wife said it tasted like onion salad. I don't know if my onions were just too big or if the recipe is faulty. Cut back on the onions. She still liked it and took some to her friends at work and they liked it but said too much onion. I'll make it again with half an onion per recipe. Another thing the wife said was it was better the second day. Let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. I also cheated and use the food processor on everything. Came out looking very pretty. I don't eat fish but everybody loved it that ate it.

I subed for milder pepper, didn't do the avocado but will next time.  Chopped the tomato smaller so I could stuff this in  giant pasta shells.  Really a great finger food for a buffet.  They went as fast as I could bring them out.  I did do two batches one with real crab one with imitation for those with crustatian allergies.  I ate them both with equal relish.

I had some imitation crabmeat that I wanted to use, and this looked like a good recipe. I used a small amount of crushed red pepper flakes in place of the chile pepper. I also used the refrigerated cilantro in a tube with no problem. I put some Guacamole (from this site) on tortilla chips, then topped with this. Very good for a light but filling supper. I'm sometimes a little leery of raw seafood, but this I can do. Thanks - nice recipe!

This is yummy!  I made it as stated and added one chopped avocado before serving it with tortilla scoop chips.  Everyone loved it. I didn't add any salt or pepper because the 'crab' already has a lot of sodium as well as the chips I served it with.  I will be making this again!

...wishing that people would stop referring to dishes using "imitation ??" (pollock) as crab... and, since it's already "cooked" (processed), the ceviche method is not needed...  having said THAT, tried it with real crab meat, everything according to the recipe, yada, yada, yada... it was ok, but not putting this recipe "in the rotation "...

I just can't imagine a ceviche with tomatoes, that is a different kind but not real ceviche. Thee ceviche was born at north of Peru by the Moche Culture 500 years ago and I can assure it doesn't take tomato

I used a green onion and baby tomatoes which are firmer.   Pulsed everything except crab in the Cuisinart.  Folded in crab.  Fabulous.  I even splurged for real Dungeness crab. Wow!

Good recipe, but changed it up a bit. I used half of a large onion, one and a half large tomatoes, 2 serano peppers, 1 jalapeño and added 1 medium avocado and a cup of chopped mango. It was DELICIOUS

First of all, DO NOT USE imitation crab. Spare no expense and purchase Lump crab. I only had sliced jalapeño peppers in a jar and used about 1/4 cup for the peppers which provided the perfect kick. I served it at girl's night and they loved it.

I had some king crab in the freezer left over from Christmas, so I used it to make this ceviche. I followed the recipe, but I used 2 serrano peppers and  removed most of the seeds then chopped it up. Discarding most of the seeds gave my ceviche a nice kick, but not a fiery heat. I have tried many different ceviches this one ranks #1!

OMG! Delish!!!! Started eating healthy... yesterday (literally) and this was great on the taste buds considering the fact that I've eaten nothing but junk as of lately.  Thanks for the great recipe.  For me, this dish is the perfect  transition into healthy eats!

but I added half cucumber for crunch and used 2 very small white onions instead of a red onion.  I served it on field greens with chips.  It was a hit, with a frosty mug of beer.

This was good but very spicy for my taste it overpowered everything I would use 2 peppers the next time and cut them by hand in little pieces not in a processor to maintain texture. It still was very good, just not for everyone.

Used some suggestions from other reviewers, substituting jalapeno peppers for the Serrano peppers.  Also added fresh avocado to cut the heat a little.  Felt the juice from two full limes overpowered the taste and will cut back the next time we make it. Very refreshing taste, but the imitation crab was a little overwhelmed. Served with some hard sourdough rolls to scoop up the ceviche.

Loved this recipe! I'd never had ceviche before, let alone prepared it. So easy! I didn't include the Serrano peppers because I'm sensitive to heat but it was still very flavorful. Also I took the advice of another reviewer and wrapped it in a warm tortilla for a hearty lunch. Delicious! Will be making lots more ceviche in the future!

I realized too late I didn't have olive oil so I cheated and used soybean (generic vegetable) oil instead.  I don't know how much it affected it as I haven't had the olive oil version, but man is this a good recipe.  I chopped the crab up pretty small and served it with some easy homemade "guacamole" (3 avocados, a big splash of salsa and some lime juice) on top of crispy heated pitas.  Sliced with a pizza cutter they are phenomenal, great for lunch, dinner, or a snack.  I used fake crab and though I'm sure it'd be great with the real thing, no complaints here.  

The recipe is also pretty sizable, my wife and I have had the ceviche "pizzas" twice now and I had some as a snack today and we've still got a lot left, easy enough for a full meal.  I agree this should be served nice and cold, but it's not bad as it warms up a bit.  Very solid recipe for pretty cheap, highly recommended.

I do the same but I don't use olive oil or serrano peppers. I mix the crabmeat tomato cilantro a little onions. Mix it all good put a little bit of tomato ketchup and mix it. Than if they want lime and hot sauce (we use valentina the yellow label) we add it to our tostadas. Trust me its really good!

I did not care for this recipe. I adore ceviche but my best friend doesn't care for raw fish, even if it's "cooked" in citrus, so I thought this would be a great compromise when she asked me to make an appetizer for Easter Dinner. 

First of all, what I like to taste is ceviche is fish, then lime juice, then spiciness. As written, this recipe reverses that. And I could tell that it would be too hot for my taste so I replaced the Serrano peppers with a medium sized jalapeno.  

I also used lovely fresh crab meat - so you'd think it would have been really good .

But basically it tasted like slightly spicy crab salad without the mayo.
