Okay, I cheated.  I kind of merged this recipe with the Albino Pasta recipe, and added a few things of my own.  It was good!  I used penne pasta instead of linguine, browned my chicken with garlic, seasoned with salt & pepper, and mixed everything together with lots of real, grated parmesan (not the one in the green can), some parsley, milk, and thickened it with a little milk mixed with flour.  You can even get away with skim milk on this!  We'll make this again.  You can do many variations on this.
