I had always wanted to make a Carbonara dish and I saw this recipe some time ago and decided to try it tonight.   I followed the directions exactly.   I found it pretty easy to make honestly.   I and my family loved it!  Almost all got seconds.   I honestly wouldn't change anything except the Italian seasoning.   And that is only because I am not a fan of some of the spices in it.  I would just add the spices I like.  (thyme, oregano,  and basil).  I hope more people will try this great dish!!

Unbelievable. This is my wife's favorite dish at olive garden. She orders it everytime and says she can't tell a difference. We wouldn't change a thing and this made so many servings! Thank you!

It’s very good and while I know it’s still high calorie it has no butter and the wine leaves a nice light flavor.  We will add to our favorites and hang onto this one.

It takes some time but definitely worth the effort. Will make again over and over.

I added pea and mushrooms and didn't have wine, but it still turned out great!
