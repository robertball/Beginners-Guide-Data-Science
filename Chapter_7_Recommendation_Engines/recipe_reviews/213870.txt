I will use this as my go to broccoli casserole.  Not the usual cream of something soup flavor.  I didn't follow this recipe exactly, because I'm not much for microwave cooking, but I did use the sauce for a baked broccoli and cauliflower casserole, and it was great.  Used bread crumbs & Parmesan (mixed w/ melted butter) instead of Ritz crackers, and added a bit of seasoning to the sauce (garlic, parsley, chives, basil).

I thought this was really good! I don't like vegetables...but I couldn't get enough of this! The only change I made (it totally wasn't intentional) was that I used the frozen California Medley vegetable mix; I couldn't find just cauliflower and broccoli. Even my boyfriend enjoyed this and he doesn't generally try new things-meat and potatoes kind of guy. Thanks for the recipe. It was easy, quick and delicious!

I didn't find anything particularly engaging about this combination.  Sounds good but in reality just tasted "blah".

While the taste was good, the texture and heaviness after it cooled a few minutes was unpleasant to me. I give it 4 stars for taste and ease of preparation.

As a recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetic, I am on the look-out for low carb recipes that are still tasty.  This recipe fills the bill!!!  I do mix the cheddar in with the sour cream and cream cheese however.  I also mix the parmesan with the crackers and put it back in the micro for another 2 minutes.  I have made this for company numerous times and they all are amazed that is a recipe that is low carb and good for you.

LOVE it!!! I cooked the veggies in chicken stock, then added the whole 8oz cube of cream cheese to the sauce instead of half (4oz).
DELICIOUS, guests asked for the recipe!!!
