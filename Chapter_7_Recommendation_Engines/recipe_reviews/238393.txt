I think slow cooker meals should be done in the slow cooker! So forget all the steps! Toss all ingredients into the slow cooker. Give it a stir and then cook it on low for the suggested time. It's so good and you don't have to do all the individual steps.  Add the cornstarch at the end and stir.  Serve over rice.  Better than take-out!!

This was an easy, delicious and healthy dinner.  As some others did, I used low sodium soy sauce and that seemed about right for saltiness.  I wanted to stay true to the original recipe but I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup (watching sugar carbs) and also added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it a little zing.  Rather than steam the broccoli, I just added it right after adding the cornstarch slurry and it was perfect after 30 minutes!  I'll definitely make this again - next time I may add sliced onion near the beginning of the cooking and red pepper strips with the broccoli.

My whole family enjoyed this, even the one who says he doesn't like Chinese food.  He ate the most of all of us!  I used Better than Boullion, light soy sauce, garlic powder and a flank steak, because that's what I had on hand and it still turned out delicious and we didn't think too salty.  I also threw in a sliced sweet onion like another reviewer suggested.  Great, easy recipe with very minimal prep that I will be making again.  The sauce is thinner and less sticky than restaraunt style broccoli beef, but no complaints here anyway.

This was very good. My family liked it.  The only change I made is to substitute oyster sauce for half of the soy sauce.  I also used 2 sixteen ounce bags of frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh broccoli.  I found that after cooking 6 hours on LOW the thinly sliced beef I used had fallen apart mostly.  But that was ok. If you want your beef to hold together more in slices it's probably best to only cook for 4-5 hours or use thick chunks of beef instead of slicing it thin like you would for a regular stir fry.  The sauce never thickened for me, but I didn't bother cooking it down in a sauce pan.  There was plenty of juciness for the quinoa I served this with to soak up!! I will make this again.  Leftovers are great!

I followed the ingredients and directions EXACTLY except I used lower sodium soy sauce because that's all I ever use. This was still very salty. I think I would leave out the bouillion next time or use low sodium beef broth instead. Other than that, there are no adjustments needed. I will make this again.

Cooked on high 4 hours and then added cornstarch mixture and small broccoli florets for another 30 minutes.  Beef stew meat was excellent!  Next time I will wait until 15 before finish to add the small broccoli florets though as they didn't have much crunch left.

Such an easy prep-ahead or freezer meal. Throw all ingredients except the water, corn starch, broccoli, and rice into a freezer bag and freeze until you need an easy meal. When ready to use put in slow cooker with the water and follow your recipe from there! A new favorite at our house! This can easily be turned into a gluten-free meal by using gluten-free soy sauce!

I was looking for an easy yet healthful dinner--this was it!  The whole family enjoyed it.  I did use beef stew meat--which made it even easier.

Fantastic! I made 1.5 times the sauce the second time around because the first time I made it, it cooked down and wasn't quite as sloppy as I like. I also used lite soy sauce - had it, didn't know why, never thought I'd use it, so this was a good excuse. The second time around, my husband bought stir-fry meat, so it was in very thin strips. This cut out about an hour from the high cooking time, which was nice because I always think to use the slow cooker at like 3 p.m. Great recipe - can't wait to make it for company! Thanks!

The taste was very good but a little on the salty side as other reviewers mentioned. I also made a couple modifications. Like many others, I used 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and then 1/4 cup oyster sauce to give it a bit more flavor and help with the saltiness. I also added some minced ginger root and instead of steaming the broccoli, I just tossed it into the crock pot like 20-30 minutes to the end. It seems to defeat the purpose of the crock pot a little it if you have to use additional pots/pans, and this way worked just fine. Solid recipe. Will definitely be making it again.

I used very thin sliced beef.  I cooked it on high for 1 hr., then cooked it on low for another 3 hrs.  I used organic beef broth and low sodium soy sauce.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, but I think it could have used 4.  The sauce didn't thicken in the crock pot, so next time I will use the suggestion of thickening the sauce on the stove.
*Update*  Made this again and used a can of beef gravy and a couple tablespoons of water instead of the bullion and water.  Used very thin sliced beef and cooked it on high for 3 hrs, adding the cornstarch and water at 2 hrs and 30 min.  The consistency was thick enough without having to thicken the sauce on the stove.

As one member commented I also just put everything in the slow cooker except veggies without any prep work which saved about a half hour and dirty dishes ( I did add peapods,  water chestnuts and bamboo shoots along with the broccoli  after 4 hrs. ( we like our veggies  crunchy) and cooked on low for 4 hrs. stirring every couple hours and then added the veggies  and cooked another 3 hrs. and it came out awesome. However I will make about 50% more sauce next time.

Made it with half the soy sauce called for (using reduced sodium soy sauce) and the flavor was tasty but too weak. Try making the recipe with the full amount of soy sauce to increase flavor. Also, I just steamed the broccoli in the microwave--much easier, and omitted the sesame oil. Cooked the meat (only 1 pound) in the slow cooker on high for about 2-3 hours.

Used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup brown sugar. It turned out beautifully! I put the uncooked broccoli directly in the slow cooker for the last 10 minutes My husband, who is a fussy eater, raved about it. In fact, he went on and on about it and had three servings! I will definitely make it again.

Ok so I followed this exactly and my husband and I did not like this at all. I mean like really didn't like it. Too salty, and just a bad overall taste. Cornstarch did not thicken mine at all, even after being on high for 30 minutes. Some of you were obviously able to get a tasty result, but I was not.

This recipe does not need any changes.  It was an absolute hit with my family!  Tonight I am making it again, but didn't have bouillon, so I am using a can of beef consume in place of it and am anxious to see if it turns out as well.  Such an easy dish to make with outstanding flavor, you can't go wrong giving this a try

I received a lot of compliments with this recipe. I added sliced onions and mushrooms to it. I decided to add the broccoli about half way through cooking time, and the onions and mushrooms about an hour after that.  Next time I may do the broccoli as the original recipe states, because they lost their green color- soaking up the brown sauce too long, or being cooked too long.

Absolutely delicious!  We sautéed and added baby Bella mushrooms at the end.   The next time I make this, I'll be sure to have some fresh bread to go with it.  I cooked about 8 hours and the meat melted.

I made it exactly like instructed and it wasn't too salty like some said. I did use low sodium soy sauce though. It was very good and my kids enjoyed it to. I didn't know it was a Chinese dish never had Chinese food. :-)

The sauce is perfect! I did use a reduced sodium soy sauce. Got home late. Tossed in some leftover sautéed peppers & onions. Cooked some rice. Got changed, had a glass of wine. Scooped rice into bowls, ladled beef mixture from crock pot over top & enjoyed! Did not have /add thickening agent- no need. Delicious! Make it again good!!! Thanks.

My finicky fam loved it as is.  Just one note:  video shows about a cup of cooking liquid to the 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch.  Written directions say differently.  Do it like the video and it will thicken up perfectly!

I used chopped broccoli instead and used low sodium soy sauce. Had to double the recipe due to feeding 8. Smelled just like take out  but cost me way less. #happy mom.

Was very good. My husband loved it. I put it all in crockpot. Doubled the sauce recipe because like sauce. Didn’t use as much sugar and served with quinoa instead of rice. Delicious. Definitely making again. Thank you!

I really wanted to love this but it just turned out like a roast.  The meat became shredded when you stirred it and I had to add some extra seasonings because it was kind of bland.  The family liked it ok, no one complained.  I do know that Chinese food is  about quick and hot cooking so slow and low is probably not the best way to prepare.

I made this exactly as written, taste tested and didn't like it. Also very soupy. Like straight liquid. Not something I'd make again, but we could eat for 1 night. That being said, after I made it as is and didn't care for it much, I doctored it by adding ground ginger and onion and doubling the corn starch. It was still pretty liquidy, but a bit better and it's now 8pm and the family was hungry. I won't make this recipe again. Even doctored, no one will eat the leftovers. But that's ok, that's what the dogs are for! ??

Spent many years in China...tastes just like what we’d get in the restaurants there...and so easy. I cook batches without adding the broccoli and send home with the kids. They add the broccoli when reheating.

I substituted garlic flavored olive oil for the sesame oil. I made the slow cooker beef as written. I didn't thicken the sauce. I ladled it out and used it for stir fry sauce.  I used 1 bag of frozen stir fry vegetables, thawed. When these were done I added a half package of cooked whole wheat angel hair pasta. Then I dumped the beef with any remaining sauce into the wok and combined all until well mixed and coated with sauce. I served this as lo mein without rice.

Absolutely fantastic! The only thing I changed was I replaced water and bullion with 1 cup of beef bone broth for nutrition and sodium factors. But the original recipe is absolutely  perfect. I have to triple the recipe because they want leftovers!

This was my first time, and I will make it again, with a few "more",  tweeks ! This time I omitted the brown sugar, I don't care for sweet beef. I also added some minced red onion, and a few dried, shitaki mushrooms It reminded me of one of my favorite Chinese, beef dishes "mushroom, & beef, chow yoke. I had it over brown, and wild, rice, with an egg roll !

Followed ingredients, but did what others suggested and threw the broccoli in when cornstarch was added.  Very good! Next time I would add onion and definitely increase the sauce.  I used low sodium soy sauce and did not think it was too salty as other reviewers say.  Topped with some sriracha sauce to add a little kick.  Note: not sure if sirloin is a necessary expenditure.  I think next time I would use stew meat or round.

As suggested by another reviewer I used 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup oyster sauce and I love onions so I added them.    Important to add the broccoli at the end.

We love this recipe. I make it a couple times a month now and do a double batch so I can  freeze individual portions. It freezes quite well. I make it exactly per recipe, or if in a hurry I just skip the crockpot, cook the meat with the sauce in a pan, steam up the broccoli, then combine and serve. It’s a solid staple.

YUM! We loved it! Even my kids loved it (& they only like about 5 meals I make - super picky).  I added some red pepper flakes per another reviewers suggestion & used low sodium soy sauce because that’s all I had in the pantry. I can’t wait to eat it for lunch!

This is all right. After reading some of the reviews, I omitted the beef bouillon, and I'm glad I did - even without it, it was too salty. I'll look for a better beef recipe.

This is a family favourite we make again and again - the kids even go crazy for it (ages 2 and 7)! The sesame oil is necessary to make this recipe good and cannot be substituted for. Any kind of rice works, though. This is even good over egg noodles or pasta.

I took out the beef and covered it.  I put the liquid in a pan and thickened it then added the beef and broccoli.  It was a big hit with my family.  I definitely will make it again.

Delicious! Everyone in my family liked this, and I will definitely make it again. I omitted the sesame oil because I didn’t have any on hand, and added about 1/2 tsp of Chinese Five Spice blend to cut the saltiness a little.

I put the raw broccoli in the slow cooker during the last 20 minutes to cook it with the beef rather than cooking it separately. It may not have been as pretty but it tasted great.

Even with low sodium soy sauce, it is somewhat salty. Also, my beef "shredded" and didn't turn stay in the "planks" I'd cut it in to. Tastes okay.

I followed the recipe and found it to be too sweet for my taste. The three food critics (my kids) agreed and have requested that I not make it again. 
The texture and look was great but  I would not repeat this recipe as there are plenty of other recipes for me to try.

Cut out half the water and half the soy sauce and added about 4x the amount of corn starch and it was still way too liquidy. Had to boil a lot the sauce down and still add more corn starch. I added half a thin sliced onion and also cut the sugar in half as I don't like sweet sauce.

Also no need to steam the broccoli, just mix it in and cook for 30 mins. That way it's a one pot and gets the broccoli gets the flavor of the sauce.

Next time I don't think I'll add any water as plenty comes from the beef and broccoli during cooking.

I made this recipe with 2 1/2 lbs beef and more of all the other ingredients to compensate. Other than that, I made it just as instructed, adding just a little more corn starch as it wasn’t as thick as I wanted, and it was a big hit with our dinner guests!

Cooked on low for 6 hours. Meat fell apart and tasted like pot roast which is a good flavor but not the right consistency for this dish. Sauce did not thicken up enough. Did not precook fresh broccoli but put in during last 30 minutes and would change to about 20. Next time, if there is one, I will try 4 hours on high. Would not make again.

The meal was a hit with the whole family, but we agreed that the sauce was a bit on the sweet side for our tastes.  Next time, I'll cut the sugar at least by half.   That should make it a 5 star recipe.

Made this today and hubby and I really like it. I used low sodium soy sauce and Herb ox beef bouillon. (It is sodium, msg and gluten free,) Thank you for sharing this recipe. Will definitely be making it again. Might try it with chicken next time.

Amazing. The sesame oil was really stinky but it tasted great. I used low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon. I used low sodium soy sauce. I added onion with the meat & added the broccoli & bell peppers with the corn starch. It was amazing & so easy!

This was very good. I used low sodium soy sauce and it was not at all salty. To thicken I used three tbsp of cornstarch. Thumbs up from my expert taster.

I used chicken rather than beef and if I made it again, I would not cook it for as long. I also added Onion and some extra garlic. Delicious dish, better than take out.

This is sooooo good!   The only thing I did differently was add 3 chopped green onions.    My slow cooker cooks really quickly on low.   It was ready after about 4 hours.  The meat was really tender!

I panicked a little when I opened the slow cooker because it didn't look like enough to feed 3 people; however, after adding the broccoli, it was plenty. The family loved this...delicious!

I made this tonight. I followed the recipe except I doubled it and added red pepper flakes per another user. It was very salty, I will probably use low sodium soy next time. I made this in a sauce pan and steamed the broccoli and an onion separate. All in all, delicious. Will make again!

A very tasty, easy recipe.  I followed the recipe as is but I found it more salty than I liked.  The rest of the family, however, gobbled it up - even the not big on broccoli fans!  
The recipe was a really nice addition to a chinese-themed-meal for a family dinner.  I found it was very convenient to have this main dish cooking in the slow cooker when prepping/cooking the rest of the dinner on the stove.

I doubled the ingredients for the gravy. To make it more carb friendly we used riced cauliflower that had shredded carrots, peas, and green onion tips instead of using rice. Then topped it with broccoli spears, and of course the beef with gravy. We loved it more than take out! We’ll make it again.

This did really well. It was delicious. Did a few different things though. For sauce, doubled the recipe (except for brown sugar and soy Sauce amounts - kept the same as original recipe). Added onions in with the beef at beginning. Then half way through, put in sliced mushrooms and carrots. Lastly, with about 30 minutes left (when you bulk out sauce to thicken) thickened sauce and miked in. At that point added 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli florets and let cook in high about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Served over hibachi style noodles (http://www.thecookingjar.com/hibachi-noodles/). It was SO yummy. On the regular menu rotation now.

I cut back on the soy sauce as was suggested by other reviewers and it was still way too salty, almost to the point of being inedible.

One star! My fault!! Put all the ingredients into crockpot like one poster said and The whole meal turned to mush!!  I did not hold the brocolli until last so its strong taste compromised this dish. Don't know I have the patience to make it again!

I was looking for an easy, homemade, broccoli beef dinner and opted for this one.  Since I'm also doing no carb/no sugar I made modifications by leaving out the brown sugar and substituting riced cauliflower.  Liking a bit of spice  i used red pepper flakes as well.  Absolutely delicious.  Definitely going to make this dish again and again.

I did a couple of things differently. I took out water, beef bullion, and corn starch. I sprayed the slow cooker with olive oil, then added slices of 2 Tbs of butter, 2 Tbs of olive oil, 2 tsp of sesame oil on high. Then I chopped 4 cloves & 1 large onion. Then added ground pepper, salt, turmeric. 30 mins later 1/2 cup of red wine. Then I thin sliced 1 of each yellow/red/orange bell peppers. Then the broccoli. 30 mins later, I turned it down to low. Added the sirloin steak and the sauce with 3 cups of beef stock. 45 mins before it is done, I placed Soba stir-fry noodles by Kame.

This is good. I did like other reviewers and substituted 1/2 of the soy with oyster sauce. Would definitely make again.

Sauce flavor was odd. I wouldn’t say it was better than Chinese food at all. The sauce was sweet and not savory. Too much brown sugar for sure. And meat became crumbly. My husband thought it was ok, but maybe should’ve used flank steak and not been made in crock pot. I’ve never had Chinese food where the meat was falling apart. Meat was good, sauce was just odd. It would have to be changed a lot for me to want to make again. It turned out good in a sense, just that sauce was odd!! I can’t say it enough.

My first review!! I was very pleased with this dish and happy that the meat stayed tender and delicious. I went exactly by the recipe with no problems. I'm just learning to cook, but I can say that next time I will also increase garlic, add red pepper flakes, onion etc. That is what will push this dish to something you crave!!!

I did have to add quite a few ingredients that I felt were missing. I added salt (a mistake) to the beef as well as lemon juice,  lemongrass, ginger, hoisin sauce. I subbed the sriracha with chili pepper paste (in a tube at any grocery store). I will use water rather than broth, abd eliminate the brown sugar. I also added some carrots.

I made it for dinner last evening.  Didn't have a large enough piece of meat, so I took advice of other reviewers & added onions, green peppers & more garlic, oh & a little more brown sugar after tasting sauce. I will play with the sauce a wee bit more next time I prepare it, could be improved for our taste.  Served over rice with Asian Slaw. Thanks for the post!

This recipe sounded easy, especially since I could use my slow cooker. After reading the reviews,  I doubled the sauce, used light soy sauce instead of the regular, and substituted canned beef broth for the beef bouillon cubes.

We all loved this dish and put it over Basmati rice. I will be making this again.

Turned out as expected, a little bit hot for me but I am a very mild taste guy. Wife  loved it. The sauce took awhile to thicken, and I would add more meat. I gave it 4 stars for the longer cooking. Time.

loved how the beef turned out and I did add a chopped onion to it in the beginning. the broccoli, however, was not that great. I just threw it in 20min before it was done and the texture wasnt right. Ill try boiling next time. again, the beef was great

Easy? Yes. Smells amazing? Yes. Flavor on point? Not quite. While everything was pretty good, it tasted just a little bit off, like it was missing something but I'm not sure what. I did use low sodium soy sauce and sodium free beef bullion so it wasn't too salty.  Overall, decent quick prep meal.

This is review is for myself. I cut up my steak and put some minced garlic and Dale's Steak Seasoning and a little soy and ground ginger. I let it set for 10 min or so. Then I just fried the meat and here's what I did to the sauce. 1 c. water, 1/2 c soy, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp beef bouillon, some more ginger powder, and a splash of cooking wine, shake of garlic powder, and black pepper. Then after the broccoli was steamed I added it and the sauce. It was good, I don't think i would do the full amount of brown sugar but maybe it would be ok.

Too salty for my taste, but it has great potential and was super easy to make! I think maybe it will be just perfect for me if I try reduced sodium soy sauce and reduced sodium bouillon next time.

Delicious! Added 2-orange peppers and 1/2 sweet onion.  Cooked on high for 3-hours total. After 2.5 hours I added the thickener. Had to double it. Double liquid, double cornstarch. Nice and thick. Yum!

Very very tasty, but I too couldn't get the sauce to thicken no matter what I tried! When I make this again, I will try to reduce the liquid a little to see if that helps. I did use low sodium soy sauce as well as that's what I had on hand. Very yummy! My boys gobbled it up & that makes this a winner in my book.

I agree with other users about how the point of a crock pot is to cook in the crock. There are similar recipes I can make faster, but bearing with that...

Notes to self, broccoli gets cooked pretty perfect after about an hour on high. 6 hrs low and 1 hr high is too much for venison. More sauce would be great.

Followed the recipe with a few additions. Some fresh Onion slices, Fresh mushrooms, and red pepper flakes. Cut the soy sauce in half and used oyster sauce as others suggested. Used corn starch and made a roux when the corstarch failed. Neither was successful in thickening my sauce. Used frozen Broccoli florets. Still amazing and will make again!

Great recipe but I made a few changes.  I went to make this and realized I didn't have enough soy sauce so I used 1/2 cup of the gourmet cooking sauce that starts with a Y. that is soy sauce based instead of the soy sauce and the brown sugar, figuring the sugar grams would be about the same and sodium a little less but figured I could add more soy if necessary. I did saute the meat, I used beef stew meat, after sprinkling with cornstarch in a little oil for a few minutes probably wasn't necessary but I like to do this when I cook meat in the crock pot.  I cooked on low for about 2 1/2 hours then on high for 2 1/2 hours.  I added red pepper, green onion and the broccoli with about 2 hours on high left.

Absolutely delicious! Better than take out because it's your own fresh ingredients. Next time I will double the sauce recipe though. I felt like we needed more sauce.

I did not make this in the crockpot.  I made it on the stove.  I cooked the beef separately, in a pressure cooker.  The sirloin was sooooooo tender.  I can never get stirfry beef tender in a regular pan.

I have never had much luck making Chinese food however I have always had great luck with recipes on this site.  Unfortunately this was a total bust for me.  I prepared it exactly according to the recipes (I did use lower sodium soy sauce) and it was so salty I could not even eat it.  Ended up throwing it away and wasting $10.00 worth of food, which is very disappointing to me.  Hope others had better luck than I.

I followed the directions, but my meat was so over cooked that it totally fell apart. It reminded me of broccoli with beef gravy. And I thought the flavor a tad bland.  Probably won't make it again.

This was a great dish, however I made some changes.  I used Splenda Brown sugar, garlic powder and oriental vegetables.  I also did not make the jasmine rice.  I just didn't have all the ingredients so I punted. Still tasted GREAT!

This is a nice fire-and-forget recipe when you want something Asian. Ingredients are easy to find. You may need to add a little extra corn starch to get the juices to thicken. The type of soy you use will change the overall flavor. Better soy means better flavor retention.

Made it exactly as specified with the exception of using low sodium soy sauce.  We loved the taste and texture.  I will start to play with it now - I want to add onions, I think ,and ginger.  I did not mess with the sugar - the salty/sweet contrast is key in this one.

Turned out great. As others did, I added 1\4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, used 1/4 brown sugar and used 1/4 soya sauce and 1/4 oyster sauce. I also just put the broccoli directly in the slow cooker approx in last 30mins of cooking

This was excellant-I used beef short ribs (all I had in the freezer) and they were extremely tender.  Next time I will add fresh mushrooms.

This came out good with some modifications. First, when I think slow cooker meals I think put everything in the pot and leave it alone - which is what I did. In the last 30 mins I added the cornstarch mixture and frozen broccoli. I also used a mixture of beef and chicken stock. I had to double the recipe and ran out of beef stock and used the rest in chicken stock. I used low sodium soy sauce just in case I needed to add more salt to my family likings. As other reviewers suggested I put some red pepper flakes, black pepper, carrots and onion. Overall this came out good with the suggestions provided by other reviewers so I'm guessing the four star rating is really for the suggestions and not the original recipe. I'm not really sure I how much we would've liked the recipe had I followed the directions exactly. My "slow" cooker cooks really fast so I had to cook the doubled recipe on high for 3 hours. The meat was nice and tender and not falling apart! I also used basmati rice which is what I had available. Will make again.

I did something I've never done and I added my instant rice to the crock pot to cook with the meat. I just added extra water. Worked great! I used instant brown rice. I used stew meat too. We liked this, it was really easy with my short cuts......The second time I made the mistake of using long grain brown rice and I had to add a lot of water and keep it on high for 3 hours to get the rice cooked. Once cooked, I turned it down to low and stirred in thawed broccoli.

So easy and delicious, I'll teach my 13-year-old how to make this! A wee bit salty, may try low-sodium soy sauce next time. Also thought some green onions added to it and peanuts sprinkled on top might be good!

I made this pretty much according to the recipe but had to use Swiss steak since I didn't have any sirloin roast.  I didn't get as much broth because it was so lean so I had to add a little extra beef broth but it was a great use for Swiss steak and was very good.  Husband said to make it again and we have more Swiss steak in the freezer so we'll be having it again.

I used low sodium soy and it was still quite salty, but good.  I started with my sirloin frozen, not sliced, and it was ready in 4-5 hours on low.  I thickened the liquid on the stove, strained it, then sliced the meat and added it to the sauce.  I served the broccoli on the side for my husband.  He said it was a good recipe.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!! I used low-sodium soy sauce with top round steak and half of an onion, diced.  When I took some of the broth out to cook I added sliced water chestnuts and baby corn. Made cornstarch slurry to thicken broth on stove then added back to the rest of ingredients. Added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to cut the sweetness and kick it up a bit.   Next time I will use a little less brown sugar.

We liked this recipe, thank you. I followed the directions exactly. Was a bit too sweet for our taste. If I make it again in the future, I'd reduce the sweetener, or perhaps adjust the soy sauce. Served it with green salads & warmed up 12 grain dinner rolls. It was quick to assemble in the crock pot which I appreciated.

Delicious and full of flavor. Loved how quick & easy the prep was. I used a chuck roast, cut into pieces...about 2.5 lbs for a double recipe. I kept everything else the same except I used half the amount of soy sauce (1/2 cup per double recipe) to reduce the saltiness mentioned by other reviewers and thought that was the perfect amount. I also omitted the sesame oil (personal preference). For the broccoli I just threw in 2 blocks of 10 oz  chopped frozen broccoli (double recipe) about an hour before I wanted it ready to serve and gave it an occasional stir. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to follow recipe. Had used only half of what was recommended for the soy sauce and only 1 pound of beef and it still came out tasting great. One I will keep under my favorites. I would probably add the broccoli in the Crockpot at the end.

I made this as is. It was ok at best. It had an amazing smokey smell, though-- my daughter and I were very excited to try it. Being Asian, I prefer my Asian-inspired foods to taste atleast a little bit familiar. My daughter said it tasted like teriyaki beef jerky, and she was spot on. I gave it 3 stars because my daughter at least ate it.

This has a lot more steps than you would usually find a slow cooker meal - usually I would expect to dump all the ingredients into the crock, turn it on and forget about it until dinner time. This is not one of those recipes.
That being said, we enjoyed this meal. I did toss in some carrots for color, but otherwise made no big changes. I used regular soy sauce, the entire ½ cup called for, and did not find it to be overly salty for our tastes. This was a great dinner for a busy evening and I will make it again.

This is a bit more labor intensive than most slow cooker meals, but worth it. I would add liquid smoke (as PF Changs does) to give it a bit more flavor.

Followed the recipe except added 1/4 c. brown sugar instead of 1/3 c. Very good flavor. Beef turned out a little on the dry side, but this is nothing that would stop me from making it again and reducing the cooking time.

I was not a fan of how salty it came out. I used a leaner sirloin for the beef, and it fell apart in the slow cooker. So i will be making some adjustments for the next time.

Made this tonight. We typically like this type of food, but because of the extremely high salt content, none of us were able to finish it.

Followed the recipe.  I think it was good but salty.  I will use less of the soy sauce next time around. Will definitely be making this again.

Yummmm-o!  It was a hit at our table. Next time I am going to add water chestnuts, mushrooms and some red pepper flakes for a little heat

I used garlic salt rather than garlic cloves and used regular vegetable oil instead of sesame oil. It tasted fantastic. I also made some Chinese donuts to go with it.

This was really good but salty and the sauce was not as thick as I would have liked. I used far free low sodium beef broth and low sodium soy sauce. Will definitely make it again.
