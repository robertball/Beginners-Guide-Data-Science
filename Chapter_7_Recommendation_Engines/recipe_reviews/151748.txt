DEVINE!  i can't even begin to say how good this was.  perfectly creamy.  i used about 30 oreos because, well, i like oreos.  i made it in a 10 inch springform pan, baked for 65 minutes then turned off the oven and let cool in oven for 1 hour.  no cracks.  i put in fridge overnight, then topped with the Chocolate Ganache from this site.  Took out of fridge 2 hours before serving.  Absolutley wonderful!!

Wow this was great!  I have never made a cheesecake before and this was so easy and turned out perfectly!  The only change I made was increased the crust by half, using 27 Oreos (with chocolate filling instead of white) and upped the butter to 3T.  I did this so that I could have the crust go up the sides of the pan rather than just the bottom.  Everyone loved it!  I did drizzle it with a little ganache for decoration purposes.  Will definitely make again!  I do recommend when the cake is done cooking, that you turn the oven off and let the cake sit in there for a few hours.  This prevents cracks from forming.  Highly recommend everyone to try this!

Very good.  Maybe the next time I make this it will be even better, and rate five stars.  I used about 24 oreos, and a 10" springform pan.  Baked at 300 for 55 minutes. It was a little overdone, it cracked and was a little dry.  I'll try 50 minutes next time.
I covered the cheesecake with the chocolate topping from Chocolate Cheesecake II.  1/4 cup cream, heated to near boiling, then stir in 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips,  1 t. vanilla until smooth, spread on top.  Nice way to hide the crack.

This was well worth the extra work - Some of the reviews complained how the carmel was hard to cut so I just added an extra tablespoon of melted butter and I did not have a problem.  I also liked the comment about baking and then turning off the oven for three hours - I did not have any cracks.  I also made the fabulous Hot Fudge Sauce from this site and covered the top and let it drizzle down the sides after it was baked - really rich but then if you are going to eat chocolate that is the way it is supposed to be.  I let this sit in refrigerator overnight and took out about 3 hours before serving and it was perfect to cut and enjoy.

Awesome recipe! Very rich and chocolatey.

I used more Oreos (probably about 22) and melted chocolate and strawberries for a topping.

I will definitely use this again!

My first cheesecake to ever come out looking perfect. The taste is truly decadent and chocolaty. The texture is dense and smooth. The only complaint is there was not enough cookie crumb mixture to go all the way up the side of the pan. Next time I will increase the crust by half.

Awesome!  I have made this several times.  For that extra zing, get a jar of the magic shell ice cream topping and put on top!  Make sure the cake is good and cold and then refrigerate immediately.  I also put mini choc chips in the magic shell before it hardens.  People will love you and hate you at the same time!

This cheesecake is fabulous. I split the topping in two - half made with plain chocolate, and half made with white chocolate. Then I created a swirl/marble effect with them in the tin...delicious!!

I thought this was good, but it wasn't something that made me think, "Wow!"  Also, it wasn't my favorite cheesecake texture.  Perhaps, it was my cooking skills or lack there of.  I did like how simple the ingredient list was and how easy it was to prepare.  That bumped it up to 4 stars.  :)
