The ingredients in this dish made for a tasty dinner. However, it sounds like this recipe was adapted from a traditional recipe and needs some tweaking for the sous vide technique. 

First, obviously the final product will not reach 165. Ignore that detail. 


Next, individual plastic bags won't work for Ziploc users- more filling would probably end up outside the chicken than in. I rolled each individual breast in plastic wrap, making a tight bundle. Then I placed all the bundles into a single gallon-sized Ziploc. It worked great, and the rolls  cooked completely intact. 


Finally, sous vide chicken looks pretty unappetizing without a stove finish. After cooking, I sprinkled some additional cajun seasoning on the outside and browned the rolls on two sides in frying pan. They looked stunning sliced up!

The previous review pointed out that 141 water will not give 165 meat. It was fine. A little more temp may set the stuffing better. It needs pan seer to present. I needed to use smaller breasts so when they are pounded it stays together.  Taste was good. Practice will make perfect.

Although the previous writer was correct about the stove finish, remember chicken does not need to get to 165 in a sous vide to be considered safe. I had issues with that when I first used my sous vide and researched it extensively (since it goes against what we learned growing up).  A stove finish makes this meal really good
