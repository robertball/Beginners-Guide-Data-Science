I didn't use a Juiceman, just an old-fashioned hand juicer. Very lemony-lemon drop. And just the right amount of sweet. Good stuff.

I was searching around on this site for a vodka drink and found this tasty drink. Very nice lemon drop, allows you to make it as sweet as you desire.

This was very tasty. It's a new drink for me, and I needed a little extra sweetness for my personal taste, but the recipe does allow for that. I used simple syrup in place of sugar and it worked well. I also used yellow sugar on the rim of my glass. Thanks for a great recipe!

I may have gotten my hands on some unusually tart lemons, but it took closer to 3 Tablespoons of sugar to make this sweet enough for us and we do not like sweet drinks.  After fiddling with the sugar amount it still didn't have that smooth flavor that I have enjoyed when I have has a lemon drop while out, so I added some cointreau and that seemed to take a bit of the edge off.

If you want it sweeter use 2 oz vodka, 1 oz, sour mix, and 1 oz 7-up then add your lemon juice, no triple sec.

Drink was harsh, I like a smoother drink. It lacked something.  What I don't know?

Not bad, I made exactly as written.  Actually squeezed the lemons so it was a bit tart.  May add just a little extra sugar next time.

This was pretty good. It was a little too sour for my taste, but not as sour as some lemon drops I have had.
