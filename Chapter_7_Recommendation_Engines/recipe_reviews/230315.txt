I pretty much followed the recipe as is, with the one exception of using quick cooking whole grain rice. It cut the cooking time down to about 15 minutes and it was great! My husband asked that I definitely keep this recipe around. Very easy and seems like a good recipe to try variations with to keep it fresh. I added the picture so others can see how good it looks!

This is a wonderful rendition of Hoppin John!  I've made this as the recipe directed for New Years Day, as per Southern Tradition. This dish is so yummy, it has the power for good luck AND  for converting folks that do not like black-eyed peas! Thanks for a great recipe...

This has become a family favorite.  We usually crock-pot it.  I added some left over ham last time and that added a nice flavor.  I've shared it with a number of folks, who all are making it now!

Perfect one-dish meal to start the New Year! I used a full pound of sweet Italian sausage, added extra onion, celery and red pepper because I wanted more veggies. Didn't have Cajun spices, so I used Pirate Mike's Blackened Fish Seasoning (Ft. Myers, FL). It was delicious--and not too spicy. Didn't need salt and pepper at all. Thanks for what will become a staple around our house!

Easy & versatile. I almost had all the ingredients for this & was looking for a recipe to use black-eyed peas. I used smoked beef sausage diced up in place of the bulk sausage, diced tomatoes without green Chiles, long grain brown rice, a yellow bell pepper and Emerils BAM seasoning with a pinch of cayenne in place of the Cajun seasoning because it's what I happened to have on hand. Followed instructions as written and it came out perfect. Great belly-warming dinner on a cold Feb nite. Plus with a 45 min simmer time I got a nice little workout on the treadmill!

This is delicious! I made it as is, except I used white rice. Bc Of the cooking time differences of white/brown rice, I let it simmer with a lid for only 12 minutes and the. Turned the heat off for 20 min. Rice is perfect! Also, served with parmigiana cheese. Delicious!

I've made Hoppin John for years with many recipes and different ways (crock pot etc.) and this is my favourite.  It was so easy (no soaking the peas overnight) and fast and just delicious.  I love the addition of tomatoes, and Cajun spice...it gave it a "jambalaya" twist.  The sausage I used was a "Rye Whiskey & Black Pepper" flavour and I added four strips of cooked bacon, cut into pieces and it all came together beautifully.  This is a keeper.

So good! I used my pressure cooker to reduce the time. in the cooker, I saute'ed the meat, veggies, seasonings together, added the tomatoes, beans, broth and rice along with one smoked hamhock. I used the rice cooker option in my cooker (12 mins at high, natural steam release). It was a little soupy when the cooker was done, so I just set it to saute' and let it cook down some more. When all was done, I stirred in a shiny penny for extra good luck on New Year's Day! My friend found it and I expect good things for him in 2019 :) This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

I followed the recipe except used mild Italian sausage. Plus increased the water since I used chicken bouillon cubes. Glad I did it took about 10 minutes longer for the rice to get done than the recipe said. I would cut the Cajun seasoning in half as it was on the verge of too spicy. We canâ€™t do spicy at all anymore.

Here it is 40 minutes away from my New Year 2019 and I am reviewing a recipe. My background is a transplanted guy from NJ who has now lived in TX for about 30 years and had never heard of the blackeyed pea tradition on New Years for good luck. Well, you speak of blackeyed peas here and there is no getting around "Hoppin' John"  as the primary way to serve them. With the name of the dish, it seemed to me that it should be at least lively. In all my time here, all the recipes I came upon just turned out to be "Limping John" at best (some just "Stumblin' John" of "John  On His Knees Not Able to Go On After Celebrating"), I really did like this change of pace from all my other attempts. I followed instructions almost exactly (I usually do it to a tee If I would dare to review as given). I upped the garlic by two more cloves since that is my bent, ahem. I also went to the market and could not find anything labeled "Cajun Seasoning" except for a huge canister of Ragin' Cajun brand which was more than I would need before it probably would spoil so I opted for well known Creole Seasoning which you probably all know about. In any case, the end product was delicious and I am saving this one for New Years to come.

I added some smoked ham hocks diced up. Fantastic!
