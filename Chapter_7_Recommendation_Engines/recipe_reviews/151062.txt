I've used Alton Brown's turkey brine recipe for 3 years.  While his is great, this one is better!  Easy to put together, much more economical and the taste was fabulous.  I brine turkeys in a 5 gallon bucket with a lid.  I reduce the liquid in the recipe and put ice in the bucket after placing the turkey in it.  I set the bucket in the garage and in the cooler months the ice stays frozen overnight and well into the next day.  In the warmer months I add ice as needed.

WOW.  I used a 7 pound chicken instead of a turkey for this recipe, roasted it in a roasting bag according to the instructions, then served it with some Brazilian-style black beans and rice with traditional fixings.  Everyone said it was the best chicken they had ever had!  Incredibly moist and great flavor.

I also put the fruit and bay leaves in the cavity when I roasted it for maximum flavor.  This recipe is a MUST try.

I have brined in the past but this recipe was fantastic this Thanksgiving. I will use this again. The turkey was so moist. I stuffed the turkey with an orange, lemon and an onion. I massaged melted butter all over and salt & peppered inside and out. Go easy on the salt. Make sure you rinse the turkey real well before and after brining. Debra

Amazing! I was an absolute hit at the dinner table all thanks to this recipe. I brined the turkey for 48hrs, washed it out and let it sit for an hour while preparing the stuffing. Then I put my Martha Stuart reading materials to use and stuffed the bird with help of a cheese cloth. Shortly after I lathered my hands up with butter and went to work on the bird. We squeezed a bunch of lemon on it when all was buttered & ready to cook. Then, I based it a few times while cooking, but not all that frequently. The brining really kept the bird sufficiently moist and tender without the nuisance of constant basting.

Both the dark and white meat was extremely moist and tender. My family were truly amazed and we will definitely do this again next year! (now that they know what brining is)*

i used this recipe on a grocery store brand of 13# turkey that I paid $3.27 for! The turkey was moist and had a delicous flavor.  I only brined it for 14 hours because I started late.  I'll never hesitate again to purchase a "store brand" turkey knowing that brining really works!

This is a very forgiving recipe. It allows for a slight(and I mean slight) citrus taste but what it really does is help to keep the bird nice a moist while cooking. I made it once and all I had was pink lemonade concentrate and my family loved it(my husband is a chef mind you) So go ahead and brine!!!!! It makes meat that can tend to be dry much, much juicier. Enjoy and play with the flavors...any kind of juice is nice

I have shared this recipe several times.  Quick hint:  When cooking the brine use half the water and the rest with ice to speed up the process.  I give a quick rinse

I made this in a smaller proportion for a chicken.  It was a hit with my in-laws, and they asked for the recipe.  I left it in the brine for 24 hours,and I basted the chicken with butter while it was roasting.  It didn't have a strong orange flavor, but just enough flavor to make it interesting to the taste buds.

OMG!  YOU HAVE TO BRINE UR TURKEY!  I brine all of my turkey, chicken and cornish game hens.  This recipe is wonderful!  Roll the oranges, lemons & limes on the counter to release the oils before you put them in the brine!  I will be brining 6 game hens this Friday and this is my go to recipe!  LOVE IT!  Better than Alton Brown's in my opinion...

Very nice and easy brine for our smoked turkey.  Couldn't taste the fruit, but our meat was so juicy and flavorful.  I added lots of fresh rosemary, and some cajun seasoning.  Will try using apple juice next time, and a cup of brown sugar as that's how I usually do our brine.

My turkey came out nice and moist. I'm almost entirely happy with this recipe. The only thing I don't like is that it gets heated and needs to be cooled. To cool this safely within proper time and temperature constraints takes too much time, attention, ice, and patience than I really had on Wednesday. I wonder whether this wouldn't be equally effective without the heating step. If you're happy to do that extra work, I'd say you'll be happy with this recipe, just as I was. Next time, however, I'm going to seek out another recipe for brining.

This year I'm making this brine AGAIN. Last year my turkey came out nice and moist and it was the best turkey I've ever had ever. The only thing I changed was used 1 can of frozen lemonaid. My whole family raved about how this was the best turkey.

I used this recipe for my Thanksgiving Turkey and was stunned at how moist and tender the breast was!  Wife and I loved the hint of citrus and the turkey the ease of the whole process.  I will brine every chicken or turkey from now on.

This Turkey Brine was sooo good! My turkey was so flavorful and juicy it was the best I've made yet. I added 32oz of chicken broth and a few sprigs of thyme, rosemary and sage and it gave it that much more flavor...I will definitley use this again!

This was the first time I ever brined or roasted a turkey. The breast was incredibly moist. It was my favorite!   Restaurant supply stores were closed when I was ready to brine so I bought a 5 gallon container with a lid at Home Depot (versus a food grade container), a brine bag & a bag of ice. I separated the brine bag from the container with ice, as much as possible and refilled it only once before going to bed since it was a cool night.  I used Alton Brown (Food Network) shorter brining times (8-16 hours) and easy cooking methods. Inserting a thermometer is key for newbies like me!  The brining liquid took about 3 hours to cool down so I will make it earlier next time.  I was scared of a moist but flavorless turkey, so I massaged the turkey (under the skin) with a paste of garlic, oregano & a little canola oil right before roasting.  It turned out great. I will make it on Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is an amazing brine.  I have used it years past and it never fails.  I doubled the ingredients for a 24 lb turkey.  I will make a note on the citrus.  If you boil the citrus with the other spices at the same time, some of the volatile (read flavorful) oils may deteriorate and become bitter.  I add the citrus after boiling the other ingredients while the solution is still quite warm in order to bring the flavors together.  I brine the turkey for about 18 hours.  There is a very delicate citrus flavor to the bird that does not overwhelm.  Be cautious about overcooking.  Brining really does shorten the cooking time.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I quess I was expecting a little more flavor in the meat than what I got. I even added an extra orange inside the bird with some fresh thyme and parsley, but this was not what I was looking for. Yes, the bird was a little moist but not that moist. This was a bit of a dissapointment. Sorry

I've been cooking turkeys for 35 years and this one was the best.  We were camping with friends when I used this recipe.  Cooked the bird on our gas grill in an open roasting pan.  The bird was done a little earlier than I thought and was just GORGEOUS.  People came from all over the group site to take pictures of the beautiful, golden brown bird.  SO tender and yummy.  I rinsed the bird before rossting, so not too salty, just juicy.  We won't be using the bags again when camping.

I thought this was a great brine, and I would use it again.  I've brined my turkeys for years now, but I generally use a little more Kosher salt to the amount of liquid (it doesn't make it "salty"), and this turkey was not quite as moist.  Next time, I'll just add a little more Kosher salt.  Thanks!

With all the very positive reviews I was hoping to be blown away by this. I wasn’t. It wasn’t bad but it just didn’t work for us. I might use it again in the summer if I was grilling a chicken but the sweet taste of the orange seem to overwhelm the turkey. I don’t care for a sweet taste in my leftover turkey sandwiches or turkey salad.

I've made this brine for years and we've edited the recipe over time. Now using more bay leaves, less salt (3/4 cup), and more oranges and it is a family favorite.

Since I tried this brine recipe several years ago, I won't make a turkey without it! I put the brine and turkey in a stock pot inside a rolling cooler and keep ice packed around it for about 2 days. I rinse the bird well before drying and loosely stuff the turkey with a quartered onion, a couple of garlic cloves, a sprig or two of fresh rosemary and one or two chopped lemons, limes or oranges, depending on what I have. The gravy from the drippings is the BEST!

First time I bribed a turkey. It was so juicy and definitely a guest pleaser. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is my go-to brine recipe. I will sometimes add ruby red grapefruit in addition to the orange slices.

I used around 4 sliced Mandarin Oranges, a tablespoon of Crushed Red Pepper Flakes,  and threw in 3 really thick cut slices of Fresh Pineapple to this recipe and it turned out absolutely FANTASTIC! We brined a Duck for over 2 days and deep-fryed it for Thanksgiving, and everyone LOVED IT!

Made this for Thanksgiving and I was pretty happy with it. I cooked the turkey in an oven bag though and it captured too much salt so my gravy was very salty...

This was the best turkey I’ve ever made. I cooked it at 350° in an oven bag to a temperature of 160°. Cooking it to 180 would have overcooked it.   I did however, slather herb butter and all over and inside the skin.  After Thanksgiving I took the entire carcass , including all of the drippings, and put them in a pot and cooked them overnight to make turkey soup. Do not add salt to this as you will not need it.  This turkey was so  incredibly moist it was wearing a raincoat out of the oven...lol.

I brined for 36 hours. Before I put on my Big green egg to smoke, I cut two oranges in half and stuffed them in the cavity, cut side touching bird. After smoking on BGE for 5 hours at 250’ to 275’ I pulled, carved and squeezed juice from the oranges al over the meat. 20 lb Turkey, 6 people and I only had enough left for 4 turkey sandwiches. Nuff said.

Brined a chicken instead of turkey. Delicious and the moistest bird we've ever eaten. A great combination of flavors with hints of citrus throughout. It was so good we're doing two this weekend!

I use the recipe with just a little bit of a brown sugar based dry rub I make. Brine it 3 days then smoke the bird. 25+lb turkeys take this brine VERY well

Turkey was great even though I forgot to add all the spices.  I was told by family that it was the best messed up turkey they ever tasted.  Next time I'll try all the spices, not just the citrus.

Made this last Thanksgiving. My wife (Chinese) loved it. She wants me to make it again for a group of her friends who are coming to visit. Of course, she'll be making all the Chinese dishes, but if she likes my turkey well enough to want to show it off, who am I to argue!

I have done this turkey brine every year for the past 4 years!  It is the BEST!  Turkey comes out so juicy and love the beautiful orange tinted color it gives!  Thank you to whomever shared this recipe!  Everyone that has been over to our turkey dinners has just raved about it!

This brine is by far the best I've ever used! I used it for a chicken instead of turkey and the results were great. I stuffed the chicken with onion and orange wedges, rubbed it with a generous amount of butter, and squeezed orange juice over the chicken a few times while roasting. It ended up with just the right amount of citrus flavoring.

This made the BEST turkey I or my Chef have ever had.  I tweeked it a touch because I didn't use fresh fruit, I used juice and swapped the thyme for coriander.  I let it thaw, in the brine, neck up with the OJ concentrate thawing on the open cavity for 5 days.  Unbelieveable.  Thank you to whomever came up with this idea.  I am now queen of turkey around here and it was so easy I think I'll hang on to that title for a good long time!
