Go Steve! This is a true Maryland Blue Crab recipe! In fact, I just cooked up a 1/2 bushel of Chincoteague Bay crabs with the same ingredients, except the salt, since these crabs are raised in the saltier Atlantic Ocean water then the Chesapeake blue crab. Do what he said, then put out some cider vinegar and Bay Seasoning for dipping and you have a real Maryland crab feast. Oh yeah, beer is traditional with it too!

This is the best method for blue crabs and is how my family has always cooked them. I don't add the salt, doesn't seem important. Make sure to serve with individual bowls of melted butter for dipping!

As a true Marylander I can say that this is the best way to eat crabs! Steaming crabs really makes for a superior crab meat (as opposed to boiling them). I like a little less vinegar in my beer mix, and a little less salt. This made for a perfect Eastern Shore 4th of July with some silver queen corn, watermelon, beans and tomatoes!

I would just add one note:  Here on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, we layer the crabs with seasoning - one layer of crabs, a generous amount of Old Bay and course ground salt, then the next layer of crabs and seasoning.  Here ub Maryland we take our crabs seriously and it is more than a feast, it's a social event.

**DISCLAIMER**You must like old bay to like this recipe.   I do love the use of beer, it tastes so rich and infuses so much flavor into the crabs. I have also steamed crabs with beer, garlic, and a sprinkling of old bay which was a huge crowd pleaser.

Boiling crabs should be a crime. I grew up in Maryland and remember my father making blue crabs this same way. The only difference, when adding crabs to the pot, he would sprinkle Old Bay and kosher salt on crabs with each layer. Da Bomb! Remember folks, it's gotta be Old Bay. Except no substitute ! Dip in mixture of Vinegar and Season-All (season salt) or Old Bay. What a Maryland treasure. Thanks Steve for posting.

Right on time.!! Skipped the salt due to the crabs being from the gulf and the dead of summer. I added a little Zatarians shrimp and crab boil to the pot with the Old bay, also added a couple of smashed cloves of garlic and a little lemon juice. Every one really enjoyed them, Must have as there was none left.

Awesome recipe-I used it to steam Tilapia instead and it came out wonderful. I cut the recipe down to 1/3 of all of the ingredients listed because I only had a 1/2lb. of fish. I steamed for 8 minutes and the fish was moist, but flaky. This is a good alternative cooking method for fish that would otherwise disintegrate on a grill.

Classic -- This recipe was spot on!  Please....I beg of all potential users of this recipe.  DO NOT skimp on the seasoning.
There is nothing worse, seafood speaking, than unseasoned crabs.  BORING!
