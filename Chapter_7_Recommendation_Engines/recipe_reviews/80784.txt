This was excellent! I was really curious when I saw the recipe, so I had to try it. Sooo good!. I think maybe the recipe should say one large avacado/two small, because I used one rather small avacado (that's all they had at the store) and the mixture was a little bit soupy and a little on the sweet side, so I think if there was more avacado in the mixture it would have been perfect. It was still really tasty though!

This may seem weird to a lot of americans.  But being asian, this is a regular dessert for us.  I usually don't add the vanilla extract because the ripe avocado has a lot of flavor already.  But it's still a good recipe.  Everyone should try it!

Are you kidding me? This is incredible! I have been eating this plain all night, however I bet it would be delish on top of some vanilla ice cream. Take a chance and try this, like I did! You will be amazed.

MmmMmm!

Avocados were on sale so we bought a whole bunch, and I needed things to make with them.

This was very light, super easy, and REALLY good!  I made some changes, using soy milk instead of regular milk, and halving the sugar and the vanilla.  It was not overpowering at all, but rather just sweet enough!

This will probably become one of my regular snacks =).

Delish, Except I felt it needed something else so I added 1/4 cup of cocoa, it turned into a deep creamy chocolatey pudding.

I was shocked!!! It's so good. Of course, I substituted a few things though. I used 1 TBSP of organic maple syrup instead of the sugar. Then, I used almond milk instead of cow's milk. DELICIOUS!!!

Awesome!  In Indonesia we have this all the time in a tall glass cup drizzled first with chocolate sweetened condensed milk and a few ice cubes blended in.  You could try just syrup or cocoa and some sweetened condensed milk.  Sometimes I like it just with the avocado and other times I stir in the chocolate from the side and bottom of the cup.    I thought it was a weird idea, but love avocados so had to give it a try.  I'm glad I did, cause it was yummy and refreshing, and not too sweet.  And the avocado oil is really good for you.   Soemtimes I blend avocado and vanilla icecream (Costco super premium or Haagen-daaz) and refreeze a few minutes if it is a hot day.  I leave a few frozen lumps that taste like butter.   So good!

This is weird but good! I "creamed" the avocado with sugar and vanilla extract in a food processor and then gradually added soy milk until it was a pudding consistency.  I put some whipped cream on top and its perfect! My husband keeps staring at it like he wants some but he's too weirded out by the green color! I think its a pretty green.

I loved this...2 of my kids did too. I think my other 2 were more put off that i put sugar in with avocados. But I guess you can totally say, you ought to really love avocados to really venture into a treat like this. I make an avocado pie that's a real delight and all my kids truely love that recipe. The kids really were put off with this one. Myself. I totally loved it. I doubled the batch because I needed to use 2 avocados up seriously fast. So as I made this, I added the sugar and extract to the avocados 1st and slowly added the milk in. But as I put it in, I stopped half way, and decided I loved the thickness that was developing rather nicely and didn't add the last 1/2 cup. I used a hand blender, so the texture was smooth and nice. I really and truely loved this recipe. So I'm not sharing with anyone. And I did use a sugar replacement in this recipe for myself. And it work great. Thanks Craig, I love it.

Yum. I wasn't too fond of the consistency once I mixed it up, so I ended up sticking it in the freezer, stirring about every 20 minutes to make some really super yummy ice cream!!!

This is wonderful if you love avocado! I made this exactly as directed. Very rich, a little sweet. If you know how to peel & pit an avocado the prep time is 5 minutes, not 20! :) I'm going to make this again & experiment with adding a little lemon or lime juice for a touch of acidity. Also, I want to thicken the texture a bit for serving so I'm going to portion out the servings & chill in the FREEZER for 20 minutes, not the fridge. Thanks for sharing!

This was darn tasty...I didn't put vanilla extract in...just didn't sound like it would fit... and cut way back on the sugar as the avocados are plenty sweet enough..... who would have thought to make a pudding out of avocado :)

From others reviews and my own instinct, I cut back on the sweetness. To make it sweet, I used 1/4 c. frozen bananas (I always keep frozen bananas in my fridge for smoothies) and 2 tbsp honey. With these changes, it was pretty good. The texture reminds me of melted ice cream. Very smooth.

Awesome, this is a regular dessert in Philippines too. You can add some crushed ice also. What was weird for a lot of us when we moved to the USA, was finding out that avocado was used in salads and was used like a vegetable. Avocado is a fruit.

I added coconut milk (half coconut, half whole milk) and used brown sugar (about half of the required amount). It was very creamy and very delicious!

I love this recipe! I changed it slightly by using Splenda granular instead of white sugar and it tastes really good! So glad I found this recipe, I had an avocado and milk to get rid of and this used up both! Will be sharing with the girls at work.

We didn't love it.  It was ok enough to eat, but not to make again.  I gave it 3 stars though because we are dairy free and made it with almond milk, so that may be the difference.

I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this recipe, although I seem to be the only one who does (besides my 10 month old grandaughter).  I guess you really have to love the taste of avocado.  The only thing though, I did use about half the amount of sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  Very good...a real treat!

Seriously if people don't like avacados then don't bother, but I LOVED it!  It was such a nice change from normal.  Thanks for the great idea!

instead of using all that sugar, I add an apple, or frozen banana /W/ avocado & it's really good . I rather have natural sweet from the other fruit instead of sugar. But yet, that's me

I decided to try this and I am so glad I did.  Rich and creamy, just delicious.  I did go about it slightly differently because I didn't want the avocado to turn brown.  I refrigerated it about 2 hours before I used it and made sure my milk was very cold.  I only used about 1/4 cup of milk and 1/8 cup of sugar.  I would also use less vanilla the next time, but that is just personal taste.  Thanks Craig, this is a treat!

Hey everybody, listen to Craig and his mom!  This is good stuff!  It is easy to make and really very tasty.  I served mine chilled, with a dallop of whipped cream and some almond slivers, just to make it a little fancier for my guests.  They loved it!

We all tried it and were surprised at how good it tasted, yet no one wanted to go back for more. We didn't care for it on vanilla ice cream--the flavor got lost. Would I make it again?  I don't know, but I'm really glad to have tried it once.

Too much sugar and vanilla for my taste, but that can be tweaked. This can also be a way to get kids to eat avocado (just use alot less sugar)

I found this interesting, but a bit boring.  I had substituted Splenda for sugar, so I added a touch of honey.  I happened to have some ground pastachio nuts, so I added some of those, and then a shot of vanilla flavoured liquer.  Very good with those additions.  Had I had cardamom, I would have added that as well, to give it more of an Indian-type of quality.

Sorry - didn't go for this at all!  The kids would both only eat one tsp and I thought it had a very strong avocado aftertaste.  Decided green is also not a good colour for a dessert! (my 3 yr old son said, "it doesn't look very nice, Mom!"  But thanks Craig for the recipe - it's fun trying new things.

This is delicious! I bought a bag of avacados from my local wholesale club that were really large and almost too creamy for what I had planned to use them for. They were perfect in this. Since, I have not tried a dessert recipe with avacado except for chocolate pudding I decided to follow the recipe exactly. It tasted like a mix between vanilla and butterscotch pudding, but looked like pistachio pudding. I definitely recommend it fresh made only though. The next day, I could slightly taste an avacado aftertaste. However, I used a large avacado and only got 2 small servings anyway. ty

I added lemon juice and zest for a little kick and Blue Agave as my sweetener. Next time I might try almond or pistachio extract instead of vanilla. I also look forward to trying it with coconut milk. Tasty!

I tried it as is (I like to taste it as it was intended first time). It was good. I liked it and it was refreshing. I think this would be great during summer days.

Next time I'll experiment with chocolate like most people here have suggested and maybe try some other things too. Possibly mint?...

I added some mint leaves and a half of a peeled lime to the milk, sugar, and vanilla extract.  I blended this first for a few seconds in the food processor, then added the avocado and blended again.  Amazing!!  A perfect summer dessert!

I loved this! Definitely an interesting taste at first, but very delicious. Was a big hit at our avocado-themed book/food club :) Used 3 medium avocados and doubled everything else.  I also used a splenda/sugar blend instead of plain white sugar.

This was 'interesting.' I can't say I loved it, but it wasn't too bad either - one of those things that's kind of hard to describe and maybe it's an 'acquired' taste over time. I was so curious, I had to try it. I did cut the recipe in half to try.

This is popular in Asia and once you get over the culture shock, it's very good. I've had a variation of this since I was small: 1/2 avocado, 3/4-1 cup of milk, and condensed milk to taste (the vanilla would compete with the flavour of the avocado). I usually mash it with a spoon so there are still chunks left - I prefer the chunky consistency. Try it! After all, avocados are fruits.

This is amazingly good.  What I used to do was mixing the avocado with chocolate syrup, a bit of water, and ice cubes, but the chocolate tended to overpower the avocado taste.  I used this recipe without adding vanilla, and it was just perfect.  Thank you for sharing this.  :)

Simple and delicious! I substituted milk with soy milk and used honey instead of milk and sugar and it was still great. It's hard to make a fruit that tastes like butter to not taste good though!

This is really smooth, creamy, and just the right amount of sweet.  I did make one mistake and didn't mash the avocado enough and there were some clumps but won't make that mistake again.  My 7 year old loves it.  Will make again and may try adding the cocoa that someone else suggested!

Not being a huge fan of avocado, I was apprehensive about trying this recipe.  I didn't need to worry. I made it for guests and everyone went back for seconds.  I brought the leftovers to my in-law's and even my "picky-eater" father-in-law said it was good. This dessert is amazingly good as a topping on vanilla ice cream.   But any leftover really shines as the main ingredient in a milkshake. (just add a banana and some vanilla frozen yogourt and you're set).

We were quite impressed with this simple and delicious dessert.  We have been on a high-vegetable diet.  Therefore, at the end of our light meal, this rich dessert seemed positively decadent.

I was actually pretty disappointed with this recipe. I thought I would really enjoy it because I LOVE avocados, but this was not to my liking. Reminded me of a super sweet/vanilla guacamole. Some people might like it, but I think I’m going to have to pass on making it again. Thanks though…

I am a huge fan of avocados, so I thought I had to give this a try.  Avocados were actually on sale for once so I figured there would be no better time.  It wasn't horrible, but I couldn't get over the mindset that avocado should not be a dessert (and the green color didn't help either).  To me Avocados belong in any dish that isn't dessert.  I will not be making this again, but I can see how some people would like it very much.

I prepared this recipe using skim milk and 2 tbls of splenda instead of the 1/4 c white sugar.  It was delicious and a hit at the party! People used it to dip their nacho chips, or used it as a fruit dip! Yummy and healthy! Thanks Craig!

This was really good! I was surprised, and even my mom liked it.  I am on an anti-candida diet, so I substituted these things: Stevia (three packets), coconut milk- more than called for, unsweetened shredded coconut and sliced almond.

Yum! I have always loved Indonesian avocado juice but since you use plain milk instead of sweetened condensed milk, it is easier for me to make with left over avocado since I don't usually have condensed milk at home. It also seems a little more nutritious. My kids loved it, too. I made it as per recipe for my 9 month old. It was nice and thick. For my 3 year old I added more milk to make a kind of avocado smoothie. Both loved it, even when I reduced the sugar a bit. I also omitted the vanilla extract as I love the avocado taste. I plan to make this often.

Hmmm this was very different. Kinda yummy and yucky at the same time. On the plus side, my 4 year old loved it.... dipped apple slices in it. Guess it was a good way to sneak avocados in to her;)

Delicious! I used 2 small avocados & it was like a pudding...One large would have made a syrup.  You can always just add more milk (I used Vanilla Soy Milk) if it's too thick.  Flavor is very good to eat alone or over ice cream.

I LOVED this recipe. My two year old loves avocados. I decided to try this recipe (which i rarely do) and it was great. I gave it a four only because it was sweeter then i like..but thats just a personal preference. Next time i will just gradually add the sugar.

Organic avocadoes were on sale so I had a bunch. I made this the first time with a little travel blender. It wasn't strong enough to smooth it fully, so there were chunks of avocado that I found unappetizing, but the flavor was GREAT. I made it again the next night with a full-size blender and it was extremely smooth, creamy and delicious. Now that I have a quick and tasty use for avocadoes I am definitely going to buy them more often! Next time I will try and leave it chilled in the freezer for a while, I think it would add a great texture to make it more like ice cream.

I made it with one tiny avacodo because that's all I have, coconut milk that's really fatty, two 1/2 cups of stevia ,  two little things of vanilla extract and it WAS delicious!
But then I ate it all and now I'm sad again 10/10 would make again!
Ima add mint leaves in the summer because they grow wildly in my backyard and their also five star awesome.

Made this just the way it was written. Read some reviews first and chose a larger avocado based on that reading.Because I don't own a large food processor I mashed the avocado first with a fork then put it in my mini food processor to finish creaming it. Then I scraped it into my blender and added the sugar and milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Whipped it up for about 30 seconds or so. Set in fridge and served it over top of vanilla bean ice cream. It was so delicious. Will for sure make this often especially when I have an avocado sitting around to use up.

I've been making a very similar avocado dessert for decades--I picked it up in Brazil in the 1960s. My recipe has two differences: 1) I use powdered sugar to eliminate the "graininess" of regular sugar and, 2) I use lime juice to keep the avocado from turning brown. Neither are major changes, but together they make a huge difference in the taste texture and the appearance of the dessert.

I would suggest using a large or even two advocados with cream which replaces the milk, that way you won’t be making cold soup.

In Brazil we call this an avocado smoothie.  The sweetness and/or consistency (more or less milk) varies from person to person.  During avocado season it's a regular snack.  If I dare mention making a salad with avocado the neighbours think I'm crazy!

It sounds odd, but this is fantastic! My 2 year old gobbled it up. Its got the consistency of pudding. It was a tad on the too sweet for me with 1/4 cup of sugar. Next time will experiment with the amount of sugar to fit my taste. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

I used 1.5 avocados as mine were a bit small. I subbed in sweetened vanilla almond milk for regular milk to cut the calories and I halved the sugar to accommodate. It turned out great! I was very dubious at first but when I tried it, it was pretty good! Ended up being 160 calories per 1/2 cup and I got 2 servings from it. Will for sure make again. I would like to try a chocolate version or maybe add some strawberries.

Ok, this is going to be a very unusual rating.  I made this for my four year old.  He eats EVERYTHING including raw onion.  He took one bite and he hated it.  Now, I ate it and liked it very much!  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated and did not increase it by 75% (the usual ratio) and I STILL thought it was a bit too sweet ... just a bit.

I don't know why he didn't like it, but I will try it on him again.  So, this was the FIRST food in four years that he will not eat.  Go figure.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly...I used 2 small avocados, used honey instead of sugar, left out the vanilla, and added a couple mint leaves. It was creamy, sweet, minty, and delicious! Although it is creamy, there is still a little grit from the fiber in the avacados. That may throw some people off.

Nice dessert. Used a tbls of maple syrup instead of the sugar. Also subbed the milk with cashew milk. Squirt of chocolate sauce, whipped cream and a small handful of frozen blueberries. Wow, I'm loving this.

I have never worked with avocados in the kitchen, because I decided long ago that I loathed guacamole (I may have to reevaluate that stance now...). This recipe blew my mind...My little family LOVED it. I doubled the recipe so that all 4 of us could try it and I discovered that I didn't really need to double the vanilla extract (A 1/2 tsp. is enough for the doubled recipe). Delicious!

This was so delicious. I just had to try it because it only had 4 ingredients so it was pretty easy.  I have made this twice, the 2nd time I added lemon and everyone liked both flavors. Tomorrow I will add cream cheese and make it a cheesecake.

For those of you trying to avoid all sugar on a Plan like the TNT or Atkins Diet, try this:


 1 avocado, peeled and pitted
 1/2 cup almond or coconut milk ( I used Silk Almond/Coconut Blend)
 1/4 cup Splenda
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

It was a little sweet, so I will probably use a little less sweetener next time or I may decide to try and put ice in it to see if I can get more of an ice cream consistency. But overall for someone who doesn't eat avocados, it was pretty good and definitely palatable.

Add lime juice to avoid it getting dark in the refrigerator. It will last a couple of days without changing colors and adds a nice taste accent to the cream. Hmmmm, delicious!

Just what I was looking for. A quick, easy, versatile snack.I mashed my avocado with a fork, added confectioner's sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and walnuts. I think blending it would have been better for a smoother consistancy. I skipped the milk this time though I will try it when I blend and omit the nuts.

I grew up with this dessert! One of my family's faves. We blend it with sweetened condensed milk (instead of the sugar) and ice! Avocado smoothie :) sometimes I just mash the avocado because I like the little chunks!

I really loved this recipe.  Who would have thought?  Definitely need to puree for a while until it is nice and smooth,  otherwise,  it will be grainy from the sugar. Will definitely make again.

It tastes really good, but it seemed a little on the soupy side, it still hasn't chilled yet, so it may thicken, but I recommend maybe a large avocado rather than just a regular one. Still tastes wonderful and if it ends up being soupy I'll probably add some ice and turn it into a smoothie!

I've tried a different avocado pudding recipe before and hated it, so I was being brave trying this one, but I couldn't believe how good it was! I would say the recipe only makes 2 servings, though. I used almond milk and freezed it to make it more like ice cream than pudding and the texture was really great.

it was alright. i used organic maple syrup instead of sugar, which i think was a good idea. also added lime for a citrus flavor. it was just ok though, i would honestly prefer just eating the avocado on its own.

SO LOVELY WITHOUT THE VANILLA.  The vanilla adds a strange smell and flavor.  Otherwise, I am glad I found this recipe.

This recipe is fabulous, I used 2 avocados instead of one. To sweeten I used half the sugar and a couple of slices frozen of banana.  I did use the vanilla.  YUM YUM!!!

Ahh, this old recipe. I've been eating this since I was a toddler. It's deeeelicious. I usually just add in a some ice cubes so I don't have to wait for it. It's perfect for that hot summer weather.

Im a huge avocado fan but I am not sure I like it all that much. I tasted it and didnt like it.  Then I added some mint leafs and that helped.  My 4 year old asked for seconds and my 9 month old cried when it was all gone lol.  I just couldnt get my self to finish my serving so I fed it to my baby.  I loved the idea tho.  I will make this again and add something else to calm the avocado down. Maybe a banana or something.  Family loved it but I didnt so it deserves 4 stars.

Actually pretty good! I fixed some for my husband too when he got home from work and at first he thought I was giving him baby food, lol! (I do make homemade baby food though) He liked it, and decided vanilla ice cream went really well with it too.
Only 4 stars though because this really is not my favorite use for an avocado, but if they're getting too ripe and you're in the mood for dessert, it works!

super yummy.... I like mine with a little texture so I hand mash my avocado.  I added half a block of softened cream cheese a table spoon of honey and only half of the sugar to fit my taste.

How lucky of me to find this recipe! I found it ultra simple to make, it tasted excellent and I am excited to find some alternative ways to use it and to play with the ingredients a bit (although it is superb as is.)

I always love avocado as dessert/smoothie. I haven't tried using vanilla, but I would recommend a drizzle chocolate condensed milk and a shot of black coffee to balance the sweetness of sugar.

This made for a good summer pudding, I thought.   Nice and light.  I figured ingredient amounts might vary due to the varied size of avocados, so I just kind of added milk and sugar to taste.  I skipped the vanilla.  Delicious..and healthier alternative!

be sure to get this thing really mushed up--no lumps--very different---put i guess if you put enough sugar in anything it tastes good---good over ice cream---did not try with fruit yet

I loved this! I thought it was fun, unique and refreshing. Other people thought it was just odd, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. If you're on the fence about making it, I'd give it a shot...something different! :) I followed the recipe exactly!

not sure......i love avocado, but this was just way too sweet. I seemed to enjoy it mixed with grape nuts. The bitter grain leveled out the sweet. might make again  ....?

In the Philippines, avocado is considered a fruit instead of a vegetable --kind of like how tomato is considered a vegetable--so eating it as a dessert vs. an addition to salads or savory things was alien to me until I moved to the US.  I prefer it chunky, so I don't bother to puree it.  They're also great frozen; when the kids were little, I used to make them into popsicles.  (Or check out some Asian stores for Magnolia brand avocado ice cream. Yummy!)

I have always wanted to try eating and using avocados and always strayed away from them, but when I read this recipe it sounded interesting and I decided to give it a whirl.  I had one avocado handy and followed the recipe exactly!  I loved it!  I was so excited about the taste that I decided to make this again for a great snack in between meals!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I might add more vanilla extract, but the flavor and the consistency to me was great! Thank you so much for this recipe!  I am now a firm believer in using avocados for other various dishes! I will be making this again! I truly enjoyed this awesome dessert!

yummy!! this was delicious! I read some of the reviews and decided to add the milk and sugar a little at a time untill I had the right consistency.   Im always looking for different ways to use veggies for my 3 year old and this was perfect. She agreed, even proclaiming "mmm this is tasty!"  Thanks for a great recipe.

A little too sweet for my taste, but after decreasing the sugar it was just right.

I love it! We eat this a lot in Brazil. You can also try it with some drops of lemon instead of vanilla. Congratulations for the recipe and for sharing it with the menbers.

This was AMAZING! My mom and I loved it, and I'm waiting to see what my (very picky) fiance thinks. I added a little more vanilla than the recipe calls for, but it was just right. And the texture was lovely. :) Definately will make this again.

Yummy and easy!  I used soy milk instead of cow milk (lactose-intolerant), and 5 packets of splenda instead of sugar.  Also I threw a few ice cubes into the blender at the end.  Kept it nice and cold!  Great use for over-ripe avocados!

It was good, but very sweet, which I guess is necessary to keep the avocado flavor from overwhelming it.  I think this works best as a fruit dip or topping, rather than eating it straight.

I bought an avocado because they are rich in mono unsaturated fatty acids "MUFA"> Never really tasted one. Now with this recipe I'm hooked.

It was very interesting. My husband and I both love avocado and sugar so we thought we would give it a try! But it just wasn't for us. Thanks for the recipe though!

This is very tasty, but I feel that it is missing a flavor.  I put about 1/4 cup in my oatmeal (cooked with less water) and this worked nicely.  Does it need cinnamon?  Hmm... please post if you have any ideas.  I like the consistency.

Love this! And the kids do too! The color was inviting for them and when they tasted it, they loved it! And my 9 yr old step-son won't try anything without a fight! But not this! And I had my 4 month old try it and he loved it too! The only thing I did was not put quite as much sugar as what it called for. Otherwise GREAT tasting treat!

This was superb! I did reduce the sugar a bit, but I live in Kenya, where all produce is a bit sweeter than in the US. I can't believe I haven't been making this for years--I've been missing out. Thanks for a wonderful and super-easy recipe!

This is really good, like a subtle pudding. I cut the vanilla in half based on other reviews. I also halved the sugar because it seemed like a lot, but ended up adding back a couple teaspoons. I tried another version substituting lime for the vanilla and it was good, too. They both felt like they would be good as a sauce for something else.

This was delicious. The vanilla seemed to be over-powering at first, but as we ate it seemed to be less apparent.

I would put maybe 1/2 the amount of sugar called for if I were to eat this on it's own. I put the full 1/4 cup without thinking and was stuck with sickeningly sweet green goo. However Mixed in with unsweeted porridge it wasn't bad. I also stirred in a cup or so of cereal (rice crispies and bran flakes) and it made for not a bad parfait either.

Delicious. I love sweet avocado desserts--and so easy to make. I changed the recipe by using 1/8 of a cup of splenda granular and 1/4 a teaspoon of vanilla. I also added a pinch of salt. This is great because it is lighter than the condensed milk avocado dessert I usually make.

It was tasty for a few spoonfuls but I started becoming overwhelmed by the sugar after a few extra bites. I had some slices of kiwi around the bowl I was eating it in for decoration. I tried crushing it and putting it in the dessert itself, and it added a tangy touch.
