The first time I made this recipe I was really impressed the taste of this vegetable cooked. When I reheated the leftovers the cream separated a bit and gave it almost a cheesy consistency and flavor. So the next time I made this I added a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese sprinkled over it at the end of cooking and the flavor was even better. I also added a minced clove of garlic to the onions when cooking for extra flavor. I'm thinking this might also be a good base for tomato sauce instead of the cream for and Italian flavor.

I have been reading the reviews and some have said that this recipe is too salty. You only need to salt the cucumbers if they are soft. If your cuc's are a little old, salt them, then drain them in a colander and rinse with water. If they are ripe and fresh there is no need for the salt. Just a side note!

I have always loved trying new and unexpected recipes!  That amount of salt is probably meant to be sprinkled on the cucumbers, in a colander, so that they will drain their excess water.  I always rinse the drained cucumbers and pat dry before proceeding with the recipe.  Maybe, the heavy cream was meant to be a substitute for the sour cream.  I would imagine that using both would be very good.  I used much more than a pinch of dill.  Even our most dubious tasters rated it highly!

Simple and delicious.  I was a bit leary of cooking cucumbers, but it turned out great.  I used the seedless "English" cucumbers.  They cook up better and have less moisture.  I have actually made this several times, but never reviewed them.

Great recipie except it was a little heavy on the salt.  I will decrease it a little next time and I think they will be perfect.  The cooked cucumbers were a suprisingly good new taste for us and the sauce was fantastic.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 heavy cream as suggested...mmmmmm! Add plenty of dill as specified and this would also make a great sauce to accompany blackened salmon as well!

I'm not a big cucumber person, but this is really good.  I followed the directions exactly and followed other reviewers suggestions about adding garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.  This recipe will be used again and again this summer!

The sauce on these was good, but I didn't really care for the cucumbers cooked.

I thought this was at least a different way to use up the cucumbers from the garden.  Very interesting.  We actually needed to add salt at the table because the sauce needed it.

This is a great alternative to just using cucumbers in a salad.  The butter and onion are delicious with them.  And I was surprised that the cucumbers remained crunchy.

Like others, I was a bit hesitant about this recipe.  But it was delicious!  A nice change from the typical vinegar/cucumber salads.  Will definitely be making this again.

My husband and I were very surprised that we liked this.  It seemed such an odd combination but it was tasty.  I even liked it before I added the sour cream. The sauteed cucumbers in butter had a sweet/savory flavor that was very nice. It was a nice change to help use up all the fresh cucumbers from the garden. We will certainly try these again. Since our cukes were kirbys fresh from the garden, I left the skins on and it was still yummy.

This provided a pleasantly cool contrast to the rather spicy 'Stuffed Cod Wrapped in Bacon' I made tonight, but other than that, we weren't overly wowed. Thanks anyway, molly!
