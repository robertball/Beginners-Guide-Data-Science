This is super yummy!  I made with Ghirardelli 60% dark choco chips to keep it as low-carb as possible (used 40 chips).  I also did not use the heavy cream.  I used Rodelle gourmet vanilla.  My thinking was to make a choco-type bread spread like Nutella to abate my morning sweet tooth, but this is worthy of eating by the spoonful.  I put the mixture back into the 8 ounce cheese container and 1/16 of the container is 6.5 carbs.  For those not counting carbs, this is still a wonderful tasting treat.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Replaced the chocolate chips with unsweetened cocoa powder to make it low carb and low sugar, and it turned out fantastic. Didn't end up needing to refrigerate it very long without the melted chocolate.

This was a really easy and very tasty "mousse".  I used it to fill mini sugar cookie cups for a Memorial Day dessert I took to a cookout.  I piped it into the cups and it held it's shape very well.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

I added Hazelnut liqueur to this along with  half of a dark chocolate candy bar and some cocoa.  It is rather thick but still very good. I can see using this as a layer between cakes, on top of layered desserts, etc.  Imagine this would also be wonderful with some prepared coffee and coffee liqueur.  The possibilities are endless in terms of diversity.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This recipe is great as a filler for chocolate cupcakes. Just tube in into the center.

So good. My doctor just put me on an egg-free diet. So I was very happy to find this recipe. I used it as a mousse pie filling and topped it with freshly whipped cream. My hubby loved it too!

This is a gem of a breezy-easy dessert recipe! I didn't bother to get out the double boiler, just melted the chocolate chips in the microwave on low. It turned out great. Now I am tempted to try the same mousse idea with butterscotch or peanut butter flavored chips instead of chocolate

I substituted cream cheese with more cream and butter for the mascrapone. It turned out really well.

I've made this a few times now and love that it is incredibly easy to make and doesn't contain raw egg. This most recent time I made it, I used Nutella instead of melting chocolate; it was even easier to make and was very yummy! Served just with fresh raspberries, mmmm!
