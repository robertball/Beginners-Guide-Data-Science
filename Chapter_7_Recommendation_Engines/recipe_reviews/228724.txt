Yum!  I had leftover cranberry bread that was a mix of heels and pieces so I wanted something to do with it.  However, had no milk--hubs used that up with breakfast smoothies.  So, I went looking and found this.  I scaled the servings down to 3 and used fresh pineapple I chopped in the food processor and just brown sugar instead of white.  recipe doesn't say what size dish, so I used 4 baking crocks and baked at time and temp directed.  Turned out very yummy, thanks for the recipe!

Review in 2nd paragraph.  Bread pudding began as a practical use for putting dried up bread stuffs to use. The eggs and milk are really meant to add moisture back to the bread but the benefit is that the pudding/cake ends up in a delicious moist state.  Comfort food to the MAX.  If you simply keep to dry to moist ingredients in the same ratio as this recipe lays out you are free to toss in whatever flavor combos you like...or you have on hand!  You could add leftover rice or any fruits you like or cooked quinoa or soaked Chia seeds. Fresh ground flax seeds would add a delightful nutty flavor.   Poppy seeds and chopped oranges or lemons would be fun.  Just use the basics and have fun.   

 This is a very good pudding. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c (just my preference--not that there is anything wrong with the original amount)  I made mine from a cinnamon/raisin bread and a soft wheat combination.  I added moist chopped prunes (btw 1/2 c and 3/4).  I also tipped in shot of rum to anchor the flavor...the alcohol bakes out so there is no need for the breath-alizer.  OH... and I made two.  I let the first one sit for about 10 minutes before I baked and the second one went in right away.  The second one raised higher and was lighter so don't let it sit. Yum.  Next time I feel ambitious I will make a baked custard and serve them together.

Wow, was this ever delicious!  I didn't have milk, but I found this recipe using pineapple.  I must say I was a little apprehensive, but WOW, it's so good!  I modified it bit just by substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar for the white sugar, added some nutmeg and cinnamon.  Oh, I also macerated my raisens in 1/4 cup of rum and added the whole thing too. :)

It is FANTASTIC. I cut the sugar to 2/3 a cup and used raisin challah but otherwise followed it exactly. My hubby adored it...and he doesn't like bread pudding! I baked until brown and ate it hot. Yummy

Fantabulous recipe.  I am not normally a bread pudding fan, but I had all the ingredients in the house so I decided to try the recipe.  Wow it was delicious and made the house smell wonderful.  Needless to say the entire pan of bread pudding was gone by days end.

Needs a little less sugar and I used sourdough bread instead. But it tastes great!

My gf and I won a crockpot competition with some variations to this recipe. Keeping a bread pudding moist while holding temp for several hours does not come naturally, but can be done... with a load of butter and good amount of fruit.
We cut up a whole large challah and baked the cubes slightly to make sure they were dried and hard. This is presumably about double the quantity of bread listed in this recipe. 
To make the custard we used 7 medium eggs, a full cup of walnuts, a full cup of raisins, 3.5 sticks of butter, 1 cup of powdered sugar, and basically an entire 20 oz can of pineapple chunks (not crushed). 
We went one layer of bread, followed by a well distributed layer of custard, and then did another layer on top of that the same way. Then we topped it all with fresh pineapple chunks (not canned) and dusted those with brown sugar. 
It was awesome.

Oh my. This is delicious! I had 11 leftover Hawaiian rolls that I didn’t want to waste. Changes made included: 5 eggs and a large can of crushed pineapple because I did not think the small can would give enough moisture. I also used 1/2 white and brown sugar. I kept butter amount the same. I used dried cranberries because that was what I had on hand. Definitely going to make again!

Had a very good flavor. I plumped the raisins, but it was still dry. Would be better with a sauce of some type over it.

A very firm bread pudding but excellent flavor.  I did not use nuts and used craisins in place of raisins.  I used Challah bread which I love in bread puddings. I made it in a 9" sq. pan. My husband loved it and bread pudding is not one of his favorites.

I love bread pudding and this is my favorite. Even my hubby who says he doesn’t like bread pudding loved it. The only change I made was using pecans instead of walnuts because that’s what I had.

Very good. Made as directed, but used chopped pecans and 10 Hawaiian sweet rolls. I hate when people say I made the recipe, but.....I feel like the basis was exactly the same and, I’m positive, with no changes would be excellent too.

I was tempted to add some kind of flavouring, as most bread puddings need a little spice, but I decided to do it as is first and I'm so glad I did.  Very plain, very simple, very delicious!  I have only one suggestion: Bread comes in many shapes and sizes..the number of slices does NOT work when dealing with a long skinny french loaf!  I would like to see a cup measurement for the sliced up pieces.

I was surprised how good this was.  First time making a bread pudding.  I used sourdough, cut the sugar by 1/3, used 20% more crushed pineapple and used tart cherries along with the raisins.  I also cut some fresh pineapple to lay on top which was a nice touch.  This was a sweet and easy dish which my family loved.  Serves well with vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely make again!

Tired of throwing away old hard French bread so I tried this recipe. It was wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was a little sweet. This is not a problem for me but if you don't have a sweet tooth you may want to cut down on the sugar.

Love this bread pudding!!!!! The brown sugar adds a crunch to the top making it a wonderful contrast to the moist, chewy bread pudding.

Absolutely delicious ! Might as a little rum to the mixture next time. I served it with vanilla ice cream. My wife who doesn't like bread pudding liked it.
