Thank you so much for this recipe!!  I halved the recipe and it was easy to make and well worth the time and effort.  My mum and brother in law who are picky foodies loved it too.  I am looking forward to entering it at a local fair later in the year.  Thank you from Australia!!!

WONDERFUL!!! I didn't have curry powder, but I followed everything else to the letter and was absolutely pleased with the results.  I have had to hide these from my husband so he doesn't eat them all before winter.

Excellent recipe. However next time I would drain and rinse the vegetables before boiling as I found the taste a little salty.

Excellent recipe. I also rinsed the vegetables twice before I added the other ingredients. I used coarse salt.

This was really good! I say was because every bottle was gone in less than a month. All four of them!
