This is a great pie and very easy to make.
I omitted 1/4 cup milk and added 1/4 cup extra lemon juice, since I prefer a tart pie.
Turned out perfect in every way ...

Excellent pie! I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. A walnut crumb crust made this pie exceptional. Thanks, Mary Ann.

Very good pie!  I didn't change a thing and was very pleased with the results, as were my family!  The lemon custard came out perfectly, and in fact would be great on its own or in a parfait with some berries and fruit rather than just in the pie!  I will definitely be making this again!

This is so very tasty!  I followed some of the other suggestions and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  I also knew my family would not care for the lemon zest in the pie filling, so I added it to the crust instead.  (I made a graham cracker crust).  It was quite lemony, but got even more so after being refrigerated overnight.  It definitely satisfied my craving for a lemon meringue-type pie without all the extra work.

This is quite a good pie.  It is better the next day when the lemon flavor is more intense.

This recipe was excellent.  Very easy to make.  I decreased milk and increased lemon juice by 1/4 cup each as per another suggestion and am glad I did, I don't think it would have been very lemony if I hadn't.  I also made in a graham crust.  It is chilling in my refridgerator right now and I can't wait for dessert!!!  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!!  Definitely reduce the milk by 1/4 cup and substitute additional lemon juice instead.  I made my own pastry crust using a recipe from this site and whipped up some fresh cream to dollop on each slice.  I also added fresh mint leaves as a garnish, and they paired SO well with the lemon if you happened to get both in the same bite.  My guests were literally picking their plates up and licking them.

OMG! I've been looking for this recipe for 20 years!! My mom used to make this every holiday..6 in fact and they would disappear within minutes of our family gathering! I could only remember that sour cream, lemon juice, eggs, butter and sugar were in the recipe... I was about 12 when mom lost the recipe. But alas, when I saw the cornstarch...I knew I'd found the right one. Eureka! I will be making this one this week!!  I'm so happy this recipe was here! In 1990, We drove almost 2 hrs away to get the recipe from the original friend who shared it with mom...stopping by her work then her home to no avail. Moms old co-worker could not remember which recipe and no longer had it. She has since passed but I'll always remember Benny as moms best friend who introduced us to the best lemon pie I'd ever tasted. She was darn good at peanut brittle too. But I digress.  So welcome back "lemon pie"!!! We've been suffering with horrible impersonations of you for > 20 years. If you weren't covered with whip cream, I'd hug you! yummmmm...

I am a lemon lover and I found this pie absolutely incredible!  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9 x 13 deep glass dish and used a graham crust with it.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and increased (actually doubled) the amount of (fresh) lemon juice and adjusted the amount of milk accordingly.  Even with the increase in lemon the outcome is still sweet and creamy and has the perfect amount of tartness.  I will definitely be making this pie again and again.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

This was an excellent pie and then I experimented. Because my husband and some friends are more sensitive to milk I used Pure Coconut milk and less sour cream. It is so very tastey!! I also used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 Sugar. It's just like my husband's grandma's lemon pie!

This pie is a little plain. Any jam or berry
sauce spooned on top will add visual interest and flavor appeal.

I found this recipe while searching for a way to use up a tub of sour cream before it went off.  Delicious!  I've made it several times and it's always turned out perfectly.
Because I hate having egg whites hanging around in the fridge, I used two whole eggs and it was still good.  Of course you can make a meringue topping.  My family prefers whipped cream, unsweetened.
I've made it with lime juice, and it's divine.

I wish I could leave a review with four and a half stars. Freaking incredible pie. SO good. I did read through the most helpful reviews on this recipe and a lot of people increased the lemon juice and decreased the milk....so.....I followed suit. I used 1/2 c. lemon juice and 3/4 c. milk and I actually used evaporated milk. I made my own graham cracker crust for this recipe, too, instead of using a pie crust. Really, really good. NOTE: Right before serving, I decided to spread one container of FF Cool-Whip over the top of the pie. It's good either way, really.

My family loved this pie. I made the following changes: I used a 9" graham cracker crust; 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup lemon juice and a heaping tablespoon of grated lemon zest. Make sure you really cook this until it's very thick and don't use light sour cream or it will be a little runny. When it was completely chilled, just before serving I put a layer of cool whip on top and there wasn't a drop of pie left. I highly recommend this pie for a spring or summer treat as it is very refreshing.

YUM!  I was pleased with my results!  I did as the other reviewers suggested and cut back the milk to 3/4 cup (I used half and half) and increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  My pie set up nicely and was delicious!  It is really good in a graham cracker crust!

This pie was pretty good for how easy it is. The texture was SUPER creamy, which I appreciated. I took the advice of doubling the lemon and reducing the milk. I don't think it will make it into my rotation, though. The sour cream flavor stood out to me quite a bit, and even though I like sour cream I didn't care for such a strong flavor of it in this pie.

This filling took forever to thicken. I stood in the kitchen stirring for a good 45 minutes, and the end result was an odd sour cream flavor nobody in my family cared for.

This was a great recipe.  I used soy creamer in place of regular milk because that is all I had on hand.  Also cut the sugar per other reviews.  Placed strawberries on top.  A nice light dessert.  Thanks for posting!

This was a great recipe! The first time I made it, I realized too late, that my sour cream was bad. In a pinch I folded in cool whip instead. Yuummmy! Then I made it a second time with sour cream and again...Yum! My only change each time was according to reviewers suggestions to add 1/2 c. lemon juice and cut the milk to 3/4 c. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe. I have made this recipe according to the directions exactly but preferred a more lemony flavor with less sour cream flavor, so I reduced the sour cream by 1/4, doubled the lemon zest, increased the lemon juice (also I used fresh lemon juice) by 1/4 and it turned out to my personal preference. Also works well with using Splenda.

Wow! This was very tasty-much like a lemon version of Key Lime Pie.  I made the following adjustments:  increased lemon juice to 1/2 cup & reduced milk to 3/4 cup.  I also added the zest (and 2 tsp. of sugar) in with my usual homemade pastry crust instead of in the filling (we don't like bits in our filling)- I love a flavorful crust.  I think it would be great in a graham cracker crust.

Shockingly good! Don't use a whip cream that uses sour cream as an ingredient. You need a softer contrast.

This is so incredibly good and so easy to make!  I followed the recipe as written.  I however used Meyer lemons as I was given a couple of bags.  My family and I loved the pie!  In fact, I'm making two more for my son's birthday party!  Thank you Mary Ann for sharing!

I'm not sure what went wrong here; the flavor of the filling was spot on, but it never set.  It's more of a lemon mush pie than lemon lush.  I knew it was going to be a problem when the first round of ingredients didn't thicken, even after 15 minutes of constant cooking/stirring.  I followed the recipe exactly, as far as I can tell.  If anyone has an idea what went wrong, please let me know.  I loved the flavor, and I'd make it again if I could figure out the problem with the texture!

I doubled the lemon juice and used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream- just lovely!  I also made a digestive-biscuit crust instead of a pastry crust, which I think suited it far better.

This is a great pie.  The sour cream gives it a really rich taste.  I did add the second time I made it, about 1/2 c. lemon juice for a zippier taste.

I really enjoyed this. I used a regular pastry crust, but I think it would be good with a graham cracker crust also. I topped it with a bit of whipped cream, to sweeten it slightly, but it is good just plain. The complexity of the lemon and sour cream make a great combination.

The Lemon Cream Pie was wonderful!!  This will be put in my pie recipe folder.
Just a note to those who have a hard time getting lemon or pineapple pies to set.
VERY IMPORTANT !!!!!
Lemon Juice or pineapple is acidic and will prevent cornstarch from thickening properly if added before the custard is cooked.
In this recipe I melted butter, then added sugar, egg yolks, and corn starch and blended.  Then I added the milk  and cooked over medium/high heat, stirring constantly until it came to a boil.  It thickens in about 5 minutes.
Then I added the lemon and then sour cream.

I don't just 'like' this pie, I love it!  It was so easy to make, I didn't change a thing.  I followed the recipe and measured everything.   I found that it took up to 9 min. to thicken the delicious lemon  custard, so don't give up.  It should coat a wooden spoon.I will serve it again, and again!  Oh, and sweetened whipped cream on top, sheer heaven. Thank you, Rosemarie

Doubled the recipe and made 2 pies with homemade graham cracker crust, followed other suggests and increased lemon juice and decreased milk. I also decreased the sour cream a little too. Covered in a layer of whipped cream right before serving. SOOOOOO yummy. Took the 2 pies to a party and they were a big hit. Thanks

LOVED the flavor! Plenty of lemon tang.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 of a cup as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I did not have sour cream, so substituted 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt.  This pie is very creamy, and is easy to make with ingredients on  hand!  Family loved it!

Awesome! However I followed some of the recommendations by other reviews and reduced the amount of milk and added more lemon juice. I think next time I make it I will follow the recipe exactly.

This pie never set for me. One thing that could be clearer(for the novice)is a clearer description of just how thick it needs to be. I thought I let it get pretty thick but again, it just didn't work out for me. I probably won't try it again.

I reallly liked this pie. I used an oreo cookie pie crust which I really liked with this. I tasted the filling before adding the sour cream, and I like it better without the sour cream. Next time I will omit the sour cream, and maybe double the filling recipe.

This is very creamy and good. I used the 3/4 cup of milk with 1/2 cup lemon juice, as one of the reviewers suggested . Also I used the egg whites and made a French Meringue for the top. Will be making this again!

Easy.  Tasted great.  Added a bit more lemon juice than the recipe called for.

DELICIOUS! This is the pie equivalent of a lemon bar. This is definitely making it into my permanent collection of recipes.

Quick but the taste is just okay.  Two of us did not like at all and two of us thought it was okay.  Would probably not make again but it did the trick for a fast dessert.

I made this pie.  "it was okay" that's the response that i got from everyone.  Definitely, not the best, but ok.  It's really fast and easy to make, but I don't think I'll make it again.  Just not that good.
