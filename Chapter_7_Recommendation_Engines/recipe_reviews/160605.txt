I made a few changes but first let me say THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!! Ok the changes. I made it for two rather than four. Of necessity, I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire and it was fine. I replaced the butter with olive oil also with no problems and less fat. Now the big change, I baked rather than grilled the chicken and used bone-in breasts which I think are juicier and are also more economical.  I lined a glass baking dish with foil for easy clean up.  I marinated the breasts for a full day, placed them in the dish, poured the marinade over the top, and sealed tightly with foil.  I baked them at 375 for 45 minutes, removed the foil and baked for another fifteen minutes. Once I removed the foil, I basted the breasts often.  After 15 minutes and when they tested as nearly done with a meat thermometer, I broiled them for about five minutes to brown and crisp the skin.  These were SO juice and SO tender that my husband couldn't stop raving about them.  And wow did they smell good!  Next time I may try them on the grill but baking works REALLY well.  This is definitely a keeper! I served them with couscous with fresh chopped tomatoes added  when I fluffed it. A big hit!

Hubs and I both enjoyed this and I was surprised he did, given he is always against any kind of marinades (I did it while he was working before he had a chance to object). Personally, I prefer the way he generally grills chicken (I think it's his secret) but it was fun to try something different. I used olive oil rather than margarine and followed the rest of the marinade ingredients as directed. The flavors are all very mellow, and you wouldn't have guessed there was any hot sauce in the marinade at all, so if you like a little kick, I'd suggest adding more. The thing I wasn't crazy about, however, is the vinegar that is this marinade's signature - while I couldn't isolate any of the other ingredients in the marinade, the tang of the vinegar was unmistakable and a little too pronounced for me. If I were to make this again I'd substitute white wine. All and all, a perfectly okay marinade.

Very flavorful and super simple. This recipe will become a regular in our household. I used boneless chicken breasts and marinated them for 7 hours.

Good. I do think next time I will marinate it over night for more flavor. I don't think four hours is long enough in my opinion. Definately good though, I served it with salad and corn on the cob.

I was quite pleased with how moist this chicken turned out!  I subbed 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand.  Served on a bed of onions, sauteed red, yellow and green peppers.

This had virtually no flavor at all whatsoever.  Like others I used olive oil and I let two boneless chicken breasts marinated for 8 hours.  They were moist, but had no taste.

I have been looking for a great chicken recipe that wasn't dry. This is it!!! My whole family loved it. I followed the ing other than i left out the butter/oil. I also put it in the marinade last night so it was about 24 hours in it. I also baked it for 50 mins on 350 in a covered dish. Its about 20 outside with over a foot of snow and i am not in the grilling mood. Will try grilling it this summer.

This tastes just like my mother's marinade, but with a fraction of the oil!I switched out the margerine for olive oil, and it was great.

It was ok. I only had time to marinate it for about 2 1/2 hours. The flavor was ok, but could be vamped up a little. I may add more hot sauce next time.

Excellent and so easy to make. The only change I made was to use white balsamic vinegar instead of plain (I was out of regular vinegar). Tender and juicy with lots of garlic flavor. Sliced and served on top of a salad. My new favorite chicken recipe. Thank you GodivaGirl!

very tasty chicken. i omitted the butter to save calories as other reviewers suggested. my only reservation from giving this recipe five stars is the amount of sodium is too high. maybe you could use garlic powder instead of garlic salt? my boyfriend commented he liked it but he thought it was a little too salty however he had also added table salt as he is one of those people who add salt and pepper to everything before even tasting. i would make this again. thanks!

This chicken was awesome! Nice and juicy.  The only changes I made were that like another reviewer, I did not have white wine vinegar so I used white balsamic, and substituted the butter with oil.  I threw it all in a bag in the morning before I left for work and voila....perfect tasty grilled chicken for dinner!  It's now in my recipe box...willl make again and again!

Great recipe, using kichen staples! I switched the garlic salt to 1 tbls garlic powder and 1 1/2 tbls minced garlic (huge garlic fan). also swapped the butter for olive oil. My husband adds salt to everything, but not this! So Im glad I didnt use the garlic salt. I also halved the hot sauce so my 1 year old could try it. loved it! I might try to strictly follow the recipe next time just to see how big of a difference the changes made.

I agree with the "virutally no flavor" comment, however it does smell fantastic while cooking. Yet I would say that is the disguise!

I used red wine vinegar and chix breast with the bone. I grilled them and boiled the marinate, brushing it on as it grilled. I was in a rush and only marinated chix for 2 hrs,it was really good! I will make this again that's for sure!! Hubby thought this chix was tender and juicy, not dried out at all, like the breast tend to do. Thanks Bellemic! Patty

This recipe is great!  I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken, and my mom used to use a vinegar based sauce on the grill - this came close.  Like some others I subbed olive oil for the butter (I was making this at 6 AM and didn't feel like revving  up the microwave to melt it) and also instead of garlic salt used 1 TBSP of garlic powder and about 1/2 TBSP regular salt.  Everyone loved it in my house!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious and incredibly easy!  Made this at the last minute when I realized I didn't have many other ingredients on hand for a good marinade.  This was full of flavor and so simple, with common ingredients.  I halved the amount of garlic salt because I'm not a big garlic fan.  This is perfect for summer grilled chicken.  I'll be making this again soon!

Makes good juicy chicken, but the flavor is nothing special.  I marinated for a couple hours and basted several times while on the grill.  Next time I will marinate over night.

I really liked this! The vinegar (for me) was not overpowering but creates this interesting tang in the chicken. I used regular white vinegar and will again next time. I will say do not use boneless breasts like I did...they got dry and the only thing that saved them was the vinegar. Use bone in OR use dark meat like thighs. I also used garlic powder and salt...not garlic salt...but not much of a difference there...and I didn't add any butter, just a tbsp of oil to keep this light. Marinated all night long - 2 thumbs up! Thanks!!

This was great off of the grill!  It has a tang to it that you usually only get at restaurants.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and it was wonderfull.  We will be having this again.

I am giving this 3 stars because as written it is very salty.  The marinade has a nice flavor but again for our taste its too salty.  I think using either garlic powder or fresh would make the difference.  I will try this again using powder or fresh garlic.  Also, I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have white on hand.

OH wow, oh yum, I'm a convert. I usually eschew the breast of the chicken because it's too dry, but this recipe made the meat tender, juicy and so tasty. Marinated 24 hours, made the following modifications to suit personal taste: 1 Tbsp garlic powder + 1/2 Tbsp sea salt instead of garlic salt; about half the hot sauce due to kids; and EVOO instead of butter. What decided me to try this recipe on some chicken breasts I was unsure what to do with was another reviewer's comment that this recipe gave the chicken the tang you usually only find in restaurants. Very true, and as a result this will go into my regular rotation.

This has become my go-to grilled chicken. My family of 6 unanimously loves this recipe -- which is almost unheard of. Flavors are best when the chicken marinates over night (and until dinner time), and I prefer drumsticks to chicken breasts. Otherwise, I follow this recipe precisely. FYI, this recipe is perfect for one family pack of drumsticks (13 pieces), and I make the marinade right in the gallon-size ZipLoc bag and add in the chicken. No clean up! Enjoy!

Really, really good.  Especially cold the next day. The vinegar flavor really makes it over the top! Used red wine vinegar and subbed olive oil for the margarine.  Also, baked in the oven.

I couldn't see the purpose of the melted butter, so I excluded it and never missed it!
This is delicious!!!!!!!!!!!
2nd time: Used seasoned  1/2 C. rice wine vinegar,  1/3 C. water, 1 T garlic salt, 1 T hot sauce, 1 tsp black pepper, 4 tsps wors. sauce and no butter.  It was excellent!!!!!!!

This was delicious, although I did tweak the recipe based on what I had and what I thought would go well. First as another person stated I switched out the Worcestershire for soy sauce. Also I switched out the margarine for sesame oil and used saracha as the hot sauce. I marinated five chicken thighs for about 18 hours. I ended up baking them in a cast iron pan with foil over the top for a hour at 400 degrees, removed the foil and cooked for about ten then broiled them for around five minutes. They came our moist, up to temperature and full of flavor.

I use my George Foreman grill a lot for grilled chicken and this was no exception so I cannot comment using an outdoor grill. However,  I followed the instructions but ran out of vinegar so I used a bit of apple cider vinegar and fresh lemon juice to make up the difference. I used 5 chicken boneless chicken from Sam's and had to pound a couple of them to get the thickness that I needed to get them all equal in thickness. I cooked them for 5 mins with top down and they were all very juicy and flavorful.  Grill marks will appear on the top only because of all the juices on the bottom so I cook 3 mins and then flip over over for 2 more mins. Just a preference. Only problem was that I did not make enough! Next time will double and then cut up for a grilled chicken green salad the following day. Excellent!

Vinegar Grilled Chicken Haiku: "Very moist chicken, sad that it lacked flavor punch. Ate over salad." Used olive oil and marinated my chicken cutlets for 4 hrs. b4 grilling and while very moist, they didn't taste like a whole lot of much, so I'm glad that I sliced it over a salad rather than making it a "starring" entree protein.

I love this. My son who is a picky eater loves it too. I did make two changes. I use olive oil instead of butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I think this needs to be in everyone's recipe box.

I followed the recipe but using olive oil and twice the chili sauce., and baked it for 50 min at 350.  Tasted too vinegary for me. Edible and juicy, but not to my taste. I will not be making this one again.

Very good! I used chicken thighs and they were very moist and flavorful!  There was a slightly salty taste, however, it was sort of like teriaki.  I will use this recipe again!

I didn't have white wine vinegar, but apple cider vinegar was a fine substitute. Also used Franks hot sauce and wayyyyy more than 1TB, probably more like 1cup of hot sauce. Used a flavor injector to really get it in the chicken and then marinated it for a few hours. Super yummy, and not too spicy for my 2 year old

Made it exactly as written.  LOVED IT!!!  One change for next time...  I will use garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt.  It was a tad on the salty side.

Didn't care for this marinade, it was really salty and the hot sauce was an odd combination with the vinegar and it really overpowered the vinegar as well.
