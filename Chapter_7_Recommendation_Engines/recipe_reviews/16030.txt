I make raspberry coulis quite often and especially when having brownies for dessert.   To get the raspberry sauce smooth it is best to strain it thru cheesecloth or very fine sieve - this particular sauce is not supposed to have seeds.   Also, liqueur can be added for extra flavor and if boiled down for a few mins. doesn't really need thickening.

Okay, I didn't make the brownies, but I have used the sauce as a topping for chocolate mousse.  Once the raspberries were melted, I added 1/4 c. sugar and stirred until dissolved.  Then I added the cornstarch-juice mixture (although I used water instead of juice), cooked as directed, and added rind.  I kept it in the fridge, then spooned it over the mousse before serving.  It was to die for!

I made this for a couples Valetines meal. They loved it! 
I did make some adjustments to the couli, I added a can of rasp/strawberry juice concentrate, and thickened. Since I was cooking for 32 people, I baked the brownies in a jelly roll pan. First I cut them diagonally then end to end to create a diamond shape. I topped it off with drizzling melted white chocolate over the top and a sprig of parsley. Thank you for submitting this recipe. I will use it again

This is a very good couli; I added some sugar to make it a bit more sweet (I used it for a Vanilla Bavarian).  To make it more presentable, I strained the hot berries in a sieve prior to adding the corn starch paste.  This took out all the little raspberry seeds and made the sauce velvety smooth; just right for a very elegant dessert.

I believe this recipe needs sugar in the couli.  I added 1/4-1/2 cup of sugar to taste, not sweet but relieves the too strong tartness of the plain raspberries.  I did not make the brownies only the couli and it was good with the added sugar.

I AM ONLY RATING THE RASPBERRY SAUCE. I tried it with Hershey's chocolate mousse and didn't like it. It was way too tart and I don't think it mixes well with chocolate, at all. If you make this go easy on the orange zest.

Not my favorite brownie recipe. The Coulis was okay, but I felt it was a bit too tart and thick and the brownies weren't fluffy enough, but weren't fudgy either.

Made the Coulis only. Add some sugar, otherwise it's too tart. Corn starch  is completely unnecessary. Orange zest wrecks it, so Do Not Use any zest. 
iow:  berries + sugar = simple yumminess
