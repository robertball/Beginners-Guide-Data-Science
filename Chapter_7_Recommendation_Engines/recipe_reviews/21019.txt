Very good, but a little bland - I added chopped apples, raisins, and a little cinnamon.

I made this for just two and found that using the measurements provided for two servings made it too soupy.  The second time I made it, I used just 1 and 3/4 cups water and kept the rest of the measurements the same.  I used regular half and half instead of non-dairy creamer, and I skipped the milk and second tablespoon of brown sugar.  One tablespoon was just enough.  My son really liked it the first time, but with it being so thin, he thought it lost its flavor by the time he finished the bowl.  When I cut back on the water and it was thicker, he loved it.

I will never buy pre-packaged instant oatmeal again.  I triple the batch and keep it in an air-tight container.  When I want some, I dip out 1/2 cup, add the water and butter and microwave for 3 minutes....

Just made this for breakfast and it was awesome!  I've never liked the instant packets but I liked this.  I mainly made it for my husband who has been wanting oatmeal for a while and he said it tasted so good.  We used Cinnamon Bun creamer from Coffee Mate and it was the perfect amount of cinnamon flavor.  I didn't use quite as much creamer as the recipe called for and I'm glad I didn't because it didn't really need it, it had the right amount of sweetness.  Will probably be making this alot!

Great oatmeal, i don't know why i never tried to make oatmeal by scratch before...i've always relied on the instant kind which doesn't give half of the flavor and texture of this stuff. 
If you're looking for a quicker and less messy way to cook the oats, put the oats and water in the microwave for 5 min at medium heat, and then finish them off w/the butter etc. 
I can't wait to make it again!

This was very good and put shame to those quick packets of "oatmeal".  I halved the recipe.  After the oats had cooked it was a little more watery than I thought it should be.  I removed the oatmeal with a slotted spoon to the bowl.  I  only added a small amount of the brown sugar so I could taste for sweetness.  The non-dairy creamer really scared me.  My family doesn't drink coffee but my parents do.  When they came to visit they had recently brought fat-free Coffee Mate French Vanilla non-dairy creamer.  I decided to use a small amount of the coffee mate powder with half n half.  I loved the outcome of this oatmeal!  It was smooth and creamy.  This will become a regular breakfast dish for us!

I made this in one large pot and used Lactose Free Whole Milk the first time and Lactose Free skim the second time. The whole tasted better but it wasn't a significant difference. This oatmeail was outstanding! I added: 1/3 cup raisins, 1T cinnamon, 1/8t vanilla and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. Delicious!

Good oatmeal. Doesn't need all the sugar it tells you to use. And I like mine without milk, so I didn't use the creamer or the milk with it.

This is omg good! :) I used steel cut oats and then added the brown sugar to the pan. No salt, butter or milk, and used 1/3 cup powdered creamer since all my liquid ones are the holiday flavors. Delish!!

I bought a bag of rolled oats that didn't come with cooking instructions, or the water to oats ratio.  I was glad to find this recipe.  The oats turned out perfectly.  After they were done cooking, I just mixed all the brown sugar, butter and milk in the oats right in the pan, then served it in the individual bowls.  We only had amaretto creamer and wasn't in the mood for that mixed with oatmeal, so just skipped the creamer.  Did add cinnamon though.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I've tried making homemade oatmeal before and no one would touch it. So I was a bit hesitant about making it this morning, but they loved it! Some even went back for seconds. The only thing I would recommend is that you season to your taste. Just to clarify the 'they' are my 6 younger sibs 9yrs to 1 yr. old.  I definitely plan to experiment with apples, peaches, etc.

This is very good. I added a handful of raisins while it was cooking, so they could plump up. Filling and comforting.

Yummy!! My DD and I had this for dinner tonight. We did add a little cinnamon because we like that but this was wonderful. She has become quite fussy about her food lately and she gobbled this up in no time. I think that gets this recipe 5 stars just for that alone. Thank you for sharing such a yummy and comforting recipe.

Simple, tasty, and healthy.  Could cut back on the 2nd tablespoon of brown sugar per serving and still be yummy.  I used unsweetened almond milk in place of creamer and it was good.  Also added some raisins.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I think the first butter and brown sugar could have just been mixed directly into the pot after the oatmeal was done. I have been making oatmeal for years, according to the package, and then topping it with a sprinkle of sugar, a tsp. or so of butter, and a little low-fat milk to taste. This was pretty much the same concept, but I wanted to try a recipe. I did half the recipe and used half and half creamers for the non dairy creamer. Although, it tasted pretty good I will stick with my usual method. It is a little quicker and I normally use at most 1/2 to 1 tsp. of sugar, and this had quite a bit more in each bowl. I did like that this is a very traditional recipe flavoring the oatmeal with just butter, sugar, and milk.

Simple and yummy. For the creamer, I did half milk, and half 1/2 n 1/2. I also didn't need the extra brown sugar on top, so I left it out.

I hate oatmeal. Always have, and thought I always would - Until this recipe. I jest not, as I was looking for a healthy breakfast alternative to doughnuts or other fried foods, when I came across this recipe. I DID make some modification to suit my taste - per other suggestions (and I had no creamer), I substituted milk for creamer. I also lowered the amount of creamer/milk to a little over an 1/8th of a cup - I enjoy my oatmeal a mushy consistency. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla flavoring, ground cinnamon (about 1 tbsp., as I really enjoy the cinnamon kick). I also added 1/2 tbsp. of maple syrup, chopped pecans, raisins, and sliced banana. Sweetened to taste with Splenda as well, since I've always been frustrated with the lack of bold flavor and sweetened taste in oatmeal. It really helped kick up the flavor factor and was absolutely delicious. I even omitted the fruit one morning and enjoyed basic oatmeal. This recipe has changed my outlook on oatmeal and provided me with a healthier choice for breakfast foods (very filling and nutritious!)

Great taste! Chewy and yummy! Definitely tastes like something you'd get at your grandparents' house.  :o)  I only had quick oats, so I cooked them according to the directions on the package. And I didn't have creamer, so I used milk, but I thought 1/4 cup of milk per bowl made it a little too soupy. Next time I'll use less milk as I like my oatmeal to be thicker.

This was pretty good.  I added cinnamon and raisins but thought that it was too much non-dairy creamer...I would use less to taste next time.  My kids loved it, but it was just too creamy/mushy for me.

A good and simple recipe. I cooked up a single serving and the oatmeal came out a bit watery (used 3/4 C water and 1/4 C skim milk) and will use less water next time... and maybe thicker milk.

This was delicious!  So much better than the instant packs of oatmeal.  I used French Vanilla liquid creamer, not a full 1/4 cup, but just to taste and a tablespoon of milk.  I also dashed a little cinnamon on as well.  Came out great!  Very fulfilling.

Great, easy, and filling breakfast!  The recipe doesn't say if you use liquid or powder creamer.  We always have French Vanilla liquid creamer on hand so that's what I used.  It didn't need the full 1/4 cup creamer or the milk.  I'll probably only do 1/8 cup liquid creamer next time because the flavored creamer made it a lot sweeter!  Then I can add the Tbsp of milk also and not have it too runny.  It's very easy to scale for larger or smaller servings and tastes excellent!

Very good & easy.   Do add cinnamon & a touch of vanilla.  Since my dad & husband like different consistencies, serve the milk/cream on the side & let them finish it to their taste.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was really good! I didn't think it would taste very good while I was making it, but I don't know if it was the combination of the melted butter with the oats, or what....but it tasted amazing! I added a dash of vanilla while cooking, and I used real butter...it has to be the real thing! I also threw blueberries and strawberries on top- and me and three of my kids gobbled it up! I will definately be making this again!

Very good oatmeal recipe. You can certainly tweak it to make it as thick or thin as you like. I have never put butter in mine before. Trying this was new for me even though I've been eating oatmeal for 30 years.

I do not like the oatmeal it seems the majority of people like so that is what made this recipe so enjoyable. There was substance to it! I make some modifications. I cut the butter in half and the brown sugar to one tablespoon per serving. I also had almond slivers that needed to be used so I added them and craisens because my husband likes them with cereal. This is the oatmeal I wil make from now on! No more instant oats.

Extremely bland, I ended up adding almost double the brown sugar and syrup, and threw cinnamon in as well to give it flavor. But the brown sugar gave it a nice taste different then the white sugar my traditional recipe calls for.

Very good oatmeal.  Much better than the instant stuff.  I like my oatmeal very thick, so I added less liquid.

I also sprinkled some cinnamon, chopped pecans and raisins on top.

I absolutely loved this oatmeal! Thank you so much for sharing it! I added cinnamon along with the brown sugar to top the oatmeal with and it added a nice kick! I'll be having this oatmeal very often.

Very good oatmeal!  I used milk instead of the creamer and cooked the oatmeal in the microwave.  I might add raisins or dried cranberries next time.  So good!

My whole family enjoyed this oatmeal. My kids even request it for lunch or dinner. I used a vanilla nut coffee creamer for the non dairy creamer and it turned out great....atleast for our taste buds:)

So delicious, although like another reviewer my oatmeal was a bit watery when done cooking. No problem, I just spooned out the oats from the remaining water. I scaled the recipe for two servings and only used brown sugar to mix in, opting to top with honey instead. I used rice milk instead of creamer and also used a vegan margarine. Wonderful breakfast!

This is the best oatmeal I have ever had - Don't tell my mother. I only made one serving, but went a little heavy on the butter (used yogurt brummel and brown margerine) and the brown sugar. Used cinnamon vanilla liquid coffee mate. I can't wait to try our tiramisu flavored coffee-mate next! Absolutely fantastic.

This was a yummy oatmeal!  Very creamy and smooth. 
Next time I will add less vanilla creamer and more milk, as it was a touch too sweet for my taste.

Very good.  My kids ate seconds even.  I used about 1/2 cup of powdered dairy creamer and 3/4 cup milk and added cinnamon and raisins and a touch more brown sugar and butter to the whole pot instead of doing it to portions and it tasted great.  Creamy & flavorful.  Thanks so much for this easily adaptable recipe.  This would be great with any fruit. Updates: I used strawberries for a a strawberries and cream taste and it was delicious as well.  I have used frozen mixed berries with great success as well.  When I do not have the dairy creamer I have substituted using Milk or even powdered milk.  This is the creamiest tasting oatmeal.  I really enjoy it.

I made this for my 7 month old son and myself this morning so it was only 1 serving.
Took out 2 tablespoon of cooked oats for baby and left the rest for me.
I used just a tiny bit of salt and added salted butter (as called for) with mine and around 1/2 a teaspoon of unsalted butter for baby.
I used a splash of full fat cream for both baby and I and added milk to our desired consistency. 
The consistency was roughly the same for the both of us as I used less milk for baby because his already had more cream than mine.
I also used the amount of brown sugar called for in the recipe for my portion but none on top and added a dash of cinnamon powder for the both of us.
I thought it tastes great though it was quite sweet.
I reckon it's because my portion had 2 tablespoon less of oats to share the sugar with ;)
My son almost finished his portion and that is especially great! I'll definitely be making this again!

I rated it only a 4 because I did not follow directions completely - mainly because we didn't have non dairy creamer and never buy it because we do not like it. I did, however, do pretty much everything else, but added the ingredients into the pot after the oatmeal was done instead of adding to individual bowls. I usually don't review altered recipes, but I HAD to say that the BUTTER in the oatmeal did the whole dish! I rate my own changed version a 5 and want it again for breakfast tomorrow!  I added a tad more butter than what it called for because it was so darn good. Who knew I was missing out for so long? Will def. make this part of our weekly rotation of breakfasts!

Never thought to put butter in oatmeal. Delicious! Makes the texture much more creamy. Also, the addition of cinnamon is a must.

Put the water and oatmeal in a bowl and stick in the microwave.  Heat it.  Take it out and add brown sugar, milk and butter.   My kids do this all the time.   So much faster.   Why is the brown sugar on the bottom?   Don't you stir it anyway?   My aunt used to add Milnot to mine instead of milk.   YUM.

For at least 50 years, I have been eating oatmeal like this, especially in the winter. I make the oatmeal according to the directions on the box and add a large dolop of butter/margarine and a really big tablespoon of brown sugar. I like my milk in a glass instead of on my oatmeal. It will warm you up on a cold winter day. I now make it for my grandkids when they are here.

My mother made these for us when we were young and I'm an older woman now.They were/are delicious. It helps to warm the potatoes in the microwave before using this recipe. Lukewarm will do, and as some suggested, a little flour does wonders holding it together.

What exactly is non- dairy creamer? Is it powdered skim milk or soy milk from a packet? We are in Australia and I have not seen this in the shops!

Remember to SOAK OATS OVERNIGHT. Not only does it make it digestible, they make them taste better/creamier too.  Quick Oats have already been soaked overnight.
