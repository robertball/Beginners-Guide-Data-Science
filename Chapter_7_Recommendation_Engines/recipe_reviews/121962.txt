I didn't measure exactly, and I put them in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes instead of back in the microwave at the end. But with these changes they tasted great.

I thought these were delicious but I think a little less alfredo next time. I could taste potato anymore and they were a bit runny. Next time I will use 1/2 cup alfredo and maybe add some bacon bites

These turned out really good.  I did use homemade alfredo sauce and also added sauteed onion.  This was really good. I think next time I will try half and half to cut back on the calories. Thanks for the post.

This was great!  I didn't microwave, though.  I also added crumbled bacon on top with cheese.  My husband loved it, and he hates baked potatoes (and doesn't care much for mashed potatoes).  I will make these again!

I don't know what it was but this wasn't as easy for me to make as the recipe made it seem. The alfredo sauce was a bit over powering too.

DELICIOUS! These got two thumbs up from everyone in the house, but especially my little guy, who ate two on his own, lol. I did use smaller potatoes (about 4 of them) and baked them in the oven rather than the microwave. I only used 3/4 cup of alfredo (that was plenty), and omitted the thyme because I don't care for it.. I could totally see adding some green onion or chive in these as well. These will definately be made again, and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really liked these potatoes! I took mine to work for lunch with some leftover jarred alfred sauce, so I just assembled them and put in a tupperware container and warmed them in the microwave at work. So good!!!!

Yum!  Very easy to make - if only I had better skills at scooping out the guts of the cook potatoes, but my lack of ability does not negate the yummyness of these!  Like others, I popped mine in the oven for a few minutes instead of remicrowaving for the second time, but otherwise followed the recipie.  Will definately make again!

I added ranch dressing instead of Alfredo sauce the first time I made these and they were a huge hit!!  My 12 year old son finished 4 halves!

They were ok, but making them in the microwave does not work. I've tried it twice the way it says and maybe I just don't have a good enough microwave but they end up taking 10x longer to get soft than they are supposed to, so I give up and pop them in the oven. The overall end product is nothing too exciting but at least it's easy enough to do. I probably wouldn't recommend.

Nice flavor with something I consider typically boring (a baked potato).  It was inexpensive and easy to make as long as you let the potato cool enough. Thanks for the recipe.

Does the recipe really say only cook for 6 min in microwave? They turned out terrible. I'm not sure if They need 20 minutes more in the oven or something, but I don't get it. Whoever made this recipe should also specify size of potatoes. The looked good and the sauce was perfect, but I am looking for an answer because I never cook potatoes and I am confused.

Delish. I followed the recipe but I put the potatoes in the oven at the end instead of putting it back in the microwave. (Broil)

I didn't make the Alfredo sauce, I bought it and it was roasted garlic Alfredo but i added garlic powder anyway and put some bacon on the top. But wow!!! 
It turned out to be delicious!!!
I will recommend to a friend!

This was really good! Although I think I could have baked the potatoes longer and mashed the mixin's some more. All together the recipe was great, my friends loved it!

These were very good. The whole family loved them.  I was happy to do these in the microwave so I could use my oven for my remaining dinner. The only thing I might do different next time is use more Alfredo Sauce and maybe stick them in the broiler for a minute or two to give them that quick crispness that the oven usually does. Thanks!

Very yummy, however, i found that if you make this recipe it will take five potatoes rather than two. But very good! Everyone ate them ALL!

I made this with marinated steaks and it was an excellent side! My husband, who doens't particularly care for Alfredo, took a second serving. Hat's off to you for a wonderful recipe. Yummy!

I doubled the recipe and there was way too much thyme.  Just a pinch would suffice.

5 thumbs way up, from my house! The only changes I would make would be to eliminate the mozzarella (didn't think it added anything that I couldn't do without) and topping the potatoes with crispy-cooked bacon bits before putting in the oven. BUT none of the changes could raise my rating because they were yummy as written!

These are really good when you get them finished. I agree with everyone else that said the timing is off. There is no way you can cook two large potatoes in the microwave for only 6 minutes....let alone if you are making several for a larger family. I knew that though so I wasn't disappointed any. The flavor is great though and I'll be making them again.

We did not like these at all. As far as my husband is concerned potatoes and cheese are their own food groups and even he wouldn't eat them. Definitely won't be making these again.

These were amazing...made it for friends and they loved it...and my hubby couldn't eat enough:-) I added some crumbled bacon and dried onion flakes and it made these potatoes over the top! I also had to microwave them for a total of about 14 minutes and then I baked them in the oven for about 15 minutes when they were stuffed. Will definitely make them again!!!

This is one of my go to recipes year round. I bring it to the family BBQ with cheeseburgers, I also love this as a compliment to a marinated steak or honey mustard chicken. The only change I made was in the pot of alfredo sauce I used 1/3 cup mozzarella and 1/3 cup Sargento Mexican blend cheese. (I found the cheddar too bland and creamy, I liked the little kick from the mexican cheese much better.) Likewise on top of the potatoes, I used another 1/3 cup of Sargento Mexican blend cheese. The one time I was out of mexican cheese and did use cheddar there was a noticeable lack of taste. Too creamy, even with sharp cheddar.) However, with the mexican cheese it is a 5 star recipe! They also save nicely wrapped in foil in the fridge. Stick a few on a baking sheet and pop 'em in the oven on a busy night just to reheat them.

I baked the potatoes in the oven for an hour - that way you get crispy/chewy skins - and I put them back in the oven to brown as well
