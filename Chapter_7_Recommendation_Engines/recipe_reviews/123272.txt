This dressing was super-easy to make and I thought it was very good!  I also liked it because it was zero-fat (I used nonfat yogurt) but it still had a creamy texture.  This tasted so much better than no-fat bottled dressings (and better than many regular bottled dressings, for that matter).  The dijon mustard also adds a nice kick.  I put this over a green salad with hardboiled eggs and chopped up chicken.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

I would double this recipe the next time around so I'd have plenty of extra to get me through, but keep the garlic the same (my family likes garlic but not in large doses).  The tang from the yogurt paired well with the zing of the dijon, this was nice and light and super easy.

This was good, but I do feel that it was missing something, not sure what tho. I did add some salt and that helped, but it needs something else too. When I first mixed this up and tasted it, I was NOT a fan, but after letting it set in the fridge for a while it was way better and then even better on the salad. It did have a 'french dressing' taste to it, and I loved that there was no fat. I will play around with this some more. Thanks for sharing. :)

Tasty - I think I will add some herbs or spices next time. I like that it contains no oil so it is a healthier dressing for salad.
