Really tastes different that your standard spag & meatballs -- has a killer kick!  I added cumin to the meatballs and sauce, b/c if it's Mexican I feel ya gotta have the cumin, and also added a diced jalapeno to the sauce.  Great variance to a weeknight staple!

I forgot to add that 3-5 cloves minced garlic should be added to the ground meat mixture. Enjoy!

I made this exactly as written and garnished with cilantro and loved it. I could not find guajillo powder but I did find whole dried guajillo chile's in my Hispanic section. Before tossing them in my old coffee grinder for powder I sliced them open and removed the seeds. I decided to dig a hole and toss the seeds in my garden a couple of weeks ago and I have a couple dozen pepper plants coming up. Not sure what will become of them but it was fun. This Mexican twist was a nice change from your every day spaghetti. Thanks for sharing!

5 Stars for the idea because I Totally changed it to a "Mexican Style Spaghetti Meat Sauce."  This may not seem a "fair" review in some peoples eyes, but I REALLY appreciate the idea!

Use ground beef and eliminate tostadas, bread crumbs, olive oil (unless using a real lean meat), essentially all the meatball stuff.  Brown meat with remaining meatball ingredients.  Combine sauce ingredients and cook together in a saucepan then combine with meat and serve over pasta.  1 or 2 pounds of meat?  I don't know, I'll have to figure that out.  1 or 2 pounds of pasta?  Same thing.  It's going to be fun working on this one! :-)

I used beef not turkey. Left out the hot peppers and put in a can of Ro-tel instead of tomatoes. It was wonderful!

Great!  Pretty easy too; I have little ones so I left out the jalapeno and Anaheim and I used about 4 cups fresh tomatoes from our garden instead of the canned.  Will make again!

Wonderful. Whole family loved it!! I added about 1 t minced garlic to the meatball mixture and the sauce. In addition I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. I will make this again for sure.

I loved this recipe.  I chose to brown the meatballs in olive oil in a large skillet on both sides and then simmered them instead of baking them in the oven.  I used Hunts brand Roasted Garlic & Onion sauce and it turned out delicious!

I added more cheese to the meatballs and or under cooked them a tad bit, cause the consistancy was off.  My children didnt like the meatballs, but ate the sauce and noodles.  My husband however, enjoyed it all very much. it was okay to me, the spice was nice, but too much sauce and had a hassle getting all the different peppers.

I was having friends over for dinner so I thought it'd be a good time to try this recipe.  I couldn't find a type of chili powder that was called for; however, I was able to sub a few things but, nothing I'll share.  Just note that it turned out great and they went home happy and one is sleep on the couch.  The meatballs sort of took me back to when I was a child so it was fun making those too.  I might have gotten carried away with the peppers because my lips are just cooling down.  I'll definitely make this again, I'm thinking to an office potluck for something different.

These meatballs tasted just like the tostadas, so that was weird. The sauce was good. This had potential but could have been a lot better.

Absolutely loved this tasty recipe and so did my hubby!  I made the meatballs as written using crushed tortilla chips, yummy!  I added some cumin and taco seasoning to the mix along with some fresh chopped cilantro & minced garlic.  I played a little more with the sauce, sauteed the onion with minced garlic, then used Barilla garlic Neapolitan as the base, and Rotell for the diced tomatoes.  I also added a 4oz can of diced green chilis, too.  I spiced this up with some cumin and more taco seasoning.  I also added a good handfull of chopped cilantro to the sauce.  What a great dish.  This would be fun for Cinco de Mayo!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Sachin.

Only reason it wouldn't get a perfect score is because it was pretty preparation intensive and ended up being VERY spicy!

This recipe right here is a keeper. SO tasty. Definitely making this again and adding into my rotation. I would highly recommend it. It's a little spicy, but you can regulate the heat to your liking. I didn't use all of the peppers that they suggested, and instead of tostada shells, I crunched up tortilla chips. They really add another level of flavor to the meatballs. This would freeze well too.

What an incredible, unique dish!!! It was the perfect amount of spice for my hubby and me. My kids thought it was too spicy, but what do they know?! I didn't have the special chili powders it called for, so I just used the regular kind. I also used beef and not turkey (it's a preference thing). Other than that I followed the recipe completely!! Excellent twist on a classic recipe! Good work :)
