Great recipe.  I made it tastier and healthier as follows: skip the cheddar cheese all together, after the onion/celery, deglaze with a little white wine.  Kick it up with some red pepper flakes.  Must use fresh garlic and salmon.  Don't pre-cook your salmon, there is no need.  Add chunks in raw and then let it simmer, they cook very quickly and will also be much more tender in the finished soup.  Also use fat free evaporated milk and thicken with corn starch. A splash of fresh green peas and Enjoy!!!

Very quick, rich and comforting.  But definitely use FRESH salmon and fresh garlic.  I've also used 1/2 smoked, 1/2 fresh salmon and the smokiness gave it a wonderful flavor, similiar to a good clam chowder.  However, the one big thing I would change about this recipe is to reduce the amount of cheddar to 1 or 1.5 cups, otherwise the original recipe ends up tasting too much like cheddar soup. 1 cup cheese is enough to salt and thicken it nicely.  Also, if making for company, I would eliminate the carrots - adds to much chunkiness to a dish that should be creamy and smooth.  Also, if just using fresh salmon, add a few teaspoons of liquid smoke for a nicer aroma-- makes all the difference.  This soup has been part of our regular rotation and is very healthy and kid friendly. My 4 and 1 yr. gobbles it up.

I really liked this recipe, but I did make a couple of changes. I used two 6-oz cans of boneless, skinless salmon, and it was plenty (I wonder if the "16-oz" can size is a mistake?). Also, I only used 1/4 lb. of cheddar instead of 1/2 lb., to help lower the fat content. It was very colorful and tasty. I'll definitely make it again.

Hello, I gave this recipe 5 stars after modifying it a bit. Thanks to all those posters before me for their advice!  My husband now rates my version of this soup ("smoky salmon chowder") as his favorite soup we've tried thus far!

The following changes make a "smoky" version of the original and requires liquid smoke. If you don't like that smoky flavor, you might not want to follow my advice. However, if you do like smoky flavor this is to die for!

Use:
1 LB Fresh Salmon smoked on the barbecue; use 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic; omit the carrots; double the dill weed; use only 1 cup of real cheddar cheese; and finally, as the soup is finishing add TWO capfuls of Wright's Liquid Smoke into the soup.  Serve with artisan bread and enjoy!!

Delicious!  Will definitely become one of our regular rotations.  I made a couple changes, but followed the recipe mostly.  I used 3 single person size fillets of fresh salmon.  Wrapped in foil and baked at 375 for 20 mins.  I omitted the creamed corn (husband doesn't like it) and instead of Cheddar (I don't like the UK cheddar) used mozzarella.  DELISH!

Addtition:  We tried this again without carrots and it was still great!

IT FREEZES BEAUTIFULLY!!  Can't even tell it was frozen.  I defrosted on the counter for about 2hrs, then reheated in a saucepan.

This is a great recipe.  I used the small 6 oz. cans of Salmon and fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, and subsituted fat free evaporated milk to cut some of the fat.  I also used a cheddar-jack cheese blend instead of just cheddar, and used only half the 8-oz bag (I passed the rest around upon serving).  What a delicious and easy soup!! YUM!! My husband loved it!! Definitely a keeper!! Thanks!! :o)

This was so good, that my '13-year-old-who's-so-picky-he-won't-eat-a-piece-of-chicken-because-a-mushroom-touched-it' liked it!  And he hates salmon!  WOW!!! What a winner.  The rest of us loved it too.

The recipe, as listed, is more like cheese soup with salmon in it.  Leave out the cheese, and you actually have a lovely salmon chowder.  We prefer this without the cheese.

This was an excellent recipe.  I made it for a late night dinner when we had guests coming over, and it was perfect with some french bread on the side.  People were asking for seconds! I would recommend leaving out the salt because the recipe is salty already.

This is a great recipe. I make a few changes but overall I keep it pretty close to the original. I use a little bit of olive oil for the onion, celery, and carrots instead of butter. And, I omit the evaporated milk and put some of the potatoes, celery, carrots and broth in my blender to thicken the soup. There's less calories and fat this way.

This was easy and VERY GOOD!! I used onion powder and celery salt instead of the called for ingredients.  I also added garlic powder, tarragon and some parsley for color.  A great chowder base even if you don't use salmon

This was VERY good.  I made it for a group and it was a hit.  I used fresh salmon that I baked prior, and it was yummy!  Will defintely make again.  Was more of a corn chowder with salmon.

really good. My husband loved it. I didn't use canned salmon. I pan fried fresh salmon in butter and olive oil and seasoned it with salt and pepper. Then broke the finished fish into bite size pieces and added it to the finished soup.

I think this chowder tasted great as is! Didn't have to change a thing!  Also, @ MommyFromSeattle: how much do you think a half pound of cheese is? Let me break it down for you. 1 lb= 16 oz. 16/2= 8. 8 oz.= 1 cup.

This was very good, especially considering my substitutions! I am on a no dairy diet, so I used unsweetened almondmilk instead of evaporated milk, and surprisingly, this soup was delicious!

This was truly a hit with my family! I used fresh salmon (just cut in chunks and add to the simmer), fresh garlic, shredded carrot ( a handful, which I added to the saute), double the dill and added about 1/2 cup white wine, basil, parsley and chives. Used a Mexican blend cheese (1 cup) and served with Cheddar Bay biscuits and a salad. Definitely plan on making this meal again. Leftovers were delicious as well. Thank you KENULIA.

AMAZING.  I love getting salmon chowder when we're at a medium-high to high-end restaurant because those seem to be the only places that do a decent job of it - even here in the Seattle area where Alaskan salmon is abundant (don't get me started on that Atlantic salmon garbage).  This recipe is as good, if not better than, those restaurants.  Some may prefer a more creamy, less chunky chowder, but not me.  Don't get me wrong, this chowder was very creamy too, but just not more cream than substance like some places make it.  This was fantastic.  My 4 year old twin girls gobbled it down and my 6 year old only hesitated a little bit because he has a weird thing against corn (who doesn't like corn?  especially creamed corn?  whatever).  I will definitely be making this again.  It's great comfort food - especially for all the grey, rainy days we get here in the great Pacific NW.

Fabulous! Even my salmon-hating father liked it! I used fat free evaporated milk, added 4 cloves fresh garlic in addition to the powder, and omitted the cheese, to much success. Like others, I deglazed the pan of onion/celery/garlic/butter with about 1/2 C white wine before adding the broth, etc. Also, I used 1.5 lbs fresh, uncooked salmon that the butcher skinned/chopped for me; the salmon cooked (aka became opaque and light pink) as the soup simmered, and then I brought the soup to a boil over medium heat again just to make sure it was safe to eat.

I'm not a chowder fan and had canned salmon in the pantry, so I tried this.  It is delicious!  Try it with a few oz of smoked salmon chopped on top instead of the dill to really fancy it up.  This one has become one of our favorite soups.

Thanks Kenulia bit this was just OK for us. Following the advise of another reviewer I chose to omit the cheese which we normally would not include in a salmon chowder anyway. I used a fresh minced clove of garlic and fresh salmon in place of the garlic powder and canned salmon. If I make this again I would use less creamed corn because even with fresh salmon it seemed to overpower the dish. We thought it made it taste more like a corn chowder with a little salmon in it.

Oh my goodness is this good!!??? Just omitted the salt since  I used chicken bouillion which is already salty, and left out the dill weed. Oh, and used a nice big hunk of fresh salmon filet (just threw the whole piece of fish in with the vegetables before simmering for the 20 minutes- it broke up nicely on it's own!) and fresh garlic as I strongly dislike garlic powder. Wow! Surprising how good this stuff is!!!!! Thank you for sharing this!!!!!

I buy a fillet of fresh salmon and use the tail section for this recipe, substituting it for the canned salmon the recipe calls for. I've made it twice and it has been terrific each time. My son-in-law ate three bowls of it last night.

Outstanding!  My family loved it!  Only change I would make is adding maybe a 1/4 cup more of chicken broth.  It was a little on the thick side.

This was really good.  I used frozen salmon, thawed it out and threw it into the soup before simmering for 20 minutes.  I also took another reviewer's suggestions and deglazed the onions with white wine and skipped the cheddar altogether.  Didn't have celery so I just put in celery seed.  It was a little chunky so I used my handheld blender to blend it up a bit cause I still wanted chunks but a little creaminess too.

This is a great tasting chowder that we all were really pleased with. I'm not a fan of clam chowder, but this is a lot better than that and uses ingredients you usually have on hand. Definitely a keeper!

I made this using some leftover salmon we had grilled. Also used my own chicken stock and fresh garlic cloves to our taste...which is more than a teaspoon. Was very good...Used about two pounds of salmon. Not only was this a simple chowder to make, it tasted absolutely delicious. Since it was only my husband and I eating this I froze the remaining...will update how that turned out later. Update: This was great after being in the freezer for three weeks....just heated it back up on the stovetop...just as good the second time around.

Easy and fast! Cheddar is not needed, as the chowder was already super yummy without it. I used less butter, and used one salmon fillet in place of 1 canned salmon (just because I had some in the freezer). Will definitely make it again. Two thumbs way up!!!

I'm not a big salmon fan but have been looking for new ways to en-corporate it into our diets. This was a wonderful full bodied flavorful soup.  I will look forward to this again, especially on a cool evening when you need something warm and filling.  I made this as written except left out the celery.  Excellent new keeper!

This was very good but needs a few adjustments to take it to 5 stars. I would omit the salt and the cheese next time. I only added half the amount of salt and it was too much, and the cheese just doesn't belong. I took a hint from other reviewers and only used two small cans of salmon. They are right, there must be an editing error. It was plenty.

Really good easy recipe.  I used olive oil instead of butter, added lots of extra celery and carrots, fresh smoked salmon instead of the canned and lite evap. milk.  Great chowder!

OMG! Ok, really, this is fantastic. Friends that don't eat fish or are very picky ate this Salmon Chowder and loved it. I've been asked to make it again and again.  I added pepper flakes, liquid smoke, a little bit of peas and extra frozen or canned whole corn. Yum!!

This was very good, but not out of this world until I made some slight adjustments.  After stirring in all the ingredients it just seemed to be missing some subtle flavor.  So I added about 1 tsp. finely chopped fresh thyme and simmered half a bay leaf in the chowder for about 30 minutes more and what a difference!  Also, I only used about 3/4 tsp. pepper (white pepper for better visual appeal) and not as much cheese as the recipe calls for.  It was heavenly. Will definitely make this again.  BTW if you use the good canned red sockeye salmon, canned salmon works fine in this recipe, as long as you pick through it and remove the skin.  No need to remove the bones which are a good source of calcium and are so soft they need only be mashed up.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, quick and easy.  I used what I had on hand, substituted 2 thawed salmon filets for the canned, chopped into small pieces.  Also reduced cheese to 1 cup so it would not taste like cheese soup with salmon.  Also added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  This chowder tastes better than nearly any that you would pay $6.95 for a bowl at a restaurant.

Very good recipe. I followed it closely except for the following slight changes.  In the hot stock pot I added 6 slices of diced smokey bacon to crisp.   Removed the bacon and cooked the onion and celery in the bacon drippings.  I added the chopped crispy bacon back to the pot at the end!  I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper and about 1 cup total of grated white cheddar and asiago cheese.  Yum.

Very delicious recipe as is. Next time I may try red pepper flakes or something to add a little extra pep, though I may just leave as is. It was all eaten up that night. We used our home jarred alaska salmon and even the picky eater in the family had to agree it was pretty good. Thank you for sharing!

Not bad but I did modify a little bit.  I was trying to find a good way to use up some leftover baked salmon that was sitting in the fridge.  As it was, it was about 2/3rd of the amount called for in the recipe but it was plenty.  Also, I cut the cheese in half.  It seemed to me that I would be making glue if I added a whole 1/2 pound to the recipe.  I think I measured out to about 4.5 ounces of shredded Chedder/Colby/Jack mix.  The Salmon was already seasoned with kosher salt and dill.  Therefore, I eliminated adding any extra that was listed in the ingredients.  Anyway, with all that improvising, it turned out pretty darned good.  It was a great way to use up leftovers.  I packed a bowlful for lunch today and received a few compliments on how good it looked.  About 1 1/2 cups filled me up for the whole rest of the day.  Great winter meal.

Oh dear lord...this recipe is now at the top of our uber comfort food recipe list!!  This was absolutely wonderful and so delicious!!  My husband and I made this recipe earlier tonight, and now we are both in total euphoric food comas.  

We made just a few changes to the recipe.  Instead of garlic powder we used a few cloves of fresh garlic, instead of cream corn we used frozen corn, and instead of canned salmon we used fresh salmon.  Also, we added about a half a cup of heavy whipping cream when heating it through at the end, to add that extra bit of loveliness.

Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with the rest of the world.  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!!

I'm giving this 5 stars only because I can't give it more! This is DELICIOUS! I didn't make any changes from the original recipe; although I did use home canned salmon from a friend in AK. I'm sure I'll make this again and again!

Excellent!  Use FRESH SALMON though.  We don't enjoy salmon but since we live on the West Coast, we always seem to be given some.  THIS is the recipe to use up all that fish and impress the neighbours.

Very Yummy chowder.  I generally could live without soup, but this one is wonderful.  Healthy it up a bit with low fat evaporated milk and 1/2 the cheese :-)  I also added chopped red bell peppers for a bit of color and topped it with cilantro.  Mmmm mmmm mmmm.

I used three cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powdered, 1/2 tsp of salt, low-sodium chicken broth, and fat free evaporated milk. My picky husband loved it! Leftovers were saved and eaten as tasty lunches at work.

Delicious but one recommendation... done use canned salmon. Ours had little bones in it and the whole time I was eating my soup I was trying to pick out tiny bones. Next time I would precook the salmon and then add it to the soup!

I love this!  It is easy and yummy and I could have it once a week. My oldest son just ate 3 bowls.  This time I didn't have the celery or carrot (just added some extra potato).  I used skim milk.  It was quite wonderful.

This made a great soup.  Baked about a pound of salmon in the oven to substitute for the canned salmon and fresh garlic for the powder.  Didn't have carrots or cheese, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  It was a mild and tasty soup.  The fresh salmon tasted great!

An excellent soup to use leftover baked or grilled salmon.  I also used fresh garlic and cut back on the butter a little.  I wasn't going to add all of the cheddar, but since it was thickening the soup, I did eventually put it all in.  After tasting this recipe, I felt it needed a little cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke which made it just perfect.

This recipe is Amazing!  A delicious combination of flavors!  The only changes I made were fresh fish in place of the canned and no dill weed because I didn't have it on hand.  Very creamy and so tasty!

This was pretty yummy! I didn't change too much. I used 3-6 oz pouches of boneless packaged salmon, a little extra pepper and dill, Better Than Bouillon Chicken  and water (instead of chicken broth), and some potato flakes.  The soup was a little runnier than I like, so that is why I added about 1/4-1/3 cup of potato flakes, to thicken it up!

Very easy and good. I browned some thick, smoked bacon with the onions, celery and fresh garlic. Gave it a wonderful smokey taste. fresh salmon is also the way to go.

This was very good soup.  I used fresh salmon and browned it with the onions.   It was very easy to make and my family loved it with fresh cheese biscuits.

This was a fantastic chowder!  The texture of the vegetables contrasted well with the creaminess of the soup.  I used four frozen salmon fillets instead of the canned salmon.  I just broiled the filets in the oven until cooked, shredded them, and added to the soup.  

The creamed corn is a nice addition.  It gives the soup a subtle sweet flavor.  I cut back on the cheddar cheese...I just added about 1 to 1.5 cups.  Then I sprinkled the bowls of soup with extra cheese just before serving.  Delicious!

We use our leftover salmon or trout to make this fantastic chowder on a regular basis. I also subsitute a few ingredients: 1/2 tsp. choppped garlic instead of garlic powder and unskinned cubed red potatoes add a little color. A definite favorite in our house, even the toddler loves this one.

Oh, my!  I have one word--YUMMMMMMM!!!!  In order to add more fish to our diets, I was looking for a salmon something or other that would be at least tolerable, as neither of us care for salmon at all.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except I halved it in case we didn't like it.  No worries about that!!  This soup is now a permanent addition to my recipe collection.  Thanks, Kenulia!

Delicious!  We had some left over salmon from last night's dinner.  I didn't know what to do with it so I just searched "salmon" and this was one of the recipes that came up.  My family loved it.  I prepared it according to the recipe.  Will def have it again!

Instead of 2 cans of salmon, I used the frozen package of 3 salmon filets that had been in the freezer for like 6 months.  Also, not sure about the amounts in cups, but I used 2 celery stalks, 3 potatoes, one onion, and probably like 2 or 2.5 tsp of dill weed.  Our dill weed is like 100 years old, so it never gets used.  Baked and flaked the salmon.  There were some awesome-sized chunks in there.  It was even better the next day.

This was delicious! I cooked fresh salmon over the stove top instead of using canned salmon, only used a sprinkle of cheddar (I felt like it didn't need the cheddar. I didn't want the cheddar to disguise the delicate flavor of the salmon and it's also healthier to leave it out), and added some old bay seasoning.

Loved it and will definitely make it again.  Next time I will saute the onions in less butter, the amount (in my opinion) is largely unnecessary.  Also, I substituted real garlic for the garlic powder.

This is a great recipe...easy to prepare, quick and comfort food at its best!
I used a few of the other reviewers tips;  broiled 16 oz. fresh salmon (I use salmon belly trim, so it is extra high in fat), used fresh garlic.

This was delicious! I used fresh garlic and salmon (baked in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes, then flaked by hand) and left out the celery due to personal preference. My husband, who is not a soup person, said this was great! We will definitely be eating this several times in the next few months! Thanks for a really wonderful recipe!

This is a very easy soup recipe.  I made some this fall and froze some for Christmas time and it reheated GREAT!  It was a terrific hit and I will be making it again this spring for Lent!  Thanks for a good recipe. :)

Very good chowder.  Because there are so many salty ingredients, I used no-salt butter and no-salt creamed corn.  I also used low-salt chicken broth and only added 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Really let the rest of the flavors come through and we all loved it.  Even my young one who hates soup.

Yum!  I've made this a few times and it's always a crowd pleaser.  I make mine in the crock pot and use the packets of salmon rather than cans because my husband thinks canned salmon is "gross"...but I love it.

Very good, but I don't find canned salmon appealing with all the small bones (which the can says are edible). You can buy boneless canned but it is expensive. Next time I may buy frozen fillets.

That's a bomb!!! I skipped the cheese, just added some grated cheddar when served, and my son who hates fish swallowed a huge portion! It's very hearty and warming, and I think it's more healthier if cheese is omitted.

This was a good soup, but it still lacked something.  I give it 3 stars but my hubby gives it 4 stars.  I used fresh salmon and fresh garlic.  Next time I will make a broth from the salmon skin first.  I almost switched the dill for thyme, but i didn't.  I thought the dill was too mild tasting, so I will try the thyme next time.  Oh, and for those that don't like chunks of carrot, I shredded mine and they were soft like the potatoes.  I like the idea of this chowder so I will play around with it and then post my update.

This is an amazing chowder - I brought it to work for my lunch and several people tasted it and immediately wanted the recipe.  My changes: half the salt, 1% milk instead of condensed, no cheese.  Very tasty!

We really enjoyed this chowder. I used fresh leftover salmon in this and left out the cheddar cheese to reduce the fat and calories. We did not miss the cheese and it was very yummy. The chowder was nice and thick without it also.

I pretty much followed the recipe except:  Used two cloves of garlic and half a sweet potato, which gave it a great color, one tbsp  fresh dill and 1 cup cream instead of evaporated milk.  After potatoes were cooked i put half in blender to give it thickness.  It 
was heavenly and made so much we have to invite neighbors over tomorrow to finish!

I'm trying this for the first time today. Hope it'll turn out good. HDYKMD: You said that 8 oz, which is half a pound equals one cup. That is only true for liquid, dry ingredients are half that, meaning one cup of cheese is 4 oz not 8 oz. Look at any bag of shredded cheese that's 8 oz, it'll say that it's two cups. So this recipe actually calls for 2 cups not one like you thought.

very good! for a few dollars more, I would highly recommend fresh salmon. 1 lb seemed to be equivalent to 2 cans.  we also added 1 more cup of chx broth and regular canned corn instead of cream corn.  we will make it again!

Fast, easy, delicious. Modifications: I replaced the evaporated milk with skim milk, and the dried dill with two teaspoons of fresh dill. I also used 1 and 1/2# of wild caught salmon, two cloves of garlic, kernels from 1 ear of corn, reduced-fat cheddar, and 32 oz of chicken stock.

This chowder is great! I made it with frozen salmon because thats all that I had but it turned out awesome. I followed other suggestions and didnt pre-cook the salmon, I just put the cut up pieces in at the last minute. I also used about a 1/4 the amount of cheese, I really dont think it added anything so I will leave it out next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly and it looked and smelled pretty good until I added the cheese and then it became a consistancy that no one in the family could eat. I would not make this again because we were so turned off by that. The flavor was pretty good and fresh salmon is the way to go. I don't understand what happened with the cheese, but it wasn't good.

Fish chowder? Yuk! Well, I do like clam chowdah and I have a can of salmon and some aging potatoes that need to be used, so I guess I'll give it a try. Hmmmm! This is marvelous! Made a meal of it with some chicken salad sandwiches and it went over very, very well. I do see what one reviewer meant when they said it was their new "comfort" food! Thanks, Kenulia, for this wonderful recipe!

Okay. I hated picking through the bones and skin of the salmon. Next time I'll look for canned salmon without bones and skin. Also, next time I think I'll use 1/2 of the cheese, and go with low fat cheese to lighten it up.

This is really tasty chowder.  I changed a few things to lower the sodium content(i'm fairly restricted): used frozen sweet corn instead of creamed corn, didn't add the salt and used a bit more dill.  Turned out great! (though, i'd add the salt if i was allowed)

This was REALLY good!  My 6 yr old daughter ate it up and said she really liked it.  I put too much salmon in it (my fault) so next time I will cut back.  I did add smoke flavoring to the salmon also.  Very good!

This is amazing and SO EASY.  First time I tried to make my own soup and glad that I did. Hubby is such a grouch from soup in the can so I tried this...now I am in trouble because he knows I can make soup now.  I did use fresh salmon (and just cooked it in the soup).  I can't imagine that it would taste as good with the canned stuff.  Had NO LEFTOVERS...and that is amazing since I doubled the recipe to freeze some for later (since other reviewers suggested that).  Definate thanks for the post....will be made many times more in our rotation.

Kenulia, I wanted to let you know that I froze a container to get my son-in-law's opinion.  He is an excellent cook.  I just received a phone call from him telling me it was the best that I had ever made.  He said that it was excellent restaurant quality. So there you have an opinion from an expert.  Thanks again for this wonderful dish.

Wow! Is this one ever delicious!  I had a big slab of Costco salmon in my freezer (about 1-1/2 pounds) so I sauteed it up and used it instead of the canned stuff.  Soup was attractive and yummy.  My kids still ask for it.  Highly recommended!

Okay, I always have my doubts about canned stuff as main ingredients. And I have to say that this is an ugly soup, but despite that, it tastes suprisingly wonderful. Once the cheddar was added it had a strange color, hence the ugliness, and if you care about presentation then I suppose you could always just use white cheddar instead. Very good.

I just made this soup tonight, and it is great!
My kid's loved it! I only used 3/4  the amount of cheese called for and 2- 7oz. packages of boneless skinless salmon.( The new kind with no water added.)This is rich and elegant enough to serve to company. Kudos!

I didn't have any creamed corn and just omitted it.  I added some left-over steamed salmon instead of canned.  Even my 'non-fish-eating' 2 year old loved this soup. We had it for an easy, healthy lunch.

Amazing! Try it out, change a few things. You will not be disappointed.  I cook it for my family once a month.  I add green pepper and use frozen wild salmon I stocked away for the winter.  I do not add the cheese.  People that don't really like salmon will eat some and have seconds.

I agree with everyone else on here. Use fresh salmon! This was my first time using canned and I will never do it again! Picking through it was so gross! The finished product was tasty though. Used fresh garlic, added some liquid smoke, otherwise followed the recipe. Can't wait to make it again with fresh salmon and I think I'll cook the onions, celery and garlic in bacon like others have suggested. Yummers!

This was my first time making salmon chowder and I'm happy to say that it came out great! I used three 5 oz cans of pink boneless and skinless Chicken of the Sea salmon. I put in a little more than 2 cups of diced potatoes, I used 2 regular sized Russet potatoes and doubled the dill to 2-2.5 teaspoons. I used fat-free evaporated milk instead of regular evaporated milk and more than 3/4 cup of chopped onion, more like 1.5 cups. Instead of 1 teaspoon garlic powder, I used 4 fresh whole cloves of garlic that I sauteed with the onion and butter. I sauteed the onion, garlic and celery mixture in the butter for a little longer than suggested in the original recipe till the onions were a bit browned and caramelized since I wanted a little bit of a caramelized/smokey flavor to the soup. I omitted the salt & pepper since I used chicken flavored bullion which I combined with boiling water to make the chicken broth and the broth was salty enough to warrant omitting the salt. Instead of 1 teaspoon per 1 cup of boiling water for the chicken bullion, I added 1.5 teaspoons per 1 cup of boiling water.

Yum!  Made minor changes - more carrots and celery to get some more veg.  Skim milk for the evaporated milk.  Frozen salmon filets that I had baked ~ 1/2 way for the canned salmon. Didn't really measure the cheese, but suspect I used less.  Froze in individual servings for work lunch to reheat in the microwave.  DELICIOUS!

I added some diced bacon to the saucepan to cook first before melting the butter, and this addition was perfect.  I also used a can of cream of chicken soup, and 1 1/2 (soup) cans of milk instead of the evaporated milk.  Substituted frozen corn instead of the creamed corn.  Used fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  Used leftover barbecued salmon from an earlier dinner instead of canned.  Left out the cheese entirely.  My family devoured it!

This is a wonderful chowder. Followed it nearly exactly except added a tsp. of minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and then emulsified the onion, celery, pototes and carrots in the chicken broth (after they had cooked).  This gave the soup a nice creamy texture.  Then added the creamed corn and milk, heated through, and added 1.5 cups cheddar cheese and allowed to melt and heat before adding the salmon.  I had left over salmon that I had cooked on the grill in a butter/french dressing/lemon mixture (on foil) that added a lovely flavor to the chowder.  Also added about 1/4 tsp. liquid smoke.  Wonderful, wonderful is all I  can say.

Amazing soup with some tweaks. I cubed raw salmon (seasoned with Old Bay, dried dill and pepper)and added it with the potatoes. I added 4 cups of chicken broth. After the 20 minutes, I used a potato masher to break up some of the big chunks. I added a cup of frozen corn kernals, 1/2 cap of liquid smoke and 1.5 Tbs of Old Bay and 1/2 Tbs. black pepper. I used some corn starch to thicken. I left out the cheese. I served with oyster crackers. My kids loved it! One said "Wow, this has a little kick, but I like it." Definitely a keeper!!!

Great, simple recipe. But like many of the reviewers, my fiancé and I tweaked a few things.  We used leftover Copper River Sockeye salmon which was grilled on the BBQ and a small cooked lobster tail. After sautéing the onions, we cooked everything in a crock pot for 1 hour.  We don’t like celery, so that was excluded.  Instead of creamed corn, we used corn that was grilled on the BBQ. Instead of cheddar, we used just a little bit of gouda – not sure if I could taste it though.  Corn starch was added to thicken it up a little. All in all, the chowder tasted awesome.  We ate it with some sourdough bread.  Mmmm.

Great recipe! But it must be with real salmon and garlic. We also made a few other adjustments, instead of chicken broth we used vegetable broth and next time will only use one cup for a thicker, hardier soup.

Great recipe! I used left over salmon that I had BBQ on a cedar plank the night before, and it gave the soup a great smokey flavor. I left out the dill because I was not sure how it would mix with the smokey flavors from the wood, but I will include it next time. 

This is now one of my favorite soup recipes!

Wowza. What a great recipe.  I made a few substitutions due to necessity and keeping my calorie count down. I used 4 cups of chicken broth, skipped the cheddar, skipped the corn, used 1/2 can evaporated milk.  I used leeks  that I had hanging around, and a small onion.  I had fresh dill, so used that, chopped...maybe about 2 tbs., and fresh garlic. I also used a pound of frozen salmon (thawed).   This recipe was easy, smelled fantastic, and everyone loved it.  I offerred parmesan to sprinkle on top, and some used it, some didnt.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's great to have something different to serve, especially during Lent (using vegetable broth of course lol)  YAY!

I had to change things a bit since I didn't have the items on hand. I didn't have carrots, so I used parsips. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used about a cup of sour cream, and I didn't add any corn instead I added a cup of stewed tomatoes. RAVE REVIEWS from everyone, will make again.

I made this recipe for my husband & he loved it. The only thing I did different was I added a bag of shrimp & put the cheese on after I plated the dish. this was only because I forgot to add it while I was cooking. The only complaint was the amount since it was only for him.

SO good!  I didn't make many changes... just used fresh salmon instead of canned.  Broiled it on low until it was cooked through (seasoned w/ s&p).  Probably only used about 1/4 lb of cheddar cheese.  Delicious :)

Very delicious!  I added 5 pieces of bacon (chopped), which I had noticed as an ingredient in other chowder recipes.  Dish would have been delicious without the bacon, but did add some complexity to the flavor.  Reserve one piece of chopped bacon and a bit of the cheese to top the dish for great presentation.

DElicious chowder.  I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese - the pepper jack added a little kick and toned down the sweetness from the creamed corn.

Great recipe. My husband loves this one. The only thing I do slightly different is with the dried dill weed and the salmon. I add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of the dill weed instead of 1 teaspoon.  And I used fresh salmon NOT from a can.

This was awesome and a nice twist on the usual chowder.  I used the flaked, skinless salmon in a pouch, which worked really well.

I live in Alaska and as part of a commercial fishing family I have had salmon every way known to man.  This recipe has become a favorite for my family.  It is excellent every time I make it and stands up well to any emergency adjustments one might have to make.  I never use the dill or the cheddar and always add a a half cap of liquid smoke.  All around excellent recipe.

This was o.k., substituted fresh salmon for canned as well as fresh dill.    The chowder was a tad thin for me, could have been my choice of potato though (red).  Lacked real flavor, could probably use some bacon.

This is really an easy, delicious chowder.  I used about 1-1/2 lb of fresh King salmon (raw & cubed)I caught in Alaska last week instead of canned.  Other than that I followed the recipe and loved it!

This chowder was delicious. I made the recipe verbatim with the exceptions of using fresh salmon cut into chunks, fresh garlic, and a little less cheese. The balance of flavors came through perfectly. Highly recommended.

this is a very nice recipe.. I used fresh salmon that I caught the day before (nice to live on Vancouver Island)..Cut up in chunks and tossed in raw. I also cut the butter back and used No fat evap. milk to make it healthier.. VERY GOOD indeed!

This was a really good soup! A great new way to eat more salmon! To make a little healthier use olive oil instead of butter, LS/FF chicken broth and FF evaporated milk and reduced fat cheese.  I added a little extra black pepper before eating.

Great recipe!  I didn't follow it to the T- but was a great base.  I added red pepper, no carrot, extra dill, dried thyme, normal canned corn, 1LB smoked salmon, liquid smoke, red chili flakes, 1% milk, whipping cream, nonfat half-n-half- no condensed milk... really just a little of everything I had in the fridge :)  Totally impressed my meat and potatoes guy!!

As I was making this according to the recipe, I tasted it before adding the corn and cheese and thought it tasted fine just as it was. So I left it that way and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. (I did use fresh garlic instead of powder and added the liquid from the salmon. Probably used 2 1/2 to 3 cups of potatoes.)

I omitted the cheese, celery and corn, and added green beans just before putting the salmon in.  I also added a generous pinch of ground chilies, following another reviewer's suggestion to kick it up a bit.   It was absolutely delicious and we will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Kenuilia!!

Woaa!  Did I ever do good.  I used Alaska red salmon and included everything in the can.  I increased the veggies by 50% and included some of my dried Bhut Jolokia pepper powder!  I just used water, instead of chicken broth, and cut the sharp cheese in half.  This chowder rates a 10, on a scale of 1 to 5!

I didn't have evaporated milk so I substituted with 1/2 lowfat milk and 1/2 cream.  I also used fresh salmon, and I got absolutely rave reviews.

Good, but needs adjustments.  I used fresh salmon and  fresh garlic.  I slow cooked everything in a crockpot.  I used low sodium chicken broth and it still didn't need any salt.  Too much pepper if you omit anything. I used 3 medium potatoes and I added a package of low fat cream cheese and that made it perfect!

This chowder is AWESOME with a few modifications: use fresh garlic (2 cloves), use fresh salmon (if you're not in a place that you can get it, the canned will work, but you're sacrificing good flavor), and add the LIQUID SMOKE (2 cap fulls).  The liquid smoke is the secret ingredient that all will just savor.  Oh - and don't use a maple bacon, it'll ruin the smokey flavor.  All the other things, carrots vs no carrots, creamed corn vs no corn or regular corn - these things are adders that are for your personal tastes.  I like the cream corn & I leave the carrots out.  Yukon Gold potatoes seem to hold their crispness longer too.

wow, this was amazing.  i used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of evaporated milk, fresh salmon, and a bit more potatoes (red with peel), garlic, and chicken broth.  I also added a ton of pepper... i love peppery chowder. i also made a reux like the other reviewer suggested of 2T melted butter and 2T flour added in with the 1/2 and 1/2.  also used asparagus instead of zucchini, since that is what i had on hand. i think i will leave out the carrots next time and maybe use a lighter fish.  somehow i missed the cheddar all together! don't know how i missed an entire ingredient.  loved it without though.  thanks for the yummy recipe!!

Delish. Very rich, so I decided to hold back on the butter and use reduced fat evaporated milk. I also completely omitted the cheese. The key is definitely the creamed corn so don't omit it. Use lots of chopped parsley and cracked pepper to garnish.

This got rave reviews at a dinner party I threw last night.  Like other reviewers, I used filets of salmon instead of canned, and instead of evaporated milk, I used half'n'half and milk.  Great fall comfort food!

This recipe was great, even with some of the healthy changes I made!  Insead of conventional butter I used Earth Balance, I used veggie broth rather than chicken broth, I also opted for skim evaporated milk and wheat gluten in exchange for the regular evaporated milk, and used a couple tablespoons of nutritional yeast instead of cheese along with many of the suggestions offered by others (namely, the fresh salmon and addition of liquid smoke).  And since I didn't have any dill, and I'm not sure if I'd particularly like it with dill, I used fresh basil from my garden to top it off.  Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

Loved it. Husband really like it. Used canned salmon..but per other review input, I used only 1 can. Initially I thought I should have used both cans, but as a leftover..the tastes had melded more and I'm not sure I would add the extra can?  Actually thought it was better as a leftover.  I might try and lighten it up a bit next time by uping the broth/vege content and/or substituting some milk for the half and half..but I hate to mess with a good thing..thanks for sharing!!!

This was nice and tasty.  My husband loved it!  We fresh catch our own coho here in Oregon so I'm always looking for the best ways to accent the lovely salmon flavor.  I was really looking for something more bisque-like, creamy and smooth with loads of salmony smokiness.  This was chunky and not really fishy enough for me, but if you like a nice thick chowder and medium dose of salmon, this is a great recipe.  I used sweet walla walla onion, fresh garlic, red potatoes, white pepper, organic soy milk with a dollop of heavy whipping cream, and fresh grated romano and Tillamook smoked cheddar...omg the cheese was amazing!  I also deglazed as another reviewer suggested but with marsala.  Very, very tasty recipe...I might try food processing the veggies and add more salmon for a smooth bisque, but the chowder really was a hit!  Will make again.

I cut the recipe in hlaf & I did use canned salmon... while OK (& certainly quick & easy) I think I will refile this recipe in my leftovers file & save it for when I have leftover salmon. The taste wasn't bad (on the contrary) but I think the texture would be MUCH better w/ fresh salmon. I drained & rinsed my salmon (it helps to remove some of the canned, fishy taste), removed the bones & then took the advice of some reviewers & sprinkled it w/ a little liquid smoke. I omitted the celery  & carrots & added chopped, roasted red pepper instead. I added a bit of celery seed for flavor & subbed Old Bay for the salt but I only added a sprinkle or two, for fear of oversalting the dish. I also decreased the pepper, per reviews. I used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder & I added about 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels for texture. I think next time, I will use either half & half or heavy cream for the canned milk. Or I'll at least use a full fat canned milk...I used fat-free. Thanks for the recipe Kenulia! BTW loved the addition of the dill...good call!

WOW! THis might be the best soup I've ever made...although I made a few changes. I used no potatoes because the starch. Broccoli, onions, zucchini, red pepper,greenpeppers,mushrooms..basicallyanything I had in the fridge...anything will do! I used non fat milk and maybe 1/4 cup of cheese. I wanted to make this as healthy as possible. I wish I could give this 6 stars!!! I also used fresh dill weed.

Awesome chowder. And, if you're lazy mostly everything can come from a can!  It's a bit peppery, one could get away with a 1/2 teaspoon vs and whole one. Everyone I gave it too liked it, other than the pepper part.

Very good recipe.  I made a few alterations to the recipe.  I omitted the carrots and celery because I did not have them on hand.  I also used a red potato with the skin to give some color, fresh garlic rather than powder, and added cayenne pepper for some kick.  I used low fat evaporated milk and low fat shredded cheese.  Finally, I added some crumbled turkey bacon at the end.  It was very good and my husband commented that it looked like a professional soup!  Very easy weekday meal.  To amend my previous review, the second time I made this, I found the canned salmon to be way too "fishy" smelling, turning off both me and my husband.  I think fresh salmon is probably a must.

If we could give this recipe 6 stars we would.  It is outstanding even without the cheese, which we forgot to add. Growing up in a fishing family we all love a good seafood dish and this is a great one.  It is a good idea to use your leftover salmon, and as suggested by others fresh garlic.  This soup is easy to make and will definitely impress your family and friends. If they are anything like we are you should be finding yourslef too full for desert afterwards. 
!Viva la Salmon Chowder!

Tried 1/2 the recipe with smoked salmon and the other half with plain salmon. My husband said the smoked salmon was much more flavorful. All I could taste was the creamed corn, so if you don't care for that flavor don't make the soup.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I'm just starting to eat salmon and this hit the spot!  My husband requested it, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  While I was cooking it, he asked what it was and said "what happened to the plain 'ol salmon and potatoes"?  When he tasted it, he loved it!  It was too much for 2 people so we carried it to my in-laws.  They loved it also!  Wonder if it would freeze successfully?  I didn't add celery or dill because I didn't have any.  I used the cheese as a topping instead of an ingredient.  I would also recommend if you're using canned salmon and don't get to remove all the smaller bones, cook the salmon a little before you add the milk and other ingredients.  This will help the bones cook out.

Good basic chowder recipe. I enjoyed the mix of potatoes and vegetables. I used smoked salmon in my recipe and it came out great. The hint of cheddar with the smokey flavor was wonderful. The next time I make this, I will probably add more potatoes.

We used some smoked salmon and added peas. This was delicious the first day and as leftovers. We even froze half of it. It's still very tasty a month later reheated.

Took the advice described by previous posters and used fresh smoked salmon, and real garlic. Also, after I sautéed the veggies (in half butter and half duck fat), I deglazed with chardonnay.  Used smoked sea salt, and swapped the cheddar for Gouda & Parm. Threw in some sautéed baby bellas and fresh sweet peas near the end. (I like chunky, exciting chowder)

Omg this is great! I did use fresh smoked salmon instead of canned. I did not use dill because I don’t like it. This is the best soup! My husband went crazy over it.

I loved this recipe, but made a couple of modifications to suit. Based on other suggestions, I lowered the amount of cheddar cheese, used low fat evaporated milk, and fresh salmon cut into chunks which cooked while simmering the mixture. Delicious! I will make this again!

This was an excellent soup.  I used a fresh salmon fillet, which I highly recommend if you have it.  I just added it raw to the soup last and it cooked almost instantly. You can either cut the salmon up before adding or let it flake on it's own in the soup once cooked. I did not have creamed corn but since I have never used it before it was not missed.  I did add some coriander since I pretty much put that sh** in everything these days!

I made a few modifications to the recipe and we loved it. I used 2 cups of seafood broth instead of
chicken (but I will use chicken broth if I don’t have seafood broth available). Instead of canned salmon, I made blackened salmon with some salmon fillets and used a spatula to separate it into chunks. I skipped the dill weed all together because I don’t keep that in my kitchen. I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup of regular milk instead of
Evaporated milk. And I used regular canned corn versus cream of corn. I will definitely keep this one in rotation!!!

Very good. Only warning is that it makes A LOT of soup. We ate it for days. I'm not sure how it would freeze. We followed other reviewer's suggestions and used fresh salmon.

This is tasty, but the measurements in this recipe are way off: 32 oz salmon in total and 1/2 lb cheese?? I used two 213-g cans (about 15 oz in total) and it was plenty, and I just put a bit of cheese on the side to serve. Also there is no need for the salt and pepper at all. Don't add them!

did not care too much for this receipt and would have given it 1 star but my sister liked it so I gave it overall 3 stars. I did use fresh salmon as others suggested. Not to sure what I did not like but  think it was the cheese.. May try it again using different cheese???

Loved it!  Even my two very picky eaters ate some which can be a miracle in itself.  My wife thought that it was very good and she does not like fish!  The only changes I made were that I cut the butter and cheese in half to cut the calories a bit and used fresh garlic.

This was delicious. Like previous reviewers I would recommend using fresh garlic and fresh salmon. Leave out the cheese, the soup is plenty creamy without it, and leave out the carrots, and use double the dill weed. Very tasty and will make again!

This was really good, but I'm picky about fish so we used smoked salmon instead of canned.  

We've made this 3 times with a combination of smoked, canned, and fresh and the best time we only had smoked salmon in the soup.

This was very good. Changes I made were minor...used about a lb of fresh salmon instead of canned, fresh dill instead of dried, and half a can of creamed corn, half a can of regular (drained).  Thanks so much for a chowder recipe that deviates from the heavy cream recipes (not that I don't love cream, just nice to have something a little healthier)~

After suffering a injury to my face and having to eat soft foods for awhile, I got SO SICK of cream of wheat and bland soup. I set out on a search for the perfect salmon stew, and boy howdy, this was the perfect base for it. I omitted the canned salmon, cheese and evaporated milk, and I used fresh salmon and fresh garlic. The only other thing I did differently was I deglazed with white wine (thank you, previous commenters!) after the vegetables were sautéed, and then I used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. After the vegetables were very soft (probably softer than necessary, but a must for my poor broken bones) I added the raw salmon, a little liquid smoke, approximately two tablespoons of freshly grated Asiago cheese and a very small amount of roux for thickening. After maybe thirty or fort-five minutes at a soft simmer, this was absolute perfection to my taste buds. I cannot get enough of this goodness. Thank you so much to the original poster for sharing, and thank you to all of the commenters who shared their variation of this dish. It will forever be a favorite of mine.

This is my second time with this recipe. I used fresh salmon instead of canned and its wonderful. I have only just taken up cooking for fun and am eager to try new recipes. My wife and I had a Salmon Chowder at Hell's Gate on the Fraser River in Canada about 35 years ago. We never thought anything would recreate that wonderful soup. But this does.

The base (?) is amazing. So creamy and delicious. I made the mistake of keeping the skin on because I didn't want to wast anything. Huge mistake. The salmon skin made the soup way to "fishy". I really like fish but keeping the skin on made the smell too strong. I feel like the broth would work very well with chicken and dumplings as well. Will make smaller portions next time so I don't get sick of it. Almost forgot, this soup doesn't keep well-you can't freeze it because there's milk in it and even kept in the fridge the milk begins to separate after 2 days.

Thank you for this recipe.  We love chowder but since my husband can no longer have dairy and I can no longer have potatoes, we have had to forgo eating chowder.  I was able to use mashed chick peas in place of the potatoes and coconut milk in place of the dairy and come up with a tasty chowder.  I am grateful to those who post their recipes so I have a place to start when making my own.   My husband was so happy to be able to eat a chowder, it was a huge hit!  Thanks!

This was fantastic.  Instead of canned salmon I used 2 fresh salmon fillets, chopped and stirred in for the last few minutes of cooking. The small pieces of salmon cooked quickly in the hot soup.  My husband was very skeptical during the whole process but now it is his most requested dish.

Made it for lunch for my husband and I and it was a big hit. Like most reviewers before me, I modified the recipe to suit our tastes, which meant omitting almost all the cheese and using really good Alaskan salmon. So quick and easy to make, this will become one of my staples.

Our entire family loves this recipe!  I usually use frozen corn, and buy fresh salmon when on sale (I broil it, and freeze it in recipe size portions for later use).

I followed recipe EXCEPT: I used skim milk and then thickened the soup with cornstarch (didn't have evap on hand); added a splash of sherry; used 2 14.75 oz. cans of creamed corn instead of just one; used about 3/4 c. cheese; added liquid smoke, red pepper flakes and a bit of tobasco--all to taste; and I used a frozen salmon fillet that I added last and cooked about 5-7 minutes until salmon broke apart easily.  Served with fresh French bread and a spinach salad.  DEE-licious!  My hubby isn't a fan of salmon but I have NO trouble getting him to eat this!

Delicious! I was looking for a different way of cooking salmon to make it stretch further, and decided to try this recipe. It was really really good, and we're even going to make it for company. I used fresh garlic and salmon as suggested, and added the salmon at the end and simmered it for 5 minutes. Then, after the fish was cooked, I removed it from the heat and stirred in the cheese until it melted (I estimated and probably used about 2 cups, and it didn't taste too cheesy to me at all). I also thickened it with about 1-2 T flour. Since I used homemade chicken stock, I waited to add the salt, and probably used about 1/2 tsp or less. Definitely keeping this recipe!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I grilled 2 lbs of salmon with a little salmon seasoning on top. (Chef Prudhomes)  We ate about half of it and I used the left-overs for this chowder.  So good.  I mean I could eat it everyday! Only other difference is I used about a cup of frozen corn instead of the creamed corn.  But that's only b/c it was what I had on hand.  I'm sure it would be creamier with the creamed corn. My 7 year old daughter even raved about it!

Skip cheese, use frozen salmon, add red bell pepper, scallions, basil, and parsley.  Could use a little heat next time.  Very good!

I followed recipe exactly.  Took a LOT longer to make than stated. BOO! I Love Smoked Salmon and this was very smoked salmony we just didn't like it. It tastes exactly as described a smokey salmon chowder. It's not the recipe posters fault it's just our taste buds.

I don't eat seafood, so I can't comment on this personally, but I made it for my husband and he really liked it a lot (and isn't a big soup fan).  I did, however, use fresh salmon (I got the stuff in a can and almost threw up when I opened it because it stunk so bad - and was full of tiny little bones.. and it was NOT the cheap stuff).    I also didn't use onions because my husband loathes them, and used minced garlic instead of  powdered.I also used a bit less cheese than called for.

I really thought this was tasty!  I also tweaked it a little b/c I didn't have evaporated milk in my pantry, so I used heavy cream instead. I didn't use as much cheese.  Also, I used a bag of frozen stew veggies (all the same as listed in recipe).  All stuff I had on hand and still tasted delish.  I served it with cheesy garlic bread! Yummy!

With the exception of not using canned salmon, (I used frozen filets from Sam's, that I baked at 350 degrees from thawed for about 12 minutes), I made this recipe pretty much as written. I thought it was great! I think this might be equally good with shrimp. Update: It gets better after a day in the fridge.

This was surprisingly good! I used frozen fillets as that was what I had. Skipped the cheddar and replaced with sprinkling of Parmesan. Wished I had added more corn though.

Very good recipe that produced a nice chowder. I decided to swap fennel for the celery as a change of pace.  Would suggest using fresh dill,and more gaclic powder to pick up the pices some more.

This chowder was so good! I did make a few changes to it. Used fresh salmon instead of canned, doubled the dill weed because I love it, and added some liquid smoke to the chowder as well. Very delicious!

Really good! I used 2 cloves fresh garlic and about a 14 oz. piece of fresh salmon, letting the salmon cook in the soup, and about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Even better the next day. I might try a little liquid smoke next time. This is one of my favorite soups!

Very good & easy - used fresh salmon - didn't taste fishy so the kids loved it. Used some fat-free cream instead of eva. milk, then creamed it a bit with a hand blender. Added bit of Liquid Smoke, great suggestion!

Loved it!

I have had a salmon chowder before and I loved it, however I was intimidated to make one because my attempt with soups, quite frankly, has sucked. 

I followed this recipe, however I forgot to add cheese, but it was still fantastic. I did use a roux though (melted butter with some flour) to thicken the broth. Also, a Jamie Oliver method for thickening chowders, I used a potato mash on just one end of the pot, just to mash a bit of the vegetables and salmon that will add thickness, but not to the entire pot because I like it chunky also. 

Thanks very much for this recipe. Making it again tomorrow.

this soup is amazing!
I baked my own fresh salmon for it. Its also kind of a thicker soup and my boyfriend likes to put it over a baked Pillsbury biscuit. The only thing I didn't add was the salt. I've made this three times now and love it!

What a great chowder! I followed the recipes except I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of evaporated milk. And I did take suggestion to add 1 cap of liquid smoke at the end. served with hot buttered rolls instead of crackers. Will make this a favorite recipe.

Very yummy.  I used about 2tbsp minced garlic instead of dry.  I ran out of can milk so I used regular milk.  I also used only a very small amount of cheese - still tasted great!

Was good as written, but being on a restricted sodium diet I had to make some adjustments, like using unsalted butter, sodium free chicken bouillon, eliminating the salt and reducing the amount of cheese. All of which I don't think affected the overall finished product. Next time I might reduce the creamed corn as I felt between that and the carrots, it made it a bit too sweet for me and I may broil a piece of salmon to reduce the sodium even further. Thank you Kenulia for posting this easy  & flavorful chowder recipe!

WATCH THE SALT
 
I used packets of smoked salmon, camper/hunter's kind.  The recipe was too salty, so I doubled the corn.  Delicious.

Awesome!  I made it with leftover baked salmon, homemade broth (made from leftover smoked cornish hens), and leftover french fries, sweet potato fries and carrots (waste not, want not!) and added the other ingredients as per the recipe.  It came out very tasty and I will definitely be making it again.  Very versatile recipe.  Thanks!

I'm rating this as a 5star because I followed suggestions from other users...  If you must use canned salmon, 2 6oz cans is plenty.  I also recommend fresh garlic as well.  I reduced the cheddar cheese to 2/3 of a cup and that was also plenty.  Fresh dill works best!  I have made this recipe several times and fresh salmon really does make a difference.  Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe. It's easy to make and it's very tasty. But next time I'll add more broth because it came out more like a casserole rather than a soup.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I'm not really a soup eater and this combination of creamed corn and evep. milk is awesome. Thanks so much for posting. Had the whole house smelling great as it cooked. I folled the recipe as stated with the exception of adding the dill weed. It was still great. Would definitely recommend.

Awsome Chowder!! I did change it a little bit, but only because of the ingrediants (or lack there of)that I had at the time. I added some canned crab meat that I had sitting in the cupboard so that I could used it up, and it worked well. I also had to use 1 cup of milk mixed with flour to thicken the soup, as I only had one can of condensed milk (doubled the recipe), which also worked well. Used fresh salmon.  Yummy!   Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe and get asked for the recipe often.  I used fresh salmon not canned and added 1/4 cap of liquid smoke.  The day after left overs were amazing.

Had some leftover salmon and used it for this soup.  I was not very exact with the measurements- just used leftover carrots, potatoes.  Didn't have any dill so left that out.  Thought the evaporated milk and creamed corn would be odd but I was wrong.  This was outstanding.  Just love it!  Put half in the freezer to eat later....hope it freezes ok!  Great soup!

Delicious, fast, easy, healthy and the ingredients always have place in my pantry/fridge. I make it with vegetable broth and thought that 2 cups wouldn't be enough but it is. I'm making it with left-over salmon tonight.

I'm giving it five stars because my DH  rated it.  I  really liked it also, except for one thing. I added one capful of Liquid Smoke and  I feel it made the  chowder taste kind of sweet. I wouldn't add that again. I like liquid smoke in some things but not this recipe. Taste it before adding the LS. I used two cloves of garlic and about 1 1/2 cans of salmon.  I'll use the rest  of the salmon in a tossed salad tomorrow.  You could use two cans but I thought, Heck, I can use it in a good salad for lunch tomorrow.  I thought the chowder  would be  thicker, but  the consistency was fine even with me using Fat Free condensed milk.  We got the Red Sockeye Salmon on sale for 3.00 a can, I think we will run and get a couple more cans. We can always use it.

Just what I was looking for!  Made this with some leftover salmon (haha) I baked last night.  Used fresh garlic and substituted celery salt for the fresh celery and salt.  I also used a mixture of heavy cream and milk and some frozen fresh corn from my garden.  Just a handful of cheese to finish it off and this is perfect.  Nice, light, and not too "fishy"!  Oh, and I loOove the carrots in it:)

THis was a great salmon chowder.  I added about 4 strips of bacon i had left over from the day before.  I used frozen salmon that was individually wrapped.  I used a 1lb of that and cut it up. I like the pieces chunkier than the stuff in the can.  I also added about 1Tbs of cornstarch since I didn't use the corn recommended.  My son prefers it without the corn. Excellent recipe.  I like this one much better than the simple chowder recipe on here. That one is not thick enough.

I have solved the cheddar cheese dilema, campbells makes a cheddar cheese soup, I added a can of that along with fresh uncooked salmon & a half cup of heavy cream toward the end.  Spiced it with lemon pepper & sea salt & this is definitely restaurant quality.

I love a pot of soup for dinner. It's quick, and made in one pot! There were several substitutions: olive oil for butter, minced garlic for powdered, and canned potatoes. I had a package of shredded carrots that I needed to use up. The creamed corn was "no salt added"... and the cheddar cheese was "fat free". The salt can be totally omitted - it does not need it.

This was good, but the next time I make it I'm going to cut the pepper at least by half.

I used fresh smoked salmon.  This combined with the chicken broth made the recipe waaaay too salty.  I would recommed anyone using this recipe for the first time to use 1/4 to 1/2 half teaspoon salt.  Also I added more potatoes (double)and half the dill weed.  I would also recommend less salmon.  After this harsh critique, the recipe is really easy, quick and tastes great.

I really did not like this recipe when made according to the recipe.  Way too salty, thick and buttery.

However, when I made it according to some of the reviewer recommendations it easily became a 5-star recipe.  Nice and light, and the dill is delicious.  Basically, I skipped the cheese, reduced the butter, and sprung for red sockeye canned salmon instead of pink.  I'm sure fresh grilled salmon would make this even better, but if I'm gonna pay for fresh salmon, I'm not going to put it in a soup!  Just my $0.02.

Ya know, I am a fish soup lover. I made this knowing, by the reading of the recipe, that it was going to be a smashing hit.  Now, my husband on the otherhand, basically says NO to fish AND soups! LOL. But I told him he'd like this, so he tried it.  He ate the whole thing and had seconds! Yah, it's a winner.

My husband went salmon fishing, so I went fishing for salmon recipes.  This was so good that we made it for ourselves one night, and made it again for friends the next night.  I added bacon and sprinkled cheese on top rather than mixing in.  I used half and half instead of evaporated milk in the second batch, but it was good both ways.  This is now my favorite salmon recipe and we will have it often.  In fact my husband went fishing again today, so guess what's for dinner... Yum!

Wonderful!!! Very good when first made but the salmon breaks down too much when it is heated too long...so eat it as soon as it's hot.  I am anxious to try this with shrimp.  Thanks for sharing...a definite keeper!  ALSO...some have mentioned the consistency of their cheese is wierd...BOILING CHEESE will make it have a hard, curd-like consistency.  Add the cheese and always melt it slowly.

Didn't change a thing.  Served with a small sprig of dill and some McCormick Smokehouse ground pepper on top.  Even the non-fish eaters gobbled it up.  Oh!  And this recipe is SO quick and easy!

Great recipe! Definitely use fresh salmon. To lower the fat I thickened with cornstarch, used skim evap milk, and garnished with a little cheddar cheese rather than putting so much in the actual soup. This still gave it that extra flavor!

This was fantatic!!  I added two cans of evaporated milk.  The only suggestion I can recommend is not to cook it too long after you add the milk.  It still is good but the milk curdles a little.

EXCELLENT!  The only changes I made were that I used fresh salmon and fresh garlic and left out the carrots.  I also substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the evap. milk.  My kids (7 and 5) LOVED this chowder.  I will definitely make it again..and again....

This chowder was so great and easy, I didn't have everything on the list so I used what I had and substituted a little bit as well.  I didn't have celery so I used red bell pepper for color.  I used two cans of 10oz boneless and skinless salmon, I also used 2 cans od 5 oz condensed milk and kept everything else the same.  IT WAS YUMMY!!!  Fiance Loved it!!! Thanks!

Thanks!  I did as others suggested and omitted the carrots and salt.  I used fresh salmon (baked first), dill and garlic and 1/3 of the cheese in the recipe.  I also blended ingredients for after they were simmered with the salmon, cream of corn and evaporated milk.  Then  returned them the stove and added the cheese.

Definitely a winner! The mixture of broth, potatoes, creamed corn and evaporated milk gave this chowder a wonderful consistency. I only tweaked the recipe a bit based on other users' reviews:  - I used fresh salmon, poaching it first in white wine, lemon and onions  - I used two cloves of minced fresh garlic  - I doubled the amount of dill to 2 teaspoons  - I added a tablespoon of liquid smoke just before serving  My guests raved about the results. This chowder will be in regular rotation at our house.

Substitute other fish along with Salmon and it is better.  Flounder or other more delicate fish along with salmon make less "fishy".

This was delicious but I had to throw out the whole pot. I strongly recommend using fresh salmon instead of canned salmon. There were tiny little bones in the chowder and we threw it out because the crunch ruined it for us. With fresh salmon, this would be wonderful. I doubled the dill, used fresh garlic, and left out the carrots.

I made mine without dill (my dad won't touch anything with it) and with celery seed (since I can't stand to see celery in my soup).  I used frozen corn since I didn't have any canned.  I also threw in a can of green beans and a bag of cauliflower. 
The soup had great taste but didn't look so well since my salmon fell apart.  Go figure.  
I made a double batch but used only one can of salmon since that was all I had.  Take note -- one 14 oz. can was plenty for a double batch of soup.  I can't imagine what it would have tasted like if I'd followed the recipe for that....probably would have made fishy dog food.

This is a great chowder for early fall. The changes I made were 1st using fresh coho salmon.  While raw I cut it in to bite size pieces and let it cook in the chowder. It cooked quickly and tasted great! I used fresh garlic and an ear of fresh corn instead of the creamed corn. I also did put any cheese in the chowder and so glad I didn't.

As is the soup was a little bland. I added red pepper flakes, more salt and pepper, and a couple dashes of Italian seasoning. I also used three 6 oz. cans of boneless skinless salmon. The two 16 oz. cans that's written in the recipe has to be a mistake because my 3 cans provided more than enough salmon. I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I used heavy cream.

This is a great soup if you are looking for something a bit different from your tomato based or vegetable soup.  I used premium red salmon and a lot less than called for in the recipe. Make sure your potatoes are cooked before proceeding with next steps or you may have to fish them all out and microwave them before returning to the soup like I did!  Kids  enjoyed it.  This is a tasty, hearty and healthy soup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will definately make again.

This recipe was excellent.  Our family used a bit of extra onion and carrots, and omitted the pepper and dill weed due to personal taste.  We made a few minor modifications to fit what we had on hand.  We used cooked salmon filets instead of canned salmon.  We marinated the salmon filets in lemon juice, then cooked them with a bit of butter in a skillet and deboned the salmon before adding it to the chowder.  We substituted regular 2% milk for the evaporated milk, and precooked frozen corn for the creamed corn.  We cut back the cheese to only 4 oz (1/4 lb) and added about 6 oz of chopped imitation crabmeat.  The kids loved it!

I made this chowder last night and loved it. The only changes I made was to add a small amount of flour to make a roux after I sauteed the onions, celery and fresh garlic. I added 3 cups of chicken broth and added the potatoes along with the seasoning and cooked it for 20 minutes. I omitted the carrots but added more corn. Then used non-fat evaporated milk. Perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

Picky kids liked this one too.  I did alter the recipe slightly. Instead of canned salmon, used 4 oz of smoked and about 8 oz of fresh cubed up and added once potatoes were cooked.  Simmered until opaque then added only 1 cup of cheese. Will make this again.

This recipe would have turned out good, but the milk curdled.  Once I added the milk and cheese I left it on the stove to warm through as the recipe suggests.  It got too hot and started to bubble, and then the milk curdled. I tried adding corn starch to thicken it back up, but it didn't seem to help much.  I did like other reviewers said and used fresh salmon, added broccoli and mushrooms, omitted the corn, and only added about a cup of cheddar cheese.  Based on how the soup tasted, even with the milk curdling, I will try to make this soup again.  Remember to keep the heat very low when you add the milk!!!!

This is a really yummy soup.  I was inspired to make this soup after having it at a dinner in Park City and this version was really close.  To make it healthier and a little more like the one I had in Park City, I omitted the cheese and increased the chicken broth to 2 cups.  I also used fresh salmon that I cut into cubes as well.  It tasted really close to what I had in Park City.  It's a keeper!  (Oh, I also didn't have dill so I substituted a pinch of dried basil and thyme and it was still good!)

Great recipe. I like my chowders hearty and chunky, so I chop things kind of big. I used purple, red, and white potatoes to add color, and I also added brocolli, white wine, and red pepper flakes. Easy and delicious. Thanks.

Fantastic meal. I can change it up with various veggies from the CSA (community supported agriculture). My hubby who doesn't ask for fish dishes asks for this.

Instead of using cheddar to thicken the soup, I followed MARNZ01 advice and used corn starch as a tickener. However, I did sprinkle some chaddar and bacon bits on top before serving. It looked nice and added a wonderful flavor.

Followed this recipe exactly.  I agree with a few others who mentioned that this would've been great even without the cheese.  It thickened up nicely before I even added cheese - the corn and potatoes have their own starches to make the chowder thick.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  We were looking for a good chowder to use with all of our fresh salmon.  We just grilled the salmon with some Adobo spices before adding to the chowder.  Very flavorful and even better the next day.  We made some a week ago and I am already craving more!  Definitely a keeper!

This soup is delicious! Even my kids love it. The only thing that I do differently isusing fresh salmon instead of canned, which is too full of bones for my liking.

Everyone in my house liked this, but I thought it was too fishy. I only used one can of salmon, and I did not like that I had to pick apart the salmon and debone it and basically clean it before I added it to the chowder. I will probably use this base recipe again, but not with canned salmon. I think the reason I didn't like this as much as  everyone else did was because I had to see and smell the canned salmon b4 I cleaned it, all I can say is BLECH!  Definately was fast and easy though, I'll give it that.

It was personally too fishy for me but maybe it was because I had not used fresh salmon or the smoked salmon. I used canned 14 ounce but I should've went for the 2 6 oz cans as someone else mentioned because it was too much salmon. I also should've bought boneless because there were little bone bits I couldn't remove.

Perhaps I will try again next time when the opportunity arrises.

Other than that, my boyfriend and his roommates completely loved it. We finished the whole pot in one night.

This was such a delicious chowder. I upped the celery significantly and used just one can of salmon and one can of diced clams. I didn't have any evaporated milk so I subbed milk and cream soup base powder for that. This all made a really tasty dinner that went great with the "To Die For French Bread Rolls" from this site. The cream corn really adds to this, so don't leave it out, and be sure to chop your veggies fairly coarsely. I also cut down the cheddar to only about a cup and it was plenty.

My husband and I love this soup.  Like many other reviewers, I highly recommend fresh salmon over canned and fresh garlic instead of powdered.  I also decrease the cheddar cheese by about half and I plan to try reduced fat evaporated milk next time.  My kids wouldn't eat this, but I don't think they even tried it.

Good recipe, I thought just dill as the main seasoning herb wouldn't make it flavorful, but it was perfect with the salmon. Not being a fan of too-cheesy chowders, I omitted the cheese and chose instead to just top the chowder with cheese. Made the soup thicker by shredding some of the carrots and potatoes. Also wanted more nutrients in there, so aside from using 400g of salmon, I added chopped prawns and squid (added this at the very last minute, cooked for only 70 seconds then turned heat off. that way squid is tender and not rubbery).

This is an outstanding chowder, but it is imperative you use fresh salmon. I made the mistake of using canned salmon, and I didn't feel the recipe was half as good with canned. So use fresh! Perhaps the best way I've made this is by grilling the salmon first using apple wood to lightly smoke it. It was the best that way, and it is the only time my kids raved about it (they like it non-grilled, but HATED it with canned, as did I). Overall, this recipe is excellent.  Just remember, fresh salmon is the key!

My family loved this recipe - having returned from a fishing trip, I made salmon broth (instead of chix broth) from a filleted carcass; there was enough meat on the carcass that I could pick off to substitute for the canned salmon (especially the cheek meat, yum!).  I also used fresh garlic like others, some fresh bay leaves, and threw in a can of chopped clams just for fun.  I used white shoepeg corn as well. Wonderful simple recipe, thanks for posting it.  Fabulous flavor.

Oh my! A very satisfying taste sensation! Only changes I made were using fresh salmon instead of canned and fresh garlic instead of powder. Made this for Ash Wednesday and it was very difficult for my family and myself to keep it to one serving only to maintain our fast!  Enjoyed the leftovers immensely...I do believe it was better on the 2nd day.  Only drawback was that, with fresh salmon, it was a rather expensive dish to make. I will keep my eye for salmon on sale and buy in bulk (freezing for future use). This is definitely a keeper and I will add this recipe to our Lenten meal list for meatless Fridays!  Thanks for submitting such a sumptuous soup recipe

This was REALLY good!  My husband said it reminded him of the seafood chowder served at "The Public House" in Boston.  As others suggested, I used fresh salmon that I baked for 20 minutes in foil.  I used red skin potatoes and added an extra can of chiken broth.  I used half the dill, because I'm not a huge fan of dill.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought the color was very pretty.  I served it with home style garlic and cheese croutons.  I'll definately make this again.

Soup is one of my favorite comfort foods and this is a good one.  I add chopped zucchini to get in more vegetables.  The dill gives this creamy soup such a nice flavor.  It's even better the next day.

I have made this chowder once a month for the last 3 months.  It is wonderful and my family loves it.  I,however, decreased the pepper in half.  The pepper was too strong for my families taste.

wow!  This chowder is perfect every time!  I used baked Alaskan King Salmon, instead of the canned, and flaked it using a fork.  I also used veggie broth as opposed to the chicken.  This recipe is quick to prepare and will impress any one having the privilidge to eat it!

Tasty, though I only used 14 oz. of salmon total. Instead of evaporated milk, I used 1.5 cups of my skim lactose free milk and 1/3 cup of margarine, and it worked out great! (Cuts the fat significantly too!) Kept everything else the same.

Absolutely delicious and EASY! (Two things I look for in a recipe!) I also used salmon fillets, instead of canned. Just sauted the cubed salmon in a bit of butter and then started the recipe at Step 1. I used veg. broth instead of chicken broth. Served it up with some sourdough. Tried to eat in front of the T.V., but it was hard to hear over all the "mmmmmm's" and "wow's". Passed the recipe on to my parents and my friends.

I served this recipe to my friends (we all live on the coast) and they loved it! It was fun to serve and see if they could tell it was canned salmon, and not fresh.  Next time I make it ... I'll try using fresh salmon, and garlic just to see if it could possibly any better.

Very excellent soup!  Used fresh salmon (3 single-sized frozen portions), baked & flaked.  Tasted so good, I couldn't imagine using anything else. Omitted the cheese, just sprinkled some on top.  Came out perfect. Fed exactly 5 adults, and everyone loved it- fish haters included.

This is delicious!  I don't add celery, carrots, or dill weed just because I'm not fond of those and it tastes great. The best homemade soup!

This dinner was so fabulous that even my kids ate every drop!  I actually made it in the crock pot, though, instead of on the stove.  I put all the first ingredients in at around 8:30 am and then around 4:30 pm I put in the final ingredients (evaporated milk, cheese, corn, salmon).  By 5:30 we had a very delicious meal with plenty leftover for another meal (there are 2 adults, a 5 and 8 year old in our family who ate their fill).  I will definitely make this again!!

This is a a great recipe.  I added all of the ingredients as noted except for the cheddar.  I felt it was already chock full of good things and it tasted delicious without the extra calories.  My customers loved it.  S. Martin

I boiled a salmon head and used the stock to make the chowder. Otherwise I used the recipe as is. Delicious to the nth degree.

I cut down the butter to 1 Tbsp, and I omitted the salt since everything else in the cans contains plenty of salt.  Also, since I don't like garlic or onions, I used just a dash of garlic powder and a dash of onion powder instead of what the recipe called for.  It tasted great!  I also used just a small sprinkle of grated cheese, but it could be omitted.

I made a number of changes based on other reviews and my family's food issues. I used oil instead of butter, soy milk instead of evaporated milk, and left out the cheese entirely to make it non-dairy. I used malanga instead of potato to avoid nightshades.  I used one 14.75oz can of salmon, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and left out the carrots.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  The resulting chowder was very tasty! Even my husband asked for seconds, and he rarely likes soups and stews. It was a little peppery, so next time I may reduce the black pepper by half.

Yummy if you like fish chowders.  I was making it in my crockpot and didn't have room for two cans of salmon as the recipe called for.  I also cut salt in half and the cheese to 1 cup using a blend that was labeled "smooth melt."  Worked great and my husband said he didn't think it needed more salmon.

As others mentioned,  not sure if the cheese is necessary. It tasted pretty good without. Maybe just 4 oz. next time or not at all? I used three 10-oz. fillets of slightly defrosted fresh salmon that I placed right in the pot. No need to cook in advance. Peeled the skin off at the end.

Fresh salmon, garlic, dill and a splash of white wine made this chowder come alive.   A little bit of heat with a dash of chipotle powder was nice too!  Skipped the cheese and milk, not because I don’t like them, but because the chowder was complete without!

Followed the variant written by MommyFromSeattle.  It was a hit.  I would keep the added smoke and cheddar cheese to the low side of what is recommended there.  Also used shredded carrots to avoid chunkiness and reduced fat components to keep calories down.  Will definitely make it again. .

I loved it.  I made it  for work when we had a pot luck soup & grilled cheese day.  We fish a lot and had a ton of smoked salmon so I used that instead of the canned salmon and I added bacon.  I also like my chowder thick so I thickened it with some corn starch and flour to my preferred thickness.  The flavor was fabulous and the entire crock pot was empty before I knew it.

We loved this soup in Sweden so much that I wanted to make it when I got home!  The soup we had there definitely didn’t have any corn or Cheddar Cheese in it!  1 tsp of pepper is too much and the entire can of evaporated milk is too much(20 calories per Tablespoon). I doubled the broth and used a 1/2lb  of fresh salmon placed in the soup raw and in chunks. Going to try someone’s review that said use fat free evaporated milk next time.

I kicked it up with red pepper flakes, minced garlic and smoked paprika. Next time I’m going to cut back on the sugar in the condensed milk.  It was a little too sweet for me.

So yummy! I took other reviewers’ advice and used fresh garlic and salmon that my husband and son pulled out of the Pacific Ocean. I baked the salmon filet for 10 minutes so that the bones would come out more easily. I also reduced the cheese to about 2 cups. I loved the touch of dill and sweetness of the creamed corn in this.

I did not put in the cheese... I added cheese to my bowl as per serving. 
I will definately make it again. 
Need to know if it can be frozen in individual servings, I live alone and made a double batch due to gain so much salmon to use (overcooked a 3 pound salmon roast the night before). So happy I came across this recipe to salvage the salmon.

This recipe turned out great!  I made a few changes. I used 2 1/2 cups of broth, cup of onion, used 3/4 can of evaporated milk, used 1/2 cup shredded Swiss and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, only used 1/2 tsp of salt, fresh dill and 4 carrots instead of 2. I also used two frozen salmon fillets instead of canned salmon and a cup of frozen corn instead of creamed corn. I’m definitely making this  again!!

Excellent chowder even though I didn’t have everything listed.  I used the corn off 3 cobs I had, cooked in a white sauce made with butter, flour and milk.  Also used fresh salmon which I cooked in the sauce with the corn, then added this to the vegetables and broth.  Really enjoyed it.

Loved this recipe!  I used leftover baked salmon from a few nights ago and substituted 4 garlic cloves for powdered garlic but otherwise followed original recipe.  Served with corn bread and was absolutely delicious.  Will make again!

Would definitely make again.  I used to think all the alterations were a weird thing but I’ve learned that sometimes you must adapt.  The ‘bones’ of this recipe is great, yes 2 pounds of salmon is probably a typo.  I sauted some fresh salmon chunks, removed from pan cooked veggies as described.  I didn’t have evaporated milks so used a can of condensed celery soup and some 1% milk.  Didn’t have corn but added crab meat.  Went easy on potatoes and cheese (used about 1/4 cup asiago shredded).  And oh my stars, this was delisious!

This was excellent!!  The only changes I made was using half and half instead of evaporated milk because I didn't have any, and frozen corn instead of canned corn for same reason.  Next time I will make it as written.

I used the broth from the carrots, potatoes as a substitute for chicken broth. I added VODKA for reduction purposes. I sued a frozen seared corn and a canned Canadian smoked salmon. The smokey essence is memorable, earthy and savory. I substituted sage for dill. Sage is more "American" than dill. I also substituted diced Mexican "queso crema" (a hard white drier cheese) for the cheddar cheese. OUT OF THIS WORLD! Thank you!

Very good. Simple to make. I cooked fresh salmon instead of canned. Didn't have cheddar so I used about 4oz Monterey instead. I'll make this again.

Very tasty, but the evaporated milk became grainy.  I thought there was something wrong with the milk so I made it again.  The same thing happened.

Wow, this chowder is excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out superb. When I make it the next time I will use a fresh salmon fillet and add bacon. I found the canned salmon had too many bones for my liking. My Wife and I ate half of the pot of chowder the first night. I added 8 oz. of cooked bacon to the last half of the chowder and it made a huge difference. I really like this Salmon chowder....

This was very good. I used the liquid smoke as one reviewer suggested and I think that gave it a good flavor. I used two tuna steaks that I wanted to use up, so didn’t use canned tuna. Will definitely make again. Thanks!!

I didn't have evaporated milk so substituted cream of mushroom soup. This worked.

I used the full teaspoon of pepper but will probably cut back to just over a 1/2 tsp as it was spicy hot.

I made it for the most part the way it stated, but geared it to lower sodium, left out tsp salt, and used low sodium chicken broth.  * (used 1 tsp of cornstarch and two TBSP of instant mashed potato flakes also, towards the very end)* Kept a little shredded cheese in a separate bowl, as a garnish on top,  with a sprinkle of dried parsley.  (The can of creamed corn I used made the texture and flavor balance great as well as having a little sodium in that ingredient). I liked this recipe and will make it again!

It ended up tasting like salmon flavored soup. It called for probably twice as much salmon as needed, and could have used maybe 2-3x as much potato. If I used fresh salmon, I imagine it would have been better and would have chunks of actual fish instead of basically tiny bits of crumbled salmon. I was expecting this to be a salmon version of Crabmeat and Corn Soup, which was delicious, this was not. Also - canned salmon is disgusting looking, nothing like canned tuna, more like those whole chickens in a can.

Of all the recipes I have made from this site, this one stands out the most in that it really tastes like it came from a fine restaurant.   I followed other's advice and left out the cheese and used fresh salmon.  I would give it six stars if I could!

Love this soup, very tasty. I had salmon sitting in my freezer and i was scared it might have been freezer burnt. But i feel like if it was all the flavor in the recipe would mask it.

This was the best salmon chowder.  I used 2 fresh salmon filets that I skinned and chopped after I thawed them.  I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of evaporated milk.  I added the salmon before I added the 1/2 & 1/2 , corn and cheese, and it didn't take long at all to cook.  I should make this all the time.  And luckily the salmon wasn't fishy like it can be sometimes.  I also doubled the dill.

Terrific recipe. Very easy to substitute for ingredients I already had: 
-Frozen corn instead of creamed 
-Raw salmon chunks (cut them to the size you want before adding to the pot)
-A splash of liquid smoke
-Cheese amount seemed fine to me
-Leftovers were tasty!

Excellent!  A thick (but not too thick) chowder.  The recipe made enough for two meals for my husband and me. It froze well for the second meal. My husband is not crazy about salmon, but raved about this recipe.  Served it with a tossed green salad - a perfect meal!

No chicken broth on hand so used vegetable broth, plus fresh garlic & .85 lb fresh salmon. 
Great for cold rainy weather. Taste was quite mild and good. Fairly quick once you’ve got all the veggies chopped.

We doubled the recipe but only had one box of chicken, so we used a box of beef broth and added raw shrimp. It was awesome.

Very good recipe with lots of room for personal touches such as spices or additional seafood. I added a handful of cheese instead of a half pound to cut calories and fat.

My husband loved it even though he's a picky eater. Leftovers though turned out a bit greasy. Next time I may use light cheese or use even less quantity. I only used half the quantity this time. Also used pre-roasted Mexican corn from the freezer section (only corn I had on hand). Also used whole milk instead of cream.
But, this one's definitely a keeper! :)

GREAT as is!, only minor alterations to feel in charge and creative ... I doubled the stock and added some water, halfed the milk (next time will try to put in fat free), put 2 teaspoons corn starch on the onions at the end and fried for a minute longer, halfed the dill (not a fan), added some red pepper flakes, a lot  more garlic, at the end thickened with mixture of one small tablespoon corn starch with 2T water and boiled one minute.

I make this soup a lot. My family loves it. I follow the directions and ingredients...with the only exception being that even if I don’t have celery in the house, I still make the soup and just add extra carrots. And instead of canned salmon, I usually use leftover baked salmon.

I had never had fish chowder before -- it didn't sound appealing. But I decided to make this because we had several cans of salmon. I loved it. Just served it to some of my ski buddies, and they loved it also. They want me to give the recipe to their wives!

this is delicious.  I used fresh wild salmon cut into big pieces, and fish broth in lieu of chicken.  I did omit the cheese, as I didn't feel the need. I only had 3/4 of a baked potato left so I added that at the end.  thanks for the tip regarding deglazing the pan with a bit of white wine.  I did eyeball the ingredients but kept the liquid portion as written.  I think using the creamed corn helps to keep it a bit thicker.  I don't care for the taste of evaporated milk so used fat free half & half instead.  at the end, I did add a bit of zested lemon rind to the pot; this really brightened it up nicely.  Wonderful flavor and a synch to prepare.  thanks so much for this recipe.  Could easily substitute any other fish for the salmon.

Tasty soup, I also used fresh salmon, and heavy cream, I didn't have dill so I went with cumin and red peppers. It is not a very thick chowder, it is more of a traditional soup.

I have made this a number of times! My family loves it!  The changes i made were i use fresh salmon,  fresh garlic and regular frozen corn. I also use heavy cream instead of evaporated milk and i also add a capfull of liquid smoke. Half the time I also forget to add the dill.  It's fine without it. And if it's not thick enough,  I add instant potatoes to thicken.   My cousin shared this recipe with me. I don't really like a lot of fish but this was so delicious!   That's why i keep making it!

I really enjoyed this soup, but I did omit the cheddar as several reviewers recommended, and I used full-fat coconut milk instead of evaporated milk. I will definitely make this again, both with salmon, and with other types of fish.

Great base recipe! I used frozen Alaskan salmon and cooked it directly in the soup, used green bell pepper instead of celery, added frozen corn, halved the amount of cheese and added red pepper flakes.

I made this last night and followed the recipe, the only difference was that I used fresh salmon (didn't bake it, raw) and added 1tsp of cayenne. My husband and I loved it. It was so good it's gonna be a go to from now on. I think I would try to bake it from now on and add frozen peas and carrots to make it heartier. This is such a great dish and I highly recommend making it. I'm looking forward to making it again soon! So delicious!

Substituted real garlic for garlic powder, skim evaporated milk for evaporated milk, celery seed for celery, frozen corn for creamed corn, chicken jelly stock and water for chicken broth . Used a smaller single can of salmon. Left out carrots and cheese.  All I can say is there were no leftovers.

For as much as I'm not real big on salmon, I did like this chowder! I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible, since it's kind of annoying when people make substantial alterations and THEN rate the recipe. I made very few alterations, mostly because I didn't have everything on hand. Here's what I did differently: I used minced garlic instead of powder, I used fresh dill weed since I had some in my garden, I used 1 14oz can of salmon, I used whole milk instead of evaporated, and I used about 1/2 the amount of cheese asked for...just cause it seemed like plenty. Overall, the chowder is very tasty and I would make it again with the same changes. Thanks for the recipe...I have TONS of canned salmon and this is a great way to start using it up!

I wanted to make this so badly but I didn't have many of the ingredients.  I used 4 small canned tuna in water instead of salmon.  I replaced the diced potatoes with 2 cups frozen O'Brian potatoes with onions and bell peppers.  I replaced the onions and celery  with 1 cup frozen seasoning mix with onions, celery and green bell peppers.  I didn't have the creamed corn so I put half cup corn in blender with cream and butter (I know that's not how you make cream corn!).  I paper-thin sliced 6 baby carrots and I replaced the cheese with all the partial cheese bags I had that totaled about 1lb (fiesta blend, sharp cheddar and Colby-Jack).  I had the other ingredients which didn't really leave much from the original recipe.  We loved this!!!  I care for my Mom who suffers from Alzheimer's and is in Hospice.  It is hard to get her to drink enough so I improvise by giving her melons, soups and anything that would give her additional fluids.  She loved this!  She ate the cup and a half I fed her plus she ate everything in my bowl as well.  This is wonderful!!!  I only gave this a 4 as I replaced most of the ingredients.

I just loved this recipe. I made it with Red Snapper instead of salmon, and used Costco's Mexican Blend Cheese (Monterey Jack, Medium Cheddar, Quesadilla, and Asadero), and it wasn't too cheesy at all... I could hardly tell that there was cheese in it. Very thick & rich, maybe because I used a full 32 oz of cooked fish.

Loved this soup, but since we have some in our family who cannot have dairy or poultry, I substituted canned coconut milk and added 1 extra cup of water and 3 vegetable bouillon cubes.  Also used red onion diced (since it was all I had available).  Cheddar cheese was available as a topping for those who can have dairy.  Topped each bowl with a large basil leaf fresh picked from the garden! Served soup with biscuits and a spinach salad.

Made some changes: Used Fish Stock instead of Chicken Broth and used Norweigan Cold Smoked Salmon 12oz. and Hot Smoked Alaskan Wild Caught Salmon 4oz. instead of canned salmon. Also, just used grated Cheddar for garnish with some fresh parsley. Definitely will make this again!  It was a big hit in my house for dinner!

This is overall the best salmon chowder I have tasted. Evaporated milk instead of heavy cream offers as much rich flavors but is healthier so you can have more!

Amazing chowder! My family couldn't stay away from it. I substituted extra old cheddar for a bt if zing. The only thing I might add next time is shrimp.

This is really Good! I used 4 frozen salmon fillets cut into pieces and added it in with the chicken stock. I didn't have celery so added 1/2 tsp. celery seed. I also just added in the creamed corn with everything else- and only added 2 diced potatoes and some leftover mashed potatoes. really good! Also used whole milk instead of evaporated milk. Yum! I will make this again!

I think this is a fantastic recipe, especially considering it calls for canned salmon. I have used this as a Sunday meal prep and eat it throughout the week.

Loved it! But like everyone else, I did alter it (mostly in respect to portions). I did a whole onion, 7 red potatoes, 3-4 carrots, 4 celery stalks, 3 cups of broth, 2 pounds of fresh (uncooked) salmon, 5 tbsp of butter, left the creamed corn and evaporated milk the same. Added extra dill. I did put the salmon in before simmering so that it would cook during that time. And I didn't put the cheese in at all. I also had to thicken it a bit. But...so delicious!!! If anything, it is a great guideline.

REALLY happy with the layers of flavor. Changes were: fresh salmon (we caught it!), garlic, peas, corn and fresh red peppers.

It wasn't too cheesy for us and the flavor was mild yet flavorful. My partner who does not like any type of  seafood loved it!

This is delicious! After reading other reviews, I cut down on the cheese, but I give this one five stars for sure. I've also tried this using hominy instead of the corn and it adds a nice meaty texture to it.  My 4 year old loves it!

I used an immersion blender to blend it up a bit before adding in the salmon. This gave it a nicer consistency. Served with ciabatta bread and salmon cakes. Loved it!

My husband scoffed at the canned salmon, but I told him I was following the recipe.  He said, " I am sure that will not be fit to eat."  Well, I cooked it to the letter, and we both liked it.  It was very delicious as is.  Now, with that said, I would use fresh cooked salmon next time  around.  I would simple bake it in the oven for a bit before chopping and tossing it in.  I believe smoked salmon would really send this recipe off the charts as we  used cheddar cheese which was smoked, and it gave it a nice flavor.  This recipe is super easy and fast, but I can't wait to play around with it on a later date.

Everyone in our family hates salmon but even the kids liked this.  I made it as written except I used fresh salmon (chopped into small pieces) and less cheese.  A great way to get salmon into our diet!

I think I doubled the recipe and fed 5 people with no leftovers  :(   it was so tasty! I also add more dill by 3 tablespoons or more and 2 teaspoons of fresh parsley to the butter saute. I only added about a cup of mild cheddar and it didn't over power the flavor! We loved this chowder and will be making it again and again! Thank you!

Needed to use up some baked salmon, this worked great.  I didn't have evaporated milk and hubby is lactose intolerant, so I used cream of celery soup.  Cream of Potato or Chicken would work just as well.  I used shredded carrots so that I wouldn't have to chop up whole ones, worked great, too.  Omitted cheese and creamed corn (or any corn) because hubby is not a fan.  Salmon flavor came through and it was a hit.  Will make again!

I substituted smoked salmon that I make in the summer, and used half and half instead of condensed milk.  I also substituted for the creamed corn, using roasted corn on the cob that I cut the kernels from.  I just can't make chowder without bacon, so I diced four slices of applewood smoked bacon and sauteed this prior to adding butter, onions, garlic and celery. Following another reviewer's comment, I put a fraction of the cheese in that the recipe calls for.  These modifications  made for fewer canned items and resulted in great texture and flavor.

I halved the amount of cheese and took two cups out (after cooking it for 20 min) and I blended it all up in a blender to make everything thick smooth.

Instead of cheese I prefer a TBS of marsala wine.  One can also substitute any white fish.  I am in NZ and I use Moki.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except for using 1 cup regular milk instead of canned milk,  and used one cup of cheese. Served it with a few drops of hot sauce. My family loved it. Very hearty.

Instead of evaporated milk, I added 2 cans of Cream of Potato soup to thicken.  Was very good.

I grew up in Seattle and chowder is in my blood. I love it. I like this recipe and recognize that it's intended for quick-and-easy prep, but I'm a die-hard fresh food cook, so here's what I did:

--Bought a small, fresh, whole salmon at the market, had them filet it and wrap up the trim for me as well
--Used the trim to make a broth (to replace the chicken broth; nothing fancy -- I just simmered it for 1 1/2 hours or so) 
--Used fresh garlic 
--Omitted the carrots and cheese (superfluous to chowder, IMO, although you can put out fresh grated Parmesan to sprinkle on the top)
--Added chunks of the raw salmon and let it simmer
--Used fresh whole milk, with a splash of cream or 1/2 & 1/2 for richness

I liked the suggestion MARNZ01 had to deglaze the sauteed ingredients with white wine -- I'll try that next time.

Cheers,
Dan O

I halved the recipe and I just put in two cups of milk instead of the water and evaporated milk. I took out the bones in the canned salmon and added most of the liquid. I was out of celery so added some celery seeds. 
This is surprisingly good. And easily made from items in the pantry.

Made this for my husband and 2 boys.. as I don't eat fish. They loved it! I was shocked, because my boys are picky (9 and 13). I did not add the dill and I added some light cream and cornstarch to thicken. Also used fresh salmon instead of canned. I will definitely be making it again! Thank you!

Listen.... I don't eat salmon all the time but when I do.....I will make sure that I make this soup!!!! I'm really picky about soup in general because up until now, the only soup that I will eat is broccoli & cheddar soup..... but THIS RIGHT HERE.... I will be making this all the time! I skipped the dill because I'm allergic to a lot of different herbs/spices (thanks to the ragweed allergy) but this recipe still ROCKED!!! I had my 13 year old turning this up! Thank you for the recipe!

I made a few changes because I didn't have all items on hand. I used wild atlantic salmon fillets and cooked them prior to adding in the chowder. I also used fat free half and half instead of evaporated milk, and I added a tsp of crushed red pepper for some spice. When it was finished I added an extra pinch of S&P.  It was delicious! The only thing I'd do differently next time is use regulat corn instead of creamed to cut down on the sweetness.

I made recipe accordingly with only 3 exceptions. I sauteed about 5 slices of bacon cut into small pieces with the onions. And I only used a pint jar of canned salmon so roughly 16 oz and that was plenty of salmon. I also didnt add the cheese to the mixture but instead just topped each bowl with cheese. Served with sour cream as an additional topping and a side  of garlic bread. My husband and 2 year old loved it. Will be making again!

I had to substitute with gluten and lactose free ingredients. I used lactose free marble cheese and lactose free milk.  I also used coho salmon - not canned.  Loved this recipe.  Will make again!   Oh and again and probably again.  :)

Turned out great. Did what a few recommended. Only a half cup of cheese and used fresh salmon cut in to chunks. Added a bit of smoke at the end. Delicious.

WOW!  I am a frequent user of Allrecipes.com and I have a criteria that I follow when choosing recipes to make for my family.  The recipe I choose has to have at least 200 reviews and 4.5 or more stars.  This recipe did not let me down!  I am cleaning out my pantry and it is 95 degrees outside today with a 110 heat index today and I still made this recipe.  I can't keep my spoon out of the pot!  The chowder is creamy, seasoned perfectly and NOT fishy at all.  Thank you for sharing.  I will be keeping this one for the winter months!

Wow! This has become my husbands favorite soup! I used liquid smoke as others suggested and I just dropped in raw salmon. I always up the veggies in my soups to make them stretch. This is yummy and I will be making again and again!

Using some changes recommended by others, I have made this at least a half of a dozen times.  Thank you for sharing.  Some of the changes I have read seems so far removed from your recipe it is a wonder they don't submit their own.  Thanks again for your submission, I am heading to the store to make it again tonight, it freezes very well.  I use fresh salmon and 1% milk, no cheese, no salt and low sodium ingredients.

I did everything it said, I thought the recipe read 2 cups of cheese not a 1/2 lb. I still love it. I also completed one of my cups of broth with 1/4 cup dry white wine. Amazing!!

This recipe was outstanding. My husband has insisted that this be added to my recipes in frequent rotation. He said it was one of the best soups he's ever eaten, and he also called it "perfect hangover food"! I omitted the celery because I had none on hand, used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese because I ran out of cheddar, and adderd tarragon as per another reviewer's suggestion. It is wonderful with crushed red pepper flakes added in as well.

Made this with leftover salmon, used fresh garlic and added liquid smoke .   Omitted the cheese (added a little corn starch to thicken before serving).  Delicious!

I really liked the consistency of the soup. It's not too thin, not too thick. And the spices are perfect for the salmon. I think next time I make it I will use fresh salmon, this time I used salmon from a packet. I'll definitely. Be making this one again!

This recipe is fabulous! I used 3 fresh salmon filets, no pre-cooking, I just chunked it up and put it in raw. It cooked up perfectly. I used low fat evaporated milk and I actually used 8oz of Daiya non-dairy cheddar cheese! Didn't realize until I was home, but it was perfect. Not too cheesy at all.  Only half a can of corn. Oh yes, the best thing is that I added a little of MY wine! I saw several reviewers mention the white whine. I make whites and meads...  I used maybe an 1/8th cup of mead.  Really perfect.  So I made a lot of little changes, but followed the basic recipe pretty closely. It was wonderful! My man is taking it to work for lunch tomorrow. I will definitely make it again.

Definitely will be making this again. I used fresh garlic, fresh salmon filet (broiled in the oven the day before with olive oil, sea salt n garlic). Also omited the carrots as others suggested and no corn. I used two 14 oz cans of broth, used sea salt and a couple dashes of creole seasoning, added extra celery,and stirred in a capful of liquid smoke at the end. It was so good. I served with sourdough bread and sprinkled red pepper flakes in my bowl for an extra kick. I was full after one bowl so had to use willpower not to back for more. YUM

Awesome recipe!  Made it for a Packer game and was loved by all!   I made a triple batch but cut way back on the cheese  because my husband and daughter are lactose sensitive.  Used pepper jack to add a little heat and a little cheddar.  I had uncooked frozen salmon that I added and fresh corn that I cut off the cob.  Will be making this often!

Yes it turn out so good! I add some of my touches, like bacon, baby sea scallops and potatoes. And made a box of Red Lobster Ceddar Bay Biscuit mix to go with the chowder. Delicious!

This was totally delicious. Adapted it based on wanting to use ingredients we already had. Used crab stock, fresh garlic and dill instead of dried, used only 1/2 cup cheddar cheese (that's all we had), used smoked salmon instead of fresh, blended two ears of fresh corn, and substituted a half can of coconut milk for the evaporated milk. Yum!

I took the advice of some reviewers and used fresh salmon and fresh garlic.  I had some leftover grilled salmon, that was a little dry that I just couldn't throw away.  My family also likes things a little on the spicy side, so I followed the recipe as written and used 1 habanero pepper during the saute process,  and it provided just the right kick.  I also substituted half-n-half for the evaporated milk; hoping to cut out some calories and sweetness from the milk.  Lastely, I held the cheddar cheese, only because I didn't have any, it this still turned out AMAZING!

This was so good! We are spending the summer as camp hosts in an RV park in Kenai, AK. Salmon is plentiful. I made this chowder tonight and had our new friends over. Really was a hit. Some crusty French bread, good conversation, and some good Alaskan beer made this meal centerpiece a memorable event. I did change up the recipe a bit. Cut the cheese in half, used 2 cups of fresh baked salmon, added 1/3 cup clam juice  and 1/2 cup half & half. Wow!

Perfectly delicious and well-balanced flavor!  I subbed fresh thyme for the dill weed, almond milk for the evaporated milk, added some bay leaves in the cooking process, and blended about 2/3 of the boiled vegetables before adding the fish and milk.  Don't overthink this recipe; it's best simple.

I used canned salmon and my husband and I both thought it was good.  I only used one can, picked out the skin and large bones, and added half the liquid mixed with cornstarch to thicken the chowder.  I needed cornstarch because I didn't use cheese.  I'm sure it would be good but we just can't eat much cheese.  I also didn't use any salt and added a bay leaf.  Obviously this would be better with fresh instead of canned fish, but canned is more affordable and easy to keep on hand.

Excellent chowder.  Used fresh salmon that I poached in the microwave first (easy way to do fish) and used minced garlic instead of powder.  Will definitely try again and will try adding some sun-dried tomatoes next time as suggested for colour.  

12/15/2015 Made this again but this time I used leeks instead of onions, added fresh salmon to the pot with the broth and added sun dried tomatoes.  I also used 2% evaporated milk.  I also cut back on the cheese.  Excellent again!  My husband loves it.

So delicious and easy! I followed the recipe exactly, including using two large cans of salmon. My suggestion is to empty the cans of salmon in a bowl and pick out the large spine bones. The small bones cook nicely so that you don't notice them and provide extra protein. I won't be making this frequently, because it's not exactly healthy, but I will make it occasionally when we're craving some comfort food.

Really good!  Shortened the process by starting with Cream of Potato soup.

Very easy to make & a hearty supper on a cold night. I used non-fat canned milk & left out the cheese to cut fat content. I used left over grilled salmon filets so the protein contentvwas high. My husband actually told me he would eat this as often as I wanted to make it.

Had to make a few changes - used fresh salmon and fresh garlic... added some shrimp & minced clam and used lactose-free milk instead of evaporated since I can't have anything with lactose, and I'm pretty sure I didn't' use anything close to 1/2 a pound of cheese... but otherwise kept the recipe as is.  Very happy with the taste - will certainly make this one again!

I used 10 oz. of fresh salmon instead of canned, can of plain corn not creamed, and reduced the pepper to about 1/4 t. Delicious!

Super yummy! Used 1 14 oz can  red salmon and 2% canned milk--family loved it!  Was easy and tasted like it came from a fine restaurant. Even better a day or two later.

Amazing soup. We went ahead and made a double recipe using fresh garlic and two thawed pkgs of frozen salmon from Aldi ripped into shreds right into the pot. They sell it for about $4 a lb there, not so expensive. We omitted the carrots but added frozen roasted corn at the end from Trader Joes and it was one of the best soups we have made. The corn gave it a nice texture. The leftovers freeze very well.

Our new favorite, but, of course, with our own twists.  We used fresh salmon---the only way to go, and fresh corn from our garden.  It's nice to add a touch of cayenne as well.  Super!

Delish!!!! My new favorite soup. (Admittedly I modified it to what was in the fridge.  Left out the cheddar cheese and used 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup heavy cream, and 2 tablespoons more of butter and a regular can of corn instead of the creamed corn. I also used fresh Chum salmon since they are so plentiful this year. Turned out AMAZING!)

I followed this to a t.  Needs more corn, more seasoning to taste but absolutely delish either way.  This is just my preference. I served 4 people they all loved it.  I will make this again.  I will get the salmon that already comes deboned and skinned.  Pickng the bones out was a pain.

This was superb. I used celery salt instead of celery, doubled the potatoes and halved the salmon (used smoked). Also used regular corn (not creamed) and only a handful of cheese, just enough until it got creamy. Disappeared in no time!

This was yummy! I made a few tweaks of my own: fresh garlic, used about 1 cup of parmesan cheese instead of cheddar cheese, instead of canned salmon used fresh/frozen salmon, used half the amount of creamed corn, added 1 cup of fresh/regular corn and thickened with corn starch. Mmm!

This is a great super easy chowder that tastes great. Perfect way to use up leftover baked salmon! Used fat free evaporated milk and skipped the cheese to make it a bit healthier.

I followed this recipe exactly (no changes or swaps).  When it was done, all I could taste was canned salmon.  Not just salmon -- but CANNED salmon (and I used a brand name -- Chicken of the Sea).  I made it for some friends and I was SO embarrased.

Lovely favor.  I made the following small changes:  sweet potato for potato,  no corn,  and light coconut milk (Thai) for milk,  More specifically for the ingredients used:   Unsalted butter, white sweet onion,  mixed pepper corns, a coarse mediterranean sea salt and I have used both a  previously cooked Copper River Coco baked in dill and a smoked Coco salmon on another occasion.  Served with a crusty French bread and a green salad it makes a wonderful meal.

Fantastic!  This recipe is nearly flawless and I make it often.

Always use fresh salmon.  I prefer a bit less dill.  The carrots don't offend me as much as some others, but I love carrots.

Pretty good recipe, I used fresh salmon over canned salmon by adding it  alongside the onions. The end product was very good, but next time I would use less cheese. The end product was so rich and heavy that it was hard to eat very much. Also next time I would cut potatos much finer.

This is my favorite salmon chowder so far; I've been searching for a really great recipe and a lot of them are too "fishy."  I used 3 fresh salmon fillets (about 4 oz each) instead of canned but otherwise followed the directions.  The soup was wonderful. My whole family (including 3 kids) loved it and normally they don't like fish or soup for dinner.

Great recipe! I made some modifications based on what I had on hand/the advice of others - used about 1 cup chicken broth + about 1.5-2 cups 2% milk (we're lactose intolerant and so this worked well for us). Added in 1 cup carrots with the celery and potatoes, and used real garlic and frozen corn kernels. Very tasty - will make again!

I do not like fish, but I really liked this recipe.  I did tweek it a bit.  I used fresh salmon (1 lb), fresh dill (1 tbl), fresh garlic, 1 can sweet corn (not creamed), did not add cheddar cheese, and added 1 jalepeno for a little kick. I also added a little more broth to, everyone seemed to love the soup :0)

follow other suggestions for making this your own. Definitely liked ours chunkier by adding more potato flakes.

Wow, this is really yum-yum! Only thing I changed was to all Old Bay seasoning instead of dill, fresh garlic instead of powder and added a can of whole corn.

This was great.  I love salmon, & I love, love, LOVE chowder & soup in general, but was never sure about whether I would like salmon chowder!  I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used regular milk, I'm NOT a fan of dill weed, so I only used a tiny bit.  I agreed with other reviewers...less cheddar was better!  I didn't have any liquid smoke, but wish I had added that, as another reviewer had suggested.

LOVED IT!!!! Made this recipe for a couple of my friends and they really enjoyed it.  I made a couple of changes though.  I removed dill from the recipe all together.  I sliced the carrots really thin..  My friends don't eat chicken and so I did not want to use chicken broth, therefore I substituted the real celery for cream of celebry soup.  I doubled the cook time before I added the Salmon and milk.  I did not include the cheese in the pot but rather set it aside and placed it on top of the soup for those who wanted it.

Wow, what a soup! Used frozen salmon filets that I cut into pieces and sauteed in butter. Decreased the butter to one tablespoonful and added some cooked bacon for flavor. Did not have cheddar cheese, did not really need it. Used fresh garlic and cooked it with the onions and celery.

This recipe is a keeper!  My 13 y/o daughter helped me make it and she loved it!  By reading the other reviews, I used less carrots, leftover grilled salmon from night before (instead of canned salmon) and about 3/4 cup of cheese.  It turned out delish!!  Thanks for this recipe!

Wonderful comfort food, but I would go easy on the dill. The first time it tasted too pickly. My whole family loved it including my 10 year old son. I didn't like the bottom of the pot. A lot of the crunchy little fish bones tend to settle at the bottom of the pot.

GREAT recipe, I make this practically every week.  To make it easier and cheaper I cut out the cheddar and replaced the evaporated milk with about 1/4 cup milk.  I usually use celery seed instead of fresh celery, and when I have more time on hand I use fresh chopped garlic instead of the powder.  I also tried it without the corn when I forgot to buy it, it tasted great too.  Thanks!

I liked this recipe, but felt the flavor was a little bland.  Second time I made it, I omitted the dill and added fresh chopped garlic with the onions and celery.  Then, because it was too chunky, I used an immersion blender to smooth out the consistency. At the very end, added about 1/4 c. marsala wine to make it more like a bisque.  The family loved it.

Very good! I added peas, left out the cheese, and used frozen salmon. I had bought canned salmon but was grossed out when I opened the can. This chowder is so good- don't waste it on canned salmon!

Delicious! I did customize this recipe to my own preferences and it turned out amazingly. Instead of a chopped onion, I used a large leek,  I traded the tsp of garlic powder for a tbsp of fresh minced garlic, substituted sweet potatoes for regular potatoes, omitted the carrots completely, added a sprinkle of lemon pepper instead of regular salt and pepper, added some crushed red pepper flakes, used 1 1/2 lbs of fresh salmon fillets (bbq'ed on the grill outside first), switched the 15 ounce can of creamed corn for a 10 3/4 oz. can of Cream of Mushroom soup, and sprinkled only about 1/2 the amount of cheese suggested.

Very good, I followed recipe almost exactly. I rated a 4, not 5, because although good, I think fresh salmon instead of canned would made have made it a 10 and made a big difference! Will use fresh next time for an excellent chowder! Thanks for the recipe!

We really like this soup for something different.  It reminded us of New England Clam Chowder.  I used all of the ingredients listed, but not in the proportions recommended.  Used one 14.5 oz. can of salmon, one can each evaporated milk, creamed corn, and chicken broth. I didn't measure the vegetables, but used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, salt, & pepper, & 1 tsp. dill.  Will make again!

I thought this was delicious!  I added a little more chicken stock because I was afraid it wouldn't make enough for my family.  It looked kind of thin but as soon as I took it off the burner the salmon absorbed a lot of the liquid making it really thick and delicious!

This was okay, but it didn't wow me. It would be better with fresh garlic and fresh salmon (as others have done and suggested). Also, cut down on the cheese or serve it on the side.

Absolutely fabulous and so easy to fix. This is a great change of pace from the other chowders in our recipe box, and a better use of canned salmon than simply making patties.

My husband went crazy for this recipe.  He claimed that it was the BEST soup that I had ever made.  I however...thought it was a little too fishy.  I used fresh salmon that had been cooked on the grill the night before.  Thanks for the recipe.

this is a good base recipe from which i improvised using what i had on hand and incorporating the previous suggestions: 2T minced garlic, fresh salmon (baked 10min 350'), plain canned corn, can of cream of potato soup, water. i left out celery, dill, and milk b/c i don't like the first two and i was out of milk (thus the cream of potato soup, water, chick broth). it was chunky like a stew, as i prefer it, but more water could be added if desired. i will make this again but include smoked salmon, as it makes all the difference.

We loved this recipe, even my 5 & 7 year olds.  I made it with fresh salmon, cut down on the mild and just used additional broth, 1/2 of the recommended amount of cheese and it was still thick and creamy.  I did drop a few drops of hickory smoke in it.  For my bowl I added some fresh chopped basil and it was great, it helped offset the sweetness from the corn.  I will definetly be making this again.

This soup is awesome!  One of the best chowders I've made so far!  Still, I found this recipe a bit on the salty side. I wish I added salt at the end, since the corn, cheese, and butter had enough flavor that I could have added less salt.  I stuck mostly to the recipe, except I used 1/2 the amount of salmon and cheese and it turned out perfect.  I also added a few tablespoons of flour (mixed with equal water) to thicken the soup at the end.  Though the recipe says it makes for 8, it was gone in 24 hours by 2 people...that's how good it was!

I made this for my family and I thought it was very good but not great. I served with warm rolls and a vegetable mixture of corn, babycorn broccoli and carrots. My 8 year old son who has recently become a picky eater, refused to eat it. My Husband and Mom devoured it. I think I would prefer it as a corn chowder with no salmon or maybe just a less fishy tasting seafood. I don't care for the taste of cooked salmon but I had some in my freezer that I needed to use up. I used grated carrots - I thought they would look pretty and professional and they did. I used fresh salmon, fresh Garlic and Fresh Dill. I sauteed in Butter with a strip of bacon. My husband loves bacon My Great Aunt used bacon in here chowder so I thought I would try it. I almost didn't add the dill because I thought my family wouldn't like it. The dill was essential and very yummy. I used about half the salmon and a little more then half of the cheese as called for in the recipe. If you love cooked salmon this will be a recipe you will love. Very easy and filling. Oh and I lamost forgot - I used cauliflower instead of potatoes which we loved.

I made this for my mom's birthday party and it was a hit!  I did change a few things.  I fried 4 slices of bacon and after that crisped, I sauteed the onion, celery in the oil and butter.  I also added chopped zucchinni to that.  I used fresh salmon instead of can.  I added a dash of hickory smoke and grated one carrot instead of diced.  I'm sure the original recipe was great the way it was, but I like to experiment when cooking and usually change a few things.  I will be making this one again!

This was an awesome soup! I love Salmon so I thought I would try it. I definitely recommend using fresh salmon and garlic. Also I added some liquid smoke to my salmon while cooking it to give it more flavor.

Delicious and easy to make. I made a mistake of reheating the soup though. I forgot I have already added the cheese while reheating, thus didn't realize I have to stir it constantly, thus it was slightly burn. So a reminder to all - remember to stir is consistantly once you have added the cheese. Also, I have omitted the salt and pepper completely and it tasted just right.

Wonderful.  I made this exactly as the recipe with the following exceptions.  The fish market was closed when I went to get my salmon, so I bought a smoked salmon filet in the dairy section of my grocery store and added a small can of cooked shredded chicken to make up for the size of my smoked salmon filet (chopped up before I added).  One word, wonderful!  Even better the next day!!  I won't make it any different the next time..Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was soo good! I didn't follow exactly which is why I gave 4 stars. I took some other reviewers suggestions and used low fat evap. milk and only 1 cup of cheddar. I also omitted the celery (personal preference), used a bit more salt at the end and threw in about half cup of crab meat I happeneded to have. My daughter said it was delicious!! I'd have to agree.

This was great.  Very similar to clam chowder.  I added 2 bay leaves, thyme and fresh garlic and omitted the celery and dill.  I also must have bought the wrong canned salmon because I had to debone it.  What a pain.  Next time I'll use fresh salmon instead.

This is a great chowder!  I loved it.  I've been craving salmon chowder for a while and this really hit the spot.  It can be a little salty (and I omitted the added salt, used unsalted butter and low-sodium broth) so watch out for that.  It must be the canned salmon, corn and cheese.  I only added over half of the cheese and I think I will add less next time.  This had great color too.  I used red potatoes.  I also added about 1/3 cup frozen super sweet white corn with the other corn and it really added a nice sweet flavor.  I will make this again!

Outstanding!  We bake and freeze salmon in 2 cup portions, and this recipe if perfect for a quick soup.  The only change I did was to reduce the amount of dill to 1/4 teaspoon.  Just a personal preference for a family that doesn't love a lot of dill!

This was a great recipe.  I added 1 can of canned crab, 1 tsp cajun spice and used seasoned salt instead of plain salt.  I also doubled the dill.  I am not a fan of corn so I omitted this, but it turned out absolutely fabulous

This was delicious.  I used two salmon fillets (I'd frozen the leftovers from the Bloody Mary Salmon recipe) and 12oz of regular milk.  I also left out the 1t salt since the chicken broth was pretty salty already.

This was really good!  The only thing I would change next time I made this, would be to add a bit more evaporated milk, so it wasn't as thick.  Overall a great salmon dish!

Yum! I used a 16 oz container of tiny red potatoes, quartered. I also added a cup of water to offset the extra potatoes & any saltiness.I used 2 6oz cans of the boneless skinless salmon & added 1/2 t. liquid smoke. Also cut the cheese amount to 1/4 pound. Wasn't too "corny" to me- & I don't even like creamed corn! This is really delicious & easy. Try it!

My family loved this soup.  I also used 3 boneless salmon filets instead of canned salmon.  The taste of creamed corn was quite strong but that added to the flavor.   A hearty and delicious soup - thanks for posting the recipe.

This was excellent. Especially on a cold gloomy day.  I added more butter, lots of fresh dill, and a bit more salmon than it called for. It was really good.

an excellent recipe.  I cut back on the amount of canned salmon by about 1/4 and added smoked salmon (about 4 ounces) to the recipe and it tasted great.  I also am not fond of Celery and Onions in any soup so I substituted Onion Powder and Celery seeds to keep the needed flavor.  It turned out great.

Next time will make it low fat with fat free milk and low fat margarine or butter.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times.  I keep adding more corn, more potatoes, and more celery.  I add extra dill.  My 14 year old daughter who hates fish, especially canned salmon, loves it.

After eating smoked salmon chowder at a seafood restraunt in CA I was on the search for a recipe just as good.  This one is it! I use only about 6oz of canned salmon and 4-6oz of SMOKED salmon and it is wonderful.  The smoked flavor really adds something to this chowder.  I serve sourdough bread on the side.  My whole family loves this meal.

It was so easy and tastes fantastic!  I would suggest fresh garlic and I used fat free evaporated milk to reduce a little fat.

I've made this soup several times now, and we love it! It is permanently added to our "favorites" list.

We have started eating more salmon in our diet and this is a great way to do so.  I used left over smoked salmon and doubled the cheese (oh how we love cheese.)  This was a big hit, like another comment I wonder if this will freeze so I can make a large amount at once.  If you are looking for a way to enjoy something new this is the one for you.
