I read another reviewers comment about the addition of protein powder to smoothies. I think it all depends what brand you use. My protein powder is delicious and did not add any 'artificial' taste. Quite on the contrary it enhanced the flavors. This is a delicious smoothie that I will make again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

I would rate this recipe about a 3. In my honest opinion using protein powder or similar nutritional supplements to smoothies, that are not whole food ingredients, gives a smoothie that vitamin like after taste. It dominates the flavor. This was no exception. I was able to save it by tossing a frozen banana in at the end, hence my higher rating. It did remind me that I need to remember to add flax meal or similar foods to my smoothies.
