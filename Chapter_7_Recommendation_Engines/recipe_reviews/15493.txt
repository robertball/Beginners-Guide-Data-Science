Very good!  It's more sour than sweet, so if you like it sweet then add more of the pineapple juice and brown sugar.

Great dipping sauce!  If you like more sweet than sour, use rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I also like my sauces a little thicker, so I added a bit more cornstarch as the submitter suggested.  If you want a richer color, add a couple drops of red food coloring - it works wonders.  This stuff was great and my husband took one taste and all he could say was "Mmmmmmm".  We ate this with egg rolls, and it was perfect.

This was really good!  I was looking for a sauce to use to make sweet  sour chicken with veggies and this worked great.  I sauteed some chicken until browned, added sliced carrots, onions  red peppers, cooked for a few more minutes, then added the sauce and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  It thickened a little and coated everything nicely.  Easy and tasty!

This is a great all-purpose dipping sauce. I use it for spring rolls, coconut shrimp and pot stickers.  I made it a bit thicker, and I also like it with red pepper flakes or a bit of chili paste in it.

This came out much thinner than I wanted, so I added another teaspoon of corn starch to a teaspoon of cold water, stirred in and let simmer for 4-6 minutes. Perfect, and I LOVE that it wasn't bright red! Update Jan. 1, 2011: started with 2 tsp corn starch, used seasoned rice wine vinegar, 3/4 tsp canola oil and 1/4 tsp sesame oil, no salt, and left everything else the same, and it was awesome. 5-star keeper!

the very best homemade recipe so far, only I have had better at restaurants -- I used rice wine vinegar which is an asian ingredient vinegar, & it gave it a more authentic taste.

I wanted to use this sauce with stir fry so I added a little extra cornstarch to make it a little thicker but made no other changes. This was exactly what I was looking for and I will be using it as a dipping sauce soon.

The flavor of this was really good. I had to triple this only because it really didn't make as much as I thought it would. Once I set it on the stove and brought it to a boil, it wouldn't thicken. I had to make a slurry of 1/4 c. extra pineapple juice and another tbsp. of cornstarch. With just under a half of the slurry, it thickened up to where we needed it. NOTE: Jillian was absolutely right. The rice wine vinegar is the one you want to go with.

Nice! Pretty strong on vinegar (I used rice instead of white), but great for vinegar lovers. This sauce is also a little thin, so I would probably thicken it more as the submitter suggests if I were wanting more cling to it - but because it is strong, the consistency as written works well for dipping without getting an overbearing amount of sauce. We had ours with vegetable spring rolls and it was really good. Thanks!

The second Sweet and Sour sauce I made for one meal, and this one was the keeper. It calls for a touch too much sugar and ketchup, I think, but other than that it's a great recipe in a pinch. It went really well with the Beef Egg Rolls by Trisha off this site. I might also, in the future, cut back on the oil a bit, but just to make it slightly less unhealthy. Thanks, Jackie, for a quick and easy recipe!

This was delightful! I must admit that we had no ketchup on hand, just my husband and I who do not use ketchup. However, I did use the same amount of a mild BBQ sauce in place of that. It turned out spectacular! We used in on coconut shrimp my husband made and I would highly recommend it for dipping BBQ chicken, or any other grilled meat/s. Super easy, super good and very impressive. I will never buy bottled S&S sauce again, I am sure you could even substitute plum jelly in place of the ketchup for an instant plum sauce. We make our own eggrolls and pan fried dumplings, this sauce would work very well with those. This is a true keeper, thank you for sharing...

I thought this sauce was absolutely amazing, so much more flavorful than the red goo from the local takeout place.  Unfortunately, my dh prefers his cornsyrup with red food coloring and didn't care for this so much.  So, 4*s.

Loved the flavor, but found it a bit runny.  So, after it cooled, I mixed in another tsp of corn starch, reboiled it, and it was great!  Definitely a keeper.

Served this with sweet and sour pork patties (made as meatballs) from this site (added ketchup, mustard, and worcestershire to the meatballs as one reviewer had suggested) roasted red peppers, pineapple chunks, and brown rice.  Yummy and everyone loved it!  Saving the left overs to eat with egg rolls tomorrow night!

I don't buy/have pineapple juice, so I drained a can of crushed pineapple, which provided more than enough.  It's punchy, not cloyingly sweet like most jarred S&S sauce.  This is a keeper.  (I did add the additional cornstarch for a thicker sauce.) EDIT: I just realized I left out the oil... but it didn't need it, so I won't use it in the future, either.

We try not to eat food dye especially red 40 so when I found this recipe I had to try it. It is so easy. I do add a bit more cornstarch for dipping so it's not so drippy but we usually have some made up all the time since my kids love spring rolls and crab ragoon. I also use rice wine vinegar which I think gives it just a bit of a better flavor.

As is, this recipe is only okay to me. I definitely like my sweet and sour sauce to be more viscous (like you'd get at a Chinese take-out place) so it needs more cornstarch. It's also pretty vinegary, but that could be improved upon with either more pineapple juice and brown sugar OR using rice vinegar vs. plain white distilled.

This was excellent!  I added a bit more cornstarch to make it slightly thicker and used the juice of 1 can of pineapple chunks and 3-4 pieces of pineapple. I also added 1/4 of a large diced green pepper. Yummy! It tasted exactly like the sweet and sour sauce you would get at a restaurant!

As written this is a 3 star recipe. I agree with another reviewer that said it was a bit on the sour side. Take the advice of other reviewers - more sugar/ketchup, rice vinegar, sesame oil - and you'll have a 5 star sauce.

Super duper dipper for my egg rolls!  I added a LOT of cornstarch to thicken it up, but recipe is great as written.

incredible! i was making some freezer spring rolls and the sauce looked gross so i figured i would find a recipe.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because i couldn't find any and i used the juice from a can of fruit because i didn't have any pineapple juice.  Luckily that seemed to do just the trick, it was the perfect combination of sweet and sour =).  Made the frozen spring rolls a huge hit!

Great sauce!! But I did add a little bit more brown sugar, as the vinegar was a bit overpowering.  I also double the recipe and then store in the fridge for later.  Usually when I am making this it is for large parties......so good!

Maybe it was just me but I found this far too watery even after adding more cornstarch and cooking it for longer in hopes of thickening it up. Then after repeat tastings, both my son and I kept thinking it was far too 'sour' and would add a little more sugar, then a little more, then it was too sweet so a bit more ketchup.. Maybe it was cook's error though, not necessarily the recipe. Or maybe we're just too picky.

Made this to go with some store bought chicken nuggets, and it went over a storm.  A little too ketchup-y for me, and also a little too think.  I made more slurry by coming additional pineapple juice and cornstarch and stirring it while adding it to the pot.  Came out wonderfully and we will be using this again.  Thank you!

I doubled the ingredients using no oil nor salt and used rice vinegar.  I did use 1 T. cornstarch dissolved in 1 T. water to thicken it more.  Rather than a dipping sauce, I used it as a sauce for Sweet and Sour Chicken--wonderful!  The leftovers were great, too.  DH added hot pepper to his which worked terrific.  I'm going to make another batch and keep it in the freezer for when I need a quick sauce.

Very good dipping sauce and better than the packets for sure. I made some changes to get it to my liking:  1. rice wine vinegar instead of distilled white 2. 3 teaspoons cornstarch- otherwise not thick enough 3.sesame oil instead of vegetable oil 4. 4 tablespoons brown sugar  These litlle changes made it better than take out sauce for us, thanks for the basic recipe-it was a great place to start!

Very Good! Just as it is. I've made this sauce a few times.  It is great for sweet and sour meatballs over steamed rice!  I have also used orange juice instead of pineapple which made it even more tangy :)

I have finally tweaked this recipe to where my hubby likes it. I triple the corn starch, use half the vinegar, and triple the brown sugar. Yep, it's a pretty big departure. :) I make it with homemade chicken nuggets, so the husband can have them without the fillers from a fast food joint!

I ended up adding another 1/2 cup pineapple juice and a whole cup of brown sugar to make this sweet and sour, otherwise, it was just all sour. The pineapple juice adds a nice twist to sweet and sour!

This sauce was just okay.  It has a very strong vinegar taste even after additional sweetening.  I did thicken it a bit more so it would resemble more of a sauce than a dip..but I have had better sauces.

We loved it! I didn't have brown sugar, so I used white sugar and a touch of honey, and it was the first time I'd ever had sweet and sour sauce that was actually both sweet and sour! Definite repeat!

So much better than the jarred junk! I did find it a pinch too sweet so I added soy sauce to taste. Also- always thought you had to boil corn starch to make it thicken? Could be wrong though ;-) but I boiled mine for a few minutes and it came out the perfect consistency. I subbed  rice vinegar too. Great as is and with a splash of sirracha when you would like a little heat.

I have a favorite Chinese restaurant where they have the best sweet'n'sour sauce and it is orange.  All others have the pink version.  When I saw this recipe, I had to try it and I am not disappointed.  My family absolutely loves this sauce and I do not have to travel 60 miles now in order to get it.  Thank you!

The ingredients are spot on. The only thing that confused me was that the cornstarch was added at the beginning. I've never seen that before. My little knowledge of cooking tells me to add the vinegar and brown sugar, heat and wisk to dissolve. Add the pineapple juice and then as the mix comes up to heat, add the cornstarch that has been dissolved in cold water or a bit of reserved pineapple juice. I then add a couple of drops of red food coloring to give it that restaurant look. Not to knock this recipe...just to add my take on the recipe

This is an excellent sweet and sour sauce. I did not have any pineapple juice, so I used apple juice and used double the cornstarch and 4 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar and 3 tablespoons of ketchup and the family loved it.

This was very good and quick to whip up, we like big chunks of pineapple in ours and I added about a tspn of sweet soy sauce. Other than that this is a good tasting recipe and I've saved it to my recipe box. Thanks.

Delish! Just the right balance of sweet to sour.  I zipped it up with about a teaspoon red chili paste.

I was looking for a sweet and sour sauce recipe for my ribs when I saw this one.  It looked fast and easy and it could be doctored if needed.  It was wonderful, the thing different that I did was add about a half cup pineapple chunks left from kabobs and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar as it was just a tad to sweet.  This has been printed and saved.

not all that thick unless you use corn starch, but tastes a lot like the restaurants make it.

This recipe is kind of bland. We added more pineapple juice for a little bit less tang, pepper, and extra ketchup. Its obviously not as good as store bought, but it is an OK substitute in a pinch.

This was great!  I did not have brown sugar or pineapple juice so I used white sugar and apple juice.    It went great with a Hawaiian stir fry:  pineapple, yellow pepper, red pepper, green onion, and real bacon bits served over rice    soooo goood and sooo easy!

Way too much vinegar, I had to add more sugar and more ketchup...I used canned juice maybe that was why.  If I try again I'll add the vinegar by tbs to taste.

This is so-so. I didn't have pineapple juice, but had a can of crushed pineapple, so I added that and then strained the pineapple out after cooking.  I don't care for the ketchup taste, so I might switch to tomato sauce next time.  I didn't like how this tasted alone, but once dipped into an eggroll, it's pretty tasty!

I enjoyed this with egg rolls, but at the first taste felt that the vinegar came through too strong.  I added some more brown sugar and let it simmer a bit to mellow some of the vinegar taste.  Perhaps using rice vinegar the next time would be a solution.  I was also a bit skeptical about using the vegetable oil as I have never made a sweet and sour sauce with that ingredient.  But after bringing the sauce to a boil with constant whisking, the oil emulsified into the sauce and gave it an especially smooth consistency.

I can only give this recipe 4 stars if you make it the way it's written. However, if you use a premium rice vinegar, and sesame seed oil it tastes better than take out.

This is just like what you get in a restaurant with sweet and sour chicken.  Except I accidently put in 1 tsp. of corn syrup instead of corn starch, but it was excellent.

I made this sauce for my homemade egg rolls and my family loved it. The only thing I did different was to use a total of 2 & 1/4 tsp of corn starch, oh, and I didn't add any salt, it still turned out good.

This recipe was just ok.  It did not thicken up and was pretty runny and it tasted a bit too strong of vinegar.  Even still, my family did enjoy it with our homemade eggrolls.

Pretty good. A little too much vinegar taste for me. I'll play around with the measurements. Added a 2 TBSP more sugar to cut the vinegar.

I agree, a little more sour than sweet. At first I didn't like it but it grew on me.  I used it with chicken bites as an appetizer. Will make again, but with a little more juice and sugar.

Sorry, but not good. WAY too sour and WAY too thin. I had to add a ton more brown sugar and a good amount of corn starch to thicken it up.
I was hoping for the sweet version like in the Chinese restaurants.

All you can taste is the vinegar. I had to add crushed pineapple and tons of brown sugar and left this on the stove to reduce down and let the sugar develop. Would not recommend this recipe.

3.3.18   Enjoyed this sauce with some cabbage and pork dumplings.  The pineapple flavor was overpowering the other ingredients just a bit, so I added more ketchup which toned that down.  Really good balance of sweet-sour, I love how quickly this can be made, and there’s no chopping or grating ANYTHING.  This is the best sweet and sour sauce I've made from this site, and it would be an excellent choice for coconut shrimp.

For flavor its perfectly fine but the brown sugar was a mistake. It made the color of the sauce brown. I'm going to remake it with white sugar. I want the coloring of sweet chili sauce. However, if you don't mind a brown sauce, and for some things I don't, add some pineapple chunks, sriracha, and some soy sauce to it and its fabulous! That's what I ended up doing with mine. It won't go to waste.

This was a great base recipe. I used orange juice instead of pineapple. I also added more cornstarch to make it thicker. Fun recipe that you can modify to fit the ingredients on hand.

The basic recipe was good.  I did, however, make changes.  Unfortunately I don't measure as I go by taste. The sauce was extremely sour.  So, I did add a few more tablespoons of brown sugar and increased the cornstarch  to give it a thicker consistency.

I really enjoyed making this, only did little adjustments.  I double my corn starch and added more brown sugar.  From reading other reviews it was not sweet enough.  The end result was thick and sweet & sour. Made enough to bottle some for later, my family loved it.

I actually combined all the ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and then put it in the microwave for about a min and when I started to see if bubbling I would stir it. it tastes great and was super quick

I used a can of pineapple juice and boiled it down from a liter to about 2 cups.  Added all the other ingredients except the brown sugar,  and it was perfect.

This dipping sauce was the best part of the Asian meal I made tonight.  My 9 year old agrees!

Very simple and quick to make. I added another teaspoon of cornstarch, used seasoned rice wine vinegar. Really very good.

It was alright but next time I think I'll try it without the ketchup. I used rice vinegar and didn't have pure pineapple juice so I used my pineapple/orange juice in it. It does taste nearly identical to Chinese take out sauce they give you with crab Rangoon, except theirs is more sweet.

This was great. I did not have pineapple juice so i replaced it with a half can (3/4 cup) of peaches. Put the peaches in a magic bullet and pureed them. It was so good. Will use this again, thanks.

I found this to be still too "sour" even taking some of the other suggestions into account ie: increasing the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and using rice vinegar.  
I think I'll keep searching for something different.

A girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. hahaha... I used what I had at hand. Added 1/2 tsp cornstarch for the consistency I was looking for. Silly me I didn't have pineapple juice so I used the juice off the mandarin oranges. I substituted 1/4 tsp oil for sesame oil.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. Guess I was in the mood for something spicy so I added chili garlic sauce. ...It was delicious

Very tasty and easy. I prefer more tart so upped it to 1/2 cup rice vinegar. I wasn't sure why the oil, but next time I'll use coconut for additional sweetness.
