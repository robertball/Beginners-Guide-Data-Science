I added slightly less butter and left them in the oven for an hour. They needed a little time to "set-up", so I left them on the counter for about 15 minutes before serving. They were really good with our corned beef on St. Patrick's Day!

These really are old irish, my great grandmother used this recipe. As you say, what ever you have on hand!
She made these for any big meal with the family, if she had extra cheese, extra ham scraps, a bit of bacon, it went in! Green onions in spring too! Every time she made them, they were different, but this is the basic idea of this recipe! If she didn't have cream, she made a basic white sauce with milk and butter and used that, but usually she made them when she had extra cream from the farm!

For us these were not tasty enough to justify the calories - they need finely diced or sliced onion for sure - maybe a paprika seasoning between the layers.  As is these were nothing special to write home about.  Thanks for sharing - they have potential but need a bit of tweaking to bring them up to their potential.

Good but I layered the potatoes with thin onion slices and grated cheddar cheese.  I then combined melted butter, 1/2 & 1/2 and a small pour of sherry which I then poured over the layered potato mixture.  Baked at 400 for 45 minuets.  Got raves from my family.

No Irish in my family tree, but this is a recipe my Grams taught me. She also threw "whatever you have" into the mix.  But we use buttermilk (left over from the churning, no one likes to drink it in my house but we sure like to cook with it!) My standard mix includes garlic.  Not sure if it's the same recipe, but it's the same principal :)

Not all of my family likes scalloped potatoes, so I cut this recipe in half, and substituted 2% milk for the cream. In my covered casserole dish, the potatoes cooked through in about 30 minutes. Although they fell apart more than I expected (next time I will slice a little thicker, by hand, rather than using the slicer) they were delicious (although a bit too buttery for my taste). I ended up sprinkling with some shredded jack cheese and adding a bit more milk to make  more of a sauce. This will definitely be added to my regular side dish rotation.

I made this recipe, and like other members, I made a few changes for our taste.  I layered the potatoes with sliced butter, salt, pepper, onion powder, cooked chopped bacon, cheese, a mixture of 1/2 heavy whipping cream and 1/2 milk on each layer.  I made two layers using 5 smaller russett potatoes sliced thin.  I used the recommended amount of butter but feel I will use 1/2 of that next time (1/4 cup).  This recipe is not for calorie concious!  But it is amazingly delicious!  I only gave it four stars by itself as written... changes made to the recipe really made it five stars for sure.

Bake time is GROSSLY understated.  Needs 90 minutes....not 20! 
Add some salt
Use shredded not sliced cheese. 
Add some rosemary for flavoring

Made exactly as recipe was written, and the whole family loved them.  Two suggestions already made by other reviewers, next time I will slice the potatoes a bit thicker as they were breaking apart when forked; and possibly using less butter since there was a lot of melted butter floating on top of the sauce, but if it changes the flavor I won't change a thing - because these were wonderful just as is!  This is a fabulous traditional and simple dish, melts in your mouth and very calming!  I may try some suggested variations because this recipe is also a fantastic starting point for experimentation!

They were really good.  My sliced potatoes were sticking to each other, so next time I will probably try cubes.  Other than that, it was perfect!

Made the original recipe first, then added a few ingredients to it the second time around. Chopped fresh green onion (use the entire bunch), 10 pieces of bacon diced up. When layering the potatoes I added in half of the onions and bacon between layers of potatoes, then evenly spread the remaining on top. After baking for an hour, added a 1/4” layer of shredded mozzarella and baked for 10 more minutes to melt the cheese. After cooling for 10 to 15 minutes, it was amazing.

Baked at 350 for 60 minutes and that seemed to work.  Added onion, green bell pepper and shredded sharp cheddar to the mix - which might take the recipe from its roots but adds a bit more flavor - my .02

Very good as is. Cooked for about 60 minutes, not 20 as someone seemed to think. Obviously the addition of  other ingredients (onions), could  be added.  I grew up on the farm (in the early 60's  and potatoes, milk, butter were  common on most  meals.

We loved this recipe!  The easiest scalloped potatoes ever thanks to the cream and the long slow bake time.  I probably won't make the traditional scalloped potatoes ever again because this sauce is rich without being heavy, thick, or gooey.  I like that the only carbs in the recipe are the natural ones in the potatoes.  I took other raters' advice and tweaked the recipe by adding what I had in the pantry to the basic recipe.  I added some leftover cooked crumbled sausage, some paprika, diced onion, garlic salt, and pepper.  Trust the Irish to know how to cook potatoes.

I added a touch of grated parmesan and gruyere cheeses and last minute scallions on top.  My family respectfully requested that I double the recipe next time. :-)

This was an easy dish that on it's own is good but it is way better with add ins.  I added in frozen peas and it was amazing!  I can not wait to make this again and see what else I can add to boost the basic flavor.

Just ok.  Too much butter, should be cut in half.  Needs a little onion powder and paprika.  Cook time was 70 mins on 350.

First time using a food processor, and it took no time to slice the potatoes.  Start to oven was 10 minutes.  But...not perfect because I used whipping cream instead of table cream/half & half/milk, and added Parmesan.  Now, that said, there aren't any leftovers! :)

Oh yeah, this was good.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and left the skin on.  Reminded me of a rustic scalloped potato dish.
