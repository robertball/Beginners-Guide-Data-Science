This is delicious. I wanted more sauce so I ended up quadrupling it. It took about a five-inch piece of ginger through my juicer to get 4 tablespoons of juice. I used a frozen steak so it was easier to cut into thin strips. Keep this easy recipe handy for those need a fast good meal moments. Thank you for the recipe.
