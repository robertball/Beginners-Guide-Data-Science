This is a classic. Perfect as it is! When I want to feed a crowd I will increase the tomatoes to 28 oz add a pound of seared scallops(same way) in addition to the shrimp, and a couple of cups of clams or mussels.This has a complex flavor but is equally fresh and zippy!!! John does a great job with classic favorites!!! I love the way the seafood sears when the oil is tossed with it, instead of in the pan.

This was really good AND easily came together after a late night at work.  I chose to serve it over some linguini.  We liked it, but I think I'd use a little EVOO in the pan for cooking the shrimp (if not using cast iron).  I realized we didn't have any white wine, so I subbed a merlot and I subbed dried parsley for fresh.  THANKS for another well explained recipe, Chef John!

This was the best fra diavalo I have ever made, and I have tried several.  Watch Chef John's video for tips you won't see on the written recipe, like drying the shrimp before seasoning it, etc...I found this recipe so fast to make too.  For those reviewers complaining it's too spicy, they have no business making this recipe--try shrimp salad instead!  Good grief.  The red pepper flakes make the dish, and unlike so many others, I DID have Aleppo chili, glad I was able to find a use for it.  It's easily found online, Amazon and other places. But the recipe is not hurt by not having it.  I prefer not to put anything like pasta or rice with this, I like that on the side.  That's how I roll.  I don't like the sauce too thick either, so I simmered the sauce for only 5 mins, not 10, so it wouldn't reduce too much.  But if it does, simply add a splash of broth.  This goes well with shrimp and clams added, mussels, etc...the sauce is a vehicle to let your imagination fly. By the way, I used more oregano bc I buy it direct from Italy on its branches, it is not anything like store bought, you need to try REAL dried oregano from Italy.  Since this recipe uses so few ingredients, use the best you can find...100% Italian oregano, 100% Italian tomatoes too, good white wine you would drink, etc....  Don't cut corners here, you can't hide bad ingredients in a dish that uses so few.  So glad I found this recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe for Shrimp Fra Diavolo.  Loved it!  Made the recipe as written with only a couple of exceptions.  Omitted the aleppo pepper since I didn't have any and I halved the salt. I also used a can of Italian diced tomatoes that I ran through the food processor for the crushed tomatoes just so I could use what I had in the pantry.  Very delicious!  My husband & I both loved it.

Fixed this dish tonight For my family and it got a thumbs up from all three of us. Tossing the shrimp with EVOO and spices really brought out the flavor of the shrimp. It's pretty quick and easy to put together with a salad and bread.  
Really great dish!

Made it exactly as described....with HOME MADE PASTA.  And it was delicious.  Paired it with a Caesar Salad, fresh Baguette and an excellent bottle of Chardonnay.  Perfecto!

I love your garlic shrimp but this is not your best effort.  Way too much spice.  I realize that fra diavolo is supposed to be spicy, but this was way out there.  I only used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, no aleppo peppers.  considering that shrimp have a very delicate flavor the sauce absolutely overwhelmed them, and I normally eat very spicy.

Great dish. Not too tough to make. I will use less than 1 tsp of salt next time. A little too salty for me and I tend to like more salt than most.  I served it over linguine noodles and poured the remaining Chardonnay to serve with it.

I loved this.  I used a Pinot Grigio and so glad I did. Tasted very fresh.  Didn’t have the Aleppo pepper, fresh parsley or fresh basil so just skipped.  I did add a little cayenne to shrimp while it was searing in the pan. Followed recipe otherwise. Can’t wait to make it again.

Used mussels instead of shrimp. (Made the sauce first and added mussels during the simmer.) Everyone LOVED it!!! A staple for mussels at our house from now on! :-)

I didn't have the Aleppo Chili powder, so I substituted chipotle chili powder.  This is a spicy dish.  I'll make it again now that I've found the Aleppo chili flakes.

I ended up doubling the shrimps but more or less doubled the other ingredients. It wasn`t  as spicy as we would have liked but it was still yummy. Next time, we will increase the spices.

Very flavorful dish and easy to make. I did add a bit more heat and garlic for my taste, but otherwise as written. No leftovers! I prefer serving it over rice, with some crusty bread and a good wine.

I have tried a number of Fra Diavolo recipes, and this is the only one that had the right amount of spice and flavor. Instead of using shrimp and going through the steps of cooking up the shrimp, I sauteed the onion and garlic in the oil with the crushed red pepper before adding the rest of the ingredients. Then, as the pasta was cooking I added a bag of frozen cooked shellfish to heat up in the sauce. I did have to add a little bit of tomato powder to thicken the sauce after that, but it tasted great!

Fabulous taste.  Lots of flavor.  I didn't have white wine so I used red (Malbec) which was VERY good.  I also did not have basil unfortunately.  A bit too salty.  Will definitely make again. My husband loved it.

This was simply delicious.  I increased the size of the recipe and added halibut, scallops and clams.  I always cook with a good tasting wine that compliments the dish.  I have made several different versions of this dish, and this is my favorite.

Good basic dish - didn't have Aleppo pepper. Season the shrimp a bit more, it was kind of bland.

I used 1/2 cup sherry wine instead of white wine, used fresh tomatoes, and added 1 red pepper. It came out tasty, just a bit salty, but that may have been because I halved the alcohol. Very easy to make. I served it over brown rice pasta. Would make it again with 1/2 teaspoon salt instead.

I made this as written and found the recipe not the perfect 5 that I typically expect from Chef John (I'm a big fan). The dish came out spicy enough for me, but I would prefer the sauce to be a little thicker, the flavor to be just a bit more. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was easy to make and a simple recipe to follow. My husband requested this for dinner and I'd never made it before, so I was pleasantly surprised by his raves of just how delicious it was! I didn't have the Aleppo pepper on hand, so I just added some black pepper, but I'm sure it would definitely "take it up a notch" and will be sure to have it next time I make it.

This was so good!  I did not have any allepo peppers, just used crushed red peppers.  I added a little half and half to the sauce at the end.  will definitely make this again.  I used  my own canned 
tomatoes .

Excellent, I used fresh tomatoes, and added red pepper and asparagus. But the flavor was great, and I am sure it would have been without the added veggies. Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe as written with just a few small adjustments.  First, I did not use Aleppo pepper.  I also did as another reviewer suggested and simmered the shrimp shells in the wine to give it an extra layer of flavor.  Finally, I added a can of chopped clams.  Sauce was amazing and I will definitely be making this again!

A simple, tasty dish that has just the right amount of spice. I did add cayenne pepper flakes, a bit of old bay seasoning, and dried/ground tomato skins for extra flavor. Was done in no time and it got great reviews. Thank you Chef John!

Recipe was just the right amount of heat! 
I didn't have shrimp on hand so I used  leftover steamed lobster tail and fresh clams to substitute for the shrimp.
 I started off steaming the clams and lobster shells in Half a cup of the white wine. After the clams opened I strained and reserved the juices from the pan. (It ended up being a full cup of wine and fresh clam juice, as the recipe called for) then I followed the recipe as written in leiu of the shrimp. Finally, I chopped the lobster tail and clams and added it at the very end to warm through. 
I will undoubtedly make this again.

Yuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Wow was this good, and easy to make.
I even got my grandson, who doesn't like shrimp, to take a second helping.  We all had seconds!
I cooked a cup of rice to go with the shrimp and had none left over with 3 people eating.
Hats off to Chef John.  Everything he posts here  is excellent.

One last thing, I couldn't find Aleppo pepper  anywhere so I substituted chipolte pepper

It was even better the next day for lunch.  Our only issue was the pepper flakes.  We don't like biting into them so next time I'll use ground peppers.  Thanks Chef John!
