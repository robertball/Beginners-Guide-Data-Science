This was very good - only changes I made were to make it in slow cooker and pour about 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce over roast.  Cooked on low for about 6-7 hours - meat was so tender, it fell apart as I took it out of the crockpot.

I've been making roast like this for as long as I've been cooking.  For the last few years though, I have been adding some worstershire sauce over the whole roast then put the pepper and kosher salt over the whole roast and bake as directed.  I find the worster. sauce gives it a really nice flavor and seems to make it even more tender.  I also do this method with Prime Rib.

This was really good! Everyone loved it. I used whole cloves of garlic and a lot more pepper than 1 tsp I also rubbed the pepper into the meat instead of just sprinkling it on. I also seared the meat on all sides (use a pan that can go from stove top to oven). I put large pieces of carrots, potatoes, onions around the roast when I lowered the tempature. They were so good and the drippings made a really tasty gravy! Thanks!

What is with everybody taking a good piece of meat and making it into a pot roast? if you want moist heat (like using a crockpot) use a cheap cut, and it will turn out great. If you're using a nice cut, use the dry method without adding water or you're wrecking all the qualities you're paying extra for!!!

Easy in the crock pot too. Just sear meat first before adding to the crock pot. I cooked on low for a little less than 8 hours.

I followed the recipe exactly and cooked the roast to 160 degrees for medium.  It was the toughest piece of meat I have ever cooked.

I think the hour and twenty minutes is a tad too long to cook this roast.  It came out tough and chewy, a big disappointment for a $20 cut of meat.  However, I tried to salvage it by turning it into french dip.  I sliced it thinly and simmered it in swanson's beef broth with onion on low for about two hours.  It definitely made the best french dip ever!  So five stars for this recipe, even though I had to tweak it.

Simple and delicious!  I make this every couple of weeks in the fall and winter and my whole, fussy family eats it!  There are 6 of us, and I actually rate my dinners out of 6 - so, if 6 eat it, it's 6 out of 6!!!  This recipe is a 6/6.

I will definitely use this recipe again. It was the first time- this roast came out tender and perfect for me. I took it out at 135 and let sit for about 15-20 minutes and it was somewhere between rare and medium rare which is how we like it and the flavor was simple and fabulous. It was great for sandwiches the next day as well. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!

It was an easy recipe and a great way to cook an expensive cut of beef.  Thank you to the reviewer who reminded us that dry cooking is for the expensive meat and crock pots are for the less expensive.  I have been confused about that.

To make this roast a 5 star, completely pack it in Kosher Salt.   Pour complete box of salt in bowl, add a few tablespoons of water, mix and pack the bottom of roasting pan the size of the roast and about 1/4 inch thick, place roast on top of packed salt and continue to pack the salt all around the roast until roast is completely covered.  When roasted per thermometer, remove roast from oven, and let stand 5-10 minutes (roast will continue cooking while standing so you will want to take it out  about 5 degrees before reaching  desired temperature); remove course shell of salt and slice as desired.  No salt taste in the roast; very, very juicy and tender.   I use rib roast which is a little more expensive, but you can do this with any roast.

This has a really good flavor for sandwiches.  I wanted to add some liquid as one reviewer mentioned.  Had no beef broth, so I dissolved 1 bouillon cube in 1 cup water and added to pan.  I'm so glad I did.  This made a delicious juice to drizzle over the meat.  Please note: When you cover with foil at the end, your roast will continue to cook.  Mine overcooked, and it had registered rare on the thermometer before it sat covered with foil.  Next time, I'll keep this in mind and undercook it.

This was a very easy recipe to follow and I would recommend it if you're looking for a tender sirloin tip roast. I did add worchestire sauce as another reviewer suggested and it did add some flavor. I would add some salt to the recipe too. My husband and children really liked it and kept asking for more! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Pretty good roast, but I think I will continue to use my usual method.  Instead of just black pepper on the roast, I slather dijon mustard over the entire roast and coat the mustard with Montreal steak spice.

I have made this many times and it always turns out good. This is NOT a crock pot dish, that's called pot roast. This should be cooked with dry heat. I find that it is comes out best if you take it out of the oven when the temperature reaches 140 degrees. It comes out pink, tender and tasty. Slice it thin against the grain and you will love it. I make it with oven roasted potatoes and au jus.

The problem with sirloin tip is that it's wildly unpredictable. One sirloin tip can be tender while the next can be as tough as shoe leather. This recipe would work well with a tender roast, but not with a tough one. I found it was also rather bland.

This method made my roast very flavourful. After I thought it was "done" my boyfriend wanted it done a bit more since it was still pretty red in the middle. I put it in for another 15 minutes and it was completely brown in the middle. It was firm, and slightly overcooked, but I attribute that to the cut itself. It may have been freezerburned. But regardless of all that, it was still very tasty because of the garlic cloves and salt and pepper. Had it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. And it was just as good the next day. Anyone who complains about this recipe needs to get their head checked--beef can be pretty temperamental to cook. Great recipe, and thanks for sharing!

This roast turned out very nicely. I used a little more garlic than called for because it sounded good. I skipped the part about cooking at 400, I just cooked the whole thing at the lower temp and it came out fine.

Sticking sliced garlic in slits of the roast was a favorite method of my grandmother. In addition, though, she would add lots of garlic powder and approx a cup of beef broth in the bottom of the roasting pan. It made for a wonderfully moist, tender and flavorful roast. I followed this recipe to the letter without my grandmother's touches and have to say that I got a less flavorful and dry roast. This could have been due to my particular cut of sirloin, freshness, etc. Thank you for sharing your mom's method with us, Kate. I'm going to try this on a bottom round next time. They tend to me juicier and more flavorful than a sirloin tip.

Tried this last night and the recipe produced the tenderest, juciest sirloin tip I've ever made. I was very happy with the results and can't wait to get to the leftovers.

This came out beautifully.  I used more garlic cloves because we love garlic with pepper and poured the Worcestershire sauce over the top.

Excellent but the directions for cooking this will leave you willleave you with a well-done, dry roast.  I used a 7-Bone Chuck Roast and pulled it out when it read 120 on the therometer and let it rests for 15 minutes before carving.  Much more tender and the garlic doesn't burn!

This turned out very well. I usually have bad luck with roasts.  I will try this again and maybe cut cook time a bit so its a bit more on the med-rare side.

Try adding some partially boiled potatoes around the meat. (Boil, then simmer potatoes in a pan for 7 minutes, drain then shake pan to fluff them up.) Place potatoes around meat. Check & turn half way through cooking.  This is what the Brits do for a delicious roast meal, yummy.  Pat

Very good. If you don't need to feed 6 people, remember you can ask the butcher to cut you a smaller piece. The 3.25 lb. piece I bought was $14, and my family of 2 adults, 3 elementary aged kids, will not be able to eat it all. Excellent and simple.

This was a good recipe, but I will make it in the crock pot next time.  I added some salt, worstechir sauce, and some gravy masters.  Then I added a bit of beef broth to the pan to make a nice gravy for mashed potatoes.  My daughter asked for seconds and she never does that :)

Wonderful.  Used a 2 pound roast but the same amount of garlic.  It had a wonderful flavor.  I was hoping for a few leftovers for a sandwich but it was gone.

Used a little extra garlic and pepper, and added a small, sliced onion and chopped potatos to the pan.  Then covered in foil and roasted on the grill, over indirect heat.  Added about a cup of water to the pan and found that unnecessary.  Overall, good flavor, but next time I would add some herbs like rosemary, thyme and marojam.

Very good. I put it in at 350, and for it's last 1/2 hour increased it to 375. It took about 90 minutes to get to 160, which was a bit too well done for us. Next time, I'll set it to turn off at 155, and let it keep cooking as it rests on the counter.

I did marinate it with Worcestshire sauce as others suggested. Slices of garlic were a good touch.

I'd make this again. It wasn't outstanding, and it produced little in the way of pan drippings, fyi.

Good, solid recipe; I wasn't sure what to do with this meat I'd had in the freezer. After all this, my husband still slathered it in Heinz 57. Aaaaargh!

good flavor, but tough as shoe leather. I left it on 400 for an hour instead of 20 minutes, which I'm sure had a little to do with it, but I don't believe it would have made that huge of a difference.

The recipe was good, but not exceptional.  Granted, my roast turned out rubbery and dry, but I probably cooked it too long.  I also think the type of roast I used (tri-tip) would have benefitted more from liquid than the dry rub.  I did like to combination of spices.

This came out PERFECTO!  I used one reviewer's suggestion: poured a 1/4 c. worchestershire sauce over the roast, then course salt & pepper.  I was afraid of trying a str, but I'll make this again & again -- thanks!

I'm sorry, this recipe really wasn't the best.  I used tenderizer and it still was a bit tough.  If I ever make this recipe again (and I doubt it) - I would marinate the roast and then rub in LOTS of tenderizer.  I was expecting something a lot better, especially for a pricier cut of meat.

I tried Anyelea's version..bad outcome for me. My veggies didn't cook enough, but the meat did. Thank goodness for the microwave.  Temps might need adjusting on that version. I won't do the one pot thing again. Next time I'll cook the veggies separately, using a little of the drippings for flavor. The meat flavor was wonderful, but basically wasted a lot of money and time on this dinner.  But that's cooking sometimes!  My husband was very gracious though and ate the whole plate.  Bless him.

I rubbed it in salt, rosemary and Worcestershire Sauce then, seared it.
I followed the rest of the recipe up until the length of time on 325.  I kept it in for am extra 20 minutes. 
Sooooo...delicious!!!

TIP:  Keep it in the same pan you sear it in.

We loved the flavor and tenderness of the roast.  I made the roast as the recipe states. I also followed the advice of other reviews  and added a little low salt Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours in my slow cooker, and added some  cut up potatoes and carrots.  While the roast was resting, I used the liquid from the slow cooker to make gravy.

I used a Sirloin Tip roast.   I baked it in my oven at 400  for 20 min., with the Worchestershire sauce,  then decreased the temp to 325 for an hour.  Took it out of the oven to rest for 20 min.   Even though our roast was smaller, (2 1/2  lb) it was very rare (bleeding, I would say.)  Put it back in for another 15 min.   Still very rare.  Waited 15 min.   It was so  hard to slice; the meat was so tough that we could not eat it.   I am going to follow the  person who suggested cooking it again in broth in a slow cooker.   The flavor was good.

I did the same as Julie P. I cooked it in a slow cooker and used 1/4 cup worsteshire sauce. It cooked for 6 hours and fell apart! So tasty!

Great flavour and very tender. I did sear the roast and add a little worcestershire sauce but otherwise I made this as written. This will be a repeat at our house. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Put a few extra spices on it and some yellow prepared mustard. Turned out great, making it again because there were no left overs!

This works usually.
But this last time came out tough!  Tasty but tough!
I roasted it on the BBQ, to prevent heating the house in the hot summer.
When the grill was 500, I put it on, left the 2 lb roast on for 15 min, then turned burners off.   An hour later it tested 130 degrees.  I waited for to rest 10 min.  Will it's a lovely rare, excellent flavor, but tough tough tough, no matter which way I slice it.  

Is there anything I can do for it now, short of crockpotting the thing?

I followed the recipe to the letter.  I've never cooked this cut of beef before, but I won't let the outcome of this recipe discourage me from trying again.  I found it to be flat and tough.  As I type this, I've popped it into the crock pot with onion, carrots, red potatoes, salt and sherry.  I'm letting it go at low overnight, hopefully with better results when I wake up tomorrow.

I have also been using this recipe for years.  I insert lots of garlic into the meet, rub with Aus Jous sauce, then roast for 30 minutes high temp ie 500 degrees for 30 minutes, reduce temperature to 350. Use temperature probe to get to desired doneness but remove from oven before you get to the temp you want.  As it sits, it continues to cook.  Need a good Angus beef roast to start.

This is a good recipe. I've been cooking my roasts this way for many years. The only thing I do a little different is to cut the garlic amount in half, use one package of Lipton dry soup mix with just enough water to make it stay on the roast.

I agree if you want to use the slow cooker buy an inexpensive cut of meat.  We use this for French dips all the time.

Fixed tonight for our dinner.  I really liked it, but it is a bit tough, but not too bad.  I wish I would have put in some kind of sauce like soy or even a little water.  I did put some sliced carrots in with mine, those had a great taste to them.
