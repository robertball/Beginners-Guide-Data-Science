Yummy! This were really crisp and buttery! I followed the recipe except I added chopped dried cranberries and chopped dried kiwi for my Christmas colors. I didn't have any walnuts, so I used pecans. I will definitely save this recipe!

I am a cranberry addict and loved these!  Made the recipe as stated.  Halved some of the cranberries and chopped the remainder to distribute the flavor evenly throughout.  Didn't leave any whole.  Agree that grated orange zest would be a nice addition. Substituting dried cranberries would completely change this recipe from the original. This cookie is a great addition to my collection of icebox cookie recipes.  We keep a couple of rolls of homemade cookie dough in the freezer during the holidays so I can always have fresh cookies on demand. Prevents my husband for eating all of them at once too.

I didn't have cranberries, so I used dried cranberries! Very good! I also froze the dough initially. Took it out a few weeks later, thawed and baked! Excellent!

These cookies were very good, actually better when cool than fresh out of the oven. I had some trouble getting them the right thickness and doneness -- if sliced too thin they burn, but if too thick they stay soft. Also, I stored them in an airtight container and they became very chewy. A little trouble in execution, but they taste very good all the same!

This is a wonderful cookie recipe. A great light cookie with good flavor. I couldn't find frozen cranberries, so I used dried and soaked them for about 30 minutes in a half/half mixture of orange juice and brandy. I dusted the finished cookie while still a bit warm with powdered sugar. I call them Winter Cranberry Cookies!

I might try them next with the fresh cranberries, but I'm wondering if they soften up if not cooked first - will look for others comments about this.

I was a bit doubtful about using fresh (or in my case, frozen) cranberries in a cookie, but they worked so well in these.  My only change was to use pecans instead of walnuts.  These are wonderful cookies - somewhat soft, with just the right amount of sweetness to offset the tart cranberries.  I was planning on drizzling them with icing, but frankly they are perfect as is.  A little orange zest or extract would work well in these, too, and I think I'll try that when I make them again...real soon! Thanks, Gloria!

I thought the fresh cranberry was too tart and did not really make for a great cookie. I like tart and like raw cranberries but this was odd. My cookies also did not bake up crispy and instead were chewy. Not sure about this recipe as it did not work well for me.

Excellent and attractive cookie that keeps well.  I also used dried cranberries.  It's so nice to have a "make ahead" batch when baking several different kinds for the holidays.  Thanks for posting.

Awesome cookie recipe! I love fresh cranberries to added a bit more then the recipe asked for. Another change I made was to add a bit of fresh orange zest to taste! This change put the cookies over the top! Another thing you can do is put some crushed heath bar pieces on top of the cookie while baking! Thanks for sharing! :D

Awesome cookies, refrigerated them over night and just delicious, had to bake them for +5 minutes though. the last roll I rolled it in coconuts and cut it into 1/4" and baked. Turned out delicious.

I thought these were just okay.  Mine were soft and more like a muffin than a cookie.  Not crisp as they are described to be.  My husband seems to enjoy them though.

These cookies are delicious as-is. In my opinion all of the additions people talked about are unnecessary.  If you follow the recipe it turns out perfect! We make these every year at Christmas for my father-in-law. They are his absolute favourite and he says they remind of a recipe his grandmother used to make.

i used too much almond extract because i was making a half batch and overfowed when trying to measure out a measly 1/8 tsp, but i think it worked in my favor (i love almond extract). these tasted so yummy! i thought they would be crispier and was pleasantly surprised by the softer texture. i will definitely be making these again with my leftover cranberries!

Perfect taste (better than Bakery ones). I added whole dried cranberries, and they were great, too.

Delicious!  Looks and tastes similar to a biscotti, though mine came out a bit soft.  These would definitely go really well with a cup of coffee :)

These were very good.  I used dried cranberries and drizzled white chocolate over the top.
