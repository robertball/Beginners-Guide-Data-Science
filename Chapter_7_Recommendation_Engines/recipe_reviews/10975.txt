Only thing I found to be slightly different is that it took the raisin filling only about a minute plus to start to thicken.  I use a gas oven, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  I felt like it needed more liquid, so I fudged and added a 1/4 blackberry wine. ;-)  This is such a hit with the family, I don't think I'll get a chance to try it the right way! Great recipe, thanks!

This cookie was very good but we felt it had too many raisons so I decreased the recipe to 1 1/2 cups raisons and now we are enjoying them often.

I would like to rate this four and one-half stars. The only problem is that the topping comes out a little too dry. I have made them according to the directions. I have made them , adding dried apricots to the raisins..another time, orange marmalade...another, apricot preserves. I just made up a batch , dividing the butter in half with peanut butter. It gave it a nice "light" peanut butter taste ( and I did use the raisin filling. Maybe next time, with the peanut butter, Strawberry Preserves ? )  In place of the raisins, I would try figs...This would be the closest to the old favotite cookies " Fig Newtons".

My Mom used to make this with raisins but I modified the recipe using Ocean Spray craisins instead and added some grated orange rind. I also let them cool completely before cutting into squares...for easier serving.

I made this for a work potluck and it got rave reviews! A really great fall treat! I did modify it a little bit. For the filling, I only used 1/4C white sugar. I used apple cider instead of water, and replaced the lemon juice (which I didn't have) with apple cider vinegar. Also, I used about half golden raisins and half regular raisins and I think it really made a difference! Just sweet enough! Oh, and since everyone said it was getting too crumbly, I sprayed a little apple cider on the base layer after pressing it into the pan. It was still a bit crumbly, but it stayed together enough for people to pick it up with their hands and take a bite. Great recipe!

These are ok but I wouldn't go crazy over them. The bottom/topping was really dry so they're very crumbly and a bit messy to eat. I'll eat them myself but wouldn't serve to company.

Really liked the raisin filling, but did not care for the crust.

I added half-2/3 cupful of crashed walnut and it tasted wonderful. I personally want the dough to be less sweeter, so next time I will use less sugar. But this one tasted pretty great considering it was really easy to make :) Thanks for sharing!

Tasted great, but nothing exciting.  I used half dried cherries, half raisins, which worked well.  They were a little crumbly and overall too much sugar and butter for me, but not bad.

OUTSTANDING!  The whole family loved these!  I did have a bit of trouble getting the raisin filling to thicken (I had to cook over medium, add more cornstarch, and finally add a bit of flour), but I will make these again FOR SURE!

SOOOOO good. Really. I had a bunch of raisins and I made half a batch for my kids to give their teachers. I couldn't keep my hands off them!

mmmmmm.  These are so good!  I ran out of raisins so I used some dried cherries in place of about 1/4 of them.  I also added some wheat bran and used whole wheat flour.  Delish!  My kids and dh love them too.
