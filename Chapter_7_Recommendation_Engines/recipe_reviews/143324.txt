I had these last night at the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament in New Bedford last night - this version is very good, but different than the ones at the "festa", which were in a much browner sauce and tasted like there was no tomato sauce at all. Also, they tasted like they might've been cooked with smoked ham hocks or something, as they had a distinctly meaty flavor but had very little chourico. I liked your recipe very much; I also liked the version at the feast, just wondering what might've made those so different.

Really really tasty, although I made a decent number of substitutions due to various items being unavailable. I didn't have very many fava beans and I subbed in a Mexican chorizo and red chili sauce because my local supermarket didn't have chourico or chili paste available. Served it over rice. Will definitely be making again!

Also see this website if you used fresh beans, like I did: http://chefinyou.com/2009/05/how-to-cook-fava-beans/

I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce. It adds a nice little zip.

This was really yummy. However, the second time that I made it, I used only 1/2 tablespoon of chile paste. :)

This was really good.  Loved the chourico, the flavors blended well and filled the house with an amazing aroma.

The missing ingredient is cinnamon! Just a pinch. My Portuguese family has a recipe very similar to this. You can add baby potatos, too, or sliced hard boiled eggs.

first, thanks for the recipe. it has great flavor!

im not meaning to be critical, and have never had authentic Portuguese food to compare this to! but this didnt turn out like i expected/hoped, so in an attempt to be helpful, heres what ill do next time, and why:

at first i thought there were typos because of the huge amt of paprika, sausage, beans, and onion with such tiny amts of liquid, but others said they made it so i forged ahead. i only had about 2 cups of fresh fava beans so i halved the suggested amt of sausage as well, but quickly realized i still needed the FULL amt of liquid. i even ended up adding at least double the tomato sauce. the cook time is long and without a lid, it comes out as a very thick, chunky 'sauce'. it would be good served over rice, pasta, polenta, or other dry grain base. but as written, it just doesnt make very much (we got  3 servings out of it, though we didnt use full beans or sausage) and IMO wasn't a stand alone meal like i hoped.
