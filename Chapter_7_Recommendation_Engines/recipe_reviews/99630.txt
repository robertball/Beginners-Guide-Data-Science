I've made a lot of recipes from this site in the past and this is the first that I felt warranted an actual review.  Fantastic.  My dinner guests were all raving about it.  I served it over jasmine rice and with a side of cucumber/yogurt/dill salad.  Thank you for this recipe.

I don't know why I listen to recipes when they insist on adding one full cup of water.  If you make this, start with just half a cup first, or else it's too watery.  I also added 5 fresh green chiles for a spicy kick.

Excellent!

I didn't have lemon grass so I substituted lemon peel. I also didn't use as much chicken. Added quite a large amount of fresh green beans instead. Only other change I made was adding less salt.

Next time I think I'll try to skip the step of grinding everything up in the blender to save on clean up. I'll just chop everything fine and see how it goes. It was very good as is, and I think it will also be very good making changes each time I cook it - add more curry powder one time - maybe add thai basil one time....

Thanks!

Great Curry!! Easy and quick! We used a well drained can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. My husband gives this an eight out of ten. We would recommend this highly, we'll make it for friends soon.

I have been dreaming about this dish since we had it over one week ago.  Very easy to make and, even easier to eat.  Next time I will make double, for leftovers!

I've made this twice this week.  I used just over a lb of chicken (instead of 2.25 lbs) and I put the chicken thighs in as is (not cut into chunks). 

I only had grape tomatoes, so I used those.

I also added cauliflower towards the end of cooking and let it simmer, covered for about 15 minutes.  

This is a great recipe. The chicken was so tender and fell apart so easily!! Thank you!!

This was rather involved to make, but the result was well worth it!  With all the spiices, I thought it would be over-whelming, but it was the perfect blend--not one spice dominated the others, and they came together to make a fragrant, spicy curry with just the right amount of heat.  I had never used fish sauce before, so that was kind of scary; but the finished produce did not taste "fishy" at all.  Hubby didn't love it, but he didn't hate it, either.  He said it was different.  Note:  he was basically making it with my help, and he was okay until we added the fish sauce! LOL!  I served it with basmati rice and peas.  I will probably make it again.

Crock pot.  I have used this many times.  My whole family loves it.  I serve it with warmed Na'an.  These days I just throw all the ingredients in the Crock pot and cook on low for 6 - 8 hours.  I puree the onions, tomatoes, water and fish sauce together, my kids won't eat chunks :)

This was an easy but flavourful dish. The family loved it and I will make again. I took other reviewers advice and added 1/2 cup of water and a tin of drained tomatoes. Next time I will add less water. I also substituted lemon peel for lemon grass - not the same flavour at all but the lemon peel citrus note was a plus. Will use lemon grass next time but I didn't have any on hand last night. I also added chopped capsicum, zuchini, shallots and bok choy as I always bulk up the veg content of all recipes.

Made this for the first time. My son is crazy for curry but I have only been brave enough to buy sauces or just make a curry pea rice. 

I am happy to say it is quite good. I agree with other reviews to decrease water to 1/2 a cup and add more as needed. I also used boneless skinless breast.  

I have to admit after I put in the fish sauce my kitchen smelled of dirty feet for a while, to the point I almost didn't put on the rice. But after it all cooked together it was quite yummy. 

We will have again but I will add peas and maybe some cauliflower.

This is really excellent. Spicy but not unbearable and would go great with a yogurt/cucumber raita. I would double the sauce though, definitely not cut back as another reviewer suggested. We didn't have enough to make much sauce at all for the rice.

This was good but not great.  There was nothing wrong with the end result, and I'm not sure what would have improved it (although adding some julienned baby kale/spinach/chard/bok choy at the end boosted the nutritional content).

I just made this tonight. I used about 6 cloves of garlic and added a little more spice. I also did not put in a cup of water, I didn't measure though, I just added a little at a time until I thought it looked good. I ended up cooking some cubed yam and added the whole lot to Roti bread. Really good meal.

This recipe will be part of our weekly rotation and it is so good that my husband asked me to make it whenever we have people over to impress them with the unusual but delicious flavor of a Burmese curry. 
I didn't measure the amount of water used; instead, I just add it little by little until the curry got the consistency I was looking for.

I followed the recipe almost exactly with the following minor mods:
- used pork lard in lieu of corn oil
- threw in lemongrass stalks for flavor
- used slightly less tomato

The recipe was incredible! My three dinner guests LOVED it and raved about it for days. Will definitely make this again very soon.

My  wife and I totally enjoyed this.  I cut the water in half as others recommended however next time I am going to leave out the water altogether as I don't think its really necessary.  There is plenty of liquid from the fresh tomatoes, the juices from the chicken and other ingredients.

Delicious. Very flavourful and great left over too. I used a 1/2 can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping up tomatoes to save a little time, and included this as part of the the liquid content (add less water).   I've made it a couple of times now and really enjoy it.

This recipe is fantastic!  I used lemon zest because I didn't have lemon grass on hand. Also instead of the water, I used low sodium chicken broth. It came out great!

This is a great recipe. Don't get worried while you're making "onion paste" that you're wasting your time on this one. Somehow all the flavors pull together in the end. I've made this several times and I've always added some kind of vegetable to the pot so we have a meat, sauce and vegetable over rice. You can use boneless or bone in thighs with skin removed. I always use a big can of diced tomatoes. Yummy!

I've made this several times, and it's definitely a favorite dish for  my husband and myself.  The only thing that I changed was the full cup of water. If you add a full cup, it's watery. I would definitely stick to half a cup.  It's one of my favorite dishes to make. Thank you for the recipe.

This was super easy and really good flavor after I added more curry powder. I heald back on the cayenne pepper because of my 5 year old grandson but it goes in next time. I will make again.

I'm not a fan of curry but my wife is. She's from the UK and grew up in Fiji so they often had a lot of curry. While making this I thought it tasted pretty terrible, but it was REALLY good when everything was combined in the end. The only thing I didn't really have was fresh lemongrass (only have dried), so I re-hydrated them in the cup of water to pour in. Also didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced and added a pinch of baking soda to cut down on the acidity of canned tomatoes.

I enjoyed this, as did my four kids and wife. Only omitted cayenne since I'm the only one that enjoys really spicy food. Everyone asked for this to be put on the rotation of foods we have often.

Overall, this was a really well rounded dish with a lot of flavor, only some simple ingredients, and easy to make.

My only recommendation is to use half a cup of water.. if you reduce it to a nice sauce, you'll overcook the chicken. I used a full cup but ended up scooping out the chicken to reduce it, then tossed the chicken back in.

I added too much ceyanne or masala spice (i only had chicken masala curry) and so it was a bit hot, and so I tapered it down with some yogurt, and added some salt and chicken bouillon  for more flavor.  I broiled the chicken skins in the oven for a bit, after sauteeing the onions, I blended all the ingredients into a paste  and poured it over the chicken in the crockpot until dinner time.  i may add some peas or potatoes or just rice with it and serve it up .

Fantastic!  This came out really well, and all my guests were impressed.  Like the other commenters, I would halve the amount of water because it can get a little too watery.  My Nutribullet made quick work of the onion/garlic paste.  I also added some chiles for a little extra heat.

This was a delicious dish. I followed the recipe as closely as possible. I used lemon zest in place of the lemon grass. I would make it again, but would cut back a little on the cayenne pepper and substitute a little more curry powder.

So easy to make- I feel like if I make it two more times, it will be memorized. Also- by far the best recipe I've made in a while! I served it with coconut rice and paratha...mmmmm!

This is a brilliant recipe. Easy and delicious. I used 6 large whole thighs, skin removed. I added just a splash of water. It took a bit longer to cook using the whole thigh but I feel it was worth the wait. I did have to pay close attention while it was cooking to keep them from sticking and burning. I think this was due to the fact that I only added the tiniest amount of water. I added extra cayenne to make it extra spicy. I can't wait for leftovers tonight.

we really liked this but think it could have been spicier and a bit saltier.. i only had bone in, skinless thighs so i used 4 of them for 4 servings.. i doubled the curry and the garam masala.. used half the onion (sliced) and didn't blend everything.. just chopped finely.. i used 1/4 of the water and still felt i could have done without.. i used the liquid as broth and threw some spinach in there.. we ate it as a soup and i added some leftover rice to bf's portion.. ty for the recipe

I found the chicken to be wonderful by itself, but the sauce to be lacking. It was kind of bitter. I ended up adding a few tablespoons of yogurt to make it better. For my kids I took the chicken, chopped it up, mixed in yogurt and put it on a pita. That was tasty.

We live where you would never find garam masala so I got a recipe off of about.com  Even with that, I couldn't get the black cardamon that is used in it.  If you follow that recipe you will have a lot left over so be in the mood for Indian food for awhile.  I just left the boneless thighs whole and they fell apart in chunks by themselves after cooking.  This was a really good recipe but I will add about double the curry for our tastes next time.  Thank you!
