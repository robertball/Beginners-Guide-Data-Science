I didn't have half & half available so decided to try this roux based version and it was surprisingly very good.  Leftovers the next day were even better.

GREAT recipe!!! it was a big hitfor the whole family! my dad says it his favorite stew by far... the only thing i changed was i used milk instead of water to make it more creamy. I will definitely be serving this again.

I have made this several time's But change a couple things I use milk in place of the water and add a couple squirts of hot sauce with about 2 qts of oysters instead of one... we love oysters.... just before serving this is how my dad always made it when we were kids.
