Really love these burgers. The hoisin sauce and sesame oil add such a great flavor.

It’s very good!    I didn’t have hoisin sauce so used soy since.   I frayed in peanut oil!    Will make this again.   I did put some patties in the frig overnight and it helped them stay together a little better.

This was a hit at my house, even with my picky eater who won't touch black beans. I subbed in soysauce because I didn't have any hoisin and served them with some BBQ sauce. The leftover quinoa was also delicious. I am thinking of making quinoa this way on it's on to serve as a side in other meals.

I made this with a few changes.  Cooked the beans in spices -not broth and used kidney beans and lentils to mix in a bit more of flavors. It turned out delicious.  My bf two vegetarian daughters loved it.  They took the leftovers home!

Didn't have any Hoisin or sesame oil, but other than that we primarily followed the recipe exactly.  These came out great and were very filling.  Oh, we did use a no salt added chicken broth instead of beef broth, but with onions and a little ketchup they were awesome.  I was surprised by how great the texture is.  Will make a gain for sure.  Way better than store bought vegie burgers.  We served with baked sweet potato fries.     Next time we will likely add some grated carrot, and maybe some bell pepper, or maybe some zucchini.  I think the options are almost limitless.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.
