I made a modification to the recipe.  I used a banana instead of egg because my child is allergic to eggs and milk.  The pancakes came out very tasteful and fluffy, which was a wonderful change to the other recipes I have tried. I will be using this recipe a lot more.
Thanks.

This recipe became my family's favorite breakfast recipe. Without the soda it tastes even better and looks more beautiful. Thanks for sharing!

These were great considering they had no milk ingredients! I decided to leave out the vanilla and almond extract and added 1tsp. cinnamon and a fruit cup of applesauce.I also used regular soya milk instead of vanilla and they turned out perfect for apple cinnamen pancakes!

Have made these twice in the past week, using unsweetened natural flavor almond milk.  Both times I skipped on the oil.  First batch I used AP flour, 1 tsp vanilla, and also added 1 medium mashed banana with chopped walnuts.  Second time, I used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour, and used vanilla/almond extracts per recipe.  All my pancakes can out with a nice light, fluffy, and smooth texture.  Rated 4 stars b/c though they are a good simple recipe, they are a little on the bland side.  And just a tip-as with any pancakes-I do find the fluffyness is effected by how u are mixing the dry ingredients with the liquids.  Do not overmix-combine until just moistened, and it will usually have some small bubbles in the mixure once it sets for a few minutes-do not mix these out-this is what will add in a light texture.

I didn't have any regular milk, so was looking for soy recipe. This is perfect. I will most likely use this as my regular recipe. I did not use eggs or the almond extract. I always use mayo in my pancake so that also took care of the oil. I had to add a little more soy milk, but that could be because I routinely miss measure. I did measure the baking powder accurately. These were perfect. This would make a great dry mix to keep on hand.

These were wonderful.  They were light and airy.  The flavor was perfect and when you left the table you didn't feel heavy and loaded down like after eating most pancakes.  I did use Almond Milk instead of Soy and my whole family LOVED them.  I double the recipe to feed 5 because it said the serving size was for 2 but wouldn't have had to.  We had leftovers.  Will make these all the time.

The batter came out too soupy, so I added 2 heaping tbsp flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder.  They taste just like the store bought mix!  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Suggested variation:
Curdle the soy milk with juice of half of a lemon: this will make it like buttermilk and give it the acidity to make the baking soda fizz.
Given the lemon juice, the baking powder is not necessary (cream of tartar is what gives the acidity to activate the soda, but it also has an unpleasing flavor).  Instead, just use one 1 tsp baking soda.

I used half all-purpose flour and half buckwheat flour, reducing the total to about 3/4 c. instead of 1 c.   This made very spongey pancakes.  I may increase increase the soy milk and/or reduce the baking soda a little next time to have stretchier pancakes.

This recipe made very thick pancakes. The batter was a little thick too, and was a touch too sweet, even using regular soymilk. However, very filling. I made a fruit sauce by thawing some frozen strawberries and blueberries and letting them simmer in a pan on the stove until it thickened and then added some sliced fresh banana. No need to add any sugar or other ingredients. Delicious topping for pancakes

I used Rice Milk instead of Soy Milk, and added blueberries to some and bananas to others.  This is a wonderful recipe to have on hand!

Wonderful!  Will make again and again, as I more often than not have soy milk on hand rather than regular milk, and the pancakes came out great.  The only change I made was to use 1 tsp vanilla extract, and no almond extract (as I had none), and also to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon into the dry mix.  Next time, I'll make this with WW flour and/or blueberries as I'm sure it'll taste great with those subs as well.

Used half WW flour and half AP flour. Regular soy milk. Used chia gel (1 TBsp. chia seed + 1/4 cup water- let sit at least 30 mins. to achieve gel-like consistency) instead of the egg as I am avoiding eggs because of a potential intolerance. Full tsp. of vanilla extract, skipped the almond extract. Dense, but good. Will use only AP flour next time and try bananas as an egg replacement.

I just made these pancakes!  They were very fluffy and as another person said, bland.  However, I like my pancakes a little on the bland side.  I did use whole wheat flour instead and added some cinnamon as well.  They were very good!

Very delicious and made plenty of pancakes. I used 1 tsp of vanilla because I did not have almond extract.  I also use regular soymilk because I am afraid the vanilla would be too sweet.  This will be my recipe since I have milk allergies. Thank you so much!

I was looking for something different and had soy milk in the fridge.  These are really yummy.  I used regular soy milk, because it was all I had.  The pancakes were nutty, a perfect contrast to my favourite cinnamon cream syrup.  (I have no dairy issues, just like the taste of soy milk.)

I had only plain soymilk and these pancakes tasted amazing. Has a texture similar to Mcdonalds pancakes. I told my family after they ate them all that they were made from soymilk ;)

While I made a few variations, only due to what I had on hand, so far, these are the best vegan pancakes I've made/had!!(i doubled the recipe)  The variations I used were to use almond milk/vanilla rice milk instead of soy.  I used 1/2 unbleached all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  I used an egg replacer.  I added ground flaxseed - a couple tablespoons and about a tablespoon of shredded granny smith apple - and, finally a pinch of nutmeg.  The result was fantastic, a nutty and wholesome treat topped off with organic maple syrup.  Super tasty and filling.

delicious.  I doubled and used 2/3's cup wheat flour and 1 1/3 c. white.  Also, soured the soy using 2 T. lemon juice and used half the soda.
Also no almond extract as several others suggested.  Will make again.

These were good but I probably wouldn't make them again.  I used vanilla flavored almond milk instead of soy milk and doubled the recipe.

We try and live a healthy lifestyle so I added 1 cup. bran and ground flax, blueberries. It made the batter thick so I added more soy. I used olive instead of vegetable oil. The boys loves them, better than store bought. I made up

This recipe is really good for those who don't eat milk products. I use half whole wheat flour and half white flour. My wife and I enjoyed them very much together with "Absolute best pancake syrup" by Ingrid. The recipe is exactly enough for a nice saturday morning breakfast for 2 (I used a tiny 5 inch crepe pan).

These are the only pancakes that I make at my house anymore.  I have probaby used this recipe more than 100 times.  I do not add the almond extract, I use turbinado sugar (that's what I keep on hand), and I add cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of cloves.  Even people who have never had soymilk before always love these pancakes.  The soy milk gives them a nice nutty flavor.

The pancakes were fluffy and light.  I liked the almond flavouring, that made it nice.  I did find that the batter was a little bit too thick, so I thinned it with a little bit more soy milk.  The taste reminded me of a butter cake I make a lot but without all the dairy. (which is good because I'm lactose intolerant)  I'll certainly make it again.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I was a bit turned off by the smell of the batter as it cooked....it's probably the soy milk, but not a very appetizing smell IMO.  Thank goodness it tasted better than it smelled.

These were pretty good. They didn't bubble like normal pancakes do, so it was hard to cook them properly. Used regular soy milk (not vanilla) and it was still good. Good alternative to milk.

These pancakes are okay. They did not rise up light and fluffy, but the texture was nice. There was a metallic aftertaste I think must have come from the soy milk.

My first "homemade" pancakes.  And they were good!  The kids loved them.  The batter was a tad too thick but I think that was my fault for nearly running out of milk.  (And I used vanilla soy milk and it was yummy).  I'll def make this again.  Thx!

We were looking for a pancake recipe without dairy since one of our guests isn't allowed to have any.  The first time we made this recipe was exactly as written and is excellent.  The almond extract is a must.  There is a nice hint of almond in the pancakes and it smells great when cooking.  We've also used this recipe with regular milk too because we like it so much.  We use this recipe all the time for pancakes.

These pancakes were pretty good - I definitely didn't miss not having milk - but they also weren't too special. I added a mashed banana and doubled the vanilla, leaving out the almond extract.

This is a really good recipie! I used olive oil and regular soy milk, replaced the almond essance with vanilla, seperated the egg whites to beat them into soft peaks before mixing it all in. The batter was alittle too watery so i added just alittle bit more flour. I had the best pancakes ever! My pancakes bubbled beautifully! I made quite alot of pancakes though, I managed to make 5 big ones. They look just like the ones you see in pictures! taste great with olive butter and blueberry jam! Will only make these from now on!

These pancakes were surprisingly fluffy!  A great way to make pancakes if you only have soymilk.  Next time I will reduce the almond extract by half - I found it to be too overpowering.  I let the batter sit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before using - may also have helped with the fluffiness.

This recipe helped use  up leftover vanilla soy milk, but it was too sweet, lacked personality, and was somewhat spongy in consistency. If I were to make it again, I would halve the amount of sugar called for, and  might also whisk a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar into the vanilla soy milk in a separate bowl and let it sit for a bit before adding it to the other wet ingredients for a buttermilk consistency.

Our favorite pancake recipe.  I've made it exactly as written, and I've also substituted dairy milk for soy.  Both work great.  As with any pancake recipe, you will have to adjust the consistency of the batter to the needs of each individual batch -- it tends to work better for us with the batter a bit loose (wet).  Also, my family is European, and tends to prefer less sugar.  We've made these as blueberry pancakes (just put blueberries in the batter after you put it in the pan, while still wet), and also as banana pancakes( same drill with banana chunks).  With the banana pancakes, we tend to substitute 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat.  The kids love it, and so does my wife.  In-laws and parents, too.

So tasty! I mashed up a ripe banana and used coconut oil and coconut milk.. I had to add a couple extra tablespoons to get the consistency I liked. Really amazing. Throw in some chocolate chips for an extra treat!

These came out really good.  I didn't use baking soda because I didn't know I had any, but didn't miss it.

I used plain soy milk, halved the sugar and vanilla and it was still too sweet. I was looking for an old-fashioned dairy-free recipe. This was not it.

Adjusted this recipe a bit. I didn't have any almond extract so just added some cinnamon. I also used regular soy milk. I increased the flour to 1 cup and 2 tablespoons. For sugar, I split between white and brown sugar. I also added one mashed up banana. Came out really good. We didn't even need any syrup.

This was a hit in our house. Loved the almond flavor in the pancakes.
I reduced the amount of sugar (which I was happy I did!) and served with maple syrup, crumbled walnuts & strawberries.

I tried this recepie because I was out of regular milk.   My picky 13 yr old didn't even know I used soy milk.  He said they were good which is a huge compliment.  My husband knew and was skeptical but  even he liked them.   I will definiely use this recepie again.

These turned out delicious, however I had to throw in some extra flour to get the batter to thicken up.  I also added in some cinnamon for extra flavor.

Excellent pancake recipe! I've tried a lot of pancakes recipes on here and this one was the best. I'm personally allergic to milk AND eggs so I substituted the eggs for a banana like a reviewer suggested and they tasted great! They had a hint of a banana taste which I loved!

These are just wonderful!  They have replaced my standard recipe for pancakes, and my family asks me to make them just about every weekend.  I cook them in an electric skillet and run a cold stick of butter around before pouring any batter just to get a crisp edge on these.  Very light and fluffy with just the right combination of flavors so that no one thing overpowers any other.  I've added blueberries, chocolate chips, and bananas (with cinnamon and nutmeg) all with great results.

Finally a recipe I can make with my son's vanilla soymilk!!! The taste was amazing, even my picky hubby thought so! The combo of almond & vanilla was perfect, they aren't the fluffiest of pancakes, but I like'm more dense anyways! 2 Thumbs up from this family!

Very quick, easy and fool-proof recipe for pancakes.  Flavor is great and they come out light and fluffy.  I gave 4 stars only because I was looking for pancakes that sop up the syrup and are a little heavier.  I would make this again.

Thank you so much! Cooking for severe milk allergies can be tricky and this recipe is great. It has become our standard Saturday morning breakfast- for variety, I sometimes add 1/2 a grated apple and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. The apple goes great with the nutty flavor of the soy milk.

I doubled the recipe and then added a pint of strawberries and 1 banana.  They were absolutely FABULOUS!!!  I was ecstatic to find a recipe with soy milk instead of dairy.  We rarely use milk for anything and do not keep it in the house.  THANKS FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE!!

When you don't have milk this will do. Pancakes were very flat. Perhaps even more baking soda. Consistency was good though unlike an earlier reviewer who said it was too soupy. I used unsweetened Silk soy milk (unflavored) so perhaps the brand of soymilk affects the consistency.

I made these because I didn't have any milk and didn't feel like running to the store. These are fantastic! I think this will become my new pancake recipe.  Thanks!
