I modified this recipe: I used 1/2 c corn syrup 1/4 c sugar and 3 t of reg butter and 1 tsp of vanilla with the new cinnamon cheerio cereal. I didn't use a thermometer but I brought the sugar butter and syrup to a boil and cooked for about 4 min. I would have liked slightly thinner cereal bars and next time will use a 9x13 pan instead of the 9x9. I pre-cut into bars when they weren't completely hardened then put them in the freezer to quicken the set time and it made it super easy to cut and eat out of the fridge!

Once the corn syrup reached the appropriate temperature and I removed it from the heat it hardened up almost instantly. After fighting with it and FINALLY getting it in the pan to set it was never in there great but whatever right. Well when we went to taste it it was rock hard and even the pieces that you could get in your mouth stuck to your teeth so bad there was no eating instead you spent the next 5-10 minutes trying to scrape this stuff off your teeth. So was not worth the time or effort to make this. Sorry!

I tried to make this without a candy thermomator and it didn't harden at all. Unless you are used to making things with corn syrup I suggest using a candy thermomator.

I also didn't use a candy thermometer. They didn't harden or set up at all. They were sticky but tasted pretty good
