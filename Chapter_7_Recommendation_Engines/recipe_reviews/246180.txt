I made this and added greek yogurt to it to thicken it up. I would like to make it again but cook the onions a bit to tame the sharp flavour. Oh and adding a bit of dill to the top was a great added flavour.

I wanted something just a little different and this was it! I did add extra heat to it and it was just the right touch. Amazing  with chicken wings!! Poured over rice and with spring rolls. Will definitely make this again.

I made this an another very similar recipe on the same night. I preferred this one better but I did like the flavor the chili powder added to the other recipe so I added some here too. I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like traditionally but I'll say that it sure was good.

I made this per recipe and it was not good. It tastes like spicy onion. It also lacks any classic Indian flavor. I thought I could improve it somehow but the onion base is just overpowering and cannot be improved. I do not recommend this.
