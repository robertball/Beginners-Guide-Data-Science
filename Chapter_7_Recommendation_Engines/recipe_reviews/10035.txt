Pumpkin has a high water content which makes it puff up like a cake. I have found that if you place the canned pumpkin in cheese cloth or a paper towel and ring off some of the excess moister then the resulting texture will be more cookie like

This cookies was very much enjoyed at a Halloween fest. Since the recipe uses brown sugar, it is not too sweet. However, the cookie is quite "springy", and it would be best to flatten or spread out the dough on the cookie sheet prior to baking (then they won't look like orange "rocks").

This recipe turned out well and my co-workers loved it when I made it for 
Halloween. I would describe this more as a "drop muffin" than a cookie.
The tip about "ageing" the cookies a day is right on the mark.

These cookies were excellent, especially because I enjoy a really cakey sort of cookie. I made a few changes in the recipe: substituted butter for shortening, applesauce for eggs (1/4 C per egg), and chocolate chips for the nuts and raisins.

Great recipe for not-so-sweet cookies. The only modifications I made were using butter (melted) instead of shortening and egg product instead of eggs. The cookies didn't puff up very much and tasted great.

These turned out great and I EVERYBODY loved them! They are more like cakes than cookies, but thats what I liked about them. I omitted the nuts and raisins and once they had cooled, I drizzled a little bit of milk/powdered sugar frosting on them. Loved them! Will definitely make again!

Great cookie. I made 2 batches. 1 gluten free and 1 regular. I also made with raisins and 1 batch with craisins...were both good in their own right. So go with what you prefer. I did also double the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1/4 tsp. cloves and ginger. Next time will use less cloves and ginger. They are more cake like but have a nice slightly crisp crust. I will be making these from now on! Great GF option!

Cookies stayed nice and fluffy and soft even the following day! I added cream cheese frosting to my cookies at my daughter's request and they went fast! The recipe makes a lot of cookies.

These cookies were good but I think they need a little more spice.  I would add maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

This was a nice snack; not too sweet.  I added quick oats to help absorb the "water" from the canned pumpkin and that seemed to help.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I did not care for this recipe. The reviews say it's good but it's not! Tastless and doughy! I kept on thinking they were undercooked! I was very disapointed.

These are the best.......I add raisins.  They stay soft and don't stay around long because everyone eats them like they're going out of style.

These were good. But it's definately something you make when you want that sort of thing: it's not a cookie for every occasion. I ommitted the raisins and chopped nuts.

Very good, very cakey cookies. I added more raisins, doubled the spices, and added some cloves and ginger too, also used a whole (15oz) can of pumpkin. They are soft and puffy and delicious. I made them with Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free baking mix, and they were great! Frosted them with cinnamon cream cheese frosting, and I love them!

As written, they are very bland.  The texture is great though.  I threw away the entire first batch and am cooking a second batch with double the spices and some pumpkin pie spice.  I also added some salt and honey.  We will see...

first of all i have to say i didnt have a can of pure pumpkin, so i used 1 30 oz can of ready to use pumpkin pie filling by libby's brand.  Half of the vanilla extract, and only 1/2 c brown sugar.  PERFECT!  GREAT TASTING COOKIE!  First pumpkin cookies ever made and will stick to this recipe every time.  Tastes half pumpkin pie half pumpkin bread, perfect cake like cookie!

i used to have a recipe that was from what i remember, exactly this recipe. i lost it over the years and then a little before halloween i thought 'gee i'd like to have those cookies again after all these years.' so i came on here and found waayy too many recipes. so i looked them over one by one and decided this one was IT. it is! i made them and i love them they turned out perfect!! when i was eating them my baby (abouth 8mths then) looked at me as if he were starving, so i broke off little pieces and shared. he loved them too! tonight i altered this recipe and made him his own batch (which i'll post as its own recipe called baby pumpkin cookies) they turned out great too. i searched this site and couldn't find any cookies made just for  babies. so now there will be one recipe.

I love this recipe because it's not too overwhelming with sugar.  I spread the mixture on a cookie sheet and make bars out of them.  I also sprinkled powdered sugar and cinnamon over the top.

First of all these are more like muffins or moist bread than a cookie. Don't get me wrong they were great, but not what I was looking for. I was looking for a traditional cookie. However I ended up eating them at breakfast since the raisins and brown sugar are subtle and go well with coffee and the whole family enjoyed them. I will keep this recipe.

This is my first time making pumpkin cookies. I thought the texture was nice, but I would add in something to sweeten it up a little more.

I used parkay instead of shortening I had no raisins or nuts so I used currants.  I have pumpkin frozen so I use that.  Always a little different.  Everyone loves them

Some of the best cookies I've eaten.  I made a few substitutions though. I only had 1 cup of pumpkin, so used that and 1/2 cup applesauce. I substituted Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour. I put in 1/2 cup raisins and 1 cup chocolate chips. I doubled the amounts on the spices and an additional 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. The texture is still rather muffin-like.

I would describe the texture as that of a fluffy pancake. I doubled the spices as recommended and am glad I did, they are not very sweet. The nuts and raisins were omitted due to allergies but I think they would have added a lot. I sprinkled the hot cookies with cinnamon/sugar mixture. I didn't have quite enough shortening so I used a small cup of diced pears, drained (I was out of applesauce.) It didn't affect the recipe. The batter wasn't
 at all watery. 

I made them for book club and everyone loved them and my boys loved them. I thought they were ok. I'm looking forward to trying them again tomorrow with coffee.

Not the best I've ever had.  Maybe tomorrow they'll be better?  I took the advice of another reviewer and let some of the moisture drain off the pumpkin, but they were just not that tasty....even tho I used cranberries and pecans in them, which I love.  they LOOK great and the texture is perfect....but not a keeper.

I've made slightly different versions of this in the past few years. I liked this recipe, however I did substitute the shortening for butter just fine, I also added a few more spices (i.e. all spice) and left out the raisins. They were terrific!

Great recipe.  I drained my pumpkin first (like the other reviews suggested) and substituted craisins and pecans for the raisins and walnuts.  Tasted great.
