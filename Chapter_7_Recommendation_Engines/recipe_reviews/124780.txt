I can't really review the brownie recipe, but the idea of the white frosting and melted chocolate spider web on top was great!! I *gasp* was lazy and made brownies from a box, but I used the white frosting and melted chocolate idea for the top, and it turned out great!   

For melting semi sweet chocolate over the stovetop (double boiler method), you can't get the chocolate too hot.  I did at first and it was one gelatenous glop of melted (but not melted enough to drizzle) chocolate... I kept heating and stirring and couldn't figure it out!!  I called my father-in-law-to-be, a baking guru, and he said to take the chocolate off the heat and keep working it... and it worked!  The tiny hole in the corner of a bag worked great too (but not with the goopy too-hot chocolate--that just bust right through the side of the bag!)  

Next time, I'll make the brownies from scratch too! :)

I don't think these brownies get a lot of credit.  They're wonderful.  I did 2 things different than the recipe.  First, I did a very thin layer of marshmallow cream.  We're talking maybe 3 tablespoons.  Also, for the spiderweb design I used 2 squares of semisweet chocolate and maybe 2 tablespoons of whipping cream.  The cream keeps the chocolate smooth for a long time allowing you to create the spider design.  Just a tiny little corner in a plastic freezer bag did the trick for me while squeezing down from the top of the bag.

I had some problems with these brownies. First, I wouldn't use aluminum foil under them again while baking because after they cooled and I tried to move them to a tray, the brownies fell apart, it just became a mess. Also, I found the melted chocolate was too thick to adequately design the spider web. Next time, I would add a little milk or water. The flavor of the brownies was pretty good, though.

This is a good recipe. The topping is a bit sticky so you have to be careful about it is covered. Also it can be sticky when you eat it - but it is a good change up from regular brownies.

The brownies were a little too fudge-like for my taste, and too sticky with all that marshmallow on top.  Good in idea, tastes okay, but not very practical.

These turned out great, but like the others, I used a box mix and will try the cake recipe next time!  I do want to say, I do not know how the other users say it was super messy and disaster gooey... I followed the instructions of putting the marshmallow on right away, and I waited a few seconds for it to heat up, and then I spread it carefully.  It was not difficult at all.  Then I let it cool for about 15 minutes before cutting.  The marshmallow had cooled a little bit and did not go all over the place like I was imagining!  They cut perfectly and were not a mess to eat.  Do not let other reviews keep you from trying this!

The idea is great. I made the brownies, which I went to spread the marshmallow creme over the brownies & it tore the brownies up. It mixed the brownies & the fluff. Maybe warm the marshmallow creme first & maybe it would've worked better. I didn't finish since the design would not have come out. Very dissappointing.

Overall, I like the idea of decorating brownies with spiderwebs for Halloween, so I tried making these for my Girl Scout troop.  I used a box brownie mix, so I can't speak on the brownie recipe. I did use the marshmallow icing idea. While they tasted great, it was nearly impossible to cut and make. The marshmallow was way too sticky and made it very difficult to cut.   Next time, I would probably just use regular white icing instead of marshmallow.

It was too gooey and I did not care for this at all. And it didn't taste all that good either.  I tried this a few times and each time had the same results. Sticky gooey and a huge mess.

I find the marshmellow doesn't go well with the brownie.  While more conventional, replacing the marshmellow cream with powdered sugar makes for a much better brownie!
