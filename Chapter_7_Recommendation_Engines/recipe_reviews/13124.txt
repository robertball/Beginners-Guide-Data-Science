As I native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, I can authenticate this recipe.  My mother prepared posole every year for New Year's Day, and her posole was very similar to this recipe.  The pork rinds and feet make it authentic, but you can omit these ingredients for ease of preparation.  If you have trouble finding red chili, try www.buenofoods.com - a popular New Mexico Chili retailer.  My mother made a huge batch of milder posole, but served extra red chili sauce on the side so people could adjust the spicyiness to their taste. You can also slow-cook posole in a large crockpot for 6-8 hours until the porkloin falls apart.  Posole is sooo good on a cold winter's day.  If you love spicy food, chili or the unique flavor of red chili, you should try this dish.

the rciepe calls for canned hominy then gives directions for fresh hominy that you have to cook till it pops. If you use the canned you do not have to cook it till it pops. It is already cooked. You can use eithe, the fresh tastes better, but takes longer.

As a native of Ireland, I can't authenticate this recipe!  Ha!  Now having said that, I loved the strong pork flavour this stew had.  I thought it was fantastic.  The only qualm I had was that they did not specify the type of chili.  I used anchos, and felt it was not hot enough.  Other than that, this was amazing.  It will also convert people who normally don't eat grubeen (pig's feet), as it imparts much of the amazingly unctious flavour found here!

Excellent posole!  Like the other reviewers, I didn't know what kind of chilies would work so I used what I had -- dried Guajillo peppers.  I bought a bag of them at the grocery store and they've worked wonderfully for many recipes.  I have used 6 and it worked -- just make sure that you remove the seeds because they stay "crunchy" and HOT in this recipe.  Also, try to use "Mexican oregano" if you can find it.  I am going to add a small tin of green chilies next time I make this for extra zing.

I cooked this for my my fiance and his uncle because their from mexico they thought I was crazy for trying.  But they were very impressed with me they loved it so much they ate it breakfast luch and dinner until it was completely gone.  This is a very authentic dish.  I served it with tortillas, chopped onions, cilantro, and lime wedges. Also I would definetely add the can of tomatoes for flavor.

Wonderful dish for a cold day or any day! I added a small can of El Pato sauce instead of the tomatoes and omitted the feet. Also I blended a cup of the hominy with the softened chilies and garlic and added it to the soup. I topped it with shredded cabbage, lime, onions and ate it with tortillas...YUMMY!

I used this recipie to refresh my memory when re creating my mother in laws posole. This reminded most of hers although I did change several things using indredents I remember her using. First was the meat. She puts this pork called espinaso which you can find in you hispanic market @the the meat counter. And we also add a few skinlesschicken thighs and I put just a small abount of pork sholder (about half a small roast &a I freeze the other half for next time)  I do this because I am not a fan of meat w/everyweek bones and fat and all that ( I call it creepy meat lol) I use either dried California chilies or New Mexico Chilies she says they're basically the same but the New Mexico are sort of a better quality although I believe they're the same price. I serve it with thinly sliced radish rounds, chopped cilantro & white onion, shredded cabbage, lime wedges and we eat it with sliced birrote (the mexican bread you use to make tortas)

I love posole!  I use the dried chiles, and added a couple bay leaves also.  Top with cilantro, limes, onion, lettuce, and of course hot sauce!  Yummy.

Unique recipe.   The picture shows the proper garnish of cabbage and radishes, even though they are not mentioned in the recipe.  Alas, there is a lemon wedge and lime always trumps lemon unless you are making cheesecake.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I used pork neck and pig's feet, added some fresh, diced tomatoes and fresh, hot peppers from the garden. I served it with shredded cabbage, fresh onion, cilantro and lime juice. It was a big hit!

This recipe was very plain and not authentic at all. I added Cayenne pepper, cilantro cubes, and more garlic and salt. Taste more better and gives it that spice it needed .

This is a great recipe. I have made it at least 5 times. I made it the first time with pigs feet, but since then have omitted it. It is still very good and I don't use the pork skins . I like using chile arbol and anchos. I put everything together in my large crockpot. After the chiles are well cooked, I remove the stems and any seeds I do not want and the pork pieces.  Then I use the immersion blender until broth is smooth. I add back the pork, then add the hominy. It is much easier for me this way and the pork gets a really good flavor

This is a great base recipe! I added and removed a few things based on mine and my husbands tastes(he is from Mexico). I didn't have any pigs feet on hand, although I will try adding them next time. I also added a packet of Goya Sazón to give it a bit more flavor and red coloring. It turned out great! Will be making this again and again. Thank you!

I hesitated to review, as I made changes. But it was so good, I decided to leave one.  I could not find pigs feet or pork skins.  I substituted a smoked pork neck.  I used the pork loin and cooked as directed.  I had dried corn, from the farmers market, which I cooked until it “popped”  I didn’t have the dried chilies, but I had powder from chilies from a friend(I guessed the amount).  These are significant changes, but I believe the base recipe is a good one.  I look forward to making it again.
