A great winter comfort food. I used chicken tenderloins and doubled the low sodium gravy and mushrooms. The chicken was very tender and there was more than enough gravy for the mashed potatoes too. I also served lemon pepper green beans along side it. It had a nice presentation and the taste was fantastic. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll add just a little more Dijon. We love the stuff. Thanks for a great recipe DebbyJean.

This is a very tasty recipe!  I made Chef John's Chicken Gravy rather than use a prepared gravy, and that was the only thing I did differently.  I didn't even serve this over pasta or rice, but that would definitely be an option, especially using a nutty rice like a wild rice mix or basmati.  This is yummy, and I'd make it again the next time I pick up some mushrooms!  Thanks, DebbyJean!

This was very tasty. I did add a bit more Dijon and threw in some sweet mustard as well.. I used thighs. There was plenty of sauce for the rice. I will definitely make this again.

This was super good and very easy. The only change I made was to add 1 tsp of  black pepper to the flour mix. Thank you DEBBY JEAN!

This is wonderful!  Simple enough to make on a weeknight, but it would also make a very elegant company meal.  The only changes I made was to make the chicken into cubes instead of the leaving the breasts whole as I knew this would make several meals for just me and I used an envelope of chicken gravy as that is what I had on hand.  Next time (there will be a lot of next times) I would make my own gravy with sodium free broth, flour and milk to reduce the sodium content.

We kept the gravy separate because my children do not like gravy. BUT the adults actually preferred the recipe without the gravy. So yummy!

Delicious!!!  This is a wonderful company recipe.  Everyone raved.  I made my own dijon mustard and chicken gravy, making a bit more than the recipe called for, and used dry vermouth for the white wine.  It was spectacular!  This has just become another “go to recipe” for boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Be sure to use fresh mushroom, as the juices REALLY make the sauce terrific!

Very good.  If you have ever had Steak Diane, this tastes similar.  I did not have prepared chicken gravy so I used chicken broth instead and thickened it with more flour.

This recipe was delicious but I gave it four starts because it needed minced garlic to be added when the mushrooms were sauteing.  Shallots would have worked, too.  I only had Hellman's Dijonnaise on hand which is milder than regular Dijon mustard so the recipe might have had more of a kick if I did.  The color of the sauce was light beige so I put in a dash of Kitchen Bouquet to give a richer, more appealing look.  All in all, it's still a nice recipe.

This was just OK. I did not think that the flavors melded well together - they were very separate and distinct. I think it might have been better if I had baked the chicken with the mushroom dijon gravy together, then the chicken would have infused some of the flavors of the gravy.

I needed a quick dinner so I used a roasted chicken from Costco and Trader Joe's pre-made gravy and it turned out great.  Served it with pasta.  My kids loved it!

My whole family loved this! I made it GF with just a dredge of the chicken in GF flour. I added scallions as a garnish which I thought was a nice compliment. Served with GF pasta though I can imagine that it would be great with rice too, as other reviewers have said. I thought about cutting the chicken into strips, but after making it we all liked the cutlets. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

Delicious! A true 5 star! Only thing I added was black pepper and ground garlic to the flour, and then dried minced onion to the gravy. Served this with garlic rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. I love serving well rounded meals where I can sit back and watch my picky 4 & 6 year old chow down...without being hounded to eat!

EASY. This was fine to good. Didn't really notice the chicken gravy recipe within a recipe till I was in. Just added the milk to mushrooms with 1/2 cup  chicken broth and cornstarch  and carried on. It worked well and was good. I would do that again.

It was good , but plain. I had to add a little more salt and onions when I added the mushroom. I do like all the sauce  so I could put it over rice or pasta.

Great dish! A little plain, but still an enjoyable comfort food. I changed just a few things. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces. I also added a bit of fresh sage once the gravy started to simmer. It really complimented the flavors in the dish. I put this over white rice. Next time, I'm going to add a little more mustard and perhaps try a more spicy mustard since I enjoy food with a kick!  If not, a dash of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes might add that extra flavor it seems to be lacking. Will definitely experiment and try this dish again!

Excellent!  This is a wonderful go to dish now for my collection!  I paired this with Jasmine rice & collard greens, which gives a great balance. I will be making this again. The only thing I did different was add onions and I doubled up on the gravy ingredients since I had larger chicken  breast.

Made using very thin pork chops. Added shallot to the mushrooms, and the wine added a nice touch of acidity to the sauce.  Will for sure make again! Well liked around the table!

Made as directed.  Tastes great, but i30 minutes to make it isn't realistic unless stuff is prepared beforehand; cut the chicken and mushrooms, and make sure chicken gravy is ready.  Tried to make some out of a package the same day and that added at least 1/2 hour.  But I repeat, tastes great!!

I had some Dijon mustard about to expire, so I thought I'd give this a try. I'm glad I did. It got rave reviews from everybody. I think the only thing I'd do differently is add more mustard next time. Served this with steamed broccoli and basmati rice. Thanks DebbyJean for such a wonderful recipe.

This was amazing! I love it! The mustard adds great flavor -- I was worried it would be too spicy, but it was very mild! It is really good over pasta, too. (Note: I did substitute flour+chicken broth for gravy)
