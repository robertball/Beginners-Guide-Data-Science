Very good jumping off point.  I think everyone tailors casseroles to their own taste.  In this case, I used small shell pasta (uncooked) instead of rice, milk instead or mayo, less cheese.  Also, to "health it up" a bit, I put a layer of chopped spinanch on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Yummy!  Hubby loves it.  Easy increase and freeze some.

I made this recipe for my family and we loved it.  It was very simple to make most ingredients we all have on hand.  I omited the almonds simply because my husband does not like nuts!  Next time I will probably decrease the mayonnaise by about a 1/4 of a cup and increase the cream of chicken soup by about a 1/4 of a cup.  Other than that it is so delicious.  Great comfort food.  Would be great for a potluck or to take to a sick friend.   Will definitely make this again and again.

This is very yummy!  I made it for a friend who doesn't like any vegetables and had to try it myself.  I followed the recipe, but I cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic just because garlic is so good.  It is very rich and filling.  Since it does have so much fat in it, if I make it for myself, I will use low-fat ingredients.  Also, you could add vegies if you'd like.  Very good and easy recipe!

Very good! I had to substitute some items - used mushroom soup instead of chicken, half the amount of cheddar and left out the almonds since I didnt have any. Next time I will add some broccoli. Easy and very tasty recipe that will go in my permanent recipe box.

This one is a keeper at our house.  My entire family loved it.  We even got my very picky 3- and 5-year-old grandsons to eat some.  I did not deviate from the recipe, although I did use low-fat mayo and sour cream (not fat free) and the 98-percent fat-free soup.  Also, I used one of those Uncle Ben's 90-second packets of rice because it's the exact amount that the recipe calls for, and it speeds things up.  I used the plain white, but next time I'll try a different one, maybe the one with some brown rice in it because I did think the casserole could use a little color . . . it was just so white.  I cooked it in a 9x13 casserole dish.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good.  I cut the mayo like everyone else said to do. It was rich though, and it did need some broccoli in it.  It would have added a bit more substance to it.  I wouldn't make it a lot because it is very fattening.  But it was good to throw together quick and most of the ingredients are the types we all keep on hand.

This recipe was easy to make.  Used my Foreman grill to grill the chicken (bland, need to marinade it) while cooking the egg noodles (instead of rice).  Didnt care for the potato chips on the top.  Next time I may just use seasoned bread crumbs.  I did notice that once this was on the table and served that it was quite dry.  May need to use some milk in the recipe as well.

My family just loved this recipe and I will be using it again. I didn't have mozzarella cheese and substitued with monterey jack. It's quite easy to work with and if you don't have time to run to the store you can switch out ingredients. But you got to keep the chips and almonds in it.

Very tasty!  I didn't have any sour cream - so I just omitted it and hoped for the best.. it was excellent.  All four kids liked it! - they asked for seconds.

This was really good! I did reduce the amount of mayo as other users suggested and used half the amount of cheese. I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic (we love it!)  Very creamy, comforting dish- will be making again! Thank you :)

I'm a college student so actually getting to cook is a rare treat. This was so easy to make and everybody loved it! I used pre-cooked chicken strips from our grocery store to save a little time and money. Next time I'd like to try adding broccoli for a little more color and an extra vegetable.

I've always been a lover of chicken casserole and the many variations of it you find around, which is why I decided to give this recipe a try.  To sum this up in one word?  "WOW!"  My fiance and I fixed this to get rid of some expiring chicken, and I think every-other bite my fiance took he was saying something along the lines of "Mmm, this is good!"  I did make a few minor alterations, however.  We didn't use almonds or potato chips because we didn't have any.  We sauteed the chicken in garlic and butter before adding that into the casserole, and we added a touch of dry mustard powder, onion powder, lemon juice and curry into the mixture.  Talk about good stuff!  We'll definitely be making this again!

This went over great with the kids!  Rarely, do I have 100% agreement from everyone on a dish.  I used lowfat sour cream, cut back slightly on the mayo and reduced the amount of cheese.  I didn't measure my rice, but am pretty sure I added more than 2 cups.  All this made it less rich, and perfectly good!  Oh, I used Co-Jack cheese instead of the mozzeralla, and on top I did both Co-Jack and Cheddar.

This recipe was pretty good. I would definitely add more salt or garlic salt to give it a little more flavor. It was still good but tasted a little bland

I followed the recipe, and no thank you.  I felt like I was eating mayo!  It was just too creamy, not to my taste at all.  My 3 year old wouldn't even eat the topping.  She did try it, but ended up eating a PB&J instead.  I would not try this again even with doctoring...

This casserole is fantastic!  Simple to make, and tastes great!  If you plan on refridgerating some, the chips become a bit soggy.

I gave this 4 stars b/c unlike many recipes out there, this pleased both my 4 year old twin girls and my husband and me. I couldn't give it 5, b/c it did need some doctoring.   Like many other reviewers, I totally cut out the mayo (didn't add more soup as I didn't have any more) and still found it to be plenty moist with much less fat! My kids loved it as is (and I only had to yell once about eating all the chips off the top and not eating the casserole).  My husband and I found it a little bit bland, so for fun we put it on a tortilla with a bit of salsa and thought it was really quite tasty! It was a way for me to make one meal - more basic for the kids, and add a bit more spice for us.  Oh, and the kids had a blast breaking the potato chips into pieces and then sprinkling them on top.  Worth a try!

Very nice, simple recipe! I made a few adjustments. I didn't have enough Mayo so I used Ranch dressing instead which gave it a more tangy flavor. Also added some chopped celery (which I HIGHLY recommend!) to it and subbed small shell pasta instead of the rice.  Came out very nice Hopefully will have a chance to try it as written sometime.  I should have taken a pic of mine since it came out so nice, but I was too hungry :)

It was a very yummy dish!  I followed the suggestions of others by reducing the amount of mayo.  I also reduced the amount of cheese to help make it a little bit more healthier.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Really Great :)  I didn't have mozzarella, so I just used cheddar.  I probably only put in about 2 1/2 cups.  I also put less mayonnaise and more skim milk to make it nice a creamy.  I didn't have chips so I crushed up crackers and pretzels.  I also added some tomatoes and broccoli to add veggies and give it color.   This was very yummy.

I made some changes for a healthier version. I used light mayonnaise, light sour cream, reduced fat cream of chicken soup, 2% cheeses and even baked chips. It was awesome. Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband finally decided to seek out this recipe after years of telling me about one of his chidhood favorites. It was very easy to make and we loved it. I made it very basic, no celery or almonds but still very good!

I agreed with the other reviewers and made a few changes. I used small shell pasta instead of rice (cooked, but al dente to avoid it getting mushy as it cooked further) and added slightly cooked broccoli florets. Instead of the potato chips, I did use breadcrumbs. It was delicious! My family really enjoyed it!  Thanks for submitting it!

This was pretty good!  I did a few changes. I only did 1/4c. of mayo, added a 1/2c. of milk, and Mexican shredded cheese for cheddar cheese. My husband loved it, but we both agreed it could use a few extras, perhaps steamed broccoli or something. I also think next time I'll omit the mayo and just do two cans of cream of chicken. Otherwise, this is a good base recipe to tweak around with to your liking!  Will make again! Thanks!

I ran out of mozzarella and used swiss.  This creamy dish was loved by my entire family, but I personally would have enjoyed some greenery in it, perhaps celery or broccoli?  Either way, everyone loved it.

Too much mayo and cheese for me.  I added some sauted onion and cut back on the mayo to 1/2 cup and deleted the mozzarella.  I put about half of the cheddar and that made a huge difference.  Wasn't nearly as heavy.

This is a great recipe, however based on other reviews, I did change a few things.  I only put in about 1/4 c mayo.  When cooking my chicken, I sliced in thin slices, sauteed in butter with some cajun seasonings and onion.  I used basmati rice, and taco flavored cheddar cheese.  My family loved it and we will definitely have it again!  Thanks for a great idea!

I can't give this ONE star because I used fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream and left out the almonds. But I would not have thought those changes would yield the dry, tasteless casserole that resulted. I am not going to try this one again.

Very good recipe! I used a little less mayo (since other reviewers said it tasted a little "mayonnaise-y" otherwise). I also used cashews instead of almonds and crushed butter crackers (garlic & herb flavor) on top instead of potato chips. I also threw in some garlic powder and pepper to add a little flavor to it. It could even use a bit more spice, but my husband loved it!   The crunch from the crackers and cashews was just delicious with the creaminess of the rest of the casserole. We will definitely make this again!

This was very easy to make and with stuff you probably already have on hand.  I didnt have the almonds, but used brocculi.  Maybe it would have been better with the almonds, but it wasnt bad at all.  Thanks!

My 8-yr-old son LOVES this recipe and asks for it frequently! That's quite a feat considering he's a picky eater. I know it's not the healthiest, but I use reduced fat soup, only half the cheese and brown rice. No one in my family knows the difference and I feel a little bit better about serving it to them. Easy to put together and freeze an extra recipe, too.

My family didn't like this. My husband said that it tasted too much like mayonaise as did my daughter.  I just thought that it should have called for more rice and more chicken. It was too soupy for me.

This was really good.  I used milk instead of mayo and pasta instead of rice as a few other people mentioned.  I meant to add a little hot sauce to it but forgot and it was a little bland.  I will definitely make this again.

We loved this one. I did make a few adjustments. I added a cup more rice and a little less mayo. I used cream of broccoli instead of cream of chicken and since I was out of cheddar cheese I added a broccoli and cheese steamer I had. I just microwaved it while the rice cooked. I also used ritz crackers and some Italian bread crumbs instead of chips. It was perfect.

Good base recipe .  Subbed cream for mayo.  Subbed Ritz crackers for chips.  Bottom layer spinach.  Added granulated onion for flavor.  Still really bland.  Needs additional herbs, spices,etc.

I followed the recipe to a T except for the almonds (I'm allergic to tree nuts). It was just okay. I think it needed more but I can't put my finger on it. I also added salt and pepper because it was so bland.

This was pretty good, but the ingredients listed sounded pretty bland, so I 'spiced' it up a little. Instead of chicken soup, I used broccolli and cheese condensed soup, added a pkg. of Steamer Broccolli and used pepperjack cheese instead of mozzarella, I added 1/2 green apple, finely diced, used 1/2 milk and 1/2 mayo. I also used Uncle Bens brown rice with chicken seasoning. And finally, topped it with crumbled sour cream and onion flavored ruffles potato chips. I took the advice of another member and cooked my chicken pieces in olive oil and roasted garlic seasoning. Everything else was just as the recipe called for. My husband and I really enjoyed this, thanks for the basic instructions. I will make this again!

This was very good.  I did not have almonds, so I  didn't use them.  I also added a bag of frozen california blend vegies to "healthen" it up a bit.  Didn't have chips, so used buttered cracker crumbs.

This casserole was pretty good, but mine turned out a bit dry.  I would definitely recommend seasoning the chicken as you cook it before putting it in the casserole.  It was a bit bland.
Also, I cut the mayonnaise in half.  Next time, I'll use another can of cream of chicken soup and add some broccoli.

It was a good dish, but very cheesy.  I put in a little salt and pepper and some onions to cut back on the cheesiness, but I think that I might reduce the amount of cheese next time or add in more chicken or veggies.

My husband and I both thought this casserole was delicious! It is a rich and very filling dish. The only downfall was in my opinion that the dish had too many potato chips, I would recommend cutting the potato chips from 2 cups to about 1 1/4 to maybe 1 1/2 cups. I found that the 2 full cups made the dish a little greasy. I also did not add the almonds to the casserole, just because almonds in a casserole did not sound to appealing to me. Overall this was a great dish to make, just not too often because of all the fat and calories!! :)

DELICIOUS!  My family loved it - even the picky one!  I didn't have any sour cream, so I used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup.  Turned out great!  Best part - NO LEFTOVERS!!!

This is good, but I agree with previous reviews that it is very rich!  So rich that I served it over rice even though there is rice in the casserole.  I used low fat sour cream and mayo and omitted the almonds.  I topped it with kettle style chips (put in a baggies and crushed with a rolling pin).  I think the topping might have been better with plain old Lay's potato chips, but then again it was a little salty, so keep that in mind.  Overall my husband and guest enjoyed it, they referred to it as comfort food.  I was the only one who thought it a little heavy.  Give it a try!
