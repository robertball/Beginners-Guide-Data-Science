The dressing on this is good but I would add more cabbage/veggies.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I think red cabbage would also be good.

This also gets better as it "ages." I used a vidalia onion one time I made it and a red onion another time. It can get a bit runny but it doesn't matter. Just pour it off. The red onion makes it a bit stronger so I used less of it than the vidalia. I also added pineapple tidbits for a really nice flavor. Don't omit the celery seed because it adds the nicest flavor of all.  It is my favorite coleslaw recipe and I always get raves when I make it.

Great recipe!  Just made it for a family gathering to go along w/ shredded bbq.  Everyone loved it! Never heard so many  compliments on a slaw recipe.  My only change was to sprinkle a little bit of ground red pepper to add some spice.  Perfect!  Thanks for sharing.

Very good! I always substitute plain yogurt for mayo and it turned out great!! I did a "lowfat" plain yogurt and not the "nonfat" so it wouldn't be too runny and everyone loved it.

The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the suggestion to pour the dressing over the veggies and marinate over night.  My veggies were soggy, especially the cabbage.  So not good.  Now, flavour wise this recipe is a hit!!!  Add more mayo though, it's too watery.  Still yummy and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks.

This is simply the best slaw recipe I've found. It's the perfect blend between sweet and tangy.

Fresh - light!  Easy to make and tasted delicious with my homegrown Parsley.  I actually didn't have enough pepper - so I used a half red pepper - worked out great.  I also liked this recipe because it didn't call for a bag of slaw mix - I used a fresh head of cabbage.  It will be  our picnic staple - the family loved it!

This was perfect for what I needed. I used half a package of broccoli slaw and a quarter package of matchstick carrots. I also used nonfat milk and reduced fat mayonnaise. Because we don't like green peppers, I used all red pepper and instead of celery seed and salt I used a scant half teaspoon of Beau Monde seasoning. GREAT for at home Primanti Bros. sandwiches!

Made it to serve with pulled pork. Shredded green and red cabbage together to equal 1 lb. Followed the rest of the recipe except I omitted the poppy seed. Very good!

I didn't add carrots, green onions, or parsley but it was still really good.  Next time I'll make sure I have all the ingredients - I'm sure it'll be even better.

This slaw is awesome, and the homemade dressing is tangy and delicious! My guests gobbled it up! I adapted it by using Miracle Whip.

This slaw has a lot of ingredients, but they are blended so perfectly, it's worth the effort.  My in-laws love this recipe, which is good news because the MIL is such a great cook!  The peppers make such a delightful color, and also a great crunch you just can't get from the cabbage and carrot alone!  

I would set aside double the time unless there are two of you chopping veggies, though.  Julienne takes awhile to do correctly.

I've had a difficult time finding a slaw recipe that both my hubby and me agree on. This was a real winner. While I did leave the onions out, I added red and yellow peppers, sliced thin and then chopped, it was DELISH!  Would make this over and over. I used buttermilk made from powder and it worked just fine. YUMMY!

Excellent!  I recommend using a sweet onion, if you have one.  I added a chopped mango and a couple shakes of smoked paprika to the slaw and served with smoked pork loin and seasoned oven fried potatoes.  This is my new favorite recipe for cole slaw.  Thanks for sharing.

This is terrific.  Just know, that if want your slaw to resemble the photo, you are going to have to hand slice EVERYTHING....I guess, unless you have a really precision food processor.  I started to use a regular hand grater, and it made it so tiny like fast food slaw. You need bigger pieces  for the colorful  effect.

This was perfect!  It really needs about 10 hours to sit so the cabbage isn't too harsh.  This is my new potluck staple!

Delicious!  I didn't have any white sugar so I used brown sugar instead.  And I substituted half and half for buttermilk. I also added broccoli and omitted the white onion and green pepper. It came out great- tasted very fresh and healthy.

I'm not a huge fan of slaw, but really like it on pulled pork sammies. The hubby LOVES slaw and says that this is one recipe has one of the best dressings he's tasted! I also add it to a pre-made slaw, just to save time.
