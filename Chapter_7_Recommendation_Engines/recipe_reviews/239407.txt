OMG this was amazing! We have been enjoying grilled Brussels sprouts all summer but decided to try something different today. Unfortunately my husband did not grill these long enough. They were a bit too crunchy for me. That being said they were still delicious! I did use a combination of salt pepper and garlic powder. I will definitely make this again and I suggest everyone try this!

Prepared as directed. The char on the beans and onions was delicious! Going to be a staple on my grill.
