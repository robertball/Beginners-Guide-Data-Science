very yummy!  didn't get 4 servings, unless it was supposed to be a side item.  also, i'm not a fan of the whole dish being the same color, so i added some chopped fresh parsley.  the flavors were good & it was super easy!  i will be making this again.

Good flavor but my can beans never got crisp. In fact, they turned to mush as I expected they would. Canned beans hold too much moisture and are already too soft to pull any kind of "crisp" off. Like I said, the flavor is good but I think the only way to pull this off successfully is to cook up some dried beans beforehand, under cook them a bit, and let them drain really really well before you ever begin. I saw some complaints about the marinated artichokes but this is what I used and I have no complaints there at all.

It is surprisingly very good! I didn't think the flavors would blend well, but they did. Only problem was that the garlic burned (maybe I had the oil too hot), but otherwise very good and very filling. Even my husband liked it and he'd never had artichokes before!

Quick and easy.  Boyfriend loved it.  I skipped the cheese.

I reduced the oil, substituted in red pepper flakes, used plain artichokes (not marinated) and left out the cheese.  The dip was pretty good, I will make this again.  The red pepper was key.  And I think lemon juice would help also.

It was pretty good. In the future I'll probably only use half of the artichokes and scale back the garlic because they tend to overwhelm the dish.

This was a different recipe.  We love beans and artichokes, but something about this didn't turn out right.  The beans were mush and the dish tasted very pickled possibly because the artichokes were marinated.  I was able to eat what I put on my plate, but hubby couldn't.  I threw is away.  Possibly non-marinated artichokes would work better.

I really liked this. I was looking for something different, and something I already had in the house.Next time i won't use so much of the red ground pepper. My child's father state it was good but it was too much artichokes in it, so next time i think i will use two cans instead of one. I also use parmesan instead of romano since I already had that.

I started from dried beans that I'd hydrated a day or so before.  I boiled the beans before adding them to the recipe (to simulate canned beans) but I must have boiled them too long because they turned to mush.  Next time I'll only briefly boil them and see if I can get a less mushy consistency.  Other than that one texture issue, the flavors were great.
