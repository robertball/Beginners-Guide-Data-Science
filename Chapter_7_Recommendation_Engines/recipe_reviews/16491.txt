I gave this recipe 5 stars, conditional on the fact that I took others' advice and changed it around a bit.  First of all, I doubled it to make 24 muffins.  I guess I was certain the changes would make them good!  And it worked.  I increased the brown sugar from 1/2 c. to 3/4 c., so they were just a little bit sweet (perfect).  I was generous with the berries, using a little more than called for.  For the flour, I used 1 1/3 c. whole wheat, and 1 c. white flour.  The oats I used were quick-cooking as well.  I added a tsp. of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg.  I also folded in about 2/3 c. sliced almonds with the raspberries.  These are delish with all the above mentioned changes!  I never made the recipe in its original format, so I can't comment on that.  But, if you want a healthy, hearty, mildly sweet muffin, the addendums I mentioned should get you that.  Oh yes, one more thing, I did NOT bake them for 25-30 minutes as the recipe stated.  In my oven, it only took 18 minutes!  I would start checking them around 15-17 minutes just to be safe.  Enjoy!

A very good muffin- IMO. I changed a couple things- thanks, in part, to others' remarks.
First, I used whole wheat flour, instead of all-purpose white. The texture is thicker, as you would imagine & we liked it, but you could go half & half for a more lighter muffin with the benefits of whole wheat.
Instead of increasing the sugar amount, I coated the berries in white sugar (about 2 Tbs.) before adding. This seemed to be enough extra sweetnees for us. I also liked the nutmeg- and followed other's suggestions by 1/2 tsp.
(Optional: 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts didn't change a thing but taste & texture- We are all "nuts" here, anyway. ;-) )
25 mins bake time worked fine. I used the 'ole "Toothpick" method for doneness.
One last suggestion for those with kids with a sweet-tooth: We either give them jelly to slather on them or a small bowl of apple sauce to use for dipping.
Loved using this recipe for a good "base" for muffins! They freeze well, also! :-) 
Thanks "Min"!!!

I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the recipe and used frozen blackberries and raspberries.  they turned out very well.  cooking them at a high temperature allows the outside to be crispy and the inside to be squishy.  a really good muffin that you don't have to feel guilty about eating!

Sorry, but the original recipe isn't very good. As stated by a couple of others, it is too bland. To liven these up, I instead use: 1.5 cu. whole wheat flour, 2 t. ground cinnamon, 1/2 c. sugar (white or light brown), 1/4 to 1/3 c. of chopped walnuts, and sprinkle the tops with turbinado (raw) sugar instead of using the recipe as stated. Sometimes, if I have maybe a tablespoon or so of leftover sour cream, I will fold that in last. The sour cream makes the muffins really light yet tender. The overall result? Yummy muffins! However, because I had to heavily modify to recipe to make the the muffins tasty, I'm sorry to say that I could only give it three stars.

made a few modifications. I used half whole wheat flour (just estimated the 1/3 cup) did 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/4. used a scarce tablespoon for baking powder (don't like the taste that much) increased cinnamon to about 1 tsp. added a splash of vanilla. and substituted 2 tbs of butter for oil. also i used 1 1/4 cup of raspberries and 3/4 cup blueberries. they were frozen. so i rinsed them and patted with paper towels.  DELICIOUS! like really i'm in love with these things. will make again!

These muffins were very bland. I sprinkled cinnimon and sugar about 10 minutes before I took them out of the oven. My husband liked them with the topping.

Not sure I would make again..

I did not change the recipe because I didn't want a sweet muffin for heath reasons, however I don't believe that this recipe was ever tested because these were more tasteless than a diet bran muffin, sorry! just had to say it . I doubled the recipe to freeze some for later used fresh berries- took one bite and tossed them in the can. My advice would be find another recipe. Too many changes would have to be made here.

I love this recipe! I changed it a little by adding 1/2 cup more brown sugar and the berry flavor was enhanced a lot...

I made these muffins with blackberries. I even put in some extra berries, but still were just too bland. No one in our house cared for them much. Maybe I did something wrong!

Not good.  I followed the recipe, using a combination of blueberries and a few blackberries.  These were dense, not sweet, with almost a bitter aftertaste to them.  They did not rise at all despite the huge amount of baking powder, which may have caused the after taste.  Won't try again.

Good breakfast muffin. Not light and fluffy like I usually strive for in a muffin, these are a thick and hearty change of pace with the addition of oats. They rise nicely and are nicely complemented with the addition of raspberries. I soaked my oats in the milk and egg before blending the wet ingredients with sugar as another recipe directs, and baked 11 muffins at 350 for close to 20 min.  I was glad that they weren't too sweet.

I made these exactly as stated with the addition of 1tsp of vanilla extract. I made them for my hubby with some fresh raspberries that needed to be used. I set my timer for 20 minutes, glad I did, they were done! My fussy hubby said they were VERY good. That warrants a keep in my recipe box!

Terrible.  I doubled the sugar as advised by other reviewers. But really, 2 cups of raspberries are too much for these muffins. The tartness of the berries "sours out" any sweetness in the muffin.

I heeded other posted reviews and used 1/3c brown sugar (1/2c would have been too much, giving you cupcakes instead of muffins!), and added a bit of nutmeg.  I also used butter and a little coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil, which is VERY unhealthy.  A mix of frozen blueberries and raspberries worked well for us.  Nice and fruity goodness with butter!  I don't know why anyone found these dry--mine turned out quite moist!  They didn't stick any more than any other muffin does.  For muffins, do NOT use cupcake liners or they definitely will stick to the paper.  Simply butter the bottom ONLY of the muffin cups, then when they come out of the oven, run a butterknife around the edge and pop the muffin out.

Very good.  We upped the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, as suggested and used quick cooking oats.  Not as much crunch as rolled oats would have given, but still very tasty.  Lasted only one day in our house!!!  Highly reccommended

I have been looking for a whole wheat blueberry muffin with oatmeal.  The oatmeal adds a whole new dimension to the healthfulness of this recipe. Like many others here, I would add cinnamon, too. Thanks!

This recipe was ok, it was a little blane. I put blueberries instead of raspberries. I addes a bit more sugar and nutmeg. If I made them again I would add a little vanilla and more cinnimon.

These smelled delicious while they were cooking!! Could hardly wait to let them cool to try them. Very good-but I followed the advice of others and I doubled the sugar (they are still not overly sweet), added 1/4 t of nutmeg, 1 t vanilla and then I topped them with sugar and cinnamon mixture before they went in the oven. TASTY!

Yuck - these are awful. I wish I had read the reviews (I almost always do but was in a hurry). They are not nearly sweet enough (and I don't even like muffins that are too sweet) & 2 cups of berries is WAY too much. Using this amount of berries results in a muffin that is almost more berry than muffin. I used fresh raspberries, which was a big waste since the muffins are so yucky. Maybe salvagable with changes, but as it stands this recipe is not worth the time or ingredients.

I added an extra 1/2 cup sugar (per many suggestions) and found these to be quite tasty!  I used raspberries and blueberries (I used IQF berries).  My co-workers also enjoyed them, especially as a breakfast muffin when you don't want something too sugary.

Overall, recipe is okay. I made some adjustments. Increased the flour by 1/3 cup, added 1/2 tsp of salt, replaced the oil with 1/2 cup of melted butter, reduced the milk to 1/2 cup, left the brown sugar amount the same, but added 1/2 cup of white sugar. Decreased the baking temp to 375, increased the time to 40-45 minutes, reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp baking soda, added 1 tsp of vanilla, and used fresh blackberries and strawberries, and added an additional egg. They came out perfect.

I went ahead and added 1/2 cup sugar like others had said, and used fresh raspberries...These are AWESOME! I am eating them as we speak. My husband is going to love them. I will be making them again. Also, I didn't have oats, so I upped the flour by a cup to compensate. Used whole wheat flour, too.

I wasn't very fond of these as they were very dry. Other people claimed to like them, but I would make sure to add more moisture next time.

I used mixed berries from the frozen foods aisle and added extra sugar as suggested.  They were quite good but next time I think I wikll add a little lemon rind and cinnamon/nutmeg to bring out the flavors.  They were all eaten and enjoyed by my family however and I love the added oatmeal in the recipe.

Loved the muffins.I don't like sweets that much so just right with 1/3 cup sugar. Also used low fat buttermilk instead of regular milk. Used blueberries instead of raspberries. Found them just sweet enough and very moist. perfect for breafast or mid day snack.

Very good. I used fresh raspberries that me and my mom picked from a friend's local farm. Also added a bit more sugar and used 4 tablespoons of applesauce in place of the egg and oil. Family loved them...very good breakfast muffin. Thanks Min!

These muffins were okay. I added 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of butter. After my modifications, these muffins turned out GREAT!! They were much more moist and tasty! I also recommend adding almonds.

This was a great muffin. If you are looking for something sweet - it's not here. Great flavor - I think adults more than children will love them. Gave half to my neighbor and she loved them also. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe is good in theory, but I found it needed some help. I do not think that 1/4c. sugar is enough. I will double that it my next attempt. I did use a sugar substitute, but it was equal measure. I also increased the cinnamon, added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. vanilla. It was still slightly bland. I may try adding lemon juice and zest, too.

with changes: 1/2 c packed brown sugar, 1 t each baking soda and powder, 3 T butter not oil.
Made them again with oil, 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 milk. Just not great muffins.

It's a keeper!  Not only quick and easy, but healthy and delicious.  It made exactly 1 dozen muffins for me.  I didn't have any eggs and didn't realize it till I was already making it, so I used 1/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt instead and whadya know, it turned out so well!  I also used 1 1/2 cups of mixed berry frozen fruit(thawed and pressed gently between paper towels to get excess water out) and 1/2 cup of fresh cut up strawberries.  Just as others suggest, double the sugar, trust me- it won't be too sweet.  It will be perfect!  Thanks for an awesome last-minute recipe!

I reduced the berries to 1 cup, and used half red raspberries, and half black raspberries. 1 cup was almost too many, the berry taste was overwhelming. I agree with the other reviewers in that this wasn't sweet, more sugar would've been helpful.

I thought these were delicious! I upped the brown sugar to 1/3 cup which was fine because I like to taste the berries more than the sugar. I also used the frozen berry mix from Costco (blueberries, raspberries, marion berries). I also did not mind that is was just oozing with berries - Yum! Thanks for this recipe!

It depends on what you are looking for -- if you want a sweet muffin, this is not it. But if you like your muffins to taste more like the fruit that is in them and less like sugar, this is a very good recipe.  In the words of my 3-year-old "yummy".  In the words of my 7-year-old, "I can't decide if it is a 4 or a 5.  It tastes more like raspberries than a muffin."  I thought they were great.
    We did take others' advice and increased the brown sugar by 50%, as well as using half whole wheat flour.  Raspberries were fresh.
   Good recipe -- we'd make again.

The only modifications I made were 1 c. ap flour and 1/3 whole wheat flour for the 1 1/3 ap flour and I used mixed fresh berries (raspberries, blue berries, black berries, and a few strawberries.)  I DID think 1 TBS. of baking powder was excessive, but I don't like to change a recipe too much when I first try it.  On a positive note, the muffins looked beautiful and the texture of the bread was good.

These were very yummy. Not too sweet at all like a lot of muffins out there; in fact, they reminded me of a mini bowl of oatmeal with some strawberries mixed in. :) *Due to my fiances cholesterol, I substituted 2 whites for the one egg and 3 tbs. applesauce for the oil.*

This turned out great. I used a 10X13 pan, extra berries, 1c brown sugar, nutmeg, 1/2 tsp each almond and vanilla extracts. I baked for about 28 min.This would be great with a crumb topping either in a pan or muffins to give a little extra kick! Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this recipe but I substituted some ingredients and added a couple of suggestions from other reviews. Instead of milk I used Almond milk (unsweetened vanilla) and I added a drop of vanilla essence and a little extra sugar. I used blueberries instead of raspberries. I added some nutmeg as well. it turned out very good, light, healthy and yummy!

These aren't too sweet, which makes sense since they are supposed to be healthier for you. I like to make the batter and then add chocolate chips. So good!

I also made a few modifications and they turned out great!  I used half white flour and half whole wheat.  I also added a couple tbsps stevia and a couple tbsps Applesauce and some ginger.  I thought the batter was a little runny so I did add another tbsp or two of flour.  My husband really enjoyed them and usually has a comment to make when I try to make things healthier!

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup blueberries and 1/2 cup raspberries and used gluten free all purpose flour as I have celiac disease. I also only baked them for 20 minutes. They taste amazing, my only complaint is that the stuck to the wrappers like crazy. I'll definitely use this recipe again, only I might add more oil in the hopes that they won't stick! :)

I made these yesterday with my fresh from garden raspberries. They didn't rise, and were very bland tasting. We didn't like them. Sorry but wont make these again.

These didn't rise at all and I was thinking they were going to be a flop, but they ended up tasting very good.

This we a good muffin, but not great.  I doubled the sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla, but it still wasn't sweet or flavorful enough.  Next time, I'll add applesauce and perhaps chocolate chips to make it tastier.

Used this as a base for a healthier diabetic friendly muffin.  Used whole wheat flour,Sugar Twin brown sugar. Omitted the oil and used 2 Tbls sour cream along with 1 Tbls honey.  Also added one medium appled peeled,sliced and cooked in 2 Tbls apple juice. Added one mashed very ripe banana, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Finally replaced raspberries with an overfilled 2 cup of sliced strawberries.  Baked at the 425 for 25 minutes.  Made 22 muffins.  Mmmm Good.   Thanks, Karen in Nebraska

They were good. I added mixed fresh berries. I did find them a little dry. I think next time I'm alson gonna add a bananna. I think that will help make them a little less dry and give them some more flavour.

Pretty good. I upped the brown sugar to 1/3 and used frozen raspberries. You definitely need to use non-stick spray in the pan or muffin cups. I didn't have any and just used a little oil rubbed into the tins and it stuck like crazy. But they were pretty good.

I was unsure about the sugar because I really didn't want sweet cupcake-like muffins, but at the same time, raspberries are fairly tart so I didn't want muffins that were inedible. In the end I decided to double the sugar and I'm glad I did. The resulting muffins were mildly sweet with excellent tart raspberry flavor. I also added 1/4 t nutmeg and 1/2 t salt to bring out the other flavors, and I used two pints of raspberries -- probably more like 1 1/2 cups. If you want raspberries in every bite, I recommend that amount (or maybe even more!). Overall a nice dense, chewy muffin that allows the raspberry flavor to shine through.
