This was really a different and fun way to have a healthy dessert.  I didn't use as much sugar as called for and I did dust with a little cinnamon.  I used greek yogurt so it would hod up and not be so runny.

Simply and straight forward and down right delicious. I do think vanilla yogurt would have paired nicely with the nectarine without overpowering and I plan to try that next time.
