Very good and and healthy! I made numerous times and made just a few changes that I think would help others. I made this trying it with almond milk and cashew milk, both options heart healthy with no saturated fats. Coconut milk contains saturated fat. 

I added the spices (turmeric, ginger and cinnamon) to the 1 cup cashew or almond milk in a 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup (room to whisk without spilling) and microwaved for 1 min. 30 sec. The spices easily whisk  in when milk is hot, no need for a saucepan or mmersion blender, but you could.  I added 1.5 oz of espresso. My husband could not taste enough coffee at 1 oz and our machine pours a 1.5 oz shot. Then added 1 teaspoon of Truvia to sweeten. 
Finally, stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. The extract has an alcohol base making it evaporate easily. If you add it to either saucepan method or microwave method, you will loose some of the vanilla while heating. Stirring it in at the end keeps more vanilla in your beverage. 
*I used unsweetened vanilla cashew and unsweetened vanilla almond milk when subbing out coconut milk.  They are both good, I think I preferred the cashew milk as it is creamier than almond. Both are good choices. 
This a great heart healthy, anti inflammatory drink! 
Thanks you for sharing it!

Way too heavy on the turmeric. I forced it down, but letâ€™s be honest, this is bad.

I love it! I prefer whole milk to coconut milk, but the rest of the recipe is perfect

Love the coffee/turmeric combo. Very earthy with just a hint of sweetness.

I added pumpkin, cloves, and allspice to give it a little PSL flavor. It was very good and the tumeric still came through well

Not the BEST latte I've ever had but I guess it's healthier choice! Definitely worth a try! Will I make it again? Maybe, probably not :/

This is so delicious. I had no idea that coffee and turmeric would go so well together but they do. It's smooth and flavorful hot but also is quite refreshing cold. Thank you for the recipe.
