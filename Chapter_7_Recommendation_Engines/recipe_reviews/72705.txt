This soup is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I pureed the carrots and onions in the blender with some of the broth mixture after they were cooked to make the soup perfectly smooth.  The only thing I would change next time is to use sharp cheddar.

This soup is simple to make and kids love the simple taste of just good cheese.

Yummy, tasted just like the cheese soup that was served at a restaurant I worked at years ago.  I used a more expensive yellow sharp cheddar.  Thank you for this recipe!

If You Dont Like Processed Cheese 'Food' Try This!!  I made it last night and it was really good and filling.  Perfect base to add you favorite ingredients to.  This is the only way I have ever been able to pull off Cheese soup.  Considering the bizzare changes I made to accomidate what I had availible  (broth and veggies) I was surprized that it came out perfect, without any clumps or weird consistency.  I started out with precooked veggies, so I just added them to the roux and it was fine!  This is easy and friendly as well.

I halfed the recipe and also pureed the soup before adding the cheese. It was good. I used it to mix half and half with tomato soup in a bowl for a recipe/idea I saw in Rachael Ray's magazine. It was very good with the tomato soup and some homemade coutons (cubes of bread fried in butter). I chose this recipe because it didn't call for a Velveeta-type cheese. I don't keep that on hand!

This was a great soup!!  I made a few changes.  I added a tablespoon flour to the grated cheese, increased the cheese to 4 cups and did a sharp cheddar & medium cheddar mix.  I also used half & half instead of milk.

I followed the recipe to a T and I just wasn't that impressed.  It was edible but way too many onions - I would call this recipe cheese and onion soup.

I just made this for my family and even my 4 year old son LOVED it. I did make a few changes right out of the gate though, like using half and half instead of milk. I used 4 cups of shredded mild cheddar cheese instead of 3. Added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the veggie mixture. Skipped the baking powder altogether. Also, I added 1/2 cup chopped celery ... mmmmm! Love it!

I would give this 6 stars if I could. Don't pay any attention to Jiggy's review. This is by far the BEST cheese soup I have ever had. Thank you for sharing..

I LOVE cheese. This soup is so perfect, I could cry. I have been looking for a recipe that uses cheddar forever! This is a keeper. Great with bread.

I used the recipe almost as is but I had several different kinds of cheese (leftover from a football party). It was mostly cheddar with a about 1/2 cup  Swiss and 1/2 cup Colby. I used extra cheddar so there was about 4 cups cheese total instead of three. The flavor and consistency is excellent. I am hoping my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter will like it.

Good recipe, Upped the cheese to 4 cups as it seemed lacking and used a mix of smoked, mild, and sharp cheddar and it turned out fantastic! Great if you can't eat solids after dental work and you want something full of flavor.
