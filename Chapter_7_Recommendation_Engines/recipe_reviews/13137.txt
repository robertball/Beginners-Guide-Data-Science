I used this recipe yesterday, and it was delicious!  I did add grated carrots, one can cream of celery, and one can cream of mushroom soup. I also omitted the cornstarch and water, I thicken all of my soups with powdered mashed potatoes, you can make it as thick or thin as you want that way, and it is much easier than cornstarch, with the added nutrition. EXCELLENT!!

Oh yeah, you guys were right; this soup is definitely up there with Paneras! It was also one of the quickest soups I've ever made as it took me all of fifteen minutes. I used frozen broccoli and once thawed in the broth, I took the vegies out and chopped them in my food processor. I didn't have any celery soup in the house, so I used a "healthy" cream of chicken instead. I added some of my own seasonings including cayenne for a little kick, otherwise I followed the recipe. Absolutely delicious Pam and thanks!

Oh my goodness, this was DELICIOUS!!! It tasted just like Ruby Tuesdays!  It had nothing but rave reviews all around!!  I did however add more cheese than called for because I love cheese.  It just made it more rich and delicious.  A definate to make.  Relativly easy too.  Five stars all the way!

12/23/03 - Made again tonight, just as delicious as the first time.  My one year old son LOVED this.

The recipe as is is kinda bland.  I made some adjustments to add flavor.  I used 1 can cr. celery & 1 can cr. chicken.  I added diced carrots, 1 onion, black pepper & garlic.  This soup was so good my family requested I make more as soon as it was gone.  Will definitely make again.

My brother doesn't like broccoli, but he loved this soup! My father likes a "beefier" soup, so I added chopped potatoes, carrots, celery, and noodles. The soup is pretty salty, but not overly so. I used the leftovers for a topper for baked potatoes the next day.

I would love to give this recipe 6 stars, if I could.  It is the picture of simplicity, but tastes like you slaved over the stove.  I tried this recipe as a treat for my mom who adores the broccoli cheese soup at Panera Bread.  I prepared this soup on a snowy, wintery evening (what better time for soup) and it was a huge hit.  The only changes I made was doubling the amount of cheese (I used sharp cheddar for an especially zingy flavor) and adding one cup of shredded carrots, since Panera has shredded carrots.  My mom and dad both declared that this soup was as delicious as the Panera soup.  This one goes into my family favorites recipe box!

Quick, Inexpensive, and Easy!!  I did leave out the water and rounded off the chicken broth to three (14oz) cans  so I wouldn't have to open up a fourth can and just use part.  I also added more cheese.  Very good!  I will make this again.

This is fantastic. I used about 1/2 tbls more corn starch and half and half instead of milk. I left out the 1/2 cup of water as suggested and added the corn starch to the milk (half and half)and soup mix instead. This is def a re-do.

Really simple and delicious. The second time I made this, I used three (14oz) cans of broth and omitted the water. I combined 1/2 C milk with the cornstarch in a stand mixer, and then mixed in the rest of the milk and the cream of celery. I used a little more than 2 C of shredded Tillamook medium cheddar cheese. I served the soup with fresh cracked pepper and ciabatta rolls.

This was a great recipe, even better the next day. I did add a cup more cheese, but I felt the soup was too liquidy and not as flavorful without the extra cup of cheese....then again, I like cheese!! My kids liked it, and it filled them up quickly. I had it for lunch the next day, and I still have some in the freezer!!

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!  I made this soup a few months ago and chose it over all the other broccoli cheese soups on this web site because it doesn't have Velveeta(the words "processed cheese food" are enough to turn my stomach... ok w/ mac and cheese, but that's it!).  It was soooo incredibly wonderful!  If I remember correctly, I may have added some more cheese, but it would have been great with the amount named here, too.  I'm going to make it for dinner again tomorrow and plan on putting in some potato and carrots.  I know it sounds weird, but serve this with pumpkin bread (not for dipping!) and a spinach salad, and you can go to bed happy! :o)

My husband thought this was as good as the Broccoli Cheese soup from Panera.  Comes together quickly and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I liked that the recipe called for fresh broccoli.  I will make this again.

My sister and I were in the mood for broccoli cheese soup.  I didn't want to go get takeout, so I found this recipe & it looked easy.  I was forced to improvise the first time making it, as I did not have any chicken broth or even boullion.  I did find some chicken w/rice soup and used that.  Even at that rate it turned out great.  I just put the cheese in the serving bowls so we could have as much or as little as we preferred.  I will definitely make this many more times!!  Thanks.

I had a hard time getting mine to thicken up.  I added a small onion for flavor.  Next time, I think I'll add more broccoli--I think the fact that the broth was so thin made the broccoli seem even more sparse.  BUT the flavor was pretty good and it was an easy meal.

Well I gave it a three. Husband gave it a five. So 'we' gave it a four. He says it's restaurant quality. I say it's ok - pretty good but definately not a 5 star recipe.

This is incredible soup!!!  I had 6 c. broccoli and used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  AMAZING flavor!!!  My kids (5, 4, and 2) sucked it back like it was chocolate milk and my husband gave it 11 stars out of ten and he's not a fan of broccoli.  This is a MUST save recipe!  Thank you!!!

I love brocolli cheddar soup, and this was the worst recipe I have ever tried.  Using the Cream of celery soup is a huge mistake.  You might as well buy a can of soup and heat it on the stove, it takes less time, and will taste about the same.  Not highly recommended by myself, especially if you want a homemade taste.

Now that it is spring time and families hit the concert/baseball game/awards dinner rush that accompanies the end of the school year, I find it difficult to make a meal that tastes good and demands little of me.  Usually soup and sandwiches, consists of condensed soup and bologna.  Tonight I made this soup, it tasted great, demanded hardly anything of me and I didn't feel rushed making it.  Nice and thick, I added an additional spoon of cornstarch, and also another half cup of cheese, definitely looking forward to trying this with the carrot as well.

Talk about easy!!  I used three heads of fresh broccoli, including stems with hard parts peeled away, cooked until tender. Drain, chop it up a bit, add three pints of water with two big Kendall chicken bouillon cubes broken up, combine soups, milk and starch as per recipe and stir in an 8 oz package of shredded cheddar as the simmering is completed.  Great, really.  Easy and great!

I made this for my girlfriends and our babies on rainy afternoon and everyone loved it!  I omitted 1/2 qt of broth (one can) and I used 1 can of cream of celery and one can of cream of mushroom. I also added 1/2 cup diced onion in with the broccoli to cook. I put half of the cooked broccoli in the blender and then added it.  I do not think this soup needs more cheese, and because of reducing the stock, the corn starch wasn't necessary.  I added a bit more broccoli and i will add even more next time!  My husband was disappointed there weren't any leftovers but I will definitely be making this again soon. Thank you very much!

This is a fantastic basic recipe that I've tweaked to suit my family's tastes.  We like chunky, thick soups, and so I usually add 1-2 cubed potatoes to the broccoli mixture (and I ALWAYS use fresh broccoli;  frozen broccoli should be outlawed!) and a few shredded carrots.  I also use 1 can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken -- we like the chicken-flavored base, but we didn't think the broth gave it enough kick.  

I have also used a fresh broccoli/cauliflower mix in this soup, and it was equally as good.

Add a kick to the recipe by substituting a can of Cambell's "cream of poblano" soup rather than cream of celery.  I'm not sure it's available everywhere, but it certainly is here in Texas.  This little modification makes it a 5 star recipe for sure!

This was delicious and very easy.  I only had cream of chicken soup, but I don't think it made much difference.  It was very good!

I had to alter it a little but the resultd were AMAZING!!! ok, I added shredded carrots, chopped onion and cubed ham. Then, had only one can of cream of celery, so used that and a can of cream of potato. Then nixxed corn starch and water. Used nonfat milk. Four cheese blend = really yummy! If it is too watery for you, you can add some mash potato mix to thicken to your liking! Happy cooking! Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!!

I altered this recipe a bit, bit with my additions, this soup is better than Panera's! I used 49 oz. of chicken broth and bout 3 heads of brocolli. I also substituted one can of cream of celery with chedar cheese soup. I also added 3 cups of cheese. I don't think I will ever try another brocolli cheese soup recipe again.

I had made another highly rated broccoli cheese soup from this website that was made with imitation cheese. The recipe was really great but I wanted to try a recipe with real cheese. (I'm not a big fan of putting lab created foods into my body) Anyway this recipe is just as great if not better! I did of course make a couple changes, I used frozen broccoli because it was on sale that day, and the last couple minutes while it simmered in the broth I tossed in about a cup of matchstick carrots. Delish! Also, After whisking the milk (I use 1%)and soup together, I then whisked the corn starch into the milk/soup mixture. I never used the 1/2 cup of water as other reviwers suggested there was too much liquid in the soup. I used a finely shredded bag of sharp cheddar (I highly reccomend this flavor!) and it melted beautifully into the soup. A little salt and pepper and voila! This came out perfect and delicious!

I was pleased with this recipe, it tasted very good. Changes I made were to decrease broth by 1 cup, add garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper, puree half the cooked broccoli and add it back to the soup, and use half Velveeta and half cheddar cheese. Next time I make this, however, I will add 1-2 cups more broccoli to make the soup more substantial. UPDATE: Upon making this a few times, I settled on doubling the amount of broccoli. This makes the soup very substantial.

Very good soup. Similar taste to Panera's brocolli and cheese soup. I added more broccoli and used cream of broc. instead of cream of celery.

very good. I followed the recipe to a tee except i used lowfat chicken broth and lowfat cream soup. Next time i will definitly use more broccoli maybe 2- 3 cups more, and more cheese, maybe as garnish.

Very good recipe.  Surprised by family with this special treat which has now become a family favorite.  I add "matchstick" carrots to the brocolli.  We like the extra color.  I also added a touch of dry mustard and it gave it an extra zing!

I loved this recipe. I was a little nervous to make it, but afterwards my husband tried it and said it was really good! It was so easy to make. I will definately be making this again soon. I have a 2 year old who wasn't a huge fan of it...but he's a 2 year old...if that doesn't say enough :) Thanks for the recipe!

I love this soup. It was delicious, simple and made with ingredients on hand.
I substituted cream for the milk because I had it to use up, but I'm sure it would be delicious either way.

As usual I had to do my own modifications to a recipe. :) But this was a great base! I used it as stated but added carrots, celery,onion, garlic pepper, parsley and a lil salt. Also I did not have cream of celery so I used cream of potato instead. Yum!

Some said this compared to Panera bread, and it was close. I asked at Panera bread concerning the chicken broth, because this soup had a little to much chicken taste. I was told they used beef broth for the soup. I will try this next time and give an update. Even though the soup had a chicken like flavor, it was still a hit with the family.

This soup was easy to make and delicious.  I wanted to make sure that the broccoli remained a bright green so I followed instructions that I have for cooking the green vegetables in  boiling sugar and salt(carmalized) water for 7 minutes.  I also used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.

I would have given 5 stars except I edited the recipe as per suggestions. I used 3 cups of cheese, left out the extra 1/2 cup of water, and used 1/2 cup of potato flakes to thicken because I didn't have any cornstarch. It was fantastic!

This recipe I felt I had to fix after having one bowl of soup. I ended up adding a can of cheddar cheese soup. Next time I might add a can of cheddar cheese soup along with the cream of celery.

We were not very impressed with this soup. There was not enough flavor. As another reviewer stated, it mainly tasted like chicken broth with broccoli in it. It wasn't really cheesy at all and was too thin. We added some spices and added extra cornstarch to attempt to thicken it up, but it was still too thin and not very flavorful. I'm surprised by all the positive reviews.

This soup is great! I usually throw in a bit of pepper (my family does love the black pepper) and a little extra liquid and a little extra cheese, but it's really good as is with no mods.
It also cooks up really fast and can be made with frozen brocc in a pinch, so it's become one of my favorite go-to quick lunch/dinner recipes.

*NOTE*: Just finished making this for lunch (yet again). If you can get your hands on some Cougar Gold (white cheddar made by students at Washington State University in Pullman) -- HOLY SMOKES, Batman. It was AMAAZING. Yum. Big time.

I made this soup over our first chilly weekend in Florida. I used 2lbs frozen broccoli cuts, 1 small minced onion, and grated 2 carrots. I also added 3 cups of cheddar cheese.  I added salt, pepper, and ground fresh ginger to taste. The results were fabulous!! This soup was enjoyed by the whole family. The leftovers are even tastier the next day. We enjoyed ours with warm buttered biscuits. Thank you for the delicious recipe.

I made this exactly as it says except I used an immersion blender and pureed the broccoli.  It was excellent.  I was looking forward to the leftovers the next day to find that my husband added some shredded chicken to it and ate it all.  Definitely a keeper.

I modified this like many other reviewers.  I added 2 extra cups broccoli, one of which I pureed.  I added 2 cups cheddar and 1 cup smoked gouda along with some garlic & onion powders.  I only had 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom.  It came out very good; my teenage son asked for seconds!

WOW...this was good. Especially for my fussy eaters. I did make some minor adjustments though. I used mashed potato flakes to thicken instead of cornstarch, chicken boullion in place of the chicken broth and 2 cans of evaporated milk in place of the regular milk. I also added the cheese to the soup after it is in the bowl.

this was a great recipe with a few changes-I like that it uses real cheese-not process cheese. I added onion and shredded carrots, extra broccoli, then blended 1/2 of the cooked vegies in a blender to make it creamier!

A nice thick soup. I added a whole white onion & 3 chopped cloves of garlic for additional flavor. Crumbled bacon is also an excellent addition to this recipe.

We liked this.  I used frozen broccoli (increased to about 6 cups or so) and a can of evaporated milk.  It was good, but a little salty.   Next time I will use low sodium cream of celery soup, and add in some shredded chicken and chopped potatoes.

I scaled this recipe down in quantity and it was a good thing as this one doesn't re-cook well. Great recipe though, just don't over-do the cornstarch.

Excellent!!  I'm so glad for the reviews.  I wouldn't have tried this without them.  Everyone was right!  I used cream of mushroom and added some shredded carrot, otherwise did exactly as recipe said.  You won't be disappointed!

Good recipe.  I use non-fat milk, so I needed to use 1.5-1.75 Tbsp of cornstarch instead of just the 1 called for in order to thicken it up, but it tasted good.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I used 2% milk and mushroom soup instead of celery soup.  I also chopped 1/2 of the broccoli quickly in my Ninja. Delicious!  I’ll serve it with company next time!

Great recipe that tastes very similar to Panera's broccoli cheese soup.  I followed the recipe exactly but substituted vegetable broth, doubled the cheese, and added a handful of onions to the boiling broth.  I would recommend adding a few teaspoons of black pepper.

I added an onion as suggested by others, and used garlic salt and pepper to season.  Instead of cream of celery I used one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom soup.  I added a little more cheese and about a half a cup of sour cream! SO good.

Made a few changes, but the basic plan was the same.  I used frozen broccoli because it's what I had, and I added a little extra Cheddar to finish up the package.  Also, because I had used skim milk, it wasn't thickening like I wanted, so I added a small amount of half and half to aid thickening.

I took some to a friend and hubby ate the rest.  They both said it was delicious and I could do it again!

Oh, man. I loved this. I wouldn't compare it to Panera, but -- and I can't believe I'm saying this -- I liked it better! I did have to make some modifications because I had a craving, but not the supplies. I had no milk, so I mixed some powdered creamer with water. It worked! Also used frozen broccoli, threw in some onions, shredded carrots, powdered onion, and garlic. I didn't find it to taste too much like chicken at all, and found the cream of celery to be the perfect compliment.

I made this soup with slight changes.  I didn't want to mess with the corn starch, so I skipped that and the water.  Instead, I put the tender broccoli in the blender.  That way my soup is thicker and I won't have my childrne picking out the broccoli.  I only had 2 cups chicken broth so I used water and bullion cubes in place of the rest of the chicken broth.  I thought the cream of celery soup that is added is much of the flavor.  However, I love cream of celery, so all in all I'm happy with this recipe.  It is still on the stove...waiting for the rest of the cheese to melt.  I may add some instant potato flakes to make it thicker if it seems to thin.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy to make and somewhat healthier than other broccoli cheese soups. Tastes good, and makes lots. If you want a cheesy taste, make sure to use old or extra old cheese or it will just get lost. Thanks!

I loved this recipe! I love cheese so I used 3 cups instead of 2. I've been looking for a copycat recipe of the one served in a tearoom near by, and this is very similar, but much cheesier, and it makes alot. My husband loved it as well, and he ate many bowls. I thought it would last more than 2 days, but not with my husband. Taste even better the next day. My 3 year old son even liked it to dip his chips in. Awesome soup, Thanks. I will be making this again and for friends and family.

I added more cheese and it still wasn't cheesy enough for us, but that's a personal preference.  It seemed to be missing something, but I can't quite figure out what. Still a good recipe.

After reading some of the other reviews I changed a few things.  I added 1 quart of chicken stock, and used 1 can of cream of celery soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and then used 1 cup of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the milk. I also added some grated carrot for color and i chopped the broccoli pretty finely so it would be evenly distributed.  Tt was plenty thick, actually when I reheated I added a little water.  With these changes my family gave it 5 stars.

Yummy! very easy and really good. I took some advice on altering slightly like using instant potato flakes instead of the cornstarch and added some seasonings, was a tad bland for our tastes. for the soups, I used one celery and one chik. I also put the broccoli in the blender(most of it)when it was cooked, I dont like this type of soup chunky.

"Yum-o!" - that's what my husband said about the soup... I guess I'll be making it again! 

I threw in chopped onions, pepper and garlic powder as well. And, I used 3/4 milk and 1/4 cream to make it thicker and richer. And, I went heavy on the cheese... probably used 1 1/2 cups (for 1/2 a batch).

This is my new favorite broccoli soup recipe!  Better than you can get at a restaurant.  I pureed about half of the broccoli after cooking it to make it creamier.  Also, I accidentally grabbed one can of cream of mushroom soup with the cream of celery and didn't notice until I had already opened it... I used it anyway, it was fine - I may stick with that as my family loves mushrooms :)

This was a good base recipe...I liked using the cream of celery.  I did not, however, use cornstarch. Instead, I used extra broccoli and a bit less broth - I found it still thickened up well and got nice and creamy and cheesy.  I'll probably make this again.

I like the recipe although I think I put to much broth because it didn't thicken, I added a little salt and freshly ground pepper, I also like how easy is to make it. I'll make it again reducing the amount of liquid.

This soup was a big hit at my house. The only thing i did different was saute an onion in a tablespoon of butter and add some shredded carrots. This will be made alot in my kitchen this winter. Thanks alot for the great recipe.

When I saw how highly rated this soup was, I couldn't wait to try it out.  I was quite disappointed.  It seemed flavorless, and only "OK."  I did have very high expectations though - and was hoping for something more similar to a Panera Bread Broccoli Cheese Soup and that could be where my problem lies.  My one-year old gulped it all down, though....  In the future, I'll look for something with a bit of seasoning...

Excellent! I couldn't stop eating it! I used frozen broccoli florettes and after simmering them, I used a potato masher to crush into very small pieces. I also used one can of "cream of squash flower" soup and one can of "cream of celery" soup (Campbell's), and cut the corn starch down to 3Tbsp. Loved it and will add to my regular rotation of meals! Thanks!

Well at first I only had 1 can of cream of celery.... So I thought I killed it. Found another can, and it still didn't really help. I hate to give bad ratings, but I was very dissapointed. We aren't a picky family, but this one wont be made again.

WONDERFUL soup...tastes heavenly on a rainy night....my only problem is that the soup tastes very "cornstarchy" the next day and isn't nearly as good reheated, which is a shame when the two of us could never finish it in one sitting.

My husband and I liked this recipe, it was so quick and easy. Unfortunatley my girls barely touched it, which means that we most likely won't make it again.  I do have to agree with a prior reviewer that you can taste the cream of celery soup in it, but I happen to like cream of celery so I thought it was yummy.  It is a dominant flavor though.

I was pretty disappointing after reading all the reviews.  The soup didn't get thick at all and I felt like all I tasted was the cream of celery.  I probably wouldn't use this recipe again.

Very good and easy! I added extra broccoli, cheese, and cornstarch, and just a little bit of onion powder. Also, used frozen broccoli because that's what I had on hand. Chopped the broccoli in my little handichopper after it cooked in the chicken broth. Yummy! Will definitely make again.

Um..I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I thought this was just okay, I added a least another cup of cheese and had to add instant potatoes just to thicken it up enough to eat, I used frozen broccoli but not enought, so I know that was definately a problem - If you do use frozen before you thaw it measure at least 8 cups, that will get you more where you want. I'm not sure if I'll make it again, like I said maybe I did something wrong??

This recipe is awsome! Definitely holds up to any restaurant's broccoli soup. I used one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup in place of one of the cans of celery soup, and frozen broccoli cuts to save some time. Perfect for a cold winter day.  Mmmm...

I LOVE this recipe!!!  My boyfriend only eats the broccoli cheese soup from Cocoa's and he was very skeptical of this recipe.  When he tried it he ate until his stomach couldn't handle it anymore!  He even came home the next day for lunch just to have the rest!  I did add twice as much cornstarch just to make the soup thicker and pepper to taste.  Don't add salt, the cream of celery adds a lot of flavor.

This tastes even better than my favorite at a local restaurant!  Tastes great with some garlic bread for dipping!!  Will be making often.  I used 1/2 fat cream of celery soup to cut down on the fat.

Love this recipe! I did add a few things because I felt it was a little bland tasting. 
First, I sauteed onion and garlic in the pan, then I poured the broth in. I then added broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, and I let them simmer until soft. Instead of using 2 cans of celery, I used one can and then also a can of cream of chicken and herbs as well. While I was waiting for it to thicken up, I added some roasted potatoes. Roasting the potatoes first definitely added tons of flavor. So delicious!

I’ve never been a huge fan of broccoli soup. Apparently, that is because I never took the time to make it myself. I love this soup!! I added onion to it as well as shedded carrots. The next time (and there will be a next time) I will add an extra cup of broccoli. I used three cans of reduced sodium chicken broth. Perfect for a cold Ohio winter day!

I thought it was quite bland.  I made it with half n half instead of milk, but everything else was the same.  I finally ended up adding another cup of cheese, garlic powder, onion flakes, salt, and black pepper and then I was happy.  It's really a great, quick recipe and I love that it doesn't use processed cheese.  My family ended up LOVING it so I will save it with my additions for sure.

This soup is very bland. I made it as written and as soon as I had a taste I knew it needed some "doctoring' up.  Add pepper and whatever other seasonings you like because it's just not that tasty without them.

8 12 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13137/broccoli-cheese-soup-iii/ ... Personally, I could take or leave broccoli cheese soup so I'm rating this by the two that do.  :)  'Got a thumbs up & two compliments.  Really?!?  I wasn't too impressed.  I made minimal changes.  Halved this.  Subbed a package of frozen broccoli.  Decreased chicken broth to 2c & subbed milk for half & half.  Added 1/2t salt & 1/4t pepper; a few shakes nutmeg.  Wow.  It seems like a lot now, but the effect wasn't drastically different, I think.  A little sherry or white wine would be good to help that canned soup flavor, but I wasn't the one I was making it for anyway.

Followed the recipe but milk got too hot. Tasted gritty. I will make again. Was not the recipes fault but mine. I think putting the milk in later would be better.

Literally just finished making this and inhaled a bowl. YUM! Thank you! I had a ton of broccoli from my farm fresh to you box and needed to use it up. I added a grated carrot and onion to the broccoli and used my chicken stock in lieu of broth. I only had 1 can of cream of celery, so I used that and added a little heavy cream, cayenne pepper and some chef Daddy seasoning. I didn't measure the cheese, but I want to say I went a little over 2 cups. OOPSIE. BRAVO! My hub and kids will be stoked when they get home. It's perfect on this cold evening.

This was really good.  It never did thicken up for me so I'll try it with half the milk next time.  I also added a little salt, pepper, and onion.

This is a basic recipe that anyone can make when they're in a time-crunch.  I have 2 young picky eaters, and they actually finished their bowls.  I added brown rice to make it a heavier meal, and I would probably try to add more ingredients next time in order to enhance the taste.  I'm not a huge fan of cornstarch, so I may also try to omit it if I decide to go with this recipe again.  I read some of the other reviews mentioning different variations of this soup, and I would encourage other cooks to also see how others made it.  I rate it "ok" as is.

I made this soup today. The only change I made was to add in some cubed chicken that I needed to use up. I am obsessed with Panera Bread's broccoli and cheese soup...and I can honestly say this rivals it!

Tasty! Seems like it should have something else though. Maybe next time I would puree part of the broccoli and use potato starch.

What a delicious soup!! It was a hit all around with everyone!! I used 2 quarts instead of 1 1/2 and upped the cheese and used flour instead of cornstarch. I also used one can of cream of potato and one can of cream of onion as I don't like cream of celery. I added 2 ham steaks grilled and cut up as well to make it more hearty. Definitely will be making it again!!

We have a friend who needs a low sodium diet and this is perfect for him. He's requested it several times! Rated 4 stars just because you can't leave it alone to cook or it will boil and not turn out right so it requires your constant presence. But the taste is 5 stars!

We loved this! It got better each time we heated it up again. We, like previous reviewers, made some changes to the basic recipe. I used one cam cream of celery and one can cream of mushroom soup. I also added onions parsley and fresh garlic to the broccoli when it first cooks and added more cheese at the end. We'll definitely be making this again!

It felt a bit like I was just trying to stretch a can of soup, rather than actually MAKING soup.  All the same, it tasted good and was very quick/easy.  I didn't have cream of celery, so used what I had:  cream of broccoli and cream of potato.  The flavor from those seemed fine; also sub'd veggie broth for the chicken broth.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon each of black pepper and smoked paprika.  I didn't have the thickening problem that many others seemed to have, or perhaps I just like my soup thinner?  A lot of restaurant cream soups seem more like cheese sauce to me, so maybe it's just that I prefer a lighter soup.

A couple pulses in the ninja for the broccoli and I avoided chopping.  I added a small onion and garlic that I sauted in a little butter first, then added the broccoli.  I think I'll leave out the garlic next time though.  I also took others advice and used powdered mashed potatoes to thicken.  I had to add a little more milk but is was worth it.  Everyone loved this, served with a loaf of pilsbury's Italian bread, great for a cold day!

Very easy to prepare. My family ate it which in my book merits a five since it is hard to get them to eat this type of soup. I did need to use leftover broccoli and this was quick and did the job fro me.

I followed the recipe exactly as written (except I used 1 lb of frozen broccoli instead of fresh), tasted it, and then added some salt (I used low sodium broth and soup), pepper, cayenne pepper and oregano.  Perfect!  I planned ahead knowing that I wanted a thicker soup and let the base simmer for about an hour before I added 2 C of cheese, and then simmered for another 10 minutes.  It was the perfect consistency.  I will definitely be making this again...it was so easy, there's no point in making it from a mix!!

We loved this at my house.  I didn't use the cream of celery because a lot of other reviewers stated they didn't like the flavor or it.  So I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of broccoli.  I also added an extra cup of cheese.  Turned out great.  Really good flavor.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a broccoli cheese soup that didn't have velveeta,  (I don't like the taste of it).  This turned out wonderful. Very creamy and smooth.  My kids wolfed it down.  Definitely will make again.

This was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  I cooked it exactly as the recipe called for and it didn't take any longer than 40 minutes, so this could be an easy weekday meal.  Would be amazing in a bread bowl too!  This is going on the regular rotation.

This recipe sure was easy, but it lacked body and flavor.  I thought there was just way too much liquid in it.  It was very easy to put together, and pretty edible, but it could have been much thicker.  I think next time I will pick a recipe with butter and flour as a thickener, OR maybe decrease the amount of broth.  I cooked it plenty long, so that was not the problem.  It also could have used a bit of seasoning...maybe black pepper, cayenne, or something.  I think I'll try another recipe next time I make Broccoli Cheese Soup.

Delicious taste...i added a little bit of onion and carrots when boiling the broccoli.  Mine didn't thicken bc i accidentally added 4 tsp instead of tbsp of cornstarch  i took the advice to add mashed potato flakes and that did the job..but i'm not sure if it added to the saltiness of the soup (i added salt and shouldn't have).

This soup is really delicious, and really simple to make. Everyone in the house loved it. Added extra broccoli, and thickened with potato flakes.

I did add some onion to some butter before I added the broccoli. I also took most of the broccoli out and blended it up, because I don't like so many chunks. I also added some potato flakes instead of the cornstartch/water combo. This was very tasty and I think I will make this again!

This is a great comfort-food soup....thick and cheesy and super tasty!  Followed recipe except used 4 cans of less sodium broth, added approx 2 c. cauliflower to the 4 c. broccoli just so it wouldn't go to waste, no water or cornstarch but used potato flakes to thicken and sharp cheddar.  This will definitely be served again!

This was very good.  I did not add the extra water.  Just added the cornstarch to the soup/milk mixture.  I also added some sliced carrots.  It could use a little kick.  Next time I might add a few sliced red peppers.

I made this a second time and didn't have cream of celery, so used cream of chicken soup instead.  I did not at all like it this way.

I used my homemade broth as a base and I'm just realizing now as I review this recipe that I used too much!  So, I ended up with a very dilute final product and had to back peddle to fix it.  I think this is a good recipe.  I think it could be better with the addition of some shredded carrot and use fat free half and half for the milk.  Even better, would be to make your own "cheese sauce" with a roux base.  And mix this into the broccoli (and carrot) simmered in broth.  Hot sauce is a must.  We dipped sandwiches in it.    A good basic recipe, needs a little work to make it perfect.

This was great!  I used vegetable stock instead of broth for my vegetarian friend and brought it to work for a soup potluck---it was a huge hit!  I doubled the cheese and thought it was delicious.

This was really yummy!  My family loved this!  I replaced 1 cup of the milk with cream and used instant mashed potatoes to thicken it up instead of cornstarch.  Next time I might add some shredded carrots just to have a little more veggies, but it was perfect without!

The flavor was OK, but just missing something.. I added about 1/4 tsp of ground mustard and another cup of cheese, which did help, but it still wasn't great.  The soup was very, very liquid as well.  It was fine for this one time, but I probably won't be making this again.

This was really good, however we found it a little on the salty side. I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth and I will definitely go for the low sodium version next time. Otherwise it was really tasty!

Turned out very good.  I made a mistake and added too much water, so I had a problem with it being too thin, so I added about 1/2 c instant potato flakes and that took care of the problem.  Next time I will add more broccoli...because we love it.

Awesome!  I don't allow whole milk at my house.  Made a special trip for 2%.  Used reduced fat cream of broccoli.  Also added chives and shredded carrots.  Could use green onions instead of chives, but I grown chives in my garden.  Have made several times.

Made 1/2 batch.  Used just enough broth to cover broccoli.  Didn't have chicken broth, used vegetable broth.  The soup thickened nicely and was very tasty.  Will make again!

This recipe is grreat!  The first broccoli cheese soup I've ever made, but it's delicious. I did tweak a few things to suit our taste.  I added a little more broccoli, a carrot, and 1/2 diced onion to make it hearty.  I also decreased the chicken stock a little to make sure it wasn't watery, you can always add more if it's too thick.  Thanks for sharing!

I was trying to decide between this recipe and one that was highly rated but made with processed cheese. I chose this one because in my opinion processed cheese is too much. I'm SO glad I made this recipe. The kids looked at me like I was crazy when I told them what I was making, the next day while they were waiting for their dinner I asked if they wanted to "try the soup they said, "yes." They liked it! So this is good for the whole family. Thank you so much for sharing!

My family really liked this.  I made it for a soup buffet and added some chopped carrots for more color.  I also added more cheese.  I figure everything's better with more cheese, right?  I really liked it because I really wanted a soup that didn't use processed cheese... blech.  This one was great.  Perfect consistency and texture for us.  Thanks!

Loved it! It was easy and had a great flavor. I did add some onion powder and garlic powder and cayenne pepper to it, but other than that I didn't change anything. It turned out creamy and made a great lunch.

I really enjoyed this soup. I appreciated how simple the flavors were - onion and/or other seasonings are a nice touch, but I was looking for a true broccoli cheese soup and I am very happy with this one. I may add a bit more cheese next time, but it's a great soup with no changes. Thanks so much for sharing.

I chose this recipe because it didn't have process cheese (yuck). But, the recipe as it is was too thin.  AND I cut a cup of broth and a cup of milk.  Who likes broccoli cheese soup this thin?   It was a disappointment but a good starting point.  Next time i will try splitting the recipe and cutting the broth/milk, and adding an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.

Everyone really liked this soup a lot.  In my opinion, it was a little more brothy than I would like (I prefer broccoli cheese soup to be creamier), but the flavour was enough to make it 4 stars.  I used regular (not condensed) cream of celery soup because there was no condensed soup without toxins in it, so it's possible this had an effect on my soup, but I put extra cornstarch in it to balance it.  

Overall:  pretty good, I'll make it again.

This soup turned out great. Very thick and creamy with just the right amount of cheese. It was a little too salty so next time I will use reduced sodium chicken broth. I made a few substitutions to reduce the calories and fat, 1% milk, 98% fat free cream of celery soup, 2% shredded cheddar cheese, and 99% fat free chicken broth. My daughter is a broccoli cheese soup connoisseur and proclaimed this to be as good as any she has ever had.

I thought this was only okay.  I think the taste of the cream of celery is a little over-powering.  Maybe I'll try to make it next time with half as much and substitute with milk.

Perfect, easy and whooped Panera's Soup which is my husbands favorite!  Love that it was little to clean up and wasn't much left for leftovers~

Great *base* for this soup. I altered it (as I do just about everything). here are my changes: Chicken Bouillon cubes instead of straight broth (cubes + water), used 1% milk, took out a good portion of the broccoli after the soup was cooked and pureed it and re-introduced it to the soup, split the cheese - half American half sharp cheddar, I did not use the cornstarch, added a bit more broccoli, and finally, topped with chopped broccoli and more cheddar cheese.

What a tasty, wonderfully easy soup to prepare!  Next time I'll use low or no-salt soup because it was kind of salty, but otherwise, fantastic!

This was very good.  I only had 1 can cream of celery, so I substituted in a can of cream of chicken.  Do not do that.  You can taste the difference.  This was very good, quick, and easy.  Best of all, my little kids gobbled up the "little trees."  They even fought over who got the most broccoli.  An excellent way to convince small ones to eat broccoli!  I will definately be making this again.

This was fabulous!  I've been looking for a good broccoli cheese soup recipe, and this is it.  I substituted one can of cream of broccoli for the cream of celery, but only because that's all I had.

It was really good, but I felt like I was just enhancing Campbells soup. Instead of 2 cans of celery soup, I substituted 1 of the cans for mushroom soup. Yummy, but it still just tasted like canned soup.

I loved the taste of it!! But I had to add ALOT more cornstarch than expected. I also added some more cheese to give it more of a flavor. It was a little salty than needed. But all in all I liked it!

This soup had great flavor, but it did not get very thick and I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I don't think I will use as much chicken stock to cook the broccoli. I think that is the reason it remained thin.

Good, simple soup.  Slightly salty and the original recipe runs slightly thin, so I added a bit of cornstarch.  Very good with crusty bread.

I liked the simplicity, but it also had a salty flavor.  Still, it made a nice match for my asiago cheese bread.  Low sodium chicken broth might also cut back on the overpowering salty taste, which is why I rated it a 4 and not 5.

Not as exciting as hoped.  The cream of celery soup lended a slightly strange, and unfavorable flavor to it.  I'll look for another recipe -  good broccoli cheese soup shouldn't be too hard to come by.

Pretty good recipe.  Would have been better if I shredded block cheese rather than the pre-shredded I used. Left the soup a bit lumpy because it didn't melt well. Needed some salt.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did substitute half and half for milk, to ensure I would have a rick, creamy soup.  Also, a touch of really finely chopped red onion added an element of flavor unattained before!

This is an awesome recipe and very easy to make! I couldn't believe I had made a soup that tasted this good!  We even stuck the left-overs in the freezer, and it tasted great even a few months later!

I thought this was great.  Even my husband, the broccoli hater, liked this soup.  I used low fat chicken broth & lowfat cream of chicken soup.  Perfect!  Also added shredded carrots for looks.

I am not a cook but i used this recipe as a dinner for my boyfriend and he loved it! It was very easy and he even asked for the recipe so that he can make it. Others thought it wasn't thick enough, but i liked the texture. Very good!

This soup is excellent for a quick and easy meal.  I added some shredded carrots and extra cheese.  I also added dried parsley and chopped onions.  This gave it a great kick.  I will definitely be making this again.  My daughter loved it too.

This is a great soup because it is super easy to prepare and great tasting.  My only complaint is that the cream of celery soup seemed to overwhelm the flavor.  Next time I will try with cream of broccoli or chicken maybe?  Has anyone else used different flavored soups with better results?  Thanks for a wonderful and easy soup!

This was a super easy, really good recipe.  I did add more cheese than the recipe called for, but only because we LOVE cheese!  I will definately be making this recipe again.  Especially when broccoli is on sale!
