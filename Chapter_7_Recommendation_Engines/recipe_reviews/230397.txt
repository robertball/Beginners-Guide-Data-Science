Even my very picky eater husband enjoyed this recipe, with a few tweeks. Instead of kale, I used spinach. I used shredded carrots and cut the almonds in half. I used lemon infused olive oil. I chopped the dried cranberries and celery. It was delicious right after I made it and just as good cold as left overs. Next time I will make the full batch for more leftovers.

Very yummy. It is fresh tasting and I liked the combo of mint, cranberries and onion strangely enough. I chopped up all of the vegetables very small and it was delcious. My friend agreed.

This was very different and unusual.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it but we weren't sure if it was a salad or main dish, or if it should be eaten hot or cold.  We ate this for dinner one night and used the remainder as a side dish the following night. I thought it tasted the best when eaten at room temperature.  Don't skip the lemon zest, the zest seemed to unify all the other ingredients,

I have to admit, at first I wasn't too impressed but after the flavors had a chance to meld overnight --MMMMMmmmm!!!  For this reason, I would recommend making it the day before you plan to serve it.  I didn't use kale or tomatoes (mostly because I don't like them) but the carrots, nuts, cranberries, and the fresh mint, mixed with lemon and seasonings.. this is a keeper for sure. Makes me think that spring and summer are on their way!  Keeps well in the fridge too.  Thank so you much Conner; your taste buds are right on the money!

Wow! This was amazing! So good! I am impressed that someone so young has such a refined palate. It was a bit of trouble to cut up and add so many ingredients, but well worth it. I used Inca red quinoa and Roma tomatoes because that is what I had. Thanks for sharing your fantastic recipe.

I have been LOVING the quinoa salads I have been making from this site.  Great healthy summer meals!  As I was assembling this salad I was thinking to myself..."there is no way my family will eat this" as some of the ingredients seem like weird parings but I was WRONG...this was really yummy!  My Hubs had 2 servings and my 3yr old ate a big serving too.  I think I like the Mediterranean quinoa and the quinoa tabbouleh recipes from this site a little better, hence the 4 stars, but this is really good and I will definitely be making it again!

It was super easy with lots of flavor.  I followed the recipe to a tee and will make this dish over and over again.  The crunch from the almonds and carrots gave it that extra kick; I couldn't really taste the celery which is fine.

I had to make a salad for work one night with what I had on hand so I had to tweek this a bit. I used cranraisins instead of cranberries with great results.  I also omitted the tomato or celery because I didn't have on hand and frankly it didn't need it. I also didn't have lemon so I made a dressing of white wine vinegar, olive oil and honey.  I used dried mint instead of fresh and added twice as much kale.  Had everyone ask for the recipe and had to make it again a couple days later  just for myself, as it was so good.

It takes a lot for me to like veggies, but I'm trying to eat healthier and this recipe is AMAZING!  I used 1/2 the olive oil and lime instead of lemon since that is what I had.  I think this is my favorite quinoa recipe to date.  Try it!

So good! First time trying quinoa and kale, and everyone in my family loves it! I put a little bit on top of salad greens with some sliced turkey breast and it makes the BEST salad I've ever had. I love that something so healthy is so tasty.

I didn't know what to do with Kale.  Then I found this recipe.  The flavors all compliment one another.  I didn't think I would like Kale until I tried this recipe.  Fabulous and different.  A hit in my family.

This ended up being more work than expected but was a refreshing, unique salad.  I subbed spinach for the kale.

This was great, especially for a hot summer meal. I added in lentils, extra spice, more herbs and used lettuce instead of kale. Used regular onions as I didn't have any shallots.

This recipe was a wonderful surprise!  I thought I didn't like quinoa!  Fresh, bright and yummy!  Even my picky husband had two helpings!  We had fresh mint, fresh kale, fresh lemon on hand and after tasting this I don't recommend using anything else.  We changed only the onion to minced red onions (which we had on hand) and added some fresh peas from our garden.  Can't wait to have for lunch tomorrow.  Because there is so little cooking, it is the perfect summer dish.  And so nutritious!  Thank you for a way to eat quinoa that everyone will enjoy!

Loved this recipe!  Can't wait to make it again.  Very light and flavorful!  I loved the mint and lemon together.  I did add a little more olive oil because the Quinoa really absorbs the olive oil and the lemon juice.  FANTASTIC!

Excellent quinoa recipe...only thing I changed was 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 2. If you leave it covered, there will definitely still be broth left after 13 minutes. I was a little bummed that I didn't realize it in the first place because I need that broth for something else. Wonderful quinoa recipe though, with a diversity of textures and flavors, much better than the cilantro lime quinoa I made last week.

This was excellent. I added extra kale because I wanted a little more green than quinoa. I also added about 2 tablespoons of EVOO.  My 2 teen girls and husband loved it to. So fresh tasting with fresh mint and lemon juice and zest. This is a keeper!

Love it. Took this to a potluck and people I didn't even know sought me out to ask about the recipe. The kale didn't look as fresh, so I used spinach and it was terrific.. Takes a while to chop everything, so it's not a 5 minute salad but worth it if you plan the time.

Didn't have scallion to put in but either scallion or red or sweet yellow onion would be good. I actually really liked it without. Seemed like an odd combination of flavors, but I was looking for a recipe that used what I had in the house. It was delicious! I can tell it will be even better tomorrow.

I have made this over and over, and it is so easy and delicious just how it's written. I add shredded chicken to make it a meal. I take it with me every time I go camping, and I've found it stays good for about 3 days.

I doubled the amount of kale, and it was perfect.  LOVE this salad.  Make a bigger batch and just leave the tomatoes separate... mix them together when you serve (keeps the tomato from making the leaves soggy).  ALSO - I always wash and toast my quinoa before cooking.  Recipe doesn't say to do this, but it does make it better tasting.

This was fantastic.  I made this for Thanksgiving, and it got rave reviews.  It was a beautiful looking salad just packed with flavors!  I made the quinoa the day before assembling the salad and chilled it in the refrigerator overnight.  I started with about 8 cups of chopped kale (a big salad bowl full) instead of just 1 cup but left the mint at 1/2 cup, which was plenty of mint.  I omitted the celery and carrot- they seemed out of place to me but probably would have been fine in there.  I forgot the scallion but didn't miss it.  I doubled the dried cranberries and the almonds- I used lightly salted oven roasted almonds and left them whole.  I also doubled the lemon juice.  Absolutely delicious and stunning on the Thanksgiving table.  Thanks!  I will use this again and again!

LOVED this recipe! Added some chicken and served it for a ladies church dinner.  Substituted lime for the lemon.

Made this for my dinner club.  Theme was "twigs and berries" aka cranberry and mint.  This recipe was a hit all around!
