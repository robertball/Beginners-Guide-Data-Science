Follow my train of thought here: When you go to a nice restaurant and the waiter describes the "soup of the day," it's this stuff that he is talking about.  The consistency and flavor have the appearance of a four or five star restaurant!  I used fresh basil out of our herb garden and fresh Roma tomatoes.  I didn't bother to peel the tomatoes.  Why?  The recipe could not have been any better.  Yes, it is fattening.  Yes, it could be made healthy.  But NO!  Don't do it! If anybody ever ask for homemade tomato soup of any kind, let this be the definitive one; it would be hard to do better.

This recipe was excellent!!  A restaurant near my house makes the best Tomato Basil soup, so I was looking for a recipe to imitate theirs.  I would recommend only blending 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup, leaving some chuncks gives it a nice consistancy.  Also pealing and seeding is not a necessity.  I did it the first time and not the second time and could not tell the differece. Also if your in hurry canned tomatoes work well as a substitute. Dont skimp on the basil, thats what makes it wonderful. Overall A++ a really great soup for any occasion.

I loved this soup!!! I did not peel the tomatoes, just seeded them. I cut the cream in half as suggested by others & only used about  1/3 of a cup of butter. Since I am always on the lookout to make recipes healthier, next time I will decrease the butter to 1/4 cup & use half & half instead of cream & see if it alters the taste any. I did increase the basil some (practically butchered my little basil starter plants but it was worth it) & I garnished the soup w/ a slice of fresh mozzarella cheese & a sprig of basil. I served this al fresco on my patio w/ a salad & a glass of white merlot...just like dining at LaMadeline's!

The longer you let the tomatoes and juice simmer before adding the cream, the more intense flavor you will have.  The first time I made this I used fresh roma tomatoes.  I'll never do that again in January!  I used petite diced tomatoes the next time and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the juice while it simmered.  I let the soup simmer for 4 hours and it was to die for!  Now I can have the soup without going to La Madel...

So good I nearly passed out!  My husband and I had a tomato-basil soup at a restaurant here in San Antonio and I've been looking for a recipe to duplicate it...this is it!  Don't fuss over peeling those tomatoes!  I used 6 tomatoes on the vine and using tongs, held them by the vine in boiling water until the skins split.  The skin will slip right off.  Thank you, Holly, for a "keeper"!

I simmered two cans of Scalfani crushed San Marzano tomatoes, and a no-salt tomato juice, and about two teaspoons of sea salt, then strained it through a china cap and pureed the daylights out of it and the basil leaves.  The result at that point was a wonderfully fresh and vibrant soup.

I should've stopped there.

I added the butter, and slowly added the cream, stopping to taste after about 1/3 of a cup.  The vibrancy of the basil was totally gone, and the zip of the tomatoes was much diminished.  I stopped adding cream and added salt, pepper, and lemon juice to try to jazz up what I'd ruined.

I'd suggest omitting the cream, cutting the butter in half, and increasing the basil by a third.  If you insist on all the cream and butter, I'd about triple the basil.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this with our wraps and it made for a light, but satisfying meal. I blanched the tomatoes for about 30 seconds to remove the peel, but didn't bother with seeding them.  And my trusty little immersion blender made quick work of pureeing this soup. Because this calls for fresh tomatoes, only the reddest and ripest should be used for best flavor. If those aren't available, it would be better to substitute canned. I made half the recipe, which was just right for the two of us (considering that hubby liked this so much he had himself a second bowl full!)

This soup is going to taste a little sharp when you add TINNED tomatoes. The sharpness probably came from the metal of the can. Tinned tomatoes don't have nearly the amount of flavor as fresh.
I used Roma tomatoes, which were EXCELLENT for this soup.
I doubled the batch and used 64oz. of Campbells Tomato Juice.
Additionally, to add some additional flavor, I used 1 strip of center cut bacon for each tomatoe or every 4 ozs. of tomatoe juice.
I dislike cream of tomatoe soup, but this stuff is out of the world. Something about Roma tomatoes and homemade bacon bits in the soup put it over the top.
To add the bacon, take the raw bacon and cut it into pieces, then cook it. Save the grease (I know it sounds unhealthy, but it makes the soup killer). After you cook down the tomatoes and puree them, add the grease when you add the cream. Then when serving the soup, take the bacon bits and garnish the soup with them.

I've always wanted a recipe for La Madeleine's soup, and this is maybe even better (since I can tweak it to personal preference too)! For mine, I sauteed a couple of shallots and garlic cloves before adding the tomatoes and juice. I seeded them but didn't bother to peel them, and I replaced about a cup of the tomato juice with about 3/4 cup chicken stock and about 1/2 cup white wine. Also, I tasted the soup throughout cooking, and if you can't have cream and butter it is still a great tomato soup before you add them. I used maybe 2/3 of what was called for, but taste as you go and add what you like. Great base recipe!

Yummm....I have paid $9 for a jar of creamy tomato basil soup from a popular French restaurant chain here in Houston--because it was sooo good! After making this recipe, quite easily I might add, I won't be paying $9 a jar any more.  This was even better, and very creamy.  I, too, needed to add a teaspoon of sugar at the end of cooking.  But that could be just a difference in the tomatoes used.  I used roma, and the butter I used was salted.  We had a very enjoyable meal, I thank you for your recipe!!! (but my hips don't!)

I followed a few tips from past reviews and this soup turned out to be AMAZING! 1. Used a 28 oz can of diced tomatos 2. Sauted some garlic and shallots in butter (plus white wine if you have it) and added them to the tomato juice 3. Doubled the basil - you can pretty much add to taste 4. Cut the butter in half - you can always add more 5. Used a combo of half/half and whipping cream.  I made two batches and thought that the combo of the two tasted the best.  However, if I only could use one it would have been the whipping cream (the half/half was too "thin" not enough richness) 6. Simmer and Season!!!!  Time and seasoning go a long way so don't skip them! 7. If adding to a blender - do so in smaller portions otherwise the heat/pressure will blow your top right off! 8. GOOD LUCK!!!!

Oh my stars this is good!  I used a 28oz can of roasted crushed tomatoes (with liquid) and a cup of vegetable broth because I didn't have tomato juice.  I can't wait to serve this to my husband tonight.

I wish the author of the recipe had pointed out to let the soup cool before blending or to blend in small batches. "Simmer for 30 minutes. Puree the tomato mixtue" I did just that and ended up with second degree burns on my arms, even though I held the lid down on the blender and had it on low to start....Voila! Hot tomato soup everywhere...went through my thick long sleeve shirt as well as my jeans. My legs hurt but were not burned like my arms. I had enormous blisters and one year later still have scars, not to mention a tramautized teen (she knew something was wrong and when she came to help me she saw red all over a white kitchen.) Although it was painful and the kitchen was a mess I did finish making the soup.  It was so amazing, that I joked it was worth the burns. Bottom line... please be safe if you don't know what can happen with hot liquid in a blender...it will blow up on you. I know it may be common knowledge but nobody ever warned me (mother or cookbooks.) I would have given this recipe 5 stars had it warned me because yes...it really is as yummy as it's ratings.

This was really good, and after the changes I made, really healthy.  Here is what I did to make 8 servings:  I used 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes (undrained), I pureed them with the basil leaves (28 leaves) I skipped the tomato juice but added 1 cup of vegetable broth, added 1 Tbls of sugar, used 2 cups of fat free half-and-half instead of the heavy cream and I only used half the butter (I used 1/2 cup)  I'm sure that it would have been richer with the cream but I wanted a lightened up version and this was awesome!

I have been making tomato basil soup forever now, and I modified this one to give it more depth of flavor. I sauté a minced garlic clove, and then add the tomatoes. Also, if you add a pinch of sugar, it will take out the acidic tomato-y bite of the canned tomatoes. Lastly, I add a half tsp of lemon juice and the same of balsamic vinegar to round it the flavors. Works perfect every time!

This sounds really good.  I made a recipe similar to this one time for a friend and her husband.  It gave them heartburn!!  I did use cream cheese in place of the cream and had good results.  If you plan on eating this...make sure you take the TUMS with you to bed.

SOOOO, this recipe was good...but i have made some major revisions!! If you like thicker more hearty soup, then listen here. Take and onion, about 8-10 tomatoes (medium size) and a entire clove of garlic(all of them when they are attached) and turn your broiler on. Take the tomatoes, onion, whole garlic and broil for about 10-15 minutes...the garlic might need to  be in alittle longer. Now, take all the vegtables out and they should be black on top. For the onion, you can cut it in half with flat side down-skin side up. They should all be black on top. PEEL THE skin off the tomatoes and the onion. Squeez the garlic out of their skins, tomatoes and onions, then basil leaves,then add cream....PUREE! When its all mixed together then add to your pot and simmer. It might be a little hearty, if you don't like that, then strain to whatever consistency you want. I guarentee this will be the best soup you have ever had!!

I did not use tomatoe sauce, basically I made this recipe from scratch. By broiling the fresh vegtables, it makes a huge difference in the flavor of this soup.

Here in Florida we have CRISPERS restaurants and they too have Tomato Basil soup.  This recipe beats even theirs, and they have AWESOME soup!  I splurged and went to an Italian market for canned tomatoes from Italy.  I did not seed them but wished I had.  Even though the tomatoes get puree'd, I think it made it a LITTLE bitter, thus my addition of sugar.  I put the mixture in a blender and went to town, but I do NOT recommend doing that.  It comes out like V-8.   The second time I made this I left it slightly chunky and it was alot better (more flavor).  This is my first time using any fresh herb, and I was hesitant to use so many basil leaves.  But the 2nd batch I used even MORE leaves than the recipe calls for!  The basil makes this soup.  Don't forget most store-bought fresh herbs come from other countries so wash, wash, wash.  This is truly an awesome recipe.

This is the best soup EVER!!  My friends demand it every time they visit.  I only put half the butter in because it tends to make a film on top, but it is otherwise perfect.  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe!!!!!!

This soup was pretty darn good.  I wouldn't say its the best ever, but really really good.  I did have to use dried basil flakes, due to my grocery store being out of fresh basil.  I did follow other's suggestions, and boil the tomatoes to take the skin off more easily.  I also added a little sugar to take away some of the acidity.  Next time I will use fresh basil, and I think it will be excellent!!

Really, really good!  Added one more tomatoe and one more cup of juice just to make more.  No need to puree!  Taste perfect being chunky.

This recipe is so awesome and came out tasting exactly like some gourmet tomato soup I had recently at a popular restaurant! I'm a college student with a limited budget and this soup was so easy and cheap to make. I used canned tomatoes and dry basil instead of fresh and it turned out amazing. Also I used 1/2 cup of whipping cream and 1/2 the butter. Thanks Holly for this great recipe!!

I had to give this recipe five stars, even though I did agree with the other reviews about making it chunkier.  I only pureed about half the tomatoes but it was still too smooth.  However, it is STILL five stars because the recipe itself is amazing!  I used more basil (17 or so leaves) but I still will use more next time, I LOVE basil.  I also added a clove of minced garlic to the tomatoes while simmering.  This is one of my favorite soups and I have tried lower-fat versions before.  I will no longer even bother, this is IT!!!  Yes, it's high in calories and fat....BUT, fat is not the evil we once thought it to be....this soup is great for low-carb dieters.  If you do not have cholesterol issues, there's really nothing wrong with it!  This is a filling and delicious soup that is a good source of vitamins, protein, and calcium!

I used this recipe with my high school culinary students.  I cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also added two teaspoons of sugar to cut the tartness of the tomatoes we used (not ripe enough!) and it was divine.  The students loved it and have asked to make it again.

BIG fan of tomato soup here, and I've made this soup several times and like it much better than recipes containing broth.  However, I always felt something was missing and that the butter made it a little too greasy.  I experimented around, and here are additions that I think really give it a little more interest:  substitute the butter with 1/4 cup olive oil, add 1/4 cup white wine, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup chopped onion, and 2 cloves chopped garlic.  This seemed to add the perk that I was looking for.  In the future, I will try adding bacon as suggested by another user.  I bet that's the bomb!   Another tip:  if you are trying to get your kids to eat their carrots, you could add a carrot in this and no one will ever know.  ;-)

This soup came out great!!!  Word of advice:  Puree the tomatoes before putting them in the pot to simmer!!!  DO NOT PUREE THE HOT TOMATO MIXTURE!!!  I did this the first time I made this and even after I let it cool a little, the heat from the mixture in the closed blender caused the hot tomato mixture to explode!  It got all over the walls and burned me!  Other than that, this is a great recipe!  The fresh basil is an absolute MUST!

This soup is absolutely fabulous.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because as a garlic lover I think it needs some.  The first 5 or so times I've made it I've used fresh tomatoes but the last few times I've used large cans of petite diced, I can't tell a difference in taste and it really cuts down on the prep time so I think I'll stick with it.

I loved this soup.  My SO said it tasted like liquified manicotti, but still ate two bowls. :-)  I added somewhere between a teaspoon and a tablespoon of sugar to the tomatoes while they cooked.  It was very easy to make and tasted like it was from a fancy restaurant.

This soup was so gourmet.  I absolutely loved it. After I heated the tomatoes and tomato juice for 30 mins I then added about a cup of the mixture to a blender (to maintain the remaining minced tomatoes in the pot for a chunky texture), pureed it with the basil, and then added back to the soup mixture. Don't blend the basil too long because the chunkier the better for the presentation (proves that it is fresh vs. dried basil). I also added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, about half the amount of butter, and only used a half of a cup of cream.  Top with a sprinkle of fresh grated parmesan cheese and a couple of small basil leaves for an added touch.

Absolutely awesome recipe!  Don't cut down on the butter or cream, as they really make the soup!  Fresh basil is a must!!!  Also, if you love basil, then add extra!

This is a good basic recipe so I'm giving it 4 stars, but it's not getting 5 because there's no reason that this soup needs all that butter and cream. It's listed as having 45 grams of fat per serving, for goodness' sake! And for the author to suggest that it won't taste good if you make substitutions is just silly. Fat isn't the only way to introduce flavor into food. Since it's the middle of winter, I didn't bother with fresh tomatoes. I used 2-28oz cans of whole tomatoes, seeded the tomatoes and reserved the juice (this gave me plenty of juice without having to use extra). I lightly sprinkled the seeded tomatoes with brown sugar and roasted them on a baking sheet for half an hour while the reserved juice simmered on the stove. I blended the roasted tomatoes with the basil (I added about 1 cup of juice from the pot to make it easy to blend), added that to the remaining juice with a combination of condensed skim milk and heavy cream (3/4 cup of milk to 1/4 cup of cream), 3 tbsp of butter instead of the whole stick, and salt and pepper to taste. I served it with homemade honey oat bread and it was a fantastic soup - without the extra 30 or so grams of fat!

This soup was amazing!    We ate it up.  I did change a few things 1) I sauteed a little garlic and half of an onion in extra virgin olive oil for about 5 minutes, 2) I added two big cans of chopped tomatoes  and a large portion of basil leaves and brought them to a boil, reduced the heat and simmered for an hour 3) I didn't have any tomato juice, but I did have to add some veggie stock.  4)  Instead of heavy whipping cream I used fat free half and half.  There is no doubt that the heavy cream tastes better, but it also adds a tremendous amount of fat to a delicious meal--the fat free half/half tastes great, there is just a definite difference.  I also added just a few tablespoons of reduced fat butter.  My boyfriend and I ate it up with grilled cheese sandwiches.

Excellent!!  I just made this soup and it came out perfect.  I used 2 28oz cans whole tomatoes with the juice and skipped the fresh tomatoes and juice.  I added about 20 basil leaves, a pinch of sugar, 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 stick of butter.  I will definetly make this again.

I am sorry to say that this soup is way to heavy on the cream,butter and basil.
They all need to be cut in in half. This is a good starting point if your  looking to creat your own tomato soup.
This is my opinion but this soup does not tast like tomatos. Just cream and butter.

I made this tonight as I was looking for some comfort food, this was absolutely delicious! I just used 2 quart jars of my canned tomatoes in their juice instead of the fresh tomatoes and juice. My husband and son were very pleased with it, as was I. I did use half and half and it turned out just fine. I paired this with grilled cheese that had cooked bacon and sliced tomatoes in between the cheese slices.

While the chef is correct, substitutions will take away from the quality of the soup, let's just go ahead and admit that 45 grams of fat in one serving of soup is excessive. Of course a splurge here and there won't hurt! BUT...for those of us who are always battling a bulge, or like me (pregnant and craving creamy tomato basil soup), substituting fat free half and half and adding a quarter cup of sugar works. As a matter of fact, it's pretty spectacular. (I kept the butter). No, not as rich and tasty as the real thing, but my arteries and butt are thanking me for concocting a heart friendlier version that I would gladly serve to friends and family.

This soup is restaurant quality even with the  changes I made. Tomatoes on the vine and fresh basil are a little pricey where I live so I decided to buy fresh basil and use three 15oz cans crushed tomatoes. I completely forgot the tomato juice but I think the juice from the canned tomatoes worked just fine. I sauteed chopped sweet onion and minced garlic in about a tablespoon of olive oil before adding the tomatoes. I used half and half instead of cream and only used 1/4 cup butter. I also added a couple of teaspoons sugar because the soup was a little acidic and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for spice. I had soup and sandwiches for lunch all week long and loved it. I'll be making another pot of soup on Monday.

I'm not sure how to rate this because I modified it considerably and it was perfect.  I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes, I omitted the butter entirely and added only a few spoons of cream and it was light, and tasted like fresh tomatoes, not cream.

Wonderful tomato soup!Very fresh tasting and rich.
This recipe is almost identical to "La Madeleine's" recipe which ran in a Fort Worth,Texas newspaper several years ago.
It stated to use 4 cups chopped tomatoes, 1/4 tsp. cracked black pepper, and listed lemon juice as optional. 
I used 4 large tomatoes which gave me the 4 cups I needed.I also added 1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper and just a touch of lemon juice.Perfect!!!Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This was very good and flavorful. To more easily peel the tomatos, put them in boiling water for a minute or so and then immediately put them in ice water. The skin will slide off.

I took others advice & also my  own "tweaking": fried a few slices of bacon; crumbled it and put on top of ea. serving; used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 (1 cup), substituted 4 T. of I Can't Believe it's Not Butter spray inst of 1 c. butter; added 1 can paste & substituted 2 qts.homemade canned tomatoes. Yummy & LOW fat! Husband loved it.  A "keeper"

I altered the recipe and used one 28oz crushed tomatoes and 3, 14oz diced tomatoes including the juice from all. No tomato juice needed. I added 2 cans of tomato paste as well. I blended 1 can of the diced tomatoes, fresh basil, 3/4 of an onion and 2 cloves of garlic and added that to the tomatoes.  I also added 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese, cut back on the cream by 1/2 cup and only added 1/4c butter. It was AMAZING!!!  I broiled some provolone cheese on a baguette and everyone was raving about dinner tonight. Cannot wait for leftovers tomorrow.

I love this soup!!! I'm not a big fan of pureed soups so I leave the skin on the tomatoes and skip the food processor step, that way they stay together and add substance to the otherwise thin soup.  My husband like meat in his soups so I just brown some hamburger with garlic & basil & pour the soup over the meat for him.  I just like it with a fresh baguette.  mmm mmm mmmmmm!

We really enjoyed this soup.  Had lots of tomatos so went looking for a way to use them.  I pureed the basil and a few of the tomatos but left some in chunks.  I just couldn't add a 1/2 cup butter.  Felt guilty adding the 1/4 cup that I did.  But ...oh it adds such nice flavor.  I plan on making this, up to adding the cream and butter, then freeze it.  Thaw it out and add cream and butter.  Think that will work out and take care of some more of these tomatos.  .....Last year I made this up to adding the cream (i use milk cuz I never have cream on hand......bet it would even be better with cream!).  I then canned it in quart jars.  Has worked great.  Love being able to grab a jar and just heat and eat.

Really delicious.  I thought it may need a little something, something... so I sauteed about a half a cup of sweet onions in a little butter before adding the tomato juice and tomatoes to simmer.  I used organic tomatoes which are generally a little smaller and so I used a few more.  The recipes calls for the tomatoes to be peeled and seeded.  WHY?  The nutritional value is in the skin and if you puree no need to worry about the extra step.  I also used organic half and half instead of heavy cream,  Ok I admit I was trying to cut a few of the calories without sacrificing too much of the rich flavor and it was a success.  My guests raved and want the recipe!!  Here you go Jules

Wow, this was great!  I've made it twice in the last week, and my family can't get enough of it!  Like other reviewers, I did substitute 2 cans diced tomatoes and 1 Tbsp. dried basil, and it still tasted wonderful.  Since I used the canned tomatoes, I reduced the tomato juice to 2 cups, and also simmered some minced garlic and onion with the tomatoes and juice before pureeing with the basil.  I used the full amount of butter and cream, and then added some sugar to taste along with the salt and pepper.  Five stars!

YUMMY!  The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup- that just seemed like too much.  I may cut down on the cream next time too.  But this was sooo good and rich!  I used tomatoes from the farmer's market, and basil from my plant.  I used 30 leaves because mine were small.  Served with focaccia bread from this site.  So good!  Oh, I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes...I removed some seeds, but not all.  The blender takes care of all of that!  ;)

What an incredible recipe!

I ate this as soup, but it would also be wonderful as a sauce over pasta or chicken.  

This is just as good as any restaurant soup, if not better.

Edit--I finally experimented with using this soup as a sauce over chicken and pasta and it worked out wonderfully.

The difference between using fresh vs. canned tomatoes is negligable compared to the amount of work that goes into peeling and seeding the fresh ones.  I bought canned, whole, skinless tomatoes the last time I made it and they were fine.

I am not a big soup fan, but this one I love!! It came out perfect, unfortunately this time I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried but I don't think it even needs it. I didn't puree the tomatoes completely. I love that tomato taste it has. With the right amount of salt and pepper in it. Its amazing!!!!!! Definitely a keeper and will start eating it more often :D

This was my first attempt at soup; made this last week with some grilled cheese croutons--basically made a grilled cheese, cut it up into 16 squares, baked for a bit, and served them in the soup--and received rave reviews.  Per other reviewers, did not peel tomatoes first but that jammed up my immersion blender; will peel next time. Thanks to OP and other reviewers.

Love this version.  I usually use half and half instead of full fat cream and the taste is just as remarkable!  This time I cut the butter by 4 Tbls and omitted the cream altogether.  I intended on using 1% as a test, but it tasted so good and was a great texture already, I just stopped right there.  I didn't add any salt but the tomatoes from a can have some and then my butter had some so it was borderline too much.  You may consider using no salt butter instead.  Thanks Marbalet!

This was delicious. I did make a few changes though. I used a large can of whole peeled tomatoes (these I seeded. I have made this soup a couple times in the past and leaving the seeds in makes for bitter bites.) I also added a can of diced tomatoes for good measure. I used whole milk instead of cream because of what I had in the fridge. And I used dried basil instead of fresh. It really came out spectacular. With a grilled cheese sandwich? Nothing better.

EXCELLENT SOUP!  We used half the amount of butter so it wouldn't be so fattening, and it was still incredibly rich.  Next time, we might use less cream as well.  Otherwise, it was perfect with crusty bread.  Very filling and perfect for a cold winter night.  The perfect comfort food.

I use evaporated milk instead of cream; reduces fat and gives the soup a thick and creamy consistency - try it you'll be surprised how good it is. Got this trick from a French restaurant.

Great soup, once I didn't have tom. juice and another I didn't have whipping cream.  I searched for substit: 1 C Wh. cream= 1/3 c melted butter + 3/4 c milk. Since others commented on richness the site also gave a sub for 1 C light wh.cream - 3 Tbl. melted butter +3/4 milk. (light version was plenty rich enough) 3 C of Tomato juice = 2 1/2 c h2O + 6 oz tomato paste.  When I used the substit. the recipe still came out great tasting!

The flavor was excellent, but I thought the soup could have been thicker.  I think that I'll cut back the tomatoe juice by a cup next time.

This is La Madeleine's recipe as well. It is excellent! It makes way more than 4 servings though and can be difficult to manage in such a large quantity. I always cut the recipe in half and use canned crushed tomatoes if the real ones are not in season. Good tomatoes can make the difference in a good soup.

Holly,
This was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!  I read most all of the reviews and decided to make the recipe just as it is.  When it came to the point to add the heavy whipping cream and butter, I thought maybe that was too much butter. And I never skimp on the butter, but after the cream was stirred in and the butter was half melted, it tasted perfect, so I took out half the butter. I also added a pinch of sugar b/c my tomatoes were not that sweet.  I will most definitely make this again!!!!

This is a very quick recipe for such a savory soup. I did make the lower cal/fat version by using light whipping cream and low sodium tomato juice...I couldn't even tell the difference. Also, I like my soup a little more chunky so I only pureed 1/2 of the soup. And fresh basil is a must!

I love this recipe because it's easy to make, but it tastes just like the recipe at a high end restaurant I used to work at. To make it more of a meal, I add 1 lb. of shredded cooked chicken breast and serve it over riso pasta. I also use fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream to make it lighter.

WOW.  Despite all the good reviews, I was hesitant to make this recipe because it seemed too simple.  I am sure glad I made it though, it is by far the best tomato soup I've had.  Unsalted butter worked very well, I'd recommend using that.  The whole thing took under an hour to make!  I will definitely be making this again, maybe on a weekly basis!

I didn't want to mess with peeling tomatoes, so I used two cans of whole peeled tomatoes(It is more than the recipie called for but it worked). I drained, seeded and diced them before adding them to the juice.  I also added garlic (~3 cloves) and some basil to the toms and juice per another review.  It was so easy and fabulous. I added it to my favorite list.

Made garlic naan with this soup - delish! I bought Target's tomato juice and used fresh ground pepper and sea salt. If you don't have an immersion blender, then ladle into a blender. You'll have to double the recipe, because it will be lapped up in no time! I generously poured the cream, and used the full stick of butter, and didn't find it too rich. The kick comes from the basil, which in my case, was fresh picked and quite minty. It is just tart enough to remind you it has a load of vitamin C, but still  be enjoyable. BTW - don't follow the advice of the reviewers who put the entire tomato without removing the seeds, unless you like chewing through seed pieces in every spoonful.

In a word: sensational!  I love the perfect tomato basil soup and this fit the bill in terms of flavor and richness.  I don't care about the whipping cream and butter, some things are just worth it.  And this soup is!

To peel tomotoes, score bottom, place in boiling water for 30 sec and then place in cold water.  I used half-and-half instead of the cream, and only used 1/4 cup butter.  It turned out great.  

UPDATE: I double this recipe all the time.  I use two cans of large diced tomatoes to save time on peeling.  Still tastes wonderful.  This is in our regular weekly line-up for dinners.

Waaay to rich as the recipe is. You must modify to make it better. Do as others say, cut the cream in half, add more basil, be careful with your salt and make sure that you have in-season ripened tomatoes to make this good.

LOVE THIS!  I used fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream... Was fantastic!  I don't even want to know what it tastes like with the heavy cream because I don't need the fat/calories.  So if I'm happy with it made with FF 1/2 & 1/2 so be it.  Also the family loved it with grilled cheese sandwiches.  The youngest complained but he is the pickiest!  My hubby, 3 sons & myself love this!  Will make this a couple times a month in the winter!  Thanks!

Wasn't impressed by this recipe at all. It was WAY too creamy and heavy. Followed recipe exactly. Disappointing.

This soup was GREAT!!  I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will:  Add onion, and garlic.  Also, I will HALVE THE BUTTER.  I made the recipe exactly as stated the first time (well, I doubled the recipe and tripled the tomatoes-- also used fresh "on-vine" from Safeway... best I could afford).  It was so rich, and we felt guilty with the almost 50g of fat per bowl!  I think the soup will be just as good with half the butter, and next time I will try half the cream as well.  This is a KEEPER!

This is a great basic tomato soup recipe.  I don't really like creamy dishes, so I should've skipped the last step.  However, the soup prior to the addition of butter and cream was excellent.  I will make it like that for now on.  Thank you.

I love tomato soup and this was better than any kind I had from the restaurant. I like it chunky so after accidentally blending all the tomatoes I added a can of chopped tomatoes and it was delicious. I also couldn't find fresh basil so I just used dry basil and it was still great!

This is the best type of recipe. 
In my experience, simple ingredients of the highest quality produce the very best results, and that is what is offered here. 
This soup, therefore, is best when fresh local organic tomatoes that are allowed to ripen on the vine are used, because the dominant taste comes from the tomatoes.
However, sometimes one just can't wait for summer for tomato basil soup! When I must use canned or tinned tomatoes, I add the seasoning mix that one typically adds to pork to make italian sausage, which takes the edge off the "tin" flavor  and really beefs up the texture and feel of the soup.
Thank you, Marbalet- what a wonderful recipe!

Ouch.  I burnt myself 3 times making this soup.  Honestly, I didn't  like the flavor of the soup anyways.  I followed the recipe and tried to puree the soup and it splattered..OUCH..three times.  Regardless of that I would MUCH rather have a can of Campbell's made with heavy whipping cream MUCH CREAMIER AND BETTER.

I read reviews and had high hopes for this soup.  I made it as as described, but sauted 2 cloves garlic and 2 shallots in 1tbsp butter first (as previous reviewers suggested).  I thought it tasted like tomato juice with basil and cream.  I like to control the amount of salt in recipes, and there is just too much salt in tomato juice.  I made this again, but instead of tomato juice, I used 4 cups of canned tomatoes (no salt added).  Because you blend it at the end, it has a thick consistency but tastes so much better (you can add more salt at the end depending on your preferences).

I loved the idea of a creamy tomato soup at home that is similar to my fave luncheon hot spot, wthout the price! Your recipe was a great start for me, but I wasn't able to make it to the grocer for fresh tomatos and wanted to make it a bit healthier. I'm certain the recipe is wonderful as-is, but I deviated quite a bit: I used a large (dbl) can of diced tomato, 1 can of tomato soup. I cooked on med-low for 30 min, then pureed in the blender. I then returned to pan and whipped in 1/2 c of whipping cream, 1/4 c of 2% milk, 1/4 tsp of basil, 1/4 tsp of minced garlic, and a dash of crushed red pepper. I cooked it for about 30 more mins. on med-low. It served the 3 of us well and my boyfriend excitedly took the leftovers to work the next day. He wants to know when I'll be making it again!

This is a wonderful recipe for a great tasting and easy to prepare soup.  I'm always looking for recipes that I can throw in the crock pot and this one is easily done to accomodate that.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed about a half of a large vidalia onion with olive oil, and one clove of fresh garlic and added  some white wine once the onion was translucent.  I then added the basil that I had chopped for the last 2 minutes of sauteeing.  I pureed this all together with the remaining ingredients.  I used one can 28 oz diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes.  Much easier for me!  The result was a rich, tangy and satisfying soup.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper to the onion mixture before pureeing for a bit of a bite.  This is a great soup and you can easily adjust the recipe to suit your own taste.

Oh. My. Goodness. This soup is to die for! Whenever I make it, I have to hand out the recipe left and right.  It is kind of hard to understand how much basil to use exactly because the leaves are all different sizes. If you puree it separately with a little tomato juice, you can add it to taste separately.

This soup is the best tomato soup I have ever tasted.  Be sure to use nice tomatoes (I use vine-ripened tomatoes).  The fresh basil gives this soup its wonderful flavor.  If you love basil you will love this soup. I pureed about 1/2 of the soup instead of all of it, which was perfect.  I read other reviews and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and the cream to 1/2 cup. Thank you for the recipe, it is 100 times better than anything you get in a can.

Terrific recipe! I used 1/2 of the butter and 1 large can of Cento San Marzano whole tomatoes and this soup came out perfect. The San Marzano tomatoes are expensive but well worth it.I will definitely make this soup again. It truly deserves 5 stars.

Even though Holly told us not to, I substituted half & half for heavy cream; and used half the quantity of butter.  I'm too old to be able to get rid of that fat that will gather at my belly.  :-)  I also added a garlic clove.  That said, this soup is just great.  I lived in Texas for awhile and there is a great small chain restaurant there called La Madeleines that serves the best tomato basil soup ever!  And this is right up there with it.  I served this with shredded parmesan and caesar croutons.  Divine!  Thanks for sharing this with us, Holly!

Really good, although I did make a few adjustments and will probably make more in the future.  First, I used 2 28 oz cans of diced tomatoes (undrained) as per another reviewer's suggestion.  That worked out fine, and I'll probably make the soup that way even when it isn't winter.  Secondly, I cut down on the butter by about half, and I might cut it even further next time.  Lastly, the soup was a little too creamy for my tastes (I like my tomato soup more red than pink) so next time I might just use half-and-half or reduce the amount of heavy cream.  I also doubled the basil.  Otherwise, excellent!

After reading everyone else's reviews, I expected this to be a good soup, but what I got was beyond any expectations!!!  This soup was amazing!  Simple to make, but at the same time it looks and tastes like I must have spent hours working on complicated steps.  I was trying to replicate a soup that had chunks of tomato in it, so I only pureed half of the tomato mixture with the basil.  The only part of making this soup that seemed at all tedious was peeling and seeding the tomatos.  Next time I'll probably try it with canned tomatos since vertually all of the "freshness" gets cooked out of them anyway.  Thanks holly for a wonderful recipe!  I'll probably be making this regularly now, and I've even considered starting to grow basil.

I made this for my boss and his wife who requested a tomato basil soup for dinner, I  accompanied the soup  with Parmesan crisps, and French baguette -this meal got many raves - they said it was something that you would be served in a fine dining restaurant. ( and they would know)
I did not change a thing followed the recipe to a T, try it you will not be disappointed.

I wanted to put my new Vitamix to the test, so I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes.  I used Romas because they were on sale at the Farmer's Market and doubled the recipe.  After I blended (and the Vitamix passed with flying colours - no peeling or seeding needed) I found that the soup was a little lacking. I added 6 Tablespoons of sugar and this evened it out nicely.  Everything else about the recipe was perfect.  It definitely wowed some dinner guests.

Watch your salt on this!! Tomato juice, butter, and if you use them: canned tomatoes (they are WONDERFUL!) can add up to so much sodium, it'll preserve your insides. My fresh basil wasn't so fresh, as I discovered, so I added lots of dried. It's a VERY good recipe! I even added a smidge of Dijon mustard (I do that with ALL my soups and - this included - took it over the top.

Next time, it's low sodium juices and unsalted butter, then salt as needed, but all else remains the same. YUM!

Exactly as written, but didn't seed or peel tomatoes.  So good!  The freshness and richness at the same time make this perfect for company and the simplicity makes it perfect for anytime (although the calories deem it special)

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I have been making this almost weekly because I can't get enough of it. I adjusted the recipe to use a large can of tomato juice (48oz) and 6-7 roma tomatoes, seeded not peeled and about 20+ basil leaves. I still only use 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup butter.

Recommend Trader Joes Gorganzola Cheese Crackers for an added flavor boost.

Pretty good.... While tomato soup has never been a favorite of mine, I find that I can tolerate it sometimes. Although not as good as some tomato soups I've tried, this was decent and something that I'd consider making again. The butter and cream definitely take this over the top and add a silky texture that just can't be rivaled (so don't skimp!). Having said this, I did detect the slightest tinny taste in my soup. Had I not used canned tomato juice, this might not have been an issue. I suggest purchasing bottled tomato juice to be safe (but that's just me). NOTE: I followed HONEY-BEE's advice and blanched vine-ripened tomatoes, using tongs to hold them "by the vine" until the skins split. It took only minutes for my tomatoes to cool at which point I was able to peel (easy breezy), seed and chop them. Serving bowlfuls topped with homemade focaccia croutons made this extra special. Aiago cheese bread (purchased from my local Panera) was a perfect accompainment. Thanks for sharing, MARBALET! :-)

I made a super big triple batch of this soup this afternoon using roma tomatoes. The only change I made was use two cups of whipping cream and one cup half and half (instead of three cups whipping cream). Rich and delicious!! Will definitely be a keeper!

This recipe made the perfect tomato basil soup- like others said, nice restaurant quality. However, I used about half the butter it called for and used 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk because I don't like soups that taste super heavy. It was still creamy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times now following the recipe exactly and it is fantastic! The first couple of times I did not peel the tomatoes but my Ninja blender always left some peel behind so now I peel and it is much better. So unless you have a Vitamix, I would recommend peeling. Several people have mentioned it being fattening but I live a low carb lifestyle and have lost 22 lbs while enjoying this delicious soup! I always use fresh ingredients. I might have to try using organic canned tomatoes though so I can have it more often as peeling and seeding can be time consuming.

UPDATE: It's equally fantastic and much less time consuming using canned tomatoes (I used fire roasted) and a hand held immersion blender.

Like other reviewers suggested, I cut down on the butter and cream and upped the tomato and basil and added a little garlic. Even with less fat, it's still rich and creamy and sooo delicious. Fantastic! Also, instead of tomato juice I used tomato paste mixed with water. Will make this again!

This recipe is a great base recipe, but here are my changes. While simmering, I added about a tablespoon of dried oregano, 1/2 tablespoon of dried thyme, and 1/4 tablespoon of dried basil. I also pureed 1/2 to 1/4 of an onion. I pureed the fresh basil separate. After mixing everything together with the cream and butter, I found that it was not super tomato tasting, so added an additional cup of tomato juice. DO NOT ADD ANY SALT!!! The butter is enough!

I used tomatoes and basil from my garden.  This was very good!  I had to add about 1/4 cup of sugar because it was quite sour and I knew my kids and husband would not eat it without the sugar...

This is a very delicious recipe and easy to make. I added just a tiny bit of baking soda to regulate the sour taste caused by the acidity of the tomatoes. Be careful though, too much baking soda can overpower the flavor, you want to add just a pinch at a time until you see the tomato foaming. This will also sweeten the soup naturally without having to add sugar. I've made this recipe several times... it's awesome!

What a nice recipe! My only advice is if you use half and half, so it doesn't curdle heat it up a bit first. Also, never ever substitute dry basil for the fresh one!

An excellent creamy tomato soup recipe! Although, we made it with some variations. First, We reduced the amount of whipping cream to half a cup (It was still creamy) and second, we threw in fresh plump tomatoes and didn't bother to seed or peel them at all. The blender did the magic and everything came out great! Thanks for sharing!

The best I ever had!!!!!!  Just like a great pricy restaurant.  I also added cilantro flakes as I only had 8 basil leafs.  I also doubled this and have a freezer full of 4 pints so it is enough for eight servings!  I will be visiting my mom who is ill and stock her freezer.
I also had my bowl with a little grated chedder.  This is a great low carb soup so since I don't count fat or calories it was perfect for dinner! thank you

This was SOOO Goood. I used the petite  diced tomatoes in the can with the garlic and basil already in it. But still used the fresh basil leaves too. And I just used 2T less of the butter it says. Turned out awesome. Will be making this again.

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  I've tried others that had a ton of ingredients, but this recipe offers a simple soup.  If you don't have whipping cream you can substitute with half-n-half and butter.  I also used olive oil instead of butter. It really made the basil outstanding.

This soup was delicious! I made some minor revisions. I used one can diced tomatoes and 2 fresh roma tomatoes (didn't seed or peel). I added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 2 T. sugar to cut the acidity. I cut the butter to 6 T. and cut the cream to about 3/4 cup. I also added a dash of crushed red pepper for some kick. Yummy!

I made "6" servings of this soup, but I ended up with enough to serve at least 8. I used less butter & whipping cream and it still came out delicious and very creamy.  Here's my proportions: 6 medium to large tomatoes (didn't worry about peeling - I just seeded them),  6 cups Campbells tomato juice,  30 fresh basil leaves (approx),  1 cup heavy whipping cream,  1 stick salted butter,  few shakes of dried oregano.  This works out to about 1 tbsp butter and 1/8 cup of whipping cream per person, which really isn't that unhealthy at all. And like I said, it was plenty creamy! Oh, also, I melted some cheese on toasted poboy bread (french bread for those not from the south) and used that for dipping - it was great!

I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful.  Peeling the tomatoes was simple. just score an x in each one and place in boiling water for 1 minute.  those skins that don't just fall off will be simple to peel off.  Very simple recipe and process for the upscale outcome.

I was severely disappointed with this recipe especially considering the rave reviews.  It tastes like tomato juice with cream.  There was no real flavor or richness.  I would have done better to add cream & fresh basil to a can of condensed soup.  I was craving a heavenly tomato basil and this did NOT fit the bill.

super good. i actually would give this 4.5 stars if it would let me.  I seeded my tomatoes, but left the skin on. I simmered for about 90 minutes and used my emersion blender. super easy.  I doubled the recipe, but was able to cut back on the cream by half a cup and the butter by half a stick and it still turned out great.  I will be making this again for sure.

I made this once and followed the exact recipe.... it turned out very good. I made it a second time and decided to jazz it up a bit.... I added 1/2 white onion minced, 1 tsp minced garlic, a little Italian seasoning and cyanenne pepper. Turned out even better! YUM!!!

I have made this recipe several times now. I cannot tell the difference between the fresh and canned tomatoes. Canned tomatoes are WAY easier! I do use free basil and add plenty of pepper and some salt. I have also made this with dairy free butter and silk soy cream. It isn't as good as the original but, it allows my son to enjoy the soup!

This was to die for! I'm not even a fan of tomato soup, but I loved this one. Unfortunately, I couldn't find fresh basil the day I made this so I used about 3-4tsp. of dried. Also, I used fat free half-n-half. I'm sure its even better with the original ingredients, but its quite yummy this way too! Oh, I also added a tsp of garlic powder. I meant to add some minced garlic to the tomato mix at the beginning, but I forgot. This is soooo tasty!!

I thought this was pretty good, but the basil made it a little bitter. So I added about 1 1/2 Tbls. of sugar.

Very very good. I had to use milk instead of cream, and I also had to halve the butter. I upped the basil and used about 8 romas because mine are small. Great flavor that got a genuine compliment from DBF; thanks!

Really delicious. I had to add about a tablespoon of sugar to tone down the acidity of the tomatoes (which were probably not as yummy because they're out of season). Also followed other people's advice and sauteed two cloves garlic, 1 shallot, 1/4 c white wine, and 1 T butter until wine was reduced, then added to the simmering tomato mixture. I used fat free half n half in place of the whipping cream; and 1/3 c of butter instead of the 1/2 cup.

This is incredibly delicious!! I admit I cheated, and made it a TAD healthier. I used half and half, and only 1/4 cup butter. I can imagine how decadent this would be with the heavy cream and the full portion of butter though! I used 6 VERY ripe roma tomatoes and simmered for about 45 minutes.   I sliced up a baguette and topped the slices with shredded gruyere cheese. (tried it with mozzarella and cheddar, but gruyere was by far the best!!) Toasted the slices in the oven and served with the soup as well as a Caesar salad.   I absolutely cannot wait to make this again!

This was only okay - I should have used heavy cream instead of light, and I used canned tomatoes so I can't say for sure if it would have turned out okay if I did it right.

This is the base recipe I use but I also add one more ingredient that I think makes it even more amazing. One can of real crabmeat. It just gives it an extra oomph when you also want some protein and a little more filling to your soup. I have been making it this way for years.

I used about 24 basil leaves, and, although I LOVE butter, I used only 1/3 c butter the 2nd time I made this, and it was equally as buttery, but the basil and tomato flavors were more enhanced.  I also only pureed about 3/4 of it for some nice chunkiness.  Soooo goooood.

I love this soup!!!!  My family does too!  I use fresh tomatoes from my garden.  I run them through my KitchenAide strainer, and go from there.  Fresh basil is always best, but you can use dried basil.  I always start my soups with a roux (butter and flour) my family prefer to have a thicker soup and this always does the trick.

I dont know what i did, but the soup came out to sweet to eat. we dipped our sandwitchs in it, but could not eat it. and I forgot the sugar. I just gave it 4 stars because i think it was my fault since everyone else didnt have any of the same type of comments.

Very good, my only complaint is that 1/2 C of butter is too much (especially with the cream), next time I'll only use 1/4 C, if that.

WOWWWW.. made this with dinner just as a side, it was so good we HAD it for dinner the next day.  I used low calorie butter and it was fabulous (if you want to cut back on some of the fat).  Fresh basil is a MUST.. and I only pureed 1/2 of the mixture, just to keep the texture.  I added a tbsp minced garlic as well.. will make over and over again!

I always use one large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh - it's just easier.  This soup is great - just like LaMadeline's but better...always filling and better the next day!

I made this last night and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I made it and some mozzarella/basil/tomato grilled cheese sandwiches to dip. I used 8 small high lycopene tomatoes (and forgot to peel them) and all organic ingredients besides the tomatoes. I know there have been some complaints about the butter in the soup, but the butter actually helps the lycopene to be absorbed by one's digestive system, I suggest using a good real butter that is fresh and not to saturated with fridge smells.

So rich, delicate and delicious!  I made it with end of season tomatoes from my garden.  Yummy with toasted English muffins!

Had to make tomato juice the time-intensive way, since I forgot to buy it at the market: baked tomatoes for 20 min. @ 350, then ran them through my food mill until I had four cups of juice.  Delicious, especially since it wasn't too salty, but time-consuming. :-)

I didn't peel the tomatoes but will next time, since the bits of peel were distracting from the silky texture.  

Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been trying to find a tomato basil soup that was as good as the one they have at the Whole Foods store in Boulder, CO.  This beats that recipe.  I will use this over and over again.  The perfect soup for a snowy day (and grilled cheese sandwich to dip it in)!

Really good, really easy, really rich.  I served this at lunch with grilled cheese-wouldn't recommend that as it was WAY to much butter and too rich.  Salad on the side next time.  And there will be a next time cause it was YUMMY.

This soup was very good - I did make a few minor changes though.  I used about 1/3 of the butter the recipe calls for and actually used a hand-mixer in the pot to puree tomatoes, rather than transferring to a processor and back into the pot.  I think next time I might use a little less heavy cream as well.  All in all though, this was very tasty!  I will definitely make it again.

Wow.  I'm from Texas, home of the infamous La Madaleine's and I adore their tomato basil soup as much as anyone, but can't afford it a lot on a college student's budget.  This recipe makes up for it in spades.  I followed it exactly, but used a hand mixer instead of a blender because I like to have a slightly chunky/somewhat smooth texture.   Next time, I think I'll try Roma tomatoes, I think the slightly sweet flavor will do wonders for the soup, but this is a definite favorite.  Tastes great as leftovers, too!  I like to sprinkle some grated parmesan in the bowl with the soup, and serve it with fresh baked garlic bread or breadsticks.  It's a great, simple meal after a long day of work and classes.

I have been making this soup for about a year and it is always a hit!!  I always use two large cans of diced tomatoes and add fresh garlic and it comes out great.  I use a hand blender to puree the tomatoes because we like it a bit chunky.  Pair it with some good bread, try 'Jo's Rosemary Bread' also found on this site, and you have a gourmet meal!!

YUM!  This is so good, tastes like it's from a restaurant.  I added a little sugar to it per other reviews.  Will definitely make again.

This soup sure delivers! I doubled the recipe but reduced the butter and cream by half. I didn't even think it needed salt or pepper so I just put them on the table so my guests could add them if they wanted to. The soup was very easy to make and a great creamy taste. 
 Thanks Holly!

Rich, creamy, and velvety decadence. We loved this garnished with roasted garlic, grated romano, and baguette croutons. The flavor is even deeper if prepared a day or two ahead.

Absolutely fabulous- everybody just loved it here. Served it with some warm   biscuits. Tastes just like the tomato basil soup at a restaurant I love to eat at. Despite the warnings, I did make a few adjustments, like using canned instead of fresh tomatoes. Also, I added the cream to taste, which for me was about a half cup of cream instead of one whole cup. I recommend tasting the soup with 1/2 cup cream before adding the other half. You can always add more, but too much is harder to repair!:)

Doubled this recipe using canned peeled and diced tomatos and lot of fresh basil from our garden. I also added a slice of smoked gouda into every bowl per the recommendation below. Very nice soup - a perfect light dinner with some good crusty bread topped with parmesan and romano cheeses.

To make this healthier, I substituted olive oil for butter (conversion: 1 c butter = 3/4 olive oil) and half-and-half instead of whipping cream. It was excellent. This is an easy recipe to double, freeze half for later.

Amazing soup...or should i say tomato,basil and mushroom with chiicken penne? We used the recipe exactly the way it was, and added some mushroom puree (about 2 cups) and sauteed chicken and poured it over a plate of penne. Hats off to you Holly!

The bones of this recipe are great. I made a few changes . I omitted the 4 tomatoes and tomato juice. I added a chopped medium sweet onion (that I sautéed in the butter), 2 teaspoons of Spice World organic minced garlic,  1 Tbsp  of Cento double concentrated tomato paste, 2 cups of organic chicken stock and used one 28 oz can of SW premium crushed tomatoes in rich purée. I placed all these along with the basil and cream in the food processor; blended until smooth and then transferred to my Dutch Oven and simmered on low heat until it was hot. Absolutely delicious

THE BEST!  Since it's just early spring, I made this soup with two 28-ounce cans of San Marzano tomatoes.   I left all amounts the same as the original recipe, except that I did reduce butter (used unsalted) to 1/4 cup (half of a stick).  The amounts of Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper that worked well were 1/4 tsp. each.  It really is excellent.

I love this recipe!  I will use it over and over and over again!  I did not use a half cup of butter that just seemed like a lot. I only used a table spoon full of butter and that seemed plenty. Also I added a little more basil because I love love love basil!  A great pairing for this soup is a ceasar salad and a glass of red wine (cabernet or merlot) ENJOY!

This was not what I was expecting. It tasted like it was a base for a vodka sauce not a tomato soup. I followed the recipe to the letter. I recommend you enjoy the taste of butter more than tomato if your going to like this soup.

This recipe would have probably gotten 5 stars if I had followed the recipe exactly. I ended up having to make some substitutions because I used what I had in my kitchen without making a trip to the store. But what I made was sooooo delicious, I think I am going to make it the same every time!! I subbed fresh tomatoes for a 28 oz can of whole roasted tomatoes plus one 14 oz can of tomatoes. used one can of tomato sauce, and one can of chicken broth. added white pepper and hot red pepper flakes... oh, and I roasted a whole head of garlic in olive oil wrapped in foil for 45 minutes, and squeezed the whole thing in there.. and I mixed in about 1/4c of parmesan when adding the cream. Soooo good!!!

Incredible!  Incredible!  Incredible!  Only thing I did was half the butter and heavy cream (tastier, healthier, and saves money!).  No film if you half those two.  I also added in a teaspoon of salt.  I find that is the perfect amount.  Amazing.  I don't de-seed, and I don't take off the skin.  The tomatoes make the recipe, so get the best you can find (farmer's market preferably).  I put a dash of sugar to off set any bitterness leaving in the seeds might cause.  My vitamix made it so you couldn't tell I didn't de-seed.  Let mixture cool before putting it in blender.  Enjoy!

If I could rate it 2.5 stars I would. I followed the recipe exactly, used super fresh ingredients and the soup was still bland. High calorie, high fat, bland soup is not exactly what I had in mind when I found this recipe. I won't be making it again.

I've been trying to replicate a delicious tomato bisque that I had ages and ages ago in Salt Lake City at a place that I can't remember the name of - this comes remarkably close!!  I doubled the recipe, but left the cream and butter alone and it was amazing.  I'd like a few more chunkier tomatoes next time...but will definitely make this again.

First of all I have never left a review in my life but I thought this soup deserved it. Second of all this is the most amazing Tomato Basil soup I have ever had. I did it just like the recipe told me and didn't change one thing. And I am glad I didn't because it could not have came out any better! I will make this soup for the rest of my life!! I am still in amazement of just how great it came out!

After reading the reviews I thought this would be really amazing, but I was unimpressed. I made this with sauteed garlic, fresh tomatoes and fresh basil leaves. I did substitute half & half for the heavy whipping cream as someone suggested, and only added 1/4c of butter, but it was still WAY, WAY too much butter. Literally, you could taste hints of butter in the soup, and not in an appetizing way. If I made this again I would probably omit the butter entirely, and probably add a bit more basil.

This is an excellent recipe; I will definitely make it again. Really really good!  However I did make some modifications. Since I was trying to use up an abundance of tomatoes from our garden, for the 4 c. tomato juice I pureed enough fresh tomatoes to make 4 cups. My tomatoes are of varying sizes so I didn't count how many. Since I didn't used store bought tomato juice I added 1 tsp. salt. I didn't see the need to puree the soup mixture after the 30 minutes; the tomato chunks are kind of nice to have in there. I also did not find the quantity of basil leaves to be sufficient so I double the amount and added a 1/2 tsp. dried basil. I also added 6 cloves of chopped garlic and a 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. Served it with some mozzarella cheese on top.

This recipe is delicious.  Of course what makes it fabulous is the butter and dairy products.  It was 105 degrees outside.  I served this very very cold in coffee mugs.  Everyone loved it........even the guys who said they NEVER do cold soup.

This may be the best recipe I have found on this website.  It is so incredibly simple to make and tastes divine, especially with a grilled cheese sandwich!  I made it a number of times last summer and cannot wait for tomato season to start this year!  I agree with the others, there is absolutely no need to peel and seed the tomatoes!

DANG. That is some tasty soup. But, and I realize I'm going wildly against consensus here, I could have done with just a little less fat. I made it with the full amounts of butter and cream, and you know, maybe just a little less of one or the other (maybe both?) might have made it a little less heavy. I was uncomfortably full after a bowl. But it was deeeee-licious for sure.

Very good recipe.  I did not peel or seed the tomatoes, nor puree them, as I like the chunky flavor.

This was so good. Don't use the full amount of butter or cream. I used half of what it calls for. 1/4 c butter was even too much. Next time I will use even less butter! Another tip, peel the tomatoes like the recipe says, The skin doesn't puree. Very very good!

Am I the only person who had problems with the cream curdling?? I substituted half and half for the heavy whipping cream, but it sounds like many others have done the same without having this problem. Any suggestions? Should I heat up the half and half before pouring it into the soup? Also, if you're going to used canned tomatoes, go ahead and blend your mixture while it is still cool to avoid burning yourself and turning your kitchen into a scene from "Psycho."

After 14 years of competing in the family soup off i finally won with this soup. I made a few minor adjustments  i used half fresh plum tomatoes and half fire roasted canned tomatoes ( in jersey we don't really eat tomatoes after season) it was excellent.  Ah the thrill of victory!

I made this for dinner tonight, it was pretty easy to make. I used half a stick of butter instead of the full stick. I used double the basil and I did not blitz the mixture for too long, literally 10 seconds. I also added a clove of garlic to the tomatoes at the beginning and a dash of sugar to the soup once blitzed. 
Was bloody delicous, It was super fragrent, had a very pleasant taste to it.....Will deffo keep this recipe, a happy bunny!

I used 2 can's of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh ones once and it came out really good also. I love this soup, especially with the italian grilled cheese sandwiches. If you dip those in the soup it gives you the hint of pizza taste.

It's a great starting base to create a more complex dish. I cut the calories and added more stuff to make a totally different dish. Check out my lighter version of the creamy tomato basil soup with pasta and meatballs.

I made this recipe exactly as it is stated and I think it was way too much butter/cream!  I didnt want to waste it so I blended 4 roma tomatoes and added them to the pot.  I simmered it for an addition 30 mins and it tasted much better, but not as good as some of the other reviews say it tasted.  I wish I liked it more!

I used home canned tomatoes to make this soup.  I should have left the cream and butter out it tasted so much better with out it.  I will make this again but will leave out the cream and butter for a more robust tomato taste.

I was disappointed with this soup. I used 6 tomatoes instead of 4, and it still tasted more of cream and butter than tomato. I ended up adding some canned tomato puree. It was also very thin with a weird grainy texture. Maybe it would have been better with half the amount of cream and butter, but I probably won't try this recipe again.

I love this soup, but I made some small changes to it. First off, I use more tomatoes (7 or 5 really big ones) juice (6-7 cups), and basil (about 20). I use the same amount of butter and cream as the original recipe. I add 3 tbsp sugar, I use 1 tsp kosher salt, and pepper to taste. I cook this all together, as opposed to seasoning it when it's done. In my opinion the flavor is much better this way. I don't peal or seed the tomatoes either. Just dice it.  Everyone who's had this tomato soup, just loves it! My hubby absolutely loves it with grilled cheese sandwich. This is definitely a keeper.

Our family loved this soup!  My 8 yr old daughter had some tomato basil soup at Applebees and wanted us to try it at home. Preparing the tomatoes does take some time, but was well worth the effort.

I LOVE this soup!  I followed the directions exactly except I only had 3 tomatoes so I used them and one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with oregano and basil.  Oh, and I didn't peel the tomatoes but did seed them.  Delicious!

I should rate it 5 stars, but I cut back on the cream to save calories and the flavor was great but it was a "thin" soup.  Bet if I had followed the recipe it would have been perfect.  I'll be trying this again.

You can definitely taste the basil in this soup, so if you love basil you will like this soup.  I served it with sliced baguettes topped with cheese and broiled.  The soup was very rich.  I think it was a little too overwhelming for me, but my husband really loved it.  But he likes basil more than I do too.

This is the BEST recipe. I followed the suggestions of others by decreasing the butter to 1/3 cup and decreasing the cream to 1/2 cup. I also added oregano and 1 minced garlic clove with the basil. I garnished with a small mound of freshly shredded sharp cheddar. Fabulous!

I really like this soup. I used whole San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes. (There were a few seeds, but I didn't notice them by the end.) I also followed some other reviewer's advice and added more basil leaves (20). I thought it was fine with a 1/2 stick of butter instead of whole. Really not hard at all, and a very rich soup!

I used canned tomatoes, and this recipe was a major hit in our house. Husband declared it "restaurant quality". Thank you for sharing this!

I made this the other day and it was great!  I followed a few other suggestions and let it simmer longer than 30 minutes.  Although dried basil may do, I found the fresh basil really made the dish.  As with many dishes, having time overnight to mesh the flavors really works with this too.  Just remember when reheating not to boil the soup.

This was great! There is an Italian restaurant by my house and I've been trying to figure out the ingredients to their soup and this tastes very similar. I did add some sauteed garlc and mushrooms-yum!

Missing something.  When you go to a restaurant and have this soup it is often almost like a paste, or at least much thicker than this turned out.  Kind of like the main picture, however that's not what any of the user photos came out looking like nor mine. Also the soup itself was missing something major.  Maybe it needed cheese or something else. I can't put my finger on it, but this isn't your typical Creamy tomato basil soup.  It is kind of like when you make margaritas at home with just the tequila and the lime juice without adding triple sec there just is something not right about it something missing.  I'd look for another recipe, avoid this one.  I was really kind of shocked by this with all the great reviews.  Man if people like this soup, they would die for a real Tomato basil soup...

Taste is fabulous, exactly what I was looking for!  But seeding and cutting up a bunch of tomatoes is not so fabulous.  I will definitely make it again when I don't have so many people to cook for.  Otherwise, it's perfect!

I used a quart of home canned tomatoes with the juice and pureed that to make a half batch. I also cut the butter in half. This is the first tomato soup I have ever made or eaten since I was a child and it was tasty but I can't quite get past feeling like I'm eating sauce. I think it's just too sweet for me. I may use the leftovers on some pasta but if I made it again as soup it would probably be for company who could appreciate it more.

This was fabulous. Rich, creamy, and a nice touch of extra deep flavor from the butter and basil. Yum! The best part is that I made way too much, so I froze it, wondering if it would thaw/reheat well since it has cream in it. It was just as wonderful the second time around. Thanks!

Delicious.  Used one can diced tomatoes since only had 3 fresh, and used 1 small can v8 and 2 small cans of tomato paste for the tomato juice.  Substituted half and half for the cream.  Used an immersion blender to puree the soup.

I did not find this so out of the park as everyone else is stating just ok...I followed the recipe exactly, I guess I like a little more zip or spice to a soup..this just tastes like a tomato...well then eat one.  They are not rich, creamy or full of basil and neither was this soup.

Awesome recipe! Made it for a crowd of 20ish. Used 8 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes, 2 sticks of butter, 3 cups of fresh cream (yea, I know high fat content...lol) and Garlic, Garlic Salt, & dried basil with a few tablespoons of Agave (sugar)  Kept spicing it up until it tasted just perfect! What a hit! I am going to try it this summer with fresh tomatoes but, man! people loved it.

Yummy, but I think it would be even better with canned diced tomatoes. Those new Hunts fire roasted tomatoes would be awesome.

I was trying to recreate a soup I'd tried at a nice restaurant and thought this would work.  It was actually closer to what I was looking for before I added the cream and butter - very tangy and flavourful.  When I added the cream, I kind of felt like it became very Campbell's tomato soup-ish...Sorry - I did love it without the cream and will probably try it again that way.  Very easy to make - LOVE the basil.

Great soup! I cut the tomatoes in half, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic salt/Italian seasoning/minced onion and roast for about an hour at 200 degrees. Then I let them cool down some and peel them. Then I proceed with per the recipe. This gives it a strong tomato taste.

We did thicken it up with canned tomato soup concentrate.  We also added Parmesan cheese and more cream to it.  After all of our tweaking it did turn out very good.

This is TO DIE FOR!! Even if you're not a huge tomato soup fan, you'll love this. We puree the tomatoes completely because we don't like pieces of tomato, and it make the soup so smoot and creamy

This was very good!  Although unlike other reviewers, I don't think it requires the cream to make it so delicious.  It's the amazing flavor the basil imparts!  I will try it with milk next time to see if I can make a healthier version that still tastes great.

Yummy!  The leftovers actually tasted better because the flavors had more time to meld together.  I added more tomato juice as it tasted a little too creamy after putting in the butter and heavy cream.  I used 2 reg. tomatoes and 3 roma tomatoes and about 5 cups tomato juice.

Absolutely delicious. I did not have enough tomato juice so I substituted one cup of it with tomato paste (which also made it thicker). What really makes it great is the butter and cream, so although I was a bit uncertain whether to add all that fat or not I followed the recipe and it was well worth it! I served with grilled cheese sandwiches on a chilly Autumn night.... and that's what I call confort food!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes; some as suggested by others.  I first cooked about 1/2 a yellow onion (chopped) with 2 cloves of garlic in some olive oil in a dutch oven.  To this, I added a little dried basil, salt, pepper, and oregano.  Then, added the tomato juice.  I chose to cook this on low for about 2 1/2 hours before completing it by adding the basil and pureeing.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 and didn't miss the heavy cream.  A new favorite!

I was really excited when I found this recipe, especially after reading the reviews. However I didn't care for it as much as I'd hoped. The fresh basil was over bearing, maybe next time I will try the dried basil and just garnish with the fresh. I didn't care for the basil floating around in it, the texture was off. The basic recipe is a good one, I have done it without the basil and it was great. I topped it with a grilled garlic butter and Parmesan baguette, it was fabulous.

No fresh tomatoes, used on 14 oz. can of petite diced, drained, as suggested to me by friends on "the exchange". Added 1 tsp. lemon juice to take away from the "tinny" taste of canned tomatoes. I made no other changes. Beautiful soup the way I made it, can only imagine how it tastes with fresh toms. Can't wait to try it that way. This one's a keeper.

Absolutely fantastic soup!!!  Ever since I made it the 2nd time, one of my boys fills a couple of tupperware containers and squirrels them away for himself before anyone else can get to the pot - just to be sure he gets some!

This soup was rich and delicious, and definitely more a bisque than a soup. The cream and butter are fantastic but next time I'll leave those out--the tomato and basil combination on its own was divine!

Delicious!  Like other reviewers, I reduced the cream a bit but it was very tasty.  Beware to some that this may not all fit in your blender at once - I learned that the hard way and my kitchen looked like a crime scene!  LOL
Anyway, thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Great soup.  Following the recommendations of other reviewers I used canned, diced tomatoes and added garlic.  Delicious, I will add this to my favorite recipe list.

Delicious! Tastes just like my favorite restaurant's soup! Easy to make and makes a lot!

I made it once using fresh tomatoes but I didn't take the skins off. It was good, but probably would have been better without the skins. 

The second time I made it I used canned tomatoes (I admit it, I'm lazy and wanted a quick meal). It tasted the same with the canned tomatoes. Just as good! 

Each time I used fresh basil. That's key. Next time I think I'll try to use fresh tomatoes without the skins. 

I love it and I bet everyone you make it for will love it too!

Very delicious! I used a variety of fresh tomatoes, including green zebras and vine-grown red tomatoes from my mother-in-law's garden.  I used about 6 tomatoes, I believe, of various sizes, and I added no extra juice because my tomatoes were very juicy.  I did not peel and seed the tomatoes.  I added one small chopped onion and two cloves minced garlic.  I also probably used about twice as much basil as was called for.  After cooking everything down and blending it, I should have put it through a strainer because some of the fibrous parts of the basil did not puree.  I did taste the mixture before I added a half pint of cream and a stick of butter, and it was delicious.  But all the ingredients together were phenomenal.  Served with some crusty French bread and a garnish of grated parmesan and mozzerella, it was a very tasty, satisfying meal.

ETA: I should mention that I did let it cool somewhat before putting it in the blender; I've had past experiences with the steam building up and the blender lid blowing off!

My family loved this soup...we NEVER have leftovers!!!  I usually work late...and this is so easy and quick to make!!! I used "organic" tomato juice and Hunts peeled diced tomatoes and kept every thing else the same.  It was great with grilled cheese sandwiches!!!  Busy working Mom's this is a slam dunk buzzer beater!!!

I really enjoyed making this soup!

I did subsitute canned diced tomatos and crushed tomatos instead of the fresh- and do not at all think that it made a difference in taste or flavor.

I should have added a little minced garlic like previous reviewers suggested.  And I agree, real butter and heavy cream is a MUST!  

I served these with gourmet grilled cheese cubes, and the whole meal was a hit!

I DO NOT like tomatoes and this was FANTASTIC! As others have mentioned I used vine tomatoes and held in boiling water with tongs until the skin cracked which made the peeling super easy. Also did not seed. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is wonderful! However, I did take of the other user's ideas. I used about a 3/4 cups of the heavy cream. I also added some sauteed garlic, balsamic vinegar, a little lemon juice and about an ounce of goat cheese. My husband said this was the best soup he has ever had!

The best tomato soup ever!  Made it once and my husband loved it. He insisted on it for his BD dinner.  Took the leftovers to my mom and siblings and they all raved about it.  The fresh basil makes the soup.  The first time I made it, I used heavy cream; the second time, I had whole milk and it was still wonderful.

No joke, I have dreams about this soup. Try it and you will never make tomato soup any other way but this. Sure, it's a heart attack waiting to happen, but honestly you're more likely to die of delight first! Heaven in a bowl!

This recipe was simply amazing!  Like some other reviewers, I first sauteed some garlic and then added a pinch of sugar, some lemon juice, and some balsamic vinegar for additional flavor.  Do not skimp on the basil.  I also added much less heavy cream butter and used canned peeled tomatoes - this was simply delicious.

do not add the cream or butter! this soup simply does not need it. i cautiously added about a 1/4 cup of cream and 2 tbs of butter, and i agree whole-heartedly with previous reviews. the cream and butter completely supresses the basil and tomatoes. i also added a large clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp of both lemon juice and balsalmic vinegar -- and for protien, i added some shrimp sauteed in a bit of butter, garlic, salt, and balsalmic. i only added the shrimp for those who wanted it, after the soup was done, since not everyone is a fan of shrimp at my house :). i did seed the tomatoes, which doesn't take too long, and i used 5 tomatoes off-the-vine. after throwing everything in the food processor, the soup was very smooth -- but after adding the butter and cream i added a can of chopped tomatoes to both add chunks and reclaim the tomato flavor. i would make this again, but without butter or cream. we did really enjoy this! served with homemade french baguettes.

Just terrific.  My kids (who hate everything) loved it!  They love the tomato basil at Le Madeline and think this is as good.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added the sugar, lemon juice, garlic and balsamic.  I also used half and half instead of cream.  thanks for a great recipe! Next time I will double and freeze.

WOW! We just finished eating this soup and feel like we just ate at a fancy restaurant. I drizzled a bit of the heavy cream on top and garnished with a basil leaf and served with torn chunks of french bread. This recipe is going into our rotation of favorites!

This soup was heavenly.  I used 5 roma tomatoes from the local fruit market.  I also used a 15 giant basil leaves.  I didn't bother taking the skins off the tomatoes before hand but I did seed them.  I blended the soup with a hand-held cuisinart mixer so it left it somewhat chunky and the basil pieces could still be seen.  As for the butter and cream, I started by adding maybe just over 1/4 cup of butter, and I thought that was more than enough.  I added the creme slowly and kept tasting and probably stopped around 2/3 of a cup.  It may have tasted better with the full fat amount, but I thought it tasted amazing as it was.  The final result yielded four small bowls anyways, so it would be a great treat in moderation!

I actually changed the recipe a bit. Instead of tomato juice--it has too much sodium, I used a box of Parmalat crushed tomatoes. I used a box of Parmalat tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. In order to thicken the soup, rather than using cream, I boiled two potatoes and then pureed them with the soup. It wasn't necessary though because the soup was already thick. Next time I make it I will use the Parmalat crushed tomatoes instead of the juice, fresh tomatoes and won't use anything to thicken.

I was looking for something less buttery with more tomato taste.  But overall a good soup.  I'll keep looking but if I don't find a better recipe, yes I will make this one again.

This recipe, which I did use some substitutions, is tasty and pretty close to that of La Madeleine. 

I used half and half instead of heavy cream & half the butter. I also added some sugar since the tomatoes were canned, so it balanced the saltiness well.

Even with the substitutions, it was delish!

My husband loved it but I thought it was OK. It has good flavor but I would reduce the amount of butter and cream next time. I'm taking this soup to a bread-making party tomorrow, so I will report back my friends' feedback.

What a yummy recipe!! I've been sick lately & craving "good" tomato soup that was easy to make and I found it! Instead of 4 cups of tomato juice, I used 3 cups and 1 cup of chicken broth. I also added 1 garlic clove (diced). Great recipe!!

Oh so good!  I'm not a big soup fan (besides Cambelle's) but this was sooo delicious.  We had company over and we served this with a salad and garlic cheese biscuits.  They LOVED it.  Wanted the recipe.

I didn't peel the tomatoes.  There was a little too much basil in it.  Could be because I doubled the recipe and used about 22 leaves.  We all liked it though.  I didn't like how it reheated the next day.  It became very oily.  I'll try again with less basil.

If you're looking for a soup to serve company, this is it.  Perfection!!
I did add two chopped cloves of garlic.  Only because I love garlic.

This soup was awesome! A friend told me about this site and this soup.  I made it the next day, and even shared some with the neighbors, who now also want the recipe. I sprinkled some shredded cheese and bacon bits on top and it was like a bacon tomato sandwhich!  Great job!

I'm not much of a Tomato Soup fan, but I got in the mood one night, and this recipe had such good reviews. Well, it deserves every one of them. I actually used 21 large basil leaves, 1/2 tsp. of sugr and a hint of rosemary. The soup was delicious just served with some crusty French bread. Thanks, Holly!

I made this again last night because I loved it so much. I tried to cut the fat and used half and half instead of the heavy cream. It certainly messes up the taste and consistency! Make it with heavy cream for the delicious five star results!! It will be perfect!

Just like in a gourmet restaurant, didn't even add salt and pepper. (but did reduce the butter by half). Thanks to AllRecipes for showing how to peel a tomato so effortlessly. : )  And I made it again last night for company.  I really think half and half would be splendid as well as reducing the butter;I am trying to diet and loved it but we want to taste the fresh tomato and basil rather than be weighted down with the extra (and delish calories from heavy cream)

This recipe was quite good I did make a few changes as suggested by others, I cut down on the cream, added some dried basil in addition to the fresh and used tinned tomatoes.  I found it very sharp so had to add significant amounts of honey to sweeten it.  Might make some more changes in future too.

Yum! Decadent and easy. But what exactly is 4 tomatoes?  I used "on-the-vine" tomatoes, which are smaller than average tomatoes, so I figured to just go with a pound.  That worked well with the other ingredient amounts. Oh, and I didn't bother to peel or seed them.  I just chopped them up.  Pureeing makes it an unnecessary step, IMHO.  Next time I will try to make it a little waistline friendly though. I was told that this was a good knock-off of Le Madeleine's, but theirs is a little creamier.  So I will have to work on that, too.

Move over Cambells Tomato Soup, this one is better.  I used light cream instead and will cut down on the butter by half the amount.  Taste better couple days after making and top with more fresh basil.

For years I've been looking for a simple tomato soup recipe that doesn't involve onions, garlic, potatoes, you name it. This is it.  It's incredible.  Obviously it is very rich and a little will do you, but I also tried cutting down on the butter and whip cream the second time I made it and that was great,too.  Thanks for ending my search!

This was a great recipe.  It was smooth and creamy.  I personally thought it had a little too much cream and butter, so next time I make it I will cut back to like 1/4 c butter and 3/4 c. cream. On the other hand, my mom thought it was great just as it was.  I would suggest adding about half of the cream/butter then tasting and add more if your tastes say to.

Very nummy if all the calories are worth it to you.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, used nice vine-ripened tomatoes.  Still had to add 1 or 2 teaspoons of sugar to make it less sour.  Cut the amount of butter in half, tasted just fine! Served it with Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwiches from this site- it was a perfect complement!

Tomato Basil soup is one of my very favorites so I was very excited to find this recipe! I've shortened the recommended cooking times and this takes me an *easy* total of about 30 mins to make. It also freezes well! I serve it with sourdough rounds and caesar salad.. YUM!

I've made this recipe many times and it is really good.  I usually add freshly grated parmesean cheese to it.  Be careful not to put too much in the blender at once or the lid will blow off and you'll have hot soup everywhere (that happened to me the first time I made it).

If you had an abundance of basil this summer as I did, don't worry about counting leaves. Just dump in a bunch. I don't bother blanching the tomatoes.  As others suggested, puree tomatoes and basil before heating. So much easier! I added 2 garlic cloves, several scallions and a pinch of sugar. I always look forward to this summertime soup!

Simply delicious soup. I used the tomatoes that I had canned last August for the tomatoes and liquid. The soup is fresh and creamy. I substituted roasted garlic salt for salt. Pairs well with toasted cheese with tomato and basil.

This soup is so ridiculously good. Definitely don't skimp on the basil. Used an immersion blender to puree at the end. It was so delicious, best tomato soup recipe!

Made this for the first time today and sooo good.  I made it according to the recipe, no tweaks and it was smooth, flavorful, just downright delicious.  When I make it again I won't peel the tomatoes and I think I would puree the basil with a few cups of the tomato mixture and then pour the rest of the tomato mixture in to the blender and do a very light pulse, leaving some bits for texture. Otherwise, I wouldn't change thing.  Great recipe.  Bravo.

Simple and delicious! I made the recipe as stated with just one change. A heaping teaspoon of minced garlic was added to the simmering tomatoes.

Amazing. I only made two changes. I replaced two cups of tomato juice with chicken stock and subtracted the salt. Then I added some crumbled bacon. So good for cold weather

I made this recipe tonight and it was phenomenal. Just absolutely wonderful. I served it up with a grilled cheese for my roommate and I and got probably the best review I could have asked for: "I would have been more than happy to pay $20 for that in a restaurant and I would have been totally pleased with it." I agreed!

I like a really thick tomato soup so I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour at the same time as the butter and cream and built up from there until it was the consistency that I wanted. That was the only thing I changed, though.

This was outstanding.  I made a couple modifications as other reviewers mentioned.  I used only 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup cream.  My intent wasn't to cut calories/fat -- I did it because it tasted better with less cream/butter. I also cooked the tomato mixture about 2 hours before adding the cream/butter.  I added 3 cloves of garlic as the tomato mixture simmered.  A definite 5 stars!

This was fantastic. I considered tweaking it, but decided to make it as listed above. It turned out GREAT!  Such a yummy recipe.  I read at least 100 of the 800+ reviews.I think I only came across two reviews that gave it less than 5 stars. One complained that the cream ruined it.  Um... The title indicates that it is CREAMY Tomato Basil Soup.  Yes, it is a very rich and creamy style. YUM! I typically make my Tomato Basil Soup non-dairy, but decided to try this for a change. It was scrumptious.  I did taste it pre-cream and it was super yummy at that stage too.  I would use it in either form very happily.  The 2nd bad review gave it 2 stars because they weren't told to be careful when they puree -let the hot cool enough to not explode, etc.. I am very sorry they got burned, but even they said the recipe was all the 5 stars and more and that the only reason for the low rating was because of their lack of knowing how to handle hot foods for puree. Not fair.  SO.. ALL that to say... SUPERB recipe as is.  It is one I will keep and remake. It will be fun to play with it also. I would love to experiment with some Italian sausage and cheese accents, but that is just because I like to experiment. The recipe as is works great. Kudos to the chef of this recipe! ps. I made a monster batch using 20+ tomatoes for freezer portions. Even super sizing the recipe worked well.

Absolutely wonderful soup.  Good enough for company.  Only change was that I used an entire can of tomato juice.  My friend gave me some slightly bruised tomatoes from her garden.  Heaven!

Really good. I did not peel or seed. Regretted it later. After it was finished, due to my not following recipe, I had to put it through a food mill. MY FAULT. Great recipe.

I followed the recipe perfectly but I added chopped garlic for some extra taste. With our without the garlic, this is easily one of my favorites because it is so simple and comes out OH SO GOOD!

For all those worried about calories, relax. Why? How many calories are in the tomatoes? Then, take the calories from the cream and butter and basil, and it isn't near as much as it seems. I used basil from my garden. Perhaps we are light on it, but it made more than 4 servings when eating with moderation -- unless you eat nothing else. It is a beautiful, rich soup. AT least as good as Panera's from my point of view. I made it as is and was delighted -- as were my three teen boys and husband. I have also tried it with adding a pinch of ancho pepper, ground fennel, bit of onion, bit of garlic, bit of celery salt, a 2 tsp of sugar.  That version was yummy. This is great as is, and one can adjust and play with the add-ins. Depending on what you have with it, you can be wonderfully creative. Definitely makes a great soup with grilled cheese sandwiches. I started thinking of all of the different foods they serve at Panera that go with soup!! Lots to enjoy. Excellent soup.

It's really good. Wife and kids loved it and can be picky at times. I'm not a cook by any means and this was easy to make. I substituted the fresh tomatoes for diced canned tomatoes to make it easier. Still turned out great!

This is the best creamy tomato basil soup we have ever had!  It is a favorite of the whole family, especially my children, who request it often.  The original recipe is the best, but if you don't have heavy whipping cream on hand, milk (any fat content) can be substituted.  while the flavor remains the same, just know that the thickness will decrease.

The recipe is just fine. It tasted like the soup I had in RI on a recent trip. I guess I just don't love tomato soup as much as I used to. I over boiled the tomatoes , so they softened too much and getting the seeds out took a long time. (that was my first time doing that) as I was "deseeding" I knew in my heart there "has to be a better way"...so take a minute and google it (or whatever) and save yourself some time. After that process the rest was a snap, really, really simple. If you love tomato soup, this is restaurant quality ...enjoy!

Well I made a double batch of the recipe today EXACTLY as it is said to be made and I think it has serious potential. The problem is the acidity of the tomatoes. It is overbearing. Maybe it is the time of year I'm trying to buy fresh tomatoes though.  I will however go home and take the advice of others and just add a little bit of sugar and I'm hoping that does the trick because either way this is dinner tonight for my family of 6!! Lol, I think it will be fine. As others have stated though, next time I make this recipe I will saute some onions and garlic and add that to the tomatoes while they simmer, but that is just personal taste. I can't get enough onion and garlic in my kitchen! Thanks!

Update: I never do this, but just had to pop back in to say that this is our favorite soup ever, and I make it at least once a month. (Just had a bowl for lunch.) This time I forgot to buy fresh basil so I threw in some that I had dried from last year's garden, and it was just as flavorful. Thanks for this great recipe!

So simple and delicious my so was slurping it up before he even knew what was in it. I thought he hated tomatoes—apparently not. Like others, I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes, but pureed everything right in the pot. I enjoyed the texture of the small seeds. Thank you for this delicious recipe! We had it with grilled cheese made from the Amish white bread recipe I found here and make every week.

Very delicious. We made some grilled mozzarella sandwiches (with fresh chopped basil) to go with this and it was an awesome sunday afternoon lunch. I would probably add a few more tomatoes and use low-sodium tomato juice because I'm super-sensitive to salt and love the flavor of tomato but this was super yummy.

I've made this several times now. It is very good. I like to add about a tsp. of minced garlic, a dash of red pepper flakes and some dried sweet basil along with fresh basil leaves. If my tomatoes aren't quite ripe enough I do add a little sugar. We always serve this soup with grilled cheese sandwiches. Perfect for a cold winter night.

Wow! First time making this and it is amazing! Like a fancy bistro..but better! I followed the recipe with some tweaks. I used 5 vine ripe tomatoes and using tongs held them by the vine in boiling water so the skins would fall off. Didn't bother de-seeding either. In Step 1 above, I also added a TB of chopped jar garlic, some dried oregano and the salt & pepper to simmer for the 30 mins. I added about 20 leaves of fresh basil when I pureed it.  In Step 2, I cut the butter and heavy cream in half.   Love it...SUPER TASTY!!!

I did substitute half and half for the heavy cream. I (who loves cream) felt it would have been better with the heavy cream. Dh (who does not like cream, butter, etc.) said it was perfect. Even with half and half, it was very good!

I have been using this recipe for a couple years now. It is wonderful! Can't make it too often because when I do, I eat the whole pot within a day! And I always double it. I use canned diced tomatoes and they work just fine. Also a little easier. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Incredible!  I used 1/2 the butter, 18-20 fresh basil leaves, 1 teaspoon sugar (since my tomatoes weren't totally ripe), and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper.  We cut up tortillas and toasted them to put on top, along with bacon bits, cheddar cheese and scallions.  3 cans of cambell's tomato juice worked perfect.

Well, it was one of those days that one hopes fervently to get to the market but fails to actually do so.  I had only a bit of cream, but I did have fresh tomatoes and basil, so thought I'd give it a try.  It was bitter, but we're in winter now, so I don't expect really sweet tomatoes, and I had to add quite a lot of sugar.  Next time I'll seed my tomatoes as other reviewers suggested.  I added a tablespoon or so of butter; I would not have added half a cup of butter to a soup under any circumstances.  I thought the soup was very good anyway.  It had a clean, fresh taste and a steady hum of basil underneath all the tomatoes.  Hubby liked it very much.

I am a busy mom of 3 with another on the way...so I have no time for things like peeling and seeding! I have been using this recipe  for a couple of years now (just a little easier version) and my whole family loves it. I roughly chop whole tomatoes (however many I have, usually 5 large ones) & throw them in the pot with a whole bottle or 64 ounce can of whatever tomato juice I have (often even V-8 veggie juice!) Simmer til they are nice and soft (the longer the better), then scoop them out and put them in the food processor with a TON of basil. (I never measure.)  Do the rest of the recipe pretty much like it says and voila! You really can't mess this soup up. My kids like to put croutons in it.

First Tomato Soup I ever made, and is a new instant classic for me. I can't believe how easy it is to make. Everyone was raving over it. Will definitely keep and use recipe, thanks! BTW, I didn't have heavy whipping cream, so I used Sour Cream. Turned out great, but next time I'll try with the cream

This was DELISH! So tastey. I used probably 10 basil leaves and next time I would use even less. I prefer more tomato than basil flavor but it was still quite amazing. I also didn't peel the tomatoes, it wasn't necessary with my hand blender, no chucks or peels leftover. I can't wait to make it again & plan to make a bigger batch to freeze!

This soup tastes exactly like the wonderful creamy tomato basil soups served at some restaurants...  Sometimes though, I prefer to make a soup that is lighter on the cream, and use the Jersey Fresh tomato soup recipe... I have gotten rave reviews over both of them... absolutely delicious soups!!  Thank you for sharing!

I made one change to this soup, I used half the amount of butter to cut the calories. This soup tastes GREAT!

Super Yum.  Tip: Start blender on slooooowly... ooops. UPDATE: I purchased an immersion blender specifically for this recipe and used it tonight with much more pleasant results.  I recommend one!  Got mine on Amazon. :-)

I made this soup tonight for dinner!  It was fantastic.  I followed some of the other suggestions.  I tossed in a tbsp of sugar and about 1/4 cup of light cream cheese.  I used about 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of cream.  I didn't use any salt either.  It was salty enough!!!

I've printed fifteen copies of this, because people keep asking me for the recipe!  I've made it for as many as 22 people.  It's always a hit!
I appreciate that my vegetarian friends who eat dairy can eat this, too.

Unbelievable!!! A new favorite! Used my own garden tomatoes with it and a tomato cocktail juice, did not have enough fresh basil, so I used half dry and it still was wonderful!

Delicious!!! I doubled the recipe, no problem. I used half the heavy cream called for and 1/4 cup of butter. I used extra basil and chopped it before pureeing it. I paired this with Gruyere grilled cheese... it's a winner!

Loved this recipe!  I actually did not have tomato juice so used 1/2 tomato sauce, 1/4 water and 1/4 chicken stock. I did puree the cooked tomatoes, but found the puree did not affect the chopped basil much, so would chop a little bit more before I added to processor. Per reccommendation I wish I had added a little more basil!  Just added the cream to taste...wonderful easy, and tasty soup recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  It just wasn't that great.  It was...it was...I don't know.  It just wasn't that great.  Maybe it was the tomatoes that I used or maybe...I don't know.  After reading all the wonderful reviews, I just knew this was going to be awesome.  Maybe I had my hopes to high.  From now on, when I want some tomato soup, I'll just use that famous soup in a can and doctor it up with some milk.

My family absolutely loved this soup! The only changes I made were not peeling and seeding the tomatoes and I added a bit of sugar. Other than that, it's a perfect recipe! I will be making this again and again.

Its a pretty good tomato soup, but didn't really have a great texture. Maybe I'll try it again and add some stock to give it a better mouth feel. Overall it's not the end all be all tomato soup for me, its a little too tart. fyi i used fresh home grown tomatoes, not canned. maybe I'll use canned next time also.

This came out very well, but not as thick as in this picture. I think I would need to use sour cream maybe to get it that thick? I'm not entirely sure. But it tasted great!

Well, this was delicious, but I found that the 1 cup of heavy whipping cream to be way over the top. Next time I will only add 1/2 cup and/or use less heavy cream. I also only added 1/4 cup of butter. I *do* actually want to taste the tomatoes, you know!

I love this soup! I didn't realize making it would be so easy. Although, I think I liked it a lot better before I added the heavy cream. It was still a delicious dinner along with a sourdough grilled cheese sandwich. My family loved it!

I am only giving it four stars for now. I did not have butter so I had to use margarine. I think the butter flavour is what this was missing so I will make it again and change the rating if it is 5 stars with butter. 
I used half & half cream and peeled but did not seed the tomatoes. I also added 2 tsp of sugar to settle the acidity of the tomatoes.

This is the first recipe on allrecipes.com that we've tried that was rated high and we thought was terrible.  I was hoping this would be similar to Wolfgang Puck's Tomato Basil Soup but it was far off.  Ours was pretty bitter despite using good tomatos.  We threw in some extra garlic and basil to hopefully sweeten it up but it didn't work.  Not sure what else to try aside from adding milk or sugar.

Everything was great except with the canned tomato juice it tasted a bit to bitter. I am gonna try it with maybe a lower sodium juice or try and extract the juice from the tomato's themselves.

AMAZING.  Since I made it at the end of Nov. I used canned tomato's (one fire roasted, the other regular).  I also didn't have tomato juice on hand and figured the juice from the can's would work.  I tasted as I went to determine how much basil, cream and butter to add.  It turned out amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and my husband raved over it.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried, and it still turned out great.  The only negative thing I have to say about it, is that it is really a bad food to eat if you have ulcers.  I was sick all day from it.  :(

Wonderful!! I am sure to use romas, and I think that makes a flavor difference (although in winter I will probably try canned). I serve it with parmesan cheese, and french bread with butter on the side. Anyone who has tried this melts in their chair on the spot- defiantly a keeper! Can't wait to serve this at a tea party!

This was REALLY good. Even my husband liked it and he hates tomatoes and soup. I did as others suggested and cut the cream in half and only put in 1/3 of a cup of butter. I'm glad I did that because the soup just barely started losing its "tomatoey-ness." Next time, I think I'll add more tomatoes and tomato juice and I might cook them on low for a few hours in my crock pot before adding the cream and butter. Still an awesome recipe. I can't wait to have it for lunch today!

Really yummy soup!!! I did reduce the cream and butter by more than a half. Theres really no need for all these extra calories since the soup still tastes fantastic without them!

Absolutely wonderful...and easy! Didn't bother to peel the tomatos and just seeded half of them. Garnished with a bit of (real) grated parmesan and served with grilled cheese sandwiches. The fam loved it!

I cheated and didn't peel the tomatoes and used one part tomato puree with one part water instead of juice (I was very confused with this ingredient, I did not see tomato juice for sale in the story, do they mean V8 or something?).  Still worked, do taste tests as you add the butter/cream to get the right amount.  I also used dried basil, I think it was probably the same.  I don't believe you have to follow this recipe exactly, especially if you just want soup that's cheaper and tastier then canned soup in stores.

very good.  used tomatoes and basil straight from the garden.  Cut back the butter and used whole milk and was still yummy.  Husband thought basil taste was a bit overwhelming so will use less next time for his sake but I thought it was just fine.  Wish I had enough tomatoes to freeze a batch of this soup.

I wanted a good creamy tomato soup for so long, and this one looked so good.  I tried it the original way, and it was very bland.  I tried tweaking it so many different ways and still haven't found a way that makes me happy.  So sad to say this one doesn't quite cut it.  Also doesn't freeze well at all.  If you're looking for a very mild soup, then this may be for you.

Great recipe!  I Did make some changes though... Doubled the recipe due to all the tomatoes we got from the garden, used low sodium juice, 1/2 the butter, did not de- seed the tomatoes, and added a bit of worchestershire sauce for a deeper flavor.  Can't wait to eat it tomorrow with fresh mozzarella paninis!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This soup is just amazing!!! Simple. Delicious. Comfort food at its finest! Easy to make, stores well for several days, travels well for lunch on the go, reheats quickly in the microwave. Gotta use the real butter and heavy cream (I give you permission, no matter how strict your diet rules may be). If you're a beginning cook, don't forget the salt--you need more salt than you might think for a big batch of soup! The first few times we made this, we soaked each tomato in boiling water for 5 seconds and then cooled it in an ice water bath to make peeling easier. Now we just dice them without bothering to remove the skin. We do use an immersion blender, so there aren't any issues with texture due to leaving the skin on. I strongly encourage letting the soup simmer (but NOT boil) for at least 30 minutes after adding the cream and butter; this really develops the flavor. Also for new cooks: try making each new batch with a different type of tomato. This strategy is really helping us get to know the flavor and personality of different tomato varieties, since we get to smell and savor the taste each tomato for several days!

Good, but it tasted way too much like butter, and I LOVE butter.  I'll probably half the butter next time.

Excellent.  I used my Vitamix to puree the tomato mixture and basil.  The basil came from my herb garden.  I do not make this very often due to the fat and cholesterol content.

Waaaaay too much cream/butter. I put in half the cream and half the butter then tasted it and it tasted alright but my boyfriend said "no, you should make it the way the recipe says to the first time". Big mistake. Far too rich and completely unnecessary.yuck...

Good easy soup. I put half skim milk and half cream. I used margarine because I was out of butter. I've tried more complicated creamy tomato soup recipes and they aren't half as good.

I used 1/2 C half and half, 1/4 C butter, added in some garlic and a little sugar to help with the acidity. I didn't peel my Toms. just blended it all extra extra smooth with my immersion blender. This was great!

This may be the most delicious thing I've ever made, and so easy. I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I used about 32 grape tomatoes since they're the only kind that have flavor this time of year.

Very good. I used 2 cans of organic diced tomatoes for the recipe. I also added three cloves of garlic while melting the butter. i pureed the tomatoes for a creamier texture. Quick and easy and way better than any canned soup.

This soup was really tasty but I did change it up just a bit. I used 2-28oz cans of organic crushed tomatoes and one 14oz can of diced tomatoes which eliminated the need to blend the soup. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and one shallot. Mine made a larger pot of soup so I added about 1/4 cup more of cream. Definitely will try this recipe again in the summer with fresh tomatoes and I'm sure it will be even more delicious!

Thus recipe is delicious and very easy to make.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of heavy cream and butter significantly, using only 1 Tblsp of butter and 2 Tblsp of heavy cream.  Tasted just as good.

Absolutely fabulous.  I made this soup last week and I am just getting around to rating it.  It was so creamy and tasty.  This was my first attempt at homemade Tomato Soup and I think I picked a winner.  I will be hard pressed to eat any other type Tomato Soup from now on.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it, even my husband who can't stand tomato soup! I doubled the recipe and I added 3 tablespoons of bacon grease to the soup as another reviewer suggested and topped each bowl with crumbled bacon bits. The flavor actually gets better and better with each spoonful!

This was a lot of work for something that didn't take that great.  It was a bit acidic and bitter. I made this for Christmas day dinner and about 1/2 the guests didn't touch it past the first couple of spoonfuls.  A couple guests did like it.  I think blending basil, cream and butter with a canned soup would have worked  better with a lot less effort.

This soup is almost everything I want from a tomato basil soup. I cook it and put it in sourdough bread bowls topped with parmesan cheese, tossed under a broiler for a few minutes- ahhh! Put a little salad on the side and it's wonderful. The next time I make it I will add some julienned carrots for texture but other than that, wouldn't change a thing.

This was nearly the soup I've been eating in my favorite restaurant!  Thanks for sharing!  Something seems a tiny bit off.....garlic?  I used small roma tomatoes, so I used 6.  I did not peel the tomatoes, and kept a few un-pureed, as others suggested.  This gave the result of peel being still in my soup.  I don't recommend this.  Puree it all, or peel the tomatoes is what I'll do next time.

Delicious. It was so good. First time I had ever made Tomato soup from scratch. I added in two cloves of garlic and some spinach since I like to say that cooking is learning what works and what doesn't. And that worked. Wonders.   It's becoming a staple in my house.

I really wanted to like this. I followed the directions exactly and all I got was a very salty soup that just tasted like tomato juice. I added three cloves of garlic and teaspoon of flour to thicken the soup, which helped, but I didn't even really want to finish my bowl. :(

Wow, was this delicious!  I had to make substitutions due to what I had in the house. I used v-8 juice and used canned diced tomatoes and put them in the blender. And I had to use some cream cheese and a teaspoon of flour to thicken-but I loved it!

This is seriously the best!  It actually inspired me to review a recipe on here, it's that good.  It taste's just like La Madeline's Tomato Basil Soup, which is what I was hoping for.  Yes, it's not "healthy" but it's so very worth it.  I did use canned tomatoes instead of fresh, but I don't think it was hurt by it.  Excellent!

It was our first "fall" day in L.A. and my husband was in the mood for tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. I had no cans of soup, but happened to have some fresh organic basil and heavy cream. I had no fresh tomatoes, so combed the cupboard for diced tomatoes. I used half diced roasted and half regular tomatoes. The juice inside replaced the tomato juice, which I also was out of. I pureed the ingredients and it turned out fantastic. Thanks!

Creamy Tomato soup is one of my winter favorites and I love basil so I had high hopes for this soup. This was just okay-Nothing to swoon over. I'll try this again and increase the basil maybe? I am not going to give up on this one though... I think with some research I'll figure out just what could be used to enhance this a bit and bring it from bland to blissful which is what I was expecting!

I have made this perfect soup a couple of times. First time, straight as the recipie calls-and trust me, it is fabulous that way. I did want a little meat and veggies in it this last time that I made it. I started by roasting all of my tomatoes (slice in half length-wise and set on pan cut side up. drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt), a red bell pepper and  5 cloves of garlic. Broil for about 15 minutes or until the skin is darkened, place the red bell in a paper bag for about 10-15 minutes and the skin will fall off. I ground up some sausage in a skillet put it in the slow cooker. Then I cooked an onion, and finely chopped green cabbage in the sausage drippings. I pured the veggies with the tomatoes and added them to my slow cooker. Also, I used V8 juice instead of tomato juice because I was going with the "veggie" them. I always use the heavy cream, mostly because it tastes so amazing. Once again, it turned out great! I serve this with a loaf of french bread sliced length-wise. Spread with a good pesto sauce on both open faces. Lay with sliced tomatoes and then sprinkle with mozzerella. Broil on low. Hope this helps :)

Amazing - I used only tomatoes from my garden, pureed 2 cups in the food processor and diced another 2 cups.  I let the tomatoes simmer slightly for a few hours, which made an enormous impact on flavor!  I used atleast twice the basil because our plant is enormous and won't last forever.  I also used about half the butter, since we didn't have enough.  My partner was sick, thus why I made the soup - his favorite - no need for the canned stuff anymore!  This recipe was simple and fantastic!

I used can diced tomatoes and whole milk. I did not have heavy cream, but everyone loved it and wants it for dinner again tonight.  I imagine had I used the ingredients that the recipe called for, my kids would not only be begging for more like they are now, but they may experience withdrawal symptoms. Really a great recipe and a keeper.  Thanks.  SECOND REVIEW: This time I added per the advice of a reviewer, cooked bacon and bacon grease. FABULOUS! Cooked with the bacon makes this soup very hearty and perfect for a colder weather soup.  Both ways are excellent.

One thing I tried is roasting some vine tomatoes with a little olive oil, garlic granules, s&p, in a 450 oven for 1/2 hour, and then after cooking them and pureeing them, I strained the soup to make it creamy and remove the skins and seeds.  I also didnt have any tomato juice, so I used condensed tomato soup and it gave the soup a real depth of flavor.

Yummmm. No need to peel or seed the tomatoes in my opinion.  This is definitely a restaurant quality soup. The last time I had Tomato Basil Soup served to me in a restaurant, they left a few chunks and a put a ravioli in the middle of the bowl, and then poured the soup around it- just an idea for a wonderful presentation. This is soooo good, what a keeper!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever stumbled across. I make it about once every two weeks and never have left overs! I always saute garlic and onion before adding the tomatoes. Also, I never bother to skin or seed the tomatoes, why bother!, and it always turns out absolutely delicious! Thanks for an amazing recipe. A real crowd pleaser!

This was a great tasting recipe! The only thing I would like to recommend for first time soup makers such as myself, is to take extreme caution when pureeing the tomato after it simmers- as it did happen to "explode" everywhere causing some burns... hazards of home cooking :) Otherwise the soup was a huge hit!

This soup is creamy and delicious, even when made with canned tomatoes!  It is good made with lesser amounts of butter and/or cream, but if you are trying to mimic the taste of the wonderful soup at La Madeleine, make the recipe as stated and do a few extra sit ups!  It is an indulgence, but well worth it!  Even my children, who do not care for tomatoes, love this soup.

Tasted just like the soup I got at a restaurant!  I loved this soup!  I'm definitely going to make this again.    I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes (because I missed that detail) but I loved the soup anyways.  I also used 1/3 cup of butter instead and it tasted great.  I'm going to try 1/4 cup butter next time and see how that turns out.  This soup is so yummy with french bread.  Mmmmm.

This recipe is what every tomato soup lover has ever wanted. It is basic, but therein lies the beauty. I have made this with light cream, chicken stock and about half a small can of tomato paste instead of tomato juice, dry basil and canned tomatos. It was still good. I like to add my own touches of sour cream and a few spices. It is a wonderful basic recipe and gives one the know how to start with something good and expand on it.

I made this soup for a Valentine's Day dinner party.  Everyone loved it!  Even people who said they don't usually eat tomato soup said they loved it.  I had requests for the recipe and for what little leftovers there were.   Will make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This soup is sooo good! It reminded me of the soup at La Madeline resturant - but didn't cost nearly as much. The only change I made was to double the amount of basil.

Pretty bland on flavor.  Used frozen Roma tomatoes from my garden so shouldn't have lacked tomato flavor.  I added a Tbls of chicken base and a little onion powder to give it more flavor. Not the best I have had, but good.

Important note for beginners: cool the soup before placing it in the blender or split it into batches.  Otherwise, a solid recipe, but not the best tomato soup I've ever had.

Absolutely delicious, I used tons of fresh basil and halved the butter and cream to make it a tad healthier - still really good!  I served it with grilled cheese sandos :)

Delicious, even better than La madeleine's.
I only used half of the butter called for and it was still very creamy.
Thank you.

Very good soup.  I did make it lower fat, so I am sure it would be even better if I had used heavy cream and tons of butter.  Instead, I followed the directions, but put in less butter and used fat free half and half.  The result was very good and something my entire family liked.  It made me feel even better to serve it to them, knowing I had cut a lot of the fat.  Yummy soup!

Yum, Yum, and YUM! This is perfect -- super easy to make and delish. I also made some homemade garlic croutons (that took mins to make!) and tossed them in this soup. Couldn't have been better - love it!

It turned out fantastic.  I read reviews and used a 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes w/basil and used a little less fresh basil in the soup.  Simmered for about double the time with some fresh garlic too.  Used hand immersion blender because it makes it so much easier.  Served with parmesan goldfish crackers and I made  BLT w/avocado sandwiches.  My boyfriend loved it, thanks!

This soup was a hit! i made it for a crowd of 15 people so i had to tweak it a bit. If it's for a party, don't try to make it low fat by reducing the butter or cream- it tasted so heavenly with the right amount! Also, i added some garlic powder to reduce the sourness of the tomatoes. Great recipe- thanks for sharing..

This soup is as good as it gets at home.  It was easy and delicious.  The only thing I changed was adding minced garlic to the tomatoes and juice while it simmered.  Also I only blended about 3/4 the mixture so there would be some tomato chunks in the soup.  I also used canned instead of fresh tomatoes.  I used 28 ounces of peeled diced tomatoes.  I will make this recipe again and  again, it is just like you would get at a restaurant.  I would leave the cream and butter (I know thats a lot of extra calories) if you omit them there goes half the flavor.

Loved it! Like others, I too have been searching for a Tomato Basil Soup recipe, and I am thrilled with this one! Super easy, and it seemed to have a great balance of herbs and cream. I will definitely make this one again.

Delicious as is!  Just to make it healthier next time I will probably use half and half.  I used 5 smaller Roma tomatoes because I love their flavor.  Great with grilled cheese sandwiches and warms up nicely as leftovers.

So yummy! I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and added 4 cloves of garlic with the tomatoes and juice. I forgot to add salt and pepper but it didn't need it. I topped it with some grated parmesean. My husband who doesn't like tomatoes raved about it. This soup will go into my regular rotation. It was super easy, tasty and satisfying!

This was a really delicious soup, and just what I was looking for. I had a very similar soup at The Space Needle Restaurant in Seattle, and this was just as good, if not better, and much cheaper! I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes, I used only a few tablespoons of butter, and about 2/3 cup of half & half instead of heavy cream, and it was perfect. I didn't have any problems with the half & half curdling. I used dried basil as that was all I had and added some garlic powder as well as a scant tablespoon of sugar. Also, I used a hand-held blender in the soup pot so I didn't have to bother with transfering and cleaning up another dish. I will definately make this again. My husband and I enjoyed this with grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches. So warm, so creamy, so perfect!

So good!  I made it tonight for a dinner party and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My husband has been raving about the soup since dinner.  He is requesting we have it for dinner tomorrow.  I usually have a hard time making a recipe that I have never made before but this was really easy to make.

I love this soup! I made it as it is printed. I had some guests over to eat and I was reluctant to serve this fine dish since I had never made it before, but hey....a dish with butter and heavy cream....how can you go wrong? lol! Anyway, we served these in bread bowls (which I don't really advise doing since the bowl sops the soup up too quickly unlike a chicken noodle soup or a chunkier soup).

Its the middle of August and I'm enjoying hot soup! Crazy but true. Thank you for this quick and easy recipe. Excellent way to use my abundance of garden tomatoes and basil. I used fresh roma tomatoes and passed them through a roma sauce food strainer, it peels and removes the seeds automatically, so about 5 cups of pureed tomatoes is the end result. Out of personal preference I will cut the amount of butter to 3/4 stick next time. Fresh baked crusty bread is a requirement as well. This also froze beautifully and I will definately be making many more pots of this to freeze for this winter - if I can wait that long!

Great recipe-- the only thing I do differently is add 4-5 slices of bread into the blender to thicken up the soup. I serve it with a corn and red onion salsa and some crumbled goat cheese on top.

Oh yum--this is just like the soup at a certain French-cafe-style chain (that we don't have here in North Carolina and I miss from my DC days).  I used canned tomatoes and frozen basil cubes and it came out wonderfully.

We really enjoyed this! I used Thai basil which gave it a nice zing, and only 1/4c of butter. It was rich and creamy and delicious.

Since fresh tomatoes were out of season I substituted a 28oz can of whole tomatoes.  I also diced and sauted one small onion and three cloves of garlic in olive oil prior to adding the the tomatoes and juice.  I did use less butter and more basil.  This soup tastes so good.

This was just OK. I thought it would be thicker. I think I either used too much cream or not enough tomatoes. Felt like I was drinking tomato milk. I also had kind of a mess when trying to puree in the blender - but that was my fault, not the recipe's :)

Okay, so I have a confession -- I've never actually made the recipe as it is shown. I'm a poor college student with minimal time, so here are the modifications I've made (sorry nothing is very exact. It's a very forgiving recipe).

3 (28oz) cans of diced or petite diced tomatoes (stick with Hunt's. I've tried other brands and was disappointed)
8+ fresh basil leaves (adjust as you desire)
1/2 cup butter 
2 cups (1 pint) heavy cream
2+ pinches of sugar
Salt and Pepper to taste

Blend 1-1.5 of the cans of tomatoes with all of the basil leaves (I like the tomato chunks, but adjust as necessary). Dump the that and the rest of the tomatoes in a pot. Add the stick of butter and allow to simmer. Add a few pinches of sugar to the soup (this is because the canned tomatoes are much more acidic to fresh. The sugar helps take that edge off). Once butter is all melted, slowly stir in the cream. Allow to simmer some more (do not boil!). Add some salt and pepper as you desire. 

Also: I sometimes add a bit of dried crushed basil too, just to add some extra flavor. Parmesan added while cooking or just before serving is also a great addition.

This recipe makes a lot (maybe 8+ servings -- well that's a lot for me, not necessarily a family) and tastes GREAT as leftovers. I LOVE this recipe!

This soup was great!!  Everyone in my family gobbled it up.  The only change I made was that instead of heavy cream I used fat free half & half to cut back on the calories.  Add a salad and this is a great weeknight meal!

Yum Yum ...very similar to Tomato basil soup we get here at vons store which we love.
I halfed the recipe to give it a try
I did not have tomato juice, I mixed 1 oz of tomato paste with one cup of water which worked just fine.
I did not bother deseeding or taking the skin out of the tomatos. I just chopped the tomatoes and added to the juice and shimmered. Then i strained and blended the rest and added back to the soup.
I warmed the butter added some crushed garlic and then the blended tomato paste.
Then added the cream and some salt and pepper. To make little spicy i added Hot-Sweet tomato sauce.
Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! I love cream, so I used a whole pint. I use canned tomatoes and no tomato juice.
DO NOT USE HALF & HALF -- it curdles because of the acid in the tomatoes and makes a funny texture. I do use margarine (regular, not light) instead of butter and I can't tell a difference. Leftovers are great!!

This is a great recipe! It tastes just like the Tomato Basil soup from La Madeline! I added a dash of garlic to mine, just for some extra flavor, and I also added another cup of tomato juice just because I love tomatoes so much. 

I will definitely make this again and again and again!

Used canned diced tomatoes and 3 cups V8 (per other reviews). Sounds gross, but the end result was delicious! Also, reduced the amount of butter just slightly to somewhat reduce the fat.

So good!!!!

Loverd this!  I had it at a cookie exchange/ holiday luncheon and everyone loved the soup.  I used canned crushed tomatoes and a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh... and it worked out great!  I also didn't puree out all of the chunks because I like a few chunks of tomato in there.  My husband loved it too!  Yummy!

This was very good! I have been looking for a recipe to duplicate a favorite restaraunt of mines tomato basil soup. Only thing I had a problem with was that I would have liked it a little thicker, which I will work on when I make it again! I was surprised at how easy it was to make too!

I have made this soup several times now and thoroughly enjoy it.  I prefer to add an extra can of crushed tomatoes (minus the juice) to make it heartier and about an ounce of goat cheese for a bit of a tang!

I made this with canned tomatoes as they are out of season and I couldn't afford fresh. I knew I was taking a risk but thought I'd try it. It wasn't very good. I love soup but didn't want to finish off this pot. Won't make this again without fresh tomatoes!!!

Delicious soup, but much better (5* worthy) if you add 1-2 tbsp of sugar to it and a splash of balsamic vinegar.

I was definately pleased with this recipe.  I did make a few changes, but it was still great.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic and onion. I also cut back the heavy cream to more like 1/3 C. I do think this will become a frequent soup choice for our family.

This soup is so delicious!  I can even get my young children to eat it!  I didn't use whipping cream.  Instead, I used 2% milk to reduce the fat.  It's still delicious.  Also, I put it in freeze and can jars and froze it.  It was just as delicious when it was thawed.  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

you really can't screw this one up.  I eyeballed all the measurements and added a spoon of sugar, until I thought it tasted right.  Took no time at all to make - I used stewed tomato cans - and fresh basil, and turned out really delicious.  Served with "easy foccacia" from this site.

I can't decide about this recipe. I used 2 (28 ounce cans) of diced tomatoes and part tomato juice, not the 4 cups it called for.  I cut back on the cream (as per other reviewers) and used my hand held emersion blender to blend the tomatoes. It still had a little bitter taste, so I added some sugar( canned tomatoes I am sure).  I also added some cheese.  I will try this recipe again with fresh tomatoes this summer.  Thanks for the recipe.

YUM! This is definitely comfort food. First time, I follwed the recipe exactly. Second time, I halved the butter, and used tomatoes in the jar. So good either way! My hubby loved it too.

I cheated and used tomatoes from a can, as well as dried basil left over from my garden last summer.  It seemed to work well.  I'm not a big tomato soup fan, but this recipe is one that I will eat, and actually crave.  Very rich though - one bowl is plenty!

This recipe is AMAZING!!Only things I did different were to add some onion ( this is a must...so good) and I didn't puree all of the soup( we like it chunky). This soup is going to be a staple in our home.  I plan on making a tomato/veggie soup using this recipe. Combo's are endless. Thank you for such a gem!!

Delicious! I changed the recipe by adding an orange pepper to the tomatoes, and I had a can of diced potatoes on hand so I added those in to make it more of a meal. I also used only half of the butter and half the cream because I just couldnt bring myself to make something that fattening. I think it was creamy enough that way. It was really good and so easy to make.

We did not care for this too much. It seems like it tasted better before I added all that cream and butter. It was not awful or anything, it just was not for us.

This is very good soup, but who wouldn't like something with a stick of butter in it.  I would make this again, but because of the high fat content, it won't be too often.

I didn't like this soup at all. It was way to acidic tasting. I followed the receipe exactly, so I don't think I did anything wrong. Maybe something went wrong in the process, but I'll never try this soup again.

I love tomato basil soup and this recipe was not only easy, but had a really great flavor!!! I used tomato juice out of a can and as a result there was a slightly "tinny" taste. The next time I make this recipe will try a different kind.

I was trying to replicate a thick, creamy tomato soup I had in a restaurant yesterday. This wasn't thick enough to quite match the restaurant version but it was still really, really good! But honestly, what could possibly taste bad with that much butter and cream?

I had some AWESOME tomato basil soup at Pockets one day... It was so good, I bought groceries the next day to try this recipe out.

This was pretty good, but tasted a little too much like the tomato juice I used. Also, I should note that I didn't peel, seed, or puree the tomatos, so perhaps that may be why the flavor is a tad too tart. Also, it wasn't as creamy as I had anticipated, even though I added 1.5 cups of cream. I guess a lot of the taste has to do with the type of tomato juice used.. next time, I might decrease the amount of bottled tomato juice (that stuff has a hideous amount of sodium, anyway), and perhaps use some vegetable broth to dilute it and mellow out the flavor.

One other change I made: extra basil, and... diced chives! Try it out.. it's got a nice kick :)

So fresh tasting with the tomatoes and basil, but something that I can only cook once in a blue moon.  The amount of butter and whipping cream is a little overwhelming for my system.  So GOOD though...

This recipe is awesome!  It is so easy and tastes exactly like soup offered in restaurants.  I totally agree with the other reviewer.  A half cup of cream is perfect.  There is absolutely no reason to put a full cup of cream in it especially since there's already a full stick of butter.  Enjoy.

I also used canned tomatoes.  I pureed 1/2 of them with the basil and then simmered them together.  After simmering I used a hand mixer to bring the rest to the consistancy I wanted.  I also used about 1/2 the butter and milk instead of cream.  My husband thought this was the best tomato soup I had ever made.

I have been looking for this recipe ever since I had it in my favorite Italian resturant.  I did however tweek a few things.  Tomatoes this time of year have no taste, so I used a .35oz can of whole peeled tomatoes with basil.  I put them in a large pan and mashed them down with a potato masher to get all of the juice out.  I then added 1 small can of tomato juice. Maybe in the summer when Jersey tomatoes come out, I'll try it with them.  I then followed the rest of the recipe.  Thanks Holly for a wonderful, easy, gourmet, recipe!!!

My husband had NEVER had a cream of tomato soup that he liked before this. He loves this soup! I puree the tomatoes with the skins on and we like to add rice for texture. I've tried substitutions out of necessity, while good, it's just not the same.

I have NEVER felt compelled to review a recipe before... but I have to say this is the most amazing soup!  It was so simple and the results are absolutely wonderful.  TASTY!  My only deviation from the recipe was to double the basil as some other posters suggested and to add minute rice (1 1/2 cups) after I pureed the tomato/basil mixture and let that cook for 5 minutes before adding the cream and butter.  I am so glad I went on instinct and doubled the recipe because now I have leftovers to bring to my sister who isn't feeling well.  Thanks Holly for a GREAT recipe I'll be adding to my cookbook and will make again.

This is a deliciously decadent soup...so good that it is dangerous to make often.  I substituted light cream instead of heavy and it still tasted wonderful.

This soup is unbelievable!  I substituted a can of peeled diced tomatoes, added a cup of minute rice, and it was soooooo good!

This was really good!  We have found that -just as the author said- DO NOT substitute lesser ingredients.  It definitely takes away from the quality of the soup.  In the end,  I made it the same as the author,  just added a couple more basil leaves and garnished with a slice of smoked Gouda.  yummm. :)  Edit:  I don't know when I first made this rating,  but I am back checking this recipe again.  We have used this now for years - my kids look forward to summer tomatoes in the garden explicitly for this soup. It has become a traditions - something my kids will remember eating on summer evenings.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I'm not usually a huge fan of either tomato soups or cream soups, so I was a little bit skeptical - but this soup was great!  You should know that it's a thin cream soup, even with the original recipe.  I added an extra tomato, and I only used two tablespoons of butter and a little more than half of the whipping cream.

My family says it's "the best soup in the world"! The key is using all the "real" ingredients, though I have gotten away with using half and half or whole milk when I didn't have any cream. TIP: If you substitute, heat the hh/milk in the microwave till it's pretty hot before adding it in, that way it doesn't cool down the soup too much before serving

This soup is so simple and yet so delicious. I usually make it in 2 serving batches for my husband and I with dinner. I use only 4 fresh basil leaves as I find this to be the perfect amount. Not overpowering. Just right. Awesome soup!

Oh my gosh, this is so good.  Fresh basil with this is an absolute must!  I added some garlic and put the basil in during the simmering process for more flavor.  I think next time I will add just a touch of sugar to ease the tartness, but otherwise this is awesome!

Not a bad recipe.  I used canned whole tomatoes and didn't bother to seed them.  I always use my hand blender (the boat motor) on stuff like this, and it was just fine.  My husband loved, loved, loved this soup.  I definitely liked it but prefer something without quite as much cream.  It's a pretty rich soup.

I liked this soup a lot.  My husband thought it had kind of a weird taste.  I think he's just not used to the high-class tastes of real cream and fresh basil.  :)

This recipe was amazing. I winged it on all the measurements and omited the butter. I started the recipe out with sauteed onion and diced carrots (this is what I put in place of the butter, explain that logic!), later adding quarted roma tomatoes. Creamy and delicious. :)

Made this yesterday, and it was so easy fabulous!  I doubled the recipe and gave half to my neighbors.  Just one thing- don't try to use a hand blender- you'll never get the basil chopped up that way.  A food processor is a must.

This tasted super fresh and very much like restaurant quality, peeling tomatos isn't that easy but fresh from my garden it sure was worth it - I also added small diced potatos and onions - thanks for this recipe I have been looking ang looking for a good tomato soup!

Rich and creamy says it all.  I used a "stick blender" by Braum instead of pouring it into another container.  This tastes just like the soup at La Madeleine's!  It is so rich, I just serve it in small cups with a sandwich.  I will make this again many many times.

I have made this soup many times, always with rave reviews! I add the basil leaves and some crushed garlic to the tomatos and juice while simmering for added flavor. I also use a stick blender to puree the soup right in the pan.

This is a wonderful, flavorful soup.  I agree, the fresh basil is a must. Perhaps a tad rich; I may try a little less butter next time.  But I know I'll make this again and again.

It did taste different from canned of course, but since it is much healthier without all the artificial ingredients, I will continue to make it.  I'll try some of the suggestions for changing it up a little.

This soup is amazing and exactly what you’d expect from an upscale restaurant. Just a note for my fellow lactose intolerant peeps; my family cannot have heavy cream so I replaced it with coconut milk (the kind you get in a can). I don’t think anyone would ever be able to tell the difference. This will definitely be made again.

followed recipe as is.  It was very good and I will be making it again.  It was just a bit too "buttery" for my palate.  Next time I will cut the butter in half.  Also wont worry about peeling and seeding the tomatoes next time.

I thought it delicious after I added a few spoonfuls of sugar. When I initially made it, it turned out a little acidic for my taste. The sugar did the trick and it was so yummy after! Quick and easy-- I will definitely make it again.

Made as directed, totally delicious! My local grocery store has herbs that have only been slightly dried in a small container. Yes, it's more expensive, but when you can't find fresh, it's a good alternative.

This is a really great soup as a base. The butter and heavy cream really make it. Salt, butter and heavy cream seem to be the secret to a lot of good foods.  I have been trying so many recipes for tomato basil soup with very bland results. After I made this, I figured I needed to dilute it with about 28 oz. of chicken stock instead of the added tomato juice or it is way to acidic. In the winter, I use a large can of really good tomatoes with no citric acid.  I do everything else, but I also add garlic and onion powder (after trying real garlic and sauteed simmerred onions with poor results.) I also add double the basil. I do a full tbsp. of salt. The rest is perfect. I do taste it and sometimes add a tbsp of sugar if the tomatoes are way too tart.  If it's not tart enough, I add 2 tbsp. of tomato paste. On occasion, I also add a raw red bell pepper and simmer for 30 minutes just for a difference in taste--it make it an almost different soup.. It's nice to add parm if you are in the mood for it too.

This is a great base recipe and fun to play with. Make sure to taste your food to see what it needs to be perfect. Tomatoes are seasonal and very in taste. So make sure to taste it and adjust as needed.  Salt, and butter are what make so many restaurant foods taste special, so don't skimp there.

Incredible! Made the recipe almost to the letter. Added more basil and less cream but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was phenomenal!!

Our wonderful neighbor has been bringing us lots of tomatoes and this was the perfect recipe to enjoy them. 
I used 6 tomatoes. 
I only had 7 fresh basil leaves, so I added an additional 1/4 cup dried basil. 
Instead of 4 cups tomato juice, I also used 2 cups crushed tomatoes and 2 cups tomato sauce. Very pleased with the outcome! Will definitely make again.

I had the BEST tomato basil soup at a restaurant and this tastes exactly like it! I add half of an onion and 3 garlic garlic cloves (I’m obsessed with garlic) to this recipe as well. I also serve it with a grilled cheese on marble rye bread with provolone cheese, it’s soo good. Definitely the perfect meal for a cold rainy day.

The soup to me was flavorless and would have received 2 stars. This review is based on the changes in I made, which was to add 2 -15oz cans of fire -roasted diced tomatoes to give it the flavor boost I desired. I also added 1/2 t Tabasco chipotle sauce for a little heat.

I followed the recipe exactly as written (except I used an immersion blender), and when it was done I tasted it. Something was off with the flavor. It was hearty and creamy and very tomato-ey, but it was missing something. I realized it was missing the natural sweetness of tomatoes, which may have been the Roma tomatoes that I used. I ended up sprinkling about a tablespoon of sugar into the soup (little by little until I hit the right balance), and then it was perfect.

Great recipe! Like others suggested I didn’t peel the tomatoes but did remove the seeds. I’m always looking to make things healthier so I used only half the amount of butter & 1 cup of silken tofu instead. Tastes just as good and creamy as originally posted. Can’t get enough of this soup!

Just perfect tomato soup! I scaled this down to 3 servings. For the tomatoes, I used a 14.5 oz can of diced, no-sodium tomatoes. The juice I had was 'vegetable' juice. I'm not keen on dealing with hot liquids and a blender, so I did things differently. I first pureed the tomatoes and 1 cup of juice first. Then added that and rest of juice to the soup pot. No fresh basil available unfortunately, so I used a few shakes of dried basil and some squirts of the refrigerated tube basil, a little garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper and a tblsp of brown sugar. Let it simmer for 15 min. I cut in half the amounts of the cream and butter with no problem. The soup was not too thin or too thick and had a wonderful flavor.  So comforting on a cold winter day!

I've been searching for a tomato basil soup recipe for awhile now, and with a few tweaks, this one is wonderful on a cold, stormy day.  I used vine-ripe tomatoes, and I did peel and remove the seeds. I reduced the butter to 1/3 cup and minced 4-5 garlic cloves, which I added with the basil.

I doubled the recipe and thought it tasted really good prior to adding the cream and butter. So, I held off on a stick of butter as it seemed excessive. Double guessed myself and eventually added it and didn't see the benefit. Wish I had gone with my gut. It is still delish but visually has more fat than is needed for the flavor and richness.

This was a hit at my house!  My kiddo loves soups but this tops it.  He ate it for 4 days and has asked me to make it again.  So, thank you!  It is so simple and super tasty.

This was spot on, no tweaks at all. This was a yummy decadent bowl of soup. Paired with a good grilled cheese sandwich, and it’s the perfect comfort meal.

I tripled the recipe to accommodate guests, with resulted in necessary modifications. I reduced the 3 cups of cream to two, and the butter to 1/2 cup vs 1-1/2 cups. further, I increased the basil to taste. High flavor, quite decadent. Folks will request more. (BTW: I served the soup with grilled cheese sandwiches, so I really had to modify the fat content some.)

I used about half the amount of cream and butter. It's a delicious soup, but the richness of the dairy will diminish the flavor of the tomatoes if you add too much. This is definitely going to be a winter staple for me.

Very good! I did sauté 1 clove of garlic before adding the tomatoes, and I let it simmer for 2 hours before adding cream and basil and butter. I used very ripe, fresh tomatoes and I seeded them but did not peel them. Next time I will definitely take the time to peel them as there were bits of peel in the soup that we kept fishing out! An immersion blender worked perfectly to purée and you don’t have to worry about how hot it is and can do it all at once in the same pot.

I was shocked how easy this was to make. The flavors are excellent, so creamy, buttery, and if you like basil, it makes you think you have gone to food heaven. We had grilled cheese sandwiches on sour dough bread with our soup.  I woke up in the night thinking I wanted more :). Excellent.

I love tomato basil soup, but this was through the roof awesome, and so easy to make. The entire family loved it.
I order tomato basil soup any chance I get in restaurants, and nothing I've had comes close to this. And I was fortunate to have fresh basil from the garden as well as fresh locally grown tomatoes. The only thing I altered in the recipe was that I cut the amount of basil in half, only because the rest of my family isn't as big on herbs as I am, and it didn't seem to hurt the flavor at all. The basil still came shining through. From this point forward this recipe is the only one I'll use.

This was awesome! I used Campbell's tomato juice. I did peel and seed the tomatoes, (after bringing to a boil) and added a bit of garlic powder; otherwise didn't change it. I pureed it in the blender.  Thank you!  (Note to self: I also froze some of this and thawed it out and it was still great. )

We really like this recipe!  And have made it several times.  Because of the heavy cream and butter, my husband calls it "Fat Soup"! ;-)  We enjoy it, we make it...and I really hate to look for a healthier alternative - because I think it would be difficult to find one that is so rich tasting!

I made this last night and it was SOOOOOO good. I did have to alter it a bit by using fat-free half and half instead of the heavy cream. I also happened to have a red pepper that was getting to that sad and slightly wilted point so I diced that up and threw it in as well. It was delicious! It had some great flavors and a wonderful tang to it. Thank you so much!

So good! I made triple the servings to have some to freeze. I also cut the butter and the cream in half as recommended by everyone and it came out perfect. I used fresh tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden, which I definitely recommend. I had to add a little flour to thicken it up a bit just an 1/8 of a cup. I did peel the tomatoes but kept the seeds. Super easy and fast recipe.

It was creamy as expected, but the amount of basil called for turned out to be too strong for my family's taste.  I will make it again, but cut the basil in half or more.

Absolutely delicious! I cook meals from scratch daily for my job, and cream of tomato soup is one of my favourite things in the world - so I’m quite picky. I used a bunch of fresh basil in mine, as well as roma tomatoes. It turned out beautifully. Such a simple, yet elegant and scrumptious recipe.

Was trying to decide what to make for supper and thought  I'd try this soup. It was excellent!  I doubled the recipe, used fresh Romas's.  We like garlic so I did add 1 1/2 tablespoons. I also sprinkled with fresh parmesan cheese just before serving. Paired with fresh made bread this is a great meal and my wife loved it!

As is, it's an ok soup. I read quite a few complaints about the soup being too acidic, and as the recipe is written I have to agree. It's a super easy fix- add sugar! Sugar is the secret spice in pretty much any tomato based soup or sauce that tames down the acidity. Without any sugar, this soup tasted to me like heartburn. I added a bit of sugar and it is fantastic! Rich, buttery and delicious. 

If you don't like a strong basil flavor, you can try cooking the basil with the tomatoes and tomato juice. It kind of tones down the herby-ness of the basil. 

Also, I highly recommend passing this through a strainer after you puree it. A stick blender works great to puree and is easy to clean up. 

I'll probably make this soup again, but I'll always make it with a bit of sugar.

I love this recipe and have made it several times over the last year.  I use 2 28oz. Cans of whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. I pour them into the pot and crush them with my hands. There's plenty of liquid already so I don't add any more juice. I add the basil, about a tsp. of sea salt, some cracked black pepper and a scant tsp. of sugar (I feel several of you cringing at this??).  At this point I follow the recipe, except I use an immersion blender.  Awesome!

One can of whole peeled tomatoes (undrained) to half a pint of light whipping cream and omit the butter. Gives the same result with less fat.

My favorite soup to make. To save time, I just use a 28oz can of crushed or diced tomatoes instead of cooking and peeling them myself (I have made it both ways and don't notice a difference). So easy!

My family begs for this soup as soon as it starts to get chilly out. Hands down the best tomato basil soup recipe I've found. One of the very few recipes I do not alter to improve. Absolutely love this.

This was my first time ever trying to make something like this.  I followed the recipe exactly.

My husband is an Executive Chef and we once owned a restaurant where he would make Tomato Basil Soup just like this.  I doubled the recipe and did not want to share any of it with family, but did.  Everyone loved it.    

It is time consuming from scratch and I did get advice from my husband on how to cut corners (use can tomatoes or don't peel the tomatoes and use a strainer) and get the same results.  I will definitely make it again and again.

This was my first time makjng this soup. After reading through about a dozen reviews I decided to just mix and match different ideas and do what I thought best and had on hand. My S.O. said it was better than the restaurants! I served it with a Reuben sandwich also from allrecipes.com...perfect winter night dinner!

Really really, good! It was pretty easy to make too. I wish I had an immersion blender. I put it in the food prosser and it worked great. My kids loved it too. I followed another reviewers recommendation and did not peel the tomatoes.

I added some fresh garlic and onion to the unpeeld tomatoes and juice, and simmered together for an hour. But this soup still seemed to lack "something."  Didn't have enough depth of flavors.  Just didn't wow me.

AMAZING.  Super easy and fresh. Used fresh tomatos, blanched them to remove the skins but didn't bother with removing the seeds.  Doubled the recipe and added two cloves of garlic and fresh tarragon (because I had it).   My entire family loved this.  Great for the kids lunches, even froze some for this winter.

This was a very easy recipe and tasted great. I had fresh tomatoes from the garden to use up but I didn't have tomato juice on hand.  I improvised and used Mr T's Bloody Mary mix (no alcohol). It was perfect, lots of flavor and not too spicy.

This is a favorite of mine- we grow fresh basil and tomatoes in our garden.  This recipe was definitely a must.
Remove skin and all seeds/ acid substance from the tomatoes.
We just bought the store brand tomato juice and it worked just fine.
Also, if you don't  have an immersion blender, just remove the chunks from the soup to purée and add it back- same with the basil leaves.

One thing I would change is to add only half the amount of cream and butter 

Other than that, very good served with grilled mozerella cheese and pesto sandwiches

Used home canned tomatoes from the garden instead of fresh and so I did not do the first 30 minute cook time.  The kids were asking for seconds, even the four year old boys.  This is so good.  My husband said restaurant quality.

Do not skimp on the fresh basil! I used dried and it was not aromatic enough and did not contrast the soup well enough. Other than than that mistake I felt the soup was too creamy and I am a lover of thick creamy soup. If I made this again I would cut the heavy cream by half and then add to taste! (Also as another user pointed out - don't bother peeling the tomatoes, you puree it anyway :))

I made this tonite for dinner and it was outstanding.  I made it for eight people and tripled the recipe.  I did use two large cans of whole tomatoes instead of fresh ones since the choice at the supermarket wasn't fantastic.  Also I cut back on the butter slightly.. Everyone loved it and I will be making it again.  Highly recommended

Very easy and tasty recipe. Served it with parmesan crusted sourdough grilled cheese. Tripled the recipe, added 4 garlic cloves and simmered the tomato juice and tomatoes for 3hours.

This was so yummy! I added fresh garlic and then some garlic powder at the end with a tad more salt and topped it with grated parm. Took this for lunch two days in a row and was so satisfied :)

My family loves this recipe. My kids thought the basil over powered the soup so I used a little less basil the second time around. I will definitely make this again!

I made this just as it was written. Delicious! I will agree it is restaurant worthy! I just had a tomato basil soup in a restaurant in Cincinnati last week. The only thing that was different, I didn't have the croutons to go in mine. Will be a go to recipe for me .

This is definitely a keeper!  I made this recipe as is, but used spicy tomato juice (generic brand was fine) and topped it with a  few small basil leaves and some croutons.  Can't wait to have some more.  May try using Half and Half next time just to cut down on calories.  Thank you, MARBALET, for sharing this recipe!

I used canned stewed tomatoes, rotel,  and didn't do the the fresh basil (just a basil seasoning) and it was still a hit at my restaurant. As a matter of fact, I have people calling everyday asking that I serve it daily instead of doing it as an occasional soup of the day.

My anemic tomatoes did not do this recipe justice, and yet it was delicious anyway! Can't wait to try it in the summer when the tomatoes are ripe and juicy! I followed the recipe exactly. My husband came back for seconds!

This is my "go to" tomato soup recipe. I use organic ingredients and tomatoes from the garden. It's so tomato-y. Adding anything else would seem like sacrilege.

Not as good as La Madeleine, but darn close!  I was fortunate to use tomatoes out of my backyard garden, which made it even better :)  I followed the instructions exactly...didn't change up anything.  I can't wait to make this again, and might try it with my yellow tomatoes next time.

I found that the soup was lacking something, so I added sugar. Once I added sugar, the soup was delicious.

I had an abundance of tomatoes in the summer so I roasted around 8 pans of Roma tomatoes. I then froze them so I use them to make this soup plus a can of organic diced tomatoes and a box of organic chicken broth.  Saute onions, garlic and plenty of basil. It's yummy!!!

My first attempt turned out not as thick as a La Madeleine  but still very, very, very good.  Wow, can't wait to continue to experiment and make this more often.  It's really wonderful.  And yes, I also added some sugar at the end.

Flavour is fantastic, however I find the consistency too thin. Followed instructions completely as written, but made a double-batch to take advantage of tomato season. Maybe that is the problem. Not sure if I should try adding a roux or more cream. Hopefully can salvage it and bring it up to 5 stars.

Tasted too strong. Maybe because I simmered for too long? Next time simmer for the 1/2 hr and not 4 hrs like another suggested.
Bellow are my notes with bits of others reviews:
Canned diced tomatoes: 45oz (=5cups) and omitted juice, add 2 tsp sugar at end of cooking (takes away some acidic bite of tinned tomatoes), less flavourful than fresh tomatoes and has a sharper taste (it's quite sharp).
Fresh tomatoes: use redest, ripest tomatoes for best flavour, no need to peel or seed tomatoes (peel if you don't blend fully) (add sugar if you keep seeds as seeds make it more bitter)
Flavour: can add cooked bacon (grease for frying and bacon for garnish ontop of soup), can add chicken or veg. stock, fry up onions and 2 garlic w tomatoes, add more basil if you prefer more, add a touch of lemon juice
Good with: Wraps, toasted cheese sandwiches, warm corn bread
Garnish with a slice of fresh mozzarella cheese and a sprig of basil. Or sprinkle fresh grated Parmesan and a few basil leaves. 
Tips: let cool a bit before blending, don't blend basil too much (looks better with chunks), runny soup = blend fully, chunky = blend much less, simmer tomatoes w juice longer for a better taste - (simmer 4 hrs), cut cream in 1/2 and only use 1/3 c butter for myself or those who get heart burn w so much fat
Great as a sauce over chicken or pasta.

I usually dump a bunch of spices in food, but I didn't here. And what a good idea that was! Don't change a thing to this recipe, have it with grilled cheese and it's perfect!

This was the best tomato basil soup I've ever had. I cut back a bit on the butter and heavy creme and it was still delish. I used fresh basil from my garden and it was perfect. Try this one, it's a keeper.

This is a wonderfully simple soup!  I used fresh  frozen tomatoes that I had in the freezer, and Himalayan salt with the fresh basil, LOT'S OF IT!.  I didn't boil the tomatoes, just enough heat to soften them to keep the nutrients, and then just used my Bosh sick mixer.  Also, I didn't have cream on hand so I used 3.8 milk and it was  smooth and creamy.  My husband loved it! MashaAllah!

This is the first time I tried making a tomato basil soup and I am so glad I picked this recipe! I've roasted the tomatoes a bit (halved then broiled for ~10-15 mins in the oven--makes the skin fall right off) to ease  pealing then before adding the diced tomatoes and tomato juice I added a little olive oil in the pot and added a couple of crushed garlic cloves (both me and the wife love garlic) and fried them just a bit in the oil so their juices spread. In the end step I also added some oregano and grated parmesan cheese. The result was the most delicious tomato basil soup I ever had.

Great but I made a few changes to make it even better. 
1. Don't skimp on Basil, I added about 25 leaves. 
2. You DON'T need 1/2 cup of butter. I used 1/4 and it was still creamy and delicious. 
3. You DON'T need 1 cup of Heavy Creme, I used 1/2. 

Fab soup!

I laugh when I read reviews, especially when they are negative. As in this case, a person had used canned tomatoes and or dried herbs and wonders why it wasn't that good,  well duh? Bottom line: this recipe is a great base to start with. For those of you who are learning to cook, my mom always told me, "you can always add, you can't subtract, so taste as you go". If you like onion, add onion, if you like garlic, add garlic, if you like hamburger meat, add hamburger meat. I am from New Jersey, but live and Arizona, so the ONLY thing I wish I could change is where the tomato came from that I had to use!

I make this all the time. There's no such thing as too much basil. Add the cream slowly and taste as you go, but it's absolutely delicious and tough to fail.

This is one of my go to soup recipes, especially when I have company coming. It is a delicious soup and takes no time at all to put together.  You have to make it using fresh tomatoes! I use 5 brown (yes they are real and available at most supermarkets, and they have a great flavor)  and I just cut them in halves. I do not peel them, but I do remove the seeds. That is important to do ALWAYS remove the seed from the tomatoes that you choose to use! It will give the soup an odd flavor if you don't. I also use regular v8, I have used low sodium before and it will not have the same flavor. Next, I use "Kerry Gold" butter, either salted or unsalted is fine, but it has to be butter, not spread or margarine. I also use about 16 to 20 basil leaves depending on the size of them.  I then mix with a blender wand until smooth. I also add about 3 tablespoons of dried onion after blending. You can use half and half if you prefer to not use heavy cream, I have in the past and it's just a smidge thinner soup. All in all I've made this dozens of times and I've played with it and found that sometimes you just have to have a crazy fattening soup day. As I've said before, this is one of my best recipes for company and I always end up giving the recipe with them when they go.  I also make this with what my fiancé calls the "fancy grilled cheese" sandwich. Use good sour dough bread, mayo, grey poupon Dijon mustard (not the grainy stuff) thin sliced green apple, bacon and white cheddar cheese. Yum

This soup was delicious, perfectly creamy and easy to make. Make sure to get real cream and fresh tomatoes! I would also let it simmer for an hour at least which helps give it that pure and sweet tomatoe taste! I also added garlic to give it a little bit of sour and acidity ! Also there is NO NEED to Do anything to the tomatoes , just dice them and put them in !

Very labor intensive and not pleasant tasting. This was the first time I blanched, peeled and seeded tomatoes at least in recent years. What a messy pain the butt! Followed recipie to a T.  The finished product is very acidic. Not at all creamy in flavor. My search continues for a homemade Cambells tomato soup (made with a can of milk and not water) tasting recipie.

Made just as directed except for using an immersion blender to purée, so I didn't even have to remove it from my stock pot. Tastes amazing! This is exactly the taste I imagine when I crave tomato basil soup. Can't wait to eat it tomorrow with a grilled cheese sandwich on sourdough bread. Thanks!

Bellisimo!  I grew orange and yellow tomatoes for low acidity and had a huge harvest.  I love these tomatoes,  and they are more gentle on my sensitive tummy.  I also struck gold in my basil patch so i was heavy on the amount I used.  A few plants went to flower and it made a sweet and pretty garnish.  

I doubled the recipe and followed with full cream and butter.  Totally worth it as a restaurant quality soup for a mom home with 6 teens.

Yes I will make this again and no more store bought soup. I made my own tomatoe juice since that was the original purpose of this soup to help reduce the abundance of tomatoes I had from the garden. I did not use skin. And only pureed the chunks of tomatoes I took out w strained spoon and added to basil as told.  My husband likes elbow noodles in his soup so I added that. But it is amazing without.  The whole family wanted more. This recipe by its self is enough for only 2-4. W noodles it was 4.5 servings. Loves the taste. My family was impressed.  13 yr old 4 yr old and 10 month old. Me and my husband.

This is one of those recipes that tastes better after refrigerating for a day or so. Followed it as stated but cooked the fresh tomatoes down slowly; for about 2 hours covered. It was very tasty but I recommend as others. Cut the cream in half or maybe just use whole milk.

Delicious soup! The only changes I made were cutting the butter in half and using 1/3 regular whipping cream.. I also added 5 cloves of crushed garlic to the tomatoes and a couple pinches of sugar towards the end. The soup was a hit and tasted even better than the soup I had at La Madeleine!

This soup was delicious! Because I love garlic I added a few cloves to the broth along with fresh peppercorn. I allowed it to simmer all together for a longer period of time, about an hour, so that all the flavors would be absorbed. To be healthier I reduced the amount of heavy whipping cream. I added a little at a time until I reached the flavor I wanted. This soup is on my list for parties because it is so easy to make ahead of time.

I used to work in Cosi and loved Tomato Basil soup. This was my first time I made tomato basil soup myself and it was delicious. Recipe is very easy to follow , I only made one mistake which was blending the mixture too much.  It should taste better if there are little chunks of tomato.  Anyway I love it.

Ultimately, the consistency was velvety and the flavor was delicious. My initial mistake was trying to use fresh vine ripe tomatoes in NOVEMBER. I recommend canned only if you are not making this in season. You will be able to tell if your tomatoes won't make a strong soup if during the blanching process your tomatoes falls apart and becomes grainy. They will also lack flavor. Therefore, My batch needed an extra amount of canned tomatoes to balance the dominant richness from the cream and  butter. Overall this is the perfect basic recipe that is flexible enough to handle adjustment and still turn out great.

I try and often times fail. This was great! Loved it! Will make it again. Followed the directions with only the addition of garlic powder.

I found this soup very disappointing.  First, of all it took 1 1/2 hours to make, not 45 minutes.  The prep took 1/2 hour.  Second, although it tasted delicious, I got one of the worst cases of Acid Reflux I've ever had.  Sorry!

This was pretty good. I think I had some pretty large tomatoes, so it wasn't as rich as I expected, but I also didn't seed and peel based on others' reviews. Maybe next time I will actually do that, or add more cream/butter. It had a great basil flavor.

Slight modifications: I had some sweet onion leftover with the greens on top still, about a 1/4 cup max, so I threw that in there. I also added 4 large cloves of garlic. Garnished with chives and some parmesan.

Perfect! I used 2 cups Pastene Kitchen Ready tomatoes and 2 cups low salt V-8 juice, 2 cloves roasted garlic and I roasted the fresh tomatoes before adding them into the soup. I also added just a bit of freshly grated parmesan.

This was easy and delicious, and a good way to use up the last of the basil in our garden. Served with dark bread with melted tex-mex cheese on top. with the richness of this dish, it canonly be a once in a while treat.  Thanks!

Super Yummy! I added 1 clove crushed garlic and a bay leaf during the 1simmer time, removed the bay leaf and blended.  Added 1 table spoon corn starch in the last 20 mins. AMAZING!  Get your best grilled cheese sandwich ready, this soup is it's soul mate.

This was a great flavor soup...nice and hearty. The only complaints from the family were that the texture was a little course...not smooth. Maybe I didn't cook veges long enough? Will try again next time cooking veges longer.

Deeee-licious!  I've made it twice in 24 hours. First time I followed the recipe and added some minced garlic. I seeded but did not peel the tomatoes.   Second time I used half the amount of cream and milk for the remaining liquid.  I also cut the butter in half to save calories. It is fabulous either way!

Very good, but I would change a couple things - a little acidic, so I might add some sugar to the tomatoes as others have suggested.  For me, I couldn't eat it without a little guilt knowing how much cream and butter was in it, so I would probably reduce the amounts of those ingredients in the recipe.  It also could use a little spiciness, but it was not bland by any means.  I also skinned and seeded the tomatoes by myself, and this was messy and time consuming, so I will go canned tomatoes next time.  It was rich and tasty overall.

I am living in a dorm with limited cooking facilites. I have been hunting for recipies I can make with my single skillet. This is it! I didnt puree anything and it still tastes great! I added a fresh clove of garlic and used more than four tomatoes(but they were small). Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. Thank you! New favorite(:

This recipe is very good. Just let the soup simmer about an hour and don't add the basil until the end and use and immersion blender. Drizzle with mexican crema and serve. It is delicious.

Made this for the first time last night. I wish I'd read the suggestions in a lot of these reviews before making it.  I ended up having to double the amount of tomato juice and add in some tomato paste to counter the entire half cup of butter I'd already added which was way too much.  It turned out fantastic though, so like many of the other reviews - cut the butter AND cream in half. You'll be glad you did! It's a fantastic recipe otherwise. So delicious and will certainly be a staple in our household.

Very yummy.  I have to agree that the cream diminished the tomato/basil flavor, so I doubled the basil after tasting.  Next time I will simmer the tomatoes longer to intensify the flavor.  Will definitely be making this again!

I decided to steer away from the traditional Polish tomato soup for something more flavourful. This soup provides the perfect creamy texture with a blast of flavour. Love, love this recipe.

I wanted to like this.  I love creamy tomato soup and  make it all the time.  But I was looking for something a little different to try and decided to give this a shot.  Good tomatoes are not to be found at the store right now, so I used a can of high quality fire-roasted diced tomatoes (my favorite brand that I use all the time), and I used jarred, pureed tomatoes instead of juice (again a brand that's my favorite that I use all the time).  The end result just didn't cut it for me.  It was more cream/butter flavor with a very slight tomato flavor, but without the onions and garlic I usually use, it was pretty bland.  I have never used butter in my tomato soup (always use olive oil) nor do I normally use more than a quarter cup or so of cream, so this one was really too buttery/creamy for me.  I did not find the basil flavor too much.  Thanks for the idea to try, but I'll have to stick to my usual version.

I have made this recipe several times over the past year.  It is great as is but quite fattening.  I have used half the butter (1/4c) and subbed skim milk and it still tastes great!!

I love this soup! I have made is several times and it has turned out awesome every time! The local market was out of fresh basil one time and I substituted 2 1/2 TBS of dried basil, still awesome! If you really want to take it to another level, add 1 pound of cooked crispy bacon to the soup. That's right, I said a pound of bacon!

I used jarred tomatoes (specialty) w tomato juice.  No fresh basil in the house so I used frozen basil 'cubes'.  Found in your freezer section.  10 small cubes, 1 cube = 1 tsp basil.  Used NO butter (found it didn't need it) and used 1/2 and 1/2 (fat free).  Salt and pepper to taste.  Was super rich and creamy.  Was less than 1 cup of half and half.  Perfect paired with grilled cheese sandwich on french bread.

This recipe is amazing. I'm not sure why it got bad reviews! I made a half recipe for my husband and I and it was more than enough. Instead of using fresh tomatoes, I just bought 2 cans of tomatoes and I used V8 Tomato juice. It turned out super sweet and super good! I also added garlic which brought out the taste of the tomatoes and the basil. This soup is a definite must-have for anyone who participates with lent!

I'm not a huge tomato fan but I tried this one for my family. I peeled the tomatoes and removed the seeds. After adding the cream and butter, I found the flavor too tomato-y (maybe it was the tomatoes I got). I whipped up some of the remaining cream, added sugar to the cream and then put in a couple of dollops to balance. My son told me, "it doesn't look like tomato soup but it sure tastes like it!"

WOW! Best tomato soup ever. My husband and I were amazed at how great this was! I made the recipe as is - although I did use Roma tomatoes and ended up doubling the amount of tomatoes called for due to their smaller size. This is now going to be our go to recipe! Thank-you so much for a great recipe!! If you are making this - do not change a thing!

Just made this and it's delish'! The only thing I would change is that I put the tomatoes, tomato juice, and basil in the blender before cooking. I just pulsed it until smooth. I used two cans of San Marzano tomatoes in juice and one can of tomato sauce.
 I used two table spoons of dried basil instead of the fresh basil. Aside from this things this recipe is perfect as is! A real keeper!

I think the cream was a nice touch, but the soup overall had a tart flavor, not the rich tomato flavor I was hoping for.  I also didn't care for the buttery flavor. And the soup definitely needed a good bit more basil.  If I try making it again, I would double the amount of basil.  To be fair, I halved the recipe...sometimes that can affect the quality of a dish.  But I wasn't able to figure out how to get the flavor I was going for.

Because tomatoes are no longer in season, I substituted good quality whole canned tomatoes, undrained, with a little chicken broth, and I skipped the tomato juice.  I used the full amount of cream but only half the butter.  I really liked this but next time I think I'll reduce the cream by about 1/4, maybe work my way down to 1/2, we'll see.  Thank you for the recipe -- almost exactly what I was looking for!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC soup -definitely restaurant quality! I served this with grilled cheese sandwiches made of wheat bread from the bread machine -It was eaten up instantly, even by my 8 yr old who said he did not like tomato soup!
Modifications: added 2/3 only of the butter.

This is a great basic creamy tomato basil soup.  Very easy to put together.  And very, very tasty.  Hubby and I both really enjoyed it. For a little fuller flavor, stir just a dash of nutmeg in when you stir in the butter and cream.  Fantastic!

Really yummy! I did add about a tablespoon of sugar and used 6 rather than 8 tablespoons of butter. Also I only pureed about half the soup (but all of the basil leaves) for texture. My husband LOVED this. Served with grilled cheese. Will be making again.

As written, it was too acidic.  Has to add honey to mask the acidity.  Other than that the flavor was nothing special.  Probably will not make again.

Very delicious. My family always asks for this soup. Sometimes I cheat and use canned diced tomatoes instead of whole. Tastes just like the one from our hometown Italian restaurant.

This is my guilty pleasure soup, since it cant be good for you. I make it exactly as the recipe calls for, only I about double the amount of basil. I use canned peeled tomatoes, with the seeds. I puree the tomatoes before simmering (I leave them kinda chunky), and when done I just add a small bit back into my food processor along with the basil. Ill also say, this time around I made a stupid mistake and accidentally bought v-8 juice instead of tomato juice. So I used the 1c of tomato juice that was in the canned tomatoes, 2c of v-8, and then 1c of bloody mary mix since its richer and more tomato-y than v-8. It still came out fantastic, I honestly couldnt even tell the difference!

the first time i tried tomato basil tomato soup at Chicago's Nordstoms cafe i knew i had found a new love. I knew i had to hold to this new love, and i was able to do that with this recipe. This receipe was absolutely delicious, decadent, and made me feel like i was sitting by the fireplace wrapped up in cozy cashmere sweater drinking coco. The next time i will add two extra roma tomatoes, seeded, to make it more creamy, and then cut down on the butter and cream a little.

Very good but used half and half instead of heavy cream and 1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 c. to make it not as fattening.  I also added 1 garlic clove and 1/4 c. sun dried tomatoes.

growing up on canned tomato soup, the idea of it could make me cringe. I never thought I could WANT to eat tomato soup. This recipe has totally changed my mind. It is rich and decadent. I used organic tomato juice in the jar to avoid any metallic tastes based on other comments I read. 1st batch I was after copying a tomato quinoa I tried recently at a catered event. I t was perfect, but my family did not like the texture with the quinoa added, so I made a nother batch for them 3 days later. It is perfect without any tweaks.

Soooo good!  The only change I made was to use half and half instead of cream to save on calories.  It would have been richer with the cream, but honestly this soup tasted great even before I added the half and half so you could vary the recipe several ways.

12 STARS!  I've been looking for this recipe for 8 years, and in that time, I've tried 10 different ones.  This soup is what I've been waiting for-it may be the best soup I've ever had, and by far the best I've ever made! I did as other reviewers recommended and used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 Half and Half, and it was spectacular.  Do yourself a favor and make this soup as close to written as possible.  Your arteries might shudder as you're adding real butter and heavy cream, but it's worth it to experience what this recipe is supposed to taste like.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

OK, I completely cheated on this recipe and it was still the best soup ever.  Just as good as Jason's Deli version.  I used canned tomatoes with Basil and dried Basil and chicken stock and it still turned out delicious.  I added a topping of mozzarella cheese and my family was licking the bowls.  Great served with simple BLTs!

I love this soup ... however, I always make one small addition that really makes it great ... a splash of liquid smoke!

Mmmmm Mmmmmm good! I really loved this soup. I used canned diced tomatoes blended with tomato soup since tomatoes are out of season right now. It was great on a cold night.

not sure if i did something wrong or what, but it tasted awful. it tasted bitter and had a cheesy taste to it? it also looked a very washed out colour (I've put a picture of it) the only thing i didn't do was add the salt and pepper. maybe it will taste better with pepper, but i can't see it making a difference.

I've always made  my own soups, so was delighted to find such a yummy tomato soup.  A little rich, but don't skimp on the cream or try half n half - it just won't be as delicious.  Try it as it is after all you are not going to have this every day and a little self indulgence never hurts.

Not quite sure what went wrong here, but the soup turned out to have this awfully bitter/sharp taste! I couldn't finish drinking it honestly, and it was quite embarrassing w/ my guests! Maybe some sugar was missing? Not sure what it was, but I am definitely not going to be making this again. Ever!

This soup was a smash hit with everyone I made it for.  It is very rich and creamy and fresh basil and tomatoes from the garden make this soup perfect.

I had to use cherry tomatoes because I  had them and did not want them to go to waste, therefore I did not peel them (too many). At fisrt the soup had too many "chunks" because the tomato skin was too tough to eat but once I strained it the soup was AWESOME! Plan to try again with larger tomatoes that I have been peeled.

This recipe kicks butt!  I manage a bakery/cafe and one of the staff made this soup as our soup of the day.  She used fresh tomatoes, not canned along with the fresh basil.  She did switch the whipping cream to coffee cream & milk, used margarine instead of butter & added grated parm & cheddar.  I think she also added roasted red peppers too.  All that being said, this soup is awesome without the additions & with the changes it is equally awesome - we sold out of it!!  It'll make your eyes roll to the back of your head - it's that amazing!

One word!!! YUM!!!!  This was so good.  I didn't bother skinning or deseeding the 4 large roma tomatoes, and I added two huge cloves of garlic, chopped, to the tomatoes and tomato juice while cooking.  I definitely used heavy whipping cream and a half stick of real butter --- absolutely heavenly.  I added a few more basil leaves as well.  Thanks for sharing this delish recipe.  This is my first ever review!

This is hands down the best tomato soup I have had outside of a restaurant!  I have made this many times for soup swaps at work and everyone loves it.  This soup does freeze pretty well...you will just need to make sure to stir it well before serving.  I have also made a dairy free version of this for my lactose intolerant friend using Tofuti sour cream in place of the heavy cream.  There is no difference in taste or consistency and I have actually found that this version freezes better than the original!

This was very tasty - I ended up using more tomatoes (6) instead of the 4 it called for, but left the rest of the ingredients per the recipe. The only other addition I made was 1 TBS. of sugar. As with most soups, it was even tastier the next day! We served it with a piece of crusty french bread at the bottom of each bowl and poured the soup over it - yum!

Peeling and seeding tomatoes is my most dreaded task in the kitchen. It's just tedious for me, but for this soup it is totally worth it! It's FANTASTIC. I serve it to everyone and it's a big hit in our family.

Thought this tasty, but definately not a diet dish.  It was very easy and I liked that it used fresh tomatoes.  I just thought it needed just a little something else....a little sauted onion or garlic blended with the tomatoes, or another spice.  But, again, easy and tasty.

It was good, but not great. Maybe the tomatoes I used weren't the best. When I make it again, I don't think I'll puree it because it needs a little substance to it. I think I'll also try canned diced tomatoes as another reviewer suggested. I also added cheese bread croutons and a sprinkle of shaved Parmesan cheese. That helped with taste, but definitely made a bad for you soup a little bit worse.

I made this recipe for dinner last night, using the exact ingredients, and did not like it. I love tomato soup, but I found this recipe to be too sour. However, I gave it three stars because my husband loved it and has asked me to make it again.

This was delicious and easy.  I only made a couple minor changes. I didnt have cream so I used a half evaporated milk and half milk. Also I used canned tomatoes and used 2 cans. Surprisingly my 5 year old loved this and she HATES tomaotes. Ive tried since to get her eat other tomato soups and she wont have it. So we're making it tonight. I have half n half so Ill try that and we just picked 12 lbs of toms from the orchard so I'll try fresh ones this time. Im sure it will be great.

Don't substitute. I tried using half-and-half and it was good, but I can see how the flavor of the half-and-half wasn't strong enough to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Next time I'd skip simmering and just blend everything, too. Otherwise, awesome!

This was quite good. I used milk in place of cream, smart balance butter, sauteed garlic and onion before adding the tomatoes and tomato juice, and added 2 low sodium chicken broth cubes while simmering. I didn't remove the skins or seeds and pureed everything in my vitamix. Poof! Perfectly smooth soup! Thanks for the recipe.

This didn't turn out that great to me. It could be because the tomatoes I bought were not flavorful enough, but to me it had very little flavor. I love tomato soup of all kinds, and had recently had excellent creamy tomato soup at a restaurant - and I had a hard time finishing this.

I really love tomato soup.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor this.  I would have liked to taste the basil a bit more.  It was really good though for my first time making a homemade tomato soup.

This was so easy and delicious! I did substitue Fat Free half and half to lighten it up (as I do most recipes) Also used 1/4 of butter and sauteed about 3 cloves of garlic in a little olive oil first. Put it in the blender for a creamy texture! Don't skimp on the basil!

Made it exactly as called for - and scalding myself in the process due to an improperly fitted blender top - and this was absolute heaven.  I had the most lovely tomato soup in a little restaurant in Interlachen, Switzerland, and since then have dreamed of being able to replicate that bit of heaven at home.  THIS is the recipe for true tomato soup afficionados.  It is creamy, it is zesty, it is full-flavored, and it is just plain delicious!

Very good soup.  Followed the recipe other than cut the butter in half and added 1/4 cup of honey (as another rater recommended) as it initially was too acid.  After adding the honey it's very good!

Incredible soup!  Very easy and simple.  I may try reducing a little of the cream and butter next time (for fat content)  but it matched the taste and quality of fine dining.  I have been dying to reproduce the taste of soup that I had at a nice restaurant in our hometown, now I can have it whenever I want!   I did let the  juice and tomato mixture cool a little bit before putting it in my food processor to puree.  So it added more prep/cook time.

We absolutely loved this soup.  This is perfect to take for lunches as well.  I substituted fresh basil for dried.  Next time I'm going to try using Organic Crushed Tomatoes as suggested in the comments here.

I made the soup for 50 on Ash Wednesday.  Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a #10 Can of restaurant grade tomato puree.  I also substituted half the tomato juice with hot & spicy V8.  Then served with french bread cut in half, slathered with garlic butter and mexican mix cheese broiled and cut.  It was a huge hit.

Since good tomatoes are hard to find in the winter i give the soup a squirt of (tubed) tomato past concentrate.  It gives it the extra yum.  I have made this soup 5 times and LOVE it!

Love this recipe!  However if you want the soup a little thicker just made a roux with 5 Tbsp. of the butter and 1/2 cup flour.  I did this and it thickened the soup up to a great consistency!

To thin.  I would expect this thin consistency from a canned soup but I was hoping for something better with this recipe.   I might try it again but halve the juice or something.

Cut butter and cream in half.  Use fat free half and half.  Chop tomatoes and de-seed, but don't bother peeling.  Could probably leave tomatoes in quarters.

I read other reviews and was so looking forward to this soup.  I have rated it a 3*, but was in two minds whether to rate it lower.  I followed the recipe exactly, firstly I did not like the salmon pink color of the soup, but more than ever it was the taste I didn't like.  I added so much salt and pepper, but the soup is still extremely bland, its very creamy.  Too creamy in fact with little to no taste.  I will not be making this soup again.

ooommmg! delicious. I am a VERY picky tomato soup eater but this was fabulous. I had trouble getting the butter to not float to the top and making it look greasy.  This is the kind of stuff you make for company.  This is a keeper!

So so good and so easy!  I too boiled the tomatoes until the skins split so they were easier to take off.  I also didn't exactly puree mine since my blender burned out, but I did use a mixer which meant that I still had chunks, but that was actually a good thing.  It felt heartier with the chunks.  This is now my new go-to tomato soup recipe.

It was ok. My spouse loved it. But, I thought that it tasted like pasta sauce. Maybe because tomatoes are not in season right now, or maybe the tomato juice was too much.

Very good basic soup recipe and surprisingly easy to make. I used Half and Half and less butter than the recipe called for, and it still tasted great. I like to serve mine with honey drizzled on the bottom of the bowl and grated parmesan on top. I think this soup was missing a little something, so the next time I make this, I will add some diced onions and let them simmer with the juice and diced tomatoes. I think they will provide the extra flavour that I'm looking for.

Eating this right now. Added a handful of boiled tortellini. Can't remember when I last had a more satisfying supper.   Didn't have enough basil so supplemented with dried basil.  Added chopped parsley at the end, as per other tomato soup recipe. Adds color and another layer of flavor as you bite into bits of parsley from time to time.   Butter a bit much, as was cream. Would ahve liked tomato flavor to shine through more. WIll reduce both next time. But this is great comfort food (with tortellini).

Next time I make it I would use less cream and use more basil. Not my favorite. Still will be heading to panera bread for my tomato soup.

I thought this was just ok. I didn't have enough heavy cream, so I used 3/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup milk. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My kids said it tasted like pizza sauce, but they ate it! I might try it again with some modifications to better fit our tastes.

I'm actually in love with this recipe! I can't think of enough good things to say about it. Although I know the submitter insisted not to substitute lower fat ingredients, being the rebel I am, I did it anyway. I used half and half and low sodium tomato juice. The results were outstanding, and I didn't miss the heavy whipping cream a bit! Enjoy...I'm going to say a prayer of thanks for finding this gem!

I made a double batch because I was clearing out the tomato garden for the season and stuck pretty close to the recipe.  The only problem is trying to figure out how much 4 tomatos really is. Some are saying romas which are so small compared to the monster brandywines I used.  Very tasty and a bowl will fill you up for the afternoon.  I sprinkled some parm on top of pieces of toasted sourdough french bread.  It was like dipping your grilled cheese.

I thought this soup was good, but "missing" something I couldn't quite put my finger on. As I was cooking it I felt it was rich enough, so I only put in half the butter, and substituted lactose free 2% milk for half the heavy cream. Very rich and delicious... definitely a soup for special occasions, but too rich for every day meals!

Oh dear. This must be eaten in teacup-size portions it's so rich! I'm quite pleased. Skimped just barely on the amounts of cream and butter, but it's still pleeeenty rich! I also had to add a maybe 2 Tbsp of sugar to balance the flavors. I was skeptical about not adding onions or garlic or something, but this soup is lovely in its simplicity. I'll make it again for sure. Thanks, Marbalet!

I was looking for a recipe to match the expensive stuff at a bakery that I go to. This was GREAT!! I did add a lot more basil and tomatoes than called for and I would even add more basil next time - but that's just a personal preference. Thank you for this yummy keeper recipe!

Excellent and quick if you don't peel and seed the tomatoes.  So many said it didn't make a difference - I've tried it both ways and it really doesn't make a difference.  If you "puree" the soup long enough it will be extremely creamy (no seeds/no skin). I make this every summer thanks to my friend Margherita from Staten Island who grows her own tomatoes, basil, eggplant, etc. Thanks submitter and Mags and PaPa for your wonderful garden!

I didn't have all the ingredients so used what I had in the pantry.  Used evaporated milk rather than whip cream, and clamato rather than tomato juice.  We still thought it was good.  Will try again using the correct ingredients.

I actually cheated and made it with plain yogurt. It wasn't as smooth, but the chunks were pleasant tasting. If you've ever had Mexican Queso Fresco, it was sort of like that. So if you want to be a little healthier, no it won't be as pretty, but still super yummy :-)

I was trying to clone the tomato basil soup that I get at lunch all the time from Nordstrom Cafe that is so amazing.  This is better.  It is alot of effort, but worth it.

I made this the "cheap" way with plain store brand tomatoe juice and dried Basil. It turned out good but I did have to add about 1 ts of sugar because the juice was kinda bitter. I bet if you made this with good tomatoe juice and fresh Basil, It would be out of this word. Next time I won't be so cheap but either way it was very good. I forgot, I also added a piece of mosseralla cheese to each bowl and it was awesome!

This soup was out of this world awesome. I used 10 roma tomatoes, cut the butter to 1/4 cup, and used half and half. I did use quite a bit more basil than called for because I really enjoy the flavor. This recipe is amazing. It is so easy to prepare and the flavor is excellent. I served this with club sandwiches. I highly recommend this recipe.

Best tomato soup ever.  Better even than most restaurants. Everyone loves it.  The only complaint I've had is that it is too rich.  If you have members of your family that have trouble with rich foods you might want to consider this as a side dish rather than main course.

This recipe is very yummy.  We make it about 1-2 times a month.  I modify the recipe a tad by only using about 1/4 of the butter and cream.  I tried using the suggested amounts and thought it was too heavy and rich.

Very nice!  Easy, vegetarian and yummy.  I used a can of tomatoes (drained) to be lazy and fat free half and half.  My basil was fresh from my garden so there was a lot of flavor.  A dollop of sour cream and a tiny basil leaf for a garnish and it looked like an all day soup in under 45 mins!

Easy and excellent recipe.  I added some sauteed shallots with a little butter and white wine.  Used 28oz canned tomatoes, and cut the butter to 3T and used fat free half 'n half.  Rich and delicious.  Doesn't need the extra fat, unless you just like it.  Yummy!

Made this tonight.  I sauteed some diced onion and minced garlic in a tablespoon of butter and then added 5 diced vine tomatoes, which I didn't bother peeling.  I subbed 2 cups tomato sauce and two cups chicken broth for the tomato juice since I never buy it.  Pureed/whipped half the soup with the basil in my Magic Bullet,  Pretty good soup, but definitely way too much cream.  I added half the amount called for, and it still took away from the tomato taste.  I'd also definitely at least double the basil in the future.  Will make again, with a few changes.

This soup was such a hit in my house.  I served it with a few butter and garlic croutons on top, and everyone loved it!

I made this for my boyfriend who LOVES tomato soup. Im not much of a fan of tomato ANYTHING so it was hard for me to judge this. He ate 2 bowls and said he loved it. I think the only thing I would change next time is less butter and cream. I did think the heavy cream somewhat overpowered the tomato taste. Thats just ME though. Everyone has there own preference. Great Recipe!

Thanks, this was fabulous. I did use half of the amount of cream and butter and was very happy. I did not peel the tomatoes(just seeded) and then used my immersion blender. Served with paninis- a bit hit with the whole family!

This is the best tomato soup ever! I added a lot more basil and a pinch of cayenne and it was to die for.

I didnt know soup could be so easy and tasty! Definately a soup that you would buy in a higher end restraunt. I didnt seed or peel the tomatoes. I added 2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic powder when doubling the recipe. Also used about 12 leaves of basil seeing they were pretty large leaves. Any more would have been overpowering. Made with classic grilled cheese sandwiches!!

This was the worst thing I've ever had in my life.  It used a lot of basil leaves and I had to keep adding heavy cream and butter thinking that would help the flavor, but it never did.  Sorry, but this didn't work for me.  Maybe I did something wrong...

OH MY - AN AWESOME RECIPE!! I recently made this soup and took it to a church function.  It was a hit, everyone wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was I used canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes as tomatoes were out of season.

This recipe is great for quick and easy soup, it is delicious, but I suggest starting with 1/2 cup of the cream and adding the other 1/2 cup as needed.  I thought the soup was too creamy with a full cup of cream.  I also add garlic powder and ground red pepper for flavor - delicious!

very good. Next time I will cut down on the butter and will not add any salt.  The tomato juice and canned tomatoes already had a lot of salt already.  I used homemade canned tomatoes too.

Couldn't imagine this with the butter so I left it out.  Glad I did.  I'm in a cooking circle for someone who is going through chemo and rich foods don't completely agree with her.  Kept it simple and the taste is clean and fresh.

This was FANTASTIC! Followed directions but added twice as much basil as suggested by others. My Husband had the nerve to ask me if I really made it. I fancy myself as a pretty good cook but I guess this was that good. Thanks for the recipe. I will definately make it again.

I thought this was delicious, but I am the only tomato soup lover in my family.  The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is that it needed a little more flavor.  I used 2 tbsp. freeze-dried basil instead of fresh and will add a little more next time along with some garlic powder as many other readers suggest.  Also - as a word of caution - putting the tomatoes in the blender hot will cause the lid to blow off!!  Maybe most people know this, I did not. My hand is burnt and the mess was not fun.

This soup had a great taste, but was a bit too creamy for my taste.  I reduced the butter and kept the cream the same.  Next time I plan to reduce the cream to allow more of the tomato flavor to shine through.

Canned tomatoes make a decent alternative if out of time.  I also used lots of garlic which makes it taste even better in my opinion.

It was just ok for me. I was hoping it would be thicker. It was creamy just not as thick as I would of liked it. A little less basil for me next time, kind of over powered everything. Still looking for that perfect recipe.

This was pretty good, but there was definitely something missing.  My kids normally love tomato soup, but they weren't too pleased with this.  It didn't have the tang or sweetness that we were expecting, maybe it would be better with some garlic and possibly something else, I just can't quite put my finger on what that something else might be though.  I probably won't make it again.

I am a huge fan of Panera Bread's tomato soup so I was looking for a similar recipe.  This is not exact, but very close.  It has the same creaminess to it and has a restaurant quality.  I did not peel my tomatoes and they blended up nicely.  I would recommend the seeding part.  This was a hit with my kids...served it with mozzerella sticks...a huge hit!

The prep time for this recipe was way off for me.  I made this on a week night because it sounded like it was be quick and easy.  Was I wrong.  I started at 5pm and finished at 7pm.  The peeling, seeding and dicing of the tomato took a very long time and was very tedious.  The taste was ok but not near what I expected.

Very good. I had a few tomatoes left over from the garden and didn't want them to go to waste so I gave this a try. My tomato hating husband even liked it. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a hand held imersion blender rather than transfering back and forth and that made it much easier.

We're never going back to the canned stuff. Restaurant quality soup, as written. A great way to use the basil growing in the backyard. Delicious with organic tomato juice.

Very good.  I didn't seed and peel before cooking, I put it into the blender after cooking 30 minutes and then though a strainer, then I put it back into the blender with the basil.  
I used more tomatoes than called for, becuase I had so many ripe ones in my garden.  I would guess that I used about 5 cups.  I was also short 1 cup of tomato juice, but it turned out great.

Excellent!  My husband loved canned tomato soup, until he tasted this.  Never will I get away making him Campbells for a quick lunch.  The kids even loved it.

First time I made soup, and was very impressed - has really inspired me to make other soups!  Thanks so much for this easy yummy receipe!  I just added a bit of sugar and salt, as I didn't have tomoato juice, I used half a jar of Tomato puree and filled the other half with water.  The soup was very thick which I loved, my Mother loved the soup too, but she thought it was too thick and added boiling water to her bowl.  I thought it was pretty much perfect.  Thanks soo much! :)

I really wanted to like this as written, but found it way too blah (thank goodness I added the two garlic cloves) Had to add WAY too much salt and pepper to it as I was eating... With that said, I will make it again by adding a little more garlic, roasted red pepper, and some onion and see if that perks up the taste for me. I have a Braun Hand Emulsion blender and was a bit disappointed that it didn't puree the basil, maybe that added to the disappointment, just seems too messy and time consuming to place in blender... I did cut my cream to 1/2 cup, put in 3 tbls butter, but probably ended up taking out 1 tbls when I started to wonder why it was in there...

My family loved this one.  I did added onion, green and red pepper to the blender.  Also, I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  When we finished the soup my son asked me to can this recipe so we can have it in the winter.  I will but leave out the 1/2 and 1/2.

Wonderful!  I use this recipe when I have ton's of tomatoes from the garden.  I freeze the tom and juice mixture for winter soup!  I wouldn't use anything but the heavy cream, as milk and half and half separates.  ( It doesn't taste bad, just looks wierd.)  
I add some sherry and whatever seasonings I have, to taste.  Great recipe!

The first time I made this recipe, I felt like it was missing something so I tried to add some things to it to see if it helped and it didn't. I was craving tomato soup today, so I decided to read reviews and see what others suggested. I noticed that many people suggested adding garlic and so I did and this time it was really good! Still felt like it was missing something but definitely better than last time. I will continue to make and see if adding different ingredients will make it even better.

Tasty! I broiled eight tomatoes for 20 minutes and charred the skin to peel off easily.  Used 1/2 V8 and 1/2 tomato juice.  Sautedd garlic and onions and put all in the blender..simmered 1/2 hour and then added only 1/4 cup butter and half & half. Pinch of sugar at the end and parmesean on top of each bowl.  DELISH!

Good bye Campbell's!  I raided my herb garden and, in addition to the 14 basil leaves, decided to put in a few sprigs of summer savory, some cinnamon basil, and some fresh oregano.  WOW.  This soup was vibrant, creamy and altogether AMAZING.  Served up with an Italian salad and some crusty bread it made a delectable summer dinner....I just have to run an extra mile in the morning....

I followed the recipe to the tee.  It was good, but it lacked in tomato flavor.  Next time I will try sauteing the tomatoes in olive oil first, or maybe adding some sundried tomatoes.

This recipe was good but I think it was a little bit too tomato tasting for it being "rich and Creamy". Overall everything else was great, especially the texture. Probably won't make again, but only because I have a better recipe.

This recipe was great in a loose type of way, meaning it was basic but needed some tweaking. (I used home-canned tomatoes.) However, after finishing the recipe as given, it lacked flavor.  For a creamier taste and to keep the soup from thinning, I added nonfat dry milk, between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup. I also added about 1/2 cup sugar to reduce the tartness.
Hopefully my findings help someone!! :)
**Forgot to add in my other review...I also added a can of tomato paste for more flavor...it really helped!!!

You mean tomato soup comes any other way than out of a red and white can?  Much tastier - and I'm sure healthier, version of good ol' tomato soup.  It was very good and just perfect for dipping our grilled cheeses into.  The only change that I will make in the future is to try to reduce the salt.  I didn't add very much and it did seem a bit sodium-y.  Easy fix with reduced sodium tomato juice next time.  All in all, very good.

I think this was really very good. There was only a sight too much of the "tomato juice" taste; perhaps it was the saltyness. Other than that this was very good and very easy. I'll definately make it again.

One review said you could leave seeds in tomoto and leave on skin...I think seeding is a MUST!  My boyfriend loved it...as did I.

I loved it, but my husband just thought it was okay. The only reason why my husband didn't like it was because he thought it was too acidic. I would have to agree with him, but overall I think it's a keeper in our recipe book. I think next time I make it I will cook the tomatoes a bit longer. I think 20 minutes is too short for fresh tomatoes. Also, by adding a bit of sugar, that really helped cut down on the acidic taste. I also sauteed a little bit of garlic and finely chopped onion before adding in the tomatoes and tomato juice. 

Overall, I think this is a great recipe and I will be making it again.

This was perfect, tomato basil is one of my favorites soups, very nice flavor. My daughter and my mother were fighting over who was taking home the left overs. I just started my first tomato garden. Now I can't wait for my first crop.

I was so disappointed after reading the rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with pink soup, not resembling tomato at all.  I had to add a can of tomato paste, which thickened it up and made it more "tomatoey."  I don't think "4 tomatoes" is enough.  Maybe 4 cups.  I'm still searching for an awesome tomatoe soup.

I used this as a base for my own creation. I used: 1 28oz can crushed tomatoes, 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 c. cream,1 T. sugar, & 1 t. dried basil. (yeah, I'm lazy) Guess what? It was pretty darn good. I'm making it again this weekend....but it will be better since I went to Central Market & bought seedless tomato puree'!!! (the seeds were my only gripe...& being lazy, didn't feel like straining the canned crushed tomatoes!)

An easy recipe to follow and a delecious soup!  The cream definitely makes this soup.  If one wanted to watch their wasteline, I think that you can omit the butter.  This soup did not last long as my husband went back for thirds.  This soup will be a staple in our family.

I used this recipe as a base to a slightly different type of soup i was making. I used fresh rosemary rather than basil, but followed the recipe otherwise. It had a bit too much cream so I added more tomato juice and I dont know how much of a difference the butter made, next time i'll probably leave it out. This is a good base, and very easy to tweak, thank you for posting it!

A mixed reaction to this here. My dad and youngest daughter who are tomato soup lovers said this was a definite 5. Me, hubby and my other daughter thought it was a 4. I went with the recipe as is but next time I make it I would definitely reduce the butter by half. Thanks.

we made this on Christmas Eve as a precursor to cajun stuff peppers and our parents loved it.  i used low sodium tomato juice to lower sodium content a little.  i also followed another reviewers suggestion and didn't spend the time to peel or seed the tomates.  we topped it with grated parmasaen cheese to counter the pungency that tomatoes can get.

I told my boyfriend that we were having grilled cheese and tomato soup for dinner and he told me he would find something else, that he had never had any homemade tomato soup he liked, just "Campbells".  Well, he had two servings!  It was so yummy!  The two kids liked it too!  I was lazy, so I just cup up the tomatoes - no peeling or seeding and it was still wonderful!  Thanks for this recipe!

Easy and delicious! I added a little bit of minced garlic and onion. Otherwise I followed it exactly.  It also makes a great base for a creamy tomato sauce. I took my leftover cream, butter, tomatoes, etc. and added bell peppers and mushrooms. It was great over penne!

Holly, I apologize now for how I changed your recipe - but the base recipe is in what I did!  I forgot my grocery list at home so I just ad-libbed.  I intended to double your recipe... and I ended up using about l.5 lbs. of roma tomatoes, 2 (ll oz.) cans tomato juice, 2 (l4.5 oz) jars of DelMonte Garden Select diced tomatoes with basil/garlic/oregano, and l (l4oz) Red Gold diced tomatoes.  (along with 28 leaves of fresh basil, 2 cups whipping cream and 1/2 cup butter.)  I didn't peel the tomatoes until after they simmered about 40 minutes.  At this time I pureed everything and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Oh my - this was SO good.  When I served this tonight, I shredded smoky motzerella cheese on top.  I served this with the hot ham and cheese sandwiches (also on Allrecipes.com.)  This is an awesome soup!

This soup was okay, but was NOT anything great. It was a little too tangy for my taste.

I put in twice the amount of basil called for and it still wasn't enough.  Also, I added orzo pasta to make it a little more hearty, and that was good.

My family liked this okay, but I don't think I'll make it again.

It's amazing how such simple ingredients, can create such a decadent soup!  I doubled the recipe and used fresh tomatoes from my garden.  I didn't bother peeling the tomatoes and just squeezed as much pulp out of the tomatoes as I could.  My 9 yr old who doesn't even like tomatoes, loves this soup.  Now I have leftovers to eat for lunch this week!

This recipe is amazing, healthy and easy to make! Thanks for sharing it. I fell in love with Tomato Basil soup at a resturaunt when I lived in Dallas. Since moving, the closest resturant (same as one in Dallas) with my "favorite" recipe is in DC. They sell the soup to go, and I would always buy 2-3 quarts of it when I was up there. Well, this recipe even beats that one, and I can make it myself. No more waiting until I was out of town for this! Fantastic!

Incredibly easy and incredibly good! One of my favorite soups I make now and very easy. I use some grape tomatos for extra tangy flavor. Big hit with the husband too.

I thought this soup was very tasty- Instead of using fresh tomatoes, bc I am not that experienced with them, I bought  a large can of the diced "fire roasted" tomatoes and then strained the leftover pulp after processing everything together.  I also left the basil leaves until the end bc I forgot them- and threw them in while the soup was simmering.  After tasting- I removed them bc they became a little overpowering. I really can't believe how easy it was to make this great soup!

My first time making soup and I loved it.  I forgot to puree the tomatos but I then enjoyed biting into the tomato pieces so all was good.  Used only just over 1/2 the cream as suggested by some other reviewers.  Added some bits of fresh salmon.  Delicious.

I love this recipe. I have made tomato basil soup in the past but none have turned out as good as this less complicated version. My family and friends love it. They beg me to make it at whatever get together we are having. I do like to leave the peel on the tomato for a little texture. But otherwise i think this is fantastic!

In the dead of winter with only mushy tasteless tomatoes around, decided to substitute with canned as many other reviewers suggested.  Also used dried basil as I did not have fresh on hand and a spoonful of sugar. Even with the warning to not substitute, this soup was divine.  Would probably taste good with homemade garlic herb croutons. Will try that next time.

I made a soup similar to this when I was a cook in a coffee shop on Maui a few years ago. What I did differently was to add some quartered canned artichoke hearts & topped each bowl with fresh shredded parmesan cheese. Try it sometime, its wonderful this way!

This is wonderful.  I used two large cans of peeled whole tomatoes because fresh werern't in season now, and added just a pinch of sugar and a health glug of dry sherry. This was better than the 4 star restaurant's soup we had the evening before, which I liked so much that I had to compare to this recipe.  Wonderful job Holly!!

This is amazing.  It tastes just like the soup I used to get at a local restaurant.  I made it using the diced canned tomatoes and I only used 10 basil leaves.  I added a little bit of sugar and some hot sauce at the end.  I will definitely make this again because it's so easy and so good.

my friends & I loooved the recipes. my variation was to substitute 4 tomatoes & 4 cups tomato juice with 2 28oz cans of diced tomatoes, using simply the juice from the cans. (tomatoes are expensive in the winter!) I had pureed only half the tomatoes and added 1 1/2 cups minute rice and about 2 cups of roughly chopped baby portobello mushrooms. I  cooked this for another 5 minutes and then added the cream and butter. I ended up with a rather chunky light colored soup. I had then served it with slices of a baguette. I thought I was best with bread. yumita!

WOW! Incredible. Devine. Decadent, calorically speaking.  Very easy to make.  I used canned whole tomatoes, since it is January and there are no good fresh tomatoes around here this time of year, and the soup was still fabulous.  Will I make this again?  Probably not because of the 45.6 fat grams per serving,(and I had at least two servings), but it sure was good!

Awesome.  I made this for some friends and they all loved it!  They said it was better than any they've had!  I also didn't puree all of the mixture--it made it a bit chunky and very good!!  The more basil, the better!  Served it with breadsticks and salad!

The taste was great.  I just thought it was a bit too soupy.  Next time, I'll use more tomatoes and less juice.  I think it will be perfect.

Oh my goodness!  This was wonderful.  I was a little afraid to put in all the basil leaves as I wasn't sure how powerful the taste would be.  I put in 10 rather than 14 and it was great.  Thanks for sharing.  I will definitely make it again and again!!

Great recipe!  I think that with the addition of garlic and more spices - this could turn into an amazing receipe for tomato basil soup.  It had great flavor, but I added diced shallots, garlic, and more basil than called for.  I will make this again for sure - cannot wait to use fresh tomatoes and basil from by garden!  Thanks for the super recipe!

This was very good but REALLY salty.  If you can find low-salt tomato juice, I would recommend using that and let people salt it as they want.  To cut on calories, I used no-fat half-and-half, which was o.k. but the soup wasn't as thick as it could have been.  Next time, I will not worry about the diet and use the real thing.  Also, I only used 1/4 cup of butter to cut down on the richness.  I did not pureé all of the tomatoes so there would be some chunks.  Excellent soup, Holly!

Wow.  I modified this recipe a lot to accomodate the ingredients I had on hand.  But if you like tomato soup, this recipe is so much better than Campbell's.  The essential ingredients are puree'd tomatoes, a dairy product with fat (skim milk doesn't work too well) and Italian seasonings.  I have made this three times, using what I had, and it's tasted great every time.

I don't like tomato soup- used this recipe for my husband.  This was so good!  I loved it.  It is not at all bitter like most versions of this soup that I have tried.  I can't wait to make it again.  It is a bit time consuming with peeling and seeding the tomatos but it is so worth it!  Thanks for sharing!

Very much like my Maman's recipe.  It's so simple and tasty.  You can add rice to it for substance. :)

Wow!  Just what the name says!  This was sooo good!  The basil is wonderful.  My first batch had a bit of a bite to me, though my husband thought it was fine the way it was.  In-season tomatoes or the kind of tomato juice might make the difference but a pinch of sugar remedied the "problem" for me!  Thanks Holly.  I will always feel I am serving an elegant, gourmet soup with this one!

This is the best cream of tomato soup I've made!  I thought I would miss onions in the soup, but it's great just like it is and it's so easy to make.  Thanks Holly!

This was a very rich flavorful soup.  I added onions and artichoke hearts for extra flavor.  Shared with neighbors and family and they loved it!!!

delicious soup -- didn't alter anything.  could NOT believe that my 3yr old ate it and liked it.  i was completely amazed.  the only thing i felt bad about was no leftovers.  the next day i wanted to look in the fridge and see a gallon more.  :(

This is truly a wonderful recipe.  We had it with homemade country white bread and it was great!  Definately not on the diet, but worth it.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.
