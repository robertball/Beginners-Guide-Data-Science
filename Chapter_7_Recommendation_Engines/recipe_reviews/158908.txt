my mother ( 85 y.o. ) learned to make this amazing treat from her best friends mother.   Absolutely one of THE best desserts I ever had.  All my friends would amazingly show up when they heard she had baked one hoping for just a sliver of this peice of heaven

I have heard so many good things about this pie. One is always made for our family functions but I have never been able to sample it because it goes so quickly. I just made it and oh my gosh! It is so good!! Thank you for the recipe :-)
