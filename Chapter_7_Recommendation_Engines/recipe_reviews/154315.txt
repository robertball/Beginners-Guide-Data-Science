This is wonderful. I used to get these by the dozen frozen from a Middle Eastern grocery. I do not live in the same area anymore so I had to try to make them myself. I was unable to make the dough as thin as the ones I used to buy, they were almost like a cracker, but the flavors were all there. I have very little experience with yeast breads but this is easy to make. They freeze very well.

This was a delicious dish, but only after I made it on pitta bread. The first night I made it using homemade pizza dough; I don't recommend this b/c by the time the crust was done cooking (on a baking stone, no less), the topping was too dried out. I wasn't very happy! Thankfully, I had leftover topping, so the next day I made it on shop bought pitta bread. I also spread the topping on a bit more generously. The result was tasty and fabulous! Recommended. Note that I did not use fenugreek, feta or lime. I did add more chopped fresh mint and actually added it to the topping while cooking.

This is a winner for our family!  Ground lamb goes on clearance regularly at our local grocery store and I usually have all the other ingredients on hand.  

We used Naan instead of pitas and herb goat cheese instead of feta because that's what was in the fridge and it was SO GOOD.

Made these tonight for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed them! I was able to buy fenugreek seeds at the local Indian market ("methi seeds"). We bought fresh made plain and garlic nann and used those in place of pita bread. It crisped well during cooking and was really tasty!
My feta cheese did not melt during cooking. If I make this again I would take the cheese out of the fridge earlier and let it warm up some.
Don't be afraid to be liberal with the lime juice - it really adds a nice kick at the end.

I have made this a few times.  It's so rich in flavor, it's one of our favorites!  I have never used fenugreek seeds because I've never been able to get them, but the recipe has so much to compensate.  I always use the feta and mint, though it suggests it's optional.  Lamb is very fatty meat, so I do drain the fat part way through cooking before adding the tomatoes.
