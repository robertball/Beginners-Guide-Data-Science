I use 3 eggs and 1 1/2 cups half and half or other cream for this.  That allows room for 2 to 3 cups add-ins.  the 4 eggs and 2 cups doesn't allow for enough add-ins without overflowing your pie crust.

I made this for our Christmas brunch this year.  Boy did I get a lot of compliments! I made it a few weeks before as a trial run and decided that I needed to make some changes.  First change, I baked the DEEP PIE SHELL in the oven (unfilled) at around 325 or 350 for 10-15 minutes.  Second, I reduced the half-and half to 1 1/2 cups and increased the eggs to 5.  We found the quiche to be too custardy during our trial run.  Third, we shredded around 8 oz of gruyere cheese. We didn't use it all, but mixed the amount that we wanted with the eggs.  That way the bottom of the crust doesn't get too mushy.  We placed ham on the top of the quiche and cooked it. (It will displace during cooking.) As far as the cooking temp and time, fool around with it. Drop the temp and prepare to cook longer.  I say drop the temp b/c you don't want your pie shell to get too dark around the edges. I would say that it probably took us somewhere around 1 hr in cooking time. Final result - everyone was asking for the recipe!

This is a great, basic, can't-mess-up-no-matter-what quiche recipe.  I substituted evaporated skim milk for the half & half, with no problems.  I also added carmelized onions, 1/2 C. of shredded smoked gouda cheese and 4 slices of crumbled bacon.  Highly recommended!

This recipe was very easy and the results very nice.  I used prepared pie crusts and half milk for the filling and the results still came out very custardy with a soft, toothsome texture.  In combination with the fillings I added (diced ham, onion, broccoli, mushroom), the egg/milk mixture was enough to fill up 2 quiches.  My husband and kids loved this; we ate both entire quiches for dinner.  Only suggestion was that the quiche needs cooking a little longer than directed: after the 25 minutes at 350, they were still gelatinous and not set.  I turned up the heat to 375 and cooked for 20 minutes more and they came out lovely, fragrant and savory.  Can't wait to try this recipe again with other fillings.

Fantastic! Only mod. I made was an extra egg and I used 1/2 the cream and 1/2 1% milk.
Also I par cooked my pie cruse for 5 min @ 400 degrees to crisp up the crust a bit. Cooked quiche for 45- 1 hour as well.
This was so nice with a lite salad and a glass of Sav. Blanc!

Very simple and very good.  I did use all mozzerella cheese rather than the speciality cheese.  It got raves from my family and friends.

This is my FIRST time making quiche and it turned out beautifully. I was out of nutmeg so just did without it and it was still great. I made the recipe as stated otherwise, with added toppings of 4 pieces of crumbled bacon, handful of mushrooms, and a full package of baby spinach, wilted first in a skillet.  Instead of a pie plate, I put a prepared pie crust into a springform pan and pressed it up the sides to make it somewhat of a deep-dish presentation. Though it was not as deep as some that I have had in cafes and such, it made for a very pretty plate. I will plan to do this again to serve this dish to guests.  I highly recommend this quiche as it was easy to make and tasted quite delicious. Very smooth and rich without being too heavy.  
Edited to add:
I made this again with spinach, bacon, and caramelized onions, and with the nutmeg, and made my own crust using the "easy pie crust" recipe from this site with whole wheat flour.  Easily the best quiche I have ever eaten, including the one I order at our local fancy french cuisine place for brunch.  The caramelized onions are a fantastic addition, and the wheat crust added something to the flavor that really set off the rest. Fantastic!

Awesome recipe! I have never made quiche before and I'm very pleased that this is the first recipe I tried. I pre-baked the crust for about 8 minutes, as suggested by someone, and I also cut the 1/2 & 1/2 down to 1.5 cups and added an extra egg, since I like a less-custardy consistancy. For add-ins I used some shredded swiss, crumbled bacon, 1/2 package frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed VERY dry, and a small amount of carmelized onions. Amazing!!

The was the first quiche dish I have made, but, I think there must be a better one out there.  Too much cream, and I cut it to 1 1/2 cup.  Needs to be cooked longer . . I'll try another one next time.

After searching a ton of quiche recipes and not finding quite what I wanted, I gave up and searched for "basic quiche" and ended up with exactly what I was looking for. This is better than basic, it melds perfectly with any mix of ingredients you throw in. I used swiss cheese, zucchini, chicken and sun-dried tomatoes last night. Excellent.

I used the basic recipe for proportions which is exactly what I was looking for! I used what I had as add ins. Pepper jack cheese layered on the bottom of the crust (I also precooked the crust for about 10 min) then sliced tomatoes on top, then chopped up deli turkey. I had some fresh spinach which i sauteed with garlic and shallots and added that on top of the turkey. I poured the egg mixture on top and didn't use it all because it was starting to sneak out the edge :) It definitely needed extra time to cook but it also is important to let it firm up again after it's done. I let it sit out about 10 or 15 minutes and it was perfect! Such a great way to use leftovers :)

good recipe, but I find using about 4 oz of cheddar and 2-3 oz of parmesan (to personal taste) works best. the cheddar really helps to bring out the richness of the eggs.  you may want to increase the amount of salt to almost half a tablespoon (I use kosher and found the listed amount far too small).  also, blind baking your crust at 450 is a good idea (freeze first to really get a good crust).  I have had best results baking filled quiche for about 35-40 min (depending on the amount of veg I put in).

Excellent basic quiche recipe! I used 3/4c cream and 3/4c 2% milk to cut down on the fat/calories. I stuck with the 4 eggs and the consistency was perfect. For the fillings I added shredded mozzarella, fresh basil, sun dried tomatoes and green onions. It was divine! Anything would work - that's the beauty of this recipe. Thanks for posting!

Followed recipe without variation. Wish I would have paid attention to others who said 'too much cream, not enough eggs' because even after cooking it extra time, it was still runny and undone appearing, and not very appetizing to my family. Perhaps reheating it might make it better. There is lots left over.  I will stick to using Swiss Cheese and Onion Quiche.

There is way to much half & half and not enough egg in this basic recipe, I reduced the half &half to 1 1/2 cup and used 5 eggs. I like meat in my quiche but can't count off for it since this a recipe for BASIC QUICHE, it's an awesome example for a person new to making quiche. You can personalize this to suite lots of different taste.
I personally like to use Kraft 3 cheese blend (1 cup) and 1/2 cup cubed ham.

Great base recipe! I used this base to make mini quiches using the Cream Cheese Tart Shells from this site for crust. I modifed the filling and instead used swiss cheese, ham, and chives, a tiny pinch in each shell and then topped with Shelley's egg filling. They were a hit at the baby shower! :)

Good quiche but a little bit too much custardy taste. I made mine with a 3 cheese mix and also a cup of chopped ham. I think next time I will reduce the half and half to 1 1/2 cups and add 5 eggs instead of 4. I will also reduce the temp and cook it a little bit longer.

I love this recipe and it has become a regular meal in our home.   After reading the other reviews I cut the half and half amount so I can add in extra goodies.

Amazing! Used the suggestions with the bacon, onion and gouda! WOW! The only thing I did different was use 1cup 1/2 and 1/2 and 1cup 2% milk!

I always like to try recipes as written and then tweak it according to feedback. This was the BEST quiche recipe I've ever tried and I'm "known for my quiche." However, it's not terribly slimming, which is a problem, because it's so delicious, I always end up eating more than I should!

I find this is a PERFECT basic for all my quiches.  I omit and change the herbs/spices and cheese accordingly.  Take note of the picture, this is done NOT in a pie plate, but a quiche pan.  The recipe as is...added with my ingredients of choice, fits perfectly in any of my 3 quiche pans.

Tonight I used this adding sausage, cheddar cheese, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and a little cayenne pepper.  Topped with left over chili and jalapenos.  I have used this recipe for quiches made with just veggies, ham, burger etc.  Again, just change the spices and cheeses accordingly.

Too much cream. I did a cup and a half and it was still too gooey. I prefer thicker quiche.

great flavor!  i used this recipe with the mini cream cheese tart shells.  I had to use black pepper instead because i didn't have any white and i used a colby jack shredded cheese mix. I also added crumbled bacon.  these were a big hit at my last holiday party!

Unbelievable.  This quiche makes people think I can cook.  I had a vegetarian and meat eaters enjoy this.  I8 cooked up bacon and steamed asparagus and people  added it to the quiche at the table.

Very good and easy to make. Husband liked it so much that he attempted to eat a slice he dropped on the floor. We have two dogs though, so unfortunately, that piece was retired to the garbage. I did add an egg and reduced half and half by a 1/2 cup as suggested - still managed to overflow the pie crust.

I am a relatively new cook and found this recipe very easy.  I was delighted to find that it tastes like quiche that I have bought from the local bakery and in restaraunts as well.  It is very easy to add different ingredients and customize to your likeing.

Honestly, this recipe should get more stars. I used to get a quiche from a cafe down the street that closed its doors. I had been in withdrawal until finding this recipe, which is honestly even a little better. Thank you so much!

Very tasty.  I used shredded Mexican cheese blend and scallions and it was delicious b/c it was all I had.  I used a few previous suggestions: precooked the pie crust; reduced the half and half to about 3/4 cup; added one egg.  It still created a bit too much filling for the 9" pie crust, but reducing the liquid is a must!

I used this recipe as a base for 3 different quiches at a recent party I had and got rave reviews.  I used bacon and jarlsberg, ham and gruyere and broccoli cheddar.  The amount was perfect for a frozen deep dish pie shell with the add-ins, you just need to cook a little longer.

This is a good recipe and easy to make.  It went over well with guests.  I added broccoli, ham, 
red and orange peppers.  If you put other ingredients in then you only need half the filling 
(thank you other review).
A nice tasty dinner!

This is a good starter recipe but it calls for way too much cream.  And the baking time is WAY off.  You must cook it for more like 45 or 50 min and reduce the cream by about 1/4 to 1/2.  Add fresh basil, spinach, roasted red peppers, and use fresh mozzarella and parmesan instead of the cheese that is called for.  Sprinkle a little parmesan cheese over it just at the end of cooking.

Great non-traditional way to start your day! Quick, easy and filling. Mix ingrediants, pop in oven, get ready for day, take out quiche and boom! Add chopped peppers, mushrooms or sausage bits for zest!

best, creamiest quiche ever.  In fact making this quiche made me wonder if it's possible to make a sweet quiche, like a vanilla bacon maple quiche with a bruleed top.  or a quiche with a bit of pumpkin and maple mixed in.  It is so good.

I have made this lots of times.  It is a favorite in my family and I use different add-ins each time depending on what I have on hand.  The kids love it.  It also reheats well so we enjoy having one cooked and on hand for those rush dinners during the week.

Great basis for easy Quiche!  This was my 1st attempt, I made it for Christmas Brunch for my husbands family.  I opted for Cheddar instead of Jarlsburg and added 1 frozen spinach, drained and dried and diced roasted red pepper for the the green/red look.  SUPER tasty!!  I'm making it again for a party next weekend!!

This was a great base recipe. I omitted the cheese called for in the recipe and made my own variations. Cheddar and bacon is nice. Sauted onion and julienned zuchini with goat cheese was amazing.

Best quiche recipe I have found! I only used 2 eggs and a cup of 5% cream - had a fair bit of "filling" - but it turned out great, nice and light and fluffy - not overdone or too dense.

2 cups of half and half seemed like a lot compared to other quiches I've made, so I cut it back to 1 cup. I also added 2 cups of sauteed spinach and 1/4 bacon bits. Baking times and temps were perfect for the changes and additions. Turned out delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

YUMMY!! Made this for mother's day brunch and it was super duper hit, and it was my first time baking a quiche! I didn't change a thing, except for adding fresh, chopped, wilted spinach.  I cannot wait to make it again soon.

I made this recipe for a brunch that I had for both my daughter-in-laws bridal shower and again for my own daughters baby shower. Everyone loved it! It was an easy recipe to follow and I made it again, today for my husband and he loved it!  Thanks!! I would give this recipe 5 stars (The Best)for sure and will pass it on to my friends and relatives!!! I also added carmelized onions, spinach and cooked bacon to this recipe. YUMMO!

I followed the suggestion of using 3 eggs and a cup and a half of cream to create more room for veggies and I think that worked very well.  Next time I may increase the egg to cream ratio as I found it a little soft for my taste.  The cook time worked perfectly for me.

I have made this recipe twice now and have had RAVE reviews both times. I added one more egg and used a mixture of Mozz/Provolone cheese. The flavor is incredible by itself or some I added crumbled bacon, cilantro and chopped tomato. Delicious! I used mini tart pans and made individual quiches. Great for a brunch or party! This recipe is a keeper!

Made mini quiches using this recipe together with Glenda's cream cheese tart shells. The only thing I added to the basic mix was chopped anchovies on top of the cheese as Him Indoors has an unhealthy passion for them. The end result was stunningly savoury, fluffy and all-round delicious. Thank you.

This is an excellent basic quiche recipe and not hard at all.  I used a store bought pie crust and added sauteed onions, spinach and ham and it was wonderful.

It was very easy and worked well with the mushrooms I added.  Only problem was that with the mushrooms it overflowed.  I think I could probably get two 8 inch quiches from this recipe with add-ins.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's a great starting off point but I made so many changes I don't even know if its even the same recipe.

First off I used a tube of crescent rolls for the crust.  I used a deep dish pie pan and stretched and squashed the whole sheet around until it sort of resembled a pie crust, up the sides of the pie dish.  Poked some  holes in it, baked it at 425 for about 15 minutes.  Had to keep checking on it and popping the puffed parts up so it would lie flat.  I sauteed baby spinach and portabella mushrooms with a half teaspoon of minced garlic in olive oil until the garlic was soft and the spinach wilted - enough to look like it would cover the bottom of the crust.  When the crust was done, I used 3 different shredded cheeses, just a thin layer of each, on the bottom of the crust, followed by the mushroom/spinach/garlic layer then added diced ham over that.  I added the egg layer using 5 eggs and 1 cup of skim milk, along with the white pepper, garlic salt, omitting the nutmeg.  Wisked it all together and poured it over what was in the crust already - I probably had 1/3 to 1/4 cup of the egg mixture left.  I added a handful of chives, about a half teaspoon of basil and a little onion powder on the top and threw it in the oven. It took almost 50 minutes until the  middle got to where it was set enough that I could take it out of oven using the baking times and temps as above.  Now it is cooling/setting; smells great and I can't wait to taste it. 1st quiche I ever made...

I would not call myself a picky eater, but I didn't care for this recipe because it was way too custardy.  I cut down on the cream by 1/2 a cup and added an egg, but it was still off.  All 5 people that tried this agreed.  I will not make this again.

Wow! I was very impressed with this simple but tasty quiche. I agree that there is just a bit too much cream, in the future I will reduce it. I also found that I needed to cook it for about 10 or 15 more minutes for it to be cooked. The consistency is a bit less solid than I would like, but I am assuming that is because of the amount of cream. I was DELIGHTED with the taste and the simplicity. I will definitely be making this again.

I really wanted to like this recipe more than I did. I think that there is too much nutmeg, it is a spice I rarely use, so maybe I am just over sensitive to the flavor. I also had to bake it a little longer. I turned the oven up to 175 degrees and baked for an additional 10 minutes. With that modification the consistency turned out good. I added  red bell pepper, onion, broccoli ,and ham to the dish and it still came out bland (except for the nutmeg)

Used Gruyere cheese for this along with the following filling: Sauteed a 6 oz bag of spinach, and removed water by pressing between a couple of paper towels, chopped and sauteed crimini mushrooms with 1 clove of garlic and added the chopped spinach back into the mix with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Was a big it a brunch :-)

Loved this! My family's favorite add-ins are spinach (frozen, thawed and drained of excess water), asparagus and bacon (my kids ate asparagus!), chopped and cooked broccoli, and ham. You can add anything to this great, basic quiche. It has turned out great for me every time.

I think this is one of those tried and true recipes and my review is not a commentary on Shelly's original recipe...but a warning to others. I only make quiche around once a year and I do hate a soggy crust so I thought pre-baking the shell was probably a good idea. So, I put my ready-made pie crust in a 325 degree oven as recommended. When I went to check on my crust 10 minutes later, it wasn't golden. In fact the sides had collapsed and curled up so I no longer had any sides! Then I checked the pie crust box directions and it directed a 450 degree oven for an unbaked shell (and yes I did prick the bottom and sides). So, if you try the pre-baking, be sure to use a hot enough oven. You can decrease the temp later for actually baking the quiche.I didn't have time to put a pie crust together from scratch so I just used the defective shell I had created and it is baking in the oven right now. I'm guessing I'll end up with a soggy crust after all as there were no sides to contain the egg batter, but hopefully it will taste good anyhow :) I would definitely try the recipe again just with a hotter oven for the prebake.

great basic quiche recipe, although I'm not sure how one could fit the entire quiche filling into one 9" pie crust. I had plenty of mixture for two 9" pie crusts... &the only mod I made was the addition of some crumbled bacon, which took up next to no room.

I thought this was great. Although I did alter the recipe. I left out the nutmeg, replaced white pepper with black pepper (left these out just b/c I didn't have them) and I added hot Italian sausage and some cherry tomatoes.

I am forever using recipes as a "guide" and changing things to please my family. I doubled the recipe for two quiche.  I also used smoked cheddar and mozzarella I also sauteed  onion and added crumbled bacon- a much heartier dish for dinner.  I read one reviewer thought there was too much half and half but I did not have a problem there.. I did however add an additional egg. Also, I found that I had to cook for additional 10 minutes-could have been my oven or the fact that I was cooking two at a time.  I did have to cover the crust about halfway through.  My gas oven seems to cook too hot.

This is a tasty, creamy basic recipe.  Easy to vary depending on one's taste.  I used spinach and feta in place of the jarlsburg.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful! Planning my menu for Easter Sunday brunch, so I tested this out this morning. Will with no doubt be on the menu!  I added crisp bacon, caramelized onions, mozzarella & cheddar cheeses and fresh parsley.
Used a homemade crust (9") (pre-bake for approximately 10 minutes at 450) before adding filling). Followed baking instructions from original recipe, set up very nice and color was beautiful.

This was a delicious recipe and is very versatile.  I omitted the nutmeg because I don't care for it, but it was still full of flavor.  I used cheddar, mozzerella, bacon, and chopped onions. I also used it to make mini-quiches using the Cream Cheese Tart recipe, as recommended by another user.  They were very good!

Wonderful and rich! I added mushroom and spinach and made mini-quiches with the Cream Cheese Tart Shells recipe on this site. They were delicious, professional and super simple!

This was the best quiche I have ever had! And it was really easy to make, too.
I have fun each time I make it adding different fillings: red & green peppers with ham is the favorite so far!
Nice, nutty flavor with the Jarlsberg, too!

I replaced the cream with sour cream. I like mine to be a bit firm. Added onion powder and asparagus... This may seem like I changed a lot, but this recipe was still the foundation of my quiche and it turned out great!

It was nice! I baked the crust alone in the oven at 425 degrees F (after I coated it thinly with butter) while I mixed the eggs and cheese ingredients, then I took out the crust, added the ingredients and followed the instructions as listed. Very light, fluffy, buttery and successful.

I've used this recipe as my "starter" four times now, and the results have been uniformly wonderful. Like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of cream to offset the other ingredients I added (if you don't, your cup really WILL run over), with no appreciable loss of flavor or consistency. One thing I did do that wasn't in the instruction was to whisk the eggs thoroughly before adding the cream, and then do it again, after adding it. It made the filling amazingly light when it set.

This recipe really is a keeper. Thanks to Shelly for sharing it.

I made this quiche using 4 lg. eggs, 1 can evaporated milk, sauted red onion-chopped, H.F. Turkey Sausage-thinly sliced, Mozzerella and Cheddar Cheese. I pre-baked the crust-cooled, put cheese in the crust, poured egg mix, topped with sauted onion and meat. Yum. Even the grandkids ate it all up.

Fantastic recipe.  A few tweaks though-- lose half a cup of the cream, and add an extra egg, or it's a bit too light.  I throw in a little chopped ham and some sauteed onions too to jazz it up a bit.

I have found that if I up the dairy to 3 cups and the eggs to 6 I can just fill 2 9-inch shells with some filling as well... My 6 year old loves the chopped up deli chicken, onion and cheddar version I make.

I added one egg and cut the half&half to 1 and 1/2 cups. This is a great basic quiche to add whatever filling you like. I made mine with spinach and bacon. It's kind of a pain if you use frozen spinach because you have to REALLY dry it out. I don't think I would use frozen spinach again. I also added some crushed red pepper. Cooked for 45-60 min after initial cooking of the crusts.

I made this recipe exact per the instructions.  It is a very basic and plain quiche for those looking for something along those lines.  Doing it again I may use different spices other then the nutmeg and add vegtables for something more.  Overall it is a nice recipe and can be modified as read by the many comments.

I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and, after tripling the recipe, added a couple extra eggs and kept the half-and-half to 4 cups.  By tripling the recipe, I had enough royale to make 4 quiches, and though it seemed very heavy on the cream, it set very nicely and tasted delicious.  I used various toppings, including steamed spinach, onions, mushrooms, ham, green onions, and tomatoes.  Everyone enjoyed it.

I made this for my family the weekend before Christmas.  I modified the recipe just a little bit as Natalie (review dated 1/05) suggested. I doubled the batch (plus 1 egg) and added the meet and cheese to the quiche after dividing it between two deep dish pie shells.  I made one bacon & cheese and one ham & cheese! They were PERFECT and so YUMMY! We even broke the left overs out for lunch that day! This was my second attempt at making quiche and this recipe will remain a family favorite. I'm already thinking of making it again! Thanks for sharing Shelly!

This quiche was delicious!!  I've never made quiche before and have to admit I was pretty impressed with myself.  It was so easy to make.  I didn't have Jarlsberg cheese, so I substituted sharp cheddar.  I added green onions and bacon and will definitely make this again.

I made this as directed the first time and while it was soft-set, it was delish! I made it again and added another egg, and it was still amazing, just a tad more firm. If you’re looking to cut a few calories, use half cream and half milk. It’s amazing with caramelized onions!

I give this one star because the cooking time is completely wrong. I took this out of the oven after the  25 minutes with it still sloshing around. Put it back in for 20 minutes...still sloshing around. Another twenty minutes (mind you everything we had prepared to go along with our quiche was cold now) and by the time I had had it in the oven for about an hour, we gave up and ate it still soft and gooey. Please correct the cook time. It is vastly inaccurate.

So easy and delicious.  I made mine with Parmesan cheese and mozzarella. My add-ins were 3 pieces of prosciutto, finely sliced and about a half cup of  thinly sliced scallions (both were spread on top of the cheese and then the egg mix was slowly added.  Served it at room temp for brunch.  A hit!

Very easy to make and delicious! However, you'll need to play with the creamer-egg ratio if you're adding fillers. I made two simultaneously and glad I did as one turned out a little soggy (too many mushrooms and spinach that leached water into the quiche) and the other one perfect. Here were my adjustments for the perfect one:
- 1 cup half-half
- 4 eggs
- About 4 oz. spinach & mushrooms
The consistency was great and it tasted phenomenal. One other adjustment I'll make next time is to cook the pie crust empty for about 10 minutes at 350°. Not necessary but I think it will get the bottom of the crust crisper. Bon appetit!

This is the BEST "basic" recipe for a quiche base that I have found - really no need to change anything - vraiment!! Use the basic recipe, then get creative...French cooking is an art, and a recipe is followed more as a guideline...especially for a good country quiche like this one!  Use this great basic recipe to make the egg base, then throw in whatever is left over in the fridge - pepperoni and jack, asparagus and Gouda...I remember Mémé making a quiche with leftover french fries and Velveeta! The only thing  I change in this recipe (if I have extra eggs) is I add a couple of separated yolks to give more color and and a firmer texture, especially if I am adding a juicy veggie like tomatoes. Great job Shelly!

I used 5 eggs, 1/2 can evaporated milk, 1/2 cup whole milk, 5 slices of Havarti cheese chopped up, the spices as recommended, 4 large chopped brown mushrooms, and I added sautéed chopped onions, 1/2 tsp minced garlic and a chopped 5 inch long smoked link sausage.  It was unbelievably delicious!  I can see me trying lots of different combinations with this!  Note:  I pre-baked my crust but I don't think I will next time.  It was overcooked.

this is a no-fail quiche as written, also holds up to additions like meat or veggies.  I have made it often.

Very easy and tasty!  I would suggest 1 1/2 c of half and half, 2 cups was too much for the piecrust.  I used fresh farm eggs, which tend to be smaller too.

I read the reviews that cut the half and half back by a half a cup. Instead, I kept the 2 cups and added 2 more eggs. 

Also, instead of a store bought crust, I used this https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24094/butter-flaky-pie-crust/

Came out Great!

I made this but followed others and cut down the eggs to 3 and half and half to 1 1\2 cups.  Added cheese, tomatoes, sweet potatoes  and squash spirals. Had to add 10 minutes also as it was still runny after the original time .

I found this recipe a few years ago and it was a HIT at a bridal shower I hosted.   Have tried a couple other recipes since then, but keep coming back to this one.  It has wonderful flavor - I think the Jarlsberg may be the secret.   Or the white pepper? Or the half and half?   Either way, this recipe can be adapted by adding spinach, onions, ham . . .  whatever we decide.   I find it is a well rounded flavor that appeals to everyone.   Will be serving it for Easter brunch again this year!  (This time I printed it out so I don't need to hunt it down on the internet again!  LOL)

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have any cream so used 1-1/2 cups of milk and sprinkled a little flour in with the cheese.  Added some chopped broccoli and bacon.  Definitely a keeper!

This is my go recipe whenever making quiche. I like that I can add whatever I want in the way of meats, veggies and cheeses. It doesn't matter what ingredients I use it always comes out perfect. I like a nice full quiche so I always use a deep dish pie crust and cut back on some of the half and half so I have plenty of room for all the good stuff I like to add. Most of the time I end up with 2 quiches.

Very good basic. I throw in whatever veggies I feel like as well as some kind of salty meat usually ham or bacon. I wish there was a formula for how much liquids to solids as I usually overdo the liquids.

Great & simple recipe!  I made the quiche with low-fat half-n-half, deli honey roasted ham, & packaged mozzarella/provolone shredded cheese mix since I was short of time.  Made it for Mother's Day brunch.....it was a hit!!  Served with side of fresh fruit.

Made this with chopped mushrooms I cooked in butter and then added a package of bacon pieces to and some chopped green onion I didn't cook before adding to the quiche. I used a premade Pillsbury crust and didn't bake it before filling it. For the cheese I used the prepackaged Mexican blend shreds and a bit of Swiss shreds too. It was good but I trouble getting it to "set" in the middle...next time I will use a couple more eggs, a 1/2 cup less half and half and cook it at 375 for 40 minutes after the initial 15 min at 425. It is a good basic base for any fillings I feel like using!

Great recipe!  I reduced the half & half to 1 1/2 cups and added in sauted onions, mushrooms and chopped ham.  I pre-baked the crust for 5 min. at 400°.  I baked the quiche at 400° for about 45 min.  My family loved it!

I use this basic recipe (doubled for two refrigerated ready made pie crusts) and use peppers jack cheese, a can of roasted chilies and a pound of ground chorizo (browned in skillet before adding). You can add anything to this basic recipe.

So, I agree with everyone else! Less egg and less milk! I used three jumbo eggs and 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup fat free half and half. This left room for me to add some sautéed red pepper, onion, mushroom, garlic, bacon, ham and cheese!! I like my quiches hearty and flavorful!! I used 7 pieces of bacon, two slices chopped boiled ham, 1/2 a large red pepper, 1/2 a large onion, two cloves of garlic and about 4 large white mushrooms. Then I added four ounces of cheese and it all fit perfectly in a nine inch pie shell! Filled just to the top!!

This is my 'go to' quiche recipe. I adapt it for lactose intolerance by using 5 eggs, lactaid milk, and shredded Swiss cheese. Sometimes I add bits of ham or garnish with sliced tomatoes.

Oh so good.  Finally made a quiche that came out perfect!  We both loved it.  I browned chopped bacon and minced onion.  Let it cool while I cooked down baby spinach.  Made the basic recipe proportions but the cheese I used was mild cheddar.  Blended it all together and put it in a pie shell.  Then I halved cherry tomatoes from the garden and placed them cut side up on the custard.  Delicious!

Ok, so I could not sleep tonight so I thought I would make this Quiche for my family to have for breakfast.  I have never made Quiche before... It turned out great.  I did have to make some different changes since I did not have a pie crust on hand.  I decided to use my spring form pan and make a crust like you would for a cheesecake.  I used digestive biscuits.  I crumbled in food processor with coconut oil, instead of butter, I had none, I used coconut oil and a bit of vanilla extract. I pulsed it till all crumbled. I pressed it down on my spring form pan, and sprinkled asiago cheese all over it. Then the beaten eggs w/cream and chopped up smoked Ham and sprinkled it on top... I cooked it for a little longer than instructed. Delicious!!! Great presentation.  I like the hint of sweetness in the crust....will make this again....

Great basic recipe! Try subsituting the half/half with sour cream, it is suprisingly delicious! Also, get creative with it. I made mine with browned sausage, fresh diced tomatoes, mushrooms (canned), green pepper, onion, and meunster cheese. I sauteed the green pepper and onions for a few minutes until tender.

This was my first quiche and I thought it was idiot proof.  I cut back cream just a tad and added an extra egg based on reviews.  I also pre-cooked crust a little, added sauteed onions, mushrooms, fresh broccoli, bacon, sharp cheddar and mozzarella.  I also cooked an extra 5 minutes. Perfection!  I will use this as my go to quiche for all occasions!
