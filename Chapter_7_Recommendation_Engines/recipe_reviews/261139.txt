Negate ketchup altogether. Made as directed (directions actually leave out ketchup) and family enjoyed it!

Would definitely make again. To make it richer, like disco fries richer...I used an organic beef bone broth concentrate to make my broth. It really kicked up the beefy rich flavor.

I was in a hurry and just threw in a dash of Worcestershire, a pinch of onion powder and garlic and it turned out great. I also only put in about 10-11 ounces of broth because I was afraid it would be too runny. It was great!

I did not like this a lot. It may be that I used a beef concentrate instead of "canned soup broth " but I found it too salty and not a nice taste . I will experiment with the recipe a bit more

I was puzzled about the inclusion of ketchup and dijon in a gravy, but thought I would try it.  In my family's opinion it was nasty.

I've always referred to myself as gravy challenged in the past. I guess that is history. This turned out great for me. I followed the recipe to a t and this turned out perfect for me. Thanks for sharing!
