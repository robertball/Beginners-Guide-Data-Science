I added a few other ingredients to make it more like a Mexican fajita. I added some cinnamon, lemon juice, oregano, cayenne pepper, minced garlic and a few other ingredients and I cut back on the vinegar to about a tablespoon, along with the olive oil. This made it to where it didn't need to be drained and it was delicious! My husband didn't even realize there was no meat and these are the best I've ever made! Thanks for the recipes!

This is a great recipe and the best part about it is that you can "tweak" it to match your taste and available ingredients. For the marinade, I cut down on oil quite a bit, used  lemon juice instead of vinegar and added crushed pepper in addition to chili powder. It worked great! I used all the recommended fresh veggies but no canned corn or beans. Finally I marinated veggies for 10 min at room temperature and then stir fried it on high heat on a very hot skillet. The results were mouthwatering and my husband loved it! Thanks so much for such a great recipe.

My husband complained loudly when he saw the name of this recipe. However, he really like these fajitas.  We topped with fresh tomatoes and cilantro (and my husband put cheese on his).  I also used only 2 Tbs. oil in the marinade. This is my new fajita recipe.

The marinade for this is wonderful, just like in a restaurant! I opted out of the black beans and corn, and used sliced baby portabello mushrooms to add a little heartiness instead.

These were good right off the stove but the leftovers were not good at all imo. But anyhow I did add more spices to the veggies and I also added in spices to the beans (I used pinto, only because I was making black bean rice). I also made guacamole. I definitely recommend adding in less vinegar and more dry spices. Spices I used were salt, black pepper, paprika, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder etc.

I have used this recipe many times and have always enjoyed it.  I do tweak it sometimes with more chili powder, etc.  I have passed this on to many friends as well.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe pretty closely, and it was okay. Since then, I've tweaked the marinade a bit by doubling the chili powder and adding a splash of lemon juice and a pinch each of cayenne pepper, cumin, and cinnamon. I usually leave out the corn and beans, and I let the veggies marinate for at least 2 hours. I love this recipe with those additions—it's so easy and flavorful—and I end up making it pretty frequently.

YUM!  I added 1 portobello mushroom to add some "meatiness".  I also added half a packet of "fajita" seasoning dissolved in water.  I also skipped the corn & beans opting for a cold corn & bean salsa on the side.  Next time, I will reduce the amount of olive oil as even drained, the serving dish had a ton of oil in it - which made the final few servings way too oily.

Definitely great & will make again!

yummo.  everyone loved them.  i originally mixed up jasmine rice and pinto beans for the side dish, then next day for leftovers put them in the fajitas.  delish!  definitely add some more spices, i added cinnamon, and then took a taco seasoning packet, mixed with some water and added that to the marinade.  also added avocado to the toppings at the end.

This is my first vegan meal I made for my family.  It was wonderful.  My husband didn't miss the meat at all!  I will make it again for sure.  What a great introduction to the vegan diet.  Thanks for posting.

I forgot to buy the zucchini and squash when I went to the store so I don't know how it would taste with thoes but with the remaining veggies this dish was FANTASTIC!!!!!  I used the greek style yogurt instead of sour cream and again these were the best!!!  I would eat this over any meat filled fajita. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe with all of us to enjoy!!!

this is one of the best things i have ever eaten.   i thought the amount of vinegar was fine. yum! i subbed white wine vinegar for red because it's what i had, and i folded the tortillas up burrito-style and baked them, seam down, at 350 for 12 minutes so the outsides crisped. soooooooooo gooooooood.

I have recently decided to try eliminating meat from my family's evening meal one night per week.  I just tried this recipe and I was very pleasantly surprised.  My husband, who seldom raves about any meal, kept telling me how much he liked this.  I loved it too.  We had it two nights in a row.  I only marinated my veggies for 30 minutes and they turned out very flavorful.  This one is a keeper!

Simple and easy ingredients.  The red wine vinegar is what gives it the authentic kick.  I added fresh ground garlic and some cayenne pepper to it also.

My wife has been a vegan for 8 years and I love to cook for her. This was delicious! The only thing I changed was adding a small amount of crushed, slow-cooked bacon. She didn't even notice (I certainly wasn't going to tell her) and she really enjoyed it!

Hmmmmmm...not my favorite.  The vinegar was overwhelming.  I love the idea & the veges, but I would go for more of a traditional fajita marinade next time.  Thanks anyway Nancy.

YUM!!  I loved these!!  I didn't have all the veggies, but used onions, red peppers, portobello mushrooms, and corn.  No beans since hubby is allergic to them.  Loved the flavor of the marinade!  Thanks so much for sharing!!  :O)

Very tasty! We served these over blue corn tortilla chips and made our own guacamole using Veganese and a couple of avocados (Veganese is a VERY good eggless mayo made from grapeseed oil). These were even delicious the next day served like this. Enjoy!

We are not vegans so I served these fajitas with sour cream and cheese. I suggest adding some spices like cumin, chili powder, salsa and cilantro (I can't imagine a mexican dish without cilantro). Also, I used pinto beans instead of black beans, just a personal preference. My husband wasn't very excited when he heard what would be for dinner, but it came out very good and we enjoyed it.

I didn't like this at all. The red wine vinager was just too overpowering for me. My husband ate it, but we agreed we wouldn't make it again.

This recipe was great as-is. Yummmm! My hubby and daughter added a little bit of sour cream and cheese to theirs. And some salsa because I didn't have any fresh tomatoes. So delicious! We will be making this again soon :).

I love this marinade for veggies! It has a really nice flavor without butter and too much oil. We use this recipe for tacos, fajitas or just put the veggies over rice.

My husband and I are trying to cut down on our meat intake and I wasn't sure if I would like this but it turned out great, only change was omitting green pepper since we aren't fans.  I did add some brown rice and black beans as suggested (forgot the corn) and my husband added a bit of cheese to his.  Very good and needed no spices after cooking.

I served this as a main dish for an all vegan mex themed meal. I tripled the amount of marinade as it didn't even begain to cover any of the vegtables. After reading others reviews, I lessened the amount of the red wine vinegar by 1/4, and it was fine on that aspect. I added more spice, as my family likes flavor.
I also used only one squach and one zucchini while adding more bell pepper in more colors, according to my family's taste.
I also didn't drain all the merinade and sauted the veggies in a bit of it to keep more flavor, still turned out rather bland. The merinade I did drain I used to cook chicken in for the non-vegans in the family to add to their fajita.
The first time around the food was OK, but rewarmed was no good at all. Which, considering the anoumt this recipe made is wasteful, and I hate to waste.
In short, it was alright, but I WILL NOT be making it again.

Turned out great but I did have to add more spices to get some flavor!  I also unveganized it by cooking the veggies in butter and serving with cream!

Perfect for a veggie lover like myself! I was going for a meatless meal and decided to try this.  I too added more chili powder and cumin, as well as fresh minced garlic (quite a bit) instead of garlic salt.  I didn't use salt or pepper.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was great! Low-calorie but still very tasty! I topped mine with a little bit of blend cheese, too, and had some sour cream on the side for a few bites.

I agree that these were very bland as written. However, with plenty of fresh garlic, extra chili powder and generous sprinklings of cumin, it had a great flavor. I did not use the corn (I wasn't in the mood for its sweetness), and I thought pinto beans were a better addition than black beans. Some of my family put the filling in taco shells. With the changes, I will keep this in my recipe box. It IS a great use of zucchini :)

I'm not sure if red wine vinegar is a good part of the marinade. It didn't have an authentic mexican taste to it but overall still tasted pretty good. I'm not vegan so I added sour cream on mine and used whole wheat tortillas. My husband wouldn't let me put the black beans in, though I wanted to. I also don't like canned veggies, so I added frozen corn while cooking the vegetables.

I made this because I am trying to find recipe's using zucchini and this was good! And I tried it with a flour tortilla and without so I think it's better without. The tortilla hides the flavors of the bell pepper's and the spices to me.

Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum! This was very good. I did make a few changes per other reviews and personal preference. I subbed half of the vinegar for lemon juice and didn't add quite the full amount. Even then, I think next time I would cut down a little more. I also added a bag of frozen shoe string fries to the veggies (I didn't  marinate them) and left out the beans and corn (because I made a side of beans). I love potatoes in my veggie fajitas. I had them that way at a local restaurant and was hooked. It makes them so much more satisfying! Thanks for the recipe!

This is so great! After reading the reviews, I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, reduced it and the olive oil to 2 tbsp, and added 1/2 tsp of red pepper and cinnamon. These were so fantastic, my husband ate SIX of them in the same sitting.

I didn't have time to marinate, just tossed it altogether, didn't drain and didn't add extra oil to saute.  My die-hard, meat-eating husband LOVED it.  We ate it wrapped in whole wheat tortillas the first night topped with a little mild salsa and just ate the leftovers as a side dish the next.  Hubby did add grilled steak the second go round and of course thought it was better but is STILL willing to eat them without the meat.

I enjoyed this dish and only made a few minor alterations (extra chili powder, a clove of garlic, left out the corn, little less vinegar/oil) came out great! Served with whole grain tortilla shells and even though I'm not supposed to eat it...I topped my fajita with a tsp. of sour cream before wrapping it up. Good stuff! I think sliced avacado would be a nice addition, wish I would have had one at the time.

This recipe was really good. Even my meat eating family enjoyed it! Though I did not have enough time to marinate the dish for 30 minutes it still turned out great! Thank you Nancy! Now I can eat this fajita version when my family is having their chicken fajitas! :-)

First vegan recipe I tried - a true winner!  My kids were at first appalled - "Where's the meat?" but they are still asking me to make them again a month later.  I skipped the vinegar, oregano and chili powder, instead opting for lemon juice and ground cumin to give it a more mexican flavor.  I also cut back on the amount of oil.  Served with homemade fresh guacamole and flour tortillas - vegan's not so bad after all.

Luckily, this dish was salvagable. The taste was suprisingly bland, even with the extensive marinade.  I was able to spice it up with a lot more chili powder, and a couple tablespoons of cumin.  With that, it was enjoyed by everyone.

These were amazing. I didn't have zucchini, but I added in carrots cut on the diagonal.  As usual, didn't add the sugar - doesn't need it. ;) Served with Mexican rice. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Yum!

I thought it was very good! I tweaked the recipe: I used less vinegar than called for, added lime juice to the marinade, and roasted garlic before sauteeing the vegetables. I used lettuce wraps instead of tortillas. I also only used one zucchini and one squash, as I was making the recipe for just two people (it still made ALOT but it was quickly devoured.) I shared the recipe with two non-vegans and they loved it! Also: the leftovers go really well in pasta sauce

Perfect recipe! Came out just great :) I didn't use as much red wine vinegar as the recipe stated - maybe half and added lemon juice and minced garlic. At the end I put avocado cubes and sriracha sauce on top for added creamy flavor and spiciness. I made some quinoa with chili powder, garlic salt, with caramelized garlic as a side dish that went well with the fajitas and added protein.

Loved this recipe....we are not vegan, so added some shredded mexican cheese as a garnish & used carb smart whole wheat tortillas to make a yummy wrap.  Would consider adding some fresh cooked shrimp or other fish too, although the recipe was filling and perfect as is.  Leftover veggies will be used up in lunches this week!

These are really good.  It's hard to find delicious vegan recipes sometimes.  This is definitely a keeper.
To cut back on fat, I only used a small amount of oil and added water during cooking.

This was delicious... as a newly converted vegan & first fajita attempt I thought the marinade was great & topped with cilantro & homemade guacamole and salsa. Even my non-vegan husband loved them (of course he added chicken, cheese & sour cream). Overall, quick, easy and flexible for all kinds of tastes & preferences!!

I added frozen corn which was a mistake too much water , I liked more cayenne pepper, more garlic and an additional can of beans. I cooked it again to brown it.

I had made this several times. I use tortilla wraps from whole foods, i serve with refried beans and rice. II took the idea from others to use lemon instead of vinegar for the marinade, and have even used lime. Otherwise I make it as the recipe calls and YUMM. !!!!!!

These fajitas were delicious especially when paired with the guacamole recipe by Bob Cody and refried beans.  I put everything in the tortillas and the family ate them up!

Entirely too sweet for my taste. Did not enjoy. Plus a lot of prep work. Won't make this again.

Added a little garlic to the marinade and it was pretty good, though I might use less vinegar next time. I also used mushrooms and omitted the black beans and corn. If you're not vegan, a little sour cream and cheese sets these off perfectly!

Yum!!! I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have black beans, so added kidney beans, and used red onion.  Then I served it in a whole wheat tortilla with sour cream, cilantro, and salsa.  Even the kids liked it.

Delicious! I added some salsa on mine. I ate the leftover filling as a side and as a quesidilla with low fat refried beans and salsa. Very tasty.

My father loves this instead of tacos. He says it reminds him of sweet and sour sauce. He usually puts this over rice. I added chicken so it wasn't vegan. I didn't have any leftovers!

This was a winner!!  Trying to sway the family to eat more vegetables... my son who does not eat hardly anything healthy even liked these fajitas!  I did tweak it a bit by adding  some Cumin, Paprika, & crushed red pepper.  I also kept the beans and corn mixture separate so that we could all add it on as desired.  Will be making this one again!!

My husband thought it smelled too vinegary for his taste, so we went ahead and added a packet of our typical fajita seasoning. I may continue to do this as the combination of marinade and seasoning packet was great. Loved having the beans and corn added, as well.

My husband loves this recipe. I make the beans separately and just add it to my fajitas because he does not like beans. It's a good recipe to have I just keep some in a ziplock bag and cook what I want and he eats when he gets home since he's a shift worker. It's a great recipe.

I needed a main dish to take to help out family friends who are vegan and thought this looked good. I am not vegan.  I substituted fresh lemon for the vinegar but followed the rest of the recipe and instructions precisely. The recipe was easy to follow. I made one dish for our friends and one dish for us. My husband ate it with tortillas and I ate it with rice. We both thought it was pretty good. Coming from people who like meat and cheese I think that's a high compliment. I hope our friends liked it too. Thanks for the recipe!

Family really liked it!  I substituted carrots for yellow squash because I was out of yellow squash.  I also served it with salsa to get a little more flavor.  My daughter (not a vegan) added cheese and sour cream to her fajitas.

This is a delicious recipe which can be easily tweaked.  Add a table spoon or two of tomato paste to the marinade and get that savory flavor that we all love in fajitas.  I also reduced the amount of vinegar by half which seemed about just right for my families taste.  You can also easily use a pre-made fajita seasoning to simplify the recipe if you are in a rush.

I cut the recipe in half and still had too many veggies so I had to add more olive oil and spices to let them marinate (I omitted round two of the vinegar because of others reviews saying it was too much and I don't care for vinegar too much). I served it with rice, cheese and sour cream (for the non-vegan). It was pretty tasty :)

Delicious!! Will absolutely make this again! Made one small change--used 1/8 cup of red wine vinegar and 1/8 cup fresh lime juice in marinade. Served on wheat tortillas with chopped fresh cilantro and avocado. Yummy!
