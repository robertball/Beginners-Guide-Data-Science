I got a Pampered Chef cookie press this summer and tried the recipe included.  The dough did not work well in my press.  Immediately I found this recipe and decided to try it for Christmas.  I made a double turn following the recipe exactly.  I used the butter flavored shortening.  These cookies were easy to make and the dough was perfect for my cookie press.  They are a melt in the mouth confection.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over.

Outstanding! I have made this recipe for four years in a row now at Christmas time.  There are my absolute favorite!!  I always double the recipe, and instead of 6 oz. of cream cheese I use one 8 oz. package. This consistency is great. I also add a little green food coloring and make a tree shaped cookie with my press! Watch the time though, at 8 minutes mine were turning a little too brown.

I just threw the ingredients into my KitchenAid!  I did substitute almond extract.  The cookies pressed out beautifully!  I would definately make them again!

These press beautifully and taste delicious, but I had to set my oven for 375 and bake for barely 8 minutes. Otherwise, they brown too quickly. I also suggest using parchment paper on your cookie sheets.

I did make a few changes to this recipe.  I added food coloring to make it more festive, added an extra egg, and used vanilla instead of lemon.  They were a perfect consistency for my cookie press.  It was the first time I had used the press and this recipe was just right!

This is a great pressed cookie recipe.  They came out of the gun great and kept their shape after baking.  I added food coloring so I would have pastel flowers for Easter and I also sprinkled some colored sprinkles on top before baking.  The cookies came out light and delicate and the lemon, cream cheese combination of flavors is wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and I will still probably run out before Easter!!! A keeper!!

I made two batches of this recipe last night for a church function. I had such a hard time with the first batch that I thought I must have made a mistake, but I had the same difficulties with the second batch. First, the dough was waaaaay too stiff; it was the consistency of a rolled sugar cookie dough, which was too difficult to work with the cookie press. I ended up having to add an extra egg yolk PLUS 2-3 tbsp. of water to the dough to get it loose enough. The first batch tasted very bland, so for the second batch I substituted almond extract. That helped a little. Sorry, this recipe was more trouble than it was worth.

This recipe was great - the cookies tasted delicious and were a hit at my office party!  The only problem I had was that the dough got warm pretty quickly and didn't work in the cookie press as well, so I had to take a break and put the dough in the fridge for a while.  As a result, the total prep time ended up taking about 1/2 hour longer than estimated.

These are quite nice; extremely mild, delicate flavor with the most wonderful sift texture
imaginable.  I brushed the tops w/ egg whites and sprinkled colored sugar.  Lots
of fun.

Delicious!  I made two batches of this recipe, one with lemon extract and one with orange extract.  I prefer the lemon.  They melt in your mouth.

Loved these! Doubled the recipe, and used full 8oz bar of cream cheese. This recipe was sooo incredibly easy`1 used the lemon extract, even though I was a ittle worried with them going to be xmas cookies, but oh, they were so good. I may try almond extract or vanilla next time, but idk, it was sooo good with the lemon

I started out following the recipe exactly, but that didn't work out for me.  The dough was very crumbly and dry, and wouldn't stick together.  I ended up adding another egg yolk and another 1/2 cup of shortening to moisten it up.  I also added 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Once I made those changes, the dough was great and had a good flavor.  I don't know what went wrong in the first place.

Having never used a cookie press before (I had one given to me), I wasn't sure what recipe would work best, so I tried several. This one was by far the easiest and most flavorful. It was good as is, but I tried tweaking it a bit. For more flavor I used butter flavor shortening, and used 4 oz cream cheese instead of three. For variety I used different flavorings and food coloring. I highly recommend this recipe!

I wasn't crazy about these cookies.  They really didn't have much of a lemon flavor and I had to add a couple tablespoons of milk because the dough was not a good consistency for the cookie press.  I then had to put them back in the oven a couple times because they flet like they were done, but after breaking one while placing them on the cooling rack they were still raw inside.  I might try some alterations to this recipe.

Absolutely amazing melt in your mouth recipe!! I did modified mine very slightly I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, 1 1/2 tbl spoon of strawberry extract and about 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract and 5 drops of red coloring which gave it a pretty pink shade. I had difficulty with the cookie press but I figured since the dough didnt really rouse as any other dough would in the oven, using two clicks makes slightly bigger cookie but it will come out easier and make sure the dough is chilled :) thanks again for the recipe it was great!!!

I initially rated this 2 stars but with a few adjustments I will make it a 4.  Since I had to open an 8 oz package of cream cheese for this I decided to double the recipe.  I used 1 tbs of lemon extract and 2 tbs of lemon juice.  Also, instead of using 2 egg yolks I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk.  They were very crumbly the first time I made this with yolk only and this solved my problem.  Made the cookies with a decorator bag and large star tip.  Easier than the cookie press and no clean up, just toss the bag.  Everyone loved the tartness and said they really melted in their mouths.  Thanks!  Also, the plain version without the additional lemon didn't taste of cream cheese.

I used butter instead of shortening, and added a little cinnamon, as I remember my mom's recipe calling for those. Delicious, a trip down memory lane with every bite. :) Thanks for posting this!

Not great, has a bitter taste to it. Maybe because of the lemon extract. Won't make these again.

I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews on this.  I thought it was dry and needed a lot more sugar.  The lemon flavor was barely detectable.  I think I'll be going back to a regular spritz recipe.  The only positive was that it did work well in the cookie press.

I'm shocked at the positive reviews on this recipe - I tried it last night to make cookies for a charity event and it was a nightmare! There was so much flour that it was really tough to mix, the dough didn't work in the cookie press at all so I had to put lumps of it on a sheet to make regular cookies, but they didn't spread and came out tasting like pastry! I creamed more butter and sugar and added it to the remaining mixture, AND sprinkles the tops with sugar before and after baking - better, but still not great. Thanks, but no thanks.

Yummy little cookies!! I used almond extract instead of lemon. They turned out delicious. My press was a pain in the neck, so that's why I rated it only 4. I ended up doing the last batch by making small 1/2 inch balls and pressing with a fork like a peanut butter cookie.

Wonderful recipe! Sometimes I have a hard time getting it to stay on the cookie sheet, but it seem to depend on the temperature of the dough.
I won 1st place with this recipe at our county fair!!

I'm not a big fan of making spritz cookies because they are always such a pain to get to come out of the spritzer. But this dough worked pretty well. The only problem I had was probably the fault of the particular disk I used in my spritzer. Once I changed it, they worked fine. I made two separate batches (one red, one green). The first batch I made exactly as the recipe states, except with butter flavored shortening. For the second batch, I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup because they just didn't seem very sweet, and I added about 4 oz of cream cheese instead of 3 because they were a little crumbly. This all seemed to help. They're pretty good little cookies.

They didn't really taste like cookies. More like a biscuit with a slight hint of cheese flavor.

These turned out wonderfully. Rich, flavorful and the dough is very easy to work with. I also used almond extract because that's what I had on hand. Hint: be sure that your cookie sheet has coolded completely before squeezing out a second batch or the dough won't stick. I used silpat liners which made it really easy for the dough to stick coming out of the press.

These were not very good, I was so dissappointed after reading the reviews.  I never made these with shortening before, only butter.  I'll got back to the cream cheese spritz recipe on my Wilton press booklet.  These had no taste and I made them extactly as described.

Very Good, I used vanilla and almond extract instead of lemon.  Live at high altitude and did not need to make any adjustments except cook for 7 minutes

Great recipe and is a standard in my Christmas baking (I would get in trouble with my sister if it weren't). The one change I made that makes such a big difference, is to use butter flavored shortening. Yummo - combined with the cream cheese and the lemon extract, it makes a perfect Christmas cookie!

Yuck.  The only change I made to this recipe were substituting vanilla extract for the lemon.  These tasted so sour to me!  And it wasn't that the cream cheese was sour - I checked it before adding.  I think the cream cheese flavor was just too much for this delicate cookie.  The consistency was good and they baked up nicely (good texture), but they just didn't taste right.  Will not be making this one again.

i substituted butter for the shortening and lemon juice for the extract (as i had neither in my cupboard!). i didn't use a cookie press, just rolled into small dough balls and flattened it slightly before baking. 

turned out great. very light and melt-in-your-mouth, but the taste was quite subtle. still good though!

These are the cookies my husbands mom use to make him as a kid.He loves them! I make them every year to remind him of his mom. She also used a  teaspoon of cinnamon, taste great with the cream cheese.I also use vanilla for flavoring instead of lemon.

Dough is hard to work with, used FAAARRR less flour than reciepe called for, wouldn't go through my spritz machine, too stiff, only the merest shadow of cream cheese flavor, in all a waste of my valuable baking time.

The cookies taste wonderful, but they are a pain to make. The dough doesn't go through the press easily, and the cookie sheet must be cold otherwise the dough won't stick as you press it onto the sheet. I thought the baking time was too long as well; I went with 7:15 and they came out perfectly. I doubt I'll be making them again, unfortunately.

The dough worked great in my press but lacked flavor (I thought it was just me and my cold).  Then my dad asked me why those cookies didn't taste like anything.  Maybe more extract would have worked for me.

A very easy recipe.  I love my cookie press and have been searching for a good spritz recipe.  I tried this one tonight and I like it.  I will most likely use it again.  The only problem I had was that I didn't have lemon extract so I substituted almond. The cookies came out all right.  I also used sea salt instead of regular and it was a bit too salty so I won't do that again (my bad).  I was a little suprised that the dough didn't spread out while it baked and some of the designs I used in the press didn't hold together after baking.  Other than that - the cookies are already gone!  :)

This was my first time making spritz cookies, and probably my last.  The dough was pretty dry, and tasted awful!  I couldnt taste any cream cheese, and the lemon flavor was sickening!

Though I did like these cookies, I was not fond of the aftertaste. It was somewat bitter. After trying them the first time I substituted butter for the shortening and there was no bad after taste. I also used orange extract instead of lemon and they were awesome.

After reading some of the reviews, i decided to use more that 3 oz of cream cheese.  i decided to use 6 oz.   i also used the whole egg.   Every year my husband asks for the cream cheese spritz cookies like his mom made.   i think this year we have the right recipe!  i had to press the cookie press twice to make them the size i wanted.  great dough consistency, easy to make and very delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly. I was worried about the dough consistency as I appeared crumbly when I mixed it with a hand mixer. I reached in with my hands and was able to form a ball. I loaded dough into cookie press and used two clicks per cookie. One click left just tiny, non-touching mounds. The yield was closer to 24 than 36. These do not spread much while baking.  I set the timer for the minimal time of 8 minutes. I baked two trays simultaneously, side by side, on dark non-stick cookie sheets. I attempted to use parchment paper initially, but the dough would not stick to it to get dough off cookie press. One tray was completely burnt on the bottom and not palatable and other quite brown, nearly burnt. Aside from being burnt on the bottom the cookies had a delicate flavor. Do not expect an intense lemon flavor. The flavor is meant to enhance the taste of the cream cheese and not be a dominate flavor. They were not overly sweet. If you want them a bit sweeter I might suggest dusting them with powdered sugar or maybe even a lemon glaze. I wonder if the 400° temperature was too high. Maybe the use of dark non-stick pans was a factor? I will give this recipe another try, but will probably lower the temperature to  350° .

Wasn't too sure about this so I stuck with almond flavoring, Ya know, they are a bit different then the original spritz I made for my kids 50 years ago but they are great. My pastors wife sent me a text saying, Ann, please bring 4 or 2 doz. cookies to church Sunday.  When I stopped laughing, I started baking spritz and have 6 doz.

I subbed almond extract for the lemon extract. I'm missing part of my cookie press so made balls and pressed them into circles with my hands. That worked ok. Using a pastry bag and large tip did NOT work.

My sister and I both thought it close to the recipe we used growing up which has since disappeared. I thought it was a bit heavy on the flour.

I made this recipe based on the helpful review that said she made them with a Pampered Chef cookie press.  I doubled the recipe to make hearts for Valentine's Day, & shamrocks for March.  The consistency was PERFECT, and the lemon extract made these delightful!! I will definitely make these again WAAAAY before Christmas spritz are needed!
