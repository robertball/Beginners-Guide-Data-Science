I replaced the strawberries with grapes because my son is allergic.  Everyone really liked this, even my husband who generally refuses to eat fruit with supper (it's "dessert" to him).  I eyeballed the honey and will probably add a bit more next time and may try substituting OJ for the lime juice.  But good as is and will make again!

Love this in the winter when fresh fruit is less abundant.  I hold the banana until prior to serving as it may become brown and mushy.  I have also used halved grapes when strawberries are out of season.

Wonderful recipe.  I put additional strawberries, honey, kiwi, and lime juice in, ommitted the bananas, and added pecans, and it was one of the best salads I've ever had.

This is great for parties or to accompany a meal. However, if you want fresh banana, add before serving. The grated lime peel isn't necessary, and you can use the bottled lime juice. This is my favorite fruit salad, so easy to make.

This was very good, but the flavor of the lime and honey was not as strong as I expected.  I will definitely make this again, but will increase the lime and honey a little and keep the pineapple juice at 1/4 cup.

I loved this recipe. I would recommend putting it in a clear glass bowl as it is so bright in color. I would also recommend doubling it if you plan to feed a few more than the typical family. Everyone loved it. I served it as a dessert at a summmer dinner.

So yummy!  Fresh fruit is great by itself, but this is a beautiful combination with an extra special touch!  I loved it!  Even better with chopped fresh pineapple!

This is also great with papaya, banana, mandarin oranges, thin sliced granny smith apples, and blueberries. I made a yogurt dip by mixing instant vanilla pudding into plain yogurt and thinning it with milk. Top with toasted coconut.

My family thought this was the "usual" fruit salad until they tasted it.  It was a big hit.  I used someone's hint and used lime juice.  MMMMM... tasty.

The fruit salad was easy and tasty, but not outrageous - the 'dressing' tasted like the reserved pineapple juice, and very little hint of the lime or honey.  My family ate it all up, though!

The honey and lime add a very nice touch to what would otherwise be a basic fruit salad.  If I made it again I would probably increase the lime and honey a bit. I made it to take to a cookout and it went over quite well.  Definitely a great summer recipe!

I used fresh lemon juice in place of the lime and left out the grated peel. I also added a chopped apple for a little crunch. Very good, and the juice kept the fruit colorful and fresh-looking even after a day or two.

In the words of my son "this salad rocks". At the last minute I discovered my kiwi were bad so I left them out but otherwise made as is.  Very fast and easy.  Very tasty, not too sweet not too tangy.  I cut the banana fairly thick so I thought there needed to be more.  Next time I will use two.  Also I didn't relly see the point in the lime zest so in the future I will try it without.

Very good.  We substituted grapes for the berries since it was January.  This is the best out-of-season fruit salad recipe I've tried.

Delicious!  What a lovely combintation of flavors.  I followed the advice of others and added more lime juice and honey (I doubled each).  This salad was a huge hit at a recent family gathering!

This recipe was great.  I omitted the bananas becaue me and the fiance don't really like them. We topped this fruit salad with whipped topping to make it more dessert like.

Simple to prepare. I didn't measure the honey, lime juice or peel -- just went ahead and eyeballed it and adjusted to my taste.

I was really excited about this recipe, but disappointed after tasting it.  Not sure if it was the fruit I chose or what.  I will make it again with all fresh fruits.  It did look really pretty though.

The combo of the sweet honey and the brightness of the lime zest and juice was the best!  I was able to use fresh pineapple (YUM!) and I may section an orange next time.  I love mandarin, but they are so delicate and just fall apart so easily.
