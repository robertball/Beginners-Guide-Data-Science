Nice change from the regular treats! Make sure you don't use the caramel sundae syrup. Use the thicker caramel ice cream topping in the jar.

I am a  student  from South Korea. It was the first American food for me to make.  It was an assignment for class. I think it was  a good experience for  me. It is similar to the Korean traditional cookies called Kangjung. This Rice Krispieâ€™s  recipe is easy and fast, so I can eat it  easily. It tastes and smells good, but it would be better with some peanuts or M&Ms.  Also using cooking cutters would be  more interesting for kids  because  you can make various shapes, for example stars, circles or other shapes.  Everyone in our class liked The Rice Krispy  made by me, so I think everyone in the world would like this dessert:)

Yum!  Love the idea and taste.  Wish I had read the reviews to use the thicker ice cream topping sauce, but they still set up okay.

I thought the original was great! These are amazingly delicious. Buttery caramel makes these soooo good! I used Butterscotch Caramel Ice-cream topping. Great idea, Thanks! *****

Good, definitely edible, but not necessarily an improvement over the traditional recipe, too gooey/not easy to cut into stand alone squares.

So very yummy! Will keep this recipe in my collection. They were very soft even with the thicker sauce, but maybe the high humidity today has something to do with that. Will just keep them in the fridge-they won't last more than a day anyway! Thank-you for the recipe!

Didn't taste very carmelly.  I like regular krispy treats better.

I used individually wrapped caramels instead of sundae topping - big mistake. They make the treats really hard! I added a little bit of sea salt on the top and got rave reviews at the party I brought them to!

These taste really yummy just by following the recipe, but I doctored mine up a bit.  I added a 1/4 cup more caramel than it called for to give it a little more flavor.  Then I melted chocolate chips and drizzled the chocolate all over the top (which dressed it up a bit).  Very yummy!

I joined Allrecipes just to rate this with 5 stars!  I made it with my 10 year old and 6 year old girls.  We used real butter melted with fresh marshmallows and Smuckers Butterscotch Topping (from a jar) instead of carmel.  We then sprinkled milk chocolate chips in with the rice krispies as we stirred everything together.  We ate almost half of the treats in the first 5 minutes.  Fun with my daughters never tasted soooo good!

Great recipe!!  Loved the caramel addition to a classic recipe.
