This soup is surprisingly tasty for being a meatless meal. I was hesitant about the cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, but followed the recipe's instructions, and the end product isn't "too" any of that. It's just right. Interestingly, I believe the "sweet" spices are what adds the "comfort" to this soup--there IS something unidentifiably "homey" about the flavor, and I'm pretty sure it's the sweet spices. As far as changes went: I reduced the butter, reduced the salt, and added 5 oz. fresh spinach at the end after I removed the soup from the heat, simply because it needed to go. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was so very good. The nutmeg and cinnamon add such an interesting aroma that everyone in the house had to come see what it was. And the mixture of salty and sweet was perfectly balanced. I will definitely be making this one again.

This recipe is wonderful.  My husband ate 4 helpings and the baby ate it too! Great for a cold night.  I didn't have celery, nutmeg or sage so I used only 6 cups of chicken broth.  I may try it in full next time but maybe not.  I was really proud of this meal without all of that.  Very good soup!  Thank you!

I really liked this soup and I'm not a big fan of soup.  I used beef broth since I was out of chicken broth.  My teen-agers absolutely loved it!!

Delicious! Really simple and really tasty. I don't have access to a blender at the moment, so I was looking for a soup recipe that didn't involve any pureeing and this one worked perfectly.

I made this soup with beef stock, without onion and without sage.  I halved the recipe as I cooked it in the crockpot.  Came home and pureed it with a hand held mixer just before I served it with buttered bread.  It wasn't as sweet as I expected, but was very tasty nevertheless.

I loved this soup! I great blend of flavours. Would love to make this when guests are over. I would put in less butter next time because once the soup starts to lose water content a layer of oil comes to the top which is unattractive. My 11 year old brother isn't a fan of red peppers and refused to eat them so I put his bowl into the Magic Bullet and made it into a shake for him. If you have young kids who don't want to eat the veggies and you want to hide the goods, a hand blender would work well too; right into the pot. My mom thought it would be a smart idea to put grated cheese into the soup: NOT RECOMMENDED! It stuck right to the bottom. But over all, YUMMY soup!

Good start, but I had to tweak it a lot. I roasted the red pepper according to the food network recipe- 500 F for 40 minutes with rotating the pepper every 10 minutes. I also added some chicken and sauteed it with the onions before putting in the rest of the ingredients. I used home made chicken stock, and used enough to cover all if the indigents. I had used my slow cooker, so I browned everything first and then put it on high for 3 hours. Didn't change the amount of spices and art the end, the soup had a hint of sweetness and some spicy flavors from the black peppers. Eating as a main meal, really only 4 servings for me

Wow!  I totally love this soup!  A hint of unusual flavor from the spices in it simply makes it exceptional.  Easy enough to make, too, though there's a fair amount of chopping. It definitely took the hour to make that was indicated.  Serve with bread, and you are good to go on a cool night.

This just O.K. for me. The cinnamon and nutmeg didn't taste right in this soup. It did taste better the 2nd day.
I won't be making this one again.
