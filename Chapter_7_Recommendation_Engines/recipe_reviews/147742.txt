I made this for a holiday work function.  I had so much fun making this cake and I was really happy with the results.  Everybody loved the cake - I used a chocolate cake mix.  My frosting was thick.

I have made this cake three times now and each time I make it , it is a hit.  For Christmas I am going to make it into an ornament cake.  The frosting is delish.  Start from the bottom up when making the lines.  The frosting should not break going from bottom to top.

I made this cake for a party I'm going to tonight.  Although I'm thrilled with the way the cake turned out (how cute!), in my opinion, the frosting was not thick enough and spread too thin.  I had to keep adding more confectioner's sugar (probably about a cup more) to get the right consistency & by then, the frosting was a little bit too sweet for my taste.  This is the first time I've decorated a cake with frosting in many years, so it could just be me!

I made this cake for thanksgiving and it came out very cute, but the frosting was very sweet and thick. I made a white cake from scratch, but had to add more cream cheese to the frosting because I could not taste it. Next time I will probably but the can of betty crocker cream cheese frosting.

This cake was so much fun to make. My co-workers all thought it was cute. The frosting was easy to make, although it was way too thin. But other than that, the cake was delicious for my co-workers and I!

I made this cake for Halloween, but I didn't use the recipe stated for the icing, I used 2 cans of the Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting instead and it came out wonderful. The flavor of cake I used was spice cake. Very cute!
