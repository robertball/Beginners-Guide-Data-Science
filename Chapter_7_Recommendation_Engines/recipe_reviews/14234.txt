This was amazing!  I took others advice and added craisins and turkey bacon. The calorie & fat count for this recipe was really scary, so I tried to decrease them by using turkey bacon, light mayo, less peanuts, and a little less sugar.  We loved it and I'm going to make it often.

This recipe is excellent.  I have made it several times. As one other reviewer noted, I used craisins instead of raisins (I hate raisins)....plus the cranberry color with the green broccoli looks great on the table around the holidays. I also used a red onion instead of green onion.  Yum.

Super simple to make and wonderful to eat.  I've never cared for broccoli no matter how it was made until I had it like this.  I have even adapted it for the South Beach Diet by leaving out the raisins, using turkey bacon, and Splenda instead of sugar and it is still wonderful.

This is excellent!!  I used Louis Rich turkey bacon because I prefer it to real bacon and substituted coarsely chopped pecans for the peanuts.  I serve this at all our family gatherings in the summer and it gets rave reviews each time.  Thank you for sharing!

My aunt makes a version of this as a side dish for Thanksgiving every year.  It is always delicious!  I substituted turkey bacon, lite mayo, and golden raisins to add more color.  I took it to a church potluck and it was gone quickly!  Thanks, Kecia!!

This salad is wonderful! I've also used the dressing (sugar, vinegar and mayonnaise) with packaged shredded cabbage and some celery seeds for a quick cole slaw. My family loves it!

I just had this at a baby shower yesterday and it was wonderful.  Even better, my two-year-old loved it and I loved that she was eating broccoli!  I highly recommend this as a cold salad for picnics or just to keep in the fridge to serve with lunch.

I love this recipe. I've always love broccoli salad. The only changes I made was I added more broccoli and left out the onions. Also I substituted the peanuts for toasted cashews and added in some cubed mozarella cheese. I know the cheese may sound odd but I found it mingled really nicely.

Very yummy. Even though its got lots of nutrition in it, I wouldnt call it the healthiest salad because of the bacon, sugar and mayonaise, but a good salad for special occasions

The mayo, bacon, peanuts, raisins, and sugar create a tasty combination to dress-up broccoli. This recipe is more of a special occasion treat (e.g., a picnic, social event) as it is loaded with fat and very high in calories. Other than substituting cashews for peanuts, this recipe was made as written in order to have a baseline comparison. Many of the reviewers made significant changes to the recipe in trying to make a healthier version. We would either search for an alternative, healthier version of this recipe or attempt substantial modifications like others have done to better balance a great tasting salad with nutritional health. I’m going with a 5* rating as AR has disclosed the nutritional content, and each person can be their own judge on that.

This was outstanding.  Made a few changes as others suggested -- used 1/4 C each craisins & sunflower seeds and only 4 slices bacon, plus Splenda. The amount of broccoli is not very specific, but I used one large crown that yielded 4 C or more.  Good advice to cut quite small. Result was better than any similar market salad I have had.

Excellent!  I used craisins, finely chopped sweet onion, bacon bits, cashews and of course broccoli because that is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again.

Used splenda, low fat mayo and only 1/4 cup, more vinegar, mixed nut medley, and green onion.  It is just great!

This recipe was great as is. I made it the second time and changed just a few things. I used red wine vinegar in place of the cider vinegar. Added craisins along with the raisins. I also used red onion in place of the green onions and added some yellow, red, and orange colored bell peppers which made for a beautiful presentation. I also used Splenda in place of the sugar. It turned out just awesome! Thank you for the recipe Kecia!

This salad is absolutely delicious.  The flavors meld together wonderfully.  I halved the recipe to see if we would like it.  Potato salad used to be my signature dish but I am definitely taking this to the next cookout.

Yummy...the dressing is perfect. I substituted chopped red onions, and cashews because it's what I had on hand.

This recipe is also good using Cole Slaw Dressing in place of the vinegar, sugar and mayo.

This has been one of my family's favorite salads for years.  I always use red onion, salted sunflower seeds, shredded cheddar cheese and leave out the raisins.  I have used Craisins in place of them since I'm not fond of raisins but they give the salad the same sweetness and texture.  I also add freshly ground pepper to the dressing.

Great recipe.  Sometimes I substitute  seedless red grapes and some shredded cheddar  cheese, in place of  the bacon and onion to give it a different twist.

So tasty. My "ew, raw-brocolli" husband changed his tune when he tasted this salad. It's just as I imagined it to be. I spaced the "chopped" part of the peanuts so they were in there whole, but it was still good. Only tip would be to adjust the amount of broccoli to dressing ratio to suit your tastes. I treated "one head" to be two smaller florette heads (how my produce market sells them) and I think I could have gone up to four of those smaller heads and still had plenty of dressing and other goodies in the mix.

Since my hubby won’t eat broccoli, I used broccoli slaw instead.  He liked it and was shocked to learn he ate broccoli!  I used less sugar and it was still wonderful.

Very good !!  Cut the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup.  I used sunflower kernels instead of peanuts.  I left out the bacon due to too much fat and didn't miss it .  I used craisins as well.

Very good. Made as written except used craisins and half the sugar. Was still pretty sweet, so may use even less sugar next time.  The combination of sweet and salty was a winner.

Great quick recipe...I did change a few things. Omitted the green onions, not my thing, used craisins, sunflower seeds and walnuts, added shredded carrots! Yum!
