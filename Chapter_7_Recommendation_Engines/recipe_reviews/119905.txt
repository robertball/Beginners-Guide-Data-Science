This was SO easy and quite good! I didn't want to go to the store, so I had to leave out the celery and water chestnuts.  Also, I was using a 16 oz jar of Ragu cheese sauce so I doubled the other ingredients, including a 32 oz bag of (still) frozen broccoli.  It was probably finished in about 3 hours but I just kept it warm for the rest of the day, occassionally adding some broth to thin it out.  Thank you for the simple supper that we ALL enjoyed!

I cooked mine for 4 hours and is tasted fantastic. I used cooked bacon instead of ham and ommited the water chestnuts and celery as i don;t like them, but it still turned out reaaly good.

It took a lot longer than 2 hours to cook, more like 4-6.  But my husband loved it and asked me to make it again.

I thought it was great!!  I read a few reviews that said it was bland so I jumped the gun and added a little Italian seasoning to it while it was cooking.  We loved it!!

Great Dish! Took longer than 2 hours, closer to 5-6. Worth it!
