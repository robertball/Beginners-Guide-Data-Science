Thank you for a delicious and moist recipe that made my house smell wonderful while it was baking.  For those of you asking questions about golden syrup: Golden syrup, like molasses, is a product of the process of refining sugar. It is simply sugar cane juice that has been boiled down. It has the consistency of corn syrup, but a golden color and a taste different from either light or dark corn syrup, and also substantially different from its cousin, molasses. 

This recipe is unlikely to taste as good without the use of honest-to-goodness golden syrup, but if you must, you can try substituting it with 2 parts light corn syrup and 1 part molasses or equal parts of honey and light corn syrup. You can purchase Lyles Golden Syrup on Amazon.com if you can't find it in local stores.  Hope this helps.

In order to help when looking for the ingredients,  golden syrup is the English reference to molasses.

Very moist loaf.  Really good recipe.  I used a lemon sauce for the cut slices.  I used corn syrup for the golden syrup because I wasn't sure what golden syrup is either.  I also added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice and 3 tsp of cinnamon sugar mixture.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to search for golden syrup so I could use the ingredients called for in the original recipe.  I called a few gourmet and "world market-type" food stores and found it quite easily.  Lyle's Golden Syrup is a popular brand most all of them carried and not terribly expensive, either.

This gingerbread was absolutely delicious.  It smells wonderful while baking and produces a thick, moist loaf.  The only change I made was to increase the ginger to 2 Tablespoons.  

I believe I will be using this recipe from now on.  Try it and see for yourself - you won't be disappointed.

This was pretty easy to make and as promised, moist and delicious. My only problem was, what's with the golden syrup and 6 oz of butter? I needed to do a little math to figure that if 8 oz are in a cup, and a stick is a half a cup, then I needed a stick and a half. I just winged it and assumed golden syrup was corn syrup. I still don't know if I was right, but the recipe came out ok.

I tried this recipe yesterday the bread is exactly what I was hoping for.  It is moist and firm, holding together when sliced and even when buttered.  I did use two tablespoons of ginger instead of the recommended one, but that was the only change I made to the recipe.  It rose beautifully in the bread pan and makes a fine big loaf.  I won't look any farther than this for a gingerbread recipe.  This is first-rate!!

Makes a very dense, heavy loaf, but has a wonderful flavor and is absolutely delicious the next day slathered with butter.  I loved it!  By the way, I did not have golden syrup so I used molasses in its stead.  Turned out great.

This is a delicious gingerbread.  I happened to have some golden syrup I brought back from Australia, so I was fortunate enough to be able to follow the recipe exactly. It was just right, and stayed nice and moist for several days.  Delicious with butter!

Unexpectedly Great! I'll explain, for starters I had to improvise as I hadn't all ingreds. required onhand (like all spice, ground ginger, corn syrup or maple lol...the main ingredients) and also wanted it to be nearly sugar-free, so here's what I did: In the saucepan I  heated 1/4C sugar, 3/4C water, 2Tsp honey & 1/2Tsp maple syrup,1tsp vanilla extract,1/2 tsp orange essence, and 1Tbs fresh grated ginger and a pinch fresh grated orange zest (what the heck, might as well...right anywho)and followed the rest of the recipe as it stated only instead of using 2C all purpose flour, I used 1C wheat &1C all purpose flour and 1Tsp cinnamon. I plan to pick up the ingredients required on my next shopping trip as I intend to make this bread exactly as the recipe states. Improvising with what I had onhand also turned out to be a very delicious, dense, bread. My hubby said it tasted alot like sweet potato bread and he ate quite a few pieces of it. So I guess I gained 2 recipes from one. Definately making again both ways. Thanks

I will not rate this recipe as I have changed too many things for it to be considered the same.  However, I will rate the technique, which deserves a 5.  First of all, I was looking for a quick bread that did not require the creaming step (i hate creaming), and I came upon this.  I substituted oil for the butter (another reviewer was confused about how much butter to use, but I think 6 oz of butter means by weight, not by volume, which would make it about a third of a stick) i used about 2 oz of oil (by volume) and instead of the syrup, I used buckwheat honey.  Furthermore, I substituted light brown sugar for the white - and I think I used a bit less than a cup. I didn't use allspice since I didn't have it, but added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  When I boiled the liquid mixture, the milk curdled, but i used it anyway.  Upon pouring the boiling mixture on top of the dry ingredients, the batter started to set immediately, which was why the texture of the final bread was so dense and sturdy (i love that and the fact that it doesn't crumble when it's cut).  Basically, I think the technique is genius, and I will use it for every other quick bread recipe I can adapt.

Absolutely wonderful!! I was a bit skeptical about a gingerbread recipe that didn't use molasses, and about the fact it's so light in colour (I like the look of a dense, dark gingerbread loaf). But this is AMAZING. My whole family loves it. The texture is perfect...I made 12 muffins instead, and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes. The outside was a tiny bit crispy and the insides were dense but very moist. Made a test batch yesterday and will make a triple recipe today! (BTW, I used Rogers golden syrup...easy to find in Canada).

This recipe is very moist, full of flavour. I used half molasses, half honey as I could not get a hold of Golden Syrup. Was a great substitute. So far, every who has tried this loves it.

I had great success with this recipe and I give it as gifts at Christmas. I did make a couple of changes ... I added 1 tsp of cinnamon; increased the ginger to 2 tbsp; swapped out the white sugar for 1 cup of brown sugar. Thank you for sharing this nice, old-fashioned bread!

This recipe did not turn out right.  It's missing something, eggs??, I don't know but it didn't rise and was kind of greasy.  Still edible so I'll take it to work - they'll eat anything there.  Waste of time and ingredients in my opinion.

I found Lyle's Golden Syrup in the syrup aisle of QFC (grocery store chain in my region). I made this for dipping into chocolate fondue at a Xmas party. Major YUM!!! If serving for company, bake the day of; your house will smell terrific for hours! A holiday keeper for my household.

"Never fail"? As much as it pains me to rate a recipe with so little stars, I can't give this any more than 2...and that's only because of the ease of the recipe.  I'm very selective in what I chose to make off this site and I tend to only make things that have high star ratings, so I was fairly confident that this would turn out really well. I did everything exactly as stated in the directions and I could not get the bread to cook all the way through.  I really had high hopes for this! If I try to make this again I'll update my review...however, that's a mighty big IF.  Thanks for sharing tho!

Gingerbread came out awesome!!  Next time I plan on adding crystallised ginger and more allspice, but as is, this is great, a nice moist recipe, and its true, there was no hard crust!  I used a mixture of the good old Chelsea golden syrup and some real maple syrup (we were running low on the golden syrup LOL) and it came out just lovely.

I baked this loaf today and it was heavy, and had absolutely no ginger taste, in fact it had no taste at all and the house did not smell of any ginger or allspice while baking and that should have been my first clue about this recipe. As far as no hard crust goes it was like sawing through a piece of wood.  I am sooooo disappointed. The only positive is no creaming was necessary, technique easy.

Have made lots of ginger cakes over the years but this one is delicious so moist, I couldn’t leave it alone.

this turned out SO GOOD! Rather than golden syrup, I used 2 parts molasses and 1 part corn syrup in its place. I did have come clumping/curdling in the pot, but I went with it and it was fine. I only needed to bake it about 45 minutes, too. The only thing I'd do differently is not flour the pan so much - maybe spray would have been enough on its own, as the flour got caked onto the loaf in a few places.

Do not expect this to taste like most gingerbreads, which are yummy but taste mostly like molasses and cinnamon. This is a very nice variation and a great counterbalance to all of the cinnamon-heavy autumn recipes. To make it slightly healthier, I used half butter half coconut oil, whole wheat pastry flour, and for the golden syrup I went with 2 TBS agave syrup + 1 TBS blackstrap molasses. I couldn't resist doubling the ginger, because I love that flavor. I did resist the urge to add egg and cinnamon, and I am glad I resisted. It is a fragrant and scrumptious, moist, truly ginger-bread. Thank you for this really wonderful recipe. P.S. I am going to try the boiling rather than creaming technique on some other quick breads and see what happens :)

Love this bread. Used karo syrup instead of golden syrup still tasted great. Great for Christmas treats. Not an over ginger flavor.

Really great.  I used molasses instead of golden syrup and the taste is mild but very gingerbready.  I baked it in a glass bread pan for about 63 minutes and it came out crusty and crunchy all around and moist and cakey inside.  The technique of boiling the butter, sugar, milk and molasses was one I'd not used before but it was so easy.  Thanks for posting this.

This was amazing, everyone was raving about it.  Moist and flavorful. I didn't have golden syrup instead substituting molasses and corn syrup.

Not the taste of gingerbread. I wouldn't make this again!
