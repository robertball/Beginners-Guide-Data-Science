Too cute! These are so simple, and leave you kicking yourself saying, "Why didn't I think of these"? I guess that's why it's just such an ingenious little recipe! The best part is eating the ones you don't need for decorating! These are great to put out in candy dishes too. Thanks for yet another great recipe, What's for dinner, mom?

***To those who do not agree with the butterscotch chip on the top - I used that due to ALLERGY issues.  I never make peanut butter ANYTHING when giving food to anyone so I used the butterscotch.  Please use whatever flavor you like***   I recommend that if you are using these for cupcake decorations to put them on just prior to serving as the cookie will absorb the moisture from the frosting and become soft. Also, I have found NutterButter Mini cookies that are perfect for these!  The tops look textured like an acorn.  These are fun and easy for kids to make!

I made these at Thanksgiving to put out with appetizers as a little sweet treat and they were gone within the first half hour!!  I used mini Nilla wafers since they are the perfect size for the Kisses.  I also subbed peanut butter for the frosting...I thought it made the fact that the Nilla, Kiss, and butterscotch chip were pasted together less noticeable.  Great recipe!!!

YUMMY!  I used Nutter Butter Bites in place of vanilla wafer cookies and Reese's Peanut Butter Chips in place of the butterscotch chips.  To attach I melted some of each candy and dipped into it so it wouldn't show where it was attached.  They were YUMMY!  My reason for the change is that I was looking for something peanut butter for my step-father.  This recipe is going to make him so happy.  The hardest part is keeping Hubby away from them.  I know I have to make more!  Thanks WFDM for another YUMMY recipe!

I loved the way these looked and had to try them when I saw them! I had some butterscotch chips in the freezer and some leftover thick buttercream frosting, so all I had to buy was the kisses and wafers. And, I did get the mini, because they seemed the perfect size. Although, I did not make all 24, I had fun making the ones I did. I know my neice and nephew will like these way better than the acorns they have helped me clean-up in the yard! And, they will be perfect again on some fall cupcakes. :)

As soon as I saw these, I just knew I had to make them for my Thanksgiving cupcakes! These are not only easy and adorable, but they are yummy too (believe me I 'taste-tested' enough to know, lol)! I like to surprise my guests each year with a new confection and I can't wait to see the look on their faces tomorrow when they see these. Thanks WFDM, for such a cute idea, that I know will be part of many, MANY fall desserts to come! :)

These are SOOOOOOO fun!  I made them using the almond filled kisses, mini Nutter Butter sandwich cookies (pulled apart) and mini chocolate chips.  The kids really liked the design on the Nutter Butters and the chocolate/peanut butter taste!

ADORABLE idea!  We made these today for a baby shower we're hosting tomorrow (Get it?  Acorns because they're adding to the family tree.). Thanks for such a brilliant recipe!  :-)

These are so cute!!
Some variations I made:  *Used chocolate frosting instead and * 1/4 piece of a pretzel stick for the stem.

No one could get over how adorable (and delicious) they were!

These are really cute - if you look at them from the side.  If you look at them from a top view, they look like boobs.  So subtract a star for sending them to my husband's office for his Thanksgiving luncheon and everyone seeing a plate of boobs.

Grandkids, ages 3-7, LOVED making these on Thanksgiving. I always try to have a craft for them, and this was so much fun!  Not too hard for them at all. I let them each have their own ziplock baggie of icing with a tiny hole cut in the bottom edge for piping out the frosting.

So super cute and easy and quick to make and my kids thought they were yummy.My 9 yr old helped me make them. One suggestion is instead of prepared frosting, melt 1/2 c of the butterscotch morsels in the microwave at 50% for 1 minute (add 30 seconds at a time if it needs more time to melt) in a small shallow ceramic bowl. Stir and use that as the "glue" for the kiss and morsel. You only need a tiny dab for each. I was able to take these to a peanut free school too!

These are perfect! They taste great, easy and fun to make as well as super cute. I couldn't find the mini wafers so I went with the original ones and it looks a little funny but you get the idea.

I tried the peanut butter instead of icing, as a reviewer suggested, but it was messy and I think is going to stay gooey instead of firming up and holding the candy on. But I love peanut butter. So at least it will taste good!

Cute little cookie for Thanksgiving.  Didn't particularly get or like the flavors all together.  Maybe if I had used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch.

5 for creativity and ease.  They taste like whatever you use to make them obviously.  I used butterscotch chips and peanut butter and the kids loved eating and making them for Thanksgiving this year.

Cute and fun to make!! I used PB chips. 

TIP - put a little plate over a bowl of hot water, sit the kisses and chips on the plate for, oh 10 seconds or so (depends on how hot your water is and how thick your plate is - if that surface is pretty hot it could just be a few seconds), and just glue the chips and kisses into the nilla wafers with their own melty bottoms. Don't even mess with frosting, it's unnecessary, more money, and you're not sure if it'll harden or not. Mine also had a cleaner look with this method.

They were a HUGE hit with both the adults & kids at Thanksgiving dinner! They were also easy to make (& make look nice...) with minimal expense or effort. I used a DH whipped milk choc  cake frosting as the 'glue'  bc I can't stand heavy frosting & it paired well with the milk choc kisses & butterscotch chips. ..they disappeared quickly & the toughest part was unwrapping the kisses....while I watched tv....I wish kitchen tasks were ALL that easy! (Lol)

AMAZING!!! These were a huge hit at thanksgiving among the kids and adults! My daughters (ages 4 & 3) made these the night before thanksgivings and we're thrilled to present their dessert to the family. Quick and easy to make. We had a few leftovers so I stored them in a Tupperware container and although the cookie got a little soft they were still yummy even after a week. A must make again!!! Thank you for such a great dessert!

So simple and so delicious! They are a little tedious at first but once you get a rhythm it's like an assembly line of treats. I had them sit out for about 40 minutes, covered them with plastic wrap and popped them in the fridge. The next day they were PERFECT for the office party. Though I must admit, I had a few in the car on my way there.

An excellent and fun way for a preschooler to review their shapes. The circle and triangle. We used Nutter Butter cookies and peanut butter in place of frosting. Fun filled with Mmmmmm. Learning is fun

Easy to make and super cute.  Use peanut butter or frosting to stick candy on.

I made this for a work Halloween luncheon.  Everyone thought they were the cutest little things ever and wanted to know exactly how to make them.  Several people were going to make them for Thanksgiving.  Thanks for sharing this super easy and super cute recipe!

This was a great and simple recipe, one that kids can easily participate in (although parents might want to put the butterscotch chips on since they are very tiny).  I brought them to Thanksgiving dinner at my Amish friend's house and everyone loved them, not only for their taste but because they were simply too cute!  If you can make Amish cooks rave over something, you know it's a keeper...

These are cute but I probably won't make them again unless they are making up part of a scene on the table. They were too labor intensive for the flavor.  Not that they were that hard to make but they weren't that good to eat.

Would definitely make these again.  They were a big hit.  A bit time-consuming to make because I used melted chocolate disks instead of frosting, but totally worth it.

These are really tasty but messy to make.  You have to eat them quickly too because the cookies will start to soften if leftover more than a day or so. Great kids recipe for fall.

So cute and so simple to make for a Halloween treat or anytime during the Fall season through Thanksgiving. I did use peanut butter chips in place of Butterscotch mainly for the reason that I already had them on hand, but also because they are less sweet than Butterscotch. Of course, peanut butter and chocolate do go so nicely together.

Made these with pumpkin flavored kisses, colored mini villas and a choc. chip on top.
Flavors went very well. Although this year I could not find the pumpkin flavored kisses, so I used the caramel flavored ones!

I made these and they were a hit. Very cute. I used cupcake frosting in the tube to "glue" the pieces together. WORKS really good! Peanut butter (as someone suggested) and regular frosting does not hold because it doesn't dry.
Next time I'll put a piece of walnut on the top instead of the butterscotch morsel. I think it will look better.
I also used the mini Nilla Waffers instead of the original size.

Needed something to take up to the hospital as a thank you to all the nurses caring for my mom. These were perfect and so easy. I did substitute chocolate PB2 (if you've never tried it, it's fabulous!!) peanut butter powder for the prepared icing and used peanut butter chips since that's all my store had at the time. The PB2 made it so easy to attach the kisses - I mixed it a little thicker than I would for normal peanut butter. So much fun to prepare!

SO easy to make. I did make a few changes; 1) I used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch. It was a much better flavor., and 2) instead of plain chocolate frosting (which can get super dry or super melty and thus the whole thing falls apart), I used royal icing (the tube kind that you can find in the grocery store). Just a small dab on each component and they held together very nicely (and didn't detract from the flavor).

Easy-peasy, tasty and adorable.

These were delicious! I'll definitely be making them again. The only problem was the cookie got super soft and soggy after awhile, since I used frosting to attach it to the kiss and chip. But overall, fabulous! Deserves 5 stars.

My grandchildren had a fun time putting these together.  They were not only cute, but tasted good too!  We used the Nutter Butter Minis which I thought made it look more authentic.  They were a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for whoever came up with this unique idea!

This is a good recipe as written.  We used nutter butter bites in place of the nilla wafers and peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch.  It was a hit with the kids and adults alike.

These were not only fun to make (my Down Syndrome son helped by unwrapping the kisses), they were cute to display. And the mixture of flavors was very very good. These will become a regular autumn treat.

These are easy, and very good.  I like butterscotch so I melted about 1/4 cup of butterscotch and used this to attach everything.  Very easy to turn nilla wafers upside down.  Dip bottom of kiss into melted chips and put on wafer.  Let set about 3 minutes.  Turn over and dip bottom of butterscotch chip into melted chips and put on top of wafer.  Let set about 3 minutes.  This makes them quit durable and you can even store them in zip lock bag for several days.  If you don't like much butterscotch, you can melt chocolate chips (or any flavor) instead.

I use a very large supermarket and could not get the cookies in a mini version.  Doesn't look as nice with the larger ones and there is no similar item that is smaller.  Still cute.

The frosting made the wafers soft- looks cool but not great if you don't serve right away.

These couldn't be any easier or cuter!  I used them to top some frosted brownies for a Halloween treat at my granddaughter's pre-school.  The kids loved them!  Thanks for sharing this, What's for dinner, mom?!

I used a simple sugar glue instead of frosting and opted for caramel Kisses. These are perfect gathered in a small gift bag for Thanksgiving or used to top a seasonal cake!

These were a big hit on Thanksgiving Day.Great recipe to do with the kids. My 5 year old daughter practically did the whole batch by herself. My son who's 2 tried but he was only interested in eating them. Thanks for sharing.

I made 3 dozen of these for a raffle at our synagogue's holiday bazaar, and people went CRAZY!  These are so simple to put together and look so pretty.  I made more a few days later with peanut butter chips, since I don't really like butterscotch, and they were even better. Next time I will try the dark chocolate kisses and dark chocolate morsels, yum!  Or mint chocolate chips would be good, or, well, the possibilities are endless.  Some people said they also look like dreydls, so I might try making mini sugar cookies and coloring the dough to make them more colorful, and use them for Chanukah.
