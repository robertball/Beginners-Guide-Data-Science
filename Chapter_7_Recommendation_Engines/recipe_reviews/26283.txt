Delicious combination that we have used in our household for years.  I substituted homemade sauce for jar sauce and used spicy chicken sausage to cut down on the fat.

This is a good recipe.  I used a pound of ground mild sausage because that is what I had on hand.  I only used a teaspoon of the basil because I ran out.  I think that was plenty.  More than that would be overwhelming.  Next time I won't add as much parsley.  Other than that it was a great recipe that I will make again.  My one year old even liked it!

This pasta was great! We made it with italian turkey sausage to bring down the fat and calories even more and it was delicious! Will definately make again.

I make something like this once or twice a month, usually adding fresh peppers, fresh mushrooms and chopped sweet onion. Sauteing the vegetables with the garlic in EVOO really can make jarred sauce and tinned tomatoes pop. This dish never fails to disappear when I cook it, even with my little ones. Make sure you serve it with fresh parmesan!

Awesome. I used a pound of regular breakfast sausage because that's what I had. It was so good. I will definately make this again.

I made this based on my friend Nandabear's review and awesome photo, and I'm sure glad I did! What a wonderful dish and the best part is that it comes together so quickly.  I used sweet Italian sausage and more garlic than called for.  My hubby and I both really enjoyed this, so thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but I made a few changes to suit our taste. First, I used a full pound of Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage, browned it on the stovetop and then cut in diagonal slices. I recommend starting with maybe 1 tsp. of the crushed red pepper and adding more if you want more spice. I used 2 heaping tsp. of minced garlic and sauteed it in a pan with olive oil, a whole onion sliced very thin, and 2 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms (after removing the stems). Then I added it to the sauce ingredients and simmered for 45-60 minutes on the stove. I also added 1 tbsp. of cocoa powder to the sauce. It cut the bite out of the tomatoes and made the sauce a deep rich red/brown. I served it with a fresh salad and crusty bread. Yummy.

Sorry, this is nothing special.  Yes, it is easy but so is taking jarred pasta sauce and stewing italian sausage in it -- oh wait - that is basically what this recipe is.  It was not bad by any means.  Just mediocre.

Used mild Italian sausage with some sugar thrown in the sauce as well as fresh herbs and fresh mushrooms. Used a can of diced tomatoes with no additional seasonings but did add some diced frozen onion. Quick to pull together and yummy.

simple and easier meal to prepare. I used Walnut Acres Organic Sweet pepper and onion pasta sauce, and sausage meat rather than links.  Very tasty no nonsense meal.  Pretty sure I will be using this recipe again.  Ideal if you have limited time to prepare a meal.

My husband was craving pasta with sausage.  He did a search, found this and I made it that night. He loved it!  "The way to man's heart..."!

I made this for the first time about 4 months ago and still make it often. My family now prefers sausage with our pasta dishes over hamburger. I have found that regular rolls of sausage work well too--instead of links. I've made this with sage pork sausage and hot pork sausage, too. I always add a green pepper, chopped, a fresh onion, about half of the recommended basil, and just enough crushed red pepper for my family's liking. I love to use a jar of Ragu Sweet Basil and Sun-dried Tomato spaghetti sauce with this--compliments the other flavors wonderfully! I could go for a serving of this right now! :)

I made this for dinner last night and it was very good.  We usually eat spaghetti about once a week, so this was a nice alternative.  I used turkey sausage, added about 1 cup of chopped onion, and omitted the jar of mushrooms.  I did use two jars of spaghetti sauce with mushrooms.  I would definitely make this again.

I used all-natural breakfast sausages, 2 7oz. boxes, 1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 3 tablespoons of the Italian dressing mix of herbs that I make from this site.  I also substituted chopped, fresh zucchini instead of canned mushrooms.  So, though it wasn't quite the same recipe, it was so easy to adapt and it was so tasty, that it gets 4 stars.

Easy to make, great taste and very satisfying. I used more garlic, a generous amount of crushed pepper and  some fresh parsley. Just about a 4 1/2 star recipe I think. Thank you for sharing it.

Very fast and easy, and a big hit with my wife and both kids (6 and 11)! My younger is dairy-allergic, and this is a good recipe for that because you can just add the parmesian cheese at the table to each person's own portion. I ommited the pepper flakes, since the sausage and the premade sauce provided some spice and the kids don't like spicy food.

Not bad but I like to leave the sausage in links and cook a little longer in the sauce after grilling and draining off the fat.  I never heard the word 'sauccia' in Italian but I know sausage translates...."salsiccia"
