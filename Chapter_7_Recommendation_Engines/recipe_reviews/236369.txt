This was really good!  I grew eggplant in my garden this year.  Hubby isn't fond of eggplant, but said he would eat it if I added some meat.  So, I saut√©ed onion and green peppers from our garden with some ground turkey and added it to the sauce layer. I also used herbed breadcrumbs (also from our garden)to bread the eggplant.  Turned out way better than I had imagined, and we will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe worked out perfectly, the best part was using Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs. We all loved the eggplant and were taking sample bites  as soon as it came out of the oven crispy.

I used Italian style Panko breadcrumbs and thought the taste & texture were very good vs regular breadcrumbs. I only used one eggplant to feed two of us - therefore reduced the egg/water by half (and still had too much - I think one egg w/ water would do).  I tried not to layer the slices, rather they were slightly offset on each other so a) they wouldn't get too soggy [and b) so each slice had a small amount of sauce & eventually mozzarella.  Served on spinach linguine with the remaining sauce. It was a big hit!

We liked this a lot. I could have used about 1-2 cups more spaghetti sauce. Otherwise, it was good and baking the eggplant was a real plus. I did have to use 2 cookie sheets.

Just made this tonight and I thought it was really good. I didn't have Panko bread crumbs so I used seasoned bread crumbs and added Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and some crushed red pepper to the mix. I halved the recipe since I was only feeding 3. I will be making this again!

This is an easy healthier alternative from fried eggplant.  It is tasty and delicious. I did add extra sauce to it because I was worried it would be dry.

If you're hesitant to try this recipe because baking eggplant takes longer than frying, remember the adage that good things come to those who wait. My family loves this recipe.

I made my own tomato sauce instead of using jarred sauce. Fantastic eggplant parm recipe. Will make again for sure. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a very nice way to make la parmigiana. I used homemade sauce. I also used cornmeal instead of bread crumbs. Definitely a keeper recipe. No need to fry anything. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome base recipe. My son who I can't get to eat a veggie to save his life loved it, and thought it was the best lasagna he's ever eaten (we won't tell him the eggplant part). I did make a few changes:

My recipe is very similar to this one but leave out the eggs and lightly spray the slices with olive oil and then dip in the seasoned bread crumbs. Its healthier and tastes just as good. I also use my own homemade tomato sauce. In a pinch I prefer Tuttorosso Sauce over Ragu.

Great way to make eggplant parm.  I cut recipe in half for two of us and only needed one egg.  Used homemade sauce I keep in the freezer. Also Italian shredded cheese vs plain mozzarella added more flavor.  Serve with a side of Italian sausage.  Yum!

I wish I could say we loved this recipe, but it was just...ok.  Next time I will try making my own breadcrumbs and add extra spices - it was just a bit bland for our taste.

Great recipe. This was my first attempt at Eggplant Parmesan and it turned out great. I only used 1 small eggplant and half bottle of sauce, and only made one layer. I also added sliced tomato on top of pre-cooked eggplant and cooked all together. Will definitely make again.

I added a bit more garlic and a touch of oregano and a bit of red wine to the sauce.
Of course I'll make it again and soon.

I made it but used the olive oil on the eggplant instead of the eggs.  It came out good.  Was a little leery because my husband doesn't like baked eggplant but he really liked it.  Would definitely make again.

My husband asked me to make egg plant parm and this seemed like a reasonably easy recipe. I currently have it in my oven, and this will be the second time this week I've made it, it's that good. Even the left overs are really good, and I had them 2 days in a row. I made it as written only I added a little bit of shredded Parmesan cheese in the breadcrumbs. It smells so good right now it's hard to have some self control!

This is a good one. I may have to put this in my rotation. I made my own sauce but followed the recipe. Don't think I would change anything.

This was really good. I used seasoned Panko bread crumbs for a crispier result and used Italian blend cheese. Can't wait to make it again.

I made a half a recipe and I guess my eggplant wasn't medium size.  I ended up needing more breadcrumbs, about 1 and a half cups.  I used panko with a couple of tablespoons of Italian seasonings mixed in.  After putting the sauce in the bottom of the pan, I placed 6 slices of breaded eggplant, a sprinkling of parm cheese and then spooned a bit of sauce over the top.  I repeated this two times (so I had 6 stacks of 3 eggplant slices each).  I covered and baked per the directions, adding the moz cheese.  It took closer to 2 hrs to prepare.  My eggplant didn't crisp up until 33 minutes into cooking.  That said, flavor and texture is fantastic!  We will definitely have again.

Really terrific.  At least as good as fried, and much easier and faster.

The no-fry baking technique was wonderful.  That said, I had about an egg left over (so next time, will only use 3 eggs and less water).  I also seasoned my breadcrumbs with oregano, garlic and grated Romano cheese, and I used two cups of mozzarella cheese.  It tasted great, and I will make this again.

my family doesn't like to fry things so I'm always looking for a baked variation of things. only used one eggplant but still had enough of everything to get the eggplant covered. served it with pasta and everyone loved it!

It was fabulous!  Used my own sauce, added spices to the breadcrumbs,but everything else worked great.  Was VERY easy, loved baking instead of frying.  My husband went back for seconds....and he doesn't even like eggplant.

Delicious, followed instructions except used two baking sheets, two baking dishes, and two jars of sauce. This way I could share with family or friends and bake later; which is awesome about this recipe. I also put sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to make it less dry. Way better than frying.
