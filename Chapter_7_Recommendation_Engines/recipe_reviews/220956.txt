Very good glaze! It's sweet and spicy, compliments ham wonderfully. I used it to fry the ham today, but I will definitely use this for a marinade for baked ham in the future

This glaze is indeed awesome!  Spicy with a hint of sweet tang.  I did not marinate overnight, I just brushed it on a ham steak and cooked it in a skillet.  Don't you dare use anything but real maple syrup!  Oh, and I used freshly minced garlic.

The glaze was easy and tasted great. Not your typical sweet glaze, more savory. I used crushed garlic and ginger pastes, rather than dried, and let the marinade sit for an hour before putting it on the ham. It also did not create the sticky burned mess in my pan,  the way a brown sugar glaze will do. Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is the best glaze ever! I thought that because it was so liquid that it wouldn't have a lot of flavor...but i was wrong.I basted ham through out cooking tine and the ham was moist & the flavor from the glaze was perfect...not to sweet like the glaze that comes with the hams- but just right.This will now a part of our christmas ham tradition every year-thank you for a great recipe.
