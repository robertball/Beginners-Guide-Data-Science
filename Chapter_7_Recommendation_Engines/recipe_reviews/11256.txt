These were very dry. Fell apart when I picked them up.

These were okay but somehow were just too sweet. I did have to mix the dough by hand as the very end. I also had to squeeze the dough tightly before forming the crescents. I had to let the cookies cool slightly before rolling in the sugar since they were just too hot to handle. Update: I have lowered my rating from 4 to 3 stars. After one day these cookies are nearly tasteless. They just need something for additional flavor but I'm not quite sure what. Possibly using almond extract instead of vanilla would help.
