Quick, easy and delicious. More "season" than "time" didn't permit me to use fresh tomatoes so I used whole stewed ones and just crushed them as they simmered. The red wine certainly adds some life to this. Definitely a keeper tomato sauce recipe. Thank you Cara for your recipe.

This recipe surely has potential, but if you use fresh tomatoes, be sure they are spot on ripe.  I'm in Michigan, and they are not quite all ripe yet.  The ones I had, I would have put on a sandwich, but they had to be doctored quite a bit for this sauce.  I love the idea of not have to wait hours, though, to have sauce.  I just used more sugar to tone down the sourness a bit, added some tomato paste because it is sweeter, upped the spices per the kitchen note, Italian sausage, because that's what my family likes, and ended up adding a little canned tomato sauce just to loosen it up, as my strained tomatoes were pretty thick.  Overall, love the recipe idea and using fresh ingredients.  Looking forward to summer and ripe tomatoes!
