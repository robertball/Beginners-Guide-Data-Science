Delicious!  I made it a bit healthier by omiting the chips, using applesauce instead of oil, replacing 2 c. of AP flour with Whole Wheat Flour, and using honey in place of sugar.  The flavor was excellent...very chocolatey and sweet.  Will make it again.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years and it's become a family favorite! I make it as written with the only exception being that I add the chocolate chips to the dry mix so they won't sink.  Great recipe!!!

Excellent as is! Family, co-workers, neighbors, and college students devoured it. Cinnamon sounds like a lot, but was just right. Using mini-chocolate chips, can be baked for 45 min. in five small loaf pans, frozen in quart sized freezer bags. Tastes great slightly warmed in microwave.

I made 24 muffins instead of two loaves and they baked up in 20 minutes.  I liked the recipe overall but I think it could use a little more cocoa powder in them next time.  Coat the chocolate chips with about 1TBPS of the dry mix before adding it to the batter and they will not sink.

I baked this in a Bundt Pan so it took less time like 45 minutes. I also dusted powdered sugar on top when it was cool and I took it to work.  Everyone loved it, it was all gone within 30 minutes.  This is a very moist and tasty dessert.

Very yummy. I made this with dark chocolate cocoa, 1.5 cups sugar, and a 1/2 c applesauce and a 1/2 c oil. I didn't even get to eat more than a piece or two, it was gone too fast!

Very good.  I decided to only add a quarter cup oil and subsituted the rest for apple sauce.  Turned out moist.  Also added two tablespoons cocoa powder.
Will make this again.

Made this into muffins using the large muffin tins. Baked for 20-23 minutes. Wow! My 90 year old grandmother thought they were the cat's pajamas and asked for the recipe (she's an avid baker still). Thanks for submitting this, Shanna!

Pretty good recipe to use as a base. I subbed a third of the flour with WW flour, 1/2 of the oil with my home canned unsweetened applesauce. I also made a combination of mini-muffins (12-14 minutes), regular muffins (14-16 minutes), and mini loaves (25-30 minutes). My whole family loves them :)

My son picked this recipe out to make. He loves anything chocolate and he loves this bread. I personally like more traditional zucchini bread but it was moist and had a good flavor to it. 

We made three changes to the recipe. Instead of 1 cup of oil we did ½ cup oil and ½ cup applesauce. We omitted the nuts since my son doesn’t like them. We also added the chocolate chips to the dry ingredients. 

My son says he would make this again!

Update: We now use all applesauce instead of oil. On one of the batches we put in strawberrys and then another one we put strawberrys and bananas. They were wonderful both ways.

I made this recipe using half applesauce and half vegetable oil, plus added extra cocoa powder. I made one loaf and used the rest of the batter for muffins (which I baked for 30 minutes). I liked the taste, but the muffins were a little dry. Maybe I cooked them a little too long?

I am only giving it three stars because it needs a bit of tweaking (IF you like your Zucchini bread moist) Otherwise the taste is fine. Not bad, rather good, but not making you say "wow"! that is good zucchini bread!  What I changed was I added Almond extract instead of Vanilla and doubled the cocoa powder.  I left out the Chocolate chips because I don't think Zucchini bread should have chocolate chips in it. I am glad I doubled the cocoa powder, it was perfect.
That is all I changed and it still is not very moist at all.  I like the flavor, but if anyone has any tips on how to make it more moist, I would be glad to hear it.

This is an incredible loaf. My sons saw me putting the shredded zuccnini in it and vowed they weren't going to eat any, until they tasted it. I took the second loaf to work to share with colleagues. That lasted about as long as it took to slice it. Definitely a keeper for me. The only thing I changed was that I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.

Awesome recipe and soooo moist! I doubled the batch and made 4 loaves at a time. To bake all 4 simultaneously you will need all 60 minutes of baking time.

Love this recipe.  I searched around and liked this one the best.  I used this recipe and it made about 6 of the mini loafs.    One word of caution, don't fill up to the top because it rises pretty high.  Defintely will make more.

I have been making zucchini bread for years. I love it, but my kids were never too crazy about it.
I decided to try this chocolate version, and it was a big hit! The kids didn't even know there was zucchini in it (and what they don't know won't hurt them).
It was so moist and delicious, it didn't last long in our house.
Definitely a keeper!

I have to give this one an A+!  I changed a couple of things to suit my taste.  First, I only added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Not to fond of cinnamon.  I did not add the walnuts or chocolate chips, but only because I didn't have the chocolate chips, and didn't feel like chopping up walnuts.  Lastly, I baked it in a bundt pan.  It took 55 minutes or a little more to cook completely.  Then I topped it with a chocolate glaze.  Very moist, very yummy!  A keeper!!!

This is a very moist and tasty chocolate bread. I made it to use up an overabundance of summer zucchini and put it in the freezer for when my family was no longer tired of baked zucchini goods :) It froze very well, and tasted great. I skipped the walnuts because my sister is allergic, and wasn't so sure about the chocolate chips, but added them anyways. I'd like to try this recipe again without the chips, or maybe with mini chips, because I didn't care for the big chunks. I know, I'm weird, even though I absolutely adore chocolate, I'm not a fan of big chocolate pieces in my bread. Other than that, this is a good, tasty bread that I will make again when I have to much zucchini around. Thanks for sharing!

With just a delicate hint of cinnamon, this tastes & smells of chocolate. The zucchini kept the loaf moist even after a few days.  I was not disappointed.

wow! I have never had so many people yell at me for making the best dang bread ever! I changed it a bit. I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used 1 cup of granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and stevia bleand. I omitted the nuts and used a hot cocoa mix. I also didnt measure the chocolate chips, I just dumped them in.  Cant have too much chocolate.  It was super yummy.  My new go to recipe.

This bread is fabulous!  It is now my son's favorite breakfast bread, although it is sweet enough that I sometimes make it as a dessert as well.  I've made it several times and people love it every time!

Excellent. I used whole wheat flour, replaced oil with applesauce, added mini chocolate chips, and 'shredded' the zucchini in a food processor (then pressed excess liquid out). Best I've had.

I made this bread to use up some of the zucchini our garden is producing and it turned out amazing! i used 4 smaller bread pans and cut the bake time almost in half and used applesauce instead of vegitable oil. This recipe is so popular, 4 of us have gone through almost the whole thing in about 3 days!

I made this bread with whole wheat flour and omitted the nuts- it is delicious and a great way to use up all this garden zucchini! I also baked in a well-sprayed Bundt pan for 45 min, let it sit on the stovetop about 30 min and then it slid right out of the pan, no fuss. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is wonderful.  I usually make this instead of regular zucchini bread.  It tastes great w/o the nuts too.  I've get requests from my family to make "that chocolate" bread.

DELICIOUS!!!  As for other bakers who say it is not moist enough....don't know what to say, because half a cup of oil in anything ought to be phenomenal.  Add your zucchini shreds, oh my.  Have been making this recipe for a few years now and everyone loves it.  If I have applesauce on hand, I will sub out some of the oil.

This is pretty darn good.  It's not overly chocolatety which is fine but it's also not overly moist and I added 1 cup of sour cream.  I did use 6 tbsp of cocoa instead of the chocolate asked for.  I will definitely make this again though.

This was great!  We used half oil/half applesauce and cut down the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups.  Then we added chocolate chips, raisins, and cranberries.  We made mini muffins out of the batter and sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  They were amazing!

Okay but not great.  I made it to recipe and it came out bland.  It's moist but it's kind of tasteless.  I don’t think I’ll make this again.

Great flavor, but was really dry. I had to add a lot of extra vegetable oil and it was still pretty crumbly. Maybe next time I will add an extra egg or less flour.

I have a zuchinni bread recipe that I've been making for years but this one was better by far.  I agree with the other review, throw out all of the old chocolate cake recipes!  I made this in a bundt pan and sprinkled with powdered sugar and it was fabulous.  I froze zuchinni from the garden so I'll be making this many more times.

While this recipe tasted ok, it was not really what I expected as far as I couldn't really taste the chocolate too much in it.  I personally love the combination of chocolate and cinnamon, but to me this needs more chocolate flavor.

This is the best bread I have ever made.  I have already made 3 batches.  I tried milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet.  Both are very good.  I will definately make this bread every summer when my zucchini is overflowing.

Both my family and my husband's coworkers loved this recipe.  My better half told me to throw out all my chocolate cake recipes and make this instead because it is so moist.  I halved the cinnamon because a full tablespoon seemed like a lot and I could still taste it just fine in the bread.

Excellent! And relatively healthy. I substituted 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 of the cups of white sugar. I really packed my two-cup measuring cup with the grated zucchini (took exactly two of them), so mine came out nice and moist.

I just baked this bread and it came out soft and moist and awesome! I made it with all-purpose gluten free flour with 2 tsp xantham gum to make it gluten-free. I did find that I had to increase the amount of cocoa. It should be 1/2 cup. Thank you!

Followed recipe exactly.  Good but more of a cake-like consistency.  I prefer a more moist zucchini bread.

As is, this recipe is just ok.  It's a little dry and could use more chocolate.  I made it again yesterday with a couple changes.  I reduced the flour to 2 1/2 cups, added 1/2 cup cocoa and 1 cup of sour cream (1/2 c. for each loaf).  Those changes made it super moist and chocolatey, 5 stars!

Like others, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I didn't add a full cup of chocolate chips or walnuts...maybe a 1/2 cup each.  I also used one cup of white flower, one cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of white whole wheat flour to make it healthier.  It tasted amazing!  My boys loved it and I will be making it again.

Hmmm.  I'll stick with "Mom's Zucchini Bread" on this site - which I think is precisely the same recipe, but minus the cocoa.  For some reason, the cocoa changes the consistency in a way that is just not great.

This batter enjoy up resmbling a thicker cake batter.  I ended up using an extra 1/4 c. of cocoa and an extra half cup of shredded zuchinni.  I ended up making muffins.  Depending on your muffin cup size, you need to bake @ 350 degrees fro 30-25 minutes  Used the full mount of oil and they came our super  moist,  I used canola oil.  I also used half again of the cinnamon.  High caloric value but super yummy.  Going to frost with hershey's frosting from this web site.    Fun to make. :)) Will definitely make agan.

My 8-yr old LOVES this!  We make it as muffins to make it easier for him for breakfast and snacks.  He loves to help me make it and then burn his tongue eating them as soon as they come out.  We use steamed and pureed zucchini and cut out the oil all together.

This bread was delicious!  I baked it in a pan of mini loaves and my kids ate 1 1/2 loaves as soon as they came out of the oven.  They don't normally eat zucchini so I will definitely make this again often to increase their vegetable intake.  I also took it home for our family Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe 3-4 times and it's always very popular! I substitute half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, and only add 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 2. I also use semisweet chips without milk in them, so it's dairy free. It's so moist and rich, no one ever believes me it's zucchini bread! :D

Good recipe!  The cocoa powder makes it easier to mix up.  It helped to add half the chocolate chips in after the batter was poured into the pan.

I've made this a couple of times.  Every time I make it - it gets rave reviews.  Especially from men.  My husband loves this bread.  I made a couple of loafs as gifts to relatives and neighbors.  My husband took 2 loafs to work.  His coworkers made a point to come over and rave that is was the best zucchini bread they ever had.  Even the FedEx driver ate a couple of slices.  The only thing I do different - is I just break the walnuts in half.

This recipe is a great use for an abundance of zucchini.  

It was easy to assemble and fool-proof.  I  ended up over cooking it slightly.  I used my convection oven, but didn't adjust the bake time - My mistake.  

Surprisingly, the over-cooking didn't negatively effect the end result.  The bread was moist (though crispy on the outside), chocolaty, and all-around delicious.

Wow, this was so amazing. I omitted the nuts for my kids - "nut-free" school environment.

I can't believe it is so good and so moist.  

This is a keeper and will be Christmas presents for teachers and friends.

Very good.  I had a big ol' zucchini so I doubled the recipe.  I used half applesauce for the oil and it worked very well.  This had a really good flavor with the chocolate chips and nuts.  Very moist as well.

We didn't really like the cinnamon in this recipe abd it was somewhat dry.  I altered the recipe by decreasing flour by 1/4 cup and used bitter sweet chocolate chips, which we liked much better.  Great use of a vegie!

I thought it was quite excellent. I omitted the walnuts and baked for an hour and 45 minutes. I think I will omit or cut back on the cinnamon next time. It wasn't a bad flavour, it just seemed out of place.

So tasty. I halved the recipe because I only had enough zucchini for one loaf (and only one loaf pan). Since 1 1/2 eggs is a pain to deal with, I did 2 and it worked. The only other thing I changed was using canola oil instead of vegetable, and I omitted the walnuts since I didn't have any. I think that this is more than fine without them. This is very delicious and disappearing fast!

This bread is delicious!  My husband and co-workers love it too, thanks for sharing!  I followed the directions as stated except that I accidentally added more chocolate chips (no one seemed to mind).

Great bread! Make sure you don't leave them in the pan too long after baking though, otherwise they get hard to take out of the pan.

My only change was to stir in raisins instead if chocolate chips.  The flavor is quite nice, but I would have preferred a more moist texture.  I baked mine 52 minutes at a slightly lower temperature.  It is hard to cut cleanly with no crumbles.  But the important thing is it does taste good.  Thank you, Shanna

I have made this recipe several times now, as written and varying it up for healthier versions, and it has come out delicious and moist every time.  After greasing the pan, I sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the bottom before I put the dough in, and it creates a crispy crust.

A friend brought this zucchini bread to a 4-H meeting last year. We liked it so much that when DD wanted to make zucchini muffins today, she used the same recipe. DD did add extra chocolate chips and left out the nuts. I tried one tonight, and I think the extra chocolate is a good idea. I can't wait to have some more for breakfast tomorrow!

This delightful chocolate filled bread doesn't stick around our house very long. I made two loaves yesterday and there is a half loaf left less than a day later. We have LOTS of zucchini every summer so I'm always looking for zuc recipes. This one is at the top of the list.

I've made this several times and it always turns out very moist. I do use 3 egg whites and 1 whole egg instead and 1/2 the oil with 1/2 fat free sour cream. I follow everything else and it turns out GREAT!. Thanx for the recipe.

we love this recipe, but I do make a couple changes. I used 1/3 cup egg whites & 2 eggs, 1 cup Applesauce, 1/2 cup EVOO, & 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. We got 24 full size & 36 mini muffins from the recipe. Baked regular cupcakes at 350 convection for 30 minutes.

I have made this for a few years now and I get so many compliments that I have to laugh now.  The only change I have made to this recipe is that I take out the nuts and my family thinks 1 cup of chocolate chips is never enough so we always add just a little more.

I modified my version here with 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 cup all purpose, used olive oil instead of veggie, evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar and dark chocolate chips!  WAS AMAZING!  The ladies at my work gobbled it right up.

This work really well as muffins.  I reduced the sugar by 1/2 C., added about 2 more Tblsp of cocoa and made the cup of zucchini very generous.  Baked for exactly 25 minutes and they were perfect!

Tried substituting pumpkin for the zucchini and forgot to mix in the chocolate chips. Put a few chips on top instead. Very nice chocolate flavor.

I made this with a few changes due to dietary restrictions. I used an additional 2 teaspoonsof Cinnamon, substituted Baking Splendafor the white sugar, added an additional tespoon of  vanilla extract and used Hershey's  sugar free chocolate chips. My family and friends did not notice the changes.

Family Favorite!  Each year I purposely grow a few zucchini a bit big so I can triple this recipe.  I then freeze some loaves - it freezes really well.  Too bad it's a scorcher today, because my hens laid eggs and I'm not afraid to use them!  Oh, use butter and flour to grease pans, I had sticking problems with Pam.  I know it's a pain, but do it anyway - you won't regret it.  Also substituted almonds they were cheaper up here.  You can also substitute sunflower seeds so I hear, but I've not tried that.  Enjoy.

Yum!! I did 6 tbl cocoa like others suggested 1/2c oil 1/2c apple sauce, used almonds( that's what I had( and no chips (just my preference. I baked in 4 mini bread loaf pans for 35 mins, probably would do 30mins next time. Was a little dry/tough on the outside. It's a keeper!

Wonderful recipe!  Tastes great with or without walnuts.  If you're short on time, make muffins out of them (less cooking time).  Great way to use up the bazillion pounds of zucchini our garden produced!

This was my first try with Zucchini bread.  My family loved it and asked for more.  I made a few of the alterations (I needed to use up some applesauce) suggested in the reviews and it still turned out very moist and delicious.  Thanks for the posting.

This bread is very good and I love chocolate!!  I used the 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce version, and I didn't put in nuts instead I used raisins and it turned out great.  Very moist and yummy. This one is a keeper!

This was excellent!  Definitely a dessert bread with all that chocolate in there.  I made it in a bundt pan to better fit the "dessert" label and sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  I made it as directed, except tried to make it healthier by using 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour.  Tasted fine to me.  I would have used mostly applesauce instead of oil too, but I was out of applesauce.  Next time I'll try it that way.  There will definitely be a next time! I am always looking for "healthier" desserts to bring to my child's preschool for birthdays and this one fits the bill perfectly.

GREAT recipe!  My kids loved the "brownie bread" as they called it! (Little did they know there WAS zucchini in there!)...I did decrease the amount of oil by using applesauce (1/4 cup and 1/2 cup applesauce) and it sure was MOIST and TASTY!  I also deleted the raisins and nuts...just a personal preference and added more chocolate chips! SUPER YUMMY!

Yum Yum! I doubled the recipe. Use buttermilk if you have it. I forgot the nuts but it was really good without. It was perfectly chocolate and moist. I used about 6 zucchini and squeezed the liquid out of only about half. I wasn't sure if I needed to or not but I don't think it is necessary. Even my dad liked it, although I didn't tell him it had zucchini in it. Don;t over do it on the cinnamon...exact amount or less. It can get a strong taste if you are not a big fan but mine was delicious!

I made two loaves for a women's breakfast and then a team meeting. Both were gone in nothing flat. I added a couple tablespoons of flour for high altitude baking (we are at 6300 ft) and the middle didn't fall.

Very good.  I followed JHUBB's suggestion of using 1 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil, and it came out great.  Was fantastic with my homemade strawberry jam.

Oh yes, this is very good. The few changes I made were: sub. 3/4 cup applesauce with 1/4 cup oil, 1 cup brown sugar with 1 cup white sugar, no cinnamon, and a little more than 2 cups zucchini. I also added the chocolate chips to the dry mix as suggested.

Good flavor but it is dry. I halved the recipe because I only had enough zucchini for one loaf. Since 1 1/2 eggs is a pain to deal with, I did 2 and it worked fine.  I also omitted the walnuts. I think this is fine without them. I think I will add some sour cream or buttermilk to see if that will make it moister. (Or keep looking for a better recipe.)

This recipe for zucchini bread is great. It's very simple and didn't take too long to make. I'm not sure if I like the combination of cinnamon and chocolate though, but husband thought it was great. I will definetly keep this recipe.

Good flavour.   I made mine into muffins and left them in too long (30 mins) so they were a touch dry.  I reduced the sugar and used 1 cup cane sugar and 1/2 cup coconut palm sugar.  I also decreased the flour by 1/2 cup and increased the cocoa (I think another review suggested that).  They won't last long.

Was my first time making zucchini bread. Followed the recipe and ended up with two moist, chocolatey loafs. Had to bake it for a bit longer to get to the done state, but that was the only issue. Great recipe!

Delicious. I made muffins instead of a loaf. With the mix I was able to make 16 large muffins. I also added a full bag of semi chocolate chips.

It's really moist. I substituted a gluten free flour mix 1:1 and it turned out great!  I just wish it was more choclate-y :)

I altered the recipe by using a gluten free flour mixture.  I then forgot to add the zucchini until the very end.  (I had to put the batter back into the mixer with the chocolate chips already added!)  With those charges, this still turned out to be great bread.  My gluten free friends loved the bread as well.  I’ll be making it again soon by following the recipe exactly using traditional flour for me and my non GF friends.

Oh my word this recipe was delicious! I made the recipe as written and was a bit skeptical but it had great review so I gave it a go. I had a bunch of zucchini  to use up, so why not. I did make muffins instead of loves just because they would be easier for the kids to grab and eat. The cook time was about half of what was stated. The muffins were moist and chocolaty and my whole family loved them. The only think I would change id maybe doubling the chocolate chips. I froze half the batch  for later the recipe made 28 muffins.

It tastes just amazing, but definitely needed more time in the oven compared to the recipe. I had to add an extra 18-20min bake time which after that the toothpick finally came out clean. But once I cooled & sliced the bread it actually turned out to be a little mushy still in the middle. A texture I would say looked similar to if I had mixed bread with pudding. Just not enough pudding that it’s soggy looking. I’m gonna to play around with the bake time some more. I want to figure out how much more time it still needs to cook after the additional 20min that I already added to the recipes max bake time. Also I might try using foil at some point in the baking time that way I can keep adding to the total time it’s in the oven while also trying to keep the top from becoming brittle & over cooked. Besides that

I chose this recipe because it’s nearly identical to the recipe I used to make regular zucchini bread, And I love that recipe. The chocolate bread however, when it comes out of the oven, there’s very little flavor. It almost makes you disappointed that you made it. My advice to you is to make it in the evening and let it rest until the next day. It needs time to rest to come to full flavor, and then, once you cut into it, it’s not going last more than a few hours. its amazing! I alter the recipe as I do with all recipes that require some type of cooking oil, I always use olive oil. And my oven cooks it in only 50 minutes. Be sure to check it early for doneness.

I like this bread a lot. The longer you wait to eat it, the better tasting it gets. Unfortunately or fortunately, it is so smells so good that we end up eating it right off the oven.

I was worried how it would turn out at 5,000 feet but I turned out great. Easy to make and flavorful. I love the combination of cinnamon and chocolate chips. I used mini chocolate chips and more like 1 1/2 cups of them. I didn’t have any regular size loaf pans so used my mini loaf pan that makes 4 loafs. Baked for 50 minutes. I’ll be making this again soon.

I did make a few of the alterations suggested by others to make it more healthy - doing half applesauce/half oil, replacing 1 cup of flour with whole wheat.  It mixed together well, had the expected taste and consistency, and baked up beautifully - I pulled the loaves out after 50 minutes because they were done.  It was fluffy, moist, and delicious, a big hit with my whole family!  I have no doubt that the original recipe would turn out just as well, as these are standard substitutions.  A few notes based on my experience of doing this and other similar breads.  First, make sure to press down/pack the shredded zucchini to get the full measure...a little extra even will be okay.  Second, make sure that the pans are well greased...if you miss a spot, there's a chance the bread will stick.  Finally, do not overcook!  Set your timer lower than what you would expect.  If you think it might be done (the material inside the cracks appears dry, it is starting to pull away from the sides, it smells done), check it and pull it.  If you overcook, it will likely end up dried out as well as having that "toasted chocolate" taste.

These were very good.  We did change the recipe solely to make a little more healthy.  Used 2 c. AP flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour, subbed applesauce for the oil, cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and the chocolate chips down to 1/2 c of mini chips.  My son really liked them.

I love this recipe it is easy and VERY yummy! :) It is a good way to use up the constant supply of zucchini in the garden! Instead of mixing the chocolate chips in I just sprinkled them on the top. I also used dark 60% chocolate chips (my favorite!).  If you love chocolate I am sure you will enjoy this recipe as well!

I made this today and changed it up a little . I am a celiac and wanted to make it Gluten Free. I substituted the flour for GF flour and added a teaspoon of xanthum gum. It was moist and absolutely delicious. We have so many zucchinis in our  garden, and I will definitely make it again!!

I made it with dark cocoa powder ( added about a tablespoon extra) and I puréed the zucchini!  I made them in muffins ( no paper cups, I just sprayed the muffin pans) so they baked about 18 to 20 minutes.  I got praise from all who tasted. This goes in the faves and will be made over and over again.
Yield 24 regular size muffins

I have used this recipe a couple of times now. One loaf is always sent to work with the hubby and it rarely lasts beyond 9am. I usually sub applesauce for the oil and find it makes for a nice and moist bread. This time I added a touch of nutmeg and added a streusel like toppping and the result was a yummy treat to add to the holiday cookie tray!

I used gluten free flour mix instead of regular flour, and then added about 1/2 tsp more baking soda and baking powder, and it turned out awesome! Moist and thick almost like a brownie, but with zucchini!

I made this in 3 mini loaves and one 8 x 4 loaf. Wonderful recipe. It's  a light treat. Great with a hot cup of coffee.  :)

Used half whole wheat & half white flour.  May add some sour cream next time to make it moister. Very good as is tho.

The chocolate chips didn't sink.  It was very tasty.  I only had about 1/2 cup of walnuts so that's all I used.  Otherwise I did not alter the recipe.  It took about 1hr and 5 min to cook through.  You could try this with pecans instead of walnuts.

I liked this recipe a lot. I am 13 years old and being a kid, I love sweet chocolate stuff. My siblings loved it, but my parents thought it a little to much on the chocolate side for  Zucchini bread. If you have a big group of kids then this is a great fall recipe!!!

Good way to use up zucchini plus it's chocolate! Followed one suggestion and increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup, then baked it in 24 cupcakes for 25 minutes per tray. Very chocolate and moist!

I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda. also 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup unsweetened applesauce. It turned out awesome. My grandkids had the first loaf gone in no time. They thought that I had made brownies. I let some choc chips melt on top of the second loaf. This is a recipe I will make again for sure. I omitted the nuts as grandkids don't like them. I didn't miss them at all.

Made as written. Had high hopes for this bread...it was tasty but dry.  I'm going to try the recipe one more time this season but I'll decrease the amount of flour next time and see if that increases the moistness of the loaf.

This was simple to throw together, and worth the effort. It's not a dark rich chocolate, but mild chocolate that goes well with the cinnamon . For some reason the only nuts in the house  were hazelnuts, and they gave it a slight Nutella like flavor, I highly recommend trying that substitution!

I made this recipe 3 times and changed it slightly each time to make it healthier.  I'm glad I did because I ate almost all of it myself.  (I made 4 mini loaves each time)

These are the substitutions I liked best:

All wheat flour (combinations of wheat, barley, almond etc)
1 c applesauce and 1/4 c canola oil
3 tsp vanilla
an extra 2-4 Tbs of cocoa 
1/2 c sugar

It was ok. I followed the most helpful review and did 2 cups whole wheat and used applesauce in lieu of oil (home canned applesauce so probably not the health benefit she had in mind bc we sweeten it.) I also omitted the nuts and chocolate chips bc I like neither in my breads. It will get eaten, but it isn't very chocolatey in my mind. Maybe that would be more noticeable without the heavier whole wheat flour?

We made 10 loaves (not even kidding) of this recipe this past weekend.  It's similar to the standard recipe we make from this site with the addition of the cocoa powder.  The kids inhaled it!  We will make this again and again.

Great recipe.  I made mini loafs and muffins with this recipe.  I only changed the baking time, to 20-22mins because of the smaller loaf pans.  Everything else I followed as written.  Moist, not to sweet, chocolatey, and delicious.  My kids loved them too!

I made this recipe exactly as described and I love, love, love it!!! My whole family (even the finicky ones) gobbled them up. I made muffins instead of bread and the batch yielded 24 muffins. Today when I got home from work, there were TWO muffins left out of the 24. Needless to say, this recipe is a huge hit. Thank you very much!

Major change required for it to move from dry(2) to wonderful(5). So I gave it a 4 with modifications.
 
Instead of 2 cups of grated zucchini, I used 4 based on other recipes for "moist chocolate zucchini bread" that I found on the web. It made all the difference. For those of you that are coming up with dry loaves, give this mod a try. Kids went from "blah" to "wow!"

It's a really good recipe! We love the chocolate cinnamon flavor.  Tastes awesome without nuts!  One time I didn't have chocolate chips, didn't make much difference as the cocoa powder made it plenty chocolate-y.

This recipe was good.  It wasn't what I was expecting as far as I wanted something that was more moist and cake like.  The batter on mine was very thick and I made muffins which only took 25 minutes to bake.  I am thinking I will try something to make it a bit more moist like like yogurt or less flour.  But with that said, they still had a very good flavor just a thicker consistency.  The kids liked them and couldn't even tell there was zucchini in it.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's my go to for zucchini bread now. This last time I added a simple cream cheese filling and I think it is a great addition to the recipe. Mix 1 egg, 4oz softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons flour. Pour half the batter in and spread layer of cream cheese filling in. Pour rest of batter over the top. Add about an extra 10 minutes baking time. It's awesome!

This recipe is perfect!! Make sure to follow the directions exactly and don't over bake. I baked mine for 50 min. Next time I will try mini chocolate chips in this, as the regular ones tend to fall out because of how moist the bread is. This recipe is a must try for all the zucchini and cinnamon lovers.

I substituted applesauce for some of the oil.  I did not have any chocolate chips, but I did have some Mexican hot chocolate disks.  So I ground those up and added it in addition to the cocoa power.  The bread ended up being pretty good.

I have made this recipe as is and loved it! I have also used 3-4 cups zucchini, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup honey, and 1/2 applesauce instead of oil. Still delicious!!!

This was fantastic!  Very moist and chocolaty with a nice kick of cinnamon!  I left out the nuts, only because I didn't have any, I will be more prepared next time!

Only 4 stars because I found some problems with the recipe.  Happy to admit that they may be mine.  Batter was too thick so I added 2 tablespoons of coffee from my morning cup.  Also I wanted to use Domino light sugar but was not sure about proportions so I didn't.  Has anyone tried this?  Made with half cup ww and full cup white.  My husband loves this.

Great option when you have lots of zucchini!  Try adding a little cayenne pepper (1/8 - 1/4 tsp.) for a little Mexican twist!

Very easy recipe and wonderful taste. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the bread is a little dry. I only baked it for 50 min, too.

A wonderful recipe and the cinnamon gives it a lushious taste. Out of the oven and just warm (couldn't wait) was just right. Was going to give a neighbor one of the loaves but bet it doesn't last very long.

This is decent enough, but I wasn't overly "wowed" by it. I can't quite put my finger on why though. Maybe I'm just not a baked goods sort of person. I misread the recipe and put in 1 teaspoon of bicarb soda. I'll put less next time as it had a slight bicarb soda taste to it.

This recipe was good, but I think it was lacking the actual zucchini taste. The chocolate over-powered the zucchini. Don't get me wrong....it still had great flavor, I just wish it would have been a good combo of both.

My children love this bread.  I've all ready made six loves.  The only thing I leave out are the nuts.
