This was a great recipe as a foundation and that is why I gave it 5 stars.  The changes I made were the following: I used diced tomatoes, an extra half pound of crab, I used jumbo lump crab and a one pound bag of Green Giant mixed vegetables instead of the individual carrots and corn.  I also did add a bit more of the Old Bay just because I love it SPICY!!!  ENJOY with a nice cold brew!!

I grew up in Baltimore and worked on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in a crab house for 4 years. This recipe is very close to what we served there. The Old Bay is essential and I doubled the amount because we like it spicy!

This is a great recipe! I did change it a little though. I added fresh steamed crablegs from the grocery store.. Gives it more of the crab taste.. I also axed the lima beans, but added green beans. I used canned veggies(corn, Green beans) and added white potatoes (peel them 1st). I used fresh celery and fresh carrots, And about 2 tablespoons more of old bay. WOW.. Was it good! Just let it cook about an hour to get the flavors going. But it was great!

The best and easiest crab soup recipe I've found.  I do use frozen mixed vegetables and add about a tablespoon more Old Bay, but that is personal preference.  Excellent soup!!

Fabulous recipe from a native Marylander!!  I made a few variations...used mixed veggies, an extra can of sweet corn, organic beef broth and added the crab meat with the rest of the ingredients.  I let it all simmer for about 25-30 minutes to allow the Old Bay to kick in! Would definitely make again!

This was the first soup recipe that I ever made from scratch. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I did make some changes to the recipe. I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, a can of vegetable brooth, one small chopped onion and 4 small cubed potatoes. On other people's recommendation I also used 2 tbsp's of Old Bay. This gave it quite a kick but it is GOOD.

Awesome.  I substituted a couple of things.  I sauteed green peppers and celery and added it to the soup.  I added 2 1/2 tablespoons of old bay.  I also used mixed vegs.  My daughter asked for more.

Not bad for a soup, but doesn't live up to the hype.  Tripled the Old Bay seasoning and still wish it had more flavor.

Very good, my family loved it.  They aren't big fans of lima beans so I will not add as many next time and ALOT more Old Bay!

I had just been to Baltimore and had Maryland Crab Soup and so I wanted to duplicate the recipe. This recipe seemed the closest.  (I gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star because of the changes I had to make.) In place of the veggies mentioned, I used a bag of frozen veggies (peas, corn, lima beans, string beans and carrots).  I also increased the Old Bay Seasoning to 2 1/2 tablespoons and added fresh ground pepper and salt.  I brought the soup to a slow boil, simmered it for two hours to cook the veggies and then added the crabmeat to simmer another half hour.  My husband loved it and said it tasted just like the 5-star restaurant's soup.

I was born and raised in St. Louis, I don't know how the Crab soup is from the East Coast. The recipe sounded awesome. I used 5 cans of crab meant. The cost of real crab meat scared me. I loved the base of the soup. The crab meat just did not seem to blend well.  I do not know if I will make this again.

Very easy and very good, I will definitely make this again, though I would add Tabasco or cayenne next time to make it a bit spicier.

The perfect weekday soup!  This took about 10 minutes to make with the following changes:  I used a 28 oz can diced tomaotes, used all beef stock instead of water/broth mix, and used about a 16oz bag and a half of frozen mixed veggies.  I used 2 1/2 tbsp. Old Bay, and added 3 6 oz can crab meat just before serving.  Takes me back to the Sand Bar on the boardwalk in Ocean City!!!

This was great!  This is exactly like the soup we enjoy when in Ocean City, MD.  Super easy to make, and great tasting!! (Especially with a little tabasco added!!)

This soup was fantastic! I am a Marylander, so ofcourse I had to double the Old Bay Seasoning because we like it spicy. I also bought 1 package of mixed veggies and used the whole bag rather than buy it separate. I will be making this again!

Added frozen mixed veggies and, my favorite, fresh okra for texture. Didn't even put in crab meat!  Can't wait until I can make this again.  Son said I was becoming a better cook!

Great Recipe!  Everyone really loved it!  Some of the changes I made to the soup to give it a heartier feel and more taste:  I eliminated the carrots and added in diced onions and cubed potatoes Added in 2 tbs of brown sugar and 2 1/2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup lemon juice - added in at the very end after I added in the crabs 3 1/2 tbs of Old Bay - more or less.  I love Old Bay so I didn't actually measure 1/2 regular sugar A whole bag of corn and lima beans   Super yummy!!
