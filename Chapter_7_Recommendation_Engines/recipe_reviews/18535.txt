This recipe is as wonderful as everyone proclaims.  I have been making it for several years, exactly as written.  To go the extra mile, after flipping the cake and letting it cool, try adding  home made cream cheese topping:  beat 1 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 t. vanilla; fold in 12 oz. Cool Whip and spread on top and sides of the cake.  You can't get any better than this!  
(In order to "flip" the cake, make sure you have lined the 9 X 13 pan with wax paper and sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray; Cool completely in pan, place large platter or cookie sheet on top of 9 X 13 pan and flip; carefully remove wax paper once cake is flipped. . .it really DOES work.)

This is a great recipe.  I only changed a few things - instead of yellow cake mix, I used a Cinnamon Swirl mix that I found; I used Pumpkin Pie Spice (instead of cinnamon and ground cloves) and walnuts instead of pecans.  This turned out great, was easy to do and made the house smell just great on a cold fall evening!  Good job, Jacki.

made this yesterday, very very good!!! i was not sure if i had to flip the cake over or not after it cooled? (the recipe did not mention to, but one review did) so i chose not to since i made it in my only cake pan w/lid. it served well right from the pan i baked it in, i just flipped each piece over as i served it onto a plate.so that the pumpkin pie filling then was on the top and the cake-nut crust was on the bottom. i used a non stick pan and sprayed a little non stick spray in it. even chilled it served fine.  i also used pumpkin pie spice and some extra ground cinnamon and sugar to taste.  great dessert!!!

This cake was FABULOUS!!  It's like pumpkin pie, but not in a pie crust, because the consistancy is very similar.  I saw this recipe on another website (with frosting recipe included), but that cake lacked the addition of any spices.  So I tried this one instead, with the only change being to reduce the sugar to 1 cup (as per that other recipe).  This cake is so much better if you let it cool for a couple of hours and then flip it onto a platter or cookie sheet, just like you would any other "upside down" cake.  That's because the cake mix/pecans/butter work better as a bottom crust, as opposed to them being the "topping."  This will also solve the problem mentioned by other reviewers; that the "topping" would get too hard after refrigeration.  It won't if you treat it as a bottom crust and flip the cake.  The pumpkin will keep that crust moist.  And this cake will firm up as it cools and will flip easily IF you lined your pan with waxed paper and coated it with cooking spray.  I also spray the pan before lining too, because it just helps to make the waxed paper stick and hold to the pan better.  See the review that's dated *Dec. 31, 2007* for great instructions.  That reviewer also included the ingredients for a tasty light frosting that's better then your standard whipped cream topping.  Mmm... so yummy!

1. Made this again for folks that have never had it and they were e-mailing for the recipe! 

2. Everyone loved this.  People were begging for the recipe.   I made the cake in disposable 13 x 9 containers and gave them away as Christmas presents.  

3.  Again this year (2008) people were begging me to bring it to the Christmas Potluck.

I just took this cake to an organization potluck - Wow, did I get the compliments, i.e.,
awesome, scrumptious, delicious, etc..  Of course, I got recipe requests which I
was prepared for with extra copies I'd printed after taking a small taste. I brought
fresh whipped cream as a topper.  I baked this in a glass 9x13 - I mention this
because I didn't hear the timer go off and got side tracked. It ended up baking
for 1 hr 40 mins..  The pecans were a bit over brown and the contents were firm.
But, it didn't seem to "damage" it at all. The only change I made to the recipe
was that I added a 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  It's going to be hard to top this for
future meetings!  Thanks Jacki for sharing this great recipe!!

I was not at all impressed with this dessert. I expected more from the reviews. Some sort of crust would have helped. The pumpkin portion wasn't as firm as I would have liked and the top portion (cake mix, nuts, and butter) wasn't appealing. I won't make it again.

I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the filling, as it tasted sweet enough to me while I was making it. You definitely want to let this cool for a couple of hours before you cut into it.  That gives it plenty of time to solidify.  Try adding a light dusting of brown sugar/cinnamon over the pecans before you pour the butter. So, so good!!!!! A definite keeper.

I have made this recipe 3 times, and have never heard such rave reviews.  I had several people at a gathering recently go crazy over this, and a couple who actually followed up with me days later to get the recipe. This is a keeper!!

This receipe was a big hit over Thanksgiving.  The pie is very rich, therefore cut in small slices.  Set aside optional carmel and whipped cream toppings for a nice final touch.

Good recipe!  I like to make a few changes to this.  First of all, I use 2 8 inch circle pans instead of a 9 x 13.  That way, I can do one without pecans for those who don't like nuts.  I add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and use 1 cup brown sugar plus 1/2 cup white sugar.  I invert the cakes onto nice serving plates, and pipe whipped cream onto the top - this helps to cover up the not-so-great looking pumpkin part.  Lastly, extra whipped cream on the side for those who like!

SOOO tasty! Everytime I make this, I have to plan on handing out the recipe.  Thank you very much for sharing :-) I must say, I did try and make it into individual loaves...it did not workout that well.  Since the recipe is super moist, it would not hold together all that well.  The wax paper tip did help however :)

Big fan of pumpkin and this was a great alternate recipe to an average pumpkin dish. I used Farmers Market Organic Pumpkin Pie Mix (two .15oz cans), 3 eggs, 2Tbs of ground cinnamon, 1Tbs ground nutmed, 1Tbs ground ginger and 12oz evaporated milk for the filling. In addition, I sprinkled Duncan Hines Moist Delux Yellow Cupcake mix and topped with cinnamon. This was baked on  9x13 glass pan in an electric oven at 350 degrees on middle rack for 45 minutes and it came out PERFECT! Edges and most of center was firm, the top was evenly cooked (evenly pour melted butter over cake mix before baking) and had a little crunch.  My husbands new favorite, thank you!

This is a Thanksgiving favorite at my house everyone raves about it. I like to add ginger snap cookie crumbs after putting the cake mix and butter on top it gives it a cookie crust that adds a little crunch. It is delicious!

Soooo good! I've been making this cake every thanksgiving for the past 10 years and everyone loves it!! I love this so much because I am not a big fan of traditional pie crust because it's always so dry and takes away from the taste of the filling, but with this recipe the crumb topping complements the pumpkin and gives it an extra sweetness that I just love!! I would have lots of complaints if this treat wasnt at our dessert table on thanksgiving!

My daughter made this when we went to visit, and everyone loved it. She put cool whip on top. Gonna pass this one on.....and if fact, next week...My sisters are coming for a visit. I am making this same recipe. Only I am gonna try someting different. Make it with Splenda instead of sugar and...Lite Cool Whip. So I can eat lots of it. My daughter DID tell me she added the cool whip on her own. It was the perfect touch. Also, she had left out cloves. But it was THE BEST. Gonna make it again Thanksgiving....

Made this the last two Thanksgivings. Everyone asks for the recipe. Just make sure you use parchment paper so you can flip it. I piped whipped cream on top. It looked as good as it tasted.

Now this isn't a pretty recipe, but once it reaches your mouth you won't mind.  We are all big fans of pumpkin pie and this just put's it over the top!  We like it best a little warm with a small scoop of vanilla icecream or a little cold cream on top.  Yummy, yummy, good!  Barb in BC Canada

All I can say is, "WOW".  If you like pumpkin pie, this is pumpkin Nervana.  It tastes like a pumpkin pie topped with a praline cookie crust.  I will be making this instead of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving for sure.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was well received, but mine was more pie than cake.  However, I loved the cake mix crust.  I mixed cinnamon chips in the pumpkin and used pumpkin pie spice and it was quite tasty.

I made this for Thanksgiving at a friends house, WHAT A HIT! I was asked for the recipe and complimented by everyone. I used the hint from the review dated Dec. 31, 2007 for lining the pan with waxpaper and for the frosting.

I'm sorry to say I didn't really like this cake.  I made it for Thanksgiving last year (2010), and others said they enjoyed it, but I wasn't really too fond of it.  The cake/pecan crust was awesome, but the pumpkin part tasted kind of bland...just a lightly sweetened version of pumpkin filling.  I probably won't make this again.  Sorry!

I liked this better after it was chilled in the fridge (as opposed to warm from the oven).

WOW. That's all there is to say...WOW!!! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!
I did not have a cake mix with the pudding in it, but it turned out just fine. 
I do have one question though...does this need to be refridgerated when it's done??

Unquestionably better than plain pumpkin pie. The taste of this "crust" is worth the calories! I used 1/2 tsp. salt (some recipes call for 1 tsp.) and added 1 tsp. ginger to make it taste like my favorite pumpkin pie. One-and-a-half cups sugar was what I used. I plan to increase next time the cinnamon to 3 tsp for more "oomph". The pecans--amazing!

Oh wow!  This is the best and easiest cake to make.  My two best friends were right away asking for the recipe!  Like others, I will definitely be making this for the holidays!  I can see how it would be good with ice cream too.

Loved It. I took it to work and there was none left after just an hour. I used a cinnamon swirl cake mix instead of the regular yellow cake. This cake tastes great chilled also. It really brings out the pumpkin flavor.

I couldn't find cake mix w/ pudding so I bought pudding separate and then sifted the cake mix and pudding together over the pumpkin mixture.  It was good but I think it would have been better if it had a whipped cream topping on it.

This is my first review ever, after several years of using this website. I made this for this past Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit! Everything about it was perfect and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except for one thing; I used a spice cake mix rather than yellow. I didn't line the pan with anything or even spray it with non-stick spray...and the cake came right out without a problem. Topping with whipped cream makes it even better!

Got rave reviews.  Even the kids under 4 liked it.  One tip, definitely use unsalted butter.  I only had salted on hand and the topping was too salty for my taste, even tho everyone else liked it.  Also, don't try to flip this cake like other upside down cakes.  The crunchy pecan topping is pretty in the pan and the pumpkin on the bottom is mushy.

my mother, who is the hardest sell I've ever met, loved this! actually ASKED me to make it. Instead of one 9 by 13, I made 10 individual portions in some deep dish pie dishes. It worked great, but the melted butter ran off a bit. Maybe will try just putting hard butter pieces all over the cake mix and let it melt down in the oven or something. Other than that, these are fabulous, and I'll make them again and again!!

I always love easy and this is definitely easy and tasty. Reminds me of pumpkin pie in every way, but easier.  My friend turned me on to this recipe.  It is VERY sweet though, I might experiment with another topping next time that's not quite so sweet. Maybe a biscuit topping?

Everyone who has tried this said it was fantastic - except for me.  I was hoping for more of a cake and less pie texture as I'm not a big fan of pie.  But, the topping was out of this world and I will use it again as a top for stewed apples and/or other fruit.  I'll say four stars instead of five because I was expecting more cake and less pie, but a big hit with everyone else who tried it. Edit:  I redid this with a can of apple pie filling, a can of (drained) diced pears and some craisins!  Delicious!!!

This past Thanksgiving I was looking for something a little more unusual than the standard pumpkin pie dessert. A friend told me about this recipe. Not only was it incredibly easy to make, but my family raved about it and asked me to make it again at Christmas and again in January for a family dinner. I would add to just give it enough time to thoroughly cool, otherwise it stays "soupy" but if you don't mind, it is great still slightly warm with ice cream if you can't wait for it to cool.

This was wonderful--easy and delicious.  My 9x13 glass dish was very full, but it settled a bit after taking from the oven.  The nuts were a bit dark after a full hour, but they tasted fine.

This tasted great, although it wasn't the most beautiful dish I've ever made...  Everyone thought it was meatloaf at first, but it all disappeared by the end of my party!!  I think that if I make it again, I'll put it in individual souffle dishes and adjust the cooking time.  Maybe it will be prettier that way!

I do not care for pie crust so this recipe has been a favorite of mine for years!  If you want to desert that will get your guests attention this is the one!  I find it is best after it has been in the fridge for a day topped with whipped cream!

Liked this recipe b/c it has twice the pumpkin as some of the others out there. Added 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Accidentally used chopped walnuts, but still good.

I just made a similar recipe from a low-calorie cookbook:  spices are 1-1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon and allspice, 3/4 cup of sugar (instead of 1-3/4), 6 egg whites or 3/4 cup liquid egg whites instead of whole eggs, and for liquid it calls for 1-1/2 cups fat-free milk plus 3/4 cup fat-free dry milk.  It also calls for a 9-oz cake mix (about 2 cups), 1/4 cup butter cut into the cake mix with 1/3 cup brown sugar.  Cut into 16 squares it is supposedly 188 calories per square.  It doesn't need a frosting.  I would add some ginger to the puree mix next time.  Will definitely make the lower-fat version again.

I am not a big pumpkin fan. I will eat it every now and then. We were having a pumpkin baking contest at work and I decided to enter. I thought this recipe sounded good and it had good reviews so I tried it.   It was very easy to make. I made it exactly like the recipe stated. I did line my pan with wax paper to try to keep it from sticking. When I flipped it one corner broke off. I just stuck it back on there and decided to enter it anyway.   Visually it wasn't that pretty. The contest had an appearance category and a taste category. I tied for first in the taste category...so thank you for this recipe. I really liked the taste, even though I don't really care a whole lot for pumpkin.

I am not a dessert person but this is the best dessert I have EVER tasted.  The consistency of the upside down crust is very delicious and it is now a family tradition to have this at our holiday meals.  The only substitution I make is that I use walnuts instead of pecans and I leave out the cloves.

Got a similar recipe off the top of an egg carton 20 years ago. I wasn't going to make it after all those years for the holidays, but my son called, the morning of the holiday, and said did you make your special pumpkin desert. Off I went to the store to get the supplies for it. Had it whipped up in no time and popped it in the oven. By the time we had it for desert it was just wonderful. Quite often it is almost gone before dinner. Most of the time I keep all the ingredients on hand for the holiday season. I omit the cloves is is just our preference. I have used margarine but butter is the best.

Made this recipe for some friends visiting for the day. It was fabulous. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups like some other reviewers mentioned. My friends took the recipe with them.

You can leave the pecans off if you like, and it makes more than nine servings.

This turned out SO GOOD!!! It turned out to be like a cobbler, which I love!
I did make a few changes to my taste. I added 3/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I also only added 1 1/2 C of sugar instead of the 1 3/4 C. Also I used walnuts istead of pecans. I also used fresh pumkin puree (about 3.5 cups). I cooked it in a metal cake pan and it needed an extra 15-20 min cooking time. 
This is my new favorite holiday dessert.

Amazing, amazing recipe! I will never make a pumpkin pie again! Made a double batch for a dessert night and everyone gave it a 10! I did make a few changes to the topping - instead of using 1 c. butter, I pulsed 1/2 + 2 T. butter into the cake mix with a food processor, then added about 1/3 c.  evaporated milk as well. I dropped the batter by spoonfuls onto the top of the cake before sprinkling with the pecans. Turned out even better than the 'regular' batch  and it was the first one devoured at the party! I also added 1 tsp. more cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. This will definitely be on the table for Thanksgiving!

Making the recipe was very easy, but I added larger amounts of the spices that the recipe called for and I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the pumpkin mixture. When making the topping, it was really difficult to evenly spread out the melted butter over the cake mix, so if there is one thing I would do differently, it would be to combine the melted butter and cake mix together before spreading it over the pumpkin mixture. Adding pecans to the cake mixture was definitely a good idea..it gave it a good crunch and flavor. I made this for my some of my college friends after having a big can of pumpkin left over from the holidays and they really enjoyed it!

The pumpkin part of this dessert was very good..used 2 cans of pure pumpkin since that is what I had on hand. However the crust was way too rich, and I only used one stick of butter, a cup would've been way too much. One of my guest could not even eat the crust, and even my sons said it was too rich. However some of my guest loved it and ate seconds. I don't think I'll make again, but would try the crust with a light butter if I did.

Excellent dessert to make and SUPER EASY! I made this and it turned out perfect. The whole house smelled like Thanksgiving and everybody loved it that ate it. I topped with whipped cream when serving. I will definitely save this recipe for future use. I omited the ground cloves only because I didn't have them and the cake still turned out wonderfully.

I made this at Thanksgiving and I will never make pumpkin pie again!  This was delicious.  I couldn't get yellow cake mix with pudding so used a yellow cake mix (butter recipe).  It came out great. Only problem is I couldn't stop eating the leftovers!  Great room temp or cold.

This was AWESOME!!  I'm not a big nut fan and i didn't have a 9x13, so I used two 8x8 pans and put pecans on one and not the other.  Even after eating a big thanksgiving meal, that wanted more of this!!  thanks.

This will definitely replace pumpking pie at Thanksgiving.

I did make two changes.  I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and cut the melted butter down to 1/2 cup.  It turned out great!

Almost too sweet, very rich-but good.  Easy to prepare. I served for friends who loved it, but the leftovers I threw out the next day.  Best to serve warm and fresh.

I orginally rated this recipe a few years ago and felt I needed to re-rate it with updated comments.  The only thing I do different from the original is to use 1/2 brown and white sugar.  This was the first recipe I made from allrecipies.com and it continues to be one of our favorites for the holidays.  My husband calls it "pumpkin surprise" and he looks forward to it every year.  :)

Wonderful variation from traditional pumpkin pie.  I don't like pumpkin pie and I LOVED this cake.  I did decrease the butter somewhat and couldn't tell anything was missing.  A definite keeper.  Would also be great with various pie fillings instead of pumpkin.

I have found this cake to be very rich so a little goes a long way.  Those who like it, love it and want the recipe.  It is quick and easy to make and certainly makes any event more festive.  It is good with Cool Whip or other whipped topping on it.

Delicious!  We had some people who didn't love pumpkin and they thought this was great.  It did gel up nicely and though it looked kind of awkward on top, it was great as soon as you delve in.  

As for changes, I added some dried cranberries between the pumpkin layer and the cake mix layer.  I used a sugar/stevia blend and things worked out just fine!

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of pie, it was wonderful. I lined the cake pan with wax paper as suggested and was able to flip the cake intact with no problem. For the topping I pulsed the soft butter with the cake mix then mixed in the toasted pecans.  My 9 year old wanted to decorate, so we used stiff whipped cream and wrote on the cake and put designs on it.  I got rave reviews and will make again.

This was just ok to me. Refridgerating it was a must do the mushy consistency which in turn made the top extremely hard. Doubt I will make again.

This has to be one of the most amazing fall desserts I have ever had!  My husband raved over it, and he doesn't generally care for pumpkin. I made a few alterations (I am not capable of following any recipe exactly!) and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, a buttercream cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix, and pecan "chips" (basically a pecan powder, they are so finally chopped).  I also found a pumpkin puree that included all the spices typically found in a pumpkin pie... I think that this really added to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again, it is just perfect served warmed or chilled.

This was okay.  Almost a must to stick it in fridge to preserve and then it gets rock hard on top.  Won't make again.

This dish is too good!  The only thing I changed was I added a little ginger & nutmeg (personal taste).  There's no way I could ever flip this out of the pan, but it's no big deal to me!  YUM!

This is wonderful.  However, I did have to bake it another 15 minutes, as the pumpkin filling was just too soggy, even though it was a bit warm still.  After the additional time, it firmed up nicely. But there is no WAY I could have turned this out of the pan, as one reviewer stated--she even said she frosted it with cream cheese frosting!  Given the Upside Down Pumpkin Cake's relatively soft consistency, this HAD to be another recipe she/he was talking about.

What a simple, delicious treat! The only change I will make next time is to add the traditional pumpkin pie spices that I like (cinammon, ginger and all spice).

This was way better than pumpkin pie! I used a cake mix with Splenda and the top crust was very hard so I am not sure if the cake mix was the reason. Still very tasty, though. Enjoyed by all!

I'm going to have to be the minority here but I did not care for this. The filling was just regular pumpkin pie, which was fine, but all you could taste in the crust was butter.  Will not make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and was told it was the best dessert on the table. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I prefer to eat it cold, but it was also good warmed up with ice cream. It is good for a pot luck because it makes a lot!

I personally do not eat pumkin(pie,cake). I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner last night and it was hit. I used only 1 1/2 cup of sugar and skipped the pecan and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  Send the recipe home with one friend so I have to print out another for next year's dinner.

I made this recipe yesterday to take to a Halloween party and there wasn't any left at the end of the party!  "Dump Cakes" are always a hit and easy to make.  I added a little ginger and nutmeg to the pumpkin mixture and I sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the cake before baking. Yum!

What an excellent recipe!!  I made this in a hurry for my husband to take along with him to a work meeting and apparently, it was a huge success!(Unless he's just saying so to make me feel better!!) By the end of the night he had quite a few requests for the recipe. I hadn't tried any so he made sure to bring me home a piece...and I must say, it is delicious!  It's a great spin on pumpkin pie!  
I followed the recipe to the tee except for adding a little extra cinnamon and ground cloves...this is definitely making it's place in my recipe box!

This is amazing! A weird cross between pumpkin pie and upside-down cake but a huge success all the same. When I made it for the holidays everyone cleaned their plates. Will make again.

This was a great recipe.  The only change I would make would be to add a little more cinnamon and sugar to the pumpking mixture.  Also, don't make the mistake I did-I only used half of the cake mix (because it covered the top)-and now I wish I had used it all!

I loved it!  my wife loved it!  my kids loved it!
despite being simply delicious (the nuts are optional), this would be a great way to stretch the pumpkin pie-esque dessert at a family thanksgiving gathering.
one note, cake mix companies have reduced the weight of their box mixes.  I used a 15.25 oz box and had great results.

Definitely agree that 2 cans of pumpkin is needed. I cut back on butter and sugar but if I make again definitely will cut back on cake mix. crust was too thick and not enough filling

I divided the sugar into 1 cup of white and  3/4 cup of  brown sugar and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and used pumpkin pie spice for the other spices. I make this every Thanksgiving. I love it and look forward to it every year. The only reason I don't make it more often is because my husband is not a big fan of pumpkin. Pumpkin pie used to be my favorite pie until I tasted this dessert. Now this is my all time favorite.

I didn't love this ... so sad because i thought it was going to be the best thing ever. The crumble was dry and not very tasty and there was no cake to speak of. I may try again with more butter and more cake mix to try to get cake AND crumble. But as written? Not a win for me. But the walnuts were delish!

I've made Pumpkin Upside down cake for many years and lost my hand written recipe. I searched AllRecipe and found this recipe. It's close, this version is alright but the filling is a bit too soft for my liking. Maybe reducing the sugar to 1 cup might do the trick. Either that or try the other recipe found on AllRecipe. One note, chopped pecans really makes the "crust". 
Also I have never turned the cake over like one previous reviewer did.  Personally I wouldn't recommend turning it over.

We made it twice. The first time with fresh pumpkin (water squeezed out) and walnuts then served with butter pecan ice cream. The second time with canned pumpkin puree and pecans. Both were good, but if we were to make it again, I would use fresh pumpkin with pecans on top (to be served with ice cream). The pecans and pumpkin combination is like having both kinds of pie at once, I loved it. But the canned pumpkin puree made the mixture grainy and not quite as tasty.
Overall, it's a wonderful recipe and we enjoyed bringing it to our family's thanksgiving dinner.

So good!  Instead of 1 c. melted butter, I used  3/4 c. and mixed it with a yellow cake mix and dropped by tsp. on top of the pumpkin mixture.  I'm allergic to nuts so I didn't add the pecans,  it turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again!

Too much sugar!  Bear in mind that the boxed cake mix already has sugar in it - then you're adding 1 3/4 cups more!!  I made this recipe, using only 1 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough, in my opinion.  Furthermore, we didn't care for the way the dessert was constructed.  The cake mix on top was ok, but we didn't like the bottom.  Left me wondering what would happen if you just mixed the whole thing in a mixer and then baked it.

My husband and children got into this cake before it was even cooled! They were raving about it and decided to topped it off with Cool Whip. Since I didn't have a yellow cake mix on hand, I used a spice cake mix instead. I thought it tasted wonderful, too! This would be a great recipe for potlucks and I'm happy I tried it out.

Following the guidance of other reviewers I only used 1c sugar instead of the 1 3/4 cups directed.    I picked this specific recipe as my sous chef is 3 years old.  The directions are super easy in that a 3 year old feels VERY HELPFUL.  The recipe calls for a 9x13 pan to be used.  If your cabinets look like mine there are three pans that are *about* 9x13.  I would recommend that if given the choice the smaller of the pans be used.  The reason behind this is that when the cake mix & butter is spread out over a larger area it can be dry in places.

I will definitely use this recipe again in the future and re-review.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is every bit   as delicious as other reviews have testified!!  Every year this is a "definite" for Thanksgiving dinner.  If I am going to indulge on any dessert over the holiday, it is definitely THIS one!!!  It's more delicious than pumpkin pie and a favorite of everyone in my household.  There is never a crumb left behind!!!  YUMMY!!

Instead of cloves I used nutmeg. Not a fan of cloves. And instead of yellow cake I used double fudge cake. It came out really tasty. Had the nuts all crushed and ready to go. But I forgot to sprinkle them on. Def will make it again!

I loved it but the topping was a bit too sweet, next time I'll omit the pudding mix. But it taste really good with vanilla ice cream. I used a golden butter cake mix instead of yellow, and I used all spice and cinnamon. I also used less sugar then the recipe called for.

OMG!  I make a lot of cakes, but this is by far the best I've ever made.  My husband said "i hope you make this once a week for the rest of our lives."  My nieces who are super picky were taking seconds.  It's a little odd when your making it, you think it will be too liquidy, but it really works out well.  I'd change nothing about it.

I was not happy with the flavor of this cake or the texture. I think the spices used left a lot to be desired. The pumpkin portion was too soft and pie-like. There was an unpleasant after taste. Won't be making this recipe again.

This turned out great. I used 2 15oz cans of pumpkin, 1 cup of brown sugar, tsp. with ginger, 3 tbsp cinnamon and tsp. nutmeg in the filling. I chopped pecans and cut cold butter into the cake mix. Served with vanilla ice cream, very good!

I was a little nervous about the pumpkin on the bottom, but after tasting it I had to say it was delish! Not that pretty, but as each day went by it got better!

I made this recipe for the past 3 yrs for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVES it. I add more pecans (2-3 CUPS) and it tastes like pumpkin/pecan pie=YUM. The only thing I am going to do different next time is maybe bake the pumpkin mixture for maybe 15-20 minutes then put the topping on and bake. I thought the pumpkin mixture needed to cook-firm up more without burning the topping. I'm wondering if I could use the topping for a apple crisp type dessert? Have to try it sometime.

Excellent. I also add a Cool Whip frosting (reg container cool whip, 8 oz cream cheese and 1 c. white sugar) after cooling. I have some people in my family who like it better without the frosting and some who like it with.

This is excellent.  I made a test run before Thanksgiving, and then made it again for Thanksgiving.  It smells fabulous cooking, and tastes even better.  The cake and nuts at the bottom is the best.  I've given this to about 30 people and everybody has loved it.  Better than pumpkin pie by a landslide.  Make sure you let it cool fully before flipping, and then smooth out the bumps with a rubber spatula.  Only possible complaint is that it isn't the prettiest thing in the world, but with whip cream on top you can't tell anyway.

I was a Little dissapointed with this recipe. I was expecting more of a cake. The top was sort-of pumkin pie and the bottom was WAY to sweet. I also had chunks of uncooked cake mix in the topping. Didnt like this overall. The pumkin part was good though, which is why im giving 3 stars.

I love pumpkin pie and I always wanted to try baking one.  This was super easy to make and very yummy!  I loved it!  Since the yellow cake mix is sweet and I love eating this with some ice cream, so I might put less sugar next time, but it’s just my personal preference and this pie is delicious as it is without changing anything.  Thank you for sharing!

This cake is absolutely fantastic! Everyone will love it! I used pumpkin pie spice with a little cinnamon; no cloves. I used walnuts. I will never make a pumpkin pie again. Make this if you want to impress everyone.

This was to die for!  Perfect warm with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream (or whipped cream).  It doesn't say to flip the cake in the recipe, so I didn't...I didn't change a thing!  It's my mom's favorite thing of mine.  She requests it at ALL family gatherings.

I originally wrote this recipe down in my car while listening to the KNX Food News Hour with Jackie Olden in the early 80's.  I made it and everyone loved it so much that I was chosen to make it every Thanksgiving after that, which I faithfully did until a few years ago when I somehow lost the recipe.  I've been sitting here for 2 hours searching for this recipe - not the first time I've tried to search for it, but finally came across the original recipe.  Yea!  I remembered most of the recipe from memory, but was a bit fuzzy on the filling (though I used a standard filling once when I first lost the original) and some of the quantities.  I am so glad that I can now go back to the REAL recipe, and you can bet that I won't lose it again.  In fact, it will be added to a cookbook we are putting together as a fundraiser for next year.  That way it will always be available, and the number of people who know about it will grow.  I think it should be the standard (and only) pumpkin pie made for the holidays.
Thank you,
Rick

It turned out fantastic.  Can't wait to make it again.  The toppping turned out great by spreading the butter out evenly over the top.  I think next time I will add 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to the pumpkin mixture.

Have made this cake(actually my 11yr old son)for the past two Thanksgivings and everyone loves it.  Even those who "don't like pumpkin".
