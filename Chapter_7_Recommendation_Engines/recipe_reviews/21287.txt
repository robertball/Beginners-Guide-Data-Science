Good for a low fat meal. I used fat free sour cream too, and then made up for it by sprinkling Monterey Jack Cheese over the top.  I say use the cheese!  My husband said it was a little rich.

Very Tasty. A definite thumbs up from my boys!  I doubled the recipe for my family and made a few changes/additions.  First I sautéed the onions and added about ½ cup each of mozza and cheddar to the crab/onion/sour cream mix. Then a sprinkle of cheese on top.  I also made this with 10 minute enchilada sauce found on this site and home-made whole wheat flour tortillas.

I sauteed the onion with a little green pepper to jazz it up.  I also added some queso fresco into the mixture and some on top too. Instead of using red enchilada sauce I used mild green chili enchilada sauce both on top and in the mixture.  This was fabulous and we all loved it.  Very good base recipe, I like to mix things up and it really worked well.

First of all, I forgot to microwave the filling, so they came out a little cooler than I would have liked. Also, the onions were too raw and would have benefited from some sauteing before being added to the mixture. But the flavor was pretty good for the finished product. Next time I'll try this with shredded cooked chicken.

I usually don't give bad reviews and I rarely throw away a whole pan of food I've just prepared…but we could not eat this.  The sauce was good and I would try it again with chicken…but the imitation crab was just too much.  Sorry.

This is a favorite in my house.  We make this at least twice a month.  I usually put a little less of the can of enchilada sauce in the crab meat mixture so I have more for pouring on top.  Yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly.  I give it a one star (nothing special) My eight year old gives it five stars. It needs something, maybe medium or hot sause.  Just not there. Will not make again.  --Changed my mind it is a zero star.  I tried to reheat the leftovers the next day.

Well. I thought these were delicious. I think the first thing is to actually like crab meat. 

Because I was cooking for just myself, I cut the recipe down considerably. Crab meat, chopped & flaked, chopped onion to suit me, a healthy dollop of sour cream & then Pace Salsa Verde. The consistency seemed to be what I wanted & so away I went.

I also gave it three shakes of ground cumin (Yum!).

I didn't run the tortillas through skim milk first - didn't really see the point in that extra step.

A little of the salsa verde on the bottom of the casserole dish, a little more on top of the enchiladas & then topped w/ a bit of grated Mexican cheese.

I find these to be strangely addictive. The flavors blended together very nicely & have just the right amount of spice.

Next time, I think I will saute the onions a bit - they are a little too crunchy for my tastes, even after microwaving.

An ok base recipe. After taking most of the suggestions listed, plus a few changes of my own it barely resmbled the original. I dont think this would be very good as is but is a decent starting place.

Yum! Yum! Yum! These are fantastic! I added a little jack and cheddar cheese to the inside and it was fantastic.  I've made them for everyone I know and now I get requests for them from all of my friends...YUM!

This has a lot of potential but in my opinion it lacked something. Perhaps some diced jalapeno and a sprinkling of cheese on the inside and top. I did garnish with cilantro.

I don't know what the negative reviews are talking about because I really enjoyed this recipe (and I'm not a real big crab fan)....I did, however, use green sauce because I don't like red an used two cans for extra sauce but prob would have been just as good with following the recipe exactly.  Oh, an I did sauté the onions before mixing and the microwave.  Yum!  Will def make again!  Enjoy

Very good.  I was trying to get by wih 8 oz of crabmeat and I had read another recipes that paired mushrooms with crab so I sauteed 4 oz. of mushrooms and added them to the filling.  I was also short of sour cream and added a little fat free mayo.  I used green enchilada sauce and they turned out great.  I'm glad someone else mentioned they used the green sauce or I might not have attempted to even make them.  I was pleasantly surprised by that they are so good without any cheese and that's great since my son i lactose intolerant.

This recipe is probably better if you follow it as is. I tried adding jalepeno and cilantro because I had them on hand.  It turned out to be too overpowering. I ended up picking out the cilantro after I tried it.  I also added a small can of mushrooms and that tasted great. I really like crabmeat, but I agree with others that chicken would be better.

I was not a fan. These probably would have been better with real crab but I found that even with less imitation crab that was called for, there was still way to much. Plus is was really, really messy.

It is very rich in flavor the crab meat really overpowers everything else. It was good, but I don't think I will make this again.

I folloed suggestions and added cheese, as well as cooking the onions before baking. Even with the modifications, my kids and I couldn't eat this. My husband was the only one who finished dinner. The imitation crab was just too strange in this dish.

Loved it and of the kids (three boys) two will gobble it up. The other is more fish phobic and will eat a half-portion. My husband, also not a huge fish fan, gobbles it up just fine as long as I put some cheese in there.  

Imitation crab meat is just plain white fish with some food coloring on it. Most of the time that I make this recipe I use tilapia (sp?) instead. I also add a half-cup of non-fat mozzarella to the interior mixture and use only a third of the enchilada sauce on the inside. If I want to add some kick, I add a few drops of hot sauce to the interior mixture. I use 2/3 of the can of sauce on the outside, and about ten minutes before done I sprinkle another half-cup of non-fat mozzarella or cheddar over the top.

To reheat leftovers, roll them up in tinfoil and place in oven or toaster oven for about 15 minutes at 350.

It's been a great addition to our healthier meals list.

Four and a half if I could.  Very good.  A lot depends on the enchilada sauce.  I think next time I will add more crab.  Definately give it a try

Very good!  I was afraid of the imitation crabmeat, but mom and dad loved it.  I also added shredded cheddar to it.  I used whole wheat tortillas.  I did not dip the tortillas in milk.

Very good recipe. I did not find it too rich, as other reviewers did. I used some lo-fat cheese in the crab meat mixture and also sprinkled some on top of them as they were cooking. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the "T". Great alternative to the crab cakes I usually make.

This was a very easy and tasty recipes.  I think the next time I make it I will saute the onion so that they are not so crunchy and potent.

I thought it was just okay.  A little too rich for me.  My husband really liked it though.  The kids HATED it, and they LOVE enchiladas.  I think it would've been better with less crab meat and using corn tortillas instead.  I probably won't make it again, although my husband wouldn't mind if I did.

Not impressive.  The crabmeat got lost in the sour cream and onion flavor, and the whole thing was pretty runny.
