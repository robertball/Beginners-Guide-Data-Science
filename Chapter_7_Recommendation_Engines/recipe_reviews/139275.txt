This recipe is wonderful.  I am allergic to wheat and milk and so I just addapted the buttermilk to rice milk with 1 T vinegar.  Most of the bread recipes that I have tried have turned out crumbly, but amazingly, this one is very nice and chewy.  This will defenantly go in my recipe book!  Like others have said, it needs to be about a total of 35 to 40 minutes cook time.

This was yummy. I love that you don't need zantham gum for this recipe. I was out of white rice flour so I substituted brown rice flour. Also, I had left over half-and-half so I added a tablespoon of vinegar to that and a little sour cream to make up the difference in the cup of buttermilk. This recipe did take 20 minutes less to bake but I don't think that is a negative. The outcome was delicious, it was bread! The brown rice gave it a fun darker color.

This recipe is fabulous.  It was easy to make and tastes awesome.  You wouldn't even know it was gluten free.  The only weird thing is that I took it out 20 minutes earlier than what the recipe called for because it was done.  I was also cooking cookies at the same time, but I don't think that would have made that much of a difference.

I had high hopes for this bread after reading the reviews.  In reality this bread is only so-so.  It has the texture and moisture content of cornbread, but the taste of plain white bread.  It would be fine for dipping in a soup, or making garlic toast from.  It is not the soft bread for making sandwiches so many of us long for.  Next I will try some of the other gluten-free bread recipes on this site.

Oh my gosh, guys: I'm eating bread.  You have no idea how excited and thrilled I am to actually.be.eating.bread!  This recipe was absurdly easy, and the ingredients are easy to find, as well, so it was also rather inexpensive to make.  I didn't have any buttermilk (or any kind of milk, for that matter -- I'm dairy intolerant as well as gluten), so I added 2 tbs vinegar to some water to equal a cup.  I also subbed out a half cup of rice flour for buckwheat flour and added ~2 tbs milled flaxseed (10g) and probably about ~1/4 c (10g) nutritional yeast to add some health to it.  It is light, airy, and delicious -- thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!  I almost cried. x)

Maybe it's the fact that I haven't eaten bread in several months but I thought this was delicious. It was sweet, moist and chewy. More like a yummy breakfast bread than a more traditional dry soda bread.   I substituted soy flour for the tapioca flour, and milk curdled with 1 TBS apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk.

Very good recipe!  I think it tastes a lot more like a cornbread style bread than soda bread, but still very, very tasty!

I was out of whit rice flour so I used brown, and plain yogurt for buttermilk (I use this substitution all the time).  I think next time I'll cut back the sugar to 1/3 or 1/4 c.,.

I used brown rice flour instead of white and buckwheat flour instead of tapioca. Also used a bread tin to get the loaf shape! Like many others, I reduced the cooking time by about 20 mins.  It is a nice, simple recipe and tastes good.  Best of all it is guilt free as I have a wheat intolerance - so thanks!

This is very, very good.  It's a little sweet, but that's okay with us.  The bake time is way off, though.  I have a convection oven which reduces the baking time, but it still took only 25 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My brother has a severe gluten allergy but we are very Irish and St. Patrick's Day is an actual familly holiday in our house. I made this for him because he always has to miss out on the good holiday stuff. It turned out very well and he devoured every inch of the entire loaf! It is lucky, however, that I checked it's progress a good 20-25 minutes before the recipe called for it to be done. It was almost OVERdone. So I would agree to cut cooking time by about 30 minutes. But do that and it should turn out great!

I have made this bread 2 times.  I took the advice to cut down the cooking time to 30 min. both times.  Both times the bottom was burnt, and top wasn't.  This is not a problem with my oven.  It had a strange taste, too.

Excellent, but way too sweet.  After reducing the sugar to one tablespoon, it was perfect for me.

I adore this bread! Tastes as good as any I've had in Ireland. I substitute brown rice syrup for sugar, and rice milk & apple cider vinegar for buttermilk. Best eaten fresh out of the oven, with stew or thick soup. This year I'm making it to use in stuffing for T-day. I predict it will be awesome.

this recipe is easy and comes out fine.  As far as other people's comments as to this not turning out like true soda bread, I really don't know anything about that, but the bread is delicious and sweet.

yum! I didn't have rice flour so I substituted 1/2 cup flaxseed flour + 1/2 cup plantain flour + 1/2 cup quinoa flour. I also substituted the buttermilk with almond milk and 1/2 tsp of vinegar, and omitted the baking powder and added another 1/2 tsp baking soda because I have a corn allergy. It came out amazing!! It's more of a corn bread texture but still delicious. Very good recipe, will try it with rice flour next time but it's good to know that really any flours work in it!

This was pretty tasty!  I did use a super fine rice flour and only baked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect!  Next time I might add in some raisins...Thanks for sharing!

I used brown rice flour and soy flour.  Also cut back the sugar to 1/4 Cup.  It was very good, but still very sweet.  Would be a great breakfast bread, maybe with some orange zest and dried cranberries.  I'm going to experiment with less sugar and the addition of herbs.  Maybe sun dried tomatoes. Bake time is definitely closer to 30 minutes.

Very good and easy! Added 1/2 cup currants that I plumped in hot water. Pat dry and whisk into dry ingredients before adding wet. Baking time is only @ 35-40 mins!  Do not bake for the 65 mins as recipe calls for or will be charcoal. Yummy!

I used 1 cup ground oatmeal, 1/2c. rice flour, 1/4 tapioca flour, and 1/4 cup finely ground flax seed for the flours.  I used no sugar, but instead used 1 tablesppon real maple syrup, 1 tblspn. honey, and 2 tablespoons milk whey.  I also added 1 teaspoon cardomen and a handful of raisens.  This turned out so nice.  Baked for about 35 minutes.  Nice brown color, great texture and gently flavored.

Great Recipe!  I found it a little sweet so would probably cut out a bit of sugar.  I also made it dairy free by using soured soy milk of eqaul quantity.  Turned out very well.  Thanks for the recipe!

For Gluten free Bread it is very good, the texture is more like cornbread and a little sweet but tastes great. We cooked it in a cast iron skillet and it only took 35 minutes. 

I have never heard of Irish Soda Bread being used as a sandwich bread.

This is nothing like Irish soda bread except for the color...mostly.  The consistency is gummy due to a large amount of tapioca flour in the mix.  The other reviewers were correct on the bake time...30 min is plenty.  If I wanted to try and fix this I would have to play around with the flour mix to reduce or eliminate the tapioca to get a reasonable consistency.  For you GF people out there...you don't need to settle for this kind of so-called bread.  Much much better exists.

I like this bread.  Very easy to make.  I have just started on a no gluten diet due to an allergy to wheat.  This was is my first try at backing gluten free.  I am also dairy free so I substituted almond milk and lemon for the butter milk.  I also melted some gluten free butter substitute and  poured   it over the top and sprinkled some gluten free oat bran on top.  I also sifted the flours, backing soda, and baking powder, and salt together, before adding the egg and "milk".  I hope it will toast up nice for breakfast with jelly. I will let you know. I think I will add some chopped walnuts, or some pumpkin seeds in it next time to add some more fiber.

Easy to make and it came out perfect.  Used a bread plan to shape as a loaf instead of a pie.  Bake time was only 35 minutes as people mentioned.  Only question I have as I only baked this for a friend who has to go gluten-free is why no raisins?  Are they bad?

This bread came out great. It is simple to make and holds together well, it is way too sweet I will reduce sugar next time I make it.

After making this a few months ago,  I decided to tweak a few ingredients and now it tastes MUCH better!  I substituted the white rice flour and tapioca flour with an all-purpose gluten-free flour (I use King Arthur Flour because it works the best in most of my gluten-free recipes); cut the sugar to 1/3 cup; cut the salt to 1/2 tsp; and added 1/2 cup of currants to the dry ingredients before adding the egg/buttermilk mixture.  There were no other changes to the other ingredients.  I baked it in a glass bread pan (greased with butter) at 400 deg F for 35 minutes.  The higher temperature gives the soda bread a slightly crispier browned topping, and cooked the loaf evenly throughout.  THIS version turned out pretty tasty!

I made this for my son- he loved it! Only used 2 Tbsp sugar and it was plenty sweet. Also baked for 45 min.

Despite an extra 1/2 hour of baking, the middle remained gooey...the bread seemed like it didn't rise sufficiently. It could be because I used Egg Replacer, but I've had good luck using it in the past with other recipes.

I also thought it was done in about 30 minutes--toothpick came out dry and golden brown, but inside it was still very sticky and hard to eat.  Am trying putting it back into the oven for more baking, but I don't know if it will work.  Will let you know.

I used barley flour for this recipe and it was excellent. My tastebuds are fairly sensitive to sodium though, and this recipe has a bit much salt for me. Next time I make it, I'll cut down on the salt. Otherwise: fabulous.

Tried this and was not impressed. Will try a different type of G.F. flour mix like fava bean next time and see if it improves. Seemed very rubbery.

This recipe was very dry once it cooled down. It needed some other kind of spice, I may have added sugar as well.

I made it today and it came out wonderful! Loved it! I only added a tablespoon of apple vinegar and about 1/4 cup crushed cashew. Fluffy and delicious! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

I was amazed that it didn't need any type of oil? Great!

I made this and as suggested, used 1/4 sugar, and cut baking time to about 40 minutes. I added orange zest - 2 tsp, coconut flakes, about 1/4 cup and handful of dried cranberries. I would have used raisins, but didn’t have any. I am not gluten intolerant, but wanted to impress a friend who is. I impressed myself. It is absolutely delicious.

Based on the reviews, I was really looking forward to a moist, delicious bread.  From a visual perspective, the bread looked beautiful. However, it was very dry and crumbly.

I halved the sugar, mixed in 1/4 cup melted butter right before putting it in the pan, and cooked it in a round metal cake pan for 45 minutes.  Delicious!

Sooo good! I used Pillsbury gluten free all purpose flower blend (with xanthan gum), and mixed 1 Tbs apple cider vinegar with milk in place of buttermilk. Also added 1 tsp cinnamon and cooked only 35 minutes. Turned out perfect. Will add to my favorites!

I cooked it in bread pans for 45 minutes and it is perfectly golden brown and not as tough! It's delicious with coffee or just with butter and jam! I LOVE this recipe! :-)

It's great, I'd give it five stars for tasty gluten free easy make bread however this recipe calls for way too much sugar. First time I made it with 1/2 cup it was way too sweet. I did 1/4 cup the second time and it was much better. Will put a little less the next time too. Super bread with less sugar!
