I made this on a whim to use up my zucchini  in the fridge.  This recipe is my new favourite for my B&B guests.  I didn't have yogurt so substituted sour cream. It was perfect.  I also drizzled a little lemon juice and icing sugar on top good with or without.  Great recipe

Big hit at our house.  When I got ready to make this, all I had was vanilla Greek yogurt, so I used that in place of the plain yogurt.  I made this in to 5 mini loaves (6" x 3 1/2")instead of 2 full size loaves and baked it for 35 minutes.  Great taste and texture.  This bread rose beautifully.

Substituted a few things to make it a bit healthier: used kefir (since dad is growing them so I had it on hand) instead of yogurt, and applesauce instead of oil.  It was delicious. I love the lemon flavor as well as the pistachios. Will definitely make this again.

I substituted milk for the yogurt.  This came out fine, rose well, was cooked in the middle, not burnt, but it tasted weird.  Odd flavor . . .

This was so delicious and moist. I followed the recipe exactly, which is very unlike me. After the first yummy bites I decided to take my leftover lemon juice and make a glaze. It really took this recipe over the top. I brought one of the loaves in to school to share with my classmates and they gobbled it all up, even the people who were wary of zucchini in their bread.

I won’t eat zucchini but I liked it in this bread. I used sour cream instead of  yogurt and cooked it in a bundt pan, like a cake. Moist, good flavor.

I made it exactly as it says to. It's not as sweet as banana bread, which is fine. The texture is really soft and it has a nice little hint of lemon to it. Very good!

Made this exactly as recipe states (except couldn't find any shelled Pistachios in any local store-UGH) but it didn't come out quite right. Cooked for 35 mins in full heated oven then took it out and the middle was very puffed up; very unlike the other breads I make that are similar to this (like regular zucchini bread) so I thought maybe it would correct itself when it cooled. Well it didn't! It completely sagged in the middle and then when I cut into it, I notified that the middle of bread of STILL raw/uncooked. I attempted to put it BACK in the oven for another 10mins at 350 but it didn't work. I'm convinced that I didn't cook it long enough the first time then it was too late (several hours had passed) when I tried to cook the middle. I was able to salvage the outer parts and they are delicious! Moist, good balance of tastes (not overpowering in the lemon taste) and the color AND aroma was very pretty. I going to try it again and see if I can change my outcomes next time :)

Very good flavor. The lemon /zucchini mix is very nice, and one can add other fruit nuts ect. I used 1/2 honey and 1/2 brown sugar, as well as 1/2 applesauce 1/2 grapeseed oil. the bread rises nicely. Using the convection option shortens the bakeing time considerably.

I will make again, with adjustments. Followed the recipe, but used smaller loaf pans + muffins to shorten the bake time. (Summer is too hot for a 60 min. bake.) It was moist, but I thought it tasted of too much baking soda, not enough lemon. If you have with jam, it's fine, but if you tend not to, it's bland.

I used sour cream instead of yogurt, as that’s what I had in the fridge. Very moist. The pistachios were kind of neutral for me, as I didn’t pick up much flavor. Interesting alternative to my usual zucchini recipe. I would add more lemon zest, as someone else suggested, for more lemon taste.

I used Meyer Lemons (adding more zest in 2nd batch) and sprinkled the crushed pistachios only on top of the muffins.  I also lightly sprinkled fine sugar after spraying the muffin pan.
I used sliced almonds for topping the muffins/bread in the 2nd batch, both ways work nicely.

Added lemon yogurt instead of plain.  Enhanced lemon flavour.  Also added cranberries, halved, not dried or sweetened, and it just added to the enjoyment.

This bread was a nice change from the traditional zucchini bread recipes.  The only change I made in the recipe was  the use of lemon Greek yogurt (that was what I had on hand). Also, my bake time was considerably longer  than 55 minutes.  The only change I will make for the next loaves (yes, this recipe is a keeper!) is  to add additional lemon zest and/or juice. I thought the lemon flavor could have been a little more pronounced.

I will definitely make this again.  My husband and I and my visiting friends all really enjoyed it, and a friend asked for the recipe.  My only change was that I used the vanilla yogurt that I had on hand instead of plain yogurt, and then I used a slight bit less vanilla extract because the yogurt was already vanilla flavored.  The lemon flavor was very mild, so next time, I may add lemon extract, possibly in place of some of the vanilla extract.  I didn't have pistachios so I didn't use them.  I may try them next time, but the recipe was very good without it too.

Made it just as it says with the exception that my yogurt was Greek FF and maybe a little less pistachios because they are so $$. Very nice. Lite and the lemon flavour is definitely there. I will make again!  Just made it a second time but instead of pistachios, I added blueberries! Very nice as well.

Liked because it was not overly sweet as some zucchini breads tend to be.  Easy to make one loaf.  Next time I will try with 1/2 whole wheat flour and maybe a tad more zucchini.

This is exactly what I was craving. I read the reviews and took a few tips, while incorporating a couple of my own changes. I reduced the flour to 3 cups and added 1/4 wheat germ and 1/4 cup ground flax seed; reduced the sugar to 1 cup; reduced oil to 1/4, added 3/4 unsweetened applesauce; I used Greek yogurt and I substituted the pecans for walnuts since that's what I had on hand. I needed to cook the loaf longer then suggested but that may have been due to my overfilling the pan. I also made  some muffins which took about 16 minutes to took. I will absolutely make this again - the whole family loves it!

This was a huge hit at my pre-Renaissance Festival tailgate! So much so, I was asked to make a whole batch for one particular person. :)

I only made one change, and that was to substitute walnuts for the pistachios, mostly because I refused to pay $9 for a bag of shelled pistachios.

My husband said, "that might be the best sweet bread I've ever had!"
   I think I will add just a bit more lemon zest the next time I make it.

I cut this recipe in half and made 4 mini loaves.  It was delicious.  The texture was light and fluffy and the flavors blended well together.  I served it to company and they all wanted the recipe!

I made this without pistachios but instead pecans and milk instead of yogurt simply because I didn't have either.  I personally did not like it.  I didn't like, it made my house smell weird, however, my family loved them, especially my 18 mo old.  I enjoy giving it to her for the zucchini.

This  is a great recipe! I bake all the time and deliver treats to my neighbors. Everyone loved this! 
I always change every recipe up a bit  but I didn't change anything on this one except that I used 1.5C of pistachios. 
I did a light powder sugar coating on top and served it with whipped cream.  It would also be great with a cream cheese frosting or glaze. Or sliced and grilled for breakfast.

Great was to use Summer zuchinni crop. Something different from traditional zuchinni bread. Kids loved it to. Have already emailed this recipe to several others to try. Will do again for sure.

I didn't have any pistachios, so I used crushed pecans and it came out great!  Would love to try it with the pistachios.

Very good! I did use more lemon juice. Next time I might try applesauce instead of oil. Delish!
