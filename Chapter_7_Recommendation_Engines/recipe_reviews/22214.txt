This was exactly what I was looking for: cheap, easy and simple. My kids thought it was very yummy. Like other readers I did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also added a half teaspoon vanilla after the 4 minutes of cooking, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, (because I used plain popcorn. I will definitely make this recipe again.

My older sister used to make this for us as kids.  Be sure to add a couple drops of food coloring to the syrup before you mix it with the popcorn.  The kids will love it.

This was so easy. It was a little on the sweet side. I would adjust that next time.

It's good. The only thing I did different was pop 4 quarts instead of 6, simply because it covers more of the popcorn. Next time I will add nuts.

It was very easy to make, and very tasty, but there were clumps that were too sugary. It was not easy to get the mix to coat the popcorn, so next time I think we'll have to try another method other than stirring.

I used a bag of extreme butter microwave popcorn, keeping the other ingredients the same. I used raw sugar & love the flavor it added. After I coated the popcorn I layed it out on a baking sheet sprayed w/ Pam & baked it @ 300 for 5 minutes, stirred & baked for another 5 minutes to crisp it up some. My hubby ate every last kernel!.

This was fantastic and quick!  I did add about 1/2 tsp vanilla to the sugar sauce.   I also popped regular popcorn and then buttered & salted it to try to approximate buttered microwave popcorn.  I then removed as many of the "old maids" I could find so we didn't go crunching down on them.  I found that by putting the popcorn in a LARGE bowl the sauce seemed pretty evenly distributed.

This was good, although I had trouble making it.  Everyone else said it was easy, so I must be doing something wrong.  There were clumps of the syrup that dried on some pieces making them hard.  This first time I made it, I dumped the whole bag of popcorn into the syrup - unpopped kernels and all!  DONT DO THIS!

My daughter says this tastes very good and it is easy to make.  She is 6 years old and this was her first recipe that she made all by herself.  She is quite proud of her creation and shared it with her younger brother, sister and dad.  Thumbs up all around!

My 3-yr-old twins loved this! I did 1/2 brown/white sugar; a splash of vanilla, and next time will add some food coloring. I spread plain air-popped popcorn on 2 silpats & just poured the sauce over the popcorn & mixed up on the mats. I didn't have a big enough bowl and it seemed to cover it pretty well. This one's a keeper!

It was hard to get an even coating over the popcorn, even in my biggest pot. I ended up with about 2/3 of the popcorn with coating and the other 1/3 plain. The flavor was super sweet and once it cooled, had an unpleasant texture in the mouth. My 3 year old and I only had few pieces before looking for a different snack.

This is great!  Thanks -- I have been looking for this recipe for a year!  The whole family loved it! It's not a sticky sort of popcorn treat and it's not quite like the hard-tack carmel corn.  It's a sugary crispy texture that really is addicting.  I agree that it is a little too sweet as written but we just added a lot more popcorn and it was perfect!  I think you could put 9 cups or maybe even more with one batch of the syrup. We  also used popcorn that's buttered & salted, and that makes a difference as well-- This recipe would be great with microwave popcorn. You can also put this over corn puffs (not the cereal -- the kind that are sold with the chips. They're like Cheetos without the cheese) and that makes a fun treat without all the choking hazards and hard pieces.

The taste was good but not super sweet. It was very watery and made the popcorn soggy. I may have not cooked it long enough, although I did the 4 minutes from hard boil. I have used many recipes like this one and have never had these results.

Easy snack. I used both brown and white sugar,like others suggested, and popped into oven for 5-10 minutes. I doubled the recipe, but it was still devoured in two days.

I made 3 bags of microwave popcorn.

I put the following ingredients in a microwave safe bowl:
3 (1/4) cups of water, 4 tablespoons of butter, 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup of white cornsyrup, and a handful of chopped walnuts.

Microwave for 3 minutes at a time, remove  & stir. Do this till mixture boils. (About 3 times).

Put popcorn in very large bowl. Pour mixture over popcorn & mix well with a rubber spatula.

Fast, easy, delicious!  Hardest part is cleaning the pan!  This does not need to be baked at all, it crisps up on it's own.  I used one whole bag of movie theater butter popcorn, about 8 cups, I recommend picking out all the seeds before coating so you don't have to pick them out later when the stuff is hardened and stuck together!  Next time I may add peanuts to this great caramel corn!

I thought this was a pretty good base recipe.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and added 3/4 tsp of salt.  I did also use more than 6 cups of popcorn.

The recipe is a perfect guide! I did what others did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 plain ol'white sugar and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to kick it up a notch. For those of you using the microwave popcorn I'd use 2 bags so coverage is not too thick...this recipe is SWEET...but to each his own. Also, def bake for 10-15min at 300 degrees. Makes a huge difference in the "crunch" quality. Made it for my daughters party and it was a HIT!

My mother made this every yr. @ Christmas- Red & Green.  Thanks for giving me the proportions that no one in my family remembered.  For the person who couldn't get the temp right-it's 4 minutes after it comes to a boil-soft ball if you put it in cold water.  Hope you try it again.  It's great!

I only gave 4 stars because I had to add more to cover all popcorn. I used a regular size bag of popcorn, 3 tbs butter then added 3/8 cup of water (1/4 plus half of a 1/4).  It was then perfect! had enough to coat it all!

The flavor of this popcorn (using Splenda) was really nice, but I think I made an error in mixing the syrup and popcorn. I scooped the popcorn into the pot a little bit at a time which resulted in some very soggy pieces while others didn't get any coating at all. Next time I'll pour it all into a larger bowl to cook.

Didn't really care for this.  I used half white and half brown sugar.  I wasn't sure if you were supposed to stir it while it was cooking so I did stir because I was afraid it would burn.  The sugar syrup made the popcorn kind of soft.  I perfer it to be crunchy.  Maybe baking it like you do caramel corn would make it better?

This is very similar to what my dad made.  We did it in the microwave in a large coffee mug.  Cook it about 3 minutes, after the 1st minute stir it every 20 second or less so it dosen't boil over.  Instead of pouring the popcorn into the mixture we spooned it over the popcorn in a large bowl and stirred it after every 5 or so spoonfulls so it was evenly coated.

My popcorn looked really pretty and this was really cheap to make..... thats the only positive things I can say about this recipe.  I made this as written but added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  This way too sweet.... it was like eating nothing but sugar. I am going to try to make this one more time as its a cheap cute treat for my daughter's classmates. I am going to try to make this again today but I am going to use brown sugar and drizzle the syrup on the popcorn. I will post a follow up.

Oh, my, wasn't this just delicious.  Very few ingredients needed, I made it just as stated and it turned out terrifically.  I'll definitely add vanilla and brown sugar next time as previous reviewers have suggested.  But it's great made just as it is.  Mmm-MMM.  Thanks for the recipe.  :D

This is great when you are wanting something sweet.  My kids and I loved it!  It will definately be something we make again!  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of just 1 cup of white sugar.

Absolutely magnificent!! My mother loved them. I popped a half a cup of white popcorn kernels over the stove (I never use microwave typw anymore!) and instead of white sugar, I used about 3/4 light brown sugar and 1/4 dark brown sugar. SO TASTY!! I made them yesterday and am making them again today with pecans and walnuts!! 

This is a great recipe to really try and make your own! Don't be afraid to try some new twists with this recipe!

Ok warm for a quick sugar fix. I added about 1/4 tsp of Mexican vanillia for some extra flavor.

This recipe was very good compared to the usual popcorn which can sometimes be bland. I would have given it five stars but their was way too much sugar, i would consider scaling the sugar down to half. It wasn't as sugary when it was warm still but after it cooled down it was too much sugar. I used exactly six cups and their was too much liquid, so i added six more cups and it mixed nicely, the only problem was that it still was too sugary. Be fare warned, good treat, very sugary.

It's granular, for some reason.  Not sure why.  I did half and half of white and brown sugar. But it tastes good and was easy.  Will try again.

I followed the recipe mostly. I did follow the suggestion of others to add a lil vanilla. Also I popped a 1/4 cup of kernels. The kernels weren't coated enough to my liking, so I did a second batch of the topping. And poured OVER the popcorn. Much better... Delish!

Super Easy and the my little ones loved it.  Add the food coloring while it is boiling.  It cools super fast on just wax paper on the counter for munching. Great for Christmas.

This was amazing! The funny thing is that I dyed it green, so that it looked all slimy. L.O.L.     It tasted very yummy by the way
