I don't usually like to use cream of anything soups anymore but made an exception here. This was easy and very good!  After layering the cauliflower, I mixed the green onion and lots of seasonings of choice, so he would eat a veggie!  Soup, cheeses, 2 hours on high was just right. Crumbled bacon at serving. He said it tasted like mac n cheese!  I will make this again, thank you.

Not enough flavour. Was bland. Could add spices would help.

Absolutely delicious. Made it with pork chops and it’s become our new favorite meal. So easy I’ll be making this often.

My daughters LOVED this! I served it with chicken and green beans and I’ll definitely make it again. I did use frozen cauliflower florets and it turned out great. Thanks for a different veggie  side dish!!

I love cauliflower and this recipe just made it even better, the only thing I changed was I didn't add the bacon.

Delicious and easy. Saved a little time by substituted 2 bags of frozen steamable cauliflower and a couple table spoons of packaged real bacon bits.

I'm glad the cook's note told me how to thicken it because I found it a bit too runny. Once I did that it was delicious.
