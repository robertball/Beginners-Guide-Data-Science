I realized I didn't elaborate on something I should have - when I said cover with foil I meant completely seal a top piece of foil to the edges to create an airlock, and don't open it til it's finished, or very close to done.  This seal makes the potatoes cook to perfection (thank you mom for that tip).  We also get a very spicy polish sausage, and sometimes add Old Bay or Seasoning salt versus the lemon pepper.  It's just one of those wholesome filling meals you don't have to mess with on busy weeknights. ;)  Cheers - Cat

This was a definite hit in my house!!  I used regular keilbasa & beef smoked sausage (1 of each).  I also used frozen has brown potatoes to save time.  Great recipe!!

I changed up this recipe quite a bit. First of all I omitted the potatoes because when I first tried this recipe I didn't think they were cooked enough when the dish was done. I use a large bag of frozen mixed vegetables, then added a head of broccoli cut into florets. Then for more flavor I added a half a pkg. of Lipton '"recipe Secrets" vegetable flavor.I added the sliced Polish sausage,I then baked it covered tightly for 50 min. Then opened it up and added a cup of sharp shredded chedder cheese. Put back in oven until cheese melted. Great!!

There was nothing offensive about this recipe, but it wasn't spectacular.  I diced the potatoes really small, and they were still hard after cooking the entire time dictated.  I even had to boil it for awhile before the potatoes were edible.  Maybe it was my potatoes.  I might try it again because it was pretty easy and tasted fine, but I'll be sure to cook potatoes first.

My family loved this recipe.  It tasted even better reheated two days after.  The one thing I would change is the amount of butter - next time I will add a quarter the amount the recipe calls for if at all.  There should be enough grease in the sausage to compensate.

Very tasty! Since my husband and I both have to watch our cholesteral, I used a low fat smoked sausage, and cut the butter to 3 TBS and uesd low fat cheddar and it was still a wonderful combination. Will definately add to my recipe collection and make again. Thanks, Cat!

This is delicious! Like other readers, I used turkey sausage (I like Hillshire Smoked Turkey Sausage, it's peppery) and a bag of frozen spring vegetables (peppers, squash, asparagus, etc).  My DH and I love onions, so I went ahead and browned the turkey sausage and onions in a skillet first. I diced 4 small red potatoes, only used 2 tbsp butter and sprinkled Mrs Dash on top. Didn't have any cheddar cheese, but had about 1 cup of colby/jack.  Thank you for a great dinner recipe!!

This was an excellent recipe!!  Of course I didn't have the listed ingredients at hand - no frozen mixed veggies, but I made do with what I had.  I used some frozen broccoli, frozen peas, leftover lima beans, chopped fresh baby carrots, sliced roasted red peppers, and 4 unpeeled red potatoes.  Sprayed the 9 x 12 pan with Pam olive oil, used no butter, and sprinkled seasoned salt, basil and fresh pepper.  Topped with shredded fiesta cheese when it was done baking.  Delicious!!  Thanks Cat for the recipe!!

We made this last night and found it enjoyable with the following changes:

1. 16 ounce veggies instead of 10
2. Red potatoes sliced thinly
3. Omitted butter 

We put all the ingredients plus a can of cheese soup on the stove top for about 15 minutes to help them mingle. Then into the casserole dish for the prescribed time. 

When it was done I removed the foil, added two handfuls of cheese and put back in the oven on warm for about ten more minutes uncovered. I thought it was great! My husband said it was good but needed more sausage next time.

This recipe inspired me to make the following changes, which all turned out great!  Instead of frozen vegetables, I chopped fresh carrots, parsnips, onion and green beans.  I added a few more potatoes than is called for, and increased the butter accordingly.  I drizzled some olive oil before baking.  I also kept in for an additional 10 minutes to get the veggies a bit more done.  We don't like them aldente.  Very easy, even with all this prep!

This recipe was excellent!!!!  My husband, who is not a big Kielbasa fan, loved this meal.  Everything blends together nicely.  However, I think that next time I will use fresh vegetables, instead of frozen.  Thanks for posting it.

Awesome! I used a little less butter, and should have used even less, but it's delicious and easy, just have to wait for it. I did cover it tightly with foil, yet it still needed more than 50min for the potatoes to cook. I cubed them (out of habit) and thought they'd definitely cook in that time at that temp but they needed another 15min. I might try slicing them thin next time - and I added a little Old Bay on top too as recommended by the recipe submitter in her review, we liked that additional flavor as well. Oh and of course I added garlic :)

I liked the frozen veggies with this!! I added parsley to the top when it was done baking. Very good and simple weeknight dinner. I did a combo of butter and olive oil. Will make this again thanks!!

I was skeptical it would turn out well without some kind of sauce, but with the butter and juices from the Polish sausage it was very moist.  The taste was great and it couldn't be easier.  It was a hit with our whole family, even the kids.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy to make. I melted the butter and then poured it on and then I sprinkled some garlic and onion powder in addition to the old bay seasoning. for my veggies i used corn and broccoli. I didn't have much cheddar cheese, so i used left over mozzarella! Next time I'll use a leaner sausage to cut out the fat. A keeper!! :)

I made my own version of this on the stovetop.  I used diced onion, garlic and hash brown potatoes that I had on hand. I also used Old Bay seasoning instead of lemon pepper.  I added one prepared package of cheddar cheese sauce (cheddar cheese soup could also be used) and mixed it all together.  Not the most appetizing to look at, but tasted delicious!!

This was a really good recipe.  Based on other users feedback of the potatoes not being done, I parboiled my potatoes for about 10 minutes prior to combining with everything else to bake.  I also skimped a bit on the butter and used light polska kielbasa. One thing my family loves is parmesan cheese...so I sprinkled some on top along with shredded mozzarella and cheddar and let melt in the oven prior to serving.  This was soooo good.

This was very good and easy to put together. I used red potatoes and frozen peas and carrots. I threw in some sautéed onion, red, and green pepper because I thought the peas and carrots weren't enough. I omitted the butter at the suggestion of other reviewers, but I think some butter or oil may have moistened up the potatoes a little. Instead of lemon pepper, I used garlic salt and pepper. I used lowfat kielbasa, and this was still very flavorful. This was a great easy, make-ahead-of-time meal.

I love this recipe.  I precook fresh veggies (broccoli, carrots, green beans). Then throw in some mushrooms and frozen peas.  Very filling meal. Great comfort food.

I wanted to make this quicker than the 50 minutes in the oven so I just fried it all in a pan.  I left out the lemon pepper and used garlic powder and season salt.  I also added onion.  It was geat.

We enjoyed this one.  The only think is that it took more like 1 1/2 hrs to cook.  I also used red skinned potatoes and left the skins on.

Easy, cheap, semi-nutritious, & delicious! The only change I made was using Tony Chachere seasoning instead of lemon pepper. I have a feeling that this dish would be good with just salt and pepper even...It's all in the sausage.

Good and easy. Made this on one of my "I don't feel like cooking" nights. Used 6 frozen hashbrown patties, a half bag of mixed veggies and half a bag of broccoli florets and a little less butter.

I used Healthy Choice Turkey kielbasa.  I used hash brown diced potatoes w/peppers and onions.  We don't like brocolli and caulfiflower and such, so I used a frozen bag of black eyed peas, some mini corn on cob, frozen bag of peas/carrots and sliced some zucchini.  Practically a complete meal in itself, just served with some bread.

This was so simple and tasty. I used frozen (thawed first in microwave)diced hashbrown potatoes, since I had no potatoes. Also, I just used garlic powder for seasoning

I thought this was okay, I made it as stated and didn't find anything spectacular about it.  I probably wouldn't make it again, it just tasted like frozen veggies and kielbasa, it needs something to tie it all together.

Very good recipe.  I will definatly use this again.  However, I did add some salt and after baking I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the sausage and potatoes and then added the cheese.

I have been tweeking this recipe for 5 years.  I dice the pots. with the skin on(hopefully this makes them more healthy), I use a 16 oz. bag of frozen Broccoli florets, Turkey Kielbasa(again to make more healthy)and salt, pepper and granulated garlic, then I cover it with shredded colby-jack cheese when the pots are done.  KIDS LOVE IT!!!!  A hit every time.  Good luck to all.

Before I made this recipe, I looked at the reviews and after reading one review where the person put cream of mushroom soup in the recipe, I tried it and I loved it and so did my husband. I will make it again.

Delicious. My family enjoyed this dish alot. I will be making this often. I used garlic powder in place of the lemon pepper. My frozen veggies were corn and Italian style green beans. I did not add the shredded cheddar cheese because the dish was so colorful and tasty without it. Next time I want to add red and yellow bell pepper slices. I diced the potatoes rather small so the dish was completely cooked and ready in 30 minutes.

This was a big hit in our house!  I used one bag of Hanover frozen carrots and one bag of their string beans and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Comfort food at its best!  Made rice in chicken broth and served it over the rice. YUM!  You will have to cook this longer than 50 minutes to fully cook the potatoes. I cubed them very small and they were definitely not done at 50 minutes.  Cooked them 15 minutes more and perfection! This is a simple, delicious and easy meal.  Thanks!

Wow, this was way better than I thought it would be!  Must be the butter!  I made as written except I used 3 potatoes and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  What a pleasant surprise.

I made it in the crock pot! It was super easy. We don't care for lemon pepper, so I used Mrs. Dash, and I added an onion. It took 4 hours on high for the potatoes to get done and it got all thumbs up from the family.

This was so good and so easy!  I was only cooking for two so I used a baking dish just a little smaller than the 9x13. I added half a kielbasa (sliced up)and I also used fresh broccoli, bell pepper, little bit of onion, baby carrots and I diced up 2 small potatoes. Didn't measure, I just cut up enough everything to fill the dish. Used 2 tbs of butter and since I didn't have lemon pepper, I used Lawreys Seasoned Salt.  Baked it at the suggested temp for the suggested time and YUM!  It was super good.  I'll make it all the time and won't hesitate to try the frozen vegetables when I have less time to prepare.  Oh yeah, I just realized I totally forgot the cheese on the top!  It was delicious without it but I'll try to remember next time :)

I used some of the suggestions from other reviewers along with some of my own. I only had smoke sausage - not Kielbasa, so I used that (only 1 - not both). I had some Southern style hash browns in the freezer, so I used those. I only used 1/2 as much butter. I added extra cheese and some onion too. I cooked some egg noodles as a side as well. My husband (who doesn't like Kielbasa or smoked sausage generally) liked it & even had seconds! My somewhat picky 15 month old ate it as well. Its very good the next day too!

This was a delicious and very easy recipe to make.  The only thing that is a negative for me is the nutrition facts.  I try to be more health conscious so I would definitely reduce the butter (I ended up pouring a lot of t out anyway after it was cooked - the food was just swimming in butter!) and try to substitute for some low-fat options in the cheese and sausage as well.

This was surprisingly good!  I did make some changes.  I used chicken kielbasa (less fat).  I also used a lemon-herb seasoning and black pepper as I can't find lemon pepper.  I threw in some garlic powder and hot sauce.  Next time I would use hasbrowns (more evenly cut, and cook faster).  Definitely make again!

Pretty tasty! I added 2 tsp minced garlic and used a cut up butternut squash instead of potatoes. The sausage gave everything a nice subtle flavor. Next time, however, I think I will used a bigger bag of mixed vegetables or perhaps put in some extra beans; there simply weren't enough. I'll be making this again.

Very tasty.  I prepped it in the morning and threw it in the oven when we were ready to make it.  I substituted the lemon pepper with Spicy Montreal Steak seasoning, and added some portabella mushrooms.  Turned out very nicely.

I was in my motorhome without a real oven, so I decided to do this stovetop. I like to brown my kielbasa with onion and fresh garlic slowly to get all the flavor mixed and sausage toasty brown. I then added cut up baby potatoes into small pieces (1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes), so they would cook quickly.  Mixed with onion and sausage , then cover. Cook for about 10 minutes stiring once. When potatoes are almost tender, spred frozen vegetables over top, cover, cook for about 5 minutes.  Mix all together, top with mixture of colby chedder and pepper jack cheese.  Cover for a few more minutes.  It is important to do this over low heat so everything doesn't burn, and flavors blend well.
I used pepper and seasoning  salt, and olive oil instead of butter.   Wonderful cheesy "gravy".
More work this way, but flavor was great!

This is a great basic recipe. You can add different spices to change the taste depending on your mood. I have made this too many times to count. It is also awesome made in a dutch oven over a campfire and has become a family favorite. Thank you!

Made this last night for my finniky boyfriend.We both loved it. I used Green giant baby mixed veggies in a lits herb butter sauce,frozen.Diced the potoes small and added a little onion. I did not use the lemon pepper but italian seasoning and a little bit of pepper. I also sprinkled some bread crumbs ontop of the cheese the last few minutes of baking as another person suggested. The only thing when using those veggies cut the bake time down by 15min. plus you do not need butter when using these. They were a little over done, will adjust next time...BUT LOVED IT. Thank You.

This recipe is the best!  So versitle, so many dinner sausages on the market to chose from.  I had sun dried tomato and chicken.  Added some  garlic and parmesan cheese and a little white wine with whole green beans onion, shallots and the red potatoes pre cooked in the microwave.  It was very delicious.

Good recipe.  My hubby REALLY loves it.  I've made it several times and have tweaked it a little.  I don't use mixed veggies.  I usually just serve a veggie on the side.  I omit the lemon pepper and instead use garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  I salt the potatoes only (the meat is salty enough).  I also use colby-jack cheese to cut back a little on greasiness.  It was pretty good as is, but we like it better with these changes.

Love It!! I used a southwest blend of frozen veggies and a mexican blend cheese. Came out great. Cooked a second time and reduced the butter w/o problem.  Very easy and great tasting! Thanks for adding to my rotation!

This wasn't bad. What frozen veggies you add in do count. Broccoli and carrots worked really well--the beans in the mix, not so much. I was concerned about the folks who said the dish was tasteless or bland, so I spruced it up with a worcestershire sauce, brown sugar shot and some minced garlic, gave it a stir, and fed it to the oven, per directions. There was lots of sauce in the end, and I kept wishing I had dinner rolls for dipping.

My mom picked up a bunch of polish sausage on sale, and pawned some off on me, so I was looking for new ways to cook it. I didn't have the frozen veggies, so I used fresh carrots and potatoes and onion along with frozen peas. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. The kids weren't overly thrilled with the veggies, but they liked the sausage. My husband and I ate pretty full servings. This one's a keeper!

My husband loves kielbasa and really enjoys this dish!  It was quite greasy with all the butter, cheese and sausage.  For veggies, I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower mix.

Excellent tasting & aroma from the kitchen was inviting.  I didn't have lemon pepper so used lemon peel from my spice rack & added fresh ground pepper.  I will cut back a little on the butter next time as my polish sausage was plenty greasy.   I will try some green & red bell peppers as stated in the intro when I make it again.   Thanks, Cat Jenkins  Keep up the good work!

Great recipe! I am not all that fond of casseroles, but rest of the family is. Was looking for something a little different & easy and picked this recipe. Surprised myself..I loved it also! I, like another reviewer, added cr. of mushroom soup to the mix & used Potatoes O'brien out of the bag. Will be making this again..thanks!

This has become a staple recipe in my home due to the quick & easy nature of it.  To make it even easier, I use frozen hash brown potatoes (with or without the peppers/onions) and just put the mixed veggies and the potatoes in frozen.  Then I cook it for the 50 mins covered, then additional 5 to 10 mins uncovered so the sausage gets nice and brown.  Yummy!

This was easy and delicious.  I sliced the potatoes rather than cubing them; don't know what difference that makes, but there you go.  I'll try to cut the butter next time to make it less fattening (though the fattening version was very tasty!) and maybe add a few more vegetables.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  My kids were not too crazy about it, but they picked out what they liked.  We really do not care for lemon pepper, but our family loves garlic.  So, I substituted garlic power for the lemon pepper, and it was very tasty.

It was a good basis, but I found it needed help.  I started  by amping up the existing ingredients- swapped frozen veg for fresh (broccoli, carrot, green bean, onion, all chopped/cubed to bite size), used kielbasa from a local Polish grocery, substituted the cheddar for a 75/25 mix of shredded mozzarella and parmigiano-reggiano.  I then the spices- I rarely keep track of what I use as I tend to fly by the seat of my pants when it comes to seasoning, but there was pepper, minced garlic, dried coriander, and a touch of cumin involved.  The wife loved it, I loved it.

My family did not care for this recipe. The flavor was good--I added other seasonings and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added a bag of frozen broccoli since my kids love it. The problem was that after an hour, nothing was cooked. I sliced the potatoes super thin and they still had the crunch of a radish. I feel like this needed an extra hour for it to be just right and that's just too long for a recipe like this.

Good, simple comfort food. Hubby went back for seconds, so I guess we can call it a success!

I used Season Salt and Garlic Powder instead of the Lemon Pepper and I think next time I'll try some Italian Seasoning too.  But it was very easy and delicious, just needs a little less cooking time.  The sausage was drying out.

I made this almost as written and it was delicious! I will be making it again. The only thing I did differently was I cooked it in my instant pot because I started dinner too late. I added a cup of water so that the IP would pressurized, but left all the other ingredients the same.  I honestly didn't think it would be that good; I picked the recipe because it was easy and I needed to use up the kielbasa I had. I was very happy to be proven wrong!

I was surprised...it's like scallop potatoes with veggies and kielbasa. I bet some onion on top would have been good.

Used Persian Style frozen vegetables, reversing the layers: potatoes, kielbasa then vegetables.  Also substituted olive oil for butter (drissled over the top) and added the lemon pepper on top.  After baking, remove aluminum foil and sprinkle with finely shredded cheddar to taste.  Replace foil and let stand for 2-3 minutes to allow cheese to melt.

We made two modifications.We added a package of dry onion soup mix and boiled the diced potatoes for 10 mins or so before mixing with the rest of the dish.  We absolutely loved it!  It is on our short list for very easy and delicious recipes.

My husband said this was a "Definite make again," so that was awesome, because my husband is very picky. This is the perfect recipe for when I haven't been to the grocery store in weeks. I used beef sausage, a one pound bag of frozen green beans, and about 6 potatoes. I boiled the cut-up potatoes and added the frozen green beans during the last five minutes, and then added both to the cut up sausage. I seasoned with Seasoning salt, creole seasoning, and garlic powder. I added just a little butter (because I'm almost out) and sprinkled cheddar cheese on at the end of baking. (425 degrees for 20 minutes since I precooked the potatoes.) Thanks so much for this recipe!

What a nice dish with kielbasa! Tasted better than I thought it would. I made it as directed except used cajun seasoning instead of lemon pepper, am not a big fan of that. Was a bit too salty overall for me, but not for the rest of the crowd. Next time I will use a low sodium sausage or less seasoning, but it was still an amazing dish. My potatoes turned out perfectly cubed small.  Will definitely make it again!

Wow, I am thrilled with how this turned out!  I was a little skeptical about the lemon pepper... but because of the reviews I went ahead and tried it.  I used lite kielbasa and actually forgot to put the cheese on at the end and it was still delicious!  Thank you Cat!

Quite good actually! It's the lemon pepper! I did boil the potatos first. They weren't soft,  but weren't hard either. I did because rice & potatos uncooked in recipes NEVER cooks for me.

I thought this was awesome, however, I did make a few changes.  I used the Frozen Veggies that you can steam in the bag, still frozen, Frozen hash brown potatoes, and possibly more cheese than it called for.  I also changed up the butter, using some melted butter and two small spoonfuls and added chopped onion.  I was very skeptical, but it came about great!  My husband loved it too, his only request was more cheese. Definitely adding this to my list...it's a keeper!

Very good! I used pepper as I did not have lemon pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. At 50 minutes my diced russets were still hard. This dish took 1 1/2 hours to finish. Partially cooking the potatoes before baking could be a time saver for those who need this dish done in an hours time. I served it with salad and dinner rolls, and will certainly make it again!

Very nice. Potatoes came out very good. Kept foil on the baking dish as instructed. I sprayed pan with pam and did not use any extra butter. Used Mrs Dash lemon pepper. Mixed the lemon pepper with sliced potatoes. It gave potatoes nice taste. Still added some pepper and salt on top  before baking. Added cheddar cheese as instructed. Really good.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipes, I'll be honest.  But I made it according to the recipe and it was actually very good and my hubby even said he likes it (he hardly ever admits that!)  The only thing I would do is cut down on the butter...just a tad bit too much.

Great recipe, my husband and I loved it. We added salt and garlic salt after it was done for a little more flavor, a wonderful addition! I agree about it being a great basic recipe which can be altered depending on mood and the rest of the meal. I'll have to try some different things next time as well.

I really liked this dish... I used turkey kielbasa (sooo much healthier) and less butter. Also I added a frozen pepper and onion mix, but it seemed to be too soft by the time it was all done, so I would maybe add the veggies later. Not sure how that would work but I think it would work out!

Super easy!  Good flavor.  I served it with sour cream for the kids to dip their potatos in. They loved it.  Baked it at 400 because I was late, but I think it still ended up being in the oven for 45 min.  Potatos were perfectly done.  It was just the right amount for me, my husband,and 4 little ones.

Your recipe tasted very good, but the reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was because I needed to use more cheese and better vegetables.  Thank you very much for your time to put in this recipe, I will try it again.

This was okay, there are several other recipes on this site using kielbasa that's much better.  Don't think I'll be making this one again.  Sorry :(

This is wonderful. I added 1/2 C diced onion , precooked in microwave with butter, and seasoned with, salt, pepper, celery salt and garlic powder, mixed all together before pouring into baking pan. So easy! Thanks.

This is a really nice way to use kielbasa!  I followed the recipe except that I added a LOT more frozen veggies...two 14oz. bags of broccoli, carrots, snow peas, water chestnuts.  Used red potatoes.  We both really liked this dish!

I admit when I saw this recipe I didn't see what was so amazing or wonderful about it.  However, I tried it and it was really good.  I used frozen, chopped spinach and corn on the bottom (putting a little onion salt on top), then I used grated lemon peel and regular pepper since I had no ready made lemon pepper.  Everything elseI followed from the recipe. Ended up fabulous.

YUM!  I made this for dinner and my 12 year old and I loved it.  I didn't have any frozen veggies, so I used canned corn, carrots, dill green beans and the potatoes.  I also added onion.  I also used the mushroom soup that someone else suggested and it was great.  I think the only thing I will do differently next time is cook the potatoes a little while before assembling...the potatoes were a little crunchy still.  Overall...very good

We loved this. I used someone's idea for the mushroom soup, adding only 1/2 cup of milk and it wasn't soupy at all. I had a package of frozen vegs with small new potatoes and a package of just broccoli and used both and it was really good. This will be a regular in our house. Thanks Cat for a great new idea for kielbasa.

We liked this. I used california mixed vegetables with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Diced my potatos small so they would be sure to cooke evenly with the rest. Added my salt a pepper and a bit of garlic powder. This is a good week night recipe to use for busy families. You can put it together, pop it in the oven, piddle around the house and before you know it dinner is ready. Thanks for a great post.

pretty good, but it seemed like it was missing something.  Couldn't figure out what it was.  Make sure you also use some really good frozen veggies.  That could have been part of my problem.

This was a easy dish to prepare and the family loved it!  I loved it that it gives me something else to do with kielbasa!  Also a dish that can be pre-made and just popped into the oven when you get home from work.

Pretty good!  I used low fat kielbasa, and actually boiled it for roughly 15 min. before throwing it into the casserole in order to reduce the grease.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and used lemon garlic pepper rather than the plain ole lemon pepper.  Used frozen hashbrowns and stir fry veggies.  Would make again, thanks for the recipe Cat!

Great!  My husband frowned when he saw it since he doesn't like casseroles, however, 2 bites and he said "this is good".  I used the mushroom soup and left out the butter.  I've been telling everyone about it.

This proved to be a very delicious and foolproof recipe.  We used oriental stir-fry vegetables. It may be better to thaw and drain the frozen vegetables well before starting so as to prevent the final dish from being too liquid and wet. We have made it twice-- once it was perfect, once it had too much runny liquid in it. Even so it was good.

The recipe was a hit at our house.  The only changes I made were garlic powder and seasoned salt instead of the lemon pepper and I added onion as well.  I thought there was wonderful flavor and will definately make this again.

I tried this recipe over the weekend and my husband and I both liked it. I sliced my potatoes really thin instead of dicing them. I also added in a 10.75 oz. can of cream of mushroom over the vegetables then layed with sausage and potatoes. It turned out great. I will be using this recipe again.

Even though it's not terribly exciting (none of the "frills" of a more complicated dish), it is very acceptable as a once-in-a-while-for-something-different kind of dish. It's an easy dish to make when you are not especially in the baking mood.

Although this is fairly basic, it wasn't very tasty - thus not worth forsaking simplicity for taste. I had to add liquid because it became dry, and the cubed potatoes remained hard even after 55 minutes of cooking, while the other vegetables were ready. Maybe the recipe should state that pre-cooked cubed potatoes are required. Do not recommend this.
