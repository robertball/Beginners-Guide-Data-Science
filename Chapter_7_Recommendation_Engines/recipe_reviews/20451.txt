This is an delicious, elegant entree.  I sauted the veal in butter and olive oil and used chicken stock instead of veal.  It was fabulous-and ever so easy!

I suggest you use frozen artichoke hearts instead of canned. And salt and pepper to flavor. It was very quick and easy and a nice change for something special for dinner.

The best part of the dish is that it smelled so good while it was cooking and we were not disappointed when we sat down to eat.  I wanted to serve it over pasta so I made a few minor adjustments.  At the time I added the artichokes (I strongly recommend the marinated ones in the jar because they add so much flavor), I also added a can of diced tomatos. I let that simmer for about 10 minutes while the pasta was cooking.  Then I buried the veal back into the sauce and simmered it for another 10 minutes.  The veal was so tender. Perfect topped of with locatelli and hot peppers!

Yea, I subbed also...red wine & water & boullion cube.  This recipe reduced wonderfully & made an excellent sauce over the BREADED veal (that's right, carb-freaks!)and side of ORZO Pilaf. Used 1/2 butter 1/2 grapeseed oil.  Just depends on what flavor you are going for, and what you have on hand.  very easy to sub ingredients.  I'm sure the Marsala is excellent also.  I highly reccommend this recipe.

This meal was very tasty. I also substituted chicken stock for veal stock, and I agree that the liquid gets soaked up quicker than the recipe states - so I suggest adding stock/marsala. I thought the mushroom/artichoke combination was unique, and complemented each other. Oh -- and please, use the flour as the recipe states. If you seriously cut out the flour in order to cut carbs, I don't understand you. That's preposterous!

Excellent- restaurant quality. I did not have marsala, but used a semi-sweet white table wine. I also could not find crimini mushrooms, so I just used the regular mushrooms.I usually find that liquid reduces more quickly than  recipes usually state - in the case of this recipe I just added more stock and wine. I served this with pumpkin risotto.

What an impressive dish!  To say we enjoyed this immensely is a profound understatement.   The veal was perfectly tender, a combination I'm sure, of having good scallopini  to begin with and cooking it properly. The submitter's directions to cook the meat 1-2 minutes per side were spot on.  Once you see the meat begin to turn opaque along the edges it's time to flip!  I used vacuum-packed artichokes and I liked that alternative as it eliminated any of the canned liquid.  Also, while a combination of beef and chicken stock would be the best substitute for veal stock, I simply used chicken broth which certainly didn't compromise any flavor here!  Not that it was necessary because the reduced sauce is perfect and delicious just as is, but I swirled in a couple of pats of butter at the end over low heat just to give the sauce a rich, silky finish. Hubs made  "Oven Baked Parsley Red Potatoes" and steamed haricots verts to go with.  This was a joy to prepare as well as eat. It was as fine or better a veal  dinner as we've had ANYWHERE.

The sauce is definitely a 5+; although the meat was a bit bland for my taste buds.  I was planning on serving pasta as a side so I doubled the sauce.  Glad I did, as I feel the sauce is what makes this meal.  I increased the amount of shallots and garlic called for and used chicken broth in place of the veal stock.  I will definitely be making this recipe again only this time I plan to use marinated artichokes and steak.  Be sure to use crimini mushrooms. If you canâ€™t find them, try using a portabella or stronger tasting mushroom.

I made two versions of this, one chicken and one veal. I got amazing compliments on it. This recipe was easy to make and tasted amazing! I will definitely be making it again. I used the jarred artichokes and extra mushrooms. FANTASTIC!

This was fabulous.  One of the best recipes i've made.  My husband has still not stopped raving about it.  I substituted beef stock for the veal stock and Marsala wine and it was delicious.  I would higly recommend this.  Great recipe.

Great recipe.  I was a little disappointed because it didn't have the flavor I was expecting, but I also under salt, so that could be a problem.  Also, my boyfriend suggested we bake it a little longer, so we popped it in the oven and the taste became more pronounced.  It is even tastier the next day.  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I used chicken broth, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I am a big fan of articoke hearts and I thought they added to the overall flavor of this dish.  Served with a rice pilaf and broccoli, along with a glass of merlot.  Yummy!

This turned out decently. I used veal for scallopini. It was tougher than I have had in restaurants, so maybe I didn't reduce the cooking time adequately? Loved the way the sauce turned out, definitely would reccommend not using artichokes. They just seemed weird with the delicate marsala, veal, and mushroom flavors. I may use spinach in its place next time.

Very good and surprisingly tender. This was my first time cooking veal. I double the shallots, garlic, wine and stock, and I didn't use artichoke. Very tasty!! The flour didn't stick to the veal, but who cares!

Delicious! I just tried this recipe tonight. Both my husband and I enjoyed it. When I first saw the artichokes, I was a bit skeptical, but the flavors blended in nicely. I used fresh artichoke hearts that I boiled for 25 minutes. I also used Madeira wine instead of Masala. Thank you for a new taste.

Fantastic as is!  This was my first time cooking veal and it was surprisingly easy (I was so afraid of overcooking).  I did add some freshly grated parm. cheese to the top just before serving, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for a keeper!

My husband and I enjoyed but the kids were not too thrilled.  Between the taste of the Marsala, mushrooms & arartichoke hearts, I think it was too much for them.  Will make again for my husband for special occasions.  I also had to use chicken broth because I could not find veal broth anywhere.  Thanks Bobbi

What a great sauce!  I was making a couple of side dishes at the same time so I overcooked the veal slightly but the sauce was so good that nobody cared.  My wife loved it and wants to keep inviting people over so we can serve it again!

As suggested I used beef stock and red wine.

This was a very nice taste alternative to the usual dinner fare (i.e. Mexican, Italian, Chinese etc). I didn't have any shallots so I substituted some scallions and used beef broth. Next time I may try chicken broth instead and cut down the wine a little. Over all a tastey dinner - and Quick!

My family loved this meal. I served it over rice with caramelized Brussels sprouts. I had veal stew meat so I just cut it into smaller pieces. I used a sweet red wine since I didn't have Marsala, regular mushrooms, and a combo of chicken and beef bouillon mixed into the artichoke juice for the veal stock. It smelled wonderful while cooking!

This is a fairly easy and very quick recipe!  I made some minor changes though. I added
some fresh Rosemary and Tyme about 1 tablespoon each with the garlic and shallots. I also
substituted Port Wine for the Marsala wine as that's what I had on hand.  My husband
loved it!  I served it with green beans and sauted baby bok choy.
I will definitely pass this on to all my friends!

WOW!  This was REALLY great.  A definite to make again.  I didn't have veal stock and used chicken broth as suggested. Update----I can't believe I reviewed this in 2003 and haven't made it again.  Made this to night, it is a knock you socks off recipe.  My child gave it 5+ stars.  Thank you, Thank you for this.

Wonderful! I used a mediterranean flavored chicken broth in place of the veal stock and made risotto with it also, served over the risotto with grilled asparagus... Marsala wine makes it , would not substitute that, 1 T shallots & garlic seemed skimpy I didn't measure but probably did double...used marinated artichokes 14oz jar...also learned that baby bella mushroom is another name for crimini. will definitely make this again!

Good recipe -- there seems to be something missing (some sort of kick). The leftovers were better, perhaps because the flavors seeped together. Good recipe though.

Breading on veal turned to mush as soon as it went back into pan.  I didn't feel that the artichokes went well with the flavours of the wine and mushrooms.  Okay, but won't make again.

I didn't use flour in order to make the recipe more low carb.  I substituted olive oil for the butter, scallions for the shallot, regular and baby portobella mushrooms for the crimini, and beef broth for the veal broth.  I suppose if it had been lighted floured, it might have been a "5."

I did makes changes by adding mushrooms, our homemade tomato sauce and artichoke hearts and a bit of parmesan and motts. It was really good over buttered noodles with scallions.

won't make it again without changes. Flour did not adhere to the veal, instead sticking to the pan. Sauce was not very thick and lacking flavor.

Wow! Great recipe. I knew where it was headed so I made the following adjustments. 1. Added veg oil to pan for sauteing veal so not to burn butter. 
2. Added 1 cup diced tomatoes to spice up. 
3. Added 1 Tablespoon capers to add salt and spice.
4. Added 2 Tablespoons butter before adding artichoke and veal to thicken sauce. 
 I only used 1/2 amount of veal since there were only two of us. I would want to add more water to give more sauce for full veal recipe if serving over linguine like I did. Otherwise not required to spoon just over veal. 
Serving over linguine was preferred in my opinion, but that's a personal taste. 
Great recipe. Will serve again.

I breaded the cutlets and followed the rest  of the recipe except allowed the meat to absorb in the juices the last few minutes do the meat can absorb the juices.  It was fantastic!

This is the best recipe I have ever made out of a hundred or so new recipes I've tried over the past year. Veal Scaloppini is something I always order on a restaurant menu and this tasted just as good. I have tried to re- create it without success but now realize I was using dry Masala wine so you really need the sweet. I only had .70 of a pound of meat and I would have liked more sauce. Next time I would double it if I had a full pound of meat. I did not use artichokes. I added a pat of butter at the end and a light sprinkle of lemon zest before serving. Delish!

Although I have made dozens of recipes from this site, I felt compelled to review this one due to the outstanding quality.  I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions - I didn't have veal stock so I used beef broth and I only had baby bella mushrooms.  The cut of veal I bought was veal for scallopini which were very thin.  I did not add additional salt due to the saltiness of the beef broth. The skillet I used was a bit wider than I thought I needed but the extra surface area really helped the reduction.  The instructions and measurements for this recipe were spot on.
