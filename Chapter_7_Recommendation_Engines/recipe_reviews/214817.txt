Run, right now (don't walk) to your kitchen and make these muffins. I scooped this recipe and I couldn't wait to get into the kitchen to make them. They did not disappoint. Full of flavor with a wonderful, moist cakey texture. The blueberries and mango held up perfectly within the batter and the combination of the two is a match made in heaven. But it doesn't stop there. The coconut streusel is the 'icing on the cake' that takes these muffins over the top. I followed this recipe just as written, with no adjustments at all, save for making them a batch of 12 rather than 16 (I like to overfill muffin cups). Served them for breakfast this morning and the kids wondered what they had done to deserve such a treat :D Thanks for a brilliant recipe, geranium.

I seriously ate 7 of these muffins in one sitting. But one note: they taste WAY better after cooling completely - the flavors come out more. And here's what I changed: doubled the streusel, added a tad bit brown sugar to streusel, used applesauce instead of butter in muffin batter, used half whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed to make them healthier, and had to use regular milk because I didn't have buttermilk. SO ADDICTING!!!

New Update: I've made them twice. Be sure to buy a "mango slicer".  Our Wegman's had them. After slicing it open, cut a crosshatch pattern but don't slice through the skin. Then slide blade along the skin and you get mango chunks. Much easier than peeling a mango.  Someone told me how, so I thought I would share. I use a whole mango and it is the perfect amount.

The main reason I tried this recipe was because of the Mango in the title.  These are good, and we thought the blueberry overpowered the mango to the point that all you really taste is the blueberry.  If I were to make these again, I would cut the blueberry to 1/2 cup and up the mango by 1/2 cup in return.  These are also pretty sweet for our taste, so I think I would cut the sugar by 1/4 cup as well.  I also think I would have been better served to put this into 20 muffin cups - my 16 overflowed and I ended up with some sticking issues as a result.  We loved the coconut struesel and next time think we would sub brown sugar for the white.  Thanks for sharing!

I feel like I'm not doing this recipe any justice by just giving it 5 stars. It is ah-mazing! I want to make them for everyone I love! I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe exactly as written. If you feel compelled to alter this recipe in any way, don't. You can't upgrade perfection! Update 1/30/11: I have made these over a dozen times now and they never fail to impress. Still don't change a thing, they are amazing just the way geranium intended them to be. I've used both fresh and frozen blueberries, very ripe and slightly ripe mangos and they are good either way.  I use this recipe for "thank you gifts" or whenever I want to make an impressive treat.  It is unique and delicious and I feel so happy I have it in my possession!

I would give these 4.5 stars if I could! They were pretty tasty although the mango was barely detectable. Next time I will cut them into slivers and add an extra 1/4 cup. The coconut topping was a nice touch. If you're a fan of coconut then I would leave the flakes as be and even double the streusel mixture. It was very good! I'm going to bake these in a large muffin pan next batch because the standard size was just too small to enjoy these creations! I made these two days ago and today they tasted the best. One of the few muffins that isn't as delicious right out of the oven!

I'm only giving this 3 stars b/c i was disappointed in these muffins. However, I do believe part of the disappointment was my fault (???). These were not sweet like I imagined they would be. Could be my treatment w/ the mango. Be sure you do not cut the mango too close to the core....it can give the muffin and bitter/pine-y taste. Which is what I fear I may have did. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the flavor combination and end result. But maybe others will have better luck.

Awesome muffins! The combination of blueberries and mangoes was delicious and the streusel topping just puts them over the top. They are light and fluffy, not too sweet....just absolutely perfect. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks :)

FANTASTIC! Easy to make and the combination of flavors is spot on. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, but that was my only change. These came out so light, moist and flavorful. I got 20 muffins out of the batch and I know they will be gone VERY soon! Thanks, geranium, for another winning recipe! :)

The only change I made was to use plain yogurt thinned with a little milk in place of the butter milk and these are spectactular!  Some of the best I've ever tasted.  Thanks Geranium :).

These were very good!  :)  They would really be nice fo serve with brunch.  I used frozen blueberries in the recipe rather than fresh because I had some that I wanted to use up and the recipe came out just fine.  I will definitely make these again!

I made 6 large muffins instead of 16 small, and they turned out so professional-looking and delicious. I also substituted bing cherries (the dark red ones in a can) for the blueberries & mango.. great substitution!

I subbed 1 c of honey for the sugar and didn't add the buttermilk.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose,  and coconut oil instead of butter.  We enjoyed these - the mango and blueberries were a good combo.

I love the mango-blueberry combination in these muffins.  I scaled this recipe down and made a few other changes, but I kept most of the ingredients and measurements as listed.  Thank you for the recipe. ** Update:  These get better as they cool.

These are good but not amazing.  Although I did deviate from the recipe a bit.  I didn't have blueberries so i used pineapple.  I figured it would go well with the mango and coconut.  I also added a little bit more mango than asked. The thing I made a mistake on is cutting back on the sugar to 3/4C as some had stated because I don't like things too sweet.  Next time I will use 1C and use the blueberries and maybe mash some of the mango into the matter along with cut up pieces.

I made these to take to registration at the school that I work out.  They were gone from the teacher's lounge in minutes and I actually had teachers coming to see me to ask if I had any more of them.  Sorry to say that I didn't even get to try one - this time.  I am sure that I will be making these many times again.  I did use some chopped mango that I had frozen earlier this summer and then defrosted overnight.  I also only had frozen blueberries.  They both worked great.  The coconut streusel on top is a must.  It just pulls all of the flavors together and gives the muffins a little crunch.  These also make a very pretty presentation with the blue, orange, and then the coconut topping.  Great recipe!

Excellent recipe!! The muffins are light, airy and packed with fresh flavors. Many reviews claimed the blueberries were overpowering so I used 1 1/2 cups mangos and 1/2 cup blueberries. I also added 1 tsp brown sugar to the streusel topping. Absolutely delicious!

These are amazing! I used 1/4 cup canola oil, and 1/4 cup of applesauce for the butter, and half whole wheat, half white flour. I kept everything else the same and made 12 muffins. Definitely yummy!

Made exactly as directed.  Except made my own sour milk because I didn't have buttermilk.  They are a tad crumbly (maybe because of my substitution) but who cares?  They taste delicious!  And  do they ever make your house smell delicious

These are very yummy. I followed it almost to a T, all I did different was pureed 1 cup of mango's and added about 1/4 cup chopped mangoes, I only had 1/2 cup blueberries so I added raspberries, had 3/4 cup. I really liked the fruit in it but couldn't really taste the mango so next time I'm going to add more mango's and less blueberries. I'm also going to cut the sugar a bit. I found the streusel was a little floury so gonna double the recipe and add more coconut. I gave this 5 stars because it is a really good muffin and different from the normal flavors, I just need to adjust the sugar to my personal taste. great recipe Geranium                                                                                                                                       Jan 27,11  just made these again using blueberries, very good, I added 1/4 cup more mango but still don't taste it much but still very tasty, I reduced the heat to 350 and baked for 20 min but half of them burned at the bottom, :S still eating around it though, also doubled the streusel and I had just enough

Very good, I agree that the Blueberries overpowered the taste of the Mango and I did cut back on the sugar a little, none of us has a really sweet tooth and I find I cut the sugar on most recipes any way. I loved the idea and I'll try it again, they all went quickly. Thank you for the idea.

I was just so thrilled when I found this recipe. The only tweak I made was to use up some dried mango in place of the fresh.  I just adore these muffins, the coconut streusel really is the icing on the cake and complements these muffins entirely.  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!

These muffins are exceptional.  Mangos and blueberries are 2 of my favorite fruits, so when I seen this recipe I knew I had to make them.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious the first day, but they did not keep well.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will add more coconut to the topping.

I was expecting much more flavor from these.  The texture was smooth and heavy.  I would make them again, but I would increase the fruit a bit in hopes that the flavors would be stronger.

These muffins are fantastic. I did substitute peaches for mangos. Just because I didn't have any mangos. Even my husband raved about them & he's not a big muffin fan.

Soft and delicious! I did use the cinnamon in the streusel, but I think it would have made a better addition to the muffin itself in a slightly larger quantity. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used milk with a splash of vinegar and let it sit for 10 minutes; this is the substitute I tend to use without affecting the recipe's outcome. I used frozen fruit, and did not toss the blueberries in flour. Next time I will cut the mango chunks smaller as they did not evenly distribute. Definitely making these again!

I was looking for mango recipes because I wasn't familiar with using them. I tried these today, made them exactly as written and they are simply scrumptious! Highly recommend.

35 calories per mini muffin!!
I substituted applesauce for the butter in the muffins, but left it in the streusel topping. I also used 1/3C flax meal instead of flour for extra-healthyness. These were delicious. Must use muffin liners, though! This made about 44 mini muffins.

(I'm sure it would have been great as written as well, but the fewer calories, the better, in my book)

This was the second time I made them and I remembered that the first time it didn't have enough mango flavor. So, I added another half cup of mango with it's juice and decreased the blueberries. We're not big fans of coconut so I left it out. A nice change of pace from our usual muffins. I like them but my family isn't gaga over them.

These were a good soft muffin.  I thought the blueberries overpowered them a bit.  I hoped that there would be more mango taste.  I used milk instead of buttermilk.  Overall - good.

These were good muffins, but not my favorite.  Other people enjoyed them much more than I did.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the streusel topping.  I also agree they taste better when completely cool.  While tasty, I probably won't make on any sort of regular basis.

Very good!  I would recommend as the recipe says really get the butter mixed into the streusel-I didn't and it was hit or miss on top once they were baked!

The muffin of the Gods!  I tweaked this recipe just a bit.  I used brown sugar rather than white sugar for the streusel and I only used 1 cup of sugar for the muffin mix.  I left out the 1/4 cup flour at the bottom of the ingredient list completely by accident.  I was able to make 12 muffins rather than the 16 it states in the servings.  These were absolutely perfect!

These were AMAZING! Hands down the best muffins I've ever had/made, and my husband agreed! I did use common healthier substitutes (applesauce for butter in the muffins, all whole-wheat flour, half splenda/half white sugar, skim milk w/vinegar for buttermilk, all egg whites). I can only imagine that the full-fat, white flour version would be absolutely divine!!

Excellent recipe.  I made this one day when I had blueberries and mangoes that needed to be used up.  Who knew that I'd find a recipe to utilize both?  I didn't have coconut handy, but it came out great all the same.  I was afraid that the mango might overpower the blueberries, but they complemented each other well.  The muffins also freeze very well, and I was able to have great breakfasts for the rest of the week!

The flavor of these is excellent, but the texture is... ...interesting due to the mango.  It's like taking globs of hair and baking them into a delicious muffin.  Sometimes it looks like belly button lint..  You can take a bite and pull it away from your mouth and observe the hairy texture jutting out.  I tried to make this twice since I thought I didn't cut the mango right the first time, but it was the same result.  I would take a bite, chew it lightly and swallow it quickly because of the texture.  I've given up on these.

These were quite good. I would be surprised, if they were actually a take from a coffee cake recipe. The base is almost like a butter cake and the mangoes and blueberries are great together. I do not care for sweet topping on a muffin, but this one works well with the chewy browned coconut. I made 1/2 recipe. I followed the recipe, adding the optional cinnamon, and subbing buttermilk with a mix of 3 tablespoons of milk and 1 tablespoon reduced fat sour cream.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of mango juice that accumulated after chopping the fruit as it sat in the measuring cup. 1/2 recipe yielded 9 muffins with a #16 scoop. I sprayed my non-stick pan lightly with PAM. After they cooled, at least 10 minutes, I had to nudge them just a little with a plastic knife. That wasnt a big deal. They were done in 24 minutes. I would recommend these. ty

I had to try this recipe three times before I got it perfect. I recommend making any changes very gradually so you don't end up with two dud batches. The first time I made this recipe I followed the advice of another reviewer to sub milk for buttermilk because I did not have buttermilk on hand. The muffins turned out very flat and bitter because you could still taste the baking powder but I wanted to try again because I LOVE mangoes and blueberries. After 2 mins on google I learned that with baking powder you need an acid not only to get a fluffy outcome but also to neutralize the bitterness of the parking powder. So if you don't have buttermilk, you can google substitutions like one cup of milk with on tablespoon of vinegar, or plain yogurt thinned with milk. 

The second time around, I used the vinegar and milk and the bitterness was completely gone. However,  I followed another reviewers advice and subbed coconut oil instead of butter and my whole batter curdled. I baked it anyway and while delicious, they were very greasy and I tossed them. 

The third time I followed the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN but I used vinegar and milk and added a little vanilla and cinnamon. They out came out PERFECT!!!!!!! Sooooooo delicious!!!! My coworkers wouldn't stop talking about them (they never tried the duds) I'm making these every mango season along with my mango salsa and mango jam :)

I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for half of the butter, used whole-grain flour, and added 1/4 cup of mango juice to increase the mango flavor. I also used almost 2 cups of diced mango, and 1 cup frozen blueberries, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. I folded the blueberries into the dough very carefully, so that they would not pop, to preserve the mango flavor. The muffins came out great, very delicate and moist. I guess if you like more blueberry flavor, 1 cup of mango is enough, and if you prefer the mango flavor, use 2 cups of mango and be careful not to pop the blueberries while mixing. 
Next time, I will add 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger to the batter, and use just plain unsweetened coconut flakes as a topping.

These are fantastic!  I did make some changes due to what we had on hand.  I didn't have blueberries, but I had strawberries so I diced those with the mango.  I also used 1/4 coconut oil and 1/4 applesauce instead of the butter and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.
The coconut streusel topping is amazing and I will be using it on many other recipes in the future.

These turned out excellent!  I was making these into mini-muffins for a large brunch, and realized too late that the blueberries I bought were too big for mini-muffins.  I had already mixed the batter, so I went ahead and baked them, and learned I wanted about twice the amount of topping on each mini-muffin.  So I made another batch with these changes: I ommitted the blueberries, and added 2 tsp coconut extract.  Then instead of the streudel topping, I put a generous amount of sweetened flaked coconut on each muffin. By the time the mini-muffins were cooked through (about 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees) the coconut had toasted.  I had several people ask who had made those "coconut muffins" at the brunch.  It was a very light-flavored muffin, but delicious.

MAKE THEM.  These are the best muffins I have ever made, and I have made so many I can't count.  Don't change anything, they are perfect just the way they are.   I made these, had them at work and they were gone in minutes - yes MINUTES.  Sent this recipe to my kids and they loved it too.  Almost makes me not want to share with anyone else. LOL.

These are fabulous just as written!  Every single person who has eaten these says they are delicious and they want the recipe.  I had an overabundance of mangoes from Bountiful Baskets and needed to use them up.  These were just the ticket!

Absolutely fantastic!! I do not like fresh fruit(I know, I know) but loved the mango & blueberries in this muffin! I ate 3, yes 3, the day I made them. Dangerous to have around! I think I'll double the coconut streusel next time-loved it! Thanks!!!!

Awesome, moist and delicious.  I've never cooked with a mango before and this was fine to make.  I'm not even a big fan of coconut and still loved these!   I substituted light margarine for butter and fat free Lactaid + lemon juice for the buttermilk, muffins were still excellent and much lower in fat.  With the replacements the muffins are one 3 Weight Watchers points per muffin!  Yum!

These are amazing! I made the following changes:

-substituted most of the utter for coconut oil (used some butter still)
-used a little over half of the amount of sugar recipe called for (they turned out perfect and not overpowered by sugar)
-I left my mango chunks large (not finely diced)
-I threw in half a cup of raspberries (this gave them a perfect amount of zing to the flavour)
-I didn't have quite enough coconut, so I used some dried organic mango I just brought back from Hawaii and diced it finedly and added to the streusel mix. 
-again, in the streusel I used mostly coconut oil (cold not melted and kind of smoothed it in to the flour) still used a small amount of cold butter 

These were full of flavour, moist and full of chunks of fresh delicious fruit. The coconut oil helped give them the tropical taste. 

I named these "Lindsey's Hawaiian Muffins"

These are great! It's basically a very light, airy, and moist blueberry muffin with a tropical twist. My twelve year old and nine year old sisters won't leave them alone! I'm trying to get them to stop shoving these in their mouths so the rest of my family can have some for breakfast in the morning. I would suggest putting half the batter in the muffin cups, then one or two teaspoons of cream cheese on top of that and then covering it with the rest of the batter. Also, the topping is slightly dry. The topping in the recipe "to die for blueberry muffins"(also on this site) with coconut added to it would be perfect. But, if you don't have the time or don't want to make changes, they're still wonderful as is!

OMG, CC was right.  Run ... don't walk ... to your kitchen and whip these puppies up.  They are THAT good!  Muffin itself is delightfully light and fluffy, while the mango/blueberries give it JUST the right zing.  Coconut crumble takes them from delicious to out of this world.  Fill cups fairly full as mine didn't rise much.  25 minutes was perfect time for me.  Have read they taste even better once they've cooled ... if so, I'll be making this recipe over and over and over and over again.  Thanks SO much!

Love at first bite :-)  I'm not a mango fan, as they tend to leave a funny aftertaste. So I substituted peaches with excellent results; either canned (drained, of course) or fresh work well. I liked the topping and doubled it.  I also like a lot of berries, so I increased those to 1 1/2 cups. These freeze well for breakfast on the run.

The first time I made this recipe I made it as written and in my opinion it is worthy of a five star rating.  I than made the recipe a second time making some substitutions for the sugar and fat in the recipe, to cut the calories and make it more healthy.  I have a mango tree and a lot of mangos to use up.  I cut the white sugar to 1/4 c. and added 1/2 cup of maple syrup. To counter the additional liquid I reduced the buttermilk by 1.5 tablespoons.  I also substituted 1/2 the butter with extra virgin coconut oil. They came out just as good. The next time I make these I will use all coconut oil in the batter instead of butter, but will leave the butter in the streusel.

I made these as is and they are FABULOUS! They are very moist and taste like they came fresh from a bakery. These are kid tested as I made them for a playdate and some of the little ones were going back for thirds.

This recipe is amazing. I have to admit that I did make just two minor changes. I replaced the butter with good quality organic virgin coconut oil and I made streusel with coconut oil, flour, sugar and cinnamon (just a little) because I didn't have any actual coconut. This was hands down THE best muffin I have ever made. Make sure your mango is ripe but not TOO soft so you get nice chunks. If it isn't ripe enough you'll get the "piney" taste I've heard complaints about. I am currently making my second batch in a week and I can't wait until they're done. YUM!

These muffins are absolutely delicious!  Even my husband, who doesn't like mangos, likes these. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar slightly, reducing it by 1/2 cup. The fruit has so much flavour!  The blueberries tasted very fresh and the mango gave a rich underlying taste. Just fantastic!  I'll be making these for my quilting group next time I need to bring 'the lunch'!

These muffins are sooooo awesome.  Added a little nutmeg to the topping.  YUM!  Didn't see the hint on double the topping until after they were done but I will definitely do it next time.  Although they were yummy warm, once cooled the flavors really popped.  Will be making these again!

In an attempt to lighten these up I made the following changes:
1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 regular flour
1/4 cup applesauce plus 1/4 cup canola oil for butter
Reduce sugar to 3/4 cup
I made 18 mini muffins without the topping and 4 big ones with the topping.

Excellent, but even with the sugar reduced to 3/4 cup I found these sweet, it may be just a personal thing.

These muffins are to die for! They are light and fluffy and the streusel on top is awesome. Every time I make these I get rave reviews! The only thing I have ever changed is cutting the sugar down by a few tablespoons (I don't like my breakfast muffins too sweet), other than that it's a great recipe!

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!10 stars.. I Listened to others and cut sugar. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, egg whites instead of whole egg and applesauce (or pureed mango) instead of butter, decreased the blueberry and increased the mango. For the streusel I added oatmeal!!!!!! Will continue to make! Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious!  I was making these at night after the baby was asleep & couldn't go out for coconut (which I thought I had).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Can't wait to use coconut next time.

This was amazing, although because of what I had in the house I did change a few minor things.

-no blueberries in the house so I used the last of our little wild saskatoons - AMAZING

-Increased Mango to 1.5cups after reading other reviews but kept saskatoons the same

-Decreased sugar to just under 1 cup, and I still could decrease it more

-no buttermilk and instead of making sour milk I used a batch of homemade yogourt that didn't turn out quite right. Excellent tart flavour and not watery at all.

After reading a review I *HAD* to make these. I'm very glad I did! I used my large muffin pan which yielded 8 MAMMOTH muffins. Probably won't do that again because I think the temperature should be adjusted and I don't want to run the risk of messing up these gems ;)

These muffins received unanimous approval.  I increased the mango quantity, and in doing so had to increase baking time.  I am not a coconut fan, but these shavings really add more to the texture than flavor.

These were awesome and worthy of more than 5 stars.  The texture of the muffins were like fluffy cake.  The mango was a more subtle flavor and I think could easily be exchanged for chopped peaches if that's all one has on hand.  The topping was everything people said it was.  What a great combination of flavors!  I will definitely make these every time I have blueberries on hand!

Very good muffin, very moist and the blueberry and mango combo is perfect. Made a few changes, I reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and omitted the sugar from the topping since the sweetened coconut flaked is sweet enough to do the work.

Instead of muffins, I made mini bread loaves from this recipe.  I couldn't get them out of the pan!  However, the texture and taste is so very good.  I'm making the mini loaves again tonight but will be lining the bottoms with waxed paper!  For my taste, the coconut steusel doesn't add a lot of extra flavor so I will be leaving it out.  Still, I rate this five stars because the taste is truly delicious.

These came out so good.  Loved the combination of fruits and the coconut on top.  Texture of the cake was really nice too.  Definitely added to my baking rotation.  Love mangoes and have been putting them in lots of things lately since they are in season now.  This was something new!

I made this recipe as is and it if I could put more stars, I WOULD! It is the perfect recipe to say goodbye to the summer days. It is so bright and beautiful. My only modifications are as follows: I added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter too not just to the streusel. THIS IS A KEEPER RECIPE! I WILL MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN and will definitely double the streusel because as someone mentioned: IT IS THE CHERRY ON TOP of this delicious thing!!! I made them cupcake size and it yielded 18. I used frozen cubed mango but let it thaw completely before adding it to the recipe. Given that they were acidic, I added about 2 additional tbsp of brown sugar to the batter to make up for the acidity. Keep this in mind if your mangoes are too sweet or acid, adjust it.  As someone suggested, let the flavors develop. I tried it the next day and it was absolutely glorious! All I could do was have my cup of coffee along with it!!! I also baked them for 25 minutes and added 5 minutes to obtain a golden top which made it even MORE ATTRACTIVE!!! These are so addictive!!!

No blueberries so used mango and frozen cherries. Baked up beautifully with a little extra time. Would probably let the fruit thaw next time. Delicious though.

Just luck I found this recipe. I happened to have a ripe mango and blueberries. The combination of the fruits brings out the taste of both. The muffin had a good texture. I took a short cut and just topped the muffin with sweetened coconut that toasted nicely during the baking. Great recipe I will definitely make again

Will make again. Light and fluffy but the frozen mango pieces seem to have disappeared during baking. Perhaps I cut them too small.

These are AH-MAZING!!! My parents have a mango tree and I always have lots of mango.  I freeze lots of it.  These are incredible.  My boyfriend is not a fan of mango and loves these muffins.  Mango tends to be a bit overpowering but not at all in this recipe.  The mango makes them very moist.  I didn't have buttermilk last time and I substituted with greek yogurt.  WOW!!!! Very good.  The only thing was they collapsed a bit...not sure why but they were still tasty!  Thank you!!! I am now making this recipe for the 5x!

Substituted frozen blackberries in place of blueberries because I had them on hand.  I made 12, cooked for 35 minutes. Will increase baking time to 40 minutes if using same method next time.

I've been wanting to make this muffin for a while. Lucky me ( I live in Hawaii) a neighbor with a huge mango tree gave me a grocery bag filled with ripe mangoes. I made these muffins exactly as written, no tweaks. My kitchen smelled liked coconuts mango and blueberries. I have a gas oven so it took me 35 minutes to bake.  I had 16 muffins which rose nicely and with a nice light color topping. The muffins were moist, light and fluffy and I really liked the coconut streusel topping. However, I noticed the blueberries and mangoes overpowered each other. They were fighting each other in each bite. If I were to do this again I would make this with just mangoes, double the streusel topping using brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I would do the same with just blueberries and the coconut streusel, again, using brown sugar instead of white.

Extremely tasty recipe!! There were a lot of compliments for these. I subbed mixed berries and they came out just fine. I only filled the muffin cups half full to leave plenty of room for the streusel. Very delicious!

Fantastic!  Made as written.  Only addition I can add is they are better the second day!  So don't worry if you need to make muffins for the next day or to share later.  I would even suggest making them the day before you want to serve them.

Oh, so good!  This will go in my hard copy file.  Very moist, flavorful, pretty presentation.  I think I might add 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract next time.  Not that they need it, I just want to give it a try.

Used frozen blueberries and frozen mango. The coating with flour step worked perfectly. I kept all the general ingredients and proportions as written but tweaked as follows...I always substitute 1 cup of the white flour with 1/2 cup each of wheat flour and ground oatmeal. And make the sugars 1/2 white, 1/2 brown. I used milk in place of buttermilk because what is what I had and didn't want to bother making it sour. Yummy muffins!

UPDATE - I made again without the crumb top because it was for the next day (camping trip) and didn't want to get soft. I realized after putting them in the oven that some cinnamon in the mix might add a little more flavor since there would be no streusel.

I made these muffins for the first time last night and am so pleased with the results!  A few changes I made: skipped adding the salt, added about 1 t of vanilla in with the eggs/sugar/butter, used 1/2 c nonfat milk with 1/2 T of lemon juice instead of buttermilk, used double the amount of brown sugar for the topping instead of white and melted the butter for the topping before stirring it into the crumble mixture.  I was able to make 14 regular muffins out of this batch.  Someone mentioned that they're not tasty hot, but I have to disagree!  Thanks for this recipe, geranium.  I'll definitely be making these muffins many times in the future!

My only change to this recipe was that I puréed the fruit (cutting down the blueberries a bit) since my kids would revolt if they "saw" fruit chunks, but I thought these lacked flavor overall.  The streusel didn't seem to add anything to me.  They were ok, but I may tweak to add more flavor.

great recipe when you use fresh, juicy mangos. the flavor of these muffins is wonderful. one of my favorites. I haved used the streusel topping on other muffin recipes too.
