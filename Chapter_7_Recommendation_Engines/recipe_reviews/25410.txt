I liked it b/c it was easy to make but it was a little heavy on the "Worsty" sauce.  So I think next time I am going to use 5 oz Worsty sauce AND 5 oz of either tomato sauce or some other type of flavored sauce to make a mix.   :-)

It might be getting a bad rap because it is definately a "guy meal".  I personally hate it, but my husband loves it...serve it at the super bowl game, I guess.

My husband and I love this recipe. I replaced the ground beef with turkey, used green onion,  less sauce, red potatoes diced with skin and added corn. My husband requests it about once a week now.

This is not my favorite recipie, but my fiance LOVES it. It's a guy dish. I think it's pretty good, but not something I want all the time. He begs me to make it. Luckily it's very simple and quick..great for those nights when you don't have much time.

I added garlic and a few dashes of Tabasco sauce.  Instead of using 10 ounces of Worcestershire, I only used a few dashes and then added a cup of water for the potatoes to cook in.  It turned out okay, but nothing to get excited about.

This was really Good we liked it even better than the Hamburger Hash, the addition of the Worcestershire sauce is what makes it for us. I did add 3 cloves of crushed garlic. Again this is gr8 when ur finances are limited or u r running low on  groceries.

It had too much kick to it. Even for my step father's taste and he eats anything. Figuring I'll have to tweak it a bit maybe add some flour and not so much Worcestershire sauce. Loved the ease of cooking it.

My husband LOVES this.  I did cut the worcestershire sauce way back, added some minced garlic and used  canned diced potatoes.  I know it has received bad reviews but 10 ounces of worcestershire can ruin anything.  Definitely a man meal!

I thought this was really, really good. Instead of ground beef, I used a steak that I chopped into little pieces. It is simple to make and was even faster because I used leftover (cold) baked potatoes. I ended up adding some hot peppers at the end. It serves well with some pickled okra and peperoncini. :-) Thank you for the recipe.

Sorry, didn't like this.  I also didn't read the reviews first.  I was looking for something different using ground chuck.

It is a tad bit strong, but I wound up mushing up the potatoes and mixing in the peas and corn on the side - that was great! I'll definitely do this again but with modifications.

My husband and his fellow hunting buddies love this when they are at camp.  I use minute steak instead of hamburger.  It takes about 1 hour to simmer to get the potatoes just right.
