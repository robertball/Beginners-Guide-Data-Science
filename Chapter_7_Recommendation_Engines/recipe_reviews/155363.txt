Was good- my husband and I enjoyed it although it was a bit too spicy for us to love it (hence the 4 stars) but that is of course a personal preference. We like spice- just not gut on fire spice! We will make it again but for us we'll probably cut the red pepper flakes in half.

Hey I have a few suggestions for anyone trying this out: With the red pepper flakes don't use a heaping teaspoon it will be too much. It will over take the flavor. You can use any meat you would like... Just make sure you cut it thin if you use fish or shrimp use due care. A Soy ginger salad dressing can take the place of those two ingredients. I have made this recipe several time using Spaghetti Squash it is a fantastic alternative to the egg noodles I actually prefer it. I hope these suggestions help... I would also recommend using crunchy peanut butter! Enjoy!

Great recipe! It was a bit too spicy, so you can reduce the red pepper flakes. I think 1/2 teaspoon is probably enough. I cooked this for a work potluck and everyone loved it. I made a vegan version though with no chicken and more soy sauce, instead of using oyster sauce.

I enjoyed preparing this dish, but found it too rich and thick for my liking.  It was difficult getting the cooked noodles incorporated into the dish.  I did like the spiciness of it, and love the curry!  If I made this again I would decrease the peanut butter to a tablespoon or so, and use a thicker, sturdier noodle & perhps some chicken broth for more liquid.  Sincere thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

This receipe was delicious! The flavor was absolutely spot on! I would recommend to reduce the amount of red pepper unless you have a really high tolerance for spicy food. I made this receipe with a few modifications. I used regular egg noodles instead of chinese egg noodles and vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. I used 1 TBSP of ground ginger and ground red pepper instead of pepper flakes. Instead of carrots water chestnuts and mushrooms I used 1/2 a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables. Will definately make again!

This was really really great! It was very flavorful and spicy--to my surprise though my 7-year old was able to handle it! My hubby loved the recipe and we would definitely have it again. I love that it's pretty quick to prepare and good for a busy weeknight meal. The only changes I made were to use Pad Thai noodles (couldn't find the birds' nests) and I added celery instead of the mushrooms. Thanks!!

I love this recipe. I made it just like it says and everyone loved it. I made one with chicken and the other with shrimp....ppl gobbled it up. I will be making this again but I want to turn up the spicy factor a little.

Good except needed to add chicken stock as the sauce was too thick. Added only 2 Tbsp of curry and 1 tsp red pepper flakes.

Quite nice.  Good taste alternative for typical chow mein.  I used less hot pepper flakes and added some chopped zucchini and it was lovely.

The flavors combine ok and it is edible. It didn't taste authentic though and I don't think I would follow this recipe again.

Love it! Had to make a few substitutions: no oyster sauce - used more soy sauce instead and just a tad bit of hoisin. Also no mushrooms chestnuts or carrots. Tossed in some left over fish and left over noodles from a pho that wasn't finished last night and voila! Quick simple easy and delicious.

I made this for my family which includes a picky pete. Even he ate it! I did decrease the red pepper flakes to 1/2 and it was perfect hotness. I added more liquid since I let my noodles sit too long and it was hard to mix together. Thank you for submitting.

this dish had a very interesting and unique taste. but in a good way. i liked the way that the peanut butter played around with the saltiness of soy sauce and oyster sauce. the curry powder was a great addition but i also added in garham masala powder and tumeric. yummy!

Would have rated this five stars except for the heat factor. My husband and I love spicy food but the 2 teaspoons of pepper flakes was WAY too hot. Must say that we have noted that our pepper flakes are hotter than most so take that into consideration and adjust the red pepper according to your heat tolerance. We also didn't find straw mushrooms in our local grocery store so used crimini mushrooms and it worked well. Thanks for the recipe.

I cut back both the red pepper and curry (1/2 tsp & 2 tbsp). I also only used 4 noodle baskets and it still made too much. I would cut this to 3 if I made it again. Wife was not happy with the dish she does not like curry flavor.

Awesome!  Used part olive oil and some sesame oil.  Used celery, onion and carrot.  Doubled the recipe and put  about 3/4 T of peppers.  Spicy enough for me!  Used about 2-3 pounds yakisoba noodles.
