I thought the flavor was great and had no consistency problems, even after 3 hours of simmering. For those that had liquid evaporate, did you simmer it covered? I recommend doing so and you probably won't have as many issues with evaporation.

First, the flavor of this sauce is fantastic.  However, after the first hour of simmering, all the liquid evaporated, and the sauce became more of a paste-- I kept adding wine to try to thin it out.  This recipe is a good base for a sauce, but not a good sauce by itself.

Awesome recipe. I let mine simmer about 4 hours. Did add some V8 occasionally throughout the cooking period as the liquid kept evaporating. Great flavor and texture. NOTE: Very oily as written. I decreased the olive oil by half.

I quadrupled this recipe and let it hang out in the crockpot all day long.  Wonderful.  Put all the extra in the freezer and it works great for all kinds of Italian recipes.  Lasagne, pizza, spaghetti etc.  Great for once a month cooking.

I doubled this recipe which was very easy to do.  I plan to freeze the leftovers.  It was a bit oily and I used only 3/4 cup of oil.  I may use 1/2 cup next time.  I used fresh-chopped basil, a few dashes of sea salt, tablespoon of red pepper flakes and a couple splashes of dry red wine.  I had no problems with this cooking down or evaporating.  It never went pasty at all and I cooked it covered on low for 3 hours.

I was surprised when I saw celery and carrot in a marinara sauce, but it came out great!  I did make some variations.  For the meat lovers coming to dinner, I made as recommended, but added ground beef.  For the veggie lovers, I added zucchini, broccoli, yellow squash, and a little red wine.  Everyone loved it.

I sauteed the vegetables in 1/4 cup of the olive oil before adding to the other ingredients. I ended up throwing all the ingredients in my small slow cooker and letting it cook on LOW for most of the day. This was just what I needed for dinner tonight using bits and pieces of what I had on hand. Next time, I'll throw in some meat.

Hmm.  I wouldn't call this a marinara--more like a chunky spaghetti sauce.  It's not bad, but I too had problems with the liquid evaporating.  I kept the lid on during cooking, so I know that isn't it.  I added in about a cup red wine for liquid, but if I made it again I'd add in V8 instead.  Didn't like the combo of wine with the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very tastey! My husband thought it could have used salt, but I thought it was fine.  We used it to dip our calzones in.

This recipe is so simple to make.  It simmers for a long time but is definitely worth the wait.  I added extra onions and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper to make it hot.  I also added 1lb of shrimp.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Followed the recipe except for the mushrooms.  Simmered for 3 hours.  Thought it was very bland.

delicous!  I made it with meatballs.  It was a winner.  I also didn't make any changes to the original recipe.  Just covered it while it was cooking so that it wouldn't evaporate.

this was very good. instead of adding 1/2 c oil at the end i used only a few Tbs to saute the garlic and onion. i used this for lasagna as a reviewer recommended but i think it would be best w/ linguine or angel hair

Good flavor, has a subtle sweetness which is good.  I also kept adding red wine because liquid evaporated.  If you like Chunky marinara MAKE THIS!  H

This was very good; I even got a compliment from a picky eater! The only issue I had was that this recipe only makes about 3 servings--I had to double it to make dinner for two adult men and one woman (me!). I'll definitely be making this again.

Made this exactly as written. It was edible, but I wouldn't make  it again.  I simmered for 3 hours.  I think there was too much of the spices, but I'm not really quite sure what to pin my dissatisfction on.

Really like this sauce. I doubled the dried herbs, and added 1 tbsp garlic powder (in addition to fresh) and 1 tbsp honey.
