Wish I could give this recipe more than five stars.  It is unbelievably good!  The combination of chicken, pineapple and rice (I used brown rice) seemed to be lacking in vegetables, so after I made the soup, I took out some of the broth, put it in a small pan and simmered parsnips and celeric (cut into small cubes)in the covered pan until tender.  I then added all into the soup and...voila!  My husband pronounced it one of the best soups he's ever had.  I think snow peas and bamboo shoots would be equally good, but I didn't have those on hand.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My kids LOVED this soup. It's got wonderful flavor - chicken, curry, pineapple, and coconut. I made it just as written, but I would suggest only adding about half the rice. It REALLY thickened up.

This was excellent.  It would be good with seafood, too.  (I often order a soup called "Fusion" at a local Thai restaurant.  It tastes somewhat like this, but is a little more red in color and is slightly sweeter.

I am cambodian and I have always been intimidated by Khmer dishes because my mom's cooking is so good!  This dish was very good and easy to make, so don't be nervous in trying this out.  I followed another reviewer's advise and used only 2 cups of rice.  I do feel like it is missing some vegetables but I really couldn't think of what would go well w/ it.  Maybe bell peppers? Squash?  I don't know...Also, I love spicy food so I used 2 whole serrano peppers, minced.

I tried this for a new way to use red curry paste.  The pineapple was my favorite part about this recipe- adds a great sweet & spicy flavor to it.  Like someone else already mentioned, I think it calls for too much rice, but other than that it was great.  I made it vegetarian with tofu instead of the chicken, and I might try it with shrimp next time- very versatile!

This was a huge hit in my house! At first my husband wasn't too keen on the ingredients or idea, but once he was eating it he loved it! My mother LOVED it... she ate two heaping bowls full! I didn't change the recipe except I used one extra chicken breast and as many people suggested, I used just 2 cups of cooked rice. I also diced and sauteed a yellow bell pepper and added it to the mix. Such a good addition! I let it sit on the stove for a couple hours, which thickened it up like a stew and then added a little bit more chicken broth. I served it with pan-fried naan bread. Delicious! I loved the spicy mixed with the sweet. Thanks!

Great recipe! I travel to Cambodia and this is a close taste to what I have tried there. I did add sweet potatoe, zucchini and baby corn. Omitted the rice

I put this in my slow cooker as I was running out the door, starting with cold water and put it on high for 3 hours.  I didn't have everything the recipe called for, like fish oil/sauce... also instead of curry paste I used dry ground and also ground ginger; for peppers I slivered and sauted orange & red sweet peppers and a med onion, and added brown rice raw (just over 1/2 C).  For the chicken I threw in 2 chicken breast whole.  When I got home I pulled out the chicken and shredded coursley w/a knife and returned it to the cooker; lastly I added the can of coconut milk and a can of sweet corn, and served it immediately.  It was the perfect consistency.  My family raved about it and demanded it go in the "keeper" recipe book.

Very good. I used to get a soup like this at a Cambodian restuarant near me - until it closed down.   I do like others and reduce the rice. Sometimes I have it with rice noodles instead. I don't add vegetables just because when I got it at the restaurant they only had sprouts as more of a garnish and I got used to it that way.  Southeast Asian food is usually a balance of salty, sweet, sour, hot. I add some salt to this soup. I think the heat is fine. As to the sour and sweet, I use crushed pineapple and don't drain it so it's sour enough. For me, the sugar (sweet) adds balance to the sour.

I was looking for a hot and sour soup recipe and came upon this one.  Reading the positive reviews, I was encouraged to try it out.  I am so glad I did.  At first taste, I was intrigued but unsure.  At second taste, I was pleased.  At third taste I was absolutely delighted.  And my husband, who dislikes hot and spicy, really liked this sweet and spicy soup.  It's a winner for us.

I made it last night. The recipe was easy to follow, the ingredients were easy to find at my local grocer and it was that perfect combination of flavours. I've already shared the recipe with a few people. YUMMY!!!

I've made a lot of recipes on here but this one is the most memorable. It is excellent and very easy. Kids loved it, I loved it, many of my co-workers have tried and loved it. I've added shrimp which made it irresistable.

This works well in the crock pot too. Use 1 1/2 quarts of water, and what's nice is you can just put in 1 - 1 1/2 cups of uncooked rice. Now for a magical ingredient to try. Some of you will think it's a bit out of character for this soup, but definitely adds something. I had a half bag of rather stale corn tortilla chips. I threw them in a bowl of the soup and let them soak it up for a couple minutes. WOW! Try it yourself! Loved the soup, this is just another thing to try with it. It could use just a bit less coconut milk in my opinion, since it tends to dominate the flavor. I sauteed the chicken, garlic, peppers and such in balsamic vinegar with the curry powder to impart more flavor to the chicken. Added the coconut milk and cilantro about 10 minutes before serving and also added chopped scallions/green onions for more color.

Good soup. A little too different for my Mother, who typically loves Asian food. I liked it and would make it again. I used half the rice called for and it was perfect.

This is sooo good.  I had no idea what to expect.  I chose this recipe based on ingredients I had on hand.  When I got down to it, I did not have any pineapple, so I cut up three bananas and added them instead.  They cooked down sweet and starchy, like a potato.  The soup is rich, sweet, spicy and mmm, mmm, satisfying.  I can't wait to make it again using pineapple.

Was looking for a "different" type of chicken soup and found this. Never tried anything like it, but it sounded interesting. Turned out to be excellent. Whole family liked it. Only thing it may need is a pinch of salt.

This was really good. Different, but delicious. I added a few carrots and a red bell pepper. 4 cups of cooked rice was just fine IMO. I also used 1 1/2 spanish pepper instead of the poblanos. It was really good but next time I might use a bit more red curry paste and less yellow curry powder. We will definately make this again, thank you :-)

Excellent recipe! I made the soup exactly as directed, except I left the rice in a separate dish and spooned the soup over it when served. I also added carrots and sweet potato that I boiled in chicken broth beforehand. I'm sure it would be even better with shrimp!

This was not very good. The flavors were not balanced. Way too sweet and creamy and lacked a salty componant. I managed to make it fairly decent by adding salt, pepper and a little onion powder. I will not make this again.

Super Flavor!  Very Yummy! I agreed with other raters...it needed more veggies.  I went ahead and added diced up sweet potatoes, zucchini and yellow onions to give it more body.  It made it a hearty and very delicious soup!  5 stars with adding the veggies in!

I've been on a soup kick recently, and I thought I'd give this a go. Really glad I did! I liked it, and my mom and brother loved the flavor! The only thing I did differently the second time around was add some carrots and potatoes to the mix. Still just as nice, and a bit more filling! Thanks for the recipe!

The soup is fantastic as written, except that I agree with another reviewer; 4 cups of rice would be far too much. 2 is plenty for the amount of soup.  It's also really good with some veggies added in - I like adding carrots, red and green bell pepper, and sugar snap peas.

Great tasting dish! Reminds my husband of the red curry at our fave Thai restaurant. I always add lots of veggies: bell pepper, broccoli, bamboo, snow peas; whatever I have on hand. Also I omit the sugar because I think coconut milk is plenty sweet. I use Lite coconut milk and it still tastes great.

this soup rocks! made it last night and loved it.  my husband suggested that steamed carrots and potatoes would be good in this, too.  perhaps some white onion in the saute?  i will definitely make this again.

This recipe is pretty good.  I've made it a few times, never having every ingredient, and it's always turned out really tasty.  It can get a little like a mush sometimes, but the flavors are really great.

This is great!  I followed it as posted with the following small changes... I did not use the seeds of the Serrano pepper and I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  The flavor is great.  I will probably add more chicken next time.

This is a very yummy recipe even though, I was missing some key ingredients - pineapple and red curry paste. However, my family still loved it, especially my 3 kids! They fought over who was going to bring the left overs in their lunch thermos the next day. I will say this was very thick for "soup" with four cups of cooked rice, but I think it turned out great for my family because I make a LOT of soup, which gets old for kids after a while and having something thicker like this made it less soup-like. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very quick and easy to make and tasted so delicious! My husband couldn't say enough good things about it and insisted it be saved for a regular menu choice. "I would share this with anyone, even Michelle Obama" he said, "It's that good." (He had just seen Mrs Obama on the Tonight Show the night before, which is probably why she came to mind!)

My husband LOVED this soup and I thought it a bit sweet but still enjoyed it.  I made it exactly as written except I reduced the rice  and it was very easy.

My family loved it! I was looking for something a little different, using ingredients I had on hand. Disclaimer: I only had green curry paste on hand, so I used that instead of the red that was called for. I omitted the chili peppers because most of my family (myself included) aren't fans of spicy. I  discovered as I was cooking that I was out of curry powder (eek!) so I made a homemade curry blend (cumin, turmeric, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, cayenne, salt, black pepper, ground mustard, ground clove...I was sad I didn't have any cardamom) after reading some recipes for curry powder. It would have been even better with regular curry powder! This is definitely one I'll make again!

Amazing recipe, great flavor! Simple to make. If you try it yourself, I'd suggest adding a little more ginger (1.5-2 tsp) and garlic (2 cloves), use fresh pineapple (20 oz. can = 2 cups chopped fresh), and keep the rice separate. Keeping the rice out of it keeps it from getting soggy/mushy. Enjoy!!!

Added onion and carrots and doubled the chicken and used 3 cups rice.  My womens group liked it.  I did feel it was missing something, not sure what.  I will make again.

Really tasty! Didn't change anything although I think I probably used way more chili peppers than called for. But it still wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be.  I used the full four cups of rice and did not find it too much.  Both hubby and I really liked this soup served with naan bread. Will repeat so thanks for posting.

Very nice but I think next time I'll add onion. I did reduce the rice and it was still thick. Thanks for sharing

I made this without the pineapple and it was really good! I also used 2 serano peppers which added a lot of spice, which I probably would only use 1 next time.

This was awesome! Modifications: I omitted the sugar, added mushrooms, mini bell peppers, and fresh cilantro, and used extra ginger and garlic. I think adding a couple of vegetables was a good idea--it made me feel healthier about such a rich soup... such a fantastic soup. I'd' make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

The perfect broth! Cutting the rice in half was the correct recommendation to follow. Will make this again.
