Very easy, very good.  Would recommend using more pumpkin and less ice cream or more seasoning.  Very mild and light.

Oh my goodness! Found this accidentally and I made 4 pies for our Canadian Thanksgiving. They were a hit and I will be making this again but I will not wait for Thanksgiving-- I will be making it more often. Used 1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree instead of 1 cup. Excellent recipe, thank you so much.

this pie is an excellent alternative as it saves oven space and can be made WAY ahead of time.  i found that it tasted better, less sweet, more creamy, after a couple days in the freezer.  big hit, even with those who preferred more savory foods.

I made this for my thanksgiving dessert. Eeverybody enjoted it but it seemed like it was missing something. I looked back over the recipe only to realize I forgot to mix the brown sugar in. So I plan on trying this recipe again WITH the brown sugar haha.

This is one of my favorite recipes even though I only eat pumpkin pie of nothing else is left. It's great; guests find it intriguing and tasty. Freezes well, as you might expect.

This is a great pie and I like to put whipped cream on it when served. Season to your liking if you wish but it met my families varied taste the way it was.

Easy and very tasty! I made it gluten-free by making my own crust using gluten-free cereal  instead of graham crackers. It is a hit!

Nice way to get your pumpkin fix when it's too hot to turn your oven on! I also added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice to bump up the spiciness. Used 1/2 a 2 litre container of Chapman's ice cream, good balance with pumpkin. Thanks for the recipe :)

I never thought of pumpkin pie as a summer dessert before, but now I can thanks to this recipe. It was very easy to prepare and it tasted great. Next time I might try a little pumpkin pie spice. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm giving it 5 stars for now, but may change it later. I read other reviews suggesting it needed more pumpkin & more spice. I'm not sure it did, but I added more. Since I added more pumpkin, I added more salt. Do not add more salt. If anything, short it a little. I also think I either overmixed it or over softened the ice cream. There was no spooning it into the pie crusts. However, these were my mistakes and i was in a rush finding things to bring to our Thanksgiving potluck when our oven died the morning before Thanksgiving. Additionally, this did not quite fill up both 9 inch crusts. Perhaps it would have been different if I hadn't over softened the ice cream? I think I may spread a little cool whip over the tops if I need to hide the difference and perhaps mask a little of the salt.

I took others advice and added pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon to this recipe. I liked the flavor and it was not overbearing.  Also finely chopped pecans added some texture and added flavor.
