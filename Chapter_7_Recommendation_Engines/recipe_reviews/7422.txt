I was confused by the pan size.  The recipe calls for 9" round (12 servings??), but the picture looks like an 8x11 or 9x13.  I used a 9x13, doubled the crumb recipe and cornstarch mixture.  I did not increase the fruit amounts or the baking time.  My pan was full!

The only problem I have with this recipe is that it is called "cake." When you make it, you will discover that it is delicious, but it is more like a cobbler (but not as sweet) than like a cake.   I followed this recipe exactly the first time. The second time I meant to follow it exactly because it was wonderful, but accidentally put in a whole cup of oatmeal rather than 3/4. It still turned out to be great. You will receive lots of compliments if you bake this dish. :) I used a 9" x 13" square dish rather than a round one.   Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Roxanne!

This was excellent. Used frozen rhubarb from last year. I did increase the cornstarch to 3T. Also this is more of a crisp than cake!

I made this at a birthday party.  I did cut the sugar in half and everyone loved it.  It is mor of a crumble cake (streusel) than a plain cake but it tastes awesome.

This was excellent.  Would only have been better had I had ice cream to serve with it.  It is not a cake but a cobbler but I knew that from the reviews and from reading the recipe.  "That is as good as anything you will ever buy" - quote from my husband.  It was runny when I served it but it was still hot from the oven and firmed slightly when it cooled.

This recipe was very easy to make and turned out delicous. I baked it in a 9 inch square stoneware pan, omitted the nutmeg, and served warm with vanilla frozen yogurt. Will be making this recipe often.

This cake was absolutely wonderful! I didn't change a thing. The Rhubarb/Strawberry mixture was so delish. My family got to try a piece and then I brought the rest to work..RAVE reviews..I will make this again!!

The name of this dessert is misleading...it is more of a crumble rather than a true cake.  The bottom layer became very hard and stuck to the pan, and the nutmeg flavor was too strong.  Better to use the fruit in a pie.

Amazing! This is my first time having rhubarb. I got a whole bunch in my CSA and had no idea what to do with it besides making strawberry rhubarb pie and I'm not a big fan of pie. This crisp is so good!

Very yummy!!  I also baked the bottom crust for about 10 minutes as suggested by other reviewers.  I also reduced the sugar in the glaze by about a quarter cup, and instead of pouring it over the fruit while the fruit was on the crust I mixed it with the fruit then spooned in into the bottom crust- I think it coated the fruit more evenly.  I took this to a cookout, and it was gone, many people had seconds. I will make this again.

I substituted fresh pineapple for the rhubarb and this was delicious!  Quite tart and sweet, but great with vanilla ice cream.  The only problem with the recipe is that I ran out of the crumble mix which I used very humbly, will double that if I use this recipe again.

This is delicious!  I did not have any oats so I used grape nut cereal and it was awesome.  I also cooked it in an oval (12x8) pan and it came out great.  I will make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was very easy to make and everyone who tries it will love it - even people who don't like rhubarb.  You have to serve it with vanilla ice cream!  It's much more like a cobbler than a cake - a super summer recipe!

This recipe was SO good and SO easy -- even my often-skeptical husband and daughter were impressed!  I made it exactly as listed and we had it with vanilla ice cream -- yum!  This one is definitely a winner. In fact, I'm trying it with mulberries tonight!

It is rhubarb season here, so I love new options for it.  This was great, though I agree, not really a cake, more of a crisp.

The kids loved it, and so did the adults, we topped it with half and half...sinfully good.

What a refreshing treat! We picked the rhubarb from the back yard and ate this fresh. It's definitely more of a crumble than a cake, but great nonetheless.

This is definitely a crisp/cobbler and not a cake. I used a 13x9 pan sprayed the bottom so the crust would not stick and pre baked it for 10 minutes. I double the crisp recipe but left the sauce as is. Also omitted the nutmeg (not a fan). After the sauce was made I also place the strawberries and rhubarb into the sauce and brought back to low boil then cut the heat and cooled slightly before pouring over the bottom. The crisp come out awesome!
