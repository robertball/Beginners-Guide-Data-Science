My big fish hater LOVED this. The whitefish was very fresh to start with which helps any fish dish.  I made this exactly as stated, only I reduced the oil for the pan to about 3Tbs for 3 filets.  I seared the flesh side down first than turned over to the skin side down and got a beautiful crust.  I layed them out on paper towels to absorb most of the oil.  This helps bring the calories down without losing any flavor. Perfect flavoring, not too spicy or salty.

I knew by looking at the ingredient list that the salt was going to have to go but other than that I made as written. I used fresh caught catfish  and cut it in fairly thin small pieces so that it would get good and crispy. We enjoyed this and it was a nice change from the regular cornmeal/flour breading.  I used the pink chile sauce for dipping and it paired perfectly with this. Great recipe but I highly recommend omitting the salt. There was plenty between the two sauces the fish gets marinated in.
