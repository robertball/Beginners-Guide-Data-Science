Very similar to other muffin frittata recipes; this one differing in that it calls for asparagus rather than zucchini, although a variety of vegetables would work.  Also different with this recipe is that it directs you to pre-cook the vegetables before mixing them in with the eggs and then baking.  This is an unnecessary step.   If the vegetables are chopped finely enough, which they should be anyway since these muffins are so little, you can save yourself some time and a pan to clean.  Since the asparagus (or in my case zucchini) is green,  I chose to use red rather than green bell pepper for the color contrast.  I also added fresh chopped dill because I love it. These are nutritious and wholesome but still hearty, delicious and satisfying.  I baked these in free -standing silicone cups that I sprayed with cooking spray.  They popped right out and were a cinch to clean. Good, good for you, pretty on the plate and easy clean-up.  I like that.  (Note: if you want to save a few calories I've also made these without the cheese with equally good results)

I love mini frittatas although, being Italian, frittata means that one of the ingredients is usually small diced potatoes.  Without the potatoes, it's more of a quiche.

Just made these for Christmas breakfast and they were a hit!  I made them with diced red onion, mushrooms and yellow, red and green peppers , sharp cheddar and pancetta. Tasty and easy! Recipe is a keeper!

I significantly changed the recipe. I used 2 cups of grated potatoes instead of asparagus. Like Naples34102 said, no need to fry the ingredient first. I just mixed everything and pour in 10 large muffins tins. It was quick and leftovers are great for lunches. Next time, I'll  some herbs and garlic because I thought it lacked a bit of taste.

Yum! I made 5 ramekin sized and cooked a bit longer. Used up some mushrooms and homemade roasted peppers. Added lots of fresh garlic and even some dried. I only had white onion and Mexican Queso cheese. Great recipe to use up stuff you have in the fridge. It was delish.

These are really easy and make for a great on the go breakfast and would be fabulous for a brunch.  I baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect.  Also, I used foil cupcake liners that I sprayed with cooking spray.  They lifted right out and there was hardly any clean up.  I didn't use the entire amount of cheese but that is just personal taste - a little sprinkling of cheese on each 'muffin' was perfect.

Very good, quick and easy recipe.  I made these for my mommy group and they raved about them.  I have to admit that I used the veggies I had on hand - grape tomatoes, bell peppers and onion.  I would try goat cheese instead of cheddar just to change it up for next time.

These are delicious!  I did not use cupcake/muffin liners just sprayed the pan.  Next time I will use the liners, since mine got a little browned on the outside.  The cook time is spot on.  Thanks!!

I came into Allrecipes to get this receipe after having these muffin frittatas at a friend's house for Easter.  They were delicious -- she changed the recipe by chopping up asparagas instead of zucchini.  I think there are a lot of possible variation.  I am cooking for a group of people in a couple of weeks and was planning to make a couple of quiches;  I'm going to try these frittatas instead.

My family loves these!  I've played around with veggies, amounts of cheese, etc... 
One thing I've found out is that the amount of cheese acts like a 'binder'; if you cut back on the cheese they will sink.  If you want to cut back on the cheese, increase 'bulky' veggies, such as adding bits of cauliflower, broccoli, as well as the amount of veggies called for in the recipe.

Just tried this recipe and it turned out great.  I used a silicone muffin pan and that made removal after they were cooked a breeze!  I also did not cook the veggies beforehand as some others had suggested and was successful.  Just FYI, mine took 30 minutes to cook and I used red bell peppers for color.  One other change I would make would be to hold off adding the cheese until they are in the muffin pans as the cheese was not distributed evenly.  Some frittatas had a bunch while others, not so much.  Regardless, yummy and I intend to do them again.

Great- like a muffin shaped omelet. I used yellow bell pepper and a young red onion from the garden with a slice of tomato on top. I used jack cheese and a sprinkle of garlic salt. Yummy!

My husband was a huge fan of this recipe.  I used frozen Italian vegetables since it was only the two of us and it came together really well.  I will definelty make these again. Great idea of our "meatless Mondays."

I enjoyed these.  I think next time I will add the cheese to the top, rather than mixed in with everything else to keep it more consistently distributed.

I never had all the ingredients so I made it with bacon , onion, cheese & tomato. It was gorgeous! Will add this to my regular menu. Very good for single people as they can be refrigerated and warmed up carefully the next day.

I used chopped zucchini , onion, potatoes, red pepper .  I think it's important to sauté the veggies first to bring out the flavor.  It was delicious!

Delicious!  I added a pinch of oregano, zucchini with spinach. And grated reggiano Parmesan cheese.  Read other "Italian" response and we have never put potatoes in our frittatas!
These are good with any combo, great idea especially for high schoolers who never have enough time for breakfast!

I liked these and next time I am using cupcake liners just to save on the clean up.  Used thawed and squeezed chopped spinach instead of asparagus as that is what I had.  Also added sauteed mushrooms.  Very good!

I'm giving this five stars just for the way it sounds; haven't made it yet, but it's a great idea for a brunch buffet we're planning. Looking for frittata recipes, I found one on Epicurious that said DON'T whip the eggs too much - beat only until whites and yolks are blended -  or the frittata will puff up and then fall. I thought that might be the problem the less-than-5-star reviewers were having..

I was thinking about trying these by spraying an aluminum cupcake cup then adding the egg mixture.  I make brownie muffins with the aluminum cups and they come out great.  You could also whip the egg whites and fold the into the mixture.  It may keep the centers from sinking.  Just a thought.  Sparki

This recipe is delicious and similar to the one on incredibleegg.com. I added additional veggies because I had them, and I sweated the veggies in the microwave, avoiding the oil. I filled the cups almost full, which made a nice full muffin-my yield was 8 muffins.

'Breakfast for dinner' is one of our favourite meals in our house. This recipe is so easy to adjust in regards to ingredients. I usually make it when I have extra chicken and veggies. I also substitute the cheddar cheese with goat feta. Because of the feta, I don't add salt. Originally, I tried using paper cupcake liners, however, tend to stick. I found silicone liners and spray them with oil or coconut oil. The result? No more sticking! They come out clean every time. Hope this helps.

The frittatas were excellent!  My guests enjoyed them with a salad and corn on the cob for lunch.  We ate the leftovers the next day and they were just as good.  Would make a tasty lunchbox addition as well.

Good...my variations were to use almond milk instead of milk, broccoli florets and cheddar cheese. Needed some herb though for flavor. Needed to bake for 30minutes. Also used aluminium muffin tins sprayed with canola oil. Very good for a low calorie healthy meal.

I love this recipe. Of course, like many, I changed it a bit. Instead of asparagus, I used red, orange & yellow peppers (no green), white onion, and a bit of crumbled bacon or sausage. I also added pepper jack cheese to give it a zing. They were yummy! The only problem I had is after they cooled off they deflated to half their height after taking them out of the oven.

The only thing I did different was to add fresh spinach that I wilted and used muffin paper.  Mine too sank in the middle and was not pretty at all. I would not make this again.

I used basic recipe but first cooked link sausage in skillet & then cooked onion, roasted red bell pepper, spinach and parsley in same skillet with about two Tbls of butter.  Cut up sausage and returned to pan.  Then added this mixture into egg mixture.  Yum!! Great nutritious and healthy meal.

Not going to lie, I wasn't a huge fan of them but at the same time I can appreciate them. I was trying to find something that didn't remind me so much of egg and this just didn't do it. I will keep it though. I think added a little bacon or ham to them would make them perfect! Definitely something everyone should try. I bring a few to work in the mornings and just re heat them!

The man asked for a breakfast quiche and this is what I decided to make him instead.  He absolutely loved it and said it definitely hit the spot.  My daughter, who doesn't care for eggs, enjoyed it too but with a little hot sauce.  I give her props for trying!

I was spending so much money on pre-made frozen egg meals that just weren't all that tasty.  I made these frittatas with onion, peppers, mushrooms and cheese.  Nine eggs makes 1 dozen muffin size frittatas which I freeze and nuke to reheat (1 1/2 min. for 2) and they are delicious.   I made them for my kids when they came to visit and they loved them.....my son ate six!  Serve with or without toast or homefries if you want a bigger breakfast.  They are also good for dinner.  I made them with asparagus too.  I think anything you would put in a quiche would do equally well.  I'm so glad I found this recipe.

These are great to make a double batch and put in the fridge. Just take them out and let them cool on paper towels to get rid of excess moisture. You can have a quick breakfast on the go all week long.

A hit at a potluck.  I served cold, cut in halves, and served on a dish with a bowl of salsa in the middle.  Super easy, I substituted some onion, red and green peppers finely chopped and some fresh spinach. Easy to switch out and use vegetable on hand.

I varied the vegetables with what I had on hand (mushrooms, spinach and tomato) and they turned out great.  This is a great way to feed a group breakfast.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

3.5  stars would be best.

I love making these types of recipes for eating or snacking any time of day.  Have made several so feel experienced enough to wonder why these fell and stuck to the pan?
No way on earth will this recipe fill 12 muffin cups.  It barely made eight, using the 1/4 c measure; Pam spray was used in each muffin cup.  Not sure if the oven could have been hotter, which would then create less cooking time, or what.
Didn't have asparagus on hand, so substituted the same amount of frozen peas, which were microwaved to soften.
Rather than green pepper used jarred roasted red peppers, but same ingredients/amounts of everything else.
They caved and stuck to the pan, which is a mystery, given it's a non-stick muffin tin sprayed with Pam.
Also seemed too bland; perhaps needs a dash of sriracha plus more salt?  Unsure.  If I decide to try this again will definitely make those changes.  If it doesn't work out well, will ditch this recipe and try others.
Sadly, wanted to give these to a neighbor whose spouse is in the hospital but cannot now.  Live and learn.

I just made a serving for myself. I have deep muffin pans FYI. I used 1.5 eggs (1 whole egg plus an egg white), arugula, spinach, red onion, Canadian bacon and I meant to add tomatoes but forgot. I cooked for 23 mins on 350°. I’m guessing it took so long to cook bc it was a lot of stuff all in one. Turned out delicious though!

These mini frittatas are lusciously delicious. I used leftover asparagus that had already been steamed, adding directly to egg mixture with sautéed Red onion and green pepper. I am sure sautéing uncooked asparagus would be just as good. I am freezing these for quick, on the go breakfast or snack.

Great base recipe.  I had been wanting to try making these for a while but wasn't sure of the egg/milk/veggie ratio. I followed the recipe for egg prep and threw in chopped red bell pepper, broccoli and turkey bacon with a little cheddar cheese and they were fabulous.  I can't wait to do turkey bacon, mozz and spinach next and freeze them for a quick breakfast! What's great is that you also mix regular eggs and egg whites to make these healthier.  Thanks for this recipe!

So fast, easy, and delicious. I actually make then package them up for a quick breakfast throughout the week. Fast to heat up, about 30 seconds for each one.

I’ve made this several times and it is a fantastic base. You can add anything to it really spinach, ham or bacon etc.
I double the recipe and freeze the extras. Just throw them in the fridge at night  then warm up in the microwave for 30 sec

Easy and versatile!  I love the idea of using muffin trays so they can be individualized.  I added bacon to a couple and kept the rest vegetarian with broccoli, asparagus, onion and sharp cheddar for a delicious Xmas brunch.  I recommend using liners as mine stuck to the pan even with a good coating of Pam.

This turned out surprisingly well. I find that you can replace the veggies in the original recipe for whatever you want, provided that the amount (volume wise) is similar. If you plan on using mushrooms, sauté beforehand in order to get rid of it's excess of water. I used broccoli, shallot and red bell pepper with a pepper jack cheese blend. Pretty tasty and I'm glad to have found this recipe. I placed my mix in several stand alone Reynolds baking cups and the recipe ended up making 8. Those cups are bigger than the well from a standard sized muffin tin.

I made these as a low-carb option for dashing out the door to go to work.  The only thing I did differently was to add some finely diced left-over prosciutto that had been sitting unused in my meat drawer.  These muffins could accommodate left-over veggies, etc from the previous day's meal, depending on what they were, of course.  Excellent flavors and presentation, and easy to put together.

I made this for Father's Day brunch using shredded zucchini, cut up tomatoes, diced mushrooms and goat cheese cuz that's what I had on hand. I used a ceramic muffin tin and they popped right out. Easy way to feed a crowd for brunch.

This is a great frittata recipe. I  did beat the egg whites a bit before adding the yokes, veggies, some sausage and cheese. This helps keep the centers from sinking and they will cook a bit more evenly.  The word frittata translates roughly to "fried" even tho they are finished in the oven.  I feel the veggies should be chopped small and slightly precooked because the short cooking time might result in some hard veggies if skipped.

Great base recipe. I made with onions, peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic (all cut pretty small), less cheese and half cups with bacon, half pulled pork (leftovers). Delicious and simple. Easily modifiable. Made 12 cups (2/3 full). Done at 20-21 min.

I made these with southwestern egg beaters instead of eggs and used about 1/4 c of chopped ham and only 1/4 c of grated cheese.  I didn't add any veggies because I did not have any.  They were great!  I also used a little picante sauce on them.   I think I will try them next time with a little chopped spinach.  Great to carry to work for snack.  Way yummy!

Made this with zucchini, red onion, garlic, and some leftover shredded chicken. Next time I'll put some potatoes in, I think that would be an excellent addition. I sauteed the veggies first and I liked the flavor that it gave (I'm also on a diet where I need my veggies to be cooked very soft, and didn't want to take any chances). 

I cut down on the cheese and added some extra spices, but I think next time I would use a bit more salt as well.

I found the flavor nice. I used a whole green pepper and wish I'd used more onion. I also used a little extra cheese in mine just to finish out the bag. Mine did fall as previous reviewers have mentioned but they are still a good size. My only real complaint is when I bagged them up they were extremely watery I don't know if its from the asparagus or what but that was a bit unappetizing to me.

Turned out great.  Added leftover turkey and green beans.  Used heavy cream, it's what I had.  Recipe seems very adaptable to what you have. Low carb too - Bonus! Will try liners next time.  Can freeze for a quick healthy breakfast.

I served this with a salad for lunch today and the family like it . I baked in 4 tartelette pans.
I added some chopped parsley and used a blend of shredded cheeses. I plan to make with different veggies and cheeses in the future.

My family loved these.  I wrapped partially cooked bacon around the outside of some of the muffins and then filled them with the egg mixture.  Great because any veggies you have can be tossed into the mix.

I enjoy Frittatas  being Italian.  I like the idea of serving separate
muffins to a group It makes it easier to serve.  i would exchange the asparagus with peppers, or  squash.  I found it delicious.

Loved it! I followed recipe for the most part. I don't like asparagus so I used a shredded potato and I used a red bell pepper. It was delicious. When done I ate it with salsa!

I have made these twice and both times they shrivel up and shrink after they come out of the oven.  When I first took them out they were all puffed up and beautiful, but very soon they shriveled into weird misshapen blobs.  I don't understand what happened.  They taste good, but are ugly.

Simple and delicious. You can add whatever veggies you like. I added mushrooms and green onions. I'd make double next time and freeze. Makes a great snack!

I made these for breakfast this morning.  I omitted the asparagus and added 1 cup of Orida diced hash browns and 3/4 cup diced ham.  I used a larger muffin pan that made 6 and added a couple of minutes to the cooking time.  They turned out great and looked quite attractive.  Next time I will add 1/8 tsp of ceyenne pepper to bring out a little more flavor.

This recipe was wonderful.  I think mine  resembled baby quiches. I didn't have asparagus so I used  some leftover rosemary broccoli (cooked) and a little bacon.   Delish!

Made it healthier by using egg substitute , low fat milk, and of course no salt. Plus I mix my veggies to what ever is in the fridge at the time

Easy easy breakfast. I did not have time to use the peppers. I had some pre-made bacon from Costco. I made the bacon and crumbled it up in egg mixture, added half and half and hot sauce, with some shredded taco cheese. Put in muffin tin with a little more cheese sprinkled on top. Delicious!

Mine sank in the middle too :-(        So, they did not look presentable, will have to keep looking for a recipe.   But the taste was fine, even though I cut substantially back on the cheese.

I made this recipe with veggies I had in the frig -onions, broccoli, red and yellow peppers. Would work with any veggies. Added a little fried salami.   Baked in my extra large 6 muffin tin for 25 minutes.  (More like a quiche.)  Excellent

I added some crumbled goat cheese after dishing up the mix into the muffin cups, about 1/2-1 tablespoon per frittatas, as well as some cut up sausage links. They were delicious and the goat cheese kept them extra moist.

This one is a keeper.  Very easy to make.  I originally thought of making this for a potluck brunch. The brunch was cancelled but I decided to prepare this as a grab and go.  Very tasty.  I may try to make this with different veggies.

Really easy- worked well. Cooked using convention oven setting, but took 30 min instead of 20 in a gas oven.  I'm cooking at close to sea level if that's  of help. Super easy.  Suggest reduce salt to half because the cheddar adds salt.

I don't think that I whipped the eggs enough before I mixed them with the vegetables...they came out a little flat. And honestly, I left the second pan in too long and they were rubber. Spinach and mushrooms would also be a lovely variation. I used Parmesan in lieu of cheddar and I'm happy with the first pan. Would make again but pay more attention to the lightness of the egg mixture!
