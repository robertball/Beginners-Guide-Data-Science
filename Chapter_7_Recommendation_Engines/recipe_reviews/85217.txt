Tried this soup at a Greek restaurant and knew we'd be trying it at home.Just as good as the restaurant soup.Sometimes we use canned chicken and bottled lemon juice.Very easy to make.

This soup is absolutely fantastic! You will not beleive how easy it is to prepare. 
 Many greek family restaurants make this soup with rice, so if you want the soup to be thicker, substitute rice in for a thicker end result. But this recipe, as directed, is the true authentic version.
 I could not find McCormick Greek Seasoning anywhere, so I used Herbs de Provence, which really rounded out all the flavors nicely. 
 I paired this soup with layered cheese and tomato paninis and my friends went crazy for it.

Our favorite Greek restaurant had closed, and the one thing we were going to miss was their Lemon Chicken Rice Soup! I tried this and it came out awesom. I added just a little more seasoning and lemon. Thank you, thank you!!!

This recipe was only okay to me.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using white rice instead of orzo pasta.  The taste was a bit bland, even with all the Greek seasoning.

The best Greek Orzo soup recipe! I use more Orzo to make it thicker. I also use the rotisserie chicken from the deli

My husband and I LOVE this soup.  I make it with Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock.  It gives the soup a richer flavor.  Also, I use steamed brown rice instead of orzo to make it healthier.  I found the Greek Seasoning at Meijer.  While I'm sure the soup would be good without it is outstanding with the seasoning.

This soup was incredibly fast to prepare and pretty good.  The avgolemono i've had in restaurants had a very prounounced lemon taste, whereas this soup has just a hint of a lemon taste.  I added way more lemon juice than called for so that helped.  Also, next time I will make my own chicken broth.

Love this soup...it couldn't be easier!  We add a bit more lemon and a bit of cinnamon to deepen the flavor.

Delicious!  Never thought you could make a yummy soup in less than half an hour.  This one will be on our "favorites" rotation.  I might add a couple Tbs more orzo next time.
