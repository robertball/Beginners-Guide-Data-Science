We changed the recipe a little. We only put 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup Mayonnaise. We also added a teaspoon of minced garlic and red pepper flakes to season. My husband loved it.

We thought this was good with a small change.
Instead of butter for something to soften it with I used Salad dressing (Miracle whip0. For our taste I also added a tough of garlic and ground red pepper.

We just weren't crazy about this. Personally, I've had better from the deli. Waste of money and ingredients.

OK, my daughter 8 and son 6 thought this was the absolutely best thing next to sliced bread.  I'd had this years ago for New Years Eve, served in a pumpernickel bread bowl, and never knew how to make it.  I used a can of liver sausage, no butter or Worcestershire (thought I had it but apparently didnt), about 2-3 T green onion, soft, canned bacon bits, and the cream cheese, with a pinch of salt, black pepper, and Mrs Dash Zesty - like a Cajun seasoning, and about 2 T finely minced yellow onion.  We wrapped in plastic wrap - about 3x5 size, and chilled.  The kids wanted to lick the bowl and spoon clean!   Will serve with pumpernickel and Ritz crackers to give the kids different taste experiences.  Thanks!

11.28.16  The recipe doesn’t tell you what to do with the bacon (add to pate or garnish?), but I added it to the pate.  The bacon flavor is subtle, but is something that makes the pate distinctive.  I lined the top of a butter dish with plastic wrap and then filled it with the pate mixture.  I chilled it, then removed the plastic wrap and spread it with with reduced-fat cream cheese, then back to the fridge overnight.  I did add some salt and pepper and garnished with chopped parsley and sliced olives, otherwise, followed the recipe. I used my hand mixer on low speed to mix the pate, so the ingredients were evenly incorporated. Tasty appetizer with nice presentation and love that it’s one that can be made in advance.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  My teenage nieces and nephews love it.  I don't change a thing.

We liked this! I topped mine with the crumbled bacon and finely chopped green onions and green olives. Nice flavor. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
