Major improvements by: 1) use cream of mushroom soup instead 2) use 1/3 cup chopped onion instead of powder 3) spread layer of french fried onions on top under final layer of cheese before last 5 mins baking. With these changes it disappears fast - only enough for four in my family

Satisfying dish, I used whole wheat trick by using half reg pasta and half whole wheat pasta. Did this in another recipe and husband was happy and said he could not tell and liked it. Same with this recipe, and I liked it too! Didn't have Ham so I used leftover Greek Grilled Chicken from last night, used cream of chix soup and steamed the asparagus in a wet paper towel in the micro, after dusting with spray butter and salt & pepper. Snack or appetizer idea, while I waiting for the oven to get to temp, I was tasting by picking a cut piece of asparagus and inserting into the penne pasta I had used, WOW cool idea... Throw in your own take on this one and I think you will be happy.

I made this last evening using left over honey baked ham.  I followed the recipe as written.  My husband and I enjoyed it.  I do think a little more milk would be better.  I will make again.

I look at every recipe as a suggestion, and I tweak it depending on what I have.  Biggest change I made...used Cream of Chicken soup instead.  Added red peppers and french fried onions on top.  Didn't have any milk either but substituted a bit of sour cream and some water.

Very good recipe!  I made it for 2 people that had never had asparagus before, and they loved it!  Was a tiny bit dry, maybe a little more milk or possibly some water next time.  Great as a leftover too!

This is an excellent recipe for someone who loves the taste of Asparagus!  I didn't have the onion powder, so chopped an onion and added it while I was cooking the asparagus (6 minutes in the microwave) Was lacking the full amount of the corkscrew pasta, so tossed in some bowties. And since we love the cheese, added more on top than was called for.  My husband said it was a "Do-Again".

This tasted pretty good; I'm wavering here between 3 stars and 4 stars. I used pre-cooked BBQ ham, bought at the local farmer's market, and tri-color natural vegetable rotini. I will use less pasta and more cheese in the future.
It could use a little more oomph; perhaps some minced garlic would help.
The suggested servings are way off. I found the original recipe as given to yield more like 6 to 8 servings, not the 4 servings originally suggested. So in the end, I wound up tripling the recipe for a church pot luck when I only needed to double it.

boring but good. I'd suggest peppering in some of your other favorite veggies to give it a little more flavor.

Family loved it!  I only had cream of mushroom soup.  For more flavor I topped it off with crispy fried onions.... great taste!

This really lacked in flavor. I had high hopes for this - it looks really good, but does not really do anything for me.

I couldn't find cream of asparagus so I used cream of celery instead. I also used elbow macaroni just because that's what I already had. It still tasted delicious!

Made this exactly to the recipe and the husband loved it. I thought it was good, and not hard so it gets my vote.

I used this recipe b/c I had some left over honey baked ham from Easter.  I used an extra can of soup (had to use cream of celery as the store didn't have cream of asparagus).  Also used about double the cheese. I also added some more spices such as garlic and a little red pepper.  This isn't something I'd serve company, but it was good and I froze some and it was good reheated for lunch.

This is OK, will not make again, there isn't any flavor.
