This was good but the flavor was too light. I think if I make it again I will drastically reduce the water. You don't need much liquid in the crock pot anyway.

I reduced the water to 3/4 cup rather than 3 cups (next time I ll probably do 1/2 cup). It turned out pretty darn good except next time around I m going to add twice the sriracha that it calls for. Paired it with jasmine rice and scallions with a drizzle of sriracha on top. Will make again!

This turned out pretty good. 1 pound of chicken breast has got to be an error though. 1 pound would not serve 4 and you'd be wasting a lot of room in the slow cooker. I think 3 pounds would be more accurate. Flavor was good but the sauce never thickened as I had anticipated so next time I will reduce the amount of water. Overall a good recipe but it needs some tweaks.
