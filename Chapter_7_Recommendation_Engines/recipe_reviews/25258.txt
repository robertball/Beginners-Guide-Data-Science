Good basic recipe though I recommend the following changes in order to make it come out DELICOUS.  Use real cheddar cheese instead of american cheese.  Use toasted bread crumbs instead of ritz crackers.  The crackers were mushy.  Using these changes, the cabbage was delicious, a great recipe.

This was incredible!!!! i added a few things though - i sauteed 1/2 of a white onion and about 3 chopped cloves of garlic in butter/olive oil and then let that drain along with the cabbage in a colander - i think it is important to let the cabbage drain THOROUGHLY (about 10-15 mins. in the colander) otherwise the recipe will be watery , like some other reviewers said and i also added  more cheese than the original recipe called for and some black pepper to taste- there was none left. Even my husband and kids who are not fans of cabbage tried it (for new Year's day) and they loved it !!!!  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't even boil the cabbage and used a raw head shredded (which keep it a little bit firm and not soggy) and used cheaddar cheese instead of american plus added shredded carrots and celery just like coleslaw. very good. i think recipe uses too much salt and you really need black pepper. next time I will use only 1/8 tsp salt and more pepper. You can add more veggies and improvise on this recipe easily. A nice variation from coleslaw and mac-n-cheese all at once.

Truly excellent! Neither my hubby nor I like cabbage but felt the need to choke some down on New Year's Day, and I'm so glad I found this recipe. Heck, I may even make it some other time! I read a previous review that stated they wished they'd doubled the cheese sauce recipe so I made 1.5 x the amount and it was just great. Should have drained the cabbage better, but I didn't know any better. This is a FIVE STAR recipe. It received rave reviews in my house. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Pretty amazing: out of the ubiquitous cabbage comes a delightful side-dish, creamy and versatile. Wonderful.

Excellent!  I prepared this almost to the letter - except I mixed the melted butter and flour together before adding milk (I added more than a cup of milk) and I just added several slices of American cheese bc that's all I had in the house.  It came out great - no leftovers.  A great recipe - especially because you can make it with pantry staples.  Thanks!

Thanks Beth. Great recipe, allows for a lot of variation. Cabbage was on special this week and I rarely buy it because I boil it and I like it but, well, it's just plain old cabbage. This recipe was more of a discovery for me, that I could actually doll up cabbage. I used 3 cheeses, equal parts (about 2oz. each) of Velveeta, Sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack. I had some heavy cream instead of milk and topped it with the crackers. I added a little margarine to the cheese sauce too and melted it all in the microwave. I initially microwaved the cabbage too. Then I baked the assembled casserole in the oven. Easy, and the sauce was marvelous. But the concept of any kind of cheese sauce on the cabbage is one I will do over and over. I won't deduct any stars but my version wasn't, by any means, low-cal.

Sorry, but there was no one who really liked this. I thought it was ediable if doused in S&P. I don't know why (b/c we love cabbage) but we didn't care for this and I followed the recipe to the letter.

I will make this recipie again. I used cheddar cheese.  I forgot if I added garlic or not, but I am thinking I did.  And pepper is a must.  I did use the crushed buttery crackers but left them in bigh chunks.  Very yummy.  My husband loved it.  Mine was a little watery, so make sure the cabbage is well drained and that the sauce in nice and thick before adding it.  A keeper!

Great recipe! I will be serving this one again and it is going in my Favorites folder! I modified my recipe slightly... 3 tbs flour, 3 tbs butter, 1 3/4 cups Milk and 1 1/2 Cups packaged shredded Cheddar Cheese. In the Cheese sauce I added 1/2 tsp Garlic powder and 1/4 tsp White pepper.  Then to top the casserole I lightly covered it with Panko bread crumbs then sprinkled it with French's French Fried Onions.
I could have eaten the entire Casserole!!!! I will serve this again, Thanks for the recipe it is awesome!

This dish was AWESOME!!! I fixed for New Year's day since we traditionally have cabbage for New Year's. This takes the plain ol' vegetable to new heights. This is what I did: (1) Cut a medium-size head of cabbage and boiled it for about 7-8 minutes and drained it for at least 2 hours (so the dish wouldn't be watery.) (2) Chopped a medium-sized onion and sauteed that in 2-3 tablespoons butter then I made a roux (3) Added the milk (I used at least 2 cups) and added cubed Velveeta and also added some pepper and garlic powder. (4) Sprayed a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray and put in half the well-drained cabbage, poured half the chedder cheese sauce over the cabbage and sprinkled some shredded Cheddar cheese over.  Then I put the rest of the cabbage on top and poured the rest of the cheese sauce and covered with shredded cheese and bread crumbs.   (5) Covered with foil  and baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees. My husband has even asked me to make it again. I will definintely make this every New Year's and many times during the year.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is FANTASTIC!!  I've served it for company 3 times, and they all want the recipe!  I did add a little garlic powder, some pepper, and a little bit of finely chopped onion.  Instead of the crackers on top, I used a can of french's fried onion rings.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This a great dish. I did not cook cabbage first. I just cut it up and put it in the baking dish. Did as directed on sauce but I use a 8oz block of mild cheddar cheese instead of american cheese. I topped with plain panko bread crumbs. Baked until top browned. Turned out GREAT!

I love this dish, it's so rich and cheesy. My mom made this when we were growing up and it was so good it got all us kids to eat cabbage! I double the sauce recipe, including the cheese, and add a little garlic powder. Also, I use lots more crushed crackers for the topping and drizzle them with liquid margarine. Sooooo good!

I thought more sauce was needed for a medium cabbage, so I doubled it. The result was just perfect for us. I also used cheddar cheese. We really enjoyed it! It's great to have another cabbage recipe, I'll definitely make it again. Thank you, Beth.

Absolutely wonderful. Very versatile (which is a sign of a good recipe). I steamed the cabbage instead of boiling it and sautéed 1/2 onion in the butter before adding the flour and milk. I used a couple slices of American cheese as well as added black pepper.  I also had some French's Fried Onions in my cabinet, so I used them with a few crushed saltine crackers for the topping.  My three year old ate it, (she doesn't like cabbage) so this recipe is definitely a keeper!  It's a great dish to take to a family gathering. Easy to make as well. If fact, you can mix it up the night before and put it in the refrigerator. Then all you have to do is put it in the oven (it will take longer to cook because it will be cold). Just add the topping after it starts to bubble.

Great cabbage recipe.  As suggested by other   reviewers I skipped boiling the cabbage and used a combination of American cheese and Monterey Jack and it came out great. I also added a little chopped onion and garlic.

What a great recipe for cabbage other then coleslaw.        Everyone raved about it.  I did add a few shakes of red pepper.  The second time I tried it with sharp cheddar.  Think we will be satisfied with mild cheddar.  Also I used flavored breadcrumbs and it still turned out great.  Thanks

This was excellent.  Everyone at a family get-together liked it.  I am not a processed-cheese fan, so I used shredded cheddar.  Just let the sauce cool a couple of minutes before adding, otherwise the cheddar has a grainy texture.  I will make again and again.

I think this is a great basic recipe.  However, to me it only deserves 4 stars.   To make it 5 star worthy it definetaly needs some adjustments.  There is no right or wrong way to fix this recipe.  You don't have to listen to me & make it step by step the way I did.  I suggest that you try it & play around with the ingredients to make it to your own preference.  Again, I really do think this recipe as stated is fine, but to make it GREAT here are a few things I would suggest.  1. Use a large head of cabbage.  2. Make sure the water is at a rapid boil before you put the cabbage in & then only boil for 5-7 minutes (or it will be over cooked by the time it comes out of the oven).  3. Make sure you drain as much of the water out of the cabbage as you can.  If possible, during the time you're making the cheese sauce let it stand in colander & drain longer.  4.  Use 1/4 tsp (or less) salt.  You can subsitute garlic salt or you could also use garlic cloves.  5. Use REAL sharp or mild cheddar cheese, or even colby jack or pepper jack.  (Try any combination, just make sure you use REAL!)  6. Increase cheese to 1 - 1/2 C, also sprinkle a little extra on top.  7. Increase milk to 1 1/2 C  (use more or less to make it as thin or as thick to your liking).  8. Omit the buttery round crackers & use crushed saltine crackers (don't forget to reduce salt!) Hope this helps some of you!  Don't get discouraged if you've made this before & wasn't happy, make some small changes & try again!

This was pretty good.  I salted and peppered it before baking, but it still needed more pepper at the table.  I didn't use as much cabbage but made the full amount of sauce, and it was a bit too much sauce for us.  The kids (14,7,5)all made faces but hubby and I thought it was okay.  I may make this again as an alternative to our favorite stewed cabbage.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I typically eat cabbage with polish sausage and onions.  Normally I just boil it in water with a dash of bacon fat.  This was a nice change.  It was quick, easy and tasty.  I did use regular cheddar instead of American Cheese.  We will definitely make it again. I also want to try the other scalloped cabbage recipe that is listed here and compare the two.

Thanks for this great recipe.  I made some changes based on the other's reviews.  I drained the cabbage for at least l/2 hr. to make sure I got most of the water out.  I also used pepperjack and cheddar cheese. I topped it with ritz cracker and sprayed butter spray on top.  Excellent.  I give it 10 stars. Thanks so much for posting this recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I love cabbage.  It is always great to discover a new recipe, especially one that tastes as great as this one.  I used red cabbaage just for the extra color but I'm sure any cabbage will do nicely.

This came out very well.  I did change it a little though, I used cheddar cheese and it was very good.  Will be making it again!

This recipe turned out alot better than I thought it would.  Like many others, I've been trying to find recipes for cabbage.  I also used shredded mild cheddar instead of processed.  It turned out really good and my husband ate almost the entire dish.

This needs a little work. I think the directions should have the cabbage shredded into strips as opposed to wedges to speed up boiling time. The sauce was decent, though it could stand to be increased by half. Also, this needs seasoning other than salt. I added ground black pepper and some mustard powder. I used marble cheddar for this, but I'd recommend a purely yellow cheddar in the future. Some sliced onions and minced garlic wouldn't hurt here either. Also, I found the topping unnecessary. It was nice to have a side without rice/potatoes, but next time I may do half each cabbage and potatoes. Served with "Cheesy Pork Chops with Spicy Apples" from AR.

I followed others ideas and sauteed the cabbage w/some garlic first. Then made the sauce in the same pan after placing cabbage in the casserole dish. I used American slices, Italian bread crumbs and a few saltines crushed up. It was just so-so.

Perfect just the way it is! But I also love it because it's so versatile, I can add just about anything. Veggies or meat. Made this for my best friend who is really picky and she ate it right up.

This was good and something a little different for us.  I didn't cut my cabbage into wedges, but instead I quartered the cabbage and then sliced it about 3/8" thick.  I steamed it covered in my largest skillet for 2 min., then stirred and steamed covered for another 2 min.  I doubled the sauce, used sharp cheddar and panko tossed in a little butter.  Added a little parsley to the crumb mixture for color.  I made this early in the day, covered and refrigerated it without the crumb topping.  Because I had refrigerated it, it took probably 40 minutes to bake and then I slipped it under the broiler to give the crumb topping a nice toasted appearance.  This is something a little different to do with cabbage, so give it a try.

I make the same recipe that was my Grandma's.  You have to make sure you drain the cabbage in a colander for a long time.  I let mine drain for at least an hour.  I always use plain old slices of American cheese.  They melt down beautifully.  Just add as many slices as you want to make it as cheesy as you like.  My Grandma always topped hers with crushed saltines so that's what I use.  I'm sure the Ritz would be good too though!

We thought this was so-so.  My family said it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be, but it was very bland.  I found myself shaking a lot of salt on, and I'm not usually one to add salt to my food at the table.  I had a lot of leftovers, and I doubt it will get eaten.

ok you may be leary to try this recipe, but do it.  i wasnt sure of it at all, but its really good.  my head of cabbage was a little too small, so there was a little too much sauce for me.  my hubby loved it.  if your family loves cheese, youve got to try this one.  it would be so easy to sneak in other veggies with the cabbage, like onions or squash.  this would be excellent with yellow summer squash chopped up in it.  very good.  although i did have to add a touch of cayenne and some pepper.  it is VERY important to use american cheese.  it makes it smoothe and creamy and not stringy and sharp like cheddar.

This was fabulous!  As one reader suggested, I did saute some chopped onion in the butter before adding flour and milk and added a little cayenne pepper.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was simply delicious.  I love cabbage, but my fiance will not go near it.  However, he loved this.  I took advice from other readers and let the cabbage drain for a bit longer...this helped a lot.  I even tried it with crumbled bacon.  It was delicious also.  This one goes in my recipe box.  Thanks Beth for a great recipe.

I thought this was OK, but I don't like cooked cabbage. People in my family that do thought it was good. I used cheddar cheese, but the sauce wasn't very cheesy. Next time I'll use a cup of cheese. I would definitely recommend pre-cooking the cabbage like the recipe says.

I recently tried this cabbage recipe, since I didn't have the crackers for the topping I used flavored bread crumbs.  Also I added a small amount of pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the cheese sauce.  This is a recipe that I will serve again. Thank-you Beth!

I made this dish for a church pot luck and it was very good, except that the next time i would chop the cabbage to a medium size rather than the thin wedges that the recipe calls for.  The original would probably be fine for a family dinner, but the longer parts of the wedge cut made it difficult to dish up.

This was great!  Totally surprised.  Boiled the cabbage for 7 minutes and let drain for a couple of hours and used an Italian mix cheese blend, (that's what was on sale).  We will definitely be eating this over and over.  Delicious and easy.

Cabbage is so good for you that I am always on the lookout for new ways to cook it.  This is kind of bland as written.  Do not forget to add  at least one onion-two would be better.  Needs more pepper and salt to give it more flavor. Personally-I dont think it needs the cheese because it kind of takes away from the cabbage flavor but I like cabbage so that being said, This would be a GREAT starter for someone to does not like or has never tried cabbage.  Boiling the cabbage for 10 minutes-makes it kind of limp.  Also  it garlic would be great to add a little flavor to this also.  It  is not the most pretty dish-kind of flat looking but next time i am going to shread a little carrot and dice up some celery to add color and bring more flavor to it. It is a good base recipe.  You could do a lot with it.

This is delicious!  (and I'm not a great fan of cabbage) As suggested, I drained the cabbage in a colander while I whipped up the béchamel.  I used the aged cheddar I had on hand instead of American, and since I didn't have enough crackers I added some Panko crumbs to them.  Yum, yum!  Will make again!

3.5- could be better with some adjustments.  I think I will add some onion next time.  I also used a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesean cheese for the top, but I'm thinking the Ritz crackers would have been delicious.  This is a very creative use for cabbage, and I'm sure we'll make it again soon!

OMG, this was wonderful!! I did take the advise of another member and did not boil the cabbage.  I sauteed it with a bit of onion and garlic, then added S&P to taste (lots of pepper).  Put it in the dish, and made the sauce in the same pan.  Then mixed it well, covered with seasoned bread crumbs (didn't have crackers) and baked.  This is a keeper!!  Husband loved it, as did I.

Very good! I did what others recommended: used Cheddar cheese, saltine crackers and drained the cabbage for an hour before putting it in the oven. Everyone loved this except for my 17 year old son...go figure!

I was out of swiss & used cheddar instead. I pan sauted the cabbage, then made the sauce in the same pan. Saved a couple of things to wash that way, and it came out really well. Thanks for a great recipe!

It's plain-jane mac and cheese, but with cabbage instead of mac.  Tastes fine.

When I bring this dish to someone's table and tell them what it is they look at me as if I'm crazy.  If i can get them to taste it, they go nuts.  It's quite easy to make and qualifies as comfort food.

It turned out too bland for our taste. So having this surplus of scalloped cabbage, on clean out the refrigerator night one day later, I made enchiladas with the left over cabbage instead of beans as part of the filling. With the addition of enchilada sauce, more cheese, pork and sour cream it was excellent. But too much trouble just to make as a filling for enchiladas in the future.

Next time I make this, I will double everything but the cabbage. We're not huge cabbage fans in my family, so the more cheesy crumbly topping, the better.

This is an good recipe.  A little on the bland side, but you can add some seasoning to spice it up if you desire.

Wow, this was great.  I added a little more cheese than the recipe called for and it turned out terrific.  Thank you for a wonderful variation on cabbage.  I will definitely make this again.

My Mom used to make this. Kids eat their veg.  Make your sauce thickish...  will help with moisture. We use soda crackers which we rub with Margarine or butter between our hands and put it on top toward the end of cooking the casserole.  This topping can also be browned in a skillet and added to top individual servings at the table...toasty AND stays crunchy. Yummy.  Can also be done with broccoli or cauliflower.  Even Kale..not my fave tho.

I made this tonight. I pretty much followed the recipe. I usually read the comments before I make any recipe to see others suggestions and problems. I saw people said the cabbage was soggy after they steamed it. So in order to avoid that I sautéed the cabbage along with an onion for about 10 minutes. No soggy cabbage. I also used shredded Cheddar Jack cheese instead of American and bread crumbs instead of the round crackers. I would make it again.

A great way to have cabbage.  Or. . . a great way to skip the pasta.  My husband said it was as good as mac and cheese.

A touch bland until I added another 1/3 cup cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Good as written, better with the less healthy additions.

four stars, as written, it's a little bland. But it is a great base recipe to work with...
I added a large sautéed leek, 2 cloves garlic, and 1/2 cup of chopped celery leaves to the sauce. (I grow my own leeks and celery and garlic and cabbage!). I roughly chopped the cabbage and steamed it in the microwave until hot and semi tender, about 12 minutes, then drained it. There wasn't much liquid though. 
Since my cabbage was large instead of medium, I doubled the sauce ingredients, and used bacon grease for half of the butter, for added flavor. added leeks and celery and garlic, sautéed it till tender, added the flour and browned it for a few minutes, then added the milk and made the sauce. Poured it all in layers in a 9x13 pan. Omitted the cheese because it had a great flavor already. used one teaspoon of salt since I wasn't using cheese and 1/2 t black pepper. topped with bread crumbs and baked until golden brown and bubbling. YUM!

I made some changes to this recipe. 
I added 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 Tablespoon mince dried onions, 1 tespoon dried basil. and 1/2 C sliced mushrooms to the cheese sauce. I used a Mexican shedded cheese blend instead of American cheese, in sauce.
After mixing cabbage and sauce, I place them in a greased - sprayed baking pan.  I put whole wheat bread cubes - made from toasted bread cut into tiny cubes- on top, then top the whole thing with another2/3 C of the Mexican shedded cheese 
The finished dish was tasty and had a nice crunchy top.

I never knew cabbage could be so good! Made with plain soy milk and was still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't sure about this at first, but it turned out fantastic! It reminded me of broccoli and cheese, which I love. I added some diced green chilis to mine for a little spice but other than that I made as is. I can't wait to make this again!

this is a great side when you want something cheesy but still want to get your veggies in. after reading reviews i finely shredded my uncooked cabbage w/ a carrot early in the morning. then rinsed it all in a colander and let it drain and dry out in the fridge. i sauteed some onion in the butter before i made the roux and added caraway, nutmeg, garlic, and some hungarian paprika since i was in the mood for hungarian tonight. a perfect side for Stuffed Peppers For Two. next time i will throw in a vinegar beet salad

This was ok, but it was lacking in the flavor department.  I even subbed seasoned bread crumbs for the crackers.  We like cabbage, so I might try this again, but I'd probably add garlic and onion.

Not bad, but not great.  Thank goodness I used seasoned, Italian bread crumbs in place of the crackers (none on hand)  It was pretty bland...added pepper as some suggested.  The crumb-topping gave it the most flavor.  Very willing to try again, but will add more seasonning.

I drained the cabbage for awhile to remove as much moisture as possible.  I also used saltines instead of buttery rounds, (I think it would have been too "sweet" otherwise.)  This was my first time cooking cabbage, and I can't wait to cook it again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was a little bit bland, but I really don't like cabbage too much. My fiance loved it, but I did add a chopped onion and some garlic salt. I also used a mix of american cheese and Cheddar, which I thought was good. There wasn't enough sauce for the dish- but that might have been me overcooking or draining too much.

This was very good!  It was a little watery so I think I will let the cabbage sit in a colander so that it will drain better.  I also used Velveeta cheese and I did not add any salt.  The cheese made it plenty salty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was a great way to use up some leftover cabbage! I didn't cook the cabbage before putting it in the casserole dish and it was still cooked and creamy with the sauce. I sprinkled parmesan cheese   on top with the crackers. Next time I will probably run water over the uncooked cabbage...to keep it moist and make sure the sauce runs over every piece.

This was good---Like Mac-&-cheese, but with cabbage.  I thought I had ritz crackers but I didn't so I used Italian bread crumbs in place and it was delish.  (Chedder instead of American)  The sauce did get a tad watered down (Water from the cabbage, I'm guessing) so I think next time I'll give my cooked cabbage a little squeeze with some paper towel before transferring to casserole dish.  This will be made again, Im sure, as my 3 oldest kids (aged 4-10)gobbled this up.

Pretty good. I substituted the cheddar cheese with feta, which is my favorite. I also used olive oil instead of butter and it turned out great.

I thought the recipe called for too much cabbage, but other than that no complaints.
