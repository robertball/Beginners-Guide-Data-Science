Good recipe. I make chicken gizzards and hearts all the time, and this recipe was simple but not alot of flavor. I boil mine for a few minutes, then throw them into a plastic bag with flour and Johnny's Seasoning salt, and black pepper.Shake until well coated, then take gizzards/hearts out and discard flour. Then I fry them in a pan over med-high heat with a little oil, until done. My fav. way of doing them.

MMM, this was great.  Only thing I did different was to add to the water some chopped onions, celery and a little poultry seasoning (I then save the broth to use when I've baked a chicken/turkey.  I'lll add this flavored broth to the drippings and it boosts the flavor and helps make more homemade gravy!)   Thanks for the recipe and here is to all who eat giblets - I thought my family was the only people left who did!!!   They have lots of iron and are very healthy for you -- when not fried...(sigh)!  :-)

It was chewy (but that's how they are) but not very flavorful. Wish the recipe had more flavor. I did use garlic salt instead of regular salt and that added more flavor. I'll keep searching for a recipe to use with chicken gizzards.

A VERY good meal for $3.50! I resisted putting spice in the water (just water and gizzards) while boiling them and they were much better! I spiced them up in the frying pan with salt, pepper, lemon pepper, turmeric, garlic powder and parsley-very good!

I think by themselves the gizzards got lost in translation.This recipe was disappointed.
