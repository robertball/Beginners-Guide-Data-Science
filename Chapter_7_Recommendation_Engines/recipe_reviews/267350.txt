12.4.18  I followed this recipe to the letter, so I don’t think I did anything wrong, but I ended up with pizza crust that was simply tough, hard, dry, and chewy after cooking for 12 minutes at 425ºF.  This rarely happens, I didn’t even take a photo of it.  Wish I could have given a better review as the first reviewer, but honestly, this was a total disappointment.
