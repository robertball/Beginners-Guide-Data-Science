Wonderful flavor combination.  I layered onions, potatoes, carrots and boneless thighs then poured broth with spices and parsley and baked covered for a total of 1 1/2 hours.  Last 30 min with raisins.  Easy and delicious with some crusty bread

Since I didn't have a lot of time, I used my steamer bag to pre-steam the sweet potatoes and carrots in the microwave.  This cut down the roasting time by about 25 minutes.  It was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

I really liked this! Instead of cooking it on the stovetop and then putting everything in the oven, I just put all the ingredients in a roasting pan, seasoned it, and baked it at 375 for about 1 1/2 hours; and added the raisins at the end. I also added a little cinnamon, garlic, and left out the cilantro and prunes. The recipe did not state when to put in the chicken stock, so I simply poured it over the vegetables before baking. There's a whole lot of flavor in this dish, and it's fairly easy to put together. Thank you!

Hello,

Nice receipt! Thanks for it! 

Do you think it could be better in a "terracota tajine"?
