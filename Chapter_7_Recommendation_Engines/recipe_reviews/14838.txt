I lived in Italy for 4 months and this is closer to a true bruschetta (pronounced broo-sket-ta).  Rubbing the garlic directly on the bread may make it strong -- but it IS the authentic method -- it's how they did it while I was in Italy.  One good suggestion is to drizzle olive oil over the top of the tomatoes. FRESH basil is NECESSARY for this recipe!!  Great, Authentic Recipe!!

I absolutely love bruschetta, and this recipe is authentic and very close to the recipe that I use, so I'm reviewing this one to put in a good word for it.  The only things that I do differently are to brush the bread with a little olive oil before toasting, and to leave out the onion and instead add shredded mozzerella cheese to the mixture.  Cooks, be sure to use Roma plum tomatoes; it's the only way to make bruschetta.  I'd also caution people to be careful not to rub too much garlic on the bread; it will overpower the tomato mixture and ruin the recipe! Which would be really, really tragic.

This was a good recipe.  I made some modifications:  use dried Italian seasoning instead of the fresh, added a splash of balsamic vinegar and added some salt and crushed red pepper.  The basic recipe just seems way too bland.  Even with these modifications, I would probably make it stronger tasting next time.  Overall, this is a great recipe...just needs some spicing up.  Would definitely make it again.  Enjoy!

I use less onion add minced garlic to the bruschetta instead of rubbing it on the bread.  Using dried basil works fine.  I always add some salt to taste.  For an extra treat, serve on top of homemade garlic bread or top with a little feta cheese or mozerella.  Mmmmm....

What a wonderful recipe.  Everyone loved it but had to keep a few pieces aside without the garlic. The children found them hot. I served them at a party where I had a basket of the prepared baguettes and people spooned them on themselves.  Worked out great!

I substituted a sweet onion for a red onion, and instead of fresh basil i used dried basil. I thought it was better using those, but i shared it with a class of grade 8's and about 93% loved it!

My family loves this appetizer even my 7 year old, I added a few things to give it a little kick.  I melted mozarella cheese on the bread and added fresh oregano, extra virgin olive oil, a splash of balsamic vinager, and a splash of apple cider vinager to the tomatoes.

Very fresh and tasty.  Beware when rubbing the garlic clove on the bread-- mine was way too strong!  It knocked our socks off!  I would also reduce the amount of red onion, and maybe add a little salt.

Delicious! Using fresh ingredients is really the key here, if not, the result is so much different! I made this one night for just me and husband and it was a delicious, easy snack.

Made these for a light lunch-everyone loved them! Very easy and quick. I did make the tomato mixture a little ahead of time so the flavors could develop.  Added a little minced garlic too since we can never get enough. Excellent!!

Made this recipe for my mom on Mother's day.  I skipped the onion and added shredded mozzarella.  I also baked it for an additional 2-3 minutes to let the cheese melt a little.  We both loved it, I'll be making these again soon.

This was good, but I left out the onion, I didn't want to over power the delicate tomato taste. I used super ripe heirloom tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes. I topped the bread with homemade pesto and then the tomato mixture. It was a great starter.

Went easy on onion; also tried no onion.  Both fantastic.  Brushed olive oil on my bread and sprinkled finished product w/ coarse salt.  Ate leftovers for breakfast.

I loved the Bruschetta at my favorite neighborhood Italian restaraunt, and wanted to duplicate it as close as possible, that was as good as it gets, my parents loved it, and it's a perfect meal in itself, if you're watching your weight and not your breath.

I made this with fresh basil from my herb garden,
and it is to die for. Followed the recipe other than
adding 1/4 cup of olive oil and an 1/8 cup walnut
pieces. Also minced the garlic and added it to the
pesto and topped with shredded Parmesan cheese.
I only got 8 servings, but I spread the pesto on
pretty thick. Fresh basil is a MUST for this recipe.
Five stars and highly recommended!

I thought this was good, not the best I have had, though.  The onion is too overpowering; mine actually ended up spicy.  Rubbing the garlic on the bread is a little time consuming and it also makes it very powerful.  Save some time and put just a little into the tomato mixture.  I agree with the others, add some cheese and, I used fresh basil like it called for but I think dried basil would have been fine.  All in all, worked out all right for the party.

This recipe was so fresh and a great partner for a good baguette. I added some fresh shredded parmesan and it was a big hit.

Delicious and easy -- even better if you add a little fresh shredded mozzarella on top!

When making this recipe I got a red onion that was too strong.  It overtook the other flavors.  In addition, I didn't think that this recipe was conducive to party hosting.  There was not enough time to toast the bread (watching closely not to burn it) and entertain guests.  I think that an important part to the recipe is that the bread is warm.

This was a great recipe for my first shot at Bruschetta. I added a few of my own touches, a little mozzerella and some chicken. But thanks so much for the recipe!

Yummy! Eliminated the onion, not a fan of raw onion. But fresh tomatoes, makes all the difference. This will be my go to Bruschetta recipe!

This is perfect. The only change I made was to add the garlic to the bruschetta mixture.
