For a family on budget, this is actually a pretty good recipe.  It seemed a littel strange to me at first, but it turned out pretty darn good.  I did season the steaks with pepper and garlic salt before I browned them.  ALso, instead of adding water to teh steaks to cook, I used beef broth.  I do think that they could cook for about 45 extra minutes...about 1 1/2 hours total.

This is a good recipe, but we found it to be a little bland. Don't get me wrong, It's a pretty hearty dish for a family on a buget. We just like alot of flavor. I spiced it up with thyme, basil, oregano, and garlic. Next time I make this I will sautee an onion and garlic with the steak. I also would replaced half of the rice water with beef or chicken broth for added flavor. All in all this is an easy dish to make.
