I made a couple changes, but this is a flavorful and unique way to use up leftover turkey. First of all, I used a product called Fryin' Magic, instead of cornflakes. I spiced the recipe up by adding just a touch of chipotle to the stuffing mixture. I then made a chipotle mayo, and served the patties on French bread, instead of cooking them in the soup. Turned out great, and didn't taste at all like Thanksgiving all over again.

Really good! The kids loved it too.
I did substitute half the breadcrumbs for cooked rice, healthy alternative. I also greased a pan and baked at 385F, for 15 minutes on each side to get it crisp instead of frying.
Cranberry sauce on top - mmmmmmmmmmmmmm

It's wonderfully flavored and a unique way to serve Turkey sometime during the week following having cooked a Turkey Dinner. I suggest freezing some of the gravey and then using it rather than the sauces suggessted.

I enjoyed these.. lots of room for creativity with this recipe. I use corn chexs instead of corn flakes because I had some in the cupboard.

This reminds me of turkey and stuffing.  I used grape nuts instead of corn flakes, which was good.  My Man liked this recipe, but I really did not care for it.

Good idea, and it was helpful while trying to figure out what to do with my left over turkey but they were pretty bland and I don't like the soup part. I made some changes that I thought were good, more turkey less bread crumbs, I also added cheddar cheese when making the patties as well as some bacon. I used 1% milk instead of half and half and add some garlic to that mixture. I got rid of the soup, baked them for 20 mins and made up a quick curry mayo to dip with. I thought this was great but everyone is different, feel free to try out my changes.

I really liked this but very bland.  I will add some herbs next time because it's a nice way to use up leftover turkey.  I added sauteed sliced mushrooms to soup for the gravy.

I made them larger for turkey burgers and left out the cream of chicken soup. This is my new go-to for left over turkey.

I made these exactly as written, except I used 1% milk 1 3/4 cup, and fat free evaporated milk 1/2 c.  They were very good!  I used Thanksgiving turkey that was frozen, and this is March. I love this idea to use it up without it tasting like just frozen Thanksgiving dinner.  There are dozens of variations possible, and I like the other ideas from the reviews.

These were pretty good, even my picky kids liked them! A few changes: saltines instead of breadcrumbs; added a little Adobo; 1% milk worked great in place of the half & half.
