So easy to prepare and has that fantastic made from scratch taste that you can't get out of can.  I just soaked the beans in my crockpot over night, draining off most of the water in the morning.  By the time you cook them for 12-14 hours, you really don't need to cook the beans seperately beforehand.  Browned the salt pork first before adding so the pork would completely render.  Added 1/2 tablespoon of cider vinegar to the beans right before serving to perk them up a little.

I'n giving this one three stars, even though mine were inedable.  The flavor was fantastic, but my beans never fully cooked.  I took the suggestion of a few reviewers and didn't pre-cook (did pre-soak) the beans and I'm sure that was where I went wrong.  I will try this one again, due to the "sauce" of the beans being really flavorfull, but will be sure to pre-cook my beans.

I served this yesterday for a New Years celebration and all I got were rave reviews. I only did a few things different. I did a quick soak on the beans and did not pre-cook them. I just put two cups of the soaking liquid in the crockpot. I followed the other directions exactly other than that I added two whole jalepenos to it (seeds and all) to give it a slight heat in the back of your throat when you eat it...it was so mild that my norweigen in-laws couldn't really tell that I had added it. The beans came out darker colored (normal when making them in the crockpot) but the taste is out of this world!! You must try this recipe!!!

I was looking for a basic recipe that did not include canned beans (too much sodium) and tasted like Mom's top-of-the-stove baked beans; this is a keeper!  Did not follow the recipe exactly, but found it the perfect base for what I was looking for.  My changes (and methods used): Soak beans in water overnight; dump all soak water then boil beans with fresh water (enough to cover beans) for about 20 minutes or until beans are soft and 'mush' between your fingers.  Next, drain beans; RESERVE & SET ASIDE ALL LIQUID.  Fry 6 pieces of bacon + one onion (both chopped) until bacon is brown & crisp.  Drain bacon grease, return beans, bacon, and onion to pot and add remaining ingredients:   -enough reserve liquid to cover beans,  -1/2 cup brown sugar,  -1/2 cup maple syrup,  -1/2 cup ketchup,  -1/4 cup prepared mustard (I used mix of regular yellow + stone ground),  -2 TBS apple cider vinegar,   -Did not use salt pork or molasses.  IF you like your beans less sweet, start w/ less sugar/syrup & add more later, if needed.    Cooking method: on top of the stove using my grandmother's "soup pot" (cast aluminum/ dutch oven pot). Dish is ready in under 2 hours (excluding overnight soak time). I also fry bacon and onion in this same pot, which adds extra bacon flavor to the beans, even with the grease drained off.    My beans have been on the stove top for only 20 minutes but I keep going back for another taste!  This will be a delicious side dish to go with our home made BBQ & slaw.

The recipe was good, and the beans were tender, but I had to add a few things to heighten the flavor. 1/2 tsp liquid smoke,1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup ketchup, 2 jalapenos chopped,and 2 tbls vinegar. I just like more taste.

I'm from New Hampshire so I've been eating traditional Boston Baked Beans my whole life so I know what they should taste like and I'll tell you this recipe is a winner! 

I shortcut the process by pressure cooking my beans, and even tho people have a fit I don't soak my beans anymore. IMHO it doesn't do a darn thing for the after effects or the taste and just takes up more of my time. 

Anyway, I thought the stuff looked a little strange when I mixed it up in the slow cooker, but I took it on faith that it'd turn out. I don't use a slow cooker often, so what do I know about what it's supposed to look like, anyway? I went to bed with the stuff going and when I got up in the morning my whole house smelled amazing. (Always a good sign)

I opened the lid on my crock pot, and oh happy day! Beautiful brown, sweet baked beans with a gorgeous thick sauce! People were practically pile driving into them at the BBQ, and the leftovers didn't last long! 

I'm a true believer now and I have no plans to ever make baked beans in the oven again.  To all you people who think you have to fiddle with every recipe you come across (which I admit I'm usually one of them), do yourself a favor and make this exactly as it says once before you mess with it; you'll be glad you did. I may someday sub out half the molasses with maple syrup to make it taste like my Vermont born and raised grandmothers recipe, but that's a nostalgia thing for me, not a reflection on the recipe.

I could not believe how easy it was to make. I tried making baked beans once before and they were awful. If this recipe had not turned out my husband would have been eating beans from a can for the rest of his life. He loved this recipe and we will make it again. Thanks.

Just like Mom's homemade baked beans that simmered all day in the oven, without the oven hassle!  These baked beans are the closest thing to baked beans I enjoyed as a child and the only drawback is still the wait - but well worth it!

This recipe is much like the way my beloved grandmother made her Sunday night beans, only way back then she didn't have a crockpot.  I made one slight alternation; I added a good-sized pinch of ground cloves because that's the way she made 'em special.  I love the crockpot idea, though.  So convenient!

Thought these were easy and tasted good.  Would have liked them a little runnier.  Will add more liquid next time.

Really excellent flavor.  This is a recipe that will find its way to my table on special occasions only because it takes awhile to cook.  I added a sliced kielbasa to mine and we had it for a meal.  Really good recipe--Thanks!

These were good, but I think next time I'll be making some changes.  I made a double batch of these for Christmas and followed recipe exactly.  First I would use Navy beans, not Great Northern, they are too big and get a bit mushy, next I will add more of the cooking liquid since the finished beans were a bit on the dry side.  I think the pork would be better if they were cooked first.  This recipe is a good base for from scratch baked beans which I've never had.  Thanks.

This recipe was pretty decent - I was looking for one that had good basic ingredients, not anything that is already processed and this fit the bill.  The beans were very flavorful and tasty - I'd make a few small adjustments and then I think this recipe would be perfect!  First, it might just be my slow cooker runs hot but I'd only cook them 8 to 10 hours, tops.  Mine got a little bit dried out and very dark.  Second, I'd add less sugar but keep the molasses the same as they were a bit sweeter than I'd prefer.  Otherwise, yum!  A great cheap recipe that makes a ton.  I would definitely recommend cooking these beans, then refrigerating overnight and reheating them the next day.  The flavor is a LOT better once it's sat around in the fridge for a while.  The leftovers were amazing!

These are the best tasting beans ever.  My fellow was the one who put this recipe together and instead of the salt pork, he used chopped bits of ham from a large smoked bone-in ham from Sunday's dinner, and also added 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 cup ketchup and about 1 Tbsp vinegar to the existing recipe, and it was perfect.  When he was precooking the beans, he had to add a little extra water once or twice, so they didn't dry up too much, but everything else the same.  No more Libby's canned beans for us.  This was better.  Thanks Creamcheese5.

Too long of a cooking time - beans were almost done after the simmer; didn't let them sit, just put all into crock.  Upped all the other ingredients by 1/2 again and added some maple syrup and vinegar.  The vinegar just makes it great!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I really enjoyed these!! I was pleasantly surprised. Growing up we always had beans and hot dogs once a week. I haven't made them in quite some time and was nervous making these. In the end they browned up really nice and taste wonderful.. just like the good ol days ;)  I used ham in my beans because i had some on hand i needed to use. I will keep this recipe. I followed directions exactly... and boiled the beans the night before. Thanks for sharing!!

I made this recipe exactly as printed, and it turned out perfect.   I've made other Boston bean recipes with soaking the beans and without soaking the beans, and always, always the recipes with the soaked beans were the ones that turned out the best.  I didn't have salt pork, so I used 4 slices of bacon. Next time, I'll try 6 or 8 slices. I found it wasn't salty enough with the four slices.  The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the recipe didn't say to wait 24 hr's before reheating and serving. These beans are 4 stars after the 14 hours in the crock, but they become 5 stars 24 hours later. Sort of like chili I suppose.  This recipe is a keeper, and one I'll make over again.  Theshoe

I took the advice of other reviewers and added another 1/2 cup of soaking liquid to the cooker, browned the pork first and mixed it all w/a pinch of ground cloves. After 12.5 hrs. of cooking time it was done. Ono! (Delicious). I took it to the neighbors for super bowl potluck & everyone enjoyed it..nothing was left. TY to the OP for the great recipe!!

This is an very good recipe.  I really appreciated being able to make this in a slow cooker so not heat up my kitchen by using my oven in  the summer.  I doubled the recipe to serve a larger group.  I did add just a bit more molassas and brown suger and just a tad of Liquid Smoke to the recipe but even before making those changes the favor was good and the consistency was perfect.  I will certaintly be making these again.

I love these beans.  I cut the recipe in half,  substituted brown sugar for molasses (but used less),  and crumbled a slice of bacon in instead of salt pork.  I also added some ketchup;  about 1.5 Tbs. Had to add some water before I saved them since I like mine juicier.  They were fantastic!!

This came out absolutely beautiful! I had most of the ingredients, except pepper; so I substituted it for Montreal Steak Spice (scythe I think is the actual name) and used the same amount. It does have a bite to it, but then again I like my food like that.

These were totally delicious. Maybe a bit on the sweet size for my pallet, but still fabulous. I used low sodium chicken stock for the cooking liquid. I soaked the beans overnight, and I did the first 2 slow cooker hours on high and the last six on low. Perfect texture. Making again this weekend.

I pre-cooked the beans as recommended. Browned the salt pork. Added a pinch of ground cloves. Yummy!

This is a great basic recipe for baked beans. I soaked the beans for 24 hours and did not pre-cook them and they were perfectly soft and tasty not too mushy. I added another cup of water in the crock because I like a thinner sauce and a tablespoon of cider vinegar for a little contrast to the sweetness. As to other posters whose beans remained hard after cooking- this has a lot to do with the age of your dried beans. Old beans take a really really long time to cook. Sometimes they do not get soft at all. It has nothing to do with the directions of this recipe. Which in my opinion would make beans slightly overcooked.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It is much too sweet for my taste.  I was trying to find a recipe similar to the canned variety of Grandma Brown's Baked Beans, but this is not it.

Flavor was pretty good, a little on the sweet side. Will certainly make again, but with a bit less molasses/sugar.

I only give it 4 stars because it was too watery. I found they had great taste! They were just runny and the flavor was watered down too. The recipe calls for 8 cups of water and I was not sure if that meant with the water drained off or not. alltogether I put in 9 cups of water. One cup from the reserved beans water, 8 from tap. Next time I will only add 8 total cups of water, and open the cover about an hour before they are done, just to thicken them up a little. Even runny they have been a great lunch at work over some wheat bread.

I used soldier beans and pure VT maple syrup as the sweetener. I love the crock pot deal...no watching a bean pot for hours on end. My only complaint would be that the beans sort of turn mushy.

Nice consistency, but a strange smell and aftertaste.  I think I don't like molasses.  Will try after they sit overnight.

The flavor on this was excellent.  However, it did not cook as indicated!  It says to boil the beans for 1.5 hours, which I did - and there was NO water left.  Thankfully they did not burn.  I had started it in the morning, thinking I would soak the beans longer.  I skipped the soaking and put it straight into the crock pot.  I had to add an additional cup of water since I didn't have any left after boiling.  I kept the crock pot on low and it was absolutely perfect by 2:30 in the afternoon.... and mushy by the time we ate dinner.  I'll definitely do this again, but start it later in the day so they aren't so mushy next time.  Again, great flavor.  

Next time I might add some bacon with the ham to give it a little bit more zest.

Neither my husband nor I cared for this recipe..  In our opinion, they needed something other than sweetness - maybe some vinegar or mustard, and MUCH less molasses...the molasses imparted a bitter taste.  Definitely won't be making this again - sorry.

this recipe is awesome, i will be making it more often. the only changes i made were, instead of 1 cup of water reserved after draining beans, reserve enough water to cover beans  also,next time i will use less onion, it was a little too much for us. but my family loved it and cant wait for me to make these again. GREAT FLAVOUR!!!

So good! My only problem was that I didn't cook before hand, just soaked over night, and because I was making a smaller recipe I didn't get to cook them as long so they were a little bit hard. But delicious in flavour!

Great, easy recipe.  I added a little salt and a little more molassess.  I did find the cooking time way off.  I filled my crockpot at midnight, set it to low and by 6 am the beans were done to perfection.

Finally, a recipe for baked beans that doesn't start with canned baked beans.  What is the point?  Anyway, it is a fine recipe.  I haven't made it for years and needed a refresher course on the ingredients and the proceedure.  I'm not sure why you cook unsoaked beans, refrigerate and then use a cup of it's liquid. But hey, whatever.  I used your recipe as a guide and it tastes great.

Crockpots/slow cookers are wonderful auxiliary appliances at any time and especially when preparing a variety of foods for entertaining. I was pleased to find these beans with 100% 5 star rating - at least preceeding me. I was really disappointed in them. I thought I followed the recipe exactly. I do this first time out so I can fairly evaluate the recipe as originally presented. Maybe I omitted an ingredient without realizing it but they were tasteless. I made them for my daughter's engagement party and saw the beans remained, uneaten on many of the guests plates. A good friend (who knows she can tell me what less familiar guests wouldn't) confided that the food was so good she was surprised that the beans did not compare.

I used bacon instead of salt pork.  Then I sautéed the onion  for additional flavor.  In the last hour of cooking I added a little  Vermont maple syrup.  Flavor was delicious. 
This basic bean recipe will be my go to recipe from now on.

I made the recipe as written, except I added some chopped onion. It was good and reminded me of Captain Ken's Firehouse Beans.  I would make the recipe again. It was easy to do and more interesting than canned beans.

I followed the recipe to the letter. Is was bland for my tastes. The liquid level was a bit much. If I was inclined to follow this recipe again, some modifications in liquid level and flavor intensity would be an absolute must.

I made this as written except I used sliced salt pork and removed before serving (not a fan). It was delicious!!!! Reminds me of my dad's Boston baked beans that we had every Saturday growing up in Massachusetts. Sorry Dad, these were better. These will be a regular at my house.

I searched carefully for a baked bean recipe that would be good for tailgating. Read the reviews and followed the instructions.  Only I browned the salt pork first .  It turned out exactly how it should have, dark brown color, cooked beans.  But i totally disagree with any comments on the flavor.  the beans were gross. disgusting.  perfectly done, but the flavor was lacking so much.  I should have known from the recipe. If you want molasses beans, this is for you.  If you want real, delicious, baked beans, this is NOT the recipe.

This turned out great. Tastes like baked beans should. I used pinto beans because that's what I had on hand, with chickpeas because I didn't think I ha d enough for my slow cooker (6.4qt). I only cooked them for 7 hrs instead of 12, but because I'd boiled them the night before (after soaking overnight), they were still nice and tender. I used two smoked butt chops for the meat, trimmed and chopped. I would definitely make this again. It's on my roster for "slow cooker night".

Easy and tasty.  Boiled the beans for about  an hour.  You can tell when they are done by blowing on them and if their skins burst, they are ready.    Sauce was sufficient.  I added a bit of Worcestshire sauce and a teaspoon of curry powder (Joy of Cooking recipe borrow).  Will make this again

These beans were easy to make, and make a good basic batch of "baked" beans. The flavor seemed a little sweet at first, so I added more mustard (1/2T or so liquid - not the dried kind ), dash of liquid smoke, and 1/3C ketchup. Couldn't find salt pork so just used bacon. Flavor was even better next day.

Let me start with I really liked the flavor of this recipe and I chose to make this one because it had a lower calorie count than others. I was a bit short on prep time so I used canned beans then tossed it into the crock pot. I cooked them a bit too long so they were dry, but still tasty. I will gladly make them again.

i soak my raw beans overnight then cook them with 2" water above the beans, a bay leaf and some onions until beans are tender. (usually 4-6 hours) then i use this recipe. i save about a cup of the juice the beans cooked in and add it to the recipe as well. Easy to prepare, and turns out perfect every time. my favourite baked beans recipe

This is good as it is. I see some people use traditional salt pork, others bacon instead. Both work well. I found a good compromise, if you can find them, is pork bellies, which are like really thick bacon. It has the fat but also more meat than salt pork. Three or four slices, cut into traditional salt pork type square pieces is plenty. Also, if you want to experiment a bit... A few squirts of worcestershire sauce offers a small taste accent.

Awesome, the best beans and so easy, make sure to rinse and pre soak the night before.. and remember the type of bacon you use will enhance the flavor. I found using the traditional salt pork, way too salty.... Enjoy..

These beans are cooking now, and my house smells amazing!  I will admit, I snitched a taste (you have to try something before serving to guests, right?) and they are very tasty!  I can't wait to have a serving with our ribs for our Canada Day celebration!  
These beans are easy to put together, and I followed the recipe as written.  I will add a bit of salt toward the end of the cooking time, and that is the only change I will make!

Absolute must to pre-cook the beans until they are soft enough to eat as is.  When you drain out the water you are also removing the undigestible sugars which is a good thing!

Easy to make and delicious; careful with the brown sugar - the first batch I made were too sweet - lightened up on the brown sugar to taste and they were absolutely delicious.

We made a few changes, but the end result worked really well.  For those of you who get crunchy baked beans but aren't precooking--that's the problem.  Unless you want to slow cook for even longer than stated, you need to cook your beans as directed ahead of time.  Otherwise, you have to cook your beans in the crock pot, which is doable, but not really how this recipe is intended.  Cooking my beans on the stove took less than an hour and a half--they were done closer to an hour, and I had no liquid to reserve.  It all boiled away, so it's a good thing I was watching it.  If you cook on the stove as directed, you need to add more water than 8 cups.  However, if you boil them, there is no need to presoak the beans as this cooks them properly.  As I mentioned, I had no leftover water, so I added about a cup and a half, plus a bullion cube to the beans, then added the rest of the ingredients.  I also added about 2 tbs of ketchup and garlic to the beans.  I left out the sugar initially bc I didn't want it overly sweet.  Then I refrigerated and hubs said he'd put in the crock pot before leaving the next day.  Well, I came home to an empty crock pot that wasn't turned on.  So we ended up cooking on low for about 6 hours and high for 2.  Hubs tried it, said it wasn't sweet or saucy enough.  So, I put it back in the crock pot today for about 1 1/2 hrs, put in sugar, water, and about 3 more tablespoons of ketchup.  Success!  More sauce, tastes like baked beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

Interesting recipe.  Would you believe it's the same recipe as in my old Better Homes & Gardens cookbook copywrite 1981?  In BH&G it's called "New England Baked Beans". The only diff is this recipe doesn't call for salt.  But the crockpot method is identical.

I read all the reviews and many had good luck with just presoaking overnight but I did not. My beans were still not done at the end of the day but close. Next time I will also precook them and hopefully they will be perfect. Did add more brown sugar as I like them sweeter, great flavor and aroma will try them again just presoak and precook.

Like other reviewers, I agree that the taste is great--very baked bean flavory. Also like some other reviewers, my beans never cooked fully in the crockpot. I pre-soaked and pre-cooked the beans per the directions.   Maybe I didn't pre-cook long enough, but I had to finish out the beans on day two on the stove and now I can't stand to look at the leftovers.  Oh, well. I gave it a go. Like I said, great flavor, boo on the crunchy beans.

I cooked this in the slow cooker the day before our bbq and I am so glad i did.  There was way too much water.  The day of the bbq I had to strain the liquid out and I added more brown sugar and molases and I also added bacon on top of if and slow cooked it again for about 5 more hours and THEN they turned out good, but not the best.  I won't be making this one again.

Absolutely AMAZING! I made these for my mom for our Easter dinner to go with the potato salad. She loves baked beans but most canned beans sodium content is through the roof (she has congestive heart failure & is sodium restricted)! So these were a blessing for our table! I actually doubled the recipe because I bought a 2lbs bag of beans rather than 1 (& I’m thankful I did!) They were amazing if you follow the recipe exactly but I did end up adding some ketchup and liquid smoke to the left overs and those additions made this recipe a 10! Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to making these again!

I used to make baked beans from scratch in the oven with the long baking time and they always came out mushy. Was hesitant to try this recipe but it was wonderful. Doubled recipe for a family party and everyone loved them. Finally a recipe I will use for baked beans!

Amazing.  Turned out just like the baked beans my Mom used to slave over for hours.  I did find however that I had to add water to the beans while they boiled, if I wanted that cup reserved.

As written I thought these beans were OK tasting...but pretty blan, and why I rated it a 3 star. I added ketchup, prepared yellow mustard, a few diced jalapeno peppers and some more brown sugar to help with the flavors. With these additions it is a 4 star recipe.

I can’t quite understand why I like canned beans, but not home made, I made Boston baked beans a long time ago, and didn’t like them at all, so I drastically reduced the sweet ingredients and it was still too sweet. I live in the U.K., so used Cannellini beans and treacle, I tasted them last night and thought they weren’t too bad, saved them in a dish in the fridge, portioned them out to have one portion today and freeze the others. I couldn’t finish today’s portion, the more I ate, the sweeter the taste, I’m afraid the rest will go in the bin, and I hope to find a recipe that has little or no sweetness.

Beans came out very tasty. The consistency of the beans got a bit mushy. I say soak the beans; but don't preboil for 1.5 hours the night before.

Sorry Bush's, but I will never eat beans from a can again! Super simple, very yummy.....no alterations to ingredients at all. I boiled my beans until soft (2 hours-ish) then to the crock pot on high for about 5 hours. Awesome!

Flavor was good, found it way too salty.  Next time I wouldn't add any salt.

Very good! I used Bacon and added ketchup. It was a hit and even better the next day!

Fabulous!  We omitted the salt pork (we're on a low/no sodium diet), and it was still wonderful.  The beans did come out somewhat thick -- we thinned them with more water before serving.  How wonderful to be able to have baked beans again!  Thanks!

I have to say, I was disappointed.  They turned out dry and tasted "strange".  I've eaten plenty of baked beans in my life and these didn't taste right.  I was looking forward to sharing a Canadian classic with my south american husband and I don't think he'll be willing to try again.
