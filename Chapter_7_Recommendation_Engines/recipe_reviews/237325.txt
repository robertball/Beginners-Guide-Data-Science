I marinated the chicken (three breasts equaling .8 of a lb) for three hours, using Sauvignon Blanc.  I pan-fried the breasts in olive oil for 5-6 minutes on each side, until juices ran clear.  I removed the breasts and sauteed 1/2 lb fresh sliced mushrooms and 4 shallots, adding 1/3 cup low sodium chicken broth when they had suitably cooked.  I mixed 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 1/2 cup lowfat milk until smooth.  When the mushroom/broth mixture boiled, I added the cornstarch mixture with a pinch of Herbes de Provence and stirred for 2-3 minutes until thickened.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve!  Amazing!

We really enjoyed this. The flavour was very good. I cooked the chicken under the broiler as I really don't like to fry chicken. Like the others, I strained the marinade and boiled it for a good ten minutes then skimmed it. To this I added about 1/4 tsp of low sodium chicken granules, parsley and a slurry to go over the chicken. The next time I will add the the chicken to the wine reduction for a few minutes. I served this with rice, mushroom and shallots that I sauted in a little avocado oil. Thanks for the recipe shark77, I will be making this again.

We liked this as a different way to marinade chicken. Next time I would cook the marinade into a sauce to serve with it.

Fantastic and flavourful! I marinated for 6 hours. I'm not a lover of frying foods so I actually baked my chicken at 375 for 20 minutes. They were big boobs, even after I flattened them. I also strained and reserved the marinade, boiled for 10 minutes and added a weak corn starch slurry to thicken it slightly. Served over the chicken before serving and it was delish! Used the herb recipe from this site http://allrecipes.com/recipe/herbs-de-provence/detail.aspx. This tastes a bit like chicken piccata. Works for me! Thanks shark77

Excellent!  I had a packet of Costco's organic chicken breasts so they are smaller than just regular chicken, and because of that I halved the marinade.  It worked perfectly, and I marinated them for about five hours.  I used Allrecipes' recipe for the herbs de Provence and AR's Papa's Seasoning Salt for the salt and pepper called for.  It was an excellent easy meal for dinner!  Thank you, shark77!

My family did not like this at all. The herbs were totally overpowering, and my family did not love the herb blend. I doubt I'd ever make this again, but if I did, I'd drastically cut down on the herbs, lower the wine and increase the OJ by the same amount for more orange flavor, add some orange zest, up the garlic and add at least 2 tsp salt to the marinade.

I found this very tasty and easy. In the future I'm sure I will tweak to suit my preferences.
