This was a good basic recipe. Very tomatoey and ketchupy though. As it is, it is alright, but not one of my favorites. I thought it was way too oniony so I ended up picking about half of them back out.

My mom and I loved this recipe.  I didn't have onions or green pepper but flavored the meat with onion powder and garlic powder.  It was easy and yummy!! Thank you!!

This is my FAVORITE sloppy joe recipe. My sister made them for me once and I loved them! She directed me to the recipe so I could make them for my hungry roommates. These satisfied the most hard working sailors! I made a big batch expecting leftovers but I swear they ate 5 each. If you're cooking for men, be sure to double or triple the recipe ;)

I have made this recipe twice, once with the green peppers and once without.  It's better with the peppers. They cook very nicely with ground beef, so you don't get an overpowering pepper taste.  I add the salt and pepper to the ground beef while it's cooking to enhance the flavor of the meat. Some reviewers said it tasted too ketchupy.  The longer you let it simmer, the more the ketchup will cook. I added about 20 minutes cooking time.  I think it will be a good base recipe to customize, but I do like it just the way it is, and so do my teenage boys, one of whom is a very picky eater.

It's super simple to make.  I am learning how to cook and started with this recipe.  Now boyfriend wants it weekly.  It seems to be his favorite thing.  I tend to put more green peppers in it than asked but I really like green peppers.  So it works for me.  :)

I actually made a vegetarian version using Tempeh.  I only used 3/4 cup ketchup, used yellow pepper and added a bit of chili powder - making it again tonight!

I made this last night, my family loved it. I tweaked it a little by adding green onions (because I had some in the fridge), a little more pepper than called for and instead of a cup and a half of ketchup I used a cup and a quarter and a quarter cup of barbeque sauce. Will definitely be making this again.

My boyfriend would like me to cook this more often! We were out of Worcestershire sauce so I  used my own spices, but it turned out great & I'll deinitely be adding it to our weekly menu.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Since I usually have all of these ingredients on hand, it was an easy, quick, and tasty recipe. I will definitely be using it again, especially on nights when I don't feel like cooking too much!

This was a lot better than most SJ recipes, which usually include some form of mustard to impart a weird tang. I did not have to reduce the sugar like I usually do with any other sloppy joe recipe. I added a couple drops of liquid smoke. My family disappeared the batch pretty quickly.

Only added a tad of mustard. I omitted green peppers only because I didn't have any--sounds like they would be good in this recipe.

I used a medium/large white onion, a whole green and red pepper, no Worcestershire  sauce and I added ketchup and mustard as I saw fit (maybe 2 Tbsp mustard and a little bit more ketchup than the recipe calls, I like my sloppy joes extra sloppy) then I added 1/2 cup water so that I could let it simmer longer. Also, I didn't have brown sugar on hand so I added a bit of lime juice instead for sweetness. A large variation I know, but it turned out amazing!

Really good. Tastes better than the seasoning mixes. Added a little bit of crushed red pepper to spice it up as well.

I added chopped garlic and a tablespoon of mustard for tanginess. It was really good. I don't make Sloppy Joes often as my husband doesn't like them. When I have enough ground beef, I make him a hamburger and the rest of the family enjoys this.

My husband and I both enjoyed these, simple to make and delicious. We topped them off with shredded cheddar for an easy week night meal.
