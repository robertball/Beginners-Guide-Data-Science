I really love this!  I've made it several days in a row.  It's protein packed- far more than regular oatmeal, so it's a great energy boost for breakfast, and a good source of calcium with all the extra milk added.  I did leave the oatmeal on the burner for a minute or two after the eggs were added, so I was sure they'd cook.  I also omitted the honey during cooking because the first time, it burned.  My kids didn't like this (I thought I could sneak the eggs on them) but I love it. 

It's a recipe you can play with too - I scaled it back to one serving and still added both eggs and it was really custardy and good.  If you like bread pudding and you like oatmeal, you'll like this. 

This is also a great recipe for expectant moms like me, whose doctors recommend a very high protein breakfast and three glasses of milk a day for calcium (hard to get those in!) - this meets a LOT of those requirements into one really yummy breakfast! Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe requires a little modification if you like your porridge thick instead of runny, that is why 4 stars instead of 5.  I added 2TBSP more oatmeal, and then still had to continue cooking on low after the addition of each of the eggs to reach my desired consistency.  However, at that point I was very pleased with the overall product.  I knew it wouldn't be sweet enough for my family, so I substituted 3 TBSP of brown sugar for the honey and mixed it in with the eggs. Then we sprinkled brown sugar on top... oh, and I used just a TBSP or so of half n half on top of each bowl instead of the quarter cup of milk.  Didn't have vanilla, so used a few drops of almond extract... and omitted the raisins as we don't like them.  It turned out delicious and I agree with the other reviewers, it packs an oatmeal breakfast with an extra protein punch so it sticks to your ribs!  Thanks.

When I was a kid, I had to eat oatmeal for breakfast and I wasn't allowed to dress it up with sugar, butter or even honey, so for years, the mere thought of oatmeal was enough to make me gag (I know, I know, Oliver Twist would've been quite pleased to eat my portion, even without sugar), but when I saw that this recipe tasted "custardy" I had to give it a try.  I'm glad I did! I used brown sugar instead of honey and I added 1/4 teaspoon salt. This will be great on cold winter mornings.

My husband and I basically enjoyed this recipe but were put off somewhat by the flavor of powdered milk.  There is really no reason why powdered milk has to be used, so if I make it again I will either use regular (skim) milk or simply use water.  It would probably also be easier to beat the eggs into the liquid before heating.  Otherwise, if you aren't careful, you could end up with streaks of cooked egg throughtout your cereal.

Yum, yum, yum! I love this recipe! I omit the raisins and I also leave the porridge on low heat for an extra minute while I stir the egg in. I usually add extra cinnamon and sometimes nutmeg as well and at the end I add about 1/2 a chopped banana and sometimes honey or sweetener instead of the butter and milk. It comes out lovely, warm and creamy and gives me energy! Thanks for a great recipe! I meant to say as well that I throw it all on the stove, hop in the shower and when I come out, voila - it's ready!

This was definitely the best oatmeal I have ever eaten.  I did change the recipe a little, though.  Since I was only making two servings, I halved the recipe, but used a cup of oats (I only had quick-cooking), added nutmeg, and only used one egg (how are you supposed to put in half an egg??)  The result was excellent, and my husband liked it, too.  Will definitely make this many more times.

This was really good.  I added more cinnamon (another 1/2 tsp) and I had to cook it a little longer to get it to a good consistency.  The first time I made this I put the honey on it - it was great.  Even my 3 and 5 year old boys liked it! The next time I made this, I added wild blueberry preserves to my serving.  It was soooo good - it tasted kinda like a blueberry muffin!!  Yum!

I have been eating this recipe every morning for about a week now. I have made so many different ways, like with almondmilk, with no milk at all, with normal  milk replacing the powdered milk, with and without vanilla extract, etc. The recipe is very versatile and i can change it depending on whatever I have in my fridge or feel like making. I fourth the recipe but keep the original amount of cinnamon every time. I love how creamy and delicious (esp with honey YUM) this recipe is!! I have never tasted any oatmeal quite like this!It has ton of protein which I need since I started P90x about 2 weeks ago and i love how it keeps me satisfied and full till lunchtime even if I don't eat lunch till 1 or 2.Thanks you so much Becky!!

I'm eating it right now.  Wonderful, creamy taste.  I made it wrong and it is still good, I scaled it down to one and I had 2 eggs in my head so added 2 eggs instead of 3/4.  So, I just cooked it a little longer to make sure the egg was fully cooked.  Used brown sugar instead of honey because I was out of honey.  I'm sure it tastes great either way.

This is a great filling healthy breakfast.  Both kids and the hubby enjoyed it.  I only had 2 eggs and it was still nice and creamy.  We didn't add the extra milk and I used brown sugar instead of honey.  I have made it quite a few time the past 2 weeks.  Thanks Becky!

Delicious and creamy. I used quick oats and it still turned out great!  The taste was similar to rice pudding.

This was like a custard-y oatmeal.  It had a velvety, pleasant texture, but lacked a little sweetness when made as written.  You certainly could sweeten it to your liking by adding more honey or even some sugar sprinkled on.  If you don't like oatmeal, though, you probably won't like this.

My 3-yr old asked me to make her porridge like the 3 bears ate in Goldilocks, so I found this recipe and made it for her.  I didn't think she'd eat it, but she really enjoyed it and so did I!  I did add a little brown sugar since I like my oatmeal sweet.

This porridge is wonderful!  (I admit, I don't really know the difference between porridge & oatmeal)  I like that it doesn't use sugar or sugar subs to sweeten, but that it uses honey.  I did not add raisins and left mine plain, added cherries to my hubs' and bananas to the bebe's.  All three were extremely well received!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I thought this was very good! I like warm breakfast cereal, so this was perfect for me. I did it exactly the way written, except I was a little impatient and added my raisins and vanilla right after it returned to a boil. :) I don't think it changed the overall taste any, but it did make the raisins softer (which I liked!). I will be making this again tomorrow for breakfast!

Very nice alternative to plain oatmeal, the eggs and butter really add something to this.  Definitely "custardy" taste.  Make sure to beat each egg very well and add one at a time.  I think it needs a bit of salt.

This is the closest I have ever gotten to getting my oatmeal-hating kids to eating oatmeal.  I knew that they would not eat it as written, so I added about a tablespoon of agave nectar and a tablespoon or so of Splenda brown sugar blend.  They also requested bananas, so I sliced those on top and gave them a tiny dollop of whip cream on top.  They stirred it all together and ate probably half, which is better than I was expecting.    I really enjoyed the creamy texture and I LOVED that there wasn't loads of sugar in it, something I have a hard time finding with 'kid-friendly' oatmeal breakfasts.    I hope to make this again.

This was really good.  I'll definitely be making it again.  My husband is away and I wanted a quick, easy supper for me and my kids tonight.  Even though two of the three of them swear they HATE oatmeal, all 3 of them finished their whole bowl!  I didn't have any powdered milk on hand so I used about 2/3 regular milk and the other 1/3 water.  I added a little more liquid than the recipe listed and cooked them a little longer (I like my oats really soft and chewy though).  I also omitted the raisins since 2 of my kids don't like them and served the porridge with raisins, blueberries and chocolate chips on the side so they could choose what they wanted to add (which they loved!).  I'll be making this for breakfast in the near future!

I really liked this the first time I made it. But have since changed it a bit to fit the taste buds of my kids. I make my oatmeal as I normally do (water, oats, raisins, br. sugar, cinn., milk, etc) but I add a Tbs or so of powd. milk when it's still on the stove, as well as an egg, for the added creaminess and protein. So, same idea as the recipe, but just scaled down.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I have two picky kids who I have been trying just about every recipe I find to get them to eat oatmeal. Thought this one would do it, but no so much. It came a lot closer than most, but i am still looking.... Thanks anyway! I will definitally make it for myself, though!

Very Delicious, and hearty :)  It tastes like oatmeal with custard.  I don't really like regular oatmeal, but this stuff is super.  I've shared it with a few friends, and made it for my husband (who really doesn't like oatmeal), and they've all given this recipe rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing :)

Very filling, and actually fills my toddler and me until lunch (hot cereal usually doesn't). Creamy. I love it! I cooked it a few minutes longer after addind eggs, just to be sure they were cooked.

Very good!  Creamier than regular oatmeal, we don't add extra milk afterwards, just brown sugar and honey.  Love the vanilla flavor.  Healthy and filling!

I scaled this recipe down to two servings and followed the directions as stated (except I used brown sugar instead of honey).  I thought it was okay, though I prefer Grandpa Hubbard's Oatmeal (also from allrecipes.com).

This is how I imagined porridge as a kid!  I cooked the porridge after adding the eggs, added sugar-free maple syrup instead of honey and chopped walnuts on top.  Whole family loved it!

This is a great breakfast.  My kids love it.  I do (for my own squeamish sake) leave the burner on low while I mix in the eggs.  I also cook it with 3-4 TBSP of brown sugar (instead of sweetening at the table).  It's filling, healthy and yummy.  I've also made it with quick oats and it's good that way too.

This is very good! I've eaten oatmeal all my life but never thought to add eggs to it. I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. My husband and I both enjoyed it but I still can't get my 9 yr. old daughter to eat oatmeal, even when made into "Mama Bear's Porridge". I'll keep trying but for now, this one will be in my file for Papa Bear and me.

My husband and our 21 month old son absolutely loved and inhaled this recipe, hence the 5 stars.  I don't care for eggs all that much, and while the eggs pretty much got incorporated into the oatmeal, they still gave it an eggy flavor that I didn't care for.  But that's just me.  It was a hit with my  family!

I love oatmeal and this made a wonderful breakfast for me this morning.  I left out the raisins and added a few spoonfuls of sugar while the mixture was cooking.  I halved the recipe since it was just me, but used 2 eggs for a more creamy texture.  Some of the whites did scramble a little, but it didn't effect the taste.  I might try this again using brown sugar and Irish Oatmeal.  Thanks for this yummy treat Becky.

Great hardy breakfast.  I used skim milk instead of water and dry milk.  I also added the eggs to a 1/2 cup of skim milks and whisked together.  This then needed to be simmered again to cook the eggs and get to the right consistency.  Yummy creamy oatmeal!

I make this again and again. I also used steel cut oats and oatbran instead of the rolled oats. My favorite: stir some nut butter in and let it melt in the hot porridge, really creamy and very filling.

This is amazing... I've always loved porridge, but this version is definitely the best.  I've never added eggs or vanilla, and I think that's what really makes it special.  I'm not a fan of evaporated milk, so I boiled the oats in soymilk for creaminess.  I prefer it without the milk and honey at the end, and just up the brown sugar.  Yummy!  I've even tried it boiled in chocolate almond milk, and walnuts instead of raisins...  This is my new favourite comfort food, and I've made it three times this week!

The four little bears in my household all loved this recipe!  I did make some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers -- continuing to cook while adding the eggs and sweetening with brown sugar.  It was definitely a hit with the kids.

Great taste and consistency.  I beat the eggs and mixed them in while the burner was still on to make sure they were cooked.  I also used brown sugar instead of honey.  Delicious!  Tasted very much like rice pudding.

This was really good!  I thought the eggs would skeeve me, but everyone enjoyed it (even our 3-year old!).  I did add the raisins while I cooked the oatmeal so they would soften a bit, but apart from that, I kept the recipe the same.  This definitely kept us full for a long time and was a really tasty breakfast.

If you dislike the taste of powdered milk, then you will probably find this recipe to be nothing more than 'ok' (thankfully, the rest of the ingredients mask some of the taste of the powdered stuff). And I even added a little less powdered milk than the recipe called for! Even my non-picky, oatmeal-loving toddler wasn't crazy about this one.

I just made this for my breakfast and it is amazing. I loved it. 

I scaled the recipe back to 1 serving; but still used a full egg. 

I didn't add the butter at the end but the porridge still turned out creamy and delicious.  

Next time I may omit the raisins and add a chopped apple to the porridge at the same time as the oats.

I'm an oatmeal hater and a raisin hater.  So why did I try this recipe?  B/c my cholesterol recently increased and I need to start eating oatmeal.  (Not sure if adding eggs cancels out the cholesterol-lowering effect of oatmeal- LOL).  The 'custard', tho not very custardy, made it better than an ordinary bowl of oatmeal, but what really made this better was the raisins.  For raisin haters like me, use GOLDEN raisins.  They make all the difference.  I didn't have powdered milk, used half water and half milk, boiled it in the microwave and nuked it again after adding oatmeal and cinnamon until good consistency.  After adding the eggs I nuked again, just to be sure.  I didn't add the milk or butter at the end.  Didn't need it.  I'd make this again.  Update:  Leftovers the next day were even better.

This is great. I can't wait to make it again. It is so filling, I made a big bowl but couldn't finish it. I only did one thing different and that was to add about 2 or 3 tsp. of brown sugar to make it sweeter. I also cooked it a few minutes more on low to make sure the eggs were done. I'm sure the hot porridge would have cooked them thoroughly, but I'm just paranoid.

This is sooo good!  I was really searching for a way to sneak some additional protein into breakfast.  Plus I love that you can control the sweetness by type, and by putting it into the bowl instead of the porridge pot.   Family members who "love" oatmeal ate this up, and those who just "like" it, like it more now.  I used brown sugar and I tempered the eggs before adding.  Thanks Becky!

Nice recipe.  I tried it this morning and even my 2 year old liked it.  I omitted the raisins because I didn't have any, but I may get some.  I also used quick oats because I didn't have rolled oats, worked fine and cooked quicker!  A little extra cinnamon helps too!  Good recipe!

We all love this!  It's best made with steel-cut oats from the health food store. Sometimes I cut the fat by using Butter Buds or butter flavoring and skim milk. I have to leave out the raisins for my kids, but I love it with them.

Wonderful recipe! This will be one of my go-to recipes. I halved the recipe since I was cooking just for myself. When cutting the recipe in half, it called for 1 1/2 egg but I used 2 and it still turned out okay but a little too thick I think. Next time I will add some more water to dilute or simmer for only 5 minutes instead of 10. Like other posters, I added the egg with a few minutes left during simmering part, just because I am paranoid about making sure it all cooked. The porridge was delicious. It's quite thick and I like how filling it tastes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I felt it was a tad too thick and because the powdered milk did come through a bit more than I expected (not in a bad way though, just it was just somewhat unexpected).

I used 2% milk not powdered and I added mashed bananas to the mixture as well as egg. I stirred in the cinnamon and sweetner. I also added bananas too the top chopped up for a nice look at the top. And it was very good!

I  used 1% milk instead of the powdered milk because that is what I had, but that was my only change.  I often add cinnamon, raisins, and or eggs to oatmeal but I never thought of add vanilla extract.  What a good idea!

I love oats in things.  Fruit and oatmeal bars, oatmeal cookies, bread with oats in/on top, hearty cakes or muffins.  Any fruit crumble I make must have an oat topping.  I even love oat bran for breakfast with salt and a little butter or cheese.  But I've never liked sweetened oatmeal for breakfast.  I tried this recipe hoping I would like it okay.  I liked the honey, and the dried fruit was good (I used dried cherries because it's what I had).  I had to use 3/4 milk and 1/4 water instead of powdered milk and water, and I liked the richness of it being made with milk.  I did not really like the custardy texture though.  The only way I've tolerated breakfast oatmeal in the past was if it was really thin and really sweet, so I actually liked this pretty well considering it's really thick and not really sweet.  I won't make it again, but I think this would be a great recipe for a child or elderly person or someone who has trouble keeping weight on (or even just a super picky kid) if they like oatmeal because it's bulked up with the milk and egg.

It was good - not too different that the oatmeal I make already; But I will add this one mod. instead of powdered milk I use evaporated milk and it makes the custard flavor really stand out - also be careful to remove the porridge from heat BEFORE you add the eggs, or you will end up with stringy egg drop porridge otherwise good recipe!!

Great recipe!  I added some brown sugar, as well as letting the raisins cook in the porridge for a few minutes to make them nice and plump.  I omitted one egg, because it would have made it too runny, and it tasted fine.  It certainly fills you up!

Really good. Note that I changed the serving size to 1, and then used 1 egg, 1 tablespoon soy milk powder, and put on a bit (unmeasured) of canned milk after cooking. Probably less honey than it called for too. Delicious and I will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful! I made it this past Saturday for my family and it was gobbled up! Even my somewhat picky 5 yr old liked it. I added some wheat germ for extra nutrition. Next time I will also add some milled flax. I used extra cinnamon and was glad I did although it would have been fine I'm sure with the amount in the recipe.
Will make again very soon!

I was really excited about this recipe; the "custard" description intrigued me. Unfortunately, my family and I couldn't really tell any significant difference between this and regular oatmeal. It's not that it was bad, just not... spectacular.

This was very good, both my husband and I enjoyed it; 19 year old daughter didn't care for it though.  I used instant oats and just cooked for a minute or two.  Did not add raisins and subbed 1/3 c. of brown sugar for the honey.  It was very creamy.  I used egg substitute and it did cook fully from the heat of the oatmeal, they didn't even know that eggs were added.

YUM...Very good and keeps you feeling fuller than ordinary oatmeal. I didn't have all of the ingredients (powered milk and raisins)used cup and a half water and cup and a half of 1% milk. Turned out great!!!
I am going to make this again with chopped apples.

This is really great!  I made a healthy version using nonfat dried milk, skim milk, and splenda.  (no raisins either...just because I don't care for them).  It was excellent...kept me full and energetic all morning.  Thanks

This is the BEST!  I won't eat plain oatmeal again!  I up the amount of raisins (or other type of dried fruit) and cinnamon, and don't use the honey or butter (less guilt after adding a bunch more dried fruit).  I also like to double the recipe and have leftovers - reheats well! Superb!

I like oatmeal and I like custard, but I didn't particularly like this.  I'd describe it more as pasty oatmeal than custardy oatmeal.  But then I like my oatmeal very thick and this wasn't.

I tried this recipe because I don't like oatmeal, and this recipe suggested that oatmeal-haters might like it.  I did not like it, and I did not find the texture to be as custard-like as I expected.  I didn't want to give the recipe a bad rating just because I don't like oatmeal; if you do like it, you'll probably like this.

This was very good, very simple, and VERY nutritious. I really felt energized after this. I didn't have any powdered milk, but I think it came out just fine-- I'll make it again with som powdered milk later. I had to add sugar as a preference, but that is because I was raised on sugar-drowned oatmeal. Mmm! I'll make this again.

I love this recipe!  As others suggested, I scale the recipe to one serving but add one whole egg.  I don't add the butter, milk or honey at the end - but I like my oatmeal unadorned.  My kids like the milk and honey, as well as the "Mama Bear" name!

This was a great recipe!  A totally "stick to your ribs" breakfast.  My children preferred it with white sugar (influence of Cocoa Puffs and instant Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal - YUK).  But the consistancy was very creamy and smooth.  Highly recommended!

I was excited to try this, but me and my two kids (nine and two) really didn't like this much.

We LOVE oatmeal and porridge as a rule...but I guess we just really did not like the addition of the eggs.  I am sure some will like this, but to us, it was just kind of slimy (even though I left the pot on the stove while stirring in the eggs...which I tempered first, by the way, to avoid curdling).  

We won't be eating this again.

This was REALLY good. It wasn't too sweet. You actually enjoyed the taste of oatmeal instead of the overpower of sweetness. The kids had to add a little more sugar to theirs, but they loved too.

Wow. I'm really surprised. This was actually really good. My favorite by far. I didn't think that adding eggs would taste good, but I used my better'n egg product, and it tasted great. However after adding the eggs it was already to moist to add more milk.

Only making it this way from now on! I didn’t add the raisins since I didn’t have any, and added brown sugar. AMAZING!

I made this for breakfast and 1/2 of my family liked it. It was very rich and filling. The nay-sayers said it was too rich. It reheats well, and keeps in the fridge.

Never thought to whip eggs into my Oatmeal...what a great idea!  5 stars just for that brilliant lightbulb.  I am diabetic, so getting the protein in at breakfast is important.  I cooked half oats and half quinoa in Milk and not water and left out the powdered milk, but added vanilla protein powder (I'm also going to try this with Almond  meal). Nice creamy consistency and definitely a protein boost in the morning. IF warming up left overs, be sure to warm on half-power...high on my micro set them up like a brick. One batch of this makes 4 breakfasts for me.

I've never been a huge oatmeal fan, but this stuff is great.  I split it into 3 servings and I was stuffed after eating.  I beat the eggs before adding. I did continue to cook the porridge after adding the eggs to the point where I felt they were cooked (but not overly dry), and it gave the porridge a great consistency.  I did have to add some water, so next time I will add the eggs a bit before the consistency is where I want it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is good.  Kind of like rice pudding, but with oatmeal instead.  I was worried that the powdered milk flavor might be gross, but I could not even taste it.  I am not a fan of cooked raisins, so I left them out.  Next time I make it, I am going to do brown sugar with maple syrup.

This is so delicious-like an oatmeal pudding- and so much more filling than regular oatmeal.  I do leave the pan on the burner on low while I stir in the eggs and then let the egg cook in for a few minutes.

Very yummy!  Added more honey and Brown sugar for my boys.  Used 1.5c water and 1c regular milk and only 2 eggs.

This is super delicious! It is thick, warm, and smells like custard. If you want comfort food for breakfast this is the way to go.

I made a couple small changes though. Instead of the milk products  I used unsweetened vanilla soy milk. Instead of 3 whole eggs I used two eggs and 2 egg whites. I also swapped bananas for the raisins as I don't like raisins.  The nicest part about this recipe is that you can easily make adjustments to suit your individual needs. 

I made a big batch to eat all week. Yum!

I make this for my three year old son all the time and he loves it.  He hates eggs, but does not know that they are in here, so I can sneak them in with this recipe.  Great recipe!

This was delicious and filling. I used milk instead of water and milk powder,  and brown sugar instead of the honey. Like others, I left it on the flame for a bit longer after adding the eggs.

This was fine until I added the eggs. We didn't like the flavor or texture once the eggs were added. I tempered them with a little bit of hot oatmeal before I mixed them in, so they mixed in really well and I did not have chunks of scrambled eggs in mine.

I used almond milk and steel cut oats. 8 minute cooking time. Before serving, I added pumpkin seeds, ground flax, chi seeds, and hemp seeds and a drizzle of honey. The kids loved theirs without all the added seeds and the adults loved it with all the added seeds! Apple chunks would also be a nice add.
