This is a simple potato wedge recipe that's a favorite around our house.  Rather than spreading the potato wedges on the baking sheet and drizzling the oil and adding the spices, I'll put everything into a Ziploc bag.  I'll shake it until the oil and spices are evenly distributed and then pour then onto the baking pan.

The cooking time was just right.   I did cut my potatoes into 8 wedges each, so they were a little smaller wedges.  I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil.  Tip:  peel the potatoes and place in cold water.  Cut them into wedges and then back into the cold water. Drain & DRY thoroughly, then coat with oil and seasoning.

We really liked these oven fries. I had smaller potatoes and cut each into 9 wedges. I really didn't think that the thyme would add anything to the fries and I was so wrong. I followed Baking Nana's advice and put the potatoes into water after peeling and then again after cutting. I did cut the recipe back by half but otherwise followed it as written. Great, simple recipe and so easy. I am really looking forward to trying the sweet potato version.  Thanks for sharing. Update: I made the sweet potato version today. The cinnamon didn't appeal to me so I used 1/2 tsp each salt, pepper, smoked paprika and garlic powder. Great flavour but I found that they didn't crisp up as much as the white version. Definitely a keeper.

It was very easy to make. They were very delicious! Instead of putting them on the pan  and adding the ingredients I put them in a bowl and added all the ingredients and mixed it all up! I recommend this recipe!

The thyme was a nice flavor. I tossed them in Parmesan cheese after they came out of the oven. Everyone loves them...even the kids.

My granddaughter helped me make these fries tonight. I left the skin on the potatoes, sliced to 1/4 inch fries, put them all in a medium bowl, added the spices and olive oil. They baked up delicious.

I made these to go with my tuna burgers. These were very simple and easy to fix. The only things I did differently were to cut the potatoes in 8 - 10 wedges depending on size. I was aiming for cooked through and crispiness. And I tossed the wedges in a bowl with the oil and the spices and tossed til evenly distributed. The cook time was good for this. And I didnâ€™t use cheese.

These were really  simple and tasty.  They  make a good sized serving. We made half and it was plenty for the four of us. Did not add cheese at the end but will try next time.

These are really good and soooo easy. i include one more step which i believe makes them even crispier.  soak your cut fries first for 15-30 mins in cold water. drain, blot and dry as much as possible, then season and proceed. YUMMY!

I liked this recipe, it cooked really well. The only thing I did different was I used coconut for the oil.
