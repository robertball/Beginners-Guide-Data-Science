Have been making these regularly since I found the recipe in Chef John’s cookbook, “Americas Family Favorites: Best of Home Cooking” in 2011. Through my own tinkering, I now substitute Onion and Garlic powder for the Poultry Seasoning.  I allow the chops to come to room temp, and lightly sift and pat in a coating of flour on them prior to frying, shaking off any excess. Follow the balance of instructions exactly. The wife and I enjoy Roasted Garlic Cauliflower from AR as a side. Good Stuff!

I just wish I could rate the other raters for not following the recipe!
This recipe was outstanding the way it was presented. The onion gravy was just the topper for a well prepared Bone-in Pork chop that I found amazingly tender and flavorful.

Thank You Chef John.

This is SO very good.  I've made it three times now, first two times making it exactly to Chef John's directions which is worthy of my 5-star rating.  A hint: when carmelizing your onions, let them sit in the pan and cook; don't be tempted to stir them up every minute as they won't carmelize well.  It takes a while to get the right color so be patient.  I let my onions go about 25 minutes to get the right color and consistency, only moving them around maybe once every four to five minutes.  Another excellent recipe; thanks very much Chef John.

Just made this for dinner and WOW! I can't say enough good things, it was fabulous! The only change I made was that I didn't have any buttermilk so I subbed sour cream for a little tang and it still turned out amazing. Served it with buttered noodles and broccoli, delicious! Thanks chef John!!!!!

well when I talk smothered with onions, I feel one onion for 4 large bone in pork chops, 1 onion is not enough, I used 3 onions and adjust the other ingredients, and was delish, now I give mine a 5 star

OMG! Delightfully delish ... and stunningly easy. My 2 bone-in chops were about 1-1/2" thick, so I adjusted the recipe slightly. I used one large and one small onion (thinly sliced), 3 glove garlic, 1-1/3 c. broth, 3 tbsp. flour, 3 tbsp. buttermilk, and 3 tbsp. water. The consistency was perfect. I also added about 1 tsp. of thyme because I'd seen it mentioned in so many other recipes. It adds a nice touch but (honestly) the recipe is fine without it. For those who don't have buttermilk on hand, not to worry: neither did I. I poured 1/4 c. milk into my measuring cup, then added about a tbsp. of apple cider vinegar and let it sit. Even at that I had to toss some of it out, but it was worth the extra (albeit minimal) effort: it adds a nice tang to the gravy. Finally, I used a cast iron dutch oven to make this in because ... well, I'm gaga for cast iron. I think it adds to whatever you use it for. This is for sure a keeper. Thank you, John!

Delicious recipe! How anyone could find this recipe bland I have no idea because it was anything but bland. Maybe they didn't caramelize the onions as instructed?  Which is an important step for this sauce. It had lots of rich, full flavor. The only modification I made was for the poultry seasoning I used Adolph's Seasoned tenderizer since my family doesn't like regular poultry seasoning.  The spice set is perfect for this recipe.  It has garlic powder in it but I sprinkled a little more on the chops before searing them; no need to salt since Adolph's has salt in it or you could just use garlic powder, onion powder and salt instead.  If you plan on serving over rice, pasta or even potatoes, for that matter, you might want to consider increasing the sauce to 50% more since it didn't make quite as much as we wanted. The sauce is wonderful! I served over some ridged elbow pasta with fresh steamed green beans sauteed in a little olive oil, fresh minced garlic, kosher salt and freshly grated black pepper. The chops were gobbled up with a definite request for this one to be a regular in our house. It will replace my another smothered pork chop recipe I've been making for years.  Thanks Chef John for another fabulous recipe!!

So good! I made this with a bone-in pork steak and let it simmer a bit longer in the gravy while covered loosely with some foil. Nice change from the can of mushroom soup gravy often found. If you don't want to buy buttermilk use the shot of lemon juice in milk trick.

This was fantastic! I didn't have poultry seasoning on hand, though, so used Penzey's Bavarian spice blend (which is my go-to for pork - delicious) and it tasted phenomenal!! I agree with other reviewers - it is a little labor-intensive so not something you would make in a hurry. But oh, it's worth it! Don't skimp on the time it takes to caramelize the onions, and don't skip the buttermilk either. Both are key to making this one delicious dish... Served it over egg noodles with green beans on the side. And keep rolls or bread handy to sop up any extra gravy!

Absolutely delicious! The only thing that I did different was that I brined the pork chops in the fridge overnight so to ensure tenderness. Tip: If you don't have a large enough of a skillet: brown the chops in 2 separate batches.

Having read the recipe and the reviews, I would offer my version of Chef John's smothered pork chops. Take the buttermilk that you probably bought a quart of and use 2 cups of it to make a marinade with the garlic, salt and pepper and put it in a plastic bag with the pork chops and marinate the meat for up to overnight. The buttermilk will soften the meat fibers and you will find the resulting cooked pork very tender. Take the chops from the marinade, pat them dry with paper towels and proceed with Chef John's recipe as written as I did. Yum, those cooked onions with the hint of heat from the pepper flakes were a crowd pleaser. Chef John is such an asset to this website but even he would agree that tweaking some of his creations can please everyone at your table as this recipe did at mine.

Followed this recipe to a T.  It was wonderful and dare I say, the best pan sauce/gravy I have ever made.  Make sure you add the drippings from the pork chops and sauté the onions slowly the ENTIRE time required.  What you end up with is a gravy to die for.  Served it with Chef John's Mashed Potatoes and corn.  Delish!

Hands down, the best pork chop dish I have ever made.  Only change, I did not have any buttermilk, so added a little vinegar to milk.  Not a difficult recipe.  Minimal ingredients.  Winner! Winner!  Pork chop dinner!

This was delicious! The gravy that was made with the onions was so rich and lovely over the chops and some mashed potatoes that I also made.  Take the time to really caramelize those onions. The buttermilk really added a nice touch, try not to leave that out.  Will make again.

Very nice!  For those who didn't have buttermilk, try wisking a small amount of lemmon juice into the milk.  If too tangy, add a little sugar.  Thanks Chef John ands good luck everyone!

Loved it. Made it with mashed potatoes & steamed mixed veggies.  I have a family member who has to eat gluten free so I used so used my own all purpose Gluten free flour mix. I would cut down on the flour because my mix made the gravy very thick. Easily fixed by thinning it out with more chicken stock & buttermilk. Thanks Chef John we really enjoyed this.

Absolutely delish! My kids even gobbled it up and they are not onion lovers! I served this with an Asian inspired rice with sesame oil and peas, so with that in mind I used a good quality low sodium chicken broth and added a few dashes of soy sauce to the gravy.(and no added salt)I used olive oil instead of butter and skipped the buttermilk because of dairy allergies (just added extra broth), the gravy/sauce was still rich and delicious and everyone had seconds! A perfect weeknight meal!

Made this as written except dusted chops with flour before frying.  Sauce wasn't as thick as i had hoped, I will try to figure that out next time i make this because the flavor was amazing!!!  Served over Egg noodles, will try rice next time too.
Ok made this again and this time I still floured the chops browned them but added more onions, added ground thyme and subbed sour cream for the buttermilk and the gravy was thicker and amazing over basmatic rice!!! YUMMY

This was pretty good.  I made it exactly as the recipe reads except I used a red onion and two large one inch chops so I had lots of delicious gravy! I'm looking forward to trying more of Chef John's recipes.

We really enjoyed this, I omitted the salt on the pork chops and used salt free chicken granules to make the broth since I am on a low sodium diet, I used a very large onion to ensure enough for everyone, served with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

The Onion Gravy part was absolutely divine!! But, for whatever reason, the pork was tough as nails, and I can't figure out why. So very disappointed, I was looking forward to fork tender pork. Used bone in pork, all other ingredients as listed, as well as techniques. I've rarely been a pork fan because of the toughness, but I had high hopes for this, and it simply didn't work. We'll enjoy leftover gravy with noodles and peas tomorrow.

Loved cooking this for my family.  The only reason it has a 4 instead of a 5 is because this by the directions did not make enough gravy for us to use over our rice as well as the chops.  I am a novice at cooking so I really appreciate the recipes on here as well as the reviews.

The gravy tasted bland and didn't look particularly appealing on the plate. Maybe this one just isn't my thing.

Really good.  My chops were a bit over 1 inch.  My ruler's 1 inch and the butcher's 1 inch vary by 1/4 inch (I know it's a man thing).  However, I just put them in a smaller pan after doing the sauce, and was able to "smother" them properly.  Would NOT change a thing.  Cooking times are approximate as Chef John states.  I cooked my chops until cooked through and tender - but remember some people - pork chops have a special consistency.  They have a little tooth to the bite, and that's as it should be. Oh - being single, I had two large chops, but made the sauce as recipe stated because I knew it would want more. Yummy.

Made this the other day. Great recipe for chops and one to put in the rotation list. Gravy is Da Bomb! Just make sure to caramelize the onion or don't bother. If you have some mushrooms great addition.  Also don't over cook your chops. Thanks Chef John.

I'm sure that the fact that I used boneless pork chops had something to do with my wanting to add something to it for a little more flavor.  Bone-in chops add so much, but I wanted to use what I had.  I did add a little Tajin to mine when we ate, but hubby liked these as written.  I promise that I'll try this again when I get my usual bone-in chops!  The onions were yummy!  Thanks (again), Chef!

I have used this recipe many times. The one thing I do not do is drain the grease from pan after browning the chops.  Got the seasonings in the pan, Just add a little more butter and continue cause I was taught by other Chefs that is you remove all the goodies seasonings your gravy will not taste like it should.  I had to reprint this recipe cause getting older memory goes lol. That is the only thing I change when making this recipe.

Great recipe! I followed it verbatim as I usually do when I try a new recipe. The only thing was that I didn't have any buttermilk as I don't keep it on hand. So instead I used 1/4 cup of sour cream** (a good substitute). I also added salt & pepper and a shake of poultry seasoning to the sauce before simmering it. Everything turned out delicious! **To keep the sour cream from curdling, temper it by putting the sour cream in a small bowl an slowly stir in a couple of spoons of the gravy.

I loved it!  I did not use buttermilk so I used regular milk.  I did not have chicken broth, so I used cubes and added water. It was so easy to follow oh, I also added very little cayenne just for a bite. Fantastic.  I made it with steamed rice and veggies.  The gravy was wonderful over the rice.

Amazing.  I thought the time was a bit off so the gravy developed with the pork chops in it, saving about twenty minutes off what the recipe suggests.  Maybe it's better if I follow the recipe to a "T" but it was amazing with that shortcut and I'd do it again.  My three year old twins don't often afford me lots of time for cooking dinner.

Sauce was delicious but my pork chops turned out extremely tough.  I'm guessing I overcooked them.

somewhere between 3-4 stars, I cooked as listed except added some mushrooms because 1 onion is clearly not enough and I did not have any more on hand.  It should call for at least 2 but could use 3.  I served it over butter herb noodles the gravy is good but nothing special, has a sour taste because of the buttermilk probably could use sour cream as well.  It needs more seasoning besides the poultry and even though I used thin/med bone-in chops I thought that it was still a bit tough/chewy. Not much to look at on the plate.

This was a dud. I followed the recipe exactly, using inch thick bone-in pork chops and cooking times as specified. The chops were not even close to tender after 10 minutes simmering in the sauce. I extended the time to almost 30 minutes and they were still not tender. With all the other rave reviews, I don't understand my disappointing outcome.

It was awesome but my chops were only about 1/2" think should have been in pan less time so was little tough but very tasty. Will save and use this recipe often. Thanks chef john.

I love Chef John - this is the 1st time one of his recipes was less than awesome - followed directions exactly except had 6 chops - used a little more onion - which by the end of cooking had literally melted into the gravy.  Used sour cream instead of buttermilk as others did - the chops never got tender = were beautiful looking chops but they were awful - gravy just was awful tasting - what a waste of money - the chops were $8 on sale ....... file this in the "never again file"  PS  cooked a long time trying to tenderize - wasn't happening.......consider myself a good cook - been at it a long time at age 67

My hubs made these pork chops for dinner last night and although they were decent, we didn't love them. We followed the advice of another reviewer and increased the onion to two large and dredged the pork chops lightly in flour before frying. I enjoyed the unique gravy made with buttermilk, but in the end, the flavours were just ok.

I used only 2 bone-in pork chops for us tonight but increased the onions to about 5 small ones that I had left in my crisper.  I followed the instructions exactly except for doubling the sauce because we were having potatoes and I wanted lots of gravy. I'm a big fan of Chef John's and have made a lot of his recipes but this one was just okay. The gravy was the star. Next time I make this, I'm not going to buy a whole quart of buttermilk (it's all I could get in my grocery story) so I can use 1/4 cup and lose the rest. I'll just use sour cream because the taste and consistency is just about the same.  I'll simmer the pork chops longer in the gravy before serving as mine weren't done at the bone and they were still a bit chewy. I used rib chops which gave me lots of great flavor for the gravy but were not ideal for this recipe. I will make this again but will tweak it a bit for us because the gravy was very good so that made up for some other areas I wasn't so fond of.  Update: Made this again tonight with pork center chops, used sour cream instead of buttermilk and it turned out delicious.  Increasing my rating to 4 star.

I just made this recipe and it turned out great!  Never made smothered pork chops in all my years of cooking!  I'm 51! But this was ready to follow,  I seasoned to my taste.   The brown  rice and string beans and Cresent rolls! Yummy!  Thanks Chef John you are the best!

The only Thing I changed was the seasoning. I used Lowerys and Cavenders seasoning . I'm a southern delight so I made this dish with field peas and snaps and boiled okra along with smoked neck bones as my meat for vegetable seasoning. Rice for the pork steak ,yams, home made corn bread, and smoked turkey legs cooked on low until tender(Wal-mart has the best smoked turkey legs and wings. ) oh and Kool-aide;)

My daughter tried this recipe today. It was quite delicious except there was not enough onions or gravy so we made more. My pork chops were tender and tasted great. It did not take long to make either.

Excellent dish! I didn't change a thing because I have made several recipes from chef john and whatever he makes I love.  I used boneless chops and they were so moist. My hubby ate three of them. Thank you!

I realize I'm rating and reviewing this with changes I felt I needed to make in order for me to eat the dish, so I won't apologize this time. It was an absolutely marvelous dish, and I feel like it would have been wonderful without my changes, except I wouldn't have been able to eat it. This is something I will have in mind each time I have left-over chicken, which is about once in 10 days to two weeks. I'm really going to enjoy this. I may cook extra chicken just so I'm sure to have left-overs! Thank you so much for a real taste treat.

Just wondered if you used apples instead of onions would it work?  My husband cannot have onions.  It looks delish the way it is but I have to improvise.

This was good, although we found it a bit bland.  I used boneless loin chops (what I had in the freezer).  Served with crushed potatoes and buttered peas;  it was a nice, simple dinner.

I made this using the 2 pork chop portion. For me, pork can be so unforgiving that I usually brine my chops to retain moisture and tenderness. My husband cringes when I tell him I’m trying a new recipe. This recipe received a “that was great” and “write that one down, it is a keeper”.  
One change I had to make was on the buttermilk since I didn’t have any. I made DIY buttermilk using 2 tbsp skim milk with ¼ tsp lemon juice.  After sitting & thickening it still tasted like milk so I added ¼ tsp organic apple cider vinegar. I know those ratios are off but it worked for me. If it changed the overall taste of recipe, I can’t say.
 I also made additional gravy with the leftover chicken broth adding a bit of poultry seasoning & powdered onion to keep the flavoring consistent, as well as a pinch of black pepper and salt. This wasn’t just a great way to use up leftover broth but I was serving mashed potatoes with the pork and realized the current amount of the recipe gravy wouldn’t be enough for my husband the gravy hog. 
Will be making again and sharing the recipe

Made as per recipe and it was great. Second time married this recipe with the old time Cream of Mushroom  soup by adding 1 can Campell's CoM soup after caramelizing onions, about 1/4 cup or so of milk (or could be broth if preferred), dash of Worcestershire and about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. Put chops back in to simmer. Served with rice but could be mashed or polenta or whatever suits you. Absolutely delicious. Everyone devoured it and requested it be made again soon and often.

I prepared this recipe as is and loved it. Unfortunately, I did not have buttermilk so I had to improvise it and made my own. I used the article about preparing your own buttermilk from this site. I thought the recipe wasn't going to come out good enough. To my surprise, the recipe came out very good. I boiled some fingerling potatoes as a side and used the sauce to dip the potatoes. Good combo! Will make it again!

Loved this recipe...I'm gluten free, dairy free, so the only changes I made was subbing almond milk for the buttermilk, gluten free all purpose 1 for 1 flour, and then using the ever ready fake butter.   The sauce was creamy and tasty.....this will be a favorite going forward!

I really liked it.  Next time I will use some meat tenderizer first.  I served it with rice and roasted brussel sprouts.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I used regular milk instead.  Delicious!

These are absolutely amazing!! I have made this recipee numerous times now and always super delicious each time I do. I do stray from whats directed by using more onions then directed and adjusting the sauce to accommodate the change. But these chops paired with a brown rice blend are simply amazing. Will forever be on the weekly menu.

It was good! The only southern style alteration I made was I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, paprika and some flour on both sides ...instead of salt and pepper. Would definitely make again.

This recipe is so good! I made it for the first time tonight and I am so glad it turned out so well. I've never made anything like this before. Though I'm not sure how mine turned out with less and thicker gravy than others; I did follow the recipe as it is. But it is so delicious anyways!!!

I didn't all liquids called for, it never thickened. Not a fan of Poultry Seasoning, it didn't work for me here.

Delish!  I cut the recipe in half since it was just for the 2 of us.  It was SO good, loved the gravy and the pork chops were so tender.  This would probably work with chicken also.  Can't wait to make it again.

Overall a very good and simple recipe although I did have some trouble with the onions because they were burning even though I followed the recipe and left the stove at medium temperature. It is probably only my stove but I would say be careful with that. I didn't have chicken stock so I used water with seasoning and it came out fine. Great recipe because of how simple and easy it is even though it takes some time to make.

This was very good. Thought it was a bit time consuming, and the final product seemed to be missing something. Followed the recipe exactly. Thought it had enough salt and pepper. Not really sure what is was. Served ovet wild rice along with root vegetables.

Made this pretty much as written and it will be used again. Made up the gravy for 4 chops but only cooked up two. I had extra left, but that was fine because it was really good. Thanks Chef John!

I used 8 thin cut pork chops, therefore I doubled the ingredients for the sauce. It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again for my family.

I haven't fixed Pork in awhile. This recipe was great. I halved the chops, keeping the rest about the same...to have some extra Onion Gravy. I didn't use water...Chardonnay instead. Also extra Buttermilk for extra volume. I used my own Poultry Seasoning made from the AR recipe...though I added garlic powder also. I happened to have the spices...little used, so it was a good idea to use up some ground Sage and ground Marjoram, Thyme, Rosemary et al. I don't grind coffee beans anymore, so my newer grinder has been dedicated to spices. Limiting salt by choice...but not spices...it was zehr gut meine freunds. Muy bueno...etc. Not to mention Chef John is funnier than he** in his video's, in which the recipes are usually pretty good.

I followed the recipe to the Tee and it was phenomenal! I'm already looking forward to the left overs tomorrow. My husband thought the pork could have simmered maybe 5 minutes longer, but other than that it will become a recipe I will make often. AND this is someone who really does not eat pork often, so that is saying something. I also make a garlic mashed potato and steamed broccoli florets to go with this. Thanks for this recipe!

Made this tonight for the first time because I was looking for something a little different to do with pork chops.  I made six chops and doubled the ingredients for the gravy.  The only other thing I did differently was to substitute sour cream for the buttermilk, based on another reviewer's suggestion. It was fabulous! I served it over noodles and with biscuits and three bean salad on the side.  My husband loved the gravy so much that he poured it over the hot biscuits.  Delicious!!!

If I could have given it 10 stars I would! The only changes I made were for health reasons, I can't have buttermilk so replaced it with non-dairy creamer. Served it with green beans and buttered noodles. This is a definite keeper! Thanks Chef John!!!

This was excellent!  Never thought about poultry seasoning on pork but it added all kinds of extra flavour.    What I really loved was that these ingredients are what most folks have in their pantry.  Super easy and a huge hit with my family (including my butcher/foodie son).  Hard to impress my family and this did it in spades.

Out of this world good. Had to leave out the poultry seasoning as I had none and beef broth instead of chicken as that’s what was on hand. Takes a bit of time but it’s so worth it. Yummy.

I've made this probably about 6 times or so and I am NEVER tempted to alter anything about it! It's my husband's favourite pork chop recipe (and mine) and  I prepare it an average of twice per month now. So hearty! You da man, Chef John!

Very Good! My daughter even liked it, and she is as picky as they get. Ingrediant friendly. Had everything in my cabinets. I would suggest 2x the amount of Chicken Broth for more gravy.

I made it for the first time and it was tasty. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used chicken rotisserie seasoning instead and it was just as good.
Very easy to do but it takes about 45 minutes to prepare and cook the pork chops.

Made it for dinner and kids loved it!  Not sure what buttermilk is so I used half and half cream (which was what I had in the fridge) and it tasted great.  Next time I plan to add button mushrooms.  Thank you for this!!

I’ve tried many recipes for pork chops over the years.  Chef John’s recipe is finally the one that fits the bill!  They are excellent.  I made these for my family and they raved about them.  Plenty of tasty gravy, with loads of onions,  and tender, substantial chops - a winner by far!  I always look for Chef John’s recipes because they’re always excellent and this is a fine example! Thank you Chef John!

Okay, so the flavor here was very good.  I didn’t have chicken broth so used water with Better Than Bullion chicken base. I added a few splashes of red wine vinegar. To me though, the pork would be better (more tender) if it was cooked in a slow cooker.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  The sauce was amazing!
I used center cut pork chops.  Turned out tuff.  Not sure if I used the wrong kind of pork chop or if I over cooked it.  The chops were a little more than 1/2 inch.  Did I overcook them?  Or did I use the wrong kind of chop?
I served this was a baked sweet potato.

I've made this twice now and it's fantastic! This time, I only had a purple onion so I used that. I prefer it with the yellow onion but it still came out beautifully.  Another fabulous  Chef John recipe! What I really love about this is that it's simple.  I've seen a lot of recipes and they seem to be trying to take something that's a tried and true favourite and add their spin to it.

I'm originally from NYC but at the request of my very Southern man, I made this last night using this recipe and I promise it had me looking like I grew up in the Mississippi Delta lol! He was so impressed, ate until he was stuffed and threatened to take the gravy boat upstairs with us later  

 The only changes I made was used a high heat to carmelize the onions because on my little electric-stove-that-could, medium heat would've taken an hour lol.
Otherwise it was delicious and so easy to make. Thank you!

My fiancé LOVES this recipe! He swears the gravy is amazing. The only minor things I did was; making my own buttermilk from vinegar & milk and adding a whole 12oz package of mushrooms into it. He loves mushrooms. Other than that I do everything by the recipe. Awesome job with this one!

Made a few substitutes based on what I had on hand.    Kids that don’t like any “food touching each other” still thought they were the best meal ever.  
I had some other meat rub with sage for poultry seasoning, ranch dressing powder for the buttermilk and added mushrooms, because... why not?

This was very good and hubby liked it as well.  It is a little time consuming, but worth it.  I made my own poultry seasoning from this site as I did not have any.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  Next time I think I will double the sauce.

Very tasty recipe... subbed gluten free flour for my wife... didn’t have buttermilk so used a smaller amount of whole milk.... definitely a recipe we will put on our “favorites” list

I really wanted to like it. Bone in 1/2-3/4 inch pork chops were a bit tough. Not much flavor. It was probably my error in selection of  pork chops.  I'll try the recipe  again.  I usually like Chef John's recipes.

I made this and it was a hit. The only change was that I did not add the buttermilk. It was delicious! Thanks to this recipe, my family thinks I can really cool! :-)
Thank you!

Not difficult but time-consuming. And worth every minute you spend to do it. This is now officially a staple of our family dinner table.
A delicious and hearty meal that you don't want to end.

If you don't have "poultry seasoning",  try using a popular Louisiana based "cajun" seasoning ( Tony Chachere's )... or try making Creole Seasoning, found on AR.com; use either moderately to suit your personal taste.  I used regular milk by mistake--and it really didn't matter; next time, I'll pay attention to what milk I use.  I TRIPLED this awesome sauce ( careful to add the spices just right ), which allowed me to cover the chops and have them long time simmer till fork tender....and I added mushrooms, which worked out very well.  I managed to get a sauce with the right thickness, that caught that smoky essence.....with the right kiss of spice.  You can't ever go wrong with Chef John!!

This is my 2nd time making this.  I "pounded" my chops with some onion, garlic powder and cajun seasoning ( instead of poultry).  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce, along with a dollop of sour cream and the buttermilk.  I put the chops in my large crock pot and poured the sauce over them.  Cooked on "low" for 2-3 hours. This should make them tender.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I do think I'll be doubling the onions next time as my only change, just because I don't feel 1 was enough.

Super Easy. Used sour cream instead of buttermilk and 3 medium onions. Tasted great and I don't usually like pork chops. Would definitely make again.

So good it's finger licking worthy.   I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour cream.  I also needed to cook  the chops in the sauce 45 minutes to get them tender.  Next time I will double the onions.

I used organic seasoning from Kirkland w/no salt and I used regular 2% milk instead of buttermilk (didn't have any).  The recipe was right on point.  I used more water to thin the gravy a little more and the poultry seasoning and chicken broth really made the difference!

I didn't have garlic cloves so I used garlic powder, also I didn't have chicken broth on hand instead I used chicken bouillon cubes put them in some water and melted it in the microwave. Still turned out delicious.

I just made this but with sliced chicken breasts. Came out awesome. Only change besides the chicken was that I used Trader Joe's poultry rub instead of poultry seasoning. The chicken was moist and flavorful and my husband ate seconds! Will definitely make it again.

The directions were easy to follow but it was very bland! My family didn’t really care for it. Will be adding my own seasonings next  time. I think I may also coat them with flour first before  frying.

We really liked this. I only had 3 chops and thought it needed more sauce. (maybe because the sauce was so good)  I served it on top of noodles but I think it would be great with mashed potatoes or rice.  I think I will add mushrooms the next time.  Easy week night meal that I will make again.

I have a confession to make. I didn’t make pork chops! I had enough of a pork loin roast left over to make two pork chop-like pieces. I made the gravy as close as I possibly could without having browned chops in the pan. I then put the pork in the pan, smothered them with gravy, and gently simmered all until the pork was reheated. Turned out great, and even my normally quiet husband said it was good and a keeper!

Delicious as is; due to my past experience with tough meat I put the browned chops in a pressure cooker while making the gravy to soften the meat.

Other than my pork chops being smaller, and not bone-in, I followed the recipe exactly. It was fine, but nothing special (hubby thought it was bland). As Chef John's recipes are always exceptional, I was disappointed. Perhaps replacing the poultry seasoning with something else, like other reviewers have done, may have worked better for us.

Delicious! The pork chops came out tender and juicy. I served mine with red mashed potatoes using the gravy over them...very yummy!
The only change I made was eliminating the garlic because we're not fond of garlic.

These chops tasted very good and my mother loved them. My only problem was I didn't have the chicken broth I thought I had. So, I had to use water, but they were still very tasty. We ate them with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I made this recipe, but instead of using the fresh garlic, I used drippings from when I fried my pork chops which already had garlic powder and chili powder in it.  Either way, this is the most delicious recipe I have ever used for smothered pork chops.  Definitely one that I am going to use often.  I would also suggest adding mushrooms if you wanted.  AMAZING!

I braised these pork chops with flour before pan frying them.  I simmer the sauce for 10 min. then returned the pork chops to the sauce.  I turned the pork chops over in the sauce after 10 min and spoon the sauce on the other side. and cover them plus continue to simmer for the last 10 min.

I’ve been anxious to try this recipe since I first saw it a couple of years ago.  Finally talked my family into giving pork a chance.  Guess what?!?  You already know the outcome - they loved it!!
I doubled the recipe, so I actually did all of the cooking in a cast iron Dutch oven and baked it in the oven for even cooking.  This is a keeper!

An uncomplicated dish that is very tasty.  I didn't have poultry seasoning...darn!  So I used a Tamarind and Chilli spice blend made by McCormacks. I also doubled the Buttermilk.

Swapped out the rice and we had with Penne Pasta.  Used the sauce with the pasta as well.

I used boneless thick cut chops.  I don't know if this is why they took longer to cook.  I put a cover on the pan while finishing cooking the chops and this seemed to thin out the gravy.  All in all, my husband really liked the flavoring and the chops were tender.

This is a great recipe. Made the mistake of making it  late on a weeknight. I'm talking starting it at 7 pm. It was more work than I thought it would be, but I can't take off points for that. I rushed  some steps to save time. Next time I'll go slower and cook each step properly. And I'll pour the gravy over plain old egg noodles.

This was probably the best dish that I've ever made. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only difference was that I used seasoned my flour as well as my pork chops.

No changes, other than increasing the gravy.  Was very good and plan on making again.  Served it over tomato/basil noodles with a side of asparagus wrapped in Prosciutto with cream cheese.

My chops were much thicker than called for so, once everything was in the pan (I used a deep cast iron skillet), I popped it in the oven. 375* for about 30 minutes. They were DELICIOUS. The chops stayed super moist from cooking in the gravy. Everyone in my family raved about dinner that night.

Very good. I used boneless pork chops and I may have cooked them just a tad too long. The gravy was very good although, as someone had suggested, an extra onion might have been good.

Made it last night I did use Grill Mates Chicken instead of the poultry seasoning.   Family went nuts!  this is definitely in my rotation.
Update:  I was in a rush and only had golden mushroom soup instead of buttermilk.   Still awesome!!

Great recipe! I used heavy cream instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any, and it still turned out great. And had boneless chops, but just cut back the cook time. They turned out moist and the onions made the dish delicious!
Will definitely make again.

This was quick and fulfilling.  I did not have poultry seasoning on hand [i was so certain i had this ingredient] so I use (thyme, rosemary, sage, ginger & oregano — as substitute).  Also did not have buttermilk.  The flavor was great but just a bit salty!!!!

Let me start by saying I do not care for pork chops!  I find them to be dry and totally lacking in the good taste that a bit of fat imparts.  However, my husband LOVES them, so when I saw the recipe for SMOTHERED chops, I thought that might be the answer to my aversion.
I prepared the dish as described except I used 1/4 cup of sour cream instead of buttermilk (because I never have buttermilk on hand) and I topped the dish with butter-sauteed mushrooms.
My husband's face lit up with the first taste and he hasn't stopped complimenting me all day!  He LOVED it and wants me to make it again --- and again and again!  And being that I enjoyed it as much as he did, I just may do that.
I used what my market called "bone-in loin pork chops"but they were HUGE (about 1-1/2 pounds each!) yet they were tender, juicy and very flavorful.  I served them with asparagus spears and cooked noodles.  DELICIOUS!
Thank you, Chef John and All Recipes.com.

Easy to make , and the steps involved allow for clean-up in between. I use a little less water near the end, and I'm a bit generous with the flour as it gives a thicker gravy. I've always made this using boneless center-cut chops, it comes out great!

This was so good, I'm definitely going to make it again.  Next time I will use less salt, but that's on me, not the recipe.  I didn't change a thing, it's perfect as written.  The gravy was perfect with the pork.

I t reminded me so much of my favorite French Onion Soup recipe that I doubled the onions & sauce, I didn’t have buttermilk so I used sour cream, cooked my onions 20-25 minutes to carmelize, and I deglazed with white wine and was out of water so I substituted the white wine again ; ) !  I served with the smothered rice as suggested and crisp sour dough toast with melted Swiss! Thank you Chef John! We loved it!

I have made this countless times now,and I have to say it is the easiest and most versatile recipe for smothered pork chops I have found. I have used Better Than Boullion” chicken flavor, boneless and bone-in pork chops, white and yellow onions, and different brands of poultry seasoning (McCormicks is the best). I have served it over mashed potatoes, basmati rice, noodles, and even biscuits for breakfast. It is always a winner. Once I even substituted chicken for the pork- and I hate chicken, but you’d never know the difference.

Pros:    Easy to make,  not over spicy, good for wintry day, 
              good gravy consistency 
Cons:   Flavour rather bland 
Made exactly to recipe, ingredients prepped and measured out before cooking started to make it easy.....a bit bland for our taste.   Pork chops still have "bite" which is fine by us.   Had to add salt (as stated in recipe direction) but since I don't normally use salt that means it was pretty bland.  Will stick to my Louisville-born Dad's pork chop recipe, which simmers on the stove-top until they are falling-apart-tender and the gravy is awesome. 
 If I made this recipe again, I would double the gravy/onion/garlic ingredients  and add some picante.

Tasty and tender, I pretty much followed the recipie. I didn’t have buttermilk handy so just used milk, I had just made vegtable stock so used that instead of chicken stock.

My daughter and I cooked these together. I had a little trouble with the onions but it wasn’t a recipe problem. I had one substitution but it was only because I didn’t have buttermilk so I used cream instead. The gravy was so good. It was even good the next day warmed up. I cooked mashed potatoes with it but I think it would be good with rice as well. It is definitely as repeat!

Only used heavy cream as I never have buttermilk. So yummy, and yes, comforting. Have made this twice and have added fresh mushrooms I needed to use up, which doesn't caramalize as well, but is still so yummy and flavorful! Thanks, Chef John!

Made this exactly as written.  I feel that is the only way to honestly rate it.  It was fantastic.  I made it again with cooking the pork chops in my roaster for about 1 1/2 hrs so they would be really tender ( browned them in the roaster first) then took them out and finished the rest of it on top of the stove in the roaster to get all of the bits on the bottom.  It turned out fabulous.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Used exact recipe except had only 3 chops but they were really big. Used a inexpensive cut that I purchased from the 50% meat bin.  these were so delicious.  Chef John has to be Southern.

I added a pkg of brown gravy mix before I put chops in.  I also added mushrooms. It turned out better than I thought it would.

Well definitely cool this again! The chops were tender, and the gravy was sweet and succulent. My family loved it.

My hubby and I both enjoy Chef John's recipes and this also became our favorite.  Caramelizing onions takes longer than what the recipe says, but it's still worth it and you really can't speed up the process because it makes this dish so delicious.  Also the bone-in pork chop is a must.  Thank you, Chef John!

I followed the directions without changing anything. It was okay to me, but my husband didn't like it at all. He thought the poultry seasoning gave it a wierd flavor that he didn't care for.

I made this recipe today, and the outcome was excellent.  I did not have buttermilk, so taking a clue from someone else,I used plain Greek yogurt in the gravy.  My husband loved it served over mashed potatoes.

Delicious! Thank you Chef John. I served with mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. Compliments from the men. I browned mine very well. Really carmelized the onions. It was dark and rich in flavor. That could be different between a 4 star and a 5 star- executing th browning and the deep carmelization.

These were absolutely amazing! I did brine the chops fior a few hours  before cooking. I also tripled the onion because we love onions. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. The chops were so tender and the gravy was the best I’ve ever had. It was wonderful over mashed potatoes. Thanks Chef John!

Very tasty, I didn't think the water was needed in the end, it seemed like the chicken broth and buttermilk was enough without making the mixture too soupy.

A great recipe as always from Chef John, ....
I tweaked it, as a chef myself I play with the base and always look for ways to personalize it, not to discredit the originator of the recipe... However, I used salt & vinegar spice, adobo, garlic and onion powder.  Then after about 10 minutes of the onions caramelizing I added pomegranate molasses to finish the process before going to the next step... it was perfect , and i added a hint of thyme to the onions before adding the broth ... excellent...

Absolutely delicious!  Reduced poultry seasoning by half (like to take it easy with dry herbs when trying a new recipe; can always add more if needed; can't take out) and used seasoning salt in place of regular; it's the perfect match for pork.  Skipped the water and used a whole can (14.5 oz.) of chicken broth. All the timings were spot on.  A flavorful and easy to prepare recipe.  May try adding a tsp. of Worcestershire sauce next time to deepen flavor.  Thanks, Chef John.  A wonderful recipe suited for company and special occasions.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Loved the subtle tang from the buttermilk.

I made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loved it.  The second time, I didn't have buttermilk and used cream of mushroom soup instead of the buttermilk.  He loved it even more.  This recipe is great for those cheaper cuts of pork.  It turns it into a wonderful meal that you would be proud to serve to company.  This is a keeper.

So delicious! Served with mashed potatoes and side garden salad. Made gluten free (GF) using GF all purpose flour (I used Better Batter, but think most, such as Pillsbury GF flour would work perfectly fine). Also, didn't have buttermilk and subbed with plain yogurt (common sub. for buttermilk cup for cup). I had near 2" thick boneless chops and accidentally overcooked them while making another dish. Still, the chops w/the sauce were so good--as in, mouth watering good. With mashers and a lil salad, we are in near food coma. The gravy on top of the potatoes was excellent; would be great w/rice--try wild rice! We'll definitely make the recipe again and with thick bone-in chops! Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Awesome recipe. Great flavor with simple ingredients!  I did (sadly) overcook the pork chops. ~5 mins per side to brown is/was way too long. I got normal sized chops, not super thick, so maybe that's where the main problem was with browning and time.  That's not the recipes fault tho; it's just a reminder to myself (and maybe to others) to be mindful of the doneness and check temp often so as to not kill off any tenderness or juiciness.

One of my favorite dishes! Brined the chops the night prior. Melts in my mouth! I had to make some substitutions due to availability, not taste (I rarely have everything at hand..)
1. Goya Adobo to season pork
2. Stock from today's slow cooked chicken instead of broth (um, yum!)
3. Doubled milk measure and eliminated water. I only had skim lactose free instead of buttermilk (don't laugh...at least it's better than powdered!)
4. Added a touch more flour for thickening (due to buttermilk shortage)
Call me crazy, but even with the substitutions, still the best pork chops ever!

Been learning to cook the last few months, made many dishes from this site including a few from Chef John.  All have been good to very good but this recipe is the best so far, so delicious and pretty on the plate.  Hubs said they were 'restaurant quality', he's never said that before.  All that was left on the plates were the shiny, clean bones.  Followed as written, made a couple mistakes and was still amazing.  So amazing I am going to try again in two days with the rest of the chops we have.

I come home after a long day. Left my wife with pork chops in the morning. They're still in the fridge. Told her just rest, I'll do it (yeah, was a guilt trippin' attempt that backfired). So I went all out. This recipe had almost everything I was looking for, to include ease. I Julianned one BF yellow onion. The only two changes I made was to fry the Pork Chops in coconut oil and along with the butter, I loosened up the pan with about less than a 1/4 cup of Pinot Noir. 
I paired the wonderful Pork Chops with Shelly Beans (look em up) that I cooked down into it's own creamy dreamy sauce. 
Needless to say, my wife loves me (even more) and was wowed, while I watched her sop up all of the sauce from the Chops!

Delicious! I followed the recipe as explained other than replacing the buttermilk with regular milk, as I did not  have buttermilk on hand.  The sauce/ gravy was scrumptious!

My mom passed away last year. Every once and a while, I will ask my dad is there something he would like me to make for him...and I know it will be something that my mom used to make him. So it's Father's Day tomorrow and he said that he would like smothered pork chops. Well I made this recipe, just like it says, and my dad loves it! Thank you!

This was an easy meal and the family loved it.  I am not sure but I feel like it should have made more sauce then it did but the flavor was excellent and it was quite tasty with rice.  I might increase the onion a bit next time.  Slow cooking the onion to caramelize is key.

Excellent recipe from Chef John!  I had only two large bone-in pork chops, but made full recipe of sauce.  Served with mashed potatoes, the sauce  was just enough.  Easy and wonderful!

Another perfect recipe from Chef John!  I made it exactly as directed (using reconstituted buttermilk powder since we don't drink it) and it was fantastic, super-easy except for the dreaded drying part.  My mother came from the deep south,  we ate smothered pork chops frequently when I was growing up, and this is far more flavorful.  Do make sure you got the chops the right thickness and look for ones that have good marbling... pork has become so dry that it is next to impossible to cook well any more.

Wonderful!  I used the thinner pork chops because my husband does not like the thick chops.  The recipe worked just as well.  Bone in chops does make a difference.  We loved them.

I made it straight off the recipe using bone-in pork chops I had in the deep freezer. Delicious! So good that my family requested it again the following weekend. I got a little too comfortable and didn't follow the recipe as closely because we wanted more sauce. My mistake because it just wasn't as good. Tried it for a third time a couple weeks later & I  followed the recipe closely, but this time the pork chops turned out tough.  I had purchased them from a big box warehouse retailer, so I think that was the mistake. Like any recipe, the quality of the ingredients can make all the difference. Will certainly make this again and definitely recommend following the recipe closely because it was absolutely delicious.

Really easy! If you dont have buttermilk available like I didnt mix 1 tsp (I think) of vinegar and 1 cup of milk together. Ta da! Still just as good as it should be. My family loves this recipe and its been added to the list of things I make they love. The only thing I changed was the porkchops. I got thinner ones for my pots sake and cook time. That adjustment will be made tonight! Yummy!!

Wow! Delicious! My husband and son loved it too. I used thick Iowa chops, added mushrooms when the onions were almost finished sautéing. I subbed yogurt for the buttermilk because that's what I had. Otherwise I followed the recipe.

This is a great recipe and change-up from sometimes boring pork chops! I used pretty thick chops but feel any size will work if you adjust your cook time. I also feel boneless would work fine too. Loved it!

I didn't make any changes. Was good but not so good that I would want to make it again. Go easy on poultry seasoning...was a little over powering in the taste and I went easy on the sprinkling of it. Wish I would have added another onion and maybe breaded the pork chops.

Didn't have garlic or poultry seasoning.  I added an extra onion and thyme, the pork chops and gravy were delicious.  The sauce was just the right consistency - not too thick or too watery. Will definitely make this one again.

I made this dish as is and LOVED it. My 3 , 5 and 12 year old boys devoured it. I wish we would've made egg noodles like a lot of you suggested to sop up that delicious gravy.

The Pork Chops were easy to make and were enjoyed by my granddaughter and her fiancé.  I made 4 because they came 2 to a package and I didn't want to freeze one just for myself.  My granddaughter cut the last one up and took it with her along with some wild rice I made.  My granddaughter and her fiancé come to my house once a week for lunch or perhaps supper and when I make something they like, my granddaughter will take any left overs with her for lunch.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband loves the chops and gravy in this dish. I brined and floured the chops first and had to make buttermilk with lemon juice.

The only change I made was adding a cup of sliced mushrooms to the sauteing onions. My husband liked it well enough to have me make it again.

Definitely our go-to recipe for pork chops.  However, I add the chops back to the pot when cooking the gravy - the extra cooking makes them incredibly tender. Also, I could never get the buttermilk not to curdle, but I found regular whole milk and a splash of vinegar work well.

Served with mashed potatoes for a great comfy dish on a cold winter evening.

Another home run from Chef John! I made it exactly as written and it was soooo good! I used 4 1 inch thick chops and 1 very large sweet onion and found that there were plenty of onions and sauce for all four chops. YUM!

As other reviewers suggested, I used sour cream in place of buttermilk. This was very good, but I have a similar recipe that incorporates mushrooms and takes less time to cook.

Made this for dinner last night. So good! The only change I would consider is maybe increase the flour a little because the sauce was a little thin -- but it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Loved the recipe just the way it was. Easy though a little time consuming, it was worth every minute. Definitely going to make it again. Going to try it with pork medallions for a party buffet.

Made it exactly per recipe. Huge hit with family including my 92 year old mother. Expected her to eat 1/2 of chop but ate whole dinner with applesauce and cinnamon with corn. Son stated he could drink the gravy. Will make again.

I don't eat pork so I used veal steaks instead.  The gravy was pretty good, but the meat was kind of bland with just the poultry seasoning and salt/pepper.  I would definitely try the method a second time but would recommend jazzing up the meat itself with more seasoning next time.

Really good flavor and texture. Great compliment to pork chops and an easy scratch gravy done in 40 minutes start to finish. Used half and half instead of buttermilk and it was fine. Will use this again and again.

I may have added just a little more flour because I had 6 chops instead of 4.  The family and I loved it. It was very flavorful and tender.  We will have this again soon.

I followed the recipe exactly and added one red onion and two more white onions. The dinner was delicious!  I made mashed potatoes and brocolli. This would go well with potato pancakes, rice or noodles. Really yummy gravy.

There is not one recipe that Chef John does that is not simple, tasty, attractive and wholesome.  I made this recipe and my husband raved about it.  I followed the instructions as directed and it turned out, what can I say, "scrumptious".

Awesome flavor!  I only made two pork chops so I served them over egg noodles with the extra sauce.  Make sure you let the onions sit in the pan and caramelize for a long time.  Perfect!

Followed the recipe but cut it in half since we are only two people.  Came out great. Pork was moist and tender and the sauce with the onions was great.

I'm pretty sure this would have come out better if I had been a little more generous with the seasonings.  I found it bland and my pork chop was tough.

I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I used Garlic salt and pepper to season the pork before pan frying. I also didn't have buttermilk so I just used a bit of cream. This recipe was easy to make and my family really enjoyed it. I will make it again.

I have been making this for years but I use low fat milk instead of the buttermilk it probably isn't as rich tasting but everyone who has eaten mine love it . Thanks chef john I love your recipes and have saved and tried several

My grandmother being from the south made smothered porkchops. I unfortunately wasn't able to get her recipe before she passed. I liked this recipe and would totally continue using it . I didnt use the buttermilk more so because my grandmother didnt use it in hers. Never had the stuff before and the recipe was still great. My family enjoyed it

Great recipe. Followed the instructions....but added a little something to suit my taste. I made this for my mom's birthday.  She loves mushrooms as well. So after carmelizing the onions and adding broth.....I added 2 cans of sliced mushrooms with 1 can cream of mushroom soup and milk. This made a thicker and more volume gravy. My family is southern so we eat lots of rice with gravy.   Everybody loved it!

Didn't change a thing. Made it with 2 chops but didn't reduce the gravy so we had lots to smother on rice & mushrooms. This is a definite keeper.

I thought this was a wonderful dish!  I had an emergency substitution because I was OUT of chicken stock so I used beef.  I did add mushrooms just because I LOVE mushrooms and kept the cloves whole and just removed them as my husband doesn't like to be overwhelmed with garlic taste.  Oh, I did add a couple of tablespoons of cream sherry.  Perfecto!

I hate to give a  Chef John recipe anything less than five stars, but I agree with one reviewer that the cooking times are way off.  Following the directions as shown results in clumps of onion goop, and no recognizable onion (or significant onion flavor) at all.  I recommend reducing the time to cook and caramelize the onions to about seven minutes, and the time to cook the gravy once all but the pork chops have been added to about five minutes,  I also increased the butter as the recommended amount was completely absorbed by the onion and left the pan dry before adding flour.  (I could have also retained the oil and drippings after browning the chops, but didn't.)  Looking forward to trying this again with these adjustments.

Swapped fat free half and half for the buttermilk and seasoned with a little cumin and cayenne too. We loved this recipe. Use low sodium broth.  Chef John has amazing recipes. Check out his chicken piccata!!

I very much appreciate Chef John's cooking style and trust his recipes. Pork is not my favorite meat, but I had some pork chops on the freezer and entrusted them to this recipe. I was concerned about them not cooking enough  because I'm from the - no pink in pork school. I shouldn't have been concerned. The cooking times were spot on, the spices perfect, the onions perfectly carmalized. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn. My only regret was not doubling the 'gravy' portion of the recipe because it was so good I was scrapping the chop plate to top my mashed potatoes! Well done and Thank you Chef!

I did everything correctly, including leveling off the measuring spoons of flour. The gravy didn't get thick and delicious. It was good, but I can't go into rhapsodies as others did. The chops were OK, but I think a lot of that depends on the meat you get. I was most disappointed that the gravy didn't thicken up. I don't think I will follow the receipt exactly again, but I may use some of the techniques. It was a good supper, but not great.

I didn't make any changes except to double the Gravy ingredients so I could use it for the rice too.  My husband and I really enjoyed it and I will make it again.

We loved this dish. I substituted bacon grease for the vegetable oil and half and half for buttermilk. I also put a little flour on each chop prior to frying. Served with roasted new potatoes recipe from this site.

Yummy!!! We loved this dish & my leftover hating hubby even took what was left for his lunch. That's a winner!!! The only change I made was to add sliced baby bella mushrooms to the gravy that I cooked before the onions. Going to try it with chicken next.

Another fine Chef John recipe.   I made it as directed and it was a huge hit with my family.   I did find that some of the cook times weren't long enough, and that could be a difference of our stoves, pans or whatever.   Besides that the recipe was perfect and mouth watering.   Thank you CJ.

We love this! Have made several times and enjoyed immensely. Only difference is that we cook 2 Big bone-in chops but otherwise all the same—gravy is so good and bone-in chops so thick, we need it all. If we did 4 chops, we’d double the sauce ingredients, so tasty!!!Thx once more, Chef John!

This was very good. I followed the recipe except used two onions. Beware this is not a weeknight dinner! It does take an hour!! I really  made my kitchen timer earn its keep. But I'll make it again for sure and I'll add mushrooms.

The gravy was absolutely delicious......I didn't change a thing.  Even though the reviewers mostly used bone-in chops, I will have to try boneless next time.

Great recipe! I had no buttermilk, so I used a half cup of whole milk instead of the buttermilk and water. Next time I make this, I will use a half cup of heavy cream instead of buttermilk and water. I may use some additional onion, too.

Made as written but with only 2 chops, same amount of gravy which was just right.  Chops were a bit dense, not tender enough.  Will probably brine next time for 30 min. to help tenderize, otherwise a great easy recipe.

My family loved it. Made a few changes because I did not have chicken broth and buttermilk. Instead I used vegetable broth and cornstarch and water to substitute my buttermilk. I still had to add the 1/4 cup of water because it thickened slightly. You have to put a little more seasoning because of the cornstarch and water mix, but no worries.  The recipe was fabulous and my daughter asked for leftovers to be tomorrow's dinner!

Absolutely loved this flavorful gravy. Made it with chicken pieces instead of pork; used 1/2 cup white cooking wine with 1 cup herb ox no-salt chicken broth; used 1/2 onion instead of whole.  
Cooked down to a thick gravy and poured over mashed potatoes.

Excellent! I made it for myself for dinner tonight and I licked my plate clean. I only had half of a red onion and used that, but it came out wonderful It never crossed my mind to use poultry seasoning on pork,  I'm glad for that new idea. I might experiment using poultry seasoning with other kinds of meat. Thanks Chef John for another recipe to add to my favorites.

This was excellent - a great dish to make for company!! I used only 2 pork chops but  made the same amount of gravy, which was just delicious. It is a bit time consuming so leave plenty of time.

This was very good!  We have members that are gluten sensitive, so we replaced the flour with a gluten free flour.  Turned out well.  Thanks, Chef John!

these were amazing. I am not a meat person at all and I actually went back for more.  I never can get pork chops to come out tender so I stop making them.  Instead I used a pork tenderloin cut into 1 inch medallions  and WOW so good and tender.  All the times were spot on.   Brown both side 5 min they should be slightly pink inside still. Followed recipe exactly including using buttermilk.  Definitely need to add the water since using pork tenderloin did not produce any juice on plate.  Medallion once back in skillet took 10 min to finish cooking.   Made this with Chef John twice baked potato. Restaurant worthy meal.

I have been cooking dinner for my wife since she still works and I'm retired.   I had a handle on cooking but once I found this site it was like I graduated cooking college!  I've been making meals from this site for almost four years and this is my first rating.   We love Chef John recipes and this one was absolutely gourmet!  The richness of the onion gravy and the moisture of the pork chops made this delicious!   I served it with Rice Pilaf and sautéed broccoli.   My wife is not a pork chop fan but she raved about this recipe!   We have enjoyed countless recipes from this site ( but not the extra pounds, lol)!  I stayed true to this recipe and found it better than I could imagine!

Family friendly recipe! From our toddler to teenage boys, everybody loved it! I used 1/2 chicken knorr cubes with 1.5 cups water since I don't buy chicken stock and it was still yummy! I cut up the chops bite-size after frying to make  it kid-friendly  and simmered it in the sauce, it made it soft and very flavorful in every bite!

I used boneless one inch thick pork chops and they turned out very moist. The gravy was tasty and would benefit from the addition of an extra onion or two.

Very yummy and the directions make it easy! My boyfriend likes comfort food being from the South and being a NE girl I like things healthy and this was a perfect combination of the two. We both ate more than we should have but couldn't help it! Served it over rice and with green beans! :) Will make again and share with others!

These were absolutely delicious with a few small changes. I used 1 Tbsp poultry seasoning mixed with 1.5 tsp garlic powder, 1.5 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, and some salt and pepper for my dry rub. I used whatever spices I had left after rubbing down the pork to flavor the onions and sauce as they cooked. I did not follow the exact cooking times listed in the recipe, as my pork chops were a bit on the small side. I also substituted greek yogurt for buttermilk, since I didn't have any on hand. I added a bit of extra chicken broth in to balance the thickness and it worked out perfectly.   My pork chops turned out absolutely delicious. I had them  over mashed potatoes and poured the gravy on top.

My husband loved it!!! I did brine the chops first for about 45 mins. and the only thing I am going to change next time I make it is do double the gravy and garlic part and use more like three onions because one is just not enough to smother anything. Other than that, this is a very tasty (and easy) recipe.

Yum. Made it, loved it, am keeping it. I did not bother with the draining of the oil and then adding butter. I sauteed the onions etc. in the drippings of the chops. Super good....or perhaps you could make a Freudian typo and say, "Supper good!"

I will make this again, but my sauce turned out quite wattery.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, as I thought I followed the recipe.  Hopefully when I try it again it will be thicker and I'll re-review.

Delicious!  Added extra onion and doubled the gravy (per another reviewers suggestion).  Great meal--tasty and pork chops tender!  MUST make again!

Very good!  My sons hate onions; one still ate it and the other still didn't.  I buy thin, boneless pork chops so I skipped the first step of browning the chops and just added them to the sauce while it simmered.  Next time I will specifically buy nice thick pork chops and do it the right way!  Other than that, I  made it per recipe except subbed 1/4 cup light sour cream as another reviewer mentions, I loved the creamy sauce.

The gravy was delicious! I didnt use the stated amount of chicken broth. Accodentally only used 1/4th cup and went heavy on the water. It was still super deliciously but a bit pasty. Used garlic paste in squeeze bottle rather than cloves. Also should have cooked chops longer initialky. I'm an amateur cook and family loved it! One of my best dishes yet. Wish it wasnt as time comsuming.

I made this after reading the reviews expecting the best thing I had ever put in my mouth.  I followed the recipe exactly as written. To me it was just okay, so I was a little disappointed after such a build up.  Mine ended up being too salty for my taste but still good. I think it was just a matter of personal taste. It was good but for the time it took, I am not sure I would make it again. The hubby ate it but didn't seem that impressed. Thanks for the recipe though it was a good change from the norm at least.

Made this tonight and really wasn't impressed. The pork chops did not have sufficient time to cook enough to tenderize resulting in tough chops. The sauce was good, but not great. Served it all over beautiful wide egg noodles which saved this dish. Family requested to change back to breading and frying the pork chops, sorry, but first and last time for this dish...didn't like the buttermilk with the onions. I followed recipe exactly, seems the ones that give it a 5 star rating change things up in the recipe....Was like pork chop stroganoff!

Great entree beside fresh green beans and a salad.  There was not a drop of gravy left.  It was the technique that takes Chef John's onion gravy to the next level.  The only change I made was to mash a Tbsp of butter together with the flour before adding it to the onions.  I find my gravy is less likely to be lumpy that way.

Yum. Just plain yum. I found I had to cook the pork chops a fair bit longer than the 10 minutes recommended in the last stage(I cooked them for about 25 minutes) but otherwise the recommended portions and times was good. Didn't even have to season it (and I used salt free chicken stock.)

This was excellent.  Even good enough for my picky husband.  My husband hates to eat and he liked it.  I made the recipe as written, but we put the gravy over potatoes since my husband is not a rice eater.   He thought we should keep the recipe - that's a mile stone in our household!

Oh man, this dish was a complete hit! As always, I prepared it as close to the instructions as possible, though there were a few adjustments that had to be made. Mainly it was just an additional onion added, and the sauce was increased to make up for the fact that I'd been given one monstrous sized pork chop along with the others. Those few changes alone shouldn't be enough to alter the overall taste of the dish though.
The recipe itself was so great. It was so convenient (especially seeing as I'd randomly chosen the recipe for an impromptu dinner date).

Also it's strange that for the first time ever, I can say that there exists a dish so nicely flavored that it doesn't even require a few shakes of cayenne pepper (which I'm shocked wasn't included anywhere in the recipe. Almost doesn't feel like a Chef John recipe without it! Lol). The gravy really makes the dish too! It made well spooned over a heaping pile of homemade mashed potatoes. Very filling meal. This will totally be a go-to meal from now on.

Just finished eating this after making it for the first time, it was delicious!  I followed the recipe as is, I was skeptical one onion would be enough but it was very tasty. It would probably be delicious with some mushrooms added as well, so I may try that the next go-around. Definitely a keeper!

This was okay, but I probably won't make again. Followed recipe exact. I think the garlic was too much and I should have used only 1 small clove. I love onions and gravy so was surprised I didn't care for it.

I made this last night. I found it to be somewhat bland, even after caramelizing the onions for about 20-25 minutes.  I followed the basic recipe but I had 6 center cut pork chops so I added 2 large yellow onions, 2 cups of the broth 1/3 cup of the buttermilk and about 3 tablespoons of the flour.  I seasoned everything very well, but it was missing the "oomph" factor.  So I added about 15-20 drops of Braggs Liquid Aminos and VIOLA!!!!  Touchdown!!!  NOW it tasted very good.  I had lots of sauce and onions and using the center cut porkchops, they came out tender and delicious.  It was winner with the picky boys!

The flavor of the original recipe was really good and flavorful.   Although I used three onions instead of just one, I don't think that altered the flavor of the original recipe.   The chops weren't as tender as I had hoped but weren't really tough either.  The only other alteration I made was at the very end and I added about a quarter cup of sour cream to the gravy.

This was very good!  I doubled the butter with the onions and they took about 20 minutes to caramelize....other than that, I didn't change a thing.  Next time I will use a nonstick pan for this recipe....just a personal preference.

The recipe is an good starter recipe. Lightly coating the chops with a seasoned flour mixture helps add flavor and tenderness to the chops. This takes the place of adding the flour raw to the sauteed onions. There are a few benefits to this. The browned flour tastes better and simply melts off the chops into the sauce and thickens it.  And It lessens the chance of there being lumps of uncooked flour in the gravy. Be sure to season both the chops and the flour for depth of flavor. You will need to add a bit more oil to the pan at the start to brown the floured chops. Use a tasteless oil though so there is no competing of flavors. There is no need for chicken broth to make the gravy which allows one to control the sodium of the dish as well as the saltiness of the taste. Water works just fine. One last tip is to add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy before placing the chops back in. Sliced button mushroom don't hurt either.  And to the cook that commented they had added Thai FISH SAUCE to this pork and onion dish...All I can say is "NO! Just plain NO"!

My husband loved this (as did I).  Normally my husband doesn't say much about dinner but this was the exception.  He even mentioned it again the next day when he was eating the leftovers.  I didn't change a thing.  It was wonderful!

Chops were VERY tough - even using the bone-in version.  Sauce was good - but basic caramelized onions would be just as good.

Thank you, Chef John for this recipe. It was easy, fast and delicious. I laid it on a bed of egg noodles. The pork chops were so tender that you did not need a knife. My family loved it...One problem.....I have no leftovers. This one is a keeper. And I will pass this recipe onto my five sisters.

Omg!!! These chops were delicious!! I used all of the recommended seasoning besides the poultry seasoning and added some Tony's and Mrs. Dash to the chops. I had to substitute the buttermilk by adding 1/4 tsp vinegar to the milk. The sauce wasn't very thick but i didn't let it simmer long before adding the chops. My 5 yo son is an extremely picky eater and he kissed me several times and said "Mommy this is the best"!!!! I served it over the left over ranch mashed potatoes from last night.

This did not turn out the way I had hoped. I followed the recipe except didn't have poultry seasoning. Browning the chops went fine. I drained the fat and added the butter and onions. Cooked the onions as directed but they started cooking too fast so I turned down the heat to below medium. In 7 minutes the onions started to burn so I turned the heat down a little more and added the garlic. The onions were really getting dry by this time so I added the flour and got a crumbly paste. I added some of the chicken broth and cooked a couple of minutes. When I added the rest of the broth the onions that weren't burned just dissolved.
I finished cooking as directed and basically got onion gravy. It was tasty but I won't be making it again. IMO the cooking times and temperature are off.

This recipe looked great, so I had to try it.  I had to make a couple of adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have chicken stock, and had to use beef instead. I also have a weird food thing about meat on a bone, and used boneless chops. I had to add a little more flour to get the gravy to thicken enough. Everybody loved it!

I made this almost exactly as listed. I left out the water, substituted half my homemade Greek yogurt and half milk to make the buttermilk requirement, and added a few shakes of Louisiana hot sauce to the gravy. Excellent.

So, so good! I doubled all of the gravy ingredients and used the extra over mashed potatoes that I made with the rest of the container of buttermilk. These were awesome.

This was so good!  I will make this again - even for company.  I did put the chops and the sauce in a corning ware dish, cover with tin foil and bake at 350 for a little bit.  The flavors are just perfect.  The chops turned out very tender.  Love this one!

I have made this recipe twice now in the last week and a half, if you can belieive it.  The first time because I had the ingredients and the second time becaue my husband begged me to.  This recipe, in its simplicity, lends itself to variations.  The second time I had no buttermilk, so I used whipping cream and a splash of dry sherry.  Just as yummy as Chef John's, only different.  His recipes, like his videos, teach you to be confident in your skills, teach you how to trust your instincts and to create meals you will be proud to serve again and again.

great recipe. I put the chops with the sauce in the oven covered and baked for a hour and a half and they turned out great. I also used the same method with beef tips and used beef broth and they also come out great. This is a keeper.

It was good and easy and the boys cleaned their plates and they are super picky. I didn't have buttermilk so I used whole milk. Tasted great and will surely be cooking again.  Thanks Chef John!

This recipe is delicious.  I had to tweek it a little by adding more seasonings and buttermilk.  But overall, I enjoyed this dish and will use this recipe, again.

One of the best pork chops I've ever had and instead of rice, I made mashed potatoes.  I will make this dinner again and again...

I thought it turned out great!! Instead of a yellow onion, I used a white onion because that's what I had on hand. Also, I used sage and savory because I was also out of my poultry seasoning. I do think that the next time I make this, I'll add some worstechire(sp) and a bit of horseradish to it. I also transferred my chops into a baking dish, covered it with the sauce and finished it in a 350 oven covered for about 20min.

Good.  I think I cooked the pork chops too long in the gravy.  They were tough.  The flavor was very good and rich though.  Next time, I will watch the clock carefully to make sure I don't over cook.  I will add mushrooms next time.

This recipe was really delicious.  I used Knox ' s chicken stock instead of the chicken broth, broth is too bland for me.  Otherwise,  followed recipe to the T. Using poultry
 Seasoning was something I'd never tried on pork. It was awesome!   I added garlic and onion powder too. Meat fell of the bone. My family will add this recipe to our monthly menu.  It was very simple and quick to prepare. My 18 yr old daughter was the one that actually prepared it and was very impressed with the ease of preparation and cook time.  Will pass this dish on to family and friends. Thanks chef and keep those recipes coming!

I love this recipe and will make it again.  The milk carton slipped while I was pouring the buttermilk and I added too much so I didn't add the water.  Other than that I made it just as written.  The chops are tender and moist and the gravy is very flavorful.

I sidn't have buttermilk and wanted a really creamy sauce so I subbed for heavy cream. With that said, the gravy was heavenly and exactly what I wanted. Went perfectly with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.

Wow!!! Thank you Chef John for sharing this recipe.
Made this tonight for my husband and I and we loved the taste of the onions,garlic blended with the pork chops...brilliant!
I didn't have buttermilk used plain Greek yogurt, worked well, also didn't have poultry spice so blended up a few spices handy in my pantry.
This recipe is going to continue being enjoyed in our home for years to come.

Was disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and am an experienced cook, but the sauce turned out very thin and the pork chops were bland.

I made this just as written but only two chops for the two of us and increases to two onions since we like them.  Kept the sauce the same.  Did add some red wine along the way.  Served it on couscous.  Excellent! No poultry seasoning so just used salt pepper thyme and marjoram.  Yum!

I don't normally rate recipes, but this was delicious. I made it as written except browned the chops in a nonstick pan coated with cooking spray for less fat. My husband loved it and I had plenty of gravy. The simplicity of the recipe let all the flavors shine. Will make this again soon!

This recipe is amazing. I also added a lil of Famous Dave's country roast seasoning to the chops while browning the chops. I had my pickiest eater taste the amazing gravy. His face lit up and shook his head Yes! I highly recommend this. I served it over a bed of eggs noodles. Delicious!!!

Awesome! I had plenty of gravy left for noodles. I added thyme, sage and white wine, only because I like to add my own touches to recipes. My kids are not big pork fans but rated it 10/10 . I'm glad I used thick bone-in chops. Moist, flavorful and filling.

I made this recipe tonight and the pork chops turned out tough. I used boneless pork chops and brown them the required time. I should have put them in foil when I took them out of the pan. I don't think they need to cook in the gravy but served them with the gravy over them. The taste was good.
