Although I prefer the Herbed Corn recipe from AR, this was a nice side dish. I used about half frozen and half canned corn because that's what I had; rice vinegar in lieu of white wine vinegar; lemon concentrate and omitted the seafood seasoning. My BF didn't care for it but one of my guests really enjoyed it. I also let it sit in the warm oven before serving. Fancy corn!!

This is really good if you like cold corn! Very simple and easy to put together. I didn't have tarragon so I used parsley, but didn't make any other changes.. Thanks for the new recipe to try.

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover green onion before it went bad. This recipe fit the bill. I didn't have a lemon, so I added an extra splash of white wine vinegar. Very yummy! I am looking forward to having this with pork chops for dinner. Thanks for the excellent recipe. ??
