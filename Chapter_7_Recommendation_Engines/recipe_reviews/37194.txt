I thought that this recipe was great.  I used Guldens Spicy mustard instead and used only 1/2 the amount. Definitely have garlic bread to dip in the sauce.  Soooooo good! Thank you

Really good!! Think I will add some mushrooms or sundried tomatoes next time. Used only 1/3 cup of dijon-but will use full amount next time, and no nutmeg!!

My family really enjoyed this recipie.  I used more ravioli than was called for in the recipie (about twice the amount) and there was still plenty of sauce.  I also used about 2 tbs less butter than was called for, and used light instead of heavy cream.  I followed other reviewers advice and only used about one tbs of dijon mustard.  The result was a much lighter sauce with a velvetly (rather than greasy) texture.  A definite company dish.

I made this twice, and the first time it was great.  Why?  Because I had only dry ground  mustard, not actual dijon mustard.  I threw a couple of tablespoons of that in instead of the 1/2 cup of mustard, along with a bit of sour cream.  Mmmm.  My husband and I both had the same thought:  COMPANY DISH.  It was impressive and wonderful.

Fast forward a few weeks, when I decided to make it again -- this time per the recipe exactly.  It was almost inedible.  Why didn't I read the reviews?  I'd definitely make it again, this time with HALF the mustard.

I loved the taste, but cringe at all the fat! Next time I'll grind up the asparagus & mix it in with the sauce, because overall the sauce was missing something and I think if the asparagus flavor was integrated into the sauce it would be just about perfect. It tasted even better the next day.

Wow!!! I loved this recipe.  It was quite easy and not very time consuming.  If you think that dijon mustard is too strong, substitute half of it with honey mustard.  Also, serve it with breadsticks.  Very yummy!

After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to start with 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard and add more if I thought it was necessary.  For our preferance, 2 tbsp worked for us.  (My advice would be to add a small amount and taste as you go along.  You can always add more but per the reviews, everyones taste is not the same.)  I also cooked two chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic, sliced and added to the sauce.  Wanted something a little more than just cheese filled ravioli and they complimented each other nicely.  Thanks

This was absolutely delicious and easy too!  Based on other reviews, I too used 1 TBSP of dijon mustard and I used 1 C of whipping cream and 1/2 C of 2%.  The only suggestion I have is to increase the garlic to 3 or 4 cloves but I love garlic!

This gets nothing but five stars from me. Absolutely delicious. I reduced the recipe down to two servings and saw that there was 1/4 cup of dijon to be used. Decided I better listen to the other reviewers and dropped it in half again. Used fresh shredded parmesan cheese and served with the "Classic Tossed Salad" recipe from this site (see my review). Delicious meld of color and taste. Served with Pepperwood Merlot (a very inexpensive, great wine).

As published, I am afraid I would not have cared for this at all. After reading the earlier reviews, I was warned and used far less mustard than called for, probably two tablespoonsful. The sauce was delicious for us that way. I added sauteed chicken breast chunks and sauteed sliced mushrooms along with the asparagus and ravioli. My husband and I enjoyed it very much. Next time I may skip the ravioli and just use fettucine or other pasta.

I agree that this has a little too much mustard for me.  I added extra whipping cream, a spoonful of sour cream, and sugar to taste to reduce the strong and somewhat bitter taste of the mustard.  It was great after I made the adjustments and very, very rich.  I will definitely use less mustard next time and still add sugar.

I thought this recipe was delicious!!  I cut it in half and used a bit less dijon from reading the other recipes.  Hubby loved it too!  Next time I will try using 1/2 & 1/2 and fat-free parmesan, I'm afraid of all the fat in the original recipe!  But it was easy and fast to make, definitely a keeper!!!!

YUM! This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.  the first time i made it, i didn't think it went well with cheese ravioli, it was too rich.  now i always make it with farfalle, and also add sundried tomatoes to the asparagus.  as suggested by others, i cut down on the mustard amount.  i first used 2 tbsps and thought that was scrumptious.  then my sister suggested we use a little more, so i added 1/4 cup.  i think i liked it that way better.  i also have only used the grey pupon country dijon.  it has mustard sseds in it and makes the sauce have a more visual texture.  i also cut ethe asparagus in smaller pieces, 1" long perhaps and i add extra garlic.  i also have experimented with substituting asiago cheese for the parmesan, yum!

I did as suggested and cut back on the mustard but found it lacked the bite I was expecting. It was good, but there was no 'wow' factor.

Really great recipe, I am only giving it 4 stars because as written, there is WAY too much mustard. I used a little less than 1/4 cup, and think I will probably just use about 3 tbsps next time, otherwise it makes the sauce too greasy. Really good flavor, though!

Didn't read the reviews. Big mistake. Prepared it with that ridiculous amount of mustard and to say it was inedible would be putting it mildly.

My husband and I both liked this recipe. I cut the mustard in half as recommended and it turned out well. This would be a nice dish for a dinner party or romantic evening-easy and quick to prepare yet elegant.Good for vegetarians. Serve with a nice salad and wine.

I followed this recipe as written so I don't know what happened.  It turned out awful, very oily.  I did a lot of recovery work on it, but still not very good.  Sorry, won't make this again.

Wow. Incredibly rich and incredibly easy. Use fresh parmesan and try it with a sweet variety of dijon mustard.

I'm sorry, but my husband and I did not like this at all.  This is the only recipe I've made from this site without first reading the reviews, and I really regret that I didn't read them before I made this.  I added the entire 1/2 cup dijon, and couldn't taste anything but mustard.  In my opinion, alfredo should just not taste like mustard!  The raviolis were great, the asparagus was great, and if I'd only tossed them with olive oil and some parmesan, we would have had a good meal.  We were very disappointed that we wasted perfectly good raviolis and asparagus on this sauce.  We love mustard, but it definitely has its place -- and alfredo is not it!

This recipe was awesome!  I did use half-and-half and the sauce came out perfect.  I do agree, however, that the dijon made the sauce very rich.  I used dijonnaise, not regular dijon, but I will still cut down on the amount of dijonnaise the next time I make this.

REALLY YUMMY!  I USED FROZEN TOTELINI INSTEAD OF RAVIOLI AND HALF & HALF INSTEAD OF WHIPPING CREAM.  CUT THE MUSTARD AND MAKE ASPARAGUS PIECES 1 INCH INSTEAD OF 2 ESPECIALLY IF FEEDING CHILDREN.

This tasted better the second day. My kids wouldn't touch it after the first taste, however. The Dijon was too much for them.

This was a good recipe, but I think next time I'll add more asperagus and less dijon.  I used the real dijon and it was a bit too strong.  Makes a LOT of food! But very tasty.  Maybe adding some sliced sauted almonds would be good too.

I thought this was excellent!  I used cheese ravioli and added some chicken to the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it 3 times for guests (using different mustards).  Everyone who has tried it agrees it's a great recipe but there is something missing.  Nobody has been able to put their finger on it.  Salt helps.

This is a good recipe, not great but good. The flavor's are good but there just seems to be something missing that I can't put my finger on. I would make it again but not on a regular basis.

This is very creamy, and a little heavy on mustard side.  The sauce could be a little thicker.  Very nice with the asparagus.  Tastes like something you would get in a restaurant though!

I put 4 stars due to the adjustments I made - but I absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again based on these adjustments:
2 tablespoons of dijon mustard max (as other reviewer said, start with one and then add if needed).  The hubby's quote after first bite, "definitely no more mustard" - but we liked it as-is at the 2tbsp.
I added a couple of splashes of white wine in the cream mixture after tasting it.  For the parm cheese, I only had a mixed version of it with romano and some herbs.  This was perfect - as I felt a little spice was needed (I did not do nutmeg - forgot and not much a fan anyway).  3 cloves of garlic definitely if you are a garlic lover.  everything else was as-is!  Loved it!  Going to try with chicken next time - think it will be great.  Forgot to mention on orig review - used 1c of whipping cream, 1/2 cup of milk.

I made this a couple of days ago. It was a fabulous gourmet-tasting dish, especially for being so easy to prepare. I made it exactly as written. The "Five Cheese" ravioli I used were extra-large ones, though, and I would have preferred smaller ones like in the recipe's photo. The leftovers didn't reheat particularly well, though, so I'd recommend it be shared and eaten right after it's made. It's a pretty rich dish!

I love this recipe, though I admit it's for mature taste buds.  I like to add chopped prosciutto.  A very simple meal that seems fancy.

Very good alternative to red sauce and Ravioli's. The dijon is a little overpowering so I will cute the amount in half next time.

I made this for my vegetarian daughter and she loved it.  I only had 1/2 & 1/2 on hand so used that and cut down dramaticlly on the mustard as others suggested.  I gave it 4 stars only because I had to change the recipe after reading reviews.

This just wasn't a very good recipe, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I cooked it for dinner when my husband's parents were in town...we ended up ordering pizza instead (much to my kids' joy).

I added an onion to this and used baby spinach instead of asparagus. It turned out pretty good. My husband really liked it. I thought it was nice but mustard isn't a flavouring I particually like with pasta.

On this recipe I did read all the reviews and they were very helpful, Thank You! I decided to use cheese ravioli and I used one pound and nine ounces. Then I used two tablespoons of mustard. And I even only used one cup of whipping cream. However I do like garlic so I did use a little more garlic. But the recipe was still too much or missing something. I'm not sure if it was the mustard or the combination but it is a very flavorful recipe. My family did not really care for it much and said I don't think we should have that one again. BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING!
