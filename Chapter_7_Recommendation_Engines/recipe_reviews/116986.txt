This was very good and very quick to make!  I did use olive oil in place of the butter to saute the onion and I added some garlic to the pan.  The family ate it up... will definitely make again!

This was okay but I didn't care for the lemon taste. I used mixed vegetables. This needed more dill or something. It was okay, but I ended up adding cajun seasoning to mine to get the taste I wanted.

I liked the taste, though my daughter found it a little tart.  However, the combination of small corn kernels with large snap peas made it difficult to get a forkfull that contained both vegetables.  Instead of sugar snap peas, I think this might work better with asparagus or green beans cut into 1" pieces.

Made this on the spur-of-the moment one night, and it is really good.  I added a little more butter and onion but followed the recipe.  I will make it again.
