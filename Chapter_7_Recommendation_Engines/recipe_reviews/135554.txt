Fantastic sweet and very fun dish! Made it for our Fiesta night and the kids along with the adults loved it! It was a nice change after the spicy Mexican dinner. I did double almost everything as we like our sweets a little runnier. Also, if your dish burnt, it's not the recipes fault, I'd say it was the operator's fault! Put down your margaritta and watch the broiler!!

So, the girls and I had a night in dinner, using this as our dessert. Using the broiler (as directed) we ended up with an oven fire within 1 minute of having it in the oven. Literally, flames shooting everywhere!! I will never do this again. Thankfully we got the fire out without calling the fire department!

Oh My...I knew better than to make these since I'm supposed to be on a diet but I was curious and decided to make a small batch..the only substitution I made was to add some nutella as well. These are too good! As with anything in the broiler, you need to watch it closely and make sure it's not too close. Marshmallows & chips burn easily so don't walk away..and don't knock down a recipe because you don't know how to broil things. (btw, I have to throw the rest out or I will eat them all) Thanks for the tasty snack!

Oh I don't know what others thought but this was fun. My kids ate the entire plate. I toasted the sweetened coconut, chopped up dry roasted peanuts, added 1/3 cup more peanut butter and my kids literally killed the plate.....I actually tried it myself and even though I had extra chocolate and peanut butter sauce, I could have made a 2nd batch. We enjoyed this fun little experiment of a recipe....they were hyped up on a sugar rush at bedtime......hahaha Thanks. Will be a movie time treat for them. Kudos.

I made these for a dessert a few days ago and my family loved them. I did double the peanut butter and powder sugar as suggested by another reviewer. I also didn't bother to melt the chocolate chips as they will melt when in the broiler. Oh yeah and last thing that I changed was I didn't do the coconut because my family doesn't like it!! This is a great fast dessert for a mexican themed dinner or just if you have all the ingredients on hand!! Thanks will make lots more!!

I made this at a friend's house, and let their kids help.  It was a huge hit!  Super easy, and a great combination of salty and sweet.

I don't do coconut, so I put bananas on it instead, between the peanut butter and the chocolate...everyone loved it!

I made these for a mexican themed dinner party and they were a hit. I was a little nervous about them, but the first pan I made was eaten up quick and I ended up making another pan full. Delicious with vanilla ice cream.

Great dessert!  The marshmallows burn within about 1 minute, so I recommend doing peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, and coconut in the oven for 5 mins.  Then, add the marshmallows last for 30 seconds or so.  My husband inhaled this.  BUT DON'T LEAVE IT FOR TOO LONG!  It will cause an oven fire.  It didn't for me, but it can.

These were awesome!!  Adapted it the way melisssaharper suggested with the Tostito scoops and chocolate/reese's chips.  Made a pan for an office lunch and they were a huge hit!  You do have to watch them in the broiler, it doesn't take long for them to burn.

This was ok, not a big hit in my family, but it was cool to make. A little too sweet for me and my husband, my son tried it but did not go back for seconds. Dont think I'll make again but think its a cool idea

So fun to make! I was not fond of the peanut butter and the coconut cooked way too fast! Other than that the salt and sweet combination was great and the little ones LOVED it!!

We liked these nachos.  I had a cold and couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I would like but they were still good and my husband thought they were really good.  I didn't bother to melt down the chocolate chips first, instead I layed down the tortilla chips first, then drizzled with melted peanut butter mixture and then scattered chocolate chips on top along with peanuts coconut and miniture marshmallows.  It all melted perfectly under the broiler and I loved the texture of the marshmallows.  A great sweet,salty and crunchy,chewy desert.

I just changed the size of the chips.  Otherwise made it as written and it was excellent.  They only burn fast if you don't watch them and put them too close to the element.  We loved them and the marshmallows were a nice golden brown.  Easy to make.  Good directions.  I used a drizzling spoon and that helped a lot.

This was just OK for us. We really didn't care for the flavor of the tortillas with the other flavors and the coconut was out of place for us. This was fun to try, though...Thanks for sharing. :)

"Why do you do this to us??"  That is what my family says when I make these.  They can't stop eating them, especially the grandkids.  My 5 year old granddaughter hordes them and hides them from her brothers.  I will use one of the suggestions next time though - to use chips in the scoops instead of melting the chocolate.  Much easier.

These were surprising good.  I did however make a few changes, using organic freshly ground peanut butter instead of the jarred type.   Because of this I added some virgin organic coconut oil in the peanut butter and sugar mix to compensate for  lack of  junk oil used in most peanut butters.  Also, I can see why one reader had a bad experience when her oven caught fire.  marshmallows are very flammable, and if  they start to smoke, your done, and get them out of the oven.  not too close to the broiler!

Sounds great and super easy :) also I love that most ingredients could be changed as needed/wanted :) 
A broiler? Errr, I guess that's what Americans call the grill :) 
Thanks for the recipe, it's great!

I made this by the recipe and it was awesome.  I have read a negative comment about the marshmallows on fire...it does not take long at all for marshmallows to brown.  Put them in the oven and keep peeking in on them quite frequently.   And the broiler is best (as far as oven cooking them goes) to get a nice golden brown marshmallow but you have to literally stand right there with them and keep an eye on them.  No complaints from me tho.  I thought they were awesome and I will definitely make them again.

I substituted chocolate bark for the chips and used a few more marshmallows.  Tastes really good but hard to melt the ingredients.  Added a little shortening to be able to latel it on the chips
