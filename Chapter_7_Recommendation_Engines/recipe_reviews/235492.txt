Very easy to make and everyone said it was a great blend of seasoning. I added spiced rum instead of plain!

I chilled the nog before adding rum because alcohol starts to evaporate at 80 degrees. ;-)

I just made this today for myself and it is very good.  The only thing is I didn't get it smooth enough.  I will make it again until I perfect it.  This recipe is as good, if not better, than the store brands;  it was very quick and easy to make as well.

This has become a holiday tradition in our home but this year my nog seems like it is not as creamy as in the past.  I followed the directions, same as always...anyone have any idea why it may have turned out this way?
