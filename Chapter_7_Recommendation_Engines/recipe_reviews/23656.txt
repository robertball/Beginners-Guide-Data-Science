This is always a fantastic pie.  I never freeze it, though.  Instead, I just put it in the fridge.  Also, I use an oreo crust and whip up fresh whipping cream with a little powdered sugar and vanilla and mound that on top of the pie.  This recipe is actually inside the box of Baker's German Sweet Chocolate.

this was good and SO easy to make.  but i'm not sure the graham cracker crust is the best for it. other reviewers may have stated this as well:  an oreo crust would work better.  or maybe even a regular pie crust?  don't know how well that would freeze, though.  might be too hard to cut through?  i loved how you don't have to bake it either.  after putting it in the freezer i kept waiting to go check on it in the oven!  :)  thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This pie was soooo good-very creamy and super-rich! Instead of the graham cracker crust, I made a chocolate cookie crumb crust.  The subtle chocolate flavor of the pie with the crispy chocolate crust was a perfect combination!

This was awesome. I, too, bought a low-fat crust, used skim milk, used Splenda instead of sugar, and used Cool-Whip Free, and reduced-fat cream cheese. No one would have guessed. This pie got rave reviews and I have made it two more times in the past week for everyone who enjoyed it the first time around. Great recipe. Thanks!

I used the really large size Mr. Goodbar (probably 8 oz.) in this recipe and light cream cheese. Also, I stored it in the freezer. It didn't last long at my house. This is soooo yummy. Will definitely make again.

Love this pie! 
I put 1/3 cup of hazelnut coffee creamer instead of milk. It gave it a little extra kick.

Let me just say this was THE most delicious and creamiest chocolate pie that has ever touched my lips! It will be enjoyed by my family for years to come. I made two, we are dessert happy people and there are a lot of us, and I wanted to try two kinds of pie crust with it, they both were amazing! Graham Cracker crust and a cream cheese crust (amazing and SO easy!) I recommend a slice of each!

This was so good and incredibly easy to make which is good because I tend to not be a great baker. I used skim milk, fat free whipped topping and light cream cheese in a reduced fat graham cracker crust and you would NEVER know. It was that good. I have made this twice now and I think that it tastes the best completely frozen but definitely not bad when it has thawed either.

I have made this pie several times now, exactly as written, and always get compliments and requests to make it again. The filling is pretty versatile too, my daughter and I have filled krumkake with it and it was delicious! I bet it would be great in a puff pastry as well.

WOW!  I have been searching for a good chocolate pie recipe...and yes, this is it!  I used dark chocolate chips (what I had on hand).  Be sure to save some cream for topping...and next time I will try this pie with a traditional pastry crust.

It was good, but I made mine with an oreo crust rather than graham cracker.  I think it could be better without as much whipped cream, next time I make it I'll probably try 2-2 1/2 cups rather than the full 3 1/2.  If you put too much whipped cream, the filling ends up tasting like cool whip with chocolate syrup added to it.  Let the chocolate speak for itself! But it's worth another try and it's easy to make!

I love this pie! I used an oreo cookie crust instead of graham cracker like others suggested. I dont think it has to be frozen, but its really good that way! Although it does melt pretty quick if its left out :) Will definitely keep this recipe!

I only gave 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I made some changes based on what I had on hand & it turned out great! I didn't have German chocolate, so I used Andes chocolate mint pieces and a touch of peppermint extract. I crushed some Girl Scout thin mint cookies and stirred them into the cream cheese mixture. It was truly delicious, creamy, and refreshing on a hot Texas summer night.

Fantastic! My family loved this pie! It almost tastes like ice cream! I agree with the other reviewers that an oreo crust can't be beat if you love chocolate but the pie tastes just as good in a traditional graham cracker crust to. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My mother-in-law always makes chocolate pie for my husband for Thanksgiving.  Since she wasn't joining us this year I decided to make the chocolate pie.  I wanted to make something a little nicer than the standard Jello pudding chocolate pie, and this recipe fit the bill.  I used an Oreo crust and topped the pie with crushed mint Oreo cookies.  It was a hit, and VERY easy to make!  It was the first of the Thanksgiving desserts to be finished off.

This pie is SUPER simple to make. My nephew and I whipped this up in an hour (including the time it took to go shopping lol). We changed it up a bit though. We spooned in about half of the filling and then topped it with crushed Oreo pieces, then spooned in the rest of the filling. We then did little dollops of the cool-whip around the edge and drizzled Caramel over the pie. DELISH!

I made this for my son's birthday as we all wanted something lighter than cake. I increased the recipe by half and divided it into 2 - 8 inch chocolate cookie pie crusts. Then I topped it with a thin layer of cool whip, drizzled Hershey syrup on top and sprinkled with mini-chocolate chips. It no only tasted divine, it looked pretty too!

I’m not sure how to review it since I didn’t actually follow the recipe completely. I misread it and bought heavy whipping cream, rather than cool whip. When I realized what I had done, I was already too far into it. So, I whipped up the cream, added some sugar, and used that instead. Since it isn’t as dense, I used more than I would have cool whip but honestly, I don’t know how much, I just “eye balled” it. It was delicious. I am not a fan of cool whip so I am guessing I would not have even tried it if I had noticed prior to starting it. I will definitely make it again and will continue to use whipping cream rather than cool whip.

This is delicious!!  My son is crazy about French silk pie and this has a similar yet lighter chocolate flavor.  I did not use 12 oz Cool Whip, I used the 8 oz tub.  I was worried about it at first but there was plenty of filling and I think the chocolate flavor might have even been lost with more cool whip.  Will definitely make this again!  Very easy!  Perfect to make in the morning for a party in the afternoon ??

It actually turned out as pretty as in the picture! And it was surprisingly easy to make. I substituted a chocolate graham crust and sugar free whipped topping.

Pretty good.  I used a chocolate cookie crust per other reviews (num).  Preferred eating it frozen or mostly frozen, because all I could taste was the cream cheese.  I might make again but use only half of the cream cheese.

This is one of my Thanksgiving pies this year- not necessarily traditional, but a big hit with chocolate lovers. I use the store-bought Oreo crust, pipe cool whip on top and drizzle chocolate syrup before serving. Thanks for this great recipe!

I am ashamed to say that I ate the whole pie over a 3 day period because it was SO good. I kept it frozen since I love the cool smooth texture. This pie is fail safe and so easy to make that it should be on everyone's go-to list. But beware....there is nothing diet about this one!

I needed something i could throw together fast that everyone would like, and this was perfect.  It's a little too sweet and simple for my taste, but for the time invested it was a huge success.

This was very good and fairly easy to make. I made my own whipped cream for it and saved a portion to top the pie with, which I stirred coconut flakes in. My husband is a huge fan of German Chocolate Pie and loves the kind from Pioneer Pies, this recipe comes very close to beating it!

This was super easy, and super duper yummy!  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit (we advised everyone to stay away from it so we could have left overs).  I had to refrigerate it every 15 minutes or so, but that just made it easier to have more leftover.  :)

A new favorite! A nice rich deep flavor without being too sweet. I saved some chocolate to make chocolate curls on top. The hazelnut creamer sounds like a great idea - I may try that next.

This is one of my favorites. I have been making this pie for years and everyone always wants the recipe. I usually double the cream cheese(lite), omit the sugar, and add all of the cool whip(lite) to the mixture. The hazelnut creamer is a good idea. I am a coffee drinker so maybe adding a little espresso flavor would be great as well.

I have made this pie several times on different occations and every time it has disappeared within an hour or two of it being ready. It is certainly a crowd pleaser.

Very good & easy to make.  Very rich, I think I was expecting the taste to be a little different.
