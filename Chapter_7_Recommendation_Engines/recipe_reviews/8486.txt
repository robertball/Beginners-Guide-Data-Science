I have been using this frosting recipe for almost 50 years!  If you want a "bittersweet" frosting, leave off the vanilla.  I do not add it anymore, and we like it better.  Can easily add another square of chocolate for even fudgier frosting.  I often halve the sugar & butter and use 2 sqs. of chocolate for 13X9 cakes.  Save a lot of fat gms. and calories, and my husband never knows the difference.  If you make a layer cake, you must use the full recipe.  I usually need only 1/3 C milk for the right consistency.  Whip the frosting on high for a couple of mins. to make it fluffier.

This recipe is very close to the recipe printed on the Baker's unsweetened chocolate box.  The Baker's recipe calls for an extra square of chocolate (4 oz. total) and 1/3 cup milk.  When I saw the comments from other reviewers that it wasn't enough chocolate and too much milk I just went with the Baker's recipe.

Wow...what an incredibly beautiful frosting! Smooth, shiny, spreadable,  decadently fudgey and creamy, this is without a doubt one of the best chocolate fudge frostings ever. I used 4 ounces of fine quality chocolate and 1/2 cup milk and it was simply perfect, ready to spread after standing about 5-10 minutes. My only suggestion would be that while this is adequate for a 13x9" cake, my 2-layer cake could easily have used another half recipe, even a double recipe if decorated.

Oh my goodness!  This was the most phenomenal chocolate frosting I have ever made.  Its the first one I made, not using cocoa powder, and I will never go back.  I had to make a birthday cake for someone who loves chocolate - oh my, this one requires a big glass of milk alongside.  I actually doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough to frost a layer cake, and I ended up only adding the first amount of milk because I thought it appeared too thin.  As it began to set, it was just perfect.  Once I had the layers frosted, I thinned out a portion to use for piping and decorating, because I was afraid it wouldn't come through the tip, and it was perfect.  This is now my chocolate frosting recipe.  And anyone who said it wasn't sweet enough is just crazy.

Very good fudgy frosting, easy to make.  But definitely have to WAIT for it to set before spreading or it will spread too much

This is the perfect chocolate frosting recipe. It is so flexible. I made a yellow sheet cake, and punched holes in the cake while it was hot. I made the frosting exactly as the recipe...using 1/2 cup of the milk.  I then separated one cup of the frosting, added more milk for a thinner consistency, and poured this over the hot cake. The frosting ran in the holes. After the cake cooled, I frosted with the thicker frosting. It was HEAVEN SENT! Thank you for sharing the recipe Carrie.

Overall, this recipe is very good, the frosting tasted wonderful on chocolate cake. The only bad thing I noticed was that it was a little bit thin and runny, even after it had cooled.

What an incredibly smooth chocolately frosting!  I used 3 - 1 oz. squares of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate plus 2 oz. of Hershey's dark chocolate.  I only used 5 Tbsp. of milk to get the right consistency. It was perfect for Black Magic Cake from this site.

Oh, this is good! Much better than the buttercream frostings I hear referred to so often. I used a double dose of this recipe to frost my first cake ever, a 4-layer devil's food cake, and it turned out very well. Everyone that had a piece absolutely adored it. I loved the frosting, especially. Even when the cake itself became dry, the frosting was still moist and delicious.

So yummy!  I used it to frost the Black Chocolate Cake from this site (I made 2 9-in round layers) and this made PLENTY of icing (with leftovers) to frost the top, sides and a layer in between the two rounds.  Looks and tastes great!  I did use slightly less milk than the recipe called for and it set to a useable texture in about 5 minutes.

Holy smokes- I'll never use any other chocolate frosting recipe again; sooooo easy, soooooo decadent and pretty.  I used 4 oz of chocolate, and needed no more than 1/2 cup milk (and after some internet investigating, found that 1 lb powd. sugar is equal to 4 cups).  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This frosting is the bomb! I should mention that my review is based on adding a extra 1 oz. chocolate. I used about 1/2 cup of milk. I let it sit for about 10 minutes and it was perfect for piping onto cupcakes. I made half again as much frosting and it was the perfect amount for about 30 cupcakes. This will be my go-to chocolate frosting recipe from now on!

WOW!  This is delicious, fudgey, decadent frosting!  A cinch to make, and also spread very easily, making decorating the cake a breeze!  I followed the reviewers' two main tips- 4 oz of chocolate and 1/2 cup milk- and thought that the taste and consistency were perfect!  As written, this recipe yields the right amount for one cake, but when I make a double layer cake, I find that one-and-a-halfing the recipe is necessary.  Thanks so much i love this frosting!! :)

Too much milk, not enough chocolate (to offset the sugar, needs salt (I do not think salted butter is the answer, just add some salt to taste at the end and stir). This is, as others have said, identical to the Baker's chocolate recipe on the box except this one has been modified, and not for the better. With this much milk, you have to add the entire 4 cups of sugar, and then it's too sweet to be a fudge frosting. Reducing the milk and adding chocolate (which is what the Baker's recipe says to do anyway) is the solution. Any frosting with "fudge" in the name should be redolent with chocolate taste, and not so much on the sugar taste. Thanks for the recipe, it's made my house smell delicious!

This is much better, in my opnion, than the powdered sugar and cocoa powder buttercream.  The melted chocolate gives a much deeper and richer flavor.

One word....YUMMY! I used whipping cream in place of the milk as I wanted a richer frosting and a more professional taste. I will be using this again for sure!!

I love, love this recipe - the frosting rocked!  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used 4 squares of chocolate and 1/2 cup of milk...FABULOUS!  My only mistake was not putting this delicious frosting on homemade cupcakes...I used a box (and while it was great and everyone loved the cupcakes) this frosting deserves a more decadent foundation : )...a nice dense, homemade cake or cupcakes (IMO).  Thanks You!

Great frosting.  Perfect on cakes.  I made one change - only used 1/2 cup milk and that gave me the perfect spreading consistency.

Excellent recipe! Very fudgy and chocolatey, just like the title indicates! I don't keep unsweetened chocolate squares around much so I just used the substitution for cocoa and butter (1T butter to 3T cocoa). SO rich and decadent and beautifully creamy... mmm!

As one of my kids put it, this frosting would make dirt taste good.  This came together perfectly, piped onto the peanut butter cupcakes beautifully, and tasted amazing.  Definitely a winning chocolate frosting recipe!

While I have a lot to learn about cake decorating I can certainly slather on frosting and shake on sprinkles.  As other reviewers suggested I used 4 oz. of chocolate and 1/2 cup of milk in this frosting.  It was perfect paired with David's Yellow Cake from this site. Yummy!!!

EXCELLENT! I omitted the vanilla extract and replaced the milk with coffee. SO RICH! I wanted a bit thicker texture but not slap-you-in-the-face sweetness, so instead of adding more sugar to thicken it I added 1 tablespoon of corn starch. Perfect!

I was shocked at how beautifully this came together, without any cooking on the stove!  It is fudgy and rich, and easy!  It was a little too much for a 13x9 cake, but the leftovers are great on graham crackers.

This recipe is a keeper.  I will use this from now on, easy to make and delicious result.  It frosts 24 cupcakes perfectly.  We added red, white and blue sprinkles for the 4th of July.

Great fudgy frosting!  I used mine to frost brownies. There is no way that 3/4 cup of milk is correct.  I only put 4T of milk and it came out perfect.

This is the best fudge frosting I've ever made!  I didn't make any modifications to the recipe; it turned out exactly like I hoped it would.

Tasted great but recipe calls for way too much milk.  Also I used 4 squares of chocolate and that was perfect, ended up using a little less than 1/2 cup milk total.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  With all that confectioner's sugar you don't need the chocolate to be sweetened too.  Would make this again with my adjustments.

Great, easy fudgy frosting!! Remember to add only 1/2 cup of milk, and then only add enough more for your desired consistency(actually, mine was a little on the thin side, but by the time my cake cooled, the frosting had firmed up some).  It was perfect, actually, I have had problems with other recipes seeming right, but after frosting the cake, it had gotten to hard.  This icing stayed great even after a few days (normally all the cake would have been gone, but we went out of town for a few days).This is definatley the recipes I will always use now.

I doubled the recipe for 40 cupcakes, perfect after adding 1 more cup of powdered sugar.  Excellent fudgey flavor and I used semi-sweet Baker's chocolate squares.

This was a good bittersweet chocolate recipe, however it wasn't my favorite.  I wish I had read the reviews first so that I could have put less milk in.  It wasn't very firm, but that's what you get when you're in a hurry and you don't read the reviews!!  I would use this again, but not my favorite.

Very yummy and rich!  When I first put everything together I was very scared...it was runny and looked horrible, but the longer I whipped it up with my mixer the better it looked!  Great for a rich chocolate icing!

I love this frosting because it is the perfect sweetness! I usually double the recipe because I make layered cakes and only use 3/4 of a cup of milk so the frosting isn't too runny.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added a 4th ounce of baking chocolate, and I was careful to put the milk in a bit at a time.  But, my  frosting was a pale tan - NOT the deep glossy brown shown in the photo, and it just tasted like sugar.  So,  I then added 3 more squares of baking chocolate (double the amount specified in the recipe), and only then got a chocolate flavor that wasn't overpowered by the confectioner's sugar.  But, the color is still pale tan, and instead of being a glossy, rich fudge consistency, it is just stiff with sugar.  I had hoped for a frosting similar to a Boston Cream Pie.  I definitely will NOT use this recipe again.

This was the frosting I used for a friend's birthday cake.  When he tasted this frosting, he had a huge smile.  According to him, this is how frosting should be.  I did adjust the amount of milk used, starting with 1/4 cup and then add small dribbles until it was the consistency was right.

Awesome flavor to this frosting!  It tastes just like fudge.  However, way too much milk.  I suggest starting out with 1/4 cup and adding more as needed.  Also, it is better if you use a hand blender.  It needs to be soft and shiny or it tastes grainy and too much like confectioner's sugar.  I gave it a 3 because I had to use 1 1/2 lbs of powdered sugar and I'm not sure if I will still have to add more.  I had to refrigerate it just to thicken it up.  This, after hours of sitting at room temp.

This is the perfect chocolate frosting recipe.  The tweaks that make it perfect for me are: always use 4 ounces of chocolate to 1 pound of sugar, and I never need more than 1/2 cup of milk to smooth it out.  Just the right amount to frost a double-layer 9" cake.  Perfect every time.

Excellent fudge-like consistency.  Definitely a keeper.  I only used 1/2 cup of milk, but I live in a cool, humid area.  You might want to start with the 1/2 cup and add more if needed after it's set up.

The taste of this "frosting" is great.  I'm completely baffled by its consistency, however -- it came out like a ganache even after an hour in the fridge. How long does "let stand" mean?  **IF** I try this frosting again, I will add milk by the tablespoon and go from there.  I can see this working fine on brownies or a 9x13 -- something that doesn't come out of the pan.  But I tried it with cupcakes and found it far too runny. I followed the recipe exactly, using the converter to halve the quantities (I did leave out the vanilla). Still looking for that perfect chocolate frosting.

Mine did not set up AT ALL, lol. It looked like a beautiful ganache instead. I'm guessing I simply did not add enough confectioners sugar, (1 lb.). I thought one lb. was a lot, but obviously it didn't go far enough. Next time, I think I'll do the lb., but then keep adding and adding. Waiting to have it set up, like the recipe says, is a little confusing. But, I'll have to just keep on experimenting. Tasted WONDERFUL, set up or not. :) Thanks!

I think it was too much milk, even after adding more sugar still not the right consistency for what I had in mind. Also added another square bringing the total to 4, still not chocolatey enough, comes out looking like milk chocolate rather than a dark chocolate. Taste just ok in my opinion.

Quite good. An extra square of choc and some cocoa powder didn't hurt. Leave it at 1/2 c milk and the consistency is just right. Kind of fluffy and moist, not too fudgy.

There was a few problems with the recipe, but there wasn't anything wrong with the actual recipe. We were making half of the recipe, and my father put in the whole amount of milk. So we cooled it in the fridge, heated it up again, and cooled it again overnight. It still didn't thicken, even when putting more sugar in it. But, I brought it to a party anyway, and it made a great dipping! We dipped the cupcakes I made (Cream-Filled Cupcakes) and pretzels, and we ate ourselves sick! So don't throw it away if you mess up!

This frosting recipe definitely has potential. It needs quite a bit of time to set so next time I will make this the day before I want to frost a cake. I will also try using less milk as suggested by other reviewers.

I was a little wary to make this recipe because I am taking them to work tomorrow and some of the comments almost scared me away...ALMOST.  I used 1/4 c. milk only and this is the best frosting I have ever made.  I love it more than the buttercream I am used to making.  Definitely a keeper!  I was able to frost almost 60 mini cupcakes with just one batch!

I liked the flavor of this frosting but it was a bit thin for my taste even after giving it time to set up.  I didn't add any of the additional milk and ended up adding a little more soft butter and powdered sugar to make it the consistency I preferred.   I will make this again because the taste was good!

This is great frosting. Someone complained that it was thin. As always you need to watch the amount of milk, but mine came out perfect. Great recipe.

I didn't follow the directions on this at all.  I melted the chocolate by itself, set aside.  Whipped the butter until creamy, then added the sugar, milk and vanilla slowly.  Lastly, I added the melted chocolate.  Delicious!

Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the directions and it turned out like a glaze instead of a frosting. I tried to correct it by adding another half recipe w/ much less milk (1/8 cup) and still not thick enough for frosting a layer cake. I thought about using it anyway but then I tasted it, WAY TOO SWEET for my taste. It was sweeter than bought icing. I gave up.

This has excellent taste, very delish!  However, mine did not set up, we had to add a cup and a 1/2 of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour (!) and we are hoping that it will be good for our cupcakes.  definitely dial down the milk in the recipe, previous person suggested 5 tablespoons, not sure how that compares with 3/4 cup... but if we spread it as is, it would fall off our cupcakes.

This is SO delicious! I left out the vanilla, because I didn't have any, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I covered a 9x13 pound cake very generously and had about 3/4 cup left over. It developed a hard skin, which gave a very pleasant crunchy outside, then moist inside, and it looked very pretty on the cake. I got rave reviews! Thanks!!

Thanks to recipe submitters and Thanks to all previous reviewers, especially msf27 that suggested 1 lb sugar is 4 cups...anyhow, I only added 1/2 cup milk but did add 4 oz of chocolate instead of three.  Yes it was more sweet than chocoloatey, but it was Very Good! Still 5 star from this chocolate lover!!  Easy to make too!

I have never made chocolate frosting from scratch or even really like chocolate cake or frosting but this was awesome!  I made this on a chocolate cake the other nite for dessert and it tasted wonderful.  I only had half the amt of butter on hand so I subsituted with margarine which really made it runny i think so i added cocoa powder and lots of powdered sugar.  Even so, it turned out delicious!  Thank you so much for such an easy, delicious recipe!!

This was a very good frosting.  I upped the chocolate to 4 oz. and used 1/2 cup of milk, and it was perfect.  I piped it on my daughter's birthday ice cream cone cupcakes.  (Remember those?)  Needless to say my newly turned 6 year old is very impressed!  Infact, we all were.

So very good!!!  It was a little thin, I used the 2 tbsp of milk, and had to add some extra powdered suger to thicken it up.  But it was delicious and perfect on a chocolate cake!

Not impressed at all.  I had to add 12oz of chocolate to get a chocolate flavor.  I did use semisweet.  It tasted like powdered sugar.  Does thicken up after about 5 minutes to spread, it was difficult to spread as I was icing the cake.  I will keep looking, thanks anyway.

This frosting is very "old-fashioned". My great-grandmother used it on her cakes, and I am so glad to have found it again. Though it is much sweeter than a store-bought, it tastes better. I used it on the Black Chocolate Cake recipe from this site, and it was enough to cover the entire cake, as one reviewer noted. I only used 1/2 cup of milk, thanks to suggestions, and it was ready to spread in less than 2 minutes. The cake set out for a while, and the icing did not get hard or crust over, it stayed smooth and creamy. Very good!

I wasn't impressed with this, even though I followed reviewers advice and cut the milk to 1/2 a cup and added an ounce of chocolate. It wasn't runny, but the flavor was nothing special.

I did not find this sweet at all, there is no way you can use unsweetened chocolate in this recipe. I followed other people's advice by cutting down the milk (you MUST do this)I also used unsalted butter, and I still had to add more sugar, to make it sweeter and thicker. The frosting was not as good as I expected. I would make it again with semisweet chocolate, but we will see.

This recipe tasted pretty good, but it was very runny and hard to work with.  I would definitely use less milk, because even after the frosting stands, its still very thin.  However, I used to to ice a professional looking cake and since it practically poured on, it looked great on the cake..very smooth!

I have found the ultimate chocolate frosting recipe. Thanks you previous reviewers for the warning about the milk. It is far too much. I increased the recipe and did not use the amount called for in the recipe. Thanks for sharing Carrie.

lovely frosting!  As written, I think there would be wayyy too much milk.  As written, is more like a glaze.  This almost tastes like a ganoche.  It is satiny smooth with a silky like satin texture and a lovely sheen to it.  I love it because there is no butter to soften and beat.  Just straight from the fridge and melt in a pan.  Although it is not an extremely dark chocolate, it is incredibly fudgey tasting.  There is just the perfect amount of butter and is not greasy tasting.  I simply added the chocolate mixture to my confectioner's sugar and added milk accordingly.  It does firm up a bit when cooled at room temp.  This is a keeper.  It is perfect for "Linda's Awesome Brownies" from this site because this brownie is not very sweet so this compliments it wonderfully.  Would definitely make again.

Thank you for the most incredible frosting recipe EVER! I couldn't believe how easy this was...and the taste and texture are just wonderful. Really fudgy tasting. I even had to use skim milk and it was still rich and delicious. This will definitely be my staple chocolate/fudge frosting recipe! Thanks!

Wonderful!  Half of this recipe is PLENTY for cupcakes.  Also, I used much less milk than called for.  Tip:  Add the chocolate and butter while hot so it will melt the powdered sugar and not leave lumps.  Stir well with a wired whisk.  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLEEENNNNNNNNNT!!!!! I used this for a friend's 40th birthday cake and made 2 double batches.  I was concerned that the consistency was too runny, but after 30 min. in fridge, it spread like a dream.  This is the ONLY chocolate icing recipe for me.

Delightful!  Smooth, creamy, and the chocolate flavor's not too intense, so it nicely compliments the deep dark chocolate cupcakes on which I used it.  Just one recipe frosted 48 cupcakes.  Honestly, I would characterize it as "fudgy," but it's definetly delicious.  It gets four stars because of personal preference - I honestly missed the tanginess that cream cheese gives chocolate frostings.

Was worried because i had to substitute cocoa powder instead of the squares. But it worked beautifully... Used 9 tbsp of cocoa and 3 tbsp of shortening to replace the 3 oz squares. Great recipe!

This frosting is delicious and fudgy. I even used melted bittersweet chocolate with great results! I would not make it without the vanilla..as a previous reviewer said -but be sure to use real vanilla extract...it is divine and well loved by everyone. This is my go to recipe, stop searching - THIS IS IT!

Used this recipe on hubby's birthday cake (Black Magic Cake from this site), and it was pretty good! Easy to throw together. I did have to refrigerate it for a bit to get it to the texture I wanted in order to frost the cake, but it set up and spread very easily. A good alternative to traditional buttercream.

Easy and quick, especially if you melt ingredients in microwave. Definitely only needs half cup of milk. I actually used half & half and it was delicious!!

So sweet & yummy, but way too thin. I followed the suggestions and cut the milk in half and let it rest, but it was still way to thin. I literally poured it on my cake. Luckily I had made the cake in a 9x13 pan, so it wasn't really a problem, but it would have been a disaster for cupcakes or a layer cake. Because it was so yummy, I am going to attempt it once more and use even less milk.

It tastes very good but at room temperature it just runs right off. It slipped right off the cupcakes I made after fully cooling. I had to add a bunch of ingredients to thicken it. I was very dissapointed.

The best ever chocolate frosting!  I used unsweetened cocoa 3TBS Cocoa + 1 TBS Oil = 1 square & left out the vanilla. Once it sits for about 3 to 5 minutes the consistency is perfect, smooth, creamy and not too sweet

I'm not sure I would make this frosting again since I couldn't stop sampling it! I really like my buttercream frosting but when I realized I didn't have any cocoa, I started looking for a recipe using baker's chocolate. What is a cake? A vehicle for frosting! This is the best chocolate frosting I've made or eaten. YUM.

One note: I only used half the milk and was fortunate to have extra powdered sugar on hand because it was initially not nearly thick enough. Next time I will start with about 1/4 of milk and go from there.

I first tried it with castor sugar but it didn't work out well at first, but then if you heat it all up and add a bit of cocoa powder it's really good too! Which is great because our stores have a big icing sugar shortage for some reason.

Good flavor but had to keep adding more and more sugar to get it to a consistency that did not run off the cake.  If you want a chocolate glaze, this is a good recipe for that.  If yo want something you can pipe or swirl, be ready to use more than one pound of confectioners' sugar.

I debated between giving this 5 or 4 stars.  It makes a very good, very chocolately frosting, and sets up nicely; I made it exactly as written (I probably did not use all of the last 1/4 cup of milk, but most of it).  It was plenty for a 9" 2-layer cake.  The reason I thought about giving it a lower rating is because I was looking for a truly fudge-type frosting (with which I could frost a layer cake) - the fudge frosting recipes I found on this website called for a hot recipe, pouring it on a sheet cake and then letting it set.  So I would call this a chocolate frosting, but not a chocolate fudge frosting.  But it is definitely tasty!

My heavens!  This might be the real "death by chocolate!"  

I actually used 4 squares and only 3 cups powdered sugar, sifted.  I put in 2 tsp. of vanilla and slowly added milk.  When I had added about 1/4 cup of milk, the consistency was very chocolate truffle-ish, which made me think I should try this again, add less milk, and then refrigerate and make chocolate truffles rolled in cocoa or dipped in melted chocolate.  I might kill people with the richness, but they would die happy.  :)  Anyway--added the rest of the milk, then spread on to a 9x13 warm cake.  It looks delicious and is calling me as I type!

This needed extra milk (I used organic half and half) but ended up a lovely consistency.  I thought it was way too sweet, but my children loved it.  Next time I would double the chocolate.

This recipe was super easy with pretty great results. I only used 1/2 cup of milk - I think if I'd used the full 3/4 cup, I wouldn't have been able to pipe it (I'd have had to pour it over the cake, like a ganache). The result was almost exactly what I was looking for - not quite as fudgy as I'd hoped, but I'm pretty sure what I want to achieve can only be done through the soft-ball method. With that being said, I'd call this recipe a lifesaver and I'm definitely adding it to my recipe collection. Thank you Caroline!

The only thing I changed was the amount of vanilla and I added almond extract because I love the taste of almonds and chocolate. 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/8th tsp almond!! And also the following other peoples suggestion I didn't use as much milk. I will no longer be using store bought chocolate frosting. Not the same but just as good in it's own way!

Well, I wish I had read the reviews before attempting this. I made a double batch so I could frost 30 cupcakes and a two layer cake. I ended up with chocolate soup. Seriously...why on earth has this recipe not been corrected? I tried to thicken it up with more sugar and...yuck. Started over and used 1/4 cup milk. This time it was perfect. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't ask for 3x the amount of milk needed.

This frosting is fabulous in taste, consistency and looks.  I use 3 squares unsweetened chocolate, 4 cups sifted confectioner's sugar and I sift in 3/4 to 1 cup of cocoa powder to give a richer chocolate flavor.  The unsweetened chocolate and cocoa powder reduce the sweetness to a reasonable level.  I have used almond flavoring instead of vanilla to change it up.  Plenty to frost two 9 inch rounds including in between the layers.  I have used this recipe several times and will keep using it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I use 4 c powdered sugar, 1/2 c milk.  This is a good icing, sometimes a little too sweet though.  I'll keep playing with it.

This frosting recipe is way too sweet. It's the kind of sweet that burns your tongue!!  All I could taste was the confectioners sugar. I decided to use this recipe because of all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and the only positive thing to say is it did set up after sitting in the fridge!! I was worried because it was so runny! Unfortunately I have to keep looking!!

I always used cocoa to make my chocolate frosting, this is so much better. The chocolate flavor is awesome.  I made orange flavored cupcakes and wow what a combo it was. It is my family favorite from now on. I agree with others about using less milk, I too had to add more sugar.

I am giving this recipe a 4 because I altered the original recipe.  I added one more oz of chocolate and decreased the milk.  I would suggest those who make this only add as much milk as needed to reach the desired consistency.  I will keep this recipe for a quick delicious frosting.

This frosting saved the birthday cake I made for my husband last weekend.  I attempted to make a german chocolate cake but I didn't use enough spray on the pans.  So, the cake came out in pieces and I used this frosting to hide the fact that it was such a mess.  It saved my husbands birthday cake.  I had run out of time for the back up pan of brownies.

This was alright icing, but I thought it tasted more like sugar than chocolate.  Ended up adding a lot of cocoa for more fudge like taste (was out of squares.)  Consistency was good though.

This frosting is fabulous.  I tried to make it according to the directions, but I bought semi-sweet bars on accident.  I used the recommendation and added 4 oz of chocolate.  Since I had semi-sweet chocolate, I only added 2 cups of powdered sugar.  It was great, fudgy and a little sweet.  I used it to top the One Bowl chocolate cake on this website.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! I use this all the time. I add 2TB cocoa powder and 2TB milk chocolate but that's because I wanted to experiment. I have made the recipe "as is" and it is still terrific!

This is my first review but this recipe was so easy and good that I had to share two things.  First, the 1lb confectioners sugar is 4 cups.  Second, I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 milk (instead of 3/4 cup) and it set up perfectly.  This frosting turned out excellent!

Mmmmmmm!  Really old-fashioned, fudgy taste.  I used 4 squares of chocolate instead of 3 and didn't end up adding even 1/2 cup of milk.  I just measured the 1/2 cup, added it slowly, and stopped when the texture was perfect - no problems with it being too runny this way. It was smooth, silky, and stayed soft for the 2 days the cake lasted.  I did put a thicker layer on one part of my cake to see if it would become harder, like fudge, and it did get somewhat firm - would be excellent in a thick layer on brownies!

I have made this recipe as is and loved it.  But I was short ingredients last time and used 1 1/2 sq unsweetened choc.,
and 6 Tbl. milk.  I used everything else according to the original recipe.  It was just as great this way.

I tested this recipe against 3 other fudge icings, and it ended up being our least favorite. It had a great consistency and was easy to work with, but although I used good chocolate (Ghiradelli), its flavor was lacking.

Absolutely wonderful! I always add a little more milk if I'm frosting a layer cake since it is quite thick after it sets. Otherwise I have trouble spreading it.

I used this recipe to frost 2 dozen cupcakes.  It was Aamazing!  This is my new frosting recipe.  It made a lot of frosting so I could have cut it in half for the cupcakes.  I took the advice of others and only used 1/2 cup of milk and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it in fact the cupcakes didn't last very long today!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried it a few years ago for my son's birthday cake.  It turned out great, but I sort of forgot about it.  When his birthday came around this year I pulled out this recipe when he again asked for a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  I did a test run with the frosting tonight and it is amazing!  I doubled the recipe and did use less milk as the reviews suggested.  I also used half bakers unsweetened chocolate & half milk chocolate.  I know that this frosting will be a hit with my son.  Thanks for the recipe.

This icing is really good... but if I had to critique one thing, I'd like it to taste more chocolatey. But it is really good overall.  We paired it with Mom's Chocolate Cake and it was a winner for my daughter's 10th birthday.

Also, we ended up using less milk than the recipe called for.

I was actually disappointed.  I was looking for a recipe that was like the fudge icing that they put on cakes in restaurants.  The consistency is a little runny and needs less milk.  Also it didn’t have enough chocolate taste and is a very light chocolate color, not a rich fudge color.  I ended up adding and melting dark chocolate bars to this recipes (didn’t have any extra of the baker’s chocolate) and that helped.

The taste was good, but it was super hard to work with.  It was too runny at first (only used 1/2c milk but still too runny), then it hardened too quickly to spread once I started working with it.  But once I had the cake frosted, it tasted wonderful.

I have never written a review before but I had to about this recipe.  I've been looking for a chocolate frosting recipe that doesn't taste buttery, and this one doesn't.  It just tastes chocolately.  I did what other reviewers said, and only used 1/2 cup of milk total, and I pur it in the fridge for about ten minutes before spreading.  It was perfect.

I've made this frosting several times for "Chocolate Lovers' Favorite Cake" (see this site for recipe).  Everyone we have served it to loves it.  We always get requests for the recipe.

I embelish by adding the zest of an orange and 1 teaspoon of orange extract.  I've always found that 1/2 cup of milk achieves the consistency I'm after.  

I put the frosting in a large zip lock bag, snip one corner and drizzle the frosting on the cake.

Really easy!  A little too sweet, though.  I used only 1/2 cup milk, this worked well.  I also tried it whipped up as it cooled.  It was light as air, great texture!

I followed the suggestion of only using 1/2 cup of milk.  It did ended up a little runny to spread, but placing it in the frig fixed that problem.  I did end up using a tad more sugar to get the right consistancy.  My husband loves it...so I can't complain =)

This frosting has the perfect consistency.  I used this on yellow cake cupcakes.  I altered it just a bit- I only used 1/2 cup of milk (it def does not need any more than that)and i added a tablespoon or so of orange extract and grated some orange zest into the prepared batter.. It turned out yummy with a hint of orange!

Good base recipe.  Taking heed of what some of the other reviewers had said, I upped the chocolate by one ounce (using Ghirardelli bittersweet) and after I had mixed together the sugar and milk, I set aside about 1/2 cup.  Didn't need to add that extra back in.

This frosting is AWESOME!!! I used it to frost a double layer cake (using 2 9-inch pans) and it was more than enough. Like many others, a 1/2 c. of milk was all I needed... I should also mentioned that I used skim milk and the frosting still turned out great and firmed up nicely. In my opinion, it tasted just like store bought chocolate frosting. If you try this,  you will NOT be disappointed!!

Delicious, fudgy frosting!  I added some coffee to the milk for a yummy, mocha flavor and to cut the sweetness a little.  And I put the pan of frosting into a bowl of ice and beat it with an electric mixer.  It thickened up in no time.  In fact, I had to thin it a little more because I overdid it.

This recipe is easy to make yet has the "homemade taste."  I was skeptical at first when the chocolate did not blend well with the butter, but it all turned out delicious.  This is a very good cupcake frosting recipe!

I made this to go on top of peanut butter brownies. It was exactly what I needed! A little runny for a cake but it worked for brownies in a pan where the frosting couldn’t run away. It didn’t firm up a whole lot, but like I said, perfect for what I was doing. And delicious!

This recipe is the bomb!!  No need to try any other frosting recipe! When I frosted a birthday cake with this incredibly delicious chocolate frosting, I had a couple of friends ask for a second helping. I received several compliments and it’s now the only chocolate frosting recipe I’ll use from now on.

I followed the advice of others and used only 1/2 cup milk and the full bar of Bakers Chocolate.  Next time I would use only 3 cups of powdered sugar,  or even start with 2.5 cups and go from there.  It was easy to make, and no grittiness or anything.  It tasted fine too, but could use a little less sweetness.

I wanted a fudgy chocolate frosting to go on some yellow cupcakes I made instead of the chocolate buttercream recipe made with cocoa powder that was suggested with them and this was perfect. It was simple enough to make and came out nice and smooth with a perfect amount of sweetness. I'm not a big icing/frosting person generally so if I am a fan it's probably a pretty good recipe. I would like to try it again using the suggestion in the comments about adding another ounce of the chocolate for an even fudgier consistency, but this was perfect for cupcakes as is. I used a 1/2 cup of milk in the first addition as instructed and then only added about half of the additional 1/4 cup (so 1/8 c.) of milk in the second addition and got a nice thick, but smooth consistency after mixing and then putting in the fridge for an hour or so before piping onto the cupcakes.

Not bad ... would make for a quick frosting .   I have a better recipe but it's a little time consuming  but if you have the time it's well worth the effort.   I added an extra tablespoon of coco powder as others said it wasn't  chocolatey enough which I found was still a problem.  I also substituted heavy cream for the milk.   The texture was nice and smooth but  missing the rich flavour I was looking for .

Very good, but DO NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE. It was way too runny even after letting it cool. There is no way you are going to get it to mold or be firm. I would recommend ignoring almost all of the milk, which was an insane amount. I only did 1/2 c milk and then even added more powdered sugar to help it stiffen up. It was not enough. It got firm enough to frost, but then if your kitchen is warm at all it will melt down. I had to put it in the fridge.

I will try it again, but 5 star to it, if you can get a good texture.

So, this recipe includes too much milk and not enough chocolate to be a fudge frosting. If you are looking for a good chocolate buttercream, this is it. It is just absolutely not a chocolate fudge frosting. Since that’s how it’s described, I was disappointed.

Wow, sooo good! I had pretty much given up on chocolate frosting of any kind because they never come out good- always too bitter and sweet at the same time. The cocoa powder never works. But this stuff...the flavor is just perfect! And so easy to make too. There is a little too much milk in the recipe though, it came out more like a thick glaze even after cooling. I’d start with 1/4 cup milk and then add more as needed.

This is really rich and delicious! It looks running right after you mix everything but stiffens up to frosting texture nicely.

This was really easy to make, and tasted terrific. I used it to cover and fill a 2 tier,  9” round, dark chocolate cake. I could have used a bit more, as it only left a thin-ish layer (enough to just cover) around, but then, I tend to like frosting to be the main attraction on a cake.

I made this today for my chocolate cake, and it turned out perfect- in taste and texture. I made a three layer cake, so I doubled the recipe (I like plenty of frosting). I also used 8 oz of unsweetened chocolate, instead of 6 oz, because I like a really chocolatey, fudgy taste. My kids said it tastes like Cheesecake Factory frosting (on their Linda’s Fudge Cake), so that’s a bingo for me, as that’s the taste that I was aiming for! I highly recommend this recipe!

It wasn't chocolaty enough for me, so I added a tablespoon of cocoa. That made it a little less sweet, which I also like. Quick and easy and a good consistency.

This frosting was very chocolate-y, fudge-y and rich.  I was disappointed in how it smoothed out.  It was so thick so fast, it did not frost smoothly.  But it was very delicious.  I will try it again.

I used 2 oz of semisweet chocolate and 3 tbsp of dutch process dark chocolate cocoa powder. The flavor is great. The icing never really set to the right consistency, even after over an hour of standing in the fridge. It is possible mine had a bit more fat than the original due to the semisweet chips, but overall I think this calls for waaaay too much milk. Go with the other reviewer's suggestions and try 1/3 of a cup instead.

One word: excellent. My sister and I used this to top a chocolate cake for my baby shower and it was a hit!  I followed what other reviewers said, and halved the sugar which gave it a rich chocolate taste. Perfect consistency and delicious!

Very good frosting, easy to make. I followed some hints about adding a little more chocolate and using heavy cream instead of milk (1/2 cup to start).  Probably tastes great in it's original form but I wanted something thicker and fudgey.  Success...it tasted like brownie batter!

Based on other reviews, I used 4 oz of chocolate. I love a lot of chocolate, so I added 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder. I also added a tad more icing sugar to thicken it enough to pipe and let it sit in the fridge a few minutes before piping. It piped beautifully and tasted great!

As made according to the recipe  the frosting is simply too soupy . I am sure if I reduced the milk to 1/3 cup and added an ounce of chocolate , as a couple of reviewers have indicated the Bakers recipe calls for, it would probably be perfect. Sometimes the best kitchen tested recipes are on the boxes.

Great recipe! Fast and easy to make. I substituted cocoa powder for the unsweetened chocolate and did not need to add any milk beyond the 1/2 cup. It was the perfect chocolate fudge frosting and came out a beautiful consistency for spreading.

I love this recipe.  I used high quality chocolate (the large Lindt bars), doubled the recipe (to do a really thick coating on a 9" layer cake).  I used 2 and1/2 bars of the 70% cocoa bars and one cup of milk total.  It was perfect.  It set up enough to spread perfectly within minutes and was super simple to put together.  Simple, glossy, perfection.  My husband loved it.  I've always had trouble with chocolate icing recipes, this is my keeper.

Great frosting! Made it for a six layer cake so I doubled the recipie. Word of advice: Add the milk gradually to get it to the texture you desire and remember this frosting does harden as you work with it.

That is a lot of sugar!! Wouldn't even dare put that much in so it was definitely runny.  I blended it to thick it up, which worked. It was way to sweet! I used Hersheys chocolate so that is probably why. I'm scared to put it on the cake!

Quite delish!  Be careful to just add 1/2c. milk first - I got carries away and dumped the whole 3/4c. in right away, and had to add more sugar to thicken it up.  Oops!  Still turned out really yummy.

Believe calls for to much milk, next time 1/2 cup of milk. Also 50/50 shortening and butter.  Wish icing was stiffer.  Tasty, easy and use this recipe again.

Pretty darn good. I used Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate and it was delicious. Very rich. I had to increase the measurements to ensure I had enough to cover my cake though. I used two 9" rounds and like to put a good amount between my layers and around the sides.

Super good - made with Droste chocolate and evaporated milk, and organic powdered sugar.  Super! Don't add too much milk or like I did you'll have to add more chocolate and sugar. but it still came out great. It thickens as it cools and is shiny on top too.

Fantastic recipe. Not too think and not too sweet. I thought it was a goner because before I added the melted chocolate it looks like soup. But once I put the chocolate in and whipped it, it became the pefect texture and color. Just the right amount for a 9" layer.

Although this is a very tasty recipe, I would not make it to ice cupcakes. It is incredibly too thin. I followed previous poster's suggestions and made  it with 4 oz chocolate and only 1/2 cup Milk. I still had to add more sugar in the end to make it just barely thick enough for cupcakes.  Not a piping icing for sure. I can't imagine adding the entire 3/4 cup milk as the original recipe listed.

If you are looking for a fudgy filling for a cake, this is definitely the one.  I made a marble cake and wanted vanilla frosting on top but with chocolate filling.  This was perfect!  I did add the extra bit of chocolate as others have done, and because I didn't want it too runny, I didn't use all the milk it called for.  It was perfect!  Yum!

Terrific recipe. I'm not experienced making frosting, but all who tasted it loved it. Some reviews have described it as being runny, and mine was as well until I whipped it with my hand mixer on high for a couple of minutes. Thickened right up and spread very easily. Will absolutely make again. But need to ask, does it need to be refrigerated afterward? Does the cake need to be refrigerated? I can't find any clear answer to that.

This frosting was much too thin. The taste was good, but I didn't like the texture. I made this according to the recipe, but scaled it down by 1/3 for two dozen cupcakes. I'd opt for buttercream frosting over this recipe in the future.

I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty to frost a 9 X 13 cake.  Great chocolate frosting as it's easy to make, tastes wonderful, and requires no adjustments to the consistency.  This will be my go-to chocolate frosting.

Delicious!  I used a little less milk. As the butter hardens, the icing gets thicker. This is perfect and will use it as my only recipe.

It was runny, even after refrigerating a little, so it was basically a thick glaze. It wasn't very chocolatey, even though I used more chocolate than called for.

Way too runny!  I ended up adding 1/2 block cream cheese and about 2 more cups of powered sugar to thicken it, then of course had to add more chocolate and a bit of salt to cut the sweetness down.  Will not be making this again. Addendum.....had to refrigerate these...frosting would not firm up enough on cupcakes.

ok so I must have done something wrong.  I followed instructions to the letter, mixed my sugar, milk and vanilla and my mixture was like water.  Added my chocolate and it was so runny it would not even stick to the beater.  I had to add 4 extra cups of powder sugar and another oz of melted chocolate.  It came out great after my additions.  Not sure why it was so runny.

If you're looking for a chocolate fudge frosting, this is it!!! I added extra powdered sugar and a little less milk to get it to a thicker consistency for my liking but left everything else the same. It will thicken as it cools but I found that even after I gave it time to thicken it still wasn't the thick consistency my family likes but not a big deal to fix ;)  This has a wonderful taste and you won't be disappointed! Also, look for my pic I added with this frosting recipe to see the consistency I used and so that you can see for yourself how awesome it really is (my photos are #30 and #31).

After mixing the 1/2 C milk with the 1# confectioners I had my doubts, thought I read it wrong bc it was runny! Added the melted choc/butter (I used microwave method for melting), and continued to beat and it turned into fluffy chocolate perfection in no time flat. I will def use this recipe again. EASY and did not take 35 min like it says. I'd say 15-20 tops.

Easy to follow. I'm not a baker by any means, that's why I had to look for a recipe. But, I had to alter this one some. I only used 1/2 cup milk, I didn't add the rest of the 1/4 cup, and 12oz of semi-chocolate chips. I started out just as the recipe stated, but it wasn't fudgy enough for me. So,I had to add a little more butter and the rest of the 12oz of chips and some Hersey special dark 100% cacao powder while it was on the stove...about 2-3 table spoons maybe 4...I wanted a chocolate fudge taste...not just a chocolate taste. It thickened up good after I mixed it up for 10 minutes or so and waited several hours. I personally don't like the crunch of the sugar crystals, that's why I mixed it for such a long time. Again, I'm not a baker, I probably did something wrong. But it turned out really good...store bought...per my granddaughter. 
I used this recipe for a mayonnaise cake...which I also used the dark cacao instead of regular coco. They both turned out good. Everyone was surprised I made it. It went well together. Thanks.

This is probably the best chocolate frosting I have made (I've made a lot!)  Very close in consistency to the store-bought stuff, but much better taste and much healthier.  I did add in more powdered sugar, about a couple teaspoons of cocoa powder and a bit less milk than the recipe called for.  My picky and honest husband said is was great!  This is my new go-to frosting.

I made this frosting on a cake for my granddaughter's 10th birthday yesterday and it was the best ever.  I made a chocolate cake and used the German Chocolate cake recipe, except used 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate in place of the German Chocolate.  Everyone raved about the cake and the frosting.  I especially liked the frosting because it wasn't real sweet.  It was very easy to work with and not at all what I expected.  Even the little ones wanted to savor the cake because it was so good!  From now on, this is the only frosting I will be putting on cakes.

Wonderful recipe, but a the consistency was not quite thick enough for me. Next time I'll try reducing the milk a little.

I did not have the chocolate squares so made them out of cocoa and oil.  Only used 1/2 cup milk as per other suggestions, but this was still a runny type frosting.  I kept adding XXX sugar until it thickened some, but was still runnier than I would have like.  It is very, very sweet.  I had plenty to ice two loaf cakes that I cut in half and frosted the middles too.

I just made this recipe and it was inadequate. I followed what many of the reviews said about using less milk and it still had a viscosity very close to that of water and it was too sweet. I added a bit of corn starch and also used cocoa powder (instead of melted chocolate.) I plan on piping on top of it and that is not going to work very well. It now tastes fine, but that was after I improvised when I realized I needed more. I would not use this recipe again.

This recipe was not to my liking. It is too runny and bitter. 

I had to add sweet chocolate chips. (Luckily I had a bag  in the fridge.) I added more vanilla and confectioners' sugar. Not good enough yet. I got out my Hersey's Chocolate Syrup and squeezed a ton of it in there. You'd think it would be sweet enough by now, but no. It's better, but not great. I have had it in the refridgerator for 15 minutes now and it's just now starting to thicken up.

Tasted good, but it never set enough.  Just stayed really soft and runny.  I even omitted 1/4 c. Milk.  Maybe it's the humidity here in Memphis!  I put it in my piping bag and it just poured out the end.

i love this frosting! it's absolutely fantastic!
it's very simple to make, and mine thickened really quickly, and i didn't add any more milk than the 1/2 cup that i started w/.  it's a really dark, deep fudgy frosting and it spreads nicely too.  VERY VERY good, - definitely going in my recipe box!

This was the most amazing chocolate frosting ever!! I followed it exactly, needing only the 1/2 cup milk minimum. It was more than enough for a box mix of cupcakes, so I refrigerated the leftovers to use later (on this site's pumpkin brownies--yum!). I ate some cold after it had refrigerated a week and it tasted just like fudge--my kids and I were eating spoonfuls of it! haha

Great frosting!  Easy to spread or pipe onto cupcakes.  I tried it on a sour cream chocolate cake (which is not too sweet) and it was a perfect match.

It's a three out of five stars for the simple reason that the frosting is too runny .... I followed the recipe to the letter and instead of a rich darck brown frosting i ended up with a runny, tan icing. Dunno what I did wrong. Will give it another shot with my next cake though ... I 'd like to see if I can get that thick, dark frosting I imagined I would. Taste is good, although a bit sugary. If it turns out like this time I'll scrap it though.

This frosting was very easy, and has a fabulous rich, homemade chocolate flavor!  I will definately be adding this to my favorites list.  My only note is to trust the directions that it will thicken up as it cools.  When I first made it, it was very thin.  I didn't add the whole amount of milk, as I was afraid it would not thicken to "spreadable" consistency.  It did, and I had to even add a bit more milk.  Thanks for the great recipe...it turned out perfect!

This was abig hit with all my friends. It was easy t make. I changed it a little - I used double the choclate (I also used semi-sweet) and needed more sugar because it was a little runny. Other than that this was an amazing recipe!

Excellent frosting, but I think the ingredients are a bit off.  I followed the recipe to a tee up until the milk...  I can't remember if I added 1/4 or 1/2 of a cup at first, but either way, it was borderline too much!!!  So please start with much less milk (less than 1/4 and then slowly add it from there.  Had I added the full 3/4 cup, it would've been soup, not frosting!!  Yes, it thickens as it cools, but not that much.  You can always add more, but you cannot take it away!  My rule, anyway...  But the taste?  Holy cow... incredible!!  Had I added less milk, it would've been a great turn out for just a fudge dessert!  I keep licking my fingers and trying to find reasons to eat it.  Fabulous taste.  But it's not the texture that's fudgy, it's the taste!  Excellent.  But as mentioned, I just wished I would've added less milk to start out as I wanted it a bit firmer.  But overall, I will make this again for sure, but may add another block of unsweetened chocolate to the butter since it was really sweet and I tend to err on the side of the dark chocolate-type things.  :)

Great chocolate frosting - the best I've ever made. You really get a chocolate flavor from this recipe. However, I did alter it just a bit. Instead of baker's chocolate, I used 4 (not 3) oz of semisweet chips. And I added the vanilla to the chocolate/butter mixture as opposed to adding it to the powdered sugar. I would have to agree with other suggestions from users that stated 1/3 cup milk is enough.

So simple and SOO good! Used it on the "Black Chocolate Cake" recipe (as suggested from another reviewer). A put a generous layer of frosting on the cake and then dusted some confectioner's sugar on top. Looks like it took lots of hard work and time but both recipes were so easy!

This frosting is fantastic! I bake maybe 1x a year, but lately I've decided to do more. This was extremely easy to make, not very messy at all, and it was a big hit with everyone who had it. I used it as a filling for a double-decker chocolate fudge cake, with extra frosting along the outside, covered in chocolate chips, with a little bit of powdered suger sprinkled on top. Yummy!

It's a great recipe!!!  I added extra chocolate and reduced the milk to 1/2 cup, as suggested by others.  This set up immediately and was thick, fluffy, and creamy.    For those who found it runny or that it needed more confectioners sugar than called for...You must let the melted chocolate and butter mixture cool completely before adding to the confectioner's sugar.  Otherwise the heat of the butter/chocolate mixture will melt the sugar, thin it, and prevent it from setting up.

YUMMY!  I used this frosting to frost "Too Much Chocolate Cake" and won third prize in our company bake off.  My husband even loved the frosting & he doesn't really like chocolate.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Carrie.

Terrific! I used this to frost Michelle's Peanut butter marbled brownies and they were the hit of the party! I did reduce the milk to 1/2 cup and had to add more confectioner's sugar to thicken it up so next time I will reduce the milk even further. After I frosted the 13 by 9 pan of brownies I had quite a bit left over.

Excellent.  I used only half a cup of milk, as suggested, let it cool about an hour, and voila.  There also was plenty for the filling (in addition to the top and sides).

This frosting was really good! I used soy milk (a bit less than called for) and spread it over Peanut Butter Brownies (found the recipe on this site). They turned out delicious- will definitely save this recipe.

This was my first attempt at home made chocolate frosting and it was AWESOME!!! I made no changes, but I was worried about the amount of powdered sugar...we buy it in 7lb bags, so I had to guess how much 1lb was..I must have guessed right because it turned out wonderful! I used it to frost some chocolate cake in ice cream cone cupcakes...just something fun for the kids while on spring break :-) Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is now my favorite frosting recipe! Had plenty of frosting for two 9 inch cake rounds. Probably shouldn't tell anyone this, but ate the leftover frosting (had the consistency of fudge) for the next several days:)

Excellent Frosting! I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for coco as I don't like the taste. Instead of unsweetened cubes I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and my family loved it.

I melted the butter and dark chocolate morsels in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time.  Took it out and stirred. Then placed it in the microwave for another 30 seconds.  All the morsels weren't completly melted but stirring a few moments will melt them.  This recipe went well with Dark Chocolate Cake II from this site.

This is the best!  Super easy and it tastes delicious! I added 1 more square of chocolate and started with 1/2c milk, then dribbled a littlemorein during mixing until I had the consistency that I wanted...spread beautifully and and tastes wonderfully!  Will be using again and again!!

I did it wrong and it was still good!!! I was in a rush and DIDN'T melt butter w the choco. When I was finished, I put it in the fridge. Half hour later I thought "hey, wasn't there supposed to be butter in this?!!". Oops! So out comes hand mixer and I whipped in the butter. Very nice. Was more fluid than than other frostings which made it look smooth on cake top. I agree could use more choco, but its nice the way it is - not too sweet, not too choco.

This was great! I am living in Spain, and had to find a recipe that would be easy to make/had ingredients that you can find here. The frosting really "made" my cake, and I almost didn't have enough to frost with, because I tried it, and kept eating it before I put it on the cake!

This was very easy to make and sooooo yummy!  In fact my 4 year old daughter is licking the leftovers out of the bowl as I sit here.  I made it as directed except I only used 1/4 cup of milk.  Perfect spreading consistency.

Personal opinion, but this is the absolute BEST chocolate frosting I have *ever* eaten.  They were right that it's dangerous, though.  You can't stop tasting it!

This frosting sets very well for later 'smoothing' of the cake if you plan on decorating.  However, (and I can't believe I'm saying this) I have to agree with others and say this frosting was a little too sweet.  Next time I make it I will only put in 3/4 of the sugar and then as more as needed after tasting.  It's REALLY sweet (and that's from somone who never says that when it comes to chocolate).

Wonderful! This is what saved my cake. The cake it's self was okay, I used the One bowl chocolate cake on this site. My mother in law (who is famous for her "homemade cakes) said Excellent!

I had never made my own frosting before and this one is a keeper! I used a double boiler to melt the chocolate; and felt the 1/4 cup milk wasn't needed (the consistency was perfect without it) Don't be disappointed if it tastes "bittersweet" at first; after it sets .....its fudgy and delicious!! I got rave reviews and will make again!

Beautiful glossy frosting with a delicious rich taste!  My only complaint is the amount of milk called for is WAY too much!  I read some other reviews and used the suggested 1/2 cup of milk, but the frosting still slid quite a bit until my cake was good and cold in the fridge.  I think I'll start with 1/3 cup next time and go from there.  Still and awesome frosting!  I will make this again!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I can't get this frosting to set.  It is now in my refrigerator oozing all over the plate it is on, a larger plate and a sheet of foil.  I think there was way too much milk.  I even added extra butter and sugar and it still wouldn't set.  Great flavor if you don't eating it with a spoon.

I didn't read the reviews before I made the recipe, but I lucked out anyway! I only used 1/2 cup of milk and the consistency was great for spreading after just a few minutes in the fridge. I had a hard time to keep my husband fromeating the frosting right our of the bowl! Yummy! It makes a lot of frosting. I wonder if it can be frozen and used later?

Excellent recipe as long as you follow the advice of the other reviewers and use no more than 1/2 cup of milk.  Additionally, I added 1/8 tsp. of peppermint extract and used the frosting for the outside of a chocolate cake with Andes mints melted between the layers (see the Chocolate Mint Mayonnaise cake on this site).  Delicious!

I used this frosting to layer my Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake. It was my first time making my own frosting and I could not believe how easy it was. With this recipe, now there is no need to buy chocolate frosting! Like some other reviewers, I used slightly less than 1/2 cup of milk. I doubled the amount of chocolate used to darken the fudge and make it more chocolaty! The consistency was great and spreading was a breeze. Very yummy too!

3 stars because this is not so good.  This is too sweet for my taste.  Although, if used sparingly was okay.  Still searching for a good chocoate frosting...

This frosting turned out great.  I, too, only needed 1/2 cup of milk.  It was perfect spreading consistancy after standing for less than 10 minutes.  So easy!!

Wonderful recipe, and so easy.  I gave only 4 starts because it was pretty thin, even after refrigerating, so next time I will start with half the amount of milk.  I'll be using this from now on.
