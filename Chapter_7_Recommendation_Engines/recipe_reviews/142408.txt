Fantastic! I made a few twists because I didnt have orzo on hand, white balsamic or fresh basil so I used Orchette, regular balsamic and some dried basil.  This was a HIT with my guests for dinner, super easy to prepare, gorgeous presentation and doesnt matter what temperature its served at, so its ideal for a get together.  I did not cut up the shrimp or even go through the process of shelling and flavoring the pasta with the shrimp.  I did, however, cook the asparagus in the same water as the pasta.  For the commenter below who said their asparagus turned brown, they need to remove it from the water when its cooked and immediately put it into cold water to stop the cooking process, it wont brown if it gets shocked immediately.   For depth I added some sliced grape tomatoes and some sliced black olives, and now that I've tried it both warm and cold... the flavors really come out after its been chilled overnight! When I do it again I might consider adding some small cubes of cheese, but depends what I have on hand.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

Fantastic dish!  I used whole 90-110 count shrimp, rather than cutting up the larger, more expensive extra large size.  The dressing is light, yet flavorful.  It received rave reviews at our Father's Day cookout.  I'll definitely be making this again.

What a great recipe!  I actually tripled it for a family reunion and people just raved about it.  I forgot to save the shrimp shells so I just added some Old Bay to the water that I cooked the orzo in.  Seemed to work just fine.  This is a keeper...will make it again!  Tastes excellent leftover too!

This was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe as closely as I could w/what I had available:  I did not have white balsamic vinegar (nor did my grocery store) and I used dried basil.  As it is very hot here now, we opted for cold service.  it was dry and surprisingly mild in flavor...I really didn't get much from the honey mustard or vinegar.  It was a nice change of pace, but not a dish I think I'll repeat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but not great.  I made the mistake of preparing this a day ahead.  The asparagus was so pretty, but hours later the dressing caused it to marinate and brown.  I will make again, but not too far in advance.

This is one of my staple recipes I use when having company over. It's very quick to make, and such a nice side dish to any bbq for a summer get together. I follow the recipe pretty closely, the only change I make is I don't boil the shrimp shells in the pasta water. It's one moe step that I don't really feel is needed. Simplicity is key for me :) I also use the basil that's already minced in the tube. I know fresh basil is better- but it still tastes awesome :) I get compliments on this dish all the time!!

This dish was fantastic! It did not take long to make and was scrumptious! I did not have white balsamic vinegar, so I used traditional red balsamic instead.  I also added diced tomatoes as someone else suggested. I've never had Orzo before and it was awesome.  We will be making this again & maybe adding diced cucumber to it as well.  Five stars for sure!

Followed the recipe except that I did not use the shrimp shells and I subbed apple cider vinegar for the white balsamic because that's what I had on hand. This was a cool, refreshing salad for a hot day. I made it the night before which allowed everything to come together. I still felt it was missing a little something- I might up the basil next time, but I love fresh basil. Also, I bet cherry tomatoes would be great in this too. Thanks for sharing!

Super easy and tasty. Enjoyed this light dinner last night....since I had no honey mustard...I used some dijon and honey.  Fresh lemon juice and basil is a must. Served with a simple heart of palm salad dressed with olive oil, cider vinegar, dijon mustard and fresh pepper.  Serving the leftovers chilled tonight. Thanks!   (note: I drain and rinse my orzo because I think it is way too starchy after cooking....and I use Barilla brand)

This is great, especially with fresh shrimp. I had 2 pounds of shrimp, so I boiled some for later then cooked the pasta in that water. Much easier than using shrimp peels. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious - I prepared the recipe as stated and then did it as another reviewer suggested - stir fried the chopped up  asparagus with the garlic and shrimp at the same time - which is the way I now prefer it. I have made it 3 times this past week and given the recipe to 2 others.  I'm buying some more asparagus tomorrow so I can make it again.  A great way to use fresh asparagus for my husband who totally dislikes the vegetable but likes this salad.  Not that I want to waste it on him if he doesn't like it but I also don't want to have to prepare two separate meals;-)
Used regular Balsamic vinegar as I had no white. Orzo isn't a very white pasta anyway, so the appearance didn't change appreciably.  DE LISH US!

Yum!  My mom made this tonight and it was great.  She used pre-cooked shrimp and substituted arborio rice because she was out of orzo and it was great.  And definitely serve chilled!  We tried it both ways.

This is a great reciepe for warm weather get togethers.  Very light and fresh tasting. The only thing I changed was I sautaed the asparagus pieces with the  shrimp and garlic in olive oil, to give it some flavor, and added some grape tomatoes. Thank you so much for our new favorite summer side dish. I know I'll be making this and sharing this all summer.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe as published and found it to be rather bland, but with possibilities.  So the next time I made it I added chopped red pepper, sliced black olives and cherry tomatoes.  I used cooked shrimp, so instead of boiling the shrimp shells, I added Old Bay and a dab of anchovy paste to the pasta water for added flavor.  And finally instead of using the dressing suggested I combined a little light mayo with light champagne dressing for a rich and creamy dressing.  Yes, I know, I completely changed the recipe, but that's the beauty of using recipes from Allrecipes, it brings out the creative cook in me!

Really great and light! I think it needed more dressing because I prepared it early so I doubled the dressing and added some more right before we ate.

Great recipe!! I used whole wheat orzo, doubled the lemon juice, and regular balsamic vinegar cuz I didn't have white.  I overcooked the orzo a little but it still turned out really well!  The asparagus cooks quickly once you add it to heat.   Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy and very tasty!  I made this and didn't let it chill for the 2hours, we just ate it warm and it was excellent.  My husband is planning on having the left overs for lunch today as a chilled salad!

This was far to bland for me.  I was hoping for a recipe similar to an orzo and shrimp salad a work friend makes that is exceptional. I doctored this one up with dill, 2 TBS of prepared pesto, and extra fresh lemon juice.  I took it to a barbecue and everyone loved it (It was better, but I still felt it needed "something").

I have forgotten to review this recipe!! I came across this recipe about 4 years ago, I fell in love with it as soon as I tasted it.  I have now made it at least 70 times since.  I came in to look at it because I couldn't remember if it called for green onions or not and realized I had never reviewed.  Thank you for this!  It's great in the summer as a side dish or as a main dish when it's too hot to cook.  It has impressed everyone I've made it for.  Making it today and can't wait to eat!!

Made for first time on July 4, 2014.  It looked beautiful and was delicious. Everyone, including my husband who does not eat shrimp, liked it! I cooked the asparagus separately, after peeling them (as recommended by Julia Child). Did not have white balsamic, so used regular balsamic, and used less that 1 TB. Just made it last night and my husband exclaimed that it’s very tasty and he likes it. It’s a keeper! Next time will double the sauce, which is what makes the dish. The lemon, the mustard honey (which had not tried until now) and the basil make a great combination. Will make dish for book club friends with brown rice or quinoa in lieu of orzo.

I know- I know- Everyone hates to have reviews on recipes that have been changed! However, if my changes will guide someone else, here goes! Instead of making this a pasta salad, I treated this like a stir fry. I made no changes to the ingredients, except to sub leftover brown rice for the orzo and increasing the basil and sauce to our taste. No orzo in the house that day.  I stir fried the shrimp, garlic, onions and asparagus. When cooked through, I added the lemon/vinegar/mustard sauce (I increased the sauce slightly). Served with the rice. From start to finish it all took about 15 minutes and got rave reviews all around. Next time I will try the recipe as written. It must be wonderful.

I made it just as the recipe reads.  I did use a very large clove of garlic and I would do it again or even maybe another clove, but we are all fans of garlic! I will make this again.  I was looking for a dish to bring to a family that is healthy and not the heavy casseroles most people get.  I will use it this way for sure!  I highly recommend this dish!

Good, but I agree with other reviewers that the balance of ingredients is a bit off.  Unless you need a HUGE salad, I recommend cutting the amount of orzo pasta in half and leaving the amount of asparagus and dressing 'as is'.  I added more shrimp, and (using another reviewer's suggestion) added a generous 1/8 tsp. Cajun seasoning and large pinch of red pepper flakes to the shrimp.  The second time I made it, I used cooked shrimp and added the cut asparagus to the shrimp mixture; after sauteing in a covered skillet for 4 minutes, the asparagus was nicely cooked and I didn't lose the nutrients in the pasta water.  I also used the resulting flavored olive oil from the shrimp/asparagus and cut back on the oil in the dressing.  I also added halved grape tomatoes, which added color and a punch of flavor.  This salad holds well, even when made a couple of days in advance.

This dish is superb and I never fail to get compliments on it! Perfect as is. This makes a great main dish pasta salad for a summer evening or a really nice pot luck dish if you need a pasta salad. I have had excellent results skipping the step where you cook the shrimp shells so that I can use pre shelled shrimp for faster prep work.

I made it exactly according to the recipe and thought it was a little bland.  I will make it again and I will probably double the dressing and add more shrimp. I served it with strawberries, crusty bread, and glass of Semillon wine.   It's a nice light salad that would be good outside on the patio!

I don't boil the shells for the water. Too much bother. You can use regular balsamic but i would recommend using a little less. Defiantly blanch the asparagus for the salad. cooks it without losing the crunch.

Doubling the sauce mix really added more flavor! I used half honey mustard and half dijon. I cut down the  olive oil by a half. My husband loves asparagus, so it was fun to find something so delicious and different to incorporate asparagus with pasta

I'm looking forward to trying this recipe.  I will tweak for circumstances as most do.  Just wanted to share a tip on asparagus;  After trimming the woody butt ends, I blanch the asparagus for one minute in boiling water, then hit it with an ice water bath immediately.  This preserves the nice green color, and keeps it from getting too soft and mushy too soon.  Of course the more time spent in an acidic "dressing" (vinegar/citrus)based, the more the plant tissue will break down, so go for portion control and only cook what you're pretty sure is going to go away same day!

I followed the directions exactly and found the flavor to fall flat.  With the list of ingredients I don';t see how that could happen, but it did!
Not likely to try this again.

I served this warm and it was very tasty! I left out the green onion and used 1 teaspoon of dried basil instead of fresh.  My husband and I really enjoyed it, but we agree it could use less vinegar next time.

Fine. Nothing special. Pretty  bland. I had to add shalots, Parmesan cheese, sesame seeds, chopped spinach. Still just bland. The recipe essentially needs Cajun seasoning or some such strong flavoring to keep the orzo from just washing it out.

Very good!  The only change I made was to saute the asparagus with the shrimp.  And I only had dried basil, no fresh.  Because I didn't allow enough time to completely chill, I served it  slightly chilled.  We enjoyed this and plan to make it again someday.

I used tiiny pasta shells instead of orozo, to give the salad more substance.
For the future I would add chopped celery or chopped red onion. It needs some crunch.
Use the drippings from cooking  the shrimp and garlic, instead of the plain lil, in the end.
The  salad was a hit  with 8 ladies!

I first made this several months ago, and like many other reviewers, we felt it was a bit bland. I made it again today and increased the flavor profile by doing the following: I added twice as much garlic, a pinch of chile flakes and a bit of cajun seasoning to the shrimp. I added an extra teaspoon of honey to the dressing. To balance the sweet with something salty, I added some sliced briny black olives and some  small cubes of panela cheese - panela is a Mexican cheese that is sort of a cross between fresh mozzarella and feta.  This made a delicious salad. The recipe as-is surely rates at least three stars, but if you agree that it needs a bit more pzazz,  try making a few minor changes.

It's really good, but my husband decided he likes it better as a hot dish. I throw the green onions and basil in with the shrimp and garlic to cook. Then I add the pasta and asparagus to the skillet with the dressing and heat it all up.  I like it this way, too, but I'll usually eat the leftovers cold for lunch the next day.

The salad was light but needed more flavor.  I added red pepper flakes to the olive oil when cooking the shrimp.  Next time I'll add some pesto to the dressing and add Old Bay to the orzo as it boils.  The shrimp shells just didn't add enough flavor.
