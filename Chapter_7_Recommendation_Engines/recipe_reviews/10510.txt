The name on these is slightly deceptive. They aren't actually caramel. What you have is a rich, brown sugar cookie with a browned butter frosting. I think the name is old fashioned; before browned butter became "cool" they just chose a name that reflected the flavor rather than the texture (again, there is no caramel texture here). I would definitely call these "Browned Butter sandwich cookies" now... cooler and more accurate!  All that said, these are delicious. I make the cookies much larger (more like a walnut than a marble) and flatten them to more like 1/4 inch. Then I double the frosting! They come out chewy that way. Rich, but awesome!

These were fun to make and delicious!  Unlike other sandwich cookies I have made, these held up well and were great to pack in lunches!

This was one of my favorite cookies growing up.  It actually is from a Pillsbury Bake off paperback cookbook that my mom had (that I now have) from back in the 50's.  There were so many good recipes in that book that we grew up on...this was my favorite in the cookie department!

My 80 year old mother has made these cookies for as long as I can remember.  Haven't met anyone who doesn't love them!  They are requested often by her kids who come to visit from out of town (grandkids too!)

I did a 1½ size batch (1½ cups margarine, around 1-1/4 cups brown sugar, 1 egg yolk and half the egg white, 3-1/4 cups flour). I chilled the dough for about 20 minutes, then made the cookies... I got a total of 116 cookies (58 sandwiches) out of the batch. Instead of using my palm and a fork, I dipped the bottom of a smallish glass in sugar and pressed the cookies down so they all ended up close to the same size. Instead of the caramel cream, I used a peanut butter cream filling (½ cup PB, 1½ cups or so of icing sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, and 4 or 5 TBS of milk). Very fabulous, and next time I'll try the caramel cream! Thanks for sharing, Robin!

I was expecting a caramel-rich gooiness somewhere, but was disappoointed. I found melting some caramels and spooning it over the cookies more satisfying.

Good flavor. I didn't make sandwich style cookies, it would have been too much cookie. I frosted them and they were very good.

I personally didn't like these very much so I sent my husband to  take them to the after school program at school where everyone loved them. I 'll give them the recipe so they can make them.

This cookie is amazing!  The only thing I would change next time is to leave out the extra 1/4 cup of flour and I did add a bit of salt to the dough.  I thought marblel sized balls would be too small, but they make for a perfect bite sized delight!  for the filling I had leftover caramel I made for another recipe so I just used that mixed with icing sugar. I will definitely be making this cookie a new holiday tradition in our house!

Even after chilling overnight, my cookies spread quite a bit. As other reviewers have stated, these are very light on any caramel taste and really are a plain butter cookie with plain vanilla frosting. I jazzed my second batch up with a little turbinado sugar on top, and a thin layer of peanut butter with the icing. That made it a bit better.

Divine! The only thing I did different was to make them larger and add a pinch of kosher salt to the filling. I also doubled the filling, it wasn't enough for my taste. I am already making a second batch!

The cookie part is 5 stars for sure! Love the flavor and texture. The filling is a bit sweet for us, so I have to make some adjustments to that the next time I make these. Thanks for a yummy recipe.
