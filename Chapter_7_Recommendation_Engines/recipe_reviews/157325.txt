While I think that it was tasty, in my opinion, it's just not a dessert. It's a candied sweet potato. To say that it's the "Most Delish Quick Dessert In the World" is REALLY overrating it. It needs something. Maybe a little cream to lighten it up? My potato was probably on the larger side, but it's definitely more than one serving.

This is very flavorful if you like yams! Also yummy is to serve it drizzled with fresh orange juice. Enjoy!

Hmm, this sure doesn't taste like dessert.  Maybe if you add some brown sugar and butter it would.  It did make our sweet potatoes a little different than our usual, but we just ate it as a side dish.

I think that it was okay, but I definitely needs more UMPH. more cinnamon, maybe brown sugar. while it was delicious, I think I should have more flavor and sweetness, to call it dessert. I give it a 6.
