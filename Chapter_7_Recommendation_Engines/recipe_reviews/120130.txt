Made this as stated for the recipe group, wishing I should have added LESS garlic and MORE liquid (cream, milk, ANYTHING that would make it less sticky/thick).  I love garlic, but this was WAY too much garlic! I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and my garlic cloves were huge so only used a half a one and it was still over powering. I did leave the pesto to come to room temp before topping the pasta, but it was a goopy consistency and the pasta all stuck to itself.... oh well, live and learn, it looked pretty  on the plate and it's a good thing hubs won't be home for 2 days, the garlic that will be emanating from me will put him off for sure! LOL! Good premise of a recipe, needs tweaking though...**EDIT~ used LESS garlic and MORE cream cheese = MUCH BETTER! originally I gave it 3 stars but I bumped it up one with those modifications, if it would have stated this in the beginning, along with some more liquid (i.e. cream or half/half) then it would be a 5 star...really good with those changes though...

I made this recipe pretty close to as written and it was really good. I did use low fat cream cheese and one tablespoon less oil. The flavor was great but a little too mild so I would probably add sun dried tomatoes next time. This sauce was also extremely thick and I think a little milk would make it easier to mix into the pasta.

I made this for the recipe group.  I used rotini pasta because it is what I had on hand.  I thought I would follow the advice of other reviews and melt the cream cheese with milk before adding to the rest of the sauce.  It has a very fresh and light taste.  I think it would be really good with roasted peppers instead of the tomatoes.  Thank you for the recipe!

Recipe Group selection of 2/13.  This was a huge hit with my group.  I was very surprised because I thought I don't care for pesto.  I'm not sure if it was mixing it with the cream cheese or omitting the pine nuts, but I loved this.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, so I tossed the cookedpasta with a bit of warm EVOO before assembling the dish.  I also had no fresh tomatoes so I used about 1 cup of drained petite diced tomatoes.  This recipe is a great find and we will have it again.

Made for Recipe Group. Easy, fast, and delish! Some roasted red peppers with the tomatoes would have been a nice touch with this. The cream sauce could have been a little creamier, maybe some milk or a little more cream cheese. Light and refreshing. Thanks Irene!

We tried this for the recipe group. The sauce had good flavor but the temp and consistency presented problems for me. I served the sauce on top as stated which resulted in sticky pasta and a cold meal even though I let the sauce come to room temp and served in heated bowls. I thought the heat from the pasta would help the sauce melt and spread but it didn't. I think I would thin a little and mix it through the pasta in the hot pot (or maybe warm it a bit) if I make it again. It was easy to make but I would definitely change the prep to prevent cold, sticky pasta with a dollop of sauce on top.

Recipe Group Recipe********We enjoyed this recipe. But there were some problems I had with it. The pesto is really really thick so I added a little bit of half and half to thin it down. I couldn't bring myself to add the cold pesto on top of the pasta so I warmed it up in a pan and added a little of the pasta water to thin it out a bit then tossed it with the pasta. I think that it was a bit heavy for angel hair so if I make it again I will use a bigger pasta. And I would add a little salt when mixing the pesto together, it was a bit bland if you got some without cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group and...We LOVED this pasta! I am a HUGE fan of creamy pasta sauces and basil/pesto, so I knew this would be great. I used mini penne because hubby doesn't care for angel hair and I figured it would be easier for the little guy to eat. After seeing the other reviews, I opted to heat the cream cheese with some milk, until smooth, and since I was using prepared pesto, after the cheese was melted, I stirred in the pesto to taste, and added a little extra milk until it was the consistancy that I was looking for. I topped it with the tomatoes and cheese, and it was a real winner tonight! My tomatoes were a little under ripe, but I can't wait to make this in the summer when everything is ripe and fresh~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for Recipe Group this week. It was a tasty, quick dinner...will definitely go on our weeknight rotation. I served with "Aunt Mary's Eggplant Balls" from this site. I love how fresh it is. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and eyeballed the olive oil- I probably only used 4 T though. Thanks for sharing!
