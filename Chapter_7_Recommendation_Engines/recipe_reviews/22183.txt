I think this recipe is wonderful. I am a professional pastry chef and I have had a hard time finding a waffle that is versitle and can be tweeked to do what I want it to without someone screwing it up at the restaurant. I can add anything to this recipe and it still comes out wonderful. The best seller is when we add apple pie filling about 1/2 cup and 1 tbs. of cinnamon. Top with some more warm pie filling and homemade maple syrup! A++++

This is EXACTLY the recipe I was looking for when I bought my new waffle maker!!! Better than the restaurant I used to beg my hubby to take me to just so I could get a belgian waffle.  I added 2tsp of vanilla, 2-3 TBS. of sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon and used 3/4 c milk and 3/4 c buttermilk. YUMMMMM.  Perfect each time!! Family loves them too, but I'm the waffle freak!

The only recipe better than this is my Grandma's and that calls for butter and buttermilk which I didn't have on hand today, which is why I tried this.  Very simple ingredients that produce a yummy waffle.  I did add about 2-3 T sugar and about 2-3 t vanilla to sweeten it up a bit.  I also added about 1 -1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries.  My daughter and her friend loved them.  This recipe does make more than 4 servings in my opinion.  I got about 7 6 in round waffles out of it and they are very filling.

FINALLY!!!  A waffle recipe worth hanging onto.  These were wonderful.  I made as directed, except used others recommendations and added 2 Tbsp. of sugar (don't like mine too sweet, especially since I'm using pure maple syrup on top), 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 2 tsp. vanilla.  In place of the milk, I used 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 regular milk.  They cooked up nice and light, not thick and chewy like the waffles I usually make.  I was able to get approximately 7 - 7" waffles, plenty to freeze the extras.  Thanks for a great recipe, Karen!  (BTW, be sure to give your waffle maker a quick spray of oil before pouring each waffle).

I liked that this recipe omitted sugar. I'm one who usually omits sugar from waffles if I can get away with it. I followed the recipe exact. This recipe turned out a nice waffle, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I'd make this again but I would up the salt a little and add a touch of vanilla.

I am pregnant and was craving chocolate chip waffles like you wouldn't believe. I have always been afraid to try my own waffle batter but I was out of my mix. I made with apple sauce instead of oil to make it healthier and it was still wonderful! Thanks a lot.

After a recent disaster with a commercial pancake mix making waffles, I was determined to find a recipe that used beaten egg whites which was an ingredient I remembered from my childhood. This recipe was easy, both in preparation and ingredients.  The waffles turned out great.  Light & crisp.  Worth the little extra effort to whip the egg whites.

These waffles looked very presentable, but were SUPER BLAND! They had an airy texture from the whipped egg whites, which was a good idea, but there was still no flavor to it.  I seen other suggestions on here to add sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon.  I wish I would have.  I made them for a large group and no one seemed to think they were anything but filling. We added two kinds of syrup, but it didn't really improved the DRY and BLAND taste. I am going to continue to look for a sweet cream type waffle recipe that tastes sweet and good alone with or without a ton of toppings.

Love the crisp texture of these waffles! However, the batter isn't quite sweet enough on its own. I'd suggest adding a tablespoon or two of sugar and a tsp of vanilla to the batter.

this batter did not produce fluffy waffles, and was VERY bland, even after adding sugar and vanilla.

This was the type of waffle recipe I was looking for, with egg whites beaten separately. I made it in a Belgian waffle maker. Does not need sugar added! The only thing I changed was to use 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. I did need to add about 1/4 cup more milk, maybe it was too thick because of the substituted whole wheat flour. Next time I might try adding a little flax seed, too. I did not need to spray my non-stick waffle maker- they popped out beautifully. Most non-stick doesn't need to be sprayed, the spray will just turn into a gummy film eventually. Thanks for the recipe! Update 2/14/15: I made these for overnight guests today and added a little flax seed. They were a big hit!

My husband and I were not crazy about these. They were very dry and brick-like. Perhaps it was something I did? Followed the recipe to a "T". I had my waffle maker on 3 so they weren't too dark. I think that I will stick with Emeril's recipe. They were very light, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Don't like this recipe.
Too thick and heavy (not fluffy) - not enough milk maybe.
Lacks taste.

Easy, with great results every time. I was looking for a waffle recipe for my Belgian waffle iron, to make rectangular waffles that will fit in the toaster (and thus can be frozen and taken up as needed for quick before-school breakfasts for kids.) I double the recipe and get about 18 waffles. I have even whipped up a batch of these on a school mornings, that is how quick and easy this recipe is! Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time ever I made waffles. I went for this recipe because it looked very simple. My SO was concerned about the amount of oil so went with a little less, about 4tbs, and all they were great.

These turned out very good. They were a bit on the bland side, but I didn't mind at all. The flavour will come from the syrup or topping that you add. I made only half the batch and got 8 rectangular waffles (but I didn't fill the mold all the way). We had one each and I froze the rest by laying them on flat on a tray. I left them in the freezer for a couple of hours and then I packed them into freezer bags. Whenever I want one for breakfast, I just pop them into the toaster and then top with butter/margerine and jam. They taste better toasted! I will definitely make these again. The batter was quick to put together and the waffles baked up nice and crispy on the outside and airy on the inside. Thanks for sharing, RAZZ_BRRY_JAM!

I normally make homemade waffles with yeast and they are wonderful.  I was looking for a recipe that would not take so long to make as the recipe with yeast has to be stirred every 15 min for an hour before using.  I thought there was too much of an egg taste in these.  I probably will not make again.

I loved these waffles! The secret is beating the egg whites. They turned out very crispy in my waffle maker. Very easy to make.

These were pretty good waffles.  I made some changes per other reviewers.  I added 1 cup of regular milk and ½ cup of buttermilk.  I also added some vanilla and about a tablespoon or so of white sugar.  They came out fluffy with a really great flavor and are a keeper for me although they need a little extra love.  Defiantly give them a try.

These are phenomenal! best recipe I've tried, and I've tried A LOT! All 6 of my kids ate these up, so I invited friends with their 3 kids over for breakfast and they agreed: Best Waffles Ever!! I have a huge family so i have make 12 servings (or more)which is 1cup & 2TBSP veggie oil, which is too oily for me, so i used about 3/4c oil and 1/4c + 2tbsp vegan margarine. Superb! Maybe a smaller batch is ok with just the oil, but i like the buttery flavor this adds so i recommend a bit of butter or margarine in the mix.

These waffles freeze well-I cooked up a triple recipe and froze in daily-size packaged for my kids during the school week. Next time I will have try a quadruple batch, my boys can't get enough of these!

Great recipe!  I tweaked it a bit (added sugar, vanilla, and allspice and left out the salt). The whole family enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing!!

Perfect, delicious, quick, and easy waffle recipe!! I added a little sugar and vanilla as well,  cinnamon would be a nice addition as well! Don't skip the beating of the egg whites, it is what helps to make the waffles light and fluffy. Thanks for sharing!

This is a GREAT basic recipe!  I found it for my husband to make waffles in his new waffle iron he received as a gift.  They came out perfect, and he is a very inexperienced cook.

This is the very best waffle recipe I've ever tasted!. I was not a waffle lover until I used this recipe! Very easy to make and it just floats on your tongue! Chiffon is truly the best name for this waffle recipe! My prior recipes were thick, pasty, doughy. I felt like a really good cook after I tried this recipe! I rate it a 5 plus! thanks.

This is an excellent recipe.  It tastes like cake!  I also followed everyone's suggestion to add 3 tbsp. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Beating the whites separately only takes a minute or two, but it's worth it.

Followed the recipe exactly to give true rating. I thought they were very good but maybe a little thick. I did like how much batter the recipe made and will definitely use this again, next time I will play with other ingredients in the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved these waffles. So light and fluffy. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup of sugar to make them a little sweet for my family cause they just eat them with fruit. Very good.

these did not turn out very good, there seemed to be way too much oil, and they were quite dense and on the tougher side, and not fluffy as I had hoped. Followed the recipe to the T, so not sure what happened.

The batter came out waaay too runny.  I had to add another half cup of flour to get the right consistency.  And there just isn't any flavor.  I added sugar and cinnamon to make it taste like something other than egg.  I won't be using this recipe again, sorry.

This is an excellent basic recipe. I can't wait to try other suggestions with add ons. I used fesh strawberry jam and syrup. Fresh whipped cream would be great on this! Also, I forgot to sift and forgot to add the oil and they still came out great. Next time I will try with cocout oil instead of vegetable oil. The texture is great. Delicious!

It definitely needs more sugar.  It's a wonderfully fluffy and soft waffle.  This was my first attempt at making waffles.  I thought it would be fussy and difficult but it was a breeze.  Don't skip the whipped egg whites as they are worth the extra work and make for wonderfully fluffy waffles.

The texture was great, but the flavor was pretty bland, even after I added a little sugar and vanilla to the batter.  I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

My husband and I LOVED these!  I always steered away from having to beat the egg whites, but it's so worth it!  I've added other ingredients to this recipe, but it's great "as is" too.  I will never buy boxed mix again!

I have made these several times, but today I didn't have any milk.  I substituted vanilla soy and they turned out great.  You can taste the hint of vanilla which give them a little different flavor.  My husband couldn't even tell the difference.  So, if you have run out of milk or you are lactose intolerant you can substitute soy and it works great.

My girlfriend enjoyed these a lot. We ate ours with strawberry jam and vanilla icecream. I did replace some of the oil and milk with natural yoghurt and they still tasted great!

Perfect! Although I don't bother to separate the eggs and they are still yummy - and even easier!

The best waffle recipe I've ever had!!  We've had these twice, and followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Today, we made the following changes and they were even better!: 1 less tsp. baking powder (taste was too strong with the full amount), and ADDED 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. sugar to the mixture at the end (before the egg whites are brought in).  We cook them in our rotating waffle maker (Bella Cucina, got it at Macy's) because it makes THE lightest, crispiest waffles.  Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and I found it to be bland and it lacked fluffiness.  Needs to be sweetened up a little...and perhaps more baking soda?  I used 1% milk...maybe that was part of the problem.

This is a very very good waffle recipe. I added 4 tablespoons of sugar because I like mine sweet and 1 tsp vanilla essence. Delicious, golden and crispy.

This was very easy, easier than my usual waffle recipe.  But it was lacking a bit in texture I am used to.  I added some vanilla extract and sugar.  Good for a quick recipe.  I will make when I am in a hurry, but prefer my usual recipe if I have time.

This recipe was NOT as good as everyone claimed. They had way too much baking powder and tasted AWFUL! They tasted fine when we put toppings on it such as syrup or peanut butter but if you just put powdered sugar or eat them plain, they are disgusting! They were sour and dry. It might have been because we doubled the recipe. So maybe they're fine if you don't double. But if you do, don't double the powder.

Sorry, but we were not impressed. The waffles were way too dry & tasteless. I thought I had forgotten something & kept checking the recipe, but I am definitely going to try it again & give it a fair shake.

This was a great recipe!  I made it exactly as written once, and added vanilla and substituted half butter for the oil the second go around.  Both were great.  What I also appreciated was that the recipe makes what it says it will make.  These waffles were crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Good stuff :)

Made this recipe tonight and was disappointed. The waffles are heavy and chewy, and quite bitter. After tasting the first waffles, I added sugar, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup more milk to the batter. The next waffles were a little better, but still not great. I won't be making these again.

These waffles are delicious with a couple of changes to the original recipe. I add 1/4 cup of confectioner's sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

This is our go-to waffle recipe. They always come out wonderfully. I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla and shakes of cinnamon. I like to top with fresh fruit, or light brown sugar and golden raisins (with butter). I cook them on med-high on the georgeforman grill with the waffle iron attachment.

I love this recipe! We make it all the time. After reading some of the reviews, we add about 2 tbs sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and sometimes a little cinnamon. This is a wonderful versatile recipe which we will make over and over again.

I'm giving this only 3 stars because if you don't add anything to the batter to sweeten it up, or give it flavor, they are very bland.  I made them w/choc chips for the kids, but ran out, so I had the plain one that was left. That being said, I think these have to be the lightest and fluffiest waffles I've ever had!! Adding the beaten egg whites really makes a big difference than ordinary waffles. Worth the extra effort.   Take the advice of others and add either some sugar, frozen fruit, choc chips, or just some vanilla extract to add to the flavor.

I've never made waffles from scratch, these were perfect (fluffy inside, light crunchy toasty outside)   I altered as per other reviewer's comments because the very 1st waffle  was passable plain...so I quickly added to the remaining mixture, 2tsp vanilla, 1tbsp sugar, & 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  My 3 kids (8-11) & my husband.  They all thought the waffles were delicious.

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you (as it almost did me).  It's WONDERFUL and lends itself to numerous variations/additions.  Don't skip beating the egg whites!  It is key.  Beating the egg whites makes the batter light and fluffy (instead of runny), which magically makes it so that the batter doesn't drip out all over your kitchen counter if you get too much in your waffle iron.  It's my new go-to waffle recipe from now on.

So simple and good.  I cut the recipe in half and it made 2 good-sized waffles for me and one other person.  I added some vanilla to the batter. I was a little worried because the first batch didn't crisp up as much as I would have liked, but I think that was my waffle iron.  Second batch was better, and I ended up popping the first few in the toaster for a bit and they were perfect.  I think I'll make a bunch, slightly undercook them on purpose, freeze them, and pop them in the toaster at my whim! No more eggos for me!

Absolutely the best waffle recipe ever.  Light as air.  I added some sugar to make them stand up well on their own and need less syrup.  After this, any other recipe seems pithy!

I made this as written, the only difference is that I used 2:1 ratio of wheat flour to white flour. This is a good waffle for someone who wants to top it with fruit or syrup. Personally, I like my waffles to stand alone and eat them toasted with a little butter. I will fiddle with this one-it's a good base. The batter is thick enough to hold something (I'm thinking chocolate chips or blueberries) and it's easy to pour into the waffle iron and it cooks in only 2 minutes while others I have tried can take up to 5! I scaled the recipe to 12 and got 14 8in round waffles. They are very filling (maybe becuase I used wheat flour?) and we have plenty left to freeze and eat this week before school for breakfast or as an after school snack. Thanks Razz!

It's Sunday morning, I have 2 eggs and no box mix for pancakes or waffles. I grab the iPod, hit safari, and search for waffles on allrecipes. This one pops up first. I see the rave reviews, check for supplies and start mixing. I didn't mix the eggs the way it said, I just put them in the bowl with every thing else and I added vanilla. About 2 teaspoons. Fantastic! Hubby loved them! This is a keeper.

Good, solid, simple recipe for waffles. Turn out nice and light, with a crisp outside if you like them that well done (my kids mostly like "soft waffles"). Dont skip the fluffy egg whites! But! Like many others, I think they need a bit more flavor. I added a full 2 tsp vanilla and about 1/2 cup rehydrated dried blueberries, but even so I think some lemon extract would have been better (something my mom used to add to pancakes and waffles). Like I said, these have a great texture and I love that the recipe is not overly complicated, but next time I'll sub melted margarine - or maybe cinnamon applesauce - for oil and add some lemon extract (and/or lemon zest) and see how it goes!

These were good, though I felt they needed more flavor so I used only butter and added some sugar to the mix. It was good. Not great, however.

These waffles were not very good. Not crispy, no sugar, no vanilla, no cinnamon. Tasted very much like a sugar cone without the sugar.

Awesome...I normally make my sister's waffle recipe but I had misplaced it.  This one was perfect.  I really liked that it was basic so that whatever flavor you are in the mood for you can alter it to match.  We added blueberries to them today and everyone loved them. =)

This is an excellent recipe! Wonderful foundation! However, my favorite waffles contain fruit or walnuts for additional flavor and texture. First, I used this recipe to create apple cinnamon waffles by adding 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 cup of apple sauce. When making apple cinnamon waffles, I only add 1-1/4 cups of milk due to the liquid from the apple sauce. For additional sweetness, I add 2 tbsp. of sugar. I add the apple sauce, cinnamon and sugar before folding the egg whites. Secondly, I used this recipe to create blueberry waffles. Follow the recipe and add 8 oz. of frozen blueberries. I recommend wild blueberries from Trader Joe's. Again, I add the blueberries before folding the egg whites. The final version is my banana walnut waffle recipe where I add 2 ripe bananas and 8 oz. of chopped walnuts to food processor. First, I allow the processor to turn the bananas to a paste and then I add the chopped walnuts.  Finally, I add the other ingredients except the egg whites to the processor and mix again. I transfer the banana walnut mix into another bowl and fold the egg whites. My recommendation is to experiment with various flavors and toppings. Depending on your taste buds, the possibilities are endless.  If you have left over waffles, place them in a freezer bag and freeze the waffles. During the week, take a frozen waffle and place it in the toaster. Believe me, it's a yummy breakfast! Finally, if you're using a Belgium waffle maker, this recipe will yield fewer waffles.

I cannot believe how simple this recipe is!  We all enjoyed the waffles.  The first time that I made them I was serving breakfast and followed the recipe exactly.  The second time was for dessert, so I added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and served them with ice cream.  A wonderful treat! =)

I've been making waffles for years, and it is a waste of time and effort to separate and beat the eggs before adding them to the batter.  They don't get any lighter or fluffier.

I loved this waffle recipe.  Easy and delicious- very impressed with the flavor.  I followed directions exactly.  I used half of the batter for breakfast, refrigerated the left overs for making dinner waffles that night- still just as good!

I was nervous because I made the waffle recipe in Germany and change the recipe into metric.  But it turned out great.  I added a little cinnamon to give it some kick.  It is worth taking the time (like advise in other reviews) to fold in the eggs whites.  I will keep this on in my recipe box!!

Easy, good recipe.  I didn't read the reviews before making, added eggs w/o separating and still liked.  I am going to mix up and stored the dry ingredients to speed up the process for the next time (my children love waffles and we make them frequently).  It seemed to make more than four servings.

We love this recipe!  One time I was out of oil and substituted melted butter for the oil if you like a buttery taste!  My kids love it and since they are so active it was okay for me to add the butter!  Yum! Yum!  Thank you for this recipe!

I made these last Saturday morning as an on-the-fly decision and was pleasantly surprised.  I usually make a yeast waffle, but didn't plan ahead Friday night, so I needed something that would be ready quickly to feed a whole gaggle of hungry kids.  
  I tripled this recipe but used almond milk (my kids are lactose-intolerant so I use almond milk in 90% of my baking) and naturally white whole wheat flour instead without adjusting the recipe proportions at all.  That was probably a mistake. :) I ended up putting in a bit of vanilla extract and some more milk at the end to thin out the batter a little bit right before putting them into the waffle-maker and add some flavor.  That was my second mistake.
  My family ended up referring to these as the "lack-luster waffles" but I wholeheartedly believe that was due to using sub-par vegetable oil left over from a fish-fry (at least it hadn't been used :P), not adjusting the proportions of my ingredients when using the whole wheat flour, and messing with the batter after folding in the peaked egg whites.  That's why I still rated the recipe 4 stars.

What sold me on trying this recipe was the review that said that this was an awesome base recipe to which you can add a variety of different flavor combinations to suit your own tastes and it doesn't make the "base" fall flat. 

This was so true! While I usually try to make a recipe unmodified prior to altering, I do like a bit of flavor to the waffle, so I added a 1/2 of natural applesauce and a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, I reduced the oil to 3 T and added a T of brown sugar. They rose well while in the waffle maker, were crispy on the outside and dense and yummy on the inside, and just were overall really tasty. Can't wait to try other varieties. Yum! Thanks!

This is the second time I've made these and they are a hit with hubby! I use vanilla almond milk and also add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4-1/2 tsp vanilla. It comes out with great consistency and just the right crisp on the outside. I serve with a side of eggs and it makes about 5 waffles, so we freeze extras if we don't eat them all. They heat up well in the toaster!

I followed the recipe unadulterated.  It had great texture and decent browning.  Nice toothiness and chew.  However they were virtually flavorless.  I'd modify it with sugar and vanilla.

Seemed fine, but cooked up like waffle-shaped pancakes.  It might be my crappy waffle iron, as I've never been able to get the proper mixture of crispy exterior and light inside.  I did add a dash of vanilla and 3 tsp or so of sugar.  Flavor was great.

Great recipe!  I used half milk and half buttermilk, which reacts with the baking powder to create gases that make the batter very light and airy.  Also added 3T of sugar and 2t of vanilla for added flavor.  After trying several recipes for my new Belgian Waffle maker, this is the one I will use from now on.  thanks for posting!

Simplicity really IS key. I wanted a recipe that didn't rely on large amounts of butter like the one I've always had, and seeing as this got good 
reviews, I tried it.

I scaled it down to a 2 serving recipe and added all but the salt and it turned out great! This will definitely be a keeper from now on....

These waffles are perfect.  I'm always altering recipes, but I follow this one exactly.  I'll often make a double batch so I have some to freeze.  I just pop a frozen waffle in the toaster and it comes out great!

this is a great recipe. I usually have one or two over ripe bananas left over at the end of the week and they always get added with a dash of vanilla pudding mix (dry) and a cinnamon/nutmeg mixture.

This is an excellent recipe. I added some vanilla extract to mine and it added a little extra flavorti the batter. I also made a double batch and froze the extras to pop in the toaster when there is a mornin I wouldn't have time to make a fresh batch. 5 stars!

These are very tasty waffles.  They are really filling and all my kids loved them.  We added 3/4 cup chocolate chips just before cooking them and you can save them and eat them for snacks.  These waffles are really light and fluffy.  We added 2 T. sugar as well. We used olive oil because it is healthier.  We will definitely use this recipe again!

Our family felt the waffles tasted too much like pancake mix and was too heavy.  Sorry but will have to go back to my original recipe which is light and fluffy....changes are 1/2 tsp salt, 2 cups milk, 1/2 cup oil, 3 separated eggs, 1 tbsp sugar, vanilla optional

Made these as stated and they turned out very light and moist.  Based on taste after making a couple decided to add about a tbs of sugar and some vanilla.

These are a great base, but a little bland as-is.  I added a couple teaspoons of sugar and a slpash of vanilla, per some of the other suggestions.  The texture is great though- nicely crispy on the outside and soft inside.

Easy and delicious.  Won't be buying a mix anymore!  Waffles were delicate and fluffy.  Added a teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon and used 1 C. of whole wheat flour to replace white.

Sorry for the 2 star!  But I have tried to make these twice.....once followed the recipe exactly, the 2nd time i added sugar and vanilla, but still very bland.  I know waffles aren't intended to be a spectacular party in your mouth, but I expect them to be better than box mix if I am going to slave away!  :-)

Thanks for such simple and delightful recipe! I used all-purpose whole wheat flower and added a 1/2 cup of frozen Maine blueberries, and the waffles were still beautifully fluffy, not dense or tough.

Very good, and easy!  I got a waffle iron for Christmas, and when we took it out of the box this morning (after I whipped up the waffle mix), we found it broken, so had to make pancakes with the waffle mix.  Works great for that too.....light fluffy pancakes!  This is definitely going in my recipe box!

This are wonderful I keep forgetting to snap a picture every time I make them. I've made then without whipping the whites and just adding the eggs and I've made them with the whites whipped. Both are delicious but with the whites whipped they are so much fluffier. I've started freezing them then just popping them in the toaster when rushed!

PERFECTION! My first attempt at waffles from scratch. VERY EASY to make, and takes only minutes. Omit the sifting step if you like.  I didn't sift, and the waffles were fabulous.  I added some sugar, vanilla, almond extract, and cinnamon.

These were really good. My husband made these for breakfast this morning. He added 1 tsp of vanilla and used white whole wheat flour for part of the flour- which made them very filling. He also let them sit while he went to the store to buy syrup. I think he was really craving whole wheat waffles.

Pretty yummy waffles.  Folding in the egg whites made them so light.  I think they could be improved by using melted butter for the oil as there was just something a little off, a bit spongey?

Not too impressed. It tastes like an ice cream cone, not even a waffle cone.

Seems like a lot of baking powder, but who cares? They came out perfect. I didn't whip the egg whites, btw, and they were excellent.

Followed recipe exactly except added chocolate chip morsels to batter! Yummm! Hubby said that the waffles had more flavor and they were fluffy. Kids loved them too so that gets 5 stars! Thanks!

This is so far my favorite waffle recipes. I did add 2 T. sugar and 1 t. vanilla. I also use melted butter instead of oil sometimes. I make these almost once a week. They freeze great for home-made toaster waffles :)

Great base recipe. I added 3 tbsp of sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp butter flavoring, 1/2 cup fresh blueberries and 1/8 allspice to the mix before folding in the egg whites. I was afraid there would not be enough for my family of 5 prior to folding in the egg whites.  Once I folded in the egg whites, it made a big difference. Do not avoid beating the egg whites till stiff. It only takes a minutes and will make or break this recipe in my opinion. Thanks to RAZZ_BRRY_JAM for a great basic recipe ;)

I just made this for breakfast and it was great! The author is very right when they say you will never buy another boxed mix again. The only change I made was to add a little vanilla and sugar. The only downside I see is that I ate so many I'm going to have to do some extra workouts!! :P

It's a good starter. I wouldn't ever keep the recipe as written. It DEFINITELY needs sugar, more salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Otherwise it's extremely bland and not very good. I can't see how anyone can eat it without some modifications, really.

I would use this recipe only with changes. My first batch turned out to be very bland so I added more salt and sugar. With these modifications I am more than likely to make these waffles again.

I found these waffles to be quite dry. I was careful not to overcook them, but perhaps my waffle iron is too hot. Nevertheless, I will not make these again.

Best waffle recipe yet! They are fluffy and have a nice light flavor that goes perfectly with maple syrup. They have the disadvantage of having to separate eggs and fold in the stiffened egg whites but if you are willing and able to do that then you will be greatly rewarded with fantastic tasting waffles! ENJOY!

Great waffles!!!  This is my first time making them from scratch and not some processed mix, and they came out fantastic.  I tweaked it a bit...replaced 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with whole wheat, added cinnamon (didn't measure)and 1 tbl sugar, plus one chopped Granny Smith apple to mix.  Very delicious! This is now my standard waffle recipe.

Great recipe, added vanilla and 2 Tbs. sugar for a sweeter waffle. Just the 2 of us so I halved the recipe. Topped with sliced sweetened strawberries (with juice) and whipped cream. Will definitely be making again!

Followed the above suggestions and added sugar/cinnamon/vanilla, used 3/4c milk, 3/4c buttermilk (from powdered), and used 1 cup all purpose white flour plus 1 cup white whole wheat flour.  These were heartily eaten by all, including the fussiest youngest one and pronounced "the best waffles ever" by my husband.

Excellent basic waffle recipe! Don't leave out the beaten egg whites - they give this recipe their lift and tenderness. Easy to add on extras to this batter.

These were ok.  They were doughy in the center and not sweet.  After tasting the first one I added in a small amount of sugar and they still lacked a sweet flavor.  Was hoping to find a recipe that had few ingredients and flavorful without the syrup.

This recipe was my first ever attempt at waffles, so I don't have much to compare it to... but they were AMAZING!  I just bought a waffle iron for a photo shoot and I couldn't wait to try it.  I did switch out the oil for applesauce though, and they were nice and fluffy.  I also added some cinnamon and a tsp. of vanilla just for a sweet taste.  I can't believe how easy these were to make!  My fiance and I topped it off with a little bit of ice cream and cool whip.  It was a great dinner!

I found these waffles a little dry and lacking in flavor. I added vanilla and almond extract and it helped. But they were still drier than I would like

This was a solid waffle recipe. I read a lot of reviews and added 3 TB of sugar and 3 tsp of vanilla and they were very tasty. I made a lot and will freeze them for when I need a quick breakfast for my daughter.

Followed the excellent suggestions of CLINK 1833 and used 3T. suger, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1c. frozen blueberries. This recipe has saved my waffle-iron; I was about to give up on ever making perfect waffles, and then I found this delicious recipe! Thank you Karen!

I changed up the recipe a bit by adding some sugar, vanilla, subbed butter for the oil and making my own buttermilk(subbing the milk for it). It was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend, daughter and i chowed down.

This is nice starter recipe. You can tweak it to your preference and the waffles turn out well. It is also more simple and easier to use than other waffle recipes. I made a few changes such as using vanilla extract, butter, and sugar. The waffles turn out better if you cook them on the darker setting on the waffle maker.

Oh my gosh! Spot on. I made them as directed, with the exception of my egg substitute as I have an allergy. (Noting for myself: thick egg replacement for yolk. Then add 1tbs oil with another "egg" whip and add for whites)

I really like this recipe. The batter is nice and thick so it doesn't ooze out of my waffle iron, and instead fluffs up super well. I love that when I put butter and syrup on the waffle it doesn't completely deflate like many other recipes on here do. The recipe is like a blank canvas; I added 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a tsp cinnamon. This has been bumped up to my new favorite waffle recipe, thank you!

I have made this recipe twice now.  The second time I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a Tablespoon of sugar.  I like the waffles a lot and t hey freeze really well...for how long I don't know since they are all eaten by t he end of the week!  Thought the waffles were a bit tough but used a Belgian waffle maker.  Very easy!

We loved these but next time I'll half the sugar. I halved the oil and used applesauce for the rest. I'll also decrease the ginger. Made 20 regular sized muffins. Done in 19 minutes.

Everyone that I make  these waffles for love them. I have made them according to recipe and with some tweeks, I add 1 tsp real vanilla Extract. I  have also added  t tsp. Cinnamon to the batter.
They are fluffy and the comments people make is it must be whipping the the egg whites that makes them so fluffy.

These were very light and fluffy, however, they need something to cover the slight baking powder taste.  Cinnamon, sugar, and/or vanilla, etc. would have made them better.  A great base though.

This is a simple yet delicious recipe. These are light, fluffy and the best waffles I've ever had. I've made this several times and have added fruit a few times. One tip- do not over whip the egg whites or you'll have heavy waffles, not the light and fluffy ones this recipe produces. I use a waffle maker and we absolutely love these waffles.

Favorite waffle recipe so far on AR. Light and fluffy. Made 12 servings (2/3 cup each)  = 13 waffles. My family only ate 3 so we froze the rest.

Great recipe. I couldn't follow it exactly; I didn't have any oil, so I substituted with the same amount of unsalted butter. I added a bit of sugar and a dash of vanilla as well. 
These came out a pale golden color and the texture is soft, not crispy, but that's perfect for my taste. (I don't care for crispy waffles. Eggos are pretty bad, imo.)

I did not make any changes, although next time I will double the recipe, as there was not enough for us. My grandchildren loved these waffles and so did I. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great base recipe.  For my family, it was too bland as written, so I made a couple of changes.  To make it healthier, I substituted one cup of oat flour for white, added two tablespoons of ground flax seed, and used coconut oil.  To make it tastier, I added two tablespoons of sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and one of cinnamon.  This made them to die for.
Thanks for sharing!

For added flavor you can break up bacon pieces and place them on top of the batter after it is poured on the waffle iron.  Also can sprinkle cinnamon or pumpkin spice for a Fal flavor.

This is the best waffle recipe I've come across. I've made it a number of times and my family loves it. I've found that I need to increase the milk to 2 or 2-1/2 cups to get the batter to a pourable consistency, and I add a tsp or so of vanilla.

You can cook hard for that nice crispy outer shell, with the inside staying moist and fluffy.  Add powdered sugar and your favorite fruit together with maple syrup and your as good, or better, than any restaurant.  Quick and easy, so now this replaces my overnight recipe!

Light and fluffy and easy to make.  I was skeptical about whipping the egg whites but was glad I took the time to do it.  Wasn't sweet enough for my family, and next time I will add a little sugar and vanilla.

This is a basic, no frills waffle recipe that would be good as a base for any savory toppings, however because I make waffles for breakfast, I prefer a more complex base that incorporates butter, vanilla, and a little sugar.

Easy and yummy. But not quick. The eggs need to be whipped and folded in, so as much as I like these, I don't always take the time to make them. But a great recipe.

Good recipe, I used the whole egg and ended up adding some cinnamon and vanilla for more flavor otherwise these are pretty bland. But it is a good basic recipe for waffles that allows you to add what you want.

Wonderfully delicious and easy recipe. Ran out of waffle mix for Thanksgiving breakfast and had ingredients to make it from scratch. Everyone loved it! Can also substitute some of the all-purpose flour with wheat flour to make it a bit healthier.

I have made this recipe several times with no changes.  Whipping the egg whites allows for a light and crisp waffle- great recipe!  Also, these freeze great for reheating at another time.  You can freeze with wax paper in between, or "flash freeze" on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet until frozen, then put in a  freezer-safe container.

This recipe was wonderful! I added vanilla, and my waffles were very flavorful. No sugar added. 

They were light and airy. Recipes that call for butter tend to make a heavier, soggy waffle. I will use this recipe from now on.

Great Recipe for light & fluffy waffles. Easy ingredients to gather & mix up & they turned out very good. Did add the vanilla & sugar like a couple reviewers suggest. This is a keeper!

Waffles II Haiku: "I'm a waffle w40r3. I will eat them anytime. No complaints with these!" Ahhh is there anything better than a golden fluffy waffle on a lazy weekend morning? I'm working my way through sampling all of the AR waffle recipes, and this particular one didn't disappoint. Only change that I had to make was subbing applesauce for the veg oil (Shocker, right? Who is ever out of veg oil?), but that didn't diminish the simple, and scrumptious, end result of zee tastee Waffles II.

This recipe beats the one that came with my waffle maker.  It is so easy on a busy morning and my grandsons loved it.  Much lighter than most I have tried.  Added 3 tbs sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and it had really good flavor with out syrup.

This recipe is not very different from the one that came with my waffle maker, so I was surprised by how much better the results are.  My 4 year old actually ate 3 of them and asked for more.  Even the baby ate a whole one (plain without syrup).  They are great with agave nectar (instead of maple syrup) and fresh blackberries on top.  We loved them with blueberries added into the batter as well.  I'm really glad I gave this recipe a try, I will definitely be making these again.  Well worth the extra step of beating the egg whites seperately and mixing them in.

Super delicious and easy to make!!! So very customizable to! I followed the recipe and directions exactly, then added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 can of cherry pie filling. I used the remainder pie filling to top the waffles and served up. Best. Waffles. Ever.

Delicious basic waffles recipe, not bitter or anything. I tried it as-is to find out what I was dealing with. Make sure to spray your waffle iron even if it is non-stick. For the subsequent waffles I added half a cup of sugar and bit of vanilla. I served with cut fruits: mango, pineapple and bananas (shredded coconut is also delicious with this combination). A sprinkle of powder sugar and maple syrup helps crown this beautiful treat.

Fantastic!  I've been a Bisquick user for years and ran out for dinner tonight.  I'm SO glad you put this here!!  I used 1/2 of wheat flour and 1 1/2 all purpose flour, but kept the rest the same.  They rocked!  Crispy on the outside and perfectly warm and moist on the inside.  We used them with our chicken and chicken gravy for Chicken & waffles (a family favorite).  Thanks again!!

These were wonderful! They were very filling than previous ones I made before because they were more dense. I made a tiny change in the recipe, instead of using vegetable oil I used butter, works the same.

I will never use mix again! These are sooooo easy and amazing! Better than local resturants. I did add just a little bit of vanilla and sugar and they are great! Topped with strawberries and cream I have a seriously bad stomach ache because I couldn't stop at one and ended up eating another half...will def be making waffles more often!

What a great recipe - so glad I gave this a try. I helped make waffles when I was a kid, but in the decades since, I've had nothing but store-bought frozen waffles. Even though I got a second-hand waffle iron a couple of years ago, I hesitated to use it until now. This was so easy and it was exciting to finally make waffles from scratch. I made it exactly as written; the flour I used was unbleached, and the salt was sea salt - the only kinds I had on hand. I had a little trouble with beating the egg whites "until soft peaks form". I was using a fork, and don't think I quite achieved it, but I'm sure a hand blender would work much better for this. My waffle iron has nice non-stick plates, so after one waffle, I realized I could skip spraying them with non-stick cooking spray. This made 6 big waffles for me, and they froze well so I could have a waffle almost every morning for a week. I can't say that these are the best waffles ever - I'm not a waffle connoisseur - but I'll make these again and again, and I'll give this recipe 4 stars. (I usually read all prior reviews before posting my own, but I'm skipping the 235 prior reviews here.)

These were great!  I didn't change anything about the recipe and they came out just right.  You could add vanilla or sugar if you like your waffles sweet.  I brushed my waffle iron with oil instead of Pam because the sprays supposedly break down the non-stick surface.

This is a GREAT recipe - I added sugar and after the batter was all mixed up I thinned it out with some Cream Soda.  I double the recipe and froze the remaining waffles - perfect to put in the toaster for the kids before school - My kids said they never want me to buy the toaster waffles again.  Thank You for the recipe.

These waffles are super easy to make. I can crank out the batter and get them into the iron in 10 minutes. The flavor is really good. Just as quick as using a boxed mix.  I have made them exactly as written, I have also added blue berries to it, and sometimes when my kids aren't looking I add wheat germ and flax seed. I have also made this with soy milk on occasion. It has turned out every time.

I give this 4 stars because it is a good base.  I added sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.  They were excellent!

My family loves Belgian waffles with different syrups.  This is an easy and excellent recipe that could easily be adapted, depending on the wants of your family.  I added a 1/4 cup of sugar, a little cinnamon, and toasted chopped walnuts to the waffle recipe.  I had leftover homemade cranberry sauce made with some chopped apples, more walnuts, and orange juice and thinned this mixture with maple syrup.  My family has not stopped talking about these delicious waffles since I made them.. Next time I think will come up with a clementine version...

Great recipe!  Very fluffy and delicious.  My only suggestion would be to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of white sugar to add a little sweetness.

Made these tonight along with eggs and sausage as 'breakfast for dinner' and thought they were just OK.  The taste was fine, pretty similar to the pancake/waffle mix I have used in the past.  Just not as fluffy as I would have liked, even though the batter contained the whipped egg whites it still came out rather heavy.  Might try altering the recipe a bit or another recipe next time.

Great recipe for your basic waffle! We got a waffle maker for Christmas and have tried many recipes, this has been the best recipe that we have tried and was so easy to alter. We have added choc chips, friut, and even M&M's to this recipe so it is easy to tweak to your personal taste.

The first time I tried this recipe I followed it to a teeT; it turned out all right but not great.  Tried it again this morning.  Took the advice of other reviewers to add more sugar, cinnamon, vanilla.  Definitely more milk because the batter was a bit thick.  This time it turned out excellent.  My husband and our 7-year-old loved it.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  My mom always made her waffles by folding in the egg whites, but I haven't been able to recreate it until now.  I did adjust the recipe a little, but I overall, I was very pleased.  Thanks

Wonderful!  I only had one egg left this morning, so I halved the recipe.  It was plenty for my two boys and me.  I sprinkled mini-chocolate chips on theirs after cooking, and sprinkled pecans on top of mine (right on the batter in the waffle iron).  We poured honey on top.  I did not take the time to whip the egg white separately, with only one egg.  I have another recipe which calls for whipping the whites, so I know how fluffy it makes the waffles.  However, I thought this recipe still turned out nice and fluffy without the extra trouble. I made one change:  In place of the milk amount, I used half milk and half plain whole-milk yogurt.  I always keep it on hand and find it to be a great substitute for any recipes using buttermilk or sour cream.  (I have a buttermilk pancake recipe I always use yogurt in, and I like the way it turns out.)  The yogurt thickened up the batter a bit too much, so I poured just a bit more milk in before cooking.  I'll be using this recipe from now on, as it's so easy to put together.

Very good waffle recipe! I admit I usually use a box mix but have been looking for a simple recipe that I can change up on my own.  This was it!  We used 1/2 whole wheat flour and took some other suggestions using some vanilla, cinnamon, and a small amount of sugar.  They were amazing! We will be using this recipe again.

I was excited to make these waffles after all the great reviews, but they really were bland. They may have been big and poofy  but even after adding cinnamon, sugar, vanilla, and even a dash of nutmeg I felt that they weren't as yummy as they could have been. Maybe it was my waffle maker. I bet this would be a better recipe for thin waffles instead of thick Belgian style ones.

I thought this recipe was excellent!  I didn't have enough regular milk so I substituted it with vanilla soy milk and they were very tasty.  You do have to make sure your waffle iron is greased though.

This is a very good basic recipe which makes a nice light product and is amenable to personalization.  I increased the whole recipe by half, so I made it with 2 c. all purpose & 1 c. whole wheat flour.  I added 1/4 c. brown sugar.  They were still light and golden.  I think you could add lemon zest & blueberries, or vanilla & mini choc. chips as well. Very nice!

This was an easy recipe. I added a bit more lemon zest than the recipe called for, severed with blueberries and a dusting of confectioners sugar on top. Delicious!

This recipe makes perfect waffles.  I varied the recipe a bit and used all whole wheat flour and added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of cloves.  My kids loved them.  They topped them off with banannas and some apple sauce!

These waffles are Heavenly!  I really like them because they aren't sugary (which is better for flavor if you are going to eat them with something sugary on top i.e. syrup, fruit, ice cream etc) They remind me of the waffles from the bisquick mix. They would probably make great pancakes too.  I will definitely be making them again.

Best texture I've gotten out of a homemade waffle yet, but there's still something not quite right (in both taste and texture). I'll definitely make this again and will try to tweak it.

I love this recipe because it always turns out light and fluffy... Once I was out of eggs so I used 1 tablespoon flax seed and 2 teaspoons water for every egg, It turned out great! Now I use the flax seed instead!!! :)

Great waffles! This was my first time making waffles - ever, and they came out perfect! Even on my cheap $7 Target brand waffle maker!! After the first batch came out so great, I made another batch to freeze. Now we can throw them in the toaster in the morning and go... WAY better than those store-bought frozen waffles.

I don't need sweet waffles, the syrup on top is enough--I did however add a 1/2 cup milk because my batter seemed too thick. They turned out great!

I've never made waffles before (from a mix or otherwise) and these were simple and delicious!  Fried up some green apples with cinnamon and sugar, then some whipped cream.  I impressed my company:)

Delicious and easy to make. Needed a little more flavor, though, so I added some vanilla.

I have never rated anything on this site before, but I had to rate this recipe. I was a little apprehensive about not adding sugar and mixing until the batter was smooth, but wow! They are good! My daughter and I eat them plain with our fingers and they taste like something from the fair!

Great  recipe!    I added 1 T. sugar and 2 t. vanilla to round out the recipe.  I ended up needing to add a little water to thin out the batter b/c I like my waffles a little thinner.

This is such a great recipe! I used half wheat flour and half unbleached all-purpose, added 3 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 cups of finely chopped strawberries and they turned out wonderfully! Stored well in the refrigerator and was able to get waffles for three days out of this recipe.

This is the first recipe I've tried that didn't leak out the back of my waffle iron.  I didn't change a thing.  They were light and crispy and perfect.  Have a non-stick machine, so didn't spray and there was no sticking.

This the perfect recipe. They were so easy. I did halve the recipe and it made 6 waffles. I will keep the recipe the same the next time because the leftover waffles are awesome.

Best easy waffle recipe I've found!  This base mix would probably go well with adding your favorite flavors (berries, cinnamon, etc.)  I'll be trying a few next time.  Thanks for sharing!

These are so quick to whip up and they have a perfect crisp outer crust and fluffy inside. I have successfully added chocolate chips or blueberries to this recipe and they turned out great. Don't add too many blueberries and if you do make sure you cut down on flour a bit otherwise they turn out too wet.

Excellent texture but a little bland tasting. A great base for fruits and cream but not the best with just butter and maple syrup like I like them.

My husband got a waffle maker for his birthday and we needed a recipe for the next morning!  These waffles are light and fluffy and DELICIOUS......they have become a Saturday morning favorite.  I do sweeten the batter a bit with a little sugar and vanilla, but you can't go wrong with the original recipe.  Definitely give it a try!

Great recipe! I was out of the box stuff that I normally use and my kiddos wanted waffles. I found this and luckily had everything on hand. Super easy! It's a great base recipe to add other things to. My kids gobbled these up. Can't wait to play around with this recipe and see what kinds of things we can come up with! The first request was banana waffles.

This was by far the best waffle recipe I have made so far. The waffles were light and fluffy. I made these Christmas Eve morning for my parents and family. My mom who is hard to please when it comes to waffles, absolutely loved them. I will definitely be making these again in the future.

This is a delicious waffle recipe that has replaced mu previously favorite recipe - and this one is a lot easier too! Moist, fluffy waffles with a flaky outside. I substituted some malt powder for some of the flour and it gave it a nice depth of flavor without being too overpowering. Give this one a try!

Sorry, I hate to rate something low but I felt this recipe was very bland. I also had to add a lot of liquid to get it to the right consistency for pouring.

Awesome!  I subbed half the flour for whole wheat and half the oil for applesauce and it was perfect (a bit too dry/dense when I did all whole wheat/apple sauce).  Oh, and really good with chocolate chips!

Great recipe! I added 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 2% milk, they were delicious!! We like our waffles crispy by leaving them longer in the grill and they came out fine. Easy and delicious.

Hm so I am torn b/c I assume since everyone likes this recipe I have done it wrong.  My batter was quite thin.  The waffles cooked up very spongey and fluffy and had an odd aftertaste.  This is the second time I have used the iron so it could be that...These just seemed so spongey and eggy.  If anyone knows what could have caused that....

Wonderful! I made a few changes to make these a bit more healthful. I replaced 1 cup of flour with white whole wheat flour (from King Arthur), replaced 3 TBSP of oil with 3 TBSP of unsweetened applesauce. Added 1 TBSP agave nectar, 2 tsp vanilla and 3 shakes of cinnamon. Served with heated banana slices and chopped walnuts and a little pure maple syrup. Delicious!

Very easy!  I really won't ever use an instant mix again.  This batter does make perfect fluffy yet crispy on the outside waffles.  The only thing I'll add next time I try it is perhaps some cinnamon and nutmeg in the mix.

These were great... I got all the way through the recipe until I was supposed to add the oil and then realized that I was out of oill.... so I leff it out... worked out great.. just sprayed the maker with non-stick spray and the waffles were perfect.  Would definately make again!

I made this recipe for my new Belgian waffle maker. They turned out just fine. I will have to play around with it some more - my first effort drew rave reviews from the family, but I think I will add a bit of sugar next time. Just so you know, the batter was extremely thick, but it baked up well. Thanks for posting.

O.k..I'm giving this a four although I'm sure it deserves a five.  My waffles have an after taste?  Is it the ingredients or the fact that it's a new waffle maker?  I made them at indicated, then added some other suggestions like sugar and cinnamon.  I hope it's the taste of a new iron because this recipe was quite easy!!! Thank you

This is a great waffle recipe. I have tried not whipping the egg whites to save some time but it was just not the same. You can add anything to these waffles, if I don't add any berries or chocolate to them sometimes I add some sugar, it's really whatever you are in the mood for.

Scrumptious!(I'm sooo loving this website!) Made these waffles for breakfast this morning, and I've never made waffles from scratch before. I was so pleased with them, and so were my husband and step son! I did add about a Tbls of pure Vanilla Extract to the batter. Topped waffles with confection sugar and fresh blueberries. They were devoured! My step son, who is a junior in college said, 'It's been sooo long since I had fresh blueberry waffles!' That was worth it to me! Thanks; I'll be using this recipe for a long time!

simple, fantastic, elegant and yummy.
They were easy to make and fun to modify.
I always try to cram nutritious ingredients into everything for my 4 year old so this was perfect for adding, molasses, psyllium husk and wheat germ.

This is a very good standard recipe.  I like the egg whites added at the end.  It made enough for me to freeze some.  I will add some vanilla or cinnamon next time, just because that is what we prefer.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My 13 year old daughter wanted to make waffles and we usually make them from a pancake mix but didn't have any so we found this recipe.  She was able to do the whole thing on her own and they turned out fabulous!  Great recipe!  Tastes good and very easy to make

I fixed this and my kids absolutely loved it better than store bought they said. So I made a bunch and put them in the freezer so all I have to do is get them out throw them in the microwave and breakfast is served.

I thought these waffles were really good.  I followed the tips of others and added a 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.  My kids loved them!  I will definitely make these again.  I didn't seperate the eggs either and they were perfect!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. I have been looking for a good waffle recipe for years! All of my waffles came out heavy (I'm talking like a pound each) and blaaaa.... I tried this recipe on a whim and loved. I love how you whip the egg whites and fold them into the batter. The waffles came out light and crispy.....so good! I served with strawberry and powdered sugar. My family loved them. I will definatly make this recipe again!

A really great, quick and easy recipe.  I used everything the recipe asked for, but I did substitute fat free half and half mixed with water for the milk.  I love that it's not sweet.  My sons and husband loved the waffles.

I found the waffles to be a bit tough and not crisp on the outside.  I, like others, added vanilla & 1T of sugar, which helped the taste. Any tips on how to not mix them too much to prevent the toughness?

I normally make a recipe of my friend's grandpa, but it uses buttermilk (which I didn't have) so I decided to try this one. This recipe was quite easy to follow. The result were some waffles that weren't awesome but were relatively good. A quick and easy recipe that makes some good waffles. I will definently make these again when I don't have buttermilk for the other ones.

I have made them a couple of times.  I like this recipe alot.  I put a half tsp of baking soda for some crisp and brown color.  I also add a dash of vanilla and cinnamon.

These were just alright.  They didn't get as crispy on the outside as I would have liked, and the taste was just average.  I'll keep looking.

This is the very first recipe I have tried from the site, and now the first of many. I added some sugar and vanilla essence and was very pleased with the result.  Thanks.

This recipe made TERRIFIC waffles... just the way I like them! A great crispy outside, and tender inside. Folding in the whites makes a beautiful, tasty waffle. I added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar into the flour mixture, and it didn't hurt the recipe at all! I will always use THIS recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I loved that it was easy and quick to make, especially since this was my first time ever making waffles that weren't frozen to be toasted.  I only added 1 Tb sugar, no vanilla... and they were perfect.

Easy to make light and fluffy waffles. Added a little vanilla for more flavour. Thanks for the tip on the sugar.
