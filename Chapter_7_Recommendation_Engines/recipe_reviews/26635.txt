This is really easy and good with ground turkey.  I thought it made about 8 servings.

I prepared this dish on our "mexican fiesta feast night".  It was a big hit, and went great with taco salad, mexican rice, and fried ice cream for dessert.  What fun!

This dish is sooo tasty and easy.  I prepared this for a Girls Night Out "Fiesta Night", and it was a huge hit.  I used Fiesta Corn and substituted jalapenos for the green chiles....very spicy and good.  Have already made this twice and loved it both times.

Very quick, easy, and tasty.  I loved it, but the kids didn't like the cornbread topping as much as I did.

This was ok, my family liked it. I thought it was too sweet. Maybe one should mix up ones own cornbread, being careful not to add too much sugar rather than using a pkg. cornbread mix. We served it upside down and topped it with sour cream and diced tomatoes etc.like a taco. It turned out very well.

This is a really quick and easy recipe.  I love spicy food and using mexican cornbread mix instead of plain cornbread mix makes it even better.

I have made this recipe several times and also increased it for a potluck.  It turns out great every time.  My husband is a picky eater but he ate seconds and took the leftovers for his lunch.  I will diffently make this again and again.

This was a fast and easy recipe that tasted great...much better than the run of the mill mexican casserole.  My very picky husband loved it and went back for seconds!

Great recipe.  I didn't have all of the ingred. on hand so i made the following substitutions and had great results:  1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the salsa; skipped the olives; added 1/2 of chopped bell pepper; skipped the chilis.  it came out perfect.  very yummy !

This has been in my recipe box since 2002 ~ and finally made it last night!  It was surprisingly good.  Next time I make it though, I will double the beef layer ingredients to make it a bit more substantial.  Good!

If I make this again, I will put the cheese and the green chiles in with the meat. It gave the cornbread a soggy, gummy texture. I would probably also consider fresh ingredients instead of canned, although it sure is quick to prepare with the canned goods.

I have to agree with everyone...This is a keeper! My husband ate seconds and had leftovers later on! Didn't need to change a thing. I used "medium" salsa and regular taco seasonings (not spicy, not mild). Turned out excellent. It was only slightly spicy-which I like. Will be making this again and again!

This wasn't too difficult to make, and it tasted fair, but I'm not sure if I'd make it again. My husband thought there was too much bread and not enough meat. My problem might have been with the type of cornbread I used, but I thought it was too sweet to go well with the taco filling. We love mexican food, but this wasn't one of our favorites.

My family absolutely devoured this dish.  I served up a side salad and there were no leftovers from a doubled recipe.  I get begged to make this more often and it is really quite easy to put together.

Very easy and my husband LOVES this recipe.  We love tomatoes so I omitted the water and used a slightly drained can of chopped tomatoes.  I can never find just a pound of ground beef in the store so I use a little more than the recipe calls for.  If your dish is shallow be sure to put some foil under it to catch drips.  First time i made it there was a mess in the oven. This recipe will become a family staple!

I've been making this for years, exactly as written,  My husband loves it and any time I make for friends they ask for recipe. Our son took the recipe with him when he went off to college last year.  This is a favorite family recipe. Serve with sour cream and guac on the side and a nice Mexican salad.
