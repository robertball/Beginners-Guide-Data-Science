I halved the recipe, used chicken base granules for the salt as I was serving with fried chicken, the flavour was spot on for us. Thanks!

Made as written and without a hiccup. I've struggled with gravy in the past but has no issues whatsoever with this one. Not a huge sage fan but this was the perfect amount for us and it added a nice flavor. If you really love sage I recommended adding more. With that being said, we love our white gravy peppery so I added more to suit our taste. For not having sausage in it, this was really good! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious gravy. Served with veggie chicken nuggets and mashed potatoes. Will definitely be my gravy recipe from now on.

So incredibly good! I ground up some vegetarian breakfast sausage patties and added it to the finished gravy. My house full of boys/men loved it on my scratch made biscuits!

I created an account on Allrecipes just so I could give this five stars. Woke up with a craving for biscuits and gravy but didnâ€™t have sausage. You can make this with all the items you already have! Followed it exactly and it was just what I needed in my life.
