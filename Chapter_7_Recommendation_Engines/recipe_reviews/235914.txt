This was fast and simple to make, and really had a much better flavor than I expected!  I was worried the meat would be too sweet, but it was just fine.  I used paprika in place of chipotle (noted in the ingredients as an alternative).  For my pico, I chopped up some Roma tomatoes, then threw in fresh cilantro, little onion powder, and a dash of salt.  We really liked the addition of romaine lettuce for good crunch.  The only thing I would do differently is use flour tortillas instead of corn, because my husband said he found the corn tortillas to be a little to dry for his taste.

I loved this recipe, but I changed the tortillas to flour and I added some cilantro.  My roommates tore it up!

Very good quick dinner.  Loved the smoky flavor with the sweetness of the corn tortillas.  Made it just as written, and it's a keeper!

Very delicious! Squeezed some fresh lime juice over the finished taco, and used some homemade hot sauce to add a bit of kick.  I also added two tsp Sriracha to the marinade.
