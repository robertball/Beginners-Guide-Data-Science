With macarons, is always better to go by weight rather than by volume. So, the recipe made me a bit nervous. It still worked out very well but that doesn't mean it will work the same way for everyone. My amounts and yours may vary slightly and with macarons, slight variations can result in less than optimal results. A few key steps that always help: Grind up the almond flour in your food processor to make it as fine as you can get it to ensure a smooth macaron, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry, fold in the almond flour/confectioner's sugar mixture very well but do not over do it or it will be too liquidy and your macarons will come out very flat, spread too much and look like amoebas rather than nice and round. Good luck! These are worth it!

Thanks for this recipe! It turned out great for me, I followed the metric measurements and weighed out my ingredients. I would suggest combining the almond and the confectioners sugar in the food processor to make it finer and give the cookies a smoother appearance. I made these with a few drops of peppermint oil in the batter, and filled them with min chocolate chip ganache. Delicious!

The first time I made it, it didn't go too well. The cakes are too small and it didn't cook well at 15 mins. The cake itself was "grainy" due to the almond flour. So I did a 2nd batch, modified the cooking time to 20-25 mins. The resting time to an 30 mins and sifted the confectioner's sugar and flour mix before I folded into the egg whites. And viola! My perfect macarons! Thank you for the great recipe, I will surely be making more of these!

I agree that weighing ingredients is much more precise and reliable, but I also know most people will not so i gave measurements.  I have definitely ground my almond floor to make it finer with a coffee grinder or food processor.   

Some of my favorite flavours are a chocolate macaron where i added dutch cocoa powder to the dry mixture and then made a chocolate ganache from Lindt Excellece orange intense chocolate bars.  I've also ground up pistachios in my coffee grinder and substituted them for the almond flour.  

I'm hoping to get some freeze dried raspberries and put them in the cookie part and a chocolate ganache center or a Blackforest using freeze dried cherries.

Using freeze dried allows you to add intense flavour without changing the consistancy of the macaron.

Macarons take a practice. It's worth it because the taste of home made macarons puts those fancy looking store bought pastries to shame! Over beating OR underbeating the meringue or dough leads to crazy looking shells. Make sure to let cookies rest after piping and before baking. Oven should be no higher than 300 or shells raise too fast.

First time I have made these, and it was easier than I thought. Used the recipe as written. Very tasty. Made a chocolate ganache as filling. Didn't get the feet on the first batch, but later batches sat longer before I put them in the oven, and they came out with the feet. also had to leave them in the oven longer than this recipe calls for. But all in all, a keeper recipe. I will make again. Made some on a mat that had little circles on them and those are perfectly round. The ones I made on parchment paper are a little oblong, but they all taste good!

The Macarons came out perfect! It was my first time making them. I used a silicone baking sheet and increased the baking time to 22 minutes.

This was my first time making these, followed the recipe exactly, even bought the macaron silpat with the circles template, and I did not get the frilly feet. My batter seemed loose and watery. I think I may have overbeat the egg whites. I will definitely try again.

Easy recipe! Did one batch on silpat - then followed another reviews advice w/ cupcake pan - that didn't work at all!! Paper would not come off and they baked weird! Added orange oil and filled w/ stabilized orange whipped cream awesome!

Oh wow! Do not be intimidated by the recipe - just go for it! I honestly didn't think I liked macarons. I had only had them from a box and from a reputable bakery. Those did not hold a candle to homemade! Some notes: I did not refrigerate my egg white overnight, I just separated my eggs and let them sit on the counter for 20 mins or so. I sifted the almond flour and confectioners sugar together. I used regular granulated sugar for the 'superfine' sugar. After letting the uncooked rounds sit for 15 minutes, they still didn't look dull, so I just went ahead and baked them. They did not spread much, if at all. I baked them on parchment paper and had no problem getting them off after they cooled on the sheet. (I did have trouble with the batch that I baked on a pizza stone (instead of cookie sheet) with parchment - they tore up coming off) We also ate them when cooled- without the step of refrigerating for 2 hours. However, they were better after being in the fridge overnight. I found them a little too sweet, but that is just preference. We added a little red coloring to make them pink and our filling was raspberry cream cheese icing. SO DELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe :)
Update: Made these again, as before, but added about 3 Tbs cocoa powder to the dry ingredients and brown color to the batter. Then for the filling I made peppermint chocolate ganache. Delicious again!!

I made no changes. I'm writing this review as they are baking, so I'm really scared to see if they will develop feet or not. I see so many Internet chefs making these without breaking a sweat, and they turn out wonderful. This, however, is my first time making macarons and I'm sort of terrible at piping, so all of them are different sizes. I think I'll put the bigger ones on the bottom. Thank you for submitting the recipe. It was very fun eating some of the batter from the pastry bag. I used a plastic bag instead

Thanks to Elle’s notes on weighing the ingredients vs. AllRecipes altered version- these turned out great for my first ever Macaron batch! (It’s been a goal to learn how to make these for about 10 years- this recipe was very helpful in me achieving that goal!!)

They turned out fantastic! It was my first time, so they were not perfect but I assume by the third or fourth try they would be pretty darn close to perfect. I used a raspberry buttercream frosting to fill them and they are delicious.

No changes needed for me. I followed the recipe closely and they came out awesome. I made them a light purple and filled them with raspberry preserve. Thanks for your recipe.

Not only did they crack and look ugly, they didn't even get the little "footing" at the edges and took waaaaaayyyy longer than 15 minutes to dry. The batter was also very runny, making it difficult to pipe the discs onto the baking sheet.
