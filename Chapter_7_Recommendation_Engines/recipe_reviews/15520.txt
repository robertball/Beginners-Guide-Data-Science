I am very dissapointed in this recipe, it overflowed and there was way too much filling for a 9 inch pie crust, also you didn't state when to add the beaten egg so I assumed to place it in the molasses mixture. Not a recipe I would use again!

I never had a shoofly pie before. Actually I never even heard about it.
The recipe sounded so strange to me, I never thought it will turn out to be something eatable.
But I love experimenting and tried it. Guess what! It turned out GREAT!
Next time I will add some cocoa to the filling!
Thanks!

I have not tried this recipe yet because I'm confused by the directions. In the intro it says the chips go on the bottom followed by the molasses filling and covered with another layer of chips and then the crumble mix. But in the directions, no mention is made of the second layer of chips.  I have given it 4 stars because it sounds delicious (and I had to rate it in order to get publish my question)and I will try it without the second layer of chips.

Great recipe, with a slight modification: 3/4 cup molasses, 1/4 cup raw honey; 3/4 small marshmallows for a dark & tan rocky-road, sticky chocolate bottomed shoofly pie.

This was by far the most delicious pie I have ever eaten! Thank you so much for this perfect recipe! It was the perfect amount of filling for a 9 inch pie. The gooey chocolate layer created by the chocolate chips was SO delectable. This was the perfect pie for our thanksgiving dinner.
