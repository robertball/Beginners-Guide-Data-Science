Read many of the reviews and concluded many may not have noticed that the cake mix called for was not likely what they used because they reported overflowing  or very underdone situations. Standard cake mixes come in 16.5 oz boxes - since recipe calls for 9 oz  mix, and my box of mix was 16.5 oz, I made two cakes. One can of sliced pineapple has 10 slices, so worked just fine. Use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsp butter or margarine per 9 inch pan. I melted the butter in each pan, mixed in the brown sugar. Bake time was only an extra 3 minutes so that is probably due to oven variance. I did use the juice from the pineapple instead of water in the mix as it only made sense to do so. Came out perfect!

I  used this recipe years ago. I use 6 tbsp butter for a richer flavor. Around the pineapple rings I place crushed pineapple that is well drained. A small 8 oz can will do it. I made a 9 x 13 cake so I had to bake it for 35 minutes until the cake tester came out clean.

I have made this several times now. You might give it more stars if you follow my advice. First, use fresh pineapple don't use canned pineapple, the difference is huge,the canned tastes " tin-ey". Next replace the water in the cake recipe with real pineapple juice. Replace the vegetable oil for coconut oil(liquefied). Also add your own high quality real vanilla extract to the batter. this will take your cake from good to great. I don't use marshino cherries,ick. You could use real cherries or just leave them out, it is still a pretty cake. A silicone bake pan makes it super easy. make sure you put it on a cookie sheet in the oven. Also it always takes me longer to bake then the stated time. Good Luck!

25-30 minutes isn't nearly long enough to make this cake. I took it out of the oven at the stated time and it was jiggling like jello. Having faith in this recipe, I proceeded to take it out of the pan after 5 minutes of cooling, and the cake fell apart. The center was completely uncooked. I won't be trying this recipe again. However, I believe if you keep it in the oven another 20 minutes, it would be fine.

Great recipe!  It does take at least 40 minutes to bake, give or take.  Instead of  water in the cake mix, I used the juice from the can of pineapple along with dark rum.  Delish!!

This is my go-to recipe for pineapple upside down cake. It always turns out wonderful. Little tip-  if you use a regular box of yellow cake mix, the bake time increases by at least 10 minutes.

Just how my Mom always made it as a kid. Simple no fuss and tastes great. I do bake according to cake mix directions, so a little longer than the recipe states. Good.

Works better with pineapple flavored cake mix.  Also, substitute water in cake mix with drained pineapple juice.  This way gives you a really rich taste of pineapple.

For those not smart enough to figure this out, this is a recipe from Dole, a producer of quality canned fruit. Recommending the use of fresh pineapple slices is rediculous. Go away.

Wonderful. I used twice the brown sugar and butter, along with 9oz cake mix and it worked great. Oven heat and time for my oven is a little different, but knowing your oven is the key.

Would be five stars, but the cook time is off. It needs at least ten more minutes. I used a nine inch cake pan as well, but the taste is great and it looks beautiful.

Modified for 9x13 pan with a full box of classic yellow cake mix (15.25 oz): 4 Tbls Margerine melted., about 3/4 c. brown sugar, (plus a little extra) used a 20 oz can of pineapple tidbits saving the juice which was just about 1 cup.  Made the cake mix as listed on box  (3 eggs & 1/3 c. oil) except used the pineapple juice in place of 1 c. water.  Baked for 25 minutes which was noted on box for the 9x13 pan.  Let set about 15 minutes before flipping pan over.  Then let that set upside down a few more minutes and then tapped the bottom of pan until it released.  Served slightly warm and family wanted seconds.  Turned out very moist and flavorful.

Good Golly MIss Molly !! I made this old family favorite following Dole's recipe. I used Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Cake Mix. It seemed to me, Duncan HInes recipe should be too liquid for cake mix what with a cup of water, a 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, and three eggs. 

Dole calls for 9 oz; my box was 16.5 oz. I think, per the box, it was supposed to be done in 28 mins at 350. It was not. It was like jello before I even bothered to stick it. I let it continue to cook. Unfortunately, I didn't time how long - I would check periodically, and when it seemed firm, and the cake looked nice, I stuck a stick in and it felt perfect with just a touch of slightly moist crumb sticking. 

I let it cool and left it overnight. It was the prettiest cake I've ever seen. And it was wonderful. Almost religiously wonderful. It was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner. it couldn't have been more fluffy, more moist, more yummy. 

The tough part: I'm not sure why?

Just like I remember my mom making. I made mine in a 9X13 pan and it worked out just fine. I turned it out onto my mom's heirloom silver tray. Wouldn't change a thing!

The cake turned out great. I ended up making a cake and three big cupcakes because there was too much batter for just the cake.  The cook time needs adjusted.  The cupcakes where done in 25 min but the cake took a good 35-40 min. I'll definitely make again. My husband loved it.

Very good cake, here's a way to make it BOOZY for holidays or New Years!
I made cake as directed but instead of water I used pineapple juice.
I also used real butter, not margarine. 
Yellow cake mix- use the buttery versions.
BOOZY: soak the cherries and pineapple in separate bowls overnight in dark RUM. (I used capt. morgan black).
Make as directed. Then after the cake has cooled, inject little spots here and there with rum (dont do too much as cake is already moist!)

I used the juice from the pineapple and added water  to make the required amount of water for the cake mix.  I chopped pecans and sprinkled over the pineapple and brown sugar before pouring the batter over the fruit.  Also, I baked it in a cast iron fry pan like my mom does. Almost as good as moms made from scratch pineapple upside down cake.

This was very tasty.  I would have preferred to have done it in a 9 x 13 pan. The cake was too high for the ratio of pineapple and cherries.  Everyone enjoyed it :-)

I used more of the butter and brown sugar because I thought it needed more. Most importantly I used the pineapple juice instead water, needing only to add a little water to add up to one cup as the cake mix instructed. I also baked it in an angel food pan using a toothpick to test to check if it was thoroughly baked. It was delicious! In the past I’ve always started the cake from scratch. This was so easy and looked beautiful!

I love this recipe.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used the pineapple juice from the can of pineapples instead of water and also used the Duncan Hines Super Moist cake mix.  It came out  delicious.  As others have mentioned, the cook time is longer than noted.  Everyone who has tried the cake loves it.

This is so easy and so good!! I was surprised at how quick and easy. I melt the butter in a Pyrex measuring cup (2 cups) and mix in the brown sugar. Then I mix the cake mix in a big measuring cup (6 cups?) and then just pour it over. Literally just two measuring cups and beaters to clean up! I've made the traditional round, but today used a 9x6 and I like that better.

I used one eight inch round pan and a box of Duncan yellow cake mix. I did make 6 additional cupcakes to finish off the batter. Here is what I did: I added pineapple juice with a splash of the cherry juice, vanilla. I also greased the pan with coconut oil, solid, and it added a nice flavor. I baked my cake at 300 degrees for longer so that the bottom would not burn. It took nearly an hour. YUM.Four stars because it did take rethinking.

Delicious! I didn't have the size box of cake mix the recipe called for so I used a regular sized box. I substituted the pineapple juice in the can of pineapples for most of the water and I didn't have maraschino cherries so I used blueberries. I doubled the amount of sugar and butter and baked the cake in a 13 by 9 inch pan for about 40 minutes. It turned out great and the blueberries where a pleasant surprise for everyone. It was quick, easy, and delicious!

Made last month & making again today! Probably shouldn't leave 5 stars when making a few changes but it was so good. Used pineapple tidbits, a white cake mix , egg whites only & the pineapple juice instead of water. Baked in a 10" cast iron skillet about 35 minutes. Flipped over & perfect.

I made two of these for Easter dinners we were attending. I usually like to bake from scratch, but used this recipe instead. The cake mix called for 1 cup of water, but I used 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice drained from the pineapple rings. It still didn't have a strong pineapple flavor. Next time I will substitute all pineapple juice for the water. Better yet, one of the cake mix makers has a signature collection which includes a pineapple supreme mix that I assume in meant for pineapple upside down cakes. I looked at it, but went with a regular yellow cake mix. All in all...it was a good recipe.

I’ve made this twice, once in the oven and once in a dutch over. It comes out absolutely delish!  The only change I make to this is to add a lot more brown sugar. I use about a cup to make the top gooey and more like a glaze. It’s my fiancé’s favorite dessert.

This was a good start but next time I will make more sauce before adding pineapple and cake mix. I made a Bundt with half pineapple sliced and had extra batter so I made some mini cakes and added some coconut. I think next time I will add more pineapple also. Meant to use the pineapple juice instead of water in the mix but forgot until I opened the can afterward.  Overall this is a good recipe. Not bad for my first time baking an upside down pineapple cake! It is really fast to make so would be great for a last minute dessert.

In case you have a problem finding 9 oz cake mix:
JIFFY makes 9 oz cake mix. Also, I found that if I pour in HALF of a regular 15.25 oz cake mix box batter, that did the trick. I used the left over for a couple of cupcakes.
ONE MORE TIP from my departed uncle the baker (in World War II, instead of giving him a rifle, they showed him to the bakery) when baking with electricity, back off 25 degrees from whatever the recipe calls for. Your cake will come out better that way.  Always works for me. (Also works on pizza as well.)

Perfect just the way it is. I double up the brown sugar and butter as I use a 13×9 for this recipe which needs an increased bake time of 35-40 mins total.

I did the same thing as other reviewers, made 2 cakes.  I used a 9 inch non stick cake pan and a 9 inch square glass pan. I doubled the brown sugar/butter mix and put it in each pan.   Then split the cake mix.  The cake pan took 30 minutes and the glass pan took 40 minutes to bake.  Turned out phenomenal.  This will be my go to recipe.

No changes were made. I used a 9" cake pan, and it was filled to the brim. After 31 minutes, I had to add an extra five, as the center was still very wet. After that, another five minutes were added, as the center was still raw batter. Another 6, and another as the center was still raw, and edges were overdone. Whoever invented this, certainly did not use an 8" pan with the full box of cake mix. What a waste. I could not even upload a pic because of the specs required.

I substituted butter for oil; the cake came out spongy and delicious. 
I used one round cake pan, so there was some batter left over; it was enough to make a thinner, but not-too-thin cake. No icing in the house! Tragic!

This was excellent!  I used regular size Box cake mix, 15oz. Substituted butter for oil and pineapple juice for water. Made 9" cake Pan and 6 to 7 square mini pineapple upside down cupcakes.  Baked cake for 33 minutes and cupcakes for 17 min. Used some fresh pineapple slices when I ran out of canned slices . Excellent!

Did not have any cherries and used pineapple juice instead of water and used olive oil as that's what I had on hand.  

Came mix was for one layer, so made two round pans and two boxes of mix.  Made using the substitutions listed above except I used eggs layer by my own chickens in one mix and my own ducks in the second.  Baked 45 minutes.

We made this tonight with the changes that M.a. Roarsmom said to make.  Oh holy cow M.a. thank you so much it was so delicious!! Family dinner night was tonight and all 12 people here were raving about this, with your changes!!  For the rest of you if you did not see her review she said to use liquid coconut oil instead of vege oil, fresh pineapple instead of canned, and pineapple juice instead of water or milk in the batter, and it takes longer to bake than they state, keep an eye on it. I also used dark sweet canned cherries in syrup instead of Maraschino Cherries and I NEVER use margarine just butter.  By the way I saw another recipe for this and it said to turn the cake upside down immediately after taking it from the oven and let the brown sugar drippings drip down the cake then take the pan off.   It tasted ridiculously wonderful.

Came out perfect!  I took other's advice and used the juice from the pineapple in lieu of water.  Cook time was perfect at 37 minutes.   Came out of pan perfectly.

This was the easiest cake to make. I am gluten free and dairy free so I used one of my cake mixes and almond milk. I also used some of the comments- pineapple in liquid and pecans with pineapple and cherries. Most delicious.

I followed the directions except used pineapple juice instead of water. Since I used a full 16oz box of cake mix and a 10” pan the cake took forever to bake- a little over an hour.

Easy and very good.  I used a 17 oz. cake mix, doubled the butter and brown sugar and baked it in a 9 x 13 baking pan.  I also used pineapple chunks instead of rings.

Made this yesterday for a bake sale and this is very good and easy to make but the baking time is way off.  I used a 9" round pan and still had to bake it an additional 25 minutes before it was done.  I also used the juice from the canned pineapple rings in the cake mix recipe and added just enough water to get it to the 1 cup that the box called for.  Other than that, followed the recipe as written.  Good taste and easy to make -- be sure to adjust your baking time or it will not be baked all the way through.

Had to leave my cake it a bit longer then required but turned out great! Maybe use a tad bit more brown sugar if you like that camalized textured top!

I used a bit more than half of the batter. It turned out great. Came out of the pan beautifully. Will definitely make it again.

Be warned, an 8' pan is NOT large enough if using a box of cake mix. I haven't tasted it yet, but that being said, it smells wonderful!

For some reason I thought this was going to be extremely difficult. However, this was super easy and tasty. And of course, I made a few modifications. I used a pineapple cake instead of a yellow cake, this make it slightly sweeter. I also changed the pineapple cherry design. I made my own pineapple design and then added cherries to more than just the center of the pineapple. I also used a 9x13 glass cake pan  instead of the 8x8 it called for. Cook time was the same and I had rave reviews from my co-workers at our potluck! So yummy!

It turned out very good but using one 8 inch for one cake mix is to much so I used two 8 inch cake pans and it turned out great 30 minutes.
