This was a tasty casserole.  Added peas to the soup/chicken mixture and a thin layer of cheddar cheese under the stuffing to make it an all-in-one meal.  My 5 year old cleaned the plate...peas and all!  Will be making this again.  Thanks!

I changed the recipe and used cream of mushroom instead of celery and added broccoli and mushrooms and Cheddar cheese. Delicious! Definitly will make again. Very simple.

You know, this isn't such a bad casserole.If you're tired and want something quick to make, this one is for you. And I highly recommend it if you have kids. I used a pre-cooked BBQ chicken from Safeway, one can of Marie Calendars Corn Bread Mix,and added Broccoli and one can of water with the Campbell's soup. This was a great way to get my two year old to eat his veggies. Happy Cooking.

Everyone liked this recipe. I changed a few things: used cubed cooked chicken, added shredded cheddar and broccoli spears (once I substituted a can of green beans-worked just as well), used cream of broccoli. Biggest change: spoon cornbread batter over all ingredients in baking dish. Cook until cornbread is golden brown and cassreole is heated through (about 20-25 minutes). Cornbread does not become dry or crumbly. Yummy and a fun way to serve an entire meal in one dish.

This was a really good caseerole. Very quick and easy. I added onions, mushrooms, a little butter and chicken broth. It is a recipe that you can add to without messing it up. Family ate it all up. Thanks Deann for the recipe.

I deviated from the recipe just a bit- used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. I also added a mix of frozen veggies and sprinkled a touch of shredded cheddar. Even my 4 year old ate it- veggies and all! You know you have a winner when a preschooler will ask for seconds!

Very simple, and light but still satisfying, I topped it with rated cheddar cheese and baked it covered with foil to seal in the moistness, good meal for a busy day.

We didn't care for this much.  The corn bread was very dry and there wasn't much flavor.  We like the Chicken Souiza Cornbread Bake submitted by Michele a lot better.

This was a good quick fix for left over chicken. I made a few changes mostly from other reader's suggestions. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery, added broccoli and Chedder cheese, and put the muffin mix straight on top before cooking. Quick and easy comfort food. Will definitely make again, especially when short on time.

It was pretty good. Next time I will crumble the cornbread instead of cooking it on the top because the cornbread was a little to sweet tasting for me. Other than it was really good.

I didn't use the cream of celery soup, because that just didn't seem to go with the recipe.  So, I took up some recommendations from the reviews and substituted it with cream of mushroom.  I also added a can of frozen mixed vegies.  It was a real good dish, which I'll make again.  However, I think I'll add another cream of chicken soup since it was close to being a bit dry, but wasn't.  With adding the extra can of cream of chicken soup, I might throw in another can of mixed vegies too to even it out.  This recipe is one you can experiement with, most sure.

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was put some cheddar cheese on top of the soup mixture and then poured the cornbread (Jiffy Mix) on top and baked it.

This is easy and great. Wife and grandkid loved it. I made a change to the recipe. I used a 2.5lbs bag of frozen chicken tenders and boiled them for 15mins before I shredded the chicken. I did this instead of using a whole chicken. This turned out great.

Easy recipe...I altered a bit by deleting chilis and adding carrots, green beans and mushrooms. I also used others suggestions of pouring the muffin mix right on top and added some cook time. My family always rates new recipes 1-5 and we gave it a four!

I am giving this four stars because I made a change...instead of cream of celery soup, we used cream of mushroom and added some red pepper flakes as well.  Good flavor, will make again.  Great comfort food!

My husband liked this a lot, but I found the flavor of the celery soup a little bit overbearing.  I sprinkled the chicken with paprika before cooking, and then seasoned the whole thing with some ground thyme and rosemary, black pepper and a little bit more paprika. I also threw in some broccoli for a one dish meal.  I halved the recipe, but kept the full amount of soup because other reviewers had said it was dry.  This way was perfect.

This was a quick & easy receipe.  I overcooked my muffin mix a little bit....next time I will watch this closer.  Overall for a cassarole type dinner it was a about a ****.  The veges added help.  I used frozen corn, carrotts, peas.

I like this a lot as a base casserole. I can't help it, I need veggies and some seasonings.  So any frozen veggie will work but we like mushrooms and peas or broccoli and cheese.  Good for a busy weeknight !

Both hubby and I felt the recipe was lacking something, but it was good enough to eat and good enough to try again. Next time I will pour the cornbread mixture over the top and add some cooking time. Also, I will add some mixed veggies and some spices.

My husband and I loved this!  I used a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken and added a can of mixed veggies and a can of green beans.  Otherwise, made it exactly as directed.  We'll definitely be adding this to our favorites collection.

This was ok...it just seemed to be missing something.  I used cream of mushroom instead of celery.  It was really easy to make.  It has potential, we'll make it again, just try adding different things.  Maybe cheese.

We were not big fans of this recipe. I made it as directed, however the soup gave the chicken mixture a bad taste. I know many people said they loved this recipe so I decided to try it. The corn bread was the best part, however I didn't even finish that. If you like casseroles you may like this recipe.

Easy to make.  I used a suggestion from another reviewer of placing the cornbread batter on top to save a step.  I also added some canned peas & carrots.

I really liked this and so did my kids.  I would suggest drizzling a little melted butter on top before baking to keep the cornbread moist.  Adding vegetables to the chicken mix would also be excellent.

Very good! I added seasoned salt and onion and garlc powder for a little more "zing," also added half a pound of mixed veggies to make it a one-dish meal. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I just spread the unbaked cornbread batter on top as the baking time between this recipe and the recipe on the cornbread mix was comparable. In the future I think I would also make my own cornbread batter as the mix I used was gritty. I've served this twice in the past two weeks (I didn't get to taste it the first time around) and both times it has disappeared, much of it into the tummy of my two-year-old! Can't complain about that! This would also make a good filling for a quick and easy pot pie.

Tastes great!!  For the male college students out there (like myself)...the recipe has a 30 minute prep. time AFTER the chicken is cooked (you do need to cook it before putting it in the casserole dish, or so I was told).  I was stuck with a mini George Forman and 4 lbs. worth of chicken breasts...and 30 minutes became an hour and a half...  Cream of mushroom soup may also be pretty good in this but I haven't tried it.

This recipe was delicious - however I modified quite a bit.  I added chopped sauteed onion and celery + 1/2 tsp basil + 2 tsp parsely flakes, and about a tsp of minced garlic.  I sauteed all of that together and then added the cooked chicken and soup.  I also drizzled about 1/2 can of chicken broth (abt 5 oz) over the casserole and cornbread right before baking.  It is delicious!!

I made this using one can of cream of chicken and one can of broccoli & cheese soup.  I added about 2 cups of steamed, chopped broccoli.  It was pretty good, and we will probably have it again.

Good as a starting point. I did see that it would be too bland for our taste so I Added fresh broccoli that I boiled for a 7 min. Also added elbow macaroni to stretch the meal and to the cornbread mix I added 2 tbls sour cream and spooned over filling and cooked for 30 min. I seasoned the chicken with paul prudhomme black fish seasoning, garlic and onion powder and used low sodium soup. Thanks, Theresa

I give this ** because after reading all the reviews I only used the recipe as a base and added a lot of seasonings and onion.  With several reviews saying the cornbread was so dry, I just put the chicken mixture in the bottom of the pan then just spooned the unbaked corn muffin batter on top.  It turned out pretty good and the cornbread was not dry at all.

I am not a good cook, but I have to say this is one of the best things I have ever made.  It was very easy to prepare and cook.  I added fresh broccoli and frozen peas but left everything else unchanged.  Even my husband who has suffered through 27 years of my cooking was surprised!  :)

This was pretty good.  I added some garlic and onion powder to the chicken soup mixture.  The cornbread topping was lacking in color so I sprinkled it with paprika and dried parsley flakes.  I think this would be good with stove top stuffing on top instead of cornbread.

This is a great recipe that is very versatile!  I often use my leftover chicken from a different meal and saute with onions and celery.  Add whatever vegetable I have on hand.  I first made it in March and we have it about once a month now.  Each time I make it, I vary it a bit and it always tastes great!

I didn't realize that I didn't have the Cream of Chicken when I was ready to make this dish, so I substituted with Cream of Mushroom and it turned out to be a big hit with the family.  There were no left overs what so ever after dinner! Everyone came back for seconds.  Definitely will be making this again...

Saw the recipe and thought i would try it, misread at first and didn't bake the cornbread as it said in the recipe. Instead I poured over the top and baked @ 350 for the first 10 minutes then @ 400 for the remainder of the 30 minutes and low and behold turned out pretty good.My better half said that it seem kind of gritty but what the hey, maybe 5 or 10 more minutes might have helped. 
Would recomend for a quick meal.

To go from super easy, to no effort at all, I used an already baked chicken from the store.Then, melted Monteray Jack Cheese into the soup and added Rotel.  I am now convenced that Rotel and cornbread where made for each other!  They did each other right in this dish!! I will make this as often as I can without my husband getting sick of it! He's not as much of a casserole freak as I am.  IKR!? That's just wrong!!

This has become a favorite staple in our house!  I just use a couple chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and like others have recommended we pour the cornbread batter directly on top of the casserole to bake with it instead of baking it separate and crumbling it on.  We also add whatever veggies we have on-hand, for more flavor and texture.
