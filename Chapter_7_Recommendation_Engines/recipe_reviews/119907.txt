My mom handed down this family favorite also.  I cook in a different order though.  I saute onions, garlic, and green pepper until soft.  Add a full package of hot dogs and saute until brown.  Then I add the stewed tomatoes and ketchup and cook for 20 minutes.  I add pre-cooked rice (1.5 cups) last.  Also, I scatter shredded cheddar on top, put the cover on melt, and serve right out of the pot.

This is very good and inexpensive, however, i did make some changes, added garlic and Worcestershire sauce to taste. Additionally I used the entire package of dogs.  Also, I perfer this from a cast iron skillet it gives it a better flavor.

This is like a economical version of jambalaya; but that isn't a bad thing. It's convenient because it uses ingredients that are on hand. I used minute rice though, because that's all I had on hand so my cooking time was considerably less. For a quick lunch, this fit the bill. Thanks for the recipe.

This rates "average" for us, as it was certainly inexpensive and simple to make.  However, we really didn't care for the taste.  I won't make it again.

It was a good and easy recipe to follow, but needed a bit more spices for my taste. I added some chicken soup mix, salt, pepper and garlic.

I thought this recipe was great!  Great taste, easy to make, cheap, etc.  I doubled the onion and green pepper.

The only problem I had with it is the water.  I used two cups of water to cook the rice (instead of 1 1/4), then added the 1/4 cup later as directed.  You can't cook a cup of rice with 1 1/4 cups of water.

This is a generic jambalaya. I used instant rice that i cooked seperatley and added at the end. I always use diced tomatoes never stewed.

It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Very bland. I added garlic and worchestershire like suggested. I dunno...it tasted too tomato-y. We picked all the hot dogs out. lol

this was just okay.  it's definitely good that the ingredients are ones i typically have on hand; however, i think the ketchup was too sweet, and overall the dish didn't have enough flavor.  i added a little salt and pepper, but it would be better if you added some more spices and/or maybe beef broth.  it could be a good starter recipe though, and i may try it again with some additions.

i needed something on the fly to feed alot of people on short notice and this fit perfectly. i did chop my stewed tomatoes coarsly and i added franks red hot, garlic, salt and pepper. i served this with green beans, buttered bread and sliced cucmbers with lemon. i never thought id give a hot dog recipe five stars but this hits alot of high notes- kid friendly, makes alot and isnt expensive to make.

This was a good starter recipe.  One of the other reviewers mentioned that it was like jambalaya so I added to it to give it a little more of the jambalaya flavor.  I added minced garlic to the vegtetables and I added cayenne, alspice, cumin and a bay leaf and put all the water and tomatos in at once and simmered it until the rice was tender.  I found that it needed more than the 1 1/2 cups of water called for.  I probably added another cup during cooking to keep it moist.

We really enjoyed it and will probably make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

this seems to be a very kid friendly, economical, and quick dinner. since we dont have kids i decided to spice it up to suit our tastes. i fried up the hot dogs, veggies, and garlic in bacon grease. i added worcestershire, lemon juice and cajun seasoning w/ the toms. the ketchup flavor was a bit strong for us so i masked it w/ some louisianna hot sauce at the end. even though i changed this quite a bit i am still giving it 4 stars for a unique way to use hot dogs. i would never have thought to use them in something like this. thank you. if i make this again i will leave out the ketchup entirely.

I use almost the same recipe. Very Good!!! I dont add chili and hotdogs until after the rice is done. And I add toppings also. Cheese, pickle relish, onions.

Not a bad recipe WITH some doctoring up, , as it was getting close to being done I test-tasted it and it seemed pretty bland so what I did was I transferred it to a baking dish and placed cheese on top and baked it till the cheese was melted. It was much better then.  If I was to make it again I would probably add some worshtershire sauce and maybe some different seasonings also.

It was very good! Very easy and quick. 
I used the polish sausage instead of hot dogs though. 
Will do it again!!!! Thank you for the recipe.
