This was a good salad, we really like the Parmesan shreds, I made it 2 nights in a row, the first night with baked Parmesan chicken nuggets and the second with Buffalo drumsticks, instead of the BBQ chicken because we were having horrible weather. #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA #EndWithAmazing

This is a great way to use up leftover chicken. I placed the lettuce and dressing in a large bowl and tossed all till combined. From there portioned onto plates and placed a sliced grilled Chicken breast on top. Sprinkled with a little more cheese and homemade croutons.
Definitely a very simple recipe.. But sometimes you need that inspiration for dinner or lunch! My only suggestion is to use your favourite Caesar dressing whether it be homemade or a not.. As that really will make or break the dish.

We love a good caesar salad and eat it often. The ratio of lettuce to dressing was perfect. I used home made croutons that I seasoned simply with garlic powder, okive oil and parsley before baking. The chicken was seasoned with Italian seasoning to complement the salad. In the future I will add green onions and perhaps a little crumbled bacon.  #Ad #EndWithAmazing #AllrecipesAllstarsCA

I don't usually like caesar salad but thoroughly enjoyed this salad.  When cooking the chicken, I sprinkled an additional bit of Parmesan cheese.  Delicious and filling. #EndWithAmazing #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA
