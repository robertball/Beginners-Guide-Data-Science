I followed the recipe with the exception of the slow cooker.  Instead, I baked in the oven at 350 degrees WITH the remaining marinade for about an hour or until tender.  DELICIOUS - the marinade flavor stayed in the meat and was really good.  Spoon the drippings over the meat.  Will make again.

These are very tasty and the meat was tender. A few of the ribs had bones and they were much juicier and better than the boneless. Typical of most slow cooking a lot of liquid/fat was released into the cooking liquid so it didn't have the strong Asian flavor of the beginning marinade and was actually rather thin and boring. Since I like to serve some the liquid over the meat or with rice, noodles, etc. I think next time I will make extra marinade to set aside and add it near the end to about 1/4 of the cooking liquid.

Very tender and delicious. I marinated overnight, but instead of discarding the marinade I just cooked it with it. Very good just the right amount of heat for those that can't handle a lot of heat. THe only change I made was to use a little less sesame oil because I don't like it as much and used garlic and ginger powder. YUMMMY!!

This is similar to a popular Korean food called Kalbi, but Kalbi is made with beef, so I think this marinade will work with beef, like round steak.  I didn't have lime juice so used lemon instead, and I didn't have Sriracha sauce so I used 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes.  I marinaded for only 3 hours and then cooked in the oven at 350 for 1 hours (I didn't know I had to marinade it until I was getting to make it for today).  It was delicious!  My daughter, who just turned two, asked for more after she finished her plate.  It probably could have been marinaded a bit longer, but I put leftover marinade juice on the meat (I should also note that I only used 3 boneless meat for the entire marinade).  The meat was still tender (not like crock pot tender but tender enough), but  I thought it was a little salty so I'll use less soy sauce next time.  Overall, it was fabulous!

We loved this!!!  I made a couple changes due to other comments.  Added 1/4 cup of honey extra due to the comments  and  help balance the saltiness.  Didnt have fresh ginger so used ground ginger powder and crushed red pepper (didnt have or know what Sriracha hot pepper sauce)and only used all olive oil--didnt have sesame oil.  But we LOVED IT!!  and will definitly make again!!  Cooked on low for 7 hours and it was just falling apart!  Made veggie fried rice to go with and the sauce blended with it and made it that much better!  Going to try with chuck roast!

I really loved this recipe - the flavor and ease of preparation make it a favorite.  The second time I made it I switched recipe amounts of olive oil and sesame oil just because the sesame oil seemed a little bit strong the first time around.  I also had to decrease the cooking time by an hour, and that actually worked better for my slow cooker.  These are so yummy, I found myself eating them cold right out of the fridge the next day!  I served them with rice and roasted asparagus.

My husband LOVED this, and he is very hard to please, especially when it comes to Asian fare.  He is Filipino, and the son of a professional chef, so there you go :)  Oh, and I had to substitute 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for the hot sauce because I didn't know what that was!

This was extremely delicious.  The best rib recipe I've tasted.  I did make a few changes but the flavor is exquisite.  I used bone-in ribs, added five spice powder, substituted red pepper flakes, and then baked them at 330 degrees for 1 1/2 hours in their marinade. Just before baking, I added a couple tablespoons of tomato sauce.  I served it with coconut rice and ceasar salad.  Good cookin', Aliskill!

YUM!  My family so very rarely eats meat that when we do, it has to be stellar- and these were! They were SO EASY.  I used bone-in ribs, and after cooking in the slow cooker (for only 5 hours) the meat slipped right off the bone.  I made a second batch of the marinade sauce to soak the cooked shredded meat in while setting the table, then drained off the excess and served over rice and bok choy.  Highly, highly recommend the post-cooking marinade if you love strong asian flavors.  My chinese mother-in-law was full of compliments.....SCORE!!!!!

The flavor was good...a bit to salty for my taste.  The meat ended up being quite dry even though I left some of the marinade in the crock pot.  Probably would cook again but use less soy sauce or low sodium soy sauce and not cook as long.

YUM!!!!  Only 4 stars bc I slightly changed measurements in recipe...Proper combination is key.. this ribs recipe needs to be balanced with something on the sweet side.  Cook this in its marinade- mine was perfectly tender after 6hrs.  Only used 1Tbsp fresh grated Ginger. Didnt have Sriracha sauce (you can find it though at any Asian Store).  Steamed up some broccoli. Served with "Asian Coconut Rice" by Silvrezs on this site.  Drizzled sauce/meat on top of broccoli and rice- AWESOME!! *** ONLY DRIZZLE VERY MINIMAL sauce-- in fact, the drippings from the meat will be sufficient *** Too much sauce will overpower and be too salty!!! reminds me of eating in the tropics!

I liked these ribs and ate them with brown rice. It was nice because the ribs were on the salty side (even though I used low sodium soy sauce) and the rice helped to balance this out. I think next time I might use a little less low sodium soy and add a tiny more sugar, crushed red pepper flakes and more Sriracha sauce.

Amazing marinade, good for chops, chicken etc ... Unfortunately, I thought for all the wonderful flavor that went into the marinade, that most of it cooked off during the 8-9 hours in the crockpot, and I was left with some fairly bland ribs. 5-stars for the marinade, 4-stars for the recipe. And 6-stars for anything that calls for Sriracha, my family's favorite go-to condiment!

Great tenderness.  I followed the suggestion of putting 1/2 the marrinade in the slow cooker w/ the ribs.  This gave me a very salty final product.  I think it could use more ginger, more lime juice, less soy sauce (maybe 2/3 low sodium) then try again.

Made two freezer meals with this adding all ingredients in the two bags and freezing with instructions to thaw and cook on high in crock pot for 4 hours. Thanks! In the end we thought this was salty, we served it over rice with vegetables. Thanks!

We decided to grill these instead of using the slow cooker so I simmered my ribs in water for about 45 minutes and then marinated them for several hours. I used low sodium soy sauce and just because I had it in the fridge, I added Hoisin Sauce to the mix. These were delicious and everyone loved them. Thank you!

Loved the rich complex flavor! A little too salty so I'd reduce the soy sauce & increase the brown sugar and rice vinegar next time.

Really tasty but very very greasy.  I refrigerated it overnight, scraped off the fat, and then rewarmed the whole crock pot.  It was terrific!

Very nice recipe.  I too cooked the ribs in the marinade and used baby back ribs instead of country style.  Very good flavor.  I also made the Japanese style rice and stir fry veggies - it made a great dinner.

Terrific!  I had 5 1/2 pounds of country ribs and it was plenty of marinade.  I used lower-sodium soy and drained the marinade and the drippings after cooking, so it wasn't too salty.  I did use a tablespoon of Sriracha and it still wasn't spicy, just good.  Otherwise, recipe as is!

We loved these! Rather than marinade them we threw everything in the slow cooker all at one and cooker them for 7 hours. I also use bone in and we ate them the traditional way rather than shred them. Great way to make country ribs a baby back consistency!

These were really good.  I made them twice before I reviewed them.  I made it as is, and I thought it needed something.  The second time I added 1/4 cup of hoisin sauce, and it helped make them perfect!

I cooked withh the sauce instead of discarding it. It made the meat very juicy and bursting with flavor. Definitely a new Asian favorite!

My family loved this and I have picky eaters. I did however add some water cuz I was worried it would be to salty from the soy sauce. It was perfect, browned on outside and tender then on inside an white and mildly marined on inside.

I followed this recipe exactly as shown.  Nine hours was way to long to cook, mine cooked on low for 7 and 1/2 hours and they were more than done.  Very salty and tough, they did pull apart nicely, however very chewy.  My girlfriend loved them, however I am not a big pork fan myself, so I wasn't impressed.  I paired this with some jasmine rice with an asian blend of vegetables on top.  They seemed to go together nicely - however I do not think I will make this for myself again.

I live on the East Coast and made this dish a few months ago when we had back-to-back blizzards.  Boy was it perfect!  Made a lot for 1 person so I was able to eat off of it for a while.  I only rated it a four because some of the ingredients are a little too troublesome/expensive to bother buying for just this dish but if I didn't have them on hand, substitutions or just leaving them out still made for delicious flavor.  I had also read ahead of time that people wanted some marinade to pour over the finished ribs so after I let the ribs marinate overnight, I added just the ribs to the crockpot to cook and reserved the leftover marinade.  Right before serving, in a small saucepan, I heated up the marinade to boiling to kill off any bacteria and thicken a bit.  Was awesome with some white rice and green beans.  Will definitely make again.

This was a very tasty way to prepare "ribs". The Asian flavors were there, without being too over the top. I must admit I used the ingredient list as a guideline. Having read the reviews I, used less soy and sesame oil. I added all the ingredients to a large zippy bag. Mixed them up and adjusted to suit my families taste. Probably more like two tablespoons of Saracha! Lots more garlic and ginger. Popped the ribs in and to the fridge they went. Ribs were bone in and no way were they all going to fit in my slow cooker. Soaked them in marinade for 24 hours, them put them in two 9x13 glass pans, covered with marinade, covered in foil, 325 oven for 1.5 hours, then uncovered and reduced oven to 250 for 30 min. Fab aroma!  Next meal, just skimmed off the fat, replaced the foil and reheated in a low oven for an hour. Even better the second time. Only change I will make, I will cook down marinade while pork is resting to make a thick sauce to serve with ribs. Served with an Asian style slaw, perfect! Thanks for the inspiration.

this was really delicious. the only changes i made were using 1 TBS sriracha sauce (you can find this is the international section of any grocery store) as other reviewers suggested, 1/4 total of oil - i didn't have enough sesame so just made up the difference with olive – and cooking the ribs in the marinade - i like a little gravy on my rice. the gravy was a little oily, which i don't blame the recipe for since it called for discarding the marinade. i think next time i may make a small side batch of marinade with maybe just a TBS of sesame oil for the gravy. i was so tempted to add the honey as other reviewers suggested, but wanted to be as true to the recipe as possible. i can only imagine that would make it even more tasty. but as is, delicious. my mouth is watering just writing about it...

Was fantastic so easy to cook in the slow cooker.  Saved the marinade and cooked in a sauce pan on simmer for about 10 min to use as a sauce.

As mentioned, the meat is very tender and falls off of the bone.  I used bone-in ribs which worked fine.  Since others said that they lost some of their flavor, I made a little extra sauce to put on before I served them, but I would use less soy sauce next time because of the salt.  Served them with pineapple fried rice.

We thought these ribs were AWESOME!  Only had 1/4 C soy sauce, and powdered ginger -- cooked on high in croc for 8 hrs. -- refrigerated -- skimmed off fat -- broiled in oven until dark and charred (you know -- like they would be on the grill) and they are so yummy dipped in hoisen sauce!  Can't imagine why anyone wouldn't love these ribs!

I made this with boneless chicken breasts, did not dump the sauce, and shredded the chicken in the crock pot once cooked. I added extra brown sugar to this and cut down on the soy sauce, as it was very salty. Bought some BC bourbon chicken sauce from Publix and it was DELICIOUS. 5 stars with these tweaks.

Marinated mine over night, and used low sodium soy, not bad, still a tad salty and might marinade longer to get more flavor. I would cut back some on the soy. I liked them better than my husband, but then again, he is finicky.  Meat was nice and tender but I bet on the grill would be the best!

4.5 Stars: I marinated overnight and baked these in the oven (350) for an hour covered, then uncoved for 30 minutes.  We thought they were very good.  My only complaint is they were a bit salty.

A solid 5 star recipe. Fixed as written except omitted the sesame oil and went with all olive oil. Marinated for about 8 hours and then baked in a 350 degree oven for an hour. Reduced the marinade on the stovetop for about 20 minutes and basted the meat with it, plus used the leftover sauce to pour over the meat and the rice side dish. A winner rib recipe!

I followed other reviews and switched the amounts of the oils.  Also used hot pepper sauce.  Was very salty, so next time - and there WILL be a next time - I would used reduced sodium soy sauce.  I thickened the sauce with some corn starch.  It was delicious.

I rated this recipe a few days ago and as I was writing, it occurred to me that this could make the most amazing moo shu pork.  So tonight I made it again, just as written (but again using only 1/2 the soy sauce called for in the recipe).   I did choose to cook the ribs in the marinade in the slow cooker.  Once cooked,  I then removed the ribs from the slow cooker and put them (in their marinade) in the fridge until dinner time.
   Hours later, I removed the fully cooked ribs from the refrigerator, drained them of the marinade, and put them on a very hot propane grill (charcoal may be even better)  where I allowed them to sear and get some char on the edges--just 4 or 5 minutes flipping them halfway through.  I let them rest 5 minutes to ensure that the heat distributed throughout the rib meat. 
  To plate, I simply broke a rib into chunks and placed it on a leaf of butter lettuce with a tablespoon of prepared basmati rice.  Holy smokes.  That's the best moo shu I have EVER had.  Even better if you add a bit of crunchy, vinegar-based cabbage slaw on top.

I had a package of Country Style Ribs that I needed to use .... I did a search and liked this recipe.
Since my package was smaller I halved the recipe for the sauce and elected to use it for use in a slow cooker instead of marinating it.
I put the ribs in, covered them with the sauce, added a bit of ground pepper and cooked them on low for about 7 hours. An hour before serving I put a can of rinsed/drained black beans in.
I would recommend this slight variation highly. I seldom rate a revised recipe but the sauce is the real winner here .... oh, and if you like spicy - double the Asian spicy garlic sauce.

After carefully reading all reviews, I tried this. As I was making the marinade, I could already tell things were wrong (taste tested as I added items). The marinade did not taste like lime or ginger so I ended up increasing it to 6 T lime juice and 5 T (minced "prepared" found in produce section) ginger. There was also not much vinegar flavor so I added 6 T rice vinegar (I really love a vinegar taste to shredded pork so I needed to taste it). I reduced the soy to 2/3 c to avoid it being too salty. And in the end I increased the brown sugar to 1/2 c due to the vinegar and lime being a bit sour. I left out the garlic, as our family doesn't care for it. So then I put in the meat and stuck it in the fridge to marinade. 4 hours into the marinading I realized I didn't plan dinner that night, so I decided I would go ahead and cook the ribs for dinner that night. After 1 more hour marinading, I stuck it on 6 hours on HIGH in my crock, marinade left in (bc I was sure they would dry out w/o it--very good decision BTW). After about 5.5 hours I checked them and they were done--almost dry but with the marinade they were great. Taste was FANTASTIC...only thing I would change is decreasing the sesame oil...not sure how much bc it was only SLIGHTLY overpowering...some said switching the olive and sesame but that's not the solution bc then you lose the sesame essence which is one of the biggest reasons it called ASIAN ribs...maybe just use a little over 1/8 c sesame? I will make this again!

This was one of the tastiest slow cooker recipe I used with pork. I enjoyed it, however most of the flavor did run out, and into the pot. Maybe I should have used that to drizzle over my rib?

We all loved this! I made this in half the quantities but that made no difference I'm sure.  I didn't slow cook it, didn't plan ahead properly - but baking it covered for an hour at 350 and everyone raved about it - very very good; didn't change much - used another type of hot sauce because I didn't have this kind, and I didn't have the right vinegar but read that apple cider vinegar would be an appropriate alternative. And I also took the advise of another review saying to swap the quantities on the oil which I agree that sesame oil is very strong - that was a good idea. It was so good!!

Amazing!  The only change I made was to use bone-in country style ribs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee.  They were falling off the bone tender and delicious.  I will make these again and again!

These ribs were so tender and just fell apart.  They made a lot of juice in the crock pot as they were cooking, but I think they subsequently lost some of their flavor.  I don't know if we would use this exact recipe again.  I served this with baked french fries and canned sweet peas.

We love soy sauce and sesame oil, so this was a delicious flavor for our family, but this would probably be too salty for the average person.

I prepared this recipe using London broil steak instead of pork ribs. The marinade was a perfect Asian flavor for the thin-sliced meat. I also boiled the remainder with cornstarch to make a sauce for the assorted sliced veggies & rice. Better than Chinese take-out.

It had a good flavor, but the ribs were a bit dry. We did not marinate overnight, so that might have been the reason. We will try again, with the overnight marinade

Ribs were tender, a bit salty so would decrease soy sauce (I used low sodium and still too salty). My husband really liked.

Very tender! For my hot ingredient I used tabisco sauce  and I was out of fresh garlic so I used garlic salt. Three ribs were more than enough for my husband and I.  A little salty so next time I'll make sure I have the garlic so I won't need the salt. This recipe is a keeper!

I made with the ingredients specified, except for using white vinegar because I didn't have rice vinegar on hand.  While it is tasty, it was much too salty for my taste.  Perhaps this was due to the type of soy sauce I used, but next time I'll use much less or use low sodium.  To cut the saltiness, I served it with white rice (unsalted).  Instead of cooking in the slow cooker, I cooked this for 22 minutes in my Instant Pot after marinating the meat for 4 hours in the refrigerator.

Yes and yes. I'll definitely make this again. I switched from slowcooker to Instant Pot pressure cooker so after marinating the ribs all day, I dropped them into the pressure cooker an hour before dinner and they cooked in just 40 minutes! Served them along with rice and Bangin' Brussels Sprouts (3 min in the Instant Pot). Not a drop left over after 4 adults finished. I'll double the batch next time.

I used bone in country style ribs, but made the sauce exactly as the recipe instructed.  I marinated the ribs overnight in a jumbo zip lock bag because I didn't want to put my large crock pot in the refrigerator.  The ribs were tender and I served them in chunks instead of shredding them with forks.  I thought they were a bit salty and not as flavorful as I had expected, so I'm only giving them 3 stars, though I might make them again.  I warmed some Chinese Sweet Chili Sauce and served that with them.  It added the sweetness that I thought the dish needed, though that might be too spicy hot for some tastes.

I love the versatility of this recipe.  Having almost forgotten about some ribs I had in my fridge, I was searching for a tasty/quick/easy way to prepare them. Since I didn't have time in one day to marinate them and then cook in the slow cooker, I followed another reviewer and decided to marinate them,  for about 7 hours, then roast them.  I substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice wine vinegar, garlic powder for fresh, and Braggs liquid aminos for the soy sauce.  I reserved about 1/3 the marinade to heat up and use as sauce later.  After marinating, I drained most of the marinade off because a lot of liquid collects in the pan, spread some large chunks of onion and red peppers  over the top, covered them with foil and roasted at about 375F for 45 minutes.  Took off the foil and cooked about 10 more minutes to bring up to 145F internal temp.  They were done perfectly. Served with jasmine rice and green salad with Asian flavors vinaigrette.  Will definitely try this in slow cooker for comparison.  Tip: lining roasting pan with foil makes clean up so much easier as these leave a greasy/sticky mess  .. as most yummy things do ;)
Thanks Aliskill!

Great recipe. Used bone-in country ribs for the extra flavor.  Slow cooker 9 hours with the marinade. Next time I will omit olive oil an only use sesame oil for the richer flavor. I served with jasmine coconut rice and will do these two together always. May even do this recpe for  Asian tacos, topped with a sour cream avocado sauce shredded cabbage slaw and more  srirachi YUM!!!

These turned out really good, though I did make some changes.  I used tamari instead of soy and cut it in half.  I marinated overnight, then baked the ribs in the marinade, covered, at 325 for about 1 hour 15 min.  I poured off the marinade into a skillet and reduced it a bit, then poured off the fat.  I turned up the oven to 450 and let the ribs brown for a few minutes.  I served with stir fry veggies and rice, spooning some sauce over everything.  Made a delicious rice bowl!

Too sweet.  I replaced the brown sugar with hoisin sauce and it had a more authentic Asian taste with just the right amount of sweetness.  I also retain half the marinade to keep ribs moist while cooking in the crockpot - makes  a nice sauce.  I usually serve them intact, not shredded for initial serving.  Shredded for leftovers.

I love these ribs. I usually make the marinade the night before and place it in the crock pot with the ribs the night before. The next morning,  I cook them in the crock pot all day on low (without draining the marinade) . I did not add the brown sugar (as I am on a sugar free diet). Instead I have  used sugar free honey or stevia sweetener to taste. I cook them until fork tender, and then drain all the liquid off. Often times I will make a sugar free  teriyaki sauce to serve with them, but this is optional. Leftovers are great in fried rice!

Delicious!! Only addition I made was adding a bit of  honey and a little extra ginger. Wasn't spicy at all, so the kids loved it. If I make it again for adults on,y I'll add some more siracha. As others suggested I baked in oven at 350 for about 1 hour 15 mins. Yummmmm. Will make again.

My husband (Filipino) walked into the house after work and started singing John Denver's Take Me Home Country Road...the aroma is beyond awesome and the taste was positively delicious.  Yes, I did make changes.  First of all, I increased the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup.  Sesame oil is potent and to not overpower the taste of the sauce, I waited until I had all the other ingredients added and then carefully, measured out the sesame oil.  It amounted to 1/8 cup and was perfect.  You could definitely tell the oil was there but it did not overpower.  I did not marinate the meat.  I made the sauce in my slow cooker and then put the ribs in on top and cooked them on high for 8 hours.  The meat fell off the bones.  There was enough leftover for hubby's lunch the following day.  Three people in his office asked for the recipe after he heated it up in the microwave!!  Awesome recipe, saved and looking forward to many repeats!!!

We will try this again but next time we will not drain the liquid before cooking and we will not cook for 9 hours.

Great recipe. I would also add less sesame oil and some brown sugar especially if you are not eating the ribs with rice or something else. It tended to run a bit too salty for me.

Good flavor, but just a wee bit salty from the soy sauce, and we even cut it back to half the amount.  Only used half the sesame oil and that was plenty for flavor, I thing it would be overpowering otherwise.  Used tabasco sauce for the Sriracha.  We baked it, covered, at 325 for about 1 1/2 hours and did not shred.  Tender and juicy.

I marinated and cooked as directed, the only difference was I added a small amount of honey as was suggested. This recipe was salty, dry.

I totally screwed this up, but I think it was to my advantage.  Instead of marinating overnight, I braised the ribs in the marinade mix, but added 1 cup of water to thin it out and then threw the ribs in the slow cooker.  Cooked for 2 hours on high, and then 3 on low.  The ribs are falling apart, just like they should be and delicious!

This was a super easy recipe and was delicious! I decreased the brown sugar by half. I used garlic salt and ginger powder as I didn't have fresh. The taste of the sesame oil and rice vinegar supported the Asian style so don't substitute those. I didn't drain the liquid before cooking as the liquid just made the meat more juicy. Next time I would add double the Siracha for more kick. Served in soft taco's with shredded cabbage, mayo/Siracha sauce, cilantro and lime juice (my husband could not stop talking about how good they were). A keeper recipe.

I've made BBQ ribs in the slow cooker dozens of times, they always turn out moist & delicious but I was looking for a change from BBQ. Used the ingredients exactly as written but we found them too salty, otherwise the flavor was okay, they were edible, but we didn't even want to have seconds, as if they wouldn't have been worth the mess and effort involved with eating ribs. They were also on the dry side, even though I cooked them with the marinade, & I only cooked them on low 8 hours instead of 9 (which I always do with BBQ ribs). I've never had with BBQ ribs come out dry, perhaps marinading 8 hours in salty soy sauce is what made them dry. I ended up picking off the meat & using it with other meats & veggies in fried rice.

I read the reviews but realized I did not have low sodium soy sauce.  The ribs came out way to salty, almost to the point of inedible.  Next time I would probably add just 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and add water and perhaps some water.

Pretty good, nice mild asian flavor. I made the marinade and then froze the ribs in ziplock bags soaking in it. Then thawed them in fridge on a day when I was ready to use. Put them in crockpot with all the marinade(for more flavor I was hoping)and cooked for about 8 hours on low. The ribs were tender although slightly dry - as all meat tends to get in the crock pot (for me at least). Flavor was nice and light - husband thought it was pretty good, though I was hoping for a bit more punch. Will probably use the marinade again but try to thicken it more like a glaze and use it in a different method

Too sweet and salty for our liking, and that was after I cut the brown sugar in half and didn't put in the full amount of soy sauce.

Wonderful!  Here is my quick adjustment. Forgot to marinade in fridge, so I made the marinade (a little less soy) and put into slow cooker with half-frozen boneless ribs.  Put on high for most of day(to make sure pork was done in time), then at the end changed to low and took out the pork, shredded it - Here is best part - threw out the marinade/juice in the slow cooker - made another batch of marinade and put over the shredded pork.  Put all back in slow cooker to heat up and my entire picky family LOVED it!  Served with rice and green beans.  So easy!! Oh, used red pepper flakes & ground ginger.

These were great!  I made a few modifications based on time and ingredients on hand.  I only marinated for 3 hours and I used a mixture of soy and teriyaki sauce, ground ginger instead of fresh, lemon juice instead of lime and no hot sauce and then cooked on high for about 5 hours.  I served it with sushi rice and broccoli and everyone loved it.

Although this smelled wonderful while it was cooking, I thought this was just ok.  Despite cooking it  less time in my slow cooker, the ribs were still dry.  I wound up using the marinade and making a pork stir fry with brown rice.   I probably won't make it again.

I did not have the sesame oil or the Sriracha hot pepper sauce.  I substituted the sesame oil with canola oil and added some sesame seeds.  I had some General Tso's dipping and grilling sauce so I used 1 TBS of that.  These were delicious! I will definitely make them again.

For something different, this was an excellent rib recipe.  I used the ingredients as listed, and marinated the ribs for about 8 hours.  Instead of baking in the oven, we removed the ribs from the marinade, and grilled them.  I then boiled the marinade for 5 minutes, using a little of it in stir-fried oriental vegetables, some as a topping over brown Basmati rice, and the rest as a dipping sauce for the ribs.   We really liked the recipe, but, when having the  pre-prepared (left-over) ribs, we both commented that they are good occasionally, but not as a substitute for our normal rib recipe.

I love all of the ingredients in this recipe and use them frequently, but my pork turned out dry,  almost crumbly. I will continue to use my current recipe. That you for your contribution, it was an obvious success for many people.

After 5 hours the ribs were burned and dry. Next time I would add some honey and cook in the oven. Truthfully, the marinade was pretty basic. The same effect can be achieved with Soy Vey or any other bottled Asian marinade.

We love this.  We are making more Asian recipes and I am liking some "heat" in my food.  Do not like slow cookers so did this in a 350  oven.  Kept the marinade to baste if needed.  One tip on the salt concerns.  I use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce since even lower salt soy sauce is too salty .  Will make again for sure.

Sweet although I only used 2 tbsp brown sugar. I will make this again without the sugar because overall the flavors are great.

I made it just as the recipe said.  My family loved it.  It was not too salty.  After 9 hours in my slow cooker, the pork just fell apart it was so tender.  I did keep the juices and those in my family who wanted added it to theirs.  I served it with fried rice.  Yum!  My youngest already said I have to make this again!

This was quite good! I did reduce the soy sauce to 3/4 cup & didn't see that I was supposed to marinate the ribs, so I put it all in the crock pot & let it cook for about 7 hours.  Next time I make it, I think I will increase the sriracha & then thicken the sauce to drizzle over the ribs.

I have to say, really disappointing.  With all the great ingredients I expected it to knock my socks off.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out really bland.  Won't try again.

I used bone in ribs.   More flavor then boneless.  Also baked them in the oven at 300 degrees for about 2 hours.   Delicious!

Great recipe. I don't marinate it overnight nor do I drain the marinade. Cook it with the marinade and use the leftover for rice. We make this a couple of times a month.

We liked it, but took the advice from the reviews to cook the ribs in the marinade.  We didn't find it too salty, but there is definitely the influence of  soya sauce on the taste which some might not like.  The ribs were a bit dry, but when served with the sauce and they were fine.  I will keep the recipe and make again.

I cooked them for almost 4 hrs on high removed the meat from the crock let it cool a while and put it on the gas grill for a few minutes with some of the marinade I has set aside, got the grill marks and served them without shredding with Asian Coconut Rice (recipes this site). Loved them I will make them again.

I made this tonight. My wife and I both loved it. I made it  with Low Sodium Soy Sauce (the only kind I use) and cook it for five hours in the slow cooker with the marinade, other than that I followed the recipe. It was Delicious...it made enough for three meals (only two of us) served it over brown rice (eat that at least twice a day). We can't wait for the leftovers.

Aloha

These are delicious!  I've made it twice now in the crock pot - once cooking it with the marinade and once without.  I found the meat had better flavor when cooked without the marinade, and the crock pot washed out most of the flavor in the juices anyway.  It's great with either boneless or bone-in country ribs.  You need to use low sodium soy sauce in the marinade, and take the time to remove all the fat when you shred the meat.  I like strong favors, so next time I will make a little more marinade - without the oil - simmer it to thicken and pour over the cooked meat just before serving.  Great topped with green onions.

During the slow cooker process much of the beginning flavor of the marinade got lost in all the meat juices. Disappointing as I marinated it for 24 hours, too. Not worth a repeat unfortunately.

Stayed pretty close to the original recipe.  Marinated overnight in the crock (ribs were mostly submerged and coated the rest of the way around), and cooked all day the following day (unintentionally going a few hours overtime) without discarding any marinade.  This extra time may have dried it out a little bit but it was so tender it wouldn't so much fall apart as simply explode the moment touched by a fork/utensil.  Reheating subsequent days didn't toughen it up too much, so long as the moisture was kept in.  I accidentally (multitasking) used several times too much spice and it wasn't a problem, came out flavorful but not at all painful.  Soy aminos (I use Braggs but probably any will do) in lieu of traditional soy sauce can help with the saltiness.  I thickened up the leftover juices/marinade combination using flour to make a gravy (unhealthy but delicious) which was good both for serving reheated ribs (keeps in moisture) and for flavoring rice as a side dish - it makes a LOT, still finding ways to use that up, but I don't like waste and I do like the flavor.  A good recipe made great by its resilience to human error, trivial prep, and negligible cleanup.

Yum yum yum… yum.
P.S. yum!
 I don't know how to cook but I thought this looked interesting. I accidentally mixed up the recipe by using 2 T of Sesame and 3/4 olive oil. Also didn't have Sriracha hot sauce so used sesame chili oil ( to make up for the fact I messed up the before mentioned). Didn't matter - it was delicious! Even better next day. Cant wait to make it again - this time with the right mix of ingredients! Thanks

First off, the sauce is amazing.  (We kept the sauce and served the ribs with wild rice.  The kids loved the sauce mixed into the rice.)  However, I took the suggestion from some of the reviews to cook these in the oven and that was a HUGE mistake.  The ribs were very tough and kind of tasteless even though I had marinated them overnight.  I think if I had done them in the crockpot, they would have been tender and I would have given the recipe 5 stars...so probably not the recipe's fault.  I'll try them again in a slow cooker.  Personally, I would NOT recommend baking them in the oven.

This was not a hit at my house. I decreased the soy sauce and it was still too salty. I also added more brown sugar and it still needed more.

Everyone liked it, from 6 and up.  The notation of 12 ribs is a little vague.  I used approximately 3.5 lbs. of boneless country style pork ribs.  I made changes as some have suggested...reduced soy sauce to 1/2 cup, reduced sesame oil to about 3-4 Tbsp. (all I had left!), added 1/4 water, added 1/4 cup honey and increased Sriracha to 2 Tbsp.  Also doubled the garlic and ginger.  Served with steamed carrots, edamame and rice.  I know it's not necessarily an authentic pairing but the kids ate heartily!  Will definitely make again.

Marinated during the day, followed another reviewer's advice and baked in the oven for 1.5 hours.  These were exceptional.  We used the reserve juices to make a glaze.  We had no Sriracha, so used chilli powder.  I can't believe how amazing, moist and fall-off-the-bone these were!

Terrific! Like others suggested, I switched the amounts of sesame oil and olive oil, added 1/4 cup honey, and made extra marinade to cook with the ribs.

This is in the regular rotation at our house. So good and easy. I have never drained the marinade though, I just flip the ribs over so both sides get soaked really well and then cook the ribs in the marinade. When you get home steam some rice, shred the pork and serve with the marinade as sauce. So easy and delicious! My guys love it every time.

Yum! The only thing I changed is I cooked it in the marinade.

Fall off the bone excellent I omitted the sesame oil because I didn't have it. I served it along side a version of the Oriental Edamame Salad which was also Yummy !

I thought they would have more flavor. The sauce smelt wonderful, but once cooked the ribs just didn't seem to have much flavor. They were moist and tender.

Lots of flavor! I also added honey to balance the saltiness of the soy sauce. Cut the sesame oil oil to 1-2 Tbsp. baked at 350 for an hour. Not as tender as the crock pot but still yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I've never had much like with ribs, I suppose that's why I'm not a fan but my husband picked some up on sale. I scaled the recipe back for 8 ribs but followed the directions to a "T". only change I'd make in the future is a touch less sesame oil, for personal taste. Other that the ribs were tender and flavorful.

Something my finicky hubby and kids will eat too.  After reading the reviews, I opted to cook on low heat, 275 degrees, in a dutch even, with all of the marinade. Making it for the second time, I made some small adjustments. I eliminated the olive oil all together and used half of the sesame oil; I found the first time around to be too oily for my taste. I doubled the sriracha but we tend to like things with a bit of a kick. I used low sodium soy sauce and used a combination of boneless and bone-in country style ribs.

I made this as written and it was easy and turned out tasty.  I marinated it overnight.  It was very tender and great over rice.  I served with a side of bok choy.

Loved this recipe! I served it over brown rice and stir fried vegies. I chose to leave out the ginger and did not marinade over night, and it still had great flavor.  It's a great change from the typical bbq sauce recipes.

This recipe was fabulous!  I bought 2 racks of ribs for my family of kids (my kids don't usually eat much) and there were only 4 ribs left.  Everyone loved it.

This was hands down an amazing recipe! I doubled the marinade because one recipe didn't seem like enough. I didn't have enough soy sauce to double that portion and we could still taste a hint of it. It probably cut down on the salty taste some others had commented on. I also did not drain the marinade. I served it with the Asian Coconut Rice recipe on this site and stir fried veggies! It's a dinner that has made it onto our monthly rotation!

These were top-notch!  I baked mine (bone in) uncovered at 325 F and they were perfect! I also didn't have that much soy so I used  a good prtion of teriyaki sauce (the watery kind) plus extra sriracha.  Definitely a keeper! A nice change from the BBQ'd sort.
