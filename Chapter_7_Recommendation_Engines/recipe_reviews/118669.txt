I was bored today so I made 4 different recipes for deviled eggs at the same time and had neighbors & friends do a taste test. This one was the UNANIMOUS WINNER. It is creamy and zesty, but not too much flavor for a deviled egg. The texture and taste are the best I have ever had, and several of the judges said the same thing. I highly recommend this recipe! The other recipes in my taste test were "Cajun Deviled Eggs" by Denyse, "Deviled Eggs II" by Mary Brotherton, and "Deviled Eggs" by Barbara. None of them came close.

10 Stars! These were made for Easter dinner, and honestly I wish I had made more.  Following the recipe, I boiled six eggs, and easily my crew could have eaten a dozen, but trying a new recipe you just never know...but, this one's worth doubling!  Here is what I did: I started with perfect boiled eggs (place eggs in pan with cold water and a bit of oil, bring to a boil and then turn off heat.  Cover, and let sit for 15 minutes for large eggs, 17 for extra large. Cool in ice water. You will never have a green egg yolk, and it will peel easily, promise!)  I followed the yolk recipe exactly, except for the salt per other reviews.  I salted to taste, about 1/8 tsp. Once the yolk mixture was stirred together, I "creamed" it by putting into a plastic baggie and squeezed the baggie to mix, (enlisting the help of nine year old son who had the most fun "smooshing" this mixture)! Then I cut off one corner of the baggie and piped the filling into the egg whites.  Beautiful presentation, smooth and creamy and YUMMY!  Not too sweet, as others have mentioned, with just the right amount of tart.  Top with paprika, and they will think you are the Deviled Egg Queen!  Can't wait for summer picnics with this one!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had to try this a few times until I got it to what I was looking for. I have a good relish/horseradish recipe - so I was wanting a good classic (creamy, sweet & tangy) recipe. For 12 eggs (heck, if you are going to do all of this work - you might as well make a bunch of them!) I used 1/2 cup regular mayonnaise, 1 tsp. ground mustard (instead of prepared), 2 tsp. sugar, 2 tsp. apple cider vinegar (instead of white), 1/8 tsp. salt, and paprika for garnish. Perfecto! Tip: the day before you make them, place the eggs on their side within the carton (carton lid will have to remain open) so that all of the yolks will center and make nice thick whites. Also, the older the eggs are - the easier they are to peel. Fresh eggs are the hardest to peel!

Delicious. The paparika gave it an extra kick. For easy prep, put the mixture into a plastic baggie & cut the end off, then squeeze into the egg.

These are great!  Made 3 dozen.  I used almost double the amount of mayo and halved salt due to other reviews.  FYI: the fresher your eggs, the harder they will be to peel!!  I salted my water because it's supposed to make peeling easier, didn't work! The sooner the "Use By" date is the better.

Deviled eggs are a classic!  I doubled the recipe because my husband can eat half a batch all my himself.  I left out the sugar, used light mayo, white wine vinegar and dijon mustard.  I added a dash of Frank's Red Hot and cut down on the salt. These came out very creamy and were gone in no time.

These were excellent deviled eggs. They seemed to soften up and "run" just a little bit after having not been out for too long. To combat this, I'd drain the water from a pickle relish if you use it and add a touch more mustard powder. Excellet flavor and ease!

I made this early this morning on a whim, they're sitting in the fridge right now. I cut back on the mayonnaise just a touch and added a heaping teaspoon of horseradish and little fresh ground pepper. I did NOT add the extra salt. NOTE: My husband found them. He says they're pretty good. He likes that they're not "frilly" like when I try to gussy up some of the other deviled eggs I've made in the past. Which is good. I don't expect them to last past ten. Which means I'll be making more, I'm sure.

Very good, a classic taste. This was yummy. Here's a tip for making deviled eggs: MAKE YOUR EGGS 1 DAY AHEAD. Boil them, put them in a cold water bath, then put them back in the fridge overnight. The next day they will peel perfectly, and you'll be able to use them all.

I'm so disappointed that I didn't read more reviews before I made this recipe. It was completely inedible, and a waste of eggs. Lesson learned...

These are now my go-to deviled eggs. They are requested at family gatherings. I like to rub it in with my mom, who used to be the go-to deviled egg lady. 

I've occasionally added a dash of worchestershire sauce and cut back a bit on the salt.

I've never measured my deviled egg ingredients before, but I was looking for a recipe to make it faster and easier and this fit the bill!  This was SO super easy, the amounts were perfect and didn't need to be adjusted at all!  My guests loved them, they were beautiful and gone so fast! Thanks for a perfect recipe- I've already passed it on!  Just a tip- I beat all the ingredients together with a hand beater/mixer, spooned it into a ziplock baggy and cut a corner off- voila!  I piped the filling into my eggs with no mess and super fast! **UPDATE** 4/12/09** These eggs were Requested of me at our Easter gathering at a friend's, and got RAVE reviews by everyone! Cheers!

Salty; way too salty. They simply resemble deviled eggs made with Miracle Whip, nothing more. Please, at the very least omit the salt if you try this. My husband and I will pretty much eat anything, so I'm really disapointed with these.

Good, a bit salty though. I personally prefer natural chicken eggs, they have much more flavor (or maybe I'm just use to them?) Plus you only need to boil them for 12 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

WAY too much salt and vinegar. Would taste better if both were cut in half. I had to add in a little bit of onion and an extra tbspn of mayo to try and cut the saltiness and tang.

I have a recipe I have always gone by for years. I wanted to try something different. I will for sure go back to my recipe. This recipe had too much salt. All of the ingredients were the same as mine except omit the salt and use 1/4 cup mayo. At family functions I'm always asked to bring deviled eggs. I always have to make a couple of platters per party. Luckily we raise chickens!

Ugh! Sorry, I really wanted to like these, but how frustrating the results were since I decided to follow the instructions exactly without a single deviation despite some mixed reviews, however they were TOO SALTY!!  Very disappointing, I made them tonight to bring to a potluck lunch tomorrow. Even so, while I did feel it necessary to post a negative comment, I still think the recipe is a very good start that simply needs tweaking, since the vinegar / sugar / mustard / mayo combo is a solid foundation to a perfect devilled egg, however next time I try these I will cut the salt in half & then some!

I had to try this one two times.  I wish I read the reviews prior to starting my first batch.  If I had, I would have reduced the salt significantly.  The first batch was inedible and had to be tossed.  For the second batch I only used 1/8 tsp salt and that was plenty. Good luck to those who try this one.

Great basic recipe. I cooked 10 eggs, and used 8 for deviled eggs. Then added 1/4 cup kraft mayo, 1 1/2 teaspoons regular mustard, teaspoon white vinegar, pinch of salt, and about 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, couple drops of lemon juice, and I didn't use the sugar. Instead used about 2 teaspoons of sweet relish (and squeezed out the liquid as much as I could from it). Then garnished with a little sprinkle of paprika. 
They turned out great! Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and agree that these were way too salty, had I not had so much salt I probably would have really loved them.

Really good even though it does not have the sweet salad cubes that we mostly associate with deviled eggs.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was great! I made them one day and the next day they were gone. I think my son was the culprit in that since he loves deviled eggs.

I have never made deviled eggs before and went up to allrecipies to look up a good recipe - not too strange w/ a ton of extras - as to not get to weird with the flavors. I saw this one and decided to try it since I had all the ingredients. I grew up using miracle whip and my husbands family always and only uses mayonnaise.  I figured the vinegar in this recipe will give it the lil zip that miracle whip does. I made it and OH MY GOODNESS is it delicious. The vinegar does not over power it. I would think if it does, then you added too much. This was a huge success and I will definitely be making it again.   The only substitute I used was Splenda instead of Sugar.

I thought these were great.  I made them for a pool party and everyone raved about them.  The only thing I "tweeked" was to add a little more mayo.  I thought the yolks looked a little dry, so I added about another 2 tablespoons.  Great recipe Margaret!

This is BY Far the best deviled egg recipe I have ever tasted, and I love deviled eggs.I also substituted Splenda for the sugar but not equally, check the splenda box for conversion rates, and it was great and sugar free!

Good flavour with tweaks, I scaled to 8 servings because I had 2 dozen eggs to use. The mayo amount wasn't enough, I had to add more, the sugar, vinegar and mustard were way too much, I scaled back to 1 tsp of each, added a sprinkle of salt not 2 tsps, a generous amount of pepper and some salt free Emeril's Essence I made, garnished with paprika.

TOO SALTY AS WRITTEN! I made just as written, and yuck. I mean I can see how it will be great, but for me, I will halve the salt, and halve the sugar... too sweet for me, too...but this is the type of recipe I was looking for... I will try again...they have pre cooked eggs at fresh n easy now. it makes it so fast.

This recipe was good but definitely had too much salt.  Went by other reviewers suggestion of cutting the salt to 1/4 tsp and that was too much as well.  Next time I made it with 1/8 tsp.  Hubby said it was perfect!

I only give this 3 stars bc it is WAY too much salt as is. I doubled this recipe and used about 1/8 teaspoon salt and it was perfect. If you make the recipe as is I can't imagine it being edible bc of the salt. I would say salt to taste but your going to use way closer to 1/8 teaspoon then a half teaspoon. Other than that the recipe is really good. I used white wine vinegar instead of regular and added some dill pickle relish bc I like a little crunch in my deviled eggs. Good recipe if you change the salt amount!

I had been craving deviled eggs for days and this is the first recipe that came up on google so I tried it and it was delicious.  I did use half dijon mustard and half regular, and used garlic salt to taste (about 1/4 tsp) instead of regular salt.  Also after starting to make them realized I didn't have any vinegar, so I used pickle juice.  They are amazingly creamy... also a tip I read on another review was after mashing to put it all in a sandwich bag, mush it up extra good, and cat a corner off and use it to fill them.  That made filling fast and so much less frustrating than spooning!!

I would have given this 5 stars, but gave it four because, per the other reviews, I had to half the salt. Once I did that however, these were PERFECTION!!! Absolutely delicious deviled eggs, and a huge crow-pleaser at our picnic. I can't tell you how many people asked for my recipe! Given the strengths  of different types of salt, I would say the recipe is fine as is if you're using sea salt or kosher salt. But, if you're using table salt, which is much denser, definitely be sure to half the salt amount! Thanks for this keeper!

This recipe produces the best deviled eggs I've ever had.  I've made them a few times now and each time I want to eat them all before I even have a chance to serve any of them.  I've even started using this recipe to create and egg salad that I could litterally sit and eat an entire bowl full with a spoon!

I made this for a Braai (South African BBQ) that we had for my boyfriends family. I have to say that I made a few different things and this was so delicious that they all disappeared. I thought the recipe was to simple but it is exactly what it needed to be. Creamy and tangy just delicious. Thank you

It was okay, but just average. Next time, I would leave out the salt.... way too much! My quest to find that perfect deviled egg, that my husband goes nuts over.... still under way. Thanks anyway!

Good eggs, but the texture was a little creamier than what we usually like.  Glad I read the reviews and used less salt than what the recipe called for.  Even with a dozen eggs, 1/4 tsp was still slightly salty.  The flavor was good, I liked the tanginess that the vinegar added.

Just ok...too salty and too mustard-y for my taste. Just add these two ingredients sparingly and add more to your taste as desired and the recipe will be fine. I will make these again, just less of these two ingredients.

As I was making this recipe I realized I'm out of white vinegar. I'm not sure if that affected the outcome but it seems the salt and mustard are overpowering.

These are wonderful!  This is the flavor I have longed for in deviled eggs.  The vingar makes them divine!  I did cut the salt in half.  1/2 tsp was a bit salty for me and I like salt.  I also used Splenda and light mayo.  They are addicting.  I have been making them every week.

I made two deviled egg recipes from this site today.  Both were good but this one took 2nd place to Bacon and Cheddar Deviled Eggs by American Egg Board which I gave 5 stars.  This is a real good traditional deviled egg I would just add less salt next time.

Made these for New Years Eve.  Was good, except I used light mayo to combat the calories a little--which impacted the flavor slightly.  Easy to make though, with ingredients most people have on hand

Very good recipe.  Not really sure if they tasted that much better than your usual mayo/mustard basic recipe, but they were yummy nonetheless.  I took it easy on the salt based on the negative reviews...glad I did.
11/25/15- used 9 eggs, adjusted mayo and mustard for extra eggs, followed all other ingredients.

An excellent recipe to use as a base, except that it is way too salty as written, which I suspect is a type.  I followed other reviewers' advice on this and found that 1/8 tsp salt is plenty for this recipe.  I also find the recipe a tad too sweet for my taste, but individual tastes vary tremendously and my wife thought it was perfect.   I would suggest using 1/2 tsp sugar, then taste test before piping into the egg whites.  You can always add more.  I like using horseradish mustard for this recipe.  Not hot, just deli horseradish mustard.  You wouldn't even know it was horseradish mustard if you weren't looking for it, but it adds nicely to the mix.

WAY too salty! I made this and followed the recipe and ruined the entire batch of 18 egg yolks and I'm pretty upset about it. Cut back the salt by at least half!

My "item" to bring at family get-togethers is ALWAYS Deviled Eggs so I'm constantly trying different ways to make them. This version is the one I have received the most feedback on...EVERYONE loved it! In a large family it is hard to please everyone but this version is hands-down their favorite!

I used half the sugar called for because I was nervous about it.  I ended up adding more mustard to cut the sweetness down.  The end result was good though.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. . .I wish I had taken heed to the reviews, this is WAY-Y-Y-Y too MUCH SALT!!!  They literally burned my tongue.  I will make these again, using about 1/4 tsp. salt, and I may skip the vinegar and just go back to using worcheshire sauce instead.  Sorry that I had to give this only 2 stars, but I thank you for the recipe, it's a very good starting point.

Delicious and EASY.  I only added a tablespoon of sweet relish, otherwise exactly as the recipe...EXCEPT for the salt...ADDED NO SALT, thanks to other reviewers.  THANKS to Busymomntx for how to cook the eggs!  Perfect!  First time I've ever got them just right.  Will definitely make again.

I've never made deviled eggs with sugar before and I found myself adding more and more vinegar (apple cider in this case) as I tasted the filling, I think to counteract the sugar, but maybe also because I used dry mustard (love the stuff!) in place of prepared mustard, which would have included a little vinegar.   I also halved the salt as others have recommended and think that is about right.

I don't understand how this recipe received so many positive reviews.  If you follow the original recipe, it results in an extremely salty deviled egg. I had to eat AND drink something immediately to get rid of the taste.

This was a great recipe. I added some crumbled up bacon pieces to mine. I left out the salt b/c the bacon has plenty of it. It was really good. I recommend adding the bacon.

We made 3 versions of deviled eggs-- this recipe, a garlic based one and a horseradish based one, and this recipe was the best of all 3 by far. We served them at a party and this recipe was gone first.  Delicious!!!

very simple and tasty although the texture of the eggs wasn't quite what i expected. rather than top with paprika, i used a bit of cayenne pepper and black pepper to give it some kick.

This was very good. I made it for my mom and sister and they polished off the plate in less then an hour! I omitted the paprika because we don't have any and used Dijon mustard for a spicy kick. It was a little runny, so maybe too much vinegar? Otherwise it was awesome.

They were really good, except if adjusting the serving size as I did, pay attention to the salt. I added the amount of salt that was recommended, and it was a tad too much. Try keeping the original 1/2 tsp, and add from there, if needed.

Excellent, TIP:  Put oil in your boiling water, you will never have trouble peeling eggs again!  Used red wine vinegar and dijon mustard instead, turned out great!  I agree watch the salt.

The best way to deal with the salt and vinegar flavors are to add a little more mayo and mustard and to have the completed eggs sit in the fridge overnight. The next day the vinegar flavor is not as overpowering. Since I found this recipe, everyone asks for me to bring these eggs to every dinner or party.

I agree these were a bit salty, but I added a bit more sugar and it evened out nicely. A great way to use up those extra Easter eggs.

I have been trying to make Deviled Eggs for years and for whatever reason they never turned out right...UNTIL NOW !! The only change that I would make would be the amount of salt.  I like salt but I think 1/2 tsp. was a bit too much.  I will definatly make these again.

They were entirely too salty the first go-round.  So I tried this recipe again and actually cut the salt down to about 1/8 tsp.  They turned out great!

I used farm raised eggs so they were difficult to peel, but the mixture was wonderfully creamy. Just the right mixture of sugar, vinegar and mustard gave it a great flavor.

Good easy recipe, especially when you make it all in a plastic baggie! I think a little extra mayo or liquid is a good addition, they're a little dry as made as the recipe states.

These were EXTREMELY delisious but they need some room to improve. I made a dozen eggs but all that i tasted, for the most part, was mayonase and mustard. it had a little salt taste... Otherwise im happy and so is my family!!

I just added a pinch of salt since some of the reviews said it was too salty. These were AMAZING. To be fair, I didn't measure anything so I don't know what the proportions are like following it exactly, but I tried to get it about right (I had no measuring tools). 
Perfect amount of zest and creaminess!

Ohmygoodness, deviled eggs are my faaave! And these did not let me down! I halved the recipe using just 3 eggs as I was wanting to find the perfect recipe first before making a whole batch...I think I found it with a couple tweaks (hence the 4 stars, with changes it's for sure a 5!) I would definitely recommend cutting down on the vinegar and the salt, otherwise these flavors were too strong. The first time I made I halved the salt and it was still too much. Halving again was perfect. I also used a scant 1/2 tsp (remember I halved recipe) and this helped offset the strong vinegar-y flavor. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly topping them off with a bit of pepper and paprika...and mmmm perfection! Thanks for a great deviled egg recipe; this one will for sure be my go-to!!! :)

I love this, my husband loved it also! It's very simple yet delicious. I opted out the vinegar as I don't like vinegar taste, and also topped with cooked shrimp, gave some nice taste to the creamy filling, yum!! Picture uploaded :)

Made these for the holiday and they were "extremely" salty. I would omit the salt or use just a pinch instead. Otherwise they had a lot of flavor.

I have not made these yet.  But I just spent 1/2 hour going over tons of reviews.  The most important point at least half the reviewers made is this: "it is way too salty".  Some suggested that the 1/2 teaspoon of salt may be a typo.  I'm going to try it with 1/8 t. salt as many suggested.  Read some reviews before you try the recipe, which basically sounds pretty good.  The "way too salty" comment sticks out like a sore thumb.

Yet another delicious recipe I've added to my recipe box.  My husband asked me to make deviled eggs for an appetizer for thanksgiving.  I'd never made them before so I turned to this.  I halved the salt and added a tablespoon of sweet relish- per other users recommendations.  I also added some dill and doubled the recipe.  ABSOLUTELY fabulous!  While I normally wouldn't rate it after changing the recipe (not a true evaluation of the original recipe), this is an amazing base recipe to start!   This will now be made at least monthly at our house.  We all like deviled eggs, so this will be kept on hand for an easy protein snack.  By the way, this is SO easy to do- it literally took maybe 30 minutes total; this includes cooking time.  I DO recommend the smoosh it all in a baggie trick; easy mixing and easy clean up that way.

I read all the reviews and wanted to try it but I'm sorry I really didnt like this recipe. I did everything accordingly and the taste was just to sweet and salty at the same time. Perhaps just not for my taste. Now im curious to see what the next reviewer thinks, I shall keep posted :/

I took the advice to use less salt, so i only used 1/4 tsp., still a bit too salty for me. It's very good and I'll make it again, using only a pinch of salt.

This is very close to how I make mine with exception of the vinegar. Instead, use pickle juice and dice up a little bit of pickle. Also I add a sprinkle of onion powder, season salt and garlic to mine. I do not use sugar at all. My husband says they are the best.

By far the best recipe I have tried for deviled eggs! I add 2 tbs of diced dill pickle for a little crunch, and always change up my mustard (half yellow/half deli) to whatever i have on hand.

the overall taste was good, just to salty, next time I will omit the salt all together.

I usually read the reviews first before trying a recipe, and much to my chagrin, this time I didn't. I whole-heartedly agree with the reviews that state this recipe is too salty - I followed the recipe exactly, and it was so salty it made me wince...and I LIKE salt! I'm really bummed now because I ruined a batch of eggs! :-(

I love this recipe. I've been searching for a deviled egg recipe that I would like. I do reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon instead of a half.

I used 8 eggs and followed the recipe servings for 3 to get the right measurements. Had to use red wine vinegar for the white vinegar, all I had. Awesome. So easy, perfect taste combo between sweet and savory. Will make these again.

SOOOO SALTY.  I doubled the recipe, used 12 eggs and 1 tsp salt.  We could barely eat them!  I'd advise cutting the salt on these in half if you make 'em.

I LOVE this recipe. I actually have used it to make potato salad. Instead of re-filling the egg halves, I chop up them up, add a little extra mayo, and mix it into my cubed potatoes with whatever else I feel like adding. It is so good!

These were absolutely delicious. As I doubled the recipe for 12 eggs, I found the mixture a bit salty & usually I love salty foods! Next time I won't double the salt; I'll start with the original 1/2 tsp and add if it needs it. Also, I used cider vinegar for extra tang. Yum!

Made these for our Memorial Day picnic. I always make the eggs on Easter with my recipe, but decided to give this one a whirl. I added a little more vinegar and mustard than was called for to make it a little "zippier". Also added a little more mayo for creaminess. Made 18 eggs, and they ran out fast! Was told they were delicious, and everyone wished I had made more. Will keep that in mind for the 4th of July picnic!

Delicious!  I love deviled eggs, but have never made them myself.  I recently had a relative bring some for a family party, but they weren't very good.  So I decided to find a good recipe so I could make them from now on.  Well, this one did not disappoint.  I ALWAYS read the reviews, and I'm glad I did in this case.  I doubled the recipe but only used 1/8 tsp. salt and a scant 1 tsp. sugar.  I also used cider vinegar instead of white--just my personal preferance.  YUM--just what I was looking for!  Flavorful with a nice tang from the vinegar and mustard.  No more disappointing deviled eggs at future family gatherings!

The salt is incredibly overwhelming. And when I made it again, I reduced the salt to 1/8 teaspoon, and it was still too salty and weird tasting. I'll never make this again.

Very good and simple! I forgot the sugar because I did the recipe off of the top of my head after I read it. My fault. It was a little salty (because of my error) but so delicious! Next time there will be no forgetting the sugar haha

I am by no means whatsoever a food snob, and my husband is a salt-a-holic, but these were horribly salty.  I had to throw away the whole batch that I made for Easter dinner.  So disappointing!  I recommend cutting the salt to NO MORE than 1/8 tsp.  Even better, let people salt them according to their individual taste after they are prepared.

These are almost perfect.  The only thing I had to adjust was the salt--I like salt, but the 1/2 tsp. was just too much so I reduced it to 1/4 tsp. (though it may depend on your mayo--some are saltier than others).  Other than that, an excellent and classic deviled egg recipe.

I just made these. I added relish to them, because they looked like something was missing. These are for a party were having tomorrow. These are easy to make and taste great! Infact I ran out of mayo got what it asked for. I needed a little more. Its 1am and no stores open. I added a tad more mustard instead. No problem. tastes no different.  these came out great.

This recipe is okay, too sweet for our tastes. I ended up adding an extra tablespoon of mustard to soften the sweetness. I wanted to try a new D-Egg recipe but I think I will stick with my good old stand-by.

My family are deviled-egg-holics!!! These were very creamy and I had read to be very careful with the salt as the recipe as-is can be too much for some, but I didn't feel the same. My sister-in-law said they were too sweet but she did end up eating lots! Everyone else loved them though.

Turned out very nice. A little on the salty side for me, I added extra mayo to try and tone it down. I might omit the salt next time.

Whoa!  I too, like other reviewers doubled the recipe and it ended up so so salty.  My husband volunteered to bring deviled eggs to a potluck tomorrow.  We had to throw these out.  I don't know what happened.

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving. First off, if you are not a pro at hard-boiling eggs, do it one at a time so you don't waste any eggs (we did 18). Secondly, DO NOT ADD VINEGAR and slowly add salt to taste. We followed the recipe to the T and did not care for it. I had to spoon out a small portion of the 'recipe version' and then started adding mayonnaise to try and get the vinegar and salt taste out. By the end, I was able to salvage them and only 6 out of 18 were eaten (out of a group that LOVES deviled eggs).

These are the best deviled eggs ever!! I do recommend reducing the amount of salt though, as this was too much salt and had I added the full amount it called for, they would have been waaay too salty.  Other than that, this is the best deviled egg recipe I have ever tried. Will not use another recipe ever again, this is a keeper!! Thanks Margaret!

WOW!  I made these two days before Thanksgiving to test the recipe.  They were so good I almost ate all of them!  I will be proud to serve these at Thanksgiving.  To add my own special touch I used Truffle Salt instead of regular salt and it was G-R-E-A-T!

Super recipe. Nothing added to discolor the yokes, so they are brilliant yellow and deliciously inviting. The touch of sugar is pleasant, and I just used a pinch of salt, simply because I've weaned myself off salt years ago. These were delicious, and because it is such a basic recipe all kinds of other things can be added to change the flavour. Some suggestions might be Horseradish, Cayenne, Wasabi, Worcestershire Sauce, Tabasco, curry powder. Any of those additions will cause the colour to change, so be careful.

At first I thought I must have mis-measured, but after double checking I realized I had not. This is too salty to eat at 1/2 tsp of salt.

These turned out great! And I have only tried the yolk mixture. I did double the recipe and used apple cider vinegar instead of white. Also used only 1/8 tsp of salt. Can't wait to serve these tomorrow! This will be my only Deviled Egg recipe!! Thanks

I didn't use 1/2 teaspoon of salt because of the reviews I had read, I just used probably 1/4 teaspoon, also, too much sugar for us.  Will stick with my old way of sweet relish, mayo, sprinkle of garlic salt and pinch of cayenne.

This recipe is delicious! I've always loved my mother's deviled eggs and I was afraid to even try to make some that would compare to her's. This is it! WATCH THE SALT CONTENT... the second time I made them I added a little too much salt. 1/8 tsp is plenty. Also I let them sit and then poured cold ice water over them and let them sit for 15 min as per other reviews. They peeled nicely. I hit them on the counter and then roll back and forth until the entire egg shell is broken up. Kind of like how you get a lemon or lime ready to squeeze.   I've made them twice... the first time I doubled the recipe and took them to a potluck. They were gone in minutes. Quick, easy and delicious!

I am going to try this recipe, however please remember that the time for boiling eggs depends on your altitude. Takes 10 mins here in southern Colorado took 12 when I lived in Mid Arkansas. This recipe sounds wonderful just wanted to point that fact out as I learned the hard way after moving to CO after living 23 years in AR. *Edit* these are quite tasty if you are looking for a "classic" deviled egg. Thx for the recipe!

These were pretty good. I made them for Easter. I would say the salt was fine in it although I added a bit more mustard to give it more zing. At first I wasn't sure about the sugar but in the end I liked it.     I did like one viewer suggested and I brought the eggs to boil (with a little oil in it) and then let them sit for 15min with the lid on. Then placed them in Ice water. The shell came off smoothly and the yolks had a nice yellow to them. I mixed the ingredients in a zip lock bag and piped them onto the eggs. Worked great. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent deviled eggs!  My 4 yr old just inhaled 3!  I wasn't sure if the kids were going to eat them but they LOVE them , I should have made more.  I used apple cider vinegar because I don't have any white.  Also they're really salty, I wish I would have read more reviews about less salt, but they're still good.  And since I'm from Maryland I top my eggs with a sprinkle of Old Bay instead of paprika.

I really liked this deviled egg recipe!
My only problem was that when I tried to double the recipe and all the ingredients, I doubled the salt as well.
Big no, no.  I will continue to double the recipe but leave the same amount of salt.  I added an extra tablespoon of mayo but that was just for my personal preference.  This will be my deviled egg recipe from now on.

This is truly the best deviled egg recipe ever written. You can turn it into a delicious egg salad, too - my favorite use for it. Yum!

These were VERY good!  My Mom loved these!  I also added a little extra mayo to make sure it is creamy.  And I used about half the salt.  Very good!  Will make again.

At first I thought I wasn't going to like these...the consistency didn't seem as creamy as what I was used to, but once I tried them they tasted very good.  I took the others' advice and only used a small amount of salt and I put a bit more mayo in...maybe 1/3 cup or a little more.  They turned out great, I will make these again.

My main complaint with this recipe is that it was too salty!  I think it would be a great recipe with maybe 1/4 t salt instead.

Way too much vinegar and way to much salt.  next time I really need to read the reviews instead of just going off the stars.  It was terrible.  I did my best to try and salvage them by adding more egg yolks, more sugar, more mayo, nothing helped.  It was sour and salty.  I will never make this again.

I have finally found a deviled egg recipe that I love!  I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the salt. I brought these to a dinner party and they were literally gobbled up!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

If you like sweet, creamy deviled eggs, then these are the ones for you! I would not recommend leaving out the salt, as others have done, unless you want the mixture to be "really" sweet. Salt, especially Sea Salt, gives a nice balance to the sugar. This recipe welcomes sweet pickle relish as an added kick. I will try another recipe that does not call for sugar as a comparison.

A good basic recipe. However, I thought it needed to kicked up a notch. Salt wasn't really needed. Maybe a dijon mustard, or garlic powder would be a nice touch.

They were so salty and I can't even describe what else I thought b/c they were just not to my liking at all. The others at the house for Easter dinner said they liked them, but I think they were just trying to be nice!  I will NOT be making these again...

Needed something for extra flavor.  I added  just a tiny bit of sweet pickle relish and onion powder, also did away with the vinegar. Good base, just needed some extra help, but that's just my opinion.

This was my first try at deviled eggs and they are really good!  I used 1/3 less salt, and I think I would reduce the salt even more...  To add paprika, I sprinkled some in the palm of my hand and used my opposite finger to "flick" it on (I was getting too much sprinkling it from the spice jar).  We will see how they go over tomorrow, but I think I will make these again.

Great recipe!  (We must remember that when it comes to seasonings, we need to "season to taste"; any recipe is a general idea.)  I do not like salt so I always go light on it!  I had already used my Morton's Nature's Seasons - Seasoning Blend Mix; hence I did not use the salt called for in the recipe. I like sugar; however, I used 1/4-1/2t after reading reviews.  Would have added more to taste but that was good for me.  I did add more Mayo only because I prefer a lighter, fluffy fill in the egg white.  Often times, I will use the juice from sweet relish rather than sugar and it has a nice taste to it; again, it depends on "our taste"!  There are so many variables with recipes; I rarely make one true to the recipe.  I was just looking for something different today and tried this recipe and am extremely pleased with the results. Thx for the recipe, Margaret!

This was the first time I have made Deviled Eggs, as well as the first time my husband has ever had them. I  found this recipe was delicious and easy! I enjoyed making them so much, that I got a bit carried away and found my husband was eating them about as quick as I was making them. Definitely a great side dish no matter the dinner/party size.

Turned out great minus being very salty. Only needs maybe 1/8 tsp. Hard boil the eggs a day in advance for ample cooling time and easier shelling.

These are delicious!! I found this recipe while searching for any recipe for deviled eggs, and I happened to read AbarJbar's review of this and three other similar recipes. Abar's review led me here, and I am so happy it did! These are going to be my go-to deviled eggs from now on!

My family loved this recipe, however I did a few substitutes. I used low-fat greek yogurt instead of mayo, 1 t spicy brown mustard, and 1/8 t salt instead of 1/2. Big hit. Will be making these again for sure!

After I made & tasted the deviled eggs, I had to check the recipe a few times over to be sure I put the correct ingredients and the right amounts in the yolk mix. The yolk mix was way too sweet and super runny. I love, love, LOVE deviled eggs and didn't think there was any way to possibly mess them up but this recipe was somewhat disappointing.

Delicious, creamy, simple! I doubled the recipe and added only a pinch of salt.  Hard to save these for guests.  I garnished some of the eggs with cilantro and some with paprika after piping in the filling. Made for a very pretty plate!

I used this recipe to fill my colored Easter eggs with. 2 other Easter deviled egg dishes also came to Easter dinner. I didn't have any left over eggs to take home.The flavor is a perfect blend of tangy and sweet  This will be my go to recipe every time.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I especially did not care for the sweetness.  I would definitly omit the sugar if I were to make them again.

These were just a bit too sweet for my taste, but many at a dinner party enjoyed them. I reduced the salt as many reviews said they were too salty, but they wound up being not quite salty enough in the end.

Way too salty, but has potential.  Like others, I wish I had read more reviews and cut the salt by a LOT!  I was apologizing at the party I took these to.  Glad it was family and they were not too picky.  That said, once the salt is cut, the next time I make these, I think they will be very good.

These are really tasty! I followed the recipe exactly but added a little less salt based on some of the reviews. I figured I could always sprinkle a little on top later if needed but they were fine without. I already at 2.5 eggs and had to put them away to stop myself from eating more!

Way, way too salty. Had to put in twice as many eggs to offset that and it was still saltier than I would have liked.

I made these for Easter dinner and they were very good. I will definitely make them again. They have a different flavor that tastes really good and my family loved them. I didn't alter the recipe at all it's great as is!

SO salty! I followed the recipe to a "T" and did not change anything - way too salty. We had to add more mayo & sugar to cut the saltiness. I did not care for this.

Really good flavor, but watch the salt. I tripled the batch, but only doubled the salt to 1 tsp, and they are still a bit salty to me.

These were definitely WAY too salty. They could be delicious if you lowered the amount of salt by at least half.

I thought the recipe was too salty and too sugary.  Usually my family fights over the eggs, however this time, I had many left over.  I will use this recipe again, except I adjusted the amount of salt and sugar by one half..

I don't know why people are rating it 5 stars if they have to change the recipe.  This is WAY TOO SALTY.  An 1/8 of a tsp of salt would have been too much for 6 eggs let alone the 1/2 tsp the recipe calls for.

Not creamy enough and too salty. I halved the salt as some other reviews recommended and it was still too salty. I also added more mayo to make it creamier.

i use my pastry cutter or potatoe masher to do the yolks as it makes a nice fine egg to mix the other ingredients into and found these eggs great with no salt due to sodium reduced diets etc

Thought I would try something different, but this did not work for me. Being a girl from the deep South, I like my deviled eggs savory; and I should have known better than to stray from my roots by leaving out the pork product, and going with this sweet recipe. Next time I combine sugar and egg, it better be going into a cake batter!

I've been making deviled eggs for 30 years using this recipe, minus the sugar and vinegar. Those two ingredients were news to me. So I tried this version. Margaret, how can I thank you?! What a beautiful, subtle difference that made. I have my go to recipe now for the next 30 years. I can't figure out how 1/2 t. salt between six eggs can be WAY too salty for anyone. lol Next time I might mix in some dill as another poster suggested. Sounds good.

I usually make my deviled eggs with relish, but I was out of that, so I was looking for an alternative- it just so happened I had vinegar. I liked the extra umph of the vinegar. The texture was awesome. I may 86 the relish for now on and keep with the vinegar because it taste just the same! Awesome recipe! Also- I read previous comments about how the texture became a little runny the next day- Mine was fine and I even added an extra tsp of vinegar.

Really great recipe!  It was was.  Not runny.  I learned that after I boil the eggs, to let them soak in cool water for about 15 mins.  Then the shell falls right off :)  I added a small amount of pickle relish - I like the added 'crunch' it gives.  Thanks for the recipe! Happy New Year :)

Just finished eating a batch of these.  The only thing I changed was that I didn't add any salt at all after reading reviews.  These tasted fantastic and were very easy to prepare.  Will make again and again!

Perfect deviled egg recipe, reminds me of my grandmas. I used Miracle Whip because I am not fond of mayonnaise.

GREAT RECIPE! The only thing that made it better was adding 6 slices of bacon per 12 eggs and 3 tablespoons easy cheese cheddar! Make sure the bacon is really crispy.  Cook it on low heat for a long time so it crumbles (really small) and mixes well.  Oh and Grey Poupon works the best for the mustard and half the salt!  Also I found the best way to do it is mix everything in a zip lock freezer bag, using the cutting board to press the yokes so that everything mixes completely.  Then cut the corner and squirt it right into the egg whites!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Made these and my old standby (mayo,relish,etc) for a church gathering last night and they flew off the plate before my standby's did.Made a batch of 12. Doubled everything. Changed the vinegar to apple cider, & decreased the salt to 1/8 teaspoon. Refrigerated a few hours before serving to blend. What a great dish. Will definitely make again!

Good flavor, and easy.  But too much salt!  I just followed the recipe to the letter (which I don't usually do, but I was in a weird mood), and they were way too salty.  Kind of ruined it.  So cut down on the salt, and adjust according to taste.

My favorite Deviled Egg recipe!  I like them simple and creamy, and these fit the bill perfectly.  Sometimes I'll add a sprinkle of dill instead of paprika.  Good, old fashioned food that's gone in a flash.

oh dear, I should have read the reviews before making these, they turned out way too salty.  Otherwise the flavor was good, although I think I will substitute the syrup from my icicle pickles for the vinegar next time.  The texture was great and even my two year old enjoyed eating them.  Next time I will go lightly on the paprika, mine came out fast on some and it gave them more smoky flavor than I wanted.

These were OK, but I felt they tasted too much like mustard. Also, they are missing something in comparison to how my grandmother makes them. I'm going to have to ask her for her recipe, or rather watch her do it, since I don't think she follows a recipe!

I use light mayo & splenda to make each deviled egg only 40 cals each and it still tastes GREAT! My hubby doesn't even notice the diff.

Side note: Go easy on the salt! This recipe def overdoes it..

I actually had to modify it because I didn't have all the ingredients.  Instead of vinegar I used italian dressing.  Instead of mustard, (who has no mustard), I used honey mustard dipping sauce.  It turned out beautiful.

I was a bit sceptical with the mix of ingredients but these were soooo good! I made this for a family gathering so made 30 eggs and they were the first thing to go.  I noticed many reviewers said they were too salty. I rarely salt per recipe but rather a little at a time and taste as I go so these did not turn out too salty at all.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I made half a dozen of these eggs and half a dozen regular deviled eggs, my 35+ guests and I tasted no difference. Just took a bit more of my time and made a few more dirty dishes. Not really worth my time to do this recipe again

It was my first time making deviled eggs and I don't normally make them as I am not a fan of mayo or mustard, but these were both easy and fantastic!  I will definitely keep this recipe for the future!  I did follow other reviews and limited the salt to just a dash.

I used this recipe for my first time tackling deviled eggs. My family gave them very high ratings. Next time I'd like to try the pickle relish for added flavor.

I will make this clear first; I hate deviled eggs. Typically because all the ones I've had before have been too sweet. But I wanted to make some for my Easter dinner, AND THIS WAS PERFECT! Everyone loved them, and will definitely use this recipe every time I fix them!

Delicious! I only gave 4 stars because I had to make some altercations. I added 1 more teaspoon of mustard making it 2 teaspoons. I added a pinch more of mayonnaise. I halved the salt per other reviews. I added about half a teaspoon of pepper. That is all and it turned out wonderful! I had to substitute the paprika since I didn't have any and used chili powder instead. Amazing!

I made a couple of changes, but the recipe would've been fine without the changes. Instead of vinegar, I used pickle juice (which is mainly vinegar anyway). I also used spicy mustard because it's all I had. I used the recipe's amount of sugar, but next time I would cut it in half or eliminate it all together...it isn't bad, just a little sweeter than I like. I also didn't add the salt because I personally don't like salt...that could've made a difference in the sweetness. These eggs were absolutely delish!!

Very good. I used 1 tsp honey mustard in lieu of the yellow mustard and omitted the sugar.  This made it sweet but added a little extra tang.  Sprinkled fresh nipped dill on half the eggs and put the traditional paprika on the other half.  A hit.

These were really good.  I didn't really measure any of the ingredients; I just went by taste and look.  I'm sure I used more mayo and mustard than called for,  because I thought the measurements, as written, sounded a little dry.  I also used 1/2 tsp of pickle juice in place of the vinegar and left out the salt all together.  Very good!

LOVED these. I did cut the salt in half though - next time I think I'll leave it out completely. The vinegar does the job without adding yet more sodium.

Just wanted to share a tip when you are boiling the eggs.  For a clean peel boil the eggs about 10 min. then take a knife and crack the egg.  This allows the water to get inbetween the egg white and shell.  Boil for about 5 min. more.  I cool mine under running cold water in the same pot.  They should peel easier.  If you are using fresh eggs (ones from your own chickens) this does help some.  They are the hardest to peel.

I was looking for a recipe that would be similar to the delicious deviled eggs my sister makes, and this recipe was the closest.  It's very good, easy to make, and fun to eat!  It is a bit sweeter than a lot of deviled egg recipes, and I like to use Miracle Whip rather than plain mayonnaise to give it a little more kick and make it a bit healthier.  Overall, a delicious recipe!

Wow did I mess this recipe up!  Instead of "white vinegar," I mistakenly used "White Wine Vinegar."  Do not make this mistake like I did!!!  However, I could definitely taste the potential of this recipe if one was to correctly follow directions. What a difference regular white vinegar makes!  Bad Idea, bad execution, but good recipe!

This is terrible!  I just tried to make it for Thanksgiving and it is way too salty.  I just wasted a dozon eggs.  I don't know why others have said that it was good but it isn't.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.

Great recipie as is or you add a little more or less of that too taste. I have been making this as is for a while now.  Most important part is mash egg yolks alone before adding any wet ingredients.  It comes out so creamy.  I always used to mash everything together, but doing just the yolks first is amazingly better.  Thank you for the recipie.

holy cow were these deviled eggs the bomb!  we fried up some bacon, toweled off the grease and put it in the food processor to make bacon crumble.  then when we mixed the egg yolk mixture, we tossed all of the ingredients into the food processor with the bacon.  all i could say was - wow!  it was light and fluffy and not the least bit slippery or gooey.  totally perfect.  thank you, margaret, for sharing!!

This was the best deviled egg recipe ever--made 9 eggs and 3/4 the recipe--the only thing I did differently was to beat with hand mixer--much smoother--took to church picnic--rave reviews--definitely a keeper!

I made 18 of these (triple the recipe) for a football party, and they were gone within 30 minutes! I found that I needed a little more mayo than the recipe called for, and a little less sugar. I definitely recommend creaming the yolk mixture to get a smooth texture.

Extraordinary! I did cut back on the salt a bit and found it great.  That seems like a lot of salt.  Also, being a Southerner like so many on here, I added about two teaspoons of sweet relish.  Perfect! I didn't want to stuff the eggs, so I diced the whites and added them into the deviled mixture and made deviled egg finger sandwiches.  They were a huge hit at the party.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are extremely salty.  I think they would be perfect without as much salt though.  The next time I make them I am going to start with a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and season it to taste.

The flavor was good but I followed it as the directions stated and the yolks were too salty to eat. I couldn't even finish so I would recommend following the recipe but with way less salt and it should be perfect.

Recipe was really salty. I used less than the called amount and the salt was still over powering. I would suggest slowly adding salt until you like it.

Way way too salty. Completely inedible. The other reviewers seemed to wisen up in time, but I try to make a recipe as it's written the first time. So yes, reduce salt by at least half. I tried to salvage them, but I ended up feeding it to my dog.

Excellent recipe...I add a pinch of paprika to the mix itself as well as on top. This is the recipe that I will always follow.  I would suggest adding the vinegar per your taste - as well as the sugar.  I also added a literal pinch more of sugar to the tops with the paprika ( i like sweet food).

They were pretty good, and maybe I shouldn't take off a star because I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayonnaise. I decreased the sugar but they were still too sweet. I would leave out the sugar completely if using Miracle Whip.

This is a great recipe, but I made a few modifications.  I use Grey Poupon dijon mustard, and I dissolve the sugar in apple cider vinegar, to avoid the grainy texture of the sugar crystals.  I omitted the salt completely.  I used a hand mixer to make the filling smooth, and then filled a bag fitted with a large star tip and piped the filling back into the egg whites before sprinkling with paprika.

Used 1/2 seasoned salt and Dijon mustard. Subbed rice for white vinegar, and used half what the recipe called for.  These were awesome.

well it was 11pm the night before easter and we had baskets to make and my husband got the birght idea to make deviled eggs! i went looking and found this!  for me they were WOW!!! 5 star. we did follow the other reviews and salt to taste. and we used 15 eggs! any how the only reason my husband couldnt give it 5 stars was he felt it need relish (me i was glad it wasnt in there) and he wanted to thank the other reviewers for the genius idea of the zip lock bag, said it made for an awesome presentation even if it was just for us.

These are so delicious and present so nicely! I was excited to find this recipe--the way my family always made them included worcestershire sauce for the tartness, but it always discolors the yolks a little bit. The white vinegar adds that flavor without discoloring! And the sugar adds an extra dimension. After mixing I put the stuffing in a sandwich bag and cut off a corner to pipe into the eggs. Great recipe--will use every time!

Forgot to add that I used a dozen eggs and doubled the recipe.  I needed more mayo for a creamy textue (my eggs might have been bigger), 1 more tsp of sugar, a few splashes of tabasco, @ 1 tbs of spicy mustard.  Also added fresh ground pepper with the paprika.  Good now, but better tomorrow (Easter), after a night melding in the frig.  Thanks for this keeper.

Test the saltiness of the yolk filling before you add all the listed salt (1/2 teaspoon).  It was way too salty for our families liking.  Otherwise a good recipe.

Perfect! I made 1.5 times the recipe for a dozen medium eggs.  Final mixing is a ziplock bag and cut the corner off to fill eggs. My brother said they were better than his mother-in-law's, which is apparently a huge compliment.

Great deviled eggs.  Easy to make, subtle flavor in the filling.  I might try to add a little something spicy next time to add some zing!

Used fat free mayo.  After mixing in the mustard found no need for the added sugar and salt.  Great healthy midday snack as well as an appetizer!

THANK YOU MARGARET!!! My mother grew up in Rushville, and since she passed on over 15 years ago I've been trying to recreate this "famous family recipe"! (I think she got it from my grandmother, who worked at the Durbin.) I've tried a LOT over the years, and the only ones that even came close were the Good Housekeeping ones. Even they couldn't compare to these ones, though - thanks!!!

Way too salty!! I agree with Tara3877 - I wish I had seen her review first. I just ruined a batch with too much salt too. Debating on whether to make another 12 eggs to cut the salt or just go with another recipe. Add salt to taste but don't dump in 1/2 teaspoon!
Update 04.03.10: Omitted the salt as written and just salted to taste. Two dozen devoured in a matter of minutes. Very good texture, taste & visual appeal when garnished with parsley sprigs for a buffet. Best method for hard boiled eggs is using cold water to boil- 2 min boil-12 min covered-then ice bath - always perfect.

I've made a few different kinds of deviled eggs, and I just keep coming back to these because they have the quintessential taste that I love. Per the other reviewers I added just a bit less than an 1/8th teaspoon of salt and it was absolutely perfect. That was the only change I made to the recipe -- otherwise it has the perfect taste.

This is pretty good but it's too mayonnaisey.  I would cut back the mayo a tad (I used Hellman's, maybe something else would work better).

I always try to wing deviled eggs and it never comes out quite right.  Finally decided to go with a recipe and this one was PERFECT.  Taste exactly like you want deviled eggs to taste.  I could have eaten the whole dozen!  Use dijon mustard (because that's all we had) and was still fab.  Thank you!

FANTASTIC!! I usually do not change recipe's the first time making but did so based on others reviews...but I didn't change much! I doubled the batch, used half prepared mustard and half ground mustard. Added some garlic powder and omited the salt. Once all mixed I tasted it and added a pinch of seasoned salt. The eggs were eaten up, not watery at all. Cannot wait to make again, they were a hit! Thanks Margaret!

I made these for a birthday party celebration.  It was the 1st time I have ever made deviled eggs and they were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added the salt to taste.  People raved about them and could not quite figure out why they tasted different (a good different) than the deviled eggs they have had in the past.  They were surprised when I told them there was white vinegar in them.  I will definitely be making these again....a keeper!

This recipe calls for way to much salt. I took them to a Labor Day picnic and ended up tossing them.I was so embarrassed and the consistency of the filling is thick not creamy. I was very disappointed.

These were fantastic!  I am so glad that I read Abarjbar's review as I spent a lot of time comparing all of the deviled egg recipes on the site.  This one looked good but I wanted something a bit spicier so I made minor changes to the recipe.  Instead of regular mustard, I used dijon mustard & instead of white vinegar I used white rice vinegar.  I used a dozen eggs to make 24 deviled eggs & they were immediately consumed at our Father's Day BBQ.  Everyone raved about them; I have never seen such excitement over a deviled egg, it was crazy!  Even the kids ate them.  The horseradish in the dijon mustard added just enough "kick" without being over-powering.  The rice vinegar is more subtle than regular white & it complimented the other ingredients nicely.  As other posters have suggested, immediately put the hard-boiled eggs in ice water; this will help prevent the yolks from turning green around the edges & will also make them easier to peel.  I will be using this recipe from now on!

I was a bit bummed by this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, which was a mistake. I piped the mixture into the eggs and tasted what was left in the pastry bag. It tasted fine. I covered the eggs and refrigerated them for about 3 hours until dinner. I couldn't resist sneaking one and was shocked at how salty it was. I think if they were eaten right away it wouldn't have been a problem. As it was, I warned everyone and they took their chances. If I make these again, I will seriously cut back on the salt - 1/8 tsp. or less would be adequate.

Too salty according to recipe! First time I didn't read reviews first because I get irritated by the people who completely change the recipe...sigh. Use 1/4 tsp salt! I also like my deviled eggs with a little more mustard flavor. That being said the texture was fantastic!

These were great!  The   problem is, there is WAY too much salt!!  I would use half the salt or less, and then these devilled eggs would be perfect.

Tasted like the ones my mom used to make!  Classic, easy recipe although I did add more mustard and vinegar to make it a little tangier.  Everyone liked them!

Not only was it too salty, on the other end it had a sweetness to it that just didn't go well with the saltiness.  Very strange tasting.

**please read** way to much salt called for on this recipe!! The eggs would have been the best deviled eggs I had ever had but the salt ruined them. I would put 3/4 tsp. in instead of the 1-1/2 tsp. otherwise, wonderful. Thanks

My husband, who usually eats 6 or 7 deviled eggs in one sitting, ate one and refused to touch another.  They were WAY TOO SALTY!! Wish I had read the reviews from others first and taken their advice about cutting the salt in half.  How disappointing!  However, I will try this recipe again with only half the salt, as I do like the general idea and can see where the recipe's author was going with this.  Hopefully I'll have better luck next time...

I've mastered the harder stuff but I've never made deviled eggs (I know...go figure!) ...we had a big New Year's party and I made a pretty big batch...there wasn't a single one left! I used the advise of another reviewer and filled the eggs using a ziploc bag with the corner cut off. They were beautiful and they were a hit! Love this recipe.

These were alright but I also found them to be too salty. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo so maybe that's why. I will try again with mayo and less salt.

Sorry, these weren't good.  After reading the reviews, I halved the vinegar and salt.  Even so, the vinegar was much too overwhelming in taste.

Delicious. I'd never made deviled eggs before, and these hit the spot. I wanted to add pickles, but was out. Now, I'm glad I didn't have them, because with the vinegar, I think they would have been unnecessary.

Wasn't sure about adding sugar, but once the guests tried these, the plate was cleared! 
THESE deviled eggs will stay in my keepers! Update 8/14/10: made for a gathering last night, and these really are the best. I boil the eggs, cut in half, put the yolks in one bowl and the whites in another, which goes back in the fridge. I mix the filling together, put it in a resealable bag, and cut a hole in the corner to fill the whites. No mess, easy, and when you're finished, just toss the bag! I serve these on a deviled egg plate, and put several toothpicks straight down into the filling, then cover with plastic wrap so the filling doesn't get mashed. Happy cooking!

Pretty boring.  Kind of dry with no umph to them.  The sugar (actually, splenda) was an odd addition.  Not bad, just not OMG.  I also made a batch of the Horseradish Deviled eggs on this site and those were great.

Pretty good.  Made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  I usually make deviled eggs with just the yolk and miracle whip, but wanted to "spice it up" a little.  Only variation I made was Miracle whip instead of mayo and added a little fresh ground pepper.  Yum!

Sometimes simple is best.  I made this recipe exactly as written.  These are just plain good deviled eggs.  I would never have thought of putting sugar in the mix, but the sugar is the key.  This will be my standard deviled egg recipe.

I have been making deviled eggs like these for years, but it always seemed as if something was missing.  I have never included sugar in my deviled eggs, but since this recipe is so close to my own I went ahead and tried it.  The sugar added the "bite" that I was missing from my own recipe.  The only change I made from this recipe was to add two tablespoons of sweet relish.  These were delicious!

These are excellent...just the way my mom used to make them. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. For the fist time, I had just enough filling. I usually have too much. I think the vinegar gave it the tangy taste that gave it a kick.

This is exactly how my family has made deviled eggs for several generations.  However, instead of white vinegar, we usually use cider vinegar.  Sooooo good!

This was a great recipe - exactly what I was looking for.  I used kosher salt and after tasting the egg mixture I felt it wasn't salty enough.  I added a smidgen more of salt and it ended up being too much, once all the flavors melded together. Next time I'll use the recommended amount of salt only.

These were great!  I loved the hint of vinegar in these eggs.  After reading the reviews I did salt to taste instead of 1/2 tsp and added more mayo until it was a creamy consistance.  I will be making these again.

Great good old fashioned (no bells or whistles) comfort food! Mmmmm! Mine turned out FINE using the directions as listed with the exception of using salt to taste. Only reason I can think of someone having trouble with this easy recipe is confusing teaspoon and tablespoon in the measurements. My small niece loves deviled eggs with no pickles -- this fills the bill and always brings smiles and toothless grins. Thanks for sharing.

Way too salty in my opinion. I made twice this past weekend, but used half the salt the second time, which was much better. I do like the tang of the mustard and the sweetness of the sugar.

The recipe is similar to one we've used for years, but the touch of sugar was a nice improvement. We've switched to this one. As others have noted, cut back on the salt and add-to-taste.

I don't eat deviled eggs so my review is based on my family.  I made these for Easter Sunday and nobody cared for them.  They did not like the flavor at all.  My mom and my husband didn't care for the vinegar addition and my brother in law wasn't sure what he didn't like about them.  Oh well.  At least they tried them.  Thank you anyway for sharing but I will still be in search for a deviled egg recipe for the next holiday.

These were delicious deviled eggs! I wasn't sure when I read the ingredient list, but trusted the ratings and glad I did. I followed exactly as written. I used half the kosher salt and light mayo. My son (24) said, "Now THAT's a deviled egg!" then he ate about 8 of them...

I'm really disappointed in these eggs.  Way too salty and I cut the salt in half...and I like my food well-salted!  I chose these as someone else had a done a taste test with four recipes and because the kids ate all the Miracle Whip.  Now I have 35 guests coming for Easter and bad Deviled Eggs.

WONDERFUL!  I love the tip I read somewhere about adding salt to the water to make the eggs peel easier.  It worked like a charm!  As for this recipe-I LOVE the flavor the vinegar adds. YUM

These were pretty good...Almost everyone liked them.  I added a bit of wochestershire sauce & a dab of relish for a little more oomph.  I thought they were good and will continue to use this as a base recipe.

I made these to go with ham for Christmas dinner and increased the recipe to 8 servings using 2 dozen eggs. After reading the other reviews, the only change I made was to cut the salt in half. Everyone raved about them and my husband said they were the best deviled eggs he ever had. They were the first thing to disappear from the table and people were asking if I had more.  Thanks for the great recipe.

WAY too salty.  I doubled the recipe and used jumbo eggs.  My fault though....I should have read reviews before making...I was in a rush to take to a family Christmas gathering and couldn't find my recipe.  I don't think that my recipe even calls for salt.  I also added an extra TBS of mayo and another 2 tsp of sugar....just our personal taste for deviled eggs though....we like a fluffier filling as opposed to thick/pasty.

I changed the recipe to 4 servings and it was SO SALTY. Still pretty good, I might even make again, just with at least half the salt, or maybe none at all considering the vinegar and mustard.

My daughter and I made these. We did add an extra Tbsp of mayo for a double batch (5 instead of 4, but it probably wasn't needed). Otherwise we made them as the recipe calls for. We enjoyed them and would make again!

These are so good. A few slight changes from the original: rice vinegar, spicy brown mustard, a pinch each of smoked paprika, chili, and cayenne pepper. Like others, I nearly doubled the mayo and went light on the salt. No matter how many you make, they’ll be gone in a flash.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I made the recipe a day before serving. The day I made them, I was a little concerned the recipe might be a little too salty. However, the next day while I was preparing the eggs to serve I found myself trying to find imperfections and putting those eggs aside for myself.  This will be my recipe for life!

I think this is a great recipe, but I will need to cut down on the salt a little next time.

This is by far by favorite deviled egg recipe. The right amount of sweet and tangy, not bland at all, and a great texture. I sometimes omit the salt, merely because I forget.

These vanish every time I make them. I use garlic flavored red wine vinegar, because that was all I had on hand the first time I made them. I have since used white vinegar, and my hubby didn't like them as much. "Egg"cellent recipe, Thank you!

I've been making this recipe for family gatherings for several years- it is truly the best. The filling is sweet and tangy and has a great consistency. ( I became the new egg maker after my sister in law- hers were always runny and..gross) I always get compliments and there are never any left over. 1 question- who only needs 12 finished eggs? I always use at least 2 dozen! :-) also, sometimes I sprinkle with bacon or bacon bits instead of paprika.

These are good, but as other reviewers have noted, there's too much salt in the filling.  It isn't bad when eaten with the mild egg white, but it's much better when I use only 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.  (Less might even be OK.)  I found that when I scaled the recipe for 12 eggs, I had enough filling for 14 eggs (including all 14 yolks).

Do NOT put in as much salt as it calls for! We made this recipe and it was way too salty. We couldn't even eat them. We made it again with just a dash of salt and they were perfect.

Delicious - this is the same ingredients my mom and I always put in the Deviled Eggs, but we never measured, just tasted.  I had 3 hard boiled eggs to use up, and this recipe hit the spot.

I doubled the recipe except for the amount of salt, since some reviewers said it was way too salty.  I taste tested the filling and still found it salty, so next time I will cut it down to 1/4 tsp.  Apart from that, very good!

These deviled eggs are amazing! I made them for every Air Force function in which we were responsible for bringing something. There would be at least three trays of deviled eggs there, but mine were always gone first! Thanks so much for this amazing recipe.

Made this for a family dinner, they were a hit!!! I only used half the salt, and put the yolk mixture into a pastry bag and then squeezed it into the egg whites. Flavorful and delicious, will make these again!!!

Omit the salt. Use a plastic ziploc bag to mix the deviled egg ingredients. Add an extra egg yolk to make it creamier.  The remaining ingredients should be heaping; not exact. Cut off the end of the bag to squeeze it into the egg.

These were great!  The first time I made them just like the recipe specified, but the mustard and salt were a little strong.  The second time I used half the amount of mustard and salt and was told that they were perfect!

If you use Hellmans, omit the salt, or they become inedible.  I even tried to half the salt and still way too salty.

I have made these many times, because they are addictive. At first I tried with apple cider vinager, which I usually like but it was just not right. So I then tried the recipe at written, which is just excellent. Lots of compliments from friends and family and from me. Really the best deviled eggs I have ever made. I will continue to use this recipe!

I don't eat eggs, but I made these for my husband and he loved them! He said they were perfect. I had never made deviled eggs before or even hardboiled eggs before, but I found this recipe to be very easy and fun to make. I will cook these again for sure. By the way, as per other reviewers, I cut the salt in half.

I followed the recipe exactly using 3 servings and it was horrible. Way too much salt.  I made a second batch and used one third the salt called for and it was still very bland.  I wouldn't recommend this at all.

I made this deviled egg recipe last year for a summer potluck at work and all my coworkers still ask me to make it again. It is almost time for this year's summer potluck and of course I'm gearing up to make them again.

These were delicious deviled eggs! The only thing I did different was l left out the sugar and I forgot to put in the salt. But I didn't miss the salt. The filling was very creamy and eggy tasting. I don't like some recipes where there is too much mayo taste and other things. These were perfect for my taste!
This will be my go to recipe for deviled eggs. All  others are being deleted from my folder!

Edible but not the best.  I will keep the recipe, omit the sugar and add more mayo.  They were dry and sweet.  There was also a little too much of something but I will play with the recipe to perfect it!

Fantastic! These were amazing, I made them for Easter breakfast. I had a friend tell me they reminded him exactly of what his mother made for him when he was a kid. I pulled back the salt a little bit, but otherwise followed exactly and would definitely do it again.

This recipe was WAY too salty and the sweet from sugar was unnecessary and unpleasant.  As i was adding the salt it seemed like a lot, but figured i'd follow the recipe.  I should have trusted my instinct.  I will try another recipe next time.

WAY too salty as written.  If I make these again, I will leave out the 1/2 teaspoon of salt as the mayo and mustard had enough salt to carry the dish.

I don't know what I did wrong. Mine came out way too salty and I even boiled 8 eggs instead of 6. Hopefully I can salvage somehow because aside from the salt, the flavor and texture is just right.

WAY, WAY too salty.  So disappointed I was bringing these to a BBQ and now I can't.  I even boiled more eggs to add the yolks to the mixture. Next time I will not even add salt.  I suggest salt to taste at the end!!

I made these for a Easter party tomorrow.  Just tasted some left over yoke... they are awesome!  I wasn't 100% sure with the sugar and vinegar, but it tastes great!  Can't wait to see how they are tomorrow after sitting overnight and letting flavors mix.

This is an excellent recipe.  I mix all the ingredients in my blender and "pipe" them into their "nests"  They are super creamy and delicious!
This recipe also makes excellent egg-salad...just chop everything watch the consistency; adjusting  the mayo to your liking.

This recipe was very good, but the vinegar and salt both need to be cut in half. Once that is done these eggs are amazing!

Tried this recipe without adding any salt (due to previous reviews), 1/2 country style Dijon and 1/2 prepared mustard, and cider vinegar (all due to what i had on hand. I lightly spinkled with salt in the end but not enough to measure. VERY GOOD and VERY easy.

Awesome recipe! I used salad dressing or mayo and 1/4 of the recommended salt.  These deviled eggs taste perfect! Hint to make removing the shells easier: Put eggs in a pan of water.  When water begins to boil set timer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Let set for about 30 minutes.  Drain, transfer eggs to a bowl.  Fill bowl with cold water and a couple of cups of ice cubes.  Once ice cubes melt eggs peel VERY EASILY.

I was skeptical about putting sugar in the egg filling, but I figured I'd do it because the recipie called for it, and maybe it would taste good. I didn't like the way that the sugar contrasted with the mustard and the vinegar, I'll omit it next time.

I made these deviled  eggs for Thanksgiving.  I added a little more vinegar, a little more mayo, and chopped up a sweet pickle into the mix.  ( I think the amount of ingredients may vary, according to the size eggs you use).

Just made them and they are delicious! Thank you for posting this recipe, as I've always had a hard time making my eggs taste just right.  This was marvelous.  I made 7 eggs and used 3 Tbspns of miracle whip, plus forgot to use the sugar but still they are delicious! Fluffy, creamy and wonderful.

This recipe is awesome!  I normally don't like deviled eggs but these were awesome.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of horseradish and it was a big hit!

I agree with all the other people who said it was TOO SALTY! Just use enough salt to taste otherwise its too salty. I even used less? And it was STILL too much. So i can only imagine how salty it would be if i used the full recommended amount. Rest of the recipe seemed ok.

I love this deviled egg recipe. I think the vinegar does something to break down the yokes and make them even more creamy. I often use this as a base and then add additional flavors, bacon, hot sauce, avacado, ect. depending on what I want to make. They always get eaten up and people comment that there is something different about them. Thank you Margaret and the Durbin Inn!

I've made this as directed in the recipe several times and every time every single egg is gobbled up with rave reviews.  BUT instead of paprika, I put a dash of McCormick Smoked Paprika on half the eggs, the rest get a garnish of a small spray of fresh dill.  The sugar adds a smooth sweetness to the filling.

I made double the recipe, less doubling the salt.  Even with only 1/2 tsp salt, I found the recipe too salty.  Would definitely add relish for more flavor next time. and only 1/4 tsp salt for the double order...

I love this recipe and have used it several times. I do cut back on the salt and use about half. I sometimes add a tiny bit more mayo for a creamier consistency.

Given the rating and reviews for this recipe, I figured it was a must try. I can't even begin to describe my disappointment. All at once it was too sweet, too salty, and too mustard-y. I'll go back to my basic deviled egg recipe that has the perfect balance of salty and sweet, with minimal ingredients. Some may prefer this flavor, unfortunately I do not.

I made these this past weekend { Labor Day, 2011 } for a gathering I attended, and they were outstanding!  Everyone commented how good they were.  I'd give the recipe 5 stars, except that I did incorporate a couple changes I read in the comments.  Specifically, I used No Salt, whatsoever.  And secondly, instead using sugar, half of the mustard I replaced with Honey Mustard.  Aside from those two changes, I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were wonderful!

I have tried at least 2 other top rated deviled eggs recipes on this site and I have to tell you that this one by far is the best one. They have such a sweet taste to them and are absolutely delicous. I would really recommend everyone to try this recipe. Its so good. This is the only one I will stick to making from now on.

This recipe came out great! I followed everything exactly. And also the sugar gives it a really nice sweet-ish taste... I used a little bag and snipped a whole in one corner for fillng the eggs easily. I will use this recipe again!

Yummmmm.  I didn't have paprika on hand so I used spicy brown mustard instead of regular mustard.  I also only used half of the salt the recipe calls for.  Turned out great.  Also, love the tip of using a plastic bag to mix everything and pipe mixture into eggs.  I topped my eggs with a slice of black olive on each.  Next time I'm going to try crumbled bacon.

This was a great recipe, I used half regular mustard and half spicy brown and added some onion powder in. The white vinegar really added to it, great idea. Really good recipe.

Tangy but slightly sweet, instead of paprika (because I didn't have any) I used Cajun seasoning on top, which makes them a bit spicy. Quite delicious if you like spicy foods like me.

Super easy and they tasted great!  I did a double batch and brought them to a party.  A friend brought a fancier batch of her own creation, however these disappeared... While hers just sat there!  I'll make these again.

I used jumbo sized eggs. I wanted a fluffier filling, and used a whisk, added a tablespoon more of mayo, then piped them using a plastic bag with the corner snipped.

Super easy & will make again.

PLEASE - DO NOT USE 1/2 tsp of SALT - way toooooooo salty!  After adding more mayo, more mustard, more sugar, and a lil mustard powder - I think I've salvaged the eggs.  Shame on me for not paying attention to the warnings shared by others.

I followed the recipe exactly (but I did little bit more of white vinegar in) and it turned out very mustardy. I will give this a 4 because other than that they r very good.

A good recipe for a pot luck must-have!  Like some others, I found my first batch to be a little too salty (and I usually love a little extra salt).  So, for my second batch, I used a little less salt than the recipe calls for and they were perfect!

Very, very good!  Next time, I'll use 1/4 teaspoon of salt rather than a 1/2 a teaspoon.  I think it was just a tad bit too much salt.  Otherwise, excellent taste!

These were boring.  While I liked the smooth consistency, they had no pop.  I scooped out the filling added, dill, then cayenne, then  garlic salt . still nothing to write home.

These were way too salty. They had a good taste otherwise, but the salt was overwhelming. However, my husband discovered that if you scoop half of the filling out then the flavor balances, so it wasn't a total waste. I would make these again, but use half the salt, at most.

TOO SWEET! These weren't good at all. The sugar over-powered everything else. I ended up adding more mustard and vinegar to even it out. My hubby ate them, but he also eats "fake" deviled eggs that are just the yokes mixed with mayo and pickle relish. i won't make these again.

I doubled the recipe and used 12 eggs.  Wish I tripled it.  They were delicious.  The best deviled eggs I have ever had.  I will be making this all the time.  I made no changes, made exactly as the recipes says (except for doubling it).

Normally on Thanksgiving the deviled eggs are wiped clean fairly quickly. However, this year I deviated from my norm and opted to try this recipe. I cut down on the salt and sugar and my family questioned me as to if I made them with Miracle Whip or not. They did eat some, but I still had majority remaining. They were "ok" but not a crowd pleaser at my house.

I only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt and used miracle whip instead of mayo and still VERY salty..but gave it 4 stars bc I think it would be delicious if salt ws left out.

I significantly cut back on the salt and almost doubled the mustard and this was a great recipe! They were gone in no time. I just wish someone would peel them for me...farm fresh eggs seemed a lot harder to peel than store bought

I have been using the same recipe for years but I decided to try something new. This recipe was great! Just enough twang and sweet. My husband loves sweet relish in his deviled eggs and I don't and I feel like this was a happy medium. Only substitution that I made was I used smoked paprika. I will definitely make more next time!

We tried several different recipes, this one wasn't very popular at our home.  Maybe cut back on the sugar.  On to a different recipe - we will not save this one.

This is the same recipe I use for deviled eggs.  However I use Miracle Whip instead of mayo and add bacon, yes bacon.  Every time I make them people say I have never seen bacon in deviled eggs before and crinkle up their nose, try them anyway and always ask for my recipe on their way out.  Bacon bits work too, but I use thick cut bacon cook it in the frying pan and crumble and add to the mixture...YUM.

The best deviled eggs I have ever eaten. Every single person I have made this for loves them and eats 6 or more. I have had many requests for this recipe and it's spreading like wildfire with friends and friends of friends lol. I eat them for breakfast and make them for parties. I use smoked paprika on them. I find it has a better flavor than regular paprika. Thank you! enjoy!

These are on the right track of what I am looking for but not quite there! I would half the salt next time (and I like salt). Maybe a pinch more sugar and mayo. Also a dash of something like tabasco and the use of a different mustard might help too!

I don't like deviled eggs but whenever I've made these, they don't last long. At the holidays my family (kind of big) ate almost 2 dozen of them in less than half an hour! Big hit! For a little extra I add some cayenne pepper to some of them just sprinkled on top.

Nice traditional deviled egg. I actually messed up one batch by halving the amount of mustard and mayo (wasn't paying attention to which spoon I used) and oddly enough it balanced out quite well with the normal amount of vinegar. Totally different taste than when I made the second batch right, but still quite tasty. Try it both ways if you feel like it.

I felt this recipe was one of the better recipes for deviled eggs.  I added some chopped green onions to give it a little something.  Next time I am going to try adding a clove of garlic.....combining a couple recipes together.

'Eggcellent'! They were the hit of my party. I did what another reviewer said about placing the eggs on their side to get them perfectly centered and it seemed to really work. Thanks for sharing everyone!

PERFECT.  This is my first time making deviled eggs and these taste exactly like deviled eggs are supposed to taste.  I halved the salt like others suggested and they are just perfect.  Wont try any other recipes after this one.  Tastes better than my grandmas:)

Very good, however a bit too salty.  Next time I will start off with 1/4 tsp of salt, taste and go from there.

Sooooooooooooo good I was thinking it wasnt my style but as i was putting them together and doing my "taste test" it was hard to stop eating. I definitely recommend this recipe. i didnt follow it to a t because i read it was a little runny so i added all the ingredients except the mayo then little by little i added it.

I made these this morning and I thougt they were a little too savory so I added some sweet pickle relish, about two tablespoons.  I think they are awsome with that addition.  I would make them again if I ever must make deviled eggs but I've decided I'm hard boiled egg peeling challenged.  I've tried all the tips I've heard of and still mangled most of the eggs.  I ended up with about 5 pristine halves  Good stuff though.

I made these for a party, and they were all gone at the end of the night. They were tasty, but the consensus was that they were a little too sweet. I'm still on the hunt for the perfect recipe!

Just finished making these and we loved them! I used a roasted garlic prepared mustard and WOW! As per the other reviews, I only used a dash of salt and it was enough! Basically, my 5 year old helped in making them and did most of it herself so you know that they are easy! Well worth making! Keep in mind, the older the eggs, the easier to peel!

These were very good and had that zing from the vinegar that I love so much. I added a little extra mayo and mustard because it was still a little too stiff.

This is the first review I have ever written and I am doing so for a good reason. I have now made these twice, following the recipe EXACTLY the first time and the second time cut down on the salt, and they have turened out way too salty both times! I don't know if I will use this again.

This recipe was very good. I like using Dijon Mustard instead of yellow mustard. If you want the basic deviled eggs, this recipe would do it!!!  Thanks.

I made these for my family's reunion in May.  Normally, my grandmother is the only one who brings devilled eggs, but this recipe beat hers - WOW!  My eggs were all gone before hers.  this is a permanent addition to my recipe box!

Absolutely the BEST deviled eggs I've ever had! It's so easy to make, I use this recipe everytime my eggs are about to expire. The only thing I do differently is to add a tsp of relish and cut back on the salt, as others have noted.

I followed the recipe and it was WAY TOO SALTY.  I could not even serve these eggs to my guests and I definitely didn't eat them myself.  I would suggest a pinch of salt or 1/8 tsp at the most.

I reduced salt to 1/8 tsp instead of ½ tsp which was originally called for per other reviewers’ advice. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly with Cayenne Pepper in place of paprika for a more spicy flavour. Found consistency of final egg mixture a bit watery, so cannot pipe out professionally-looking deviled eggs as I had hoped for. Also, some egg yolks did not center properly (albeit my horizontal position in egg-case at room temperature hours prior to hard-boiling per advised). Otherwise, deviled eggs tasted so excellent… more so when patiently waited till next day. So, a 4-star for you!!

Waaaay too salty!  I thought that was a lot of salt when I was making them, but put it in anyways.  Definitely would cut the salt amount in half!  Otherwise they were good.

I just made these for Easter dinner, they are gone!  My husband gobbled them up.  I added a dash of Old Bay seasoning to the mixture and topped with paprika.  I only added a dash of salt, and my husband thought they were a bit salty.  I didn't think they were salty at all.  I'll be making this again and again and again!  A keeper!

CAUTION: WAY TOO MUCH SALT and I love salt. I doubled the recipe and didn't take the time to read very far into the reviews to see other comments Re: salt.  I'm making these for Easter and cannot serve to my guests b/c they are overly salty. I will make again tonight with salt and white vinegar to taste.  Otherwise, a great recipe!

This is exactly like my family recipe except mine is made to taste.  You're looking for a bit of bite from the mustard and vinegar while it's still sweet and creamy with the mayo and sugar.

I would give this recipe 4.5 actually. My biggest complaint is the salt. I found it WAY too much. Even my boyfriend who is a big fan of salt and adds it to everything said they were too salty for him. The recipe is really good but next time I would use only half of the salt.

Good base recipe, though fairly mild tasting. I liked the addition of the white vinegar for a bit of zing, and I did cut back on salt based on previous reviews. I prefer some additional texture to my filling, so I added a tablespoon or so of (not-sweet) dill pickle relish, and that helped quite a bit. This will be my standard base recipe from now on. Thanks!

Better the next day.  First impression when I tasted immediately after preparing was that I prefer deviled eggs made with pickle relish.  When I tried them the next day, they were much better.  Decided to add recipe to my keeper file.

Very good, a little salty, I didn't have regular mustard, so I used dijon.  Next time I'll reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. or so.

A hit!  A great snack and appetizer.  I hardboiled a dozen eggs and doubled all the ingredients and added 2 teaspoons of sweet pickle relish.  Great to keep in an egg saver in the refrigerator to grab for a quick snack in the evening.

These were very good. Though I used 2 dashes of worcestershire sauce in place of 3 other ingredients: salt, vinegar & sugar (this reduced ingredients and made for a similar flavor).  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed to enhance flavor and I added a tidbit  more of both mayo and prepared mustard.

I searched for recipes for devilled eggs after following a recipe for them on the back of a dry mustard jar, which turned out horrible (ugh!) It was such a relief to find and try this recipe, which turned out infinitely better! Very yummy and good. I've made three batches so far, the last of which I took to a family New Year's gathering, and my family all enjoyed them as well. The only modification I made was to take out the salt, and maybe use a tad less sugar if using a sweet mayonnaise, like Miracle Whip. Thanks for the great recipe!

Recipe was over all good, but it seemed too salty in the end. I would just use a tiny pinch of salt in replacement of 1/2 a teaspoon. It didn't seem to have that deviled egg feel overall. :)

Yum!  We love deviled eggs.  We did add a little more mayo because we like them a little more creamy.  Also subbed dijon for prepared mustard.  Will make again.  Thanks.  Maybe with a little less sugar next time as they were almost too sweet for our tastes.  But still very good.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful. My seven year old son "loves" deviled eggs, and he thought these were great!

These were good. Many of my guests commented they were surprised by the sweet but didn't seem to love it. So if I were to make this recipe again, I would reduce the sugar. I followed the recipe exactly - doubled.

Probaby the best I've ever made or had! Mom always made it with pickles, so I had to add a few chopped for the crunch factor. But it was wonderful before!

This recipe was quite good, although I did find that I needed to double the mayonnaise in order to get the right consistency.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written, and everyone enjoyed the result.

Very easy recipe to make and my kids and wife loved them.  Just like my Mom used to make.  Just slowly add the salt to taste and you should have no problems like those stated earlier.  Also took them to a BBQ for fellow firefighters and all 36 disappeared before the Burgers were ready!

Very disappointed.  Way too salty (and I only used half the salt!) and the sugar- it just was weird in deviled eggs.  I think I will stick with my Betty Crocker 1970-something cookbook for these.

Very tasty!  A bit of a zip!  I didn't have regular mayo, so I used part Miracle Whip and part no-fat mayo--it was still great.  This will be my deviled egg recipe from now on!

This is a great basic deviled egg recipe.  It was quite salty so I added a touch more mayo and the eggs were perfect.  Overall a wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these for my husband because he LOVES deviled eggs (I hate them) and he thought the vinegar flavor overpowered and absolutely ruined the whole batch. He ate one and I ended up totally throwing out the rest--what a waste!

Excellent recipe! Minus the sugar this is the recipe handed down from my family. What really makes this recipe come together is the vinegar. Would never think of making deviled eggs without it! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made these deviled eggs tonight and everyone loved them! They were very creamy. I used half a teaspoon of salt instead because I'm not a huge fan of salty foods and they were absolutely delicious. They're already almost gone!!

This eggs WERE simply delicious - however previous raters were on the money.  They are too salty.  Next time I make them, I'll cut the salt in half at least.

I made these for my work potluck and they were the first thing gone. I didn't have dry mustard on hand so I used 1 teaspoon of regular french's mustard. I love deviled eggs and this recipe adds a little extra zip to a timeless classic.

I adore deviled eggs, and have always stuck to an extremely boring recipe. I agreed to make deviled eggs for a large art party with friends, and I came searching for a good recipe. This one caught my attention for good reviews, and I have *NO* complaints. I am so excited to present these at the party to rave reviews.

did I do something wrong?  I only had rice vinegar not white vinegar and these were so salty I couldn't eat them.  I'm not sure if it was the recipe or the change I made.

Love the texture and taste and would have given 5 stars but I changed the salt to 1/8 tsp and that was perfect. I used 1 tsp splenda instead of sugar. And I think it would have been perfect with just a little relish mixed in.

They were alright, but a little too salty.  Also, they seemed to be missing something that I'm used to in deviled eggs- maybe relish?  Still good, just not the best.

I read the other reviews and used no salt, only half the sugar and vinegar and I added 1/2 tsp horseradish. Fantastic. Thanks for the recipe and for all the tips from the reviews I have the best recipe for deviled eggs.

This weekend was the first time I had ever tried to make deviled eggs and they turned out great!!!! Mother thought they were too salty and my husband thought they were great. He ate over 5 of them.  The next time I make these I will probably cut the salt in 1/2.  Happy Cooking!!!

I made this recipe because I am pregnant and craving, and I have to say that I loved it!  I did reduce the salt a little, added a little hot sauce and some chopped up dill pickle, but it was tasty on it's own, too.  I just added the other stuff because...well...I'm pregnant and craving!  :)  Definitely worth trying this one!

These were good, but salty. Next time I would cut out the salt completely.

Based on other reviews, I didn't add any salt and this was already on the salty side. It was also a bit too sweet for my taste, needs a bit more zest to it. It's not a bad flavor, really just depends on your preference.

I've had many different variations of deviled eggs but these are definitely the best. The only thing I did differently was that I used white wine vinegar.

I took these eggs to a brunch and they were a hit. I cut the salt to a few shakes but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I made these today and I loved them. I love deviled eggs but I am picky about the taste. This was the first time I ever made deviled eggs and they were wonderful! Very easy recipe.

My Grandmother used to make deviled eggs with sweet relish in them.  This reminds me of that due to the vinegar and sugar, but without the crunch.  My 3 year old daughter helped me, and had a great time making and eating them.  

I just added a pinch of salt, as there seemed enough saltiness with the mustard.  I also used the heart healthy Smart Balance mayo, and I was very pleased with the results. I'd describe them as sweet with a touch of tang

I made these for Easter dinner and cut the salt back to 1/4 t and also added 1 T of horseradish sauce for added zing.  They were the first dish to disappear and everyone asked if the Easter Bunny had hidden any more around the house!

I am in charge of bringing the deviled eggs each year at Easter.  This year I thought I'd try an actual recipe instead of my standard mayo, mustard and salt to taste technique.  I liked the vinegar but it was way too salty for my taste.  I made 30 eggs (60 halves) and reduced the salt by half and it was still a bit too salty for me.  I also didn't really care for the sugar.  Guess I have pretty bland taste.

These turned out too salty for our tastes.  Enough so that we didnt care for them.  Aside from that, a basic recipe.

I thought these weren't very good but everyone at our superbowl party thought they were fine. Which is not as good as great and definitely not as good as excellent. So, I will be looking for another deviled egg recipe.

These were definitely creamy.  But, I did reduce the amount of salt from 1 tbl. to 1 tsp.  I'm bringing them to party tomorrow night.  I'll let you know how they are received.

These came out too sweet for my taste I like a spicier deviled egg.  In fairness I did change to 6 servings and it increased the sugar, next time I will skip the sugar and add paprika in the egg mix.
