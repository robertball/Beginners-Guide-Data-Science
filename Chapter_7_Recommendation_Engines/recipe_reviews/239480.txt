OMG this is addictive!  A must try for fall flavors.  Heck, try it anytime, it was a hit at the football party.  I made this at home and took a small slow cooker to the gathering to keep it warm.  Then to celebrate the team win we had to try different adult beverage additives :)) One person liked brandy, two or three liked amaretto, four agreed hazelnut was the favorite. . . we all loved this, thank you cookincrazy:) for a terrific drink with or without the booze! Will make again!

The whipped topping on this is addictive. I even sprinkled a little apple spice on top. The cider though needed something. I bought some cider that seemed unusually tart. I thought this recipe might help sweeten it. The flavor didnt much change though. It was more or less just hotter. I may have to check other recipes to tweak the base or start out with a sweeter cider. Hot cider is a nice fall recipe. ty

Wow, is all I can say.  It was awesome not spiked, but when we spiked it the flavors were even better.  Try it!
