This is such an easy recipe! I cut the flour to just a 1/2cup and put a little brandy in the drippings before I added the mushroom mix. OMG!!! I served it with white rice..my husband loved it!!!

Simple and tasty, but I made a few changes.

I reduced the amount of flour and butter, and transferred the mushrooms out of the pan so I could cook the roux for longer- making it more blond than white.  Then I added some spices (basically a little Italian seasoning) and used milk and cream to turn it into a gravy before adding the mushrooms and pork back in.

Fast, easy, flavorful...what more can you ask for?  I didn't have chanterelles, so I used button mushrooms and added some beef boullion to add some flavor to the gravy.  Very good - whole family loved it!

I read the reviews and made a couple of adjustments.  First, we didn't have access to chanterelle mushroom, so we used regular button mushrooms.   We  used half the flour, and the sauce was plenty thick.  One cup would definitely be too much.   Added about 1/2 tsp of Roast Beef Better Than Bouillon to the sauce, and 2 pressed garlic cloves.   This was my son's first attempt at following a recipe to make dinner while I was at work, and it turned out awesome!

As others have stated, cut the amount of flour.  1 cup of flour turns it into sludge. Other than that, it's a great recipe.
