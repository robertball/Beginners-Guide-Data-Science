I used ground turkey in this recipe, homemade chunky marinara (I was even able to "hide" zucchini in this roll up recipe in the marinara and none of my family members could tell!) and "trim" cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I did end up using a little more mozzerella than the recipe asked for--my husband requested more cheese. Even with my substitutions, the recipe turned out fabulous and the family loved it! Good recipe. NOTE: For those of you who use a jarred sauce, be sure you taste your sauce before you add in the whole three tablespoons of white sugar. It might be a little too sweet for some.

I love this recipe when having a small dinner party.  I can put it together in the morning and bake it just be fore dinner.  I fudged the recipe a bit and put half italian sweet sausage and half ground beef and because of the sausage, I left out the sugar.  The sugar usually just brightens up the tomatos so I would make the recipe as written if I only used ground beef.  My husband loves this and so did my friends.

I really liked the concept of this recipe. It was very tasty but it was also very dry. The next time I make it I am going to try and roll up the cheese and meat and then cover the rolls in sauce to see if that makes a difference.

It was a bit too dry.  I eliminated the sugar.  I can't imagine that lasagna needs sugar.

I love this recipe!  Itâ€™s so easy to make.  The only thing I would change is double the meat and sauce.

The recipe calling for 3 Tbsp sugar was odd to me, but I followed it anyway. It was definitely quite sweet, so I will for sure leave it out next time. Aside from the sweetness, this recipe was pretty okay.

The taste was fine but keeping the meat mixture in the rollup was pretty messy and difficult. Rolling with just the cheese mixture was easier, but they seemed a little dry.  If you use only the cheese mixture, make sure you have extra sauce to pour around before baking it.

This recipe looks really good. Think I'm gonna make it for dinner tonight. I might only use one tablespoon of sugar tho. Any recipe that calls for canned or jarred tomatoes/tomato sauce requires sugar to cut down on the acidity of the tomatoes. Any Italian (which I am lol) can tell you that. 3 tablespoons seems like a lot tho.

Tasty but a little dry. Next time I'll use more sauce and only roll one noodle in each roll-up instead of two.

This was excellent!  However, it was pretty fussy getting my noodles to roll and stay that way without the cheese stuffing coming out of them.  Will stick to traditional Lasagna as it is less fussy.

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit, I wanted a basic meaty lasagna. This was my first time making lasagna (you can lay it out like the traditional or roll-up the noodles - I chose to make it the traditional way). My family and I aren't big fans of ricotta cheese or cottage cheese; so I chose not to use either.

I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef (it didn't release too much grease so I didn't drain it) - I cooked it as per the recipe. I left out the sugar and simply used a can of tomato & basil marinara sauce. For the cheese, I only used Mozzarella and the grated Parmesan. I FINELY chopped the onion. I found that the Parmesan cheese flavor was extremely strong/salty (maybe the ricotta or sugar was supposed to balance it out?). Next time I'll leave it out for just a BASIC lasagna. 

I also used a large tin foil pan, I didn't roll up the lasagna noodles, just laid them flat. I found that I needed more meaty sauce for the second layer (obviously adding more meat was a no-go, everything was cooked) so I simply added about 2-3 more tablespoons of marinara sauce (from the 2nd can) and let it simmer a bit. This solved the problem!

I would recommend eliminating the sugar completely because it causes the lasagna to have a very sweet taste. Otherwise good :)
