My boyfriend and I were craving falafel and found this recipe which had great reviews and looked fairly easy to prepare.  We decided to bake them since my deep-frying skills aren't the greatest.  They had a great crunch and were nice and soft inside.  The combined flavours tasted just like the yummy take-out ones we craved, and were a lot healthier.  This was a great recipe, thank you!

this recipe was great, i pretty much followed everything exactly as stated, with the exception that i added a whole egg to the mixture. (i did this because, like others, i noted that it seemed a bit dry.) everything held together well during the frying process, without coating it anything in flour etc. also, rather than molding the mixture into balls, i patted them into patties about the size of the circle formed when you touch the tip of your middle finger to the tip of your thumb, about an 3/4 of an inch thick. this cut down on the frying time (and absorption of oil), and made neater pita pockets :). thanks for the great recipe!

The first batch that I fried up were GREAT (didn't have cilantro, and added some finely chopped mushrooms as well), but I made the mistake of not letting the oil reheat to make the second batch.

MAKE SURE THAT THE OIL IS SUPER HOT AND THAT YOU ALLOW IT TO REHEAT TO A SUPER HOT TEMPERATURE BETWEEN BATCHES, OR ELSE THEY WILL FALL APART.

Delicious!!!  Be sure to add enough bread crumbs to make a "burger" consistency.  I fried them as burgers, put 1000 island, tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers on a hamburger bun, and had a feast!  Wonderful, thanks.

this is a great recipe! If you guys want quick, semi homemade falafel that takes about 20 minutes to make from start to finish.. buy a box of falafel mix from an ethnic food store and mix it with a can of mashed chickpeas, extra dried parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper and you have an easy, edible, quick take on a traditional favorite.

What a delicious recipe!  I've only made falafel from a mix before, but I am a changed woman!  I did have to add water to the mixture for it to hold together.  Also, roll the balls (or patties) in flour before frying.. that way they won't fall apart!

This recipe tastes great! But -like some-the bread crumbs from my falafel came out during thee frying process.  I found that a great solution for this is to bake them in a 350 degree oven for about 7 minutes on each side or until golden brown. They stay together, taste even better than fried, and are far fewer in calories. However if you do this, its a good idea to swipe them with a tad of olive oil though its not really needed.

Nice vegan recipe! Very tasty and my husband said it was the best falafel he'd ever tasted although I thought it tasted like regular falafel (which I love and is a compliment for a vegan recipe).  The recipe says it serves 6 but for my family (myself, my husband and my three year old son) I had to double the recipe and had only 3 falafel balls left.  When frying I had to dump the oil between the first and second batches because the falafel balls crumbled a bit in the oil.  To solve this problem next time I think I'll put them in the oven which will cut alot of the fat too.  I served them in a pita with tomatoes and tahini sauce with ketchup and had a side of roasted potatoes.  Very yummy!!!

I made a few changes, I didn't have cilantro and the only bread crumbs I had were seasoned and I also added about 1/4 cup water and one beaten egg.  These came out great and I did not have the problem of them falling apart while frying.

We followed the recipe pretty much exactly; we had just under the amount of chickpeas.  We also pan fried them like burgers instead of deep fry.  There was a little falling-apart-age, we added a little oil in the balls and less in the pan to help keep them together more.

As far as taste goes, this was pretty good. Very cumin-y,and unlike any falafel I have had before.  Will probably make it again with a few tweaks.  Thanks.

My beans might have been too moist, but my falafels just disintergrated in the oil.  The taste and smell were great though.

Oh holy moly - my first foray into the world o'falafels and I.am.hooked.  My husband and I didn't even allow them to make it into the pitas I bought - we just stood at the stove and ate them plain (although I added some tahini to mine towards the end. Yum.)  I followed directions almost exactly, just leaving out the cilantro due to a rather picky, cilantro-hating better half (is he really the better half if he hates cilantro?  Hehe.)  He immediately informed me that these need to make frequent appearances for dinner and then went to the kitchen to scrounge the leftover crumbs left on the plate.  I already want to make them again.  Like, tonight, less than 24 hours after my inaugural batch.

Is your falafel falling apart? Add 1-2 tablespoons of flour and it will be OOOOKAY! Tried this recipe 2 other times and failed, flour was the trick. Did a shallow fry. Great recipe, maybe add 2tbs of lemon juice and another clove or 3 of garlic :)

Amazing falafel! Sometimes, if the mixture is not sticking very well, I just add a little bit of water. I also have used this same recipe and baked them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes on both sides and it was fantastic. Just have to make the balls more as patties so they cook all the way through.

YUM! The spice combination is the perfect flavor! I love it when I can throw all my ingredients into a food processor and be half way done! Went a healthier route and baked the falafel instead. Took 25 minutes at 350 (turning every 10) for a crispy brown outside. Stuffed the falafel in a pita with lettuce and tomato with a light champagne dressing and now my boyfriend thinks I'm a genius! Thank you so much for sharing! These are delicious!

Great Recipe!! I altered it a bit for my taste...BEST Falafel I have ever eaten!!  I added 1 beaten egg, juice from 1/2 a lemon and they held together great..I added green onion and left out cilantro and dried parsley.  Great base recipe you can "tweek" to fit your taste!

The seasoning on this recipe is good, but I highly recommend using dry garbanzo beans, soaking them overnight, and then grinding them in a food processer. This makes the falafel more crunchy and textured instead of the mushy version that using canned garbanzo beans will produce.

After watching in horror as my first perfectly formed batch of falafel completely disintegrated into the (very hot) oil, I was ready to give this a vindictive-one star; but then I regrouped, added an egg AND used flour just to be on the safe side. They fried perfectly in the pan after that! I did not have turmeric or cumin so I substituted a little dry mustard and garam masala which added some interesting flavor that I'm not sure I want to repeat. I used the food processor to mix everything which cut down on prep time. Will definitely make this again with the right spices and an egg. Might put some bread crumbs on the outside to give it some extra crunch?

I made these exactly as directed, with one crucial tip between steps 1 and 2: Freeze the falafel balls before frying. Just a couple hours in the freezer, then just throw them in the oil, no defrosting necessary. This helps the balls to keep shape without disintegrating in the oil (I do the same with Chinese fried spring rolls!). I kept them in the oil, flipping once until just brown on the outside (about 2 minutes), then stuck in the oven at 150C for 15-20 minutes to heat them through. Nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and flavourful on the inside!! Delicious!!!

Very good and easy to make although I did add an egg to bind them together a bit.  I also used only half the cumin since my husband isn't a big fan of it.  They turned out great.  Thanks for introducing a new meat substitute to my dinner table!

The mix was easy to prepare, and I always appreciate eggless recipes.  But unfortunately, they fell apart in the oil.  I've tried this twice, and it happened both times.  In reading the reviews, I'm clearly not the only one who had this problem.  So, perhaps this is an issue that should be addressed somewhere in the instructions -- how do you prevent them from falling apart?

These falafel taste AMAZING! Probably the best that I've ever had. I am new to fried foods, and when I made the mistake of not waiting for my pan-fried oil to reheat between batches, the falafel came out pale and fell apart. But the ones that I did right are crisp and attractive.

This is my go-to falafel recipe. It seems to be necessary to add an egg to the recipe, though, or else you run the danger of your falafel disintegrating in the frying pan. Fresh herbs make a world of difference, but the falafel is still tasty without them. I usually pat the falafel circles flat and pan-fry them in a thin layer of olive oil. I've tried baking them but they aren't as flavourful.

I used panko.  I needed to use a food processor.  It wouldn't stay together otherwise.    I ran the food processor until the dough balled up, like bread dough.  Then I used a 1 1/2 inch melon-baller to create the balls.  I needed to add about 4 tablespoons of water.  It was delicious!  Cooked very, very fast.  Don't walk away.

This was delicious!  I served it as a 'wrap' in a tortilla (ran out of pitas) with lettuce, tomato & tahini sauce.   The changes I made: used more cilantro/parsley and added some coriander.  I added breadcrumbs tablespoon at a time til I reached the consistency I wanted (took about 5 TBS), so they were not too dry.  I think 1 cup is a lot!  I whirled it up in the food processor, then put the mix in the fridge for about an hour.  Rolled them up in balls and put them in my cast iron pan with just a bit of oil. I squished them flat with my hand so they looked like silver dollar pancakes. I pan fried them at medium heat til done.  If you have big eaters then double the recipe; my husband and I ate about 6 of these apiece but they are so yummy I need to go lock up the leftovers so I don't eat the rest up myself!    The tahini is a must: 1 garlic clove, 1 tsp salt, 3/4 c. tahini, 1 tsp. cumin, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 1/2-1 cup of water.  Mix up to the lemon juice in the food processor, then add water til it's smooth and runny enough to pour.

Pretty good! All I had in the cupboard was a bag of dried garbanzos and some odds and ends, but I was able to turn it into falafel! I used chicken stock instead of water to get the right consistency. I rolled them into 12 balls and fried them in a couple inches of olive oil, 3 minutes per side. Served them with tahini sauce made from tahini, lemon juice, water, garlic, parsley, cumin, and sweet curry powder.

Great taste, but mine fell apart. I baked them instead of frying, next time I will try frying them and see if it works out any better.

Loved this recipe! First time I tried making homemade falafel, and I will definitely keep this one. I added 1/2 cup of water to help it stick together, but that was the only thing I changed. I also followed someone else's suggestion of mixing mayo & Sriracha sauce (a.k.a. rooster sauce) for dipping, which was great, but the falafel was flavorful enough to eat plain.

These are really good. If you find your falafel falls apart when you try to fry it, put the dough in the fridge for a few hours and then roll and fry. You can also roll them in a little flour, too, which helps them hold their shape in the oil.

Very good in taste, but mine wouldn't stay together, and I didn't fry them . . .I used my slow cooker (seriously, it works).  Still tasty, and worth making but I have to agree that it needs an egg.  (I added water instead when it seemed crumbly bc I didn't want to add an egg, but that didn't work very well).    how to make them okay for people who can't have eggs or are vegan or whatever, I can't say, but I'll try an egg next time.  otherwise, very nice flavor and a good falafel.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love to surprise my family with "Josie's test kitchen" recipes. This was my first try making falafel's and they came out great. Pan fried in olive oil and had to add just a little water to hold them together. Served them in pitas with tzitki, lettuce & tomato. Thanks for a sucessful Josie's test kitchen meal the family really enjoyed this.

Sorry but authentic falafel doesn't used cooked garbanzo beans, certainly not canned cooked garbanzo beans.  Use dry beans soaked in water for at least 12 hours.  Don't cook them!  They get cooked when you fry them.  And why bother with the dried parsley?  It has practically no flavor.  Fresh parsley is the way to go here and use plenty.    
Using the dried, raw, soaked garbanzo beans will make this recipe almost useless because the quantities will be off.  There are plenty of recipies that use dried garbanzos.  I would eliminate/reduce the bread crumbs and add ground corriander seed.  What this recipe produces may taste ok but it isn't authentic and it will have a very different texture from a properly made falafel ball.  Youtube has a huge number of falafel recipes that show you step by step how to do it.  Unfortunately even a few of those use canned, cooked garbanzos.

Everyone in the family loved these.  We usually buy the box mix and add water, but had trouble finding the mix at our local store, so I decided it was time to make homemade.  This was easy and tasted very good.  I did end up adding an egg, and some water, to make it come together better, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was my first attempt at making falafel from scratch and it was okay. I think it is probably a great base recipe and I will try it again with seasoning adjustments as I found it a little bland.
However, I did bake it instead of fry it and that may have given it less flavor.
I added in a mix of 1T ground flax with 3T water as an egg replacer and it held together really well.
Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will definitely give it another try one of these days.

These were yummy but very messy to make.  Everything was neat and tidy until the frying started.  I don't have a deep fryer so I used the stove... many of them fell apart during the frying process and I felt like I was losing gold. I'll make a couple of adjustments next time, mainly baking them instead of frying by lining a baking sheet with foil, brushing oil on the sheet/foil, forming small patties instead of balls and brushing the tops with oil.  Bake for 15 - 20 minutes, flipping halfway between to prevent burning.  Healthier and cleaner.

This is very crumbly, I added 1 egg, still pretty loose and dry.  Maybe needed another egg?  Taste was great though.  Some patties held together, some fell apart.

Fantastic falafel recipe! I bake these at 350 for about 15 minutes instead of frying. They are a bit dry, so I add a bit of water or vegetable broth if I have it handy. Sometimes I cut the cumin back and add garam masala. I may add some shredded carrot, too. These are great topped with tamarind chutney!

I liked it and will make again with the addition of a lot more garlic, more turmeric, fresh parsley and a little less salt. I formed the rolls Jeanie suggested, put them on a lightly oiled baking pan, smashed them down slightly with the back of a spoon, brushed with olive oil and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes, flipping halfway through..they did crisp up a bit and stayed soft on the inside...definitely not the same as frying but very tasty all the same. I did use an egg as others suggested as well as I squeezed about half of a lemon into the mix...really brightened it up.

Great recipe! I used a 15 oz can of garbanzo beans because that is all that I could find. I kept the spices pretty much the same, and used just a bit less onion and bread crumbs. I baked the falafel instead of frying. I just put olive oil on a pan, brushed the tops of the falafel with olive oil and baked at 375 for 12 minutes on each side. Came out delicious! I served them with pita, tzatziki sauce, onion, spinach, and tomato.

Great, flavourful falafels! The only change I made was to fry them just for a minute on each side for colour and then baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. You could also just grease the pan for a lighter colour. I will do this next time and there will definately be a next time!

Wish I had seen that last review before I made these!  Used my deep fryer and not only did the balls disintegrate, they made the oil bubble up and overflow!!!  Flattened a few balls into a patty and fried (not deep fried!) in a pan to get a crispy coat.  Pretty tasty.  Will add egg(s) as others suggested today and try again.

These were good but were missing something. I will definitely make them again, and not when I am in a rush! Maybe I forgot to add something! Instead of deep frying, I used a muffin tin and baked at 375 for maybe a half hour. I put a bit of oil in the bottom each cup to crisp them up. A little more oil than just a brush, but not too much. I put maybe a half inch in one cup by accident and the falafel disintegrated. My dinner guests enjoyed them!

These were yummy and easy to make, I would add 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a pinch of cayenne. I enjoyed not adding the egg, but make sure the oil is super hot before putting them in, and let them brown before flipping so they won't fall apart. Also use the  sauce (garlic pepper) in the pita with diced tomatoes and lettuce.
Definitely make tzatziki sauce (1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup sour cream, peeled-seeded and grated cucumber,2 cloves garlic-minced, 1 tbsp parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Very easy and very delicious! I used a suggestion left by a previous reviewer and added 1 egg white to the mix. I also ended up having to add about 1 tablespoon of water to get the patties to hold together enough to convince me they wouldn't fall apart when I cooked them. They were crispy, crunchy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside. Perfect! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Throw these on a pita with some thinly sliced red onion, chopped tomato, a little romaine, a sprinkle of feta, and a healthy dollup of tzatziki sauce....YUMMY!

Delicious mix of spices, but I had to add an egg because the mixture wouldn't stick... also added a spritz of lemon juice. Baked in the oven at 350F, drizzled in olive oil to get a crispy exterior.

This falafel is delicious, and tastes exactly the way falafel should taste. I left the onion out (chopped onion in falafel just doesn't sound right to me), put in 1/2 tsp. garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves, sprinkled some ground black pepper instead of the cracked peppercorns and  didn't use cilantro and parsley because I didn't have any. I added a little bit of water so that the batter would hold together better. I don't own a deep fryer, so I fried them in a regular frying pan (I shaped the falafel more like a patty than a ball) and they came out delicious and didn't crumble at all. Everyone loved them, and I will definately make this recipe again(with the changes I made), but will try adding cilantro and parsley next time,even though the falafel is delicious w/o them.

Absolutely amazing falafel.  I think my husband has never loved anything quite this much.  He can't stop talking about it and directed me to give it a "9 out of 5 stars" on the site.   I found the "25 minutes prep" to be a bit off.  I've made this twice and the first time I mashed the garbanzo beans by hand, which took FOREVER.  It took me about 50 minutes just to prep the mix.  The second time I made the recipe, I just tossed the beans, cilantro and onion in a food processor and prep magically dropped to ten minutes.  I added an egg as a binder, they fell apart without it.  Overall a fantastic, delicious recipe.

This was so good! I added an egg and served it with whole wheat pitas and tzaziki sauce.  My whole family loved it including my son who usually doesn't like my vegetarian cooking.

These tasted delicious, however, I had to add a little bit of flour to keep them from falling apart.  Other than that, I made as stated.  Would make again...with the addition of a little flour.  :)

Nope.  Didn't work.  Too dry, and too much cumin.  I added an egg and it still didn't help.  Will try adding much less bread crumbs and see if that helps.

Excellent recipe for falafel. 
I have tried the dried mix a few times in the past. 
Disaster... never again.  Nothing compares to fresh 
I have to admit I added an egg white to the mix and this made it a 4 star with fresh parsley. 
Second round I added a tsp of fresh lemon juice and halved the amount of homemade breadcrumbs.

Great recipe. Served on a fresh naan with some  parsley tomato cucumber mix and a yoghurt lemon dill dressing ... delish.

OMG I made this tonight and it was so good! I pretty much stuck to the recipe with a few minor adjustments - I sautéed the onion, garlic and added jalapeno. I added 2 eggs to the mix.  I baked them at 350 for about 8 mins on each side! Served them in pita pockets with hummus, tomatoes, cucumber, and carrot match sticks. SO GOOD! This is going to be a staple meal in my recipe box from now on :)

Tasted great, but even adding water to get them to hold together didn't save my falafel - they fell apart in the deep fryer. We salvaged what we could and ate that.

These were delectable. The only adjustment I made was to add an egg to hold it together, which was definitely necessary since I used beans I cooked from dry rather than canned. My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't make more!

Fantastic recipe! It tasted amazing esp when I added my home made tzaziki to it and just patties for burger buns instead of pita bread (got lots of burger buns no pita go figure).
Though I don't understand why the egg is ommitted. I don't see the point unless you're allergic. Whenever I do patties of any kind ESP if its vegetarian I have to do an egg otherwise its too dry and if you add water the texture is just right and a single egg fixes that. Its only an egg - its not going to bite you lol

Decent recipe but it fell apart while frying my first batch.  This recipe needs a binding agent.  I am not vegan so I used egg whites and the rest came out perfect!

Delicious! First time, the falafel totally fell apart in the oil :(. So next time I added an egg to the mixture (which helped with the firmness), and after forming the falafel balls, I put them in the fridge for 10-20 mins. Now it's great. Make sure the oil is hot before you start cooking!

I always follow a recipie exactly before making any changes. I really wanted Falafel as I had them recently in a trip to Europe. I cook alot an am always making new things for the family. I had the oil at a hot temperture and they still just fell apart and just literally melted into the oil- the whole mess of oil and falafel.

I normally buy boxed falafel but decided to try something new last night, so happy I did!!  This recipe is absolutely delicious!!!!  The only thing I added was an egg, it did help it from falling apart when frying.  Also, it is very important to let the oil reheat between batches.  YUMMY!!!

I used 3/4 cup bread crumbs and subbed Italian seasoning for dried parsley.  Also cooked in olive oil to make it healthier.  This was fantastic.  We eat falafels from box mix or at restaurants, but this is the best I have had.  Very easy.  I did use a food processor on pulse for the chick peas until very small grain sized chunks but before smooth, then seperately pulsed onion with cilantro, adding to the bowl with mixed dry ingredients.  Perfect texture and flavor and so quick.

mine totally fell apart in the oil. the tiny bit that did stick together I tried and it was tasty, however this recipe definetly needs a binding agent to be added. Also the recipe needs to include that the chickpeas need to be dried because the ones from the can give it a very wet structure.

I mixed everything in my food processor, it turned out great. super easy. My husband ate it like it actually had meat in it. :) I made it once the way the recipe states and it was a crumbly mess in the pan. I made a second batch and added one egg. It made all the difference. it held together beautifully. I fried in a skillet with a little coconut oil.

these were yummy. I followed the recipe but used fresh parsley and coriander as i didnt have cilantro on hand. I also baked them instead, by spraying them lighlty with PAM-olive oil spray. Came out yummy although dont hold together too well. Next time I half the amount of breadcrumbs and might add some egg to help them stick togehter.

Yum, this was great. I added an egg just to be safe. I'm sure it would have been fine without it and just adding water. I baked mine jsut cause I didn't want a smelly house. 400 for 20mins flipped halfway and broiled for a few mins as another person suggested. My 7yr loved them too. But then again he eats anything :)

These are very easy and quick to make. They even taste good without some of the ingredients (if your cupboards a little bare, like mine). Are a little soggy and dry when reheated though.

This makes a great falafel. I added one egg and then added water as needed in order to make it stay together. If I had not added water it definitely would have fallen apart. Left out the cilantro and parsley. I recommend using a food processor to mash the beans and garlic, and then stir in the finely diced onion. My food processor completely pulverizes onion, so I just dice it and stir it into whatever I am making.

Hadn't ever made falafels from scratch, and decided to use this recipe because it was egg-less. However, I did use corn meal in place of the bread crumbs as some other recipes do. The first couple did not hold together too great until I started really packing the balls firmly with a melon baller. Worked great! Will definitely be making these again.

I've been making falafels from a box mix for a long time, but I wanted to try a from-scratch version. My family loved this recipe! I used dry garbanzo beans that I prepared myself instead of canned beans. The final mixture was too dry and crumbly to hold together, but I saw that another reviewer had suggested adding an egg. Since I don't use eggs, I added egg replacer instead, and I also added some water. With those additions, the mixture was perfect. To make it healthier, I fried the patties without oil. Big hit. I served them with baba ghanouj, hummus, cucumber dill sauce, homemade pita chips, and salad.

The flavor of these are good, but they totally disentergrated when they hit the oil. It was a hot, oily mess!! So I salvaged what I could and baked them off in the oven. Don't use regular vegetable oil! Use a lighter oil like peanut, safflower or even olive oil.

It smelled great! But we are currently waiting for our pizza to arrive. All the balls disintegrated in the oil. Now, I've never deep fried anything, so I might have done something wrong with the oil, but yeah...what a bust.

I have made this recipe three times now, and every time all my friends love it!!!!  The third time I put also lime zest of one lime and some juice, because of the juice i was going to be a little bit watery I add a tablespoon of flour.  The juice definitely brings the flavor of the cilantro and it gives a fresh taste.

Very simply, they did not turn out well. Maybe I didn't use enough water, but after a few seconds in the frying pan, each falafel fell apart. We try to salvage them, but it was a disaster.

Awesome! These are as flavorful as falafel in Israel. I made these for the second time tonight for dinner. Last time I had a problem with my chickpeas not mashing well enough (I couldn't get the chunks to go away no matter how long I kept mashing). This time, I started out using my Pampered Chef Food Chopper to get them finely diced. Then I mashed them. Much better consistency this time. I tried baking them, as someone else suggested. Definitely helped with the fat content and hardly affected the taste! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I just finished a batch, straight out of the deep fryer - crisp and nutty on the outside, warm, moist and savory on the inside. This is the BEST! A couple came apart, but I added some water to the mix and the rest held together beautifully.

ok so i just made this with my sis, it is soo good!  made about 18-24 little falafels and common its chick peas they are bound to fall apart so a suggestion is to make sure the oil is reallyy really hott so it will brown quickly and wont fall apart.  great with humus and and cucumber salad :-)

I made a few changes and it still turned out fantastic! I cut the parsley, used dried cilantro, and used cumin seed instead of ground cumin. Then I baked them on a cookie sheet instead of frying at 375 for 25 minutes. Yummy!

OMG!! This was fantastic!  I made this for the first time for a vegetarian friend and she just raved about it (the meatatarians loved it too)(:  I added a little too much water, fortunately I had some dry mix to bring it back to the right consistency.  I made the mixture the night before and cooked it the next day.  I did not need any egg, shaped into patties and cooked it in my deep fryer.  Reheated in the oven the next day, still tasted great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I personally loved this recipe!  I added some water to help them stay together as mentioned.  I have a 13 yr old "food inspector" that is a picky eater.  He gave it 4 stars. This is key as I am slowly trying to make the transition to vegan eating for our family.  Great recipe!

this recipe tasted good, but they were not as firm and compacted as I am used to- I may have messed them up by using panko bread crumbs. I also added fresh parsley instead of dry and a pinch of cayenne- the flavor tasted pretty strong before I pan-fried them, but didn't taste as strong after they were cooked so if you want a spicy falafel add more seasoning- Overall this is a good base recipe to spice up if you like.

My first time ever making falafel.  I did cheat and add an egg to help hold everything together, per some of the reviews, but I think it would have held ok without it.  I also pulsed the beans in the food processor to mash them; worked great, then discovered I didn't have any turmeric, so I skipped it.  We ended up eating them straight off the platter, and all commented that they tasted like "Mediterranean hushpuppies".  Don't know if that's how they should be, but they were great.  Will definitely make again, and try without the egg to bind it.

The core recipe is great- just need to adjust to increase moistness... the texture was a little dry.

LOVED THIS! I gave it 4 stars because the mix was a bit crumbly. I added an egg so the patties would stay together better when fried. They were delicious! 5 stars for taste. I'm going to the store tonight to get more chickpeas. :) Thanks for the recipe!

My vegetarian husband loved these!  We thought the flavor was better than what we've had at a Persian restaurant.  I also added a table spoon of wheat germ to the mixture.  The kids tried them(tentatively) and thought they were pretty good too. I will be making these again for sure!

This was good. I used fresh parsley instead of cilantro, and I added a little water because it was crumbly (I was doing it in a food processor). If you do this, don't be tempted to add water; falafel is not fried mush balls, like mine, it should have texture. I think this is why a food processor is not used. Oh, I added coriander too.

I have never heard of tumeric in falafel and authentic falafel always has tahini in it which is a sesame paste. My falafel balls fell apart in cooking; simply disintegrated into a pile of oily crumbs. Other recipes I have read say you need to add some flour otherwise this happens. I think I'll just stick to a falafel mix.

Didn't have any cilantro (coriander) leaves so added mint, and lemon juice to moisten it with a little olive oil. shallow fried them too and came out fine but would imagine they would be a lot crispier deep fried. Made 8 small burgers about 2inches by 1/2 inch, perfect for us 2 served in pittas with salad and a corn-on-the-cob on the side. Very nice would make these again. Thanks x

The flavor is fantastic in this recipe! The mixture was dry so I did add a little water per the recipe and that helped it to stick. The first batch I made turned out great, the second was much lighter in color and slightly fell apart. The third and final batch completely fell apart and became mush. Instead of falafel pitas, I made a falafel-esque salad with lettuce, tomatoes, tzatziki sauce and the "mush." Still tasted great. I'll try baking it next time like a few reviews suggested.

These are SOOOOOOOOO good!!!  I did have to add water to make them stick together and probably should have used more than I did because they were a little on the crumbly side after cooking but still WOW!!

I followed the recipe and when I put them in my deep fryer, they completely disintegrated and the crumbs burned in the fryer. I threw them out and am making pasta instead. They need eggs as a binding agent.

Loved this, with a few modifications. First I used my food processor and added an egg. It was still a little dry, so I did add a little olive oil to get it to blend. Next time, I'll add 2 eggs as I'd prefer the moisture come from them.  The flavor is outstanding!

The falafels tasted quite good, but no matter what I tried, the balls fell apart in the fryer. I lost quite a bit because of that. I would love suggestions on how to make the falafel balls hold together while frying.

Excellent! Mine held together quite well even though I didn’t need all the bread crumbs. I did use gluten free ones, though. Thank you for the recipe.

I've used this recipe multiple times and love it. I usually add one egg so it doesn't fall apart when frying. I omit the baking powder because I thought that was the culprit in my oil bubbling over (only happens towards the last two batches of frying). But it wasn't the baking powder. Anyhow, this is an awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good, and I'm Greek, so I know good Mediterranean food.  However, I baked them at 400F for 30 minutes instead of frying them. They came out great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Served them on a warm pita with homemade tzatziki, tomatoes, cucumbers.

When blending in the food processor, I added the beans last, then mixed at high speed until the mix started to get hot and clump together. I think this is the trick to make them stay together and not fall apart.

I made this twice. First I deep fried them and most just fell apart. I tried to fry them on the skillet and those too fell apart. So I read some reviews and then added one egg and dipped them in flour before frying on a skillet. Success. I did include tumeric and red crushed pepper and cayenne pepper.

The flavour is great, but if the oil temperature drops even a little bit, they disintegrate in the pan.  Good in theory, but needs a binder like egg to keep them together

Taste is good but completely falls apart once it hits hot oil. Once I saw that was hapening, I started using wet hands to make the balls and then coating with a dusting of flour to get it to hold its shape in the oil and that seemed to help the balls retain their shape.

Very good! I had never had falafel, and both my husband and I loved it. I baked the falafel instead of frying it. I baked it on 375 degrees until the outsides were crispy. Put them on pita bread with mayo, tomatoes and lettuce, yummy!!

This was amazing! I did not add cilantro because my husband dislikes it. 
I added an egg and I baked it in the oven for approx. 20 min until brown at 350ºF.

I wish I would have read the reviews of this recipe before I tried it because I had the same problem as a lot of other people...the balls completely disintegrated in my deep fryer :( The mixture was really tasty and thankfully I had half the balls I made left and baked them in the oven...definitely needs eggs to keep it all together!

You don’t have to be a vegetarian to enjoy how delectable these are. The Falafel is meaty and it also has very rich flavors. I loved these! They are so delicious and easy to make so please give these a try!

While the mixture might be worthy the process is not.  The "balls" of falafel will totally disintegrate.  Instead, form them into patties (like the picture) and use a shallow fry pan.

I thought these were great.  The sauce was good.  I added fresh garlic to it.  My husband did not like the cucumber taste, but liked the falafel.  I lightly fried these then baked at 400 for about 20 min.  Came out crunchy and good.

Made these today.  Very very good.  Since I've only had restaurant-made falafel once before and have nothing else to compare to, these were quite pleasing.  Better than the one I had from the restaurant.   Took others suggestions and added egg and coated in flour before frying.  Don't own a deep fryer, so I pan-fried them as patties on medium heat.  I didn't have any problems AT ALL with them falling apart or disintegrating in the oil. I fried half the batter and baked the other (pan was sprayed with cooking spray - 350F for 10 min on each side and didn't coat with flour). I did however put the batter in the fridge for a little over an hour as someone suggested.  I doubled the recipe and it made 20 patties the size of hamburgers.  The only suggestion I have is to add more salt.  I'm sure I added more than what the recipe called for and still I found it could use more.  Ate them as is and they were great and filling.

I’ve never made falafel before, but this recipe looked easy enough for my limited skills. I left out the onions because I just don’t like them and the breadcrumbs because I didn’t have any. I added a spoonful of greek yogurt to help the balls hold together. I also baked them instead of frying (preheated oven to 400, cooked for 10 mins, rolled em over for 10 more mins, and then broiled for 2 minutes to get them crispy on top). Served in a whole wheat tortilla with a little sauce that I made from ½ cup greek yogurt and ½ teaspoon of dill. This was tasty and easy. My boyfriend asked me to make them again.

I actually added one egg to keep it together. I used fresh parsley and added ground coriander seeds. I sauteed them to get a brown crust and then finished them in the oven at 350 degrees. Amazing!!

I was very lucky to fried the first 3 falafels to check how they were coming and I saw my falafels disappearing in front of my eyes... so you MUST add 2 small eggs or the falafels will disappear in the frying process...
You also can reduce the salt using only 1/2 of teaspoon...
However, the taste is SUPERIOR, the flavors are just perfect...

Delicious.  Was made super easy with a little deep fryer my parents had at their place.  I added chopped mushrooms, quarter cup fresh parsley, no cilantro, forgot the baking powder, extra turmeric.  Yeah, its easier with the mix, but the taste does not compare.  I also added the egg to help it stick together. The package stuff is bland and dry, these were nice consistency and lots of flavor.

We loved this super easy recipe...I did add an egg to it though which created the perfect consistency.  I also baked the Falafel because we did not want to leave it sitting in the vegetable oil!

Delicious! I didnt have an onion or all of the spices, but the combination still worked out well. I also shaped the falafel into patties and pan-fried them. I added some hot sauce for some flare and they are delicious!!

Excellent recipe. My variation:  I used Leek instead of onion, didn't have cilantro so used fresh celery leaves. I also added a little fresh jalapeno and approx. 1/4 cup egg white. Placed everything except for beans in a food processor and blended to a paste. Added the beans and continued to blend. Then I ground up 1/4c flax seed and 1/4c Salba grain (both loaded with Omega3) and added that to the paste to consistency. Fried in deep fat fryer (canola oil). If they stick, lower the temp on the oil and don't let them drain in the basket but take them out of the oil with tongs and place them on paper towels. To omit egg white, try a good egg substitute: 1 tablespoon flax seed powder and 3 tablespoons water equals 1 egg. Garnish with Soyogurt.

This was my first time making and eating falafel. I added an egg per another's suggestion and didn't act the peppercorns because I didn't have any. Ate them in pita pockets with lettuce, tomato and ranch dressing. It was very delicious!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I baked them for 20 mins at 400F instead of deep frying.  They had a nice flavor and texture.  I also made flat patties instead of little balls so they fit well inside a pita.  Will definitely make these again.

Excellent and very healthy recipe!  I agree that you can probably use a bit less bread crumbs if you do decide to double the recipe.  I used 30 oz of garbanzo beans tonight, and this served 5 adults perfectly with a few falafel for leftovers tomorrow.  Also, 1/4 large red onion was plenty, and I added less cumin and a tsp of coriander.  I also added one egg and a little Greek yogurt, and I baked falafel patties--about the size of mini burgers or sliders.  Used crushed garlic from a jar instead of fresh.  Baked at 350 or so for 10 minutes per side on a couple of cookie sheets covered with a thin layer of olive oil, and the falafel were still crispy enough on the outside without all of the grease.  Served with a modified version of Greek Veggie Salad II and sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, and baby lettuce along with tahini sauce and roasted garlic hummus on the side.  Delicious!  Also good with a sauce of Greek yogurt, a little dill and lemon juice.

This was a very good recipe. Like many reviewers, I added 1 egg to the mix (although you can just use water instead). I also added maybe 1/4 cup of water to the mix to get it to stick together (just enough to get it slightly doughy in texture). This turned out great, I would suggest either using a really small onion or maybe half of a medium one. Even finely diced, there was too much onion and it made it difficult to clump the balls together. Also like other reviewers have suggested, I think I will make patty shapes instead of balls next time, they're rather hard to fit into a pita pocket in that shape, and it's easier to fry in a pan this way. Altogether though an excellent falafel recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing Falafel. I added an egg, as other suggested, along with a bit of the liquid from the beans. I  made them into patties, rather than balls. I pan-fried half of the batch in just a bit of oil and baked half of the batch. The fried definitely had a better texture, but both tasted delicious.

I made these without reading prior reviews (perhaps a mistake) and, although we thought the flavor was great, they consistency didn't work at all.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they fell completely apart in the oil, turning into a sludge in the bottom of the oil.  We baked the remaining balls and enjoyed the yummy flavor without the fried crunch you would expect from falafel.  Perhaps an egg would solve the problem?  I might try again because the flavor was so good, but as written I can't see how the recipe can deserve five stars.

Delicious!  Definitely way too dry - I had to add 2 eggs' worth in egg replacers' plus some water.  But still so good!  Next time I'll start with 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and add as needed.  I didn't deep fry, just pan-fried in a skillet, threw them on top of lettuce and tomato and ate with creamy Italian dressing.  Such an easy, inexpensive dinner.

I altered the recipe by replacing breadcrumbs with whole wheat flour, omitting turmeric, peppercorns and cilantro.  I used one egg white from a cage free vegetarian egg to hold it together.  I replaced the vegetable oil with peanut oil and the salt with sea salt.  I also replaced the onions with scallions.   I also used dried organic garbanzo beans. It was really good but I felt like there was something missing. I may just add the other ingredients then next time I make this. As for preparation I used whole wheat pita bread and a thin slice of monterey jack cheese and it was so delicious.   I intend to make this again.

My wife & I made this recipe yesterday. She hates fried food, so we baked for 20 minutes at 375 and finished them off in the frying pan to give them a bit of texture. Also took the recommendation to include egg to make them a little more moist. Since we were only two, I put half of the mix in the freezer for another day.    Served with lots of cucumbers, tomatoes and tzatziki with whole wheat shells, this is going to be a staple in our vegetarian diet.

This is the best homemade falafel I've had. It stayed together while frying and tasted great.

The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because I thought it was way too garlicy. I would suggest taking 1 or 2 cloves out of the mix. I has no problems with the falafel sticking, but I took other users' suggestions and made them flat like coins and baked them. This helped them stay together, made them healthier and they were easier to put into pita pockets. I put thousand island on them the first time and ate the leftovers cold with ketchup, great both ways!

Loved the way they came out! Agree with cooks4forty about the balls falling apart. After I made the balls, I just added some olive oil and rubbed the balls individually with the oil so they stuck together while frying. I then served with tomato, cilantro, spinach, with light mayo and Siracha sauce mixed in for some kick!

I liked this, but it needs a little tinkering.  I added the juice of a lemon and an egg, but I think next time I'll add a little cayenne or red pepper flakes, plus more of the seasonings.  I made the mix earlier in the day, and I think that helped them stay together as I pan fried them.

These were really great.  I used dried cilantro and didn't deep fry them, just cooked each side in a lightly oiled pan (I flattened them a little).  I also used an egg so they didn't fall apart.  They tasted almost as good as the traditional ones I usually buy - and since they're much cheaper I'll definitely use this recipe over and over again.  Thank you!

I added an egg to mine because it seemed too dry otherwise.  They turned out great, even better than what I've had at the local Mediterranean Restaurant.  I served them on flatbread with tzatziki sauce, black olives, feta cheese and tomatoes.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!!!  If your not vegan, and you want it to stick together, just add an egg.  :)

I've made these twice.  The first time I added some water to moisten the mixture, the next time I added 1/4 c water and 1 egg.  The mixture stayed together better for me with just water.  The taste is fantastic, and it was such a lively meal for a chilly winter night. My husband loves these. I served them on pita with Tabbouleh III and Romaine lettuce. A perfect side would be Hummus III, but I only had one can of garbonzo beans.

These were really good.  My son who barely will eat anything besides chicken even liked them.  I didn't have all the ingredients but was close.  I think I will try baking them next time due to all the extra grease.  I had to use left over matzo crumbs in place of bread crumbs since I didn't have any.
