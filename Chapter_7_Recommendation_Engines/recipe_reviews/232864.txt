11-27-2015 ~This is pretty much the potato salad I grew up with – and for me, that’s a GOOD thing.  Familiar and delicious, I can still remember watching my mother prepare it and saying to her, “Put more pickles in Mom” (which I did, cuz I knew it was what I had to do).  She didn’t use a recipe, nor does this one require you follow it precisely either.  I’m sure the submitter wouldn’t mind if maybe you used all ingredients in amounts to suit your taste buds, like the mayonnaise or mustard for instance. Or more celery if you like a little more crunch.  (I’ll bet she doesn’t measure precisely, but was forced to specify measurements for purposes of following recipe submission guidelines.  I’ll bet, for instance, that she just uses a good plop or two of mayonnaise and maybe a squirt or two of mustard)  In my case, tinkering with this  a bit meant adding a little sour cream to mellow out the mayonnaise and substituting dill pickle juice for the vinegar, tho’ there’s not a darn thing wrong with the vinegar.  I added very thinly sliced radishes and chopped cucumber, because Mom did.  Some chopped green onion gave this just the flecks of color it needed.  Most important, just as Mom did, I tasted it about five or six times (clean spoon every time!) to make sure it was just right.  I’d call this recipe “Old Reliable.”

This is what I'm talking about!  There are lots of "alternative" potato salads out there, but if you want one like Mom or Grandma used to make, this is it.  I cut the recipe in half and ended up using less mayo anyway (1 cup).  I added cheese because my mom always did!  I also used 3-4 tsp of sweet pickle juice in addition to the vinegar.  Used more pepper, threw a little celery salt in there, and topped it with paprika.  Honestly, everyone else is right - eyeball it, taste it - you'll be fine!

This is the potato salad I grew up with!   It's simple, not fancy at all, and just plain good!     I love this recipe!   One thing that I love about this recipe is the ability to eyeball everything.  Add more of this, less of that.... it's all good!   Takes me back to my childhood...

I made a few modifications and it was PERFECT! Used celery seed and freeze dried red onions as I prefer both over chunks of the alternative; used a few dashes of ground mustard instead of the prepared kind; added a few pinches of white sugar and threw in some scallions----and I'll need to double the recipe from now on as it was gone almost immediately. Thanks for the perfect foundational recipe!

I don't chop potatoes before I boil them for potato salad. I always boil them in their jackets. I  chop and partially dress the potatoes  while they are warm. Part of the mayonnaise and the vinegar go right on. That way the potatoes absorb the dressing best.  I also added green salad olives but the rest of the ingredients and the proportions were great.

Made this for something to go with hamburgers. It was excellent. There were only four of us so I adjusted the recipe. Everybody loved it. Will defiantly make again.

This is probably the best potato salad recipe I've ever found.  I made it just as it is written and it was perfect - plenty of dressing with tons of flavor.  I brought it to a family outing and it got rave reviews.

I'm ashamed to say I could never make good potato salad!  That is, until I tried this recipe!  It was delicious and I was so proud.  None of it went to waste either.  My son is begging me to make it again.  Thank you for this recipe!

I'm still looking for the "perfect" potato salad and this just isn't it!  It wasn't bad, but something was missing for me.  Also, you have to boil the potatoes a lot longer than 10 minutes.  They were too hard (maybe it's because I used red potatoes).

Taste Great. I used 1/2 the recipe. Substitutions were petite red skin potatoes; Wickles relish for the pickles and a dash of white pepper + black pepper. A little less mayo. Cooking time for potatoes perfect then added ice to chill them. This is our "go to " recipe.

yes I made it, I found it to be very simple to make, it had some different ingredients to the one I normally make, and it was very tasteful, I will continue to make this one in future.

Great recipe just as it is.  I've made it a few times now, and everyone loves it.  Since I always look for others' suggestions, here are mine:
- 2 cups mayo instead of 3, or somewhere in between.  Do NOT use light mayo!
- 8 eggs
- 2 TBS vinegar
- Add 1/2 cup chopped red pepper
- I chop everything very fine
- Potatoes should simmer at least 15 minutes, I do about 20, until the cubes fall apart with fork.
-  20 min prep time is hilarious.  This takes me well over an hour before it's in the fridge.

Classic! I like a little more mustard. So instead of prepared, I used it straight outta the bottle. It's delicious! And to think I was worried about being beaten by that prepared salad in a tub!

Great potato salad! I halved it and added the amounts of ingredients to my preference. A little more of this, less of that....it's deviating from the recipe, but you have to like the amounts yourself. I also added some thinly sliced radishes and some scallions. It was different to mix everything but the potatoes, and add them to it, but I think it combined better this way.  Good idea! After recently making a potato salad with green beans, blue cheese and bacon, I much  more prefer this good, basic, home style potato salad, like a lot of us remember from childhood (with a few personal  embellishments)! Top with paprika, of course.

This was awesome.I have to say I did change it. Because it’s what i had on hand and was in a hurry. I used a 1.5 lbs bag of red Streamable potatoes, 2 1/2pickled eggs because they were already hard-boiled from easter and white onion. I did use all the ingredients for 5  people. It was spot on my kids and my husband raved  and said it was the best potato salad they ever had. Well done. thanks

Made this for a family new years dinner and it was a hit. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it, but I might try a little less mayo next time as I found that it was a little too creamy.

Very tasty!  Used dill relish instead of chopping up pickles myself, and lowered the amount slightly due to that.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe is amazing!! I left out the onion and added a pound of bacon. We love eggs, so  I also used 8 eggs instead of 5. Everyone loved it! Side note: This makes enough for A WHOLE LOT of people.

My wife and I both agree, this is the best Potato Salad we've ever had!  Add chopped green onion and paprika like the photo shows, but the recipe omits.  Also, instead of 3 cups of mayo, we used 2 cups of mayo and 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt.

My husband likes potato salad but has no teeth.  I put all the veggies in the blender and make them a part of the dressing.  Then I cut the potatoes quite small, throw in some thawed but uncooked frozen peas,  and stir in the dressing.  Last, the chopped boiled eggs go in and whee-a potato salad he can eat.

Excellent! I had to really cut the recipe down as I  had only a small amount of potatoes, otherwise I change nothing. We loved it! I will definitely make it again...with more potatoes! :)

This is a great recipe for traditional potato salad. I used 2 cups of mayo...3 would have been too much! I also added pickle juice, sour cream  and bacon bits.

I did not like this at all. I followed the recipe measurements and ended up with an absolute ginormous amount of dressing. I used maybe a third of it. It was just too creamy and sweet. Not my taste. Wasn't a hit with anyone and ended up throwing it out.

Really good!  The vinegar adds that extra tang that's needed.  I added a bit more celery because I like more crunch in my salad.

Excellent!  I took it to a dinner and received rave reviews from everyone.  I did not use all of the dressing.  There was more than needed, but I saved it to make more potato salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple and delicious. I liked that I have everything on hand and it's easy to mix around the vegetables. I didn't add pickles as I don't like them but added some green peppers instead. Will make again.

Superb. I don’t really know what made it so good, but it’s so delicious. I chopped the pickles, only had one spear left in the jar, and decided to add it. I added an extra egg because I love finding hard boiled egg chunks in potato salad. I added the mayo and mustard without measuring (3 cups mayo = 24 oz (google conversion) and I had a 30 oz jar). When I finally mixed in the potatoes, I took my first taste. It was too good to mess with further. I’m a fan. It’s chilling in the fridge now.

I chose this recipe for its high ranking & the flavors do not disappoint. I used dill pickles since the recipe does not specify. I followed other reviewers’ suggestions to boil the potatoes longer than 10 minutes, I boiled mine for 20 minutes. I also added green onions for a sprinkle of color. At first, I thought it was too runny, but after sitting in the fridge for an hour, I stirred the mixture again, and the consistency was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

I used a bottle of Vlasic dill pickle relish in place of chopped pickles and apple cider vinegar. Peeled and Cut up one three pound bag of red potatoes. Garnished with paprika and chopped green onions. Turned out great, family loved it.

I added home made seasoned salt to give it a bit more flavor. I used kosher dill pickles., because it wasn't specified. Also, I used salt potatoes and easily removed the thin skins. It came out very go. Thanks allrecipes for helping me make it for 1.

I made this without onion, used horseradish mustard,  Russet potatoes, boiled skins on, then cooled, peeled and cubed.  Seasoned with Beau Monde and black pepper.  Garnished with parsley flakes and paprika.

Tastes good now, but placed in the fridge ... will be very good tomorrow!

Just right.  Not a fan of pickles, so I left them out.  Had some frozen peas and added those.  Thought I was going to be a bit shy on mayo so after I combined that the Dijon, I mashed an avocado into the mix and that was yummy.

Excellent flavor and texture. I’ve always made potato salad the way my mom did just throwing in the same things she did, which was always good! I just saw this and decided to try it and I’m not sorry! It is excellent. I followed the recipe just as it’s written.

I added a couple extra eggs, and used a couple teaspoons of onion powder instead of raw onion so I could make it ahead and not have the onion be overwhelming. Next time I’ll try boiling the potatoes whole and dicing afterwards for slightly more consistent cooking.

This was so good! I made it for a company potluck. My first time ever making potato salad. It took way longer to make than the directions stated, but it turned out amazing! Most of the time was spent cutting the potatoes & veggies. My advice is don't be shy with the salt in the water for the potatoes and when they are done and drained add plenty of salt too. I also used garlic aioli mustard which really took this recipe to the next level flavor-wise. This was a HUGE hit at the potluck. I saw people eating it by the plateful LITERALLY.

Having never made potato salad before, I found this recipe to be easy to execute with really good results. I did follow other's suggestions to pare back the amount of mayo to a little bit over 2 cups. I also used my mom's trick of grating the onion which was really easy and quick. I did add about a teaspoon of garlic powder and used Guldens spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard. Everyone raved about the potato salad at the BBQ and my mom (who's the best chef I know) requested I make it for her birthday BBQ tomorrow.

First off, the lady that said it was yuck, well, she was partially right. The 1/2 c of vinegar was way to much. I downsized it to 1T.  And added a squirt more mustard. Sprinkled w/ bacon and freshly grated cheddar. It's always a request @ my husband's work functions. I think its the cooking process of the dressing that adds distinction to this recipe!

Very easy to make and similar to my grandmothers. Didn't have apple cider vinegar, but did have red wine vinegar and it really adds a nice "tang" to the recipe.  I was in a hurry to find/make potato salad, so mine didn't have all the time recipe required in the fridge to "marinate." But it was still very good and even better the next day. Next time I will remember to start sooner.

STOP and READ!!  Waaaaaayyyy  too much mayo and mustard.  This recipe works well with only 1 cup Mayo, 2 TBLsp mustard and just a tad less than 1 TBLSP of the vinegar.  I do a teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper.  If you use the recommended measurements of mayo you will not like this recipe. Otherwise, it's good.

I really did love this potato salad but had a problem trying to half the recipe. It made a ton of dressing which overwhelmed the potatoes. I will make it again because I really did love the flavours but will make slightly less than half in the dressing portion.

First time I made this exactly as stated. It’s very good but I made changes the second time for my tastes - 6 russet potatoes, 3/4 cup each mayo and sour cream, 3 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 cup chopped celery, half a sweet yellow onion chopped, 4 tbsp stone ground mustard, 1 tbsp cider vinegar, 1 cup finely diced dill pickles.

This was AMAZING!!!  I cut this recipe in half, and there was still plenty of salad.  The only changes I made were adding 2 tbsp of sour cream and omitted the red onion (didnt have any).  Wouldn't change a thing next time!

This turned out to be a total hit with my family & guests! I did have to substitute red potatoes for Yukon Gold & decided to add some dill weed & turmeric as extra seasoning. I made it a day before as suggested and it had a great consistency at the time I served it.  I highly recommend it!

This is a wonderful recipe! I agree with other reviewers that it turns out best when made with warm potatoes. This potato salad tastes even better the 2nd day. :-)

THE BEST EVER!!! And so easy. We have loved it all week long, thanks so much for a simple but ever so tasty potato salad.  I have always shied away from making it myself, I do have a good recipe for German Potato Salad----now I'm covered on both sides.  YUM!

This is almost exactly my mother's recipe handed down.  Hers had no mustard.  I tried it and would dial back the mustard unless you like a mustard-based potato salad, which some people do.  But this is a mayo-based salad and feel that just a single Tbsp of mustard is enough for a little zing.  Another addition I like is about 1 tsp celery seed and finally top with fried bacon bits and scallions.  Those changes would make it a 5 star in my book.

I hate to heat up my tiny kitchen so I microwave the potatoes
cut them up after they've cooled enough to handle then proceed with the recipe.  I do make sure I mix the mayo while the potatoes are still warm.  Then add more before serving.

I'm only giving 3 stars due to the proportion of dressing.  Way too soupy.  Otherwise, a great, basic potato salad recipe.

Made this for 4th of July and my dad's 92nd birthday.  This is basically my mom's recipe although she would use a little less mayo (maybe only 2 1/2 cups instead of 3) and add celery seed in addition to everything else.  And for sweetness we mix real mayo with Miracle Whip---about 80% mayo to 20% Miracle Whip.  I know....don't judge....just try it.  :)  Then I garnish with stuffed green olives, which somehow just go great with potato salad!

This was very good. Only changes made were minor--miracle whip instead of mayo and a sprinkle of paprika on top for color.

Loved this salad!! Reminded me of picnics growing up. I will adjust the mayo amount next time...the recipe called for just a bit too much for my taste.

I used 7-8 lbs of potatoes and only used 2 cups of mayo.  I also doubled the amount of celery and salt.  Other than that it was perfect for me.  Like Mom's old recipe.

Just like Mom used to make!  Boy did this bring back memories!  I'm low carb now so can't make this except once a year or so. Mom used russets and pickle juice and added some celery salt. I've never used an actual recipe. Thanks for writing this down!

This is the way my mom made potato salad, for my family I half the recipe bc there are only 4 of us. First time I made it I couldn't get the lid off my bottle of cider vinegar--still tasted great. 2nd time I did use it & noticed the extra flavor.  Only thing I change is to add 4 strips of crumbled bacon--oh, and I omit the salt (personal preference). Definitely tastes better made at least a few hours ahead of time.

This was great.  Only used 2 C. Mayo.  I mashed with potato masher a bit after all was mixed.  Perfect basic PS.   I will never understand why even good restaurants use potato salad out of a bucket when something this good and fresh is this easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loves this recipe. The mistake I was making with potato salad was not using red potatoes. Red potatoes make the difference! I made a couple of changes. I used half the amount of pickles, two Tbs of prepared mustard and one Tbs of deli mustard and I added one Tbs of sugar. My grandma always added sugar to her potato salad so I followed her example. DELICIOUS!

Good!  Do a better job then me on following the directions on how to cook the potatoes so you don't overcook them like I did.  Also, cook the eggs at the same time so you aren't delayed.

It came out wonderfully! I didn't have the pickles, so I left that out and it was still great. I also used less mayonnaise, as I never have liked too much of it. I love the addition of the mustard to this, and the apple cider vinegar, as it gives it a more tangy taste.

I have been searching for a basic, good, old-fashioned potato salad recipe, and this is it! It couldn't be simpler to make, and it turned out perfect. Sweet creamy mayo with a touch of tang and nothing added that overpowers. I did skip the pickles, because some family members do not like them, but this was in no way bland without them. I only had russet potatoes, and I peeled them and cut them relatively small and they were cooked but firm after 7 minutes. I think Thank you so much!

I was looking for something different than my usual potato salad...this recipe was different!!  My husband and I really enjoyed the flavors of this one.  Only thing different is I used dill relish (from another  review).

Pretty similar to the potato salad I grew up with! I add radishes and green onions and about a cup more plain  vinegar. Delicious. If you are looking for a basic potato salad this is it. Make it a day ahead so the dressing has an opportunity to soak into the potatoes and it is a sure fire hit.

I left out the pickles and celery and used some extra onion. This was a solid recipe. One of the better potato salads that I have made. The potatos did need a bit more than 10 minutes.

Great flavor but a bit too soupy for my taste. I had to add about 1 pound more potatoes to not have glop. I wanted it more visually appealing to take to a funeral dinner.

Excellent receive.  Easy to make.  I replaced Mayo with Soy Free Vegenaise which made it healthier without any sacrifice of flavor.  It's definitely a keeper!

I added bacon to this recipe which was a welcome addition. I also used dill pickle relish in order to get finely chopped pickles plus to save time. And I sprinkled paprika on top to give it some color. I also used 100% pure avocado oil mayonnaise-delish!

This was very very good, my hubby loved it! I will keep this recipe and use it a lot :) Thank you! 
P.S. I did add about 2 T of sour cream to off set the mayo I used, I didn't have anything but Mayo. I also only used 2 cups of Mayo instead of 3. Also I didn't have celery so I used celery salt, and didn't add any salt to it. I think I used about 1 T of it. Since my boys hate onions, none where added. But I loved the taste! VERY VERY GOOD!!! :)

Loved this!  I only used 1 cup mayo and 2 T mustard. Just like my mom used to make. This is a keeper.
