I thought these were very good, but way too buttery.  I would definitely recommend decreasing the amount of butter in the recipe.  There was a whole layer of butter on the bottom of the bar.

These were definitely good and a unique recipe.  I love marshmallow so I used a whole bag.  I felt something was missing not sure what but I probably will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm rating these before my granddaughters even taste them because I'm sure they will love them!  I must caution you to grease the pan as stated.  I actually put them on Pam-sprayed wax paper, and the ones that overlapped to the non-sprayed part really stuck.  Also I kept a little bowl of water nearby so I could use damp fingers to form the stacks---otherwise, they are way too sticky!  Thanks for this nice treat!
