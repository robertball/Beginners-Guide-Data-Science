A co-worker of mine made these and brought them in to share with everybody and they were awesome. Super tasty and pretty cool looking. I hope she gets a giant raise.

These sound amazing and so very creative but I've one problem. Toasting the marshmallows sounds like something I wouldn't have the time/energy for and not even sure if I could do it on my flat stove top. Anyone out there have ideas on how to do this in the oven or under the broiler on a parchment lined sheet??

Made them for the grandkids and looked adorable,  but very labor intensive.  I had my husband help  me roast them over our gas stove,  Seemed to take forever.  Then the marshmallows were so soft, even after being refrigerated, they were very hard to handle to dip into the chocolate & graham crumbs.  I was a chocolatier for 32 years, so the chocolate was the easy part for me, even tho my ganache remained too runny.   I had to add more cream to thicken it up so I could pipe it.   If you want to make these, give yourself plenty of time and have patience.  I would not make them again.

I only ate one, but I wish I had about 20. These were so decadent, rich, and wonderful. So worth the effort to create these little masterpieces.

These were delicious! Admittedly, I did not make them - but the end result was that right combination of toasty marshmallow, crunchy graham crackers, and rich chocolate just like s'mores you have as a kid, but spiked with just enough bourbon to make these feel like a real grown-up treat!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit! Thanks for posting it. I ended up making two batches. One with alcohol and one without for the kids. 

It took a few tries to get the marshmallows to cooperate. And it was a bit labor intensive. I suggest -have a partner to help with the assembly. They were a blast though. I would totally make them again!
