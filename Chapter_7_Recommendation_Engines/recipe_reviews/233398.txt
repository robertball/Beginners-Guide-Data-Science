Delicious! Amazing flavor for only needing 30 minutes to cook. Bought the veggies at Pike Place Market and made this as a special treat for my girlfriend--it was her first day at a new job. Was surprised the summer squash didn't disintegrate after 30 minutes of simmering but it was a-ok...nice and chunky and hearty. While the stew was simmering we had a little caprese-style salad--sliced heirloom tomatoes with fresh basil, balsamic vinegar, and oil on top. Altogether it was an easy dinner that won me major points!

I made this last night with leftover squash from my CSA box.  It was so good!  I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used stewed.  I also used a red pepper in place of Jalapeno because it's what I had on hand.  Lastly, I added in some purple carrots.  Such a great and easy soup!

I browned the sausage and onions in bacon grease. Added all ingredients plus carrots, smoked hatch chili pepper and coriander to the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.

I have made this several times and it always comes out tasting very good. There is a lot of chopping with this recipe and I recommend you get everything cut up before you start cooking. I do not have the the knife skills a pro has so it takes me an hour to get everything chopped and sliced. But the result is well worth the effort. Enjoy. FYI - Use your large stew pot because this make a lot more than 4 servings. In my opinion it makes 8 to 10 servings.

We made this stew tonight for dinner. We used spicy sausage and stuck pretty close to the original recipe.  Added yellow and red bell peppers for some color. It was fantastic! Very flavorful and hearty. Served it hot with garlic bread and drizzled parmesan cheese. This stew is a keeper!  YUM! Thank you Chef John!!

Made it today!  It was awesome.  tweaked it a bit.  used hot smoked pork sausage instead of what was suggested, Used  Yellow crooked necked squash. Back to the sausage very warm.. lol..but I loved it! So added just a tad bit of jalepenos and no cayenne. I also added some cabbage I had from not using it all in another dish and that made it Amazing! crushed tomatoes and another small can of tomato sauce. Low sodium chicken broth, 2 14.5 oz. cans. I cut up small bites of everything..sausage was cubed not ground. Scaled it all down and it STILL made a lot.. lol!! Followed the recipe pretty close otherwise . Spices? All to taste..no cayenne, added some bell pepper  finely chopped,onion powder, garlic pepper, Mrs. Dash, black pepper, salt.  Paired it with cornbread.

Easy!! I used kielbasa and omitted jalapenos, tossed in a good amount of red pepper flakes. Made this twice in the last month. My coworker loved after she tried mine, so she made her own batch and shared it with the office. This one is a great crowd pleaser!

This was fantastic!  Hearty and yummy, it was low boil meets healthy meets comfort food.  I made exactly as written, except didn't have the peppers, but they weren't missed.  Also grateful to have found a food allergy-friendly recipe since three in my family have different food sensitivities.  This one is going in regular rotation!

I picked this recipe because it used a lot of vegetables I got in my “from the local farm box” this week. I liked it and my husband who isn’t a big veggie enthusiast loved it. Nice mix of flavors. My only change was to omit the cayenne pepper since I used a ‘hot’ sausage. I was afraid with the 4 to 5 jalapeño peppers it would be to spicy but it really wasn’t. Will keep the recipe to use again when squash is in season.

This is the first Chef John recipe I did not like. I've made many of his recipes and loved them all. I made it EXACTLY as written too. The broth dipped in crusty French bread was very good, but the rest of it was not. Perhaps it's my fault because the only andouille sausage I could find at my grocery was chicken andouille and it overpowered everything else.  If you make it do not use chicken andouille sausage.

This is amazing.  Even my 2 year old said it was "lishus" (delicious)!   There's so much flavor and its super hearty.  I followed the recipe exactly as it states only I didn't have a summer squash so I used a winter squash with my zucchini. I would definitely recommend putting the potatoes in it, it really added a lot to the texture.  If you want more of a soup I would probably leave them out. This is going to be made repeatedly in this house FOR SURE!

Very easy and wonderfully tasty  recipe !  Made it with some minor changes, diced tomatoes instead of crushed and omitted the jalapeno. Just added a little bit more cayenne  and maybe a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Served it over pasta with some parm cheese. Yum !!! Thank you Chef John !

Way too hot for most palates (jalapeño peppers?).  But tasty, once you calm your mouth down.

I enjoyed this soup. I didn't have the meat or crushed tomatoes, so I used a spicy Italian sausage and omitted the pepper. I used petite diced tomato instead and it worked out fine. I was worried the veggies would turn to mush but they didn't. I used quinoa instead of potato and it felt so deliciously healthy. Will definitely make again.

I used fresh tomatoes but peeled them first.  It's August and they are abundant.   I added my home grown butternut squash and used a curved green squash from the local farm stand.  Since the sausage are spicy, I did not use the jalapeno pepper. 
It was delicious and my husband loved it and so did I.

Followed recipe, but skipped the potatoes, used bell peppers instead of jalapeños, and stewed fresh tomatoes. Had a big link of Italian sausage, so roasted it in the oven and used drippings to saute onions and peppers. 

Beloved took 2 4-cup containers, and 2 2-cup, he polished off the big ones, his mom the small ones, and there was still enough for the freezer.

I used chicken sausage and let it simmer longer. Extra squash. Excellent recipe.

This was great! I substituted what I had on hand: new potatoes instead of Yukon gold, basil instead of parsley, and added some rosemary. My wife and I like spicy, so I used more than a pinch of cayenne pepper. Bursting with flavor!

Really Yummy! Any sausage will do. I omitted the jalapeños though.

Delicious recipe! I thought we liked things spicy, but 1/2 CUP diced jalapeno for 4 servings? Whew! We couldn't have eaten it that way! I skipped the jalapenos completely and used 1/4 t. cayenne pepper. That was spicy enough for us here in the Midwest. Next time I make this, will try adding more tomatoes for a little more tomato flavor. Can't wait to have it again. Update: I have also made this with little smokies and it is quite good.

Yum
I doubled this for the freezer and I also have tried it with sausage crumbles.  So good!

This is so good! I followed everything exactly, except added in some chopped carrots that I had sitting in the fridge. I love the hearty, homey stew flavors this brought my family. My dad hates most vegetables, but he ate most of the pot! Thank you!

It was nice having so many appetizing vegetables in one serving. I highly recommend it to those who, like myself, are not fond of vegetables but are trying experiment with them more.

I have never written a review for a recipe.  I have had many good ones from All Recipes.  This one was delicious!  Coupled with a fresh loaf of bread from my sister.  She likes to bake!

We left out the potatoes and parsley because we didn't have any. Also no cayenne because I used 3 Fresno chilies which are hotter than jalapeños. My fiancée forgot the cheese which I will definitely use next time. I used it with fresh sourdough rolls, but I think crusty day olds would be even better.  Great summer leftovers soup. I bet this freezes well too.

I loved this.  The recipe is well-written, the video is helpful, and the soup is delicious. I have zucchini in my garden and this is definitely going into the regular rotation.
