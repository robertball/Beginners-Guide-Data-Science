16 ingredients is a lot to get gathered up and they are mostly things you have on hand but still a lot to get out. This was well worth it though. 5 stars all the way! My only advice is that if you are going to take the time to get everything out and blended then you might as well double the batch if not triple. Great sauce for all kinds of things!

I served this as one of 3 sauces for a backyard BBQ of leg of lamb and brisket.  Made an excellent sauce for sliders.

I halved this, and used my mini-processor, adding about 1/3 of the ingredients at a time, processing well after each. In place of the lemon zest, I just added a little lemon juice. This really complimented the Maryland Crab Cakes II from this site. It has a nice zing. Instead of Creole mustard, I mixed a little  Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce with Dijon mustard. You could use this for other things, as the submitter suggested, even a sandwich spread. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, thanks for sharing this recipe.  I left out the hot sauce because my husband does not want food too spicy and it was still wonderful.
