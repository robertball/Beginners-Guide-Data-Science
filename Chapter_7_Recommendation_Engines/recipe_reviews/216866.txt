This terrific recipe can also be made on an indoor, or stovetop grill. Be sure you have an exhaust fan though as does smoke quite a bit. When I first made this recipe, the chops were grilled on an indoor, stovetop grill.

My family and I really enjoy this sauce. I cook this recipe in the pressure cooker along with the lamb. I also mix red and yellow curry.

I applied a dry generic rub from Australia to the chops. I added a bit of canola oil and tossed them in a bowl from time to time for a few hours. 
The sauce worked out well even with b the omission of the apple sauce. I added some maple syrup rather than water to keep it moist. 
I grilled the chops as directed in the recipe and let them rest for 15 minutes. 
This recipe is a keeper??!

Amazing. The sauce is a hit. I had to skip the coriander because with wife do not like it, but the recipe is still amazing. Great mix of flavor, and texture. The lamb goes perfectly with this...
