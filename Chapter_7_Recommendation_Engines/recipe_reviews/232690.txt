I have made this recipe for nearly 40 years, but I use a can of Italian Plum tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Just mash them a bit and they will break down as they cook.  I also use red wine vinegar, which adds a nice flavor.  You can make this in a deep skillet on the stove, and you don't need to brown the meat first.  It's amazing.  And it will take a tough cut of meat and make it very tender.  I serve it over rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce.  I've never tried it in the crockpot, though. An all around great recipe.

I made this as instructed with a homemade onion soup mix (I used one from Allrecipes). I'm not sure if this dish is usually quite so salty, or if it's salty due to using a homemade onion soup mix? I will make it again with regular onions soup mix and will update if there's significant improvement.

Better than I expected. I didn't think I was going to like this but it was quite tasty. Served it with jasmine rice and corn on the cob.My family enjoyed it as well. The best part was that it was so simple to throw together.

This is one from my childhood.  Great with mashed potatoes so you can pour a little of the "gravy" over them.  I switched out the canned sauce for stewed tomatoes and cooked it in a covered skillet.  So simple, even my college kids can whip it up.
