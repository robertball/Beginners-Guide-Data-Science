One of my top favorite "salads". I don't make it often anymore because I have NO willpower when it comes to this salad.......I will eat the whole bowl, a little at a time.

Super simple recipe and tastes fantastic! I've followed the recipe exactly (minus the nuts), and it's great, but you can tweak to add more marshmallows or frozen whipped topping to meet your own tastes. I do omit the nuts, but that is a personal preference.

This is my husband's favorite salad that has to be made at every holiday gathering or family get together. This is my exact recipe I've been making for years--it's the perfect way to make Watergate Salad. Sometimes I swap walnuts for the pecans.

Delicious! Very easy to put together too! Took this to a birthday potluck and it was raved about! I did not put pecans in it as there were people with nut allergies at the birthday potluck.I'm taking the leftovers home and putting pecans on mine!

I have been making this salad for years.  I use 2 cups of miniature marshmallows and skip the pecans, although they may add a lot.  I think I'll try them next time.

Great recipe!! The ingredients had me a little worried, but once it all came together.....delish!! Next time I think I would add a little more pecans- just because I love pecans. Thanks for this new recipe!!
