This was delicious! Super easy, fast, and healthy (besides sour cream and cheese). I will definitely make this again! Excited for leftovers tomorrow!

So good! I used half mild and half medium salsa and it was just right for everyone. Will definitely have again!

This is a great way to use leftover chicken. The recipe is quick and easy and everyone in my family liked it, which is hard to accomplish.
