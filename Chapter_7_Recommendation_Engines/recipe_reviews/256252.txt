I made this recipe ahead of time for having a house guest for a few days so me and my husband and our guest could have something quick but simple for breakfast other than oatmeal. And it came out pretty good! I did change the recipe somewhat,  though - I did not include the pecans, and I tossed the apple slices in 2 Tbsp sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon before I added it to the mix. I think it added a lot of flavor and helped bring the apples out more.

I didn't have pancake mix on hand so I used the AllRecipies "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" recipe but omitted the milk and egg from that other recipe since this one called for those. I added a melted stick of butter because... well, butter. I also took another reviewer's advice to toss the apples in cinnamon and sugar. I cut the ginger in half because ginger scares me. Mine took a total of 60 minutes to cook through and I had to cover it with foil half way through to keep it from over-browning. I made half with pecans and half without for the kids. It was not overly sweet and people could add syrup to their liking. Definitely a keeper! Easily feeds at least 6-8 people!

I was hoping this would smell & tastes like pancakes but it did not.  The texture was like cake & tasted alright, but it wasn't what I expected.  I have other coffee cake recipes that are tastier.

I had to make this gluten free for my family.  Used all the same ingredients though.  All my family adored this.  Was gone in two mornings with only 3 people eating it!
