This recipe is actually supposed to be made with the tiny little Acini di pepe pasta, and it is then called "Frog Eye Salad" It is also truly delicious

I have a similar recipe to this and am going to suggest using acine de pepe pasta as it is very small, almost like a tapioca.No one will believe it is pasta! Overall this is an excellent salad and  usually the first thing to go at parties.

Instead of macaroni I used orzo pasta and it still turned out good.  I felt the crushed pineapple kinda got lost in the mixture so next time I will use chunk pineapple.  In the flavoring I felt it was missing something.

My kids loved helping make this and ate even more because they made it. Very quick and easy. The texture takes some getting use to though.

I made this for a brunch shower.  The ladies liked the salad and I had several requests for the recipe.  I used the acini di pepe pasta and I think that made a difference.  I had to tell them that there was pasta in there.  I don't know that I would have liked this with macaroni noodles.  The salad reminded me very much of an ambrosia salad.  It was sweet, cool, and refreshing.  I think toasted coconut or toasted slivered almonds would be a great garnish.

The kids wanted me to try this. Unfortunately they hated the macaroni. I might try making this again without the macaroni as a dessert since they liked the fruit.

I'd have to agree with other reviewers. Pasta and fruit salad just don't mix. I even used tiny pasta instead of macaroni, and it just didn't feel right when you came across it.

This was just okay. We added more fruit to help the blandness, but still wasn't good enough to make again.

haven't made this yet, but is much faster than cooking a pudding mixture.  I'm going to use probably lemon instant pudding to add some zing.  Pineapple tidbits too.  Just about any fruit you have.  Mini ring macaroni works well too.

I liked the texture of the salad.  Reminded me of tapioca pudding.  I thought it needed a little more flavor so since I thought it was like tapioca, I added some cinnamon to it.  I liked the flavor much more afterwards.

Ehh.. I thought it was so-so.  It lacked a little something in the flavor department.  I did use Orzo pasta in place of macaroni, and used sugar-free vanilla pudding and low fat whipped topping.  I don't think though that if I had used regular products that it would have added much flavor.  I like the idea of the salad, but will have to think of something that will add a little pizazz.

Great dessert.  I used instant white chocolate pudding mix with 1 1/2 cups rice milk.  I didn't have fruit cocktail so we cut up an apple, added raisins and my glazed pecans made from this site.  Was out of mini marshmallows so cut up big ones. Used 1 1/2 cans mandarin oranges.  Didn't use all the cool whip and processed 1 1/2 cups of pineapple chunks. If you have a hard boil you need to use more water to boil orzo pasta.  Boiled for 7 minutes then drained.  We had friends stop by as I was making this and I served up 9 bowls and have alot left over.
