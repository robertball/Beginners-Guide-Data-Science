Made this for recipe group and based on the ingredients I was pretty sure Hubby would enjoy it as a comforting meal.  Simple to prepare and easy to follow directions…I did follow them exactly but if I were to make it again I would likely mix the pasta sauce in with the meat instead of the pasta… I did add some mushrooms since I had some on hand. Thanks for a very nice one dish meal recipe.

Simple and delicious!  The only thing I did differently was build it more like another casserole I make - I mixed the pasta and the cream cheese (and added some green onions for fun) and spread that in the bottom of the casserole dish.  I simmmered the sauce with the meat and seasonings for a few minutes and then layered that on top of the pasta in the dish.  It was a hit with all 6 members of my family, and that is no easy task!

Recipe Group Selection:  10, January 2015 ~ This was a nice dinner.  I chose to use spaghetti noodles, as that is what I had on hand.  Because we enjoy the taste of sauteed onions, I chopped rather than minced.  I melted the cream cheese with the meat and onion mixture to make sure the cream cheese completely melted.  This worked well for me and then I added the mixture to the pasta and sauce mixture.  I split the casserole in to 2 dishes and shared one with my parents.  They enjoyed this dish too.

I made this pretty much according to the recipe.  I didn't use mozzarella, though.  I used an Italian blend and added mushrooms.  My kids loved it!

This was easy-And just fine for an easy weeknight.  I didn’t bake it in the oven.  I added the cheese to individual bowls and served.  Made as written. I make something similar with different spices this version missed the extra flavor but you can’t miss with this.

Seriously delicious one dish wonder when adding a few ingredients ... here’s what I did: I used about 1 1/2 C shredded cooked chicken and 3/4C pepperoni (pre-warmed to get rid of some of the grease) instead of ground beef.I cut up a whole onion & a medium red pepper  - sauteed a while then added a chopped & seeded zucchini - sauteed a bit longer then added 3 cloves garlic and 1-2 C chopped spinach, then sauteed a minute longer.Also a few substitutions, I used 2C of mozz., fusilli instead of bowtie pasta & only 1/8 teasp of cayenne pepper (cuz I didn’t have red pepper flakes) along with spicy spaghetti sauce (arrabiata spag sauce).Process:Cooked noodles in salted water, melted cream cheese into noodles then stirred sauteed veggies in.Sprayed 9x13 pan and put a tiny bit of spag sauce on bottom then layered:1/2 of the pasta veggie mixture1/2 of the meat1/2 of the cheese1/2 of the sauceRepeat and top with a tiny bit of cheeseCovered with foil and cooked about half an hour at 350.

Well, I thought it was kind of one dimensional and needed something.  I also put in additional seasoning.  The family thought it was pretty good but I don't think I'll be making it again.

Perfect meal for teen boys with a side of Italian Green Beans.
Mid's jarred sauce is 32 oz which is perfect for a 16 oz box of pasta. Still used 1# of gr bf and it was plenty. Now we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Recipe Group: This was nummy, the cream cheese adds a nice touch. Next time I may not bother to throw it in the oven though, unless I made it ahead like I did last night. I used mini farfalle because that's what I had, and some 'no sugar added' sauce from the cupboard. Easy and everyone had seconds, thanks for a great recipe!

Made tonight for Recipe Group.  I omitted the red pepper flakes (personal taste) and doubled the cheese, otherwise made as directed.  Easy, quick and tasty.

Not bad, I season my ground beef the same way no matter what I'm using it for and so I did not find this lacking flavor!.

This is a simple recipe for yummy comfort food.  I subbed basil for the Italian Seasoning since I'm not an oregano fan.  I also used a combination of mozzarella and provolone for the topping.  I halved the recipe and used enough cheese to cover the top.  It was a good quick lunch for me today.  I think with some tweaking this could be outstanding.  The pasta sauce you use would be a big difference in the outcome.  I can't wait to use my homemade sauce with sausage for the next time I make this.  Thanks.
