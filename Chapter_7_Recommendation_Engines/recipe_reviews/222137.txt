I used the non fat milk and some greek yogurt instead of the low fat sour cream.  Cut the amount of cheese way back.  For the bacon I cooked cooked 2 strips of bacon and crumbled that on the top.  They weren't as  cheesy but still delicious.

Great taste.... kinda a lot of work for potatoes in my opinion.... it's pretty messy to scoop all the filling back into the potatoe peel.... they did have great flavor though. I will not make these for my kids again ( they do not appreciate the work required ) I will make them again for adult only dinners.

I reduced light sour cream by half, so I could have some light butter & used 2% Cheddar cheese. Yum.  Might use turkey bacon, next time.

Very yummy! It's easy to reduce calories and fat even more by using less bacon and cheese. My trick for refilling potatoes is to use a cookie scoop. Easy peasy!

These were very easy to make and my husband didn't even notice the difference between the yogurt and sour cream!

I made these for Easter. My dad is on a low sodium diet, and regular baked potato or twice baked are way too big. I did everything exactly the same in this recipe, but instead of four large potatoes, I used 12 very small potatoes. Everyone including my very picky sister enjoyed the potatoes. I had purchased a huge bag of potatoes and still had ingredients left, so I came home and made a second batch. I’m single so I froze those potatoes separately and stored them for future meals. Last night I took one out and baked it to go with my meal and it was just as good as those I baked right away. One thing I don’t like about twice baked potatoes if they leave a lot of the baked potato around the edges. I made a point of scraping out as much potato as I could so that I would have a nice soft goodness through the whole potato. Thanks for the recipe!
