I made these for a Christmas party, and besides being able to make a day early and baking the day of the party, these were extremely easy to make.  I'm going to another party today and they've requested I bring these.  Because I am in TX, I substituted diced jalapenos for green chiles and used tex-mex flavor cheese.  Great appetizers!
