in germany this recipe is made with kockwurst, also we use a lot more curry, hence "currywurst", it is served with fresh broetchen (something like a hard roll) which is dipped in the sauce.

i grew up on Curry Wurst
this gets close but meh...
germans acutally use a sausage made of fine ground beef that gets fried till the skin is crispy 
but the type of sausage is somewhat regional
an easier sauce is ketchup with lots of curry (to taste) and some browned fine diced onions
served usually with a fresh roll and/or french fries

I love this easy recipe.  When I make it (I am Austrian)in the U.S., I grill the sausage (jumbo hot dogs or bratwurst) and use ketchup mixed with curry.  For appearance I sprinkle a little bit of curry on top.  This makes it very easy.  Serve it with a crips Kaiserroll and use toothpicks for eating. I submitted a photo which looks pretty authentic.

I think the proportions are off on this recipe. Using the amount of tomato sauce that is called for make it taste just like sausage in tomato sauce you don't get any of the flavor of the seasonings. It may be better if you cut down the amount of tomato sauce.

I've been eating currywurst ever since I came to the States 35 years ago.  I make it polish sausage or knockwurst.  I have always made with Ketchup.  I used good Hungarian Paprika and Indian Curry.  I tried this version, but used only one can of tomato sauce (3 seemed a bit too much).  It was very good and I welcomed the change.  I know it is popular in Berlin, but it was also popular in Heilbronn, which is in the South.  I pretty much could purchase it anywhere in Germany.  Thanks, sure enjoyed it.

Try a knockwurst instead of the kielbasa. (kielbasa is Polish not German). Knockwurst is more like the original Currywurst from Berlin.

It is very good, but there was a lot of sauce.  I will probably use 2 cans of tomato sauce next time and maybe try a different kind of sausage.  It was similar to what I ate in Germany, but not hot enough.  I had to add more curry and pepper.  I will definately make this again.

This was good, and very quick.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was how much sauce was wasted.  I will cut the sauce recipe by half, at least, next time.

This was so good.  I'll be sure to measure the hot sauce next time the sauce I had was tooooo hot but still was awesome.  I served this over peeled and boiled potatos, it turned out to be the perfect combination.

As other reviewers mentioned, Kielbasa is Polish and smoked. Being German, I recommend Bockwurst, Wiener Wuerstchen, Fleischwurst... .also I can recommend using brown sugar in the sauce if made from scratch as it gives it more flavor due to caramelization within sauce when heated. Never heard of anyone adding chili sauce.

I went with the fastest way using catsup rather than tomato sauce.  I used some other substitutes as well.  Actually it turned out pretty much the way I recall from my days in Germany.  Here's what I did...


... Instead of Kielbasa - I used Bratwurst (4 grilled in a frying pan on all sides & then cut into sections & sprinkled with curry powder on each side and grilled for about 45 seconds each side)  Afterward I put them in the sauce to absorb the sauce/flavour

This one I didn't have to beg my kids to eat! haha  After reading the reviews, I only used 1 can of tomato sauce and then added about 1/2 a can full of Heinz Ketchup.  I added WAYYY more than a pinch of paprika and probably a good 2 tablespoons of curry.  I let it all simmer on the stove around 20 mins and it was SO good.  My kids gobbled it up and begged for more.  I'll be making 2 lbs next time!

These were really good...I did not use all the tomato sauce as I thought it was a bit excessive, but the sauce reminded me of Spaghetti-O's...super good!

It's tasty if you like kielbasa, which I do.  For currywurst, you can use bratwurst, not kielbasa. For the curry sauce, you'll come much closer if you just add  about 3-4 tablespoons of curry powder (NOT a "sprinkle") to 1 1/2 cups of ketchup. Throw in some black pepper if you like. Serve with small rolls, great for sopping up the sauce.

I know this is Deutschland street food, but the sausage needs to be a pure pork sausage and if you can have it made with a better cut I would suggest doing so. It makes a great snack when you are in town. I have had this with a few differnt types of sausage and I think bratwurst with a curry wurst sauce is the best. BTW if you want to be true the the street food; then the base needs to be Heinz Ketchup or you could just buy a bottle of Heinz Curry Ketchup with chili , which is what every vendor trends toward.

I used a slightly different approach, but the same ingredients.  First, I cooked the sliced hot dogs in 2 tablespoons of butter in a large sauce pan instead of broiling them, then I made the sauce with just 1 can of tomato sauce (3 would have made soup!).  I used the amounts of spices and chili sauce as specified in the recipe though, but I recalled it wrong and used less pepper.  The result was GREAT!  Very tasty and very easy.  I will make it again for sure.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had called for 1 can of sauce, 3 would have been way too much and the other ingredients would have been completely overpowered.

This is a good recipe very close (with some changes) to currywurst from when I lived in Germany. Only used one can of tomato sauce. Didn't use the chili sauce at all (can't imagine how that would taste) instead added 2-3 tablespoons of curry. I also used 1 tablespoon on paprika. I used a package of brats instead of kielbasa, cut them up in to slices and browned them on the stove. once brown added the rest of the ingredients, brought to a boil then simmered 20min.

Quick, easy, and tasty!  We were just in Berlin in April and this recipe was almost exactly like what we had there on several occasions.  I did use bratwurst and knockwurst instead of kielbasa and only 1 small can of tomato sauce with ketchup making up the rest of the volume for the sauce as others have suggested.

Great recipe with acurate facts served commonly in Germany. The tomato sauce part of the recipe is off porportionally.  You could use just one 15 ounce can. Overall a great meal, though!

My husband is from Germany, we go there often and are both big fans of currywurst! This recipe was ok, but not the best. I will make it again, but ketchup with a few shakes of curry is also really good and takes less time.

This recipe tasted OK, but I won't make it again. I'd rather use  a little ketchup than 45 ounces of tomato sauce since I had lots leftover. My husband who lived in Germany for a while wasn't happy and will stick with ketchup and a couple shakes of curry powder.

Instead of kielbasa, Germans use a Knackwurst or a Rindswurst. A rindswurst is made out of beef and close to the Beef Hot dog. Knackwurst is made of pork.

I really liked this one!  I made some rice to go along with it.  My children wanted me to add more spices next time, but I told them that I really enjoyed the flavor and sometimes it's nice to eat foods that aren't spicy!
    This is a great party food for the kids.  Make some and watch the ball game!

This is a nice dish but it isn't currywurst if you're from Rhineland-Pfalz.  I lived in the Eifel for 9 years and currywurst there is a sliced grilled bratwurst, covered in ketchup with curry sprinkled on top.

I absolutely love this one!  I followed some reviewers suggestions of using Ketchup instead of tomato sauce, and to cut down on the amount of that as well.  I still end up with a TON of extra sauce.  I have a tendency to put too much Curry on it, but when I make it just for me it's no big deal.  I have made it for others as well, and they thought it was a real treat, and something a little different for a household more used to using Old Bay than Curry!

Made as is and very awesome!  Did add a little more curry powder and chili sauce since I like more spicy!

Have been to Germany many times and have never tried currywurst, but was always intrigued by it.  I was partial to Bratwurst and German mustard (the betst) and Weizen beer!

Will make again.  Probably with a beef hot dog instead this time.

I made it with Ketchup and honestly the scent totally reminded me of getting Currywurst on your way home at the train station in Regensburg!   No way would I use 3 cans of sauce, a can's worth is sufficient.  But with Ketchup there is a little vinegar bite to it.  I added the sugar like it said here that normally kicks that out.  Its a good quick and seriously close to Germany taste, Currywurst for the GO.

I took the advice of others and used ketchup instead of the tomato sauce.  It was good the night of, but it was fabulous the day after. Slice the cold currywurst thinly and serve with cheese and sliced baguette as a great party tray.

This is very good. I seldom measure anything exactly (except when baking). I made a small batch, used catsup instead of chili sauce and added a little red wine vinegar. We are having it tonight. I will used both bratwurst and knockwurst.

This was really tasty, reminds me a lot of the fatherland and meals I had in Frankfurt years ago.  I used garlic salt instead of onion, and added a pinch of garam marsala.  This one's going in my recipe box, thanks!

My husband has spent a few years in Germany as an exchange student, and in the military.  He was very excited about this recipe.  We used Bratwurst instead of the Kielbasa to make it more authentic.  He said that in Germany it's served over fries with a spot of mayo on top.  He really enjoyed this recipe and I will probably make this again for him, though it was a little spicy for me and the kids.  I'm not sure if it was the amount of pepper in the sauce, or the bratwurst.

NO Kielbasa, NO Bockwurst, it has to be a "BRATWURST"!! It is a pork sausage.
The cheap and easy way is Ketchup and Curry.

Yum! This dish was good with a side of rice and veggies. I used ketchup and a can of tomato paste with a bit of water. It was still too much sauce.  Added extra curry, less chili sauce and turkey kielbasa browned and heated in a pan instead it was good! I will make again, thank you!

I looked and looked at this recipe and although I usually follow a recipe to a "T" the first time I could not bring myself to use 3 cans of tomato sauce.  Then, I discovered I had no tomato sauce and used ketchup and chili sauce and sprinkled 1 tsp. of curry powder on top.  I guess it's nothing like the original.  I brought it to one of those pot-luck appy nights and it was a big hit so I've rated it four stars.

Good, but I like it better the easy way.  Brown a brat, put lots of ketchup on it, sprinkle a teaspoon of curry on it, and continue heating until bubbly.  My favorite curry for this recipe is by Spice Hunter.

After being married to a German (Coborg), I fell in love with German food, especially from Bavaria. Authentic currywurst is made with knockwurst or bratwurst. Kielbasa is Polish.

I grew up in Germany and had this dish almost every day in high school!  At that time, there were these little Imbus Stands all around that sold it with Pomme Fritz (french fries) and Brochen (hard roll).  Like everyone has been saying, the sausage should be knockwurst to be authentic.  This sauce was close but needs more curry and less tomato sauce.

Loved it!!! - Followed suggestion to just use 1 15 oz can tomato sauce (not 3) - this gives you more than enough sauce. Knockwurst instead of kielbasa - and alot of curry powder if you want the taste.
Leftover update: even with 1 15oz tomato sauce, there's still so much - I bought 3 more Knockwurst to add with the leftovers a couple of days later - no need to buy more sauce.

This was OK, not sure what to do with it but the tomato and the spice was a bit over powering the curry.  Next time I think I will add some brown sugar to have a bit sweet hot, and cook the sausage with the sauce.  but it was OK.

If you don't like the recipe for the sauce, you could buy some Curry Ketchup at the grocery store (the sharfes is better than the deilcatess).  I know Meijers (a big store in MI & OH) carries it.

I've sent some to my son back in the States.  He just can't get enough currywurst!

This is the best starting point I've found.  Like others I made changes.  Used Brat and Bockwurst.  Instead of tomato sauce I used half ketchup and half tomato paste.  Would use even less paste next time.  45-50 ounces of sauce in all.  Added double to triple the rest of the ingredients.  Also added some curry in addition to sprinkling it at the end.  I've eaten at Curry 36 in Berlin and was trying to recreate it.  This got very very close.

Excellent recipe. I read the reviews before making it, and only put in half of the tomato sauce. I still had too much. I made it for my German class for a food day. It was a hit with my students. Cooks easily in a crock pot.

More of a mock dish.The rolls spoken of can be bought at a french bakery or sometimes the supermarket( softer).Store them in a brown bag to harden them up.

After reading some of the comments, I added less tomato sauce (2 cans were plenty), bumped up the curry powder and paprika, and used Sriracha for extra zip. A little parsley for garnish worked well too.

I used the German sausage with herbs,  from Aldi,  but I am sure it is good with Kelbassa too.  I always used a packet of curry sauce from Knorr,  that I would pick up while in Germany,  but they have gotten so picky about seasonings coming into the us.,  that I'm happy to have this recipe....excellent.

Made this tonight and it was a hit. Instead of kielbasa, I got bratwurst sausage in the casings and cut them into coins. I fried them up in a skillet, covering occasionally to make sure they cooked through. For the sauce, I added 2 tbsp of curry powder cause I felt like a sprinkling of curry powder on top wouldn’t be enough. I mean, I really like curry, haha. Will add this to the rotation. Thank you!

This looks like a great recipe for SOMETHING, but whatever it is a recipe for just isn't currywurst.  Beyond the enormous amount of sauce being prepared, and the tiny amount of curry powder, the biggest and most obvious  difference is that currywurst is supposed to be made from bratwurst.

the hard part with a great curry sauce is it is really to taste.

family recipe, mix ketchup and a wedge of onion, the rest is really to taste.  brown sugar for sweetness, curry powder and paprika for some spice, and lemon juice.  normally use bratwurst....  even better the next day.

I've seen some people claiming it's this or that sausage.  It just depends on the region of Germany they've been too.  Each region will use a different sauce and wurst.  I prefer the Berlin version.  They created the currywurst and use an enhanced ketchup recipe and a white pork sausage.   A white bratwurst (not red).  Some will deep fry the wurst but it can be boiled or grilled as well.  This is fast food so nothing fancy.

This was really great! I used a veggie dog (due to being vegetarian) and everything still tasted the way that it's suppose to... I will for sure be making this again.

My kids love this recipe.  Thanks JenFen, for sharing!  My daughter had to bring in a food from her country report on Germany and this was a hit.

I made this recipe with knockwusrt instead of kielbasa and added more curry.   I also sliced them into small chunks and served them as an appetizer. Yum!  I would definitely suggest this tasty treat for your next party!

Not bad.  I added a lot more curry to the sauce though, otherwise it only tasted like tomato sauce as I simmered it.

This was not the most inspiring version of currywurst I've ever had. Quick though. I'd definately use way less tomato sauce next time.

Pretty good but makes way more sauce than needed. Even works in the crockpot. I'll have to try it with knockwurst sometime.

On advice of previous reviews, I used 1 cup tomato sauce and 1 cup ketchup, increased the curry alot, and added chopped onions. I sliced the keilbasas and fried them, then added the sauce and simmered about 20 minutes. It was good, but a little too spicey for me. I'll make it again but cut back on the curry powder. My guests loved this! I served it with a brown and wild rice mixture.
