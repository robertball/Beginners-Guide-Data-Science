I really enjoyed this smoothy. The flavours were fresh and balanced to leave a not-too-sweet fruit and yogurt taste. I did change a couple of things, instead of using ice cubes I froze my plain yogurt with the fruit mixed in and just used that. I did not add the flax meal. As written, I did not need to add any more juice because the consistency was perfect to drink through a straw. Thank you ellenchild for your refreshing recipe.

I had to use juice from concentrate - next time I'll try fresh squeezed. I also don't care for the honey, so I'll leave that out next time and I'll use milk instead of yogurt so it's less thick.

After a workout, I ate half an avocado on a rice cake but had half an avocado left that was going to go bad. I was in the mood for a smoothie so this looked great:) I can't have milk so I substituted the yogurt with almond milk and it still tasted wonderful. It reminds me of orange pushpops I used to have when I was a kid. It's healthy and delicious!

Was a wonderful and very tasty smoothie thanks to the reviews of others.  I used 1/2 of an avocado and fresh strawberries in place of frozen and also added the kiwi for some extra sweetness!

Nice and creamy smoothie. Quite thick, next time I may add only half of an avocado. Very tasty!

I double the recipe but when I got the second Avacodo it was to ripe. So I used 1 Avacodo that wasn't and 1 kiwi. It was great. Thanks for sharing.
