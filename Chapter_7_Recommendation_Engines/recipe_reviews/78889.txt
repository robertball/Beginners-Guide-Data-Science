I know this may shock some people, but, OK, I changed this a little bit when I made it. I used four pounds of chili cut meat, and substituted one can of crushed tomatoes for one tomato sauce. But this was one of the best chilis I've ever had, and I like chili! I put the ingredients in a large crock pot instead of back on the stove. Topped the bowls with shredded cheese and sour cream, and everyone loved it.

Well, it's a simple recipe, and I like the texture and look of it, but I did have to use 30 oz of tomato sauce, and I found the 3/4 cup chili powder to be just way too much. Next time, I'll use 30 oz tomato sauce and cut the chili powder down to about half.

This is a good recipe for those of us who like thick chili.  My husband is not fond of big chunks of tomato.  I'm confused as to why Andy used tomato paste.  No wonder his chili was dry. 
There's a big difference between paste and sauce.

This is an excellent chili recipe. I make it with a few changes and it is always delicious.

4 lbs. ground meat instead of 5
2 15 oz. cans of tomatoe sauce instead of 1
1 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes
1 14.5 oz can of beef broth
1 1.25 oz. package of chili seasoning
6 tbs. of chili powder
2 cans of kidney beans instead of 1

everything else is the same. This gives it a wonderful flavor and consistency. Either way you cook it this is good chili. Thank you MissCanada!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe "EXACTLY" as written. It totally annoys me when no one gives the exact recipe a chance BEFORE they make it. The description was clear, MEATY and NOT tomato-ey. Why complain it has to much meat and not enough tomato? And why say 5 stars when you mean, made your way? Once the recipe is altered, it is nolonger the original recipe is it?

Love how thick this chili is, even when made w/ 3 lbs. of ground turkey (you need to brown it in a little olive oil) instead of 5 lbs. of beef.  Tip for beginning cooks: when a chili recipe includes tomato "sauce", it doesn't mean pasta sauce, but  something like Hunt's "tomato sauce" which is basically tomato puree w/ a little salt.  In fact, canned tomato puree works just as well.

I also love that this recipe used fresh onions, peppers and garlic.  I added 2 t. dried marjoram and 1/8 t. cinnamon to compensate for the milder turkey taste.

For a potluck, I enjoy making this in a Dutch oven, then mixing up a batch of Southern-style unsweetened cornbread batter, pouring it on top of the chili and baking the whole thing uncovered on the top rack of a 375*F oven until the cornbread is set and lightly browned.

Dh loves this!  Made it tonight thanks to the cooler weather and it was a big hit - as per the other reviews, I used 2.5-3 lbs hamburger, 2 15-oz cans of tomato sauce, then filled one of the cans full of water (about 1 3/4 cups), and cut back on the chili powder (I can't imagine 3/4 of a cup) . Also added in a couple of beef bouillon cubes. Yum!  I look forward to seeing how it is the second day.

I like this chili a lot.  I froze some of the leftovers and used them for chili cheese fries and on baked potatoes later.

3/4 cup of chili powder... were you kidding?  You must buy in bulk:-)  This recipe has so much meat and veggies it was dry so I added more liquid.  To start with I used 29 instead of 20 ozs of tomato paste and I still found it too dry so I've added another 29 oz can (3 times what is called for) otherwise this is way too thick.

Used crushed tomatoes and two cans of beans. Left out the red pepper and used frozen diced onions and green peppers, salt and pepper. Reduced the amount of meat to half and it was still extremely meaty.

I thought this chili was wonderful! I used only 2.5 lbs of meat, and used 3 cans of tomato sauce and added 1 can of chili beans. Those were the only things I changed from the recipe. It was thick and delicious, but next time, I'm going to use some tomato juice to make it a little juicer. I do recommend this chili!

Oh, wow this is really good. I wasn't expecting it to taste like a close version of my grandfather's chili. I've made it twice and the 2nd time hit it right on the noggin. I doubled the kidney beans, the water, and used one can diced tomatoes and one can sauce. I also added 2 cans of Manwich sloppy joe sauce. I used about half cup of chili powder and 2tbls of brown sugar and 2 tbls of mesquite smokey flavor seasoning. With all the changes the chili is still very thick, a man's chili no doubt! Normally, I dont change the recipe so much but this was a great starter that got me back to my deceased grandfather's recipe. We havent had his chili in 12 years! Either way you make it 5 stars!

A couple of decades ago I had chili at a diner where it was served in a sundae dish with sour cream on top and surrounded by chips! I've been looking for a recipe like this ever since....PERFECT! A few changes:: I left out the green peppers...added 3.75 lbs beef, 2 cans mixed beans, large can of marzano crushed tomatoes, a couple extra garlic cloves, and a cup chianti.....

This is a pretty good recipe, but I am not a measure-er. I have made it several ways, I have used ground turkey, but I have NEVER used the 5lbs of meat it calls for. I do, however, always use a full can of beans, green pepper and red pepper. I sort of eyeball the chili powder and I add some salt to help season some and then I add some hot sauce (texas petes, tabasco, etc)- a few shakes.... and I too, top mine off with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and I do also enjoy it served with some nice fresh bakery bread on the side! VERY GOOD basic recipe though! :D

No flavor - after sitting in my crock pot for 4 hours, I had to add salt, more garlic and cumin and it was still bland.  The idea behind the chili is good, but be prepared to add more seasoning to get any flavor to this recipe.

I COULDN'T HAVE MADE ENOUGH!!!! I made it for friends, I expected it to be enough. BUT MAN WAS IT DELICIOUS!!! my husband LOVED it and our friends didn't stop eating, I thought I would have enough to bring to work the following day, but when I got up to get seconds, there was barely a spoon full left.  They wiped the 6qt pot clean!!!!!!! This will DEF. be cooked again in my house!!!

This is a good basic recipe.  I used two cans of beans and a 28oz. can of tomatoes.  I also added cumin and chipotle chili powder.  I substituted a bottle of our favorite beer for the water.  Served with cornbread and sides of sour cream and shredded cheese...our guests were very happy!

Oh MAN good! I added hot peppers instead of the sweet ones and added some cumin for personal preference. I also browned the meat then threw everything into my slow cooker and went to bed. With that said, this is an amazingly meaty and wonderful chili. It made a ton and it will feed me for a couple of weeks! (I will freeze some) SO GOOD!

I like the way this recipe looked simple.No 140 ingredients,simple.The only thing I would change is add cumin.After all cumin smells like chili.

I loved this chili, I made 18 servings and added 2 pounds of italian sausage instead of all ground beef.  I also added in several Jalapeno and Serrano peppers for spice.  I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I made enough for everybody at work and it was very well recieved.

For my first attempt at cooking, I thought I was in big trouble messing with Chili. But it came out great. I added some corn for color. A spoon of sour cream and a side of corn bread and it was the best.

The reviews help so much...I can't believe how good this recipe was and with the reviews I added extra stuff knowing that it was going to be thick with all that meat....I added an extra jar of pasta sauce, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, extra onions, g. pepper and r peppers.....I served this for a lot of company we had over the weekend and got wonderful reviews...I am actually going out today to make big batches for the freezer.....this one is a keeper!

If you are looking for a MEATY chili this is it! My husband suggested a meatier chili as opposed to a saucy one - for him this one was "PERFECT" 

I cut the recipe in half and cooked about 2.5 lbs of meat. And sprinkled chili powder to taste - not as much as directed. We sprinkled cheese and some sour cream on top too, it was just so tasty!! I will be making this one every time I make chili.

The first time I made it, it was really too thick for me, so I changed it a bit.  My version is still thick but as thick as the original; I've also changed this recipe to a lower fat version using 3 lbs. ground turkey (99% fat free). I seasoned the turkey with Worcestershire sauce, granulated beef boullion, Complete Seasoning, and my mother-in-law's sofrito.  Instead of using water, I used beef broth.  I also used 2 cans of chili beans in medium sauce, 2 cans of fire-roasted tomatoes with 1 can of tomato sauce. Because I have young children who do not like spice, I cut the chili powder back to 1/4 c. I added Tabasco to my personal bowl to increase the heat. Fairly Quick and easy for a weeknight supper.  If you want it last a couple of days, serve it over a 1/4 cup of Uncle Ben's Microwavable Pouch - type rice.  Delicious!

My husband said this was ok.  I reduced the chili powder as suggested by others, and the amount of spice was right.  He just didn't think it had the right consistency.  I guess he's more of a 'soupy' chili guy, but thanks for the recipe anyway.

EXCELLENT chili recipe.  I added a little extra water to make it the consistency I like and added chili powder to taste - not what the recipe calls for.  Great meaty chili, I don't like beans much so this was perfect.  This does make a lot so prepare to freeze some for later lunches :)

This is good stuff!  I made this and everyone that had some just loved it.  The first time I made it I only made half of what the recipe called for, but it was gone fast.  Next time I make it, I will make the full recipe.

Serving for four: 1 & 1/2 lbs hamburg, 1/4 cup each finely chopped carrots, onions, peppers and 1 clove garlic. I used 2 cans kidney beans and 1 can black beans (we like a lot of beans) 1/4 cup chilli powder and 1/4 bag taco seasoning, 1 quart (we canned them this summer) tomatoes (crush with your hands) and enough water to make it the desired consistency. After I browned the meat with the veggies, put it all in crock pot for about 5-6 hours low. Served with buttermilk skillet cornbread and you are set to go!!!

Very good recipe with just a few modifications.  We used stewed tomatoes & diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Also, used 1/2 C chili powder instead of 3/4 C.  We'll make this one again!

Excellent thick chili. Made this on group camping trip for our chili cook-off. Won 2nd. Some people wanted spicy, so next time I'll add habaneros to theirs. Very thick and tasty. Only had 3 lbs ground beef as someone used some for burgers, but also added a can of great northern beans for contrast and to replace the space of the missing meat.  Worked out well and even better the next day on chili-dogs.  Will definetely be using this recipe again.

This is my favourite recipe. Though I did make changes.. I seared beef stewing cubes and simmered it for up to 2 hours in beef broth until it was really tender. I then follwed the recipe and added the beef cubes and cooked it all together. I used a can of tomato puree and another of diced tomatoes. It was fantastic!

This is a really good starting point chili.  I used half of the meat and my husband still commented on how meaty it was. In his book, meaty = good.  I cooked it in a crock pot and as it simmered away I would periodically tasted it.  I was very acidic I combated that with a few tbsp of brown sugar.  I also used a can of diced tomatos in addition to the tomato sauce. And a green and yellow pepper as that is what I had on hand.  Yummy! I will definatly make this again!

Great recipe.  I substituted the kidney beans with chili beans...turned out great.  Perfect for "leftover night".  This fed my family for a few days.  To extend it a little longer, I added cooked spaghetti.

It's a good basic recipe.  I think it would be funnier if it had ground Chuck!

It was extremely meaty and went perfectly with crusty bread. However, despite using more tomato sauce than was stated in the recipe, I still found it a little dry. I would have liked more sauce especially since I was eating it with bread. Nonetheless, the flavour was awesome. I'd definitely make this again.

I followed the recommended changes... 1) cut meat portion in half,
2)used chili powder to taste, not the called for amount(ie lots less) 
3)added all the veggies I could think of to add... including all colors of bell pepper, mushrooms, zuchini, and 1 can diced tomotoes.  
4) topped with cheese and sour cream.
SO YUMMY!!

Simple, straightforward, minimal yet effective chili recipe! No surprise that I also took liberties here and there. Threw in one teaspoon each of cumin and paprika in addition to a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give an extra kick of heat. I also sprinkled some salt to taste but tried to keep that to a minimum. All the flavors come together beautifully and I would highly recommend these additions to make this recipe more dynamic/complex! Also thought about adding some lime juice and cilantro but decided against it...maybe those would work well too. To serve the chili, I topped off the bowls with some thick shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and plenty of green onions for garnish...just the way I like it and oh so good!!!

My husband loves meaty chili and this fit his bill! I added a few more garlic cloves, 30oz of tomato sauce instead of 20oz, and salt to taste. I also used 2 green peppers because I didn’t have a red one. Great recipe! Saved it to my favorites!

First time making chili and it turned out great.  It was a little too spicy for some of my family members so I think next time I'm only going to use half the chili powder.  Also, I added more beans, about 40 oz.

So good. As with most people, we make some slight variations. We use ground turkey for the meat. Instead of 2 cans of sauce, we use 1 can of sauce and 1 can of paste. If we don't have any fresh garlic, we will use Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic instead. And in place of regular chili powder, we often use Tastefully Simple Wahoo Chili seasoning. Out of all the changes we make though, the only one I feel is really a necessary change is the sauce/paste one. I just feel like it needs the paste to make it a little thicker.

Absolutely  delicious. Tweak to your heart's content while leaving this recipe as a base. Thick and meaty, this one calls for a repeat. I used a whole cup of chili powder, doubled the garlic and half the meat was hot Italian sausage, and I  added a can of corn, for example, and I'll go back to this to try other variations, depending what's in the pantry that day.

I've made this a few times now, and while I enjoyed it the first time exactly as written, I've come to love this as a starting point.  I usually adjust the recipe for 1 lb ground beef -- 1 can kidney beans, 1 can tomato sauce, 1/2 each green, red, and yellow bell peppers and onion (all diced) -- and instead of water, I use low sodium beef broth.  I use the chili-seasoning-mix-ii from this site (minus the flour and add some cayenne pepper for an extra kick) and this has become my go-to chili recipe.  But either way, the original recipe is great, too!   Will make again.

This was my first shot at making chili. Worked out pretty darn good.  Though I added more tomato sauce and a an extra cup of water.  As for the chili powder, I'm not sure how much I put in. My friends seemed to like as none was left after all was said and done.
