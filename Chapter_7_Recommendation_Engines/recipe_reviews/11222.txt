I have a family recipe that is almost exactly this one and it is one of my all time favorites. The cookies are thin and very crisp and even though I am a chocoholic to the max they are better than anything chocolate.

Great recipe. This is the one my mom made for my dad. He would dunk it in coffee and now so do I!
