Delicious! I served these as sliders for 1 meal, then as the meatballs for spaghetti another night. There’s a mistake in the recipe: the ingredient list calls for parmesan cheese, whereas the directions state to add “mozzarella” with other ingredients. I chose to use parmesan cheese and thought the flavor was excellent. I will make these again!

I made these using Bertolli Olive Oil & Garlic pasta sauce because it's what I had. I used parmesan cheese and put a little on the sauce. I was surprised how good these were. I've never had meatballs on bread, or chicken meatballs, so I wasn't sure what to expect. These were amazing! I served them with fresh basil.

Just made this tonight...really yummy.  Whole family enjoyed.  I used grated parmesan in meat mixture and mozzarella on top along with sauce.  I too made them into patties and cooked in skillet on stove.  Will definitely make again.

Really good.  I had to use ground turkey day it was still great.  Used Parmesan.  I am sure the mozzarella would be good also.

This was delicious and so yummy. I never had sliders before and I always wanted to try it. I made it last night--made 12 meatballs and added two meatballs per bun. Instead of slicing sandwiches, I brought sliders rolls at the store. So much easier. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

I must have done something wrong bc only one person (my 17 year old son) in my family of 5 liked these sliders.  Bun got way too soggy.  I think I’ll stick to breaded chicken for my Parmesan chicken and go back to the spaghetti noodles instead of buns.

I used a spicier marinara because I thought it might be a little bland. So glad that I did! These turned out to be really delicious, easy enough to make on a week night and definitely something I'd serve to company.

I made these into regular sized meatballs  for a pasta dish with creamy tomato sauce.  Very good, moist meatballs. Thanks for sharing.

This was amazing!! Only thing I changed was made the meatballs into patties so it would cover more of the slider bun.
