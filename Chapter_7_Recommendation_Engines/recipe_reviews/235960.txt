Tasty and a nice change from the usual ways I prepare pork tenderloin! I rubbed the spices on the night before and they really did infuse the pork w/ great flavor. We really enjoyed all the flavors going on in this. I served it w/ sauerkraut (that I baked in the dish w/ the pork) and mashed potatoes. I would def make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I made it for our community's potluck and was an instant hit! I received several requests for the recipe and asked to make it again. This is now a permanent recipe in my book.
