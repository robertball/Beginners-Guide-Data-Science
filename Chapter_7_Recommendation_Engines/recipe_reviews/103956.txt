Awesome.  Try grilling the fish ... we like it better that way.

This is a great recipe.  I used fresh squoze (sp?) orange juice with some orange zest rather than FCOJ, and doubled the lime and lemon juice amounts.  It was very bright, which I like.

No way am I going to marinade fish in that much acid for more than 30 minutes. Talk about rubbery, yuk!

Great citrus flavors - added some dill weed before serving.
