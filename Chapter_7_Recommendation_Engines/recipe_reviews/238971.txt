Kristi's Special Fried Rice Haiku: "Mmm mmm this was good. Used submitter's suggestion added chicken too." The recipe submitter mentions adding a protein so I marinated a cubed chicken breast in a mixey-uppey bag of soy sauce honey garlic and ginger along w/ taking Kristi's note of preparing the rice the day b4 to reduce my steps. Having all of the ingredients cut measured and prepped prior to beginning this recipe was key b/c it goes together FAST. After browning the chicken I removed and covered it to keep it warm then continued w/ the recipe as written only using an extra cup of cabbage to make up for not having bean sprouts. Other than a little extra squirt of soy sauce and sirarcha at the dinner table we thought this recipe was near perfect and our only concern was that it wouldn't have been as good w/o the extra flavor that the chicken and its marinade imparted on the dish; still it tasted like 5 stars to us!
