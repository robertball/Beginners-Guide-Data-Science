I made this incredibly easy cake for a potluck and it was devoured!  I like that it isn't loaded with sugar.  I'm definitely making this part of my "go-to" recipes.

I make this often. The recipe used to be on the bisquick box. I also learned to DOUBLE the topping mix! It's so much better. Also be generous with the oil to make it moist.

My mom used to make Bisquick coffee cake when I was a kid.  I used to love it.  This recipe was ok except for the cake being more dry than I remember. Anyone ever add any oil to make it more moist?  Oh, I did add 2 teas of vanilla to this recipe.
