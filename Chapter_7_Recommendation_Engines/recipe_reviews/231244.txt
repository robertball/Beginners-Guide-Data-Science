I really liked the flavors in this quiche, but it seems as though 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream would have been too much.  I stopped at 1 cup after pouring and I'm glad I did.  The combination of swiss, asparagus, baby bella mushrooms, and of course BACON makes a delicious quiche.  Thanks!

Oh my goodness this is delicious! Hubby and I decided we were in the mood for breakfast for dinner, so I decided to make this quiche. I made it exactly as written and it was FABULOUS! The eggs have such an amazing creamy taste; I could just eat them plain! All the other ingredients go so well together. I wouldn't change a thing! I can see myself making this for company as it's very impressive. I like that this has no crust, so I can fit it into my low-carb diet. Thanks for the great recipe, Nikki!

Thank you, thank you for submitting this recipe! My husband and I are on Atkins and doing the Phase 1 Induction. Allrecipes.com is my go-to site for recipes, and just by chance I thought I'd use Atkins Induction as my search criteria. This is the only recipe that came up and it looks a.MA.zing. Thanks again! (PS - Love all the helpful reviews!)

Unbelievably good!  The combination of crimini mushrooms, Swiss, bacon and asparagus was perfect.  I always thought that a "flavorful" quiche had to have tomatoes and cheddar.  And, HAD to have a crust.  This recipe has changed my mind.  I only added 1 cup cream, and added in two more eggs.  The texture was perfect, it rose up beautifully, and it was cooked consistently throughout.  May add a bit more Swiss cheese next time.  My family asked that I make this for our Christmas morning brunch.  Thank you.

Excellent flavor from the combination of asparagus, mushroom, bacon, and Swiss cheese. The generous use of heavy whipping cream in the egg mixture produces a fluffy (airy) custard. That was fine for a change of pace but prefer a slightly denser version. Thankfully, followed several reviewer’s suggestions to use only 1 cup heavy whipping cream (vs. 1-1/2 cups), and subbing milk for the difference. Because the flavor is so good, I’ll make this again but experiment with 1-1/2 cups half & half to better suit our tastes while eliminating about 90g fat/750 kcal from the entire quiche. A very good dish overall that can easily be customized to suit individual preferences.

Experiment - always fun with quiche.  This is a modified version of Nikki's recipe.  I break the asparagus and use the lower portion for sauteing along with the other ingredients: bacon, red pepper, mushrooms, garlic, and a blend of 4 cheeses.  The top of the asparagus is not cooked before setting it on top of the quiche before baking - cooks up well in the oven.  Toss in some cayenne pepper or other hot-stuff if you like.

Enjoy

This was my first ever attempt at a quiche. I wanted to try crustless since I am trying to maintain a low carb diet. Made it for my wife and I and could not have been happier. Easy to follow recipe and tasted fantastic. My wife l loved it and took leftovers to work to brag on her husband the cook. She said it's too bad we didn't take a picture of it since it was so pretty.

I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE FOR YEARS BUT ALWAYS JUST USED 1 C WHOLE MILK AND ADDED 1-1/2 TSP OF BOUQUET GARNI SPICE.  I SOMETIMES OMIT THE MUSHROOMS AND ADD 3 CHOPPED GREEN ONIONS IF FEEDING KIDDIES.  THE BOUQUET GARNI SPICE (BY SPICE ISLANDS) MAKES THIS DISH.  I BAKE @ 375 FOR ABOUT 45 MIN. UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN ON TOP.

This is fabulous!  The creamy consistently is perfect. I used 8 eggs and 2 cups of cream for a 9 x 13. I also lowered the heat to 375 and baked for 40 minutes or so. Thank you...can't wait to try with different fillings!

I have to admit that I messed with this recipe a lot, but I would have never thought of combining asparagus, mushrooms and bacon in a quiche. This is how I use up the asparagus that's always leftover because I'm the "only one who likes it!" So I use a can of crescent rolls to line a square, 2-qt baking dish as the crust. Then I fry up the bacon, drain the fat and toss in the chopped leftover asparagus to coat with flavor. I use 6 eggs and 1 can evaporated milk. This has fast become a favorite meal of even the asparagus-hater in the house! Thanks for the inspiration.

Loved the simple and easy recipe. I added self rising flour- 1 serving spoon to add a little thickness and crustiness. Also some oregano and chili flakes added to the flavor. Next time I'm planning to add Bisquick-mix, to make the overall quiche more heavier

This just didn't hit the mark for us, primarily because of texture, which was more like a very bland custard. As I read the recipe, I thought it would be way too much cream. I was right, at least for our tastes. I make a lot of quiches and frittatas and should have known better. I'll stick with the crustless spinach quiche recipe from this site as a base, and add ingredients from there.

I didn't have the listed ingredients so I improvised. It still turned out awesome!!  Didn't have Heavy Cream used ~ half a cup of unsweetened coconut milk, didn't have Bacon used leftover pork burger, didn't have asparagus used leftover green beans and cherry tomatoes, didn't have Swiss Cheese used an Italian blend.  Moral to this story; a good recipe with all sorts of ingredients!!

I made this recipe with half & half and thought it was just fine without the extra calories and fat in cream. As others suggested, I used vegetables I had on hand---onions, red peppers, and drained frozen spinach---plus the bacon and cheese. My husband said it was the best quiche he has ever had.

This is definitely quick and easy to make but it came out really soggy (I used half and half and wonder if it's my fault, though the 4 stars is for the lack of seasoning).  The asparagus came out way overcooked - next time I'd undercook them.  There needs to be a little seasoning, I think that next time I'd throw a few glugs of balsamic vinegar in with the asparagus and mushrooms, and cook until it carmelizes onto the vegetables and that would be enough.  The only thing about this recipe is that I wish there was less cream  - I felt so guilty eating it.

I made this last night and it was AMAZING.  I doubled the bacon and cheese.  I also used maple bacon and added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Best quiche ever!

My husband said that he thought that this was one of the best quiches he has ever tasted.  “Even without a crust?” I asked.  He hadn’t noticed there was no crust which proves that this is one very flavorful quiche.  I used nitrate free apple wood smoked bacon from Trader Joe’s and 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup 2% milk.  I think that using all heavy cream might have made it a tad too rich for our tastes.  Reheated gently in the microwave day two it was still just as delicious.

My husband and I really enjoyed the combination of vegetables.  I did add about a1/4 cup chopped onion with the asparagus and mushrooms.  I used the McCormick's garlic pepper grinder blend for the seasonings.

Very good recipe. As it says you can add other things. I didn't have asparagus or mushrooms so I added green beans and onions. Also no Swiss cheese so I added provolone. Instead of heating up the oven I cooked the bacon in my cast iron fry pan and also cooked the whole thing in the fry pan on top of the stove. Turned out really good.

Love this quiche. This is the first one I've made at home and I thought it was really lovely. I used a touch more salt then called for, and used canadian bacon in place of regular (but still used bacon grease to saute the veggies in). The only thing I wish I'd made sure to do was get all the liquid out of the mushrooms and drained them really well before adding to the base - I had a fair amount of liquid I had to drain off. I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella, and probably closer to 3/4 - 1 cup instead of 4-oz. So creamy and delicious. We all enjoyed this one!

A new family favorite. The combination of flavors blend into an amazing taste. I split the mixture into four portions and make smaller, single serving pies to take to work. Delicious!

I didn't have access to crimini mushrooms or green asparagus, so I used normal brown mushrooms and white asparagus.  It still turned out delicious!  I'll be making this again in the future.

We are vegeteranian so we did not use bacon.  Instead we used the asparagus, mushrooms & spinach with a sweet onion. Delicious. I doubled the recipe. Yum-yum-yum. We love this recipe!!!

Absolutely the best crustless quiche recipe out there.  Made as is so changes. Thank you for posting.  It is a family favourite and I have made it multiple times.  People cannot believe there is no crust and don't miss it at all.  Use whatever veggies you have in your fridge and voila a lovely quick evening - I serve it with potato salad.

I made this last night. Very good recipe, but I also cut the cream down to 1 cup. May also try again using half and half. But overall flavor was great.

We didn't have high hopes for this, but thought it would be a decent, quick, low-carb dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised because it was delicious and satisfying--didn't even miss the crust!!I added salt & pepper to the veggies while they were cooking and topped it with fresh, grated Parmesan cheese when it came out of the oven. We'll be having this again!

I've made this twice now. First time exactly as the recipe instructed. Second time I swapped out bacon for ham and used 1% milk as that's what I had on hand. Delicious both times, thanks for the recipe!

Although we like asparagus, we didn't like it in this quiche.  Too much heavy cream for us and not enough eggs.

I used 6 eggs instead of 4 as I thought that amount of HWC would mask the egg flavour. I used a package of pre-cooked pancetta instead of bacon but still cooked it in a skillet to remove some of the grease. And I added some red onion as well. I didn't have swiss cheese so I used cheddar. First time making it and I loved it!

I made the recipe exactly to the recipe!  I made it for my Bible study group and they loved it!  I have also substituted broccoli once for the asparagus and it was great.  There was more cheese and heavy cream than most quiche recipes.  If you have good heavy cream it will reduced while baking.  The cheese seems to melt into the cream/egg mixture, setting up thick custard. That easily cuts into wedges if given a chance to rest a bit.

Very tasty; the whole family loved it.  I didn't have mushrooms, so didn't add those, but it didn't affect the flavor.  I did add about a teaspoon of Italian herbs to the egg mixture though.  That definitely improved the flavor profile.  The original recipe doesn't specify quantity of ground pepper.  I added 1/8 teaspoon and that worked well.

Wow!  This was a fantastic recipe, that I made exactly as written.  It is Paleo Friendly and easy to make....a big hit at our brunch for staff and musicians at church on Easter.  The flavors were fantastic and I loved that there was no crust.  I didn't miss it at all, and I usually love the crust!  Some reviewers changed out the heavy cream or reduced the amount of it, but I didn't and was very happy with the results.  Definitely one I will make again!

Tasted wonderful.  I made a couple of the suggested changes by other reviewers--doing 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 milk, and adding 1/3 cup of bisquick.  I'll definitely make it again.

Were doing Low Crab meals and this was so good. No crust. I used thick cut applewood smoked bacon from a butcher shop. Substituted the asparagus for fresh spinach. Used 6 eggs and baked it 10 minutes longer. It was so yummy.

Super tasty - switched up a little bit though. 

Only used 1c heavy cream, added 1 extra egg, and more bacon. 

Very fluffy and flavorful, cooked perfectly in 30mins

I make this all the time now. I fry the bacon asparagus and mushrooms together in the bacon grease, drain the fat, and line the bottom of the pie dish like a “crust”. Scramble the eggs and seasonings together and pour it over the bacon mixture. I use milk sometimes if I don’t have cream. I eyeball it, and add garlic and onion powder to the egg. Top with shredded cheese and bake! I add more cheese to the top five minutes before its done. Goes great with Tabasco or sriracha!

This was delicious and you don't miss the crust(well, maybe a little!) I doubled the recipe as I had lots of thin, tender asparagus to use. The only difference I made was to leave out the mushrooms and I used fat-free Half and Half, because that's what I needed to use up! But it came out beautifully and I served it with a salad for dinner. My husband and I ate the whole thing! Luckily saved one for my son and family!

Very nice flavor.  I especially liked the Swiss cheese in this quiche.  I usually use cheddar but liked this very much.  I did caramalize both some onions and the mushrooms.  Next time I'll add red peppers, I think.  An especially good recipes if you're avoiding carbs.

I actually changed a few things:   I am vegetarian, so NO bacon.  I substituted the swiss cheese for what I had on hand - lite cheddar.  I planned to use skim milk instead of the whipping cream, but I absentmindedly forgot to put in the milk.  It turned out very delicious!!  I will definitely make this again!

Very easy...I wasn't in the mood to make a quiche with crust, so this recipe was  perfect.   The taste was very good (of course, bacon with anything rates top shelf in my book)!   I didn't have asparagus, but I did have a mix of kale, spinach and swiss chard on hand.  I also sauteed two minced garlic cloves and two tablespoons of chopped onion along with the mushrooms.  Since I didn't have heavy cream,  I used one  cup of skim evaporated milk that I always have in my pantry and made the recipe as stated.  My Hubby and I certainly enjoyed it.  I will  be making this again.

This was good. I love the asparagus and baby Bella mushrooms combo. I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup skim milk. I also used whatever cheese I had on hand (a little each of mozzarella, provolone, and Parmesan).   I used 6 pieces of bacon, 1 bundle of asparagus and almost a whole pint of mushrooms.  I did have to cook a little longer than it says to get it done in the middle.

Absolutely scrumptious! My husband forgot to pick up the asparagus, so I had to make it without it. I added an extra egg, more bacon, chopped green onions and, a few minutes before it was finished, I added extra Swiss cheese to the top. Everyone devoured it, including my mushroom-hating son, and my husband who thought quiches were for chicks only!

Drizzle oil over spears (saving a few tips to decorate top of pie) and chopped onion/shallot, then roast in toaster oven @ 500 / 12-15 mins., let cool.  Use 1 cup of milk only, either all half&half OR 1-half cup 1% or skim  + 1-half cup 18%.  And five vs 4 eggs, IF room.  Nutmeg and Cayenne!
Alternatively, use a fresh tomato instead of asparagus.

Major hit with my family! I wouldn't change a thing first time. I've made it so many times I began to tweak recipe but there really is no need to. I added one additional egg to mixture and topped Swiss cheese with tomatoes. So flavorful!!!  I did not slice mushrooms too small, they seem to overcook, in my opinion. Best quiche ever! Also, don't be shy with the veggies! It can always use a tiny bit more than less!

A friend made this for us and it was so yummy I'm trying it tonight for dinner. She said it was easy-peasy too. Atkins friendly and it tastes decadent!

Wonderful recipe, and I did not alter a thing! Served this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone wanted the recipe.
