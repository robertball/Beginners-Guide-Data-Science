I made it exactly as specified. The sour cream did thicken and reduce down. My issue was my pork chops weren’t as tender, and I let it naturally release pressure for 18 minutes. My pork chops were a little less than one inch thickness so it shocked me they weren’t fork tender. These were okay, but not jaw dropping “wow”.

1.18.20 Followed this recipe to the letter, and after cooking was complete and pressure released naturally, I thought the broth was a little bland. I added some rosemary and thyme which really perked it up the flavor to delicious. Cooked the gravy down for about 15 minutes, and it was still very thin, so I did add just a bit of a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. I thought cooking the chops on a trivet was an excellent idea, and I’d never seen that before…just makes sense to me. Doesn’t seem to matter how I cook pork chops (even Heritage pork) these days, it’s just never tender, and that, again, was the case here.  So I just look at it as IT-IS-WHAT-IT-IS.  With the modifications I made to the gravy, these were OK, but I’m pretty close to giving on pork chops in general. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
