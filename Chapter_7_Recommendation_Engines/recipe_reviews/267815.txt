This recipe is AMAZING!!! I used boneless chops, about an inch thick, and they came out so tender and juicy. The mushroom sauce is the best I’ve ever had. Definitely making this again!

Husband loved this, we had it two nights ago and wants it again tomorrow night. We did use a jar of mushrooms  instead of fresh and it was just as good. Our chops were very thick, but temained moist and juicy.

These are the best Pork chops ever.  Tender.  Moist.  Flavorful.  I'll be making these again and again.  The only change I'll make will be to make 1-1/2 times the amount of sauce so there will be plenty to spoon over the noodles I serve on the side.  I used dry sherry for the wine.  Same wine I use for my chicken ala King.  I did use a jar of drained mushroom slices instead of fresh mushrooms to cut the prep time and it was still deelish.

After I took the chops out of the pan, it seemed pretty dry, so I added some butter to it.  I also sauteed the mushrooms with the onions in the butter and sprinkled with some garlic powder.  I didn't want to open a bottle of wine, so I  used a combination of white cooking sherry and cooking marsala.   I baked for 50 min. covered.  This was excellent.

Good recipe.  i followed 100%. i have made the same basic meal in the slow cooker. I prefer that method ,however this is a lot faster and almost as pleasing. Served with steamed asparagus  and mini carrots.

Loved it; will absolutely make this again. Should be good leftovers, too. (Used four butterfly thick chops, cooked in 7x11 dish.)

Due to my gluten free diet,I had to modify this recipe.I ditched the cream of mushroom soup, for canned gluten free Progresso French onion soup and reduced the sauteed onions to 1/2 cup. I added some Thyme seasoning and garlic powder to the soup,and thickened with xanthan gum,about 1/2 teaspoon. I added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese when the french onion soup/  mixture was at a simmer. Once the mixture was thickened, I poured it over the pork chops and baked. I served thos eith gluten free egg noodles,and sauteed green beans. Very delicious!
