This recipe caught my eye since I always have mojo on hand. Great citrus flavored ribs that are fork tender.

First time making ribs in my pressure cooker. They were perfectly cooked and the citrus flavor couldn't be any better. This will definitely be a regular for us.

Our family liked the ribs prepared this way.
