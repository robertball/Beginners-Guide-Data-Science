Easy and delicious! I made a few changes based on what I had (and what I didn't.) I used dried basil instead of pre-made pesto and when I browned the chicken breasts i put garlic in with the olive oil. I also didn't have the broccoli so I left those out. A nice and simple dish. Enjoy!

I think I would have enjoyed this recipe more with less pesto.  The creamy tomato sauce on it's own would have been was delicious.

This recipe was very good. I put a little Parmesan cheese on top and it made it better. I noticed that instead of eating it straight from the stove top that it was better to let it sit for a few minutes first. It made the sauce stick a little better and thicken up a bit. Very good, and I will make it again!

This was very good. I changed a few things because of what I had on hand. I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, I used herb & garlic cream cheese instead of plain cream cheese & I didn't add the pesto. I really enjoyed it & will make it again :)

I used ingredients per recipe.  Was short on time, so cooked chicken in one skillet and started tomato mixture in another.  He summed it up best, "has great flavor, but doesn't jump out at you".  think unlike others, next time I will add a bit more pesto, but could just be our taste preference.  I did have the leftovers two days later and was almost better, maybe key is to let it cook and simmer together longer.  

This is a great recipe, very quick and easy to prepare and we will be eating again.

My family loved this dish.  I used 28oz diced tomatoes and I did not remove the chicken from the pan.  I let it all cook and simmer together.

I'm a great cook, so I think my husband takes the taste of our regular meals for granted. However, there was something about this one that he commented twice on how good he thought it was. My only changes were sauteing a couple cloves of garlic in the oil before adding the chicken, making homemade pesto and adding at least twice as much as was written in the recipe, and simmering the chicken for 30 minutes. It was easy to put together and it tasted good on this early fall evening.

The whole family loved this - 2 helpings each!  It was easy & we'll definitely be having it again.  This sauce would be great just as a pasta sauce with meatballs also.

Used pre cooked,  shredded chicken and dried basil instead of pesto.  Wanted to get rid of some leftover pasta sauce.   Worked well.   Will make again.

Very good chicken pasta recipe. I agree, there could have been a little less pesto. Will have to do that next time I make this. I added a little bit of garlic and a pinch of Italian seasoning. Also added in an extra 1/2 cup of broccoli and 28 oz of the diced tomatoes. Very creamy, very delicious.
