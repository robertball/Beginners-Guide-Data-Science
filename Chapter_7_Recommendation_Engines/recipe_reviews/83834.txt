This was good but while we were WAITING for the stuff to freeze a friend made something similar - used 4 oz of root beer schnapps, 4 oz vanilla vodka; 2 cups of vanilla ice cream, 5 cups of ice and blended until smooth. A wonderful root beer smoothie for adults.  This served 3 (in large glasses!).

Most excellent. Love it. I took Rita's suggestion and took the schnapps and the ice cream and the vodka, only leaving out the ice, and blended it up nice and pretty in my blender. Very nice. I had to convince myself that I didn't need another one.

Ok so my fianc√© requested this for his birthday he loves root beer. Me not so much so I replaced the root beer with cream soda. Was good once you got use to it. But that first drink it sorta punches you... lol guess that's the 99 proof!
