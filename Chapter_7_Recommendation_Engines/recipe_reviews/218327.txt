I make these the same way except two things...I boil a large pot of water, remove it from the heat and bathe the peppers in the hot water for 5-10 minutes.  Then I partly cook the ground beef with the onions and garlic and drain, so I can get the grease out of the ground beef.  Then I fill the peppers with the exact ingredients you have listed on your recipe and they go in the oven for about 45 minutes or so.   Sometimes after they come out of the oven I top them with shredded cheese.  This is a fantastic recipe and thank you for reminding me of it...I have not made this in years, so this weekend Stuffed Green Peppers we will have.

I made this recipe a little different; I browned the ground beef first then mixed it with the celery, tomato sauce, garlic, celery, cooked rice and cilantro.  Then I used that mixture to stuff the peppers and cooked them for only 30 minutes.  Came out delicious!  My husband ate it up!

Delicious, fast and easy!  Would've given it 5 stars but it was a little runny/watery.  It didn't affect the taste but it wasn't pleasant to serve to guests so drippy.

Pretty delicious!! Although, I must admit I changed the recipe around.
I dont eat beef, so i used turkey instead.
And instead of tomato sauce i used "EL PATO" sauce, the yellow one. Because i love spicy food.
I also added monteray jack cheese into the mixture and sprinkled plenty on top.  i love cheese!

Great flavor, changed it a little bit, I cooked the beef first didn't use an egg and did what one review said and added cilantro. I also used mamwich instead of tomato sauce. Put a little olive oil on the outside of the peppers and broiled them on high for about 10 minutes, Weren't runny/watery or bland at all.

Pretty good.  My only complaint is that there's a lot of liquid making things runny.  Next time, I might remove the foil for the last 20 minutes of baking.

My hubby loves my stuffed peppers.  Tonight I used red peppers (on sale), microwaved a couple of minutes. Hubby likes the peppers really cooked.  Then I  stuffed them with a "meatloaf" mix of beef, pork, veal, breadcrumbs, egg, onions, cooked brown rice, little marinara, and of course FRESH GARLIC!  Baked 350 for 20 minutes, then top with mozzarella and romano cheeses, bake 10 more minutes.  Add extra marinara on top if needed.

Used way less tomato sauce, and had some orange bell peppers that needed to be used.

Very tasty and I cooked the meat before I stuffed them and it was great my family could not get enough.

These are okay but there is not too much flavor. They were very soggy with a lot of liquid in the pan. I think it would be a good idea to brown the meat first.

I saw this recipe and I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted 15 oz fresh chopped zucchinis for the mixed veggies. also i had to omit the green onion and garlic as I didn't have any but it was still delicious after it was cooked I sprinkled cheese over top and served it with mashed potatoes and sliced avocado.

Remember to always make a few slits in the bottom of the pepper to let the fat run out.  I don't use canned mixed vegetables except sometimes corn. Take a look in your fridge & see what veggies might be ready for veggie heaven.  Chop them or shred them & add to beef mix.   I don't use a whole pepper.  Instead I slice them in half long ways & then fill them.  Personal choice.  These also go great in a pressure cooker.  Mine is electric.  20 minutes

This is a good recipe but try it with beef, pork and veal mixture instead of plain beef.

I made this the other day.  There is no way this makes 4 servings.  I used it on four large peppers the first night, but still had over half of the mixture left over.  I froze it, and it stayed wonderful.  The second go around, I was able to fill 5 HUGE peppers.  The taste was wonderful the first night, when I made it with green peppers, but the second time I used red peppers, and it was even better.  Also, the second night I didn't have any more tomato sauce to top with, so I used what I had on hand, which was a can of Hunt's spaghetti sauce.  In my opinion, it had just a bit more kick, and hubby and I enjoyed it even more.  Very good recipie, and easy to modify to one's particular taste.  Next time, just as a preference, I will probably use a bit more rice in mine.  Definately worth trying . . .

Like someone else's review, I had more than twice what I needed to fill the peppers.  I just don't get it.  It is okay as I also froze the mix and I will use it next week.  I did use turkey instead of ground beef just to try it out as we like our chili made with ground turkey.  It give a cleaner flavor some how.  Why is it others are not saying the same thing about the volume?   Peppers from Ralph's or Sprout's are the same size. Are there some Giant bell peppers I don't know about?

Disappointing. Too oily/greasy to enjoy. If I make these again, I'll pre-cook and drain the meat. That should solve the problem. I did add a quarter tsp. of crushed red pepper, as I could see that they'd be bland otherwise.

I used half Italian sausage, half hamburger, rice, and a can of Rotel.  I cut the peppers in half and cooked on low in the crock pot. Very good.

The flavour didn't wow me.  Sauce too runny.
