I liked this recipe, but found the rolls to be a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Thank you, these will be great with our turkey dinner.

I used half scalded milk and half buttermilk.  The only other change I made was using 4 cups of Whole wheat flour and about the same amount of regular flour...the dough was pretty sticky so I had to add more flour.  
Excellent taste- my husband looked at the color said Pumpkin huh?  But he had seconds!!
