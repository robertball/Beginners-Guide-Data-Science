This recipe should cover 15 cupcakes, so if you need more or want to cover a cake, make sure you adjust by doubling the recipe. I find that a hand mixer works best when blending the powdered sugar in. This icing is very sticky, just keep that in mind! I transfer the icing after blending into a pastry bag and I pipe it onto the cupcake. Make sure you don't put too much onto the cupcake because it spreads out, more so if the icing is still warm. If yoou let it cool, it will hold it's shape better. Just make sure you mix it well if you decide to let it cool so the icing is smooth. I also tend to pipe my icing on thicker, so I only get about 15 cupcakes covered with this recipe, but you may get more than that. If you need to frost more cupcakes, make you double the recipe to accomodate your needs. Yes, this is sweet, yes the icing is thick and sticky to work with. I really highly recommend using this on the Cookie Dough Cupcakes from this site. Please follow the recipe before winging it and rating it badly. Like I mentioned, keep in mind this is sweet and not a fluffy icing before you make it.

So delicious and rich! I let the icing cool to room temperature, stirring it every few minutes. When I frosted the cupcakes, the swirls didn't melt away. I used this frosting on both chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Easy to follow recipe with ingredients I had on hand. I was expecting more Milky Way flavor - but it mainly just tasted like a sweet glaze. I just read Pam-3boysMama's review after seeing her photo: I think it's a great tip, to let the icing come to room temperature so it holds a swirl. It looks prettier than the glaze that just oozes down the sides. *Overall, fun recipe to try, just didn't pack the flavor I wanted/expected.

Perfectly perfect! I LOVED this even more than I expected. I paired it with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough + Cupcake recipe from this site. Delicious cold as well :) I doubled the recipe for 24 regular cupcakes and 6 mini cupcakes. Thanks MSC!

Yum,Yum. Do a small (8") cake. Put one layer on dish and spread 1/2 icing on that.Top with second layer and spread remaining icing on that then drizzle with caramel or chocolate icecream topping . Can refrigerate to keep firm.

I was somewhat disappointed, especially since some reviewers raved excitedly about this.  I was expecting something unique as well as distinctly tasting of Milky Way candy bars.  I have to agree with those reviewers who found this overly sweet with not much flavor,

I wasn't sure after reading the review if this was going to be a hit for us, but I'd bought the Milky Way candy, so I forged ahead. I frosted Martha Stewart's yellow buttermilk cupcakes. Cut back on the butter and increased the milk a bit. Didn't measure the powdered sugar, just added and mixed with a hand mixer until it was the consistency I wanted. Even after chilling in the fridge, it coats the cupcakes more like a glaze than a frosting. My husband's comment was, "It's ok, but not one of my favorites." I'll take a few to work tomorrow and see if they're more of a hit there.

This was met with mixed reviews. The texture is very thick-- almost like fondant.  If people aren't expecting the chewiness they are really caught off guard.  Very sweet! (you are adding a cup and a quarter of sugar and butter to FOUR Milky Way bars :) )

It's a decent, easy recipe. Extremely sweet. I was expecting better after reading all the glowing reviews. A few of my guests liked it a lot, but most of us thought it was just okay.

Wow!  Just a warning - this is only for people with a sweet tooth.  Lucky for me, I have a major sweet tooth!  This icing is just wonderful.  It has a lot of Milky Way flavor and tastes just like the candy bar.  It is perfect on vanilla cupcakes.  I let it cool to room temp and piped it onto the cupcakes.  It frosted about 16 cupcakes for me.  I completely licked the bowl clean, I couldn't help myself.  Thank you for this amazing recipe, MySweetCreations!

WOW, what can I saw about this one.....SWEET!!!! EYE Rolling Greatness. OH HOLY COW, batman!!!! 1st of all, I ment to make this a couple of weeks ago, and I had been eyeing every photo since. I made this 3x, 1st batch I totally goofed on BIGTIME!! It wasn't melting down like I thought it should and by the time I added the c.s. and tasted it...it tasted burnt and was thick like fudge....didn't taste at all well. So when I was making the 2nd batch(I'll get to that in a sec, because it's different) I realized I didn't need to overly nuke the tar out of it. STAY WITH INSTRUCTIONS. The 2nd batch turned out totally awesome as far as following the instructions as written, and same with the 3rd batch. Now back to the 2nd batch. When I picked up the candy bars, I saw the 3 Musketeer Mint Mini bag, and thought, hmmmm, we love mint..can I adapt the recipe to it? It worked beautifully. So 2nd batch was made with a 9oz bag of Mint Minis and I replaced the vanilla extract with Pure Mint extract, and it wasn't overly powerful in mint, it was just right....OMG!! So the only thing was, I did see reviews that said to wait to frost when the icing came to room temp or cooled. I did that and I totally waited 2 hours after my cupcakes cooled, it set up nice, but quickly started to flatten. I think it would need 2 1/2 more cups of c.s. to totally stand up and not flatten. However, I'm not going to change it anytime soon, just use less icing to each cup cake and be happy happy. TY!!! WE

Wowza was this sweet, definetly needs to be paired with a cake that isn't too sweet. I think next time I make it I'm going to try using Milky Way Dark bars and see how that turns out, I can't wait to make this recipe again:)

I used this to frost the Chocolate Bacon cupcakes from this site.  I thought that the saltiness of the caramel would go well with the sweet/salty flavor of the cupcake.  I was right - this icing was perfect.  It really is simple to make.  After I was done blending it, I put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes to set up and then piped it onto the cupcakes.  I wish that I had chosen a different tip for the piping, but that is my fault.  Will use again and again.  I am going to try this on yellow cupcakes very soon.  What a delicious, creative recipe.

This recipe is perfect as is.....loved it!!! I could have eaten this icing all by itself!!!   LOL....topped Brownie Batter + Cupcake = The SECOND BEST CUPCAKE recipe on this site. It was an amazing combo!! Yes the icing is on the loose side ( but it so does not matter!)  and I did let it cool before topping the cupcakes as others suggested. So yummy....will make again!

I'm not a frosting lover...I'd rather eat cake plain than frosted but can't do that when baking for others.  This frosting is so sweet but soooo good!  I paired it with the Simple White Cake recipe from this site and it was the perfect balance because the cake wasn't too sweet.  I was able to frost 22 cupcakes with one batch of frosting, probably because I frosted them with a knife and wasn't too generous with it because it was so sweet.  Make sure that your cupcakes are cooled as well as the frosting.  So good, and so easy to make!

You have to know going in to this recipe that it will be sweet.  That's the point, isn't it!  This recipe very nicely covered 35 of my Sweet Vanilla Cupcakes in mini size.   I'm glad I followed MySweetCreations's advice and used a piping bag (well, a quart-sized Ziplock freezer bag) because it just made it easier to handle.   I'll be glad when I get better at decorating so they look more professional!  My granddaughters are going to LOVE these!

This was very good, very sweet, but good. It is a must to let it come to room temp before attempting to ice the cake. (Trust me). It's also very thick and a little tricky to work with, but the end result is delish. Also, it took more like two minutes in the microwave, stirring frequently. This would be fabulous on Boston Cream Pie.

Couldn't stop myself from licking the spoon!  Milky Ways are my favorite candy bar so I was excited to try this.  Made this to top Marianne's Sweet Vanilla Cupcakes and it was perfect.  I let the icing cool a bit before I spread it on the cupcakes with a knife.  Very tasty.

very easy to make and sweet. Perfect for the cookie dough cupcakes! I let it sit at room temp. for about 20mins and it set really well on top of the cupcakes and held its form.

Yum! I used this as a filling for a yellow cake for my son's birthday. He loved it! I did thin it out a little bit, and I cut the sugar down a little, since I was going to be icing the cake with a frosting that I know is super sweet. Very good. I will use this again. Next time on cupcakes. I just really didn't want to wait until I got another chance to bake. This recipe has been calling me since it got published :) Thanks!

WOW!!This is wonderful....  And I only used 2 candy bars. I bought the 3.63 oz "2toGo" MilkyWay and it was very sweet..I can't imagen the sugar rush if I had used 4.. I left everything else the same. This is in the favorites for sure!!!

It's quite dense but the taste is great.  I cut it in 1/2 (using 7 mini milky ways) and it was enough to kinda plop over my 8x11 "simple white cake" recipe from this site.  It's kinda of a gooey frosting, which I wasn't really expecting.  I suppose with a pastry bag and a large tip it would be fine on a cupcake.. but probably won't do again for a regular sheet cake.

Really sweet, as said before.  Can adjust consistency by adding milk and/or powdered sugar.  Does well to dip cupcakes in as a glaze, but gets thick fast.  Will use again.

Had been eyeing this recipe for a few days since it showed up in my email.  Definately love the flavor, I just wish it had a little thicker consistancy so it could pipe easier and hold it's swirl.  But definately a keeper.  I really think I will use it more as a center for layered cakes or pipe into center of cupcakes and use thicker icing on top.  Anxious to experiment with other candy bars to see how it tastes, like snickers, the mint 3 musketeers or even reese's.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this! Unlike other reviewers I thought that it tasted very similar to milky ways. It IS very sweet but with a yellow cake that's just fine, no one found it to be too sweet at all. Definitely let it cool before frosting anything.

This is a great recipe for someone who really has a sweet tooth. It is a little more difficult to work with than say buttercream, but worth it. Also letting it cool down to room temperature is also a must. If not when you pipe it or spread it onto your cupcakes it just thins out and falls over the sides. I learned from mistake. I will definitely use this again and can not wait to try it on the cookie dough cupcakes from this site.

This frosting tasted and looked great but it was a huge hassle to pipe onto the cupcakes. Once on the cupcakes, it cooled and became kind of hard and unappetizing to bite through. I notice that when people ate this cupcake, they were taking the frosting off because it was so thick and hard to chew. I don't think that frosting should be chewable, but this was very chewable. It could have been better! Sorry!

I don't know what I did different than other reviewers but I had to microwave it an additional 20 seconds and it was very very thick.Had to push out the chunks of caramel and mixed alot. Added the required powdered sugar and it was thick and smooth. Very sweet and tasty on a pan marble cake. Spread nicely except leave well enough alone. Went to "touch it up" and it started pulling up the cake and had to spend extra time fixing it.

This for the most part wasn't bad, but was very sweet.  I think next time I will pair it with a cake that isn't as sweet to see if it balanced better.  I used it to ice the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cupcakes that my husband took to work for a benefit bake sale. Someone paid $40 for about a dozen cupcakes and then asked for the recipe!

I made this exactly per the recipe. I would give it 4 stars for flavor, but 1 star for "workability" so two stars it is. I just made this for a two layer chocolate cake. I did so, after reading all the so-so reviews, with the intention of it just being the filling between the two layers. After spreading it on layer one, I applied the top cake layer and made sure everything was lined up. Before I could even start using my regular frosting for the outside, this Milky Way concoction started oozing out and dripping down the sides of layer one. No problem, I decided to just frost layer one with Milky Way and the top layer with regular frosting. And then all heck broke loose. Layer two started sliding off center on the "flow" of the Milky Way mess. And of course it was too sticky to allow me to adjust it back. (Though I tried, partially succeeding, though naturally the top layer got a bit nicked up.) But it just slid right off again. So I frosted the top layer with regular frosting, let it all slide and do what it wanted to do. We'll eat it, but there will be no pretty picture of this cake posted here. It's too bad. The flavor of the Milky Way frosting was great. It had cooled to room temperature and was "stiff" in the bowl. Even though it was spread on a cooled cake, though, it just went "loose" on me. I've removed this from my recipe box, with disappointment. It was great in theory anyway.

The flavor and idea was great.  The problem was the texture and workability of the icing/frosting.   It was more of a running glaze, not flakey enough.  I tried to do several things, added more confec. sugar, let it cool a bit, etc. but nothing really worked.  I ended up salvaging it on an 8x8 vanilla cake. The recipe and directions need some work.

Fantastic, rich frosting.  I doubled it to frost a cake, and if you do that you'll also need to double the microwave times.  Whisk it really well and it will be nice and creamy.  Excellent!

Hmmmmmmmm......I gave this recipe a whirl and made it. I didn't love it, yet I didn't hate it. It really doesn't have much of a taste to it. Great concept, very unique. Just not sure if I will ever make it again. BUT, glad I tried it...;-) I did have a thought regarding this recipe as I was eating another bite.....it reminded me of a pecan frosting..minus the pecans. If I was to make this again, i think by adding coconut and some pecans to it would add some flavor to this....lol...i think i might be on to something...;-)

I just made this frosting. It was way to sweet and didn't have as much Milky Way taste as I had hoped.  It did have a great chocolate taste, just very sweet.

I made it exactly as written, then used it as a filling for chocolate cupcakes. I frosted them with my own buttercream frosting. A total hit with everyone! I will be using this recipe again for cupcakes I'm making for my daughter's graduation party this weekend. Thanks for sharing House of Aqua!

Made this icing yesterday to go on top of brownie vanilla cupcakes found here on AR and they were a big hit among all ages from 30 to 60. It is really thick sticky, more of a 'topping' than an 'icing', but the taste is great! I used reg Milky Way and Caramel Milky Way together. I suggest when you are adding the icing sugar is that you sift it to ensure it is smooth and lump free! After it was made, I put it in a piping bag and put it in the fridge to cool so it would be a little thicker and easier to pipe onto the cupcakes.

a bag of fun size milky ways is perfect for icing and decor. cupcakes don't need a ton of frosting because it runs down. let cool a bit before applying. could eat frosting alone!
