These cookies taste great when made just the way the recipe is written.

But, if you're like me and your cookies always turn out flat, here's how to make these cookies turn out taller, just like the ones in the picture.  First, turn the oven temp down about 10 degrees.  Second, don't soften the butter before mixing, just cut it into 1 tbsp pieces and mix with the sugar.  Third, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the dough.  Finally, once you've filled the thumbprints with jam, put the whole cookie sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking.  The first time I followed the recipe and my cookies were so flat the jam leaked through the bottom, and the second time I made these adjustments and the cookies not only tasted delicious, they looked perfect, too!

I think I figured out why some people have trouble with this recipe.  Made one batch, followed recipe exactly.  They turned out great.  Made another, but decided to substitute vanilla for the almond extract.  BIG MISTAKE! They turned out flat as a pancake, so I'm attributing the cause to the switch in the extracts because I made a third batch, like the first (with the almond extract) and they were perfect.  Also followed another reviewer's advice and used a chapstick end to make the hole. These are delicious and attractive IF you follow the recipe exactly.

Have been making these for Christmas since they first appeared in a Pillsbury Classic cookbook many years ago.  They are a tender, buttery, melt-in-your mouth cookie that also look pretty on the plate.  They do spread a bit, so I always chill the dough first and roll the dough into balls a little smaller than the recipe suggests. This is simply a perfect Christmas cookie.

I've made these cookies a half-dozen times now. They've been DELICIOUS every single time, but here's a few words of advice: First, do not leave out the almond extract or sub it with vanilla. The almond adds a great flavor and its very distinct. Second, pull the cookies out of the oven midway through cooking, take a spoon and lightly spread the jam outwards and even it out into a circle. This way, the cookies will look much prettier when done. The first time I made them, the jam had bubbled all over the cookie and wasn't evenly spread. The flavor was the same of course but the jam likes to go its own direction and I like them to look pretty. Great recipe!

ETA: I have found that once the cookies are ready to be put in the oven, if you put them in the fridge for ~15 minutes, it will eliminate the need to "fix" the jam half-way through baking. Also, because shortbread is naturally so white, it is easy to burn these without realizing that the bottoms are browning. So, carefully watch the edges and when they turn light brown, they are done (even if they don't look like it!) Also, use the back of a teaspoon to make perfect little holes to fill.

These are so fabulously simple and great.  Although... it did take 3 tries in the oven before I figured out how to eliminate the jam from spreading all over my cookie sheets and creating a mess!  (even the messy looking cookies tasted great though)  I should have listened to other reviews... In the end... I made the cookies like small little buttons - about the size of a quarter, rolled them into a ball, like another reviewer and then made a nice indent for the jam.  You don't need a lot of jam... when you use too much, the jam will destroy your cookie sheets... suggestion for novice bakers like me... use parchment paper the first few rounds so you don't have to deal with the mess in the event you don't use the right amount of jam or push the indent enough to hold the jam... Anyhow, I baked the really small cookies for only 12 1/2 minutes and they turned out fabulously.  Each oven is different though... that much I've learned... so I started to look for golden brown edges and then pulled the cookies out .... makes for a tasty shortbread cookie!  even my husband, who is a die-hard chocolate chip cookie lover and told me "i don't like sugar/shortbread type cookies"... well... he has managed to eat close to a dozen of the little button cookies in the past few hours!

Wow - a simple cooke with a absolutely decadent flavor! I mean these are really, really good. the key to these is chilling the dough, rolling them small and taking the genious advice of using a chapstick cap to make the indentions. Whoever thought of that little trick deserves a medal! These cookies definitely melt in your mouth. I used glaze featured with the recipe, but you can definitely change this up with melted white and dark chocolate - YUM!

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any butter on hand and used margarine (Can't Believe It's Not Butter).  Although I typically never bake with margarine - I was surprised at how well it worked for this recipe.  Although the recipe works as stated - I've found a way to "improve" it a bit.  

By adding 2 egg yolks and 2 extra tablespoons of flour - it creates a tastier cake-like cookie.  The trick is to beat the butter by itself until the butter is very pale - then add the sugar and beat again until very very pale.  Add the eggs and flavoring - then add the flour.

I don't use extract because I don't use any alcohol - I have found an almond emulsion for bakers (alcohol free and much better than extracts) and these cookies are PHENOMENAL with the almond flavoring.  Vanilla works well too - but the almond is the best!  

Of all the cookies I bake these are the most requested cookies.  

I use a cookie scoop to have even sized cookies - shape them into round balls and only use my thumb to make the indentation.  Fill a plastic ziplock bag with the preserves and snip the corner of the bag - and pipe the preserves into the center of the cookie (less fuss and mess)... if you have any extra preserves you can just squeeze it back into the jar.  Be sure to use parchment paper, rotate half way through baking, and remove from oven when the bottoms begin to brown (the tops of the cookie shouldn't brown).

These cookies are not only impressive, they are mouth watering delicious!  I made the "thumb print" indentation with a wine bottle cork, and filled the centers with a seedless raspberry preserve that I heated on the stove for an easier consistency.  I alternated the drizzle every other cookie with a semi-sweet chocolate and the almond glaze, using a zip lock baggie to pipe the glaze.  This has got to be the most simple, yet impressive cookie I have ever made!

The best and easiest holiday cookie out there. I have been making this for a few years now. I make equal batches of Strawberry and Raspberry.  These cookies spread. After you roll your cookies and put your jam in put them back in the fridge for about 20 min. makes a huge difference.

These didn't turn out exactly how I was expecting, however, the taste made up for the appearance.  Make sure to space the cookies far enough apart on the cookie sheet so they don't end up molded together.  AND...make your thumb print indentions deep enough so the raspberry jam doesn't run out.  Mind did just that and made a mess on my cookie sheet.  I suggest using your little finger instead of your thumb...so the indentions look a little more delicate.  I sprinkled poppy seeds in my dough before baking to give the cookies a little "something".  I had to use a little more than 1 tsp of milk to make a glaze.  I poured my glaze into a ziploc bag, cut off a corner and drizzled the glaze on the cookies.  Again, despite the runny jam, these did taste really good and I do recommened them:) Thanks for sharing Dee.  P.S.  The second batch I made, I used the top of a chap-stick container to make my indentions...they turned out great!!

Wonderfully easy and yummy!  Made these for a cookie exchange and found that even when made with the same exact ingredients the temperature of these ingredients can effect the expansion of the cookies...the cooler the dough before you put it in the oven, the less I found these to expand.

OMG!  I have never been able to get these cookies to work...these did!  Based on reviews I changed a few things.  1.  Rolled the dough into small, teaspooned sized balls.  2.  Used the lid of a chapstick container to make the indentation for the jam.  3. Placed jam in a baggie and snipped end so I could squeeze into hole without getting it all over. (Worked perfectly!) 3.  Placed in fridge for 15 minutes.  4.  Baked for 10 minutes and then added just a tad more jam to the cookies cuz a lot melts (I like a lot).  5.  Placed back in oven to finish cooking.  6.  Used the baggie method again to drizzle on the icing.  I can't wait til the next time to make these cookies!  Yummy!!

This is a great recipe, though I made a small change in the interest of saving time: I plopped the dough balls on the cookie sheets, made the "thumbprints" using a wine cork (worked wonderfully), and put the cookies WITHOUT JAM into the oven for 10-12 mins. I took them out just before the bottom edges started to get brown (note: the "thumbprints" inflated a bit, so they were pretty shallow by the time they came out of the oven). As soon as the cookies were out of the oven, I filled the indentations with raspberry jam.  The cookies came out beautifully and were even tastier the next day, after the cookie and jam had settled together. In my opinion, no need to bake the cookies WITH the jam--this way, you can avoid the need to refrigerate the cookies beforehand, and there's no worry of a jam mess in the oven.

Why in the world should you bother to find a chapstick container and clean off the lid when you can just use the lid to the almond extract? That's what I did, and it worked perfectly!

I added 1/4 cup of flour and lowered the oven temperature to 325F.  I scooped the dough with my smallest cookie scoop and rolled them in my palms and flattened them slightly.  I held the ball in a cupped palm and gently pressed the handle end of a large wooden spoon into the dough to create a round imprint.  This method kept the dough from cracking.  The balls were slightly bowl shaped on the bottoms when I placed them on the cookie sheet but they cooked down...without any cracks.  I used a baby spoon to fill the indentation holes with blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry jellies.  I put the first batch in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking and I alternated pans in the freezer and oven during cooking times.  I baked them for 20 minutes.  They need to brown SLIGHTLY, otherwise the dough will be raw under the jelly.  After baking, I chipped off the crispy crumbles that formed around the cookies.  I used 2 1/2 teaspoons milk in the icing to thin it to a drizzle consistancy.  DO NOT ice these until they are completely cool or your icing will melt and won't look drizzled. Although, next time I'll probably skip the icing because it makes the cookies way too sweet.  I'll also probably decrease the amount of almond extract in the cookies and omit it from the icing alltogether.  Makes 30 beautiful and delicious cookies.

I was very dissapointed in these cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with flat cookies!  They looked more like saucers than cookies, the jelly spread everywhere.  I will try these again sometime but will look through reviews on how to make them like the picture.

I love these cookies.  I chilled them overnight and baked them today.  I found that putting the jam in a ziploc bag to pipe helped keep from making a mess and made the jam easier to handle--squishing it  in the bag warms it up.  I think they look adorable and they taste delicious!  *Update*:  I made these once with the hand mixer.  I won't ever do that again!  It makes the butter melt and they don't turn out.  Use a pastry cutter like I usually do and they will turn out very well.

Very easy cookie to make and the results are delicious.
The dough was extremely easy to work with, no chilling necessary. I added the flour in 4 parts and mixed everything till just blended with a plain fork. The first time, I made them big...I used a tablespoon to measure out the dough and pressed out shallow centers down with my fingers till it made 1.75" size cookies. The next time, I used a teaspoon and pressed out a deeper center and ended up with 1" cookies. The smaller ones looked cuter, but they both tasted good. I didn't see any seedless preserves at my local Trader Joe's, so i just used seeded raspberry preserves. I used a non-insulated dark baking sheet and I had no problems with spreading. I did not make any of the icing. The cookies were crisp at first, but after sitting out for about an hour, the texture was softer. (I uploaded photos of the finished cookie).

Thanks for the fabulous recipe, Dee!  Easy and delicious!  Thanks also to the various reviewers who suggested using a chapstick cap to make the indentations.  I coated my hands with powdered sugar to roll the balls (about an inch in size) and then dipped the chapstick cap in powdered sugar as well -- worked perfectly.  You need to be sure and leave enough dough under the indentation so that the jam doesn't seep through it while baking.  For fun, I tried all the jams in our fridge -- strawberry, apple, blackberry and raspberry.  Because the cookie isn't highly flavorful on its own, you need to use a strongly flavored jam.  Raspberry was perfect.  I made these for my husband and didn't expect to like them myself since I don't care for raspberry.  But I just LOVED the raspberry in this recipe!  The other jams I tried just didn't have the same "oomph," so I'd definitely recommend sticking with raspberry or a similarly strongly flavored jam.

I wish people would take into account the reviews before reviewing. If the majority of people give something 5 stars don't one star because baking isn't your forte. These are delicious. I added the extra 1/4C of flour, used raspberry, apricot and strawberry jam, rolled some in crushed almonds and put them in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking..they came out picture perfect!

They came out excellent! I was able to halve the recipe without a problem. I also did the following: 1) Added two extra tablespoons of flour 2) Added 1/4 teaspoon BAKING POWDER! (this helps them from spreading out and becoming super flat) 3) Took the cookies out midway through baking and added more raspberry filling so it wouldn't crust up and get chewy. I followed other reviews and used parchment paper as well. Irresistible cookies!

These turned out great! I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and used the chapstick cap for the indentations (seriously, I have little hands and my thumb would have made too large of spaces) and chilled the cookies in the fridge about 10 minutes before I threw them in the oven. Also, I had to add another teaspoon of milk as one teaspoon just made a glaze the consistency of a thick glue that wouldn't drizzle. Other than that followed the recipe and they turned out perfect!

Delicious! Sometimes I make these by forming a 1/2" log ... flatten it out a little and use your finger to make indentations across about every inch or so. Then fill those indentations with the jam. When the come out, give them a few minutes, then when they're still warm cut them into slices. It's actually easier that way instead of rolling a whole bunch of balls.

This recipe was excellent.  I made it last Mothers Day.  I used cookie cutters to shape them like flowers.  I baked other cookies as well shaped as cookies, stuck them on skewers, and made a cookie bouquet!  I wrapped the raspberry & almond shortbread thumbprints in colorful saran wrap and tied them with ribbon's (since they couldn't stand on the skewer's).  My mom absolutely loved it!

Very good!!!  I filled a Ziploc baggie with jam & cut a hole at one of the corners & piped the jam in (No Mess!!), chilled the cookies (with the jam inside) for about 10 min before baking...and used a cookie scoop to make the cookies...only giving me 27 cookies. Also, my first batch, I waited about 5-10 min before glazing the cookies & it melted/didn't look so pretty.  The second batch, I waited almost an hour before glazing them, and they looked much nicer. Very yummy!!! (A 5-Star with these changes!!)

I made these for my cookie exchange this Christmas, and everyone raved about them!  They are so easy and taste "fancy," but to make them even more special, I added an almond slice to the top after baking (centered over the jam) and then drizzled the glaze over the whole thing.  I also tinted some of the glaze green to make it more Christmas-y, but I think I prefer the white glaze!  This simple cookies also freeze well if you wait until the glaze is "set" and then separate layers with waxed paper.

the 1st batch I made I took another reviewer advice of adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour forget that!  Took me so long to get the cookies to roll into a ball. The second batch I followed the recipe as stated turned out great.  I did put the cookies in the freezer before baking though.

These turned out beautifully. I halved the recipe and made 12 cookies. I rolled them into balls and used the end of a wooden spoon to make a deep hole. Then I expanded the hole with my thumb. I baked the cookies empty for 10 minutes then another 5 minutes after I put the jam in. Also I used a pestle to press the indent in again before I filled the cookies. It worked perfectly.

Have made these cookies several times, and they are without a doubt my favorite. The only tip I can give is not to make the glaze to runny as it tends to puddle in the middle. Thicker glaze stays put and makes for a pretty cookie. I use 2-3 tsp. water instead of milk.

These were out of this world! I brought them into work for a birthday gathering and everyone couldn't stop raving about them.  I didn't soften the butter - just cut it up and creamed it with the sugar cold. I used the other reviewer’s advice of making them smaller and using a chap stick cap for the hole. This worked out perfectly. Like other reviewers I also put the dough into the fridge for 15 minutes before cooking to help maintain the shape. They came out beautifully after just 12 minutes. For the glaze portion I found that my milk expired so used heavy whipping cream instead. I also found I had to use a little more then 1 teaspoon and wait about 5-10 minutes after the cookies came out of the oven to drizzle it on. On my first batch I waited just a minute or two and the glaze just melted into the cookie. I desired the stripes of glaze as in the picture.

5 star recipe all the way, I find it works better if I do not soften the butter. Different flavor of jam work well too (blackberry is a favorite!) and I generally leave off the icing they are yummy without it.

I LOVE these cookies and have been making them for years at Christmas.  I have a convection oven and cook three trays at once and they always turn out perfectly.  I use insulated cookie sheets and adjust my oven according to the manufacturer's directions (for mine, I turn the oven down 25 degrees).  Also, I drizzle the top of my cookies with melted white chocolate instead of the confectioner's sugar glaze.  Pure heaven!

These are delicious!   The shortbread part is exactly how shortbread should taste.  I did find that they cooked in 10-12 mins instead of 14-18.  I was scared the almond would be too much, so I didn't quite fill up the measuring spoons when measuring it.  Turned out perfect for me!  Make sure to fill the holes all the way up to the top with the jam for a prettier cookie. NOTE:  For me, these cookies do NOT turn out when it's raining.  I've made them a dozen times and when it is raining or humid out, the cookies turn brown at the edges and run.  If it is dry and sunny, they turn out PERFECT.

I love these cookies.  The bottoms were perfectly browned and slightly crisp but also a little chewy.  Perfect!  Now, I have to say one thing about a previous reviewer making suggestions on how to keep the shape of the cookies; I dunno what she's talking about!  Yikes, she put a lot of work into making hers higher by not softening the butter and adding flour and refrigerating before baking.  Take my advice and don't waste your time.  I was a little concerned that the dough wouldn't hold it's shape but if you look at the pic I took you'll see my concerns were unfounded.  I mixed the softened margarine by hand and omitted the glaze. To make them look more uniform I used a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon, dipped the back in flour (to avoid sticking), and used that to make the "thumbprint."  Mine aren't raspberry because I wanted to use some lemon curd I had and I also replaced the almond extract with lemon.  Yum!  This cookie is a real winner and a breeze to make.

I have to say that I just made these 4 hours ago, and they are all gone!  Obviously a huge hit.  I got scared about adding to much jam by all the reviews that said it bubbled over, but I just put them in the fridge for a couple minutes like everyone else said, and they didn't run over at all, I could have added more.

These cookies were an absolute hit! After following the recipe to the last detail, my first round turned out exactly as MarcieJ said they would... completely flat, and nothing like the picture. So as soon as I took them out of the oven, I started making some of the changes that MarcieJ suggested, to save the rest of the batch. I lowered the oven temp, added flour to the dough, and after shaping the cookies and adding the jam, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes. The second round were picture perfect. Don't bother sticking to the recipe on this one, or you'll be disappointed with the outcome. Make the changes, and your eyes and stomach will both be very happy.

Since I didn't have rasberry jam, I used strawberry, and omitted the sugar glaze and instead rolled the uncooked cookies in coconut. Unfortunately, something went wrong and while cooking, the cookies expanded to huge, flat, red blobs. I didn't make them very big, so I don't know what happened. Be very careful when rolling the balls, (make them SMALL) and only add a BIT of jam, I think I added to much. I may try again, but am discouraged by the fickleness of these cookies.

Very good cookies, and easy to make too! Make sure the dough is cold before putting in the oven, or they will flatten out too much. I used a seedless raspberry jam and the cookies turned out perfectly.  The only thing I had to do different was use WAY more milk for the glaze. One teaspoon is not even close to being enough. I ended up having to use at least 5 tsp. I'd also wait at least 5 mins before drizzling the cookies. Otherwise the cookies are too hot and the glaze ends up melting and pooling in the middle of the cookie.

These cookies are delicious and so easy to make! I didn't have any problems with them being flat or the jam spilling over. I placed the dough in the refrigerator for about one hour. Then I rolled the dough into 1" balls. I used a food scale, and each ball was 0.65 oz. I used the end of a chapstick to make the indent; the indent was pretty deep since I wanted a lot of jam. I piped the jam into the indent by putting the jam in a ziploc bag and snipping off a corner. I was generous with the amount of jam; I made sure each indent was filled to the top. After rolling and filling, I placed the whole cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper) in the freezer for about 8 minutes. Then I baked the cookies for about 14-15 minutes (until edges are lightly brown) and let the cookies rest on the sheet for about 2 minutes. They turned out perfect! I tried them with the glaze and prefer them without the glaze. Also, I used unsoftened salted butter (I made sure to whip the butter and sugar until fluffy).

These were great. I did not add the almond extract or the glaze and followed a suggestion to use cold butter. It was a bit harder to mix at first but they did not go flat and jam stayed in the middle. And I made them with two toddlers helping me to shape the little balls and they turned out great. Keeper!

These are truly delicious! I followed the recipe to a T and they came out wonderful. I have a tip for all who want to try these. I used my pinky finger to put the hole in the center of the cookie. I also used a ziploc bag to put the jam in and I cut a tiny bit off the corner for a hole. It made it very easy to put the jam in the hole without making a mess. Do not fill the hole all the way of else you will have a mess as the cookies bake. Very easy to make and delicious!

Great recipe, so easy and so tasty, no modifications needed (although I did use margarine instead of butter).  I made 300 "bite size" cookies for a bake sale by making 3 batches and scooping the dough with a very small melon baller: rolled the dough into balls and used the flat end of a chopstick to tap down the center about 8 times.  I put the jam in a ziplock, snipped a tiny hole in the corner, and filling the cookies was a breeze.  I removed the cookies from the oven just as the bottoms were starting to turn golden. After the cookies cooled, I drizzled white chocolate on half of my product and semi-sweet chocolate on the others - I prefer the semi-sweet chocolate.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

I found a little trick-if you use a teaspoon (a metal one seems to be the best) to make the indent it works perfect and don't fill the hole up completely.  These are the best cookies!!  I am not one to eat my own baking but these I cannot keep my hands off of.

Based on the reviews, I added 1/4" flour and also put the cookies in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking so they wouldn't get flat.  Great tips. 

I thought the glaze made the cookies a little too sweet.  Next time I make a batch, I'll omit the glaze.

These were A LOT of work, and I was not impressed with the end result.  Maybe I'm just not used to shortbreads, but I found this way too greasy.  The dough was also difficult to work with.  Sorry, but I would not make this again.

Wonderful!!!
I registered just so I can write a review... I loved this recipe. I am the world worst baker, But this was easy and yummy! Supper buttery. I used vanilla extract because that’s all I had & also used raspberry spread but it came out great and it looked just like the pictures. I noticed that if I use my thumb the cookie dough cracked so I used a fork with a round handle and it was perfect. 
Ok... so a few people wrote that the recipe didn't work for them and that the cookies didn't retain their shape. 
I made a second batch a day after I wrote this review and found that if you wait too long to cook the cookies the butter starts to melt and the batter gets a bit gooey, so it didn't seem like the cookies would retain the shape so I used a mini muffin pan. IT CAME OUT GREAT.

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is great!  Just a few ideas to help in your cookie experience.  Yes they spread as stated in other reviews.  You will only need to make small balls the size of a quarter or less!  I use a small cookie scoop to make my balls.  The dough freezes well so if you are making many, roll them in balls and freeze them in a rigid container which is well sealed.
To bake place balls on a cookie sheet, thaw slightly and push a small indentation in the cookies. (I use childs medicine spoon, anything small and round) My favorite Rapsberry fill is "SOLO".  Using a cake decorating bag to squeeze the fill in the holes is quick and easy.  I do not use the glaze, the cookies are great w/o.

This cookie turned out great! I found the dough a bit too crumbly at first so I added milk a tablespoon at a time, as needed. If the dough gets too sticky, put it in the fridge and allow it to chill for a little while. It will be easier to work with

First let me say that I've never cared for these types of similar looking cookies like the ones you see in the store.(always hard, never enough jam) but thought the hubby might like them so I made these for him last night and WOW!!! LIFE CHANGING!! Not only were they a huge hit with him, but this is by far, the best I've tasted....seriously, the flavors are awesome! Followed the recipe exactly except I chilled the dough 30 mins before rolling, and used apricot and seedless blackberry jams. I also made 2 cookies with plum jelly just as a test, and that was really good too!  It made 36 beautiful, perfect looking cookies!! I had a lot of fun making these as he distracted me many times in excitement, :) ... My favorite thing about it is that i got to add the amount of preserves i want. ...My only regret? Is that i didnt take another reviewer's advice and make a second batch. To all those who said they only make these at holiday times once a year: I honestly don't know how you do it, but hats off, ladies-I'm not that strong. LOL  I will be making another batch tomorrow cuz they're going fast...so irresistible...

OMG...What a great cookie! I am only sorry I didn't make more.  These were sooooo good.  Make sure you use Almond Extract.  I like other's used other types of jams.  I used Apricot, Orange, Strawberry and Raspberry.  Raspberry was my favorite.  These were sooo good! OMG, and I thought they were going to be horrible since some people here said that the jam went all over.  Nope for me it was perfect.  I used the back of a teaspoon to make the thumbprint and I added the jam and baked.  They smelled so good too! I will certainly be making these again for any occasion.   I got RAVE reviews.  In time they get soft and just even better.  This is the perfect tea time cookie!!!

Great cookies!  Very easy to make!  However, one thing I didn't care too much for was the STRONG almond flavor.  It made them almost too sweet for me.  I'd like to figure out how to change that. Also, I did follow the advice of others and refrigerated them for about 15 minutes before baking and they held up very nicely.  I also used the advice of another review and used the end of a tube of chapstick to make the indentions for the filling.  They turned out picture perfect!

Made these last night. The only changes to the recipe I made was that I added a little extra almond extract (used pure not imitation), and I also didn't mix the butter and sugar first. I added everything to my bowl all at once. They tasted absolutely wonderful, but were very very flat. Next time I'll be following the recipe with more precision.

I don't understand the folk who substituted vanilla for the almond extract, "almond" is in the title and it's a crucial ingredient.  These cookies rock!  We  rolled them about an inch and only yielded 32 cookies.  I don't see how we could have gotten 36 at the size suggested (1 1/2").  The next time I make these I will wait for the cookies to cool completely before drizzling because it puddled to the middle of the cookie and didn't really look appealing.  (I say that because I gave them as a gift.)  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's now our 2nd favorite cookie.

I absolutely love, love, love this recipe! It is so easy and versatile. I make these with so many different flavors of preserves and jellies. So far Ive done, raspberry, peach, mango, strawberry and orange marmalade. I think raspberry is my favorite, but I love them all! I use cold butter instead of softened, and I use either the top of a chapstick or the back of a 1/4 tsp to make the indent.  Everyone loves when I make these, they taste like more work than they really are!

These were fabulous!  I actually tried 4 different flavors of jam just to see what's liked best--strawberry, blackberry, apricot and raspberry.  They are all a hit!  My glaze was a bit too runny I think because it mostly just pooled in the jam or ran off the sides but the almond flavor really adds.  I made with my 3 year old and they were much more fun than regular cookies.

When I made these cookies, I happen to of made a batch and a half of the cookie dough, but after baking, the dough spread, and the jam ran.  I had to throw out 2 pans of the cookies.  I then added a 2/3's cup of flour to the remaining dough, using my hands to work the flour into the remaining cookie dough.  The cookies then baked purfectly. If I were to rate this recipe, using the amount of ingredients as written, I would only give this recipe 1 STAR, but since I was able to make this recipe work, by adding more flour, I will give this rate this recipe with 5 STARS.  The end results... this is a good tasting cookie, but my husband would of much preferred these cookies without the icing, but as for me, I liked them with the icing.  One more thing I wanted to mention here, when it came to adding preserves to the cookie dough, I had used both apricot preserves and seedless raspberry jam.  Both tasted great, but I thought the raspberry jam gave these cookies a lot more flavor, and when it came to baking the cookies, I baked them on my Pampered Chef Baking Stoneware for 16 minutes. Dee, thank you for the recipe!

Total failure. These things are falling apart as soon as they are touched (even though more flour was added to make the sticky dough able to be handled). I used butter-flavor Crisco, and it should work just as well as butter, for which it was designed to be a substitute.

Very delicious and pretty cookies!!  I followed everyone's advice and added 1/4 cup extra flour and an egg.  I put the dough in the fridge before forming the cookies and then again refridgerated the whole cookie sheet before putting it in the oven.  I put less almond extract but added a dash of lemon juice.  The cookies turned out soft, tall, and delicious with no jam leaking out at all.
UPDATE: I made these cookies again but this time filled with lemon curd...amazing!

I have but one word for these cookies....AMAZING!!!  I couldn't believe how delicious they turned out.  I rolled some of the balls into crushed almonds before using the cap of my mascara (I made sure it was clean) to make thumbprints.  They looked great!  To top them off, I sprinked some crushed almonds on the raspberry center. I will definitely make these again!

Excellent!  I rolled the balls in Sugar in the Raw before baking and used strawberry jam, it's all I had.  Also, I put the glaze in a baggie and cut a small hole at the end for better control. Thanks so much for

12/2006 Update - Suggest making them in 1 inch balls....very good/sweet but bitesize is best!
*************************
BEST cookie at the Cookie Exchange! My official "taste-tester" (13 year old neighbor's son) told his Mom "Be sure and get ALOT of those raspberry cookies for me at the party!" I kept them small (maybe 1-1/2 inch balls) used a small indent, and squeezed the jam from corner of 'baggie'. Used the baggie for drizzling too (best invention!) They turned out size of 50cent piece and were 2-bite wonders! Try them.

These were really awesome and so easy to make...the only problem was that the confectioner sugar drizzle was too thick and I added more milk, not much I thought, but it came out too thin.  I will definately make these again and work on the "drizzle" part.

This was a great cookie.  I used lemon extract instead of the almond extract and lemon curd for the filling.  My family loves this cookie! Be sure to set your timer and don't overbake. Mine were slightly brown on the bottom only. Land o lakes margarine worked great.  No crumbly mixture as noted in previous reviews.

I made these for the first time years ago and they are absolutely delicious!! I'm going to make them again this week for Christmas. I would just like to say to the reviewers who alter the recipe and them give it a negative review because the cookies didn't turn out like they were supposed to. Of course it's not going to turn out right because you've created a new recipe by doing so. It's not fair to give a recipe a negative review when you've experimented by adding things such as coconut flakes or replacing almond extract with vanilla.

I usually read a lot of reviews before I make anything, then I take advantage of many of the tricks/tips the other cooks have offered. First of all, this recipe was terrific just as written !!
 The first tip I used was to use a melon baller (1.5") to get perfect, uniform sized cookies. I then hand rolled them to shape.
The next was the chapstick lid to make the little holes, I had an old chapstick, but it was pretty grungy, but I had been to the dentist the day before, and voila (!!) the sample toothpaste cap was the same size, so used that.
The third was piping the jam in, I put it in a baggie, and used one of my small pastry tips shoved through a corner (I hate cleaning my pastry bag, LOL.) Easy clean up, and you can squeeze any leftovers back in the jar. The warmth of your hand is enough to loosen even cold preserves.
The fourth tip was the chilling of the dough before piping in the raspberry, but after scooping, rolling and indenting. 15 minutes was recommended, I went with 10.
The fifth was to lower the oven temp just a hair, to about 230. It  took the full 18 minutes.
Using all those tips resulted in a superior cookie. My tip? fill the indents with just a tad more raspberry than you think you should. It doesn't run or bubble and they look great ! Thanks for the great recipe !

The cookie dough recipe is exactly like LandoLakes recipe.  Their glaze uses water instead of milk.  'Think milk's better.  Also, their recipe is twice the glaze & it really only requires the amount on this recipe.  I refrigerated my dough overnight.  (That may be why more flour is required if you don't refrigerate). 'Used the joint (between knuckle & fingertip) to make the indentation.  It's more consistent.  Be sure to not push in too much or the bottom will be too thin when baked.  It's okay to mound it a little, too, since it deepens while baking.  Mine, 1" balls, were done in 17 minutes on a regular, non airbake, sheet.  Both kids liked 'em.  'Used strawberry jam 1/8t - 1/4t per.  Let the cookies cool before glazing - unless you like messes - well, more of a mess with warm cookies.  Just place them on wax paper & transfer to serving or storage dish once it's dried.  (BTW, Kroger butter won't work for this, but GV will, &, of course, LoL.) Gotta try lipstick trick & Autumn Leaves' comment of making a log, then slicing it.  Big time saver!   Three dozen balls of firm dough is rough on the hands!  :)  AND: Someone please address the almond extract in the glaze.  It has to be 1/4t right?  That's about what I did.  I can't imagine that much extract for so little glaze.

I grew up baking these every Christmas with my Mom.  Instead of a thumb or other item, I make the indentation by pressing the bottom of a small measuring spoon into it.  Makes a deep enough well that the jam doesn't run out and its a perfect circle.  

We sprinkled w/sifted confectioner's sugar once they cooled. Problem with that is the conf sugar always "disappears" with any moisture in the air, so I'm looking forward to trying the glaze.

Delish! only thing I would change is that the ball size should be closer to 1" and I had to make an extra 1/2 batch of the drizzle.

One of my favorite cookies EVER. I loooove them. I like to use rum extract instead of almond and strawberry jam instead of raspberry. Its like a daiquiri cookie!

I made these last Christmas (2010) with leftover jam in the fridge (I had both blackberry and sugar-free blueberry). I did not put the extra icing on top, because they are plenty sweet without and, despite the holidays, I do try to cut back where I can. Word of caution--- do not chill the dough. I made four batches of cookie dough ahead of time and then had a marathon baking day. These do not roll out well when chilled. They really need to be soft.

These are delicious.  My kids don't like Nana's thumbprints, but love these (I had to hide them).  The touch of icing on top is a must.

I would rate these a 5 on taste alone, but took away a star because there has got to be a way to make the dough easier to deal with.  I had several flat, runny batches (that still tasted incredible) I finally found that if I chilled the dough overnight, then tightly formed the cookie over the top of and around my fingertip, the cookies kept their shape fairly well.  I would highly recommend trying these simply because they are delicious but understand that they might not turn out beautiful :)

outstanding!!  My glaze was a little tricky as far as getting the consistency right....I added more milk than what was called for....and it was still hard to drizzle evenly and make them look as pretty as in this picture.  Still, these cookies were a hit.  (Oh....and I used a high quality raspberry jam that did have seeds...and I thought it was great!)

I have been making these cookies around Christmas for years.  I definitely suggest putting the uncooked, ready cookie sheets in the fridge for about 15 minutes before going in the oven.  This way the cookies won't spread out as much.

I can't say these really turned out for me. Even when I froze the prepared cookie sheets for 15 minutes, they still turned out pretty flat. They tasted pretty good. Too bad I can't put them on the cookie tray because of how they look... at least it's an easy recipe!

These are so delicious.  They are so pretty.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the glaze.  I needed to add a little more milk to make it drizzling consistency.  I also used the chapstick lid to make the indentations!  Will make every year from now on!

These were a huge hit for Thanksgiving! The ones that went the quickest, however, were the ones that I placed Reese's miniatures, Rolos, and Kisses on after they were cooked. I recommend these to anyone.

Very good. I doubled the almond extract in the dough and in the glaze; we're almond fanatics. As some suggested, I used a chapstick tube for the indent and it worked wonderful. I made the indents half as deep as the lid.

Awesome recipe. I highly recommend using almond extract and raspberry jam. Something about this combination is just heavenly. Instead of drizzling with frosting, I cover the cookie part (not the jelly center) with powder sugar. It is always a crowd pleaser!

This shortbread base is delicious.  I cannot rate the whole recipe, because I was actually just looking for a good shortbread cookie recipe for my holiday cookies.  I usually buy the Ghirradelli shortbread cookies with chocolate in the middle, (they are my husbands favorite) but couldnt find them this year! So, I followed this shortbread cookie recipe exactly as the recipe states, but instead of jam, I put a hersheys kiss in the middle. This was the third shortbread recipe I tried, and the others turned out horrible...this one was absolutely perfect and delicious! No need to ever buy boxed again...This will be my new recipe for holiday shortbread cookies! Thanks!!

I used my cookie scoop, and formed the ball from that so the dough didn't get too soft. I also used the back of a round 1/2 teaspoon to make the indent in the cookie. I used black raspberry fruit spread, (not as sweet) and after tasting them I decided it didn't need the glaze. I'll make these often!

This was great!!  added a few extra TB of flour, baked at 340 for 13-14 minutes. Froze each batch for about 10 minutes before baking to help retain shape.  Used a sterilized chapstick top to make 'thumbprints.'  Used strawberry jam.  Did not use sugar/milk drizzle.

First, I took the suggestion of turning the oven down to 325 degrees; they were done at 30 minutes. I softened the butter and started to use a mixer for the butter & sugar, but ended up using a PASTRY CUTTER 'til the end (this is what creates the PERFECT CRUMBLEY COOKIE texture). You DON'T NEED to add 1/4 more flour if you use the pastry cutter & freezer/fridgerate the dough. DO NOT CUT DOWN ON THE ALMOND EXTRACT. It might seem strong in the batter, but the flavor dies down when you cook it. Push all the crumbles together with your hands or the back of a spoon to get a ball of dough. I first made the dough before dinner, then put it in the FRIDGE, so I could cook dinner & eat, then came back & started to roll the dough into little balls. I used the BACK OF A COOKING SPOON, & this created a perfect little hole, but I found it too small. NEXT TIME, I'm just going to use my thumb, so there is an equal ratio of jam & cookie. Also, put the jam in PLASTIC BAG & smash the jam if there are any chunks of fruit, then cut the end of the bag & squeeze into each hole. I would suggest filling the hole ALL THE WAY, because the jam deflates when they cook. Turn on oven to preheat (325 degrees) & NOW PUT YOUR UNBAKED COOKIES IN THE FREEZER FOR 10 MINUTES. I covered the cookie sheet w/ parchment paper just in case of any spills, but there were no messes.  I DID NOT USE THE SUGAR TOPPING & BELIEVE, THEY DID NOT NEED IT. Perfection!

Goodness, these cookies are amazing! A pretty simple recipe that yields the most delicious cookies. I followed the advice of other reviewers-- I checked the cookies midway through the baking time to even out the jam to make sure it wasn't overflowing everywhere. I found not much need to fix anything. Just don't put too much jam in the cookies. Then it should be fine. Also, do not even think about substituting the almond extract with vanilla. The almond is key in making these cookies smell and taste wonderful!!! As for the icing, I would add a little extra milk to make it less thick for easier drizzling. However, I'd like to add that after drizzling 3 cookies with icing, my bf who has a big sweet tooth said he liked them more without the icing. It's too sweet with it and scrumptious enough without it. I'm definitely making these cookies again.

These are delicious.  I only made two changes to the flavor of the cookie -- 1/4 tsp salt after tasting the dough, and rather than use a sticky confectioners sugar glaze, I made a glaze out of white chocolate with a bit of almond extract added and drizzled with that.  I only changed the glaze because these cookies are on their way to a cookie exchange tomorrow and I was afraid the other glaze wouldn't set up.  I did make two other functional changes to the recipe, after the first batch flattened too much in the oven.  I reduced the temp to 325, and I refrigerated the cookies for fifteen minutes after I formed them and put in the jam.  Then they didn't spread and were gorgeous.
Excellent cookie and so beautiful!

Just delicous... I put a bit more of flour and refregirated them for half an hour before baking them (as seggested) and they didn't leak at all. Very quick and easy to make... no doubt I'll make them again.

I tried this recipe because it had received so many glowing reviews.  I doubled the batch, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  When I saw the consistency of the mixed dough, I tried one batch as instructed in the recipe.  The resulting cookie spread out too much, and the texture was greasy.  For the rest of the dough, I pressed them into mini muffin cups, added the jam, and froze them for 10 minutes before baking. The result was much better.  I was left thinking that this recipe should have had more flour.  What did I do wrong?  200 of you can't be wrong!

So good.  Followed suggestions and chilled cookies just before baking.  Made them small, about 1" and they came out perfect.  Also used a chapstick (wrapped in plastic wrap) to make my "dimples".  Worked perfect.  Watch the time carefully.  I baked mine only about 13 minutes tops.  Cool just a bit before drizzling on glaze.  Beautiful cookie!  Thanks

This is a delicious buttery tasting cookie with a slight hint of the almond.  I think I would increase the Almond extract by a 1/4 Tsp the next time I make them.  I omitted the glaze, the cookies are great as they are without the glaze, although the glaze might make them a little more attractive.  Freezing the cookies for 10 minutes before baking prevented them from spreading and I did use the chapstick hint provided by others which worked really well.  A really great cookie recipe.

yummy yummy cookies.  I tested a couple cookies before making a full batch to avoid problems that other reviewers had.  I used a good quality organic almond extract so the flavor is pure and not overpowering.  I softened the butter (unsalted)just a little and cut it up in small pieces for creaming.  I didn't need to add any liquid to the dough and I found working with it easy w/out chilling first.  I used a generous heaping 1 tsp full of dough and like others used a chapstick cap fot the indentation.  I tried putting them in the fridge at this stage for 10-20 min to firm up before putting them in the oven helps a little so they don't flatten out. I also baked them for 5 min WITHOUT the jam to prevent overflow. Then after putting the jam in I baked another 7-10 min until golden around the edges. I also lowered the temperature 10 degrees to 340 and baked on parchment paper to prevent burned bottoms.  Don't forget to let them set on the cookie sheet upon removal (at least 5 minutes) before transferring to a rack otherwise the cookie bottoms are not set and the jam goes right through on your counters.  (learned that the hard way).  I opted to not use the icing because it is great just the way it is and the smell they make while baking is amazing. It could take a couple tries but well worth the time and effort to perfect these cookies.  Even if they don't look picture perfect they are still delicious.

I love these cookies and make them often.  They taste just like wedding cake!  On dry days the mixture can be a little too crumbly so I add 1 egg yolk and the dough comes together nicely.

Fantastic cookie!  I was short of butter so used 1/4 shortening to make up the difference and they were great.  I actually make them that way all the time now to keep the cookie slightly soft.  Also I fill with a fudge filling: 1 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips & 1/4 cup butter melted smooth.  Use a teaspoon "or so" on the cookies.  To die for!!

A great, simple recipe.  I changed mine a little, because we already sell too many cookies with raspberry filling.  So we made then Cherry Almond Poppyseed cookies.  I added 1/4 cup poppyseeds to the batter and filled them with cherry preserves.  They went over big.  Thanks, Dee.

These were good and fairly easy, but i only gave it four stars because it didn't "WOW!" me. The family did love them though, even the picky younger ones.

I cannot say enough good things about this cookie. It was fantastic!!!So goooooood!  I practiced with one or two to see how deep to make the indentions and how much jam to add without spillover. I used seedless black raspberry. I had to work with the glaze a bit to get the right consistency. Baked for 10 min. It did not make quite 3 doz. Will make again real soon!!! thanks Dee!!!

I thought these were outstanding cookies. I read other reviews and found it helpful to add the flour a little at a time.  The dough wasn't crumbly at all and very easy to work with.  I also didn't have any seedless jam, so I substituted strawberry preserves (with seeds) and it tasted great. I also had to add slightly more milk to the glaze to make it "drippy" enough.  I wouldn't skip the glaze.  It adds a wonderul almond flavor.  I made some without it to see if my family preferred them better that way.  It was unanimous that the glazed ones were better. These are definitely a keeper.  My family loved them.  I will definitely make them again.  Thank you, Dee.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I filled a squeeze bottle with the raspberry preserves, which made filling the cookies really easy.  I also drizzled with dark chocolate instead of the glaze.  This is a permanent addition to my holiday baking!

I made these last week and they are the BEST!!  I had tried another recipe 2 weeks prior and it was bland (less sugar, unsalted butter, pinch of salt and only almond extract). I shared these with family and friends and got a lot of compliments.

Love this! Followed recipe to a tee. Well. . . I omitted the almond as I hate the taste but added fresh ground nutmeg.  These came out perfect! I followed some reviews too. I froze the cookies filled with jam for ten mins before cooking and also used a Chapstick to make the indents. Genius!! I also chilled my dough before rolling into balls as I have very hot hands. Did not soften the butter first, just creamed with the sugar using an electric mixer. Threw all the flour in and mixed by hand with a wooden spoon in a plastic bowl. My cookies look beautiful. I also just put the jam straight from the jar (seeded raspberry) into a small Baggie and snipped the corner for piping. Perfect. Would recommend turning the oven down by 10 degrees too. But I'm in Niagara Falls and we had freezing rain tonight. Happy baking!!! These cookies are awesome

I am very disappointed considering all the positive reviews! I followed the recipe exactly as said, and twice did the cookies not work out. First of all, they did not hold their shape. Second, when I took them out of he oven to cool, they became rock hard. I don't know what went wrong!

Delicious cookies and really pretty too.  I usually chill the dough for about half an hour to make it easier to work with. Strawberry jam is really nice in these as well.

Simply amazing! I did make some adjustments right away - 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup of sugar, smaller dough balls, used the end of a wooden spoon to make the indents (perfect!) and I chilled the cookies for 20 minutes prior to baking, (zero flattening, looked just like in the photo!). The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more jam to the indents part way through baking as the jam does sink. No big deal though, I just ended up topping up the indents after they were done baking. I think if I hadn't made adjustments I'd be giving the recipe 4 stars. The cookies would be too sweet and definitely would have flattened out and not looked nearly as "professional".

I saw this cookie recipe in the Allrecipes magazine December/January 2014 issue on page. 43. I decided to finally try the recipe, as I have had it saved for quite some time in my recipe box. I wanted to see how it would work for a Christmas time cookie swap. I liked how the recipe was easy to follow and the cookies held up very well. I am not a big fan of almond extract, but the flavor was very mild in the cookie. My only surprise, was what a butter tasting this was compared to similar recipes. I didn't fill them too much, as I assumed the jam would boil over the cookie. It actually stayed exactly where I put it. Only change I made was reducing the almond extract by 1/3 on the icing and added 1.5 tsp. more of milk for the right consistency. I also waited after 15 minutes of cooling time to drizzle it on, so it didn't melt. The recipe yielded 2 dozen using a standard cookie scoop. It's a simple cookie, but overall it would add variety to a cookie tray especially if other jams were used. ty

Not too sweet, and they're moist. Easy to make, and they look elegant. FOR PEOPLE WITH FLAT COOKIES: try letting the dough chill, and rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour AT LEAST. Any type of dough should be let to rest after forming. Just cover/wrap it and pop it in the fridge. No need to add or adjust the ingredients.

I make these exactly as written (with one exception as to the forming of the cookies).  They are delish!  It's a great flavor and gets gobbled up quickly at our house.  There was one thing I do differently:  rather than make small cookies, I divide the dough into two logs, maybe an inch in diameter, 12 inches long, place them on a greased cookie sheet, then make a long "trough" down the center (I use the handle of a wooden spoon), and fill that with jam.  After they bake (for approx 18 minutes), I slice them diagonally and then drizzle on the frosting.  It's very easy - less rolling - and so fast.  They turn out pretty as well.

I've made these three times in two weeks, that's how great they are. :) The suggestions I took were to 1. add an extra 1/4 cup flour, 2. use cold butter, 3. use chapstick cap to make indentation for preserves, 4. freeze them for 10 minutes before baking. My cookies come out like the picture every time. Thank you so much for this recipe!

YUM! I absolutely love these! The only changes I made were to add 1/4 cup of extra flour, as another reviewer suggested, and I only used 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract for the glaze instead of 3/4. Mine did not spread at all, but after I pressed them and put the jam in the centers I popped them in the freezer for about 3 - 5 minutes before putting them in the oven. These are really delicious, and I'll be making them again!

I absolutely love these cookies, and so did everyone in my family! I did take the suggestion of another reviewer to chill the dough after making the indentation (I used the chapstick cap idea) and filling it with jam. I think this helped my cookies from spreading too much. These cookies took about 15 minutes in my oven, and are a beautiful addition to my cookie table this Christmas. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  Almond extract (not vanilla) is what makes them so unique in flavor.  It is VERY strong though, so if you're not sure, cut back on it especially in the glaze. Chapstick cap was great idea to make the small indention. Oh, and use a good quality jam!

LOVE these !  Refrigerated dough for few hours after making it. I used a pampered chef scoop (close to 1.5") to make rounded balls. Used 1/4 rounded tsp to make the indent. Refrigerated for approx. 15 minutes prior to baking. After 10 took them out of oven to smooth/add jam if needed to each cookie( didn't want to add too much; prevented running over this way) 
Husband LOVES them and he is not a "goody" eater by far. 
A 10 start rating but you may only give 5 on this site. 
Thank you for posting this delicious cookie recipe !!

WOW!!! So good! The best tips here: use the almond extract, make the indent with a chapstick top, pipe the jam in using a plastic baggie with the tip cut off, and refrigerate for a few minutes before baking. Mine were done in 10-11 minutes, but maybe that was my oven/size of cookies, but watch 'em. My first batch cooked a bit too long, but still tasted great, and then I adjusted the time.

I made these for a surprise baby shower as well as some other cookies and these were the favorite! I did replace vanilla extract for the almond extract in the icing because the almond was a bit overwhelming. It was difficult to keep my husband away from them so I had enough to take to the shower!

Yum! I omitted the jam and nearly doubled the almond extract. I also put the cookie sheet in the freezer for 5 min before baking to help them keep their shape. Delicious Christmasy cookies! :)

I have been making these for Christmas cookies for the past few years and they are great!  I haven't tried the glaze before, though, because I think they are great without it.

i made these for Christmas and the recipe could not have been easier. seriously. It made an AWESOME tasting cookie, which was surprising, since there were so few ingredients.    TIP: make sure the jam you use is really thick because it will ooze all over the cookie and they will be flat and crazy looking.. they were still good, though.

These cookies were so easy to make.  My family and friends loved them.  I will make these over and over again. I do not like raspberries due to the tiny seeds so I used strawberry jam instead. I added chopped pecans to the cookie dough. The cookies were much better than the  Pepperidge Farm version.

This recipe is really really easy and really really good. I did refrigerate the cookies for 20 minutes after putting the jam into them. I had no spill over at all! The one thing I had trouble with was probably my fault...I had trouble getting the glaze to the right consistency. Everyone loved them and they are cute!

Perfectly simple recipe without any problems at all. I decided to add some grated meyer lemon rind to the butter/sugar mixture which gave it a little more depth of flavor. Everyone loved it when i made it last week so i had to make some more today in time for xmas.

These are the best cookies ever and so simple! Only needs to bake for about 12 minutes (and they will be so soft. :D ) I used the back of a 1/2 teaspoon to make the perfect dent and found that about a 1/4 teaspoon of jam was the perfect amount so that it wouldn't overflow when baking.

These cookies were perfect for a non-baker who participated in their first holiday cookie exchange. After the first batch, I realized I needed to  follow the advice of the others and chill the cookies before baking for a more "prettier" cookie. Using an 1/8 tsp. to indent my cookies and then again to fill with jam- every cookie looked great and tasted wonderful. They traveled well and kept moist until the party the next day at noon. Wow! Thanks for the great recipe!!

WOW these are fantastic. I was planning on making a double batch with my cookies this Christmas, tasted one, and immediately made a third batch to go along with them. I followed the recipe for the cookie exactly but didn't measure the jam; just put the (seedless) jam in a ziplock bag, snipped the end, and filled the holes I made with my pinkie fingertip to just as high as the rim. Not one leaked on me. Some cookies spread a little more than others, but all looked cute and tasted divine. I'm going to end up making these all though the year, thanks very much for sharing.

This turned out great.  Made exactly as written. Did read the reviews and used these tips from them that seemed to work.  I used a chapstick lid to make the center holes, a zip lock bag with a hole cut at the end to use to fill the cookie with jam and I set them outside (I'm in Alaska) for then minutes before baking.  Looked and tasted great. Thank you to everyone for their input.

I read MarcieJ's rating and followed her tips:  (First, turn the oven temp down about 10 degrees. Second, don't soften the butter before mixing, just cut it into 1 tbsp pieces and mix with the sugar. Third, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the dough. Finally, once you've filled the thumbprints with jam, put the whole cookie sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking)  I used a measuring tablespoon to scoop the dough so that the cookies were uniform in size. To make the hole in the middle, I used the top of a small bottle of almond extract, floured the top so it wouldn't stick to the dough, and pressed it into the middle in a circular motion. It was the perfect sized hole for the jam. I also did 1/2 with apple butter and added chopped candied pecans to the top of each after they were done baking. So good!

Wowwww these are fabulous!!! I was too impatient to chill the dough balls before baking so mine did spread out and didn't look quite as pretty as the picture, but they are SO GOOD!!!!! The chapstick end worked very well for making the holes and the jam didn't bubble out or spread at all. The only change I made was add a little extra almond extract in the dough - almond is one of my favorites. I will definitely be making these again.

These are great and super easy.  I didn't have any flattening problems like several others mentioned and if you don't overfill them, you're not going to have any issues with leakage.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract and they're really yummy.  I used fresh blueberry and strawberry preserves from a local farm, and for the glaze, I added lemon extract...fantastic!  I normally use the round end of a lemon reamer to make my thumbprints (my nails are way to long), but I tried the chapstick trick and it worked just as well.  A keeper for sure.

I really had troubles with this recipe, as it seems many of you have. I tried 2 different batches, chilling the dough before putting in the oven, etc... and they spread so badly they went right in the trash. After doing some research, I am thinking my issue resulted from using a silpat, which apparently can cause cookies to spread much more than they normally would. I will update my review once I try again on parchment. To the others who had a spreading issue, please let us know if you also used a silpat. I am giving the recipe the benifit of the doubt and giving it 3 stars for now.
Update: It was not the silpat. The last thing I can think of is that my oven is getting way too hot. I will test this theory tonight

best thumbprint cookie ever. keep your butter COLD, cut into slices then pieces, use potato masher to mix with sugar (will be firm),use hands to mix with flour until pliable. chill filled cookies at least 20 min in fridge before baking. everyone will rave.

Easy to make and few ingredients. My only complaint is the glaze...i'd either cut the almond extract in half or use vanilla extract instead or no extract at all. the almond is very over powering.

I have been making these cookies for years and they always turn out astonishingly delicious.  I had one of my friends almost cry on me when she found out they weren't Pepperidge farm and she couldn't just buy them any time.  (That's a funnier story than it sounds ^_^)  Anyway, there is a very simple trick to not have flat cookies- After mixing your dough cover your bowl TIGHTLY with foil or plastic wrap and refridgerate for 1 hour.  The balls are a little harder to make but you wind up with perfectly puffy cookies.  Also, make sure that you don't indent too deeply for your jam otherwise the bottoms won't hold together.  If after you have baked them they don't look 'jammy' enough you can fill with a little more jam before I icing.  (and to insert jam I always use a ziploc bag with on corner cut out)

I made these cookies this afternoon and they were very good.  Having never made thumbprint cookies before I made a few mistakes.  The first batch into the oven came out to flat and over done.  So I corrected.  The second batch I did not make the thumbprint so big and only cooked them 11 mins... much better.  The third batch i only made the hole with my pinky and cooked 11 mins and they were perfect.  Hub is presently trying to hurt himself and go on an all time sugar high.  I did take the advice of others and put the cookies in the fridge for 10 minutes before cooking and it helps to retain their nice shape.

great cookies. Received lots of compliments. They weren't too sweet. Looked great. Did not have trouble with the cookies coming out too flat. They came out just fine. Only mistake I did was didn't wait for the cookies to cool long enuff before adding the glaze. This caused the glaze to goop up a bit  making the cookie less attractive. To avoid the cookies coming out too flat, only make a VERY light thumbprint.  5 stars!

Make sure to chill dough thoroughly before putting in oven so cookies don't collapse. A thimble worked wonderfully to create the holes in cookie and put the rasperry jam in a baggie with a small hole in corner to fill the corners. Also, use the almond instead of vanilla extract. I tried both ways and the almond was MUCH better!

The flavor was good, however for me I only got 24 cookies and i measured the balls to see if I was making them too big, and I wasn't. .. I also found them to be VERY crumbly and dry. I know shortbread is some-what dry I just wasnt expecting it to be to that degree.

Ok...made these as written except used vanilla since I had no almond extract. Cookies are delicious, light and flaky...but mine spread WAY out...they didn't hold their shape nicely like in the picture.  I am not new to baking, but admit I've never done thumbprints before...delicious, but not the dainty cookie I was expecting.

I love the flavor of these. Yummy! Put them in the freezer for Christmas cookie handouts, so I haven't glazed yet. Used a cinnamon/pear and a strawberry/blackberry combo for the jams. Came out great, thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome cookies.  My daughter's boyfriend said these are THE BEST cookies he's ever eaten.  He calls them the Pop Tart cookies because he thinks that's what they taste like.  The amazing thing is how easy & quick they are to throw together.  I think it's very important to keep them small to keep the dough from splitting when you make the well for the jam.  I use a 1/8 c measuring cup.  This also helps make them all nice & uniform.  I had some issues at first with the cookie really spreading more than I'd like while baking.  I resolved that issue very quickly by, after making the indentation for the jam, I threw the cookies, sheet and all into the freezer for about 15 min.  Then I took them out, filled them with jam & baked them.  It resulted in very minor to no spreading at all.  The cookies were so pretty!  Also, for me the perfect 'thumbprint' maker is the end of the cap of an empty 1 oz extract jar.  I just turn the bottle upside down, push the cap in a ways, give it a little twist & create a perfect little circle!  I even tried this at first with a bottle with extract already in it & just cleaned off the bottle cap when I was done.  I have a diabetic husband so I have made these cookies with Splenda & sugar free jelly & no glaze. My husband loves them and can barely make them last but a couple of days!

These cookies are delicious! The combination of raspberry, almond and shortbread makes your mouth water; everyone who tried these cookies loves them! To make a nice thumbprint, I used the back of my round 1/2 tsp. measure. It worked perfectly! I also made some smaller cookies using a rounded tsp. of dough. I used the 1/8 tsp. measure for these thumbprints. Thanks for a new Christmas cookie favorite!

I read all of the reviews and tried to compile the best of the best since so many people complained of problems.  I added 1/4 more flour and 1 egg, per others' recommendations.  Then I chilled the dough for an hour.  I used my Pampered Chef scoop and rolled them into balls, flattening slightly so they represented saucers slightly larger than a quarter.  I used the chapstick for the preserves as recommended - worked perfectly!  I tried my first batch lowering the oven temp, but that didn't seem to work, so I baked them at 350 as directed.  Mine took about 19 minutes each to bake.  Maybe mine were larger?  My batch yielded 32 cookies.  I haven't tried the icing yet - they are delicious as is.  But I might try it and see which I like better.

Every year for Christmas I try a new cookie.  Some never make it to the dessert table and of those that do, most don't return the following year.  But these are a keeper!  They will be part of my cookie repetoire going forward! 

Thanks for a great recipe!

delicious, love the almond flavor.  I used raspberry jam.  I did chill for 20 min in fridge before putting in oven.  Make double the glaze.  Putting glaze in ziploc was helpful.  Simple.

I thought these cookies tasted great, but I didn't like the look of them at all.  I took the advice of others and after putting them on the cookie sheet, I stuck them back in the fridge.  They still spread out way too much.  I wonder if adding a 1/2 tsp of baking soda or powder might help?  Like I said, they tasted fabulous, but just not pretty after baking and spreading so flat.

Definitely use more flour and keep the cookie sheet in the freezer between baking. I didn't have to freeze the dough the 2nd time I made these. Dough should be sticky, but not enough to stick to your hands.

These cookies are a sure-fire hit with kids and adults alike!  For my first batch, I used vanilla extract instead of almond (simply because I didn't have any around).  Also, I found that I did have to add a bit of 1% milk to the dough to get it to form properly.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar as another reviewer recommended, and cut in the butter cold rather than softening it.  Before doing anything, I refrigerated the dough for about a half hour - in the meantime, I made the glaze, which did require about 3 times the milk that the recipe calls for.  After the dough had thoroughly cooled, I rolled it into about 1-inch balls.  They looked huge at first, but baked to be the absolute perfect thickness.  I should also mention that I greased my pan with the SLIGHTEST bit of Becel margarine and it gave the cookies the perfectly browned bottom that I love on shortbread.  I made only about 20 cookies out of this recipe, but had no problem with them spreading out to be too wide.  I used my pinky finger to make each hole - the key is to make the hole narrow at the bottom and increasingly wider at the top.  Also, only make the fingerprint about halfway through the cookie - that way, when it spreads out, you won't have any jam leak-age!  Lastly, I used 100% real fruit strawberry jam with no pectin and found that the tartness balanced out the shortbread to perfection.  In the future, I would like to try an orange variety with a bit of orange zest added to the dough, orange juice

Great texture, but a little too sweet and too much almond flavor for me (and I looooooove almond flavor).  I would reduce sugar a bit and use less, or no, almond extract in the glaze.  Otherwise awesome.

This is a really good recipe! I did make a few changes as advised by others so that the cookies wouldn't be flat.  I also tweeked it so that they were as sugar-free as possible. I used spelenda for baking in the same amount as regular sugar, and then sugar-free jelly. For the frosting I used a mixture of cream cheese, spelenda, milk and almond extract.  My boyfriend is diabetic and he LOVED these cookies!

pretty simple recipe and delicious results!  everyone that tried them loved them!  i had the same problem as others mentioned with the icing- i added about twice as much milk as it said in the recipe, and it turned out great!  I did not have problems with the jam spilling out- I had the best success with using my index finger instead of my thumb and then made sure I didn't fill the jam above the level of the outside of the cookie.  I also used raspberry preserves with seeds and it worked just fine.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Oh, these were just awful.  I'm making packages for Valentine's Day, and I wanted to include these, but they didn't turn out well at all.  As a Southern cook from a long line of Southern cooks, I never thought I say this, but these cookies had way too much butter.  Even after being chilled, they spread far too much.  I tried increasing and decreasing the size, the amount of jam, the baking time, everything, but no matter what I tried, they turned into shapeless blobs.  When I tried one, they were greasy and the almond flavor was barely noticeable.  It's a shame, because almond and raspberry make a lovely combination of flavors, but not in this recipe.  I won't be making this again.

Perfect cookie!  Got rave reviews at work.  I rolled them into relatively small balls and filled with a black cherry jam (also using a small baggie with a tiny hole cut out at the end to fill the indents in the cookies.)  Mine did not spread very much at all in the oven - maybe because I made them a bit smaller.  Icing was perfect.  Thanks for this recipe.

I always hate it when my experience contradicts so many other reviewers because I think I must have done something wrong, but I followed this recipe exactly and I didn't think these tasted so great. They were really bland...nothing like shortbread and I could not taste the almond flavour at all. Shame... because they looked lovely.

This was so very good.  I chilled my dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes as others had suggested and the cookies turned out great.

I used my own raspberry freezer jam that I bottled this summer and melted a little semi-sweet chocolate chips to drizzle lightly over top of the cookies.  Raspberry and chocolate go together very well, and this was no exception!!!

I really like this recipe because it's a simple, no fuss cookie that looks nice. I substituted vanilla extract for the almond and baked the cookies for a little under 14 minutes (until the bottoms were golden brown). I really liked the texture--light, flaky and crisp. Personally, I thought the texture was much improved when I used margarine instead of butter the second time I made these. My roommate said that they taste just like Pepperidge Farm Verona cookies. I made half a batch (~20 cookies) late last night right before two of my roommate's guy friends came over, and when I woke up the next morning all the cookies were gone! Wow, what a compliment! =D

i've made these cookies three times in one week, they're that good. i didn't make the glaze because i didn't think it was necessary, and it wasn't. they're perfect as is. the only problem i had is every time i made them, the flour amount changed ( by very little, but still. )2 cups is about right, but make sure you gradually add the flour until you get the consistency required. 

overall, excellent cookie. try them with guava preseves, those are the best.

A very tender and easy cookie.  I used the medium cookie scoop from Pampered Chef to scoop the cookies and didn't have any trouble working with the dough.  This doesn't make three dozen cookies, then, but I had to double the recipe anyway because they were so good!  Try apricot jam instead of raspberry.  Delicious.

These cookies were excellent.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter.  The only thing I changed was that I added a drop of green food coloring to the glaze to make them more festive for my Chrismas cookie gift baskets.  I did not find them dry at all, they were very tender.  I did watch them closely as I find that if you over cook shortbread they can become crispy and dry.  Everyone who tried them enjoyed them.  I will be making these again before the holidays are over.  I used double fruit ultra light raspberry jam and it gave a more raspberry taste rather than a jam taste.

These cookies are like no other! If you are looking for different..this is the way to go. They are perfect for tea parties and a nice addition to your holiday baking. They look very impressive. I couldnt eat more then 2 of these cookies at a time...due to the fact that they are very sweet.

Like one of the other reviewers said you definately need to add some liquid to this or it's simply impossible to form.  It just kept falling apart and then trying to press my thumb into the middle just made it fall apart.  I added some water to it and that helped a lot.  I started with 1/4 cup of water and added more as needed.  It came out very good though.  I'd make again, but maybe add a bit more sugar.

These are excellent cookies, and worth the effort!  The shortbread cookie is extremely light and delicate. Dough can be a little difficult to work with...add flour 1/2 cup at a time.  When forming balls, warm dough in hands for a few seconds to prevent crumbling.  Don't skimp on the raspberry preserves!

I put them into the freezer for 10 minutes before cooking and they turned out perfectly!  I found they tasted even better a day or two after baking them.

Great recipe! I added 1/3c finely chopped almonds to the batter and used Cherry Polaner All Fruit instead of raspberry jam the first time. The second time I added the chopped almonds again and used the raspberry jam. The jam ran on the pan. Will use the Cherry Polaner All Fruit again. It became a family favorite at Christmas. I used a melon baller to get the size right - they will spread when you bake them. Also I put the icing in a sandwich bag (put it in a 4oz juice glass first) and made a tiny cut on the tip, it worked perfectly. Keep the cookies on the foil or parchment paper (if you line your pans) to ice the cookies - super easy!

Oh Wow! These haven't even cooled yet and already I'm thinking of making them again. I followed the recipe exactly, but I chilled the cookies for ~20 minutes before putting them in the oven. Also, the chapstick-top method of making the holes is key!
EDIT: These are my new favorite cookie! I've made them four times in the last month (the holidays are always a great excuse for baking immoderately) and they have gotten great feedback every time. I think what really sets them apart is how beautiful they look. Chilling before baking seems to guarantee tall cookies with no run-away filling.

These were good but difficult to make. Especially the glaze. Mine clumped out but I did not have a way to pipe so used a Baggie. The glaze got hard too fast  would thin it out more next time

tasty even without the glaze drizzle, which i think makes them too sweet. would have given 5 stars if not for the slightly dry texture. i can't seem to press the thumprint without cracking them. but these are my son's favorite :) we make them all the time

We loved these cookies!  I made the recipe exactly as-written, and they turned out absolutely delicious!  I did add just a little touch extra milk to the glaze, because it made it a little easier for me to "drizzle" it.  A note I will offer to other cookie bakers:  When it says soften the butter...you must ONLY soften the butter.  Take a lot of care not to melt the butter.  

The best scenario would be to have had two cubes of butter sitting out on the counter at room temperature and ready to go.  Being that isn't very likely, using a microwave you need to take care not to melt the butter.  If you melt it, the cookies will be flat, as some others have said.  I put my cubes in the microwave on 20% power for 1 minute.  After it stopped, I opened the microwave, removed the butter checked it for softness, and determined more time was necessary.  I put it in at 30% power for 45 seconds.  That got it pretty close...but to get it just a touch closer, it put it back in at 20% power for 35 seconds.  Perfection. ;)  My cookies turned out awesome!  ENJOY~

This has become a family favorite.  However, I did find the cookies to be done in 6 to 8 minutes, not the 14 to 18 stated in the recipe.

I made these little gems yesterday just for a change in my Christmas baking, they are quick, simple and amazing, I shaped the dough into balls and refrigerated over night, the next day was a breeze the dough kept its shape didn't flatten out at all. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is worth taking the time to rate. 5+ stars for sure.  Wonderfully simple, beautiful, and scrumptious!  I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed.  One of my favorite things about these cookies is they are not too sweet.  This recipe is going into my archives to make again and again.  Thank you for sharing, Dee!

These are really good, with some great almond flavor.  The cookie dough is really easy to make, the hardest part is getting the raspberry preserves in the middle of the cookie.  Also I doubled the icing recipe because I didn't think there was enough on the top of the cookies.

I loved this recipe. I changed it up a bit as people were saying that the cookies would spread and I already had a thumbprint cookie recipe that I made with buttercream frosting. I kind of combined the two by just adding more flour so that the cookies did not spread as much. I added more flour until the dough would stop sticking to my hands and would form nicely. I also used a Tbsp to make all of the cookies uniform in size. I used the almond extract, but for those of you who are wanting to use vanilla, you would have to add 4 tsp of vanilla instead of the 1/2 tsp that the recipe calls for with the almond extract. I like my cookies to be a bit softer as well so I only baked it for 10-12 minutes. I made raspberry filling and cherry. If you want to make butter cream frosting instead, the recipe I like to use calls for 2 Tbsp of butter (not margarine), 2 tsp of milk, and 1 c of powdered sugar. Just add more sugar to thicken the recipe or milk to smooth it out. Hope this is helpful!

These came out perfect!! I followed other reviewers and put the cookie tray in the fridge for 15 mins before popping them in the oven. Maybe it was this that did the trick because the texture turned out great and the shape was just like store bought ones (perfect!). 
Thanks for sharing the wonderful recipe - my girls loved it. The almond raspberry combo is super!!

I've made this recipe for 17 years.  My glaze is 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract, and 2-3 teaspoons water.  They are delicious.  I have an annual cookie exchange where we trade a dozen cookies each.  My guests always are asked if they would like to make smaller amounts to exchange and it's an overwhelming no because they all want a dozen of these cookies.  I've NEVER had any difficulty with this recipe.  I've even changed to vanilla extract for my husband, who does not care for almond.  He loves them. I also make the glaze in a zippered bag and cut a small hole in the corner to put the glaze on the cookies. I do place waxed paper on the counter before drizzling the glaze.  It's much easier to clean up, if my daughter doesn't get to it first.

I didn't have almond extract, so I substituted vanilla.  I also ran out of butter and used 1/2 vegetable oil.  I also used homemade raspberry jam that wasn't seedless. Reading these other reviews prompted me to try letting them hang in the freezer for a few minutes before baking. They took twice as long to bake, but were perfectly delicious!  

I also tried adding some of my jam to the glaze so it came out bright pink.  Cute and tasty, too!

I have been making these for years!!!! Everybody that has ever had these loves them... I think it helps if your butter is more cold than hot...not quite room temp. That is the trick to these

Everyone loved these!!!  TIPS... cut back oven to 325 degrees, used parchment paper, cut back butter to 3/4 cup, used hands for final mixing about 30 seconds, applied sugar to back of 1/4 tsp to press (keeps them from sticking), use the same 1/4 tsp to fill. My new favorite cookie.  Only lightly golden where cookie meets the parchment.  Omitted drizzle...sweet enough without.  Still plenty of buttery taste with cut back and not too rich. PERFECT!!!  Friends and family said they couln't stop eating them. Cooking time varies between 13 and 16 depnding on size. Used blackberry and strawberry from Cracker Barrel and my mom's homemade rasberry preserves.  Homemade was best...thanks mom!!!

I made these with the ingredients exactly as they were in the recipe and they were delicious! After I rolled the dough and put the jam on, I put them in the refrigerator on the cookie sheet and they did not flatten out when cooking.

I have been making these for almost 50 years. Chilling before cooking is good and always use almond extract. To make the dent , you don't have to go looking for chapstick, the handle end of a cheap wooden spoon works very well and if the spoon starts to stick ... dip it in sugar, makes a nice deep well for the jelly. Also, I have made these cookies minus the jelly and filled them with different butter icings for Christmas and Easter

My favorite cookie recipe EVER. Everyone I've ever made these for agrees that although the raspberry ones are good the apricot ones are PHENOMENOL… the bomb. I use a jar of Smucker's sugar-free apricot preserve. I find it easier to use my index finger instead of my thumb as the thumb leaves one side lower instead of an even indentation. Do yourself a favor, make a double batch.

These were okay.  If I made them again, I'd make them smaller (my fault they were too big) and go really easy on the glaze.  But I won't likely make them again - there are lots of cookies I'd rather eat.

These are the best tasting cookies. I love them at Christmas time. I recommend chilling each batch in the freezer before baking. They really spread otherwise.

Excellent recipe as is!  Even better is the fact you can use the dough part of the recipe to make delicious shortbread cookies of any variety!  I made this recipe with a slight alteration, I rolled half of each ball of dough in raw sugar, flattened it with a coffee cup, and viola!  Delicious sugar crusted shortbreads. 1/10/15 addition.  I made these for my niece who is ALLERGIC to dairy.  I substituted Parkay squeeze margerin instead of butter in the same amount at the recipe and I used unsweetened almond milk in place of the milk in the drizzle ingredients.  She loved them, they came out awesome.

These cookies are so easy and so yummy, I think it's impossible to screw them up.  Everytime I make them, they don't last more than a day.  I increase the almond extract to a full teaspoon and I add about 1/4 cup nuts (chopped small) to the dough after it's all mixed.  I've used a variety of jams and they all taste great.

Easy to make.  The cookies seemed to need a little salt.  Next time I will try with salted butter.   I used two long-handled dessert spoons to get the filling in the holes.  Baby spoons would work as well

These were good.  I followed another reviewer's advice and turned the temperature down 10 degrees, didn't soften the butter before cutting, and froze them for a few minutes before baking.  Mine turned out still a little flat, so next time I might also add an extra 1/4 cup of flour, but they tasted delicious anyways!  Oh, and I just used my forefinger to push the middle in, and I didn't have any jelly overflow...

I've made these several times and every time they are wonderful and everyone loves them.  I don't alter the recipe except we use jams other than raspberry.  I initially found this recipe due to a family members egg allergy but now I just make them because they're wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly (or tried to) and the cookies spread so much that they ran together.  And 1 tsp milk isn't nearly enough for the icing - makes a paste rather than anything that can be drizzled over cookies.  Very disappointed.....

These are great little cookies. Everyone who has tried them (and it's been a LOT of people) loves them. I often don't use the glaze. I like them both ways. Also, you can try some poppy seeds in the dough. Very pretty!

These sure are some delicious cookies!  The almond and the raspberry goes great together.  We made the recipe exactly as stated and it made a little more than 2 dozen cookies.  We are going to have to make another batch because I can already tell that they wont last long!  The flavor is so good!  They do try to flatten and spread out a lot when baking, like  many others have said.  The best thing to do is when making your indent is to make it small and deep and leave the dough as much in a ball as possible, try not to flatten them much.  Excellent recipe and this sure is a keeper!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I found the dough did not stay true to form. I tend to like more jelly, but since the dough spead out so much, the jelly ran out of the cookie or ended up cooking on the cookie sheet. thou the flavor is out standing, the look of the cookie,, kind of a mess! the sugar topping, also out standing, but has to add more milk and extract then what the reciepe called for. all in all, great flavor, but not the easiest if you are doing this kind of cookie for the first time.

Love these cookies! I planned on making 1 batch but ended up making another they were that good. If you generally find almond extract to be overwhelming I suggest using vanilla instead.
My dough was crumbly the first time around so I kneaded the dough in my hands a bit before I rolled into a ball. 
This did not happen on my second batch but I am certain that was because I only let my butter soften for an hour vs several the first time.
My cookies had a "cracked" appearance but I liked the look of them that way.
I also used vanilla for the frosting instead of almond. I find too much can be overwhelming. 
I can't wait to try these cookies with different jams!

This is a wonderful recipe! Make a batch this weekend and they were great! I used raspberry jam for the filling and because they are a soft cookie and I was putting on cookie trays I did not use the glaze on top because I was afraid it would make them softer.  This will be used over and over again. Wonderful flavor and easy, easy for a cookie that looks like it took a long time! Thanks for a great recipe!

I owe you an apology! I found these last year and made them to go on my Christmas cookie plates for neighbors. I made them again in February because they looked beautiful for a Valentine's dessert. GK's and DH just loved them.  I made them again in September for grandsons 3rd grade class. Not one has survived either occasion!  Grape jelly, raspberry, strawberry and blueberry have been used with great success.  I was just looking through my cookie list and saw them and knew that they'd be on this years cookie platters as well.  My DH took Valentine Day cookie leftovers to work and i shared the recipe with 4 of the gals in his office.  To say they are a favorite is an understatement. I'm softening some butter "as we speak"! Thank you for a proven winner!!

These are perfectly simple and delicious cookies! I didn't have any of the issues mentioned by others and I didn't do anything special to any of the ingredients. My butter was frozen so I had to nuke it a bit to soften it. I mixed everything by hand. I used my thumb to flatten a middle part and then my fingertip to make another, smaller, dent - I think another reviewer's suggestion of using a small measuring spoon to make the indentation is a great idea! As long as you make sure the walls are closed, there should be no issues with the jam running. I didn't have any issues with the dough flattening - they baked into pretty much the shape I formed them in originally. I made 1/3 of the recipe for an even dozen to test these out and they were AMAZING with the blackberry jam I used! I can't wait to make more for the holidays with black cherry and apricot jams!

a little time consuming, but so good. Use good raspberry jam. Make sure the jam is good and cold before you assemble. These always please a crowd and will be making them at christmas every year :)

Refrigerate the dough! It makes all the difference. I used orange marmalade and green cake gel to make little pumpkin cookies for my daughter's preschool. So cute!

I cant even say how sad I was that this recipe didn't work for me at all. I made exactly as directed and even chilled the dough between baking and the cookies flattened out like pancakes. I'm not sure what went wrong. If I ever tried to make these again for kicks and giggles, I will use vanilla in place of the almond extract. To me the taste was overwhelming. Thanks for sharing though!

So yummy, and good to make with kids - they loved putting the holes in (using chapstick lid, thanks for the suggestion) and filling them with jelly. In my opinion, the more jelly the better.

I made these cookies several times and altered the recipie based on other reviews. Based on one review, I did not soften the butter and had an aweful time trying to blend the butter and sugar together. Also, the batter turned out extremely crumbly and I had to add melted butter to it to get it to stick so I could shape it. The next time I made it I used margarine and simply softened it with the soften button on the mircowave and the batter turned out terrific and not crumbly at all! To make the thumb prints I took a 1/4 teaspon measuring spoon and used that to press the "thumbprints" instead of my actual thumb. These cookies are delicious and were a hit with everyone! I will deffinitely make this recipie again and again!

I made these to take to the Veterans Home for Christmas.  The only thing I changed was instead of raspberry jam I used Bosenberry.  (It's all I had.)  They turned out so good I did not frost them.

These cookies were terrific and a dainty dessert to bring to my womans group! I did make the well larger and deeper for the jam, this way I had no issues with it running out of the cookie. Also, I drizzled the cookie with alot of melted white chocolate instead of a powdered sugar glaze, this worked very well and tasted even better. Finally for those who didn't like jam, I left a few wells empty while baking and simply topped them with chocolate chips while still warm after baking, and spread the melted chocolate around the hole. One thing to mention, perhaps it's my oven but I baked them less then the suggested time.

Love these!  So easy and delicious!  To keep from spreading always cream the butter by hand, never in the microwave!  The women in my family make cookies every Christmas and haven't added a recipe to the traditional ones until now!  They are our new favorite!

I made these for Christmas gifts. I got glowing compliments, and I didn't even add the icing! So much better than other raspberry thumbprint recipes I've used. The shortbread texture was perfect, and the almond makes it better. Terrific recipe! Thank you Dee for sharing it.

Delicious recipe, thanks. Definitely chill the cookies before baking, helps to keep their shape. I also had better luck using a cookie pan with sides versus my flat air-bake sheet. Don't crowd them when baking. Tried several varieties of jam, all were great.

Wow!  Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly but found that when I made the glaze that it was really thick so I needed to add more than 1 teaspoon of milk.  Also that didn't make much glaze, so I ended up whipping that up three times (for every sheet that came out of the oven).  We liked them more frosted, so you could probably get away with just doing it once and using it for all the cookies, but I have to say the more drizzle the better they were.  They are SO delicious and will be a total hit over Christmas.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These cookies are delicious and perfect for the season.  I followed the suggestions of other users, making the "thumbprint" with my chapstick container and putting these in the refrigerator for 10m right before I put them in the oven.  They turned out beautifully and taste great!

SO delicious. Definitely follow the recommendations on the first page. My first batch was flat and the jam ran like crazy but after I made the adjustments they were perfect. I used raspberry rhubarb jam and vanilla extract. I loved these!

These cookies are amazing! I made them exactly as the recipe calls for and had no problems. When making the imprint, think less thumbprint and more poking a hole with your index finger. If you create a small volcano like shape and make sure to press any visible “cracks” in the dough together before filling and baking you should be fine. The shortbread is so rich and not too sweet. The combination of almond and raspberry is delicious! These are now taking a place with the rest of my traditional Christmas Cookies on the cookie platters.

Phenomenal cookies. These came out perfectly on the first try, following the recipe almost exactly, besides using margarine in place of butter, since I had no real butter at the time. Surprisingly they still came out perfectly. I made this recipe for my mother, who says her grandmother used to make them. I'm not usually a fan of shortbread cookies, and especially not almond flavorings, but these were just delicious, even I couldn't say no to them. I made three batches: lemon, banana and strawberry. The lemon are my favorite :)

FINALLY SUCCESS!! I had almost given up on these cookies--though they are super delicious, I have had marginal success with them in the past. The first year I made them, they were perfect, then each year after that I have had disappointing results with them flattening out, the dough drying out, etc. to where they were embarrassing to serve. I didn't change anything about how I made them, so I couldn't understand why this kept happening. But thanks to the suggestions posted in the reviews, this year they came out picture perfect and delicious as ever. Special thanks to "sdk" for her summary of changes to the recipe. I will continue to make them with the adjustments from now on.

Tasty, rich and melt in your mouth.  The picture looks so pretty but when I made my indents the dough broke apart.  I was hoping for a more presentable cookie since I was making them as a gift.  The flavor was great so I had no choice by to eat the ugly ones!  Darn.  I would try again but soften my butter a little more and perhaps a little less flour???  The almond really makes the cookie so don't substitute!

I love the simpleness and taste of good shortbread and these did not disappoint. Followed recipe except for subbing vanilla extract and I also put the unbaked cookies in the freezer while pre-heating the oven. Instead of the almond-flavored drizzle, I melted about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1 tsp. of butter in the microwave and then used a fork to drizzle the chocolate glaze over each cooled, cookie. Love the raspberry/chocolate combo in any dessert.  If you want true shortbread DO NOT add eggs or any other ingredients.

Make sure you put the jam into a ziplock bag for piping it into the cookie centers, it makes it a million times easier!

ALERT!!! Do not try to bake these cookies without first chilling for at least 10 minutes...longer if you have the time.  No tweaking is needed to this recipe other than that. I made my balls out of heaping tablespoons made the deep indents with a AA battery (funny I know), filled them with the jam and chilled them for 10 minutes.  Cooked them for 16 minutes at 340 and they were perfect. Also I sprinkled them confectioners sugar instead of the drizzle.  Sprinkle while warm and it melts in the jam but stays visible on the cookie and looks so nice!

The flavor of the cookies is good, but getting them to come out like the picture using the original recipe is impossible. I tried using cool cookie sheets lined with parchment, chilling the dough...I wanted to remain faithful to the recipe. They were still flat and leaky. They taste good, but they are not pretty enough for me to give as gifts. I'm sure there are better recipes out there, so I'm not going to bother with this one again.

I made these delicious cookies for a cookie exchange and they were wonderful! The dough was rather dry and crumbly but they baked up beautifully and were very similar to sugar cookies. I filled mine with blackberry jam using a 1/4 tsp. to spoon out the jam. Apricot and strawberry jams are next!

Tastes like a pop-tart. Really. I made these and was pretty excited, but was underwhelmed once I tasted the cookies. If a home-made, better-for-you version of a pop-tart is what your looking for than go for it. Honestly, it just wasn't what I was looking for.

Oh, my.....  I am an avid baker and these were not good.  My cookies spread and were crumbly.  I tried chilling the dough AND chilling the filled cookies.

These are wonderful. In my version, I changed the sugar to 1/3 white and 1/3 light brown, added more extract, 2 yolks & 1 TB water. Also the glaze needs a little more than 1 tsp milk. Yield: 39  I've been playing around with this recipe and with Rosenmunnar (also this site). This one is better IMO. Based on my experience and the comments of others, I think the trick with this is cold dough and this means 30 minutes or so in the frige & using stick butter/margarine, not tub or easy-spread. If it becomes overly softened, chill to re-firm before proceeding. Wait for the cookie sheet to cool completely before loading the next batch. After figuring this out, I had no problems with spreading.

These were delicious.  I made them for a cookie sharing party and they ended up being my favorites from that night (and several others' favorite as well).  Delicious!

These are super yummy cookies!! In order to make the jam a bit more easier to work with I put it in a zip lock bag, just like the icing part. And put it in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds. This made it easier to handle and fill the cookie cups. I also did the same with the confectioners sugar icing part, which I really almost think you don't need because the cookies are sweet enough with the jam. They are good either way though! I did not change the recipe at all although being a novice cooker for this type of cookie, I did put them in the freezer after putting the jam in there and they did not spread at all. They look beautiful and taste super yummy!! thank you for a great recipe!!!

Stuck the dough in the fridge like others have suggested which made for better looking cookies.  Like another reviewer said, these cookies taste better the next day instead of fresh out of the oven.  These were good, but I liked another recipe that I had for jam thumbprints instead.

This is a wonderful recipe for thumbprint cookies. I altered the recipe a little bit adding 2 egg yolks (thanks to a review) and using unsalted butter. Instead of using raspberry for the whole batch, I split it up and apricot, apple butter, lemon curd, and blackberry. They were all fantastic. This is a recipe I will keep for a long time. Thanks!

I made these cookies after seeing them in the Photo of the Day section of this website.  They are absolutely delicious!  The only change that I made, was using strawberry preserves instead of raspberry.  My husband gobbled them all up! 5 stars!!!  :~)

I won a local cookie contest (the first time I entered) with a variation of these cookies.  It is important to put the prepared cookies on your cookie sheet (before filling with jam) and put the whole thing in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes before filling with jam and baking. In my version, I used lemon extract and lemon peel and left out the almond extract.  Added vanilla extract to the drizzle icing instead of almond. 
To shape cookies properly, I rolled them into a ball and used small plastic bottle cap to make the hole.  Then, filled a ziploc baggie with jam and snipped the corner to neatly fill the jam in the hole. Watch them carefully so as not to overbake. After cookies cool, a plastic bottle works well with thinned out icing for the drizzle.  
If cookie dough is too dry or falls apart as you are shaping them, I have found that adding a teaspoon or two of egg substitute or egg white to the mix will make it moist enough to work with the dough without changing the cookie much.
If you skip the freezer step or handle the dough too much, you will have flat cookies.These are the best cookies if you like a tart/sweet combo!

To die for!!!  These are melt in your mouth DELICIOUS!  I didn't change a thing ingredient wise, I just put them in the freezer 15 minutes before baking because I was worried they would get too flat without chilling.  They came out beautiful and tasted even better.

They were good, but a little too buttery for me.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of butter and add a little milk to make the dough a little more workable.  Otherwise, they smelled delicious baking in my house and were easy to make.

ONLY MADE 20 COOKIES!  Nowhere near the 3 dozen that the recipe was supposed to make.  That being said, these things are terrific!  They look just like the picture and taste delicious.  If you need more cookies, double the recipe.

These turned out fantastic. I did follow some of the suggestions and chilled the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes and used a chapstick to make the indentation for the jam.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  Fill the jam all the way to the top of the indentation, if you chill before baking, the jam will not spill over the cookie. I did not double the glaze and found that it was plenty for a light drizzle on these cookies. Delicious and can't wait to make them again.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out exactly like the picture. I used the end of a lipstick to make my indents into the shortbread balls and the end of a spoon or fork to load the the jelly in. The trick for the jam not to spill is to leave them as little balls then just press in your indent. They will flatten a little while baking. Thanks

Excellent!  I left the glaze off since they were already quite sweet.  Just be sure to wipe the baking sheet off between batches- any butter on the sheet makes them spread enormously and become very thin, sad cookies.

Seriously great shortbread recipe. Flavor and texture are spot-on. I made the slight change of adding one egg yolk and maybe 1/4 cup of extra flour. Next time I think I may cut the almond extract back to 1/4 tsp and add 1/2 tsp of vanilla, as the almond flavor is a little strong for me.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the almond extract and rolled the cookie dough in white sugar before putting it on the cookie sheet.  I used a melon baller to measure out the cookies and then used the smaller melon baller to do the indent.  Looks a lot harder than it is.

Very nice tasting cookie, however, the dough was very crumbly, and as suggested by others, I needed to add milk to bind.  Also, was only able to get 24 cookies out of this recipe, not 36.

I have regular looking flat cookies with blobs of my homemade strawberry jam in the middle of them sitting on my stove now.  I don't have almond extract so I used vanilla, and I wouldn't think that would impact it.  I also used freshly milled soft wheat for my flour (which I used a few hours prior for pancakes that turned out just fine).  If these don't at least taste decent I'm going to be really ticked about using a whole cup of butter on a recipe that is worthless.  And yes, I popped the cookies into the freezer before I baked them like other reviewers had mentioned.

Very easy and very good. I had to add more milk, but other than that, stuck to the recipe exactly.  There are so many reviews, the only helpful tip I can give is I used a tbsp of dough for each "ball" I rolled. It yielded EXACTLY 24 cookies. And the icing was EXACTLY enough. Not one drop more was left of either dough or icing.  That kind of surprised me for some reason.

I was happy to find this recipe as my aunt makes these and I always liked them.  They are pretty and taste so good.  There are never any left when I make them.  After making them several times I have learned not to use too much jam or make the "thumbprint" to deep or the jam will seep threw the bottom of the cookie and make a sticky mess.  The jam spreads out when it's in the oven too so keep that in mind and try to use a small round measuring spoon to apple to the cookie so they will be uniform.  I have the glaze down now too and after trial and error in found it works best to use a very small ziplock bag and poke a very small hole in the corner to pipe it out with a safety pin. Using parchment paper is a must too.

These cookies were wonderful and would be perfect for Christmas or Valentine's day.  The dough seemed really dry at first so I worked it with my hands and that helped it come together.  Then I refrigerated it for about 30 minutes.  Form into tight balls.  When making the indentions, press down slowly to reduce cracks.  I drizzled mine with melted white chocolate!!!

Boy, other reviewers are sure right on the almond extract thing. I only had vanilla on hand, and though they were pretty good, they were missing something. Almond extract is a must! I used raspberry jam in some, apricot in others. Drizzled melted chocolate on the apricot, and the other reccomended glaze on the raspberry. I also refriged the prepped cookies as suggested before baking. They came out nice and tall, held their shape perfectly. I was thinking it might be interesting if I took some almonds and pulverized them in my mini food processor and added a bit to the cookie dough. A nice holiday/anyday cookie. Another idea would be to use orange extract and fill with apricot or orange marmalade. Fun,pretty,and easy to make.

These cookies came out beautiful and they taste great too! To prevent the cookies from cracking, make sure to make the thumbprint right after you roll them. I used a 1/4 teaspoon to make the thumbprint and it worked really well.

i've made these a few times now.  the first time i didn't soften the butter (like the most popular review said), and i think that while it marginally improved the cookie texture, it sure as heck made them a pain to get the dough together, and stay together.  as such, it makes for much larger cookies.  and often the jam would leak out as the cookie came apart in the oven.  if you soften the butter first, you can make smaller cookies, and easily mold them.  i made balls, and then pushed my pointer finger in to make the dents, thumb on the outside,  while spinning the little balls, to get a nice deep indent, but maintaining the integrity of the edges.  also, you don't need to pipe the jam in.  just get a really small measuring spoon.  you can scoop the jam like icecream, and plop the dollop into the indent.  AND you don't need to freeze them.  just refrigerate until cold.  especially because you don't want to risk the smell of freezer burn.  and i double the milk in the icing, because it just wasn't runny enough to spread on nicely initially.

Ten Stars! These are awesome! I took some great advice from others. I used a sandwich baggie to pipe the jam into the cookies and put in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. I also dropped the temp to 340. They taste delicious and turn out so pretty.

I read the tips on how to chill the dough beforehand and increasing the oven temp to 375* to prevent flattening. Well, they still turned flat on me! Oi! I'm disappointed but found out that a cookie recipe with too much grease tend to spread. Therefore, I will try again with less butter. Oh, and LESS SUGAR...maybe 1/2 cup! These were a little too sweet for my Asian tastebuds.

Perfect and easy when the suggestions are used. I added 1/4 cup of flour, placed in freezer for 10 minutes and baked at 340.  Also, I used small sandwich bags with small cut to fill and to add drizzle. Make sure cookies are "totally" cool before using drizzle. Will make again.

Excellent, used the advice of others and rolled the balls the circumference of a quarter then used the top of a chapstick container to form the indent in the middle to put the jam in.  I used blackberry jam and it was wonderful!!!

WOW! Perfect! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and chilled the cookies for 15 mins. in the fridge before baking. I also used a 1/2 tbsp scoop to measure out the cookies, and a chapstick top to make the indent. I did not experience any trouble with the jam overflowing or with the cookies spreading too much. I followed the recipe amts and ingredients exactly, and I will definitely be making these again.

Very, very good. I did follow other reviewers' advice and changed a few things, such as adding a little extra flour, and not fulling the cookies to the top with raspberry jam... I actually wish I did, because they ended up not having enough jam in each. The shortbread is delicious though so it's alright. Mine cracked like crazy but I'm guessing it's because I'm an amateur... but they still held together. Also, for the glaze, I absolutely cannot imagine how 1 tsp is enough to get the right consistency... I added 1 1/2 tsp more to mine and it was perfect.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I chill the dough, then make into little balls. I use the end of a wooden spoon to make the indentations, and pipe the jam in the indentations with a pastry bag. Quick, easy and perfect every time!

These cookies were flawless! So easy to make yet so tasty you'd think they'd be more difficult. I substituted vanilla extract for almond since I didn't have any in the house.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I rarely use white, all-purpose flour to make my recipes healthier, so I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the all-purpose, which really gave these cookies a nice "nutty" flavor along with the almond extract.  Because I used the whole wheat flour, I added 1/4 c. of butter (I used margerine), increased the almond extract in the dough to 3/4 tsp., and baked them 18-20 minutes.  They were easy to form and fill and they turned out delicious!!! I will be making these a lot--next time I'll try them with blackberry preserves.

I've been making these for a few years and they are always a hit on the Christmas Cookie Platters, plus one of my personal favorites.  Some recommendations, make the cookies smaller than recommended, make only a shallow indentation to keep the jam from cooking through the bottom, put in fridge for a few minutes before baking to keep the cookies from spreading too much, remove from oven when edges just start to brown, and make double the glaze.  Cookies are pretty and taste even better.

These cookies are delicious.  I must have made my cookies too large because I ended up with 2 dozen instead of the 3 dozen that the recipe yields.  At first, I had trouble working with the dough, but the warmth of my hands made it easier to work with.  You just need to hold the dough and work with it for a few extra seconds.  If the dough cracked when I put my thumbprint in it, I picked up the dough and tried it again.  They came out beautiful.  I made several kinds of cookies for Christmas this year, and these were the first ones to disappear.

OMG! The BEST thumbprint cookies ever!!! I was probably too busy baking and eating these last Christmas so it's been a year and I forgot to put up a review for this recipe! I followed other reviewers' tips (i.e. extra 1/4 cup flour, making small balls, using end of handle of wooden spoon to perfectly indent the balls, and chilling in fridge before baking) and my cookies came out perfect-looking and delicious! These are melt in your mouth goodness and one batch is never enough. In fact, I think I made 3-4 batches of these last Christmas and I may have only given away 1 of those batches in my cookie gift boxes because I kept the rest all for me---yes, me!!! This is sooo good, it should be illegal!

The recipe is perfect as it is. My fiance inhaled these cookies! Don't let their "whitish" colour fool you - they are not meant to get extra golden, so don't overbake.

WONDERFUL! However it took me two batches to get the shape right. I learned in the second batch to make much smaller dough balls. They really grow. Plus the smaller they are the less cracks you get when you thumb em. Plus I put the jam in a ziploc, kneaded it a bit and cut a tip. Squeezed into the cookie. Looked much neater and spread much better then glooping it in with a teaspoon. I also found that not chilling the dough and just keeping a damp tea towel over it to keep it moist worked out much better. When the dough was chilled it cracked when I thumbed em. I also put the glaze in a ziploc and cut a tip. I can't tell you how many people honestly thought it was the best cookie they ever had! Oh and even if they still look raw in the oven take them out at 14 minutes let set for a minute on the cookie tray and remove to a wire rack. This keeps them really soft, if you perefer softer cookies. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made all the changes MarcieJ suggested, and the cookies turned out perfect on my first try.  Marcie's suggestions were: don't soften butter, just cut into 1TBSP and then beat it, add 1/4 c more of flour, put in freezer for 10 minutes before putting in oven, and bake for 14 minutes at 340 degrees.  I also used chapstick cap to make the indentations and used strawberry jam.  
For the glaze, I had to use 2 1/2 tsp of milk to get the right consistency and then I used a small syringe to glaze over the cookies (you can get one at a pharmacy counter - make sure it has a good suction).
Great cookies and very pretty!!!

my grandmother and mother made these for christmas every year . they would use grape jam and then when cookies came out of oven would sprinkle powder sugar on them . you should chill dough first.

I used vanilla extract and had no problem.  My husband LOVES these. BC I had no almond extract I ground up almonds, and rolled the cookie dough in the cruched almonds before making the imprint and fillign with jam.  Turned out GREAT!

These cookies are delicious. They have become a christmas favorite in our house. I first made them after I got the recipe from a Land O Lakes cookie booklet several years ago. For those that think it has to much almond extract, I think it is because this recipe calls for it in the glaze, which is easily omitted. YUM!

This recipe was so easy and the cookies were delicious!  I didn't have almond extract, so I used vanilla and had no problems.  The only things I did differently from the recipe was to use butter flavor Crisco and also put the cookies w/ jam in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking them.

These are the easiest most delicious cookies ever!!  I prefer them without the sugar drizzle on top...I think the icing is nice for presentation but doesn't  really add much to the cookie itself except extra sweetness, which it doesn't really need.  I would suggest baking these on parchment paper.  They tend to get too brown on the bottoms if you don't  and lose their delicate texture.  I cannot get enough of these!!

Oh my goodness, these are amazing and remind me of my childhood. I didn't have almond essence but they turned out amazing anyway and taste superb. I noticed that even though the shortbread was a bit crumbly, it still help up in the oven really well and had a nice crunch. Once they cooled, you couldn't stop my husband from eating them, rofl.

These remind of Pecan Sandies!  I cut the recipe in half, added 1/4 cup of almond flour, and a couple of teaspoons of lemon zest.  The dough was very easy to form into balls.  I put them in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking, but this made them hardly drop at all, so I ended up mashing them down with a fork 10 minutes into baking.  I didn't do the filling or glaze; they were great as is.

These cookies were so easy to make.  My biggest suggestion is to refirgerate the dough for atleast an hour before rolling into balls and making the cookies.  Remember, they do expand a bit in the oven.  So even though they may look a bit small before baking, they come out beautiful and delicate from the oven.  And lastly, don't over fill the centers with too much jam.  A little goes a long way.

Very delicious recipe!  The dough was WAY tastier than we expected, thus the recipe yielded several fewer cookies than expected.  Do not leave these cookies or this dough unattended for long. :D

They were great made them for a family get-together(easter) and everyone loved them the great thing is you van use whichever jam flavor you prefer and it still taste fabulous, make sure to let your dough sit in the refriderator so it isnt sticky and hard to shape :)

An excellent recipe!  Mine turned out quite well.  I did have to add a small bit of water to the dough and some more milk to the glaze (which is optional).

Most importantly, I LOVE these cookies with a single fresh, crushed raspberry in each cookie in place of the jam.  It gives it a more natural, unique flavor, and it's even more beautiful.

Something went terribly wrong in my attempt to make these cookies. The end result was like eating a glob of jelly out of a sandbox... Extremely dry! I didn't even finish baking the rest of the mixture. Dissapointing.

I'm only giving four stars because I had to make a few improvements. I had to add water to the dough, which came out way too crumbly. I added just enough to make a dough ball. I also had to add additional milk to the icing, as it was not even close to being drizzly. 
On the plus side, everyone loved these cookies! I will definitely make these again!

I am a chocoholic at heart, but these little morsels have turned my head!  I used a 1/4 teaspoon to fill the thumbprint with jam (perfect size!) and then put the entire cookie sheet in the freezer.  Didn't need to bake them as long as the recipe says, need to watch them closely not to overbake.  Used the trick of putting the glaze in a ziploc bag and cut the end off to drizzle over the cookies.  Made them look very professional.

These cookies were great. Very easy to make. My husband said I did not have to make any other cookie ever again.  If you have trouble with getting jelly all over, try using a piping bag. Works great.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and added about 2Tbsp. more flour, then chilled in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking them off at 340F. For the glaze, used 2 tsp. milk. My only tip is NOT to add the glaze until the cookies are almost completely cooled.  The glaze just kinda melts into them if too warm.  End result, a pretty and festive looking cookie.

Fantastic.....the only thing I did different was to add a full tsp. of pure almond extract instead of the 1/2 tsp. I did need to add a little bit more milk also to the glaze to make a nice drizzling consistancy. Family loved these cookies, very pretty and flavorful.

This recipe is the EXACT cookie recipe from Land O Lakes Butter recipe site (which is also posted on this website). The only difference is the glaze measurements.  I've been making this for the past few holiday seasons.  It's a very delicate cookie but very good.

I have made this recipe numerous times over the years and they are amazing.  Everyone always raves about them and talks about them months (and even years) later.  I follow the recipe exactly except I use strawberry jam due to preferrence.  I also use a Pampered chef small cookie scoop to help make them perfectly round.  Seriously, this is probably the most popular recipe I have ever made.

I'm not sure if the dough would make a great thumbprint cookie but as a sugar cookie it's really good.  It spread alot before it got golden and the jam turned more candy-like when eaten.    Overall this recipe is good but not great.  I will try the addition of flour as other reviewers has suggested and revise this review. In the meantime it's just 3 stars.

These are the best cookies ever!  I used vanilla extract with strawberry and pineapple preserves.  The back of a rounded measuring teaspoon works perfectly for the thumbprint.

These ended up being not at all what I was looking for, but delicious all the same.  I added an egg and bumped up the flour by 1/4 C.  I took them out after 10 minutes and they were perfect.

Dee, thanks for a great recipe.  I made these for Christmas last year and people inhaled them!  I wait to pipe the glaze (keep it thick) unti the cookies/jam are cool; otherwise, it just gets absorbed into the hot cookie/jam.  These freeze really nicely as well.

My officemates requested that I bake cookies for our boss' despedida merienda. I searched this site for a unique cookie recipe that was easy to make and I thought I'd give this one a try.  I baked a trial batch (18 pcs)and since I didn't have any raspberry jam at home, I used blueberry, strawberry, and apple cinnamon jams.    I also twice the amount of milk for the glaze. They were a hit with my boyfriend and my officemates.

Great cookies.  I made these and several other cookies last year for a cookie exchange.  This is the only recipe I'm re-using this year. I may reduce the almond extract a little as it was very strong.

These are nice sweet treats.  Mine did crack a little, but they still looked good.  I added 1/4c more flour and baked at 340 for 20 minutes.  Very pretty and tasty.

This is a very good cookie.  I made it twice.  The first time, I followed the directions exactly and the cookie lost its shape and swallowed the jam.  The second time, I refrigerated the cookie after shaping it and it baked up great.  Will make again.

These cookies are AWESOME!!! My mother in law is diabetic, and I have made these several times. I subtitute Splenda for the sugar and sugar-free preserves for the jam, and they are just wonderful! They come out perfect every time. Thank you for sharing the recipe! They also look very pretty on a holiday tray!

AWESOME AWESOME..do use a chapstick or something similar to make your indention.      And chill the dough for about 20-30 minutes to prevent spreading.  They look better that way.  I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of milk to the glaze.  These are a keeper

Wonderfull, these are the best and so easy to make. I used a little vanilla and almond, left off the icing, it's excellent with out it. What I always do when trying a new recipe is just put about 3 cookies  in the oven at first to see how they turn out. It's better to make temp, changes, size of cookie etc. with just a couple  than a whole pan full. You really should try these and they stay nice and moist for quite a while. Thank you for shareing.

Delicious cookies.  Recipe needed salt, I added 1/8 tsp.  As suggested, this dry dough also needed 1 egg yolk to hold it together better.  The almond extract and homemade raspberry jam absolutely made these cookies sing.

Excellent recipe! These cookies have become a family favorite, and the recipe is sooooo easy anyone can make them.  I've made these cookies for parties and family gatherings.  I like to make "colorful" batches, by using raspberry, blackberry/blueberry, and apricot jams.  You can use almost any flavored jam and the cookies will taste great.

So pretty and oh my gosh...YUM YUM! I made these with a friend for Christmas and when I saw her at work the next day she said OH MY GOSH! THOSE ARE SO GOOD!" EVERYONE that eats them LOVES THEM! They are addicting! Once you eat one, you can't stop! My whole family is coming over for New Year's Eve and my brother in law requested these cookies. I found that I had to make the little dough balls TEENIE TINY to make the recipe stretch. If you want to make allot, double the recipe.

Update - EVERY TIME we make these people RAVE about them and say "Those were THE BEST cookies! Can I have the recipe?" They are the best!!!

My cookies didn't look NEARLY as nice as any of the photos of this recipe. My first thought when I took the first batch out of the oven was that I was going to give it a bad review because they looked so...well...not pretty! But as soon as I tasted them I knew it was a 5 star recipe!!!!! I think these might be the best cookies I've ever made! I skipped the glaze (too much trouble) and discovered that by NO stretch of the imagination could you get 36 cookies if you rolled the dough into 1 1/2 inch balls. AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. BUT.... I got about 20 cookies from the recipe (dough rolled into 1+ inch balls) and they are so good that I'm not complaining. I'll definitely make this again! FABULOUS!!!!!!!! (I'd give it more than 5 stars if that was an option!)

Yummy! I took the advice of another user and used the back of my chapstick to make a hole and it works perfect! You can always make the hole bigger by swirling the chapstick in circles.

I use vanilla instead of almond, and whatever jam I have handy - I have given these out at Christmas and enjoyed them in the summertime, they're so easy to make.  I have made these so often - thanks, Dee!!!

Very nice recipe. For half of the recipe, I dipped rolled ball in an egg wash, and then in coconut, then pressed a dent in the cookie, and added jam. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Dee!!!

WOW.  I make lots of cookies and have to say that this is one of the best recipes I've ever made.  It is:
1).  Easy--most homes have the ingredients on hand.
2).  Tasty.  VERY good flavor combinations and the texture is perfect.
3).  Beautiful.  The cookies look like miniature Danishes!
4).  Versatile.  I used cherry, raspberry and strawberry jam and each was unique and delicious.  As others have reported, you could also use chocolate to glaze, substitute vanilla for the almond, or use frosting to fill.
One of my all-time favorites!

This is an absolute crowd-pleaser. I've made these cookies year after year for Christmas, and everyone insists I continue! They're easy and worth the effort. However, you will need way more milk than the icing recipe calls for. It's easy to guess as you stir, though.

Excellent!  Loved by all in my home.  I substituted a half and half mix of vanilla and almond extract in both the cookie and the glaze instead of using the almond extract at full strength.  My almond hating daughter was none the wiser and the rest of us still enjoyed a hint of almond flavor.

I used two tablespoons of the flour for cornstarch. They turned out great. I also used unsalted butter even though it doesn't call for it. Best to chill the dough for sure and really don't over do it with the preserves - it will go all over if you over fill. 1/2 cup is plenty for the recipe. The hole you make for the preserves should be small but deep but not so deep it touches the bottom of the cookie sheet. Fill that with preserves but don't let it mound up at all with jam or you'll be cleaning that off your cookie sheet and oven probably. I used the end (cleaned) of a chap stick tube like another reviewer suggested and that worked well.

These cookies were delicious!  I should just mention that you might want to put some extra milk into the icing--there is no way 1 tsp. is enough.  Maybe 1.5 tsp?

This is a yummy cookie! It looks pretty too. The jam is definitely a great alternative to candied cherries. I found the 1 1/2 inch balls made too big a cookie, so we made them about 1 inch. We also found the almond extract a bit overpowering so we didn't put any in the icing and just added more milk.

These were lovely little jewels -- used vanilla instead of almond extract.  I also used cherry, raspberry and apricot jams.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar.  My only complaint is that they flattened.  Maybe next time I will refrigerate the dough.

These were very, very good.  Be very careful not to overcook them, however.  Also, with the icing: for some reason, mine was just a lot of crumble.  I had to use about a tablespoon of milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract to make it runny enough for a glaze.  And for the thumbprints, I wouldn't press your thumb flat on top of it.  Try doing an upside-down thumbs-up, and stick your thumb in tip-first.  One more thing: the dough has to be at an almost specific temperature to be easy to work with.  For me, it was letting it sit in the fridge for a couple hours, taking it out, and microwaving for 15 seconds.

This was my first recipie that I've tried from this awesome website, and I used it as part of my Christmas baking.  What a hit!  The cookies were the first ones eaten, and the ones most often complimented out of a cookie assortment provided by three different bakers!  It seems the recipe is pretty versitile as well... I used Boysenberry jam instead of Raspberry and I also glazed some of them and left some without glaze... it didn't effect the cookie's wonderful flavor either way.  This cookie will be a permanent addition to my recipe file.

Great cookie!  Really delicious and very easy.  I had a problem with the glaze though.  I added more milk for easier consistency and I waited until cookies were cool to prevent drizzled glaze from spreading all over the cookie.  If you're new to baking (like me) this is an awesome recipe!

Of the seven cookies I made for Christmas, this was the only one of which I made a second batch.
These were so tasty.
My only difficulty was getting the cookie bottom not to burn.
I used powdered confectioner's sugar and doubled the milk for the icing.  Yummy.

These were wonderful and I made them as recommended except I did briefly chill the dough prior to rolling into balls and putting the raspberry preserves in the middle. These made about 21 total for me and disappeared immediately. The cookies are truly delicious and were not flat but nice and full.

I've made these cookies about four times now and they will definitely remain in my holiday rotation. They also make nice gifts.

I've been making my own jam by boiling whatever fruit I have on hand  (raspberries but also blackberries and even clementines) with sugar and a bit of pectin if necessary. I never knew how easy this was. 

I make the dough balls about 2 tsp. size and have not had any problem using my thumb to make the indentation, unlike some other reviewers have said. I usually do go back and reshape them a bit to make sure the jam has a sturdy well. 

Once I fill them with jam I freeze them a bit before baking but I'm not sure this is necessary. Use a ziplock to pipe the icing if you want them to look the pictures!

I made these last night after reading several reviews I used a dark pan also put the batter in the refrigerator for a half an hour. I  couldn't bring myself to not add an egg yolk , as this recipe did not show egg ? They came out perfect !! did not go flat !! texture was wonderful and tender !! They are our favorite cookie now !!

Made this recipe with a few minor changes. I did not soften the butter, as someone else suggested. I have some fantastic tropical flavoured jams that I picked up at a Farmers Market so instead of raspberry jam, I use mango jam for half the batch and guava jam for the other half.....turned out amazing.

I've made these cookies twice, the first time using raspberry jam and the second time using boysenberry preserves.  Both times they were delicious.  Nice thing about the recipe is the flexibility in that different jams or jellies can be used depending on your preference.

made exactly according to the recipe with delicious results.  I suggest chilling the dough before baking if you are worried about them flattening, which was not a problem for me.

The best  I've ever made. When I make two dozen of these they never last long. I mean longer than a day. My husband says compliments to the Baker and I give compliments to whoever posted this recipe. It's a hit plan on doing this many times.

Flavor wise these are 5 star. However you MUST refrigerate the thumbprints before placing in oven. I made 2 batches.. 1st tray put in oven just like recipe States.. And low and behold, flat ugly cookies. Just like many reviewers have stated. I am a seasoned baker so I knew what I was gonna get.. But i was just making some of these for my own family so didn't care too much about appearance. The second tray I placed in fridge for about 15 mins before baking.. These ones came out much like the profile picture.. Round, puffy, and more appealing. I garnished mine with a white chocolate drizzle. 
May make again.. But they have to be refridgeted first!

These tasted wonderful, however mine spread out all over the cookie sheet and came out totally flat, so they didn't look anything like the ones in the photo.  It didn't prevent our eating them however,  really delicious!

A huge success! I've made it 3 times and everyone has loved them and wanted the recipe. 
You can add more almond extract if you fancy. 
I am going to try them with gluten free flour and will update as to how they turn out.

This are amazing! For the glaze, I used powdered sugar, almond extract, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. It provided a tart flavor to balance out the sweetness of the jam.

I made them just the way the recipe called for except... I made them smaller as per the other suggestions.  I also used the chapstick lid idea, it worked well.  I did not refrigerate them before cooking.  I did not soften the butter too much. They came out perfect -  just like the picture!

I've only made them twice, but when I made them I followed a few tips and experimented. I think they turned out great.(1.) It didn't matter when I subbed the almond extract with vanilla, the taste was a little bit better with almond, but if you don't have almond extract don't sweat it.(2.) After you make the dough and put it on the pan, chill it for 10 minutes, then put it in the oven. (3.) Turn the temperature down 10 degrees, and cook about 4 minutes longer. There are other helpful tips from other reviewers and I just picked out what worked for me, and what I had to do to make them the best I could!

Best shortbread cookie ever! I messed up the ingredients the first time I made these so I ended up using half white sugar, half confectioner sugar in the cookie. I added 1/4 cup or so of flour based on other reviewers and the cookies didn't flatten out. The cookies turned out crisp on the edges, buttery -be tasty everywhere else and perfect w jam. I always use half confectioner sugar and have had repeated success.

I did as another reviewer suggested and used the back of my 1/2 teaspoon to make the indentions in the cookies before adding the filling and then placed them in the freezer for about 20 minutes before cooking. They came out perfectly! They didn't even spread! I made half from red raspberry  preserves and strawberry for the other half.

I made these over the Christmas break and they are great. Not too sweet, but perfect balance with the raspberry. I just had to add a little extra milk to the powdered sugar, almond extract to make it thinner and easier to drizzle. I also placed the batter in fridge before assembling and had no problems with cookies holding shape or raspberry running.

These are the best cookies ever! Be sure to not melt the butter! This will make them flat. Chill the dough and use a chapstick to make the hole.... makes it deeper for more filling!! Do not sub anything for the almond extract.... it will ruin them.

BEST cookie recipe and EVERYONE loved it!  I was told how this cookie was a "bakery style cookie", "nailed it!" "better than a bakery cookie" were a few comments after trying this delicious cookie.  This will forever now be part of my holiday cookie making and collection! THANK YOU FOR SHARING such a fabulous recipe!

These were fabulous.  This was the first time I made shortbread and thumbprints and they turned out great.  I only got 24 but no issues with the pan being messy. I rolled into balls using a melon baller and pushed the center with my index finger.  I used blackberry seedless jam and filled with a baby spoon.  I put them in the freezer for 10 min prior to cooking and they were absolutely delicious. Wouldn't change a thing!!

I settled on about half a dozen dessert recipes for Christmas form this website and these were by far the biggest hit! Everyone raved about them.   I followed the following comments I read and they worked out PERFECTLY.  1) Roll the balls very small, size of a quarter 2) I placed the balls on the cookie sheet and put the sheet into the fridge for 20 mins 3) I used a chapstick tube to make the indentations and filled them with cold jam.  They kept their exact shape even though some of the cookies were cracked when I put them in the stove and I thought for sure they would run.....they didn't.

These turned out delicious! Although it wasn't advised, I did sub vanilla extract for almond extract, just because that's what I had on hand. However, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour as suggested in another comment and they turned out great! Awesome shortbread and awesome recipe, it was a hit!

I loved these. I followed 3 of 4 of Marcie J's suggestions for non-flat cookies. My butter was already softened so I didn't use cold butter, cubed as suggested by her. I did lower the oven temp by 10 degrees,  added 1/4 cup flour and put my pans with cookie dough and jam in the freezer for 10 minutes before popping them in the oven. 
They turned out great!  Nice plump little cookies. Very tasty:) This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Unbelievably delicious and perfect recipe as is.  The almond extract is a must since it gives it a subtle delicate almond flavor that adds dimension to the cookie.  You can't just eat one and they are sinfully buttery and tangy at the same time.  I used raspberry and also sour cherry jam.  I preferred the cherry jam cookies since its tartness gave a yummy contrast between the sweet and the buttery flavors.  The recipe was so easy and we made the holes larger to put more jam in them.  We put the cookies in the refrigerator for a 5-10 minutes and they turned out better and prettier.  I doubled the recipe and 3 days later, there isn't any left over for Christmas tomorrow.   My entire family adored them.  I will be making them again now for the guests coming over which was my original purpose!

These were amazing and easy! Only thing I did differently was that I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour,  added a tsp of vanilla and increased the almond extract to a full tsp.

Ok, I made these twice, first time followed the recipe and it was a melted disastrous mess. Then I read the tips, used chilled butter and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, reduced heat to 325°. Perfection!! Then quick dusting of powdered sugar, added Grand Marnier to glaze to kick it up a notch and then topped with sliced almonds. To die for!!

This recipe is really very good.  I used vanilla extract as other commenters suggested, and a 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the recipe, just a hint.  The chap stick idea is a great one.  Delicious cookies

These turned out great! I listened to another reviewer and added 1/4 cup extra flour so the cookies wouldn't flatten. It worked! I also used blackberry instead of raspberry filling. Very pretty and very tasty! Will definitely make these again.

Turned out great. I did put the tray in the refrigerator for a few minutes before baking, only second time I've baked cookies. Everyone loved these cookies so I made them again.

I use this recipe all the time for receptions, showers and special events. I have found to not use chilled jam as it will cause a flat cookie. As well as cooking too long will cause a flat cookie. Keeping with the lower time of 14 minutes & following the directions will result in a fluffy cookie as the picture shown. One of my favorites to bake & eat.

These are the most delicious cookies, so buttery tasting.  I made them exactly as written but I used my small cookie scoop and my mini muffin pan.....using the "chap stick trick", they came out beautifully.  I didn't use the glaze, just sprinkled them with a little powdered sugar. They make a beautiful gift.

These might be one of my favorite cookies!Mmm buttery goodness! So simple and delicious! TIP: after imprinting the dough with your thumb, put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes then fill with jelly and bake. They help keep it's shape better more like the picture. ??

My son has a food allergy so I had to use vanilla.  My cookies came out perfect!  I rolled them into balls (about 1 - 1 1/2 inches) and make the indent using the back of a melon scoop sprayed with some Pam.  I also added some variety using blueberry and strawberry preserves in addition to raspberry.  Everyone raved about these cookies!  This is the second year I've used this recipe, it is now a staple in my Christmas cookies.

Used half margarine and half butter.  Used blueberry preserves, peach preserves as well as the raspberry.  Sifted confectioners on top instead of the drizzle frosting.  They taste better if they get just a hint of brown around the edges while baking.  Had no problems with spreading or getting messy while baking.  Used the half teaspoon on measuring spoons to make the indent.  They were perfect.

Follow the recipe and you will have no trouble making the perfect little bites of heaven. If you like, you can substitute margarine for butter with no problems.  I have even used 2 chocolate chips in the middle instead of jam.  They are perfect every time.

Um, it's insane how delicious these cookies are!  I used blackberry jam this time and am excited to try other jam flavors.   I was nervous at first because many people reported their cookies going flat and winding up with a messy jam situation the first try and I was out of parchment paper! Fortunately, followed a lot of the great advice from other reviewers and had no problem.  I made the indentations using a chapstick cap and piped the jam in using a baggie snipped at the corner.  Then chilled the cookies for 10-15 min in the fridge before putting them in the oven.  For some reason I was hesitant to use the icing, I thought it would be over kill or something, and only iced half of the cookies.  But I will not make that mistake again!  The icing is a fantastic addition!  The only thing I would do differently in the future is roll the dough balls a little bit smaller for a better jam:cookie ratio.

At the last minute my daughter needed cookies for a class project.  I was out of almond extract (used vanilla) and the powdered sugar and they turned out pretty good.  I followed MarcieJ's (dec '06 review) and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, chilled for at least 10 minutes and they turned out nice & fat. I had a tray of dough in the fridge (for 20 mins) as I ran out of room in the freezer and they turned out a bit flat and the jam didn't contain as well. ;0(  My 9 y/o son who helped with the rolling and indenting (used the cap of the extract) now wants these for his class holiday party.  Going back to the store for more supplies.

I really enjoyed these cookies, made them with raspberry and apricot. Next time I won't do the drizzle, it was just a little too sweet with it.

Fantastic!!!  Made these for our cookie exchange (2014).  I think it's gonna be a hit (This is now 2015 and it was).  They melt in your mouth.  I also made these for my Dad.  I made sure to use seedless jam for him and he absolutely loved them.  

Gonna make these cookies for Dad again this year.

I have made these before but had a different recipe that called for egg yolks. 

I substituted vanilla extract for almond because I didn't realize I had no almond extract. If you do this for the glaze, only add about 1/8 tsp of vanilla otherwise, it's WAY too overpowering, I also found I needed to add more milk until I got the correct glaze consistency.

OVerall this  recipe is nice because it's less ingredients and healthier. I did add crushed almonds to the cookie dough and on top of the jam before baking which I would do again. Great flavor.

I have made these for a few years now and everybody raves about them. The only thing I have changed is the drizzle. I melt white chocolate and drizzle that instead. Its much less messy and easier to pack and it tastes great. Susan T

I make these cookies every Christmas and  everyone loves them. This is a very delicate cookie dough to work with, so if you are looking for quick and easy, you might want to pass this one by. But I think they are well worth the tiny bit more effort than your simple drop cookie, and the taste is phenomenal! For best results with this cookie, first have the mindset that they will be a bit more effort to make, but will be well worth it. Then, add up to 1/4 cup more flour to the recipe. Shape into balls carefully and place on cookie sheet. Make your indents and fill not quite to the top with jam. When finished, place the sheet in the fridge for about 15 minutes to get the dough nice and chilled. While this batch is chilling, make your next batch on another cookie sheet - no wasted time. :) Then bake chilled cookies as directed, watching carefully. These cookies do not and should not brown on top. When drizzling your glaze, have fun with it! It doesn't matter if it looks just like the ones in the picture - be creative and drizzle them in a way that is fun and pleasing to you. A little extra effort is well worth it with these delicious, tender cookies. And go ahead and play around with jam flavors. I love the raspberry, but I also make this with strawberry, cherry and apricot jams. Delicious!!

I tried several different recipes to know which we were making for Christmas this year. This is a definite one. I followed other reviews and refrigerated the dough and used the chapstick for indentions and they turned out perfect.

These are easy and delicious cookies! I placed the cookie batter in the fridge for 1 hour prior to baking. Otherwise followed exactly. Did not have a problem with crumbly dough. I rolled into balls and then pushed down my 1/4 tsp bottom to create a small dent in the center to fill with with the jam. I baked for less time than directions called for. Like sugar cookies, you don't really want this to brown on the bottom or they will be hard.

This recipe was fantastic they tasted amazing. A little tip make sure there are no cracks in the cookie because the jam spilled out of the cracks while it was baking but some of them were ok.

Very, very good!  I love that they only have 4 ingredients for the dough.  I made them with apricot preserves and they were delicious.  Needed to make more of the glaze, so I would increase those ingredients to 1.5X.  I also had to add more milk to make it the consistency I wanted.  They look so pretty and taste so buttery.  Great cookie to make as a gift!

I halved this recipe, which yielded 20 cookies with my 1 tbsp scoop, the cookies baked in 16 minutes. I omitted the almond extract due to allergies and replaced with 1 tsp vanilla, I also used apricot jam instead of raspberry. These were a big hit with my Uncle and the nurses at the hospital.

Simple and delicious.  I have made them many times and people always rave.  I use whole wheat pastry flour and freezer jam.  Skip the glaze, you don't need it.

Made these to round-out Christmas cookie tray. Very tasty, but a little more difficult to make- i am a novice so can use more practice. Like others recommended, used top of chapstick to make jelly holes- worked well- smaller/deeper wells were better than the ones i used my thumb with.  Also, if i overstuffed the cookie with jam or made wide holes,the cookies cracked & separated. Will drizzle glaze over cooler cookies next time to keep from disappearing

I meant to make these for Christmas, but never got around to it.  Believe me, I will next year! Made the exact cookie recipe and used melted white chocolate for the glaze.  Very light and delicate.  I used a small cookie scoop, refrigerated the dough about 10 minutes after scooping; hollowed the center with the chapstick cap(!) and squeezed a dab of seedless raspberry jam in the pockets.  Baked for 13". No seeping, no breaking.  Made about 4 dozen.

It lacked richness in flavor. The shortbreads were edible, looked presentable, but the taste was way to sugary and not very good.
Suggestion: 
Maybe very fine crumbled almonds or pecans in the dough could add for a better flavor? I am guessing: 1/2 cup of fine crumbled almonds + 1 cup of flour (instead of 2 cups of flour).

I made a trial batch using other reviewers comments. Added 1/2 cup flour and put them in the freezer for a few hours before baking (with the raspberry jam in them). They turned out amazing! My husband would not stop eating them, I had to make two more batches. Took them to Christmas Eve and had multiple requests for the recipe. Sitting on a table full of other desserts, they were gone in minutes.

With this recipe, I've just discovered a new FAVORITE! These are so easy to make, it really surprises you at first!  And they are fabulous. They taste like they came from the finest bakery. And they're very pretty.  I used 100% natural, high quality, preserves: Cranberry Marmalade, English Apricot and Raspberry preserves.  All were really delicious.  I rolled the dough into the full recommended inch and a half balls.  I used the class shaped/standard 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to make my indentations for the jam.  No spreading. No leaking. Just enough jam/preserves for great flavor and a beautiful cookie.  And perfectly round even indentation.  An incredible recipe and a hit with everyone.  Rich buttery taste. Old fashioned. I will make time and again! Thank you.

These are my new favorite Christmas cookies.  I'd advise chilling the dough for about an hour, making 1 inch balls rather than 1 1/2", and using the end of a big wooden spoon, chapstick end, or 1/2 inch dowel to make the indentation. Be sure to use parchment paper; it helps them brown properly and prevents sticking. I used a sandwich bag for the jam, squeezing it through a snipped-off corner. I'd also double the batch, because they're popular and they freeze well. Don't substitute vanilla for the almond extract; it makes a difference.

I am baking my cookies as I write my review.  The dough was nice to work with.  I didn't have any problem with crumbling.  I didn't soften the butter too much before starting.  I didn't feel the need to change the recipe by adding more flour or changing the oven temp.  Really glad I didn't.  The shortbread is BEAUTIFUL on the tongue!  So flaky and buttery.  I used the almond extract lid to make a dent in the tsp. sized balls of dough.  I baked for 14 minutes and then put the jam in immediately after baking with a baby spoon.  EASY PEEZY!  I used Smuckers raspberry, but any flavor you like best would be great!  I highly recommend making the recipe as is.  On my next batch I'm putting them jam in while baking to see if it's just as easy.  Thanks so much!

These are absolutely fabulous!  Made them exactly as written, except refrigerated each batch about 15 minutes before baking. Used raspberry, blueberry and apricot jams. Next batch, going to add Nutella. Yum!
If you are making these for someone else, plan on baking an extra batch for yourself- they're that good!

i've made this cookie a few times over the years using regular raspberry jam and raspberry filling specifically for baking.  the one for baking made a huge difference and didn't bubble over at all.  i added one egg yolk this year, and the cookie didn't spread as much as in previous years.  i also molded the cookies first and then refrigerated the dough before filling and baking.  i like it best with vanilla extract for the icing, almond for the cookie.  i put the icing in a zip lock baggie and cut a tiny hole in the corner to drizzle on the cookies.  these cookies are a HUGE hit at the dessert table!!  don't be intimidated by the multi-step process if you're an amateur baker.  they really aren't difficult, at all.  enjoy!!

Don't soften the butter.
Chill the filled cookies before baking.
Use a chapstick cap to make indentations for jam.

These cookies were great! They turned out just like they look in the picture. Everyone that tried them wanted the recipe, even the men that had them. I made them 4 times this year already. I tried different jams, some I liked and some I didn't like as much. Try these they are wonderful and easy.

I printed this recipe years ago and have been making it since.  It is wonderful.  the only change I make is that I do not add the glaze.  They are delicious without it.  After the cookies cool, store them in an airtight container and they keep very well for days!  Good make ahead cookie.

These cookies are Great!   I don't bake and they came out wonderfully!  Did read the reviews and refrigerated them before baking.  Came out just like the picture and tasted wonderful!    They were so good I forgot the glaze but didn't need it!

Awesome.  I substituted vanilla for almond extract in dough, and rasberry extract for almond In drizzle.  Rolled them in almond crumbs before filling and a powdered. I kept them verticle so wouldn't go flat.
Keep em high.  Freeze them whwn ready for ten minutes. Cooked at 340 for 16 min.

Lovely recipe! I didn't have a problem with messy jam because I used raspberry topping instead. It is a little less sweet than jam and also a little cheaper.

I made these exactly to recipe and they came out perfectly! They didn't flatten out, and the jam didn't run. I do think I made them twice as large as they should be though, because it only made 15 cookies and they're pretty big. I baked them for twice as long (about 30 minutes) and they came out nice and light brown with bubbly jam. I waited a bit too long to put the glaze on them, so the glaze was a bit hard to spread... I'd put the glaze on right after you take them off of the cookie sheet while they are still warm. Next time I think I would put a bit less almond flavor in the glaze, because it's a little overwhelming.

Followed the recipe exactly; after adding the second cup of flour the dough turned into the shape of peas. Trying to make balls I had to dip my fingers in water because the balls were falling apart. Trying to make the hole, the cracked and fell apart. Also after 18 minutes baking, not anywhere near done. I kept checking the recipe to see if I forgot something. Also, the icing. You cannot drizzle the icing with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and only 1 teaspoon of milk. I will never make these again!

I've been a huge fan of sweets that use almond extract, but (at least in the areas I grew up) they weren't widely available. These cookies taste fantastic, have a very light weight and texture (I sift my flour), and satisfy both my almond and raspberry cravings.

I did have to make one alteration - I need to use 1 TABLEspoon of milk for the drizzle portion, or I'd wind up with very sweet cement that didn't make it on to my cookies until I added more milk and popped it in the microwave to "melt" the hardened sweetness.

You DO have to use Almond Extract, and I highly recommend drizzling the frosting stuff on top (again, using the extract) as it helps with the flavor as well as making them look lovely.

They spread a good bit in the oven, but I had no problems with jam spreading and escaping the cookie surfaces - I just made sure the dips for them were deep enough, and didn't let it rise higher than the rim. One of my spatulas has a rounded end on the handle, I use that to form the dips.

The first couple of times, I got odd numbers of cookies - I've switched to splitting the finished dough into quarters and pinching off 8 cookies per quarter (adding and removing to make their sizes closer to equal) before rolling them into balls. It goes faster than pulling out a small chunk at a time and then looking at a lot of different sized dough spheres on the cookie sheet.

First thing, these are GREAT! Now for the rest. Read a lot of reviews and here's what I did to get these perfect. Used ingredients as listed no more no less.  I DID NOT use the icing and I'm glad I didn't as these have a taste you do not want to cover up. After mixing up the dough I did stick the dough in the refridge for about 10 minutes. Dough will be crumbly but the heat of your hands rolling out the balls will make everything OK.  Fixed two cookie sheets (got 24 cookies total out of this)and after putting the raspberry filling on I put the trays back in the refridge for another 10 minutes. Because of this they took 19 minutes to cook. It's worth noting that the refridge time played a critical roll in the cookies retaining their shape. I used the end of a small juicer for the depression in the cookies and as a couple of folks suggested put the jam in a sandwich baggie, cut a very small corner off the bag and squeezed the filling out into the cookie depression.  Works really well.  Don't wait for Christmas to fix these...get in there now and fire up the oven!

My 6yr old daughter says, "We really liked it a lot! Because the cookie comes all together with the nice sweet flavour of the jelly!" We watch a lot of food network together, hah hah.
Really great recipe. So simple to do and tastes GREAT! My 6yr old basically did this recipe on her own. After the cookies were formed and filled, I did put it in the freezer for 15min to re-harden the dough (the balls were a little warm from too much rolling). No issues with the cookie falling flat in the oven. Ingredients were not changed. Texture was crumbly and cookie, delicious.

I have to give it 5 stars because everyone went nuts over these.  Made a double batch for Christmas.  Don't think I altered anything in the recipe except when I was running out of icing into the second batch, I got lazy and just mixed powdered sugar and milk omitting the almond extract.  I do think it's "almondy" enough.  These are wonderful and way easier than making Kolackys which are similar.  People mistook these for kolackys. :) Will definitely be making these again and again.

These are so simple to make! I looked over the recipe quick and printed it out as I was in the middle of a holiday cookie baking marathon.  When I got to the kitchen I almost thought the recipe was wrong, no eggs no baking powder or soda- 5 ingredients that's it!  I also suggest chilling the formed dough balls before cooking to help them not spread.  Yummmm!

This was absolutely wonderful and was enjoyed and devoured as quickly as it was set out.  We did substitute raspberry paste for raspberry jelly because the raspberry flavor is more concentrated and we like it much better.  Also, we put the raspberry paste into a zip lock bag and snipped off a small corner to fill the holes with no mess or overfilling.  This worked out beautifully, so we did the same thing with the glaze only with a smaller hole to add pretty stripes of glaze.  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

I have made these a few times now and they are so delicious! The first time I made them, I followed the most helpful review and added extra flour. Big mistake! Maybe that would work if you lived under water, but I live in a dry climate and ended up with a bowl of dry crumbs that I could not get to stick together no matter how much I tried. I has to add some water to get it to stick, it luckily they still turned out fine. Now I just follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great!

Yummy. Very easy recipe. Some of my taste tests it was hard to taste the preserves but it was still good. Did not add icing and it totally doesn't need it. Baked at about 335 instead of 350 for about 14 minutes.

Super yum. My husband loves these. I omitted 1/3 sugar and the glaze to make them less sweet. It was a definite hit with the family than my first batch. My first batch was exact according to recipe. Still very good just a touch too sweet

These cookies are delicious. I love the crumbly buttery texture. I agree with the other reviewers. Chill the dough before baking. I put it in the fridge for 15 minutes after I made it. Also, use a chapstick tube to make the indentations. It makes a little well that keeps the jam contained. Also, putting the jam in a plastic bag and squeezing it into the indentation is a very helpful tip. One comment I have is that I don't think the milk amount for the glaze is enough. I think it should be one tablespoon of milk. When I use the ratios as written the glaze was just crumbly. I had to add more milk to make it smooth. Overall, a delish recipe. Might be my new go-to recipe for X-mas cookie exchanges.

We love this recipe! It is an annual tradition in my home to make these around the holidays. I do switch up the jam this year it's TOE (tangerine, orange and elederberry) jam and Blueberry jam from a local mennonite shop.

Followed recipe exactly.  I did put the batter in the fridge to chill before baking them.  They turned out great.  This was such a easy recipe and oh so delicious.  Definitely a keeper

These were yummy. I love almond, so I increased the almond extract to 1 tsp. Dough was easy to work with, and the cookies came out perfect. They had a nice light crunch after they cooled, but by the next day, they had a softer crumb due to the moisture of the jam. I had stored them in a loose container, but maybe I should have left them uncovered altogether?

Love - love- love this recipe.  So simple and the shortbread cookie can be used in so many ways, not just for jam. I have made the cookie with no jam, have coated with chocolate...so many options. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

I made this exactly like the recipe, nothing different, and it came out exactly as it should and looked decadent.  I got fooled by the colour, shortbread is usually white so it always looks like it is not done as yet so be sure to follow the time.

Usually I don't think to make these cookies until Christmastime. I wonder why? This recipe has simple delicious ingredients. The jam makes them perfectly sweet while the shortbread melts in your mouth. I used a non-stick mini muffin pan dropping the dough into the wells after rolling into 1 inch balls. Making the dough balls smaller decreased the baking time to 9-11 minutes. After removing the tray from the oven I immediately made the "thumbprints" with the flip side of my pestle, floured. I let them cool in the pan. The cookies came out of the non-stick beautifully. Filled the wells with seedless raspberry jam and drizzled with the icing.

Why did I wait so long to make these....yumm! Fun and easy to make. Made as is except used vanilla extract instead of almond. To make the indents, I went through my kitchen drawers and found one of those infant/toddlers spoon medicine measuring device (spoon top w/ round bottom). Although, I think I went a little deep on the indents because while the cookies were baking, it stretched and the jams didn't quite fill in the hole. Or maybe I didn't fill enough or stick with the chapstick cap idea. I wanted to drizzle icing on them but the hungry people couldn't wait to taste.

Great flavor and easy to make! I used cherry pie filling at my husband's request and they came out great! I used a previous reviewer's suggestion of the chapstick to make the hole and it was wonderful!

I used boysenberry preserves (Trader Joe's) instead of raspberry, vanilla extract instead of almond, and omitted the glaze. I didn't have the problem with the cookies spreading like other users have experienced. All of my friends loved them! One even said it was the best cookie I've ever made. I want to try using other fillings. I saw a recipe in a random blog with dulce de leche filling with a chocolate drizzle. I think that will be my next attempt at these

I use the cap off of the vanilla extract bottle to ensure a consistent, perfectly round indentation for the jam filling, makes the cookies look professional. This is a tasty recipe as written, but also good with apricot preserves instead of raspberry.

I have yet to try these cookies, but I just took them out of the oven and they look like giant bloody eyeballs! Also, the jam spilled out on a few of them, which was my fault. I also skipped the glaze. But, overall, they look more halloween appropriate than teacher appreciation week appropriate. I might change my mind after I try them, though!

Made these for a "High Tea" today.  I had 63 women telling me they were the best cookies they have ever tasted.  I did not even drizzle the icing since I had so many other things to do.  I used the Chapstick as someone suggested and it worked like a gem.  The cookies looked perfect.  Thanks a million.

We made them once with a white chocolate drizzle and another with the sugguested drizzle (confectioners' sugar, almond extract, and milk).  The homemade topping was so much better.  We used soy milk instead of milk but it still came out so tastilicious.

April2012:My family loves these cookies. I have a son with allergies to nuts so I sub vanilla for almond. Also to keep them from spreading I add a couple tblsp extra flour, lower the oven by 5 degrees and place the dough in the freezer while I wait for the oven to come up to temp! They are really great with apricot jam!
UPDATE may2016: I still use this as my go to recipes. Still sub vanilla for almond. When I'm done mixing the dough with a bit of extra flour and my oven is coming up to temp I roll the dough into a log and wrap in plastic wrap (usually making extra so I leave a couple logs in the freezer for another night). when my oven is to temp (5 degrees lower than recipes calls for) I cut my log into equal sized cookies and then no rolling out individual cookies required. Then make my dent and add my preserves. YUM YUM

Wow!! Quite possibly my favorite cookie of all time, and I just love how easy, quick, and the low amount of ingredients needed. I did press down the center a little too much on a few in the first batch and the jelly went through. The 2nd batch I pressed lighter and they came out great. And just a tip... space them apart enough or they'll run in together.

Great cookies! I had such a hard time putting the dough together so I took about a tsp of butter and rubbed with my hand and worked the dough. Chilling the dough definitely helps -- I chilled it before I shaped into small balls AND after I got them ready to be baked. I used jam, almond, and chocolate pieces for "topping" (of course not all together, my cookies were too small for even 1 tsp of jam. I used about 1/4 tsp of jam per cookies.). My family liked them all!

I made these for my dad because every Christmas, he tells us all about his grandma's thumbprints. They were dry and crumbly and overall, just not that good. My family LOVES Christmas cookies and usually devours anything, but these were still around on New Year's Day, so they got pitched. I really wanted this simple recipe to work, but it didn't, and needs some more of the classic shortbread ingredients.

Exactly what I was searching for! Big hit at an adult Christmas party as well as with the kids.  I wait until the cookie is thoroughly cooled before drizzling the sugar mix. A Wilton tip / bag worked better here than a Ziploc bag with the corner cut.  These disappear quickly, so make a second batch!!!

I followed the recipe except followed recommendations of others (for example I used butter straight from the refrig and didnt soften it, and also I put the dough in freezer before and after shaping into cookies). I didnt have any problem with cookies flattening at all. My problem only is that no one though cookies tasted good. I think I would take someone elses advice and use vanilla flavoring instead of almond...or find another recipe. Sorry....

Simple and delicious!
First attempt, cookies came out flat. Second attempt I rolled the cookies into the 1/2 inch balls which worked beautifully!  Allow the cookies to cool completely before drizzling the icing.  MMMM MMMM Good!

Yum! Easy to mix up and hard to put down! I do not possess great baking prowess, but I followed some of the hints from previous reviews and these were a big hit! Kept the balls small, used a lip-balm lid to make jam wells, chilled prior to baking, and was careful not to over-bake them, removing them from the oven when the edges barely began to brown. The only disappointment was that I ran out of ingredients and couldn't make a 3rd batch!

I'm glad this cookie worked out for some people. I was VERY disappointed in the outcome. They spread out everywhere and made nothing but a mess. I was not happy to waste all the ingredients. They spread out so much I didnt even let them finish baking. NEVER making again.

This is a really good cookie!!! Made it just as the recipe is written. I took some advice and chilled the dough in the fridge a bit before rolling the balls. Mine did flatten out some but there was not any jam spill over at all, I just filled the hole I made to the top and as the cookie spread the jam filled it nicely. This was the fastest cookie I have ever made, I made it for a cookie exchange and I had to bake over 90, it was fast!! Good luck not eating the dough before it is baked:) YUMMY!!!

Great combo of flavors with the almond, raspberry and shortbread. Recommend chilling the dough and making one inch rounds for a daintier and higher cookie. Needed to double the icing. Great for the holidays. Very showy for gift presentation.

I love these!  Made them as the recipe describes and they are delicate, they melt in your mouth and have  a rich buttery, almond flavor and then the raspberry just adds more flavor.. Excellent.

I absolutely love thumbprint cookies and shortbread, but I was very disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted like pure sugar, I couldn't even taste the butter. The texture was crumbly (like a shortbread) but not melt in your mouth (like a shortbread). I couldn't even finish 1 cookie before I threw it away, just because of the taste. My husband felt the same way. I'm no novice to baking, people love my baked goods and breads, so I'm assuming it was the recipe itself.

This cookie is awesome. The flavor is wonderful. Make sure the indention is big enough in the cookie and then I use and decorating bag, cut off the end of it to put the jelly in, it makes it easier and less mess. I also use a bag for the glaze. This is my number one selling cookie in my shop. Thank you for the recipe. There is no need to change anything, except a little more milk in the glaze. I'm gonna make them just plain next time, sure it will be just as good.

Super little cookie!  Just make sure you use a good jam to fill them with (I used a cheap apricot jam & they would have been so much better with a good jam).  I didn't add the drizzled icing as they were sweet enough as is.

My go to shortbread cookie! But for some reason this time they went flat.  Here is why.  When I got done I saw that I still had flour left in my measuring cup. So not only did I NOT add an extra 1/4 cup I excluded about 1/4 of a cup! They came out flat but delicate and delicious! I have made this with vanilla in the past and never went flat.  It was the flour...No doubt. I made another batch this morning, added the EXTRA 1/4 of a cup and they came out like they were supposed to.  Vanilla or Almond extract works fine.  FLOUR IS THE KEY.  Happy baking!!! Oh yea, I also reduced the sugar a tiny bit...the sweet from the raspberry is perfect.

I had trouble making these round, they tended to look like playdoh globs. (probably my fault!) So what I did was poured all the dough onto parchment paper lining in the cookie sheet, then slapped another piece of parchment paper on top and rolled them to about 1/4 an inch thick. then i cut them into squares (about 1 1/2 inch) and pushed my thumb into them to make an oval impression. hold the edge side opposite your thumb and they should retain their nice shape. Filled it with a little glob of jam - mine didnt spread, publix brand raspberry seedless. As a finisher, I drizzled white chocolate over the whole batch in thin stripes. They look lovely and knock your socks off.

These little babies are so delicious! I used salted butter bc that's all I had on hand although I usually always use unsalted but you couldn't taste the saltiness at all, I used my homeade strawberry jam that I make in the summer on half of the cookies and then a sugar free storebought black cherry jam on the other half. I made the dough, shaped into 40 quarter sized balls and put them on a parchment paper lined sheet tray, I made indents with a chapstick like others had advised and baked them 12 minutes. Oh, I also used one Cup ap flour and one cup cake flour which I really think made a difference. Next time I make these I will make deeper indentations and double the glaze recipe bc th first batch only covered half of my cookies. I ended up having to add a little more jam to each cookie after they baked bc there wasn't enough but that wasn't a big deal. They were buttery and soft with just enough crisp. So good! For such a little cookie these little sweeties sure pack a lot of flavor! I will definetly be making these again.

I made these to go in my Christmas goody gift bags for staff & clients.  Oh my gosh.  These little things are good.  They're tender & literally melt in your mouth.  I was thinking that the raspberry wouldn't be that good, but OH MY GOODNESS...amazing.  Everyone raved about them!

These cookies were ok, I've had much better shortbread cookies. I followed the recipe and these cookies held their shape. They did not spread like others wrote and I was hoping they would spread. To make them taste better I dipped them in chocolate. That worked wonders.

I did not care for this recipe. I cannot figure out how people made this. I chilled the dough. Added 1/4 cup extra flour. Only used real butter. The cookies spread EVERYWHERE. They didn't hold their shape at all. I'm never making this again.

The Danish side of my family love these cookies!!!  Easy and delicious.  Before baking them I put them in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up, otherwise they fall flat while baking (happened to me last week.)  This recipe is a keeper! Thank you:)

A great holiday cookie. As I have a child that is allergic to all nuts, I exchanged vanilla extract for the almond extract. This turned out just fine. I also make homemade strawberry jam, so used it instead of raspberry. Wonderful cookie. Tasted fantstic and looked beautiful, too.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!  Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the ones in the picture (they cracked a little), but they tasted awesome.  This recipe is definitely one of my favorites and will be a regular in my Christmas cookie making.  Thanks for the great recipe!  P.S.  I needed to add more milk in the glaze.

These were delicious - easy- made from pantry items and looked so pretty on my Christmas cookie trays!  I had leftover pastry fruit filling so I divided the dough in 3 portions.  I added lemon extract to the lemon curd cookies, Almond extract to the cherry and vanilla to the apricot cookies.  Will make again!

These were yummy and everyone at work LOVED them! I took the others reviewers advice and froze the cookies prior to baking. I still managed to have them look a little messy, but with the dizzle, you could hardly tell.

These are excellent! First time making thumbprint cookies and I made some mistakes. On batch 3 in 5 days and love them. Do listen to the yield - 36 cookies for the recipe... balls slightly smaller than described. Make balls, add hole (I use the flat end of a wine stopper), reform cracked edges if necessary, refrigerate for 10 minutes, fill with 1/4 TSP heated jam (I used boysenberry), don't overcook! I drizzled with bittersweet chocolate chips melted with a dab of butter. Perfect!

Super-easy and absolutely delicious!  I agree with CuppaTeaGirl; add the jam after they've baked for best results and you'll have no need to modify recipe or worry about cracks or running.  A holiday favorite, thank you!

These were delicious and easy to make.  I did not add more flour as others did and had no problem with the dough until the last few cookies - I think the dough had warmed up too much because they spread quite a bit and were very unattractive.  But the rest were fine!  I ended up using a teaspoon measuring spoon (very round, bowl-shaped) to make the indentations, and I found stirring up the preserves made it easier to fill the cookies.  Great cookie!

I wouldn't add more flour, as this made the dough really difficult to shape into balls despite chilling as well as possibly causing the cookie to taste like pie crust made with shortening.  Use a good quality jam.

These are really delicious. I chilled the dough for 20 minutes after forming the cookies and that helped them not to spread. Also, make them small - they won't spread that way.

Made only 1 modification, added an additional 1/4 cup flour to help keep the dough from spreading too much. Worked perfectly!  The cookies were great, not too sweet.

This is a keeper!  I used home made strawberry jam & raspberry jam as filling.  The raspberry jam was the best it tasted like Fisher's Scones!  Thank you for the best cookie recipe!

FANTASTIC!!!!  These were so good!  I did put them in the freezer for about 7 minutes so they would not spill over the sides and that worked.  Mine don't look quite like the picture, probably need a bigger cookie scooper so I can make a bigger indentation.  But they taste great!

These cookies are divine!  A new favorite for the Holidays at our house.  Made no changes, except to add a little more milk for the glaze.  I added a slivered almond before baking for presentation.  I took the advice of another member and refrigerated them between batches and they did not spread as much and rose beautifully.  My batch yielded 46 petite cookies.  UPDATE!!  WARNING.  Do not use an air bake cookie sheet.  My last bach still wasn't brown on the bottom after 20 minutes.  Use a traditional sheet.

Follow the tips below.  Chill dough before forming and before baking.  AA battery is the right size for the center.  Vanilla or Almond extract is personal preference. A baggie with a clipped corner fills the cookies perfectly.

Just made these cookies and they're great, Had 3 of them within 10 minutes. Although I subtracted one star because of the inconsistency of the glaze recipe. Needs WAY more liquid to make the confect. sugar a glaze than stated. I just eyeballed more milk and almond extract (about 1/4 a teaspoon at a time each) to make it the right consistency. Other than that the recipe is perfect and I followed it as is. I didn't think I'd like a shortbread cookie nor have I ever made one but this recipe had so many positive reviews and looked so simple and w/ ingredients that I basically always have on hand that I had to try it. I don't think one has to worry about the "seedless" part in the raspberry jam thing. I used red raspberry preserves (with seeds) and they still turned out great. Used a home-made ziplock bag piper to make the distributing of the preserves into the thumbprints easier. Speaking of thumbprints. I followed the instruction of many reviews and chilled the dough before rolling into balls which I then "thumbprinted" with the end of my oxo good grips 4 1/2 inch santoku knife. some cracked while making the indentions but I kinda formed them back into a full circle so I wouldn't have any leakage. Also bake for the amount of time stated. Mine took 16 mins exactly. They still look a little too softish even though they're done but don't worry, the harden a bit when they're cooled.

These cookies turned out great for me. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 c flour and 1 egg and used cold butter (1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine).   I chilled the dough and used a scoop to scoop it. Put 1/8 t jam in each and then I drizzled chocolate on top- -they taste great!

Yummy!  These are beautiful, easy, and delicious!  My kids loved them!  I used vanilla extract instead of almond b/c I didn't have almond and I thought the kids might like them that way.  I was right!  Big hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!! I used Baker brand Raspberry dessert filling instead of jam. The dessert filling isnt super sweet like the jam, and it also doesnt spread out like jam does when you bake it.

This exceeding my expectations of a buttery cookie.  Not too sweet, which is perfect for me and just enough tartness in the raspberry, which works well for my husband (he loves raspberry). Next time I'd probably hold back on how much I used of the extract just because it could be overpowering but not excessive. That was my fault though. I didn't have the right measuring spoons.  Otherwise, they taste just like they look - mouthwatering!

These cookies looked much better then they tasted.  The dough got dry and cracked as i was making the thumbprint, had to reshape them with my hands. some of the filling poured out while cooking.  They did expand but held their shape.  Like i said they looked better then what they tasted.  They tasted very sweet, jam was very over powering and i can taste the sugar crystals in the cookie.

Didn't turn out well.  Followed the reciped to a T but the dough was far too dry.  I thought I goofed up and so I made another batch.  They turned out awful.  if you put any pressure on the dough, it breaks because it is too dry.  So the "thumbprint" cookies couldn't handle any pressure.  I had to improvise and shape them on the cookie sheet itself.  I cooked them and they were nothing to rave about.  Very dry and completely void of flavor (except for the jelly spot)  Wouldn't recommend.

I don't know what everyone is saying about their cookies falling flat.  The best remedy for this is after you make the dough...put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before you start rolling them into balls.  Keep putting the dough back in the fridge until you have baked them all. They are delicious and a very handsome looking cookie.  You can use different variations by changing the jams, or the extracts, nuts....try pure vanilla extract instead of almond, pineapple preserves with the dough rolled in coconut and macadamia nuts.

Made exactly. Too buttery, thin and crispy.  Needs something to make them more cakey-like.  Needs more almond extract / flavour.

WOW. these are delicious. the "almond" makes the cookie. i am using these for a cookie exchange & very excited on how they turned out. so scrumptious. Also, i used huckleberry jam & OHHH so tasty. followed the recipe but next time will use 1/4 more flour to keep the cookie from cracking.

Everybody loves these cookies!!!!  Here are a few tips-- use a small round measuring spoon to make indent- putting jam in a squeeze bottle makes for easy filling of indent and always allow them to cool on baking sheet for 1 - 2 minuets, this will allow cookie to set  and you will not get break through with the jam.  Add some almond slices before icing.

Almost perfect!  I did as others suggested and put the cookies on a baking sheet then in the fridge for 10 minutes before I filled with jam.  And I added probably a tablespoon or 2 of milk (like I normally do with any shortbread recipe) for a better dough consistency.  I had no issues with spreading or leaking jam.  And I used a spicy plum jam that was home made by a friend.  The sweet and spicy combo with the almond icing is simply amazing!

So GOOOD!  I used sugar free jam and about 5 table spoons was plenty...i also used only 1/4 of the confectioners' sugar for the icing.   For lighter calorie use Smuckers sugar free jam and Blue Bonnet light butter sticks.

Easy and delicious! I followed the advice of the reviewer that says to stick the prepped cookies in the refrigerator for about a half hour-they came out lovely. I've tried them with vanilla and almond extracts and they both turned out well (although I personally prefer the vanilla). Awesome little cookies, and everyone thinks you're a genius.

Absolutely delicious cookies - the jam on top makes it out of this world! My jam turned a bit sticky on the top after being baked but that's what made it so delicious. I opted out of the icing drizzle just because I thought it would be sweet enough and glad I chose to. Great cookies - they are always a hit!

Delicious!  They do take a little time, but the effort is worth it. Made these for a wedding cookie table and they added a lot of color.  A new "keeper" for the cookie file.

I read the reviews for this and was a little worried.  However, I made the recipe exactly as it said. Used the end of a chapstick tube to put the hole in the cookie and used 1/4 teaspoon for the jam.  These came out perfect without putting them in the fridge or making any other adjustments.  They will be a regular cookie in our home!

These tasted delicious but were the biggest mess ever.  Apparently my architecture of the cookie was flawed because i had raspberry jam everywhere.  Will rethink my design if i make these again.

really tasty, super easy and so pretty. I made 1 1/2 in. balls like it said and only got about 2 1/2 doz. so do slightly smaller balls if you want the full 36. I also used two different kinds of jam and that made it pretty too.

This is one of my favorite recipes! My mom submitted it to Taste of Home some time ago and they published it too!! They are addictive and make great Christmas cookies. They are also good if you replace the almond with vanilla and fill them with melted semisweet chocolate chips! yummy!

I love this recipe!  I use homemade cherry jam instead of raspberry and I leave off the glaze, but that is just personal preference.  Also, I noticed on another thumbprint cookie recipe, someone wondered how to get an even hole for the jam.  I use the cap of the almond extract, dipped in flour, then just press it into the dough ball.  Works like a charm!

These were great! I followed the recipe ingredients as is but I did change the instructions a bit. As did others, I chilled the dough after step 2 for 10 minutes. Also, I put the raspberry jam in a ziploc bag, cut off about 1/4 inch of the corner and squeezed the jam into the hole of the cookie. That made it a lot easier! Then I baked the cookies on a cookie sheet lined in parchment paper. They came out perfectly.

If 885 folks have reviewed this recipe, you have to know it's something out of the ordinary!   To say these are pretty special treats is an understatement.  I DID find the dough to be too dry so the addition of 2 tsp. milk made it workable.  Otherwise it was crumbly and didn't adhere.   DIVINE cookies!

I made these cookies on Easter Sunday. I found the recipe and was set on making them. Unfortunately, i realized i had no jam or almond extract. So i went down to the Chinese supermarket to see if they had any of the missing ingredients, but i was out of luck. As a last resort, i went to a gas station, where they had jam! But, they only had strawberry jam. I took what i got and bought the ridiculously expensive jam. I followed the recipe as well as i could, but found that the dough was very loose and dry. So i added some milk, until it was the right consistency. I rolled them out and filled them with the strawberry jam. I baked them for around 15 min. with the convection on. I tentatively took a bite, and they were really good. The change in jam and lack of extract made no difference. They also held up their shape very well and didn't spread too much. A very good recipe. My family loves them, and my husband, Harry, demands i make them every Easter.

I have made these cookies numerous times.  They are AWESOME.  I follow the directions to the tee, although sometime I change the flavor of the preserves..but, I find that raspberry is always the best!!..I have never had any leftover cookies when I display them.

Yummy... I wish I would have used something wider than a wooden spoon handle to make the holes because the jam didn't spread out as much as I'd hoped... but flavor was great!

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  I have tried many thumbprint recipes and this is one of the best!

Awesome. I made these little gems for Christmas and they went over extremely well.   I did however, follow some of the tips in the comments section, refrigerating the dough for 20 -30 minutes after it was mixed and then again after the cookies were shaped. As a result, the cookies didn't spread as much and I didn't have any jam disasters in my oven.

Really good and hubby loved them too! Had the issue where they got really flat, but it didn't hurt anything.  I also made a batch without jelly, and put chocolate frosting on them after baking, and the cookie wasn't as good.  I think the glaze helps a lot!

I would give these I three, but everyone who tried them would rate a five. They were just to sweet for my taste. They went quick, and all wanted more. Instead of raspberry I used Peach jam, since thats what I had.

Decided to give these a try, and I followed the recipe verbatim, and got great results! I used a brand new AA battery to make the well for the jam, lol...oh, and I put the cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes before baking...everyone I gave them to raved about how good they tasted and looked.

They were good but I dont think they need the icing on top, just makes them too sweet. I would make again but with no icing.

I used a recipe very similar to this one from a Land O Lakes Cookbook. It was pretty much the same with just some different proportions and water instead of milk in the glaze. It was a hit! Everybody loved these and they stayed soft for days! will definitely make again!

I do not consider myself a master chef/baker by any means, but these looked easy enough!  I tried them out using both raspberry and apricot jam - DELICIOUS!!!!  Brought them in for coworkers and they were a big hit!!  Tips: 1) Make sure to put the indentation in the dough right after forming the ball, if the dough it sits while you make make each ball, it tends to crack when making the indentation.  I used the top of the almond extract bottle for a perfectly round center.  2) Agreed with the other reviewers, refrigerating the dough before baking helps it keep its form.  3) I added a little extra milk to the drizzle to make it a more "drizzle-able" consistency, and then piped it on through a plastic baggie with the edge snipped off.

These cookies are FANTASTIC!!! I made them a little smaller than the recipe says using a 1/2 TBSP measuring spoon for consistency. It took 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven for them to be perfectly brown on the bottom with no browning around the edges, and they came out to what I think was a perfect size. At the advice of another reviewer, I used a chap stick end to make the "thumbrints" and it worked beautifully. What a pretty (and great tasting) little Christmas cookie! These are definately a keeper!! Thanks to Dee for sharing the recipe :D

I couldn't find the recipe I usually use so I decided to go with this one. I followed the recipe exactly; I wish I had run a test batch before putting a whole cookie sheet full in the oven. My first ones came out flat, thes spead like crazy. I turned down the over to 325 (I have an electric stove) and the second batch was in the fridge with the first one were baking. They still spread out but were not as flat as the first. The 3rd were also put in the fridge and they came out the best but still nothing like the photo.   I do like the flavor of these cookies but don't like how flat and wide they got.

These are very good and easy. Some tips I learned that may help: keep the dough cold it wont spread as much. Try the back of a wooden spoon and make a well deeper than wide. Mix the jam in a small bowl until its smooth and almost pours into the well. Bake by time, looks can be deceiving. By the time they look cooked their over done. Enjoy!

First off can I say I hate when someone changes a recipes then complains that it didn't turn out right.  This is a very good recipe, always turns out good for me.  The only "change" I make is to chill the dough a bit before baking.

The jam did seep out on a few, but wasn't horrible. At first the glaze seemed really thick, but I added a little extra milk and then it was too thin. I would suggest letting the cookies cool before glazing otherwise all the glaze congregates in the center and you don't get the drizzle effect. I ended up with 24 cookies.

This shortbread recipe is delicious.  I have been making these for a few years now for christmas and are always a big hit.  Some people said their cookies spread too much when cooking.  I found using land o lake butter seems to help prevent this.

YUM YUM! I used jam with seeds in it because it was so much cheaper than the other kind. The dough was so dry, I wasnt sure these were going to work. I skipped the icing because they were just great without it. I will be making these again and again.

The flavor was great, but when baked they spread out and laid flat.  This was a real disappointment, but the taste was so good just sliced them like bars.

Decent flavor but difficult dough!!  Used 1/4tsp of almond extract and reduced flour by 1/3C and still needed to add about 1-2Tbsp. of milk just to get dough workable.  Couldn't shape cookies without using the milk...too dry and crumbly.  Overall tasty...thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy to make cookies.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and rolled them in a ball and used a chapstick to make the hole for the raspberry preserves.  I also used waxed paper and they came out perfect.  Will add to my holiday cookie list!

Very good!!  I used several reviews to get a perfect cookie!!  I used 1/4 cup extra flour and 2 tsp milk.  Set the dough in the fridge for 20 min and then rolled small balls and placed on my cookie sheets.  I then used an end to a Sharpie and made the well for the jelly, I rounded out the top of the hole to make it bigger.  I then placed jelly in each well and set in the freezer.  I baked at 325 for 30 min and had a perfect cookie!!

Excellent Holiday cookie recipe! Everyone loved these and they were so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't run into any of the problems that other reviewers experienced with flattening and the filling running out.  I will definitley make these again!

Just made these last night.  I halved the recipe but still made 30 decent size shortbreads.  I lowered the oven temp to 325F, and baked them for 15 mins.  I did put the dough in the freezer for 15 mins before baking and they all turned out great.  No spilling at all.

This recipe is delicious! Made my first batch in a friend's kitchen without my usual appliances and it still turned out amazingly. Someone in the reviews suggested you use the end of a chapstick tube for the "thumbprints" and I'm very glad I did. They were just the right size! I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry and they still turned out fantastic, and I plan to experiment with various types. Cheerio!

I made several batches for a large party and everyone raved.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the frosting..   For a beautiful presentation I gently brushed the tops and sides of the balls with egg white and rolled just the edges of the ball in finely chopped almonds. In the center I made my wholes... After several batches I found the skinny, deeper holes (I used back of permanent marker) work the best so the preserves dont run all over. . I also filled with different flavors of preserves so that they would also present a color variety.  They looked store bought and taste delicious!!!

Made this with no modifications. I had never attempted to make a shortbread recipe.   This was incredible!! My Significant Other is a huge shortcake fan so I was very nervous when he began to eat them.  He says that these cookies are now his favorite!! Awesome recipe, easy, and the end result is rewarding!

The shortbread cookie itself is delicious, and with the jam and frosting, it's outstanding.  However, the appearance and baking process did not go as well for me.  It may have been my fault, I used a uniform scooper to drop them (that's ball-shaped, right?!) and they baked much larger than expected and turned flat and strawberry jam leaked all over my cookie sheets.  However, I didn't follow instructions to the letter, next time I will actuallt take the time to roll them into tiny balls and see what happens! Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are super easy - but always get rave reviews! First found them in a land o'lakes cookie book. To prevent cookies from spreading - ensure butter is not too soft - just soft enough to mix. Also do not add extra extract - and definitely chill for at least an hour.  I use a cookie scoop - shape and indent the cookies and stash them in the freezer while I roll the next batch - then switch trays to add the jam. They keep shape well and look beautiful. I have used raspberry and strawberry jam - and even Nutella (careful - burns easily) - but my most requested is with Guava Jam - yummy and sweet (I will usually omit glaze with these.) Everyone should try these!

I was really attracted to this recipe because there were so few ingredients!  Still, these were wonderful.  You can't rush baking, and I agree that the dough should be cold before going into the oven.  Plus, it's important to make the cookies extra tall, so they don't spread too much.    These were easy, beautiful, rich, and delicious.

Great cookies!  But I will admit I omitted the almond extract from the icing... it smelled too artificial.  All my guests enjoyed these cookies...

These were soooo yummy.  I made 2 batches within one week.  The first batch was perfect.  The second batch I added a little too much almond extract to the cookie mix and they came out too soft so now I know next time to stick to the original recipe.  I did not put the glaze but they were still very delicious without it.

These were super easy to make and taste delicious.  I didn't make the glaze and I added vanilla instead of almond extract.  My daughter made the thumbprints.  Fun, kid friendly, yummy!

Wonderful!  My husband called them Marzipan cookies because of the rich almond taste.  Make sure to chill before you bake so the jam has a firm place to rest.

These cookies are addictive!  I've made them for Christmas gifts, for cookouts, for parties, and everyone asks for the recipe.  I follow the recipe just as it is.  One thing I watch is the softness of the butter.  Don't let it get oversoft on the counter.  It should be a bit firm when you're creaming with the sugar.  This prevents the cookies from flattening out.  And using a really good raspberry jam is a must!  I love the taste of almond, so you could add a bit more to the glaze if you like.  Excellent cookies!

Tasted like rancid butter with overcooked raspberry jam. I made them exactly as the recipe called for, and was quite disappointed. They puffed nicely, didn't spread too much...Sigh. A waste of half a pound of butter.

These cookies were delicious and the dough was an absolute dream to work with. I followed the recipe exactly, but added more almond extract in the frosting because I love almond extract! Be sure to make really small balls and not to make the thumbprint too deep, otherwise the jelly will bake right through the bottom. Otherwise- absolutely delicious!! Thanks for sharing!

These cookies were just what I was looking for! I wanted to try shortbread cookies (my first time) and these seemed easy enough. I made a few modifications, and they turned out great! I didn't have almond extract, so I used vanilla (slightly less than the recipe called for) and I wanted chocolate, so I used melted semi-sweet chocolate instead of jam and filled the thumb print when the cookies came out of the oven. Perfect!

these were so easy and absolutely tasty. it helps to roll all of the dough into balls at once and punch wholes in them then once you have a pan ready you can just grab them from the bowl and place the jelly in them. I used a strawberry jelly and it has a great sweet taste. Also freezing the cookies for about 5 minutes before the oven really helps them keep their shape. One this i found helpful as well is when your punching the holes in your dough if you experience the cookie cracking just knead the dough in your hands for a bit.and i dashed a bit more almond extract in the icing, it makes them really fragrant.

I made this with strawberry jam and those of us who like jam cookies loved them!  The almond flavor shortbread is nice... I was skeptical of almond and jam together.  The icing can be omitted, but it's not hard to make and really dresses up the cookie.  So good.

Amazing cookie!  I use a little more almond flavor than recipe calls for, but that is just my taste.  These go over great anywhere I take them.  I've yet to meet someone who does not like them.

This recipe is easy and tasty just as it is. Ran out of Raspberry jam half way through and used strawberry and marionberry and it was just as tasty. The family liked that there was no egg in the dough so they could sneek the raw dough when they thought I wasnt looking (so they thought) Im not a big fan of almond extract, but this recipe has the right amount, not too overwhellming.

Words cannot describe how easy and delish these were.  I made these at the last minute for SuperBowl Sunday and they were a hit!!  Now, I didn't plan out to make this, (it was decided on a whim) so I didn't have almond flavoring.  I substituted with Amaretto liqueur in the shortbread and the glaze.  I'm glad I did it, too.  Also, I forgot about the raspberry jelly (again, I was very unprepared) but I did have strawberry jam.  I'm not too fond of strawberry jam, but the hubby is and it was great enough for me to overcome my dislike.  I did triple the batch (don't know why I did that, either) so I had plenty of left overs.  I got lazy about over half way through and just squashed the dough w/o putting jam on.  Again, still good that way, too. Next time, I plan to be prepared and buy the raspberry jam, but I'm keeping the Amaretto liqueur ;-)

I was looking for a thumbprint recipe and these are so delicious! I ended up putting them in the fridge for 15 mins (or until firm) before popping them in the oven. Came out perfectly shaped! My first batch I tried adding the egg and the 1/4 C extra flour and it came out tasting more like flour than almond. So I recommend sticking to the recipe exactly except refrigerating them for 15 mins (with the jam/preserves in place) then putting them straight into the oven.

They were perfect without changing anything.  Very easy to make and were delicious! Update: I found that using a pastry bag and piping the batter in circular motion leaving a small indintation for the jam worked out best for me. It took much less time to prepare and turned out very pretty. Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made these for the 1st time. Followed the recipe, rolled each ball into crushed almonds and used the end of my muddle-r to make the "thumbprint". I used my 1/4 teaspoon to fill each.  Came out PERFECT and taste PERFECT!  These are def a keeper for my xmas cookies!  I cant wait to share them on Christmas day! YUM-O!

I baked over 500 cookies for the holidays this year and tried 7 different recipes.  This is the recipe I am pulling back up because even a double batch went so fast I need to make more! (Ok, so maybe I was the main offender!) I like my cookies on the light side, so I only cooked them for about 12 minutes and I also needed to add a little more milk to the glaze. Definitely my favorite this year!

Never again will I cheat and make these from the Betty Crocker bag!  After the first batch, I realized that I wasn't going to get anywhere near 3 dozen cookies.  So, I rolled the dough into about 1 inch or smaller in size.  From experience, an actual thumbprint is too wide and shallow which sometimes causes an overflow of jam.  So, I poke a hole halfway through the ball using the back end of my spatula which is a bit wider than my pinky finger.  The dough will spread a bit which results in a thumbprint size crevice of jam.  I noticed that my last tray spreaded 2x as much as the first tray.  I believe it was from over handling the dough as I was constantly reshaping them to get a full dozen.  Next time, I will pop the loaded tray in the fridge in between baking.

I am not a fan of shortbread cookies, but somehow I liked these-alot!  I think it is the little touch of almond that makes these so good to me.  I had no problems with the jam running all over.  I just made the dough into very small balls(should yield 36!), and used the end of my wooden spoon to make the indentation halfway down into the cookie. I skipped the icing, I think they are tasty without, although I'm sure they would be superb with it as well.   I will make these again.

These cookies turned out wonderful and they taste great.  I made the dough in my food processor which worked up very nicely.  I used my middle size cookie scoop to scoop out the dough on the cookie sheet (walnut size) and a 3/4 inch diameter wooden spoon to make the indents about 1/4 inche deep and being careful to squeeze the dough back together if it split a bit.  When they baked they flattened nicely and turned out perfect.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

These do not hold their shape, even after chilling the dough and the cookie sheet! I have used other thumbprint recipes that do not flatten out at all. I will stick to my old faithful.

Okay these Cookies TASTE delicious, BUT even with the tips from MarcieJ (putting in more flour and putting them in the freezer before baking), they still came out flat, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 
Update: I made these again tonight and added 2 1/4 cups of flower and an egg and refrigerated the dough for about a half hour before rolling into little balls. That seemed to help a lot, because they didn't come out flat :)

Mmmmm... tasty! For those having trouble with the flattening out, try using a mini muffin pan instead of a cookie sheet. They are great this way; more to bite into at once and they look fabulous:) I used half with apricot preserves and the other half with a home-made raspberry sauce with a recipe from this site.. will be making this over and over again.***I made these again and took the suggestion of adding an egg; big mistake. They did come out a little puffier but the taste was not as buttery and they lacked that 'melt-in-your-mouth' effect. They were also crispier with the egg, which I didn't like. They were still good, they're just much better w/o the egg. I still recommend using a mini muffin pan because you can make the indentations much deeper which means more filling and when you bite into them the sauce will slowly drip out! They're soo good!!

These thumbprints were a big hit at my yearly cookie exchange. They looked beautiful and tasted even better! An added bonus is that they were easy to make! I put the prepared dough with the jam in the freezer for about 30 min. as well before baking and this worked well. They did spread  out a bit more than I had expected, so you can make them small if you need to make a lot like I did.

Fabulous and so very easy. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and refrigerated the dough prior to filling holes with jam and then baking. And I did need to add approx. 2 more tsp of milk to get a good consistency for the drizzle/glaze. Also, made use of 2 ziploc baggies - one for the jam and one for the glaze which made for quick and neat piping. Perfect cookies - impressive look and phenomenal taste!

If you aren't getting great results when making this, you're doing something wrong. I followed the recipe to the T up until the preserves. I added Strawberry instead of raspberry.(never cared for it much) Anywho, I got 32 good size cookies. And they were soft, moist, and DELIOCIOUS! A great/easy/fun recipe and I'll recommend it to anyone!

These are excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I used a cork as I think someone suggested in another review for the "thumbprint" and used a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon to put the jam in with.  I didn't have any problem with the jam running.  Excellent cookies and very easy.  I'm taking them to a cookie exchange but making an extra batch to keep at home!  Love that subtle almond flavor with the slightly tart raspberry and sweet glaze.

Taste is great, but my dough was very flaky and would not roll into balls very easily.  I guess next time I'll try adding a little milk and kneading more?  And my cookies spread out too much.

The dough is very tasty. My second batch came perfectly. If your cookies come out flat it's probably because the balls are a bit too large or you've set the temperature of the oven too high. I made smaller balls the second time around and chilled them for about 45 minutes. The cookies stood tall and there wasn't any leaking.

Awesome and super easy!  There's only two of us at home so I made a half a recipe.  Here I am two days later making another half batch!  Be generous on the raspberry jam.  I also made double the icing but the original amount is sufficient enough.  MMM!

These cookies are delicious!  And so easy!  Next time I make them I am going to try putting the preserves in after I cook the cookie because of the strange texture of cooked preserves.  Otherwise a hit in my  household!

I made these cookies last year for a cookie exchange and people STILL remember them and are asking for me to bring them again.  They come out so beautifully and look like something from a magazine.  And they have so few ingredients and are really quite easy!

Delicious and easy - I love recipes with so few ingredients. I couldn't get the drizzle to, well, drizzle, so I left a few without - they were equally good either way.  I did the first batch according to recipe, and the second batch I added some more flour like others suggested and it worked a little better.

These are excellent! I followed the advice of others and added about 1/4 cup of flour to what the recipe called for. I also put the indented dough balls in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. I wanted to fill them with frosting, so I left out the jam. I also rolled the balls of dough in finely chopped walnuts before making the indentions. After they cooled I filled them with a simple icing (cream 1/2 stick butter until smooth; add 2 cups powdered sugar; add milk to desired consistency). The result was amazing! They were easy to make and delicious to eat. Thanks for a great recipe!

A little hard to form the cookies, but it just takes time and patience. Totally worth the work.  Perfect flavor.  Previous reviews helped a lot.  This is my new favorite cookie!!!!

Made these for Mother's day and she LOVED them! I didn't have raspberry so I used strawberry jam. I reduced the temp. a little and none of them spilled over. About halfway through I addd a tiny bit more jam to each, then smoothed it out. When they were done I drizzled a vanilla glaze on half and a chocolate glaze on the others. They came out perfect. :)

Amazing recipe! These cookies disappear FAST. 
- I substituted vanilla extract for almond (personal preference.)
- the second time I made these I skipped the glaze and they were delicious both ways.
Just make sure that you use cold butter and blend the dough thoroughly to prevent the cookies from spreading.

I didn't have any problems with this recipe although I did make a few changes flavor wise. I used a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of almond extract. I used melted white chocolate chips for the glaze and sprinkled some sliced almonds on the top.

Some tips... keep mixing in mixer on low until dough comes together. It looks crumbly at first but will eventually form if you are patient. I also used the back side of a melon baller to make indentions. About halfway down is good. 
These cookies do flatten out a bit so you make them on the small side if you don't want a large cookie.

Overall, good recipe. Very pretty of you are looking to impress.

My boyfriend made these cookies for me for valentines day and they were amazing!  He followed the recipe exactly and they did spread quite a bit, but it did not take away from how good these were.  Thanks for posting this one.  We will definitely add this to our recipe box.

These are actually really fast to make, but they look fancy.  Someone told me they looked like they should be served at a wedding.  I didn't have raspberry jam, so I used blackberry and it was awesome.  I was worried because of the people who had to make all of the changes for these to turn out, but I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect.

Made this Christmas - turned out beautiful and everyone enjoyed them!  I was expecting the cookie part to have more of a shortbread taste and texture, it wasn't crispy as shortbread.  Perhaps I didn't have the butter at the right temperature or over mixed the dough.

I knew after tasting these - this recipe is going into my permanent cookie file.  I put them into the fridge for 10-15 minutes before baking.  Baked perfectly for me at 13 minutes.  Be careful not to let them brown too much.  I used strawberry jam rather than raspberry.  Good without frosting, but better with it!  My guests loved them, too.  They look and taste great!

These were so good and easy! I followed the recipe exactly and then refridgerated the dough before baking and they turned out perfect. After tasting one without the glaze I thought they were great without it so I left it off since I was adding them to cookie trays for xmas and thought they'd be to messy with it, but then I got home and added glaze to the ones I kept for ourselves and they were absolutely amazing with the icing. I felt like I cheated my friends and family out of an even better cookie than what they already were. Planning on making another batch soon cuz they went way to fast!

Amazing recipe. My family and friends request these cookies all the time. I make them a little smaller than recommended and stick them in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking. 

Also, they make GREAT volcano cookies for a luau party. Shape the cookies to look like little volcanoes (higher sides) and cook as directed (make sure to chill before baking so they do not spread out!). Then, add orange food coloring to the glaze and have it run down the sides of the "volcano" to look like lava. Was a big hit.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've avoided shortbread recipes in the past after a disastrous attempt in my youth! This recipe is easy, delicious and looks great. I substituted vanilla for almond extract and used a white chocolate and cream glaze.

Great cookies!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions like not softening the butter.  I used a 1/8 teaspoon to put holes in the cookies and I bought a squeezable bottle of seedless rasberry spread.  Yum!

I just made the rasberry and almond shortbread thumbprints and they were amazing! I didnt make mine as big as the recipe said to though. I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls, made a very deep hole and used a ziplock bag to squeeze in the jam!I also added some green food coloring to the glaze and put a sliced almond in the middle. They look like little christmas wreaths!

Delicious!!  These cookies taste awesome!  They disappeared quickly!  The dough was a bit crumbly.  I did stick it in the freezer before baking, as suggested, and added a small amount more flour.

It's a great recipe and comes out great the first time, but the measurements on the glaze are a bit off: double the milk or you just have sugary crumbles.

Very tasty!  Definately refrigerate the dough before using it.  It helps w/ the spreading.  For my first batch I made the balls on the smaller side and I did not like the size. For the second batch I make the dough balls a little larger, and bingo! Perfect!

Everyone I've made these for adored them.  I've tried to not make this that often because they're so bad for you. :D

As per the annoying-reviewer-syndrome, I modified the recipe. Instead of almond, I used vanilla extract and have tried both blackberry and strawberry jams. It's a pretty basic recipe so it worked out well. I also didn't use the glaze. 


I used a small cookie scoop to help portion out the cookies. Then I rolled them into a ball shape before flattening and making the indentation. Just try to remember to not be too enthusiastic with the thumbprinting as it's easy for the dough to break and have the jam leak though.

These also seemed to ship well.

I made this as a cookie without the jam. SO light and buttery. Instead of almond essence, I substitute it with 1 tsp vanilla essence. The dough turned out sticky and was not easy to roll so I stuff them into a piping bag and piped them all out. LOVELY!

I followed the other ladies' advice and added 1/4 cup of flour and chilled the jam filled cookies before baking...they turned out perfectly! There was no spreading and the jam didn't leak. This batch yielded almost 50 cookies but I made them really small, about 1" balls. Perfect bite size!

These were absolutely delicious!! I made half the batch to kind of test it out, I loved it. I am doubling the recipe tomorrow to make for my sister in law who just had a baby. I used strawberry jelly instead of raspberry because thats all I had. Very good, definitely going to add as one of my favorites.

Sinfully rich buttery cookies with just a hint of sweetness!  I used my cookie scooper to form balls and came up with about two dozen cookies.  I also used strawberry jam which is my favorite flavor.  These were so good that my husband and I ate all of these cookies by ourselves.  I will make some for the holidays; otherwise, they aren't safe around my house!  Great recipe, Dee!

These were a HUGE hit! Even my mom who isn't a fan of shortbread couldn't stop herself! She finished them all in 2 days!

I was totally unimpressed by these cookies.  Mine came out ugly - not like the picture.  Also, there was no flavor to the cookie part and I even added a dash of vanilla.  I had to cook them longer than the suggested time.  These were a huge waste of time, ingredients, and energy.  I will not make these again.

These are also delicious by adding lemon extract instead of the almond and using lemon curd instead of raspberry preserves.  I have used these cookies when I do my business marketing and they are ALWAYS popular.

Love the taste!  The combination of almond and raspberry is excellent.  I put the dough in the freezer 10 minutes to chill, and it handled beautifully.  But beware when making the thumprint and filling with raspberry jam:  what you see is what you will get.  The cookie doesn't change at all while baking.  If it's a little messy looking when you put it in, it will come out the same way.  Oh, also used at least a tablespoon of milk for the glaze.  Probably more.  I wanted a very thin, light glaze, and loved the result.

Really good and not at all hard to work with.  They were kind of crispy at first, but after I put them into an airtight container, they softened up and became chewy.....mmmmmm! Definitely use the almond extract, it does make a difference.  I did need about a teaspoon more milk in the glaze to get the right consistency, otherwise this recipe is right on!

I loved these! I used my corn-on-the-cob holders to make a perfect round indent for the jam. I didn't have seedless either and they were fine. I would however make more of the icing sugar topping, I ran out for the last couple cookies

I made these today with my children and they turned out great!  I'd read the reviews and as a result I added an extra 1/4 C. of flour.  Since this was my first time making them, I'm not sure what it improved, but the consistency was very easy to work with.

I also added a touch of extra milk to the *doubled* portion of the icing.  Otherwise it was too thick.

Refrigerating the dough for about 20 minutes prior to shaping really helped with its form.  I used a melon baller covered with seran wrap to make the indentations as mentioned by someone.  It worked well.

Mmmm thank you MarcieJ for the recommended modifications! I did use an extra 1/4c of flour, and let them chill in the freezer for 10. They look perfect, and they taste fantastic. They barely lost their shape. I also used a chapstick to make the indent. I wraped it up in that new glad seal saran wrap and had no troubles with it sticking (i didn't use icing sugar or flour to prevent sticking to note). 

I did drizzle a lil dizzle (icing) on them, it makes them look sweeter and taste sweeter. I stored mine in muffin/cupcake wrappers now they really good athentic. Thanks again for the tips, first try and they turned out perfect!!

If not for all the advice everyone gave, I'm sure I'd have thrown in the towel on these cookies.  I so rarely bake that I forgot that a cup of butter was not one but two sticks and had to ditch the first batch.  I did refrigerate the batter and freeze the cookies for 10 minutes prior to baking and the jam didn't run nor did the cookies spread too much.  I added the extra 1/4 cup of flour and tried to use the chapstick, which gave the best looking cookie of all if dipped in confectioners sugar, but I could see the sugar in the impression and wasn't sure if that would affect the taste too much.  When I didn't dip the chapstick in confectioners sugar and tried to pull it out of the cookie, it pulled the dough with it, so I just used my little finger.    I tried the suggestion to bake the cookies without the jam for 7 mins and then fill; that worked, but the hole nearly disappeared and I had to press the middle down again to put the jam in.  Those cookies were a bit flatter than the others and didn't look quite as good. They also contained a lot more jam.   They all tasted delicious, however.  I thought the cookies were relatively time-consuming to make mainly because the thumbprints are so tiny to try to fill.  I don't know how people managed to do it with a cut-off baggie.  They were delicious though.

I followed others' suggestions as to how to save the cookies from turning out flat, but they still spread in the oven.  They don't look pretty but they taste great; thankfully none of my friends care when it comes to presentation so they'll be getting flat shortbreads for Christmas at any rate :)

These cookies were good, but they didn't seem like shortbread. I used two cookie sheets, and varied the bake times, but they only turned out crunchy if they were dark brown. (burnt) They were too soft if i only baked them for 15 inutes, and chewy in the middle. Wont be making them again.

Very good... I made some variations (using different jam, crushed almonds, etc etc) and they were delicious. Very easy to make. I left out the glaze though, and that was probably a good thing.

Oh, and also, (at least for mine) it tastes better the day after, when it gets softer.

This is the first time that my thumbprint biscuits have been up to standard. Tasty, light and totally yummy. I used seedless blackberry jam. It only made 12 cookies for me. My kids loved them and they were very easy to make. Make sure your butter is softened before you use it. I had to add about 1 tbsp of milk to make dough hold together instead of crumbs.

These are great! I didn't use the glaze though. My other alteration is, I rolled the cookie dough balls in a little egg white, and then in some crushed almonds before pressing the centers down, and baking. Turned out great. Nice toasted almonds all the way around. YUM!

Wow, these were good!  They were easy, fast, and made very few dirty dishes.  I recommend refrigerating the dough for 10-15 minutes for easier handling.  If your thumb sticks to the dough when making the thumbprint, dip your thumb in flour first.  I had to add another tsp. or so of milk to the glaze to make it easier to work with.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  Be sure and not make the balls too big or they spread too much when baking - being little is what makes them cute!  The second time I made these, I used apricot jam - wonderful as well!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried several thumbprint cookie recpies but these were my favorite.  The glaze makes them look festive and adds to the flavor.  I would suggest using a high quality raspberry jam for optimum taste.

FABULOUS!!! I used vanilla in place of almond and had them turn out just fine. The dough just needed some extra work to come together. We used Seedless Black Raspberry Jam and they are so outstanding! Yum yum yum.

These were great and relatively easy to make! Ended up with about 20 instead of 36. I actually made my thumbprint with a small plastic ball after I realized my thumbs were too tiny to make a nice thumbprint. Definitely a keeper!

I loved these cookies, very tender and stayed soft.  The dough was slightly hard to work with but I found it easier to form into dough balls after being refrigerated for an hour.  I used seedless blackberry jam and vanilla extract and had several requests for the recipe.

These cookies tasted good and had a nice shortbread texture--however, after baking for 14 minutes they were quite a bit darker and crisper than I would have liked.  They might need a shorter baking time.

This really calls for 10 stars.  I made it just as recipe calls except for the filling.  I only had chunky cherry preserves, but I wouldn't have changed it. These are tryly orgasmic!!!!  I am an experienced baker and so happy I found this recipe.  These are exceptionally easy to make, and the end results can charm even a cookie despiser.  Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yom!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a wonderful recipie.. I made several batches at christmas and I think the ones that went over best were ones that I made with lemon curd instead of the preserves.

Great cookies and so easy. Even after reading all the great reviews I was still pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are.  I had to add  a little more milk to the icing to make it drizzley. Will definately make again.

Seriously good cookies!  We substituted lemon extract for the almond extract and made smaller cookies than recommended.  By using just the tip of our fingers, we made small indentations and filled them with raspberry preserves.  This makes wonderful bite-sized cookies that you can't resist!

Loved these cookies!! I brought them to a Christmas party and they were the first cookies gone. I made them with apricot and raspberry jelly.   They look really fancy with the icing on top.

This was the first thumbprint shortbread cookie I've made, so thank you:) I used margarine (out of butter), filled some with raspberry, apricot and peach jam...Lets just say I could not keep myself from having another and another!  I rolled them into balls, patted ~1"  then thumb printed (did not think the wet dough would roll well for me), came out fine.  The cookie was tender and tasty. Thank you.

These cookies are great. I use all kinds of fruit preserves. I prefer the smukers 100% simply fruit. Its also good in strawberry and bluberry. What I do is put a little bowl of flour next to me and dip the tip of my finger into the flower then make the indentation in the cookie. I use my finger not my thumb, and make it deep. I have also used a chocolate and strawberry cookie frostings to fill these with instead of fruit, and everyone loved it! I never use the glaze.

So quick, easy and delicious! The cookie dough was smooth, soft and creamy, and the almond flavor was spot-on. I used Smuckers seedless raspberry jam which is quite expensive but delicious. Like other reviewers, I used more milk in the glaze. My husband took two batches into work, and they got rave reviews. Great recipe, Dee!

These cookies are excellent! It took me a couple tries to get the depth of the thumbprint just right. Definately make the dough balls 1.5" and the hole shallow and wide leaving about a quarter inch of dough at the bottom. Also, do not forget to let the cookies cool ON THE SHEET before removing. I cooked mine until the edges were golden and let them sit about 5 minutes to let them firm up.

these cookies turned out great but the almond flavor was a little overwhelming.  next time, i might try using vanilla instead of almond extract in the shortbread and see how that turns out.  i was worried about spreading so i used half butter, half shortening.  maybe i should try all butter next time and see if it does spread.  definitely chill the dough to make it easier to work with.  i thoughts 1 1/2 inch balls would be too big so i scooped the dough wtih an ice cream scooper and divided each ball in half.  that seemed to work out well.  next time, ill try filling the cookie halfway through the bake time b/c the cookie did not seem to hold its shape too well when there was a lot of filling in it. all in all, the recipe and flavor of the cookie is really good, i just made a couple changes to the process.

Great recipe! After dough hardens a bit in the fridge, just put it in microwave on defrost for 20-30 seconds and its fine. You can also wet your hand to work with the dough. Defnitely a keeper recipe.. dangerous to have around, b/c they are addictive!

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but it just didn't happen.  The cookies came out flat as pancakes with jam centers.  I was even sure to refrigerate the batter (and I say batter because it was SO wet and sticky) before rolling it.  I ended up adding in an extra cup of flour before the cookies would hold their shape.  2 cups of flour just doesn't seem like it can be the right amount to be combined with a cup of butter.  The recipe I used prior to this one called for 3/4 cup of butter and 3 1/2 cups of flour, but I thought I'd try this one because I wanted something less flour-y tasting.  With the addition of the extra flour these came out just fine, but I'm still going to look for the perfect thumbprint recipe.

I didn't have any almond extract so I used vanilla in the cookies and lemon juice in the glaze.  I strained freezer raspberry jam for the filling to get rid of the seeds.  My husband loved them!

They're tasty, but hard to keep from flattening out and staying togther.  They're almost...too short...several of them fell apart.  Very tasty, but will use a different recipe next time.

One of the best cookie recipes here.  I changed it a little and rolled it with chopped pecans and added a double chocolate chip in the middle or thumbprinted it with jam.  Also tried rolling it in white sugar, but it turned out a little harder than the others.  Still a very good recipe.  Thanks Dee!

Yummy!!! These are very good. I was surprised at how easy they were too. I made them for a Valentine's potluck and got lots of compliments. I could not find seedless rasberry jam so I used an all fruit starwberry jam. Who knew something without chocolate could be so good!!!

These are fabulous!!! What a change from the traditional christmas cookies! I made them a little too large so I would make the balls smaller and add less jam but they are absolutely scrumptious!!!!! They had to be handed out to nieces/ nephews so there would be enough for everyone to try one.... triple batch next year!

I futzed with this a little...I didn't use raspberry jam or the glaze. Instead, I used sour cherry preserves and they were a hit! I took three dozen to work and they were gone in a flash. The absolute most wonderful recipe for thumbprint cookies I have ever tried - thanks Dee!

These were very simple to make...I tried them with apricot preserves and they came great too!  The consistency is like a linzer tart, but better!

This is now my all time favorite Christmas cookie!  I have never liked thumbprint cookies but couldn't resist trying it after reading the reviews - omigosh!  DELICIOUS!  Next time I'll make a double recipe so I'll have enough for guests ... THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE.

After all tyhe raves, I couldn't wait to make these. They were flat, tasteless and the only good part was the jam! I should have realized 4 1/2 cups of flour was an awful lot since the rest of the ingredients are usually listed for use with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of flour.
I just reread the recipe, I made a BIG mistake. Sorry. Will try them again
Very disappointed!

We loved this recipe.  We changed a few things.  We don't like almond extract so instead we did
vanilla extract.  And we didn't have raspberry jam so we used strawberry.
They turned out great!

Fantastic recipe! My husband doesn't like raspberry so I used a bunch of different jams in the cookies. Turned out great. I would also add more almond extract and keep a watchful eye on the flour. These cookies bear an extremely close taste to linzer cookies, but more delicate, and without all the work. I'm sold on them.

Best cookies ever, easy and delicious, I sprinkled confectioner sugar instead of glaze and went a little heavier on the almond extract, also used jam from a squeeze jar, easier for me and the kids.  Highest recommendation!

This recipe turned out great but the only problem was being able to roll the dough into balls-it seemed to crumble when I tried.  I added just a little bit of water and it helped.

I don’t usually write reviews, but I can not usually bake anything without it turning into a disaster. Let me tell ya, this was amazing exactly as written. Ran out of almond extract so used a small amount of vanilla instead. But would be good either way. These cookies were perfection!! I used a fork to mix everything together (weirdly enough), did not overwork, & my cookies did NOT turn out flat. Perfection.

I had to change out the raspberry preserves with strawberry, and had to add more milk to the drizzle than what was called for, but other than that it was really great! Would 10/10 use this again!

I used wild berry jam and while they are a unique cookie flavour wasn't a big hit with people. the icing should had been done once they were cold as it melted into the jam.

Great recipe and super delicious.   I did however make a change in the amount of sugar.   I found them to be very very sweet - so if that’s your taste then go with the recipe.    the second time I made them I cut the sugar down and found them much more to my liking.
Also, I used a small melon baller to scoop the dough for a more consistent sizing through out.
You can also use different flavored preserves.
Otherwise the cookies are absolutely delicious!!!!!

it is critical to refrigerate the dough at least 1 hour, then shape into balls and proceed.
leaving this out is a critical mistake that leads to a huge waste of ingredients.

I usually don't make modifications to recipes but I did with this one.  First, I used peach jam instead of raspberry due to taste preferences.  Second, I made the icing as written and tasted it and I did not like how strong the almond extract was.  I put it on one cookie and tried it and that was all I could taste.  So I threw it out and made it without the almond extract.  My daughter loved it saying they tasted like poptarts (she's a big fan) and this is my husband's new favorite cookie.  Because of the icing, I'm only giving four stars but this is definitely a keeper.

Made for xmas to share. I am at 4200 ft. altitude. no adjustments needed. Followed recipe exactly. Used my thumb, I have little thumbs,and grandson's baby spoon to fill with jam. Perfect amount. Used chop stick to drizzle glaze onto cooled cookies. I just Love their flavor and festive appearance. Gearing up for another batch

I just ate my first cookie and loved it. They turned out perfect using the recipe as is and I used a thimble tor the indent. If the odd one splits while doing it just push it together. I put my raspberry jam through a sieve as my husband hates the seeds. The only issue I had was the glaze was too thick. I found a Tbsp of milk was perfect. The icing sugar was  packed down so perhaps that made a difference. Also I didn't like how the icing drizzled so with a tiny coffee spoon I put the icing in a circle around the jam. It drizzled down a bit and left the nice red center and looked great. The almond glaze makes the cookie !!!

I would suggest chilling the dough for an hour or two before baking. The cookies spread alot.

This recipe made flat cookies . You need to add almost another cup of flour and 2 egg yolks to get the consistency of a shortbread butter cookie that doesn’t flatten. Ruined 2 trays because I followed this recipe

Very easy recipe just followed the instructions, i did keep the dough in the fridge for 20 minutes prior to baking it. Also I used almond milk for the glaze instead of regular milk.

Had to add about a tablespoon of extra butter to moisten the dough and an extra tsp of milk for icing, but these plumped up nicely and melt in your mouth. Absolutely delicious!

I would not recommend this recipe. Even with all the tweaks they still came out flat and fragile. I waisted time and effort and still threw them out. They where to fragile to handle.

This cookie was not only delicious but very festive looking for the holidays. I made these cookies for an exchange I received compliments and one person texted to say they were here favorites. I didn’t change anything in the recipe but I did take the suggestion and refrigerate them for 15 minutes before baking. They turned out perfect! And yummy ??

These are addictive! Everyone who tries them are hooked. I actually prefer them without the glaze as they are almond-y enough without it. I made a triple batch this year because of how many people demanded them after I made them for the first time last year!

I should have read more reviews beforehand. Only after my kitchen disaster did I see that some mentioned that the cookies spread. If by spread they mean turn into absolutely flat wafers, then yes, they spread. At a minimum the dough needs to be super cold when going into the oven, but I’m not sure that’s enough to save it. Maybe I’ll be brave enough to experiment and try it again.

Easy.  Tasty.   Baked perfectly.  I did not experience flat cookies, and followed recipe exactly.  The only change i would make would be to use a smaller cookie scoop.  This recipe made 24 large cookies.

This recipe is so so good! I definitely recommend it. It’s super easy, and tastes delicious. One note: I recommend without the drizzle/frosting. It kind of takes away from the raspberry flavor in my opinion.

This recipe turned out wonderfully! I made two batches of these for a Christmas party, and they were a hit! [My mother had eaten easily half a batch before we even left for the party]
I will admit that I did deviate from this recipe, if only a little. I chilled my cookies for 10 minutes before putting them in, as so many suggested in the comments, and added a little more almond extract (I used 2/3 of a teaspoon). I ended up using a homemade raspberry puree for the middle, and they turned out marvelous! Definetly using this recipe again, and would recommend to anyone looking for a good shortbread cookie recipe!

Terrible, I see that some people make great cookies with this recipe but they modify it. I would say this recipe is missing the steps that make it successful.  I have years of baking experience, followed the recipe exactly and these cookies still turned into puddles.

These cookies never disappoint....anyone,..not the person baking them or the person eating them!  I put  dough in fridge for 15 minutes, much easier to work with that way; same for jam - Apricot and seedless  raspberry are my usual sweeties!  Doubled batch too and yielded 66 medium sized cookies.  14 minutes enough on dark cookie sheets.  More time on shinier sheets with no sides.  Taking to Linda’s for Thanksgiving.  Made 11/26/19.  P.S.  have made other recipe with conf sugar as the base - also good - more of a shortbread texture instead of soft.  All good!

I've made these cookies for three Christmases now and they are always a hit. They look great but are surprisingly easy, and so tasty! My one tip to avoid the flat cookies is to pop the tray of unbaked cookies into the freezer for about 5-10 minutes before baking. I've never had an issue with them being flat doing that.

I made them as written except I did not do the drizzle. I chilled the first few batches because of reviews and did not for the last batch. Both came out similar. I keep my house about 70 degrees. I used the cap from my extract to make the hole. It worked great and 1 teaspoon of jam fit perfectly. I used marionberry jam.

Switched up some ground almonds for some of the flour. Other than that I followed the recipe.  They are really good.

I found mix little dry after mixing everything so I pressed mixture into mini muffin tins and added the jam. Turned out great.

I had to add more butter to get the dough to shape properly. I also used strawberry spreadable fruit jam as it was easier to spoon into the thumb holes. Very tasty! My husband loved them and frequently asks for more.

I made these exactly according to the recipe and as many others have notes, they spread like crazy!  After the first ones spread all over, I froze the next batch for 20 minutes after shaping.  It did not help.  If you want to try making multiple adjustments to this recipe, it probably could work, but the recipe as is does not work.

Unbelievable taste! Sooooo good! It's not just for Christmas, I've made it twice already. The second time I made them, the dough was very crumbly. It was very hard to put a hole in it. The first time, I used a chapstick tube with no problem. This time, the rolled up ball would start crumbling when I tried to put a hole in it. I'm thinking that I should have softened the butter more. I put the dough in the fridge as some members suggested, but I think that made matters worse.

I followed the directions but took note of other reviewers and put the cookies in the freezer for a few minutes before filling them with the raspberry jam. The cookies kept their shape much better. The only change was increasing the x-sugar and the liquid too. The original recipe directions it was a thick glob! Added another tsp of milk and it thinned out nicely to drizzle. These are very pretty and look nice on a dessert buffet. They’re also really delicious!

Perfect in every way. Just had a craving for these ambrosial bites of  deliciousness [in mid-August] and they didn't disappoint. This recipe is foolproof. I did sprinkle unsweetened coconut flakes over each cookie before popping in the oven to bake. A nice flavourful bit of texture!

These are my favorite cookie and have been making them since ‘home ec’ classes - a LONG time ago.  This recipe is spot on and make them often without changing a thing except type of jam.  I rarely glaze them as they are sweet enough without - but the glaze does make them prettier.  I use the almond extract and find the flavor compliments but doesn’t overwhelm any jam used.  Made these last night with a fig-tangerine jam and, per usual, were well received when taking them to a small gathering today.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a very soft dough, but yields a wonderful cookie. I roll the balls in sanding sugar, use a wine cork for the imprint, fill the cookie with the jam, then place in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking. That really helps stop them from spreading. I use  almond or vanilla interchangably with no issue.

Seconding MarcieJ about the extra 1/4 flour, chilling in the freezer, and 10 degree lower cooking temperature. I would also add two other tips. 1) use slightly less almond extract in the cookies and leave off the icing, they're sweet enough and the almond starts to overpower the other flavors. 2) make sure to really dig deep and stuff the cookie very well with jam. like even a little bit more jam than you might think you need because first time I made them I definitely didn't pack enough in and there wasn't enough to go around when it came time for biting into them.

Very nice. I used apricot filling and it was terrific. Next time I'll probably double the almond extract, make the cookies a bit smaller, and make the filling area a bit larger.

I have made this recipe 3 thime this month! And everyone raves about them. I did have to make one change, as my house is lactose intolerant and we cannot use butter. I substituted 1/2 cup smart balance and 1/2 shortening. I also add in about 1/8 tsp of salt. Everything needs a little salt to bring out all the flavors even sweets. I also use a jams I have made (ex. Strawberry). That also makes a big difference.

Ironically enough the cookies that turned out good out of my two batches of almond and vanilla extract were the vanillas. 350 was way too low for the cookies (I ended up at 375), although that might be due to the bigger size of mine. If you have the same problem go up to 375 or else your cookies will not bake. I did a Nutella version that worked out really good, except never put the Nutella in the oven with the cookies- put it on when it is done baking. And if you want to further prevent cookie spreading with vanilla extract try cupcake wrappers on a baking sheet, it works really well (either double up on the paper wrappers or use the metal wrappers).

I prefer this thumbprint cookie recipe over the thumbprint cookies my Mom made. I didn't use the raspberry preserves because I prefer frosting.  Mom always decorated with frosting. Raspberry preserves would be as good.  Delicious, easy recipe to make.

I've made this recipe TWICE and everyone has loved the cookies! Made them at Christmas with raspberry and fig jam. Then for Valentine's made heart press and just used raspberry jam. I may even do these as party favors for my wedding, just need to find small enough letter to press onto cookie.

Perfect!  I did not make any changes to the recipe. I made them a little bit smaller and used a round wooden spoon handle to make the holes.  They are delicious and quick to make. Surely will make them again next week.

I greased my cookie sheet so that might be the reason why my cookies turned out flat. They were to flat to fill with jam. Had to throw them away.

I mixed the dough by hand and followed the recipe as written.  I used apricot,  strawberry and raspberry (seedless) preserves. I would definitely make it again! It's so delicious!

I've tried this recipe a few times. I'm not sure what I did differently the first time because they turned out great. Since then, whenever I follow the recipe they turn out flat. I tried putting the tray of prepared cookies in the freezer for 10 min prior to baking but that didn't help. Reading the reviews, this seems like a common problem. Also, I only get about 18 cookies with this recipe and that's if I make them a bit smaller than the recipe calls for. I don't see how you can get 36 servings. Next time I will try not softening the butter and using more flour. But I can only give the recipe two stars as written because I shouldn't have to read reviews to figure out how to make the recipe work.

These cookies are amazing! I used the top to a Tupperware pitcher rather than a thumb or a chapstick, and I also put them in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to baking. I also used seeded, rather than seedless raspberry because that’s what I have on hand. My family has devoured them, so I may make them again tomorrow. Great recipe—thanks for sharing.

I made these with gf flour and was worried about the usual crumbly gf problem.  So I followed a few of the review suggestions in using a tad less flour and baking at a lower temp.  Definitely refrigerate dough after forming but before baking- I did a few each way and those kept form a lot better.  Tried using raspberry  and cherry jam and both were big hits.  A keeper. Next time might try a chocolate glaze.

These are really good. I had no problem with them staying up or leaking. I used cold butter which I cut into 1/2 inch cubes. I did lower the oven temp to 340degrees. I used my thumb to make the indent but then molded the cookie around my thumb before I took it out of the cookie so that the walls were solid.  I placed 1/4 teaspoon of jam in each cookie.  Cooked them for 13 mins. I did use parchment paper, really didn't need it cause no leaks.

I made these cookies and followed the directions.  The dough had difficulty coming together.  It seemed like there wasn't enough liquid for the flour.  The cookies turned out flat in the oven although I had clearly made a thumb print in them.  I will not make them again.

Great recipe! Add that 1/4 extra cup of flour like a previous user suggested, and chill in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking and the results are amazing! Crowd fav at two different events! Such a simple coooke but so delicious!

I made these for the first time tonight.  I made the exact recipe and they turned out perfect.  The only advice that I followed, which I have found is common with shortbread or sugar cookie recipes, was to refrigerate them before baking.  For some reason, this does help them bake in full form and not spread out.  These were so easy to make and taste amazing!

I used Smucker's strawberry jam and sprinkled with red decorating sugar.  Baked 13 minutes. They were set but not golden but I took a chance and took them out of the oven anyway and let them sit on the cookie sheet a few minutes before transferring them to cooling racks. They turned out perfect! Absolutely delicious.  Everyone liked them so much I made 2 more batches immediately.

The dough ended up being very dry and wouldn’t actually form a ball so I added a tbsp of water. I read the reviews before making and I chilled the cookies for about 10mins before baking, I also lowered the baking temp to 340. 
These modifications made them perfect

Fantastic shortbread cookie.  The only change I made was using cherry preserves and the cherry/almond combination is AMAZING!  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe! Subbed vanilla extract for almond and they turned out fine. If you roll tablespoon-full balls, they will spread and seem much bigger than the quintessential "thumbprint cookie"...next time I will refrigerate the dough for maybe 30 minutes, but even though they did spread, they weren't awful looking or horribly flat. The cookie is amazingly tasty and I did not have raspberry jam but I used cherry preserves, blueberry preserves, and strawberry preserves. They all turned out great and I can't wait to make more. I saved my hubby 2 of each flavor and he demolished them. Thank you so much for a great addition to my recipe box!

Excellent!! Be sure not to crack the dough when making the hole for jam & don't let jam trickle down the sides of cookie before baking them or they will burn. I use my pinky finger for the jam hole for small cookies. They came out perfectly.

I had s really difficult time with these cookies. I took the highest rated reviews advice on the extra flour and that may have been the problem. My dough was very crumbly and hard to form into balls. I could not make any indentions to insert the preserves prior to the first bake. I baked about 15 minutes and was then able to put an indention into the cookies, insert preserves, and I baked an additional 10 minutes. The end results were very good, just took a lot more time and effort than anticipated. I’ll try them again for sure, and hope I come away with an easier method.

Followed reviewer’s suggestions to increase flour, lower oven temp and use cold butter.  I used unsalted butter so I added 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  The dough was light and wonderful to work with - not sticky.  I make hundreds of Christmas cookies every year as gifts and after 20+ years of doing so, my husband claimed this was THE BEST cookie I’ve ever made.  (Not sure what to think of that, but I’ll roll with it!)

These cookies taste and look great!.  I read the reviews and followed the advice to chill the dough before forming the balls and after adding the jelly.  Those extra few minutes kept the cookies from flattening out.  Next time I make them I am going to try lemon curd and a little lemon extract in the icing.  My family loves them!

I made these last night. They turned out amazing even though I kinda screwed them up. I got busy with the kids in the middle of making them and I quickly put them in the fridge for 15mins to chill before baking before putting the jam in them. I took them out of the fridge, realized they were super hard and I couldn't make the indent to put jam in them. I let them sit for 20mins, made the indent while the cookie crumbled, filled them with jam anyways, put them back in the fridge for 10mins, and baked them. They turned out wonderful in spite of my mistake. Great recipe! Will make again!

Absolutely amazing cookies. I made the dough exactly as described and it's beautiful. The one difference is that after reading some reviews I formed the dough into disks rather than balls and used my measuring spoons to create the depression for the jam. Then I froze the dough for about 15 minutes before filling with jam and baking. None of my cookies leaked and all came out beautifully. Also you can make this with any tart jam you want. I used Marionberry, a type of blackberry and it was freaking amazing. I'll definitely make these again.

I did as others had suggested, used a chapstick lid to make the hole, used a plastic bag for the jam, and placed the cookies into the freezer for 15 minutes prior to baking. Perfect!!! My husband said they’re his new favorite cookie!!!

The butter was excessive, the size was too big (luckily I made a few first and figured it out) and the flavor was unimpressive. I prefer my cookies less greasy and more flavorful than these. I will definitely not make them again. First cookie recipe I’ve made without eggs and maybe that’s what was needed here.

We made these scrumptious little morsels and followed the recipe to the letter with two small exceptions:
#1- we used lemon extract in the cookie dough recipe instead of almond extract.
#2-we used vanilla extract in the icing recipe instead of almond.
They came out perfect! :)

I will never make these cookies again.  As easy as the recipe sounds (few ingredients) the dough was super crumbly which made it next to impossible to form the balls.  I even added less flour on the 2nd batch and it was worse!  Then I made the mistake of adding a little water which only flattened the cookies like pancakes.  My suggestion is go for the more traditional dough recipes with more ingredients.

Easy recipe and the cookies taste great too! Made mine with blackberry jam and drizzled the glaze decoratively on the cookies. Bake sale ladies were so impressed with how great they looked. Not bad for a guy just getting into making cookies!

I used strawberry jelly on half of the cookies and boysenberry preserves on the other half. Both were exceptional, so it really doesnt matter what jam is used. Go with the flavor you like.

I use maraschino cherries rather than jam. Also form the cookies and refrigerate for an hour prior to baking to make sure they don’t flatten.

These cookies are fun to make and funner to eat.  I make them every Christmas season for our work parties.  They’re always enjoyed.  And have fun with various flavors—I usually make sure to have some blackberry and raspberry, but I’ve used apricot, strawberry, peach, and blueberry as well.  Next time I’m trying cherry.  It’s the almond that compliments the fruit so well.  But the best flavor with these is black raspberry.

I love these cookies! A co-worker brought them in one Christmas and I went home and made them for my cookie tray. I used a different recipe the first time and I was so disappointed. The cookies spread, the filling leaked, problems others had. I found this recipe, the tips from others, zip loc baggy for jam and icing, freezing cookies before baking, lowering oven temperature a bit, chapstick cap for indentations. SUCCESS! These are now on my cookie tray list every year. Reading the reviews on this site are extremely helpful, thanks to all here. One thing I would like to share, I bake several cookies with almond extract. Use pure almond extract, not almond flavoring, there is a difference in taste. Almond extract and raspberry, a flavor match so delicious!

Used 1 1/2 X Amaretto vs Almond extract, added 1/4 cup flour, speed bake at 350. Made 20 cookies. Look like the picture, taste great. 2x liquid to make the frosting drizzle.  Thanx for the tips on the original recipe. Mad scientist!

Delicious! I'm not normally a fan of shortbread, but the spot of raspberry in the middle made these just so delicious, and then the glaze drizzled over it was super yummy. The serving size was off, though, for me. I tripled the recipe, intending to hand these out for Christmas, and when it was tripled, I had only 75 cookies (was aiming for over a hundred). Will quadruple next Christmas, but definitely making these again. They're good!

These cookies always turn out amazing! I'm allergic to almonds, so I just use vanilla instead. Friends I've shared this with really enjoy these cookies! It's also great with blackberry jam, salmonberry jam, and especially thimbleberry jam!

You need to chill these, or else they’ll spread. Also, if you don’t roll the balls quickly, they’ll liquefy in your hands! They’re a bit too crispy for my tastes. Next time I’ll try a recipe that includes egg and some leavening.

I have made this cookie, using this recipe for years - making up to 20 dozen at a time - I also like to read reviews and am not against  tweaking a great recipe to make it even greater! That being said I double this recipe and use 3 sticks of butter and 1 stick of blue bonnet margarine, I add 2 egg yolks and 1 teaspoon of baking powder.  I bake at 340 for 12 minutes and let rest on cookie sheet for 2 minutes.  I do use a chapstick cap - and with those changes my cookies don't crack, I don't have any need to put the sheets in the refrigerator or freezer.  I do put the jam in the microwave for a bit to soften up a bit and use a metal baby spoon to fill the cookies.  They come out absolutely perfect every time - even on a rainy day!

very good. The butter taste in the shortbread was a little strong for me. I used a teaspoon of jam in each cookie and did four different kinds of jam. My dad likes the strawberry kind best, but i prefer the peach. 

Definitely chill before baking, otherwise your cookies end up FLAT. And don't skimp on the glaze. It makes these cookies. 

Overall, very good, even if it wasn't my favorite shortbread cookie the rest makes up for it.

Although this recipe was good, I’m a bit dissapointed because they didn’t have that smooth, melt in your mouth shortbread texture. However, on the plus side, they taste good and it is super easy to make and requires little ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly, but found the amount of almond extract was WAY too much; particularly in the icing. Perhaps this is because I used PURE almond extract VS the artificial stuff.  Also, the measurements seem to be off, because the amount of icing sugar to milk ratio made a really stiff crumbly mixture. I just added more milk about 2.5 tsp. I would definitely omit the almond extract from the icing next time. The recipe made 17 cookies which was silly to have only 5 cookies on my 2nd sheet. Hindsight I would have portioned it out better to get 20 balls. The recipe says 36 servings...I don’t think that is even possible (lol), but the cookies are really sweet, so smaller portions would be better IMO.  To make the indentation, I used the back of a measuring spoon (1 tsp), and then used 1 tsp of ED Smith Red Raspberry jam to fill the hole, which worked perfectly! I found the dough cracked a bit but it was not enough to destroy the cookie. DO NOT drizzle the icing while they are warm, you will get a messy melted looking cookie. Let them cool completely, despite what the recipe says. Next time, replace flour with 1/2 cornstarch for that melt in your mouth texture. Replace sugar with 1/2 cup confectioners sugar.

These have become a classic staple at our house. That being said I do not always use raspberry preserves. I do much of my own canning every summer/fall, and I make these with an assortment of homemade jams/preserves to include strawberry, blueberry, blueberry rhubarb, strawberry rhubarb, cherry, and plum.

I've been making this recipe every holiday for years, and they're always the family favorite! Personally, I've always followed the recipe exactly and never experienced any problems with it. They rise perfectly, and as long as you don't overfill with jam, they look just like the picture!
This is my favorite recipe out of any desert I've tried by far. The only partial downside is if you don't mix SUPER well, the dough at the bottom is extremely crumbly and doesn't really stick.

These cookies are amazing. But it takes so much time to shape them and do the thumbprints and then the jelly. I like to take a short cut and make them into bars then follow the same steps. It makes them so much easier and just as good.

The first few times I made this cookie I follow the directions exactly and they turned out perfect. The last few times however, they all went very flat. This time around I tried swapping out a half a cup of the all purpose flour with a half a cup of self rising flour and that did the trick. I also dropped the temperature 10° and chilled the cookie sheet before I put the dough on it. Now they are not only delicious they look great as well!!

These are the absolute best shortbread cookies and this recipe is my go to.. You do not want a cake texture to these.. Because if they were then they would no longer be considered shortbreads.. A shortbread texture is crop crunchy and a little crumbly but not overly so or hard.. I personally do not understand how anyone has a problem with this recipe.. Basically just make sure your filling is appropriate in proportion to your hole.. And keep an eye on your cookies while they are baking.. Cooking is not an exact science but baking is.. Measure properly.. And yes chilling your dough helps..

This is a very nice recipe and we will definitely make it again! We doubled the recipe and it came out great! We cooked some with the Raspberry Jam and some without, and they came out fine. The ones without the Jam spread out more, and we used a butter knife to spread the Jam on.  We tried to do the drizzle, but it didn't work out. Would recommend putting in a little more milk or some water to thin it out, and you have to mix it a lot! But overall, these cookies are great and would definitely recommend them.

I actually cook the cookie without the jam in it.  Once the cookies are cooled, I heat the jam up on the stove and spoon the jam into the cookie.  Otherwise the jam 'stains' the cookie when it's cooking and sometimes breaks through the bottom.

These were really well-liked at the party I brought them too, I can't wait to try it out with different jelly varieties. 
Tips:
-Roll the balls of dough then chill in the fridge on a tray for 15-20 mins before baking. Cool down the sheets in between batches to reduce spreading (I just stuck them in the freezer while another batch baked up)
-I tried another suggestion here and used a wine cork to press holes into the cookies. This was really helpful to get a relatively uniform shape, and a nice deep crater for ample jelly. 
-Use a pastry bag with a round tip to fill the holes with jelly.

I loved making this! Since I don't like almonds, I used vanilla extract instead.  And it turned out great!! Everyone in my family loved them, and they can't wait everyday to have one! I had lot's of fun making this and will definitely make it again!

These were amazing. We had different kinds of jelly in the house so I made a sampler platter of grape, cherry, orange marmalade, and no filling. I still can't tell my fave.

They took a bit longer to bake but turned out delicious. I added a fresh raspberry to the top of each cookie to make them even more festive.

These were great at our Memorial Day picnic! Easy to make, and I used raspberry  preserves and boysenberry (seedless) jam. Tip; I use the back of my measuring spoon ( 1 teaspoon) to make indentation for the jam/ preserves. It makes more of a circle than a regular spoon. They came out perfect, the white icing was festive too, for keeping with a red,white and blue theme. Will make them again for 4th of July!

I followed the suggestions of using cold, not softened, butter, lowering the temp in the oven by 10 degrees, and putting the cookies in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before baking. They were wonderful cookies!! Really good! I even made my own lemon curd and tried that and wound up with mini-tarts. Deeeeeelish.

I only gave it 3 stars because I used margerine. I suspect if I used butter it would be 4-5 stars but because of having cholesterol problems I used the margerine.

OH. MY. YUM!! I made a few changes because I did not have any almond extract, so I used vanilla extract. It did not change the batter whatsoever. I also changed the sauce that I used. I made the powdered sugar and vanilla mix but I wanted a thicker type of drizzle, so I warmed up some 3 squared of the white bark chocolate with a little milk to thin it out to pour.  It was SO good! I figured white chocolate drizzle would taste good because it was raspberry and those two go together very well! 

Hope you like it! I know I sure did, and I WILL be making this again! :)

Replaced the almond extract (not a huge fan) with vanilla instead (~1/2 - 1 tsp), added 1/2 tsp salt (i used unsalted butter) and an egg  after creaming the butter and sugar together. 

It was good but sweet - since you are adding jam, I'd probably cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup next time. 

If you like a "chewier" and cleaner jam finish, you can heat it on the stove for  ~5 min beforehand to reduce the moisture content before piping it into the thumbprint wells. It does spread, but I prefer that shape as it reminds me more of the Pepperidge Farm Verona cookies, instead of a tall, thick cookie.

These cookies are delicious. I followed the recipe and used some of the suggestions from reviewers. I used cold butter (not softened or melted) and put the dough in the fridge for about 4 hours. My cookies did not flatten at all! In fact, I rolled into balls then flattened each one with the heel of my hand before making the hole with the chapstick cap.

The cookies were easy to make but I wish they had a bit more almond flavoring.  I also used a seeded raspberry jam, which I didn't realize when I bought it, so the texture was a bit not what I was expecting.  Overall a good recipe that I would make again.  Everyone loved them!

Followed recipe as printed.  Cookies turned out perfect and are delicious!!  I did chill dough while oven preheated and between batches.  No flat cookies here. I put jam and icing in separate icing bags for easier filling and drizzling.  I did need to add little more milk to icing to give better drizzle consistency.  Can’t go wrong with this recipe...YUM!

The cookie was easy to handle and baked up very well I just didn’t think the cookie was very flavorful. The drizzle of icing was definitely a plus.

Nice texture.  I would reduce the almond extract just a hair in the glaze.

These are so delicious! I've made these several times now & they are always gone before any of the other cookies I make. Best things I've learned from other review is to put the jam in a bag to fill the cookies. It really looks a lot better than spooning it in.

This will be added to my must do for Christmas list.  I used blackberry-strawberry jam, and they were terrific!

These were so good…melt in your mouth shortbread with just the right amount of sweetness!   I used a russian tea icing fitting to make the indentation in the dough.  These didn't last an hour at the party!!

I made a couple of different versions.                                                   1. I did a sugar free version with splenda baking, I used blueberry Jam.    They come out fantastic.                                                                      2. I did some with rum extract and cinnamon drops and they were the best of all!

Everybody loved these. Like some others my cookies spread out and the jam was all over. I am making them again today and will try putting the cookies in the refrigerator, for 20 min and then into the over.  These are so delicious. My boyfriend now wants them rather than chocolate chip cookies!!

So I did follow the recipe exactly and they did spread out . The  second time I made them I made the balls smaller and they were ok.  Third time I made them, I made sure I used the right seedless raspberry jam. They  turned out good. I Still want to perfect them though!

I made these cookies for my neighborhood's christmas cookie swap party, and got great reactions from everybody! The only thing is that I think that the frosting recipe needed a bit more milk than specified, I added a few extra teaspoons in order to make the mixture fluid enough to pour over the cookies. I would recommend 3 teaspoons of milk. Otherwise, awesome recipe!

This is a greet recipe and will be a new go to every year. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and is delicious with coffee. I ran out of raspberry jelly (I used Bonne Maman raspberry jelly; it has seeds but that didn’t bother me) for the last few cookies so I used lemon curd and it turned out so good! Looking forward to finding new variations...

My favorite cookie! No icing needed! Maybe a little powdered sugar. Letting the dough chill in the fridge for about an hour really helped.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it tastes GREAT! They tend to crumble a little on the sides when you push the centers down which was a little annoying. They don’t look perfect but they do taste very very good.

The. cookie recipe is great as is. However, I left it in 13 minutes vs. 14 to 18 and they were perfectly chewy. It is also important to follow the recipe exactly or it will be dry and crumby. DO NOT USE THE GLAZE! It tastes like alcohol and is a crumb consistency if followed exactly, rather than a liquid glaze. I left the cookies as is and did not use a glaze.

These were easy to make and they were so soft and yummy. The almond flavoring and glaze makes them unique from other thumbprint cookie recipes. I made these for a cookie exchange and got rave reviews with several requests for the recipe. I'm sure that if you don't have any almond flavoring on hand they would still be delicious.

Added a 1/4 c more of flour to prevent spreading 
And didn't pre soften butter. Perfect ty
After changes wasn't necessary to chill dough or cookies.  Recipe can be tripled no problems! No flat saucers!

A family favorite for many years now! Easy to follow recipe and always turn out delicious. One change- instead of the icing, I do a drizzle of metled white chocolate over the top. Yummier and easier to work with than the icing.

I loved these.  We didn't have any almond extract (I'm not a huge fan so I rarely keep any on hand) so I used vanilla and they were still awesome.  I will try it with almond at some point because I actually think it would be great that way too.  Will now be a Christmas baking regular!  
Oh, we also ran out of raspberry jam with 5 cookies to go, so we substitued blackberry and they were good as well.

I used a teaspoon of almond extract.  Don't think these were wonderful as many have said.  They are pretty bland in my opinion.  We're easy to make and may try again sometime.  Also didn't even make 3 dozen, 27 to be exact.  Not sure it's worth it

These are just SO SO good! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used strawberry jam because that’s what I had. I was going to skip the icing but SO glad I did it! I piped the icing on and weighed each ball (0.22ounces) to ensure each one was the same. My husband said they look professional and taste like I bought them from a bakery. Goes with saying that I will be making these again!

Very easy to make and delicious.  I  baked half after chilling and half right out of the mixing bowl; had no problems with the cookies spreading whatsoever.  I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to the mix; which, BTW, easily formed a wonderfully workable dough.   My only issue was that I inadvertently bought spreadable fruit instead of jam; not sure if it matters, but it didn't seem to "melt" into the cookie.

I made the adjustments as recommended by MarcieJ and they turned out beautifully. I didn’t have almond extract so substituted lemon extract, and topped the cookies off with a lemon glaze made of confectioners sugar, lemon juice, and lemon extract. The cookies were awesome!

I made these twice.  First time, I added the extra flour and made them an inch and a half in diameter--they were ornery little concrete stinkers that cracked and let the jam leak out, plus they were BIG, which was not what I wanted.  Second time, I mixed as directed and dropped the dough with a cookie scoop that holds about a teaspoonful.  I made holes with the Chapstick lid and put the jam in a plastic bag and squeezed it into the little holes.  I got about 80 two-bite cookies from a double batch.  Always use parchment paper; you don't have to scrub jam off cookie sheets that way!

Delicious cookies... I did make some changes as suggested by others.  I added 1/4 cup extra flour to the dough.  I put the cookies (with the jelly already in them and on the cookie sheet) into the freezer for 20 minutes before baking.  I used the top of the almond extract to make a small "well" and piped in (from ziplock bag) the jelly.   They didn't flatten and they baked to perfection!  I only added a little jelly as I didn't want a jelly mess! I didn't bother with the frosting, they were tasty without it.

Made these just the way the recipe called for. Sprinkled powdered sugar on when cookies mostly cooled. I did refrigerate the dough for about an hour first. Made the hole for the jam with my index finger while gently squeezing the dough at the same time. Cookies did not spread out at all. Very good!

I made as written. They  taste great, but mine turned out flat. I think I made my dough balls too large also. Had some trouble with some of the dough being too crumbly. After reading the reviews, I will try again with  some of the suggestions. Thanks for sharing. It is an easy recipe.

These are by far everyone’s favorite at home and at work. However, how well they turn out really depends on the preserves that you buy. I like Dickinson’s. I tried Smucker’s Simply Fruit in a pinch, and they didn’t turn out nearly as good.

This is a very good recipe. I made the cookies just as the recipe called for. Like others, I put the cookies in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking. They came out lovely.

Delicious! These were very easy to make, and really, you can use any type of jam for the center! I’ll probably leave the almond extract out of the icing next time. Overall, amazing!

The only change I made to this recipe was to use Tart Cherry preserves (only because I didn't have the raspberry on hand) and I got so many compliments, and requests for the recipe, so I'll definitely be making this again.

The dough was extremely crumbly, to the point of being impossible to roll into balls. I ended up packing the crumbs into muffin liners on a baking sheet and putting a glob of jam on top. They look terrible and probably will taste bad because of the weird ratio of jam:cookie. I'm not pleased and am currently trying to pawn the cookies off on other people in my building.

Made these exactly as listed.  They were delicious.  Made half with raspberry and the other half with apricot jam Will be making them yearly from now on.  I did chill the dough for a few hours which helped them keep their shape.  Thanks for the simple, tasty recipe.

BEST COOKIE EVER!!!!  I followed the directions exactly, although I did take other reviewers suggestions about refrigerating them before baking.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon to make the "thumbrints" and they turned out beautifully.  On my next batch I'll be sure to fill the hole to the top as they look just a tad skimpy on the jam.  The flavor is amazing and I wouldn't change a thing!

Oh my goodness.  These are fantastic!  I followed the recipe but made a few minor changes that were suggested in other reviews.  I didn't soften the butter, added 1/4 cup of flour, and popped them in the freezer for about 10 minutes prior to baking.  They are sheer perfection!  I think I may need to figure out how to put a lock on my cookie container to prevent them from getting eaten prior to tomorrow's get together!  Haha.  This recipe is most definitely a keeper.

These were fantastic! The only changes I made were to put the cookies in the freezer for about 15 minutes prior to putting in the oven to prevent flattening.  Also, the consistency of my drizzle was way off so I added a couple splashes of maraschino cherry juice.

I think this recipe  the best cookie I have ever had, honest. I loved it but the glaze turned out a little sticky after a while. So to help that I added half a teaspoon more milk and made it right after I got cookies out of the oven. I also used  marschino cherries instead of jam.

Mine turned out great! Also, I only cooked them for around 12 minutes instead of 14-18 and added a little more milk to the icing mixture. My whole family loved them! This is a great recipe!

Completely melted in the oven. What a waste.
I'm going to try it again and lower the oven temp to 300°F and chill the dough for about an hour. Hopefully that will fix the issue.

I don't have almond extract but I do have vanilla, so I used that instead. They turned out slightly flatter than i expected, but  still very good.  My family found them too sweet even without the icing, so I tried adding a little less than a teaspoon of lemon juice, and I couldn't really taste it, so I made an icing using just lemon juice and confectioner's sugar. It was amazing on top of the cookies! Gave them a great kick, so I recommend adding a little lemon juice to the icing. They taste fine with grade and strawberry jam as well.

Everyone loves these cookies!  They are easy to make with the hand-held blender.  No fussing with mixing or dough.  A little time consuming rolling them all into balls.  

Can use any homemade jam you have on stock. We used cherry jam -- amazing!  

Haven't quite figured out how to make them look symetrical yet but nobody cares -- they disappear real quick anyways!

The flavors were really good but the cookie did not keep its shape, they flattened out while baking so some of the fruit spread leaked out.  Though not as pretty as pictured, they did taste good!

loved these cookies they turned out awesome and perfect.I bit too sweet for my liking as I usually tune down the sugar when I can.I have made thumb print cookies before making these and they are my favourite.IIf giving as gifts ( due to nut allergies) I always use artificial almond extract as it tastes the same and just as yummy ??

I made these cookies this year for Christmas.  Oh my gosh they were so good!!!    I used cherry preserves.  I took the advice of some and put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I baked them.  They turned out beautifully and did not spread out.  I wonder if the preserves could be added about half-way through the baking process?  The preserves did not ooze out of the cookie, but I thought by doing that, it would keep it more in tact and not so bubbly?  Thanks so much for sharing.  I will definitely be making these again (and again and again)!!!

I have been on a cooking kick lately, and these were nice and easy in every way! (Except I had trouble drizzling - but I think that was a user error, lol.) I personally am not a big fan of jam, or cooked fruit; I mostly made them for my family, and everyone said they were AMAZING. The only change I made was blackberry jam instead of raspberry, out of personal preference, but it seemed to be a huge hit! Only suggestions I would make is  1) Get one of those icing bags to drizzle, because the icing is kind of thick and that makes it really hard to drizzle. 2) Try to be a little conservative with the jam, just because a couple of mine dripped over the sides.

When I tasted these cookies out of the oven, I wasn't really impressed.  However, a day or two later, they tasted great.  They softened up a bit and were very good.  So easy to make, except for a little trouble making the raspberry jam fit neatly into the thumbprint, but that will just take a little practice.

Would give this 10 stars if possible. Make sure butter is really soft- batter will be crumbly otherwise. Even so, I still had to add 2 T heavy cream . This brought dough together! I used a high quality raspberry preserve- not jelly. Yummers!
My taste buds say this is bakery quality if done right as the taste and icing are soooo good!

Mine turned out fine--no more spreading than what I expected.I refrigerated them for maybe 15 minutes, already filled, and had no cookie sheet disasters or blow-outs. I will probably make them smaller next time. I found that a 1-1/2" dough ball made a fairly large cookie, not a small, delicate one. (My husband and son didn't mind that in the least! I'd just rather get more cookies out of two sticks of butter.) I used homemade lemon curd to fill them. 
Now, a word to people who change recipes and expect them to turn out exactly as stated: if you change ingredients, don't expect the same outcome. Yours might be better and might be worse, but it won't be exactly the same. Don't blame the recipe submitter if you choose to substitute. Frankly, after you've cooked for a few years, you'll learn what you can and cannot easily substitute. Raspberry to cherry filling? Yep. That works. Butter to shortening? Not always. . .  Besides, the fewer ingredients a cookie has, the more important using the BEST quality ingredients becomes. In a shortbread-type cookie, the point is BUTTER. Not butter-flavored Crisco, or oil, or whatever. Just butter IF you want them to taste like shortbread cookies. :-)

These are my favorite cookies. I make them every Christmas. Sometimes I make a batch with seedless strawberry for my husband, as I made them once by accident and he lived them. The strawberry is a little sweet for me though.

These are some of my very favorite cookies of all time!  My boyfriend absolutely loved them (and me for making them for him).  The second batch I left in for a little longer (18 minutes on the dot) and used a little less preserves (just a tiny dollop with a baby spoon), and they turned out even better than the first batch.  Gone way too soon, but so easy to make, I don't mind.

The recipe turned out pretty well. I decided to add vanilla extract with the almond extract. This caused the cookies to flatten. I saw in the other reviews people were having the same problems. The recipe always uses too much butter making the cookies taste like butter more than cookies. Other than this the recipe turned out ok.

This was a yummy cookie. I took other's advice and added 1/4 cup more flour to the batter and refrigerated the dough and jelly before baking. I think next time I would add slightly more almond extract for more flavor, and also double the recipe to make sure we had enough to share and also for ourselves.

Amazing ! I am upset with myself  for not having made this recipe til now..
I made it as is, except for using cherry preserves for the raspberry ones. I tried the opposite end of a wooden spoon to make the thumb print but the cookies were getting cracks in the sides. So I held the cookies in my hand and used my index finger and my thumb for the job and it worked better.
The  issue that I couldn't solve was in the baking step. The 1st batch spread little. So, I thought refrigerating the  already shaped and filled cookies for 1 hour before baking,  was going to take care of the issue. It didn't ! I really don't know how other cooks prevented that from happening  !
Never the less, these cookies still deserve 5?.

We make these every Christmas now. The first time we made them, I was hesitant about the raspberry jam, and started to substitute strawberry jam instead. SO glad I didn't! The raspberry balances to shortbread flavor perfectly.

Excellent little buttery almond pieces of Heaven!!  I followed the recipe as written then added another 1/4 cup of flour as suggested by another reviewer.  Also used the end of a chapstick to make the indentation for the jam, filled them (put the jam in a little ziplock, cut off a small corner, & piped it into the indentation - worked like a charm!), then put the cookie sheet  in the freezer for 10 min, then into the oven.  Cookies turned out beautiful, not flat, no jam all over the place, just perfect!  The icing really finished them off.  This was my first time making these - definitely a keeper!  Only thing I would do different next time would be to make the balls a little smaller.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Followed most of the review suggestions, and they came out perfect: used 1/4 cup extra flour; rolled into 1 inch balls; flattened balls ever so slightly & used a chapstick cap to make indentions (about as deep as the cap itself); used plastic baggy to pipe in the jelly; refrigerated unbaked cookies for 15 minutes.

They looked professional. Thank you to all the reviewers!

I baked these according to the recipe. They are delicious.  I used a measuring spoon and filled each cookie with a half teaspoon of jam.  Perfect amount for a pretty cookie.  I made one batch, and my husband said I needed to bake another one.

My family really liked these and they were fun and pretty easy to make. A baking purist would probably have a fit, but I went with half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco baking stick, because I feared the flat cookie problem others mentioned. They didn't spread out and tasted great (though can't say how the flavor would compare to all butter). I found that the glaze needed a bit more milk than called for, an easy adjustment. I would make these again.

I'm an  experienced baker, and never ever have I had a failure like this cookie.   The first batch (yes, I had to make two) "melted" all over the pan.  What started out as 1.5" balls with a thumbprint indentation filled with jam became a 3 inch flat cookie with melted jam running everywhere.  Into the trash.  Next batch, I took the advice of another reviewer and used firm butter in the shortbread and froze the 'indented' cookies before baking them.  I baked the cookie for half the time, then added a dollop of jam.  I lowered the cooking temperature and increased the second half baking time.  They looked nothing like the picture (I had wanted small, bite sized cookies) but they were tasty.  Much too much trouble for a simple cookie.  Can't recommend the recipe.

Made these for Christmas and they were wonderful! I used raspberry jam that was not seedless and it seemed fine. I also forgot to add the icing - next time I'll ice them and maybe add a sliced almond garnish. The shortbread was light, delicious, and perfectly flavored with almond extract, and the raspberry was nice with it.

The only change I made was adding a bit more milk to the glaze. Also be careful not to add too much jam into the depression- will boil and overflow.  I would definitely make it again -got  compliments at Christmas dinner.

Rave reviews from family and friends. I made them without changes, but found they were too big. The second batch I made them half as big and the size was good,  not too small or too large. I needed more milk in the glaze to make it drizzle and it is best to wait for the cookies to cool before glazing.  These are going to be in my cookie repertoire for sure!

Made these cookies with some minor alterations.  Halved the sugar, added 2 tablespoons of flour to the dough and omitted the icing glaze.  I also made the well of the cookie extra large so I could fill in more jam (the jam is the best part, right?).  The first time I made these cookies following the original recipe, my cookies were way too sweet.  The alterations made a huge difference.  Sweet, but not too sweet!  Love this recipe!  Easy, delicious and looks lovely as a gift.

Huge success. I refrigerated the dough as many others recommended and the cookies came out beautifully. I did have a challenge with the glaze; I followed the recipe exactly and it came out like thick glue. I tried microwaving it for ten seconds and that made it somewhat workable, but it was still thick and gooey; by the time I piped it onto six cookies the bag burst from the strain.  I tossed it out and dusted the cookies with sifted confectioner's sugar instead.

These tasted great! I added another 1/2 tsp of the almond extract b/c I like a stronger flavor of almond, but other than that I followed the recipe. As another user suggested, I added some flour and put the cookies in the freezer before baking. They came out of the oven perfectly round and not too flat. Overall a wonderful recipe!

So this is the second time I have made these.  This time I fixed them  just  as the recipe said to with one exception:  I used 1 tsp of vanilla instead of the 1/2 tsp of almond extract, and did the same substitution in the glaze.  They are  amazing!!! I just find the almond flavor to be distracting....

Made exact recipe and they are wonderful. Use parchment paper.  When making indentation to be filled with jam, use a chapstick tube or the top of a nail polish bottle.  Be sure that the dough is not cracked around the outside of the cookie before filling with jam.  That will keep the jam from spilling over outside of the cookie.  Do not overfill.  The jam will become bubbly towards end of cooing time.  I doubled recipe to save time.

They were pancake cookies!  I didn't read the reviews until I saw how flat they were. Definitely need to put in fridge for at least 1/2 hour before baking. They taste great, but not much to look at.

This cookie was such a hit I had to make a second batch so we would have some for Christmas Day!  The only thing I changed, was I used Lingonberry Jam to be a bit more Swedish??

What a pain, mess, etc. If I ever made this again I would be tempted to press it into a bar, "mark " it out with indents, fill it with the jam and cut it while it was hot out of the oven! Sorry, not impressed!

I make these yummy & pretty cookie every year at Christmas.   They always spread out too much.. but once I used the tip of putting cookie sheet in the freezer b4 baking & adding a few more tbs of flour...they're even better!   I use  red raspberry, strawberry & apricot jams & I too pipe it in w/a baggie w/tip cut off..as it doesn't go overboard & spread all over the cookie.... it stays  INSIDE the cookie! Yum!  Everyone goes for these 1st on the cookie tray! ??

This is a really easy recipe and its one of the best shortbread  recipes I've ever tasted. I followed the directions exactly. Make sure your butter is soft or the dough won't come together. I just used regular raspberry jam. Make sure the jam is out of the fridge for a while, its easier to pipe into the cookies. I put the jam into a zip lock sandwich bag and snipped the corner. I've already make this 3 times in the last 2 days.

Delicious little cookies! I listened to others reviewers advice and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and also had them in the freezer 15 minutes prior baking. It took 22 minutes at 325 F because I made the little balls kind of big, but the second time when I'll do these, I'll know to change that. I filled them with cranberry jelly (or jam?) that I've made for Thanksgiving a month ago and they go together absolutely wonderful! I wish I had more to fill them with cause, man, it's just yum! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

Delicious but they didn't hold their shape at all. It was   for a cookie exchange so I was disappointed and upset.  The flavor was great but no visual appeal.  I had to make another cookie and stuck to regular  thumb cookies. I should have read the reviews

This was a real crowd pleaser! So many people told me how they don't like traditional thumbprints, but loved these! I went easy on the almond extract for the cookies and icing. Instead of using my thumb, I used an olive poker for the holes. The handle is shaped like an olive and made beautiful 'cups' for the jam. Put some shortening on whatever you use. I used a small plastic baby spoon for the jam, nice and neat. I will make these again next year for the teachers and neighbors again!!!

I made the cookie dough according to the recipe, but took other reviewers' suggestion of freezing the cookies for 5-10 minutes before baking to prevent them from being flat. Mine turned out nicely.

I thought the flavor of the cookie was good, but the glaze tasted WAY too much like almond extract. Next time, I will use less extract and will thin with water. 

Also, if you want your glaze to sit on top of the cookie like in the photo, I think you need to put the icing on cool cookies. I put mine on warm cookies (per the recipe) and it kind of melted into the cookie. It's fine, but the photo is prettier.

I made this and followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added an additional 1/3 cup of flour and had no trouble with these cookies going flat.  You can use vanilla when you don't have almond extract - it won't alter the shape of the cookie but these cookies are much better with almond extract.  They also need a little salt.  Other than that, a decent thumbprint recipe.

These are absolutely delicious! I had a large jar of raspberry jelly that I needed to use because my kids didn't care for it on PB&Js. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderful. I will give you a tip, the recipe doesn't say what kind to use but I used regular salted butter and they tasted delicious. I'm going to make these again and use lemon curd instead of raspberry jelly.

I add 1/2 cup flour, also as suggested, use a chapstick to make the hole and put in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. I do let the cookies cool completely before I pipe on the glaze- otherwise the glaze spreads and is less visually appealing. The cookies are a fantastic, tender shortbread. I make them several times a year using my own homegrown, homemade raspberry jelly. They are a family favorite.

Let me start off by saying I'm not a baker.  I followed MarcieJ's hints and the cookies were a hit.  When I added the cold butter to the sugar, I pulsed it in my processor and that worked well.  I will definitely make again.  Thank You for the recipe.

I gave this 4 stars because the cook time was way off for my oven. I read the reviews and didn't see one about oven time. I also followed the other hints and put the cookies in the fridge and even then they still spread, but none of my jam leaked. I love the chap stick end hole maker and I didn't use the drizzle cause they were sweet enough for me. I did use almond extract because I love that flavor in this recipe. It's so yummy. These are really flaky and soft cookies. My favorite Cooke of all time. I use whatever jam I have on hand and they've always turned out delish. Thanks for the easy recipe.

I tried making these for a work party. I made the recipe exactly as written but they came out all flat and looked terrible. They tasted delicious and my husband loved them, so I tried again this weekend making some of the adjustments in other reviews - added 1/4 cup extra flour, chilled the dough. This time they looked great, but they were not as good tasting - a little too dry and didn't have that classic shortbread melt in your mouth feel. I think I'm throwing in the towel on this recipe!

These were delicious and easier than reviews had made it seem.  I was terrified my jam would leak all over the place but I used my fingers for the hole, didn't refrigerate it before baking but they turned out great!!  Will definitely make again!

I made these exactly how the recipe states and they came out amazing.  I chose not to do the drizzle because I like these without it.  This is one of my all-time favorite cookies and this recipe is perfect.  With a little practice they come out beautiful!

The cookies were light and buttery and very good!!  I did use vanilla extract and had no problems.  I made 3 dozen and refrigerated the dough between batches of cooking.  The cookies very puffy and definately not flat.  I think  a cool  kitchen is the trick to making puffy cookies!!

Like many others, my cookies went a little flat. Not so flat that the jam spilled over but enough that I won't be  bringing them to my office party this week. LOL! They are still very tasty and I will make them again using some of the suggestions from other reviewers. my husband and I will enjoy this first batch. Off to try them again. :)

Recipe was easy to follow and I took the advice from the comments to use a chapstick cap to make the hole for the preserves so it did not run.  I used seedless black raspberry preservers and white whole wheat flour.  Next time I will make my cookies smaller since I had to add more preserves after the cookies spread out.  I made the cookies for the office and everyone wanted me to make more.  I did not use the drizzle since I did not feel the cookies needed more sugar.

I decided to make these instead of my usual thumbprint cookies. I followed the recipe to the tee and they flattened out like pancakes I cannot put these on my cookie trays will have to go back to my tried and true recipe.

I added an additional 1/4 & tablespoon of flour, my dough was too sticky to handle(with the original recipe) . I also followed the advise of putting them in the freezer for 10 min before baking, and dropped the temp down 10 degrees the first batch, but at 18 minutes it wasn't done, so I turned it up to 350 for 10 more minutes. I kept it at 350 for the second, for 20 min. I omitted the icing because it was too sweet.

I made this cookies today. After following the exact recipe plus just cooling the cookies before baking, not only most of them came out running but also they were too sweet. I ended up skipping the glaze sugar for the second  batch of cookies.

The key is to whip the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Note, the recipe does not call for eggs or baking powder. Whipping the air into the creamed butter is what holds these cookies up and keeps them from going flat. Also if the batter seems too soft to roll into balls, mix in 1/4 cup more flour. Use the end of a Woden spoon and move it in a circle to make a hole for the jam. Doing the above, there will be no need to chill the dough or change the recipe.. this makes perfect thumbprint cookies every time. This is one of my favorite recipes.

I loved these also, and with a few changes that I hadn't intended to make, they came out well like a lot of the other reviewers had indicated.  I refrigerated my dough, which was not my intention to do initially, but circumstances made it so I couldn't bake them right away.   Then I added some chopped roasted walnuts to the dough, and that added a nice little texture and  crunch to them.  You do have to be careful to check and make sure they don't over brown, and I did have a few that flattened out a little, but for the most part they came out really nicely.   Will definitely make again.

Great tasting, they did spread though, even after I refrigerated the dough before cooking.  I didn't frost them,  I sprinkled on confectionary  sugar when cool.

These turned out very pretty and tasted great.  My family liked them and said this is a keeper recipe.   I took them to a Christmas party where 2 people asked for the recipe.  I did learn after the first pan of cookies to not overfill with the jam.    I had to add a little extra milk to thin out the drizzle.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe and i followed exactly what it says and the cookies turned out so beautiful as shown in the recipe .it's very easy to make . Took bit of time on how to shape the cookie and i got it right towards the end and it was much faster. I used a pacifier lid to make the hole to fill in the jam as it gives a great shape to the cookie rather than using the thumb . As i was pressing to make the hole i held the dough from the side to make sure it doesn't crack .. thank u so much for this recipe. It made my day .. :)

I didn't have almond extract so I used rum extract. The only thing with the rum extract is that it makes the icing drizzle a little brown but they taste great. I also used blueberry and lingonberry instead of raspberry. They are very good and easy to make. I will definitely make these again.

Followed the recipe exactly but the cookies turned out a bit big and spread when cooked. I should have made them a little smaller to be in proportion with the jam. Other than that, they were delicious!

Best almond cookies recipe ever!!!
If needed I would recommend to add 1 or 2 teaspoons of milk to the dough to make it stick together better.

I followed the recipe,and was skeptical at first,no eggs, no baking soda,no baking powder. Followed reviews, stating use object such as wine cork,to make the jam hole. Made them 1 and 1/2 inch balls, made jam holes and flattened  cookie before baking. The almond flavored shortbread is sure to become a family favorite.

Delicious and easy! I made just like stated, but turned oven down 10 degrees and cut butter up, so didn't soften too much. Dough was easy to work with then too as it was chilled. The cookies didn't go flat and are so delicious! Icing is great too. Will make again for sure.

These cookies are super easy to make and they taste great. My son (12) can't stop eating them! Made exactly as the recipe stated and they did not flatten. Used 1/4 teaspoon to scoop jam and it was the perfect amount. No mess. Used parchment paper and light colored baking sheets.

I put in for the recipe to adjust to 18 cookies (since there are only 2 people that live in my household i don't need an abundance) and they came out totally flat!!! i followed the recipe and while i was mixing the wet ingredients with the flour there was so much crumble in the dough that i didn't even finish putting in all the flour because the dough wouldn't stick together! they ended up turning out flat like a pancake!!

They tasted amazing but they didn't hold their shape very well. I will definitely be making them again with some tips from other reviewers. I will make sure the dough is cold. Delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Made 4 different cookies for Christmas cookie tray. Most everyone said this is their favorite. Mine do NOT look as pretty as the original pic but I try. Double the batch. 
Take the tips given by others:  Refrigerate the dough before baking, use a chapstick to make the hole, pipe the jam in and pipe the glaze. Wait until they cool before glazing.
I made these a second time and did add 1/4 cup more flour as someone recommended. They looked prettier and didn't spread as much.

Simple and fast to make but delicious and crowd-pleasing. You can make a really nice cookie display by making a single batch but using different jams and fillings.

Delicious! I've made them several times with different jams and jellies, always very good.  Tips for taller/better cookies: Make sure butter is not soft to the point of melting, it doesn't need to be super soft.  Use parchment paper.  Roll the cookies into a perfect ball and use the smooth end of a chapstick to put the thumbprint in to make an even, smooth dip in the cookie - but try not to flatten it much, it should still kind of look like an oblong ball with a dip in the top. Use a larger medicine dropper (not the small ones, look for one about 1 cm in diameter) to put the jam in the hole made by the chapstick. Then, place the pan in the freezer for at least 15 minutes while the oven is warming up. Cook and check on them 2 minutes prior to the end of baking time. If the bottom is already beginning to brown, remove from the oven and let cool.  The key is to freeze them before cooking! That will help not have flat cookies. :)  These are a go-to Christmas cookie for me!

Turned these into turtle shortbread...used vanilla instead of almond extract.  Baked them for 10 minutes and then pulled them out and added a rolo to the top and then put back for 3 more minutes...topped with a salted/roasted pecan immediately after you take them out of the oven. They were delicious! I might drizzle chocolate on them next time.

Followed many of the tips of previous bakers, pressed a hole in dough ball with a chapstick lid, applied jam with baggie that had the tip snipped off, chilled dough 15 min then baked it. Applied frosting with baggies also. Perfect, easy and very rich. Great looking on a holiday plate.

Easy and tasty.  My cookie did not spread at all except to puff up  and expand a bit.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 a cup since I add a lot of jam. What I found worked for me was making a dough that was a bit similar to soft pie dough (playdoh?). I shaped the cookies to a disc shape then used a bottle cap to make an indent since I like lots of jam.  The stiffer dough held the jam in place so no jam spillage.  I baked mine for 20 minutes since I prefer lightly brown cookie with a short and crisp texture versus soft and chewy.  

 I think those who have a problem with flour taste may need to bake the cookies a bit longer.  If the dough is spreading too much, then you may need to add a touch more flour.  Bland taste may be due to not enough sugar, butter, or bake time.  Cut the recipe in half and make a test batch if you are unsure.

These came out great for my first time. However I didn't start out with the electric hand mixer I thought I could just blend with a spoon. When it remained crumbly I looked at other reviews and some mentioned they added an egg so I did too. That brought it together. Turned down the heat to 330 and baked for 17-18 minutes. Used a lip balm cap to make the hole for the filling and yes you don't need much.

This is a family favourite! Everyone loves them and they are really easy to make. The drizzle takes them above and beyond other similar recipes.  Today I wanted to make shortbread with toffee bits in it, so I made this dough, and stirred in the toffee. I flattened them with a fork instead of putting jam in a thumbprint. They are great!

I did not like this recipe.  The dough was very crumbly, so it was difficult to shape into a ball.  I had less than the amount of cookies that it stated it would make.  I did put the dough in the fridge as per the suggestions, hoping it would help with the crumbly dough.  It didn't.  The  jam did not leak out though and they were not flat, and the cookie was tasty - however I would not make this recipe again.  I baked at 340, for 15 mins.  The colour was nice, icing was good, but I couldn't get past the crumbly appearance.

These cookies are pure genius! I didn't make any substitutions, but I accidentally used vanilla extract instead of Almond extract,but it turned out wonderful.Also I'm not a huge fan of frosting, so I didn't add any. Definitely don't regret making these cookies. This is also a very quick recipe.

EXCELLENT cookies, not too sweet.  In my opinion the cookies were bland, so I added some orange zest to the remaining batter and it BRIGHTENED the flavor and it was SUBTLE. Next batch I'm going to try lemon zest. 
After reading many reviews, I followed reviewer MarcieJ advice and put the cookies in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking, this helped IMMENSELY.  Good Luck! BTW my football Sunday crew LOVED these.

Very good! I would not bother with suggestions of using a chapstick cap or back of small spoon for prints, they just didn't look good to me and one of the spoon prints boiled over, my thumb worked just fine, just make sure you make it deep, that is the key here, and make sure you are using the 1 1/2 inch diameter balls as directed. I froze for 10 minutes as someone suggested (it makes the jam very cold and keeps it from boiling over, and helps the dough keeps its shape and prevents cracking during cooking), but I had to cook it for much longer than the 14-18 minutes (probably more like 18-20) and piped the icing which I also had to add about a half a teaspoon or one teaspoon more of milk to make it a runny consistency, following the recipe exactly it was like a sugar dough and not able to be drizzled. I added very tiny amounts of milk until it could be moved around, but was still quite thick, to where I  could easily spoon into a zip lock bag without it dripping anywhere (does not drip at all, stays mostly on the spoon and moves very slowly). They came out very pretty and most of all, delicious! I used a blueberry store jam that is made locally.

I made this for my family and they really loved it. If you're like me and really dislike almond extract, the taste of it in this is really unavoidable. 
The ratio to powdered sugar to everything else for the "drizzle" was way off. Luckily I was able to add milk until I got it to the desired consistency that hardened slightly after setting. Other than that, they came out just as described! The jam surprisingly didn't leak out at all. I ended up pressing the back of teaspoon measuring spoon to make some of the "holes," but the other times I just sculpted an opening with my fingers.

Superb cookies.  Easy to make and super elegant. I used seedless raspberry jam.  My friends and family loved these.

I made these cookies for Christmas gifts for my 3 girls' teachers, 12 boxes in total.   The cookies are very dry.  The texture holds the jam well, but they're not sweet at all.  The jam added a bit of sweetness and moistness to the cookie.  They were better day 2 and 3.  We ended up throwing out some of these cookies as no one in my house seemed interested to eat them.  I will try a sugar cookie recipe with jam next time.

I have made these twice now. First time the dough was very dry and crumbly. This time I thoroughly whipped the sugar and butter and then WEIGHED the 2 cups of flour (240 grams). That did the trick. Perfect consistency this time. I increased almond extract to 1 tsp....did not refrigerate.  Placed on cookie sheet without rolling into balls as I did not want the filling. They came out perfectly light and a delicate crunch. Then I drizzled with Lemon sugar frosting. (1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and juice of 1 large lemon) They are almost all gone!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  There may have been an altitude issue - the dough was so crumbly and dry that it was hard to work with.  There was no "rolling into balls" because it literally crumbled apart in my hands.  I had to smush it like play-doh instead.  And when I made the glaze as written, there was not nearly enough liquid - had a gloppy mess that I had to thin out a bit.

I think this recipe is also missing a shortbread essential - salt!

I will make this again, with less flour and adding a little salt to the batter.  Otherwise, a decent basic recipe - and again, the dry to wet ratio could have been off due to altitude (maybe?).

I followed this recipe exactly how it is posted. The dough was horrible. What did I do wrong. It was soo gooey, I had to put another 1/2 of flour and then I was barely able to shape them into balls. The glaze was gross. It soaked up into the cookies. What did I do wrong? I will definitely try a different recipe. Thank you.

I loved the shortbread cookie, but it was way too sweet with the jam in the middle. I think next time I'll add crushed pecans to the dough, flatten them slightly before baking and see how that works. A great cookie to build on!

Very easy to make, and delicious! I followed the advice from Marci J to add extra flour, use unsoftenede butter (harder to mix, but worth the effort), turn down the oven temperature by 20 degrees, and put the unbaked prepped cookies in the freezer for about 5 minutes before baking. Just make sure to remove them from the oven as soon as you see brown on the bottoms and/or the jam starts bubbling.

This is such a tasty and lovely holiday cookie! I followed the suggestion of other reviews and chilled the shaped balls of dough. I used almond emulsion rather than almond extract because its what I had on hand. I didn't bother with the glaze because the cookies were perfect without it.

OMG, so good! I substituted 1/2 cup of finely ground almonds for an equal amount of white flour. But I am sure that they are equally delicious if prepared exactly as written.  These are now on our family's holiday cookie short list.

Soft and chewy, great flavor. Wait until the cookies are cool to put glaze on or it will just be a puddle of glaze on the cookie.

I was very disappointed after spending the time to read so many reviews to have these cookies not turn out like I had hoped. The chap-stick lid idea was brilliant, as was the idea of putting the jam in a bag and cutting a small hole in the tip.  I am at high altitude, so I did add some extra flour to the mix.  I also chilled the batter before baking.  My first batch was flat and the bottom turned brown and cracked.  I baked them at 345.  They also seemed a bit greasy. For the second batch I changed the temperature to 350, but this just made the bottoms browner, and even more crackling occurred around the outside of the cookie. For my last batch I dropped the temperature to 340 and added even more flour.  The browning was slightly better, but they still were crackling.   Not sure what else to try.  The weather was overcast today, so I am not sure if that made a difference.  My family said they tasted okay, but they still broke apart and looked funny.

Worst recipe ever.  Cookies on the same baking pan came out different!  A waste of time and effort.  No amount of cooling or freezing dough helped. And the tip about using the top of a Chapstick doesn't work, the dough is either too hard because it is so cold, or too soft and the cap sticks.

For bakers who are having a problem with the jam leaking or whatever, here is what I do to make the cookies look better.  Make a depression in the center of each cookie with the end of a wooden spoon.  If necessary, when you take the cookies out of the oven, make a deeper depression and then fill the center with 1/4 teaspoon of the jam or enough to fill the cookie.

Love this recipe and it was a crowd pleaser. I felt like the mom in the rice crispy commercial.  Family requested I make for the holidays and I made a triple batch. Last time I made them with my smallest scoop and plan to make them a little bigger. Also, don't care for almond extract at all so replaced with lemon extract in the batter and fresh lemon in the glaze. So very good. Used raspberry jam.

Recommend:
put batter in fridge for at least 10 min before baking
need more milk for icing
half white sugar by half

I love these cookies! The first time, my dough was a little colder, so they didn't spread as much. If you like more of a delicate and flatter cookie, let the dough warm up a little (naturally), and the cookies will spread more. Also, I baked them for 10.5 minutes.

I used this instead of the raspberry almond bars recipe I have made for last 30 years... and these are so much better! I added a little extra almond to the dough and the glaze, and they are to die for good!  Also used Kerrygold butter, and it was still cool when I creamed it with the sugar; hard to make into balls because they sort of flaked apart, but they held together OK. 15 minutes at 350. Will definitely make again!

This is by far the best and easiest cookie that I have ever made and I am not a cookie baker.  This recipe turns out perfectly.  I used a strawberry preserve that I had on hand and I think it paired beautifully with the almond flavor.

I made these and took the advice of other reviewers and put prepared cookie in the fridge for 20 minutes before popping in oven.  They came out perfect.  To be noted, they took a bit longer to bake and for the icing I used 2-3 teaspoons of milk.

Flavor is great! I made the adjustments recommended by other cooks and added 1/4 cup of flour as well as putting the cookies in the freezer for ten minutes before baking. This worked great as they held their shape and looked beautiful. Next time I make them I'll probably make a larger and wider indentation, as the jam-to-cookie ratio could have been higher. 

These will definitely be a holiday tradition in our household!

Followed the recipe to a T.  Put dough in the refrigerator for 15 minutes as recommended. This dough is dry as dust.  I have no idea how anyone could roll it into anything.  I added a few drops of water just to get it to stick together. Impossible to roll into balls.  Just squeeze it together and try not to demolish them when you make the thumbprint.  Taste is fine but I won't waste my time with this one, again.

i loved them and so did everyone else but they didn't look as good and when i tried making them into balls they were to crumbly and when i made the topping it didn't end up going zig-zag it just spread out and made a mess :(

Delicious!  I made changes as  suggested to put  dough in freezer for 10-15 minutes before bake.  I have a convection oven  so I set temperature for 345 degrees and oven converted it to 320 degrees. After baking 10 minutes took cookies out and added more jelly to fill holes . Baked another 4 -5 minutes. I  reduced  almond extract to 1/2 tsp. for icing.

These came out awesome.  I used a chapstick for my indentation, you had to twist it back and forth to get it out.  Filled it with jam, put in the fridge for 15 minutes, then baked.  No problems at all.  12/22/18 dough seemed dry so added 1/2- 1 tsp water, made balls a little smaller 1-1/4".

First time making these and they turned out delicious. Only a couple of notes - they didn't turn brown as stated, but they were cooked perfectly. Also, the recipe doesn't yield 36 servings...barely half of that.  Will make again.

These are so good it's the second time I've made them this week.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using my middle finger to round out the centers. I also refrigerated for about 15 minutes before baking them.  I made sure not to fill the jam above the top so there was no problem with it spilling over.

These turned out beautifully. I followed the advice of others & turned oven down to 340. Also, increased flour eeeever so slightly. Also, put prepared unbaked tray of cookies into the freezer for 10 minutes before slipping into the oven. The result was a wonderful cookie that held its shape with no jam leakage. These are tasty little cookies! The addition of the almond extract really gives them that little-extra-something to take them from a 4 star recipe to a 5 star.

Made them today and they turned out great. I did chill the dough as suggested by others but that was the only difference from the recipe. I will differently make these again.

I skipped adding the icing and they are still fantastic! They turned out perfect, just followed the recipe as written, but left the icing off to lower the sweetness and used low sugar jams.

Wondering if the flat reviews are because of the baker's location...I made these as above and they came out perfect--no flat cookies. I'm in the CA desert on a cold (about 45°), dry evening. the house is warmed to about 70°. I did add the extra flour. I like these because they aren't too sweet (i used commercial 'simply fruit' so there wasn't a lot of added sugar)  In my opinion, the drizzle really makes them great. i even added an 1/8 tsp extra almond extract to the drizzle. i wish there was more instruction to the drizzle technique. i guess i'm sort of a novice baker and didn't quite know how to do this properly so i  googled for a video.

Light cookie. Took suggestion of starting baking first then push hole with Chapstick cap and fill with jelly. Not one cookie had jelly explosions. Definite keeper.

The only change I made was to use vanilla extract and to dust with powdered sugar instead of glaze, but they were perfect! I have never made thumbprint cookies before but after the first batch, I was making the little holes and filling them nicely. They were a delicate texture similar to madelines. Mine came out tasting like raspberry cheesecake. Great recipe.

I read the reviews and saw people made some changes, but I wanted to stay as true to the original recipe as possible. Doing this always let me know how I should tweak a recipe for my taste. However I did do one thing that the original didn't and that was before putting the cookies into the oven I allowed them to chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. They were perfection!

These are to die for!  I followed other's suggestions and refrigerated the dough 20 minutes before making them into balls and used a Chapstick to make the whole. The icing was very thick so I added another tsp of milk and it came out perfect. Will definitely make this again and again-so much fun to make!

I just made these for the first time. The recipe was perfect. I got 30 cookies out of the recipe. My only suggestion is to add more milk to the icing recipe. When I added only the 1 tsp, it was dry and didn't mix so I added a little more until it became somewhat thin, but not really watery. Excellent recipe!

Turned out fantastic! Made the dough balls smaller than in the recipe and still ended up with fewer cookies, but it wasn't a huge discrepancy. The dough was rather crumbly but not impossible to work with, and I needed to make significant;y more of the glaze to cover all the cookies. Overall, very happy with the results!

These cookies are VERY easy to make - just be careful to ad the correct amount of almond extract, as the taste can be overpowering. Going to try skipping the jam filling and trying chocolate next time!

I found that the recipe as written is a little too dry. I added about a tablespoon of water to the dough to make it less crumbly, and about two teaspoons of milk (instead of one) to the glaze. I used a plastic bag with the corner cut off to make filling the cookies easier, and did the same for the glaze. They taste great with just a few changes!

Don't think I'll make this one again.  The dough was really crumbly -- so much so that it would break apart when I tried to put the "thumbprint" in the cookies.  I finally took it and pressed it into my mini muffin pan.  After burning the first batch, I managed to make the rest of them work.  The taste was fine, but it turned out to be more fuss than I was looking for.  More moisture is needed, or perhaps less mixing?  I used my MixMaster.

I made these cookies this afternoon, and following the advice of other reviewers, I froze them for about 20 minutes prior to baking - the end result was pretty good. Although the flavour of the cookies is very good, the texture is more cake-like than shortbread like.

Great recipe with just a couple changes.  The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly and got the "saucers with runny jam" that were a little bland.  The second time, I followed the recipe with two changes: I added a scant 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and I formed the balls then refrigerated for 30 minutes.  The cookies spread a bit and kept their shape/height.  A little salt was just the thing - a great shortbread cookie.  Perfect with a cup of tea.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

I did them differently by using different extracts and without the preserves since I don't have any almond nor preserves in my house. Also I didn't make the icing either but when I used vanilla for the cookies they're amazing with hot chocolate but lemon extract cookies is yummy also haven't gotten to the almond yet but I hope I will soon.

Great cookie. Everyone loved them!   I thought they were a bit too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  They do grow a bit so make them smaller than you want the final product to be.  Yummy

These were excellent. I followed the directions exactly.
They were crisp, buttery and the almond flavor was delicious. I scooped out the dough with a tsp, so all the cookies were uniform, then used the round handle end of a wooden spoon to make the hole for the jam. i used seedless raspberry, orange marmalade and candied cherries. so i had 3 different kinds!

I didn't read reviews before baking these, but they turned out great!  I made the recipe exactly as written, no refrigeration, and used parchment paper. I used the small end of a melon baller to make the indentations. I used raspberry and apricot jams. I made them sort of big and ended up with 20 cookies. None of them spread out too much. I did have to leave them in the oven about 24 minutes because I wanted a little browning on top. They are perfect! Next time I will roll them in crushed almonds before baking.

I LOVE these cookies -- and so does the rest of the family!  Brought them twice for kids' school events as well, and they were a hit.  At the suggestion of a friend, I added lightly toasted sesame seeds on top prior to baking -- perfect!

Heavenly. Added one fresh raspberry (from our backyard) to the center of each cookie, right on top of the jam -- charming effect to this attractive cookie. Had no problems with them coming out flat, but I did not soften the butter.  After baking them with my daughter an hour ago, I just made *another* batch -- they're that good.  Kudos to Dee for this delicious recipe!

This was an easy recipie where the end product looks amazing, much more effortful, and tastes amazing. My husband's kids loved them. This will definitely be a keeper for me.

These cookies are labor intensive, but they are worth it! However, they are not that difficult to make. I followed others suggestions about refrigerating them and on average do so for 10-20 minutes. My first batch, which I chilled without the jam for roughly 15 minutes then I added the jam and put them back again for exactly 10 minutes to cool down the jam, came out perfectly round. The second batch which I assembled and chilled for exactly 10 minutes did flatten a bit. I want to think that it was the pan which is a light colored one which tends to get hotter than my dark ones....So I would say do the chilling in a 2 step approach first without jam for 10 minutes then fill them up and put them 5 to 10 minutes more in the fridge for optimal results. One thing I noticed was that I was having a hard time getting the dough to compact so I added 1 to 2 tbsp of water and VOILA! I could use my 1.5" scoop and ended up with exactly 36 cookies! My suggestion to mix the dough would be to use a pastry blender and use the butter straight out of the fridge but also cut them in small pieces. The temperature of the butter is the key for shortbread. If it is too warm, your shortbread won't come out right and will flatten out. Also add the extra 1/4 cup of flour to get them thicker and less prone to flattening out.
EDIT: I decided to try the recipe again following the recipe as is and the cookies came out a flat but not extremely. My recommendation is definitely go with the suggestions.

These were simple and fun to make with the kids because it has so few ingredients and were very hands-on.  I used a plastic bag for the jam with just a tiny bit of end snipped off so the kids could squeeze just the right amount of jam in each cookie without making a mess.  We also used the Chapstick tip.  I had to add an extra 1/2 C of powdered sugar to the frosting to make it stiff enough.  I think I inadvertently added too much milk.  We used a fork to drizzle but the bag trick would probably work a little better.

OMG...These were fantastic! Hugh hit with the few who were lucky enough to snag one.  I loved how pretty they were...really made my cookie trays gorgeous!  Sometimes pretty are not the best tasting...Not the case with these. YUMMY! :-)  Kinda a pain to make, but sooooo worth it!  Used wooden spoon handle to make indent.  Put glaze in baggie and cut off corner to drizzle glaze...I doubled the recipe and still could have eaten more! :-) :-) Lite, delicate, delish! :-) :-) :-) :-)

Easy, fast and delicious!!
I'm a novice baker and found it super easy to do.. The only bad thing about these cookies is that I loved them and I almost ate them all by self. Eating them the following day makes them taste better. Yummy

I liked this recipe. Easy to make, yummy enough! It was a bit too much sugar to my liking, but I it's my thing with all the recipes, always. So if you're like me, reduce sugar to 1/4 of a cup. Also, I didn't do the icing, still was delicious

These were by far the best edition to my Christmas baking list in 2014! Some I made as written, some of the dough I made plain without the jam.  Those I dipped half in chocolate or placed icing in the center and added sliced almonds.  THANK YOU so much for posting this recipe.

I made these for the first time and they were a big hit.  My husband don't usually like sweets except for chocolate chip cookies.  These are now one of his favorites.  Like other reviewers said, I made into balls and put them in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.  Took them out and used a wine cork for the center and then put the jam in a ziplock bag to pipe into the center.  Those tricks help a lot so you don't get the jam all over.  I also did use parchment paper on the cookie sheets to be on the safe side.  Great recipe.

The dough tasted wonderful, but the cookies ran flat in the oven, even though I put them in the fridge for 20 min prior to baking, as some suggested. After baking they tasted too buttery (I guess that is possible) and too oily in texture.

This recipe was delicious!! I didn't have any trouble with the dough and I had melted the butter, although not completely. I used a little medicine dropper/pusher to do the drizzle. The drizzle required just a little bit more milk. The almond flavor is subtle but distinct, and absolutely wonderful!!

Just made for the second time and they turned out beautiful like always. I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I used Welch's Red Raspberry spread, which seems to have a thicker consistency. Also, I make 1 1/2 times the glaze, when designing the cookies with the glaze I use a continuous line from cookie to cookie, which I find much easier. Everyone that has tried these cookies has loved them.

I tried the various hints to keep the cookies from spreading (my butter wasn't soft, refrigerated the dough overnight, and even put in freezer after shaping them), yet they still spread.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, used the end of a chapstick to make the indents, and chilled for 10-15 min prior to popping in the over per reviewer recommendations, and they came out perfect! Yum!

wow these were so simple and easy to make.  one thing that i found was that when you make the thumbprint, if it cracks make sure you redo that one or the jam leaks out when cooked.  I am going to skip the glaze as we found it way tooo sweet and too strong a almond flavor.  3/4 of a tsp is way too much for only 1/2 cup of icing sugar,  I also had to add more milk to make the drizzle work.

These cookies were so good.  My favorite from all of the cookies I have ever made!  The almond flavor was so good!  Will keep this recipe for years to come!

I made 2 batches for a holiday party in addition to other cookies like chocolate chip and tangerine butter cookies - these thumbprint cookies were the biggest hit by far! They came out amazing and tasted like they were bought fresh at a bakery. Will definitely be making these again!

I made these yesterday and everyone absolutely loved them!  Easy to make, and pretty to look at.  I did use the suggestion made by Marcie (December 2006)   Often when I bake, my cookies have a tendency to flatten out as she mentioned and her suggestions were spot on!

I have been making these cookies for years. They are EVERYONES favorites. They are even fantastic when made with gluten free flour. The only change I make is using water in the icing instead of milk. I have three tips. 1) Do not use cheap butter. Every time I've used Costco butter or off brands, the cookies spread out and burned on the bottom. 2) Use parchment paper. 3) Use jam with seeds.

Just completed a batch and my husband and I thought "very good".  Mine don't look like the pic above as the drizzle was messier.  I couldn't find seedless raspberry jam so I used Polaner All Fruit (seedless) and it worked great. A little less than a 1/4 teaspoon on each.  I used the top of the extract bottle to make my indent for the fruit and it was the perfect size. Used a melon baller for cookie size. Wish I had refrigerated before baking as recommended by Sherry G.  Then the jam might not have run on some. No problem though cause we'll eat those. Can't wait to share.

These are so yummy! I just made these with my daughter-- so easy and they taste yummy too.. Very tender crisp cookie.  Be careful not to press the cookie too much because they spread out when you bake them.  These are delicious!

These cookies are awesome,I love them.I am making cookies for Christmas and was looking for ideas.I came across this recipe and I thought I would give it a try.I made one batch and tried one,and I thought they were great,and then I made another batch of them.I did what many people suggested to do by putting the cookies in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking,and they turned out perfect.

LOVED IT! I'm usually in charge of making cookies every Christmas, and I decided to try these out this year. They are perfect! I used vanilla extract instead of anise, since I couldn't find any. My boyfriend loved them as well. Even my roommate had to comment on how good they smelled since he couldn't eat any.

You CAN use vanilla extract in this recipe, I don't know why others had trouble with that unless they used imitation vs real. I did use an extra bit of flour (1/4c) as previously mentioned just in case,and they came out just fine. If your cookie dough gets cracks in the sides as you form the depression in the center, its a bit too cold, use your fingers to seal those cracks or your jam will seep out.

Delicious but spread out. Wish I had read the reviews before cooking. Next time will take others advise and use 1/4 c. more flour, smaller cookie scoop and chill dough before cooking. Absolutely delicious.

I tried this recipe with Becel instead of butter because it is what I had on hand.  I really enjoyed this recipe. It was simple to do and fun.  I would recommend using butter if you have it because the taste is wildly different if you use anything else.  I still enjoyed them without using butter, but if you want to have the perfect little shortbread, you must use butter.

My husband chose this recipe for me to make for his birthday and I was skeptical at first because I am not that good at working with shortbread type recipes. But with a little help from some reviews of those who have tried before me., I was very impressed with how they came out! Very tasty, delicate, and pretty! I highly recommend refrigerating the dough for 20 minutes before forming into balls. That does seem to help with the handling and keeping them from cracking while baking. Also, dont over-fill the holes with preserves. I had a Nivea chapstick thing (long) that I used to make the holes and it did a great job because I had more leverage to twist the hole with. Turned out nice and round and deep enough to hold a good amount of jam. But you really have to treat these cookies with a gentle touch once out of the oven.  Dont man-handle them especially while they are still warm or they will break on you. I definitely recommend them!  They were pretty easy too!

A word of advice about cookies like these - do not substitute margarine for the butter; that will make them flatten out.  I made the dough as written and then tossed it in the frig for a couple of hours.  The dough got a little hard and I had to handle it a bit to get it softer - perhaps just an hour in the frig would have been better!  I used the handle of one of my kitchen knives to make the hole in the middle.  None of my cookies were flat and none leaked.  Make sure the cookie sheet is cooled before putting your second batch on it or you may see some flattening!  I did have to use more than 1 tsp of milk for the glaze.

Cookies came out really well. The only change I did was use strawberry jam. My family greatly enjoyed them. Will definitely make this soon again :)

These cookies were a huge hit at work! I think next time I might use a little less almond extract, just for personal preference. I substituted raspberry preserves for strawberry, simply because I didn't have any. They turned out delicious anyway! No issues with them being flat.

This recipe came out PERFECTLY. I used 1/2 tsp of lavender extract and 1/2 vanilla and I put peach preserves in the center (I really just made a completely different cookie). One thing that I think helped is that I added an egg yolk to the dough.. Delicious!

Fabulous cookies!  I made them for the first time when I was hosting Christmas at my house.  I made 7 different kinds of cookies and these were by far the most popular! I followed the recipe exactly except added 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond flavoring to the glaze.  Wonderful!  Today I am going to make them with lime juice in the dough and lime curd in place of the preserves.

First time baker. Not too bad. I used the end of a 1/2 tablespoon to make the indent. My jam exploded too after reading the reviews a lot of people had this problem. Although my jam exploded still came out pretty good.

We made these cookies for Christmas this year.  Loved them!  Took the suggestion from another reviewer by decreasing the oven temp by 10 degrees, added 1/4 cup more flour, and placed the cookies in the freezer for 10 mins before baking.  They turned out perfect!

I thought these were very good, simple cookies. I chilled the dough in the fridge as suggested in other recipes, and the cookies didn't become overly flat and the jam stayed in place. The icing came out in one big ball though, so I kept having to add milk to thin it out. I'd love to try adding chopped walnuts to this to give it a little something extra!

After reading other reviews, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour (but needed a tiny bit of milk for moistness), I rolled the balls small and used a chapstick to make the indentation. I then put them outside (it's winter in the Yukon...no need to use the freezer to chill!) for 10-15 mins and baked for 15 mins, turning pan around about 1/2 way through. They were so pretty and turned out perfect. Delicious!

What many people fail to realize when baking is that different flours have different absorbtion rates.  It is better to put in a little less than check the consistency.  If it is too wet than add more flour until it all holds together but is not dry.  Refrigerating any butter based cookie dough usually makes it less sticky and easier to roll into balls.  Also, chilling before baking helps them not flatten so much.  This is an exellent recipe.  I used melted white chocolate instead of the frosting for the tops.  I don't like almond flavor so I used vanilla and I always use brown sugar instead of white when I can, I just like the flavor better.  I have been baking for 50 years and I do know cookie doughs.

The taste was delicious!  Not overly sweet, but very buttery.  Followed others suggestions and made the cookies, then put them in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to baking.  Used small cookie scoop (2 tsp), yielded 2 1/2 dozen.  The "icing" measurements were incorrect.  I used 1.5 Tbsp milk to make it workable.

Instead of butter I used Margarin (I can't believe its not butter worked great). During the mixing of the butter and sugar I placed the mixture in the microwave for 30 secs to soften the Margarin further. I used a whisk to beat it till smooth. I then added the flour 'slowly' while whisking it in until the the last 1/2 cup I had to use a wooden spoon. Dough came out great and even the cookies came out fantastic with 2" dough balls (though I keep with 1 and 1/2 inch balls to make a better yield). Instead of a chap-stick cap I used a cap from a hairspray bottle (almost the same size as a chap-stick cap then measured in 1/2 teaspoon of Raspberry jam. I doubled the recipe and it yielded approximately 28 tasty cookies. Deeeeeeeeeelicious !!!

This is a decent recipe. I also had some spreading of jelly but my oven is terrible (in a rental). I cooked them at a lower temp and just remembered to take them out BEFORE browning. This recipe doesn't have eggs so there is no worry about getting sick if they are a bit under done.

Delightful! So easy and great flavor. I made them with my niece for Thanksgiving. They were a huge hit. My son begged me to make more because they were the first to go. I'm adding them to my list of Christmas cookies this year. The almond extract gives them a very distinct almond/buttery flavor. If you like almond you'll love these cookies. Great with coffee. Thanks for the recipe!

These were Fabulous !!!  I took the advice of others and put them in the fridge for about 15-20min before baking. Popped them in the oven and they turned out just like the picture. We included them on our Christmas plates for friends/family and they were everyones favorite :) Thanks for sharing the recipe

These were lovely! I used 1/4 cup of almond flour in addition to the 2 cups of flour and they came out fine. I also used blueberry preserves and added a little bit after they were baked because I was afraid to put in too much to begin with. Ive made these before (another recipe) and I always overfilled them and made a huge mess!

Love this! I substituted reduced sugar cherry jam as I had no raspberry but I think the raspberry will be even better as it'll be a tad sweeter (making a second batch as I write this). My husband and son couldn't get enough of it and were so disappointed when there were none left. The funny thing is that I don't usually like anything with almond extract but in this one it worked perfectly. And so easy to make. Thanks!

They are delicious!  I used the tube of chapstick method (thanks previous reviewer!) to make the hole in the cookie and used small spoons to put the jelly in the hole.  I will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are delicious!  Tips: use welch's natural raspberry spread. It did not run at all and tasted so good. Might be because no corn syrup.  Also, I had to experiment with almond amount because the recipe was unclear about quantity of almond in cookie dough as well as the glaze. Also I had to experiment with glaze because when I used quantities in recipe it was firm and not runny enough so I added extra milk. Cookies do flatten out but that didn't bother me.

It took me two batches to figure it out - I had to add a tablespoon of water to the mix as it was crumbly for me. I kept the rolled ball in my hand and then made the hole with chapstick tube. My hand kept it from being too crumbly and held the dough together. I did as suggested and chilled the dough before putting it in the oven. It really did stay puffed up and didn't flatten out.  I used melted white chocolate for the drizzle over the cookies. Very tasty! I'd make again.

I can't say how much I love this cookie! My husband doesn't like shortbread or almonds...but ate a plate full the first day. And asked me to make more. That doesn't happen often. Its definitely a keeper.

I Followed The Directions And After Reading Through A Bunch Of ReviewsThe End Results Were Pretty Good. I Did Have A Slight Issue Forming The Rolled Balls. But Overall, Cookies Were Moist And Tasty. I Did Take The Advise And STIck The Cookies In The Freezer For Ten Minutes. PresentatioN WIse  they Cracked Slightly But Over Happy With Recipe

The recipe was ok...flavor great...But I wanted something more with pizzaz so I left the almond extract out of the glaze and added 1/2 tsp coconut extract...the almond, raspberry, and coconut was a great combination.

Excellent cookie!  Made them for the first time.  One piece of advice - make the balls smaller than 1 1/2 inches - my cookies (while delicious) were way too big.  This is supposed to be a "tea time" type cookie - not a huge one.  Also, I only had unsalted butter but added maybe a pinch of salt - I didn't have any issues with taste/dough rising.  Great cookie!

Love this cookie. Pretty and actually very easy. I did add about 1/4 more flour and I used a rounded measuring teaspoon to scoop out the same amount each time. I rolled half into little balls and stuck them in the fridge while I rolled the second half of the dough. Once done rolling the first 1/2 of little balls were nice and chilled. I placed them on parchment to bake and since I didn't have a handy chapstick I used the bottom of one of my daughter's markers to make the indention.Came out perfect and yummy.

Tried the recipe. Loved it. Do remember to chill dough. Also for a little change of pace, I used sour patch cherry drops instead of jam. The kids loved it (me too!)

This recipe is absolutely foolproof. I don't do anything different to the recipe except besides the raspberry filling, I also do apricot and blueberry and they are amazing. Best thumbprint recipe in years!

Loved it. Followed it closely, but did NOT add preserves before baking. I used a baggie and piped the jam in AFTER baking. Also piped the icing sugar. The almond flavour in the cookie as well as the icing is lovely. I also pulled the tray out of the oven a couple minutes before they were done to "re-indent" the thumbprint, which I made with the end of my wooden spoon. Will bake these every Christmas. Might buy some mint jelly next time to make red AND green cookies!

I gave this recipe 5 stars for taste and ease in preperation. However, I found that if I refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours (or overnight) before making the balls of dough, the cookies hold their shape much better. Otherwise, they do tend to be a bit flat. Tried it with strawberry jam as well as a vanilla extract and blueberry jam variety...all were delicious!

I make these all the time! using Strawberry LOW SUGAR jam. They're delicious! I prepare them, jelly and all and place them in the fridge for maybe 15 minutes, so they won't flatten.

Too sweet.  The glaze is not able to drizzle with only 1 tsp of milk and 3/4 tsp almond.  The 3/4 tsp of almond is overpowering for the glaze and the cookies are so sweet that they don't need glaze anyways.  Otherwise they came out right.  I used home made cranberry which made them look festive.

My only complaint was the amount of almond extract for the glaze (too strong) other than that they were so tasty.
You can also create your own cookie shapes, excellent for halloween.

Delicious!  The texture is great!  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon extra to both the dough and the icing.  Also I followed the recommendation of chilling the cookies for a few minutes  and reducing the temperture to 340 to avoid flattening  ( I also had to bake these an extra 6 or 7 minutes).  I used the chapstick trick recommended to make the thumbprint.  These came out great and did not flatten!

I LOVE THESE! They are pretty easy to make, and are sooo yummy. They always disappear really quickly in my family! I like using Smucker's sugar free raspberry jelly in them. I've made these 3 times now. Last time I made them, hours after baking the jelly in the middle remained runny and wouldn't solidify, and I have yet to find out why this happened.. But they still tasted awesome.

Make sure not to fill the thumbprints too full with jam, it'll spread in the oven.

Great recipe. I've made it couple times and they are amazing everytime. I put them in the fridge before baking like others. And added more milk to the drizzle and put it in a ziploc bag and cut the corner. Amazing!

This is the 1st time i review a recipe but, after trying this cookie it didn't feel right not to say something.
I have always heard the term "melt in your mouth" but i haven't really understood it until i made this recipe, they were heavenly, i followed the reviewers suggestion and put it in the freezer before baking so it'll hold its shape, will definitly make again, thank u for sharing.

They tasted good but stuck to the pan and got really flat. I'll try making them again and hopefully they come out better next time

I tried this recipe and made it with a twist. Instead of raspberry jam, i put Pineapple jam, and instead of just plain milk, I added lemon juice. and let me tell you, my family enjoyed them.

I make these almost every other week! I vary the jam flavor, using apricot or rasberry and we get the best results every time. To cut the sugar content, I don't add the drizzle on top and they are still always a big hit at home and at work!

Okay.  I just made these.  I used grape preserves because it's what I had.  They are simply amazing!  I need to make the a little smaller next time, but they still taste wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very delicious and buttery. I would however say that the drizzled icing makes it a bit too sweet for my taste. I will leave that part out next time.

I made the recipe as written.  They were a bit flat and oozy so I put the dough for the second batch in the freezer after I pressed and filled the impression with preserve.  Chilling the dough helped it keep its shape while cooking.  I pull them out as they are barely browning. This is a keeper.

Love these cookies!!! The only thing I had to change was the amount of milk to make the glaze... I ended up using 1 TBSP rather than 1 TSP as the recipe calls for.

These little cookies are PHENOMENAL!! The almond flavor makes these. They do flatten out while baking, so pop them in the fridge for about 10 minutes before baking. Other than that, they taste oh so delicious.

These tasted great but they spread out and didn't stay in the shape of thumbprints. I put them in the fridge like others suggested after assembling.

What did I do wrong????? The dough would not come together, so I put it in the frig. and still won't. I did cut cold butter into the sugar and then used the mixer on the rest. Was this it? Hoping I can post this without leaving stars cuz it seems to be just me?

I followed the recipe, but refridgerated the dough for at least an hour. Using the chap-stick tube to make the indents and I put the jam in a bag, cut the corner and squeezed the jam in the indent. I also use parchment paper. I've used melted choc for drizzling too. These always turnout great, I even used apricot jam for a pretty color combo. Geat recipe, thank you so much!!

VERY good cookies!  They are a nice, crunchy shortbread, not soft, which some people (like my husband) do not appreciate.  I love the hint of almond flavor in the dough.  I rolled some of the balls in sugar before filling them with jam and that was nice, especially since I chose to leave off the glaze.  My tips are to fill the thumb print with more jelly than you think you will need, and bake until the cookies are light golden so they're firm enough to hold up to the wet jam.  Made mine 12 hours ago and they're still just as crisp as they were with no signs of sogginess from the jam, but that may change.  Regardless, these are definitely a repeat for me and maybe next time I will try the glaze!

These are delicious! But don't press your thumb in too deep otherwise the bottoms will almost fall out when they bake and spread out. And definitely wait until you see golden brown. I took mine out just too early so that also made the bottoms not set up fully. But the next batch I got just right at 18 minutes and they were absolutely delicious!!

These cookies are delicious! They melt in your mouth and disappear from the cookie tray as fast as I can make them.  The only thing I highly recommend is to chill your dough for at least an hour, but overnight worked best in my case.  The cookies turned out pretty flat when I didn't chill the dough.  Once the dough is very firm and chilled, roll them up, use the end of a clean pen or pen cap to make your hole, and fill halfway with preserves.  I added more preserves once they were out of the oven, waited a half hour before drizzling with icing, and everyone asks me for this recipe now. Just minor tweeks to this fantastic recipe is all that's needed!

Very good and such an easy recipe.  One reviewer mentioned not softening the butter and just cutting it into the sugar as one method to ensure cookies aren't flat.  I can not stand cutting in butter so I opted to just go with the original recipe first and I am so glad i did cos they turned out perfect without all that work.   I made small balls and used a Chapstick to make the indentions.  I didn't fill the indentions completely full, worried that they'd overflow, and now I know to fill them completely full cos the holes do open up more when baking.  I put the prepared cookies in the freezer for at least 10 minutes before cooking.  I think that is what made them hold up so well. I was really worried about overcooking them and I think I took some out too early.  Next time I will wait til they get obviously lightly browned and then take them out - or else they are too fragile.  Around Christmas time I plan to add green food coloring to the icing and these cookies will be real festive then.  Oh, and I had to add quite a bit more milk to the icing to make it runnier - put it in ziplock Baggie, cut corner, and piped icing on.  Next time I might add just a touch more almond extract too since I'm adding more milk.
Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This recipe was very simple, easy to make, and delicious.  Cookies are soft and delicate and not too sweet.  We made a double batch and used blackberry, boisenberry, apple, and strawberry jams which were all very good.  The cooking time was a bit off.  I found I needed to keep them in the oven for about 25 minutes instead of 18 minutes.  Oh, and my 9 year old daughter absolutely loved making the thumbprints and filling them!!!

I made theses twice and did not like them.  They were greasy and had very little flavor.  I did use almond extract and not vanilla so that was not the problem.

Really tasty! Made recipe exactly as stated. Didn't take the time to refrigerate dough before baking. Didn't have any problem with spreading. I made small cookies - probably 1 1/2" in diameter before baking. 

I didn't have a chapstick lid with me, so used a wooden spoon handle to make the "thumbprint." Worked great.

Easy and taste fantastic! I used my pinky finger to make the hole in the center which worked perfectly. I made exactly as directed but added double the milk in the glaze and poured the glaze into a small plastic baggie and made a TINY hole in the bottem corner to make a great drizzle size. Defintely wait until the cookies cool completely before glazing to keep it looking pretty.

I live in a hot & humid country. Nearly all cookie recipes I have come across requires me to add more flour. If I didn't, I'd only get a thick batter and a dough would never form, even after refrigeration. Same goes for this recipe, it needed an additional 1 cup of flour & refrigeration to get it to a workable consistency. Other than that, I would have used vanilla extract instead. To get the almond flavour, I rolled the dough in toasted almond nibs before making the indentations. I would make this again :)

Awesome, awesome, awesome....These cookies were super easy to make, my 2 year old helped me and had a blast making the thumb imprints and filling them with our homemade raspberry jam. They were the perfect consistency and perfect amount a sweetness. The blending of the almond and raspberry flavors will blow your mind! I will continue to make these for years to come! (I followed the recipe exactly except adding 2 tsp milk to the glaze to thin it out a bit)

I put half almond extract and half vanilla because the full amount was too strong. Otherwise it was very good.

wonderful recipe but I substituted raspberry preserves or you can use the solo raspberry filling as I do in Kolachkys to avoid the spread of jam.  I've also used allfruit preserves - Yummy

These cookies were so good! I'm not usually a huge fan of cookies with fruit or jams but I was in the mood to try something new and stumbled upon this recipe. The almond extract gives the cookies a very nice flavor! I will definitely be making these again in the future! Thank you for the recipe!

I haven't try one baked yet but if it is 1/2 a good as the raw dough, I know it will be great.  I used the back of a 1/2 tsp spoon to push in and used the same spoon to fill with strawberry jam.  this make more consistant look.  My mom made this recipe at christmas and used alternating green and red marachio cherries for a more festive look

Great cookie.  I substituted raspberry cake & pastry filling for raspberry jam.  I put in refrig for 15 min before rolling into balls.  I used my tip of my little finger to press into the cookie.  I did not have any problems with the filling running.

Fantastic!  Rolled in chopped pecans/almonds mixture.  Used apricot jam.  Delish!  Took a pic and sent to my SIL - told her they were "Apricot Amaretto" cookies.  She was VERY jealous!  Seriously, very good!

A great cookie! I only started making these this year and so far have had to make 4 batches as they keep disappearing into everyone's mouth!!

I followed the advice to add an extra 1/4 cup flour and haven't had the jam run over or cookies crack.  The problem I have is with the glaze. It seems to melt into the jam no matter how long I let them cool. Any advice?

A friend brought these to a cookie exchange and they were the best I'd had in a long time.  I had to have the recipe to add to my holiday baking schedule.  I usually make 6-8 kinds at Christmas and now I have one more to add.

So delicious! Only modification I made was to use vanilla extract, not almond.  I added 2 tsp of vanilla sugar to the icing (you can find that in the baking aisle in little packets).  I had to double the icing mix - I am a big icer! I used a ziploc bag and cut the corner off of it to drizzle the icing easily.  I like sweet cookies and these were sweet and definitely a keeper of a recipe!

These are ALWAYS a hit. I highly recommend you just double the batch and freeze the other half. Believe me, they will get gobbled up so fast you will be thankful you have more! These make an impressive and pretty holiday cookie!

This is the second Christmas I've wanted to try these but I just expected a huge mess with lots of wasted butter and whats left of my raspberry jelly. This is a very simple recipe just the way it is. I formed my little balls, made the indents, stuck them in the fridge, went and watched the beginning of Saturday Night Live, took them out of the fridge, put the jam in and popped them in the oven and perfection. I baked the first tray a couple minutes too long. Seriously this is simple. I dropped a big glob on the floor when I was cleaning my KitchenAid paddle and my dog inhaled the dough!

This is a delicious recipe!  The cookies did flatten out a little bit, but the jam stayed in place.  The glaze adds a great look and extra sweetness.  It was easy to make and I'll definitely be making this again.

The ONLY change I made was to add about a 1/4 tsp of salt because that's just how I like my cookies, but I LOVE the raspberry jam and almond extract! Oh, I also left off the glaze - not a fan of glazes. Great base recipe with a lovely interpretation!

I've made these a couple of times. Sometimes they come out picture-perfect, sometimes they come out a little flat and cracked. I don't do anything differently, it almost seems to be hit or miss. I do think that popping them in the freezer before baking helps them keep their shape. No matter how they look though, they always come out delicious!

I'm not sure if I added the sugar correctly or not, but it ended up oozing out of the dough in the oven.  After the cookies cooled, the final texture was very brittle and overly sweet/oily.

All I can say is MWAH! These were perfect in their texture and flavor. We tried a couple of seedless berry jams as well as peach and apricot. All of them were consumed too quickly! I ended up making 4 different batches just so I could complete my holiday gifts! My kids would eat any broken cookies, broken meaning a little jelly had bubbled over the top of the thumbprint well. The good thing is, them eating the cookies kept me from eating the cookies! :)

I have made these cookies several times with different jam. I must raspberry tasted the best! I also used vanilla instead of the almond extract. They still tasted good, but I prefer to use almond extract instead. Great recipe!

Fantastic cookie. I've made these several times, twice for Christmas and once for a teacher/staff luncheon.  I always make extras for my family.  They are without a doubt one of the favorites and always get compliments from everyone.  A must try recipe!!

I needed these cookies to be very pretty for a tea. Followed recipe exactly (for first batch), and the edges cracked a lot -- not so pretty. They also tasted too much like flour. For the second batch, I added 2 egg yolks to dough. After shaping and filling, I put them in the freezer for 3 minutes before baking. Much prettier result, easier to work with, and they taste better, too.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!  Had no problems at all, and made them exactly as written, with the exception of using LEMON extract instead of the almond, only because I didn't have any almond extract.  The lemon extract was delicous in these cookies!  Got soooo many compliments on these!  This recipe is sooo going on my "go to" cookie list!!!  Thanks!

These were good, I did use margarine instead of butter only because that was all I had. They did come out flat, not like the picture, but still very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  These were the first time I tried "thumbprint" cookies.  Followed recipe exactly and baked about 16 minutes.  Did not look brown and were fairly soft, but let cool and they are perfect.  I can see I will need to make another batch before Christmas. :-)

I love P.B. Twix and since I can not find them anymore, I used this recipe as the shortbread base for the cookie and topped it with a peanut butter mixture and dipped it in chocolate...EXCELLENT!!! The peanut butter mixture I use is a jar of vanilla icing mixed with a small jar (160z) of Peanut Butter

These came out excellent.  Just be sure to not make the jelly well too big and follow the directions exactly, and they bake up prefectly.  Top with a few sliced almonds for a little bit extra.

Awesome cookie recipe!  They have the perfect texture and taste.  My cookies spread out too much and flattened when I baked them.  Next time I think that I'll use my cookie scooper instead.  That will result in smaller balls that are handled less so the dough will stay chilled when I put them in the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delish!!  Followed recipe exactly, used 4 different jellies....sooo tasty!  I think they messed up on how big to make your balls... they came out too big... make your balls 3/4 of an inch... and you will have a bite-size cookie.

My son has egg allergies and it is hard to find cookies that he cant eat that also tatse great...These cookies are awsome!  They are great tasting and easy to make.  I followed the advise of other reviews and put the cookies in the refridgerator for about 10-15 minutes prior to baking them.  I did not have runoff from the jam but I have made a type of thumbprint cookie before and know you have to make the indentation deep enough.  I also had to add some more milk to the glaze but just eye-balled  it.  These cookies are easy to make, they dont take along time to prep or bake and have simple ingredients that you likely have around the house.  Thats a great cookie to me!

I love this recipe.  I substitute 1/2 cup of ground almond meal for the flour, to make really delish.  I usually don't do the glaze either and they are fantastic without.  Really festive looking.

Wonderful recipe. I skipped the glaze and used strawberry jam instead and the cookies turned out perfect. I would suggest to add a pinch of salt to give a bit more flavor.

Amazing! I mostly followed the recipe . I used strawberry jam. I put the cookies in the freezer 10 minutes prior to baking. I also used a 1/8 measuring teaspoon to scoop out dough and make room for the jam. I used the same teaspoon to fill the cookies with jam. Nothing spilled out.

I agree with previous reviews- these cookies flattened when they were baked.  I added an extra 1/4 C of almond flour to the last half of the batch (after baking the first half), and refrigerated them as well, which helped.

EASY A+  I got it right the first time, but instead of almond extract I used vanilla. I don't know why others had the flat issue, but mine was great and kept there shape. I filled them with chocolate and drizzled them with white vanilla icing.

These turned out kind of flat and the flavor was ok but not great. I read some of the other reviews and will try them again using some of their suggestions.

This is by far the best cookie I have ever made. People are always asking me to make them, however the recipe that I make uses way more jam then a half a cup. I make my own jam and use almost a whole jar when I make them which amounts to around a cup. But an easy cookie to make  and even better to eat!

Great recipe...everyone loved it...the only thing I changed was the extract to vanilla and they come out fine. I also used margarine since that is what we always have in the household and it worked fabulous.

I wasn't too sure about how the dough turned out, I found it was crumbly and didn't stick well togethe on the pan at first, but I seen on one of the reviews to freeze or chill the dough first, I might try that and see how it does? If I'm wrong could someone give me a newb cook/baker some pointers? I'm also wondering if it could be the amount of flour or substituting the almond extract for vanilla. I know others have done that and have been successful with thier adjustments. Tasty recipe though over all.

These were fabulous! Perhaps I rolled them on the larger size because the recipe only yielded around 20 cookies. I too used vanilla in place of the almond extract only because it is what I had on hand without running to the store just for almond extract and they turned out wonderfully! I used homemade strawberry jam and used orange extract for the glaze. Yum!

Just made a variation of this recipe and it came out great. Instead of almond extract, i used vanilla. and instead of raspberry jam, i used orange marmalade (i love the sweet/bitter thing). I splashed in a little amaretto liquer as well.  Also a quick tip...make sure you use salted butter. It gives it a balanced flavor. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe a few times now, and they never have turned out flat. I once read in a review in order to ensure cookies will hold their shape in the oven, it's necessary to chill them in the fridge first. I do this for all the cookies I bake now, and never have the flattening issue anymore.  My favorite variation on this recipe is substituting vanilla for the almond and using homemade vanilla blackberry jam :)  Thanks! These are just like my Grandma used to make!

These are fantastic.  Absolutely delicious!  The dough is so good though, it's hard to get them all in the oven.  Mine turned out very large, so will make smaller balls next time.

These were the best cookies ever!!! Tasted just like lora doone's shortbread cookies with black raspberry jam. It was delicious! The reason others were having theres turn out flat is because they were over mixing DONT over mix and you cookies will turn out right! Thanks for the awesome recipe! Will be making these again soon! :D

These cookies are very easy to make. Follow the tips about refrigerating the dough and jam about 15-20 minutes before baking. Works like a charm. Make sure you don't over-bake them! I baked my 1-inch cookies for about 10-11 min and they were perfect. I used too little jam. I guess I was afraid that it'll overflow like it did for the other reviewers, but I just added more jam after baking and it still tasted good.

I used vanilla instead of almond extract, and did not add the glaze. They were delicious filled with cherry preserves on most and peach jam on a couple. Baked on parchment paper.

Delicious! I've made these cookies for holiday and other parties and they're always a hit. Once, I brought them to a catered office Christmas party and everyone said they were better than the ones from the caterers. Oops!  Since I'm allergic to almonds, I use vanilla extract with no trouble. Also, I've tried a few different jams (apricot, blackberry) but the consensus seems to be raspberry. I actually prefer it with the seeds.   Oh, and I definitely recommend using something (I use the top of the extract bottle) instead of a thumb to make the holes for the jam.   Highly recommended.

These are great, easy, and surprisingly quick to make. Simple and sweet cookies that are perfect for a tea party! The only suggestion I have is to be careful with the Almond extract - it can be very strong if you use too much. I think I will use less Almond extract the next time I bake these. I may leave it out completely from the glaze, just to take the edge off.

These weren't as good as I had expected. I added minced pecans to the dough and 1/2 tsp vanilla. OMG.....so much better! Everyone loves these and keeps requesting them. With a couple tweaks they are an easy 5 stars

Amazing cookie!  My husband's new favorite cookie!  He even says its slightly better than his grandma's christmas fig cookies (Gasp!)  For best results, after you put the cookies onto the pans and add in the jam, pop them in the fridge until they are cold.  After you chill them, you can then put them in the oven.  This will keep them from going flat while baking.

Although I liked this cookie quite a bit, I might have added a little too extract.  Also, I found the dough a little tough to work with.  It baked up quick which was nice.  Although the taste was good, I would love if I could find a lighter version of this.  Its a good way to use up jam, but consciously its too rich for me.    I made the recipe as is, except that I used homemade blackberry jam, which did taste good.

These were pretty good. I wasn't OMG but thought they were tasty. I did something a little different. Instead of putting the jam in the center, I avoided the thumb print and just left them as a round cookie then dipped them halfway in some bittersweet chocolate and stuck them into the fridge to cool. Pretty good!

I haven't baked in over 20 years and found this recipe because my department was having a cookie bake-off and I had to bring something in.  I did use one of the variations that a reviewer submitted - thank you.  My goodness, these cookies are so delicious!!!  They came out very buttery and just melted in your mouth.  Everyone raved about how good they were and couldn't believe that this was my first time baking them.  Everyone couldn't get enough cookies to eat, even my husband complained that I didn't leave enough for him.  .

These are amazing little cookies!  The almond and raspberry flavors are awesome together.  I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 tsp. salt.  I did soften the butter before mixing, but I then chilled the dough before baking.  I found the handle end of my pestle worked great for making the thumbprint.  I piped the jam from a baggie into the thumbprints.  For Valentine's day I made some heart-shaped by hand - just make sure you chill the dough so they won't spread out.

I decided to make this recipe for my coworkers over Christmas break. Had I known that they would have been so good I would have doubled the recipe!! I found that the recipe made about 24 cookies instead of the 36.   The only changes I made were with the icing. I had to add more milk than what the recipe called for.   Overall, I loved these cookies! Definitely 5 stars! I'd have put 10 stars if available!

My Mom and I made these cookies every year for Christmas when I was growing up. She called them "poundcake cookies" and I long ago lost the recipe so I was glad to find this again. They are among my and my friends' favorite cookies each year. Another version Mom made was to top each one with a pecan rather than the jam. Excellent cookie!

My family likes traditional Italian Christmas cookies, and I like to try new things.  10 days before Christmas I made one batch of these and set them out on the counter to see what the general reaction would be, and by the time Christmas came and went, I had to make 3 more batches!  This has now joined our list of cookies each year.  Thanks so much!!  : )

Wonderfully easy recipe. Shortbread light and airy. Watch for the first sign of brown rim and take out of the oven to cool on rack. Can see how some would like with and without icing - make it both ways...but the iced version is very decadent and regal looking. I loaded in the jam...can fill without bubbling over. The almond extract made the recipe. Will be my special festivity cookie recipe.

absolutely delicious!  i used real butter and so it's a given that the cookies will spread more than if i used marg.  worth the taste though.  stuck in the freezer for 10min pre-bake and they turned out quite nice... not a single one leaked jam.

These shortbread cookies turn out very crumbly, but they do taste delicious. They were a lot of work to get right, definitely follow the advice of other reviewers and make the holes carefully, making sure they are deeper than they are wide, so the jam does not run off of the top and make a mess. They turned out ok but I think I'll try a different shortbread recipe next time.

Delicious!!! I used boysenberry jam and kept everything the same...best i've ever had, my grandma used to make them but the jam would be chewy and the cookie hard (must have been overcooked) the jam stayed soft and so did the cookie.

Soooo delicious!  Used the exact recipe and the chap stick top idea for making the hole....just the right size. I also baked them for 7 minutes (with the hole already pushed in without the jam), and then took them out of the oven, filled them with the jam using the zip bag cut with a small hole in the tip, and baked them for 7-8 more minutes.  These will be a holiday favorite from this moment on!

These are simply delicious!  They don't even need the drizzle on them.  The shortbread is buttery and light and they were simple to make.  I did pop them in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes before rolling into balls and also used the chapstick trick other users have suggested.  I piped the jelly into the centers using a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off.  I will make these again!

Great taste.  And yes, they do spread.  Need to be refrigerated for a bit.  But not too long because it gets pretty stiff.  The chapstick hint really helped!  :)  Thank you!

Have followed the recipe exactly many times and they always turn out delicious.  I find the dough seems dry at first but as you work it into balls it comes together.  My favorite jam to use (instead of raspberry) is red plumb.  Peach is great too.  This year I took other reviewers' suggestions to use a chapstick lid to make the indentation for jam, and to put the jam into a baggie then squeeze out from a cut corner.  Both made the job much easier.  When it's time to glaze them I always need more than the suggested amount of milk.  I put the glaze in a baggie and cut a corner in that as well - makes glazing them all easy.  I never have to freeze them prior to baking.  It's easy to make these too big - I always have to make sure I'm making them small enough (1 in).  My favorite cookies!

Added these to a cookie exchange last year and they were specially requested again this year.  Note: Do make the prints as you roll; otherwise I found they crack/crumble more easily.  Delicious & travel will w/out the glaze too.  Yum!

Very good cookie!  I didn't glaze them...seemed over the top. They are great without the glaze.  I added about 1/4 cup extra sugar and 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  Turned out very yummy.  Will deffinately make them again.

Very nice! I think I made mine too big because it only made 21 cookies.  I also had to add more milk to the glaze to get it thin enough to drizzle. They were a huge hit!

YUMMY!!!!!  My whole family just loved these cookies.  I love to cook and have been for many years but baking is a new thing for me.  I took advise from others and cooked at 340 and froze for 10 min. before baking. I also added 1/4 cup more flour.  I used lemon curd for half of them and raspberry for the other.  They both turned out great!  I will for sure be making many more of these.  In fact I will be making lots more this week to give as gifts.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Cookie is very buttery.  My batch yielded 26 cookies.  I used a sugarless jam (with Splenda) on my first cookie sheet, then I used a homemade jam on my 2nd sheet and a regular store bought jam on my final sheet.  The sugarless jam held together well, however the homemade & store bought jams drastically spread out.  However they are a tasty cookie.

My sister-in-law made these last year and I really loved them so I decided to make them this year. My husband and his co-workers loved them! I used melted white chocolate chips instead of the glaze b/c that's how my sister-in-law made them last year and I love the combination of white chocolate and raspberry.

These cookies are very tasty, but mine didn't come out like the picture.  The jelly bled into the dough and the cookes looked like blood shot eyes.  So other than the appearance- and was going to give them as gifts, they had to use for the family-   they didn't mind thou.

Made these for a cookie exchange and loved the ease of these and took advice by keeping the butter chilled and not softened which in turn helped the jam stay in the indent.    My husband who rarely eats sweets now could not keep out of these.    Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Many reviewers have commented on how to make perfect holes for the jam.  I use the end of a wooden spoon and it makes a nice well, smaller that the picture, but holds the jam nicely

Good, easy recipe. Works best if you use your hands to knead all the dough before forming balls. I tried it before and after kneading, and the first ones flattened out.

these are awesome! I ended up having to use a  small amount of milk and a little extra butter, my dough was very crumbly!I did chill the dough or a few minutes, and actually shaped the balls into little "bowls"! First time I have ever made a cookie such as this and will be making these often! Super easy and super tasty!

Love these, I've wanted to find a shortbread/jam recipe for a few years and finally gave it a shot. I used a cherry/strawberry/raspberry blend for the jam filling and it was delish!

Oh these are soo good. The only  change I made was by using cherry preserves instead of raspberry.  Half were eaten about 2 mins out of the oven! A very good recipe! Thank you for sharing.

O' yum!!!! Ive never been a big cookie eater but we made raspberry preserves and I was looking for something to make with it and this looked easy enough. It was very easy and so Delicious. There is eleven people in my family and its a miracle when we all like something but these cookies are it. We made them twice in the first week and will add them to our favorites. We did do something different we drizzled white chocolate over them and loved it!!

These are delicious. The batter was a bit dry and could use more butter (1/4C) but turned out well. and tasted great.The only change I made was add drizzled white chocolate instead of the icing... will make again for sure

LOVED these cookies!  They taste almost exactly like the Pepperidge Farm Verano cookies - except not as chewy.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly - but I used a leveled TBSP to size the balls of dough and used a 1/4 tsp. to fill the center of the cookies with preserves.   If you're thinking about leaving off the drizzle - don't! It's delicious!

Soooo good! What a great combo of flavors. I can't say that I can taste the almond too much, so I'll add more next time. I used strawberry jam and it was so yummy!!!

Really enjoyed the almond extract.  The dough was a little too moist to work with so I chilled it for 30 minutes.  I put the jam in ziploc bag and snipped the corner, which worked out great.  I baked it at 350 for 14 mins.  Really, you don't need the icing because it is delicious just as it is.

I gave this 4 stars only because it takes more effort than a drop cookie, but other than that, it was fun to make and delicious!  My hint: I rolled them in a barrel shape,  used the end of a Sharpie to make the hole, and then I put the jam in a plastic sandwich bag with a tiny tip cut off to fill them neatly.  I also stuck them in the refrigerator as other reviewers have said to do, so they don't get flattened out too much.   Excellent!

This cookies weren't too difficult to make. Some turned out picture perfect, others cracked a little and the jam melted out. I wasn't a personal fan of the almond extract but they did go quickly with the rest of my family and guests.

They tasted good once they turned out like the picture. :) A lot of them turned out flat and I ended up having to toss them. I think it is how the butter and almond extract is mixed. I'll have to try again to get them all to turn out pretty and delicious.

I made these last night and we could not stay out of them! I followed the recipe exactly but I did bake @ 340. They stayed just perfect, did not go flat and my jam did not run on a single cookie.  I may add more almond extract next time--I love that flavor!

I have made these multiple times and they are simple and delicious.  I do sometimes use lemon curd for my filling in part of the batch, although my favorite is the raspberry.  These are always a hit.

These are the easiest cookies to whip up. Every event I have people RSVP requesting I make these. Try different preserves and jams- cherry is great but stay away from citrus jams they don't mesh well

I love these cookies! They take no time at all to whip up and completely satisfied my pregnancy cravings!! I have made these at least 10 times already, and as others have reviewed...less is more with the jelly!

excellent! for more of a "shortbread" style of cookie, after i make my dough i normally cover it and stick it in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. it makes them so delicious and they end up tasting just like professionally made ones!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I added a bit more flour, about 1/4 cup and also didn't warm my butter up all the way, and instead of almond I used Hazelnut and instead of raspberry I used blackcurrent jam.  They turned out amazing! They remind me of German cookies I had last time I was there.

Made these exactly as written and they turned out great. I did take Sarah's suggestion and when the cookies were ready to bake I put them in the fridge for about 15 mins..

These are really yummy!  I actually used the dough (minus the almond flavoring, jam, and glaze) to make strawberry shortcake!! Delicious!  Just roll the cookies out into 15 balls, put on cookie sheet, and flatten.  bake as directed.  Let cool and top with strawberries and whipped cream, add another cookie and repeat strawberries and whipped cream!  It's excellent!

Delicious! I used homemade strawberry and blueberry jam and they turned out amazing! I wasn't careful enough to put them away when my hubby's friends came over, and came back to find the entire plate polished off! Will have to be more careful next time...

I just wanted to add myself to the hundreds who think this recipe is AWESOME!!!  They should rename it the "Oh My Gosh" cookies because everytime someone takes a bite they get that wide-eyed, open-mouthed double-chined look on their face, and 9 out of 10 times they utter "Oh...My.....Gosh!"

My fiance says these are the best shortbread thumbprint cookies he's ever tasted! They are the best I've tasted too! I cooked them at their minimum time and they're a bit chewy in the middle, which I like. They have such a great almond buttery taste to them.

I love shortbread and thumbprint cookies so when I found this recipe, I was so excited to try them. Needless to say, I LOVE these cookies and will be making them again and again. I usually never alter recipes but I'm not a huge fan of almond extract so I change it to 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I also used lemon curd and topped some with just powdered sugar and some with the glaze.YUMMY!

I've had trouble with shortbread before, but these turn out perfectly! I used vanilla instead of almond, added a little extra flour and then put the assembled cookies in the freezer for about 15 min before baking. I didn't bother with the icing and I cant imagine I was missing much, they were perfect! Also, while they were great straight out of the oven, they were even better about an hour later. The outsides were delicate and buttery while the middle was perfectly gooey with jam. I will definitely be making these again.

These went together well, although they did spread a bit. (I will put dough in freezer or fridge as suggested for a while next time.) I'm always looking for simple recipes my toddler can help me make, and this certainly fit the bill, especially since there is no egg to worry about.

I am allergic to nuts so I used vanilla extract instead of almond. It only made about 2 dozen cookies for me, but these were probably the best cookies I have ever made!!! Absolutely delicious. Everyone gobbled them up.

these were excellent! i followed reviewer MarcieJ's advice on keeping the cookies firmer and making them look like they do in the photo, and they come out wonderful. i only had one stick of butter left and had to mix it with a stick of margarine, but they still came out fine. i also used lemon juice in place of the almond extract, and strawberry jam instead of raspberry. if i made these again i would like to see how they are with all the original ingredients, but even how i made it they came out excellent.

These cookies spread out way too much for me. The cookies got flat and the jelly ran out onto the cookie sheet and made a mess. They looked terrible but they tasted pretty good anyway. I'm not sure I would make them again.

I recommend adding a little less almond extract to the dough - maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp. instead of 3/4 tsp. And I only had to bake 10-12 minutes before these were done. Otherwise, perfect recipe!

I tried making these for a cookie exchange and I must not have had the proper thumb- but most of the cookies the jam ran out or the cookie absorbed it. didn't look like the pictures. I didn't serve them. But I did snack on them.

I followed MarciJ's recommendations but my dough wouldn't come together.  I ended up adding 3T of milk and then it did.  Otherwise the revisions worked perfectly.  Of note, I used a cookie scoop and only got 18 cookies.  These were delectable and we'll definitely make them again.

Overall, I loved these cookies. Great taste. I used vanilla in place of the almond extract because I never have that stuff. I used margarine and still think they taste fabulous. The only complaint I do have is that when I went to make the "thumbprint" the cookie dough crumbled and cracked and I was just so frustrated.

I think my jam to cookie ratio was off. I would make them smaller next time because they do spread out and then there's not enough jam. Other than that they tasted about a 4. It's not like a cookie is ever unedible though!

Well...not really what I was looking for. I wanted more of a 'shortbread' taste. These were to 'cookie' tasting. I didn't use any jam I used chocolate frosting. I made these to big, they should be more like 1/2" - 1" size balls. I used vanilla instead of almond. My boys did like them. But I was looking for more of a 'fudge susan' type cookie.

Wowie, these things are tasty and pretty! My husband, not a cookie freak like me, can't even resist them.  I had no problems and followed others suggestions in chilling them before baking. The jelly didn't ooze...the glaze was easy! Life is good when you can get this excited over a cookie! Thanks for sharing!

I noticed the cookies I rolled, quickly, came out much less flat that the ones my four-year-old rolled. The butter melts quick and makes the cookies flat. The taste was still great!

I followed other reader recommendation to put the cookie tray in the fridge before baking -- except, I put only the cookies with NO JAM in the fridge. by doing this, it was so much easier to put the jam filling in and the cookies came out nice and yummy

These cookies received a thumbs-up from my husband!  I didn't realize I was out of almond extract until after I started making them, so I substituted vanilla.  I didn't have problems with flat cookies--although I did use cold butter and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I think they would taste even better with almond extract so I plan to try these again.

My family loved it! I will be making this over and over again! Thank you so much! Only thing different is I used strawberry jam and I melted it first for better consistency and then I used water instead of milk for the "frosting".

Followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup extra flour.  These didn't look cooked when I first took them out but then they hardened up a little once they cooled.  Used strawberry jam and turned out great!

AMAZING cookies!! I didn't make the drizzle (I had to make 16 dozen) & they were awesome. Got nothing but rave reviews from the cookie exchange I went to. Will def keep this one! I followed the few other reviews by adding the extra flour & they were buttery & perfect! :)

I followed the recipe exactly. I had to cut back on the baking time though. My first batch looked nice, but were too crumbly and fell apart when bitten into. Removing them from the oven a couple of minutes early produced tender, gorgeous shortbread cookies. I made these for a Christmas gathering and received only a couple of compliments. My immediate family were not impressed.

I did not have a problem with my cookies turning out flat. I followed the recipe to the letter. I used the chapstick lid that another reviewer suggested to make the indentations in the cookies. I found it helpful to put a dab of butter on the lid first. Then, I stuck the lid into the middle of the cookies and began moving it around in a small circular motion with the circles getting a wee bit wider to get the indentation to become bigger and deeper. Worked like a charm! Filled it with jam. Do not fill it to the brim or it will overflow, but don't be stingy about the jam either. The raspberry jam tastes much better than the strawberry one. I also used jam with seeds, and it was still good, but some people don't like seeds. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of the cookies after they come it. It's much easier with a pastry brush.

AWESOME cookies!! I have trouble baking cookies but these turned out perfect and such a great taste and texture. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with the sweet jam gooey perfect. I sprinkled powerdered sugar over them b/c I didn't want to make the glaze and the sugar melted into the cookies so I don't recommend that.. but they are just find w/o any glaze or extras.... yuummy! My best Christmas cookies this year.

Wow!  This is an amazing recipe.  The Almond Extract really stands out - do not use Vanilla.  I took the advise of previous reviewers and chilled the dough in the fridge, used the end of a Chapstick for the hole, and filled a ziplock for piping the jelly in (would have worked better if not for the chunks in my preserves!).  I thought the glaze was too thick so I thinned it out(too much!).  All in all, an excellent recipe that I will be making again.  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and and made them slightly larger which made about 2 1/2 dozen. I absent-mindedly dumped the flour and sugar in a bowl, forgetting to cream the sugar and butter first. I ended up mixing it with my hands and just rolling it into balls, (did not chill) and used my thumb for the hole. They turned out great!

I've made about 40 dozen of these cookies as party favors and gifts in the past 4 months. They are a huge hit and I'm getting special requests to make more. I make the cookies a bit smaller and do not use raspberry filling but instead fill after they've cooled completely with colored icing. For this icing, I use 2 c confectioners sugar, 3/4 tsp almond, and milk to just runny consistency. The icing will set overnight. I recommend using salted butter.

These cookies are AWESOME!! My husband loved them! I followed the recipe except I added vanilla extract instead of almond. The dough was great to work with. I will be making these again :)
Thanks

Excellent cookie--just make sure your use a nice jelly and not a preserve; preserves have too much liquid and make the cookie soft.

These are wonderfully light and melt-in-your-mouth yummy!!! I made two batches of these today, using homemade raspberry freezer jam and marachino cherries in the thumb print. Thank you for this recipe. The taste is buttery and so good! Very easy to make. I didn't change the recipe at all, well... except for the cherries. These may work with kisses or rolos in the center too. I'll have to try that. Again, wonderful shortbread cookie recipe. We will enjoy it for years to come

These were simple and delicious. I too, added 1/4c more flour and used the top of a chapstick to make the holes. I baked at 335 for 16 min each. They may not last until my holiday visitors come this week.

These taste really good, but not easy like others are saying...  When you have to change the instructions to get a cookie to turn out right, it shouldn't get 5 stars...  As written, these cookies are difficult to work with as far as getting the jelly indents in them without the cookie falling apart.  Had to shape them, fill them, reshape them, then bake them...  time was spot on, though.  These do taste really really good, but I doubt I make them again.  Even after following the recipe, then following advice to chill the dough...  at least 3 per sheet spread to the point that they were ugly (but tasty) and since I give cookies as gifts, these have to be considered a failure.  As the shortbread itself is wonderful and melt in your mouth, might try to make the dough and do something with it besides thumbprints.

These cookies are crazy good!  My first time making them and I did learn after the first batch to use a tablespoon to measure out the dough on the cookie sheet and I used the bottle of almond extract turned upside down (with lid on) to stamp out a perfect hole to fill in the raspberry jam.  Filled the frosting in a plastic baggie and they looked amazing and tasted so good.  Just takes time to prep them before putting in the oven, but dont rush.  If the dough breaks while stamping with the bottle, use your fingers to carefully reshape dough around the lid.  These are keepers!

These cookies are incredibly easy to make with few ingredients.  I had to make cookies for my work's potluck and I chose these based on difficulty.  Not only that, but the almond extract glaze that you drizzle over the top takes these cookies to another level.  They are incredible! I had to slap my mother's hand away from them a couple of times so I would have enough for work.  The chapstick lid idea worked like a charm (thanks other reviewers!), make sure if the chapstick gets stuck in the little dough ball you rub the lid with a little flour to get them out easily.  I used a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to scoop in the raspberry jam so none would run out during baking.  Delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

My kids love Knotts Berry Farm strawberry shortbread cookies, so I've been searching for a similar recipe.  This is the closest I've found so far.  I didn't use the icing, and I used Solo filling instead of jam.  I also found the cookies flattened a little more than I would have liked, so next time I will chill the dough first. We're having our Christmas open house this Sunday, and these cookies will be on my table.  Well, if I don't eat them all first, they'll be on my table!

Another year and I am still using this recipe. I noticed that I saved this recipe in 2003! It has been a family favorite ever since. These are to die for and are SO EASY to make! Don't be fooled! Family members are often "wowed" by my baking skills when they see these, but in reality these are simple to pull together. Often I will cut out the second step of glazing for ease and the cookies are still great. Also, try substituting the raspberry for another jam, jelly or preserves. My family really likes the cookies with blackberry preserves as well as the raspberry. Around my home, these cookies are regularly baked and have become the new "chocolate chip" cookie!

A bit flat as some other reviewers said, but nothing that can't be remedied. They were absolutely delicious. The batch was not big enough! I might try a few other types of jam next time.

Wow, these are fantastic.  I did find that I needed to add a bit more flour because my first batch was flat.  This is definately in my rotation of Christmas cookies now.

These cookies are good but like other posters said, the ingredients have to be adjusted for the glaze. Plus, mine were sort of flat but I attribute that to the dough not being cold enough when I cooked them. I thought 3/4 tsp was too much almond extract. I also had to use about a tsp or two more milk. Good cookies. Had to adjust things a little though.

I made this cookie last night and they are fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of almond extract but followed the directions and the almond is very faint and adds a nice mellow flavor. The only 2 changes I made was to swap out pomegranate, grape and apricot jams for the raspberry since I wanted a variety of flavors. And I also skipped the almond extract in the frosting, just made a plain powd. sugar frosting. This is going in my recipe box for a quick, easy cookie recipe!

Delicious. very buttery. Although I followed the suggestions of MarcieJ (using chilled butter) I wouldn't do it again. The cookies were too crumbly and were difficult to form into a ball. As a result they cooked really flat and broke really easily. Great taste though.

Now i'm obligated to make them for my husband's colleagues as well. People can't get enough of them.

Tasted Great! However, follow the advice of a previous reviewer.  Chill the dough balls with the filling for 1/2 hour in the freezer.  This will keep the cookie pretty and together.  First time shortbread ever worked for me!

A couple tricks:
1.  Roll the dough balls into ground almonds.  2.  Use a the back of a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon to create a dent in the cookie for the filling. It seemed to be the perfect size.  3.  Microwave your jam for several seconds to make it a little thinner--you can then just drop it into the center of the cookie.
These were fantastic.  Rolling them in the almonds in addition to the drizzled icing makees them look so pretty--and so much more difficult then they really are!

These cookies were good.  I made them for a girl scout cookie swap.  I think it is a great basic cookie but does need something else to enhance it.  Maybe rolling the cooking in some nuts before baking would be great.

I never thought I would be able to make these cookies, but at the end they are a lot easier than I had imagined. The only change I made was to replace the white sugar for Splenda. It used a little more flour I guess, but the end result was fantastic. The raspberry preserves I used were also sugar-free. I made them for my husband at first and he loved them! Today I brought a new batch to the office and the guys absolutely enjoyed them,too. Thank you for a simple, nice recipe.

This is very yummy and very easy.  I put my jam in a decorating bag, the kind for icing cakes, which made getting just the right amount of jam easy.

Great, I had no problems with this recipe.  I was a little nervous when I read the reviews, but I decided to stick to original recipe, and it worked out great. My kids love them.  So, please try recipe as is. Thanks

Taste great!  But mine turned out flat :(  I'll follow the suggestion next time to freeze them for 20 min before baking.

Make sure not to cook these cookies until lightly brown because that makes them TOO HARD. I think these cookies are supposed to be more white in color from looking at pictures online. They aren't very fluffy, if that's what you were looking for then maybe you should try adding egg to the recipe. but the ingredients were all tastey :)

My husband really liked this recipe, but I won't be making it again. It was like eating a slab of butter. My fault for thinking this would come out differently. I guess that's what shortbread is supposed to taste like.

Don't skip the glaze, it definitely adds a little extra something to the cookie.

I couldn't get enough of these cookies!  The combination of shortbread, raspberry and almond is just perfect in every single bite!  I made these as part of my Christmas baking last year, and I will continue to make them year after year!  Not only are they delicious, but they are such a pretty cookie for the holidays!

This recipe was exceptional and easy.  I am amazed at the simplicity of ingredients and the flavor.  They were so good I had to start giving them away so I would not eat them all.  Definitely a keeper.

Definitely too much almond extract. Half would be nice.  Be sure not to make these too big- or youll get flat, messy cookies!  Keep in mind that this recipe makes 36!

Great cookie. I like that it's easy, uses basic ingredients that I always have on hand and looks pretty. It's similar to one I have made for years except the other used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter and also used a maraschino cherry in the center instead of jam. I'll use this recipe from now on.

This recipe came from the Taste of Home magazine and has always been a favorite at my Christmas Open House every year. I have a friend who is allergic to nuts, so I replaced the almond extract in the cookies and glaze with vanilla for her sake. My personal preference is almond, but they are just about as good with the vanilla.

OH MY!  These were unbelievable.  I followed some other reviewers tips - oven down 10 degrees, don't bring the butter to room temp, put the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking, adding 1/4 more flour, use a chapstick tube for the holes.  I got a little bit ahead of myself - I wanted to taste them!! - and put the glaze on when the cookies were a little too warm.  I ended up with a cloudy little pool on top of the jam and kind of a shiny coating on the rest of the cookie.  It doesn't matter though - I halved the recipe and made them yesterday and they are already gone!!

These cookies are very good, always a hit.  I've used various fillings other than raspberry and they are all good.  It's easier to apply the icing when the cookies are cold, it turns out prettier, otherwise you just get an icing blob in the middle.

These were so very easy to make....the dough came together so easily......As I read some of the viewers comments about the dough being hard to work with I was very puzzled.  I think the reason my dough came so easily together was because I used extra fine sugar....that's always a must in shortbread.......I made the cookie balls 1" round and yielded 31 cookies......very good, and a very pretty cookie at that!

Good flavors of almond and raspberry.  I used the Smuckers brand seedless raspberry jam.  They aren't the prettiest, but they are tasty.

Turned out great.  I didn't do anything different than what was called for except for when making the drizzle.  It was way too thick to "drizzle" so I had to add 2 more tsps of milk, and I sprinkle some cinnamon in it.

This is such a delectable cookie.  I refrigerated the dough a little like suggested.  I gave it four stars because I thought the dough is a little hard to work with, but the cookie came out amazing.  It likes to break apart some what.  It's my first go around...will try to master it next time.  Great tasting!!!

My family ADORES these cookies! They are so easy to make and take so few ingredients I whip them up for an after-school snack. I have even done an orange extract and marmalade cookie that wasn't terrific but still gobbled up!

So, so, so good.  I was forced to make a couple changes, however, based on the ingredients I had on hand: no almond extract, so I used my top notch vanilla extract in both the dough and icing.  I also used a four-berry preserve (strawberry, raspberry, blueberry and blackberry) that I had around; very tart and not too sweet, which really complimented the buttery/sweetness of the dough.  Even though I stuck the dough in the fridge after mixing AND froze it after rolling and filling, my cookies spread out somewhat, but the jam didn't overflow.  Three dozen as advertised and perfectly cooked after fourteen minutes.  Delish!

I made these a bit differently.  I baked the cookies and then half way through I spread blackberry jam and honey on each one.  After they finished baking I let them cool for a few minutes and then sandwiched them.  After they cooled I then drizzled melted dark chocolate with ameretto overtop of them.  Wow!  They were heavenly!  Next time I'm gonna try the original way but with honey too!

I am so glad to have found this recipe again.  These cookies are delicious.  Make them exactly as the recipe states and you won't be disappointed.  The almond extract is ESSENTIAL in these -- if you leave it out, they won't be the same.

These are delicious but it takes a little work to make them "look good."  I would try them as a home treat before baking them for a party, etc.  They are good without the drizzle, too.

These cookies were the best! I amde a plate of them for my father in law and he always asks when he will get another ration of them. I ran out of butter and ended up using margarine so they were more dense and chewy than they should have been, but the flavor was absolutely amazing. I used seedless rasberry jam, but I think any flavor preserves or jam would have tasted just as good.

I don't care for almond extract, but in the glaze it is delicious!  Since Christmas of 2007 I have made over 16 dozen of these cookies.  Today I am subsituting the raspberry preserve for huckleberry preserve...I can't wait to try it!

Mmmmm!!! Okay so my hubby LOVES these!! They are his new fave!! He says they remind him of refined fair scone....(okay??!). They were perfect, just two things to note "not" to do...don't use unsalted butter, you need that salt or else it will just taste bland, also don't think your cute by making little cookies they tend to spread out and get too thin, make them a good healthy looking 1 inch to 1 inch and a 1/2. Good luck!

These were very good. I used 1 stick butter, 1 stick margarine and 1 teaspoon of almond extract in the dough. I shaped into 24 balls and then refrigerated dough for 24 hours. I wish I had put the imprint in before I refrigerated, but I didn't. I used a small water bottle lid I had in the kitchen to make the imprint. Put my raspberry filling (mine happened to have seeds and it was filling not jam)into a ziploc bag snipped the corner and piped into the imprint. Baked and let cool then put the glaze into a ziploc and piped it over the top. They turned out very good, no problems with the cookie spreading too much either. I will try these again maybe with lemon and raspberry....lots of options.

These turned out great. I did use strawberry jam instead of raspberry and vanilla instead of almond. I guess mine were Strawberry and Vanilla Shortbread Thumbrints. Oh so good though!!!

After these came out of the oven I wanted to give the recipe a three, some of the jam had spilled out and they didn't look the best. However, after one taste, my family was hooked and we all gave the cookies 5 stars for taste.

Mmmm delicious! They did fall flat a little as well (I didn't bother freezing the dough) but the taste is too good for me to care.

UPDATE Made these again, this time with coconut sugar. People say they come out flat? Mine always come out perfect. I've made them a couple of times now. 3/28/00 I made these cookies to bring in to my sustaibable development class, as an alternative to processed . Everyone in the class loved them and a few people asked for the recipe. I am going to continue to work with this recipe to find out the carbon footprint it leaves behind, for what has been cooked. Thanks for a great, yummy recipe.

My family loved these cookies!  I made them with different types of jam (blackberry and strawberry) and drizzled melted chocolate over them instead of the glaze.  I made one batch for Easter on Friday...and ended up having to do two more because we ended up eating the first one.

Yummm! These are delicious and easy to make. Exact recipe of the Land O Lakes recipe. I dont always use raspberry jam. I sometimes use apricot, strawberry or whatever jam I happen to have in the cupboard or fridge!

I made these with my fifth graders and they were a HIT! They REALLY enjoyed making them.  I used pure almond extract because this makes the difference. They could choose between Nutella and Strawberry jam for filling.

I followed the recipe using MarcieJ's recommendations (like many others here) but when I mixed the flour into the sugar/butter mixture, the resulting mix was extremely crumbly and difficult to work with. When I went to roll up some of the dough into a ball, it would crumble, making it impossible to put a thumbprint indentation on the dough. I had to wind up sprinkling some water on each ball so that the dough would stick. The end product was good, but it was rather on the buttery side and became very overwhelming after the last few bites. After baking, I had to add more raspberry jam to each cookie to even out the strong butter flavor. I doubt that I will make these again.

AMAZING COOKIES! I say this from being the cook who doesn't really like to eat her profits, but loves to see other people enjoy them. They are very light/chewy, the preserves taste like candy (but not too sweet) and don't skip the glaze that makes them look very professional and adds a different sweet flavor to them. I noticed in the picture that the cookies are very tall, but mine came out flatter (I didn't care too much) . I think this was because I was very careful adding flour. I added just enough to lift the dough off the sides of the bowl and into a clump. Maybe I'll try a bit stiffer dough next time. I also used vanilla extract instead of almond (practically the same thing). A very tasty recipe.

These cookies are great and easy to make! The almond and raspberry is a great combo. I don't use the icing over the top. I think they look pretty without it, besides I think it makes them taste a little to strong of almond, since you put almond extract in the icing.

My best friend makes a cookie like this and they are the most amazing cookies I have ever had -- I was very excited to find this recipe, but it paled in comparision to hers.  The taste isn't quite right, the cookies flatten when they cook (as per other reviews) and the recipe is just off.  I would have rated this three stars, but I had them out for company last night and everyone liked them - so they get 4 stars.  But I won't be making these again -- I'm on the search for another recipe.

I used the suggestion of freezing these before baking them to slow down the baking process and these came out beautifully. The only difference I would make is to use something larger than my thumb for the print because my digits are kind of small.

Sooo yummy! To make these look perfect, dont make them too big. I rolled them into balls, used my index finger to make a deep hole which I filled with seedless preserves, then I refrigerated the entire cookie sheet for about 10 minutes. I baked them for about 7-8 minutes, then transferred them to a wire cookie sheet to cool. I omitted the glaze and decided to sprinkled them with powdered sugar. I get requests for these all the time from my friends who really dont like chocolate cookies.

Very good cookie, and easy to make.  I made for a cookie exchange party, they were a hit!  I swapped apricot-peach jam because my mom loves this kind.  I will make with raspberry next time, I'm sure it will be even better.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.  Everybody flipped for this cookie!!  I baked for 13 minutes and they were perfect.  I added more milk to the frosting but that was the only change.  Good and EASY to make!!  Great recipe.

These are really, really yummy... however, I found the raspberry jam to be not quite the right flavor.  Try it with red plum jam:  much better in my opinion!

This recipe is a keeper!  The only thing I had to do different was add a little more milk for the icing.  Made 2 batches; 1 w/raspberry and the other w/strawberry for dessert to take to a New Years Eve party. My daughter helped which is also good.

These were really good and very easy to make. I made them for a cookie exchange party that I went to and there were none left at the end of the party. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the almond flavor was a little bit much for me. I think I will reduce it by just a little bit next time.

My first time making shortbread cookies and it turned out great. Simple and easy. Like others I substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract instead and for fun, I molded the cookies into hearts with strawberry jam in the center. Definitely a keeper!

This was my first time making shortbread cookies so I'm not sure if it was just me but the dough seemed a bit too crumbly. I ended up adding a few splashes of milk to form it. Also, perhaps I was making the cookies too big but I only got approx. 24 cookies, and the recipe calls for 36. Nevertheless, these turned out fabulously and I ended up making a whole other batch. Great Christmas cookie!

These cookies are awesome!!  :-)  I made 3 dozon of them, the first dozon I used strawberry jam, the second dozon I used Palmagranite jam, and the third dozon I used raspberry jam.  Also added about 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  The only ones that didn't turn out as good were the palmagranite ones, but it was the jam's fault (my mother in law didn't use enough pectin when making the jam so it was pretty runny) not the dough's fault.  And I didn't use the glaze either, becuase they were sweet enough w/ the jam.  They are awesome though!!!

Sooo yummy!  I added the extra flour and chilled the cookies prior to baking as others had suggested.  I also needed to add more milk to the icing and skipped out adding more almond extract to it as well and it turned out great!!  Thanks for this one...perfect and pretty for the holidays!

Buttery and Easy! I did use strawberry preserves and left them unfrosted. I also made a batch with vanilla extract and apple pie preserves! These are soo tasty! Thumbprints will now be on my annual cookie list!

Overall yummy flavor, but mine flattened out too much (even after chilling). Next time I will follow other reviews and add more flour. Also, I won't add the almond extract to the icing.

I make these often with different flavorings and different jams. Wonderful every time! Let them cool before you drizzle a glaze over them if you want it to show up well...but they're really great no matter what!!

Okay I don't think I could have messed this recipe up any more than I did last night - too much butter, too much flour, you name it I did it wrong (thats what happens when you make 5 different kinds of cookies in one night!) and guess what? They still tasted fantastic! Thats why this gets 5 stars from me. Also I subbed lemon for any of the almond flavors.

I have wanted to make these for years but always stuck to what I know is good.  What in the world was I waiting for?  THESE ARE AMAZING!!!  My new Christmas cookie for years to come.  I made a batch last night and they were all gone before I got to put the frosting on.  I'm making a batch today too.  I used raspberry seedless jam and I put it in a pastry bag as mentioned by another member.  These are so easy and delicious!

These are fabulous and so simple!  I didn't have any butter on hand so I substituted non-hydrogenated margarine, and they still turned out great.  I thought the almond flavour might be overpowering, but it was just right!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

delicious cookies, but the glaze needs quite a bit more milk to be runny enough.
had no problem with the cookies spreading, the consistency was just right.
I made them a bit smaller & got 4 doz.

These weren't incredible but were good.  I think you need to be really good at making shortbread (which I am not!)to make this cookie sucsessful.  My cookies turned out a little bit flat but the jam stayed in place.  I will make these again but use the suggestion from a pp of putting the cookies into the freezer before cooking.  Also didn't use the icing.  No need - the jam makes this sweet enough.

Okay these have got to the best cookies I have ever eaten! Delish! I make these quite often, even my picky husband who doesn't eat much sweets LOVES these cookies! I have tried them with other jams, and they are all good, but raspberry is the best.

I served them to our church group.  I love to sit back and watch what everyone fancies.  Not only were their comments kind, but their delightful expressions spoke volumes.  So many people enjoyed this cookie.....and for good reason, it is absolutely delicious!

Spft and buttery! I filled about half of the cookies with a jam and made indentations in the rest to fill with a frosting. Very yummy either way. Great recipe and very versatile!

Mixed reviews on these.  Mom thought they were to die for, hubby only had one and I couldn't quite decide.  May try them again with anise flavoring instead and see how that goes over.

WOW these were good.  I used the freezer trick suggested by other reviewers, and it worked like a charm.  I also didn't frost them.  I wish they didn't have so much butter in them so I would not feel so guilty about eating almost the whole batch in two days.  I'd better not make them too often... :)

These cookies are totally delicious! I left out the almost extract and the icing, and I can't imagine how they could have been better! My husband claims they taste just like the raspberry cookies his mother used to make when he was a kid! :-) Will definitely make these again.

The type of jam you use is crucial, I discovered.  I used some Stonewall Kitchen jam and it had too much liquid in it, so it ran.  When I used a store brand product it worked great and the cookies held their shape.  Regardless, these are a sweet cookie.  I did not bother to drizzle them with icing consequently and nobody seemed to notice.  They disappeared lickety-split.  They were easy to make and tasty.

I'll never eat store bought again!  If you only have vanilla extract, they are still good, and if you don't feel like icing them, don't worry about it.  Using parchment or wax paper makes this super fast, easy, and quick to clean up.

This recipe is a hit with everyone I know. They love them, including me! Easy to make and so tasty. If I don't want to spend the few minutes to actually make the icing, I just cover them with powdered sugar. I hate to say this, but if you are making these cookies and they aren't coming out good, you are doing something wrong. Try it again, this is a wonderful recipe. :)

I found this recipe to be really time consuming and stressing. My cookies did not spread out too much, but I did have problem with cookies cracking and jam burning on cookie sheets and causing cookies to weld to pan.....I strongly suggest parchment paper. Cookies did taste better 2nd day.

These are a lot like my Mother's recipe for Jam Delights which involved cutting pastry & cris-crossing it over the jam, much easier! I used seedless raspberry preserves and some low-sugar strawberry. I wouldn't reccomend low-sugar, it was too runny, but the raspberry was delicious!

These cookies tasted very good, however they did nto retain their shape; they spread out a little, and the jam seeped through onto the cookie sheet, but other than that, they were good

I was disappointed in these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of chilling the dough slightly as per other reviewers' recommendation.  They spread out into large cookies, rather than retaining their shape, and in my opinion, were just flavorless and not very good.  I also had to cook them a bit longer to get them to "golden".  I won't make again.

I made these last night.  I could only find Raspberry Jam, not preserves so I used the jam on half of the cookies and Cherry Preserves on the other half.  Both were good, but extremely sweet as some others had mentioned.  On my second batch I melted white chocolate and drizzled across the tops and they were much better.

Probably the best thumbprints I've ever had - certainly the best and easiest I've ever made.  I followed others advice and refrigerated 1/2 hour while on cookie pan before baking and let them set for 5 minutes on pan before removing.  I also made them a little smaller - maybe one inch in diameter instead of 1 1/2.  They did spread a little while baking.  I baked all my cookies this year on parchment paper - it makes life so much easier.  Definitely a keeper.

Yummmm!  These tasted fabulous and looked just as pretty!  I followed the recipe exactly and would recommend everyone else doing the same.  If you don't like almond flavoring, try a different recipe!  You're not doing justice to this recipe if you alter it in any way.  The almond flavoring gives this cookie a distinct taste that makes it stand apart from most traditional holiday cookies.  While I give these a five star rating because I enjoyed them so much, I have to be honest and say I didn't receive many compliments from others about their taste, although everyone did comment on how pretty they looked.  Again, I think the almond flavoring is something people either like or don't like... and I definitely like it!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Left out the frosting, used vanilla extract (I didn't have almond), raspberry preserves w/seeds(that's all I had) and they were plenty sweet. I put them in the freezer, as suggested by others, but they were still crumbly, so they didn't look very pretty were I put my thumb print.   Kind of had to reform them.   Tasted good, but alittle more work than initially thought.

Yummy and pretty and easy!  Wow!  I made these for the holidays and they were a hit!  Since I did not want to spend the extra money on expensive seedless jam, I used regular raspberry jam and took the seeds out by pushing it through a sive with a spoon.  I will be making these every year now.

These cookies were terrific.  I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry.  I made my thumbprints a little too deep on some of the cookies so they cracked after they cooked.  They turn out great if you don't press too deep!!  This will be a regular Xmas Cookie for me.

I took the reviewers' advice and chilled my dough before starting to cook. I also baked the cookies 7 mins before putting the preserves in... then used a squeezie bottle of Welch's Raspberry Preserves for easy and quick filling, then baked them for 7 mins more.  Chilling and squeezing the jam in made these cookies look as fab as the pictures, great recipe!

The flavor in these cookies were way too overpowering. They looked good but I wasn't too thrilled with the texture of them, but on the other hand they are shortbread. The almond and the raspberry are a good combo but I think that the almond is just too much. Maybe cut back a little or use vanilla. I probably will not use again

I read through many of the other reviews, and noted the suggestions, but decided to give it a try as-is.  I have to say...I had no problem with the recipe as it's written.  I let the butter soften a little, but not too much.  I made half the batch with cherry pastry filling, and the other half with raspberry preserves.  Both came out great!  I used a saran wrap-covered chpstick to make the imprints...& used the 1/4 tsp spoon to fill the cookies.  They baked for about 20 mins in my oven.  I made the glaze, as directed...& it also came out great!  In my opinion, they taste best once cooled.  Everyone enjoyed them & I'll definitely make them again.  I found them pretty quick to assemble.  The dough was easy to handle.  I didn't put the dough in the fridge, nor the cookies in the freezer, as some of the others have done.  Maybe my kitchen was cooler, so the batter didn't get quite as soft. ?  Anyway....tasty cookies...& easy to make!  Gonna try other fillings too!  Thanks

Not enough flavor in cookie and it spread out alot making it unpresentable.  I made two batches following directions exactly on the first one, I found the dough easy to handle.  I did chill the second batch for 30 minutes because the first batch spreaded out so much, but it only slightly helped with the spreading and was still unpresentable and not tasty.

very good and buttery. i used vanilla extract instead. they spread out on pan and were a bit larger than i expected. next time i would chill the dough before baking and perhaps make them a little smaller than 1 1/2 inch balls.  but excellent cookie!
thanks

The family did not like these cookies.  The almond flavoring was to overpowering.  I tried the cookies with vanilla flavoring and the family still would not eat these cookies.  Over all the taste of the cookie was bland. I also did not care for the texture of the cookie.  I used homemade blueberry, peach, and pear preserves as these were the only ones available.  Will not make these again.

I am rating a recipe for the first time but this one definitely needs a five star.I followed Marcee's suggestion about keeping in the frezer for 10 min after filling the jam and I lowered the temp as well.They turned out nice and I didnot use almond extract instead vanilla.I also kept the dough in the refrigerator for about halh an hour.
I guess that helped as well.
All in All a gr8 recipe...Thanks for sharing

Made these as gifts for Christmas. They really are very good! Tastes even better after you leave them overnight in an airtight container. I refrigerated the dough for a good hr so they cookies came out nice and round just like the picture.

This, to me, is the best thumbprint recipe on the site.  I've tried several, and was always left with bland, blah cookies.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except 1.) I added an egg, and 2.) I chilled the dough before baking  because I had run out of kitchen time.

The almond extract is key in this recipe, and brings the otherwise 'meh' shortbread to life.

I will never be a huge fan of plain butter cookies, but these are the best of this site's offerings.

Delicious and super easy to make.  Everyone loved them.  I will try them again with different jams.  Also, I made a batch where I switched out to vanilla extract and squished a hershey kiss into the cookie immediately after baking.  These are great!

Excellent! I did as others suggested and chilled the dough before baking and they didn't spread at all. I used a 1/2 teaspoon to make the  indent so that it was even and consistent.

These were super simple to make, but a little bland for my liking. I will try making them bite-size next time so all the flavors are together.  These are a keeper for parties because they are so easy to make and look very presentable.  I doubled the icing and added 4tsp of milk and drizzled the icing over the cookies using a ziploc bag.  Great for presents :)

I love this recipe, but I use lemon extract instead of almond and always add a little more than the recipe states.  And I've never made the frosting/drizzle because they don't seem to need it.  Highly recommend!

This is by far the best recipe I've found for shortbread.  I had to add an additional tablespoon of milk to the icing to make it more "drizzleable".  A definite keeper in my recipe box!

These cookies were easy & delicious.  The only thing I did differently was add 2 teaspoons milk instead of 1 for the drizzle.

heavenly, goes great with a cup of tea. and its absolutely fool proof! they're elegant, and you can definetely try different jams and fillings, but i wouldn't recommend anything like chocolate and peanut butter because the shortbread is much too delicate for it, and it takes away the taste of the shortbread. its definetely a 'melt-in-your-mouth' kind of recipe! i'm just a teen, experiencing with baking, and i'm a definete chocolate person not a shortbread person at all, but these are just great! and i managed to make them! they are just so easy! i like them best without the almond drizzle, the simpler the better! everyone should try these!

I made these for my co-workers cookie swap and they were the hit of the office !! Great recipe.. 
although I must admit that I got tired and used sugar cookie dough for some of the cookies instead of the homemade dough !

WONDERFUL! I saw the rave reviews and decided to try these -- I was not disappointed! These are so easy to make, and come out so pretty and delicious! I used vanilla instead of almond & they still came out great. Also substituted margarine. Used raspberry fruit spread, which was thicker, so it stayed in place v. well. My cookies did not spread much at all, stayed fairly small, so I made the next batch larger. They taste just like the scottish shortbread I love to eat! And what a great way to start our Christmas celebrations!! Thanks, this recipe is a keeper!

These cookies were very easy to make and very tasty.  I used blackberry jam instead since I didn't have raspberry and they were also good.  Will make them again.

Simple and delicious, but not like the shortbread I'm used to having.  I think it needed eggs.  I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

These cookies really are great. I made one batch and it went so quickly that I had to make another. Like a lot of people have said, don't omit the almond extract...it really adds something to the somewhat plain flavor of the shortbread. Also, on my second batch, instead of just using the frosting made of confectioner's sugar and almond extract and milk, I made a chocolate-raspberry frosting by heating them together in a pot with a tiny bit of milk. It made the cookies a lot more like a dessert and a lot more indulgent. Very good after refrigerated.

Very good...I made these for my son's kindergarten class and they loved them. The cookies that came out of the oven with lightly browned bottoms tasted much better than the ones with no brown at all.  I too added a little more milk to the glaze.

I lost my godmother's recipe for her fabulous almond thumbprints. Although hers required a lot more ingredients and time, this has been a great substitute. I can't count how many times I've made these cookies. I'll make a batch or two by request, which happens a lot! I love to bake cookies and this has been a very frequent visitor to the cookie jar.

These are lovely - I just made them and they're delicious. I thought they looked just like the picture (maybe even a little nicer!). I was just looking for a quick, eggless dessert recipe for a dinner party tonight and these hit the spot. I did substitute vanilla for almond (we didn't have any) and used my housemate's rasp preserves with seeds with no problems.

These cookies are absolutely terrific.  They look beautiful and taste fantastic.  I took one reviewers hint and heated raspberry up and that made it very easy to fill.  They take a little time to form balls but it is definitely worth the effort!

Didn't much care for it and apparently my guests didn't either.  They would try one but went back for more on anything but this.  I wouldn't make again.  Wish I had my grandmothers thumbprint recipe.

These are excellent and smell so yummy while baking.  I had trouble with the dought, though.  It would not come together so I had to add small amounts of milk at a time just until the dough came together, and they turned out just fine.  I used raspberry jam and also made some with strawberry.  My daughter loved helping me make the "thumbprint" (we used the back of a plastic measuring spoon) and sliding the jelly off of the spoon and onto the cookie.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Excellent.  I used strawberry jam, and apricot/pineapple jam instead of Rapberry I also did not use the glaze, but i dusted them with powdered sugar.  They turned out really good and pretty.

This was my first time making thumbprints... and WOW... what a great cookie!  I didnt glaze them.  I lightly sprinkled powdered sugar on them instead.  They looked and tasted amazing... not to mention my guests devoured them!  This will become a staple cookie!  Thanks for sharing!

I had these cookies at a store once and ever since have been searching for the recipe. Thank you. I made my cookies a little to big for the first batch so I ended up with 24 instead of 36, yummy either way.

These were some of the best cookies I've ever made. I absolutely loved them. I used vanilla instead of almond extract, and left off the glaze. I also used red plum instead of raspberry jam. My 18 month old even helped out with the thumbprinting. Be sure and make these small as other suggested as they do get much bigger.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I have also filled the cookies with apricot preserves, using vanilla instead of the almond extract.

Spiffeh! :D  This recipe was simple, and my roomie thought they were "yummy"!  I substituted rum extract for the almond, and used apricot preserves, since that's all we had on hand.  Great recipe!

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time, the cookies spread out too much even though I chilled the dough like the recipe said.  This last time, I used extra flour as one reviewer suggested - 1/4 cup or so, chilled it two hours.  They came out much much better!  My husband loves the taste of these cookies and they are really pretty if you take the time to frost them.  I am going to perfect these and add them to my Christmas cookie collection.  Great recipe! Thanks!

Wow! Amazingly delicious & pretty to look at! This would be a perfect "tea" cookie. I followed the recipe exactly & these cookies turned out great! I used seedless raspberry 100% fruit spread with no added sugar. I will be making these cookies a lot!!!!!!

Absolutely fantastic!  They don't need the glaze!  I'm not a big fan of almond extract, so I used 1/4 tsp of it and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Topped with apricot jam.  Great!

it was amazing, except somehow maybe the butter melted a bit, so it was seriously difficult to roll into balls so i just spooned them on thickly. not as pretty but tastewise, seriously good. my sis and i love them! oh, and if you spoon them on too thinly, they spread out and its not good. i didnt use the glaze and it came out great still.a little on the sweet side though.

The cookies tasted wonderful, but they look awful.  I the hole with a small amount of jam so it wouldn't overflow, but the cookie's center puffed up so the hole disappeared and the jam was just a glob.  Unless I did something wrong - these were just ok.  Not presentable for anyone outside of the family.

These are incredible!  I made them for my co-workers, for a Christmas party, and for a cookie exchange and haven't heard anything but praise.  I did use vanilla extract instead of almond and I didn't glaze all of them - they were great either way!  Thanks Dee.

Excellent - quick and easy.  These make an appearance each Christmas. This is the perfect for those who need an easy yet super delicious cookie for a cookie exchange!  I do find mine spread more then I would like.  Chilling the dough may help w/ that so I will make a note to finally do that.  Also use Jam as recipe calls for. I one time used some natural fruit spread thinking all colored blobs that come in a jar are the same and low and behold they are no!.  The fruit spread just melted and oozed everywhere & flattened the cookies.  Quite the ugly (still tasty) mess.

i just made these today and they were a hit with the family. my mom liked them too and asked how much butter went into them "no wonder its so rich". the dough had less flour compared to other shortbreads i've tried to make the but it was also more flavorful. the almond extract made all the difference. i made smaller sized balls and filled the hole with jam in a bag with a corner snipped off. i omitted the icing. i will definitely make these again.

These cookies are delicious.  The first year I made them though, I must have put too much rasberry in each cookie and it boiled over the sides as the baked.  Now I just use less and they come out perfec.

Good recipe.  I used huckleberry jam and substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract and they came out good!  Only measurement discrepancy I found was I had to add an additional 1.5 teaspoons of milk to the glaze to make it thin enough to drizzle.  Cookies impressed the in-laws ;)

These were really very good, but I think next time I will definitely use butter (I used margerine and they seemed to spread a bit). I left out the glaze to make them easy for lil hands to not make messes. I also made a few with hershey kisses in the middles:) These were great for my son with an egg alergy! Thanks!

Very very tasty and quite easy to make. I didn't put the almond extract in, nor did I use vanilla. But I used both seedless rasapberry and seedless strawberry jam and they both turned out very well.

They were a big hit!

This was perfect. It came out really pretty and very tasty. Almost as perfect as fancy store bought cookies.  I first rolled up the dough into balls then i made the thumbprints deep rather than wide. Follow this recipe and you won't regret it!!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I rolled out the dough a little larger than the recipe called for and had to leave them in the oven for about 20 minutes, but they turned out well.  The almond and raspberry were perfect!  I may add in a little more almond extract next time.  I also used leftover white butter frosting from decorating the christmas cookies on the thumbprints.  I just stirred in some extra almond extract and used a plastic baggie with one tip cut out to do a zig-zag with the icing.  They were the biggest hit this holiday season.  I'll be making more for valentines day!  Thanks!

Not sure what I did wrong...I tried the recipe twice. The first time I baked it right away...and the second after some time in the fridge.  It came out somewhat flat.  But it tastes very good and looks better after the glaze. Also I've already been asked for the recipes. But I think I'll try some other cookies before coming back to this again.

Not too bad.  The part that gave it a 3 star is the glaze.  I thought it had too much almond flavoring in it.  I could have done with just 1/4 teaspoon or none at all.  Other than that, it is great.

these cookies were in bad shape coming out of the oven, and i just realized why...never use "insulated" cookie sheets! the cookies spread too quickly and the jam started boiling off and going crazy. 
some were salvagable, and the taste was great. a little too rich, maybe i'll try half-butter half-shortening next time. overall yummy and festive.

Really great.  I prepared the dough ahead of time and froze it for a few weeks so Chritmas baking wouldn't be so crazy.  (If you decide to do this, thaw the dough in the fridge overnight.)
I replaced the almond extract with vanilla and used apricot preserves instead of raspberry jam.  I also drizzled the cool cookies with white and milk chocolate.  TONS of raves.  
I found the easiest way to make the thumbprints is to roll the dough into balls, place on sheet and push the back of a wooden spoon straight down (careful not to break through the bottom).  After that, widen the hole with your index finger, leaving at least a 1/4" rim on the top of the cookie.  Fill 'em up and bake away.  They're really wonderful!

These are relatively easy to make and they are a very pretty finished cookie as well as a delicious one.  Next time I would make the balls only about 1" as I found the larger balls spread too much.  I also found they worked better when the hole for the jam was deeper rather than wider.  I agree that the glaze requires some thining to drizzle properly.  I took other reviewers suggestion to use a plastic bag with a tiny hole in the corner to drizzle the glaze.  The only down side to these cookies is that on storing they lose their crisp edges and become soft--but some people like their cookies that way.

Wow...I had to make 3 batches of these cookies 'cuz we were eating them as fast as I was making them! At first I thought the drizzle was a little over the top, but it really does add an elegant touch. The best thumbprint cookies that I've ever had!!

I just finished making these cookies, and I wouldn't change a thing. They were great!! I really liked the almond flavor, and the icing was the perfect touch. I agree that just about any flavored preserves would taste great. Thank you so much for this recipe. The kids helped me make these for Santa this year, and I think they are perfect because of the red and white color on the cookies. Thanks again.

Cookies were delicious but did not hold their shape at all - needed to chill dough which is not listed in the recipe and still some cookies spread out too thin.  Had to throw out about half.

I made these cookies for a work party and they were a HUGE hit.  The only thing I did differently was I used cherry jam instead of raspberry.  The cherry and almond compliment each other very well.  Also, a caveat: after I chilled the dough it was VERY hard, impossible to work with.  I actually had to let it warm up a bit before I could roll it.  Next time I make these, I'll take the dough out of the fridge 45 minutes or so before I want to roll the cookies.

I used seedless raspberry jam. The glaze is what really makes these special, however we had to make a little bit more than the recipe called for. A great change from the usual shortbread cookies.

I followed recipe exactly except for using 1 1/2 tsp. milk for icing.  It did not make 36 cookies based on a 1 1/2 inch ball.  Next time will make 1 inch balls and make smaller hole (since it did spread quite a bit).   Very good. Final product looks like it would have been difficult but it was easy.

This cookie reminds me of marzipan! I was told by my friends and family that it was very yummy, and I definitely enjoyed them, too. I managed to make exactly 36 cookies (an amazing feat for someone who always gets the servings messed up) and filled 1/3 of the cookies with blackberry jam, 1/3 with strawberry, and 1/ with grape. I could have done without the icing because I could taste the powdered sugar, but everyone else said it was delicious. I might reserve a small amount of icing next time to thin out with more milk. Great overall!

Yummy.  I made these with Smuckers Seedless Strawberry Jam.  I used the end of the handle on my wooden spoon to make the indentation.  I pushed it in about a  half an inch and twirled it to make the hole about the size of a dime.  This recipe was very quick and easy to make.  Next time I will probably double it.

Very good.  I added 1/4 cup finely ground almonds to the dough.  Instead of the glaze, I used melted almond bark/white chocolate.

These were way too sweet for my taste, next time I won't add the frosting from this recipe. Otherwise, it was good--I substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract because my family is not a fan of almond extract.

I love this recipe. I have made it for the past two years for Christmas and now all my friends are asking for them again. This is one of the best recipes for filled cookies that I have ever tasted.

This is my most requested cookie at family gatherings and church events. I actually made them for my cousin's wedding to go along with the wedding cake and people were eating them before they even hit the dessert table. Just excellent. The only subsitute I made was changing the almond for vanilla. I am not crazy over the almond flavor.

These cookies were perfect!! When you add the icing, it adds just the right amount of sweetness.  These cookies are great for my family, because many of them are allergic to chocolate.  They LOVED these!

These were great!  I used vanilla extract because I'm not a big fan of almond.  I also did not use the glaze and just dusted them with confectioners sugar.  Still tasted great!

a very easy cookie to make. I used a jam with seeds and it worked out fine. I also took the advice of another review and used chocolate instead of glaze. I coated the bottom of the cookie and drizzled more chocolate on top. They looked very elegant and made perfect gifts.

This recipies is excellent.  The glaze really brings all the flavors together.  I found that the 1 1/2 ball with less filling and a shallower hole works best. Also I made 1 1/2 times the amount of glaze, because it was so unique.

Thanks for the great recipe.  I made these to take to our church coffee hour and the people kept coming back for more.  It's hard to eat only one.  I filled a cookie decorator with the jam and it made filling the cookies a snap!

these cookies turned out great!  the dough was a little crumbly, but after working it with my hands it came together quite well.  i should have listen to other people's advice about making small indentations--i think it would like better in terms of presentation.   i love the almond/raspberry combo.  next time i'll try vanilla with something else.

OMG!!!  These are soooo good!  Super easy to make and look beautiful!  Excellent xmas cookies.  The only thing I recommend is to add more milk to the icing so the consistency is less thick.  Will definately make again!

It's a good recipie.  It worked well for me the first time I made it, but - and probably out of personal flaw - never worked out right again.  (They bake out much flatter than intended.) I found that replacing the almond extract with vanilla extract makes a more universal setting for almost any form of preserve or jelly. Try this recipie with vanilla extract and orange marmalade, topped with white chocolate chunks.

These cookies were amazing!  No need to say more.  I made them for a party and several people raved about them and asked me for the recipe.  I'll definitely be making them again!!!!  They were simple to make, yet really impressive looking and tasting.  The almond extract is the key!  Delish . . .

These were great cookies, the dough even tasted good by itself.  I used strawberry and grape jam since I didn't have rasberry, they tasted delicious.  My girlfriend and kid loved them, which by the way it's a great cookie to make with kids since it's very simple.  The little guy enjoyed the mixing and filling with jam.  Next time I will be sure to double up on the recipe since it doesn't make very many.

YUM...everything turned out wonderful. I too used about 1T of milk for the glaze. I also substituted Butternut flavor for the almond. I made my cookies quite larger and they turned out pretty good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the filling was a little weird but it may have been the brand I used.

I've made these cookies (without the glaze) twice and they were a hit both times. Do not bake until brown, or else cookies are very hard - 18 min is just right.  An amazingly easy to make and delicious cookie.  Thanks!

I got this recipe from a Land O'Lakes brochure. Yum!!! A little more work than I'm used to with cookies, but definitely worth it. One of the best cookies I've ever had. I received rave reviews and a few people thought I picked them up at the bakery.

We loved these cookies, and will continue to make them.  Very easy. Very quick. Do not substitute Butter Flavored Crisco for butter. Will come out ok, but not the same when using butter. Very light. Looked good. Tasted Good. It made much more than three dozen. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a variation of a recipe I've used before at the holidays.  The only difference between the two that I rememeber is that the other one makes the cookie in the shape of a bar.  The cookie itself is a light, buttery shortbread.  The jam makes it a little sweeter, but overall very good.
