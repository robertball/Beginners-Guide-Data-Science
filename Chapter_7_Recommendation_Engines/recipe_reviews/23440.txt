I'm giving this four stars, only because I made enough changes to make it so. This would be mediocre, at best, without the changes. After all, it's still just doctored up canned soup. I used fresh carrots rather than canned, added mushrooms, cooked crumbled bacon,fresh minced garlic and a glug of white wine. This was way too thick for my liking, but was easily remedied by throwing in some chicken stock. The soaking step for the rice simply isn't necessary---just cook it beforehand as the package directs and add it at the end. The final result was very good, but it was a lot of tinkering around for what was still canned soup. I would have been better off, and with the same amount of work, just making the darned soup from scratch.

I love this recipe! The first time I cooked it, the wild rice was still a little bit stiff, even after soaking for nearly 7 hours, so the second time I cooked it, I put the whole works in the crockpot for a few hours after it was all mixed together, and it was DELICIOUS! My husband even liked it, and he is not a big fan of wild rice/chicken dishes. My Dad and his girlfriend loved it too, as did my Mom. I will definitely make this again and again. It freezed beautifully, so I pull out one serving at a time for my lunch and microwave and stir until it's warm enough to eat. Yum!

This soup is awesome. Instead of soaking the wild rice over night I just precooked it then added it to the soup mixture. Besides being a hardy meal, it is super easy. It goes great with homemade wheat bread.

YUM! Very good flavor. I made this in a crockpot. Julianned the carrots and used sour cream instead of the milk. Added thyme and a bay leaf for added flavor. Everyone loved it!!!! Thanks for sharing!

LOVED IT!  I mircro waved my rice before I put it in the crockpot.  I had equal amounts of rice and water, cooked for 20 minutes and it came out perfect- hardly iany water left- I just dumped it all in the crockpot.  Because I did that, it cut cooking time way down.  It was ready in 3 hours.  Hit the spot on a winter evening!

This recipe is so wonderful!  My mother-in-law asks me to fix it every time she comes to visit.  The soup is great comfort food.  I slice my own fresh baby carrots.  Also I do not soak the rice, instead I cook the rice before I start the soup.  I put my sliced carrots in the same pot as the rice so they cook up together.

I took advice from another review and cooked the rice completely ahead of time and added it to the soup toward the end.  I used fresh carrots instead of canned so I cooked them with the onion and celery.  Needed a little more salt than the recipe called for, I thought, but otherwise, delicious!!

very good.  i used pine nuts instead of almonds, more water and less milk because i don't like things too milky, more salt, some pepper.  and some chili peppers, cause i like it spicy.  

this is a hit.

Made this soup in the crock pot... So I used roteisserie chicken from Coscto, about 1 cup of shredded chicken.. Since I knew I was going to make it in the crockpot, I didn't use all milk.. I did use half cup of skim milk, and the rest with a combo of chicken broth and water.  I did presoak my wild rice overnight too and cooked it on low.  I came home (after 7 hours later) and it was pretty mushy. I did have to add some water to thicken and add some garlic powder, cajun seasonings (slap yo mama is the best) and some pepper. My soup was pretty much orange?  Maybe from the carrots I cut up?  Other than that, my husband loved it. I liked it but I did have to add water.. Ate it with Jo's Rosemary Bread on this website, most delish!

I would have to give this 4 stars. My wife and I love this soup! We made a few changes like grilling the chicken and putting the soup in the crock pot all day. I just added a little bit more milk so it would not be too thick when we got home. Overall awsome recipe

We serve a brand-name version of this soup in the cafe I work at. This recipe is the exact replica of said soup, and it is so good, not to mention probably much healthier without all the preservatives!  Any rice will work in this soup. No need to spend extra money on the wild stuff unless you are trying to impress someone! The carrots didn't cook all the way, but maybe I just need to chop them finer. Will definitely make this again as it makes enough for quite a bit of leftovers.

Pretty good, great consistency. I cooked the wild rice (and raw baby carrots with the rice) before hand instead of soaking, and also added some milk at the end so it wasn't so thick. I also added grated sea salt and pepper. Thanks!

I had been sick with the flu so I needed something quick, easy, and soothing. This nailed all three!! I cut it in half and it worked wonderfully! I can't thank you enough. I actually used cooked instant rice and just added it to the soup towards the end and didn't add all the ingredients...just what I had. Also to suit our tastes I added a touch of garlic powder, seasoned ground pepper, and shredded cheddar cheese (allowed it to melt in the soup). My hubby and even my toddler loved it! It hit the spot. Thanks again!

This is yummy!  I used leftover chicken and quick cooking wild rice.  It was a little too thick in the end, so I ended up adding a bit more milk.  I will make this again.

This turned out to be a great meal!  I cooked it over low for about an hour, and made just a few minor tweaks...I used chicken thigh meat because it doesn't dry out like breast meat, and used a scoop of the quick cooking long grain/wild rice blend instead of pure wild rice.  Also, I added a generous dose of Old Bay seasoning and a pinch of kosher salt.  Anyways this soup was a big hit with my family!

I have made this recipe twice the second time I doubled for a potluck. Made it the night before and put in crockpot in the fridge. Took it to work and cooked on high for a couple of hours. It was the most popular dish there. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a HUGE HIT for an 'all soup' luncheon that we had...  I couldn't find regular wild rice at the store, so I bought two boxes of Rice A Roni LG/WR and only used one of the season packets when I soaked it overnight.  I re-boiled as instructed.  I also added a can of chicken broth and about 3/4 of a cup more milk to increase the overall amount.  Almonds MAKE this dish (great texture!) so be sure to include it.  Also - we have leftover chicken from a birthday party the night before...so I cubed up 3 BBQ'd chicken tenderloins AND (ready?) about 12 chicken nuggets!!  LOL - it was awesome!  By the time the whole thing cooked (and then was transferred to a crock pot for another 2-3 hours), the breading was cooked off of the nuggets and no one knew the difference!  Awesome recipe - thank you for posting!

I think I've figured it out - we don't like Cream of Chicken soup!  This soup was pretty tasty once I added a bunch of milk.  I really liked the addition of the almonds.

This soup was exactly what I was craving!  It was easy to make and turned out well.  I precooked the rice in the microwave instead of soaking it.  I also added some fresh sliced mushrooms with the celery and onion.  yum!

I did leave out the carrots and sometimes add 6 slices of crumbled  bacon...but with or without those changes it is a Yummy soup and a favorite at potluck gatherings as well as with my own family.

It was delicious.  I did not soak the rice, I cooked it as directed and added it when combining all other ingredients. I also used fresh carrots that I sliced and blanched.  Also added a diced gene pepper. Used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. Used chicken broth instead of milk. It was very good and had many wonderful textures.

It's pretty good, even though I missed other users' comments about cooking the wild rice instead of just soaking the wild rice.  I cooked it on low for about 20 extra minutes, and it turned out fine.  Also, I didn't add all the extra butter that the recipe called for... it seemed unnecessary!  The soup turned out fine without it!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made a few modifications based on other reviews written and it's great.  I precooked the rice, drained most of the water, and added it at the end instead of soaking it overnight and then heating it in 1C water.  That way I was sure to get the texture I wanted.  I also used precooked chicken, so in all it took less than 2 hrs.  I wasn't sure about the almonds, but boy do they add to the soup!  I even added a few more than called for.  I used chopped almonds.  I think I'll keep this one.

This soup was a wonderful main dish with a side salad and fresh bread. I used fresh sliced carrots and added a bit more milk when re-heating. The extended family enjoyed.

This soup was a big hit with a very diverse crowd.  The only thing I did different was use a little less butter in the soup.  It was great!
