It was very sticky, so I didn't bother rolling it out, but most importantly, the taste was just not right, the kids didn't even like it, even after I tried to redeem it by topping it with chocolate.  I'll tell ya, I was less than thrilled watching this go down the garbage disposal...I screwed up & doubled the recipe before trying it.  Sorry Julie, thanks anyway.

This made me mad that I actually tried it because I didn't look to see that it has only gotten one star.  The "dough" does not set up.  It would have made a lovely cake icing, but I kept adding a little more sugar to see if it would hold up like a dough and it would not.  Really bummed me out.  Julie, do you have the butter ratio wrong or something?  Sorry, thumbs down!

This tasted ok, but it is so gooey you have to eat it with a spoon. I even put it in the freezer for 24 hours and it's so still gooey it's practically unedible, unless you want to eat it with a spoon.

I also tried this recipe and you need much more confectioners' sugar than the recipe states.  I actually kneaded in more sugar until the dough felt right.  I was able to pat it out and cut circles with a cookie cutter.  Perhaps the original ingredients are not porportioned correctly.  The recipe does not state either how long to beat the butter and corn syrup. That may make a difference as well.  As far as the overall taste, it is really good, even with the extra sugar kneaded in.

I had to put a lot of flour on the pattie dough when I was kneading it.  It was very sticky, but I enjoyed it!  I substituted the mint extract forthe same amount of vanilla.
