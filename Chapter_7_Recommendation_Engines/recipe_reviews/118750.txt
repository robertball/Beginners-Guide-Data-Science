This is a good explanation of how to make hash browns from scratch. Parboiling them first is the secret. I found that the potatoes came out just right, not underdone and not burnt to a crisp trying to get them done. I don't understand the previous reviewers comments. If you don't have the ingredients in a recipe or you don't want to follow the instructions, how can you say it's good but give it 3 stars?

I owned a family style restaurant and there really isn't any other way to get that good restaurant/home cooked quality with hashbrowns other than par boiling the potatoes first. Really good explanation of how to make great hashbrowns. I also thought it was strange that the first reviewer didn't follow the recipe and gave it only a three.

Love this style of hash browns.  Precooked potatoes are a must.  Instead of parboiling I just bake the potatoes along side of another meal, let them cool and shred the next morning.  It makes the skin tougher, which I like.  I tend to toss in chopped seeded jalapeno too, depending on my guests.

This recipe is great!  I used to own a recipe and this is how we made them - except without the peppers as too many people are not fond of fried peppers.  The green ones tend to get bitter and the red ones are too sweet for savory potatoes.  Also, if you parboil the potatoes the day before and then set them in the fridge to cool and dry off, it makes them oh, so, easy to grate without even peeling. (the peel just slips off while grating)  Saves a lot of time and work.  Personally, at home, I like to leave the peels on and process them on my largest grating disk of my Cuisinart.  The peel is healthy and adds a lot of flavour.  Also, I add a teaspoon or two of Old Bay instead of just the salt and pepper.  It really knocks it up a notch!

Well, this turned out really good but I gave it a 3 because I had to make a lot of changes. First, I only had green pepper and I didn't want to use a dutch oven. I peeled and chopped the potatos and boiled the for 20 minutes, then let them cool. Then I cooked everything (onion, pepper, butter) together in a skillet over medium. Will definitely make again.

Always wondered why my hash browns were never quite the same texture as hash browns from a restaurant.  Now I know parboiling is the secret!  Thanks.

FANTASTIC!!! Parboiling makes the difference. Don't waste your time trying other methods, they do not work as well and they come out mushy or greasey.

Yummy Yum Yum Yum!  We just love these breakfast potatoes and have been making them for years.  The only thing different we do is dice the potatoes in medium size pieces instead of shredding them and add  a tspn of soy sauce in the pot.  Though not as healthy as using the Dutch Oven method, we sometimes just pop it all in a pan and fry them on med-hi.  I just love this in the morning with bacon.

Very good indeed. My wife made this without the peppers so our young children would eat it. She added a dash of garlic and onion powder. 20 min. simmer worked well. This dish will appear on our table often.

Good restaurant flavor but on the greasy side.  Will definitely keep the recipe but reduce the olive oil.

I have found another shortcut.  I will microwave the potatoes before I cut them up.  This does a lot of the same thing that boiling does, but it takes less time.

This does make perfect hashbrowns (if you shred the potatoes) or home/country fries (if you slice/dice the potatoes)  Timesaver:  pop the potatoes in the microwave and nuke them instead of parboiling.

These were very good.  I think I need more practice making them because I think I didn't cooked them long enough; they needed to be browner.  A true test is that my picky 5yr old ate them!

Tried this, but found mine to be better. I always use baked potatoes and saute onions and peppers before adding to my hashbrowns then tossing together to finish browning
