The ingredients were right on.  The best flavor comes when you slightly blacken the tomatillos & jalapenos under the broiler, then mix all your ingredients.  If you don't have shallots, use 1 white onion (slightly blacken this also).

Wanted to use up some green tomatoes from the garden so used this recipe. Instead of tomatillos I substituted the green tomatoes. Turned out delicious. Since I seldom have green tomatoes I'll use tomatillos next time.

I was looking for a green salsa to put on chicken burritos and this salsa was perfect. I had to use canned tomatillos because I couldn't find fresh but it was still delicious and even better the next day! I would recomment adding 1 or 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. A great recipe and easy too. Thank you!

Four stars for the ingredients.  White onion is better and you have to add lime juice for that little extra jolt.  Tomatillos are best for salsa when they've been roasted, this goes for the garlic, onion, and peppers too.  Very east, just lay out on a cookie sheet and put under the broiler until the veges begin to look charred.  Turn the veges over and let char on the other side.  Remove from broiler and add veges to the food processor and chop.  Add lime juice to taste and a little kosher salt too.  DELISH!!

This was fresh, tangy, and flavorful. I skipped the shallots, doubled the green chiles, cilantro, and jalapeno, and added 2 finely diced large avocados and a couple Tbs lime juice (for flavor and to keep the avocado from browning).  Taking the seeds out of the jalapenos left the salsa without any heat at all, so as a personal preference, next time I'll just leave them in to get a little spice.

This recipe is amazing - I organize and cook for 20-30 people once a week and this has been a favorite.  However, it only gets 4 stars because I added avocado to thicken it up - it made a much better chip dip that way.  Also, a dash of pepper helped.  Thanks for the awesome recipe; will definitely use again!

This salsa recipe is delicious.  I used canned tomatillos and I also added chopped avocado to the mixture.  My family loved it.  I will use this recipe again.

I made this salsa for a St. Patrick's Day party and it was easy and delicious.  I didn't need to add any of the jalepeno because it was already hot enough.

With a few changes to suit our taste (and what I had on hand) this was a 5-star salsa.  Changes I made: used 3 fresh roasted chili peppers, one small red onion, and probably at least twice the cilantro.  I put a tad too much salt in, but my husband still said it was the best salsa I've ever made.  We're eating it with chips tonight and over grilled chicken tomorrow.  YUM :)

This salsa turned out great! It came out really watery from the blender but I let it sit a couple hours in the fridge and it turned out perfect.

I got a bunch of tomatillos from my CSA and was trying to decide if I should go with this recipe or one where you cook the ingredients. I'm glad I went with this one because not only was it easy, but it tastes great!! I added some lemon juice and cumin and it came out beautifully. I also added an avocado just because I had it lying around. This thickened it up a bit, but honestly, it tasted great before too. I could eat this with a spoon!

Really good! Used jalapenos from the garden, and also added the juice of a lime. Is a bit watery initially but it sets up better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight. Thanks!

This was a great way to make use of the surplus tomatillos and hot peppers I had.  Wonderfully tangy and addictive.  I added more peppers (some serranos). It gave it more heat without altering the flavor much.  Will definitely make again.

Most accurate in roasting the tomatillos!  Also, if you want a little more "heat" use either jalapenos or serrano chilies.  I also like to use chopped green onions and the jest and juice of at least one lime.

Absolutely fantastic!   Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  Great for carnitas.  Don't be tempted to add anything else...it's perfect just like it is.

The shallots from the store were HUGE.. but since I had never used them, I didn't know any better.. I had to make the recipe again without the shallots and combine the two. Hubby liked it a lot. Very fresh, earthy... green tasting... ;p

Very delicious! A nice change of pace from red salsa. We used hot sauce in place of green chilies and jalapenos because we didn't have any on hand. We also added a bit of parsley. We ate it on taco salad, it was so good! My 2-year-old was eating it by the spoonful, he liked it so much.

Be sure to let this set in the frige for at least a few hours. This lets the flavors mix and mellows the onion and garlic. I put this on top of the White Chili I recipe that can be found on this site, a superb pairing. This salsa is incredibly refreshing, the perfect intro to summer.

My best friend and I made this salsa but left in the jalapeno seeds and used four jalapenos to anti up the hot...good recipe....would have worked better for us if we had had a lid to our blender.

I was looking for a way to use up some of the tomatillos that keep coming back in my garden.  This recipe was quick and easy to make.  We used some for dip and then poured the rest over chicken burritos for dinner.  My whole family enoyed this recipe!! Thanks for sharing.

If you are looking for a fresh salsa that’s not red this by far is the best. It’s not overwhelmingly hot, but it has a nice kick. I found a teaspoon of salt to be plenty and I left in about 10 to 15 of the jalapeño seeds. I did chop the tomatillos first and while they were sitting the juice that they produced I drained; I like my salsa chunky. THANK YOU!

This was great and came out restaurant-quality. One could jar this and give it as a hostess gift! I made this is my Magic Bullet blender, so I had to cut the recipe down, but that was still plenty for my husband and I.

I love this salsa! The only thing I did different was keep the jalapeno seeds for heat. It was still mild for my taste. I'll tyr two jalapenos next time. Even without the heat I'm used to this is one of the best salsas I've ever tasted.

This is delicious and oh so easy!! I used 2 jalapenos as my husband and I are used to spicy cajun food. I also added a dash of dried oregano and a little lime juice. I used this in Pork Enchiladas and the tomatillos set the pork off beautifully! My husband is already asking when this dish will be supper again! :) thanks for a great recipe

This salsa was pretty good, I was not blown away but it was still pretty good... I made it as described. Next time I may try adding some red tomatoes or some other spices maybe.

Really good. Tried it for Cinco de Mayo.   Nice and spicy.  I substituted pickled jalapenos for fresh and garlic for shallots.  Even my husband - who is not fond of hot food enjoyed it.

This would have been awesome, except I tried to spice it up a bit by using 2 jalapenos and leaving the seeds in. Big mistake! One would've been plenty! If you like it hotter, start with 1 and work your way up. 

I also added some fresh diced kiwi and a squirt of lime.

Excellent recipe!  I substituted a regular onion, and use 3 jalapenos and serrano pepper as well (we like ours with a lot of heat).  I also add a little lime juice as well.

Right ingredients, but the result has a little bitter/sour edge.  A Mexican restaurant I like serves this, but it didn't have that edge.  I was told the chef adds orange juice for better consistency and flavor.  It works!!  Balances it all.  Add 3 tablespoons to start, then to taste.

I doubled the amount of tomatillas since I used canned ones and they aren't as big. Doubled the garlic for flavor. Didn't bother with the canned chiles because of the tomtillas.  Used 6 fresh jalapenos leaving the seed in 3, but we like spicy!  Very good. Use 2 habaneros with seeds removed for a similar hot salsa.  Served it with baked chips and fresh veggies,  Yum!

This had insteresting flavor but its missing something . . . salt? Looking back I realized I didnt add any. I dont know if my tomatillo's were all that fresh either so I might try this one more time before I cancel it out altogether. Has potential, just missing something. But it's definatly easy to make.

Used red onion instead of shallots because that's what I had on hand. Used 2-3 jalapenos, added white sugar and lemon juice. The sugar counters the acidity and adds some depth to the flavor. It was an amazing, mild salsa.

I didn't have any shallots or jalapenos so I substituted with leeks and Serrano peppers which worked just fine.

I'm growing tomatillos this summer so I made this green salsa. And it's amazing! I roasted my tomatillos and jalapeno pepper first, plus I added fresh lime juice. The flavor is wonderful with just a little kick. Next time I want to add avocado. For now, I can't wait to serve this!

The 8 tomatillos listed only makes a small batch.  I did about 1.5 lbs of them instead. I cut them in half and placed them faced down on a baking sheet.  Along side them I had two jalapeños halved faced down and one entire head of garlic and then 6 thick sliced pieces of white onion.  I roasted mine in the oven for 10 minutes at 425 and then I broiled them at 400 for 5 minutes more.  Put them all into the blender along with the cilantro diced green chilies and a pinch of salt.  Tasted fabulous but I think next time I may add a serrano pepper too.

Very good and very easy.  I grilled the jalapeno (and used the entire pepper), shallots and tomatillos before blending.  Next time I will either cut the shallots down to one or just use a large slice of yellow onion that I have grilled.  Using the seeds and veins of the jalapeno made it nicely spicy.

I used this recipe in lieu of bottled green salsa, as suggested by another reviewer, when making Andy's slow-cooker spicy green pork chili (also on this site).
Because the chili called for serrano pepper, I used a serrano instead of a jalapeño for this recipe also and added 1/4 tsp of both cumin and New Mexico chili powder as well. 
This recipe was so easy I'll never buy bottled green salsa  again.

Roasted the veggies on high in the broiler for 10 minutes first. Removing the garlic after the first 5 so as not to burn it. Made about a pint. Roasting the veggies makes all the difference. Smells wonderful. The taste is sweet as candy to start. Add fire as appropriate (chilies).

This is a great starter recipe! I did add an extra jalapeño, juice from 1 lime and roasted the tomatillos, garlic and shallots. Turned out wonderful!

my husband and i made this and loved it.  We used green onions (didnt have shallots) and used fresh green chili peppers. We also  added just under a tsp  if canning salt and 2 tblsp of fresh lime juice... wow it was awesome  we will make again.

I really wish this recipe gave a starting point on the size of peppers and shallots to use. I went with only 2 shallots and was way too much!  Feel it needs lime juice as well. Also you basically have to dice everything before putting it in the blender because it won't blend otherwise.

Very good as is, lots of compliments.  Can add more heat if you like the heat. This version is milder.

Easy to make and great flavor! Much better than store-bought green salsa I usually use.
