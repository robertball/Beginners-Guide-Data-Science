Good stuff!  I took a tiny slice off the bottom so they would sit upright.  I also added some roasted garlic to the mix and it was a little creamier.  I put it in a ziplock, snipped the corner off and piped into the tomato cups.

I thought this was a great recipe!  Well worth the time of hollowing out all those cherry tomatoes (I doubled the recipe).  I used it for my boyfriends art opening and people loved them!  I did take other reviewers advice and did not use any salt and it was a good thing I did.  It would have been way too salty otherwise.  I also used a combination of feta and crumbled blue cheese for added flavor.

I really enjoyed these.  Made them for a party and they were a big hit.  I used a serrated grapefruit spoon to do the tomatoes, which worked well.

YUM!!  This was the best.  

I wanted to note a cool modification on this recipe.  One of my roommates is lactose intolerant (so obviously, he can't have cheese).  I bought some tofu and substituted it for the goat cheese in his "stuffed tomatoes".  I was a little worried how it would turn out, in fact I told him that if it was "gross" that he didn't have to eat it.  I stuffed one tomato for him and had him try it, and he thought it was GREAT.  The only change he would make is that next time I should buy the "extra firm" tofu instead of the "firm" tofu.  So I was pleasantly surprised that the substitution worked.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It was easier than I thought it would be!

So easy; I actually used a pastry bag to fill the tomatoes.  In a pinch I once used the prepared cheese spread (Alouete etc.).  Will definately make this again!!

This ROCKS!  I'm lazy, so I just bought basil goat cheese and stuffed it in.  These disappear so fast!  We have a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes this year, so everyone gets to try these!

We had a progressive dinner in our neighborhood, and I was first in line. These were the hit of the day.  Everybody ate them...and I was almost afraid I didn't have enough.  I did what some other people said and omitted the salt in the filling, but put them on a bed of kosher salt to keep them standing.  I also did one batch with gorgonzola cheese...they were also delicious. I also followed advice and use a melon scooper.  Super easy!!

My girlfriends request these appetizers for every party we have.  Everyone seems to love them!  I omit the extra salt and add garlic powder and black pepper to taste.  Fabulous recipe...well worth the effort!

I made these without any changes to the recipe but wish I had left out the salt it was a little too salty.  Made them a 2nd time cut out the salt and used dill my family preferred this over basil.  Also used tips from prior reviews, I sliced a little off the bottom of the tomatoes this made them stand up easier on the plate and used a ziplock bag like a pasty bag to fill the tomatoes.

Great presentation and taste. I have made these also with a blue cheese/cream cheese mixture thinned a little with milk (leave out the basil) as well as using Alouette herbed cream chese.

A tip: gently squeezt the tomatoes to get most of the innards out. Then put them in a strainer with a bit of salt and let sit for about 30 minutes. It makes prep time much faster. For those of you around a Trader Joe's. just stuff them with TJ's yummy four mushroom and goat cheese spread. So easy and tasty.

I just made this for a party but used the food processor to chop up walnuts and mash them into the goat cheese before filling. It was fabulous as the textures change up a bit and the walnuts are ever so subtle.

I just made a quick bunch of these and I didnt have goat cheese (which I will try) but I used feta and it worked well. I didnt add salt to the mix but I did sprinkle some kosher salt on after. I also drizzled with olive oil when I was done then rolled them around to get it all over them. I also used a paring knife and that was perfect. Verg good and cant wait to try with goat cheese.

Used Humboldt Fog - top shelf goat cheese and it was good.  Please not that most people (like me) who cannot eat dairy, have no problem wtih goat-milk products.  Let's face it all you foodies, a key to good cooking is good ingredients.  Have also made using dill in place of basil and have also used cilantro.

I prepared these exactly as written and I thought the goat cheese with the fresh basil tasted pretty good, but then I added 2 fresh minced garlic cloves, and that's what it needed.  Everybody really liked them which is a good thing since it took me forever to hollow out the cherry tomatoes and then stuff them.  All in all, I'd definately make these again, I'd just make sure I have plenty of time and patience before hand.

I made these for a work function and they went over well. Didn't add any salt because I wasn't sure what it was supposed to add to the tomato, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed. I garnished the dish with a few fresh basil leaves.

I would make these again but only if cherry tomatoes are in season. Not only are they fresher, but they are wickedly expensive out of season. This quickly became a very expensive little snack.

I tried using a bag with a hole cut in the corner and piping in the filling but it made a mess. Just use a small spoon and your finger! So much easier...

Lastly, does anyone have a good use for the tomato tops and guts? For as much as I'm paying for the cherry tomatoes, it feels like a waste to throw so much away.

My DH did not like it. He ate one, made a face, and said, wow, the herbs taste really... fresh. Instead of stuffing the rest of the cherry tomatoes I left the feta mixture as a dip, and it didn't make it to the party... 'cause I ate it. It tastes like summer in a bite! I will be making more, and not sharing any with the DH!

SO GOOD!! This recipe was awesome! My whole family loved it! The only things I changed were: I added roasted red peppers on top of each tomato, and I cooked them at 350 for about 12 minutes...with a bit of olive oil sprinkled on top. Otherwise, this was a hit with everyone! Thank you :)

These were good. The tomatos took a while to hollow out, but my husband loves them.  I mixed goat cheese with a garlic herb cheese (e.g. boursin) and added just a little olive oil to combine. I did not add any salt, which was good.  I stuffed the tomatos, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled the basil on top.  They were a huge hit, and my husband asks for them all the time!

Very good recipe and easy to modify!  I used a knife to clear the cherry tomatoes and used a baggie with a corner cut off as a pastry bag.  I used some prepared cheese spread and mixed in some blue cheese.  Yum!  I'm going to try this with grape tomatoes as well.

I make this for all the parties, however I add feta and a few other herbs to spice it up. Even though it's time consuming to stuff all those tomatos it's definitely worth it.

Well I guess I semi had this because there isn't goat cheese here in Korea. I used cream cheese with a splash of cream. We really enjoyed them and it would probably be a really good appetizer at a party.

My tip is to not use light goat cheese as they add extra sodium and it overwhelms the tomato.  It wasn't as easy as I had thought it would be to remove the tops and carve out the middle so be prepared to use some muscle and ruin some cherry tomatoes in the process.  

It's a different type of appetizer that looks better than it tastes. Overall it was okay but I wouldn't make it again.

These were good...I did as most others suggested and mixed the goat cheese with some (fat-free) cream cheese. My grocery store was completely sold out of fresh basil the day I went, so I subbed some dried. I really enjoyed these and would definitely make them again, although they are a bit time consuming. I would probably think twice before making them for a large party or event, but a small quantity is totally manageable.

I was expecting alot of work creating these little beauties, but I had some issues with the ingredients themselves. I had to add cream chese to the goat cheese which improved the texture tremendously. Before adding the cream cheese, the mixture was too brittle and crumbly to work with. I used prepared basil from a spice jar and found that approximately 2 tablespoons was more than enough or the mixture would have looked more black than white. I have never had a problem substituting basil from the spice jar for fresh basil before. Cutting and gutting the tomatoes did not actually require too much effort, but I found myself getting a bit short on patience with the stuffing procedure. This could be because I had these for an appetizer on Thanksgiving and I was a bit busy preparing the actual meal. I thought I had this covered as I did everything the night before except prepare the cheese mixture (easy) and stuff the tomatoes. I had some leftover goat cheese and this recipe was the perfect solution, but I would add the cream cheese again simply to improve the texture. For those who are budget-conscious, adding cream cheese is also an inexpensive way to stretch the amount of servings. This was not my intention, but the wonderful goat cheese flavor did not suffer at all. In the long run, these were quite tasty, but I don't think the taste was really worth the effort or the cost of goat cheese. I might make these again someday, but it won't be for awhile and not on Thanksgiving.

These were a bit of work to put together (which is expected stuffing anything), but not fantastic in the end.  The flavour is nice, but a bit bland even with the fresh basil.

These were a huge hit at my party.  I left out the salt as sugested.  I found it easier to take the inside of the tomato with my fingers (but I have small fingers).  I would also say don't  over fill that way the goat cheese wont be too overpowering.  It ia a really great  combination of tastes.

I've made it twice now. My bridge group just loves it! The cherry tomatoes I used were so large that I just cut them in half. It was much easier to remove the seeds that way too. Both times I varied the recipe by using 1/4 cup feta cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup of my home made pesto. Just mixed it altogether and spooned it into the tomato halves. Lots of great flavor and I love these little appetizers too!

I played around with the filling in small batches. Fresh basil, goatcheese,olive oil,white balsamic and pepper. I found was the tastiest. And only because I has some, I quartered a fresh raspberry and put it on top just to try it. It was yummy!!!

These little tomatoes are so easy to make and such a hit! Both fresh or freeze dried basil works great and if you put your filling into a ziplock bag and snip a corner, you can easily pipe it right into the wee tomatoes. It does a great job. The also can be make the day ahead. Just make sure to thoroughly gut your tomatoes. A nice, sharp paring knife will be your best friend. :)

These were delicious! I made them exactly according to this recipe, but I did slice a little tomato off the bottom of tomato cups to stand upright.  I will make these again for sure, and next time, I will add a little roasted garlic as suggested by another reviewer.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were fun and easy to make. I wanted to do a practice run before I use them for a party in a few weeks. I had a local fresh goat cheese that already contained garlic and herbs so I simply mixed the goat cheese with olive oil and stuffed. On my first attempt I tried to cut a sliver off the bottom off the tomatoes so they would stand straight but I felt like that really compromised the size of the tomatoe and it was harder to clean the tomatoes with out cutting completely through them. I ended up just leaving them wobbly  but it worked out fine for me. Yummy, will use for my party

I'm not too crazy about goat cheese so I decided to just use Chive and Onion Cream Cheese.  They turned out great!! Everyone loved them.  I'll have to agree with everyone on how hard it is to scoop these out and stuff them. A dinner knife worked the best for me as far as stuffing but it's still really hard to make it a pretty appetizer.  They were a hit though.

Delicious if you love goat cheese, but they do take time.  I did as others did and mixed the goat cheese with a little cream cheese to make it smoother.

Served these for a tea party yesterday. I was a bit worried that my guests would not care much for them but they were the first thing to go. Obviously I will need to make more next time. Even with the tip from another reviewer to use a serrated grapefruit spoon hulling the tomatoes did take a bit of time (about 20 min for 30 tomatoes) but the serrated spoon worked great to not destroy the shape of the tender tomato. Used kitchen shears to snip the basil in tiny pieces without bruising. Also used tip to put cheese mix in ziploc and snip corner for easy filling - this part was a breeze. Thank you for a great recipe.

Tasty, but too time consuming to stuff all those tiny tomatoes!  Better if you chill the goat cheese mixture for a few hours to let the flavors mingle.

This was excellent! Everyone at our Christmas Eve Dinner raved. Next time, I might add just a little Red Wine Vinegar to the goat cheese mixture. I also used Garlic flavored feta cheese instead of goat cheese (isn't feta cheese goat cheese?)

Took a little longer to make than I thought; taking out the insides of the tomatoes and 'piping' in the cheese. Overall, a good appetizer.

I started off making this as written, after a taste test though I realized that every person in my family is repulsed by goat cheese. I switched to blue cheese. These were tasty, but just not worth the effort to me. They're " formal" looking. I will not be making again.

The only problem I had with this was not eating all the tomatoes as I was making this!  It's a bit labor intensive, but a very good combination.

I had a few rude guests complain that there was too much basil, but I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I followed two other reviewers' advice and used a grapefruit knife and arranged them on a bed of kosher salt.  Well worth the prep time!

So good! I did use a herbed goat cheese and the blu cheese like another reviewer mentioned. 
Also a fun serving tip: on a platter put a layer of coarse kosher salt and place tomatoes on top of the salt. Its a pretty presentation and the tomatoes dont roll all over your dish.

This recipe was pretty good. We did make some changes since goat cheese can be pretty expensive we bought instead this soft dutch cheese similar in texture and mixed it with a little cream cheese. My husband totally loved them and they even kept well overnight with leftovers.

Beware the lengthy preparation time scooping and draining the tomatoes!!  I ended up piping in the processed cheese (that comes in a can) because it took so long.  Add parsley or paprika and item is a nice-looking and tasty appetizer.
