Yum! They came out perfectly - and rose very nicely. I could see adding a little more Grand Marnier and orange zest next time for a more pronounced flavor, but it was a light, airy, subtle and absolutely delicious desert. :)

Absolutely delicious. We returned from a trip to France, and I knew I had to learn how to make this wonderful dessert. I followed the recipe exactly along with the Grand Marnier Anglaise Ssauce (which I made the evening before). I do recommend watching Chef John's video to get a good feel for how long to cook the flour and butter and how far to whip the egg yolks at various stages. Not only is the video very helpful, he's quite entertaining. After cooking as directed, I quickly sprinkled powdered sugar on the souffle before serving and then let each guest spoon the Grand Marnier Anglaise Sauce into the top of their souffle. I prepared as much as I could before my guests arrived -- had everything measured everything out, zested, separated eggs. They were amazed and duly impressed. Exquisite dessert!

Not enough orange flavour, definitely will add more next time. Good base Soufflé for other flavours.

Worked perfectly.  I didn't use the creme anglaise recipe here, I used a different one on you tube.  However the soufflé turned out perfect.  Yes, you have to eat it right out of the oven or it will deflate.  I doubled the soufflé recipe to make 4.  Likewise I had 7oz ramekins, so I filled it to the top.  Looked just like the pictures in the video and tasted fabulous.  It was surprisingly easy to make.
  There were three of us, the picture ( I accidentally added the picture twice, it's the lone soufflé in the blue ramekin on the tinfoil covered baking pan on the stove) is the extra one which we quickly devoured. The other three were better looking, but the extra was darn near perfect too.  I did cheat and used an electric hand mixer on the egg whites.

I added a little flaked coconut to the top of these before baking - fabulous! I also used gluten free flour (cup 4 cup) in place of regular flour.

Sooooo delicious! I had smaller ramekins so I halved the recipe but then ended up not having enough. I did struggle a little with the roux, I couldn’t get mine to look like his in the video, but it still turned out great!! Didn’t rise quite as much but still airy, light and yummy!

very good, but i suppose i should have served it straight from the oven since it severely deflated after it cooled down a little bit.

I had to make some compromises due to not having the correct size ramekins but it was still delicious. I'll agree with the person that said it needed modifications. Maybe I missed it somewhere but I did use large eggs and I had to add a little more sugar to the whites for the 'almost' meringue. The sauce was definitely a must. Will make this again and again and again...especially since the bottle of Grand Marnier I had to buy cost me about $25.

This souffle turned exceptionally light and delicious.  The Grand Marnier came through loud and clear.  I made an extra 1/2 of batter for 3 souffles which was super easy.   Tasted divine with the Creme Anglaise Sauce.
The video was excellent at showing exactly what each stage should look like.  Well worth watching!

Addendum to my last post from a while back. I am making it gluten free. I had just switch over all purpose flours from one I mix to one that is made by a well known flour company. That flour doesn't work to make a rue, so I ended up adding way too much flour.  Needless to say, it was under cooked and took longer. My homemade a.p. flour works just like normal flour.

The taste was superb, the souffle rose and sank in the oven itself....
where could I have gone wrong?

OMG DELICIOUS!! Thank you for the easy instructions , and the very informative video.  I've had this dessert at a French restaurant, and this recipe is probably  better! I did add another tablespoon of Grand Marnier  though, based on the other  reviews.  Next time I'll double or triple the recipe, 2 ramekins weren't enough lol.

Very easy recipe. Pretty spectacular results. Very entertaining process what with the roux. Never done that before and it was a starting transformation. And end result was utterly delicious.
I did alter it by substituting lemon zest for orange zest and lemoncello for Gran Marnier.

Loved it. Didn't have orange liqueur so I used orange extrait and since I am lactose intolerant, I used substituted regular milk for soy milk. It came out perfectly and didn't even collapse when it came out of the oven. I also used a pinch of cream of tartar in the egg whites to keep them firm. Eating it felt like eating a soft cloud of goodness.

I didnt have liquer, so I subbed half rum extract half vanilla extract. I was pretty worried it wouldnt turn out. I ended up having to bake it an extra 10 minutes for it to rise and it didnt rise quite like the one in the picture but it still tasted amazing and in the end that's really what counts lol.

Just made this over the Memorial Day weekend for a dinner party with 6 guests.  It was a huge hit.  I did make the base ahead of time and folded in the egg whites at the last minute.  Everyone raved about it.  I also made Chef John's Creme Anglaise and poured it in the middle.  Highly recommend.  I've never gone wrong with a Chef John recipe.

Very light and fluffy. I would recommend putting them in at 180°c for 16 minutes though. P.s. make sure the rack about your soufflé is at least two sets above it... And they shrink after a while out of the oven

It was surprisingly simple and didn’t take nearly as much time as I had thought. More importantly, thanks to this recipe, I’m at a new level of sexy w/ my wife. Thanks, Chef John!

This was amazing. Served it with the creme anglais recommended and linked in the chef's recommendation beneath the recipe and didn't change anything on either recipe. I added about 1 tsp orange zest to the creme (adding an unspecified amount was recommended in that recipe). 

This is a showstopper. A very impressive and delicious dish. Perfect for date night!

My 7 year old and I made this together. Awesome! Next time I will use my electric mixer for those egg whites.

Fabulous dessert.  Easy, elegant, smooth flavors.  I bake mine 16 full minutes and serve immediately.  Great for a special occasion.

I absolutely love this dish!!! The taste is soooo amazing. I've made it about 3+ times this month. I made the orange crème sauce and its lasted all these times. But for SOME REASON it ALWAYS FALLS. taste is in point but it comes out nice, then falls. Not sure what I'm doing wrong

Spectacular and I really enjoy Chef John's lesson.   This was easier than I thought because chef John was so easy to follow.

Read some reviews and watched the video - wish I would have read them all or Chef John would have suggested the mixer for beating the egg whites.  My arm gave out and I finally gave in and used it.  Next time it will be out and prepped.  Everyone love it.  I doubled the recipe (no need to double the Creme Anglaise Sauce).  I think next time I'm going to substitute Bailey's,  Frangelico, or raspberry liquer.  There are so many options.  But I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely love this recipe. I substituted an Earl Grey Cream Tea syrup (homemade with tea and sugar reduced) instead of Grand Marnier. My partner also made the suggested Creme Anglaise with the Earl Grey syrup and boy did we have a food high after eating these. We love Chef John! Delicious and decadent yet a light dessert.

We made it exactly per recipe and video, except for doubling up to make 4 desserts.  It was as good as any we ever had. It took longer to make than suggested, but we expect to trim the time down the next time.

I've made this souffle three times, and it's always come out fluffy and tasty. If you don't have Grand Marnier on you, it's completely fine. Very impressed with this recipe and will continue using it.

All I can say is Wow!

This was my first time making a souffle and it turned out really well.  It didn't rise as much as I thought it would but it still tasted delicious and was really fluffy.  Instead of the Grand Marnier, I used Triple Sec (which wasn't a brandy-based liqueur).  I'd recommend this to anyone.

This was absolutely awesome.   Every bit as good as the one I had in the French restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia.   The Anglaise sauce makes all the difference in the world.   Heaven in a bite!

These were perfection! And the video was so helpful in the process. I served them with a chocolate sauce vs the creme anglaise because I was trying to duplicate a dish I had at Rise No. 1 in Dallas. These were actually better. I guess I won't be spending big bucks on my favorite soufflé anymore. Thanks!!!
