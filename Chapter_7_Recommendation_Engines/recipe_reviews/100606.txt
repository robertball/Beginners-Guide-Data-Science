This is the same recipe I have used for years.  We love it. The only thing I do different is I use  2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar instead of white sugar.  The same amount.   Try it you will like it.   My son makes excellent Bulgogi and egg rolls.   This is the recipe that we use.  We buy a good beef loin and freeze it.   That makes it easier to slice.   He slices it very thin and then we marinate.  We also use this marinade on chicken and pork.  It is delicious.

I consider myself a bit of a bulgogi connoisseur. I first tried bulgogi at church potlucks as a child. A sweet lady in our church always made it, since everyone requested it. Since I've grown up, I'm always on the search for Korean restaurants serving up some delicious bulgogi. Let me say, my search will go no further than my kitchen from now on. Love, love, LOVE this recipe. I was worried about making it from scratch as I have no real experience cooking any sort of Korean food, but I'm glad I tried it.  Couple of tips. If you have a larger food processor with a slicer blade, run your slightly frozen beef through it. So ridiculously thin! Also, if you don't have access to a grill, go ahead and make it in a very hot skillet on the stove.

Really good! I followed the recommendation of another user and used brown sugar in place of white. I also inculded a diced kiwi to tenderize the meat. I marinated for 6 hours and think next time I will leave it in overnight, just so the flavor has more time to soak in. But a truly great recipe! Yum!
 
EDIT: I made this again and it marinated for two days, which was WAAAYYY too long! The soy sauce overpowered the other flavors. My recommendation is to marinate for no more than 24 hrs!

Okay I'm that guy who is just starting to cook....I'm still pretty bad, no lie.  But when I made this dish last night, I felt like a chef.  This was the best thing I've ever made and words cannot describe how delicious this was.  I served it over egg noodles because that's really all I had besides rice.  I added a little soy to the marinade and added a little extra garlic.  There's no way you can screw this up unless you cook the london broil too long or don't slice it thin enough.  I had never even heard of Beef Bulgogi before finding this (and I still don't know how to pronounce it).  But I know now.  Awesome.

Delicious!  I love the meat wrapped in a lettuce leaf - very colourful and lower in calories.  Served with a side of steamed rice, this version of beef bulgogi couldn't be better.  I used a grill pan on the stove and crisped the ribs under the broiler.  It would be best on an outdoor grill but I don't have one.  Your mother makes GREAT food - thanks!

Loved this recipe! I do think we'd add a little sugar (yeah, I know that seems like a lot) and a little red pepper flake and marinate overnight (we only marinated about 3 hours), but this was great especially served with cellophane noodles, sliced lettuce, spinach, carrot, and green onion (with a little extra soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger on the noodles and salad). Easy, killer dinner!

This is just ok. Probably worth 3 stars. DH's best friend's parents are from Korea and I'm sure it's just regional that makes the difference but we learned from his parents to use pear or kiwi in the marinade. If you do, only marinate for 20-30 min. We also use tri tip, which is personal preference. Grilling is also the best and I recommend using brown sugar instead of white, but again, that is personal preference.

Shared this with neighbor who served with the army in Korea and fell in love with the cuisine. He says this is as good as it gets. We did use the red leaf lettuce and the hot pepper paste. Very flavorful, very spicey and oh so good!!

Very good! I've always wanted to try this since our meat depart. has cut bulgogi. I wasn't able to grill, so I broiled it.  Next time I will just stir fry and then thicken the marinade so I have a sauce to go over the rice.  UPDATE:  Sesame noodles make a perfect combination.

I've made this recipe a few times and have made a few changes.  Really good as is but I made it easier for me.  Instead of 5 tablespoons soy sauce I use 1/3 cup, just easier to measure.  I like to use a garlic press so instead of 2 tablespoons garlic I used 1 tablespoon crushed garlic.  I also used only 1 tablespoon seasame seeds instead of 2.  I only marinate for two hours, it's all the time it needs as the meat is sliced so thin.  The last change was how I grilled the beef.  I used skewers and skewered the meat back and forth onto the skewers.  It made it easy to manage the meet on the grill.  But like I said, recipe is 5 star already.  It's so tender and flavorful!

Excellent spice mixture.  I cooked this a bit differently and it turned out well.  Used an inside round roast and cut it up into stewing beef cubes instead of using flank steak. Froze the entire thing in a ziplock bag to use in my crock pot at a later date.  I'm always looking for recipes that can be adapted to the freezer and then crock pot for those busy week nights. Served over rice or noodles.  Yummy!

I LOVED this.  I wrapped it in lettuce like you suggested, didn't have red pepper paste so I added red pepper flakes and chili oil to the sauce and it was SO good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made as written and then served it over some leftover coleslaw/cabbage mix that needed used up. I sauteed the cabbage mix in olive oil and added garlic chili sauce for heat and this was superb! Can't wait to make again!

followed the recipe exactly except I grilled the flank steak whole till med-rare and let it rest for 10 mins and then thinly sliced it. We ate it in lettuce leaves with steamed rice and sweet chili sauce.The meat was flavorful and juicy. My fam was in heaven.

First of all, I couldn't grill this because there was something wrong with the propane. I sauteed these on the stove inside.

That said, the steak turned out fine, but it had a slightly bitter taste. The marinade wasn't too great. Maybe it needs less soy sauce.

Costco bulgogi is a TON better.

This was delish but since I never had Korean food I can't compare it. Having said that..my second biggest issue was cutting the meat very thin. The only knife that worked in my kitchen was my Yoshi ceramic blade! (Yes, real people do buy those "as seen on t.v. things). My biggest issue was grilling those thin strips. That was not easy. I looked through alot of reviews and nobody really mentioned that. They have to be turned so fast and there's alot of slices!  I lost a few soldiers in between the grates on the grill. :(.  Of course, I also picked a day where it could NOT have been raining any harder so there we were under the golf umbrella, which added to the difficulty. It was a two person job as it was. Next time I will look for another cooking method, or make less.  The perfect way would be on one of those professional frying surfaces but since I don't have that... maybe the George Forman? Also I would make more marinade and warm that up to put over the rice.  The flavor was really good. TY TNCOUCH.

I made the recipie just as it was written, and it was fine.  However it was all very one note, and needed a greater depth of flavor to be really good.  

My reccomendations would be to add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, a teaspoon of finely chopped ginger and some kind of citrus or kiwi.

Overall, it was good - not great, but I think it could be with some help.

this was excellent. I've since made this twice since discovering this recipe a month ago.  I only marinated the beef for an hour. it was cut so thinly it did not need any more time than that. I also did not grill it, I used the stovetop method and I cannot imagine doing it any other way. Its a lot juicier off the stove top. I served this with basmati, red leaf lettuce and homemade thai chili sauce. (chili paste, pinch of brown sugar, rice vinegar and minced garlic) I also made the allrecipes thai cucumber salad

WOW!  DELICIOUS!  I've never made anything Korean or used sesame seed or sesame seed oil.  I was a little nervous because the marinade didn't smell good at all.  I thought maybe the great reviews were coming from people who were accustomed to Korean food and the flavors and thought UH OH!  But it was SOOOO great.  A definite go-to recipe when I have flank steak in the frig.

UPDATE:  I've made this several times now, with sirlion and every porterhouse steak.  I slice them thin and skewer them and serve them at picnics, cookouts, etcl.  Always a big hit.

This was really, really, REALLY good!!!  The marinate was to die for.  Semi froze the flank and it was easy to get thin slices.  I did let it marinate for at least 5 hours.  Never have eaten Beef Bulgogi before, so, didn't really know what side dishes to serve with it.  Next time I will double the marinate---keeping some to cook at the end and serve with the meat and rice.  Found the red leaf lettuce too flimsy---next time I'll try a different lettuce.  Made a cucumber salad as others suggested & thought it was a good compliment.

Delicious and easy! I let the meat marinate overnight and stir fried it. Fiance and I were very pleased with the results. Will definitely make again!

This is awesome, I have put it over rice, and with sesame noodles.

For a real treat, cut it into tiny strips/pieces, put on a small flour tortilla with a slice of bacon, some cilantro, sliced green onions, and drizzle your favorite teriyaki glaze. For the best soft tacos you have ever wrapped your lips around.

It is an awesome asian/mexican fusion dish my wife and I make for our company. A hit 100% of the time!

I just made this recipe for the first time tonight. As some reviewers suggested, I substituted brown sugar for white sugar; other than this one change I followed the recipe as written (I marinated the meat for 24 hours). I cooked it on the stovetop rather than grilling it, and it was AMAZING! It only took about 10 minutes on medium heat to cook it all. We boiled the leftover marinade to thicken it to use as sauce. I will definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this recipe! We wrapped the beef (flank steak) in lettuce with a scoop of rice and some hot chile sauce. (I passed on the hot sauce), but I also made a dipping sauce to spoon over the rice which was great. Since the beef was sliced so thin, I just spread it out on a broiler pan, covered in foil.  The meat was so thin that I didn't have to flip it - it was nice and tender.  I added a picture of what it looked like on the broiler pan after it came out of the oven.

We will make this again!

I've made these twice and it's a 5 star recipe with no modifications needed! The first time I prepared them on the grill exactly as directed. The second time, I sliced and cooked it in my wok tossing it with a quick vegetable yakisoba noodle stir-fry when we had to extend it into dinner for 10 for an impromptu dinner party. Best of all, this recipe freezes well, and is a favorite with my Make-Ahead Meals cooking group. Make two tonight, and freeze one for later!

Will use more of all ingredients besides the beef so there's a nice amount of gravy next time... It was really YUM with garlic rice!

Pretty tasty.  Needed some ginger or something though.  Only had time to marinade for a couple of hours.  I'm sure overnight would have been better.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I didn't have flank steak so I used some other steaks (not sure what kind) I had in the freezer and thinly sliced it before putting in the marinade.  It's too cold to grill right now so I just cooked the marinated strips on the stove top. I'll be making it again, so tender and tasy!!  Thanks for sharing.

very tasty! I omitted sesame seeds and substituted Sambal Oleck for the black pepper, marinated overnight and served with stir fried vegetables and brown rice.

I thought this was one of the better marinades I have tried.  It had the perfect balance of flavors.  I used flat iron steak and marinated it for 8 hours.  It was perfect.  This will be my go to marinade in the future.

We loved this recipe and it was really easy!  I did have to improvise a little because I did not have green onions or 2 TBS on sesame oil.  I used just 1 TBS and 1/4 of a white onion finely minced and used brown sugar as others suggested.  I also cooked it more like a stir fry in a hot sauté pan but it still came out wonderfully.  Served it with white rice and hot pepper sauce wrapped in an iceberg lettuce leaf and it was GREAT!  The family is already asking when we will have it again.

Very good, double the marinade so you have extra sauce to soak into the rice.  I also added a few very thinly sliced carrots....just my preference.

I made this for dinner tonight and my two girls ages 9 and 6 thought it was one of the best dinners I've ever made.  I had the butcher slice the meat for me ahead of time and cooked it on the George Forman since the slices were so thin.  It was delicious and very easy.  The kids liked putting the meat, rice and lettuce cups together. A huge hit in our house!

This was awesome!  I ended up stir frying this instead of grilling due to weather.  My son declared this his favorite dinner and asked for it again the next night.  He is a pizza kind of kid so that says a lot about this.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely 5 stars. I froze my beef 15 mins, then sliced, marinated for around 20 hours (used flatiron, which is more tender than flank, but I'm certain that flank would tenderize in that time too). We grilled ours in a vegetable basket, using grilling tongs to flip the pieces of meat til they got a nice char as recommended. Served with egg rolls, white rice, lettuce leaves (used iceberg, all the other kinds looked wilty that day) and chili-garlic sauce (a red sauce made by the Sriracha company which is much milder and thicker than actual Sriracha) and a PF Chang's knockoff green beans recipe (which I did not add to my profile because it didn't turn out for me, so don't bother looking on my profle!). I will absolutely make this recipe again, as soon as possible! Thank you! (For those who don't like spicy food, substitute duck sauce, plum sauce, hoisin sauce, or make a dim sum (steamed dumpling) sauce recipe from somewhere online. You won't regret trying this one if you like Asian food - it's worth the effort!

Great recipe! I substituted the sugar for 3 tbsp of pureed Asian pear (about half a small fruit), since it helps tenderize the beef a bit as well. As a result, I only marinated for about 30 min - 1 hr. Decreased to 3 tbsp of soy sauce to reduce the sodium and added julienned carrots for colour and nutrients. Probably would have added onion slivers too if I had any onions kicking around. You can easily double the marinade for extra sauce to serve over rice as well. For thinner slices of meat, partially freeze the steak before slicing - it makes slicing a lot easier. Stir fried over medium high heat til just done, and served it over rice with some Korean red pepper paste (gochujang). You could reserve some of the green onion and sesame seeds to sprinkle on top for presentation. This is a pretty quick recipe to make, and I've also marinated extra meat, which I placed into a plastic bag and froze for a quick meal later. It cooks up wonderfully (and I think more tender) when thawed from the freezer. Thanks for sharing!

I don't have a grill, so I cooked mine on a hot skillet with a little bit of oil for about 7 minutes (my flank steak was sliced extra thin) It was extremely easy and fast! Served it up with some white jasmin rice and broccoli. Good combo. I will recommend this recipe to  everyone.

This dish was wonderful!  Made as written, marinaded for 3 hours.  Got the grill very hot than cooked one minute on each side.  Freezing the meat for a little bit is the key to long thin slices.

Excellent flavor.  I made with NY strips, which happened to be on sale this week.  It was very good.  The kids loved it and we actually ran out of meat!  I will have to double next week.....

Only changes I made was I doubled it and didn't add sesame seeds (the commissary was out) but it was great. We had it for dinner and it was ok (only marinating an hour) but we then had it again for lunch the next day (the rest marinating over night ~18 hours) and it was so tasty! I would really recommend longer than an hour. Next time I'll add the sesame seeds but it was still perfect without them!

This is absolutely fantastic.  I was running low on soy sauce so I used about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 3 of soy sauce.  I don't have a grill so after it marinated for about 24 hours I put it in the broiler for just a few minutes. This was just absolutely amazing. My boyfriend couldn't say "Mmmmm" enough as he was cleaning his plate.  Thank you so much for your recipe!

Absolutely WONDERFUL!  I followed the marinade recipe but added 3 tablespoons of my favorite stir fry sauce (Yoshida).  I marinaded for 24 hours then sliced one onion and grilled it all together on a George Foreman.  The BEST bulgogi we have ever had, hands down.

I followed this recipe but instead of grilling, I fried it in a pan with two tablespoon of oil and with white onion, carrot. During serving, I laid rice on a green leaf lettuce and then poured the Bulgogi, also served garlic chili paste beside the rice.

My husband spent two tours in Korea. He really loved this recipe. In fact, everyone in my family said this was a keeper. Even my 6 year old loved it. I did not have any fresh garlic so I used garlic powder, I also used 1 sweet in lowpackage  instead of sugar, the final thing I changed was the cut of meat. I did not have any flank steak in the freezer so I used thin sirloin.

my husband liked it and so did the kids.  i think it was okay; i wasn't wowed at all by it.  i was really expecting something sweeter and more caramalized that what I got.  I followed the recipe to a T.  Since I've never had real Korean beef, I don't have anything to compare this recipe to.

We are huge fans of Bulgogi.  We sometimes host "hot rock" dinner parties.  This will be a fabulous edition to our menu.

After reading the reviews, I subbed brown sugar for white. I tenderized the meat on both sides before I partly froze it for 1 hr 15 min. Then I sliced it thin. The end result might be a little salty for some, so I would suggest using a low sodium soy sauce if possible. I also added approximately 1 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes for some zip in the marinade.  Finally, I added some fresh salad spinach on the same griddle I used to cook the meat. The experience reminded me of some of the Mongolian restaurants that we visit where they cook the food on a very hot round cooking surface for 3-4 minutes. The oil smokes a lot on top of the stove, so I can see how cooking outdoors would be advantageous whenever possible. Although I used rice, I can see how it can be combined a great number of ways. Even though I have never made Korean food before (so I have nothing to compare it to) the finished result was very flavorful!

Healthy and easy. I often eat these with chow mein noodles to add texture and chili paste to give it a kick.

Love this recipe! a tip from a Korean friend...add a kiwi or asain pear to marinate and further tenderize...but not too much or the beef will be stringy.

I did use substitute brown sugar; otherwise, I followed the recipe with delicious results. I marinated the meat overnight and this produced a tender meat with a nice balance of flavor.  Due the fact that Chicago is a winter wonderland today, I grilled mine indoors on the George Foreman with great success.

Excellent flavor & ease of preparation.  Other than reducing the amount of black pepper by half (personal preference,) I made the recipe as stated.  I cut the flat iron steak in half lengthwise to make a thinner slice of beef & sliced it into 6" sections for easier grilling.   The meat was marinated for 8 hours.  The meat was placed on the preheated grill &  each piece was topped with some of the marinade that was left in the bowl.  It took a few extra minutes to grill since the meat came straight out of the refrigerator.  I'd use thinly sliced rib eye steaks the next time as suggested by another Recipe Exchange member.  A little ginger added to the marinade would be a nice addition.

This was very very good! I did use regular sliced onions instead of green, and brown sugar instead of white. Past that the only thing I did differently was added mushrooms when cooking the beef in a hot frying pan. I served this with white rice and steamed vegtables(green beans, broccoli, cabbage, squash and zucchini.)

My husband is half Korean and wanted to make this for a BBQ we were having and it turned out AMAZING!  Not sure if it made much of a difference but we substituted 1 tablespoon of sugar with honey and we also added a 1/4 cup sprite and 2 tablespoons grated asian pear.  Our guests could not get enough.  This definitely deserves 5 stars!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! Beware that if you're cooking this in a pan as opposed to on a grill, the marinade burns easily. I tend to cook meat at a high temperature so it browns without overcooking. I do not add the marinade to the pan, it's just the small amount that's left on the beef, and it still left a terrible scorched mess on my pan. (Worth it, though, because it was delicious.) Served over rice with kimchi and pickled daikon & cucumbers.

This recipe was great. Local groceries didn't have any sesame seeds so we left that out. Marinated it for about 12 hours and the flavor really held. I prepared it for my husbands birthday party and many of the guests who don't typically enjoy Asian cuisine loved it. Served with spring rolls and sushi rice - yum!

we used this recipe to create ground beef bulgogi lettuce wraps. marinated 4 hours. cooked in pan at med-high heat, breaking meat in to fine crumbles. served with a side of white rice and iceberg lettuce that was quartered. sriracha is going well against this sweet marinade. cant wait to try this as instructed with flank steak!

This is the real thing--I lived over in Seoul for 2 years and this is authentic.  In fact, my hubby and I went to an "authentic" Korean rest. here in MD and it wasn't even close to this recipe!  Highly recommend! p.s. I marinated for 24 hours so not sure how the 1 hour thing works out.

Being raised on mostly Asian food, I love Bulgogi and Kalbi.  That said, this is a great recipe!  Very authentic, no need to make any changes at all.  I used flat iron steak, cut diagonally in thin strips.  Marinated for about two hours then put the strips on skewers to make grilling easier.  Cooking was quick and the meal was delicious!  The meat was super tender and tasty!  Thanks!

Amazing! The flavor is incredible. We thought we had to place foil on the grill so the meat wouldn't fall off initially so we did, but towards the end of grilling we realized we could move it right on the grill to get that nice grilled finish.  My whole family loved this dish- we wrapped it in baby lettuce with rice.I followed as written.

Wow, so good! I first made the mistake of not cooking it enough, like the sugars hasn't caramelized yet. It had nice flavor, but getting it caramelized is really the key to this. So I turned up the heat and rectified it.

Followed this as written and it was delicious. Will try brown sugar and thinner slices next time. We served with brown rice on lettuce and added Sriacha on a few pieces. Definitely delicious and if you have leftovers would probably be delicious in a stir fry!

This was absolutely delicious.  The only things I did differently was to add Sriracha to the marinade and although I didn't technically measure anything, I added a little more garlic than called for.  Everyone in the family really enjoyed it and unfortunately there was none left over for me to eat as a midnight snack.

This is the first time I've given a recipe 5 stars on this website. BF didn't change a thing and it came out absolutely amazing. It's delicious and tastes just like bulgogi I've had in Korean restaurants and at dinner in a Korean home. Had it with a side salad, steamed rice, fried egg and fermented red bean paste. Perfect dinner!

I loved this. I tried wrapping it in lettuce but I only had romaine and that really didn't work. So use different lettuce next time.

This was wonderfully delicious, and straight-forward to make.  I took the repeated users' suggestion to use brown sugar, marinaded an hour (it was all I had), and wrapped the eventual product in red leaf lettuce.  Definitely set off the fire alarm twice with all the smoke, but it was SO worth it.  I'll be making this again.  Many, many times.

I made this with flank, sliced very thinly marinated in sauce overnight.   We BBQed the meat and it was AMAZING.  The flavor was really good, a little sweet, a little smoky.   We served it over white rice after research and with the Spring Asparagus Salad also on All Recipes, and a side of fresh pineapple.   I HIGHLY recommend this dish.

first time to make beef bulgogi and loved it! i replaced the suggested meat with Beef Sukiyaki Cuts that i had in the freezer. Followed the rest of the recipe. After i had finished cooking i found that it was a bit to dry for me, and i preferred something more saucy, so i made the sauce again (just the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and green onions) and then poured it over the the cooked beef bulgogi! delicious.

Great flavor! Double marinade and reserve some for finished dish. Flank steak cooks fast!! Need to watch the grill or the meat will be tough. Next time I will use a more tender cut of meat. EXCELLENT RECIPE.

5 Stars for flavor.  I loved the sauce, and think it would be great as a marinade for almost any thing; I will be using it in place of teriyaki sauce in an upcoming recipe.

Delicious!  I made this exactly as written (well, I forgot to add pepper) and marinated almost an hour, then cooked the meat in a wok, added cooked lo mein noodles, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, more garlic, ginger, scallions, and the rest of the bulgogi marinade and 1:1 water/cornstarch to thicken a bit and a Tbl of hoisin sauce- a delightful beef lo mein!!!

Tasted just like the restaurant. I just wish I had a hot plate to keep the meat warm longer. Slicing the meat wasn't the easiest thing to do. Took some advice and froze it before slicing but its still quite difficult, even with a good knife. Worth the effort though. Served it with Korean cucumber salad and rice.

This recipe is ridiculously good! Our flank steak was almost 2 lbs and I'm glad we had more. Red leaf lettuce is a little flimsy to hold everything, so I'll use butter lettuce next time. We made our lettuce wraps with rice, rooster sauce, the bulgogi and asian cucumber salad. Fail proof!

that is really delicous, my husband loves it very much. i also added some vegetables into the sauce, such as onion, green pepper, carrot, and i love spicy, so also added a bit red pepper flake. when we ate with lettuce..mmm.. so good!! I also prepared some grilled cheese potato, since had to grill beef bulgogi at the same time.. we had a great dinner and for sure would make it again.

This is a great recipe. I am korean and I can attest to its authentic taste. I used yellow onions instead of green onions. As with kalbi, I like to chop up my onions with my hand blender/chopper. I also added a quarter of a korean pear (chopped with the onion) to soften the meat. When you cook the bulgogi, the onions carmelize and it adds such a great taste to the meat (try it with the kalbi recipe too). I also used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was perfect. I used bulgogi meat bought from the korean market. THanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe misses the major ingredients: minced ginger and Korean chili paste. If you don't have a grill, use a pan to make it stir-fried. Frozen thin sliced beef can be easily found in Asian stores. Marinate beef with some sauce mixture for 15-20 minutes before cooking them. My favorite vegetable to go with beef are onion and celery.

This was very good.  The meat was incredibly tender.  I've made it under the broiler and on top of the stove and both came out wonderfully.  The only things I plan on changing for the next time is to use low sodium soy sauce and probably not marinade it for so long (I marinated for about 20 hours) because it was a little on the salty side.

I used this recipe with venison instead of beef and it was great. I substituted 1 Tbs of honey for the sugar. I used flax seeds instead of sesame seeds. I only used 1 tsp of sesame oil added to 2 tsp olive oil instead of the Tbs of sesame oil. I have never had bugogi before so have no idea if what I made tasted the same but it was very good.

This is hands down the best recipe I've tried. Very very flavorful, easy to prepare and my entire family loved it. I did add just a touch of ginger and followed another users advice to skewer the meat to make grilling easier and it worked like a charm! I will definitely make this again!

Pretty yummy! I'll share with y'all our family secret - substitute fruit for the sugar. I recommend one kiwi per pound of meat. This requires, obviously using a blender, but it really makes a difference! Makes the meat so tender and moist, you can cook without having to marinate!

I used a brisket, braggs liquid aminos (inplace of soy sauce) and a yellow onion sliced thin.  I also added about 1 TBS apple cider vinegar, the rest according to the recipe.  I marinated 3-5 hours then cooked in a HOT cast iron skillet that I had let pre heat.  I added the marinade to the pan once all the meat was finished cooking and added the meat back in to keep it all warm and cook the "Sauce".  YUMMY!  Next time 1/3 less braggs should make it perfect (it was a bit too salty).  THANK YOU!!

This recipe is good. I would recommend marinating overnight for more flavor. Also serve with lettuce cups filled with rice. I would also make a little marinade to serve as a sauce onto of the meat. Very good recipe and i will make again.

Very good recipe! Follow it as is, and you'll get the perfect taste. I made it like 4 times till now and it never failed!
Once I didn't have soy sauce, so I used balsamic vinegar, and used 2 tbsps white sugar + 1/2 tbsp molasses.. tasted really good as well. I definitely recommend :))

My husband was in the airforce and loved Bulgogi when he was stationed in Korea.  He was so happy to find this recipe. We make it at least once a month, sometimes more.

I've always prepared beef steaks in a korean fashion (grilled, wrapped in lettuce with garlic and pepper paste) but I tried this recipe to surprise my boyfriend. We loved it. It is the best bulgogi we've ever tasted. Will definitely cook this again.

My tip: Blend soy sauce, sugar, garlic, green oinon, carrot, ground black pepper, and pear (or apple) for marination. Then add more green onion, carrot, sesame seeds, sesame oil and pear to the blended sauce + beef.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I worked in a Korean restaurant in college and have been searching high and low for a Bulgogi recipe to meet my standards. This recipe is above and beyond my standards. Love love LOVE it!

Delicious!!!  I served it as lettuce wraps (with iceberg lettuce) and mixed chili sauce with a few dashes of hot sauce as a condiment.  Great with a side of brown rice!  Low calorie heaven!!

Wow this is so good!  The key is to thinly slice the meat against the grain so its tender after being cooked.

Exceptional!  I used moose tenderloin instead of flank steak, this was my favorite marinade ever!  I cut the pieces of tenderloin up into stew ~1" x 1 1/2" chunks about 1/2" thick, pan seared it and served it over basmati rice. YUM!

Great Recipe!  Followed exactly the first time I made it and was a little too much garlic so only used 1 tablespoon.  Tried with chicken (cut into small pieces) and the flavor was delicious.

Really good and simple!  While I was stationed in Korea, my Korean soldier taught me how to make bulgogi like his mother and the only difference from this recipe is adding Coke instead of sugar, adding chili powder and julienne carrots and onions slices in addition to the green onion. Making it again tonight!

Amazing dish nice sensational Koren flavor with the sesame seeds and sugar to give it a nice sweet and savory beef flavor. I used vegetable oil instead of sesame because I am poor lol, But the dish still came out amazing.

We loved this recipe! I used petite sirloin steaks sliced very thin because that is what I had on hand. I sliced the meat before I marinated it. Also, I did not have green onions so I used about 3 tbl of dehydrated onions. Served with white rice and a quick vegetable stir fry: broccoli, onions and red peppers with a little veggie oil, a little sesame oil and a little soy sauce. Yum!

Made this minus the green oinion,  Our market did not have any.  I put cut up sweet onion in the marinade.  This recipe is a keeper.  I can't wait to have it again with green onions.

Awesome! Made it just as written and served them in a lettuce wrap with asian style slaw on top. I did use a sirloin steak, cut it into strips and marinated for about 2 hours. I also boiled the marinade and used it to drizzle over the meat once it was done. Can't wait to eat this again!

this is a great recipe! the meat comes out so tasty! I would suggest to not marinate overnight, but no more than a few hours. The soy sauce becomes overpowering, and the overall flavor quite salty. I marinate the meat for no longer than 3 or 4 hours. 

I made this with the 'house fried rice' recipe from user LMFB64 on this site, and just layed the cooked meat with spooned sauce over top.. really tasty!
I used a sirloin tip roast. I have a butcher friend and he shaved it paper thin for me. will make again, recipe is a definite keeper!

Wow! I cannot believe how awesome this is! So simple, fast and tasty! 
Used Rib eye steak as that was all I had, and also used red onion instead of green onion.
Cooked on stove in a hot cast iron pan, on high for a few minutes. YUM!

This was awesome and easy!! I am a disaster in the kitchen and was able to pull this one off without incident.  My bf said it was delicious and my daughter was surprised I didn't cook out of a box.  I followed the advice of others and substituted brown sugar instead of white. I marinated the meat over night. I did not cook it on the grill because I do not own a grill and do not know how to use one.  I cooked it in a pan on the stove and served it over rice with broccoli.  Absolutely amazing even for an incompetent cook.

I registered so I could rate this- it's so good! I took the suggestion from some of the other reviewers and subbed brown sugar for white, marinated it for two hours and wrapped it in red leaf lettuce with a little chili paste. It was delicious and so easy to make!

Incredible.  Now my family's favorite meal...and we're about as far from Korean as you can get (Iowans).  I had spent a summer in S. Korea back in 1995 and loved the beef bulgogi at restaurants.  I don't know what took me so long to look up the recipe!  I recently got a food processor and the slice attachment perfectly sliced my semi-frozen meat (I used some t-bones from the freezer -- sliced sans the bone/fat of course).  This food processor took the work out of making the dish!  If you have a bunch of steaks in your freezer -- because your parents raise beef cattle like me -- it's a delicious way to free up some space!

WOW!  This is delicious.  My husband loves Beef Bulgogi.  I would say this is as good as a restaurant. Even my VERY, VERY picky 6 year old ate it and liked it.  I froze the meat slightly and then cut it very thin.  Marinated it after sliced then seared it in a skillet.  Delicious! Served with Asian Cucumber Salad. Thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome, I could not get the lettuce to wrap very well as suggested by some, so it became a salad.  VERY GOOD!

My family loved it, especially my husband and that was my first time making a Korean dish. I had a neighbor cook up some rice in her rice cooker to go with it. Very good and we can't wait to make it again. It's now a favorite!

Wow, it was some good stuff.   Had 2lbs so i doubled the recipe. Cut some of the meat as thinly sliced steak and some as big steak pieces with criss-cross knife cuts on it.  Will be making this again

Used the marinade with a roast rather than thinly sliced beef (ate this dish in Okinawa a few times). Replaced the Sesame Seeds with Sunflower seeds and the green onion with a vidalia onion minced. The roast was tender and received positive comments from the family without prompting which is always a good sign.

Wonderful!! My entire family LOVED it (even the picky little ones). I made it JUST like the recipe EXCEPT: I tenderized the meat and sliced it in thin strips and THEN marinated it for about an hour. I stir-fried it in a very hot wok. We ate it with steamed white rice and steamed veggies. This is the ONLY recipe I've tried on here (so far) that I guarantee will be requested again and again. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious!  There is no other words to describe this recipe.  I didn't think something so simple would taste so amazing.  The blend of flavors are absolutely perfect.  I only let my steak marinate for about 3 hours and the flavors came through just fine.  I may try to marinate it longer next time and see if that makes it even better.  This will be a definite keeper in my house.  Thanks for one of my new favorite recipes!

I have to review this. This was soooo good! :) I really, really loved it. I froze the steak for a few hours so I can slice it easier (don't freeze it for too long or you won't be able to slice it at all!). After that I mixed all ingredients and marinated it overnight. I think it's important you marinate it for 6 hours or more - since in mine the flavor was so amazing! I told my hubby this definitely goes into our 'repeat' pile. :) When I grilled it I was basting them with the sauce also. Afterwards I had some Romaine Lettuce in the fridge and we just pulled some leaves and wrapped the beef and ate it like that. Again, really good and light. Thumbs up!

I have made this a few times now and love it. I have made it exactly as the recipe calls. I have also cooked meat and removed from heat then cooked thinly sliced fresh carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts, and a variety of green, red, yellow peppers till desired tenderness. Then add meat back to veggie mixture.  I do suggest if needing sauce for rice or anything else do atleast 8 servings without the meat. This is a keeper..

Yummy! I used more than 2lbs of beef (Top Surloin) but did not double the ingredients. It turned out perfect. I used pinapple juice insead. Tates just like in the resturant. Great Stuff!

TOO SALTY!!  I used reduced sodium organic tamari soy sauce. I may try it again, with less soy or substitute liquid aminos instead. Definitely needs the hot pepper, which should be listed in the ACTUAL RECIPE and not merely mentioned in the descriptive blurb.  The meat was tender  which is why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1.

So amazing. Took the advice of other users and used brown sugar. Definitely the right way to go! I also added about a teaspoon of ginger to the marinade that I really enjoyed.

Simple, fast, delicious over plain white rice, with kimchi on the side.  I make it often.  If it's too salty (if your soy sauce is very salty in flavor), cut the sauce with 1-2Tbs H2O.

I will absolutely make it again.  I've seen that some people made this in a skillet instead of a grill.  The grill is a key component when making this dish, it gives the meat the char that is needed and dries it a bit so it doesn't end up pooling in a bunch of sauce at the bottom of the pan. Do serve it over white rice, and if you want to save some of the sauce to pour over afterwards, please do.

When my husband who was stationed in SK ages ago said, "just like mamasan used to make it," I knew I'd hit the nail on the head! I used brown instead of white sugar and cooked it on the stovetop on high heat rather than the grill. which left us with a good amount of sauce to soak into the rice... yum!  I was able to slice it very thinly after freezing the flank steak for about two hours, and since I only had about an hour to marinate it I added about half a minced pear. I served it with brown and wild rice and garnished with fresh green onions which brightened the flavor and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.  Hubby added Sriracha sauce as it was his go-to while stationed overseas (and ever after).  I have said it before, but it bears repeating: do NOT substitute anything else for the sesame oil as it has a very smoky unique flavor that cannot be replicated with any other option.  Massive win!!  Adding this quick and easy recipe to the regular rotation, much to his delight.

Wonderful! I usually add 2 tablespoons of Gochujang paste and although not how Bulgogi usually is made, tastes delicious to me - very mild spice. I don't grill this, instead I will use a wok that has been softening onions. Served on rice.

Sooo good! I was actually trying to find a recipe to use 1lb of ground chuck and I stumbled across this one. I actually found that it still worked quite well. I added about 1.5-2x more of each ingredient and I added stir fry vegetables so it turned into something like a beef bulgogi stir fry. I cooked this over the stove and let everything simmer for about 20 minutes. I also had fried rice on the side and used the sauce from this dish instead of soy sauce on the rice. Turned out great!

As it's been 90+ here in No CA, I was looking for something simple that I could throw on the grill and this recipe fit my criteria = easy to pull together the evening before, let marinade overnight, and ready for the bbq the next evening.  Very good, but I was somewhat disappointed as I was expecting more flavor as other Bulgogi recipes offer.  I did take my usual approach to this recipe and replace the white sugar with brown and added minced pear to help tenderize the meat but otherwise prepared as the recipe directed.  My taste buds must have been a little off tonight as the hubster and son gave it thumbs up.  Served with Cucumber Salad with Thai Sweet Chili  Vinaigrette for the perfect side.

Wow!  Really fantastic dish!  I've never even heard of Bulgogi.  I just found it because I was looking to use a flank steak that I had in freezer for too long.   I followed instructions except that I used brown sugar instead of white.  Marinated 24 hours & really loved it.  Thanks for the new addition to our menu!

This was amazing. Husband said make that anytime. Didn't grill just stir fried in hot pan. Used honey instead of sugar. Delicious. Will try with chicken next time.

Hells, yeah! This was deeeelicious! Use the brown sugar like suggested in the other reviews. Made this for my buddy and his wife last night. He was stationed in Korea and said it was spot on.

Next time I will use all brown sugar instead. There's something about soy sauce, sesame oil, and brown sugar all together. Magic!

great recipe, I just got back from Seoul Korea and was craving this dish.  If you are grilling the thicker meat is good..I preferred the thinner sautéed method, if doing this, cut the meat quite thin so is doesn't get too tough. I added 1/2-1/2 white and brown sugar to more closely match the flavour I had in the east. I served it with a short grain sticky rice (easier to pick up with chopsticks) and of course..you cannot have bulgogi with out a side of spicy Kimchi!!

We made this for the first time earlier this week & let it marinate overnight. I did use brown sugar instead of white sugar, because I had more brown sugar on hand.  I quadrupled the recipe (we were feeding 3 growing, teenage football players), so we cooked it inside, in batches, in our largest cast iron skillet because that was easier than trying to cook that much thinly sliced meat on the grill.  The flavor was great!  All the boys went back for heaping second helpings (& one of the boys doesn't really like red meat - and he was the first to get seconds).  We served it with white rice and sautéed fresh green beans.  For the green beans I steamed them a bit in the microwave while cooking the beef, and I finished them in the same pan the meat had cooked in, and added a little of the pan drippings to the beans, and a dash of low-sodium soy sauce.  I let them cook down some in the pan and added hot water as needed to keep the sauce from caramelizing/sticking to the pan too much.  The beans were a hit too (even with one teen who hates all green veggies!).   Both my husband and son asked that this be put in the rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So good!!! I added about a tsp of ginger and a splash of lime juice to the marinade, and used brown sugar instead of white. Marinated about 10 hours and cooked on the stovetop, but I bet it is even better grilled. Thumbs up from both me and the fiancé! Definitely going into our meal rotation.

Very good recipe - although I wasn't paying attention and marinated it whole and grilled it that way (seems MUCH easier, although I'm sure the flavor is even better with a greater surface area.)  I doubled the marinade and cooked the remainder to serve drizzled over the meat and rice.  It was SUCH a hit in our house that people started asking for it again less than a week later.  Great recipe!

This recipe was simple and fantastic! First thing I did was half-freeze or partial-freeze my flank steak so that it was firm but not frozen solid. That makes it super easy to slice thinly and I got nice thin slices. I marinated overnight (honestly it was 24 hours, because I prepped it the night before, but couldn't cook it until dinner the next night, you know?). I did not cook it on a grill, I used a nonstick pan on med-high heat stirring often. Then my 4-year-old and I ate them in "lettuce cups" using big pieces of butter lettuce, and they were so amazingly delicious. I can imagine, though, you could add rice noodles, sliced green onions, siracha, or any other elements to make it a little fancier. But this food is fine on it's own. 
This recipe is perfect!

I used 1.5 lbs of meat for this recipe but kept the ingredient amounts the same for everything else. I didn't have a grill so I just made it on the stovetop. It was way too salty. Next time I will reduce the soy sauce, maybe to 3tbsp or so.

Excellent recipe as is!  Five stars as is.  

The second time I made it I substituted brown sugar for white and liked it even better.  I also used olive oil instead of sesame oil and didn't notice the difference.  I also used the entire bunch of green onion and about 3-4 times more garlic and that also helped kicked it up.  I let it marinade for two days with all of that, and it still wasn't too much flavor.  

Searing it in a skillet puts off some serious smoke, so use the (outside) eye on the grill if you have one.  Next time I plan to use the actual grill, with one of those grill pans with small holes, to keep the meat from falling down into the fire.  

PAIRING:  Goes very well over sticky white rice with sides of steamed broccoli and/or fresh green beans sautéed in garlic.

Ended up using skirt steak. We did the traditional lettuce wrap with rice.  We also had hot paste and soy sauce for people to add if they wanted.  Turned out wonderful. My adult son said, "I could eat this all day!"

Cooked indoors because I didn't feel like grilling. I did cook these until juices evaporated and sugar caramelized. Served with Korean Egg Roll Triangles, Korean Soba Salad (Jaengban Gooksu without the dressing or soba) but using Korean Style Salad Dressing, Pickled Daikon Radish and Carrot, Homemade Kimchi, and fixings (lettuce and rice for the wraps, sugar snap peas, sugar snap pea micro-greens, sprouts: mung beans, alfalfa, 3 part and 5 part salad mix, broccoli, and green lentils.) My daughter was amazed by the wraps and said, "It was an explosion of flavor!" Served buffet style on the table like in Korea.

Great Marinade. I did take the suggestion of others and used brown sugar instead of white. I also seasoned the beef with a bit of season salt, a tbspn of red wine vinegar, and teriyaki sauce. This is good stuff. A definite keeper. It also taste good sauteing in the pan and serving with sticky rice.

My family loved it. I didn't have pear juice but I did have a large navel orange. I juiced that into the marinade and it turned out fine. Substituted sugar with honey like someone else suggested and it helped it glaze up nice on the bbq. I am making it again this weekend but I'm going to double the meat and triple the marinade for a nice noodle sauce.

I have made bulgogi for years,this is really close to the recipe I use but with having diabetics in the family I have cut down on the sugar and use pear extract or juice instead also I use a london broil partially frozen for easier slicing and we do in hot skillet so we get some of the juices remaining to put over rice.

I love this recipe and so does my boyfriend! I did make some changes based off of other suggestions and my own experience, material on hand etc. I used brown sugar instead of white. I did not have green onion so I used spring onion. I also added rice wine vinegar and I had no sesame seeds. I like more garlic, so I also added another clove. At my local grocery store they sell shaved beef, so that made it a lot easier to put together. Awesome! Will definitely make again!

I tried this recipe for dinner tonight. I left it overnight to marinade. I followed the recipe to prepare, but added much more onion and bell pepper while cooking. I also added much more sesame oil and soy sauce towards the end. I sautéed the onions, garlic and bell pepper before adding the meat, then added more before it was fully cooked. My family loved it. They thought I ordered in from a restaurant. I served it with white rice. Thank you for the new addition to my recipe list.

Excellent recipe! I followed this recipe very closely except I subbed top sirloin steak for the flank steak. I try to refrain from using refined sugar so I subbed a 1/2 cup of natural pear juice in place of the sugar. Natural pear juice has a neutral flavor and isn’t as sweet as using honey as a substitute for sugar. Outside of this recipe; I sautéed some carrot sticks, freshly grated ginger, sliced mushrooms and sliced onions to add with the bulgogi in red leaf lettuce wraps. The sautéed veggies subbed for kimchee that is traditionally used. I added some water to the reserved marinade, boiled it in a small pot for a minute or so and poured it over steamed rice. I also made a marinated cucumber salad as a side dish. My entire family loved this meal.

Love this marinade. I cook this in the crock pot and pour the meat and sauce over a bed of white rice. It is delicious! The only thing different I do is add a tablespoon of sambal for a spicy kick.

It is one of the closest recipes to actual Korean bulgogi I have tried. A tip...cut the soy sauce in half and match it with water, add 3/4 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. It will taste great. Trust me;)

I gave this five stars because I have nothing to compare it to, but it sure was delicious. I made it just as is with the exception of using tri tip since that is what I had in the deep freeze. I cut the meat when it was semi frozen to get it nice and thin and marinated overnight. To serve I used big lettuce and store bought Korean chili sauce.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white and it turned out amazing. I also added very thinly sliced vidalia onion to the marinade. I cooked it in a very hot skillet. I'm sure it would have tasted amazing grilled, but even cooked on the stove top it was excellent. I love this recipe and will definitely be trying it again!

This recipe was great! Even my 5 year old daughter who is very picky kept going back for more. I did use brown sugar instead of white. This will definitely be a regular at our house. The marinade is so simple and quick to throw together. I cut up a roast (which was on sale) and put it in the marinade the night before.

My family thought it was great! This includes my mother who never tries anything new (I didn't tell her the name of it until after she ate it) and my very opinionated husband. I made a few modifications as other reviewers suggested. I used brown sugar instead of white, added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, a teaspoon of ginger, and used regular onion instead of green onion (because I did not have any. I doubled the marinade, adding more water and brown sugar to it, and boiled the leftover marinade on the stove and used it to glaze my meat. Finally, I broiled it for four min. on each side and then covered the meat with the marinade that I boiled and let it sit for a few minutes. Very delicious!!!

This is really good! I've made it with flank steak and chicken and both are great. I leave the sesame seeds out since my husband doesn't like it and I add red hot chilli flakes to spice it up. I have added grated ginger to the chicken and its a nice addition. I serve this over sticky rice, which is just sweet rice cooked in my rice cooker. Soo good! I actually think this recipe tastes better with the sticky rice.

I thought this was pretty good.  The kids loved it!  I didn't have any sesame oil but I'm sure it would have made it even better.  I cooked it on the stove and served it with white rice and steamed veggies.

Delicious marinade! Ended up adding a dash of red chili pepper flakes and cooked it in a pan for maybe 30-45 seconds each side. Great recipe for using flank steak

3 out of 4 enjoyed this. I didn't have all the ingredients, but I will say this is a great base that you can add flavor to suit your tastes. I do recommend to freeze the meat, then cut it up. I did and it made it easy. It marinated for a few hours. I do not have a grill but I was able to quickly stir fry it. Next time I will stir fry some onions and peppers with it.

Absolutely perfect! If you don't have green onions, 1 teaspoon onion powder will do fine.  I also almost never have sesame seeds on hand and we don't miss them.  Everybody in my family LOVES this!

Wonderful! Easy and delicious. I mixed the marinade ingredients in a ziplock plastic bag and thinly sliced the steak before putting it in with the marinade. I did use brown sugar instead of white sugar. I didn't completely mince the garlic, and it still turned out great (basically just chopped it). We stir-fried the bulgogi instead of using our grill, then we served it with stir-fry veggies and rice. Wonderful dish.

Used brown sugar.  Fried high heat in a cast iron pan with canola oil.  Babied it, stired and watched constantly but awesome!!!! Cut thin (approx 1/8" or slightly more).  Cook fast and high heat. Approx 5 minutes total.

Thank you!  Thank you for posting this recipe!  I was looking for an recipe for chuck bones steaks other an standard pot roast and this came out AWESOME!!!

My (usually picky) 3 and 6 year old and hubby all loved it.  In fact, hubby said we should have doubled the recipe.

We thinly sliced 1 partially defrosted boneless chuck steak and substituted 1/4 of a thinly sliced sweet yellow onion and left out sesame seed because we didn't have scallions or sesame seeds.  Served with lettuce leaves, rice and kimchi.

Grilling was hard because the meat was so small so we sprayed foil and poked some holes in the foil so the meat wouldn't steam too much.  

There was none left!!!

Thank you thank you!  Will definitely make this again!!!

An Amarone was a perfect match for this amazing dish.  My guests raved about this meal.

The dish did not turn out as I had expected, probably because I used a pan and the juices came out.  I didn't get the charred flavor.  Taste was okay though.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly. The only change I made was using tenderloin chain meat left over from trimming a large tenderloin. I marinated it overnight and seared it in a hot pan on the stove top. It was delicious!!

The kids loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly but did as another reviewer suggested and used the rest of the marinade to make a sauce by thickening with cornstarch.  I then added mushrooms, sugar snap peas, bean sprouts, and soba noodles.  Delicious!

I don't know if it's fair to give this 5 stars because I left the sugar & sesame seeds out completely, but it was a total hit with everyone! Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic and definitely worth 5+ stars.  I actually had 2 pounds of flank steak so i just doubled the recipe.  I also did what other reviewers did and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and actually added a tablespoon or two more because i liked it a bit sweeter.  I also added some red pepper flakes for heat.  I served this over rice.  DELISH!

I lived in South Korea for 4 years & this tastes just like the Bulgogi I used to order from my favorite restaurant there!  I followed this recipe and also added shredded carrots at the end.  Fantastic! I will definitely be making this again and again!  Thank you!

VERY tasty dish!  I ended up cooking this in a skillet because I didn't feel like dealing with a dirty grill!  Still turned out delicious!  Served with brown rice and thai chili garlic paste (well...hubby did...I thought it was great all by itself).  This one's a keeper!  THANKS!

So easy and delicious! This recipe was great for the beef.  Took it to the west with Bulgogi sandwiched on a soft toasted baguette with cilantro/garlic/lemon aioli, lettuce and roasted red pepper.  Fed 35 people at a work event and they are still talking about it!

delicious flavoring, though the meat was a little less tender than i'd hoped. my korean mom uses the same ingredients for flavor, but i believe she uses ribeye instead of flank steak.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was a big hit.  Tons of flavor.  We did roll it up in red leaf lettuce and rice... but was out of red pepper past and didnt know it.  Ill remember for next time- my husband said he could have eaten twice as much because it was sooo good.   Now a permanent item in our menu...

I have not tried this recipe but my korean mom makes it with the same ingredients.  Freezing the meat with the ingredients does very well.  My mom makes a huge batch and freezes most of it.  When it is time to cook it, she just lets it defrost.  Bulgogi goes really well with jap chae (or however you want to spell it)!! Thanks for sharing this recipe with everyone!!

LOVED IT!!!  marinated it overnight then stir fried it with the marinade for a few mins on the stovetop then popped under the broiler to crisp it up.  then i thickened up the marinade to make a sauce.  served this with the sauce over Carrot Rice from this site.

OK, SO listen, I have been using this recipe for YEARS. I know you see tons of recipes that praise something and it ends up being awful. I am telling you I make this at least once a month for 5 or so years now. It's that good. The only thing I would mention is to take meat off grill before you think it's done because it will continue to cook after you remove from grill and it comes out even juicier. OMG i love this recipe.

I love the way this came out. The first time I made this I used skirt steak and it was a bit tough but this time around I used beef round thin. Fried it up and it was wonderful! I also doubled the marinade and had it sit in its yummy goodness for close to 7 hours.

Tender and flavorful.  Great recipe.  No changes but I did let it marinate for 48 hours before broiling for about 5 minutes. Served with white rice and baby bok choy.

I never rate recipes and rarely repeat them often, but this one is so good it's in the weekly rotation and the entire family loves it. Instead of soy, we use coconut aminos and honey instead of sugar. This is also amazing on salmon.

One of my favorite dishes my mom made growing up. She uses ground chuck roast, thinly sliced, marinade using the brown sugar, refrigerate for a couple of days, then slow cook.

Run the meat through a food processor using the slicing blade. Experiment once to try if you’re unsure. It slices it super fine. But once you grill it it comes out soft as butter. Saves so much time in slicing super thin. I can do four steaks in two minutes. It does resemble ground beef but once you cook it you’ll see it cooks up in super small strips. This method allows it to absorb the marinade really well.  Great marinade.

Really good. We had the ground beef bulgogi bowls from Hello Fresh and decided to try to make our own... this is spot on. I left out the scallions because I sautéd some into the meat. DELICIOUS!

I used brown sugar, as I saw that several people recommended that, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Had to cook on stove top as it was pouring out and our grill is exposed to the outdoors with no cover.  Flavor was good, not great, and it may have been the meat cut, but was a little tough.  My husband loved it.  I am not a beef person, so maybe that is why I wasn't as taken with it, so based on my husband's reaction, I give it a four.

Simple and delicious, this is the 2nd time I've made beef bulgogi using this recipe. I marinated the flank beef for a little over 36 hours unintentionally, but the meat came out perfectly tender and flavorful after 1.5 minutes per side over high heat charcoals. I serve the beef with rice in lettuce wraps.

I had not ever had bulgogi but my son loves it.  So, I decided to try out the recipe.  I followed it exactly the first time with the exception of using brown sugar over regular sugar as many suggested and he thought it was great, except he would have liked a little more sauce.  So this time, I doubled the marinade.  After removing the meat from the marinade, I boiled it up and let it thicken a bit so that he could pour a little over his rice.  AMAZING!!!!

I've been making this for years now, my family loves this!  I have a grill pan that I use on the stovetop when the weather isn't good for grilling outside and either way it turns out great. Freeze for about 30 min before slicing and double the sauce. Serve with steamed rice, green lettuce and julienned carrots, cucumbers and bell pepper to create lettuce wraps. Or just eat on its own!

I added a tablespoon of chopped ginger, and it improved the flavor a lot. If you love ginger like I do, you will be happy you made this addition. I also used a teaspoon of red pepper flakes,which gives it just a touch of heat.

The best bulgogi sauce! Seriously, perfect flavor! 

Changes I made:
I doubled the sauce recipe cause I like mine extra saucy for my rice. Even added some chili pepper for spice. And I use ground beef to make it super easy to make.

Good recipe. I followed the recipe and let it sit overnight. The soy / salty was a bit too strong for me, but husband thought it perfect. Added over rice but because the intent is to serve as a  lettuce wrap, I might try in a salad too. Next time, less soy sauce for me.

My only complaint is that this recipe works best with some sliced onions.  1/2 to 1/4 of an entire onion sliced into strips works great, especially if you marinate those onions with the beef overnight.

A little water added to dilute the saltiness of the soy sauce works too.

That all said, this is the easiest bulgogi recipe I've come across that still tastes authentic despite only using a few ingredients many people would actually have on hand.

Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed this dish! It’s super nice and easy on a day that I work till late because when peeped the night before you just toss it in a skillet the next day without having to prep a lot.  My boyfriend is a picky eater and he just requested this meal for dinner next week. Highly recommend!

So far made twice.  Awesome!  The first time, the beef was extremely tender, melt in your mouth.  The second time, the beef was tough although I marinated both times for 24 hours.  Next time I think I'll marinate an additional day.

Excellent, I also made it with thinly sliced rib eye steak which my family preferred over the flank steak. Both are excellent.

I’m a big fan of Korean and Japanese food. This was a great recipe and I only added one kiwi into the mix and used my hand blender to liquify it. I then marinated my thinly sliced beef for one hour and cooked in the cast iron skillet. Added some oyster mushrooms and a tad of red wine during the last phase and topped it with fresh scallions, roasted sesame seed and half of the thinly sliced jalapeños before serving. I served it with side of miso soup, white rice, quinoa, kimchi and fresh carrot salad. We ate so much yet it’s digesting nicely. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! So much better to cook it yourself instead of eating out at restaurants.

I had cube steak on hand so I used that.  Also I browned the steaks in an iron skillet in some oil then poured the marinade over the steaks and put into a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.  It was fantastic! Oh I also added some crushed red pepper to the mix like one of the other reviewers suggested.

We thought this was just ok.  I actually felt like it was way too much garlic to an extremely overwhelming degree.  I tried making this as a marinade, then making another batch for sauce to pour over top of the beef + rice.  It was just too much.  Next time I'd use this as just a marinade.  Good as a marinade, just ok as an all-over sauce.

We loved it.  I used a suggestion from another recipe and added a whole Anjou pear in the food processor for the marinade to tenderize our London Broil.  Also added shittake mushroom to the recipe.  Grilled the meat on the Kamado grill.  Turned out  great!

The Beef I have is paper thin. Given to me by a Korean friend. I don't think it would cook and look like the recipe above.
I flash it in a skillet and eat it. Almost seems a waste to eat it that way.

Very tasty recipe. This is one of my daughter’s favorite dishes. Have grilled and pan cooked this recipe and it is delicious both ways. When I pan cook it, I add the marinade to the pan when the meat is almost cooked. Then let it thicken.

I followed the directions except for a couple points...I used shaved ribeye, which was delicious, and I doubled the marinade, reserving half for the vegetables. It was quick, easy and tasted delicious. My family raves about it. Crowd pleaser. It does seem a tad high in sodium though ??.

I will have to make this again as I had 1.5x the amount of steak but accidentally doubled a few of the other ingredients.

Overall, this was pretty good, although I do think the flavours could have been a bit stronger. Perhaps slightly more sugar too, but it's hard to say since I did mess up the ingredient porportions a bit. My Chinese students loved it.

What I like about this recipe is that it's quite easy to make, and can be prepared earlier and even frozen for a super easy dinner.

Easy, and loved it. I have made it twice, once on the grill and once under the broiler. The grill is the better option, due to the added flavor, but broiler works in a pinch.

I skipped the sesame seeds (mostly because I didn't have any on hand and was too lazy to go back to the store) and skipped grilling, choosing to instead cook it in a frying pan. It was so good that even my co-workers asked me for the recipe!

I added 1 ingredient before leaving it to marinate. I added 1 peeled and chopped Kiwifruit. My mother in law is Korean.  She makes this along with many other tasty foods.  The fist time I tried this very recipe. My meat was tough. I asked her what did I miss. She tells me it's a secret. Which would be why she wouldn't show me her recipe. So  I went looking for my own.  Since I tried to make this dish without her help . She felt I was now worthy of the secret . So by adding the secret ingredient.  This dish came out tasting even better than the first.  I would not dare say it was better than hers . But my kids and their father say it can hold its own next to hers.

I made this last night and it was perfect. It wasn't overly sweet but very tangy. My wife and I loved this. I added a little more black pepper than what was required because I like it a little spicy. Perfect recipe thank you!

My fiancé and I made this on vacation and this was so delicious! Neither of us have ever had bulgogi before so we’re not able to compare it to any others we’ve tried, but for first time eaters of bulgogi, I can now say we are bulgogi fans! We didn’t alter the recipe at all. We let the meat marinate in the fridge for a good four hours and cooked it in the same pan we let it marinate in inside the fridge so that the sauce could cook with the meat. We finished it all in one sitting and I can definitely say that this will be a recipe we make a lot in the future!

The soy sauce made the dish a little too salty for my tastes, but I liked the combinations of the other flavors. I also added red peppers and mushrooms to make it more of a stir fry style dish

Tasty and easy.  Meat was tough, but that could be due to the cut, and I cooked on the George Forman grill vs the Green Egg due to torrential rains.  We liked this, even though it was chewy.

I made 5x the recipe, and used Splenda brown sugar blend in stead of white sugar.  I used cast iron instead of the grill, then thickened up the juices in the pan with a bit of corn starch and stirred it in.  Was great. Next time, I'll add some Korean red pepper.

This recipe is great!  I made a second batch of the marinade.  Made the bulgogi then grabbed whatever veggies I had in the fridge:  green onion, celery, carrots, onions and a little broccoli.  I also found a can of water chestnuts.  So I made an extra batch of the marinade, cooked the veggies until they were a little softer, added back in the bulgogi and then the sauce and let it reduce a bit.  Served with white rice.  My Korean son-in-law loved although he said technically it was no longer bulgogi!

I made this recipe the other day it was good.  I not sure yet but something seemed missing.  I know some Koreans put Asian pear in there marinade.  Might try that next.   I lived in Korea for a year and had some great bulgogi.  We go to a Korean restaurant at least once a week.

Really good!  Kids even loved it. I followed the suggestion to substitute brown sugar. I marinated the beef for about 7 hours. I had to cook inside so I put the pan on high/sear setting and laid pieces down flat and flipped after a minute or less to keep from over-cooking. Used egg noodles because that’s what I had- butter, sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, salt, & pepper to taste on the noodles, along with sautéed broccolini.

This was excellent.  I served it over rice for my wife. She said she loved it so much she was eating it slowly because she did not want the meal to end. I doubled the recipe to cover the meat for an overnight soak. I used top sirloin instead of flank steak. I did not add any cayenne pepper but I did use fresh ground mixed pepper medley instead of straight black pepper. We don’t like our food heated up a lot, just a taste of heat is fine and the ground pepper was perfect.

Wow... flavor is fabulous! I substituted skirt steak for the flank and coconut sugar instead of white sugar. I marinated about 2 hours and cooked on a smoker for 2 minutes for really tasty perfectly done bulgogi.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!! All five of us thought it was super good, four adults and a seven year finished off a doublesd recipe! 
I used Gluten Free Tamari with half the sodium instead of regular soy sauce and stir fried the bulgogi instead of grilling. I’d hate to lose the delicious marinade and stir frying with the marinade insured tender delicious beef. I used top sirloin as flank wasn’t available. It was served with jasmine rice and fresh chopped cilantro to garnish. Can’t wait to make it again! I made an Asian cabbage salad to go with it. A great meal to prepare ahead as the cooking only takes a few minutes after marinating.

Delish!  Never tried to make Korean food, but always love it in restaurants.  Served to my hubbs with spicy cucumbers and carrots with rice.  Used the stove instead of grill.  We both loved it. Added some left over red bell pepper.  Thanks for sharing this delight!

Excellent!
Notes to self: Used brown sugar instead of white. Top sirloin for the meat. Marinated overnight. Cooked in cast-iron skillet. Served with rice, Asian salad, and go-chu-jang sauce. Very yummy.

LOVED IT!! I like mine with a little more "gravy" to add to my rice. So i added a little extra of everything. It was so good. My husband is kind of picky and he loved it too! If you let it marinate overnight it is even better!

Excellent as street tacos! Instead of cutting up we threw it on the grill.

Oh so good!  we make as is.  It is also good with chicken - in fact, most of my family prefers it.  Thank you!

This is excellent! I've made this several times - sometimes following the recipe - other times substituting filet or chicken for the flank steak. My kids love steak so I am always trying to find ways to change things up a bit! This defiantly does!

I’m half Korean and have spent a lot of time in Korea and eating Korean food in the US, I’m shocked at how authentic tasting and easy this was to make! Will definitely make again and again, can’t wait to share it with family. I added a few thinly sliced onion pieces and carrots with the marinade, let it marinade for 3 hrs and it was perfect!

I made this last night and the entire family loved it. My steak was over a pound, so I made a little extra marinade. It was super cold last night, so I skipped the grill and cooked it in two batches in a cast iron skillet and kept it warm in the oven. I added some crushed red pepper flakes to the second batch and liked it even better. The marinade was great over brown rice. Next time, I’ll probably cut the sugar a tad and make even more marinade to serve over rice. Aside from the brown rice, we had a simple salad with iceberg lettuce, carrots and Jessie’s Ginger Dressing. The next time, I might throw in some steamed broccoli. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My friend insists that bulgogi beef should have pear in it, so I substituted pear syrup for the sugar with great results. Dynamite recipe, super delicious. I tried your suggestion of lettuce wraps with sriracha mayo and it tasted awesome. I'll come back to this one again and again.

I made this for my family, and though I don't eat beef, I can say this smelled SO GOOD while marinating in the fridge. My son loved it and had three helpings! I have made bulgogi using a different recipe and cut of beef before but this was more successful.  I toasted the seeds on a dry pan before using. Thanks for an easy and foolproof recipe.

I made this I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar. I like spice so I added a couple tablespoons of of hot sauce. I make double the marinade and marinade it over night. Instead of using flank steak I use a ribeye sliced thin. The better the quality of meat the more tender the bulgogi. My family loves this served over rice. This is defiantly a new favorite

I added some diced onions as the last of the beef was frying and tossed it into the family-style serving bowl. I brown sugar and the partially-frozen flank steak in the food processor tricks that people recommended. This was awesome. The only problem was that there was no dinner time conversation until people had finished slurping it down! ;)

This was amazing! I made no changes to the recipe and it was perfect. I let it marinate for about 6 hours which seemed about right. Fir those people having problems with your meat sticking to the grill: make sure your grill is really hot and don’t try to turn too early.

Swapped the white sugar with brown sugar, used sliced Kobe beef, added onions and red bell peppers, and cooked it on a cast iron skillet instead of the grill (it's winter in Wisconsin) - me and my friends loved it! I don't cook a lot and this was my first time doing both a marinade and beef dish, but my friends couldn't stop raving about it. It's very, very flavorful and can be eaten all on its own without any rice (I actually think the rice dilutes the flavor).

I was able to make this without a grill. I mixed everytthing, let it marinade for 30 minutes, then cooked in pot with little water for about 15 minutes. Great when you don't have a grill.

Very good quick and easy meal. Didn't slice before marinating and it was fine. Boiled the marinade and added to the noodles and it really was delicious. Wouldn't change much, but there is some possibility of personalizing (add ginger, garlic, etc.)

I admit that I tweak it a little most times I make it; a little worcestershire sauce, some peanut oil, some cilantro, etc. Always good.

Followed marinade ingredients to a tee and it turned out fantastic —- as a marinade on thinly sliced rib eye meat and some ground beef, which were all I had available at the moment

Soooo good. The only changes I made was, used half the sesame oil it called for and cooked on the stove top instead of the grill. Absolutely delicious! Served with white rice and red leaf lettuce leaves. Definitely will be making this over and over again. I've tried bulgogi in authentic akorean restaurants and this is by far my favorite.

forgot to marinade ahead of time so used the marinade as more of a stir fry sauce and cooked it in the wok.  It was fabulous and I am looking forward to trying it again the way the recipe was meant to be.

The kids weren't hungry when I made this, so I told them, "Just try it; it tastes like tender beef jerky." I shouldn't have said that. I made three pounds, and there were no leftovers.  I reduced the sugar by half, to make it a little more low-carb/keto friendly, and the flavor did not suffer.

I made a few changes--I subbed venison tenderloin for the flank steak since it's what we had on hand. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and added a tablespoon of garlic chili paste to add a little heat to the marinade. We don't have an outdoor grill, so I cooked it inside on an electric grill set to 400 for a couple minutes on each side and was still able to get a good sear. It was delicious, served with brown rice and stir fried vegetables

Delish marinade!! I used brown sugar instead of white and I used Korean thick cut ribs instead of flank. The result was amazing and so easy to make. I will never buy pre-made marinade again.

Made per recipe only switching out brown sugar for the white.  Also sliced the flank steak thin with food processor slicing blade with partially frozen meat. Marinated all day.  This recipe is delicious!  Served in red lettuce leaves with brown rice.  Will definitely be making again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

Great Recipe! The only suggestion I would make for people who don’t like it as sweet, cut the sugar down to 1.5 Tbsp. I also used brown sugar instead of white.

I made this for the first time today. I'm in a hotel that has a kitchenette, but nothing to measure with. I had to eyeball everything. I was a little off with a few things, but it turned out great.  I'll be making this again when I get home.

Loved this recipe. I did make a change though. I didn't have a roast, but had chunks of  stewing beef. I cooked it in the oven for 2 hours instead of slow cooker. The flavour was great! Husband chose to have his over rice, but sons and I had tacos. We used  a bag of Asian salad mix to add to the tacos.  Will be making this again!!

Great flavor! I prepared differently- put everything in the crockpot for 10 hours. I added 2c water to dilute the soy an doubled the garlic, as suggested. Beef fell apart it was super tender. Served with rice.

I did substitute brown sugar, and had to stir fry, for lack of my GrillMaster. We placed a bit of rice and meat on the lettuce leaves and the taste was so refreshing! We are eager to make again! Thank you for a great recipe!

Turned out delicious. I substituted light brown sugar (not packed) for the white sugar. I cooked in a skillet with olive oil and discarded the marinade. Served the meat on a. Irritated with steamed rice and corn salsa. Very good!

Came out phenomenal. The only change I made was to use erythritol as a sweetener (I'm on a low-carb diet) and used rib-eye as the cut of meat. Ask the butcher to slice it as thin as possible, almost like philly cheesesteak style. My butcher sliced at a 2, whatever that means. Made for probably the best bulgogi I've ever eaten; and I have eaten quite a lot. Top with kimchi and wrap it all up in lettuce and you'll have yourself a good time.

YUMMM!! I feel there is something missing from this to make it authentic bulgogi, no idea what it is, BUT this does still taste extremely delicious as is. I served this recipe as-is over rice. My husband and I inhaled it.

I add red pepper flakes to give it a little 'zip'.  I'll also add sliced mushrooms, regular onions, and peppers to give it a little change up.  All delicious.

My wife and I are hooked on beef bulgogi. Our favorite Korean Restaurant is a 30 minute drive away from where we live now. I made this recipe and it tastes almost identical to our favorite restaurant's bulgogi. I have made it several times and have even added my own small twists.

Same recipe works great for a marinade for korean style bbq ribs as well (beef or pork)

We've made this many times and is a go to recipe for Asian style beef. If the weather isn't great this still comes out great in a skillet. We usually make this into lettuce wraps as well.

Great recipe. Served it over a bed of rice and with a scallops cocktail as a side and a nice merlot. I am excited to use this recipe and add sone veggies to make more of a stir fry. I did not feel like dealing with the grill so I used our Wok and it worked perfectly took a little longer to cook but turned out amazing.

Fantastic flavor.  I have made this recipe for years, and have altered it a bit (not much though, it's already a good thing):
- marinating for just a couple hours will be fine, the thin cut meat doesn't need long 
- made extra sauce for spooning over rice
- toasted sesame oil adds a dimension over regular sesame oil; it's more expensive though so I mix both 
- use white and brown sugar; white makes it sweeter, it seems
- don't go overboard on the sesame seeds. I toasted them and it was excellent 
- experimenting with all kinds of lettuce (red leaf, green leaf, butter lettuce, romaine). It's hard to find enough leaves that won't rip while you eat it (like a taco).  It gets messy quick eating this way with leaves ripping.
- Add sliced garlic cloves to the wrap, it's a zinger!

I made it with low sodium soy sauce and marinated it for at first  about 6 hours, then also made some the following day and 3 days later. It tastes good even marinated 78 hours. I used trimmed tritip and it worked fine as well.
My 2 year old loved it

I like a little less sweet taste so I reduced the amount of sugar by about 1/2 Tablespoon and added a little more soy sauce and sesame oil.  I also swapped in usukuchi (light color) soy sauce since is a bit less salty tasting.

Great recipe.  Recently I made a variation: sliced chuck roast, tough cut, I know. After marinating overnight, I put meat and marinade in my pressure cooker for 30 minutes on high pressure. (mine is electric) added some carrots too along with some corn starch slurry.  The best stew EVER!

Easy and delicious - my 10 year old son and friend gave it two thumbs up! You can also use this marinade in ground sirloin if you don't have flank steak. I added onions, broccoli and asparagus too.

The marinade is great.  Flank steak or similar not so much- way too tough.  I will use a better cut of meat next time- fillets.

So glad to see this recipe w/o fruit  in it.  My mom made it w/o fruit but she did add chili powder and sliced onions to her recipe, i personally use red onions.  This is a more old school Korean sauce recipe, the modern sauce recipe adds Asian pear or Kiwi fruits, so when Korean people tell you I'm from Korea so I know better, keep in mind the fruit was used because beef is expensive so it was used to tenderize the meat, which is not needed for beef people use in USA.

I used chicken because that's what I had, and I didn't grill it because it's 40°F outside... otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and pan fried it. The (chicken) bulgolgi was fantastic and I look forward to grilling up a beef variety when the weather warms up!

This recipe is great! I used thin cut top sirloin and it was still fine. I only marinated it for an hour it and tasted as good as any bulgogi I have ever had!

I added carrots and celery to give it a little crunch and my teenage kids loved it. I would add a little something more to give it a bit a zing next time but otherwise it was easy and delicious!

great flavor!  I found that I had about 1/2 of the green onion in the recipe - I substituted dried onion as it was for the marinade.  I used dark soy sauce as that is all I had, but I did not grill - rather cooked in a high heat wok so I think the dark soy sauce worked to my advantage.  Meat when finished was an awesome "grilled" color.  Used dark brown sugar, but any sugar helps with caramelization.  
Lastly, there was a lot of tasty bits when the meat was done so I added approx 1/4 cup of water which instantly made an awesome sauce and then threw in some fresh spinach I had to add veggies.  Wilted spinach and tossed with tongs in the sauce - took 30-45 seconds.   I think you could do this with any favorite veggie you have.  Served over Bob's Mill organic brown basmati rice.

Wow, one of the best meals I've ever made! I served it with rice, stir fry red cabbage and avocado slices. My husband actually made happy noises while eating.... yessss!! The marinade is deceptively simple, but it adds a magnificent flavor to the beef. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

Delicious! I marinated for 8-10 hours. Then I threaded onto skewers and grilled as directed. Soooo good! I also added some pear to the marinade becauase someone in the Asian market told me to. Worked for me! =)

Here are some my recommendations:
- marinate it overnight to get the best flavor
- substitute white sugar for brown sugar
-add a pinch of ginger
-when cooking it let it caramelize for a better taste
- double the recipe if you want more of the sauce because the sauce reduces while cooking

Loved this recipe. I did use brown sugar instead of white and cooked it in a large pan in the house instead of grilling. Easy to prepare and the marinade is out of this world delicious. The marinade could be used on steaks as well.

Pretty good. I didn't get to marinade it that long which may be why I'm not giving it a 5 star at this time. My son wasn't a fan, my husband used barbecue sauce on it when eating but my daughter and I ate it as is over rice. I'd make again but marinade over night next time for more flavor. Thank you for the recipe it was different than our norm :)

Very simple and easy to make.  I didn't use green onions as I had none on hand.  I cooked it in a pan with a bit of olive oil as I had sliced the beef far too thin to place on a grill.  Served on a bed of rice, and I used the left over juices/marinade from the pan as a sauce to pour over the beef and rice.  Side of carrots and bbq corn on the cob.  Delicous!

Incredible way to eat beef and grill fast!  I did not have green onion so I chopped up white onion!  a few pieces stayed on the beef and tasted great!  Much to my amazement, I used thinly sliced tri-tip that was poor quality.  I had cooked half the tri-tip before and it was horrible even though I cooked it how I normally do.  The quality was just not so great.  I froze the rest and when I came across this recipe I decided to try the rest of the tri-tip.  WOW, how could it be so good???  Love this recipe.  

My husband does not eat meat so I marinaded firm tofu in the marinade and grilled it.  He LOVED it.  We ate over rice with stir fried broccoli.  Never need to order at a Korean restaurant again!

The best & easiest Korean Bbq recipe! I recommend doubling the marinade tho! I make this with jasmine rice &  green beans. I also stir fry the green beans with the extra marinade I make. This meal disappears at dinner time with my kids & husband. On the rare occasion we have leftovers I make bbq tacos... With coleslaw, shredded carrots, cilantro & the extra marinade sauce poured on top. Yum!

Recipe was awesome. I made it for Fourth of July and everyone loved it. Marinated over night and let the grill get hot at around 400. Threw the Flank Beef on the grill until it was charred and flipped it until the other side was charred. That was it.

This was great!  Hadn't had bulgogi before, but according to my son, I'm going to need to make it every week from now on.   It actually got him to like eating lettuce for the first time in 20 years!  (We did the red leaf lettuce wrap idea.) The only thing I changed was using brown sugar as others had suggested, used flank steak and skewered the slices.  I made some garlic rice with a little cilantro in it to put in the lettuce wraps with the meat.  Next time I will add a little chili garlic sauce to the marinade to add a bit of heat - the only thing I felt was missing -- which is why the 4 instead of 5 stars.  But really this was super even without the heat.

Pretty good.  I think the marinade needed a little more umpft... maybe more soy and less sugar?  Would try it again with some tweeking.

Tasted amazing and the meat was tender even though I sliced it wrong (the right way is against the grain, not with it). Freeze the meat so you can slice no thicker than about 1/16 inch. If you like ginger, grate 3/4 Tbsp. of it into marinade. I would have loved to grill this for the char, but it also worked out great in a non-stick pan. Sear the meat on medium-high until almost brown and then finish on high to caramelize the marinade onto the meat. We ate this as a wrap in butter lettuce with Sriracha and thinly sliced English cucumber, red cabbage, carrot and Fresno pepper. Would also be great on a salad/sandwich or in a spring roll.

I stir-fried it instead of grilling and it was delicious. I served it for a small family gathering of 8 people and simply doubled everything. I also let it marinate for about 30 hours to let everything soak in. Everyone, including my exceptionally picky little sister loved it.

This was a hit at my house! I let it marinate for about 8 hours, and then I cooked it in my wok. I followed the recipe to a tee, with the exception of exchanging the white sugar for brown sugar, as another reviewer had suggested. It was perfect served over rice. Everyone went back for seconds, and my son even ate leftovers, which is quite uncharacteristic of him. I will be using this recipe again. Thanks!

As a side note: My grocery store sells "bulgolgi meat," which is already sliced very thin for this dish. I find when I purchase flank steak and try to slice it thin myself, I cannot get it as thin as bulgolgi is meant to be (ends up being tough). So if you ever see it already labeled in your meat department, this is a much better option for tender bulgolgi!

This recipe is the closest to restaurant quality beef bulgogi that you will find.  My family loved it, and I loved being able to make it for my family of four for the price of one bulgogi meal in a restaurant.  I cooked it in batches in my grill pan on top of the stove, and added some slivered carrots to the recipe, heated thru but still crisp.  I stopped at the Korean restaurant for some Kimchi to serve with it.

Easy and delicious! The meat is so flavorful.  The flavors are balanced so well, it makes our mouths water! Slightly charring the meat is key because it kind of caramelizes the sugar. When I fail to do that the meat just doesn't taste (or look) as good. Often times I do this in a skillet instead of the grill because I'm in a hurry.  I like to use ribeye for this dish because ribeye is our favorite cut of beef, flavorful and tender. But I have successfully used other cuts of beef and they were good too.  I always follow this recipe for the marinade and cooking the meat, but I have 2 different ways of serving it. Sometimes I serve the meat over a bed of steamed rice. Sometimes we make lettuce wraps and along with the meat we will have either rice or rice noodles, thinly sliced carrots and cucumber, and herbs like basil or cilantro.  We do whatever we feel like according to our taste or what we have on hand.  Lastly, I usually only marinate the meat for 30 minutes to an hour.  When I cook the meat in a skillet it retains the marinade (instead of dripping off on a grill) and thus retains the flavor.  One time I marinated the meat over night and it was waaaaay too strong.

I always find marinading easier to throw everything in a gallon freezer bag, sealing it, and squishing it to get everything blended. I don't have a grill per se just a really hot skillet sprayed with Pam® does the trick.

I used brown sugar instead of white and toasted the sesame seeds.  Next time I will use a little Indian chile powder.

My husband said to add that you should eat this with kimchee.  As I only make that stuff but do not eat it  I had mine over white rice.  Next time I will make extra marinade and set some aside before adding the marinade to the meat.  And use the extra over the rice.   We cooked it on a Cuisinart griddler indoors.

I actually used 1lb ground beef with this recipe and it was amazing! I made some rice for a side and made it into a lettuce wrap. The whole family loved it. I have garlic-chili paste that I use inside the wrap. The flavors were delicious together.

I subbed brown sugar for white sugar like other commenters suggested and this was fantastic.  We served it wrapped in lettuce with some rice.  Will definitely be making again!

I made it with chicken because I can't afford beef, and it was DELICIOUS! I mixed in two scrambled eggs and put some sriracha on top for good measure. Next time I think I might add bok choy!

Loved this recipe. Tasted restaurant quality. The only thing I would change is I would make it in a wok instead of on a grill. Then you can make a sauce out of the juices and marinade instead of letting the flames get those yummy tastes!

I was skeptical because of how easy the marinade was but it all came together tasting delicious.  It was nice to have something milder for the non-adventurous types in our family.  We used this to top off homemade Bibimbap and it was a huge hit.  I look forward to making this again.

I've been making this recipe for years now.  Hubby loves bulgogi and he always raves about this.  I do use brown sugar instead of white and leave out the green onions.

Our family loves this recipe served on romaine lettuce leaves with brown rice, pickled ginger and sweet chili sauce. As others have, I use brown sugar instead of white. Freeze the flank steak wrapped in plastic wrap until it's pretty solid to get thin slices. Excellent on the BBQ.

This is a really good base recipe.  I prepped using the recipe here the night before and cooked a few pieces in the morning to test before making the meal for dinner later.  For my taste, it needed a few additional touches which included ginger and about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I also added one diced Asian pear to the marinade.

This is the same recipe that my Korean aunt makes except she also uses brown sugar instead of white and she adds different veggies different all the time she don't use the red pepper either but it is so good my husband is not big on eating anything that's not American food but this is one thing he will eat and it seems like it is probably healthier than other things I make and it quick I use a indoor grill or grittle.

So qeustion, you soak it raw in the soysauce/stuff right? So, if I have a frozen hunk of flank, I should thaw it, then soak it overnight, then cook it the next day?

delish! I used a cheap cut of beef (arm steak) because it was on sale. I sliced it thin, but wasn't sure how thin to slice...the reviews I read after the fact said about bacon thickness. Next time I'll cut it thinner!  I didn't have sesame oil so I substituted Peanut oil. No scallion, so I used yellow chopped onion. Brown sugar instead of white. I also added sriracha because it adds a nice spice without overpowering the sweet flavor. Its winter so I cooked it in a skillet until medium rare. I served the sauce and beef over brown rice...was very happy with this simple and protein-filled meal!

I made this using ground beef. I browned the meat and rinsed in cool water than added back to the pan... used regular white onion, about two tablespoons of finely diced. sautéed the meat and onions  in the two tablespoons of sesame oil till the onion became clear.  Added the soy sauce, garlic sugar mixuture and finished it with the black pepper. My daughter and Husband love this. I make it at least three times a month.

I have been attempting to turn Korean foods vegetarian so I used Tofurkey and sliced them bias julienne technique. I didn't have to marinade them. They soaked up the seasoning quite well.

I fed them to a seriously picky meat eater and she actually liked it enough to ask me for the recipe.

I have made this a few times now, with flank or skirt steaks, which ever I have on hand. I use brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer. I serve it with rice and an Asian style salad, usually the one that Costco has. Everyone in my family likes this one!

This is incredible, such good flavor! I haven't been able to get my beef sliced very thin and could only pan fry it.. So I imagine it's more 6 star worthy if you do that. I can't wait till I have a grill and can get it sliced by a butcher!

It was amazing!  I would recommend only marinating for a short time - especially if you cut the meat very thin.  I did marinated it for 45 minutes and would do it no longer than that.  This is a wonderful, easy and quick to prepare dish.  I cooked it in my wok in batches.  I served it with rice and a vegetable.   I think it would also make a great stir fry.

My family loves Bulgogi and we've gone out to a local Korean restaurants on many occasions to have this dish.  This recipe is close to authentic but he dish really calls for Sake or Mirun.  I use some Mirun and reduced the sugar. We ate orcas a wrap with kimchi, Asian rice, head lettuce and peanut sauce. Just like the Korean restaurant by my house. I gave it four out of five stars for the lack of Sake or Mirun.

Awesome!  I made this a couple of times and it is a hit each time.  I even used brisket cut against the grain.  I tried it as is the first time and it was great. The second time I omitted the sesame seeds and put in a touch of mirin and ginger.  When I cooked it, I just dumped it in a hot cast iron pan.  When close to done, I put cornstarch in to make it a thickened sauce and then added some steamed broccoli.  Then I served it over rice.  Best beef and broccoli ever!  My kids friends even gobbled it up and said it was way better than any Chinese food they've had.  So experiment away. This recipe is great as is but allows you a lot of options.

Absolutely delicious! If you want to tweak the flavor a bit try using brown sugar instead of white sugar. It doesn't change the flavor drastically, but in my opinion, it made it taste even better. Also, what we started doing in my house, is throwing in a pinch of red pepper flakes. This will give it a nice hint of spice on the back end of every bite. Don't overdo it though or you'll make it too spicy! A small amount, roughly 1/8 of a teaspoon should suffice. It all depends on your tolerance and preference  for spice, however!

I have made this recipe for years! Always in demand. Though I use brown sugar instead of white, and use 4 Tablespoons of Sesame oil. I use a table top grill to cook it right at the table, eat it right off the grill, just like in Korea, when I was in the Army!

I used brown sugar and included a small amount of honey, 1 tablespoon of red wine ( I usually drink my wine and use cooking sherry instead- wink, wink) and a couple teaspoons of freshly grated ginger. Over the years I have found flank steak to be the best cut of beef for this recipe, don't overcook/BBQ it and leftovers are great on an Asian salad. Other cuts of beef can be used. This is a family and guest favorite.

I followed the recipe by the letter, except that I fried the thin slices in a very hot pan because I did not have a BBQ available. I never had Korean food before, but this was really tasty. Next time I will follow the recommendation of some users here and use brown sugar instead of white. And maybe spice it a bit up with chili peppers.

Man this was delicious. Followed instructions exactly, marinated the beef for about 3-4 hours and ate with some mashed potatoes.  Pretty easy and so flavorful.  Will make often!

I worked for a few years at the Chinese Express at Hyvee, which is a grocery store in the Midwest with those unfamiliar. I had Made bulgogi a few times there and absolutely loved it. I was ecstatic when I saw a recipe on here. I realized I forgot to marinade it and decided to make it anyway. I improvised by making the sauce/marinade, pouring it over the meat, and mixing it well. I poured all of the mixture into a pan on the stove top instead of a grill. I also ended up throwing in some veggies at the last minute. I think it turned out fantastic even if I didn't follow the recipe to a T. The ability to improvise is a very useful skill in the kitchen. Definitely would make this again.

My family and I have had this every Christmas for our meal. Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  We serve it with bean sprout soup, Kimchi and Keem. Oh and steamed rice. If short on time but craving it, you can make it with hamburger. Just don't marinate it. The hamburger version is ready before the rice is done. Both fantastic !!!

I recently became a foster mom to a boy from South Sudan, all foods are new and foreign to him, but he asked if this dish could be made every Thursday. It's his favorite dish (aside from pizza and chicken patties). I didn't change a thing. I serve it wrapped in lettuce with rice and kimchi inside too. It pairs well with a tofu salad. It's now a staple in our home.

This was awesome! I did try one batch with white sugar and the other with brown sugar. I do prefer the brown but both were very delicious! It did however taste a little too salty for me so next time I will be using low sodium soy sauce. Thank you for the recipe!

I thought my husband was going to lick the plate.  This was my first stab at bulgoi, and this was delicious!  I marinated overnight.  I have a deli meat slicer and sliced at #1.  This gave the meat a very thin, even slice.  You want a hot grill, but do have to be careful not to burn the beef.  I have a hot spot on my grill that got some of the meat a little too crispy.  Our family can usually eat no more than 1 pound of meat at dinner.  I made 2 pounds so we would have leftovers.  Guess what?  No leftovers!!!

Although it was highly reminiscent of a Korean BBQ restaurant; I even smelled just like when I leave Honey Pig, I used Braggs amino instead of soy sauce so maybe that's why it came out a bit salty.
Also, I added pineapple and onion; some recipes called for Asian pear but I could not find it. This made the cuts I was using super tender! About 1/4 cup of pineapple and 1/4 of onion per lb. 
Overall it was a yummy change in our usual dinner routine. 
We ate our as bulgogi tacos with probiotic kimchi!

This was amazing! We didn't even grill it and it still tasted great. We cooked it in the cast iron on high heat to quickly char it. I'll definitely make it again.

Oh my gosh!  This is delish!  Boy, am I glad I found this recipe!  My husband was eating it as he was slicing it and I had to stop him before it was all gone.  He was even licking the knife!  I marinated it whole, grilled, let rest for 5 minutes then sliced.  We thought it would be easier to grill in one piece.  We served it with basmati rice and kimchee that I found at our publix.  My publix also sliced the flank steak thinner for me so it was fall apart tender.   I marinated it for about 8 hours, but next time I will prepare better and do overnight.  I cannot imagine it  having any better flavor,  but never hurts to try.  Thanks so much for the recipe - we will be making this often!

I'd never made Bulgogi before. I served it to my partner without telling him what I had made. He took one bite and said, Bulgogi! He even gave me a fist bump for it because he said it was that good. Trust me that's a compliment because his ex wife is Korean. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  I lived in South Korea for a little over a year and have been on an endless search to find a beef bulgogi recipe similar to what I remember from my time there.  My search has finally ended; this was delicious!  I prefer a little heat in mine, so the only substitution I made was I used 2 tablespoons sesame chili oil and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in place of the 3 tablespoons of sesame oil.  I put mine in the marinade in the morning after breakfast and it was perfectly seasoned by the time I put it in the grill for dinner. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

Even fantastic with granualated garlic and dried chives subbed in.  I also used brown sugar for half of the sugar amount and really liked that. (It was not too obvious in the flavor, but added a nice flavor component to it.)

I added pear to the marinade to help tenderize the beef. I pan fried the beef with the marinade which made it nice and saucy. I served this over red leaf lettuce and couscous. I added a little red chilli paste as a garnish and it was delish! Also very nice presentation.

Yum!  Marinated for about 6 hours in the fridge, and cooked indoors on our grill pan.  The beef is easier to slice thinly if you put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes before cutting.  Cutting across the grain makes it easier to eat, too.  We took another reviewer's advice and wrapped it in leaf lettuce with rice and kimchi, which was messy but soooo good.  I will definitely make this again!

Easy and delicious! I also substituted the sugar for brown sugar and the sesame oil for olive oil. Since I don't have a grill I broiled the meat and it turned out great.

I use brown sugar instead of white and also 7-up or sprite for my marinating ingredient( good meat tenderizer)and crushed red peppers for spice.

This recipe makes very good beef bulgogi.  Every time we make it we finish the entire pound of beef, very guilty...  If you add some onions and sever with rice, it could pass as a nice home-made Korean dish.

This was a great way to do beef instead of chicken in an Asian dish. It was pretty garlicky and salty even with low sodium soy sauce, though. Would like to try citrus juice in marinade to further reduce the sodium. I cooked the beef on my pancake griddle and it was so easy! Only had time to marinade for 1 hour but will do longer next time. Thanks!

I can't quite replicate the perfectly pan cooked bulgogi from our local Korean restaurant. But this is the closest thing I can get making it at home. Marinating for more than 24 hours is too much but I like marinating for at least 6 hours.

We use a whole full cut thick round steak, unsliced. Marinate at least 8 hours. Cook to medium or medium rare, let it rest and then slice on the bias. You'll wonder how a round steak could taste so good!

So good!  Use a good cut of meat. I recommend marinating overnight. One hour is not long enough.

This is excellent meal, I have a Japanese friend who taught me how to make this. I add a can of coke, makes tender, and 1/2 cup of soy sauce, half cup white sugar, and brownsugar.. marinate over night, stirring it up from time to time. The more sugar is added, the better because it will have a glaze. The lady that taught me, added grape jelly hers. Eat over or with rice, and broccoli. This is the best.

Every time I make this our friends ask for the recipe! I substitute the beef with boneless chicken breast sliced thin and it's great.  Love it with the steak also. Double the marinade because you'll want to make more of this to have leftovers.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was OK. Nothing amazing. Nothing I will put in my recipe folder to make again, it was just Meh. I actually marinated it for 2 days, the flavor was just so-so. It is easy to make and the family enjoyed it. Maybe I need to play with the ingredients.

believe it or not, I made this as a freezer meal. last month, i was on here looking for different recipes to add to my OAMC repertoire and i decided to try this one. i followed directions for the marinade and stuck some cheap thin sliced steaks in a baggie...i think may have added a touch of pineapple juice to the marinade….. and put them in the back of my freezer (with a note on how to prepare and to serve w/ scallions) and forgot about it. 

Fast forward to last nite...I bought some scallions and remembered i had this stashed--- so i pulled it out. i didn't expect it to be all that great…but i was wrong... it was excellent!! 

I made this as a lettuce wrap, served with a touch of hoisin sauce,  and it was a really tasty, satisfying but light summer dinner. will go in my freezer meal rotation.  

If you are making this tonight, do yourself a favor and double this recipe and freeze additional portion for another meal. it will taste just as great as the one you make tonight! U will not regret it! 

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE FOR THOSE WHO DO OAMC!!!

This is the best way to cook flank steak, or any other tougher piece of beef, hands down.  Even my kids loved it.  I typically put it in the marinade the night before, but I've had it in for two nights with no ill effects.  Boil the left over marinade and serve over jasmine rice.  Enjoy??

I really love this recipe.  I use it monthly if not weekly.  I use it as a base of a stir fry instead of just the meat....that way I get to use all the marinade!  I throw in some veggies (what ever I have) along with the meat.  Marinate as long as you can, then stir fry it up adding a bit of thickening at the end.  Oh and I add some hot peppers too.  FANTASTIC!!

It's winter here so couldn't grill, instead I cooked them on high heat in a cast iron skillet.  pretty good but I think the sauce maybe had a bit too much sesame oil.  after cooking this way, I can see why it would be much better on a grill, the marinade ended up almost burning in the bottom of the skillet (no I didn't dump in the marinade but it transferred from the beef to the pan and stuck.)  will try again in summer!

A very enjoyable meal! I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and added carrots and celery.  Also, instead of grilling the meat I dumped out the marinade/meat/veggies into a skillet and cooked it for 10 mins on med-high heat.  Served with rice it was delicious, albeit unauthentic.

I've always loved bulgogi, but have never made it at home before today. What an amazing recipe! I did change it up a bit...
1) I didn't have sesame seeds so I subbed it for 2 tsp of extra sesame oil
2) I used only 2 tbsp of brown sugar and added half a pureed pear
3) I added a dash of ginger
Simply delicious with jasmine rice :)

This recipe is delicious and very easy! My family loves Korean BBQ and Bulgogi in particular. We marinate this over night and cook it in a very hot saute pan. No problems, no issues, just perfect flavor and texture. We eat this with lettuce leaves and steamed egg and a few sauces that we like. I can't thank you enough for sharing this and for allowing me to make something at home that we used to have to wait for going out to have! It's a regular at our house, we have this at least once a month :)

Since I always marinate it overnight, I don't fuss much over the slicing of the beef. I cut it as thin as I can with my terrible knives and don't worry about it too much. Make sure all of the sugar dissolves in the marinade before adding it to the beef. I use brown sugar and it takes longer to dissolve. Since I hardly ever buy green onions, I use white or red onions and it works great. I cook it indoors on a very hot pan with very little canola oil. I sautee the meat in batches and really quickly. Since the pan starts getting black, after a few batches (I double the recipe sometimes), I roll a ball of paper towel and quickly clean the pan using kitchen tongs. I don't serve it with traditional sides. Tonight was with quinoa and brocollini, a few weeks ago as fajitas (gasp). Delicious!

Definitely authentic Korean taste! Followed the original recipe and marinated over night. BBQ on my gas grill & it came out amazing! Only thing was the meat I bought at my local butcher was a little lean, next time I will get a better cut or buy the meat from the Korean store. My wife the picky Tokyo girl gives this 5 stars too, so even the finicky eaters will love this.

Tried this for the first time tonight, very good. Even got the  approval of the boyfriend who can be a little picky. Had it in lettuce wraps with rice. Don't have a grill, so I cooked it up in a skillet as a previous review suggested. One thing to note, if you cook it that way, you will need to scrape the pan between batches to keep the excess marinade from gunking up the pan too much, but totally worth it.

This recipe is perfect. I live in the UK and I miss good Korean food that we used to eat in Australia. I just added a touch more soy sauce and a touch more sesame oil, used brown sugar instead of white, and cooked it after 1 hour as suggested. Loved it! it's so flavour full!

Fantastic! I'd never heard of beef bulgogi so I can't weigh in on authenticity, but this tastes great. A little strong, I only marinated a little over an hour and would definitely not do so any longer. Easy and tasty.

I made this tonight & it was absolutely delicious! My daughter told me it taste just like the Bulgogi we get from the Korean restaurant. I used a 2lbs sirloin beef roast instead of steak since that was what I had one hand. I substitutes brown sugar for the white. I tripled the marinade and put it in the fridge over night. I don't have an outdoor grill so I put it in the wok. I served it with sticky rice and matchstick carrots. This will definitely be a regular meal in our house! Quick, easy & delicious.

First of all I did not grilled the meat but sauteed it.I found the soy flavor to be too strong for my taste,I might try it some other day but will use less soy sauce and less sugar.

Awesome recipe!!! My husband and I always try and get Korean BBQ when we travel, so when I saw this recipe we just had to try it. This is just like in the restaurants, but better flavor!!! I made a few changes/additions to the recipe based on others reviews and let it marinade for about 8-9 hours (work day). The change I made was I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and the addition I made was added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for a little extra kick to the marinade mixture. It smelled amazing and grilled up really quickly. We ate it wrapped in Red Leaf Lettuce with Basmati Rice and had Garlic Chili Sauce and Chinese Hot Mustard on the side for dipping. This is a definite make again and highly recommend!!!

I followed this recipe to the T . I dont believe in changing up the recipe cause then it would not be a fair review. This was very yummy. My meat was super tender. The only thing I did was cook it in an oven at 425f for 5 mins cause i do live in a Condo and having a bbq is not allowed. I left my meat to marinate in the sauce for about 3 hours. I think if I let it sit for an hour more, it would of be perfect.

This recipe is awesome!! The only thing I added was a 1/4 cup sprite/cola, since that was what I was told to add by my Korean friend that owns a Korean store I shop at, it turned out perfect. I marinated it for 5 hours and the flavors were just spot on. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Easy, thx for earlier recommendations.. Partially froze the steak for easy thin slicing .. Taste like gyro steak... Which I Love... Amazingly easy and yummy... No idea why everyone recommended brown sugar... But I will try it next time, I'm am an armature cook so I appreciate others advice...we didn't have the sesame seeds on hand... I'm sure it adds a nice addition to the dish...it was great even without it. I added this to my recipe box for monthly rotations.

The recipe is great and fairly authentic. The only changes I made was using crushed sesame seeds instead of whole sesame seeds. I rolled the raw flank steak into a pinwheel, then sliced into super thin strips. Sauteed (not grilled) on the stove over medium heat...made some fresh white sticky rice, kimchi, and seaweed yum. Thanks for the recipe!

I can't say anything more about this wonderful recipe than others before me.  It was truly scrumptious!  At the suggestion of others, I used brown sugar instead of white and I also added half an Asian pear, minced. I served this with Gochujang (my new favorite condiment), Kimchi, and black soy beans and green beans as my Banchan. I wrapped the beef in lettuce leaves.  Thank you TNCOUCH!

Not bad! While I didn't find this to be outstanding, it was VERY good nonetheless. I'll admit, I was a bit intimidated at first. Every time I've ever made beef stir-fry or anything calling for thinly sliced beef (i.e. cheesesteaks, etc.), my meat has ended up tough (grrr!). I found a video on YouTube that REALLY helped me. I removed the tough sliverskin from my meat. You want to keep some of the fat, but not all of it, especially the silverskin (this will not tenderize despite how long you cook it). I cut my flank steak into three large sections (AGAINST the grain) and then cut SUPER thin slices by holding my chef's knife at a 10 degree angle. This sounds more difficult than it actually was. :) If your flank steak is small, you won't need to cut it into sections like I did (my piece of meat was long and since I wanted medium-sized strips, I cut it into several smaller, manageable pieces and proceeded from there). My only change was to stir-fry my bulgogi in a wok because it was too darn cold to grill outside. As TNCOUCH suggested, I served my bulgogi wrapped in red lettuce leaves stuffed with (jasmine) rice and a little chile paste. Although a unique idea, our wraps did not hold up at all. :( We ended up eating our bulgogi on top of rice instead and really enjoyed it this way. Thai cucumber salad (camp0433) perfectly complemented our meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, TNCOUCH! :-)

So simple, so incredibly tasty. Broiled on high for 4, 3 minutes each side. Served with iceberg lettuce leaves and a Sriracha-mayo spread. Put the spread on the lettuce, then the beef, roll it up and you have a delicious low-carb meal!

Loved this recipe! I let the beef marinate in a ziplock bag overnight, then cooked the next day, and it came out great! I also used 1/4 cup of chopped chives and about 1/6chopped onion instead of spring onions, since that's what we had on hand and the flavors worked great! One recommendation is to store the leftover beef and sauce separately as it can get a bit too salty sitting in the sauce.

Was very good, but I believe the cook time was a little confusing.  Def took me longer than 5 mins...but I also like it to be DONE.  LOL!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  My husband and I tried it last night and could not stop making trips to the kitchen to eat the leftovers!  We also took the suggestion of using brown sugar instead of white sugar...I'm sure either would be great but it was wonderful with the brown sugar.  We marinated it for about 4 hours and it was delicious!

I used london broil, which I froze then cut thin- followed the direction but used 1 TBS Karo, and 1TBS Brown sugar rather than white sugar. I also added about an ounce or two of regular coke (as some one mentioned their Korean mother doing).
I cooked part of the batch after marinating for 2 hours (the rest I'll cook tomorrow) under the broiler. I served along side steamed sushi rice and lettuce (for wrapping)- a little rooster sauce on the side. Fantastic! I'm not a fan of beef, but these were super easy to make, quick to cook, and were delicious.

The whole family loved it! I took the suggestions offered and substituted the white sugar for brown sugar and added some red pepper flakes for spice. I will certainly make this again.

Serve this Korean style with all the ingredients separated in bowls at the table so everyone can serve themselves, it's more fun and easier. Must put the steak in freezer for an hour to slice thinly before marinating (don't leave it too long in freezer or else it will be too hard). I use Iceberg lettuce and cut it about half inch or so above stem so it is easy to separate the individual lettuce wraps. Crushed peanuts is a nice touch.

We really liked this.  I tried making a lettuce wrap which wasn't very successful for my fiance :-).  But the flavor was excellent!  I'll make the beef again but just put it over rice.

i tried using the flank steak and my meat came out tough. next time i will use beef ribs. i also added a couple spoons of cornstarch mixed with a bit of water to thicken the batter and cook it faster. next time i will marinate it longer - a few hours - a day. the sauce & recipe is pretty good. i dont have a grill so i just "fried" it in my wok - maybe 8 min?

This is AMAZING.  Actually printed it out because we were on a diet and it had the right amount of calories for a dinner meal, but it has become a staple in our home.  Made it just as the recipe says except sometimes we just cook it on the stove.  If on the stove, the leftover juices are perfect to put on noodles or rice.  If I could give it 10 stars I would!

Great salty sweet combo.  Served it with ginger rice and wrapped everything up in romaine lettuce leaves.  Some folks might like to top it with some Thai chili sauce or something similarly spicy.

We have made this recipe a few times in our family and absolutely love it. The only change we have made is using brown sugar instead of white, and doubling it. We cook it on the stove-top and it comes out great every time.

Only change was to use brown instead of white sugar. Did it on the Bar-Bee and served it up with white rice, steamed dumplings with a peanut (butter) sauce.

I thought this was 4 stars...great flavor.  However, I served this to my bf and his friends and it got rave reviews so I'm giving it five stars.  Followed the recipe pretty exact but left out the sesame seeds because I didn't have any.  Still tasted good.  Just served it with white rice but next time will include some veggies.  Thanks!

The flavor on this was great!!  Mine ended up tough and could not eat in a lettece leaf.  Next time I will try this on a better cut of meat.  I think it would be good on pork as well. I put the left over meat in some fried rice I made the next day.  You could even put this and the sauce in fried rice and it would be good as well.

This was delicious.  I marinated for a full 24 hours, and the meat was very flavorful and super tender.  I stir fried instead of grilled.  Because I did not want to waste the delicious sauce, I added a slurry of water/cornstarch at the end to thicken and serve over rice.  The whole family loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

really good and easy, I did add 1/2 tsp corn starch to thinken up the sauce, and also 1 med onion sliced. I was having a hard time cutting the beef in thin slices, i heard if you freez it before hand its easier to slice thin.
