These were very easy and surprisingly pretty tasty! Perfect for birthdays! I thought the amounts of powdered sugar and sprinkles was a little much, I had quite a bit left over. I also had to leave my cookies in the over for about 10 minutes instead of 6.

The cookies were fairly quick and easy. I think I was too much of a perfectionist when I was rolling them in powder sugar and sprinkles mixture.  Because it just felt like that part took forever.  After reading other reviews I measured out a 1/3 cup of powder sugar and  left it in the measuring cup. Then I  took out a few tablespoons of the sugar at a  time and mixed it with the sprinkles in a small bowl. I added more sprinkles and sugar as needed.  That way I was able to gage my sugar mixture almost perfectly and didn't have any leftovers.

These were a hit at my co-worker's birthday party! So easy and quick! I sprinkled more of the powdered sugar mixture on top when I took them out of the oven. I had bought frosting to put on top but I didn't even need it. Great recipe; I will definitely use it again!

These were really good.  They taste just like birthday cake. My kids said they were "super yummy" which is high praise in my house.  The cookies needed about 7 1/2 minutes in the oven, not the 6 the recipe calls for, but my oven tends to run a bit on the cooler side.

Easy and fun! I went exactly by the recipe and I have a cookie scoop which made this go even faster. The cookies are good, like eating birthday cake. Not the best cookie I've ever had ...but just like birthday cake.

These weren't exactly gourmet but they were good, quick and easy to make with kids.  Will try again with strawberry cake mix and maybe lemon!

I have no complaints! I found them quick and easy to make. They are also way cheaper and a lot less work than making an actual birthday cake. You can taste the pudding flavor in the mix.

These cookies are incredibly simple to make, and they tasted amazing! I didn't add the sprinkles or powdered sugar, but it still has an amazing, slightly, cakey taste

The only change I made was to cook these cookies longer.  11 minutes per batch at 375.  Too bad they only make 24. They're delicious !

Super easy and so good! I rolled the bals in the sprinkles. They came out great!
Note, ther are many cookies you can make using the basic cake mix eggs & oil recipe. Add the extras depending on what kind of cookie you are making.

It doesn't get quicker or easier than this one.  Very cute cookies, tasty, and I can see making them with a lot of different mixes.  Sometimes you don't want to spend the time to start from scratch and these hit that mark!

I found these really sweet but my kids loved them so that gives them 5 stars.  Super easy to make and very fun to serve.  I am sure we will be experimenting with other cake mixes for different flavors.
