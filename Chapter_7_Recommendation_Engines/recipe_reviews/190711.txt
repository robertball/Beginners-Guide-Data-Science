One of my friends described this as 'German Potato Salad' meets Green Beans which is a great combo!!   Here's my suggestions for next time:   -- substitute red potatoes if you don't have new potatoes and dice them into 1/2 inch chunks -- after cooking the bacon, remove it and cook the onions in the bacon fat.   Add another T or 2 of butter if necessary -- once the onion is cooked, add the potatoes and garlic.   Cook for a couple minutes and then add the green beans and broth -- do not add too much broth as this will make your 'sauce' too soupy. --  make sure you have a large enough pot to be able to mix the vegetables as they cook.  Otherwise the bottom cooks and the top is still raw. -- Once the dish is plated,  sprinkle the bacon on top for an attractive presentation. -- Enjoy!!

Being southern, when I first made this recipe I included the bacon grease for extra flavor but next time I'll drain it off.  No need to fry up bacon, you could just use bottled real bacon bits.  Also since the small new potatoes aren't used whole, they are diced, you could just use 3 or 4 regular size potatoes.  Loved the balsamic vinegar in this. Will be making this again!

These were great, lots of flavor.  Didn't put in the potatoes because I was serving baked potatoes and used plain white vinegar instead of the balsamic.  Also used home canned green beans (drained).  Just tossed them a bit to blend with the other ingredients while heating and they were ready to serve.

My daughter cried because I forced her to eat 1 of these green beans, big soggy tears!  Then she asked for 1 more green bean to be sure she really didn't like them...then she had to have just 1 more.  That's how I can tell this was a good recipe!!  No leftovers!!

A very good recipe! I made this as a side for Thanksgiving. It smelled wonderful when cooking and went very well with the meal. I needed to cook the green beans much longer than 10 minutes to make them tender, but as the potatoes cooked, some began to break down and thicken the sauce, which was a nice touch. I would prepare again.

So good!  I followed the recipe quite closely.  Substituted a white onion for a red.  I omitted the balsamic and felt no additional salt or pepper was needed.  I believe the balsamic would have been too many competing flavors.

This dish is truly delicious!  I followed one of the other comments that recommended using the bacon grease instead of adding butter.  I also sauted the onions/garlic first for 2 min, then added the potatoes for another 5 min and then finally the broth & beans for the final 5 minutes (with the pot covered to allow it to steam).  That gave the potatoes & green beans the right cooking times (both were fresh from my farm, so getting them perfect is super yummy).  It turned out amazing!!!

This recipe was great! I followed a mix of the reviews and put 1 cup broth, red wine vinegar and cooked it for 15-20 min. Definitely will make it again! :)

I really loved this recipe. I added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth instead of 1/4 cup. I also let it cook a little longer than 10 minutes to get the green beans more tender. It was perfect!!!

This is wonderful - tastes just like my Aunt makes (although she uses fresh from the garden!).  I used white onion (didn't have red), extra chicken stock, and simmered longer.  My BF didn't seem to appreciate it as much as I did, but there's no accounting for Northern taste.   :)

Halfed the recipe and it was plenty for our family of 4.  Definitely need double the chicken broth.  Also...it needs to cook for more like 30 minutes unless you like your beans and potatoes crunchy.  Balsamic Vinegar gives it a nice flavor.

Southern green beans don't crunch when you bite into them. These need to be cooked in a slow cooker for 4-6 hours to be real southern green beans.

These were great. Had to cook a bit longer than 10 minutes though... more like 20 and had to add more chicken stock about twice as much to steam up.

What a great recipe!  The taste is outstanding.  I did a few tweaks, but nothing too different from the original recipe.  I used regular balsamic vinegar as I didn't have white.  I added a little extra chicken broth and I simmered the beans longer than the recipe instructed because I like my beans softer.  I will make this again and again!

I'm from the South, and this is what green beans should taste like!  My family loved them, and requested them for Thanksgiving.  We did not have vinegar, but they were great without.  Wouldn't change a thing except to lengthen the cooking time until the beans and potatoes are good and soft.

You will love this! I followed the recipe closely except for adding a bit more chicken broth which steamed the potatoes and beans to perfection. Like others have noted, it did need to cook longer than 10 minutes. Do not use canned green beans, stick to fresh for this one. In fact, I wouldn't substitute or leave out ANY of the ingredients as the flavors came together perfectly. A good balance of veggies, bacon, and seasoning-I wouldn't change a thing. This is a new family favorite, I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is full proof - trust me, because I cook!
Now, if you want to deviate just slightly, everything is right on with cooking the bacon, throw in the onion near the end and then toss in the garlic.
Here's the shortcut I found that saves a huge amount of time, when everything else in the pan is ready, throw the raw green beans in there and turn the burner on high - add a 1/4 cup water and put the lid on.
Watch it some and if the water gets low, check the beans for doneness if they're still firm, add more water, stir and put the lid back on. you'll have perfect and enviably beans every time.

What a hit!  Doubled the recipe and still had no leftovers!  I kept the small potatoes whole and extended the cooking time to around an hour.  I also added some cayenne and red pepper flakes to turn up the heat.

My mother-in-law HATES frozen green beans... but that's exactly what I used for this recipe and she is still raving about them!!  
I cooked them without butter or onions and sprinkled crumbled crispy bacon over the top before serving.  These were so good I ate them the next day for a light lunch and they were even better :)

This was very good & easy to make, but it took a LOT longer than 10 minutes to cook in skillet & I turned it to medium heat. It probably took 30-45 minutes.

My family loved these green beans!! I didn't have white balsamic so I just used regular.  They are fantastic!! I did cook them for about 30 minutes, as my family doesn't like super crunchy green beans.  Thank you for a keeper!!

Very good. I subbed white onion for red because it's what I had on hand, skipped the vinegar, and used turkey bacon instead of "real" bacon because I don't eat pork. I also used veggie broth in place of chicken broth. I think it needed way more broth than called for. I'll make my own little version of this again. It was a great side dish for barbecue!

So much flavor from these ingredients! I didn't have the white balsamic vinegar and I ended up using more chicken broth than specified. I'm not sure about the timing for cooking these green beans but everyone likes their beans cooked differently (hard vs soft). After the onions cooked I added the garlic, broth and the potatoes and cooked that for 5 minutes. Then I added the green beans and a little more broth to help deliver the steam while cooking. I found that I like the potatoes cut smaller because they packed more flavor. I will make this again and would make it as a dish for an event.

I used a thick cut bacon a bit closer to Canadian bacon in terms of meat to fat proportion. I used a sweet onion as I didn't have any red on hand and omitted the potatoes as I was making a sweet potato mash already. I also didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I used a sauvignon blanc vinegar I did have and it all came out fantastic! I did boil the mixture for another 3-4 minutes on high heat to boil out the water. Served it with prime rib and it was a big hit. Will definitely make again with the potatoes next time!

I didn't have fresh beans, red onion, or white balsamic vinegar.  I used frozen Italian beans, yellow onion and red balsamic vinegar.  I also used real bacon bits for time savings.  This was great!  Loaded with flavor and even the left overs were delicious.  I diced the potatoes in a half inch dice but even so, next time I'll nuke them a bit so the green beans aren't over done.  I like them a little firmer.  Oh and I didn't have chicken brothe either. I used a bit of chicken base and water.  Us po folks gotta get creative.

Loved this recipe! I left out the vinegar since some of my family doesn't like it, but otherwise followed the recipe. Great flavor!

This was very tasty, enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing! I did substitute ham for bacon to use up some leftover Easter ham, and it was a light, wonderful warm weather meal. Thanks!

These green beans were excellent with lots of flavor!  I prepared them exactly as the directions stated with the exception of the cooking time.  I cooked them about twice as long since I felt the potatoes as well as the green beans were a little undercooked for my taste.  One other note...don't skip the balsamic vinegar.  It really adds to the flavor of this dish.

These are wonderful.  The only changes I made were to increase the amount of chicken broth to 3/4 cup and I cooked them until tender as this is the way we prefer them.  The flavor was just so good and reminded me of how my Mom and Grandma fixed them.

This recipe is fantasic! I used about double the broth and simmered for about 15 minutes because my potatoes weren't done after 10 (think I cut them too big). I wouldn't suggest making any other changes as the flavours as perfect as written. Thanks for one of our new favourite sides!

Delicious! Made exactly according to the recipe (except I split the batch into two pots - with different varieties of beans from my garden - and so I eyeballed how much broth went into each - probably more than what was called for) and it was great. I wouldn't change a thing.

So good!  A friend gave me a bag of fresh geen beans from the garden, and this was the perfect way to put them to use.  The garlic is a nice addition to my usual recipe.  I didn't have chicken broth or balsalmic vinegar, but I thought the beans turned out great anyway.  I also used a sweet onion instead of a red onion, but I'm sure the red onion would be great!  I did add some of the bacon grease in place of part of the butter.  As another reviewer mentioned, the beans need to simmer much longer than 10 minutes.  I'm a Southern country girl, and this recipe really brought back memories!

I just love Southern cookin'!  My husband says this is a "repeat" dish.  I was worried at first that there wasn't much liquid to cook it in, but realized when it was ready that it wasn't supposed to be "soupy".  Very yummy; very flavorful.

The dish was pretty good.  However, I needed much more chicken broth than what was called for to keep the dish from burning AND it  took way longer than 10 minutes to finish out the recipe; more like 40 and I was cooking it on 3, then 4.  It upset me much because I was making this as part of my priests' lunch, and I was 25 minutes late getting the dish to them.

These were fabulous! A+ in my book. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my 1st time making this. Next time I may experiment with brussels sprouts, as I saw in one of the pictures. I did have to cook for longer than 10 minutes for green beans & potatoes to cook through just right. 
My son is a huge fan as well :) Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a party of 11 people. It was the hit of the entire meal. Everyone commented on how delicious this was and they all had seconds (I made more than what the recipe called for). The serving bowl was completely empty by the time we cleared the table. The only things different that I did from the recipe is that I didn't have white balsamic vinegar, so I used regular and I didn't have a red onion so I used a sweet onion. I bought the Gourmet Medley bags of small baby potatoes and used those. Also, I let the mix cook longer than the time in the recipe to allow the bacon and onions to carmelize and to allow the flavor to incorporate into the green beans and potatoes. Since I did that, I added an extra 1/4 cup chicken broth to the mix.

We just really loved this....however the beans and potatoes were nowhere near done (at least for us) in 10 minutes.  Mine took 40 minutes covered to get to our preferred doneness.  I pretty much knew this so it didn't ruin the rest of the meal.  I did not remove the bacon after it was crisp.  I left it in the pan and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter with the onions.  I hate to admit this but I really do not know what new potatoes are.  I used small red potatoes that I quartered, a cup of broth vs. 1/4 and regular balsamic, because I don't have white balsamic.  This is a definite keeper!

I tried dumping out the bacon grease and replacing it with virgin olive oil to make it a little more healthy. I may keep a little bacon grease next time. Some seasoning salt instead of reg. salt did the trick! Overall great recipe!

I make this all the time. I use fresh green beans,small potatoes, and cut raw bacon, and add salt. Boil for 45 min and drain. It has the smokey flavor from the raw bacon and is delicious. Frying the bacon takes the flavor out.

This was a hit during Christmas dinner and I made with a yellow onion. The second time I made it I used half a yellow and red onion and it was too sweet. I would recommend using a yellow onion only.

I really liked this recipe!  It was simple and easy to make with ingredients I had on hand.  I made some substitutions -- a white onion instead of red, and sweet potatoes instead of new potatoes because that's all I had.  The sweet potatoes definitely worked well with it!  Make sure you add enough salt and pepper or else it will be kind of bland.  I'm also a huge garlic fiend so when I make this again I'll probaby add more garlic.

I've always been intimidated by using fresh green beans but had some that needed used up and company coming for dinner.  All the reviews had me convinced I could pull it off and boy did everyone go wild for them!  I was out of bacon and used diced russet potatoes, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  I can't wait to try it again with bacon (because bacon makes EVERYTHING better)! Grandma said that she'd like me to bring it for the next holiday dinner - ITS THAT GOOD!

This was delicious! My modifications...at the end I added almost triple the broth and cooked for triple the time, since i like my potatoes and beans nice and soft. Then I did NOT add the vinegar, salt and pepper at the end simply because I forgot that step and honestly, I am glad I didn't. It was delicious! I had two servings!

This was just okay for me, but personally I prefer my veggies more on the light side.  If you like a rich, full flavoured veg side then go for it!

I was looking for a recipe to use some boneless smoked pork chops.  So I made this recipe as written with the following exceptions:  I chopped the pork chops, doubled the potatoes and used 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  It became a one-skillett meal and was delicious!

"Made this due to having the items and they were needing to be used tonight.  It was a wonderful dish!  Enjoyed it very much.  We had to tweek it a smidge because we did not have the correct vinegar nor the broth.  I plan to make it again."

Everyone loved this recipe. My son, who usually hates beans, requests this recipe for dinner. 

I did use olive oil instead of butter, to increase the healthy oils, and it was fine. Otherwise, no changes.

Wonderful. I only changed a couple of things because I used the things I had on hand. I used regular russett potatoes insetad of the red or new potatoes and I used white wine vinegar instead of the balsalmic. Just what i had at home. Thanks!

Very delicious, bacon added a nice contrast to the otherwise healthy (save for the butter too) side dish.

I loved this recipe.  I am from the South and although I have often seen potatoes cooked with green beans, I have never tried it.  I kept the bacon grease in the pan and added the butter to it.  I had to use frozen green beans, which I thawed.  3 bags were 36 ounces.  I used 1/2 lb. bacon and it took probably twice the broth and about 30 minutes or more to cook. Fantastic!

I thought this was fantastic - I think it was only a 3 or 4 for the hubs though.  I used turkey bacon and regular balsamic because I didn't have any white balsamic.  Flavor was wonderful.  Kids gobbled it up too, but they eat anything they think remotely resembles food, so not sure if that counts for anything!

I loved this.  Just like my Grandma's!  Changes that I made: I only used 2 slices of bacon and kept the bacon grease in.  I did not use the butter.  I used red wine vinegar because that is all I had.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good recipe, and it tasted even better as warmed up leftovers the next day. I had to add almost twice as much chicken broth as indicated in the recipe, and I had to simmer longer than 10 minutes so that the potatoes would cook. I also used thawed frozen green beans and regular balsamic vinegar, and I added 3 cloves of garlic. Very tasty.

Outstanding!  Basically followed the recipe, but used chopped up red potatoes. I had a 12” pan, so adjusted the quantities: 10 reds, one pound of the beans. Served with a rib roast that required keeping the oven closed for 5 hours, so needed a dish that could be done on the stovetop.  My guests went back for seconds and thirds! This is without question a keeper!

Might be good if the green beans were actually cooked. 10 minutes was not even close. Plus, not nearly enough liquid to "simmer" for so many vegetables. Added double the chicken broth and We even let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Still uncooked green beans and flavorless potatoes.

I have made this recipe twice.  It is easy and delicious.  Instead of draining off the bacon grease and replacing with butter, I just used the bacon grease.  Also, I cooked it longer than 10 minutes.  Do not leave the white balsamic vinegar out..that is the ingredient that tops it off.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and was so happy with the results!  My picky family members gobbled these green beans and new potatoes up.  I will be making these again and again.  The balsamic vinegar really gave this dish an extra oomph.

Super easy to make! I used some spices to add flavor and it came out amazing! I eyeballed all ingredients and it didn’t ruin anything.

So good! I didn't have bacon but had about a pound of ham so used that instead. Also wanted to use up my 2 lbs of potatoes and only had about 1.5 lbs of fresh green beans. Ended up using a full cup of chicken stock, and though it seemed rather liquidy at first, the potatoes thickened it up nicely to create kind of a sauce. I used jalapeño-infused white balsamic which gave it a very nice subtle flavour.

Loved the beans!  Even my husband, a very finicky vegi eater really liked them and said he would definitely have them again.  I didn't add the vinegar (not a sour fan) and I doubled the chicken broth (as suggested in another review).  I also cooked them a little longer because my husband wants them quite soft.  They were a BIG hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

Is was very good.  I used fresh baby potatoes and green beans from our local Farmers Market.  I used a small amount of bacon drippings instead of butter but other than that followed the recipe.  Delicious with our grilled hamburgers and corn on the cob.

I can't believe how good this recipe is! I have made it so many times now. I now buy potatoes and green beans just to make this recipe, it's super easy and so good!!! I mix it up and add different stuff to it each time I make it. tonight I added mushrooms. I've put peppers in before and I've used roasted almonds as well. This recipe never disappoints.

Reminds me of Sunday dinners growing up. Had this with breaded pork chops and fried corn. My picky eaters who hate vegetables even liked this, especially the potatoes. I didn't dice the potatoes. I got the smallest red potatoes and peeled just the middle part and left the skin on the ends. Yummy.

I made as stated, no white balsamic vinegar so used red wine vinegar. OMG! what a flavor combination. The red wine vinegar gave it a subtle deliciousness that IMO B. V. would not have given. YUM! I also baked it in the oven for 15 min in a covered dish at 350*. Perfect with meatloaf. This combo will definitely be a repeat.

As others noted, I sauted my potatoes, onions, and garlic in a little of the bacon grease.   (I probably drained off about 2/3rds of it.).  Then added the beans and chicken broth, covered and cooked until the beans and potatoes were tender.   I omited the vinegar, stirred in the crumbled bacon and served.  It had a really great flavor.

The star of the show!  I added this as an afterthought at the family Christmas dinner, and it ended up being the favorite dish.  Instead of the butter, I simply used the bacon grease  left from cooking the bacon.  I gave the potatoes and onions a little head start before adding the beans.  I only thought I had a good green bean recipe before....now I KNOW I have a winner!

This turned out much more intersecting than I anticipated. I left the bacon in rather large pieces (1/2") so they were noticeable tasty bits. I also added a hot pepper from the garden that gave it extra zip. A definite keeper.

Wonderful!  A perfect summer side dish made even better with fresh vegetables from the local farmer's market.  I had Vidalia onions and regular red potatoes on hand which I substituted in and increased the chicken broth as recommended by prior reviews, and the result was deliciously delightful!!

I followed the directions leaving out the onions, I'm allergic, and this recipe was terrific.  Great combination of green veggie with potato for a quick nutritious side dish. The taste was great.

Delicious vegetarian option with small changes.  I omitted the bacon and substituted vegetable broth for  chicken broth.   Love the kick of the balsamaic vinegar.  Used finger potatoes and green bean from the farmer's market.  I used olive oil to saute and did throw the green beans in with the onion for the last 5 minutes.  Everyone loved it!

Great flavors. I followed the ingredients exactly but I did have to add more broth as others said, and I kept 1/2 of the bacon for garnish. Served this dish with Sylvia's Ribs recipe and they were great together.

I have never written a review on anything yet, but this recipe is great. I did change only one thing, instead of 1/4 cup of broth I used 1 cup. I would highly recommend this recipe to anybody and I already have.

I didn't think this had much flavor. I added a little extra bacon and even cooked the onions in leftover bacon grease instead of the butter just to add a little more flavor. I used frozen green beans because I didn't have fresh, which worked fine, but the potatoes took forever to cook and I had to add more chicken broth because it cooked up before the potatoes were done. I timed my meal so that this was the last thing to be ready, but it took so much longer than the recipe suggested, we ate the rest of the meal without this on the table. I finished it afterwards. I cut the potatoes up very small, so I'm not sure what happened? Don't know if I will try this one again, but thank you for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Will definitely make this again.  Next time I will throw the potatoes in (w/a little extra broth) and let them simmer until tender, then add the green beans.  Yum!

Great! For my family of 4, I cubed 1 medium russet potato and left the skin on. I simmered it in 1/2 cup chicken stock until tender, then added frozen, French-cut green beans and a handful of real bacon bits from my giant Costco bag. Will definitely make again!

This was an absolutely delicious dish. I was surprised at how fast it cooked, though preparation did take a little while. I added a little oregano and cooked the onions in the bacon grease (which I also added to the potatoes and green beans). I did forget to try the balsamic vinegar though!

VERY good recipe! I made it for the first time at my dinner party, with "down home folk". The only thing I did differently was adding more chicken broth and garlic, to taste. Everyone loved it. True winner.

Last night I made this for my Georgia boring adult children. I loved it, even the DC born child. I took a shortcut by cooking the green beans in my instant  pot for 5 minutes the day before.  This part of my family likes their green beans really well cooked so the pre-cooking solved that problem.

Next time I'm going to add more spice as I felt the beans were too bland.  I made these to go with Bourbon Peach Pork Tenderloin  and dumplings.  So this time there was a lot of taste, but next time I may not be as happy.

I made the recipe exactly as written except used white rice vinegar as a substitute for the white balsamic that I did not have in my pantry. It was delicious!

I would follow the suggestion to keep the bacon aside to make it extra crispy and then serve on top. This recipe was a hit at our BBQ. The green beans were tender, the potatoes cooked in bacon fat with onions were incredible. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

I tried this recipe for my husband who likes green beans, however, I don't and rarely make them.  The few times  in our 40 years of marriage, I did make them I never ate them.  This recipe changed all that...this was good and I loved them..  Nice recipe and the balsamic at the end was perfect.

I made this. It was very good but definitely needed salt and pepper. Did not use the vinegar because no one in my family likes it. It took a bit longer than 10 minutes on simmer, but it was well worth the wait. We paired it with sloppy joes and it was a great meal for the winter blues!

I had to adjust this due to amount of beans & potatoes I had on hand.  A little short on the beans & surplus of gold potatoes.  It was still stellar!

The only thing I did differently was to use green onions instead of the onions called for. I wish I had altered cooking time, as the potatoes were only half-cooked and the green beans were, too. Half crunchy and half-limp noodle. I'll try it again, but next time I'm going to cook the potatoes a little first.

Delicious! Takes longer than 10 minutes to cook. I let mine simmer for almost 30 minutes. I used more chicken broth and sautéed the potatoes with the onions prior to adding the broth and other ingredients. You could easily add additional greens to it (collard greens). I skipped on the balsamic. You get a nice flavor from the bacon, garlic, and onions.

Even without the bacon (some family members don’t eat it in our house), this was delicious! I added just a dash of white wine to the pan before simmering. The potatoes required a few extra minutes cook time compared to the recommended 10-ish minutes. Ended up simmering for about 14 minutes to make sure the potatoes were nice and tender, too. Beans were tender but retained a slight crunch, so perfect on my opinion. Served with slow-cooked short ribs.

I make a similar recipe I thought I would share-
I do like the addition of garlic, chicken broth and
vinegar - a simpler version - cook bacon, let cool
and chop up - cook green beans to your liking
then add your chopped red potatoes to your beans and continue cooking for about 20 mins,
till tender.  While beans and potatoes are cooking, use some of your bacon grease to cook the onion - when beans and potatoes are done
add to the onion and bacon mixture - add some butter and season with garlic salt and pepper. then I finish with a drizzle of olive oil -Yum

Have made these several times - the first 3-4 times as written (except for the vinegar - can't do that!).  They are quite good and close to those my Texas grandmother made 70 odd years ago. Since they are only "close" to what she made I have made some adjustments for my family in an attempt to make them more like hers. I put chopped UNCOOKED bacon, as well as the onion (very coarsely chopped) into the pot with the potatoes and the beans. I also omit the balsamic vinegar. My grandmother did not use chicken broth in her beans, but I do that - only I start with an entire can of broth and top up with water as needed. In the case of water in this dish, to me "less is more." I also cook longer than 10 minutes, maybe about 30 minutes, so that the beans are quite soft and the bacon is soft enough to be pleasing in a bite. This is a go-to company dish when I want to concentrate on my meat. It is easy enough to leave me plenty of time for whatever else I'm preparing. Thank you for posting this and reminding me of Grandmother's beans.

This was a nice and easy recipe. We liked the texture of the veggies but think we would have liked it better without the vinegar. Maybe just butter, salt and pepper would have been better.  I will probably make it again omitting the vinegar.  Probably just a personal taste difference.

My girlfriend in WI always makes me green beans and bacon. I love hers!! I made these hoping for the same results. Nope. However, they were pretty good...just not hers and not exactly what I was craving. I will probably just ask her for her recipe and may never make these again. If however, you do not have a girlfriend with your favorite green bean recipe...you're good to go. These are good. I added left over ham from Easter on top the last few minutes just to steam it and warm it up. No other changes were made.

I made this recipe for my New Year’s day dinner using a frozen package of green with wax beans and carrot medley from Aldi’s that I needed to use up. I omitted the new potatoes because I prepared a twice baked potato casserole (from this website) to serve along with my broiled tri-tip roast. Came out yummy! I’ll make again using fresh green beans to serve with a ham for Sunday dinner.

Delicious. I don't like bacon, so I left that out and it was still wonderful. I also used Yukon Gold potatoes because that's what I had, and I cut them into wedge fries. Green beans are out of season right now, so I used frozen green beans that I first steamed in the microwave. If you wanted some zing, this dish would be great with some red pepper flakes. I served this as a side dish, but I ended up eating this as a main course myself!

Good flavor.  I added the vinegar during the cooking process and added a tablespoon of brown sugar to counter the vinegar flavor.   I added a little extra broth because I didn't "dice" the potatoes small enough so it took about twice as long to cook.  Also, consider adding the fresh green beans a little after you've let the potatoes get somewhat soft so you don't overcook the beans.  Overall ... very good.

Very tasty.  I hate to bite into actual onions so I used onion powder; worked fine.  I also used organic powdered chicken bouillon which also worked.

A welcome change to southern green beans.  Balsamic  adds a nice tang.  I will make this again, but I will use less potato.

I have always made green beans with onions and bacon but never thought about adding small potatoes.  I used peppercorn bacon and continued to season throughout cooking.  My husband said I could make it again.

I liked it, not loved it. It took me a loooong time to make (cutting and cooking the bacon, chopping the onions, cutting the potatoes, prepping fresh string beans, etc.). I might make it again with canned or frozen veggies and bacon bits and see how that goes. Like many others I used more broth (1 cup) and cooked about 25 minutes.

Turned out great. I agree with other reviews that the amount of chicken broth is not enough so since I had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc open, I added about the same amount to the skillet. It added a nice flavor to the beans and potatoes. Alcohol simmers out leaving just the flavor of the grape varietals. I also used 1/2 stick of unsalted butter and made a garlic butter instead.  Thought it would work better at allowing the garlic flavor to steam throughout the beans and potatoes. The suggested time needs to be adjusted. 10 minutes is too short. Mine took about 20 minutes of simmering.

Skipped the bacon. I added some fresh thyme, rosemary and garlic while cooking the onions then also threw in a sprig of rosemary once the stock was added. Used regular balsamic since that's all I had. Was really delicious.

I liked this and would make it again! I had yellow potatoes, a yellow onion, and regular balsamic vinegar, so I swapped those in for those things the recipe called for. I got nervous that there wasn't enough Louis, so I added extra water/broth at the end - wished I hadn't!

Yummy. Only change I made was cooking potatoes a bit, then adding green beans to finish. 
Separately I cooked the bacon, then, in the same pan,  sauted the onion and garlic(I added extra). When done added the broth. 
I added both together; sprinkled with the vinegar,  salt and pepper.
If made ahead, just warm it in the microwave or oven.

These beans were perfect! The only changes I made were to cook the potatoes 10 min. before I added the green beans & I used brown balsamic vinegar because that's all I had. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious - we served on the side of grilled pork chops. I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth (and could have used more) and 3 medium red potatoes diced into cubes. I also just used the grease from frying the bacon rather than adding butter. I needed about 15 mins to cook the green beans and they were still pretty crisp.

I was planning on having green beans and new potatoes as a side to our salmon tonight, but never thought of combining the two until I came upon this recipe. My DH and I both LOVED it!! I used the ingredients listed, however changed it up a bit with what I had on hand, smaller portion, and also to make it a tad healthier…I think—HA?! Here’s what I used: 1 LB frozen green beans, 10 potatoes—some halved, ¼ of large red onion, ¼ cup bagged real bacon bits, 1 tbsp. unsalted butter, 1 tbsp. minced garlic, 10 oz. can low sodium chicken broth, pepper, salt free Mrs. Dash, & light Balsamic/Basil Vinaigrette dressing. I also simmered for an hour or so. It was WONDERFUL—Thank you ericaepp!

We made this for the first time at Christmas last year. It instantly became a favorite! Cook time varies depending on your stove and pans. I have electric and a cast iron skillet. It took longer to get the veggies thoroughly cooked but it is worth the wait!! I will be making it for a third time tonight!

I found this searching for green bean recipes. I eat like a vegetarian, but I'm not one. I had some potatoes and half a red onion; so I cut them all up and cooked 'em in some vegetable stock I got on sale over the holidays. I added no salt or pepper! And diced the 'taters and cooked as the recipe advised, but as someone else mentioned I added the red wine vinegar to the cooking liquid. It was all good! Very tasty and the vinegar gave it that enticing "German potato salad" flavor mentioned. In short? Use this as a good way to prep some green beans and potatoes!

This was a great side dish, and I will definitely be making again. I just added a little more chicken broth than what was recommended and it gave it a great flavor.

Delicious.  I added red kidney beans, the first time.  Next time, tried black beans.  Both were good, but preferred the red beans.  Used Vegetable Broth instead of Chicken.

VEGAN:  Bacon can be replaced by Shitaki Mushrooms.  Once baked, add them to the dish.    Add liquid smoke, maple syrup, canola oil, sherry.

This recipe sounded like it would be perfectly delicious--followed it almost exactly except I didn't have white balsamic so used regular balsamic.  The flavor was just ok.  Not terrible but nothing spectacular either.  I likely wouldn't make this again.

Great way to use up my bumper crop of green beans from my garden! Simple to make & really delicious! I did have to use more than the 1/4 cup chicken stock to keep it from drying out, and cooked longer than 10 minutes to ensure the potatoes were done, but otherwise followed the directions exactly as written. Will absolutely make this again.

The green beans turned out quite delicious but the potatoes didn't absorb the flavor. It got a little better after a few hours when I went to put it away but overall I was not impressed

What an excellent dish this made to go with beef tenderloin.  I was serving 16 people so I had to separate the steps somewhat.  Earlier in the day, I prepared the bacon and beans (fresh picked from our garden) as instructed but boiled the potatoes separately.  At dinner time, I heated the potatoes in the hot oven, reheated the bacon & beans, then combined everything for serving.   I totally forgot the Balsamic vinegar but everyone still raved about this dish, and some guests even took leftovers home.   I'll be making this dish again and will try to remember the balsamic next time.  Thanks to the poster for the recipe.  Oh, I used a combination of small white and red potatoes.

I thought the recipe was great, except that I would double the amount of chicken broth and increase the cooking time to 13 to 15 minutes. This may be due to the fact that I reduced the servings to 4 instead of 8.

Love this recipe!  I didn't use the butter,  I used some of the bacon fat for more flavor.  I had a bit more then 2 lbs ofbeans,  so I used a bit more chicken broth. 
One of my family's faves!

My husband made thus and was great , the only thing to keep in mind is if you are using yellow potatoes to cook partially prior to adding to the beans and bacon or they won't be cooked.

This is a great way to serve green beans.  I used ham instead of bacon because that is what I had. And I used white wine vinegar instead of white balsamic.  My husband really like it.  Said it was "delicious"!

Being a vegetarian, I substituted imitation ham flavoring for the chicken broth and Earth Balance for the butter. Tasted very close to what the elderly women in my family always made for family gathering at my grandmother's house.

Delicious!  I too used more chicken broth.   After I sautéed the onion and garlic, I sautéed the slices of potato to brown them, then I added in the chicken broth.  I let the potatoes cook in the broth until it reduced and added in more broth so that I could add in the fresh green beans.  I then let the beans get crisp-done and it was perfect.  I sprinkled the balsamic vinegar and crispy bacon pieces on top.

Very tasty recipe.  I was looking for a new way to do green beans.  I think you could swap out butter for olive oil to make it dairy free.  I also used hericot verts instead of green beans and in the future, I will use green beans as they are a bit harder and better for longer cook times (that are necessary for potatoes).  My green beans were a little wilty.  I didn't follow measurements exactly, just threw stuff in the pot - everyone loved it!

I tried this tonight -  New Yrs Resolution - to eat more veggies.
This did not disappoint.  I did not have bacon but I had ham and diced that.   Used more chicken broth as suggested.   Will make this often -  thank you.

This was fantastic. I used russet potatoes, a medium/lg yellow onion & about 7-8 strips of smokey bacon. I eyeballed the amount of chicken broth i used, probably somewhere around 2 cups of chicken broth used. it tasted great. i added garlic powder, peppers & salt but forgot the vinegar. The bacon really makes it flavorful and the onion soaks up the flavors great. Made for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Will make in smaller portions for future dinners :)

Made these for my family for Thanksgiving this year and they were really good!  I did add a little Cajun Seasoning to the green beans and was a little heavy handed on the Balsamic Vinegar so I was worried they wouldn't taste good, but these are the best green beans I've ever had.

Great and easy side dish!! Only alterations were using sweet white potatoes for extra flavor, turkey bacon for health purposes, and regular balsamic vinegar for the flavor. Big hit!! Next time I think I'd use white or vidalia onion instead. The red overpowers a bit.

This is very similar to a dish I've done for years, but I suggest adding some pecans just before finishing (so they're still a bit crunchy), to really make this Southern.

Very yummy.  I cut the potatoes into small cubes and oven roasted them seperately first after shaking them in seasoning and olive oil first.  That way they were a bit crunchy. I also cut the beans into bit size pieces so it would be easier to eat. It was delicious! People went back for seconds...

I don't really like green beans, but this was so good I had seconds.

Everyone at dinner loved this recipe. I used 1/2 a walla walla sweet onion instead of the red. It also took longer than the recipe stated to get the vegetables tender. I just kept added a little more chicken broth until they were done. Thanks for sharing. We really enjoyed this recipe.

This is a great recipe! After cooking the bacon, I removed the bacon grease and cooked everything in the same pan.   I had to add more than the 1/4 cup of chicken broth as mine quickly cooked down. I accidentally forgot to add the vinegar, but think this would be a nice addition. DELICIOUS! I will definitely be making this again and again.

Good recipe. Nice flavor. I like the red onions instead of using white. And I left out the vinegar. And put 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 1/4.

These were delicious! Next time I will drain all the bacon grease, like the recipe states, because the beans were a little too greasy for my taste. Otherwise very good and very easy to make.

Great recipe. Didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I added red wine vinegar to taste.

Really good!  I personally think it could have done without the bacon and been just as tasty, for you vegetarian types. But then maybe it wouldn't have been southern :)
