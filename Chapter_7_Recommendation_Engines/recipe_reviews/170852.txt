Yummmm tasted so good just the way the recipe calls. I included a side of southwest rice. Even with the four chicken breasts, we had a lot of salsa leftover. Awesome with tortilla chips. Definitely will use this recipe again!

This was very fresh tasting, but a bit heavy on the tomato content.  I did add a teaspoon of cumin to the salsa, more red onion, and salt & pepper to taste. We pan fried the chicken in olive oil, and seasoned with Smoked Paprika, salt & pepper. I will make this again, but with only one can of tomato. We don't have canned Mango in Nebraska, but we do have it jarred in the chilled produce section.
UPDATE - tried this again with only one can of diced tomato, and served it with sliced avocado on the side - PERFECT!!!

The 5 star rating is for the Salsa.. The salsa was excellent. I could not find canned mangoes, so I went with peaches. It was just as good! The chicken recipe though,  I thought would be too bland for my taste, so I marinated it in bitter orange juice, with garlic powder, adobo, salt and pepper. Left chicken marinating for one hour. Then I decided to put the chicken in a bread mixture and fry it.. Yumm, it was sooo good. and the salsa gave it an extra kick..

This salsa was great.  My husband, who is not a fan of salsa, loved it.  I served it over rice.  Later we scooped up the leftover salsa with hint of lime tortilla chips.  YUMMY
