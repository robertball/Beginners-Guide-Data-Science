Easy to make and even worked well in my stainless steel skillet instead of a cast iron one!! I was surprised at how well this came out, and my kiddos loved it!! A good way to sneak an extra serving of fruit into breakfast!!

Delicious! I didn't have nutmeg and didn't miss it. I have taken the base of  this recipe,  omitted the nutmeg and vanilla, and made some amazing savory dishes with whatever I can find in my fridge. A great way to use up leftovers!

This is an easy and tasty breakfast, perfect for ripe peaches.  I thought one tablespoon of butter was not enough so I used approximately two tablespoons and also put a little cinnamon instead of nutmeg (not a fan of nutmeg) in the batter.  Drizzled with a little maple syrup, it's a nice  breakfast to start the day.

Made as directed, but I used a non-stick pan and only 1 Tbs butter. I also added the nutmeg to the peaches rather than the batter. Next time I would put into the batter to distribute better, and maybe add some cinnamon to the batter as well. I served with honey mascarpone, bourbon aged Maple syrup, and Greek yogurt.

Made as directed, and definitely enjoyed it. After my timer went off I took a minute or two to take it out - think the outside was a little overdone, but still very tasty. Recommend checking for doneness a few minutes before by lifting the outside edge and testing the springiness of center.

Delicious! I used canned peaches as that was all I had (just drained them and dried them with paper towel) and it turned out great. My 2 year old gobbled it up.

This made the house smell wonderful while it was cooking. I didn't actually try this but my son liked it.  He didn't use yogurt but just drizzled maple syrup over it.

We made this for breakfast because we had a big bag of fresh Georgia peaches that we picked up on our way through Georgia this past week.  The recipe was very easy to put together and baked beautifully.  The pancake itself would have benefited from a little more vanilla, nothing that a little pancake syrup did not fix.

Just made this!  However I tweaked things a bit.  I used a stone dish, instead of a skillet.  I also added some baking powder and soda.

Kids gave it 5 starts!

I used more peaches, but not enough, a little dry. Also used GF pancake mix, but accidentally baked a little too long.  Would do again.

We liked this. But just liked it. We aren’t sure if it’s a pancake, French toast, quiche? ...It was easy and used up the peaches we had.

We give this 4 stars because it had a nice flavor and texture. If you top this with syrup and powder sugar it's even better. We would recommend this for a dessert.

Very easy and simple recipe that can be easily modified with whatever fruit you have available. Nice item for a family breakfast or brunch. Has a bit of an “eggy” flavor even when fully cooked. I suggest adding a full teaspoon of vanilla extract to help counter this. Serving with the vanilla yogurt was delicious.

I didn't have two peaches, so i substituted some blueberries in. The batter seemed loose, so I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. Tastes wonderful, especially with maple syrup! My only suggestion would be to add a bit of sugar or maple syrup to the batter.

Delicious breakfast with fresh peaches.  I added extra vanilla and cinnamon instead of nutmeg  per other reviews.  My kids are raving about how yummy it is.

I made this exactly as the recipe reads. It was OK, a little blah. Maybe it was my peaches. I dusted the top with powdered sugar and poured on some Maple syrup, which helped.

I think just taking a dutch baby recipe and adding the peaches would have been about the same.  Needed a little more umph

More like a big crepe with the ratio of flour to eggs and milk.  Not much loft, but nice flavor and was good in a pinch when I didn't have time to cook real pancakes.  Husband liked it, but I don't think I'd make it again.

I've been baking and ran out of milk and vanilla.  I made one following the recipe exactly and a second one with buttermilk and almond flavoring.  The second one had more flavor, but both were tasty!

Made it twice and both times the flavor was terrible,  tasted more like cardboard except the peach's which were the only thing salvageable.
Sorry but a waste of ingredients in my opinion
