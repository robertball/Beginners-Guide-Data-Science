Really yummy.. and very easy. I took them to church and they vanished. I made a  double batch and filled a 13X 9 and a smaller casserole dish... baked the 13X 9 pan 10 minutes longer.  I preferred the edges where there was less chocolate and more graham cracker..

I made these with gluten free graham crackers and butterscotch chips and brought them to a party last night where they were the talk of the party.  They went VERY quickly.  It's like a fresh, home-made candy bar.  Next time, I'm going to swap the butterscotch chips for peanut butter chips to see if the recipe is more kid friendly that way.  Either way, it's a winner!

So easy and delicious recipe. I was having issues with my oven heating properly and they still turned out delicious.  It was the first time making them so reluctant to take them to work to share with others especially since I had to bake them almost 3x longer than indicated due to the oven issue.  However, everyone loved them! Co-worker asked for the recipe to make and she over baked them.  Her family still loved them even with them nearly burnt.  Truly a no fail recipe!
