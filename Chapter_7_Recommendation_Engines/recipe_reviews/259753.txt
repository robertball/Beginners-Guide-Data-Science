My grandson is dairy free this seemed like a perfect cake for him. He loves chocolate so I added dark chocolate chip to the batter.  Yes the batter is thin but baked up beautiful despite the fact I used Pamela’s pancake and baking mix as I didn’t have rice flour. I topped it with whipped coconut milk flavored with chocolate. Yum, yum ??

Moist, not too sweet,  very chocolatey, and no discernable garbanzo flavour. My co-worker brought this in this morning, and it disappeared in minutes.

Oh boy! This cake is dangerous! So moist, and not too sweet, just like I like them! I used light brown sugar because that is what I had. I also don't own a big food processor so I pureed the chickpeas with their juice and the vinegar in my mini food processor, then used beaters to mix everything together in a bowl. Came out perfect! Will make again, for sure!

Still can't believe beans are in this cake. Excellent taste, very moist and so easy.

FANTASTIC! I followed the directions but added some chocolate chips.  These were moist and delicious.  My guests who weren't gluten free or vegan loved these as much as the other desserts.  Definitely a great recipe.
