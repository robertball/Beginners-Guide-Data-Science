I made this for me and another similar recipe from this site for my husband. The one I made for him called for lemon instead of the orange. I preferred this one much better. Knowing that I would be sipping on this very slowly, I made a custom ice cube with fresh orange zest frozen inside which made it super fun. This drink is not for the faint of heart for sure. About halfway through it I wimped out and added some 7-up to finish it off.

Dry, but smooth, with a hell of a kick! 
Perfectly sophisticated flavor. This is a grown up cocktail. No sugary fruitiness here. ;)

I prefer a little extra Lillet for added sweetness, but admittedly I am using fairly cheap gin and vodka  :)

I also like both lemon and orange rind, and I usually rub those around the rim of the glass
