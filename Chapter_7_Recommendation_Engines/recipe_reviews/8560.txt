This recipe can be great, with a few modifications. After I pounded the chicken breasts I breaded them is self rising flour heavily seasoned. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I browned the chicken breasts in olive oil and butter, to give them a really nice golden brown coating. Then I removed the chicken breasts, and deglazed the pan with the champagne. I used more champagne than was called for, (more sauce) and added some minced garlic and dried onions when I added the chicken back to the pan. I then added the mushrooms (the more the better), and simmered them for 20 mins. When I added the cream I did not measure, I just added as much as it took to thicken the sauce. I imagine it was about 2 cups like the recipe suggested. I served this with mashed potatoes and broccoli, however I think it would be great with rice cooked in chicken broth. A very yummy recipe, but more champagne and more seasoning is necessary. Also the self rising flour makes a great coating.

We loved this!  Of course I just couldn't use the 2 cups of heavy cream(dieting), so I modified the sauce by using one can of Campbell's 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup ff sour cream and 1/2 cup of skim milk.  It made a terrific sauce and my husband is still patting his stomach!!

I have been making this recipe for nearly ten years now.  I make it almost identical to this recipe.  I use 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon of real butter.  I also find that flattening the breasts before breading helps with the cooking time.  For this, I just use the palm of my hand.  

I would recommend browing 3-4 min per side before adding the champagne.  Add the champagne, bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer.  Simmer for 20 minutes so the chicken does not get overcooked.

Flouring the breasts lightly is key to getting a sauce that has a nice consisentcy.  If you find your sauce is not at a desired thickness, carefully mix a tsp of flour with some sauce in a seperate cup and then add to the mixture.

I don't use mushrooms in my sauce, but that is only because my DH doesn't care for them.  This is fantastic served over rice (boiled in chicken broth).  It has been a favorite of mine for a long time.

I made this for our anniversary dinner. Used the dry champagne, and it was great. I will definitely be making this again. I did double the sauce ingredients because we prefer more sauce. Excellent! Thanks, Barbara!

Enjoyed this for a weeknight dinner!  Took others' advice and pounded chicken, seasoned the flour, deglazed the pan w/ the champagne and added fresh garlic with the mushrooms.  I can say that after 20 minutes of "almost boiling," my champagne was gone, so I will try covering next time.  Very good over rice.  Will definitely try again. The chicken was very tender.  Oh, I also added butter to my olive oil to help with browning.

This was good but I definitely took suggestions.  I would recommend 1 cup of whipping cream instead of 2, not breading the chicken, using extra mushrooms, and adding garlic & other spices.  It would've been to bland without it; however, excellant dish that the boyfriend loved.

Made this last night and found this recipe to be very good.  I took under consideration other people's reviews which mentioned the recipe was a little bland and doesn't "pop tastebuds".  I cooked everything the way it was specified, but at the end I left the heavy cream to cook for about 8-9 minutes in a 13" skillett (almost boiling the whole time) so that the cream would get a little heavier.  I did a taste test half way through and decided to add about 1/3 cup champagne to the cream to make sure it wasn't too bland.  The sauce consistency came out "just right".  The taste was creamy with a hint of a sour (Champagne) undertone.  Overall I was satisfied with this meal and Bu thought it was good as well - will make it again.

I have made this recipe seveal times and thoroughly love it. We have made a few changes, and for that reason we only scored a 4star.  - we add spices (garlic, pepper, italian) to the dredging flour  - we add enough champagne to mostly cover the chicken  - because we use more champagne, we end up using cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end.  This sauce is amazing on mixed vegetables of your choice as well.

Phenomenal recepie, will definitely be making it again.  Suggest simmering the cream for 10-15 minutes so it's thick enough.

Good but definitely bland.  I added A LOT of garlic salt and parmesan cheese to give it some flavor.  Chicken tender.  Overall OK.

Wow! This recipe turned out great.  Will definitely make this again, next time I will probably add a little nutmeg to the sauce once cream has been added.

I found it very boring and bland even after adding some spices.. The only thing that somewhat redeemed it for my fiance was putting hot sauce on it.

My husband said it's like Chicken Marsala but he likes chicken marsala better. I liked it but it was a little bland - helpful to add a little more garlic.

Bland.  Rename it and add sherry, port or marsala...something else!  Herbs de Provence to flavor the flour before adding the chicken .  Poaching the chicken in champagne for 30 minutes is too long, dries it out.  Try sauting the chicken, add mushroom and cook chicken for about 10 minutes.  Remove chicken until you have deglazed the pan with liquid of choice and finish recipe.  I'd add chicken about 10 minutes  towards the finish cooking.

This was good, but it did take some modifying. Per others suggestions I did flatten my chicken before browning them. I actually flashed fried them and then let them continue cooking in the oven for a bit before putting them back in the pan with the champagne sauce. I added sauted garlic and also seasoned my chicken breast with poultry seasoning.  I used only 1 cup of heavy cream. I agree with others 2 cups is way too much. I also added topped off the finished product with fresh herbs (parsley and oregano) and a dollup of sour cream. Served with parmesan risotto. It was good.

This is sooo yummy! I usu try recipes as is 1st,  but decided to try other suggestions 1st since only c/o seemed to be that it's bland. I added garlic powder & smoked paprika to flour. Then sauteed chicken. Removed ck & added minced onion & garlic. Then, deglazed pan w/champagne (eye-balled amt). Added chicken back to pan & simmered in heavy cream. It needed a bit more S & P. This is an elegant enuf dish for company, VERY tasty & easy! A definite keeper!! Thanx, Barbara.

I didn't think this was bland at all.  It was really excellent--my husband and I devoured it.  The only change I made was adding 2 cloves of minced garlic when I added the mushrooms.  I used a brut champagne.  Will make again when we have champagne to spare.

I thought this an excellent recipe.  I Seasoned the chicken a little more by using garlic.  I will experiment with other seasonings in the future to give the chicken a kick.  The sauce was excellent, and there was plenty left over to combine with rice afterwards.  It was an excellent addition, even without the main course.

This came out really good, but I did make some changes. I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the flour mixture. I used chicken breasts that were on the small side and pounded them a little bit so they were about 1 inch thick instead of 2 inches. I also added half of a sliced onion in with the mushrooms. When I removed the chicken from the pan, I used another 1/2 cup of champagne to de-glaze the pan. Added in a full pint of cream (just slightly more than 2 cups), 2 chicken bouillon cubes, garlic powder, salt, and 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese. Turned out great! This recipe is well worth trying and was a great base for me to work with.  Thanks so much!

I didn't like this at ALL.  What a waste of fantastic champagne!  It was very VERY bland, as others have commented.  I finally threw in some parmesean cheese, so it might have SOME flavor.  If you like FLAVOR, stay away! Mine turned out HORRIBLE.

This was alright....I liked the flavor that the champagne offered, but do agree with others that the dish, overall, was fairly bland.  I did season my chicken with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper before flouring it and served it with some broccoli rice.  I would try this one again...with some minor modifications.  Thanks!

A nice dish--and not so difficult to make.  Great for a winter meal, just be sure to serve it with a flavorful and light side dish, as the chicken is a bit on the heavy/bland side.

Agree with some previous review - as this recipe stands it is rather bland. This is what i would do to liven it up: cook chix first, in olive oil and garlic and then remove from pan. Deglaze pan with the champagne - using 1 cup and 1 cup chix stock. Let simmer for alchohol to evaporate, add rosemary, thyme, basil, s/p to taste. Add mushrooms, then 1 cup cream, not 2. Replace chix and let simmer for about 10 mins. Add a little cornstarch disolved in water to thicken if preferred. Serve over orzo, not rice. This would be very similar to a chick marsala type recipe.

This recipe was by far by my family and I's standerds, the best thing I have ever cooked. Everything was perfect. Although it says i had to cook the breasts in a skillet so I had to slice them inhalf. Be wary of how thick your chicken breasts are. It was FANTASTIC!!!! Will be making more than one a month.

This is a wonderful dish, and very elegant. Made it for my anniversary this year with the BF. I added a little salt after making it as written, but that's a matter of personal preference.

I made this for Valentine's Day.  I didnt bread the chicken as others had suggested.  It was good but if you are looking for something to pop your taste buds this isnt it.  Easy to make which is always a plus with me :-)

I first tasted this meal in a restaurant in Texas last year.  I was so impressed that I spoke to the chef to get recipe pointers.  His recommendation was the you "Must soak the chicken Overnight" to add flavor to the meal.  I'm making it for friends this weekend and expect rave reviews.

This recipe is great, I have made several variations of this recipe myself. One of the greatest recommendations I can give is to marinate your chicken breasts for a few hours in champagne as well. It makes them super tasty. ^.^b

Just made this for dinner and can I say YUM!  I did brown chicken in 1T butter and 1T oil and I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  The chicken melt in my mouth.  I served over rice and with steamed asparagus.  We couldn't get enough of the sauce on the rice.  I will definitly be making this on a regular basis.  Quick and easy too.

Normally if something has four and half stars on this site it is pretty good.  However, I saved this recipe for Valentine's Day and it was NOT worth the wait.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and that didn't seem to help it much.  It was just chicken that tasted a little bit like champagne.  Very boring.  My husband and I were both disappointed - the leftovers will be turned into something much better.  Don't waste your time with this one!

This was so easy!  Instead of cooking the chicken on the skillet, I put chicken tenders in a pan and sprinkled with black pepper, salt and butter...then put it right into the oven.  While the chicken baked (about 20mins), I prepared the sauce.  When the chicken was done I put it into the sauce and let it absorb the flavor. I also used fat-free half and half instead and it still tasted awesome.  Even better the next day.

Didn't specify kind of champagne or sweetness. I used brut (no sweetness)it still was good but not much flavor. I would recommend semi sweet.

I made this last night, and it was delicious.  I didn't have any flour, so I omitted it, and didn't miss it.  I put salt and pepper on the breasts about 2 hours before I was ready to cook them, and put them back in the fridge.  I also added a clove of garlic to the oil before cooking the chicken.  I cut the chicken into smaller pieces before I cooked (I only had a small pan), used about 3 cups of mushrooms, and only about 1/2 cup of cream.  I thickened the sauce just before I served it with a little bit of cornstarch.  Long story short, my boyfriend loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

I removed the cream and browned the chicken with 1 slice of white onion chopped and 1 tblsp of diced garlic.  It's healthier and it tastes and looks more like brown gravy!

My husband and I love this recipe. He calls it "Drunk Chicken." I do agree it needs a little spicing up if you don't like things bland like I do. I always end up needing more champagne. You do want something on the dry side which will be less sweet.

I took some advise from others and added more seasonings to the chicken.  The champagne I used must have been way too sweet, because it overpowered everything else I mixed in.  I added garlic and onions to the chicken, used a can of cream of mushroom soup, milk and sour cream in place of heavy cream (for more flavor), and it wasn't good.  Husband and kids didn't like how sweet it was.  Don't think I'll make again.

I must say I never follow the recipes, since I like to add extra little things that I think will give more color and flavor, the first time I made it I white white instead of Champagne, and I add garlic and some of green onion to the sauce,and a pinch of parsley.
I made it for Valentine's Day , and my husband loves it, I have to admit this recipe is my favorite.

Yum, that's all I can say.  I didn't find white mushrooms, so I used portabella.  Therefore the sauce was a little, shall we say, gray...  But the flavor was awesome!  It was a little too involved to cook on a regular basis, but I made it for our anniversary and we both enjoyed it.

Just shy of amazing, this is very good! I gave the chicken a rather liberal "dusting" of seasoned flour, which gave a nice thick coating. Since they were still partly frozen, I added some water with the champagne and covered it to keep it simmering longer. Also used plain old 1% milk instead of cream. Delicious! Thank you!

Very easy and delicious. The champagne gives the chicken a light zing. I didn't make the cream sauce, and the chicken was fantastic without it.

This was a very flavorful recipe.  I used pink champange & it gave the chicken a nice flavor.  On the other hand, my cream was a bust.  I added a little champagne to light cream (instead of heavy cream) & I'm not sure if this is why, but it curdled.  I guess if I ever try this recipe again, I'll just dust my chicken in the flour mixture & cook it in champagne because it was just as good.

Made it for V-day and we loved it! I've made it once since then and forgot to leave off the breading. It was definitely better the first time. The breading gets soggy and falls off - I will just skip it next time. I also added more garlic and a few other spices to add flavor to the sauce. Overall its great!

I made this for Valentine's Day for a romantic dinner and I thought it was just OK. My husband really did not like it at all. I used a sweeter champagne like a reviewer suggested and it was too sweet. Maybe that's what ruined it, if you do try it definitely don't use a sweet champagne. I don't think I'll be making this again.

Easy and tasty. I skipped the mushrooms and added a bit more champagne than the recipe called for. I also added some minced garlic to the oil before sauteing the chicken breasts.

This recipe is not good.  The chicken was rubbery and had no taste... neither did the sauce which had the consistancy of water.

This is wonderful!  It's my husband's all-time favorite!  I didn't use mushrooms and I made my own cream from butter and milk.  Sooo good.  I've already made it twice and will be making it for years to come.

This didn't turn out as expected.  I suggest not flouring the chicken before browning, it just got soggy when I added the champagne.  I thought the flavor was a little bland but the husband liked it.  Lastly, the cream never thickened.  It was like milk poured over the chicken, yuk.

As described it was okay. Next I made it with some suggested changes - breaded the chicken breasts, switched up the champagne for a pinot grigio that was semi-dry , changed heavy cream for half and half with a little roux to thicken. To add flavor: before you fry the chicken, toss some chopped pancetta (bacon will work)in the butter and oil till cooked. Remove. Fry chicken. Remove. Add to pan: mushrooms, wine, whole roasted garlic cloves (I used 6-8) cream, cracked black pepper and fresh thyme. Simmer for a half hour. Add pancetta, some scallions.  Serve with asparagus tips and oven roasted cubed potatoes.

Hi, thanks for this great recipe, I cooked it for my boyfriend and we both loved it! I followed some advice from others and omitted dusting chicken with flour and fried the chicken in some garlic. I also added mixed herbs, chicken seasoning & a pimento to add colour and more taste...served on saffron basmati rice...divine! Will definitely cook this again! =)

Good--I followed the advice of some of the others here....I would definitely recommend using only 1 cup of cream instead of 2, and adding some minced garlic to the chicken while browning to help bring out the flavor. Like some others here, I also added just a splash of champagne to the cream as I was heating it.

Very disappointing recipe. It was very lacking in flavour. Would suggest adding a finely chopped onion, garlic and fresh chopped parsley for starters. The consistancy of the sauce however was very nice. Not too runny or too thick. With some changes it could be a great little dish.

I made this for Valentines, and me and my husband enjoyed it so much. I took some tips from others whom had wrote. It was one of the best dishes I had ever cooked, and my husband agreed.

Yummy but I thought the sauce was a little runny. Would have been better if it thickened up some.

It was excellent and very easy to make.  I used some scallion to brown the chicken with the oil for extra flavor.

I made this chicken as a Valentine's Dinner.  I thought the name sounded romantic on the menu!!!  But more importantly, it was GREAT!  My date and I both loved it and enjoyed leftovers too!

Oh, you have to try this recipe.  I used a sweet Champagne and it was one of the best chicken recipes I've done recently.  Believe me--my family is hard to please and they loved this sweet, tasty chicken.  I would venture to say that if you didn't like it, you didn't do it right.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

easy and quick -- tastes just like the devine dish our local Italian restaurant makes.  Suggest serving with a side of angle hair pasta.

I put this meal together last minute & my husband absolutely loved it!  I think what really made the difference in the sauce was using a sweet champagne instead of a 'brut'!  I'll definately make this for guests & be will be happy to share the recipe when they ask for it!  I know they will!

This dish is easy, fast, elegant and delicious.  I made this on Valentine's night, and it was a hit! My boyfriend said it was the best chicken he's ever had!!  I used twice the mushrooms (about 6 cups - we love mushrooms) and that added more flavor to the sauce.  I also added a tablespoon of dried onion and just a pinch of sugar.  Excellent flavor.  I added a few pimentos over the chicken when serving for color.

A good basic recipe.  I floured the chicken and lightly browned.  I removed from pan.  I then sauteed half an onion and the mushrooms until soft.  I added the champagne and cooked for about 10 minutes.  I then added the chicken back and cooked 10 additional minutes.  I removed the chicken once again, then added 1 tablespoon of sherry, 1 teaspoon of tarragon, and only about 1/2 cup of cream.  I then added the chicken back for about 5 minutes.  Served with brown rice.  It was very good.  I truly don't think you need more cream.

I made this chicken dish for New Years Eve and while it was good, I found it a little disappointing.  I followed the directions to a "T", no initial changes however, after tasting the sauce sever times, the sauce to me was bland.  Only then did I add garlic powder and a bit of granulated chicken bouillon and then it finally tasted great.  Before that, it was just a cream sauce without a lot of taste.  I had this dish before at a Italian restaurant and fell in love with it, but something was just missing.  I did add salt & pepper to the flour as well so it should have been seasoned right.  We had it over spinach fettuccine and my hubby and son loved it.  I will make it again, just don't know why the sauce fell flat.

Tasted similar to chicken marsala. I used corn starch to thicken the sauce and used twice as much mushrooms and capers.

Great recipe.  Added a sliced up clove of garlic when warming up the olive oil.  I did read the other reviews about doubling up the cream sauce and I only doubled the champagne.  I had a sweet champagne, use a dry.  If you like mushrooms, use more!

Well, for one thing, though I do find the tips for modifications quite helpful, let's review the actual posted recipe! Resubmit your modified version!
I was excited to try this- sounded good & easy. I was a bit concerned about cooking the chicken in the champagne for 1/2 hour. OK, I should have been better about checking on it, but my end result was chicken that was badly burned on the bottom!! I scraped off the blackness in attempt to salvage the meal, but it was still just OK.
I think I'll try it again anyway, being more attentive, and lessening the time/ temp.

Loved this, we used to get it when we catered and it takes so good. I added a little more champagne and salt , to taste.
