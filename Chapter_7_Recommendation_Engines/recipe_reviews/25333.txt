Whoa - watch the sodium on this recipe as it's written.  I used 1 lb dry black beans instead of 4 cans, which seems about the right amount and cuts the sodium exponentially.  It turned out very well, both the flavor and thickness/texture - this one's a keeper.

This is one of the only soups I've made that I actually looked forward to eating, due to its heartiness (I've only made "thin" veggie soups prior). This is a great recipe! I used 3 carrots instead of 2 and no celery because I didn't have any. I used 1 bag of fresh black beans which I cooked instead of canned. The chili powder and cumin MAKE this recipe I think, it adds a delicious Mexican flavor. I will definitely be making this again, thanks!

When I went to the pantry for ingredients, I found only low-sodium chicken broth, not vegetable broth.  I also substituted frozen corn, as I don't care for the flavor or texture of canned.  I drained and rinsed the black beans to reduce the sodium content.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly with seasoning amounts, etc.  My husband loved it.  He likes the Six Can Tortilla Soup (with a few alterations) from this site better, but it was still a thumbs up from a guy raised on meat and potatoes.  I served with a garnish of sliced green onions and warm corn muffins.  Yum!

Yum!!! Great recipe and so easy!! :)
I used 2 cans of beans instead of 4 for the whole recipe, same amount of celery,onion and carrots.. I browned them then added 2 cups of water, the beans, corn and some veggie soup stock.. Then mashed the remaining can of beans with the tomato and added it in... I used a tbsp of each chili and cumin and it was great!! My family enjoyed it very much.. Will be making this again and again....

Excellent soup!  Much better than some restaurants' versions.  I had to make some substitutes (a can of tomato puree and water for the whole tomatoes, a can of peas for the corn, and chopped bell pepper instead of celery) but it still tasted delicious.  I served it with an experimental vegan cornbread, which turned out to be absolutely delicious.  I'm submitting it to all recipes as "Quick and Easy Vegan Cornbread".

Really liked this! Super easy -- I threw everything in the crock pot. It was the perfect dinner to come home to on a cold night. My vegan daughter sprinkled corn chips on hers, and ate two big bowls. Thanks for the recipe.

EXCELLENT!  My wife loves black bean soup and I made this and it is the best she's had anywhere.  I did go with 1 TBS chili powder and 1/2 TBS cumin and a pinch of cayenne.  I'd increase the cayenne next time for a bit more heat.  I used canned vegetable stock which is just fine.  I wound up adding approximately 2-3 cans (4-6 cups).  Just add to your desired consistency.  Donâ€™t even try to puree the tomato/bean mix in your blender---go with your processor.  I rinsed all the black beans but dumped the corn in undrained.  This soup is highly recommended and a meal in itself!

Just made this for dinner tonight.  Delicious.  I doubled the carrots and celery it called for.  I noticed some reviews said it was too salty, so I made sure to drain and rinse all the canned ingredients and added salt to taste at the end.  I had about 8oz of firm tofu sitting in my fridge so I cubed it up and threw it in.  When I served the soup I sprinkled a teaspoon of Nutritional Yeast on top.  Nutritional Yeast gives the soup a great cheesy flavor and is great for vegans because it gives you B12 which is usually found in animal sources!!

This is very good! I ran out of chili powder, so used a bit less than 1 tblsp. so also went a bit less on the cumin in an attempt to maintain the balance of flavors. Consequently I thought it needed a bit more spice, but my husband thought it was spicy enough. We will definitely be eating this again (likely with a bit more spice). Weight Watchers--4 points per cup is the way it worked out for me.

I am eating this soup as we speak, and I really like it.  I was kind of scared, but it turned out great.  The flavor is good.  I used organic vegatable broth, used 3 cans of beans instead of 4, and didn't have any cumin.  I agree with some posts that it has a beany taste to it, and can't taste the tomatoes, but it's fixable for next time, I may add 2 cans of beans and 2 of tomatoes.  It looked so good before I blended the beans and tomatoes, so I think it would work even without blending them, if you like chunky.  All in all, it's a quick, hot, satisfying soup, especially on this snowy, wintery night!  Thanks for sharing!  I'm going for seconds right now!

It is good but I do watch my sodium intake so I never buy prepared foods. I have a stock pot going at all times so I do not have to buy stock. I make my own beans from scratch, too. All is easy if one just makes the time for it and that is easy if one is prepared. I am a vegan because food is my medicine and if I'm buying prepared foods I'm defeating that purpose. I am 80 years old, an artist and have a full-time job. I had to change my ways when I developed cardiac vascular disease. Yes, I used to eat everthing out of a can and I brought four children up that way. I hadn't even heard of vegetarians fifty years ago. I started watching what I ate nearly thirty years ago and even then I didn't know what a vegan was. One can learn.
  These recipes are good. Just do your own thing while following the directions.

First time making this recipe so I halved the ingredients just in case it wasn't a big hit as many reviewers posted. I adjusted the spices to our tastes, left out celery since it's been banned from our house, and added some of the tomato to the soup before blending the can (to give some more texture). The soup is good, but not amazing. Maybe some different chilies/peppers would put it above the rest. Still, needed quite a bit of tweaking, so 3 stars for the recipe as is. I served it with polenta wedges which were a good compliment.

Best. Soup. Ever. The only thing I do differently from the recipe is substitute cooked rice for the corn. It makes a complete protein (rice and beans) and a satisfying meal with a salad and crusty bread.

I made this last night and it was wonderfull (even my picky, meat eating husband loved it).  I only used one tablespoon of chili powder, 3 cans of broth and two cans of black beans (I didn't drain the beans or the corn).  Then in the blender I mixed a can of pinto beans and half of a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes.  Not wanting to waste food, I threw the rest of the tomatoes in to the soup.  It tasted great with a big chunk of dark bread.  Does make a LOT of soup though, might want to halve the recipe next time.

This is a tasty hearty soup without the calories, makes a lot, and freezes well.  The recipe says to saute the onion, celery, carrots and garlic for 5 minutes and then cook for 15 min. My chopped carrots needed more time to cook. Next time I will chop all the vegetables smaller to cook in this time frame. I also had to add quite a bit of pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent hearty soup!  1st time I made it I thought it need some zing to it so I added 2 tsp of hot pepper sauce.  2nd time I made it I added 1Tbs of lime juice & 3 tsp hot sauce.  Freeze very well, and I always have some on hand in the freezer.

Very colorful soup!  I only used two cans of black beans and did not bother to puree / blend anything.  I also added in some kale, which provided some great texture to the soup.  It was nice and chunky!  Next time, I would serve with a dollop of yogurt.

Great recipe as is. I left out the corn.Added cooked cubed chicken breast, and fresh kale the last 3 minutes(to retain crispness). Served w/garlic toast. Very filling and tasty.

This is a great base recipe. I've since changed it by starting with just over a pound of dried beans, adding an extra onion, 1 more celery stalk, a whole head of garlic, Tony Chachere's as a sub for black pepper, beef broth for the vegetable, dropped the corn and added a fresh hot chile (or 2) and a 7 oz. can of chopped green chiles. For the meat loving hubby, I have added turkey kielbasa at the end. My husband and son (5) LOVE this and they will even eat leftovers. Believe me when I say it's good, because they never like to do that!

This is now a monthly staple in our home. We have six members in our family. Half are vegetarian and half are not. This is heaven sent as it satisfies everyone and there are plenty of leftovers for dad's lunch. 

My only modification is that I add a can of green chilies to spice up the flavor a bit. We are not vegan so I top with shredded cheese and sour cream. 

I also top with tortilla strips. I cut white corn tortillas into thin strips, fry til crispy then season with Lawry's. So simple but so good. They really compliment this wonderful recipe.

1/8/2012: I did NOT make this as listed, so this review is just for myself. I used 2 tsp of oil, sauted the 1/2 onion, 2 stalks celery, 1 clove garlic and 2 carrots along with 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp oregano up for at least 5 min; added 1 can low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 can water, 2 cans black beans (I was no sodium).  Bring to boil, simmer for 20 min.  puree at least 1/2 and mix back into the pot.
Feb 2016: made with spices as listed, half a large onion, 1 stalk celery, 2 Carrots,  1 carton chicken stock, 3 cans black beans and forgot the tomato - still tasty!  Blended half.  Very forgiving recipe.

I used more garlic, upped the carrot amount some, and added fresh cilantro just before serving, but otherwise stuck pretty close the the recipe. It turned out well and paired nicely with a loaf of Ciabatta bread.

Excellent soup, both my husband and I loved it and the leftovers the next day were even better. I left out the corn and added a second can of diced tomatoes, used chicken broth instead of vegtable broth. This one is a keeper.
I made this a second time with the corn and vegetable broth. The corn just didn't seem to be cooked well enough in the twenty minutes...so add more simmer time. I make my own broth, but still like the chicken broth flavor better. Topped with some avocados...yum yum!

I am a black bean soup junkie.  This is by far best I've ever tasted and ever made.  I am also a crockpot junkie.  I did not change any ingredients but I did change the cooking method to accommodate a slow cooker.  First, I sautÃ©ed all of the veggies in a skillet with the olive oil and chili powder.  I put this into the bottom of the crockpot first.  Then I added the wet ingredients, beans and other spices.  Stirring occasionally, I set it for 8 hours on low.  

Since I am the primary vegan eater in the house I like to cook in bulk so I can eat for a week without worrying about what to cook for myself.  This recipe was fed me lunch and some dinners for a week.  I did not get tired of eating it.  

The best thing I liked about this recipe was that the soup was not too thick or too thin.  I like the thickness of the broth that I usually can only find in canned black bean soup.  In other recipes the broth is too thin.  In the words of Goldilocks "this is just right."  Thanks for sharing this recipe! The only other black bean soup I can compare this to is Panera's black bean soup.  I thought this recipe was by far the superior.

Gearing ourselves to a healthier eating lifestyle. Found this recipe while googling. Fabulous!!!  My husband and son (both meat and taters men) loved it. You may need to tweak the recipe a little. I used dried beans and added salt to taste to cut down on the sodium. Next time gonna try frozen corn. Should give it a fresher taste. Served with cornbread on the side. Great pairing. Looking forward to trying other vegan recipes.

I made this (with the vegan corn muffins) as an appitizer for an all vegan mex themed meal. It was way better than the main dish.
 I made a few changes. I use diced tomatoes, my grocer doesn't carry the right size cans of crushed, I rinsed the two cans of beans that got pured to lower the sodium and upped the ammount of spice along with a few extras (cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper).
 (The non-vegans) topped the bowls off with some chedder, finishing touch, yum!

This would have been 5 stars had it had some spiciness to it.  I added a can of mild Ro-Tel which did the trick.  I also used 1 lb. of black beans and the water in which I had cooked them along with 1 large vegetable bouillon cube.  I would make this again.

This recipe is fabulous.  I had a taste for black bean soup but didn't want to spend a lot of time nor have to do a lot of grocery shopping on my way home.  This was simple and super delicious.  I did use the 3 cups of broth rather than the 4 called for in the recipe as suggested by one of the raters.

We made this while in Spain and therefore didn't have any chili powder!  But, even before seasoning it had excellent flavor.  We did make some changes:
We used 2 cans of pinto beans and 2 cans of kidney beans, doubled the garlic, added anaheim and bell pepper, used a little tabasco to make up for the chili powder and garnished with cilantro (home-grown, cause you can't find that here either!).  The boyfriend said that if he could get his face in the bowl he would lick it clean. :)

The initial draw of this recipe was ease and inexpensiveness--and it WAS both easy and inexpensive. Plus, for being so easy and easy on the pocketbook, very tasty. As others have mentioned, the sodium in the canned goods can be a concern, so I used low/no salt canned goods only and added no salt (now I can only imagine that all that additional salt would make it practically inedible). I also didn't have a can of corn so used a no-salt added can of mixed veggies instead. Finally, because I hope to share it with vegetarian friends, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

Awesome! Absolutely Awesome!  We ate 2quarts of it the first Night, and there are only two of us!  I use a slow cooker - just doing the onion, garlic, and carrots in the skillet in oil first and then tossing the rest in the crock.  It comes out sooooo yummy! We add salt - it's the only thing I think is missing.  I cut the chili powder just a bit, because we don't really like much bite (yeah we're wimpy) but even where we made the changes, were only personal preference type stuff - this recipes is 99%perfect as is - but I Really think it Needs salt - start at 1tsp and work up to taste

I thought this was only "okay".  It needed more flavor in my opinion, maybe more garlic or some spicy peppers.  I added about a tablespoon of Thai chili sauce and more chili powder and it still wasn't spicy enough.  It made a ton of soup, so if I ever make it again I would halve the recipe.  I probably won't make it again, though.

Big hit at an extended family dinner - we had a vegan guest and we wanted her to feel welcome.  It is delicious, with just enough oomph to make it interesting.  Highly recommended - a hearty way to get your protein and veggies!

Outstanding--healthy, hearty, and full of flavor. The corn adds a nice textural element as well. I served this as a main course with French bread and baby arugula and it was a hit.  I recommend using reduced-sodium or no-salt-added beans and corn and correcting seasoning only at the very end.

Sorry, but I really didn't like this one.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it was way too "beany."  The spices were unexceptional, almost bland, and I couldn't taste the tomatoes or anything else but bean.  The recipe made a ton, and I threw almost all of it away.  Two stars for health and convenience, though.

This recipe is wonderful, and very healthy, too!  I added extra garlic and onion, because they're so good for you.  Having the beans and the corn both in this soup is great, because it provides you with a complete protein.  I sprinkled a little bit of cheddar on top, and added a 1/2 tablespoon of sour cream to mine, and it was GREAT.

This was wonderful!  Everyone in my family really liked it.  I added 2 tsp salt to this and I added a cup of brown rice.  Made it a little thicker so we served it  on flour tortillas as burritoes.  It was really great!  Thanks so much for this recipe :)

I think this is a great base recipe, but one I'll have to amend slightly in the future.  My issue is with the amount of spices.  Don't get me wrong, I love some chili powder and cumin as much as the next person, but I found it a bit overpowering.  It was very hard to taste any individual ingredients!  Next time I think I'll halve (at least) the powdered spices and opt for some finely minced habanero or jalapeno instead.  Or, and call me crazy here, a little salt?  Granted, I used dried beans as opposed to canned, so I avoided that sodium, but I was still rather surprised to see a soup without any salt at all.  Hence the over-reliance on powdered spices for flavoring.  I think it would be just as effective to get a little bit of the spice flavor in there while still accentuating the natural flavor of the beans, onion, corn, and tomatoes.  Just my two cents.

Great base recipe.  I did make some adjustments to what I had on hand.  I used garlic broth instead of vegetable, two cans of black beans with jalapeno and pureed two cans of pinto beans since I was out of black beans.  Since I had seasoned black beans I left out the other spices except for a little cumin.  It was one of the best soups I have ever had!

DELICIOUS!  I took the suggestion of one of the reviews and used a pound of dry black beans instead of the canned beans to cut down on the salt.  I didn't puree any of the beans either.  This was such a simple recipe, I was shocked by how tasty it was.

Perfect consistency. 
Topped with fresh tomatoes and cornbread.
My southern husband thought it was delicious.
My picky son at it up.

A good hearty soup.  I doubled the recipe and it called for 1/4 cup of chili powder.  WAY TOO MUCH!  I'll make it again and gradually add the chili powder to taste.

This was amazing!  I had never made black bean soup, and it was extremely easy.  I didn't have any celery so made it without.  Also, because I have small children, I cut down on the chili powder (1/2).  Everyone (except for my picky 3 year old who eats nothing but tomato pie and pb&j) devoured it!!  Wonderful recipe!!

I changed some things around. I soaked 1/2lb of dry black beans, didn't have any celery, and added frozen corn instead. I also added some green chillies. It came out nice and thick after cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Good soup.

Added a splash of lime juice and hot pepper sauce for more flavor since I found this soup bland.  It is an okay soup but not great.

I was trying to use up some things, so didn't follow recipe exactly, but kept most of the measurements proportionate to original. I ended up playing around with it a bit until it was to my liking -- a splash of malt vinegar, a pinch of cilantro and oregano, a teaspoon or two of chinese mustard -- then crunched up tortilla chips for the topping. It was delicious! Hearty! Wonderful! Thanks for the ideas!

I just finished making this dish and I'm eating it now.  This really is a good bowl of soup.  The fact that it has a lot of vegetables in it makes me happy.  This smells so very much like chili but has a very smooth texture  along with some of the crunch from the corn.  Over all a spectacular soup.  Will definitely make again.

Mine turned out to be almost like a vegetarian chili, that's what it reminded us of. It was delicious eaten with tortilla chips. I only pureed one of the cans of beans, and drained and rinsed the other three. I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of veggie broth. Thank you for a delicious recipe.

I am a vegetarian and this recipe has long been one of my favorites.  I usually make it in the slow cooker and find it's just as good that way.  This is a great cold-weather recipe.

This is a very tasty soup and will definitely make it again but with only 1 Tablespoon chili powder as it is quite spicy. I drained the beans and corn but not sure if this is necessary as the soup is quite thick.

I make Friday night dinner every week for family consisting of vegetarians and non-vegetarians. This recipe passed the test with both groups. I thought there would be too much cumin and chili powder. Somehow all of the spices seem to combine wonderfully and we did not find it too spicy. Thanks, Christine, we will make it again!

Absolutely delicious! although please note when they say 1 stalk of celery i think they mean only one rib! i used 2 ribs and it was more than enough. the corn added a bit of sweetness which i wouldn't use next time. the soup is a quick black bean soup recipe that tastes like it took forever! will definitely make this again!

My roommates loved this soup! One quote: "This soup has so many layers of flavors - it's excellent." 

One comment though, if you're reheating a bowl the next day, be certain to make it nice and hot. For some reason, the leftover soup tastes bland when it's only slightly warmed up.

Not a soup I will make again. Apart from draining/rinsing the beans (are we supposed to use them with the liquid? Did YCHRISTINE just assume we would do the usual drain and rinse?)I made the recipe as written and found the end result fairly tasteless. I then added another 14 oz of crushed tomatoes, a bit more veg broth, fresh lemon juice, dried oregano and a handful of fresh parsley which made the soup a bit more palatable but a different recipe altogether. On the plus side, this recipe is economical and can feed a lot of people.

I loved this soup!! And so did my 5 year old twins which is a major plus!!! I changed a couple things...i used dry beans intend of canned and i used a 28oz can of the tomato puree, i also added a whole sweet potato chopped up and sautÃ©ed those with the other vegis. Came out great and would totally make it again. I cooked it all in a dutch oven.

I doubled the recipe, thinking that six servings wasn't enough for 5 adults and 2 kids....we will be eating soup for days to come!  But that's okay, because it was delicious!  I had to add salt, maybe because I used low sodium broth, but my guests did not.

This was easy to make with few ingredients to put together. I didn't follow the second step but it still came out delicious (I'm sure it only makes the consistency thicker so depending on what you prefer but next time I'll be sure to blend the remaining two cans of beans together along with the tomato).

i just needed something quick and hot to make ... i did a lot of subbing and adjustments of flavours according to what i had on hand, and didn't puree, and the result was lovely. i think this is a really great, forgiving recipe.

Very good and very easy! I used a lime infused olive oil but would have liked to spritz a little fresh lime for that added kick. I didn't use celery b/c I didn't have any. I used by blender since I haven't bought a food processor yet and it worked fine. Paired mine with the (amazing) vegan cornbread agave muffins from this site. Can't wait for my leftovers tomorrow!!

I skipped the black bean puree and substituted two cans of diced tomatoes in its place. Very delicious and just the right amount of beans; not too overpowering.

Really good! I used dried beans (so much cheaper here!) and at the last minute realized I lost my can opener (?!?) so had to leave out the corn & tomatoes. It was still fantastic.  The seasoning needs a bit of tweaking it's a very mild soup. I think spicy would be better.

I used frozen corn and dried beans to reduce the salt and keep it "fresher." I found the soup to have a similar taste to chili. It was good and filling, but I won't be scrambling to make another pot.

Great!  Easy!  Flavorful!  I found it a little odd that some reviewers found this soup "a little beany".  Hmmm...Black Bean Soup right?

Really, really good recipe. I used frozen peas because canned peas are gross and salty. I rinsed the black beans to get rid of some of the extra sodium. I also doubled the carrots and celery. And I added a couple more cloves of garlic because we love garlic! 

I made some gluten free corn bread with this and it was one amazing meal! I've used this recipe twice this week because my family loved it so much.

The recipe was easy enough for my boyfriend who is just starting cooking to make it.

We really liked this soup!

This soup had a very good flavor.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to modify for what I had in the fridge/garden.  I didn't have celery, carrots or canned beans.  I soaked and cooked bagged beans as directed and when cooked, I followed the recipe.  

In a separate pan I sauteed the onion and zucchini and then added to the beans with the remaining ingredients.  I also substituted fresh tomatoes for the canned.

This is fantastic! I love it, my husband loves it, even my 2 year old son thinks it's great! The only thing I did differently was sing tomato paste instead of the crushed tomatoes, and I just barely mashed it with the black beans for a chunkier consistancy. Absolutely delicious!

My husband and I just had this for dinner. It is one of the best soups I have ever made!  I was using a previous black bean soup with ground beef for the crock pot.  This one blows it away and it is even healthier!  I used a suggestion from another reviewer and crumbled tortilla chips on top.  I used artisan black bean and garlic chips.  It sent it over the top for me.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for posting this recipe!!

My first time making it. It came out great. Several in the group asked for the receipe. Another review suggested adding kale, and I imagine that would work too. Again, it was very, very, good. 5 Stars from me.
(I'm not a vegetarian btw)

I found that the tbs. of cumin and the 2 tbs. of chili powder were too much. It gave the soup a slight bitter taste. Other than that, a GREAT recipe!!

GREAT soup!! I wasn't 100% sure if I was to drain the beans or corn because it never said to or not. So I drained the corn and 2 cans of beans that went into the processor.It was fine. Not to watery. LOVE this and will make it again soon!!

A really quick easy soup! I had to make some changes because i made it last minute. I used frozen corn instead of canned, didn't have any cummin :(, and i used fresh crushed tomatoes (hand crushed them) and added in a can of green chiles. My boyfriend and i loved it.

We loved this soup.  Even my nephew who does little cooking asked for the recipe.  I soaked black beans (total of 8 cups soaked ), blended only 2 cups instead of 4 cups, and used 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, because that was all I had.  We loved this and will make again.  Perfect for our low fat and low cholesterol family.  Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful soup!  This is easy to make, with ingredients I usually have on hand.  Pureeing the beans and tomatoes BEFORE adding them to the pot simplifies things, too -- I like this better than ladling hot soup in and out of the blender.  The flavor and texture are exactly right.  We make this one again and again!

May want to mention that the many canned items should be drained. If not, it comes out terrible. I will try this again drained.

I really liked this recipe. Looking at the recipe, it seemed a little bland, so I added a bit of smoked paprika and oregano and increased the other spices. It was so yummy with some sour cream and toasted tortilla triangles. However my boyfriend was not so enthused :(

While this was really good, there were some things I would change.  I like a more chunky soup so I only used one cup of broth instead of four.  I also blended up one can of black beans instead of two.  The cumin and chili powder were a little overpowering so I added a few sprigs of fresh cilantro and 2 Tbsp canned green chilies.

Overall, this is delicious! I skipped the carrots, celery and onions--as a previous reviewer said, they don't really fit in a Southwestern-style soup, I don't think. I added a little cilantro, too. A great soup!

We didn't care for the carrots in this soup, but otherwise thought it was delicious.  When I make it again, I'll eliminate the carrots and probably the celery...they just didn't fit in this southwestern soup.  I halved the recipe, but still used a full can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion.  I drained the liquid from the whole beans that I added to the soup, but left the liquid in for the blended part.

This soup has become a "go to" recipe for me...I can't find anyone who doesn't like it! My 6 and 3 year olds love it, my picky sister-in-law loves it, my meat eating hubby loves it, I love it. I don't change a thing and usually double the recipe, and never have any left.

I followed the recipe closely, and this soup was just bland. It needed more spices and the veggies were still a little crunchy. Next time (if I even tried it again) I would simmer for at LEAST 20 mins, if not more.

This was VERY good.  I am not a vegan so I added some cheddar cheese on top.  It was so delicious all the way through!  I will make this again many times.

I thought this was great! I was a little worried it would be a little too bland, but the natural flavors of the soup were really good...although if you like things salty, you might want to add just a little salt to it.

I didn't add celery since I didn't have any, but basically followed the recipe exactly. Very easy and very good!

My husband and I both enjoyed the recipe. Anyone from Arizona or New Mexico could use tomatos with green chilies in it. It won't be too hot for them.

This soup is wonderful!!  I actually cooked this in the crockpot.  When I got to this step in the recipe - "reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes." I put it in the crockpot on low for about 4 hours.  The veggies still had a crunch to them.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese (cause I'm not vegan :-)) and served it w/ whole wheat bread.  Loved it!!  Thanks!

This is hearty and very tasty, plus healthful for you, too!  It had just the right amount of spice and zip for my taste.  I'm so glad I tried it!  Here are my minor changes/additions:  Instead of canned corn, I used 3/4's of a bag of frozen shoe peg corn (I just threw it in, frozen)  Also, because I love lots of "stuff" in my soup, I added an extra chopped carrot, one 14-1/2 oz can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes, breaking the tomatoes in half into the soup so there'd be chunks of tomatoes, and two cups of cooked brown rice.  Shortly after adding the rice, the rice plumped up even more, unfortunately, soaking up some of the soup broth.  Next time, I will add just one cup of cooked brown rice, so as not to absorb so much of the broth.  Finally, I also added 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro.

I am a vegetarian... my parents are die-hard carnivores. Naturally, cooking for each other is difficult. I made this recipe for them and they both loved it... didn't even miss the meat. I left out the celery (yuck) and added some cooked white rice, which my father said thickened it nicely. Makes great leftovers.

This is great! It really is more like a chili; it's very hearty. I used a small food chopper to blend the beans, and it worked fine. I don't like celery very much so I used zuchini (sp?) which turned out very tasty.

Fantastic recipe - so easy, healthy and incredibly flavorful.  The only thing I changed was the broth - we didn't have any veggie broth on hand, so I used beef broth instead.  I also cut back from what the recipe calls for to keep it thick and hearty.  My husband really liked it, but said it tasted more like chili than black bean soup - may pump up the cumin and halve the chili powder next time around.  Would be fantastic with corn bread.  This will be a household staple - thanks!

The soup was great - I divided it up and froze it for take-to-work suppers.  The amount of chili powder was not too much (in my opinion), but of course, it's all a matter of taste.  It's very, very quick to make, and I'll certainly use this one again - making only one change: adding some rice to thicken it up.

I altered the seasonings to 1/2 of the chili powder and cumin and it was just right.  My son even asked me to make it again...even though we are not vegans.  This is really a great soup!!!

I liked it better than my husband did.  It makes quite a bit so I froze a couple of containers.  I used 3 cans of vegetable broth which was more than the 4 cups listed in the recipe.  I just didn't want to throw away half of the broth in a can & didn't have another recipe I was going to make soon with vegetable broth.  I thought it still had a rich taste.  It took me a while to blend the 2 cans of beans & tomatoes in my blender as the mixture was quite thick.  I had to stop the blender several times to stir the mixture with a wooden spoon & get some of the blended part up from the bottom before I got it to a smoother consistency.  Oh, besides the chopping & blending, the most work was in recycling 9 cans :)!

Very good and easy. The whole family ate it up. I didn't add as many cans of beans as the recipe called for.Used frozen corn. There were so many good things in it I only added one can of Black Beans and one can of garbonzos. I crushed the garbonzos but didn't puree anything. It still fed 5!

My husband made this for me for dinner tonight and it was excellent!  It wasn't too spicy - perfect! It made a lot of soup.  We had it with corn chips and french bread.  My 20 month old didn't like it, but I didn't expect her to anyway.  Thanks for this excellent recipe.

I tripled the recipe to have lots of leftovers. I found this soup 
too spicy. Otherwise it was a good recipe and next time will
be cutting back on the chili powder and cumin.

Only changes I made were- spices 3/4 what was called for in recipe. Took carrot and 1 can black beans per 4 cups and pureed with some of the veggie broth and pureed to add thickness without using flour or cornstarch.
Spices were perfectly balanced. will make again.

Very good soup. Iâ€™ve made this several times. I made it exactly as written except for adding one jalapeÃ±o because I like things spicy. The soup is thick so the second time I made it I used half of the purÃ©ed beans so the soup would be less thick and use the leftover beans as a dip.

Excellent but tastes more like chili to me. Used dry beans like others to cut sodium. Soaked them overnight. Also substituted about 1/4 cup chopped small red/orange/yellow peppers because I didnâ€™t have green peppers on hand. Then made as directed but simmered for a few hours to soften the beans. Thought it needed a little kick at the end so added about a 1/4 cup chopped jalapeÃ±os and a little brine from the jar, as well as a few dashes of cayenne. It was delicious, hardy, and just the right amount of spice.

Made this over the weekend, and my husband actually told me it is probably one of the best soups I have ever made - and we are soup people, I make a lot of soup!  I kind of thought he was overreacting, but I am sitting  here right now enjoying my second day of having this soup for lunch, and he is right.  It is really, really good.   My co-workers are all asking whose lunch smells so good.    I can't wait to make another batch!

I had forgot to put in the garlic (places hand on forehead) but it still turned out great! I did add a packet of Sazon, some Adobo, a touch of cayenne pepper, sea salt, and topped with avocado. My husband loved it!

I have made this soup many times and it is delicious! My only suggestion is to add bell pepper (aka capsicum).

Excellent flavor but woe for the sodium. 1734 mg of sodium for one serving is more than the recommended 1500 mg of sodium for those 50 yrs and older for 1 day! I made this with dried beans (cooked and drained) and homemade stock. You can also use low sodium can beans, broth, and can tomatoes. Making some changes can reduce the sodium down to a healthy 250 mg or less per serving.

Great and simple recipe!  I didn't put onions in because my wife is allergic to onions. I used 1TBL of dried onion flakes instead of.  Will be making this again.

I made this soup for my Spanish husband, and he really liked it!  I like the fact that we get a lot of nutrition packed inside this soup. It tastes like black bean soup, and yet it has all that nutrition inside!

Made as written and felt there was too much liquid. Next time I'll drain some, if not all, of the beans. I ended up draining some of the liquid off the completed dish and was left with 8 servings.

I made this for a friend who doesn't eat meat.   It tastes so yummy I'll be making it again for my husband and I!   Easy to make.  I would add chopped cilantro and avacado on top as a garnish.

I've made this recipe for years and my whole family enjoys it.  The only changes that I make is that I use frozen corn instead of canned and I add some chopped yellow, orange, or red sweet pepper.  It does make more than 6 servings though.  I would estimate 8-10 servings.

I've made this twice, once following the recipe (minus the corn because I didn't have any) - it was simple and delicious!!
the second time I added swiss chard which changed it quite a bit, but was just as yummy.
I love how versatile this recipe is! I give it a few zaps with the hand blender rather than separating the ingredients. So good!!!

The only change I made was to omit the corn. Not defending myself, but I do have a phobic aversion to corn kernels mixed in food. Corn on the cob? Great. Pass it. Corn off the cob, sprinkled in my food? Nuh-uh. Pass on it. I think it has to do with the corn fritters Mom made when I was a kid. Finding my way around the corn chunks and golden raisins was enough frustration for one lifetime. So, no corn in my soup. For those of you whose moms maybe also ruined their lives with corn fritters, I can honestly say that this soup is awesome without it. In fact, the lack of corn may specifically enhance your enjoyment of it. I give you permission to do that.

Easy and good as is!  I didn't make any adjustments and it was very good.  (Well, I did skip the blender part of the directions so I guess that's an adjustment, but it's the easiest kind of adjustment!)

Amazing! Unfortunately when I went into the refrigerator for celery it was bad, so I made it with an extra carrot instead. The spice was definitely present, but not overpowering. Still, I might use maybe a teaspoon or so less chili powder next time. Finally, I also changed this recipe by adding a diced Roma tomato in addition to the purÃ©ed can of them in order to add some texture besides the beans. This recipe is going in my rotation for sure.

Tasty recipe.  I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable and based on some of the other reviews I rinsed the beans to reduce the sodium. I had no problem with that all. Very easy to make would probably make it again.

loved this recipe! It serves a lot of people and it's hearty. I added more carrots and celery than called for and next time I make I'll be adding more corn. The cumin and chili powder make this recipe happen. Serve with a loaf of artisan bread and you've got a great meal.

The taste was OK, but thick and hearty this is not. Cut the vegetable broth by half and it would be better. The cooking time is also much longer than listed for the vegetables to cook thoroughly.

I would definitely recommend using 1 16oz bag of dry beans for this. I made it both ways and it's better than using canned.

I really enjoyed this soup!  My go-to black bean soup meal was always Amy's because every recipe I tried just didn't cut the mustard, but this one is pretty solid.  I made half the recipe to see if I liked it, but made a few adjustments.  First I rinsed the beans to reduce the sodium and used frozen corn instead of canned, because it often contains sweetener.  I always use a little veggie stock to water-sautee the vegetables instead of using oil because you get the exact same result without the added fat, which I got instead from the half avocado I added at the table.  I also added one teaspoon of brown sugar to mellow out the acidity and it worked like a charm!  Since I never miss an opportunity to work in some uber nutrition, I finely chopped two big collard green leaves and added it to the soup during the last five minutes of cooking and they lent themselves REALLY well to this recipe.  They were tender and blended right in with the soup. I finished it off with the aforementioned half an avocado and a generous squeeze of fresh lime juice and vegan jack cheese!!!  Oh, and I thought the spice level was perfect...

This was excellent. If you purchase canned black beans, buy the ones with no sodium, then add a little sea salt to taste. Variation: add a few sun dried tomatoes and/or roasted sweet red peppers before blending.

This soup was ok. Tasty, but more of a "vegetable soup with black beans" than a black bean soup. Not exactly what I had in mind.

Loved it!! I accidentally only used two cans of beans and I added a little Tabanero hot sauce. I've never made a bean soup without meat before. Did not miss it a bit.

This was a great recipe. The changes I made were used reduced sodium black beans and rinsed them. I didn't use the water from the corn, but did add 2 cups of water, 3-4 mini sweet peppers, 7 grape tomatoes, and 1 tomato bullion since I didn't have crushed tomatoes on hand. I will be making this again!

I have made this twice and and everyone who has tried it, absolutely loves it! I omit the cumin (only because I don't care for it).  If you are sodium conscious, you can always use dried beans instead of canned, frozen corn instead of canned and low-sodium broth although, I followed the recipe exactly (except the cumin) and it is amazing!  It freezes well and seems to defrost fairly quickly. This is my new favorite lunch to bring to the office and heat up in the microwave.  I would consider this more of a meal than an appetizer. It is very filling and does hold you a long time. 5+ stars!

Delicious as written, but easy to adjust to what's on hand.  I've made it without the tomatoes and no one even noticed! My usual/favorite way to make this:use dried black beans rather than canned, leave out the corn, add some sweet potato or winter squash and collard greens. I also just use a potato masher rather than blending the beans.  We have this several times a month during the cold weather....my carnivorous sons don't even miss the meat!

Very good!  Made some changes though: Sauteed the veggies in coconut oil instead of olive (I've read olive oil denatures with heat and you lose the nutrition- but coconut oil does not, so it's better to use olive oil in cold dishes and coconut oil when sauteing.) Used homemade free range chicken broth, my own cooked black beans (which I only had about 2 1/2 cups left, so I just put half in the soup and blended half with the tomatoes)I used a lot more celery and carrots, added half a red pepper and half a jalapeno, and threw in a pinch of cayenne pepper, a bay leaf, and a bunch of cilantro as well.  Turned out great!

I think it's a great recipe. I am eating it as we speak. I didn't add celery, cause I hate celery (lol) and didn't have carrots. Instead I quartered slices of zucchini and put that with the onion. I was too lazy to mince all that garlic, so I threw 3 large cloves in the vitamix blender with the beans and tomato. I had left over roasted garlic that I had smashed into paste that I put into the zucchini/onion mixture. I used no salt added or low salt beans and tomatoes, use trader joes frozen roasted corn, and ancho chili powder. I also threw in some coriander for fun, about 1 Tb. I don't know if it made an overall difference though. Anyways, it is delicious! I put a half an avocado on top and am eating away! Oh, and I made sure to rinse all the beans, as I have heard multiple times that what makes you have bad gas is the liquid of the beans in the can. If I drain it off, I don't get super bloat! :)

Loved this recipe!  I omitted the celery because I don't like it.  Also added cayenne pepper for heat.  Also, I chopped up a red pepper and roasted it... I put half in the soup between steps one and two... the other half in the food processor.  Yummmmm

My friend and I just made this fantastic soup -- incredibly delicious, easy, and filling. I would highly recommend this recipe to other college students as this soup is (as aforementioned) very filling, cost-effective, freezes easily, and can be reheated for many meals with your friends or on your own. My only modifications were to add more chili powder, omit the celery, rinse all the beans to remove salt, and to use fire-roasted tomatoes instead of regular ones. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome!  Very easy to make!  I did a few tweaks:  I used a 1 lb (equals 6 cups/4 cans of prepared beans) bag of dried black beans that I steeped in hot water for an hour, 3 small onions, 6 cloves of garlic, 5 carrots, no celery, 14 oz tomato sauce.  I think next time I will only puree 2 cups of black beans with the tomato sauce, soup got too thick & clogged my blender.  Also had to add 2 extra cups of vegetable stock to loosen up the black bean puree.  I will also back off the chili powder a little and keep the celery salt (2 tsp).  I will definately make again!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Hearty, rich, and just right on the spice.  I use 450g of dried beans vs. canned (less sodium, less cost).  Better than any soup from a can and even better when I use veggies from my garden in it!

This is a nice, easy, delicious recipe.  I have made it twice now and think it is wonderful. 
The only change I made was that I added salt at the end to enhance the flavors.
I served this with avocado, green onions, and for the non-vegans manchego cheese.  I would have substituted the manchego with Queso Fresco, a more mild option.  
I had no cilantro, but that would have been a nice addition.

All I can say is WOW!!. This was one of the best Black Bean Soups I have ever had.  Made two minor changes, used dry black beans and just soaked them for a couple of hours plus I only used 1 tablespoon of chili powder.

I give it 4 stars because I alter the recipe a bit, but my family loves the altered version. First, 1 stalk of celery and two carrots is a pitiful excuse for veggies. I double or triple the count at least. I also rinse my beans if they are canned for the sodium content. For the spices, I do 1 Tbsp of chili powder, 1 Tbsp of paprika, and 1 Tbsp of cumin and fresh ground pepper to taste. Still has a lot of flavor, but not as spicy if you have little ones.

This soup is fantastic! After years of vegetarianism, my family and I have gone "Healthy Vegan". My daughter, who seems to have the most hard to please palate claims it is the best soup she has ever eaten, while I find it almost impossible to believe how incredibly flavorful it is without the addition of any salt. I will be making this one again and again and again and again! Thanks for a stellar recipe!

This was pretty good.  I made it mostly as stated just making two small changes.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and I added a little salt to the soup.  It also took way longer than 15 minutes for the vegetables in this soup to cook.  It wasn't mind blowing but this soup was pretty good and was well received by my family.  I do like the fact that it's easy to make and calls for ingredients that most people have on hand.

I LOVE this recipe! I didn't change anything at all and the flavors were perfect! If you like a bit of a kick, I guess you could add a little chipotle powder but honestly it has so much flavor that I didn't think it needed anything. GREAT RECIPE!!

Excellent - really delicious!  I left out the corn, however, and used 1.5 cans of tomatoes. I drained the beans, but not the tomatoes.

This was very tasty! I only had chicken broth so I used that (I know, not vegan but that's ok).  Will definitely use this recipe again and make some of my own tweaks

i made it twice. don't have vegetable soup either time. the first time i used chicken broth (sorry vegans...), and mistakenly added cannaya pepper as chili powder, but the result was great. so i made it a second time, used water as substitute and correctly add chili powder. to tell the truth, the result of the first time was way better. 2 tsp cannaya pepper could be too hot, but i love it.

I used this recipe for some white beans and kidney beans I had already cooked up (they were dry beans).  I added some sweet potatoes (I added them with the onions et.al.).  I pureed the whole thing with my handheld blender to a chunky consistency.  Then garnished with lime, sour cream and cilantro.  It was awesome!

This is hardy and delicious! One of our family favorites. Sour cream on top is so good with it. We are big meat eaters but this so filling that it works good as a healthy alternative.

I messed with this recipe because I only had one can of black beans!  I used celery, onions, garlic, frozen peppers (green and red) and sauteed them per the instructions and then added the chili powder and cumin. Then I food processed half the can of beans (15 ozs) with 1-1/3 cup crushed tomatoes. It turned out perfectly even with my 11th hour tinkering! Think I'll add a little chopped cilantro before eating. It's perfect:)

This is a fantastic soup.  We made a few personal tweaks, but it is a wonderful healthy option as is.  Freezing some to see how it turns out thawed.  Thanks for sharing!

Used chicken broth since that what I had and didn't want to make a trip to the store with three kids (and not vegan). Served with sliced avocado and nonfat greek yogurt.  It was delicious, big hit with the family.  This will go into the regular rotation, thanks for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed this one, The only slight variance I made from the recipe was that I used Chipotle chili power and felt it gave a really nice flavor as well as a nice kick.  Recommended.

This is a fantastic recipe! Agree with the other posters about using dry beans that have soaked overnight and about using frozen corn instead of canned. That way you can add salt to taste. I also added about 2 tsp of lime juice, a pinch of cilantro and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Potatoes might be good in here ... might try that next time.

This is my first time reviewing any recipes on here. My husband and I just had this for dinner and it was DELICIOUS! I chopped up a bit of fresh cilantro and sprinkled it on top. And I had a large can of diced tomatoes so I used half in the blender with the beans which I had also boiled myself, and the other half of tomatoe I added into the soup. My hubby loves big chunks of tomatoes.  It turned out awesome! LOVED IT!

Our 1st taste was not too impressive as I thought it was rather bland.  However, after adding salt and/or shredded cheese (I'm not vegan), it was quite delicious and hearty!  Perhaps I reduced the sodium too much by rinsing beans and using no-salt added tomatoes and corn!

Very tasty! I halved the chili powder, because my kids have sensitive mouths. But I had a friend stop by and exclaim about the delicious smell. Mine seemed like it should have a little more salt, though.

Hearty vegan soup that my husband refers to as "chili."  Needs 1/2 tsp. salt, but that's the only tweak I suggest.

A wonderful soup...Very flavorful and filling.  I doubled the recipe and simmered in a large soup pot a bit longer than the recipe called for.  I made no other changes.  We just loved it and I will be making it often.

My meat loving boys really like this and I felt good about feeding to them!  I added cooked brown rice at the end as well which made it a little thick, but everyone liked that addition.  I may add a little more liquid next time to compensate.

My family went nuts over this recipe.  It was SO tasty.  I don't know if I was supposed to drain the beans and corn.  I didn't.  The soup ended up having a lot of liquid.  I cooked one cup of rice and added it to the soup.  I will be making this recipe on a regular basis.  :)

Love this recipe! So easy to make and so delicious.
I noticed others commented on the sodium but I always by low sodium black beams and always rinse them before adding them to a recipe. I also added an additional can of fire roasted tomatoes which also helped cut the sodium and added a bit more flavor.

Highly Recommend this  and will be making it for many years to come! Yummy!

This is wonderful! I just used a pound of black beans dried and soaked them overnight instead of canned. I used frozen corn instead of canned. Next time I plan to add a total of 4 carrots and 2 celery stalks and maybe a Jalapeno pepper or two.

This is one of the best soups I've ever had!  I am one of those who just can't leave it alone though!  I added an extra onion, 2 green onions, a red bell pepper - all chopped up into small pieces.  We love things to be spice so I also added lots of black pepper, cayenne pepper, extra chili powder and cumin!  Delicious!

This was kind of bland to me. I doubled the spices (maybe even more). And I also added some paprika and oregano.  I liked that some of the beans were pureed to give the soup a thicker consistency.  It's more like a chili to me.  It's great, but definitely up the spices.

very yummy & hearty soup that my boyfriend and I LOVE! (and we're not even vegan..haha). I don't have a food processor, so blending the beans & tomatoes is a bit harder in a blender. I only use 3 cups of broth, initially and then use the other cup to use in the blender in the 2nd step. The liquid helps everything blend much better & smoother & keeps your blender from blowing up!

This soup was great!!!  I was surprised, I was a little concerned about how it was going to turn out.  The only thing i did was add a little red pepper and i used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, i didn't have vegetable broth.  Will defently be making this again.

Good and tasty.  Turns out more like a chili than a soup.  Very easy and quick.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I know I won't be able to cook everyday I make a large pot that will last 2 or 3 days.  It tastes better with each day.  I modified the recipe a bit by adding more chili powder to make the flavor jump out at you.  The entire family loves it.

This soup rocks!  The only thing I did different was add more corn.  Next time, however, I will used the canned tomatoes with jalepenos for an extra kick.

Great soup!  I added red bell peppers, green beans, and green garbanzoes.  I think next time I will add some basil.  It does make a lot of soup, but it's great to take for lunch with a green salad. Thanks for sharing! *****

Awesome flavor! And it was so easy.  I don't usually use canned corn but the flavor was so good.  I used 1Tb. of chilli powder, 1/2 tsp. of cumin and I added to the recipe 1Tb. parsley flakes. Next time I will used less water/chicken broth.  I like my soups thicker.

This soup was good, but be prepared for a very spicy soup.  The cumin and chili give it a very strong flavor.  I would cut way back on the seasonings next time or change them to oregano and basil for a more italian flair.

This soup was super-easy and tasted fairly good. But oh my goodness... did it make us toot, if you know what I mean! Don't make it for company or you'll have a little symphony going on a little later ;)  haha... it was good, but just remember what the main ingredient is!

Wow.  What great soup!  I served it to vegetarian and meat-eaters, and got a thumbs up from all.  Nice blend of flavors and good consistency.  Serve with crusty bread and salad.  I used home made vegetable broth (recipe on this site, world's best vegetarian broth) and served finished soup with a dollop of sour cream on top of each bow.  Yum.

Easy and wonderfully tasty.  I did modify it somewhat as I like things spicy.  I added two chopped jalapenos - one in the saute and one near the end (could stand one or two more).  I upped the garlic and added another stalk of celery, too.  Also, I served it with some fresh cilantro.

This soup is just incredible!  We're sodium conscious eaters, so most soups are out of the question even if they are homemade, but this one is quite possible and amazing!  I used no salt added vegetable stock, tomatoes, and corn and La Preferida black beans.  The beans are by far the lowest in sodium I could find (most of the other brands had 4-5 times as much).  I also used 2 large white onions, 4 stalks of celery, a pound of carrots, and about 2 heads of garlic.  I added 2 chopped green peppers as well.  I sauteed all of that for about 15 minutes to make sure all of the vegetables were tender and cooked through.  The spices I didn't measure, but I would estimate I used a little more of each, particularly the cumin.  The extra vegetables made the soup extremely thick.  I had made it before according to the recipe and I ended up cooking it for about an hour to get it to the thickness I desired.  The second time I loaded it up with the extra vegetables to held avoid all of the unnecessary cooking time.  The soup is vegan, but if you aren't vegan, it goes very well with a little bit of sharp cheddar cheese sprinkled on the top.

Outstanding flavor, healthy, and filling!  This is a terrific recipe.  I thought the soup was great, and my boyfriend (who is often averse to beans) really liked it too.  Plus it's nice to have another easy recipe I can serve to our vegetarian friends.

Can't wait to make this again! Very tasty and relatively easy to make.  Chopping vegetables and figuring out how to work my new food processor took up most of the time.  I halved the recipe and used half kidney beans/half black beans.  I drained and rinsed both beans; used frozen corn instead of canned.

This is very good. It's more like a chili than a black bean soup. I cut the recipe in half and added 1 teaspoon of salt. I also simmered it for about an hour (rather than the 15 minutes in the recipe) because I wanted the veggies to be soft.

This soup was even better than I expected it to be.  Served it (along with some others) at my annual "Soup Dinner" and everyone loved it!

I thought that this soup was extremely good. The flavor and consistency were fine. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and would not change or add a thing to it!

Considering that it's made from nothing but basic ingredients that I ALWAYS have on hand, it's amazingly delicious and easy!  I didn't hear a single complaint from my kids toddler to 12, so I will be making this a lot.  (I did add some chopped, fresh spinach, and the added green made it pretty.)

This was yummy, but it made a lot and I got tired of it after while.  Plus, my husband said he wished it had meat.  :)  Anyway, it's a great option for a vegetarian meal!  Thanks for sharing.

Make this soup, eat this soup, be very, very happy!  This was super, I made it as is.  Pleasantly spicey and very hearty.  I'm trying to lose baby weight, and this is a great dish!  No taste sacrificed here!

Excellent soup!!!!  I used 1 Tbsp. chili powder and 1/2 Tbsp. chipotle chili powder.  It was plenty spicy.  Carnivores will never miss the meat.

I thought this was a delicious soup.  I halved the recipe and it gave me 6 servings.  It was excellent with a small dollop of vegan sour cream- and I think the soup tasted even better the next day.  
Cheap and easy, this will become a staple for the winter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Since I tried this recipe several months ago it has become a favorite at our house. This recipe also freezes well. I make a big batch on the weekend and freeze it in individual containers for lunches. I don't tell my kids, but this is a wonderfully nutritious, low fat soup. Thank you Christine for sharing this great recipe.

I noticed people wondering at the spiciness of this soup. Tee hee. I loved it. I used Gephardt's chili powder, a good Texas traditional brand that's got more kick than that dark red stuff. Freezes pretty well too for dh's lunch.

Very tasty and my 9 yr. old daughter loved it. I opted to put only 1T of chili powder based on the other reviews and added 2T of maple syrup. It still tasted a little like chili (next time I will leave it out entirely) but very flavorful. I also substitued Bulgar for the Rice. This will be added to my recipe vault and I will make it again.

This was great. Very flavorful. I found, however, that the recipe made about 12-16 servings (not 6). Maybe because I didn't drain the corn and beans? Have others had this experience?

Goooood soup! I added a few more components to the soup and it turned out excellent! Try this: use some fresh cilantro, homemade rotel tomatoes and green chilies and these spices : smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, ground cumin, parsley flakes, smoked alder wood sea salt. As for the extra veggies, one half of each color of bell peppers. Trust me, you'll love it. :) Now pair this up with lime tortilla chips and you have one tasty meal! 

It's like a take on tortilla soup, but somewhat different. I hope you enjoy! *waves*

This recipe was great. My husband was like I don't want bean soup. Little did he know, he would be asking for seconds and thirds lol. I followed everything except I didn't add celery and I did not follow step two. I simply just used all the ingredients whole without using the food processor. Very tasty. I plan to make again

This is really a good recipe just as is,  we loved it and we added the chili corn chips and fat-free sour cream for a vegetarian version.

Delicious quick creamy soup. Spice profile is good, but I would add some homemade salsa to the bean and tomato purÃ©e next time for some extra kick.

I made this for a vegan friend who just had surgery.  Followed the directions precisely.  Beans are not my favorite food but once it was all done, it looked delicious so I tried a small bowl.  Wow...I think I found a new favorite soup (or close runner up).  Great flavor and hearty!  My vegan friend also loved it!

I made it three times.  I  used fresh tomatoes, corn off the cob and cooked 16 oz. (dry) of black beans.  Great consistency of this soup, about like cream of mushroom soup.  Tastes great and it's vegan.  I sweated the onion so I was able to make without any cooking oil (save on calories).  The soup has the "sticks" to your ribs type quality to it.

3 cans of black beans would have been plenty, but I really enjoyed this soup. Ancho chilli powder adds a little extra kick.  I recommended it to a friend and she added chopped kale.

I just made this today. I used homemade vegetable broth and added vegetable bouillon cube as well. I also added chopped zucchini and yellow squash as I had them on hand. I found the soup a little watery and will reduce the amount of broth next time. I topped it with sliced avocado and crumbled tortilla chips.

I have picky eaters - so I substituted onion with onion powder, and I added extra carrots and celery - had to finely chop the celery in blender (picky eater).  Also used Fire Roasted crushed tomatoes, but used a big can.  VERY VERY Delicious!!  My whole family loved it - was perfect on a cold night.  Ate it over cornbread!!  Just need to make sure you don't have thick cuts of carrots.

Good hearty soup. I halved the recipe and added more carrot and celery (2 each). Also used 1/2 small onion chopped. I tend to use what I have on hand so I used 2 tsp chipotle chili powder without chili powder. I used 2 tsp of cumin and a tsp of oregano with the pinch of black pepper. I only had diced tomatoes with chipotle chili so that went in with the black beans to be processed. Using dry beans cut way back on the sodium content. Iâ€™ll make this a staple!

This soup was great! The only substitution I made was a 15oz bag of frozen corn instead of canned corn, because I just do not like canned corn.

I also put 3 cans of black beans and only pureed 1 can because I like my soup a little more hearty.

Would for sure make this again. It was very simple to make and it was pretty flavorful. I made it as it suggested except I did add Old Bay Seasoning, a dash of Cayenne Pepper, and a dash of red pepper flakes. I used the frozen fire roasted corn from Trader Joes. It was a great soup and perfect for a healthy, quick - but filling - meal.

My children and I loved this soup. We all got seconds. A few substitutions were made: frozen, roasted corn instead of canned, canned chunky tomato bisque instead of canned tomatoes, and red pepper instead of black pepper. No celery on hand, so omitted. Very easy and quick. I served cornbread hot cakes with it. This is going on my fall/winter weeknight meal list.

I made this the other night and it was very good.  It's very filling, more like a stew.  Next time I make it, I will probably use more vegetable broth.  I put a dollop of fat free sour cream (tastes much better than it sounds) on mine because the heat for me is a bit much.  My husband, on the other hand, added some cayenne to his!

This recipe provides an excellent base and is so quick and easy to make. I'd say I about doubled the spices, way more garlic, added about 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, and a good portion (2 tsp?) cayenne to kick it up a notch.  Threw in some extra celery, carrots, and onions, all finely diced. I had to substitute a can of black beans with a can of pinto, and drained all of them, and used frozen, not canned corn. I think next time I'll only puree one can of beans, not two. Highly recommend a food processor over a blender if you have one. We'll top with fresh cilantro, lime, and tortilla chips  to complete the flavour, and the non-vegan family member will pair with a quesadilla.  This is a large recipe (we are only two), so next time will 1/2 it.
It's a cold and cloudy day today-- this was definitely the perfect recipe for supper tonight.

Definitely needs salt and longer cooking time for thicker consistency.

Best Black Bean Soup ever! So easy to make. Very thick and hearty, which is what I was looking for. I drained my beans and corn, as well as cut my Chili Powder to 1 tablespoon. Great recipe!

Great, easy soup that fills the stomach and soul.  Tad more garlic and love this served with cast iron cornbread or Fritos scoops.  Love it topped with avocado chunks if you made it too spicy.

I use a 5th can of beans and puree 2 cans, I like a thicker soup.  Also, like some others have said, watch the sodium!  I am specific to get low sodium ingredients and rinse the beans.  Plenty of flavor without all the salt, which makes it all the better.

Very good. Added some additional garlic salt & red pepper flakes but not much. Iâ€™ve also added leftover chopped bell pepper that I needed to use up another time I made it.

This soup is absolutely delicious as written although it does have a good amount of sodium which there is an easy fix for if you use dry black beans!!

It's delicious.  The only change I made was putting in two cans of Rotel - it's spicy now!  Like almost a bit too much, probably should have only used one can.  But it's still delicious.  definitely a keeper. Oh, I also drained and rinsed the beans to lower the sodium content.

Very tasty and easy recipe that feeds a crowd. I loved how blending the beans with the tomatoes thickened the soup to a perfect consistancy. I rinsed my beans, used frozen corn (don't like canned) and added a little more zip with 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, since we like things a little spicier. My vegetarians were happy and I tossed some sliced chicken jalapeÃ±o sausages in the bowls for the meat eaters. We topped with a choice of sour cream, shredded cheese, avocados, diced green chilis and fresh chopped cilantro. Served with quesadillas. and tortilla chips, and heartily fed seven adults. I will definitely make this again. I might even double it to freeze some for quick weeknight meals.

I love this soup! I brought it to a church soup supper, and the spice level was a little much for some mid-western transplants, but I did have others of Cuban heritage say they liked it! Using the canned beans does make it pretty salty, so maybe opt for low sodium versions.

This was such a great recipe!  I used frozen carrots, and it was fine but will use fresh next time. Also plan to add extra celery, just to increase the veggie content. It was very filling, and easy to make. Will definitely be adding this to my menu every week!

I took this to a party and people couldn't get enough of it!  My kids devoured the part of the batch that I had left at home.  This one's a keeper at our house.  The only change I made was to use a bag of frozen roasted corn kernels in place of canned.

My family really enjoyed this one, and my son who usually complains about soup for dinner (but eats it) even enjoyed this. The flavor was really good, and we topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream, and had corn chips with it.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was. My only complaint about the recipe is that it's not clear on whether to drain the cans or not. I was expecting the soup to be a bit thicker, and I had drained 3 cans of the beans, and the can of corn. Nope, should have drained all the cans of beans and the corn. (Don't drain the tomatoes, obviously.) 

I had planned to add a diced pepper with the other vegetables, and totally forgot, but will for sure do that next time.  And yes, I will make this one again!

A nice hearty soup. I reduced the chilli powder to one tablespoon and found the heat more than plenty. Substituted 2 cups chicken bouillon and added shredded kale for a little colour to the soup. Garnished with sour cream and cilantro to balance and finish off the soup. Really enjoyed it!

Used frozen corn instead of canned and added a bit of frozen peas to because I had a bag opened in the freezer. Otherwise made it as is. Very tasty and I will be making it again. Thanks :)

I followed the recipe for the most part, but I forgot to grab the celery and carrots. I also drained and washed my beans before putting them in. Still, the soup was hearty and flavorful! I definitely think adding the veggies will help, but I also think I would prefer using 3 cans of beans instead of 4 next time.

I made this recipe this evening, an evening of horrible winter stormy weather.    I didn't want to leave the house, and as I had most of the ingredients on hand, did the best I could.  It was delicious and filling, a small bowl going a long way.
 
I didn't have corn or celery, so added more tomatoes.  I added a touch more of spice (cayenne), some salt, and sugar for our tastes.  It's so important to keep tasting as you go along, make it your amount of Yum, as we all have different yum levels.

Lovely recipe, thank you.  Warm full bellies in Stittsville tonight.

My family LOVED it!!! This was a quick and easy recipe to make. I did add and adjust some seasonings.  I added a tablespoon of salt (next time I will add another tablespoon [total of 2 tbls.]).I only added 1/2 a tablespoon of chili powder. I also added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of cumin. It was the perfect balance of flavors my family loves. This is an addition to our rotation.

This turned out pretty great.  I think it needs some more salt but if you add some cheddar cheese to your bowl, I think it is salty enough with that.  I dressed it up with avocado, sour cream, cheddar cheese, and fresh chopped parsley.  I might try cilantro next time though.  For more salt, I might try browning some chopped kielbasa sausage and adding to a bowl.

Quite good, and fun to make. Thought it needed some cayenne pepper. Great with sour cream (I'm not vegan :) ) and cranberry cornbread muffins.

I used dry beans instead of the cans. Not much of a can eater. So much sodium. I also use half of the ingredients. This soup turn out great! Especially with the cold weather here, my black bean soup is right on time. So easy to make!

Excellent soup! Although, it does NOT need salt. The vegetable broth was salty enough. I used Goya black beans (can). Delicious and thank you

Originally made according to the recipe, other than using dried beans vs canned beans, and wasn't overly impressed. Seemed rather bland, but definitely salvageable. Added more salt and chili powder before remembering I had a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. What a night and day difference. Will certainly make again, with some tweaks of course.

My family really liked this one.  It's basically like a meatless chili in flavor and consistency.  We are going to try it with faux meat next time and see how we like it.  It makes a lot!  6 of us ate 1 cup portions and we still have enough for lunches for a few days.

This one is easy and delicious!  I like to add avocado to the top and eat it with tortilla chips!  It's fairly mild flavor too, my 3 year old loves it. I usually make a double batch and freeze some for later.

It's a good and easy black bean soup. I did salt it to taste at the end. I also felt like it needed a significant amount of acid, so I added Tajin and lime juice.

By doctor orders I have to watch my sodium intake so I used low sodium canned black beans and the flavor was still awesome.

A bit too liquidy, next time I will use about 1/2 the vegetable broth and add in more as needed. I'll also use dry beans instead of canned because of high salt content of this soup.

This was my first time making the recipe, so I halved it just in case we weren't a fan. I followed the recipe exactly, but realized after I started that we didn't have any corn, so I just omitted it hoping it would still taste okay. Maybe this was a huge mistake because we found it completely bland.

This is the only soup I've ever made without meat, and I love it. I was concerned that it wouldn't be filling, but all the ingredients together make a thick soup, so no worries. I'm from the South, and I did find the seasoning extremely bland. The chili and cumin amounts are good, but it needs additional flavor, I feel. I add Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, garlic powder, & a Cajun seasoning as well, and it turns out fine. My daughter enjoys having a grilled cheese sandwich with the soup, too. Good luck!

I've made this several times. I need to to change something b/c the spices aren't quite right and i'd like it to be a bit thicker, maybe more like a stew. I do not like the cumin, so I omitted it, but I need to maybe up the chili powder or add something else, like red pepper or paprika.

My husband and I loved this soup! As suggested, I also rinsed the beans to cut the sodium.  This soup is low in fat, high in protein and fiber and I doubled the vegetables because I don't eat as many as I should. I added avacado slices as shown in the picture and added a dab of sour cream. Neither  garnish is needed but I liked the creaminess they added.  I will make this often!

This was delicious!  Hearty soup for the winter days ahead of us. I did need to make 2 substitutions and it still tasted great:
28 oz can tomatoes for my larger family size
2 cans of cannoloni beans for the purÃ©e

Saw a picture with avocado on top. Wish I had some.

I really enjoyed this soup. Used veggi and chicken stock, just to get it out of my fridge. I rinsed the beans. I also added a dollop of sour cream  and served it with corn bread. easy midweek, cool weather dinner.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used fresh corn and dried beans. I loved this soup. I saved the recipe to my favorites so I can make it again.  Thanks for sharing

Wanted a quick recipe to use up some canned beans and tomatoes and I was really surprised how good this recipe turned out.  The whole family - even my husband who is not fond of beans at it and loved it!  Since I was trying to clean out the vegetable bin, I substituted zucchini for carrots and celery.  I even replaced water for the vegetable broth and still the soup came out flavorful.  So quick and easy.  I will definitely make again.

I liked this and will definitely try it again. I made a few mistakes: one being that I used adzuki beans instead of black beans and that was not a good decision, second I did not cook the celery long enough and it was crunchy (crunchy soup is not a comfort food let me tell you) and last I did not use as much chili powder as it said to, use all of the seasonings! This makes quite a bit and I cut the recipe in half even. I'm hoping that if I fix my mistakes this will be much better.

I LOVE these recipes because they're so good and basic you can improvise.  I had all these ingredients (albeit in quite different measurements) except for the crushed tomatoes .  Bought two cans of crushed tomatoes and threw together what I had on hand (cup each of corn and red beans, can of black beans, celery, carrots, green onions since I had no regular onions, chicken stock since my own in the freezer was all I had,  garlic cloves so old they actually peeled easily, cumin, allspice since chili powder hurts my stomach, salt, pepper and a bit of sugar which was my Mom's advice for toning down the acidic taste of the tomatoes).  OMGosh it was SO SO good!  You need to make this recipe on a damp, chilly day as it is here today.  P.S. I had TWO bowels of it for lunch :-)

I made it just as the recipe calls for except I cooked my own black beans. That made the soup less salty which is okay with my palate. It's popular with all of  my family including the meat eaters. I usually serve nachos with this soup and make a  plate with meat and one without. We really like this soup.

Very good. Made according to recipe and served with garlic bread. Son recently became vegan and he loved it (I made it for him) and I was happy with it (I'm just not a big fan of black bean soup in general). Will make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and would make it again. I did, however make a few changes.
1.Only 3 1/2 cups of vegetable broth for a thicker soup
2. Only 1 tbs chili powder for a milder taste(was cooking for kids)
3.Added about 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4.I used diced fresh tomatoes instead of crushed for a fresher taste.
Overall, I enjoyed this recipe a lot, especially since it's vegan and not a lot of the stuff I eat does my family also enjoy!

I enjoyed it overall. I used dry black beans and frozen corn, instead of the canned varieties. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable and modified the spices (halved the chili powder and reduced the cumin). Both of my picky kids ate the soup without complaining.

This soup was great! I tweaked it a little by adding a can of chickpeas and changing the beans. I used a can of kidney, black, white and refried beans. Using the refried beans, half the white and kidney beans to be blended and used 1 1/2 cans of diced tomatoes to make it a little thinner. I forgot to add corn but it would have been yummy! Overall, a great vegan dish for bean lovers :)

This soup was very good!! It makes a lot so next time I would make half as much. I made it as listed except for taking the suggestion of rinsing the canned beans first. I had no issues blending the tomatoes and beans in my cheap blender. The only other change I made was to add another can of diced tomatoes w/green chilies. It did have a little too much of a bean flavor and this just tempered that and added a little spice. I served it with corn chips, shredded cheese and a dalop of sour cream. Since I'm not a vegetarian(my husband is) I added some chicken fajita pieces to mine that I had in freezer but it is hearty and filling just as it is. I'll make it again!

I found this recipe excellent for someone who is trying to get better at cooking. I've made my first soup ever and I've managed to overestimate the size of my cooking pot in relation to the measurements provided here (also substituting the chili powder for paprika and cumin for turmeric), but nevertheless I've ended up with a hearty meal, giving me an idea of what to expect in the future. I would give this recipe 5 stars despite the fact that my execution did not do it justice. Thank you very much for the upload :)

Yum!  My husband said that this was restaurant quality.  One of my daughters agreed.  The other, not a fan or beans in general, enjoyed it as well.  We cut the chili powder in half due to children's preference.  We'll definitely make it again and again.

This is a good soup. It doesn't have tremendous depth of flavor, but is a good weekday soup. I enhanced it with avocado pieces, spring onion tops, salsa and sour cream. I would consider adding either cilantro and diced tomato or salsa.

I rinsed the beans to cut the sodium. I used everything organic and frozen corn vs canned I added a Jalapeno  and extra garlic and cumin. I sauteed the veggies in garlic olive oil and I used 1 tablespoon of chipotle chili powder and 1 tbsp regular. I am not totally vegan so a dollop sour cream and cheddar jack cheese for toppings are great additions. I also used chopped cilantro as a garnish. Turned out awesome!

Wonderful recipe! I've made this many times now and the only thing I add is two more cans of beans and serve with a little brown rice to make it a bit heartier. My entire family loves this recipe.

I really enjoyed this full bodied soup! I too, used a bag of dried beans, cooked them first in my Instant Pot. I doubled the celery, added half of a red bell pepper, and doubled the garlic. I also added some cayenne pepper. I loved the texture of blending half the beans in my Vitamix. I topped mine with a little feta cheese (I know, not vegan). Will definitely make again.

Soup is good but I think you can lay off the chili powder a bit because it very strong ( of course it depends on your preference). I wanted it heavier so I added zucchini and potatoes to it too!

Really good, I only added 2 cups of water, instead of the 4 of veggie broth, because I wanted a thicker soup.   I have been eating all week and will make again.

Really yummy recipe, 2 tablespoons of chilli powder is bit to much for my liking - i only put in a tablespoon and halve and it was still very hot for me and my partner - would put 2 teaspoons in next time, not sure if thats what it's suppose to be? deff try this though, 5 out or 5 (if it wasn't for too much chilli)

This recipe was very good. I substituted one can of white kidney beans because I ran out of black beans. This dish Tastes like chili and is good with crackers or cornbread. I froze some for later but it was quickly thawed and eaten by my hubby and me.

Based on the reviews I expected to LOVE this soup. Made it exactly as written and found it bland.  Perfectly edible, just blah. On a positive note it's a healthy and economical recipe.  I was confused on whether or not to drain and rinse the beans.  There are two other vegetarian soup recipes on this site that are great. Vegetarian Pub Style Chili and Great Northern Bean Soup. The Northern Bean Soup is vegan as written. The chili can be vegan if you use the correct wine or a wine substitute. I believe there is a animal product used during filtration of many wines.   I'll keep trying black bean soup recipes in hopes of finding "the one!"

The recipe is great minus the carrots, they just didn't fit with the flavors to me. I will be making it again but I will swap out the carrots for green pepper or just remove them all together.

Unfortunately I only had two cans of black beans, so used them and a can of kidney beans. All black beans would be better. 

I used diced tomatoes, chicken broth and frozen corn.

Next time I will triple the veggies and use all black beans.

I served it with grated cheese and tortilla chips.

I liked this and my kids did too. I made some adjustments but the standard recipe would have been just fine if you add salt. I left out the celery and carrots and added green bell pepper and green chili peppers. I used 3 cups of dried beans instead of canned and adjusted the spices. I also added 1/2 pound of kielbalsa...my thoughts are that a pound of browned chorizo with the liquid included would make this even more authentic.  I know that it is Vegan and it would have been great without the meat. Topped it with chopped purple onion and a few spoonfuls of sour cream and served over white rice. This one will go into the rotation. Thanks!!!

I didn't blend anything. I used pre-spiced organic black beans and pre-shredded carrots. Otherwise, I spiced to taste and it turned out fabulous. Crazy easy and delicious.

I try to make the recipes like they are written unless I have to substitute an ingredient the first time. I was hoping for a thicker soup so I should have heeded the other reviews and used less broth. I cooked it in a crock pot but I don't think that caused the excess liquid because there was a lot of liquid, I plan to add more beans and have it for lunch one day. I didn't use as much garlic and will cut back more next time I make this as it was a bit too much for me and I put garlic in almost everything. The family liked it so I will try it again with a few adjustments. Thank you.

This is a great vegetarian soup! I cooked the veggies on the stove and then threw everything in the crockpot so that I could spend the afternoon away from home and come back to yummy soup. Will definitely make this again.

Made the beans rather than using canned.  1 lbs bag.  Next time I will reduce the cumin a little.  Maybe two tsps.  Used frozen corn instead of canned and chopped up fresh tomatoes rather than canned.  Great bowl of beans that I served over rice.

This is the best (almost) fast food soup recipe that I've made. Going all organic,using what I had, made half of the recipe w/ 1 can of garbanzo beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of fire-roasted tomatoes, frozen corn & a full box of veggie broth, left beans&tomatoes a bit chunky  too.Next time I'll get tortilla chips!

I loved this recipe. Using fresh, dry black beans would probably make it even better. I left out the onion, simply because I don't like onions. I also didn't follow the instructions with the cumin and chili powder, I never do, I just seasoned to my personal taste. I added a little bit og chipotle powder.

I am not vegan so I added Polish Sausage to this recipe and added more vegetables and made other modifications:
1) Slice, 1/4  and brown 1.5c of polish sausages(I actually used Alaskan Indian Valley Meats Reindeer sausage  which is much tastier). I used 2 stalks of celery and 2c of carrots.  Reduced chili powder to 2tsp and increased cumin to 2tsp.  I also used chicken broth and added 1 10oz can of diced tomatoes with green chillies.  Add some sour cream to your bowl when serving if desired.

Wonderful recipe, lots of room for variation. Has a nice spicy kick as written, might be too much for some but was nearly perfect for me. I stirred in a tbsp of chopped fresh cilantro when it was finished cooking, and really enjoyed the results. Might try adding fresh chilis and other vegetables in the future.

I used chicken broth, shredded vs chopped carrots, 2x the tomatoes, and a couple of shredded poached chicken breasts.  Served with cornbread.  My husband and I both loved it - all the leftovers were eaten up over a couple of days, which doesn't always happen at our house.  I will definitely make this again.

What a great healthy yummy way to get a hearty meal!!! I changed a few things to my liking. I used frozen corn, low sodium beens rinsed, extra celery and carrots. I'm not sure how they got 6 servings or of its too hearty for my family bam, but I'm thinking we will get plenty more than 6. Great flavor and didnt taste too salty!!!!

I halved the recipe to make it for my girlfriend and I and it worked really well. I didn't have celery, but made everything else as recommended. SO GOOD!! A must try for people of all diets. Thanks for sharing!!

I hate Vegan things usually. In fact I was contemplating adding in smoked sausage just to have some meat. However, I didn't have any at home so I didn't and was quite surprised with the results. I used dried black beans instead of canned (too salty) beans. It turned out really well. I would make it again. Avacado was a must!

Yum! My mom and I make this soup a lot. We use frozen corn instead of canned and add 1 cup instant brown rice to the pot when bringing the soup to a boil.

Loved it! I did make a few minor changes. I'm not a huge onion fan and a whole onion seemed like a lot. I used about 1/4 of a chopped onion. I also couldn't find celery so I substituted boc Choy without the leafy part, just the stem. Lastly, I salted to taste and used lemon pepper instead of black pepper. It was very hearty and tasted delicious. Even my kids loved it (ages 4 and 1) and they are picky eaters. I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe, and the leftovers were just as good.  I did substitute 1 cup cooked lentils for 1 can of the black beans and it was a nice addition.

Got my hubby to assist me in making this. It was fantastic and tasted even better the next day! It was spicy enough, not over the top. I used a box of Rachel Rae Stock in a box 32 oz. veggie broth. The carrots did not get cooked enough, I guess I needed to slice them thinner. Will do this one again! YUMMY!!!

Excellent recipe to start with. After reading through the comments, I made the following changes. I used 3 cups vegetable broth, 2 cups black beans and 2 cans crushed tomatoes. I also added 1/4 cup green pepper, 4 oz can of green chilis and 1 T. dried cilantro. I guess that is quite a bit of changes, but it is perfect for me now. Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the amount of carrots and onion, used the chicken broth I had on hand instead of vegetable. I rinsed the beans and drained the corn, and used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I topped it with some crushed tortilla chips. It had a very good flavor, definitely a keeper!

We loved it and it was so quick and easy.   The only thing I did different was to blend up more of the soup than recommended.  Added avocado on top too for a hit of creaminess and presentation.

Excellent soup! I followed the recipe adding a large can of diced tomatoes w/liquid instead of only 14 oz. I also added some cilantro. I did not blend the beans and tomatoes as we like chunky soups. We topped it with shredded cheese and Greek yogurt. Yum!

Have been using this recipe for a year or so now and EVERYONE loves it. The first time I used 2 tbsp of cayenne instead of chili powder and YIKES, however, the cayenne definitely gives it an amazing kick. I use less than 2 tbsp now, but it lacks something if I don't. I add more corn as well.

I'm not a vegan so I thought it would be a nice base.  I did use chicken broth, 1 lb. dry beans instead of canned, and added a small amount of kielbasa + 1 sliced jalapeno.  Served tortilla chips on the side.  Am quite happy w/ it.
Otherwise I kept all amounts the same.

I accidentally added a few too many beans (19oz cans instead of 15oz) which may have been why I found it a little bland in the end and a bit too watery. I doubled the cumin and chili powder and added about a tsp of oregano which helped, but a bit more spice would have been nice (a jalapeno or red chili pepper). It was pretty easy to make and it's definitely decent for a warm fall/winter soup and lots of leftovers.

Yummy, healthy, black bean soup. I cooked and soaked my organic  black beans before adding them. I soaked the beans overnight. This is an easy recipe. I had no trouble following it.

I picked this recipe up elsewhere and my version uses two can of black beans rather than four, 2 teaspoons of chili powder and 2 teaspoon of cumin.  I add some cayenne for a little extra zip.  I've tried adding different types of protein - chicken, ground beef and smoked pork chops - all good.  I love to top each serving with a squeeze of lime, chopped avocado, some shredded Monterey jack and tortilla strips.  One of my favorite soups - hearty and delicious!

I followed the instructions and included all ingredients except the celery, carrots, and onion. It was delicious. I recommend a pinch of shredded cheese and a small dollop or sour cream to make the bowl pretty.

The flavor is amazing, but I feel it doesn't yield enough broth. I have learned to add extra while making it now.

Delicious!.  I too noted the high sodium in the recipe and reduced the beans to two cans, used FROZEN corn and added FRESH sautÃ©ed carrots and celery in place of the beans.  I then split the pot and put cooked ground beef in my husband's pot and he pronounced it as the "Best I Have Ever Made".....and I am the SOUP QUEEN, so that's bold statement.

I liked this soup. it is good for a quick dinner on a cold night. I used fresh veggies instead of canned except the beans. The soup had a lot of flavor as directed but my wife still put Frank's red hot on it for an additional kick. I will make this again when I want a healthy and delicious soup that is easy to make. I made 2 servings that yielded more than my wife and I could eat.

I halved everything except the onion, celery, garlic, and carrots and still made enough soup to serve 12! It was delicious with a side salad. However, the nutrition information for this soup is completely incorrect. Sodium and carbs were rather high in my HALVED recipe and calories came out to 210.

The soup turned out much better than I had hoped (my first attempt at vegan cooking). I didn't know if I was supposed to drain the beans, corns and tomatoes or not. I only drained the corn. Substituted 1 can of kidney beans for black beans by mistake, which my husband loved and one of my daughters didn't like. Substituted 1 tsp of red pepper for the chili pepper. Just the right amount of spiciness. Served with brown rice/quinoa, which I put in the soup. Others in my family put some soup on top of the rice. Out of the 8 of us who ate it, only a 10 year old thought it was OK, and everyone else loved it (children ranging from 4-17 with my husband and me). I was actually quite surprised at its heartiness. 4 stars instead of 5 ONLY because the sodium must be to the moon.

My 12 year old son started making this recipe for the family last year and we've all enjoyed it each time he makes it.  We are not vegan so we actually like the flavor a bit better with chicken broth but we've had it with vegetable broth too and it's been good as well.

Great base recipe, and easy too.  I didn't include the corn, but used 3 cans of black beans (drained and rinsed to reduce sodium).  Substituted 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne for the chile powder, and used 14.5 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes. With the extra beans, I let it simmer for 25 minuites instead of 15.  It was so good that two vegan guests had a second helping and asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

Just what I was looking for.  Can't say I followed all proportions exactly but it gave me a good start.  Sister has gone vegan so I'll be needing more like these to take to her place for dinner.  Awesome!  Thanks!!

I have made this soup 3 times in the past 2 months. I love it, my husband loves it, and my daughter also loves it. Easy to make, and the texture is wonderfully creamy. Spices are just right. I use dried beans instead, to keep our sodium count down. 
Will continue to make it, and enjoy it. Barbara G.

It was pretty good, made it for some vegetarian family members. I could be biased--I miss the meat:). 
My desire was to make this a meal substitute, but the consistency was more liquidy than solid/chunky. I think i'll try not blending the crushed tomatoes and 1/2 the beans next time. Good flavor. Might make again.

I loved this recipe! I improvised with chicken stock and used a can or Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles instead. I halved the recipe and didn't add blended black beans. Instead I used a hand mixer t pulse the actual soup because I like a more hearty soup. It was delicious and perfect for a cold Toronto night of -16C. Thanks again!

This soup is a keeper.  My family loved it.  I used dried black beans that had been soaked and cooked first.  It sounds like a lot of chili powder and cumin, but don't be tempted to reduce the amount of spice.  It's just right.

I've made this recipe several times.  My husband is Puerto Rican, so I'm always looking for Hispanic recipes, especially ones with black beans.  The first couple of times I made it, it was good, but I felt as if it were missing some flavor - not spice - just flavor.  At first I was just adding flavor by using the Bush's Seasoned black beans, which are great to use with all 4 cans that are called for.  I still felt like it needed a little more flavor, so I add 2 mini packets of Sazon Goya (Coriander & Annatto) (bright orange & pink box) seasoning and it's wonderful!  Just what it needed.  I love this recipe and I do thank the publisher for a wonderful gift.  My kids love this too.  The recipe as written makes quit a bit, so I usually end up freezing about 1/3 of the soup.  It freezes well.

I would have given it 5 stars if It wasn't for such unhealthy ingredients. Why use "canned?" Beans are'nt so hard to make, you set dry beans in water over night and slow cook them, with seasoning. I would suggest everyone read the information concerning canned food and the chemical bpa, very unhealthy! Not to mention you'll have so much tremendous flavor if you cook without canned ingredients. Fresh corn is much better, tasty, and healthy. I would suggest getting corn that is organic because most corn is genetically modified. The recipe is AWESOME but go FRESH!

My family goes nuts for this recipe.  It's so good.  We found that heating it up the next day tastes even better.

Very very delicious.

The shocking part to me was how amazing this tasted!  Been working thru a series of vegan recipes and this was the first one that was truly tasty.  Only change I made was to cut back the black beans by one can (using 3 instead of 4) - was a huge hit in a house of three meat and potato men and myself.  Will DEFINITELY be making again, and again, and again.

This recipe was delicious and filling even though I accidentally used vegetable stock instead of broth. I can't wait to make it with broth, because I bet it will be even better.

I love this soup! I made a few modifications since I don't like cooked celery I replaced it with chopped sweet peppers and used crushed tomatoes instead of vegetable broth. It made for a thicker soup but incredibly tasty. I served it with chopped Avocado on top and corn chips on New Years Day, my family loved it!

Too much broth. I like my black bean soup thick, so I would cut the broth to 3 cups and maybe add an extra can of beans. I also found it bland- Added some four pepper spice- The next time I may add a can of Rotel chilis. I used chopped, Mexican Cocoa tomatoes,which look nice in the dark soup. I wouldn't food process them- But that's my taste.

WOW!!  Awesome!  I only had 3 cans of Black beans, so I pureed  a can of chili beans in place of 1 can of black beans.  It was so good.  I recommend using frozen corn because I think they taste better than canned corn.  I used Trader Joe's Cuban style roasted corn....so good!  This recipe leaves a lot of room for improvisation  but I don't think it needed it.  I will be making this all the time now.

Great basic recipe!  Can easily customize this to your own liking by using varied kinds of beans (kidney and navy) and adding other veggies.  Yum!

Not a huge fan of the soup, but it is more because of personal preference. I used soaked dried beans rather than the can to drastically cut the sodium and the recipe freezes wonderfully! Also, it sure makes a lot so freezing it was definitely a bonus.

My family loved this soup - my kids ate it for days. I used 2 tablespoons of Lizano sauce (from Costa Rica) instead of chili and cumin and it made this a "comfort" soup. Also, the recipe doesn't mention draining the beans and corn which may be obvious to most, but I had to search reviews to figure out whether to drain or not.

Love this recipe!!  Of course, I tweaked it a little to suit our taste and this is what I did: I didn't puree the tomatoes and beans - just used them whole.  i used only 2 cans of black beans and used Mexican corn instead of regular.  I also used hot sauce in place of chili powder as I didn't have any.  The other thing I changed was I added about a cup of tomato juice and a pinch of sugar because I wanted more of a tomato base.  Turned out great and I will definitely make it again!!  Thank you for this great recipe!!

I really enjoyed this soup! I also find that adding brown or white rice gives it a heavier feel and more substance. The sodium is REALLY high on this however because of all the canned veggies. You can find cans at local markets that are organic and have little to no sodium which make this recipe all the better. I also added a little more vegetable broth for more a "soupier" consistency. Be sure you use a big pot because this makes a lot! We've been eating it almost a week now between 4 of us! :)

Loved it. I made my own beans from scratch to cut down on sodium, and added a bit more heat (cayenne/dried chili peppers), and a bottle of dark beer. My family loved it.

Wonderful soup!  This is the kind of soup that you can put as much of an ingredient in that you like & won't hurt it :)  I added lentils & mushrooms & it was still soooo good!  Even better the day after you make it so all the flavors can soak in!

Made as close as possible to the original recipe.  My differences were, 2 cups dry black beans, cooked in a pressure cooker.  Drained beans, reserved half for the pot, and the other half for the tomato/bean puree.
Used, Better Than Bouillon, vegetable bouillon, for the broth portion of the recipe.
The soup was great, and will definitely make again!

This was very tasty.  I cut the recipe in half since it is just my husband and me, but ended up using whole cans of corn and tomatoes and it tasted great.  Also, I didn't have celery and used a red bell pepper instead.  Like another reviewer suggested, we put tortilla chips in ours and a dollop of sour cream.  Yummy!

This was totally restaurant quality. I used low sodium chicken broth and needed to add 2 tsp salt at the end. Served with sour cream. Amazing. Will immediately go into frequent rotation in my kitchen.

YUM!! I make this weekly because my family loves it so much. We follow a plant based diet and this is such a great soup to look forward too. It tastes a lot like chili which is nice. I make the recipe as is and it's wonderful. We eat this with warm pita bread and occasionally add some provel cheese on top which makes it to die for!

Very easy. Everything you'd want in a Black Bean soup. I serve it at our local farmer's market and people went nuts over it!
To curb the sodium, I used dried beans that I soaked. You could also rinse your canned beans to minimize the salt. 
This soup is better the next day, and a real winner!

I used a package of dry beans instead of the canned, soaked them overnight.  I also simmered the soup for about an hour the first night, then another hour the next night before we ate the leftovers.  It was SO GOOD.  Even my 10 yr-old, 8 yr-old, and 1 yr-old loved it.  I'm still eating it, three nights in a row!  I think it makes more than 6 servings.  :o)

great tasting and easy. i doubled the recipe and didn't have all of the canned black beans necessary so i tossed in a bag of black dried beans (which meant you need  to cook the soup for 2 hours) along w/ the can of red beans, can of black beans, can of pinto beans and a can of refried beans. it was fine.

This was an awesome soup! I added flaxseed to thicken it and add more nutritional benefits. I would also recommend to use low sodium or sodium free cans of black beans, broth, and tomatoes and use frozen corn. It tastes fresher.

Really good black bean soup.  Made pretty much how described.  Was out of carrots and dont think I missed them.  Dud add garnish of green onions and cilantro to finish.  Following other comments, drained and rinsed beans from two cans.  Kept the liquid from two cans of organic black beans, whihc has much less sodium than non-organic.  Made some yummy corn bread as a side dish.

Dinner tonight!!!  Served with grated cheddar cheese and sour cream, delicious!!!!  Used dry beans instead of canned and seasoned with kosher salt to our taste.  My husband and I enjoyed this tremendously.   Will make again soon.

Wonderful, my whole family loved it! I used 1# dried beans instead of the cans to cut back on the sodium. I think next time I will only blend a quarter of the amount of beans instead of half to have it even thicker and heartier.  Great and this is a keeper!

Like some others, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Additionally, I topped it with a dollop of sour cream, chopped green onions, and a few fritos corn chips.  Outstanding!!

I love this healthy soup.  I ran out of chili powder so I added red pepper flakes for some spice and 3 Tbsp of Taco seasoning.  It came out so delicious!

I added twice the fresh veggies, half the chili powder.  We thought it was very salty somehow.  Did it seem really salty to you?

Excellent soup.  No major changes to the recipe.  I held my breath and added all the spices.  Be sure to add all 4 cups of broth as it reduces the impact of all that cumin & chili powder.  Definitely will make this again.

If you use homemade stock (I used vegie), dry beans, fresh/frozen corn, and fresh tomatoes I think that this is very healthy and great for protein and fiber. I added zucchini, mushrooms, half a cup of barley to soak up some of the liquid, extra garlic and spices, and then chopped green onions on top for serving. It's really good, but I feel like I'm eating chili soup because of the flavour profile - this is not a bad thing, but I think next time I will nix the stock and just make black bean chili with this recipe. Still great though, so definitely 5 stars.

Absolutely delicious! I made this soup for the first time the other night. It is easy to make and the flavors are wonderful. I will definitely be making it again as we go into the fall/winter season.

Excellent!!  Followed recipe except I only had 3 cans of black beans, so in the second step I subbed one can of refried black beans.  I am not a huge BB Soup fan this was sooo good and healthy.  Thank you!

I made this and everyone enjoyed it. A few adjustments; no cumin so I used garam masala. I had only 19 oz can of black beans so added red kidney and navy beans. And I left out the corn. It all worked out well

This recipe was very good!  The whole family loved it.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to only use 3 cans of beans, and due to my family's milder taste preference I only used 2 tsp chili powder and it was perfect.  Thanks for posting- we are new to the vegan lifestyle and it's recipes like this that make me want to keep on going!

Definite winner! I added tomato and red pepper chunks to the initial saute, which made it both hearty and refreshing. Recipes like this make vegan eating easy and delicious.

This soup with light on flavor - required lots of additional seasoning to make it edible.  There is nothing wrong with it as a base, but there are much better receipes out there.

I made this tonight - and my husband is hiding the rest from me - he wants it all!  I didn't use the oil (I used veg broth), and decreased the chili powder to 1 tsp. (yes, I'm a weenie), and it had just the right taste for us.  It really is easy, hearty, and we loved the taste.  This is a keeper for us.

This was a very good recipe.  Very economical.  I don't have a food processor so I didn't process the beans & tomatoes.  I just cooked it longer to soften everything up.

Pretty spicy!  I used half chickpeas/half black beans and added some swiss chard and orange bell pepper.  A good solid vegetarian soup.

This was okay for me. It was good but not "wow, great!" I used chicken stock and sauteed my onions, garlic powder, carrots, and added green pepper first which I recommend. I also used dry black beans which worked great as well. If you are like me and like a lot of flavor, up the spices! Overall an average recipe.

This is a 5 star soup all the way! I followed the recipe, but was concerned that it would be too salty so I added a cut potato to adsorb some of it, and added 2 bay leaves for a nice long, slow simmer. It was so delicious!! We will definitely be making this again through the fall and winter!

I thought this was a delicious recipe!  I only had 2 cans of black beans, so I used a kidney bean and a garbanzo bean in place of the 2 other black beans.  It is so simple and easy with great flavor.  I will use this again for sure!

Great recipe! My husband and I love having this soup for dinner. We usually add or subtract a few veggies depending on our particular taste at the time. We usually eat it a few nights in a row, and it just gets better each night!

This is the heartiest, most comforting meal I've ever made from a Web recipe. I vary the ingredients a bit...last time I processed black beans and chick peas for the base and then put more black beans and black-eyed peas directly into the soup. I also add extra tomatoes. Dee-lish!!

Nice, basic soup recipe. Very simple to make and comes out looking nice. The flavor was a bit bland for us so I added a little sea salt and some herbs.

very good!  We ommitted the celery and reduced the carrots because we didn't have very many left.  I also pureed the soup with a hand (wand) blender, right in the pot. (I did this before adding the corn).  Thanks for the recipe!

I practically live on this soup - it is soooo good.  Word of warning - careful which type of chili powder you use - I recently changed brands to a local brand (I live in Asia) and the soup was so spicy I had trouble eating it.

Great soup for a cold winter day.  I usually follow the recipe exactly `but I got  distracted while cooking this time.  After adding the broth & 1/2 the beans to the carrots, onions & celery I pured it ~oops!  It still turned out great!  Thanks for a wonderful bowl of soup.

This soup was ok, but not spectacular for me.  It is a good base, and I think that I will make it again, but I will add some jalapenos and decrease the amount of broth so it is thicker and has more kick.  I did love that it's easy and makes quite a lot so that I can freeze the extras.

I only had two cans of black beans on hand, so cut the recipe in half (except for the carrots and celery) It was very veggie!  I also subbed Beef Broth for Veggie Broth (all I had, obviously, NOT a vegetarian)  Still, this recipe was excellent!  It makes a lot!  Loved the idea to serve with cornbread!

wow... not only am I not a vegan (and neither is my family), I didn't know how to cook without meat until this recipe.  Fantastic just as is.  I made it the day before and heated it the day of in the crockpot.  We all ate every bite!

This was my first vegan recipe *ever*, and the first recipe I tried from this site.  It was excellent!  Not hard to make, served three adults and three kids with plenty left to spare and freeze for later.

I'll definately make this again.`I'm not overly fond of cumin and the chile powder I used already has cumin so I omitted the cumin. Next time I will cut the amount of garlic and perhaps try adding jalapenos or picante sauce.

This was a tasty success! Makes way more than indicated in the recipe, but this is good! Great to freeze in individual portions for later use.

I added a bit more pepper spice and mushrooms.

This soup is awesome.  It's very flavorful and healthy.  I used half of the chili powder called for and it was perfect.  I made it on Thanksgiving and everybody liked it.  I will definitely make this again.  Very tasty!

Great recipe!  I substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth and cut the amount in half for a more stew-like consistency.  I also have experimented with substituting 1 Tbsp. of the chile powder with chipotle chile powder or ancho chile powder - both are nice variations on the original.

This is a great Black Bean soup!  I didn't use the celery or tomatoes (didn't have either one on hand). I used chicken broth instead of veggie and added a small can of diced green chiles. Also, I used an entire bag of black beans that had been soaked overnight - this made it thicker and also gave it a darker color. Excellent flavor - thanks for the recipe!

This is very easy to make & it tastes delicious!  I used chicken stock in place of the vegetable broth & cooked it in my slowcooker (use less stock if you do it in the slow cooker).  Don't forget the sour cream dollop when serving!

I have made this soup several times now and everyone loves it.  The only changes I made were I left out the carrots & celery didn't really think they were necessary.  When I puree the beans & tomatoes I also put in some fresh cilantro.  I try to reduce our sodium so I always rinse the beans off.  I use no salt added tomoatoes.  For the vegetable broth I buy the Knorr brand of vegetable bouillion, one large cube makes 2 cups of broth.  Also I just throw in a bag of frozen corn.  I let it simmer on the stove for quite a while for all the flavors to blend.  When I serve it I put a little shredded cheese & a dollop of sour cream on top.  Excellent.

Perfect no-meat fare. The soup is filling and tastes great. Ran out of chili pepper after half a tablespoon so substituted red cayan pepper.. put in maybe a little too much, but still was fantastic!

This tastes like chili with black beans and corn. I think it needs to simmer longer than 15 minutes. I added some fresh, chopped cilantro, a 6 oz can of tomato sauce and a 4 oz can of green chilies, drained. Drained and rinsed the beans - this always helps with after effects :-) Next time I will omit the corn, we didn't think it added anything but carbs. I used 5 cloves of garlic and an extra small vidalia onion. I would cut the chili powder in half if making again. This took a lot of prep time and didn't taste superior to this site's Black Bean and Salsa soup, which is fast and easy. Overall though, this is very healthy and tasty.

I read some reviews and cut out the celery and added more carrots and some rice.  It needed more garlic in my opinion (though I like my food with a heavy garlic taste), but ended up very tasty anyway.

This is excellent soup. I made a few changes because of ingredients onhand, but I'm sure the recipe as written is fantastic.  I used 1 can of Goya Black bean soup in the red can (which is really just black beans in a sauce), 2 cans of regular black beans,  1 can of black beans w/jalapenos in lime juice which went into the food processor along with the tomatoes and a can of the regular black beans, 1 tsp. salt, medium heat chili powder, 1/2 chicken and 1/2 vegetable broth and about 2 1/2 cups cooked brown rice.
I was expecting the soup to be thicker, but it was delicious and had a bit of a zip to it with using a few hotter ingredients.
Sprinkled shredded cheddar jack cheese on top.
Nice to see a review that says it freezes well!

Thanks for posting a great recipe Christine!!

I made this soup for dinner tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  I only had two 19-0z tins of black beans so I pureed one with the tomatoes and added the other along with a tin of kidney beans and it was just fine. I served it garnished with a little dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and a pinch of fresh chopped cilantro...mmmmmmmm!

Despite all the excellent reviews, I was skeptical that such few and simple ingredients could result in such an excellent soup.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious and so healthy too!! Followed the recipe exactly but added one teaspoon salt.  Even my 9 year old liked it (if I puree all the beans she'd probably love it)!  Thanks for recipe - its a keeper.

Absolutely loved this soup!  However, I didn't rinse and drain the black beans so the soup was very liquidy.

I fixed this soup last night for friends and everyone just loved it! It is very easy to fix and tastes so good. I used dried black beans as I didn't have the canned ones, so started those in the morning. Then later I just followed the recipe and it went together quickly. I upped the spices a bit just because I really like spicy food, but other than that didn't change a thing. Thank you for a great recipe, this will be one of our favorites.

I'm not vegetarian but every once in awhile I like to eat vegan/vegetarian meals. I thought this soup was very good.  All of my guests liked it as well.  Used one can less beans, left out celery because I hate the stuff but left everything else the same.  From other reviewers it seems like this recipe is pretty flexible.  This will definitely be in our recipe folder from now on.

I shared this recipe with several people.  I was not sure whether to drain & rinse the black beans or not.  I added them just as they came from the can without draining.  Everyone said it is a keeper.

Great EAST recipe, it was a big hit.  Serve with sour cream and or cheese toppings.  For an extra kick add more chili powder.

This soup was great, my whole family liked it. I used beef broth instead of vegatable because I didn't have it. And I also added rice, it is a complete meal! The only change is that I would add more carrots than just 2 if you like carrots, they get lost in the soup.

What a great recipe!  Being a Weight Watcher, I'm always looking for low-fat, high fiber.  This soup is less than one point per serving!  Plus the family liked it!

I was SO impressed with this recipe.  I followed it exactly as written, with one teensy change--I added about 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper instead of the black pepper.

Absolutely perfect.  Makes a ton!

I love this soup so much. The only bad part about this soup is other soups don't taste as good. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful - tasty, hearty, low fat and easy to make.  This has become a staple for us! Good w/ light sour cream and blue corn chips.  I also add spinach.

Economical, quick and healthy as can be[ans]!  Sorry for the pun.

I might add a bit of cayenne next time to give the soup a bit more bite.  Fantastic recipe.

If you love black beans, you've got to try this recipe.  Thick, hearty and delicious!  I will make this again and again.
