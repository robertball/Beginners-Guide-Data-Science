If you are looking for a lasagna recipe that isn't too heavy, this is the one for you! A nice balance with plenty of veggies. I ate it the same day, it would be better prepared ahead and reheated, so the flavors have a chance to blend.

Love it!  This is the first time I've made a lasagna, and it's the best lasagna I've had!  I did alter the recipe, though.  I used 1 lb sweet and 1 lb spicy italian bulk chicken sausage instead of the pork and beef, and I mixed a bunch of chopped spinach in with the ricotta cheese.  Also, I used 3/4 of a bottle of Newman's Own Sockarooni instead of the marinara because I needed to use it up.  I think I'll use the same amount next time because the lasagna sliced up really nicely without a lot of spillage with this amount of moisture.  I love the carrots and celery in it!

This is a great. My carrots were a little crunchy and I added spinach since we are such fans here. It was a hit with the older people in my group but the kids did not like the veggies in their lasagna. I would try to get the veggies to be a little more squishy because they would blend in with the noodles more.

I made this for a friend who said that it was a big hit with her family.  The two kinds of meat added interest.

This was ok, but I found it lacked some flavour.  I usually add crumbled spicy sausage meat to my lasagnas, and both the hubby and I agreed that my normal addition of sausage meat would make this taste great.  A good basic recipe in which you can mould into you own favourite lasagna.

I lost my old lasagna recipe, and this one looked like a perfect replacement. It turned out quite well, although I made a few changes. I used no-boil noodles, because that's what I had on hand, and I pureed the veggies before combining them with the sauce (sort of disguises them, which is great for kids - or a husband who continually remind you he's not a rabbit!). I also added a layer of mozzarella before the parmesan, because IMO, lasagna must have plenty of cheese :) Overall, this is a great, simple lasagna recipe, with plenty of room for customization!

I loved this recipe! I sauteed onions and garlic and used frozen mixed veggies instead of cooking carrots and celery. It was excellent!
