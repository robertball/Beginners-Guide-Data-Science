Well, this is my second failed attempt at Tres Leches but I think my problem is over beating. Flavor was good but cake was way too dense and would not soak up all the milk, not even close. Use your gut, not the directions on beating, as all mixers are not alike.  I'm not giving up and will try again until I master it!!

I made this cake and waited for 3 days before we ate it.  OMG is this good!  Everyone wants the recipe and when they say that the cake gets better with age, it really does.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a definite hit. My husband loves tres  leches  and his only complaint was that it was more dense than what he is used to. cake turned out exactly like the picture, which I am thrilled about! I am not a fan of sweetened condensed milk, or milk in general, yet I found myself sneaking pieces of itThe flavor is considerably better a couple days in, so i suggest waiting at least a full 24hrs. It's kind of complicated/time consuming compared to traditional recipes for regular cake, but I love that it's a blank canvas and you can change flavors, fruit and extracts to make it unique.

By all accounts, it was perfect!  Very easy to make. I will make a bit more of the milk mixture next time as my sponge cake absorbed every drop. Iâ€™ll definitely make it again.

Great cake but didn't come out as good as expected on my first attempt. I also made a quick and easy version which is also good (for those who may also have trouble with it) with golden vanilla cake mix and then follow remaining directions adding the milk and so on. Even better the following day.

I recently tried a  tres leche cake from the restaurant Abuela's and it was to die for!  Then I saw this recipe and tried it to see if it tasted like the restaurant version.  Yes!!  It does!! Fabulous!!

I did not care for the sweetened condensed milk in this recipe.
