A yummy treat, but nothing really special.  They were enjoyed, but not raved about.  These were definitely gooey as the name states, but I thought they could have had a stronger flavor.  There's a faint peanut butter taste. I really only got texture from the coconut - not really any taste.  I really liked the taste of the bottom layer, but thought the top needs more of a flavor burst.  I'm curious to see if others alter this a little and how so.

I tried this today and did it in a 13x9 pan.  After reading the other reviews, I added 1 extra tbsp of peanut butter and 1 tbsp of flour to the syrup mixture, baked for the requisite amount of time and they came out perfectly.

As is, the recipe is rather ... unpleasant.  I altered it slightly and I enjoyed my changes.  Instead of the given crust, I took a sleeve of graham crackers, smashed them up, and mixed with about 3/4 cup of melted butter.  I pressed it into a pan, topped with chocolate chips, then followed the filling recipe as is, except using only 1/4 cup of corn syrup and adding 1/4 cup butter.  I omitted the coconut because of personal preference, and didn't add more chocolate chips since they were a layer between the crust and peanut butter.  Pretty tasty after my modifications, but rich.  A small square is enough for me.

Did not like these at all.  Maybe mine just didn't turn out right.

I really loved the texture as well as the flavour of these bars. They are gooey just like the name promises. After reading the first couple reviews I made a couple changes: used a 8x8 pan (I'm sure they would have been too thin for a 13x9) and added an extra 2 tbs of peanut butter to the filling (we really love peanut butter). I was tempted to add some more chocolate chips, but I'm glad I didn't. I think it would have overwhelmed the peanut butter flavour. I made these just a couple of hours ago and half the pan is gone - enough said.

The taste was yummy but I don't know what happened with mine. There was not enough to cover my 9 x 13 pan so next time I will either double the batch or use a smaller pan. Mine turned out very thin and nothing like the photo. Still good so I will try again.

first of all, let me start out by saying that i am capable of following a simple recipe, and nothing that i have made has ever failed as miserably as these peanut butter bars. the "crust" was sizzling when i opened the oven, and i the corn starch created a bad texture of the filling.

These were pretty good. I used graham crackers for half of the flour, used chunky peanut butter instead of the creamy, and omitted coconut for personal preference. I also doubled the peanut butter for more flavor and added marshmallows. Pretty yummy and extremely gooey. I even baked longer to make sure they were cooked all the way. Not bad.

This is definitely a great base for what I did.  Instead of peanut butter and coconut I used 1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree and used mini chocolate chips.  I also used the 13x9 pan.  I will make them as pumpkin bars again, however I will us a smaller pan, perhaps 8x11.  Loved the pumpkin!

Not impressed. Brought these to a casual party and I was kinda embarassed. I could of made a lot of other desserts that could have gone over better. These were a weird doughy mess

Loved these way to much! Seriously couldn't stop eating them. Loved the texture, and the flavor was perfectly balanced. I'm making them again tomorrow! Yummy.

There is some kind of product with a similar recipe that comes in a box and it tastes a little better. The ingredients are almost identical to this recipe. My family and I still liked it and ate it all. Recipe worth trying.

My husband hates coconut so I used oats instead, and made this in an 8x8 pyrex dish so it was a little thicker.  It turned out tasty, but next time I'll add less chocolate chips, they made the squares fall apart a bit.

Added more p. butter and substituted oatmeal for the cocoanut.   This was okay but I have so many better recipes.

I added a few Reese's Pieces to use them for a Halloween Party, but they weren't as tall as the ones in the photo and very gooey.  They were good, but maybe I could have baked the crust a little longer than the recipe wrote.
