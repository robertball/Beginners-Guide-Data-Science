I give this 5 stars for ease of preparation. It sounds really tasty. I'll try it but make this change. The beef cubes are usually really salty....I recommend substituting beef broth.

This is probably my favorite recipe from this site. We make it about once a week. I do make a few changes. We use only a half pound of ground beef,  2 cans of tomato soup, 2 cups of rotini noodles. We like ours a bit more soupy and 1 lb of ground beef was far too much. Garlic powder instead of cloves because it is much easier (1/8tsp per clove). I do keep the bouilon in the recipe, a little less italian seasoning and omit the cornstarch altogether because it didn't seem to do much aside from leave clumps of cornstarch. We used to make a lasagna soup and this has definitely replaced it. Amazing!

I used reduced sodium beef broth in place of the water and sodium filled bouillon cubes and healthy request canned soup.  Mixed in the "Italian Seasoning Mix" from this site for the Italian seasoning.  This took longer than the time specified for the noodles to cook.  After 10 minutes uncovered, I simmered covered for another 10 minutes.  This made the broth thick so no corn starch was needed.  My daughter thought this had a little sweet taste to it.  After all was said and done, thumbs up.  I mixed in low-fat cottage cheese in mine.  Hubby added crushed red pepper flakes to his.  The pre-packaged mixes might be a little cheaper, but this hands down tastes better.

I loved this recipe on it's own and would have given it 4.5 stars if that was possible.

I made some changes to make it a 5 star for my family.
- 1/2 the called for Italian seasoning
- Add a can or two (15 oz)of either Stewed or Italian Stewed tomatoes
- Used pre-minced garlic from the jar.
- Kept adding broken lasagna noodles till it was just exploding with them...we like noodles!!

The point is its sooooo easy to adjust this recipe for your own taste.

I didn't have all these ingredients on hand, so I used 1 cup chicken stock and 3 cups water instead of the beef bouillon, and a can of tomato paste instead of tomato soup.  I also added a quick  bechamel sauce (butter, sour cream, flour, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper) to top it off.  Then sprinkled a bit of mozzarella.  Was very good, passed hubby's test, will make it again!

This was a huge hit tonight with my family! Couple of changes... I used 1 cup water and 3 cups beef broth instead of bouillion. No cornstarch and no Italian seasoning. It thickened up just fine, not soupy at all! We added some cheese on top and even my picky eaters had seconds! Super easy!

I really like this recipe because it is easy, quick and I usually always have these ingredients on hand. I did do one thing different though, I substituted the beef bouillon cubes with beef stock.

I made this and it was okkkkk but I am not sure it'll go into the main rotation. Instead of the bouillon cubes, i used a can of beef broth and a can of chicken broth. Used a can of tomato sauce instead of soup. It was so thick, I ended up having to add more broth and cooking another 20 minutes in order to get the noodles soft, so I never used the cornstarch.

This was really good!  I'm giving it 4 stars only because it was too salty.  Two bouillon cubes would be more than enough and with 2 cubes it would be five stars.

I gave this five stars simply because its so easy to make and tastes good. I used chicken broth instead of beef bouillon and I also used ground turkey instead of beef. Still great

This was not good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it did thicken up after you let it sit.  But it was way to much italian seasoning  and yet it also tasted watery.  I gave it 2 stars instead of one, because it is edible and I did eat it, but I will NOT be making this again.

I had my doubts I won't lie. made it the first time tonight and I only put one tablespoon Italian seasoning, and next time even less. I also added some garlic salt and Lawry's to taste. I also used a couple table spoons of flour to thicken. paired with some garlic toast and some cheese! yum!

Recipe was soupy and salty as-is.  Made it a second time in the crock pot, and it was awesome:

Browned the ground beef.  Added 1 can tomato soup.  1 beef bouillon cube, 2 cups water, corn starch, onion, garlic, italian season, pepper, and salt to taste.  Add noodles and cook on low for 3-4 hours.

Definitely a hit with the family!  Seven noodles didn't look like enough, so we upped it to 12, could have easily used 14 or more.  Also, used Italian sausage, rather than ground beef, since that's what we had on hand.  Will try beef next time and expect it to be just as good.

Five stars for ease, 4.5 stars for taste. I am a bit amazed that this was as good as it was from all pantry ingredients. I also added a bay leaf (personal preference) while it was simmering.  Previously, I had made the Betty Crocker skillet lasagna dish which is also good. This will be in the running for when I'm tired and don't want to hit the grocery store.  Thanks for a very pleasant surprise.  :)   7-2019 Note to self: 8 oz. elbow macaroni also works well -increase water slightly.

This was really good and my 5 year old liked it too. I added green peppers for more veggies. I always use ground turkey too. Will definitely make again. It was easy enough for my husband to make too. The second time I made it was very bland but I think my problem was using sodium free bouillon.

Made this tonight and my hubby loved it.  I did not have any Italian Seasoning, so I DIYed it.  I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, and I dropped the water down to 3 cups instead.  Did not add cheese.  Made garlic bread with it...it was a good recipe!

This was a huge hit at our house tonight! Hubby, myself and my 2 four years girls who can be picky eaters loved it. The only thing I did differently was instead of adding cornstarch I just added a small can of tomato paste instead and garnished with some fresh shredded Parmesan cheese! Delicious!

We love this recipe! It has become a staple in our menu rotation, my boys ask for it regularly. I will use tomato paste, tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce (whatever i have in the cupboard) and it always turns out wonderful!
