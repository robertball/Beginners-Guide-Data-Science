I hate leaving low star ratings, but I followed the recipe and I’m unable to give this three stars. If I could sum this recipe up it would be “sodium overload”. If I were to make it again, I would reduce the salt and I would also use some herbs to improve the flavor, perhaps toss in some diced, fresh veggies to make it a healthier option.

This was a very easy to make.  There are a few thing I would do different but because of personal taste.  I like a little spice in my life and would probably add some jalapeno.  I also wasn't able to find a traditional biscuit dough so I had to use the layered biscuits which have a lot of sugar.  Maybe I'd bake my own next time.  Ultimately it's a good breakfast or it would be great for Brunch.  Enjoy

This casserole was my hubby’s favorite things combined so we had to try it. I heeded warnings about the salt (I have to believe 4 tsp salt has to be a typo..?? I used as much salt as I’d normally add to scrambled eggs which is likely not even one teaspoon). However I missed the review that said 1/2 hr baking was long enough. So essentiallyafter 45 min the entire bottom was overdone and had to be thrown to the birds :(. The part not over cooked was admittedly tasty. Overall the casserole had great potential but not worth the effort when biscuits and gravy with hash and eggs on a plate would take about 15 min to make.

This was delicious. Both my boys got seconds and my husband even ate some (he is not a fan of hash at all.) I made a few changes. I used 2 cups of gravy instead of 4 - it did a thin cover which worked for us. I could have fixed 2 more (I did instant to save time) but it would have been too much for us. I used 4 eggs instead of 6 as it was all I had on hand and there are only 4 of us. I only cooked it for 35 minutes (after the 5 minutes for the biscuits alone) and it was perfectly done (my oven gets really hot really quickly.) I don't think I'd ever fix it for actual breakfast because of how many dishes it took and I work night shift - I'm just not cleaning that many that early, lol. But for lunch or supper when we want something breakfast-y, it's a perfect meal!

I used 3 1/2 cups of gravy because that is what my mixes made and I only added half the salt. This was delicious, but I think I would use 2 cans of hash next time and maybe add a little onion. The only con was having to make the gravy in a pan and then use another pan to cook the hash, plus mix the egg mixture in a bowl, on top of using a casserole dish to cook it in. A lot of dirty dishes. Usually a casserole makes things easier and less messy. Would make again though. Thank you for sharing   :)

I made this as breakfast for dinner, and it was really good!  I did add in some fire roasted green chili's to the egg mixture to give it a little kick.  My family really enjoyed this comforting meal!
