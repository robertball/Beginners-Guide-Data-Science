I didn’t realize I hadn’t pre-baked the pie shell until the finished pie came out of the oven, meringue beautifully browned, but the crust uncooked...my BIG mistake.  I built a large foil tent over the pie to keep the meringue from totally over browning, bumped up the temp to 375, and then put it back into the oven for 15 more minutes.  Whew, that seemed to work pretty well, even though the meringue ended up a little browner than I'd have liked.  I used fresh raspberries, so I did add just a little water to the pan for some moisture that would have been in there had I used frozen berries.   Raspberry and lemon are two flavors that always partner well, and this pie was no exception.  You have the sweetness from the raspberries and the tartness from the lemons, so each and every bite is pure bliss!  I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site.  Thanks ejm228 for sharing your recipe.

Lemon/ raspberry is my family's absolute favorite combination! Beautiful results! I will admit,I substantially increased the raspberry layer,though. A half a cup would have only been a tiny smear of raspberry. I cooked down two full cups because I always run berries through a fine sieve to de-seed.  Also whipped 4 egg whites instead of 3 for the meringue. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I had to use  1 cup of raspberries and  added another tablespoon of cornstarch, worked great. Cooking time is very short  or it hardens in the pot.
I also used a premade crust and 4 small lemons  
I also used homemade  whipped cream which  tasted amazing.
Great tasting pie over all

Followed recipe as directed and there are a few things worth noting:

1. Using 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries does not go far at all. It's just a teeny smear at the bottom - hardly notice it's there. Try doubling or or tripling that.

2. Directions seem to indicate that the egg yolks are added (unbeaten) while heating the sugar mixture. I added the yolks into the initial sugar mixture, then whisked the contents. The yolks cooked (of course) and little bits were all through the curd. I recommend lightly beating yolks and keep them separate til the curd has thickened. Then add 1/2 cup of the curd mixture to the yolks, whisk together & pour all into curd mixture in the pot. Whisk together and continue following drections.

I made this for a work Pie Baking Contest and won 1st place. I did double the amount of raspberries and I used a homemade pie crust recipe. It is delicious combination of sweet lemon with tart raspberries. A very refreshing dessert for summer.

Love this recipe. It's so beautiful and the raspberries are a delightful surprise flavor.  Use fresh raspberries or frozen. Both are delicious. My family likes a very sour pie so I use about 1/2 to 2/3 C. sugar in the lemon curd with the juice and pulp of 4 lemons. Add more cornstarch if needed to make curd thick as pudding. It will thicken more as pie cools. Like other bakers I increased raspberries to 1C. I make the meringue with about 2 T. sugar. Top the hot lemon curd with meringue from crust edge to crust edge before popping in the oven to brown.

Pie was a huge bit at Thanksgiving. Made one test pie to the recipe. The second one I doubled the amount of raspberries to 1 cup, and strained the seeds out of before adding the cornstarch (which I made into a slurry before adding it).

I have never baked a lemon meringue pie before, which is probably what the first problem was.  I followed the recipe to a T.   It was picture perfect after I took it out of the oven, but the filling turned into liquid and never fully gelled even overnight in the fridge.  I had to throw the whole thing away.  I Googled this problem and read all kinds of solutions - all different.  Like put the meringue on when the filling is hot, or make sure the meringue and the filling are both room temperature.  I don't know.  I guess this is a tough pie to make  and not for beginners.

Very good . Yes i would make it again but less sugar in something. And i would make the lemon curd much differently by using a double boiler . Also more than a half cup of raspberries.

I have made this a few times. The first time, I added more raspberries. The second time, I doubled the raspberries, and that was a bit too much. I will stick to a bit more rather than doubling.

I would never go back to a regular lemon meringue pie! 
I added water to the raspberries and next time I would add more butter and cornstarch  to the lemon but otherwise, this is amazing. And the raspberry makes for a great presentation. Love, love, love.

Really easy recipe 

Don't walk away from your lemon filling !

Cook your crust before beginning and have your ingredients measured out

Makes it much easier

Pretty good flavor but the this recipe is a little tart. Next time I will dilute the lemon juice a little. I also used fresh raspberries so when I added the cornstarch, it all clumped together. I fixed this by adding some water and more raspberries. I/2 cup of raspberries isn’t enough for any substantial layer of a 9” pie anyway. The meringue was good too but I added a little less sugar.

It turned out absolutely beautiful! Not too sweet, but not too sour either. Perfect mixture between raspberry and lemon! On a scale of 1 to 10 on difficulty, I would say probably a 6.

This was really delicious! I used frozen pie crust instead of making from scratch and took the advice of others and doubled/nearly tripled the raspberries. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed it and I would make it again.

This recipe has amazing potential. I wanted it to look like a sunrise inside... but it didn’t turn out quite as expected. I followed the recipe almost as written but for the following three changes:  I doubled the lemon curd to fill a bigger pan (9.5”), I doubled the raspberry layer, and I used the “High Altitude Pie Meringue” recipe from this site.

Tasted great! I would recommend to use more sugar with the raspberries though unless you want a lot of tart flavor!

If you like lemon pie you will love this. The lemon filling is pefect texture and the raspberry  base is yummy.  I did double the raspberry base for more flavor.  My brother in law loved it so much - we each  had one piece and he ate the rest of the pie!
