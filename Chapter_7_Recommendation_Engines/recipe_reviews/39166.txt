This is a wonderfully easy soup. I used squash and rice milk and ground peanuts  and it turned out great. It doesn't take a lot of time to prepare.

This was quite good.  I thought it needed a little extra kick, so I added some cayenne pepper, plenty of salt and pepper, and just a hint of curry powder.  I also garnished with some steamed red chard, which made it pretty to serve.

Nice and easy. Added some extra peanut butter becuase I didn't really taste it with the 1/2 cup. Wife loved it and we'll be making again.

Yum! I served it for friends and they loved it. My 3-year-old even liked it. I didn't have shallots (thought I did), so I threw in an extra clove or two of garlic. It was more like peanut butter soup than pumpkin soup.

I really enjoyed this soup-yummy! I also used pumpkin pie spice and added a tsp of crushed red pepper, to give it some kick. 
Yummy!

I served this at a dinner party and got mixed reviews.  Some did not like the texture, others the flavor.  It was easy but I felt the results were mediocre.

Not a favorite of ours.  A small cup might be good at a dinner party, but I made it for a light supper with bread, and it was just something we didn't want too much of.

Based on other reviews & my own taste preferences, I made the following changes.  This soup is delicious & healthy!

Olive oil instead of butter.  Onion/carrot/celery blend and upped the garlic to 4 cloves.  For spices/herbs, I used 1/2 tsp. Bell's Seasoning, 1/2 tsp. mild curry powder, 1 Tbs. dried parsley, dash of crushed red pepper flakes, salt & pepper to taste.  Four cups low sodium chicken stock.  A can of light coconut milk in place of dairy and 1/2 c. de-fatted peanut flour mixed with 1/4 c. water in place of regular peanut butter - keeps the flavor & protein, but cuts some fat & calories.

Served with brown rice.  Garnished with chopped green onions & a few roasted peanuts.  YUM!

I used all natural peanut butter and, unlike other reviewers I've read, peanut butter was all I tasted.

Served this to five of us and we all loved it. It was easy to fix and they didn't guess the pumpkin (I used fresh from Halloween)in it.Excellent taste.

a while ago, a used this recipe- but now, it has been changed.  How strange is that?
the chicken broth was 3 cups, the lowfat milk was 1 can carnation evaporated lowfat 2%milk and the peanut butter was 1/3 of a cup. Very strange-- so which one does a cook follow?
