I increased recipe by 1/2 and baked in 13x 9 pan.  

I increased eggs to 14, used 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup half half,3 cups frozen shredded potatoes and about 3 cups shredded sharp cheddar.  Instead of ham, I cooked a pound of bacon and crumbled it and did not completely drain the grease.  I also chopped a green pepper and vidalia onion and lightly sauteed in butter.  I think I used about 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.  I generously buttered the 13 x 9 pan before adding ingredients - I covered and refrigerated overnight.  Then took out of refrigerator about 20 minutes before cooking it.  Everyone raved about it - I think sauteed mushrooms would also be good as would drained chili peppers.  Thanks for posting

My family loves this recipe!  I made it more like a western/southwest omelet with lots of sauteed veggies like green pepper, onion and zucchini, and salsa.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese and added some hot pepper cheese to spice it up.  It's a great basic recipe to start with, and then you can add whatever your family likes.  My daughter requests this all the time!

I read all the reviews and decided to sautee 1/4 onion , 1/3 each of green and red peppers and added red pepper flakes.  I baked it in a 9 X 13 pan for about 30 mins or so.  Might try making it with pepper jack cheese with salsa on the side.  Can't wait to try this with sausage.

Excellent breakfast! Can be made and baked the night before and reheated in the morning--perfect for company if you know you'll be rushed in the morning. (I've also made it with 1 cup bacon bits for the meat--very good.) I did add sauteed onion and garlic to it and baked about 10 min. longer. Served with English muffins and jam--tastey! Thanks for sharing.

Nice basic recipe.  I made this for dinner so I added chopped onion, chopped red pepper, more cheeses (a combo of a few) & a few dashes of hot sauce.  I used a 9x13 pan...so used 11 eggs, 2.5 cups of hash browns, 1.5 c. milk & extra of all the rest of ingreds.

Excellent base.  I don't eat ham so omit the meat, add drained spinach or broccoli to the dish and if I have them fresh tomatoes and a touch of basil.  Makes a fantastic Summer Dinner.

Made this late at night & it was EASY and tasty! I was too lazy to put in fresh onions and garlic so used powder and it turned out great as a dinner (strong breath for breakfast!). I don't think there is many ways to mess this one up. Personally, I should have used more ham but it is great for one's own preference. Also, I just peeled potatoes and it only took 1 hour. Thanks!

Very quick and easy.  Next time I might add green peppers and mushrooms.  It's like a potato quiche.

My hubby gets the credit for this one. Not only did I get to sleep in this morning, I woke up to the fabulous smell of this in the oven! He made a few changes though. Used a garlic onion cheese we had in the frig that really helped flavour it up some and used spinach instead of potatos.... plus used more eggs and more milk to make it bigger! Nice and fluffy!

This was good took much longer to cook and i raised temp to 400 after 45min. Outside was dry inside perfect maybe using a thiner pan might cook more evenly. Less hashbrowns would be better in my opinion add some onion or peppers for more flavor.

Made this for lunch today.  Turned out wonderful.  Added spinach, tomatoes and asparagus. Also put most of the hash browns on top of the egg mixture and they got crispy and brown.

Gave it 5 stars as it was perfect for a week away with quilting friends whose diet can't have anything.  I left out the ham. I served with sides of sour cream, salsa, chopped green onions, tomatoes, and bacon crumbled.  Served with toasted plain bagels, cream cheese, and jalopena jam on top of cream cheese. What a hit. Everyone could choose their own poison.  They loved it.

Very tasty! I'd never made anything like this before, and was wary of using all those eggs. It came out perfectly! Next time, to cut back on fat/calories/cholestorol, I will probably use 4 egg whites and 4 eggs. :) Otherwise, no changes needed! Yummy and even good as leftovers!

I made it for dinner and it was a hit.  I added a little pre-cooked chopped onion and used cubed hashbrowns instead of shredded.  I liked it as is, my daughter put catsup on it and my husband used salsa.  It took about an hour to bake, though. Very quick and easy to make.

I added a pound of sausage browned and than added to the eggs. Than I shredded potatoes and seasoned them with salt and garlic and fried them for about 2 minutes in the same pan that I fried the sausage in, than added the potatoes and sausage grease into the eggs. When it was done I added a little salsa for a little extra pizazz.  I was a little worried that I made too much but my brother (the super critical eater) ate half by himself.

This recipe provides for a base upon which other flavours can attained.  For example, I have done this recipe and replaced the ham with chorizo sausage, diced peppers and onion.  When whisking the eggs, I usually put in a couple dashes of chipotle sauce.  It can take on different flavours by varying the items you use.  But as stated, this recipe remains the foundation upon which other creations are built.

This was excellent. I used more cheese than it called for and added some roasted garlic cheddar as well. This tasted just like a western omelet. Would be excellent with sauteed mushrooms. We had it for dinner last night and I just had a piece for breakfast, perfect!

Great recipe! I used low fat cheese and added extra ham (personal preferance) and green onions. I also used southern style hash browns, which are diced rather than shredded and browned them prior to adding them. Very good and verey easy. A keeper! I look foward to trying this with different types of meats, cheeses and veggies. The possibilities are endless!Maybe next time I will try it with green chilis and pepperjack cheese...yum!

I made no nodifications to this recipe and it was ok (but has great potential!). I enjoy a little more flavor so next time I'll be sure to add onion, mushrooms and peppers.

this was great with a few tweaks!  i didn't have any prepared hash browns so i grated 2 large red potatoes into the eggs, used 1/2 lb of bacon (browned and crumbled) instead of ham, and included a sauteed onion and green pepper---turned out terrific!  thank you!!

Sooo good!  This recipe reminded me so much of my mom's oven omelet, I served it for dinner and my boyfriend loved it!  For added flavor and spice I added one roaster jalopeno pepper, one small cooking onion, (sauted), a hand full off button mushrooms, (sauted), and used seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  Will definately make this again! Thanks for posting this recipe!

My family loved this dish!  I made this recipe over many others because of the lower fat content (still had 18g), however, I added scrambled sausage, potatoes w/ onions & red/green peppers, 2 cups cheese & 2 additional eggs.  I cooked it in a 9x13 dish & it was a hit!

This is a great recipe! I used bacon instead of ham and added some garlic and fresh cilantro... it's easy to 1/2 the recipe again and use a 9x13 pan. The eggs were light and fluffy and everyone at my house thought they were great!

I had some left-over ham that I used in this "breakfast for dinner" dish.  I also used country style cubed frozen potatoes with red and green peppers already in them.  It turned out delicious.  I think some diced onion and garlic, as well as broccoli or spinach,  would take it up another notch.

A hearty breakfast/brunch dish.  Experimenting with various cheeses can be rewarding.  Reccipe is easy to double in a 9X13" pan.  Great fo church potlucks- so good I think "they licked the platter clean"!  Misleading label of "omelet" but delicious no matter what you call it.

Great way to use leftover ham from Thanksgiving dinner. To give a little pick up use shredded hash browns from Simply Potatoes which include green peppers and onions.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This turned out very well, but I did alter it quite a bit. Left out the ham, added sauteed red onion, red and green bell peppers, and about a tsp of tarragon. Baked for 55 minutes in my slow oven and served with cornbread, bacon and fruit salad for a delicious breakfast for dinner meal. Thanks!

I forgot to rate this recipe when I first tried it, so I made it again 2 days ago and thought it tasted OK, but it was bland. No wonder I didn't remember I had already tried it. It wasn't so memorable. I think it needs more ingredients so it can give some flavor. It kind of has potential to be better.

We really liked this---I added some chopped jalapenos and some of the jalapeno juice (cut back a little on the milk) and that was a big plus.  Gave it a zing.

This was really good.  I used ground sausage which I cooked with some chopped onion.  I used 1 cup of Southwestern hashbrowns in the mixture and added a little more cheese.  I poured it into an 8 1/2" round pie plate and topped with the remaining hashbrowns.  Baked for a little over an hour (checking it at 45 min and again at 60 min by inserting a knife into the center) before the knife came out clean.  It froze well too.  I can take a slice to work for breakfast or lunch!!

Good base recipe.  I made just a few minor changes; added a bit of onion to it and layered the hashbrowns, ham and cheese in the pan and poured the egg mixture over it.  Family really enjoyed it.

This wasn't great, but, good.  Only down side, using frozen hashbrowns instead of thawed hashbrowns resulted in the oven for another 35 minutes.

This was excellent!  What I love is that you can add whatever you want!  I added sautéed onions, mushrooms and broccoli!  I sprinkled some shredded cheese on top before baking it in a 9 x 13 glass pan for 50 minutes and it came out perfect!  We will definiately be making this again on a regular basis!  :)

I love the ease and versatility of this recipe. I am vegetarian so I am always substituting ingredients. This is a no-fail recipe that comes out great all the time. I use 4 cups of whatever veggies I have on hand and veggie breakfast sausage too.

Easy omelet...I did cut it in half and it was enough for 3 people along with fruit and cinnamon rolls...We had it for dinner...so I added mushrooms and broccoli and used Swiss cheese which is our favorite cheese for dishes like this! This is a keeper!

I made this for my husband.  He loves ham, eggs and potoes.  So hey - this recipes has all 3 of them.  Guess what - he liked it.  Oh yeah - I did add strips of bacon ontop.  He loves bacon too!  I recommend cooking this on the top rack in the oven.

Could've used a little more flavor . . . maybe some hot sauce? Definately needed to cook longer than instructed. It's more like 60 minutes.

My family loved this and its very filling -and very easy to make.  We used to pre-cut southern style hash browns and we tripled the recipe -but did not need it!  It was so filling, we have enough for dinner tonight!  Definitely recommend and it definitely gets added to the recipe box.

This is a GREAT base recipe.  I added chopped red pepper and green onions.  You can add just about anything to the recipe and it still will be a meal.  Hubby loved it and wants me to make it again tomorrow morning.

This has been our Christmas morning breakfast tradition for years now. Its everything you want for breakfast all in one. I usually double the recipe, add red chili flake and sprinkle paprika on top for color. I've made it with precooked ham, bacon or sausage and its always a hit! Note on baking dish, its better to go wider and flatter and slightly reduce cooking time than going deeper. Its harder to cook evenly if its too thick.

I sauteed 1/2 an onion and that is the only addition that I made. This was fantastic. The kiddies like it for breakfast too! I used bacon only because I had no ham on hand. Will add this to my favourites for sure!

Added a package of frozen onions and peppers and eliminated the ham. Everything else was the same as original recipe. I microwaved the peppers and onions so they would be hot and removed the excess liquid before combining with the eggs. It took almost 40 extra minutes to bake and Hubby said, "Don't make this again!" Used this recipe because of the almost 5 stars. Nothing great. My first "eehhh" rating! This dish reminded me of someone learning to cook. No great flavors, nothing spectacular.

This was great stuff. I made it exactly as written. (The pepper was ground white pepper, and the cheese was mild cheddar.) I baked it for the full 50 minutes and it still slightly failed the knife test, but I was pretty hungry by that point so I took it out. It tasted very good the first day, and the reheated leftovers the next 3 days may have tasted even better, I think. I can see how other reviewers thought it might taste a little bland - not many spices here. But I also agree that it can be a good base for additions and changes. As is, I'll give it 4 stars, and I will probably make it again soon.

I made a half recipe, reducing the milk to 1/4 cup (that was accidental, but it worked!) and baked it in a 5x8 glass baking pan.  I used thawed O'Brien potatoes and added 1 tsp dry mustard and a little thyme.  I also sprinkled a little extra cheese over the top before baking.  It took about 40 minutes to bake.  It's very good and easy to put together--it'll be a regular weekend breakfast in our house!

My family eat the whole dish for dinner last night. I added 2 more eggs sauteed onions and x-tra cheese. I found my dish to stick yo the bottom of the pan even witha spray of pam.  I will cook it for 10 less minutes next time. Over all a great dish for the kids and my husband.

Great recipe!  I added red and green peppers and substituted sausage for the ham.  I doubled this recipe for work and also served at a brunch for 21 people.  Rave reviews from all.

This was very easy to make.  It was very tastey too!!!  The recipe says that it could take up to 50 mins to cook.  It took us just over an hour to bake it.  After 45 mins, there were still too much liquid from the egg.  After pulling it from the oven, we let it stand for about 15-20 mins.  Letting it stand, really helped dry up the rest of the liquid.  We can't wait to try it with sausage or bacon next time! =)

Slightly bland for me personally- I would use a cheese with more kick- maybe a Monterey Jack ? Add some onion maybe. HOWEVER my VERY picky 2 and 3 year old and my husband devoured it and LOVED it. Great basic just need to tailor to your own taste. Very good. Made it for a quick dinner with a green salad.

I made a different version - instead of ham and cheddar cheese I made it with sausage links, pepperjack cheese and added mushrooms.  It was delicious!

I used this recipe as the basis for my oven omelette-no hash brown, no ham.  I split some grape tomatoes and added grated fresh Parmesan cheese along with the cheddar cheese to make this work for my 93 year old vegetarian mother who watches her weight.  She was quite happy with the result.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was good, not great.  I added some sauteed garlic and onion and broccoli along with some seasonings but it was still a bit bland.  The potatoes were mushy and I don't think they add a lot to the end result.  Maybe I will make them into some crispy hash browns and serve them on the side next time.  I will definitely make this again with some experimenting on ingredients and making it more flavorful.

This recipe is really good.  I have the exact same one except mine calls for hash brown patties to be placed on the bottom.  Sometimes I add some cut up jalapeños to give it a little kick.

Perfect for using up Christmas leftovers.  I cut up leftover ham and new potatoes, and added a fried onion and can of sliced mushrooms.  Baked in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes.  Fed 8 of us!

This is a wonderful and simple recipe.  I am not much of a cook, but I have easily adjusted it when necessary.  Although, I make mine in a 9x13 pan and it works perfectly.  Of course, I don't measure everything out precisely either.  Try cooked bacon pieces instead of ham, too.

We made this for 50 and it received excellent reviews from the people. However, it seemed to have too much bread and too little cheese, so I would recommend reducing the bread so that the cheese flavor and consistency will be much more noticeable. When I got a forkful of cheese and egg with a little bit of bread, it was wonderful.
