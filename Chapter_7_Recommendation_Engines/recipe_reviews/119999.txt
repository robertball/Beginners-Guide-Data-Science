i made this soup as the first course of a birthday dinner for a friend.  after i saw on another webpage the exact same recipe and i was by bon appetit, i decided on this recipe.  the only difference in recipes was this one calles for 2 garlic cloves and fresh herbs.  i used the fresh herbs, but roasted a whole garlic head and added that in.  i also used a homemade vegetarian stock since my friend is a vegetarian and it is low in sodium but tasty.  this soup was a big hit, and after making to-go bowls, there wasn't any left.  i made it again for my grandma and family during the holidays and again they loved it.  also i used an immersion blender rather than blending it.  it was a good soup.  i prefer it with crackers than a crusty bread.  if you like corn (and who doesn't), this soup will be a hit.

This was decent.  If you are using fresh rosemary it makes more sense to add it later in the cooking process instead of at the beginning.

This soup was really delicious.  I used an immersion blender while the soup was still hot, rather than waiting for it to cool and transferring it to a blender.  It would be great with crab added to it!

I thought this soup was very tasty!  It was my first experience with making a corn based soup and I was very pleased.  It's a great use of all of that fresh CSA corn that keeps finding it way into my house this summer.

I cheated a bit to make things easier.  I lieu of blenderizing the hot corn soup.  I cooked the full kernels in the soup and blenderized the remaining kernels which I added to the soup with the sauteed peppers. :D

The amount of salt I added to this recipe was 1 Tablespoon, and that amount was just right for me.

Outstanding. The only thing I changed was sauteing the the vegetables on low for a good 1/2 hour or so to caramelize (there's a good chance I added more cayenne as well). I love corn and creamy soups, this soup was perfect for me.

DELICIOUS! Every time I make this I am asked for the recipe. Soon all of Cairo will be making this yummy soup! I use oil instead of butter and skim milk instead of half and half so it's much lighter, but still delicious! Thanks for passing on the recipe Thelma!

really loved this soup, added a small zucchini i found in my fridge to get rid of it so I'm guessing you can probably add a few other veggies for added nutrition if you want without changing the flavor

I served this soup as the first course for Christmas dinner and it was the star of the meal.  My husband went in for leftovers of it the next day and told me I'd better have some before he eats it all.  I highly recommend this soup.

I thought the soup was good and very creamy, thought I subsituted the 1/2 & 1/2 with regular milk. However, my family hated the taste of rosemary with the chowder. DS suggest making the soup again without the rosemary.

My absolute favorite corn soup recipe.  Love the rosemary!  I really appreciate that the soup is not potato-based.  I plan to always double this recipe!

I made this soup for Christmas dinner with my mom in mind.  She is on a liquid diet due to cancer in her neck.  I omitted the second batch of corn and it was just perfect for her.  I added some Sriracha instead of powdered spice for the rest of the family and they just raved about it.  I also cooked the red pepper til they started to brown a little in the skillet, it added nice flavor.

Next time I would probably only use 1 cup onion instead of 2. I also added diced chicken. Yum. :)

My 13 year old made this as part of his summer "learning to cook" plan.  We left out the red peppers since he won't eat them, but this soup was very good!  He accidentally added a little more cajun seasoning than he intended, and it was GREAT with the extra kick.  So easy a 13 y.o. can make it!

The soup was very easy to make, but unfortunately I wasn't a fan of the strong rosemary flavor. My boyfriend, however, loved it and I will definitely make this for him again in the future.

My 9 year old gave it a 5. My husband thought it was good as well but wanted me to add chicken or ham next time we make it. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe!  The soup has a good depth of flavour.  I doubled the cayenne to give it a kick, but the spice was still muted.  Go easy on the salt, since there's lots in the broth. Delicious!

I was quite surprised.  It had a great taste; I just wished that I had served it with Turkey or Ham.  Great for Thanksgiving!
