When I became vegan a few years back, I found this recipe and it was a life-saver since I love chocolate desserts.  I have tweaked it, though.  Instead of putting the pie into a graham cracker crust, I usually use a chocolae cookie crust (there are vegan versions).  I also add 1/2 a carton of Tofutti imitation cream cheese to the tofu because it makes the flavor and texture more closely resemble chocolate cheesecake.  Let's face it -- this pie is too solid and heavy to ever compete as a faux chocolate cream pie, but it can compete very nicely as a faux chocolate cheesecake.  I layer the top with sliced strawberries and tell people it is a "strawberry chocolate cheesecake."  Sometimes I make it without sugar (using 2 tablespoons of stevia extract instead) but that can have a slightly bitter taste.  I don't mind, but for company I usually just cut the sugar in half (1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon stevia extract) and I think this is indistinguishable from using all sugar.

I tried this twice, using 4 ounces of melted bittersweet chocolate instead of the cocoa.  If I had rated it the first time, it would have received only 1 star!.  First off, use a food processor only.  I know the recipe says "electric mixer" but the mixer didn't blend the tofu properly and the pie came out grainy.  Also, I used  Pillsbury pie crusts.  The first time the crust came out a little soggy.  Finally, be sure you have "silken" tofu.  "Soft" won't blend smoothly. I ate the pie anyway, but it took a lot of Cool Whip!  

On the second try, I used silken tofu from the dairy case and blended everything in the food processor.  While the filling was being assembled, I slightly pre-baked the crust.  While still not quite as smooth as real chocolate cream pie, it was much better, especially if you are lactose-intolerant and can't have the real thing. 

Might be interesting to try this with a meringue topping.

This is fantastic!  Use soft silken tofu for the a creamy pie.  Next time I am probably going to use semi-sweet chocolate and less sugar to avoid the slightly bitter taste unsweetened chocolate gives the pie.

Loved it, got my anti-tofu friends and family to eat their words!  I did try to sub the sugar with all Splenda in one pie (it was awful, don't be tempted) and then I tried 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda and that was excellent.  I served it with some toasted walnuts and fat free cool whip and made a low fat graham cracker crust.  No guilt, lots of flavor.  Thanks!

G'day from sunny Australia! Yummy yum yum!! I made this recipe today for a vegan friend (we're very carnivourous in our household). I read all the reviews carefully; the best suggestions 1. Use splenda it takes away the bitter choc /tofu taste(but only use half as much as the recipie asks for otherwise it's too sweet) 2. food processor makes a lovely smooth pie, 3. Omit the vinegar.Thanks for the tips! I added a splash of "Baileys" which made it quite rich but good :) Also made a cheesecake base with vegan coconut cookies and vegan butter. Finally toppped with fresh rasperries and strawberries (it's summer here) and a scoop of vanilla soy ice cream. A perfect chocolatley dessert!!

This was so easy and very very yummy!  It is the best when it is completly cold from the fridge which took longer than an hour after cooking.  Make sure you use silken tofu because regular tofu will make it grainy.

Yum! I used my kitchen aid which didn't quite smooth out the tofu, but the flavor is awesome!  Will definitely try again with a blender.

Pie had a very grainy texture and was quite bitter, whipped cream could not save it.

OK, mabye a little less sugar. Man it is rich. I am not even close to being vegan. My fiancé is and I wanted to find something good for her. I have never had a better chocolate pie than this. She said it was so good it gave her a chocolate fix for a year. Not being vegan I can honestly tell you NOBODY will ever know there is tofu in this (vegan or not) unless you tell them. I would give it 6 stars out of 6!!

This recipe was easy, but it was unclear about what texture of tofu to use. The taste is very bitter. With alot of whip cream, it's more enjoyable.

I've been a vegan for 34 years, and have baked many, many pies and cakes, but I have to say that this was one of the best.   I made one change to the recipe, using extra firm tofu to make the filling more like fudge. I wanted something to approximate my mom's fudge pies that she made when I was a kid and this one fills the bill. Even my non vegan husband ate 2 slices.

Great Pie!  Amazing creaminess out of the food processor.  Everyone loved it and this one will be on our favorite lists for a long time. If only you didn't have to wait for it to chill!

This was wonderful!  I omitted the cider vinegar and cracker crust.  I also used splenda in place of sugar.  To me it didn't look like there was enough filling for the pie pan I had so I lined a small loaf pan with tinfoil and lightly sprayed with cooking spray.  Due to the pan size, I increased the cooking time by 10 min.  I let it set up in the refrigerator the night before serving.  Very rich and chocolately.  It tastes just like chocolate pudding.  Next time I may double the recipe and make it in a springform pan.

Easy and delicious! I melted four squares of unsweetened chocolate, 12 oz. of tofu and 3/4 c. of brown sugar. It was just right, definitely a keeper.

Pretty easy and tasty!  I got a bunch of silken tofu packages on sale for 99 cents, so I had to figure out how to use them.  I had all the ingredients in the house to make this.  I only used 12 oz box of tofu instead of 16 oz (didn't want to open an extra box to use part of it) and it still worked fine.  The chocolate/tofu mixture is really good, probably could eat it just like that or bake in custard cups minus the crust.  When pie is totally cooled it will slice much easier.  I would make this again.  I'm also lactose intolerant, so even better for me.

I would recommend processing the tofu first before adding the cocoa and sugar. I want to give it 4 stars, but only the vegans at our Thanksgiving loved it. Everyone else thought it was 'o.k.'

make sure to use a food processor or blender to get it blended. It is very runny, but don't worry, it firms up nicely once baked. Be sure to bake it on the lower portion of the oven for 25 mins. or it will not firm up. A nice alternative for ppl. with dairy allergies.

I served this for a group of ladies, of which only one was dairy intolerant.  Everyone loved it...especially the choc-o-holics.  I was concerned about the bitter flavor mentioned and didn't have time for a testrun, so this is what I did:
The silken tofu comes in 12 oz, so I used 2 12 oz packages in a deep dish pie (marie calendar's which I pre-baked about 5 minutes).  
I replaced the cocoa with 4 oz bittersweet bakers choc and added 2 T of cocoa to make up for the extra tofu).  Kept 1 cup sugar.  Forgot vanilla.  Added no vinegar.
It was a hit.  Easy to make (just took a few minutes with the food processor)

Wow!  THIS is tofu???  I am a fan of dark chocolate.  I used Sharfenberger's cocoa, and I used white sugar.  While I think this IS sweet, it's also amazingly delicious! So I will eat smaller pieces (which I should anyway) and top it off with fat free cool whip.  yum I don't understand what the vinegar is for, but I used it and there's no odd taste.  This is very good.  Thanks for the tips!

This recipe is amazingly fast and yummy.  We ignored the crust and used something called bead curd pudding which whipped up beautifully.  We used "ruddy cocoa" which is rich and of high quality.  Too impatient for cooling we poured it over bananas and discovered it made a yummy hot sauce.  I would made it again but if I wanted it to set properly I would use a stiffer tofu (what the recipe actually suggested).  Because I find that tofu and chocolate can be bitter I chose not to add any sour (i.e. the vinegar).

This recipe is incredible!! I even substituted Splenda for the sugar and it tasted great. By the way when using Splenda it knocks 90 calories off each serving.

This is a great basic recipe with lots of room for experiment. Instead of chocolate (or with chocolate) add peanut butter in the food processor! forget the chocolate and add coconut. I Halved the sugar and didn't miss it at all. also, for a richer experience...add canola oil as you process. Not recommended for mixer.

Absolutely delicious!! I am lactose intolerant and rarely find a treat as rich as this. I loved the smooth texture and the great chocolate taste. It was really super-thick and almost too rich, but I still loved it. I am curious how this would work if you semi froze it?   I tried to blend it in the blender, but it was too thick, the electric mixer didn't beat it smooth enough, so I finally scooped it in the FOOD PROCESSOR and it turned out perfect! I, my kids and my husband love, love, LOVE this pie!!

I LOVE this recipe!! I have made it twice and both times it was a huge hit. I didn't have the vinegar either time and it turned out fine. Also, if you want a low-fat version, you can make it as a kind of pudding and just not use a crust. That's good too.

I thought this turned out incredible! I did not use the cider, but added coffee liquor instead. I didn't have a problem with the texture, but I made sure that I bought the Silken Tofu sold in a box. I bought the firm. I don't think I would ever make a chocolate pie any other way. Everyone who tried this loved it too and never would have guessed it was made with tofu.

Great recipe! I am always looking for vegan desserts, and this did not disappoint. I added a little more than a cup of organic white sugar because I read that some found it bitter. I didn't think it was bitter at all - delicious!

I give this 5 stars not only because it is guilt free, but because it tastes AWESOME too! It's very rich and I didn't think the cocoa made it too bitter. I like that dark taste. It's even more delicious the next day. I think I've ate half the pie by myself, lol. I paired the pie with the Healthier Graham Cracker Crust recipe from the site. I'm going to make another one today. =) Thank you so much for such a delicious recipe!

The only reason I give this a 4 is because I live in Taiwan and it was difficult to figure out how many packages of tofu to use, and then I only have a tiny little mixer that is actually for smoothies, so the whole process of making it took me about an hour! I put in a 1/4 cup less sugar, and after tasting the batter I felt like it could be more chocolately, so I sprinkled chocolate chips on the bottom of the crust before pouring the batter in. I am not sure if I will be able to fool my anti-tofu friends with this, but I will certainly try!

My husband loves this recipe and has requested it many times.  No one knows it is tofu, unless I tell them.  I have made it with some almond extract as well and this has been well received by my family.

Extremely easy to make and very yummy! I omitted the vanilla and cider vinegar since I didn't have them on hand, and threw in a handful of chocolate chips.

Rich and delicious!  I would not have known it contained tofu.  I followed others' suggestions and cut the sugar in half and omitted the vinegar.  I used a regular pie crust instead of graham cracker, and that worked great except that my crust was deep-dish and there wasn't really enough filling for it.  Use a regular crust, not deep-dish.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is delicious, just the way it is.  (I think you can also reduce the sugar a touch if you want.)  I do a lot of dairy-free cooking, and it fills the creamy chocolate void perfectly.  I make it a lot as a pudding, omitting the pie crust.  Most of the mix doesn't make it to the oven, and it never lasts long.  My kids, all under 5, LOVE it and it's a great way to introduce tofu as a non-scary food (which was never done for me!).

I am not the typical chocolate fan, but loved how this pie turned out.  To have a richer flavor, I used dark ground unsweetened chocolate.  To simulate a fudge pudding consistency, ensure majority of the water is drained from the tofu.  I skipped the apple cider and used fine baker's sugar instead of the regular granulated sugar.

A nice recipe but WAY too sweet for me... and I love sweets! I would suggest cutting the sugar down by half and tasting the batter as you blend to see if it is OK to you so you won't get a huge shock of sweetness like my husband and I did!

I made this pie twice.  While eating the first I saw how fast my family was devouring it so I went back to the store for another graham pie crust and made another one.  It vanished quickly too!  This will definitely be a regular on our menu!

The fact that this is tofu and you can't tell earns it a five star rating. I was worried due to mixed reviews - it's really amazing! I stuck with the graham cracker crust, left out the cider and threw in some chocolate chips and sweetened coconut flakes. No whipped. It's ridiculously easy and super delicious!!

I followed this recipe for the pie filling exactly and it was AWFUL!  (I did substitute a pastry crust for the graham cracker one.)  My husband and I are vegetarians and no stranger to tofu but we both thought that this pie was too sweet and the tofu aftertaste was too pronounced.  I had such high hopes but we ended up throwing it out after one slice.

Wow! Great recipe! I'm going to try using vegan chocolate rather than the cocoa powder next time, it will be a bit creamier.  I'll let you all know how it turns out.  I also used a whole wheat crust instead of graham cracker crust.  I'm not sure if the brand I bought was 'vegan' but I will check next time.

Pie was okay.  I found it a bit bitter. Used a chocolate crust as well.  Easy to make.  Next time will add more sugar and perhaps some peanut butter!

Made this just for a vegan friend who came to a dinner party at my house a few months ago. Even the non-vegans loved it! I used regular tofu because I couldn't find silken - glad it didn't ruin the pie. I'll definitely make this again any time a vegan comes over.

HE HE !! Fooled my guys with this. I have only worked with tofu 1 time before and that was oohh about 9 years ago and that was enough to scare us all away....until now! I was very leary to try it but it worked. Very nice pie for sure. Nobody knows my little secret about this pie and they never will. :) I wrote the measurements down then tore it up when I was done to ensure they would not see it! I had some Silken on hand and glad I did...very smooth. The only things I did different was I used half splenda and half sugar and added almond extract along with the vanilla. Nice but I think I used too much. Will tone it down next time and maybe make a double batch so as to filll the shell more. Will make again! Thank you for this.

Although I may not call it a "dead ringer" for chocolate pie, it was still quite good.  I omitted the vinegar and added chopped nuts and it turned out great. I agree that it should be chilled and would go so far as to say that it is better the next day.

This was surprisingly great! My boyfriend and I were hosting friends for dinner and one is a vegan, so on a whim I decided to try this pie. We didn't have high hopes for it but it came out SO. GOOD. It tastes like a chocolate fudge filling. I don't own a large food processor so I didn't blend my tofu down as well as I should have and it still turned out fine. I used semi-firm tofu too since that's all my grocery store had. I tossed in a few drops of almond flavoring to the batter and it gave a nice richness; I think it would be AMAZING with cherry or raspberry flavoring. 

This is good for a dessert, not just "good for a vegan dessert".

Well, it's not bad, but to say it compares to a regular chocolate pie is a BIG stretch.  People might not guess that it's tofu, but they are definitely not going to think it's a regular chocolate pie either.  I may make it again, but overall, I was pretty disappointed considering all the rave reviews.  I was expecting something much more rich and chocolatey.

I've never cooked with tofu before so I was a little intimidated. But, there was no need to be. Simply easy and delicious! I made this for a vegan friend. She loved it! If I hadn't mentioned what was in it my carnivorous friends probably would've loved it too!

Even my Tofu hating hubby likes this pie! I don't make it vegan though as I add 1/2 package of cream cheese to thicken it up and tone down the cocoa powder.

Everybody tweeks this their own way. I used the recipe without the apple cider vinegar and it came out pretty decent. Just less sugar for me next time.

I made this last night and is it decadent and so very EASY. The only thing I changed was that I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 Splenda, and omitted the crust (out of sheer laziness on my part)  Now I'll never again have a problem using up my silken tofu.

With some work, this could be good. Mine took much more than 1 hour after cooking to reach a firm texture, even had to stick it in the freezer. Personally, I found this to be pretty gross (bitter), & I usually love tofu treats. The vegans who ate this thought it was GREAT- it was gone in a flash. However, it's just missing something. I think I'll add toffuti cream cheese & add something to even out the chocolate taste. I did use 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 splenda, but I'm quite sure that wasn't the problem. Will make again in the future with some adjustments.

This completely failed for me. It didn't solidify, so I ended up with pudding, which didn't look too appetizing to me.

Bleck. I didn't like the texture or the flavor. I couldn't taste the soy, but that wasn't enough to redeem this recipe for me.

This was okay.  It came out kind of soggy, but had a good flavor.  Would probably make some adjustments if I made it again.

I've made this twice now w\ the Silken tofu & a regular pastry crust instead of the graham one.  It does not last long at our home! I tried to make it completely vegan by not adding the whipped cream...however it just seems to need the the topping to give it a better layer of flavor.  So, now trying to find a good recipe for TRUE non-dairy whipped topping. This is a neat recipe that can be modified in various ways to make it more interesting. I will definitely keep making this one.

I've made this three times so far and I love it. I cut the sugar in half though; one cup's way too much. I can also say that you don't need food processors or anything - I break up everything manually using a whisk. It doesn't take all that long, either. When it comes out, oh so scrumptious!

Wasn't sure how firm this pie was meant to be, but mine came out pretty soft. Its also very, very sweet, maybe less cocoa and sugar next...

I also put coconut in mine for a bit of texture! Still an awesome pie. It was my first time using silken tofu!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I thought the texture was wonderful.  But I thought it was too sweet with a weird, bitter aftertaste.

I have made this many times for my vegan daughter with food allergies.  I love that it’s a desert with a large amount of protein.  I usually make this in an Oreo crust.  I don’t have a food processor and found it very awkward in my blender so use an Immersion Blender.  It works great.  I often substitute maple syrup or vanilla flavoring syrup for part of the vanilla/sugar. Cut the sugar back to two tablespoons.  We do not like the texture when adding chips or cookies to the filling but they do fine added on top before serving the chilled pie.  I sometimes cut back on the sugar to make it better for the adults.  This pie has been eaten by several folks who HATE tofu. The trick with getting the texture right is blending until the mix looks bubbly and baking an extra 5 minutes.

I am a vegan. I absolutely love this chocolate tofu pie!  I had substitutes but would not think they made any significant difference. On hand, I had and used soft tofu; I used brown sugar; I "creamed" the tofu in a food processor (it was very smooth); and I made my own graham crackers (recipe in Allrecipes) for the crust.  Yum!

This pie was ok. I used firm, and it didn't come out as super smooth as I would have liked.  Because it was so thick, it would not combine in my blender.  So I added 1/4 c. half & half, plus one egg, to get it to whir in the blender.  It took about 45 minutes to bake with the added moisture from the half & half and the egg, but came out of the oven looking beautiful.  I topped it with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  My family felt it was not sweet enough; too much dark chocolate flavor.  (If you like that kind of chocolate pie, then this would be great for you.)

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 tsp. of stevia. I used my blender and after making sure it was really well blended I did taste for sweetness and was very pleased. I used an organic cocoa powder and will go back to my Hershey's cocoa from now on. I taste tested the two cocoas after the fact and the organic lacked chocolate flavor. I used a deep dish graham cracker crust and since I will be need to prepare two pies next time I will make three times the amount so my pies are fuller. I did a blind taste test with an individual who would never have even tried it if it was known what was in it. The only comment was it needed to be a little more chocolate flavored. Also, I intend to serve this with sliced strawberries for the guests. GREAT recipe!
