I drink a lot of smoothies and when using oatmeal in them, the first thing I do is grind the oats into a powder in the blender (incorporates better into the rest of the ingredients),  then add the rest of the ingredients.  I keep about a half dozen pasteurized eggs on hand because I do like them in the smoothies, so I used one of them for this smoothie.  My strawberries were really sweet, so I added just a bit of sugar, used skim milk, and added a lot of crushed ice (I like a thicker texture).  Dianaa_, this was very good, and will be put into my breakfast and afternoon smoothie rotation.

I made this with just the milk, strawberries, and oats it was rather tasty. Since I have access to farm fresh eggs I made it another time with the raw egg called for and it kinda tasted a little like an eggnog but without the normal spices eggnog uses. I didn't care for it with the raw egg, I thought the combination of it with strawberries was not complimentary.

great recipe for breakfast! i didnt have strawberries so i substituted blackberries instead. the egg was barely noticable in the taste and i added two packets of stevia sweetener as the cup of sugar would have been too sweet.

Way too sweet. Too much sugar in this recipe. My daughter picked and made this recipe but nobody could drink it.
