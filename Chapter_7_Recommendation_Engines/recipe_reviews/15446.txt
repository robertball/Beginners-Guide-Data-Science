This recipe is a good twist if you are not in the mood for the same old 3 bean salad.  I brought this to a potluck bbq and almost everyone went back for thirds of this dish until it was gone.

Very versatile dish- I substitued cannellini beans because I did not have butter beans on hand and I also used marinated artichoke hearts instead. If you don't have the marinated artichokes on hand you could just add a small clove of garlic crushed to the dressing for added flavor. You could really play with the ingredients on this one to suit your tastes! Excellent flavor!

This is an excellent quick choice!  Made it for a picnic at my in-laws and it was a big hit.
Didn't spice it up like I normally would have (little more salt-n-pepper and hotter mustard)
but it turned out just perfect to serve to a variety of people. I also added mushrooms, and some wax beans.
Overall, great!

This turned out great. I used fresh string beans and omitted the salt.  I also rinsed all the canned beans to reduce the salt.  It was refreshing and very light

I loved the preparation...pop open a few cans and mix it all up.  However, it's missing...something.  I couldn't figure it out, but playing around with spices might definitely improve this recipe

This was an unusual bean salad and worth a try.  Some people really loved it, including my husband.

Did not look all that appetizing, I love the dressing but I couldn't fix the presentation. The Butter beans seemed to have made it mushy.  would probably try wax beans next time.

This recipe was great, but we did make a few changes (mostly due to ingredients we had at home). We substituted wax beans for the butter beans, omitted the mustard, and also put in some garbanzo beans, hominy, feta cheese, and roasted bell peppers. Absolutely fabulous!

This is a great salad!  I used fresh beans for a nice, snappy flavor.  The mustard makes this dish, so use a good one!

I made this recipe for a recent BBQ i attended, and the salad was a hit!  I just swapped roasted red peppers for the artichokes because they were not at my grocery store. Very light and not sweet, like typical bean salads are. I even got a compliment from one person, saying he loved it because it did not have too many kidney beans in it, like other bean salads he had tried.  I would defintiely make this simple, easy, fast recipe again!

This is a great salad, but I found the original recipe to be a little bland.  I added some roasted red pepper and minced red onion for color.  Also, I added some fresh basil and minced garlic to the dressing.  Terrific for summer.

This is different and tasty. Maybe the kind of mustard I used was unusually sour, but I needed to add a teaspoon or so of sugar to rescue the dressing. Tried it with a few good sprinkles of tarragon, and that made it even better.

I love artichokes and had them in my pantry.  Perfect timing because this recipe is great.

The lemon juice really makes a nice change to the usual vinegar in bean salads. I reduced the oil to 3T and felt it could even be a little less. I used edamame instead of butter beans - very nice, adds protein and color. I threw ina little chopped fresh red peer for crunch, color and increased nutrients and used small white beans instead of kidney. Needed a good bit of salt and pepper, perhaps because I didn't have mustard on hand. All swappable! My friends enjoyed it.

Refreshing and delicious!  I didnâ€™t have butter beans so I replaced them with chick peas.  I also added half a red bell pepper diced.  For the mustard I used Dijon Mustard!

I thought this was bland tasting.  Won't make it again without pumping up the flavours somehow.

Very mixed reviews in my house.   I thought it was a nice twist on a traditional sweet three bean salad.  It is tangy and tart and a nice complement to the artichokes.  My husband did not care for it at all and thought it was too acidic and needed some sweetness.
