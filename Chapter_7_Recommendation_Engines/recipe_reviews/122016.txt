Very tasty. I used Almond extract because it goes so much better with almond biscotti. I also used only 1/2 cup of chopped almonds and 3/4 cup of coarsly chopped marachino cherries. It was the perfect amount. I would really suggest to put a piece of aluminum foil on the baking sheet before placing the dough. It is so much easier to just pick up the foil by the sides and place on racks to cool. Wait the 15 minutes then peel the foil off slowly and place on the cutting board to slice.

Oh my gosh, this is the best recipe ever for biscotti. I didn't have a lot of hope when I baked this- the mixture spread waaaaay out. The first taste test showed it was pretty heavy on the butter. I made sure to allow it lots of extra time to cool between bakings, and after the second bake, and a night to cool and harden, these puppies were nearly perfect- I guess this is a recipe that needs to add that perfection comes after you wait- the difference between fresh baked and a day later was like night and day.

My boyfriends staple for each day! That says a lot because he's a chef! I use a t. each of vanilla and almond flavoring. I also brush with beaten egg white before baking. I love them!

I made this biscotti. It is very good.  Crisp, sweet but light.  I substituted a variety of cut dried fruit(cranberries, cherries, blueberries and raisins)for the candied cherries and I used walnut chips instead of almonds. It was still great. The dough was quite sticky.  I think I put in at least another cup of flour when kneading it into a ball.  They baked evenly and didn't crumble when cut.

I brought home some cherry almond biscotti and they were the best, so my wife asked me to look up a recipe - I did and she made them and I must say this is the best biscotti that I have ever tasted. I brought some to work, and they all asked if she would be willing to make more "and sell them to them"
So - yes - this recipe is by far the best.

I have made this sevral times. The most recent was for a cookie exchange and then taking the rest to a family gathering. I recived a TON of compliments. "Like ones from a bakery" among others.   Someone asked me how I got them "biscotti shaped". The directions here refer to a 'ball of dough'. The "dough" is way too sticky to form a ball. I just try to get the mixture in half in the bowl and then scoop it into a pile on the pan. No amount of flour on your hands would stop this stuff from sticking. I spread it into a rough rectangle shape with the spoon I stirred it with. The rectangle spreads into that perfect rounded biscotti shape when it bakes the first time.   For cutting them without crumbling: wait until they are cool, then I use a serrated knife and cut from the outside to the middle, holding the outside edge in place with my fingers. They seem to keep thier shape much better this way.  I have made them just like the recipe and they are good. But almond extract is better. I also have had great sucess with other mix-ins; including 1C chocolate chips and 1C caramel chips, marchino cherries instead of candied (I prefer this marchino), 1C caramel chips, 1/4C cocoa powder (made it denser, but good and chocolaty). I plan to try other variations in the future including turtle, twist, and others.

This recipe was easy enough, but I am a little disappointed with the flavor. I think if i were to make it again, I would add some almond extract to the batter and maybe use dried cranberries instead of cherries.

Made this twice over the holiday. First time making biscotti.  Very good, added a little almond flavoring and used sliced almonds.  Very good, dough is a little sticky but turned out good.  Will use this one again.  Thanks,

Turned out great.  Very easy recipe.  Baking it is what takes the longest.  While I was waiting for it to bake and cool I was able to make another batch of cookies.  I also let them sit out all night to get totally hard.

Very festive and great tasting.  This was my first attempt at making biscotti so I'm not sure if the dough is supposed to be so crumbly.  Because the dough is fragile, I'd recommend chopping the cherries a little smaller and using chopped almonds instead of sliced almonds...every almond or cherry chunk is a place where the dough is weakened and more likely to crack. Also for others new to biscotti, when the instructions say to "carefully remove to wire racks"...it means don't let the biscotti flex at all as it will weaken it causing breaks then or later.  I used 1 tsp of almond extract (instead of 1/2 tsp vanilla) and thought the flavor was great.  I only got about 7 full length pieces from each loaf or about 14 big biscotti from the recipe and lots of smaller biscotti pieces.

I didn't know what to expect, never made biscotti before, but this was easy and turned out great! Perhaps will substitute almond extract for vanilla for a little more almond taste.

Very, very, VERY good! only change was subbing the vanilla extract for almond extract as per other reviewers.  I chop the cherries/almonds very small as biscotti tends to crumble when slicing after the first bake if the bits are too large.  Definite keeper, I am a lover all things biscotti! :)

My boyfriend and I are avid coffee drinkers and we were looking for a great snack to have with it and this was it! These were great I did make a couple changes. I used 1/2 cup of slivered almonds, changed the cherries to 1 cup cherry flavored craisins, and used almond extract.

Very good! I formed 1 big rectangle instead of two. While baking it flattened a lot. But the final result is delicious.

Dough was so dry that cookies broke up even before baking them the first time. Now enough moisture. Next time I'm cutting back on the flour to just 1 & 1/2cups, not 2. :(

great recipe, had to add a bit more flour to dough, too sticky. I put dried cranberries in also and sprinkled with white sugar for decoration. YUM, can't wait to share these with my family/friends

This dough came out very sticky for me, so I added almost a whole other cup of flour. I don't think the milk is necessary. I also only used 3/4 cup of chopped candied cherries and 1/2 cup of almonds. With those few changes, this came out great!

Very good recipe, easy and pretty results. I toasted sliced almonds rather than using slivered almonds. I also used 1 tsp. almond extract instead of the vanilla and dried cherries instead of candied cherries. Brought these to work today and everyone enjoyed. Thanks!

These were pretty good. I was afraid of burning mine, so I took them out a bit too soon I think - maybe next time I try them they will be perfect.

Not too difficult of a recipe, and if you love biscotti, you will enjoy these!  The batter was sticky, and forming it was a little difficult because it kept wanting to spread out across the pan.  And when I put it in the oven I thought it was ruined because it began to spread out!  But, it did not go too far, just enough to slightly burn the edges before being cooked completely in the middle.  I fixed it by cutting the edges off once out of the oven.  After they were baked again, and cooled off, they were a delicious treat, and great with my coffee the next morning.  A little stressful at the beginning, but overall, a tasty treat!  4 stars.

This is an easy dough to make and shape. I added 1/4 c. additional flour based on other reviews and used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract. I gave as gifts and received great reviews and requests for the recipe!  I can't stop eating them myself!

The dough tastes delicious :-D  It smells lovely baking in the oven as well.  

I made a minor change to boost flavor.  I increased the vanilla to 1ts and added 1 ts of lemon extract as well, I also used dried cherries as I didn't have any candied cherries around.

I think this is a great recipe. Very, very sticky dough though. Lightly wet your hands when you do the final part of forming into a log. This will make the process of molding it sooo much easier.

This is a delicisous biscotti.  I used almond extract instead of the vanilla.  I also dipped some of the biscotti into chocolate and drizzled them with white chocolate.  Very good!

Good recipe, easy to put together and very tasty. Instead of all-purpose flour I used organic whole wheat flour.  Also substituted the candied cherries with dried bing cherries and a handful of dried strawberries. I re baked my cut up batch twice 10 minutes on each side this really helps to dry them out.

This was my first attempt at baking biscotti, & these are delicious! My second batch is baking as I type! I can't wait to give them as gifts. I did use some extra flour as I rolled the dough into quarters(I doubled the recipe ,& I baked it on parchment as recommended by others.

I made this Biscotti recipe as written, except for the exchange of Almond Extract for Vanilla.  Some people said they had problems with the dough, here are some suggestions.  I used my food processor until the addition of fruit and nuts.  Then I put eveything into a bowl, put on some "surgical" gloves and mixed everything up.  It went together very easily.  Made two balls and rolled them on a slightly floured board.  Place both rolls on parchment paper lightly sprayed with plain Pam.  Make sure that your butter is extremely cold!  This was is a delicious cookie!  Thanks for the recipe!!

It tastes absolutely amazing!  But i was not able to get it to stay in biscotti form.  It cracked when i tried to cut it.

This is wonderful biscotti! Instead of candied cherries I used maraschino, and also added a few tablespoons of the cherry liquid. They turned out pink and lovely! Try drizzling with some white chocolate for a yummy finish!

I wasn't sure how to find the cherries, so I used maraschino cherries.  I turned out great!

Wow!!!!  I thought I would try my hand at making Biscotti and I was blown away by this recipe!  I'm addicted and now have my third batch in the oven. :)  The second batch I added cranberries and orange peel instead of the cherries.  Very good!  My husband took a batch along to work today for their Christmas snack day.

This was my first time to make biscotti and these are delicious. I used about 3/4 cup chopped maraschino cherries, and 1 tsp each of vanilla and almond flavoring. Dough was very sticky, so I added another 1/2 cup flour then had to spoon it onto the pan (lined it with parchment paper) and they spread out some but came up off the paper with no problem. 
Now I'm planning to make some for Christmas gifts, and might dip one end in dark or white chocolate.

Very good recipe, however - I ended up greasing the baking sheets very heavily as the dough stuck to them and tore the middle right out.  I even had to regrease the sheet after cutting the biscotti into slices.  I added almond extract and I also had to add more milk than the recipe called for.  The dough was a bit challenging to cut but I did all right.  They did taste fantastic, though....just some fine-tuning was necessary.

I made these and my mom and I LOVED them. I did drizzle an icing on top that I made with powdered sugar, a tsp of almond extract and a bit of water. I also did not bake them in the oven after the first time. Doing this made them more like a moist cookie than a crunchy biscotti.

This makes a fantastic biscotti, and I have made several batches every year for the past 8-10 years. The only alterations I have made to the original recipe, is not to chop the almonds or half the cherries, and I slice it thinner, app. 0.5 cm thick.

First time ever making biscotti, and it was not only easy, but the best biscotti I have ever eaten. I used it as part of  tea cup gist baskets for my groups craft sale, and also sold seperate pieces. It got rave reviews from everyone. Going into my favorites. I made exactly as listed, except I used marashino cherries.
