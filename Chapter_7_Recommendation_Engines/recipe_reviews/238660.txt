I had to mix up my own vanilla sugar (recipe on this site), and because I just couldn't wait, I used it after only 24 hours rather than a week!  I love the mixture of sweetness with the cr√®me fraiche, and I must admit to having had it with breakfast rather than dessert!  For a really fancy dessert, I could picture it with just a little ice cream and a drizzle of peach schnapps over the top.  This will definitely be repeated!

Fresh and not canned peaches is best with creme fresh! Delightful not too sweet.
