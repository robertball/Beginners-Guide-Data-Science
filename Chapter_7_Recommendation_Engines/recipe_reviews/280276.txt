My husband loves blueberries. This was quite good. Only change was mashing the blueberries. Worked for me!

I only made 2 of these and used the rest of my biscuits for sausage and gravy. I'm sorry I did that since these are so good. Next time I will make the whole can.

Super easy and delicious. I tossed powered sugar and lemon juice on the blueberries before baking as well. Also flattened out full biscuits from Trader Joeâ€™s  and did not cut in half. Cook on lower heat a little bit longer to cook throughout.
