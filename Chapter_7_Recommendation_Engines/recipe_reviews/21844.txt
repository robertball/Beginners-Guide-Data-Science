Very good.  I made the following minor changes: 1. don't peel the potatoes. 2. don't cook the potatoes that long, just til barely tender, unless you want mush. 3. use less red pepper (see other reviews. 4. used the potato water with a buillion cube added for broth (use more liquid than called for unless you want it really thick).  Yum!  Great healthy and easy recipe.  By the way, one other suggestion is make sure you use SILKEN tofu, I think the problem that other reviewers had with consistency was due to using the wrong kind of tofu. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it yesterday for a dinner party and it was a hit!  I used Del Monte canned corn since it doesn't contain any added sugar like a lot of the other brands.  If you are concerned about getting the right consistency, scoop out the vegetables first and blend them with the tofu, then blend and add the broth until you get the right consistency.  I used a teaspoon of pepper flakes and it was still a little spicy.  Thanks a lot for the recipe, and the helpful reviews, too!

This was the first time I had ever made a chowder and I'm so proud of it.  It was so quick and easy. I took the advice of others and added a little extra seasons (rosemary/thyme) and less red pepper. I also reserved three cups from the blender. I've always been a huge corn chowder fan but hated the fat and calories. Now I can eat as much as I like! It's also great for my vegan friend!  5 BIG stars on this recipes!!!

YUM. I just finished my first bowl. From the other reviews and my own experience, here is what I would change. 1) 1 TBS is way too much red pepper flakes. Use 1/4-1 tsp depending on how spicy you like your food. 2) Reserve at least 4 cups of veggy and broth mix to make sure the soup has texture, unless you like soup with no chunks. 3) Saute the onions and pepper in butter or olive oil first with the red pepper flakes while the potatos are boiling, then add them to the potatos as the recipe says. 4) Make sure you buy silken tofu. Firm tofu does not work well in soups. 5) This does need something else- thyme or rosemary, or another spice of your choosing sauteed with the onion would give it a fuller flavor. 6) I would add more corn- I didn't quite think the 2 cans were enough. 7) More veggie broth (at least 3 cups) Delicious, healthy soup!

I was so hungry for corn chowder, and looked through several "allrecipes" before choosing this one. I enjoyed the flavor of this soup, but the consistency wasn't thick enough for my liking, so I added instant potato flakes. Next time I make it, I will simply add less broth at the end. I also added more seasoning--try a bit of sage for a more savory flavor.

I was skeptical at first but this recipe is awesome! My housemates wouldn't believe me that this was a vegan, low-fat recipe. I like it so much better than soups with heavy cream. It's really pretty easy too - if you can chop and stir (and have a food processor) you can make it. I didn't peel the potatoes, which makes it a lot easier, and makes the color more interesting. If you're not a vegan, try grating cheddar cheese on top.

What a delicious recipe! I love using the tofu to make the chowder so creamy--a great way to make a corn carb dish gain some protein and healthful soy. I just took this to my office holiday potluck and the raving didn't stop. I wished I could have claimed the recipe. I'm 100% there with the common comment that 1 Teaspoon of red pepper flakes is Plenty. Also, I reserved more of the chunky vegetables & less broth to help preserve the creamiest of consistencies. I used red, yellow & green bell peppers for color. I'm taking it to Christmas dinner this year, too! Thanks for the great chowdah!

This hit the spot on a cold, rainy evening!  I had to modify the recipe a bit, because I didn't have enough green pepper.  I used about 1/4 cup green pepper and added a very small jar of diced red pimento.  I only used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes......can't imagine how hot it would be with a full tablespoon.  Next time, I think I will skip the boiling the potatoes in water and just throw everything in with the veggie broth from the start to cook together.  Very simple recipe.  Low that it was low-fat and had the protein of the tofu.

I made this with only 1 can of vegetable broth because I like a thick chowder. Also I used one can of creamed corn, one whole kernel corn. After cooking we drizzled in a little maple syrup - sounds weird but it tasted great! Gave it a little sweetness, which was nice.  I served this to people who would not have eaten it had they known there was tofu in it, they all LOVED IT. This soup was a big hit.

I've never cooked with tofu before (and am usually not the biggest fan), but the flavor and consistency of this is great!  My roommate didn't know what was in it, and when she tried it, she thought it had 20 grams of fat in it.  Then I told her what it was and she was shocked!  Oh, and I made some slight changes - used chicken broth, and used both green and red peppers.  Yum!  Nice and spicy too.

I am currently on a strict vegan diet and this recipe calmed my cravings on this very rainy day for a warm, creamy comfort food!  The silken tofu did an amazing job of thickening the soup and giving it that creamy texture I thought I could only get from adding half 'n half.  I made quick work of the recipe by using "microwave in the bag" red potatoes.  I also made the following changes:  I added 1/2 cup of chopped red bell pepper and sauteed the onion, bell peppers & pepper flakes (about 1/2 - 1 tsp) in some olive oil until soft.  I then added the corn and the cooked potatoes (unpeeled), which I'd coarsely chopped.  I then added 1.5 cups of vegetable broth.  I removed a little over half of the soup and processed it in the blender with a 16 oz package of silken tofu.  After pouring the blended soup back into the pot I removed some soup to test some seasonings.  I added a bit of thyme and rosemary but didn't care for the result at all.  It clashed with the sweetness of the corn and heat of the red pepper flakes.  So I simply added salt to taste and topped with cheddar flavored Veggie Shreds (soy cheese).  I think cilantro might be a really good addition to this soup.  I'll try that next time.  This was a beautiful soup, too, with the addition of the red bell pepper.

Fantastic recipe.  I made similar changes to others who didn't peel the potatoes (mine were organic) and sauteed the onions ahead of time.  My corn and bell pepper strips were frozen, but the soup still turned out amazingly.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! This soup reminds me of something you'd see on the menu board at Panera. I just made it and now I want to find a recipe to make rolls. A fresh, warm roll (or two) would be fabulous dunked in this soup!   One thing to note is that the red pepper flakes are quite potent (at least to me they are) so you might want to use sparingly unless you lke a spicier soup.  p.s. I also think that fresh baked tater tots would be de-lish tossed into this soup. Mmmmm...now I'm wishing I had some on hand.

I wasn't as impressed with this recipe, though I did love the trick of using tofu in place of cream!

I used poblanos in place of green peppers, roasting them first.  I also used fresh corn, and used water in place of the liquid that would have come from canned.  This may have altered the taste.

I just wasn't crazy about it.  Also - if you like your soups more stew-like, don't puree as much - only puree about a cup or so to havea chunkier soup.

made this for a lunch party and everyone raved about it.  decreased pepper to 1tsp but thought even that was too much (for my toddler).  THANK YOU for a great recipe.  I love cream soups and can never make any given my daughter is allergic to dairy. This will be a regular.

This soup was excellent! I made a few changes. While the potatoes were cooking, I sauted garlic, onion, and diced green and red peppers in butter and added some ground thyme. I added the cooked potatoes and broth and continued with the recipe. I also increased the broth since I didn't feel like 2 c. was enough. Served with vegetarian BLTs with Nayonnaise - delicious!

You should have seen my husband's face when I slid the tofu into our shopping cart...  In spite of the rocky start, we both loved this soup.  The only modification that I made was to reserve more of the chunks than the recipe suggests because we like our chowder chunky.  YUM!
EDIT: After making this soup a bunch more times, we still love it, but have changed it a bit for our tastes. I always add way less red pepper flakes than it calls for. If you want just a little spice, try just 1/4-1/2 tsp. We use a teaspoon, and it's still a pretty spicy.  I also added some basil when I reheated leftovers and I liked that a lot. Think I'll add it during the cooking process. In my opinion this tastes better on day two. Reheat on 50% power in the microwave (stirring once part way through) so you don't have to worry about scalding on the stovetop or boiling. I've also used frozen corn in place of the canned, and I really haven't noticed any problem.

Easy, quick, simple!  It's not super fancy, but a quick way to make some chowder and use tofu.  One tip, it doesn't say to drain the veggies at any point, so just take note of how much you end up pouring in the blender to puree.  You don't want too much liquid.  I made a half batch because I only had one (big) red potato on hand.  Did not peel the potato.  Used frozen corn (12 oz) instead of canned corn.  Added 2 T of butter into the boiling mixture as well.  Sprinkled some dried chives in it too from my garden.  As a non-vegetarian, it would be better with bacon.

We loved this chowder!  It's rich and creamy.  Only blended half of the veggies and broth, for a more chunky soup.  Used sweet corn cut off the cob and boiled it with the potatoes.  Added 1 tbsp of cilantro to finished soup.  Heavenly!

Absolutely terrific!  We have made this many times now, serving it to many friends (some vegetarian, some not). It's always a hit! Of course, we had to adjust the 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes as we could only guess that was a typo.  After several trials, we have settled on using 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. We will be making this in our home for many years to come!

This is is a new favorite at our house!  The soup is very creamy and filling, you'd never know there's tofu in it.  We leave out the red pepper flakes and green peppers and add tons of cracked black pepper...just our personal taste.  Best of all it's virtually fat-free!  Thanks J.D.!

This was a very yummy chowder and my kids loved how sweet the corn made it. I did have to add actual cream though but it was only because I had doubled the recipe but had only gotten one pack of tofu. I also ended up adding an additional can of corn at the end so it wasn't just a liquid soup. It still turned out great!

this recipe beats out the other corn chowder i used to make. the tofu gives it a nice thickness. i left out the red pepper; my boyfriend's not a fan of spicy food. i also left half of the soup unpureed and kept the skin on the potatoes. i was very happy with the results. perfect for a cold night. i'll be making it again.

1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes must be a typo.  I love spicy food, and I found 1 teaspoon to be too much.  I recommend 1/4-1/2 a teaspoon.  Overall, this was really great! I love recipes that include tofu.  Will make again!

I loved this soup and I'm giving it 5 stars despite the fact that I thought 1 tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes was too hot and overpowering.  Next time I will use about 1 TEASPOON of flakes or less.  However, the consistency of the soup was great.  Thick and creamy.  I loved all the veggies in it.  The best part of the soup was how healthy it was, too.  Great recipe!!

not as flavorful as i'd hoped, but it's okay. you really have to like potatoes and corn to like this, and i do. my husband didn't like it at all. i will try to use tofu as a base for a cream soup again, but i won't make this corn variety very often. the bland flavor is not really worth the trouble, and that's why i gave it only three stars.

This recipe was really great!  Simple to make, and a great soup for the cold weather.  Nice and creamy, with a bit of a kick from the hot pepper flakes.  Stores & reheats well too!

I was really disappointed with this soup, unfortunately. The tofu, which I normally love, did add a nice creaminess to the soup, but I found the overall texture really unappealing -- not quite thick, not really thin. My corn was super-sweet which turned the soup into a sweet sludge. I like the theory of this soup though, and will probably try the tofu as cream idea again soon.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I am NOT a vegetarian and I barely even like vegetables, but this got such good reviews that I thought I would try it.  It came out creamy and tasty, and the red pepper gave it a nice kick.  I took the advice of reducing the red pepper by half....it was still plenty spicy.   I made a double batch to share with a friend, and to freeze some.  I definitely plan to make it again.

I didn'tUsed 24 oz bag of frozen corn that I precooked in salted water and I was afraid a whole tablespoon of pepper flaked would be too spicy and boy was I right.  I used closer to 1/2 Tbls of red pepper flakes and that was still too spicy for us. Next time, 1 teaspoon is probably hot enough for us.

This chowder was so creamy and delicious... perfect for a snowy spring day in Colorado!  I'm definitely making this again, though I think I'll only use half the pepper flakes next time as it was pretty spicy!

Nice combination of sweet and slightly hot.  I didn't expect a vegetarian dish to taste so hearty.  Added tyme and sage for a little extra flavor.

I foolishly added the entire tablespoon of red pepper flakes and the soup is WAY too spicy!  I think without the spice it would be really good and very tasty.  It was very easy to make, and I will do it again, but will greatly reduce the amount of red pepper flakes.

This was delish and healthy.  I pureed the entire batch and everyone in my family loved it.  I skipped the tofu because it didn't need any thickening.  But thanks for the tip, I can't eat flour so I now I know what to use.

This is a simple, delicious, healthy and surprisingly vegan recipe that my entire family loved.  I added about 1/2 a cup more of the vegetable broth and took another reviewer's advice and sauteed the vegetables with vegan butter and thyme and a about 3/4 tsp. pepper flakes.  I also left more of the vegetables and potatoes out of the blender.  I will definitely be making this again.  YUMMY!

This is not only my first time cooking with silken tofu but also my first time making a blended soup (was always afraid of splattering it all over the place).  I was amazed at how well it turned out.  If I really, really pay attention I can kind of taste the slight chalkiness of the tofu but it really doesn't stand out.  I had one bowl plain and one with a little sharp cheddar sprinkled top and if I really had to choose, I'd say it was slightly better with the cheddar, but really they were both very good.

Great low fat soup! I reserved a little more of the veggies before blending, per the other suggestions. I also added some red and yellow bell peppers for color and some thyme for flavor. If you don't like spicy, you can just add red pepper flakes as desired after cooking. Blended up nice and smooth and was great with some cheese on top.

Overall, a very good recipe.  Like others, I could not find both "firm" and "silken" tofu, so I went with silken.  It looked very creamy at first, but it got more grainy the longer it cooked.  Maybe I kept it on the stove too long.  I also decreased the amout of red pepper, but I added some cumin for a southwest kick.  Next time I will try adding some crab meat.  The chowder reminds us of a crab corn chowder we love at a local restaurant.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe but I made a couple of changes. I substituted a red bell pepper for the green, added 4 cloves of garlic, increased the broth to 4 cups, and substituted two habaneros and one jalapeno for the crushed red pepper. Delicious and spicy!

I've made this creamy, tasty soup twice.  Once I added chicken and the next time I added ham.  I cut back to 1/2 tsp. of red pepper.  It was a hit with my family both times.

This is the weirdest looking thing I have ever made. It seriously looks like grits. Maybe I bought the wrong kind of Tofu. I couldn't find silken and firm, it was either silken or firm. I bought the firm. Its pretty tasty though, despite the look. I tasted the mixture before I added the tofu and processed it, and I think it was better. It was thin of course like soup, but it was really good. Next time I think I will leave the tofu out and make this as a soup instead of chowder.

Yum! Just tried my first bowl of this chowder, and was very happy with it! The tofu made it so creamy. I might leave a few more vegetables un-pureed next time. I used 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, I might use a bit less next time. I added a clove of garlic as well, hard to tell if it made much of a difference. Overall I would recommend this recipe to anyone! It's tasty, filling, and easy to make. :)

great idea; i made a few mods that may be helpful.  i used red pep flakes (~1/2 tsp), cayenne (~1/2 tsp), & fresh ground blk pep.  also used red pep & green onions instead of listed ingredients.  added mushrooms & 1/2 small container of heavy cream (helps w/ consistency).  i served it to a couple of guys who hate tofu, and they loved it.  hope that helps!

I will not make this again.  Although is was much healthier with the tofu, there was not much flavor and it looked like gritz with a few chunks of potato and pepper in it.

This chowder is so very good. I had to recommend it to a vegan friend of mine, because she's always looking for new things to make for herself. I followed the instructions for the most part, but like other reviewers, decreased the amount of red pepper to about half - it still has a good amount of punch! I added a green pepper to the mix and used green onion instead of sweet onion. This was easy, and tasty and for a single person (moi) makes for an easy to prepare lunch for the week.

Fabulous!!  You would never know that this creamy chowder was so good for you!  Very easy to make, extremely tasty, and keeps well and reheats well for leftovers, I could eat it for weeks!  A great winter meal.

I made this for Thanksgiving in 2001 - my brother-in-law was skeptical - let's just say he told my sister it was a must for 2002.

Yummy! I didn't use silken tofu so it wasn't as creamy as I expected but that was probably just my fault for buying the wrong kind.  I love this with cornbread!

This was really good.  I substituted 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper for the pepper flakes.  It was too much.  Also substituted regular tofu for the fat-free because I could not get the fat-free tofu.  Only added a total of 10 grams of fat.

This is a great recipe. I agree that one teaspoon of red pepper flakes is plenty (I'll probably use a little less than a teaspoon next time). I pureed only about half of it to keep some of the texture from the corn and potatoes. Very good!

I was really surprised that this soup tasted so good with the tofu.  It is a thick, creamy soup and excellent.  I reserved 2 cups of the broth and vegetables and it was great. I agree that about 1/2 tablespoon would have been fine in this recipe instead of a whole tablespoon.

The soup had a very thick and creamy texture.  But I believe the pepper flakes should have been 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon.  I love hot foods, but the peppers overshadowed the corn flavor.  I would make it again, but cut the pepper flakes way back.

The listed amount of red pepper flakes seems to be a type-o.  I like hot foods and a TBSP seemed too much.  I used less and it was still pretty hot.  Great soup though.

This was awesome!  I had my doubts about the tofu but it really was great!  Thick, tasty, and colorful - I kept the skins on the potatoes.  The crushed red pepper added just the right kick.  Believe me - no one would know it was tofu.  I just finished the leftovers today - three days later and it was still excellent!
