After reading the other reviews, I changed a few things. Instead of boiling your onions and celery in chicken broth, I sautéed them in ¼ stick of butter with salt and pepper. I also added half of a bell pepper for a little extra flavor. Alsoto add a little more flavor, instead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. I also added about half of a can of milk. I mixed the onions, bell pepper, and celery with the cream of mushroom soup and the cream of chicken soup. I also added salt and pepper to taste. I choose not to add the mushrooms. Everyone really enjoyed these changes but I have to agree it is a lot of food.

This recipe is really the best chicken casserole I have ever had.  All the ladies at church have been sharing this recipe since it was a huge hit at a gathering recently.  My husband had 3 helpings!  Well worth the bit of time to cook the chicken and broth, but you could use some chicken breasts and a couple of cans of broth.

After mixing everything together I tasted the sauce and it was definitely bland to my taste.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of salt-free Cavender's Greek seasoning, and 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  That seemed to fix it.  I used Velveeta cheese and just melted it in the pan and didn't bother to cook it in the oven like a casserole.  We just filled our plates from the pan and served it with crescent rolls and a salad.  I did have to add a bit more broth to thin it down a little.

When I first made this, I didn't have parsley. It was bland and a little dry, after baking. I revamped the recipe. With the left over broth, I added two tablespoons of chicken bullion. Plus basil instead of parsely, and some garlic salt. I doubled the onions, celery and chicken broth (2 cups of broth). Canned chicken works just fine! I also substituted egg noodles for the spaghetti. I can't believe how much better it tastes now. I hope others will try it. You might be surprised.

This was a good recipe but a little bland.  I used fresh mushrooms but it also requires some garlic, herbs and/or seasonings to give it more 'oomph'.  A good recipe to make your own.

This was a great recipe, and it made so much, it fed my husband and I all week!  I substituted the 8 oz of shredded cheddar for 16 oz of Velveeta, and it was great!  Very econmical meal.

We did not like this recipe.  It made enough for a crowd, but was very bland and very dry.  It needed a whole lot of something to make it better.  I ate it a leftovers for lunch the entire week (because my husband would let the enitre pan go to waste despite how bad it was) with the help of plain yogurt & more cheese to attempt to moisten it up.  Will not ever make this one again.

My husband LOVED this recipe...it is so creamy and yummy... definate comfort food!! I don't shred my chicken though, I cube it, and I add a little green pepper to the water as it boils. Thanks for a great recipe!

We enjoyed this - and it's a good thing, because it made a lot!  (Even though I halved the recipe, we've had it for 2 meals, and I still have a little bit in the fridge!)

The recipe was a bit dry, but my granddaughter loved it. After reading some reviews, I sauteed the celery and onions instead of boiling them.  I used roasted 2 chicken breasts with Lawry's Seasoning Salt and pats of butter that I roasted in the oven at 350º for 30 minutes. Roasting the chicken has a better taste than boiled and not as dry. I also added 1 tsp. of garlic powder since some reviews said it was bland.  If I make this again, I will add maybe 1/2 cup more of the broth or a 1/2 cup of milk.

My whole family loved this recipe!  I used 6 chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken.  If it's dry, just use more of the reserved broth.  I'll try with some bell peppers next time.

Great recipe!  Be sure to look through the comments for some great ideas about tweaking the recipe.  I used rotisserie chicken to save time (and dirty dishes), and I also sauteed the celery and onion in butter since I didn't do the "boil the chicken with the veggies" step.  I swapped one can of cream of mushroom for cream of chicken, and I added extra milk to make sure the casserole didn't get too dry during baking.  I made this for a 14-person birthday lunch (didn't quite double the recipe, but it was close), and everyone loved it, even my pickiest eaters.  Will definitely add to the rotation!

I only had breast and drumsticks. Added onion and bellpepper(from our garden), and garlic when I boiled the chicken. Did not have cream of mushroom. So added cream of chicken and rotel! It made 2 casseroles so now I froze it to have when my mother comes the day before Thanksgiving!! A hit with all!!!

I made the smaller version so instead of the half a can mushrooms I used the whole can. I also added additional chicken bouillon and added garlic powder. All and all a great recipe.

Followed the recipe but sprinkled fresh parsley when it was done. Added color. It's a winner.

This was so delicious. It was a big hit with the family, and I know I will make again. I must say however, that I did add 5 oz of Rotel to spice it up and it tasted so yummy. GREAT RECIPE!  5 STARS *****

Kids loved it.  Took to a banquet, everyone enjoyed.  Added some extra veggies for color.
