Great recipe.  I didn't have time to bake the 1 &1/2 hours, so I cooked the meatballs in a skillet and then added the sauce.  Covered them for a little while to get nice and bubbly and then simmer.  The sauce was delicious!

This recipe looked so yummy but it is much too salty to be placed in our meal rotation. You can cut the salt to 1/2 tsp with the meat. But the ketchup is still a problem unless you make homemade ketchup. One serving of this recipe contains 2/3 of our daily sodium intake.

I liked this fine. I can't say it goes well with spaghetti though. I would say with mashed potatoes & fried carrots it would go well with. 
I only had to cook it about 1 hour. Any more & it would have dried out for me. I did just as stated above but only did half a recipe for hubby & me & had left overs.

LOVE LOVE LOVE....aptly named.  Will keep this recipe for future use.  Very tender meatballs.  Sauce is more a BBQ type...I wouldn't put these particular sauce on spaghetti as one of the pix shows.  I'd use the meatball recipe part and cook with a more Italian type of sauce.  Killer recipe!

I love these meatballs!  Great sauce.  I served them over brown rice with a touch of parmesan cheese on top.  They were delicious and even better the next day.

Loved this recipe minus the onions . It is almost like the recipe my mom use to make, I just know she used to use brown sugar and white vinigar. So I made it with the white vinigar , just fried the meatballs and let them simmer in the sauce just like my moms and it tasted so close just minus the love. I will make again and again with my changes. I usually just eat the meatballs and sauce by them selves,  or on top of rice or on top of mashed potatoes. I find it to be more of a bbq sauce type sauce . I have made them 3 times now and am about to make them again tonight but I am doubling the sauce  cause hubby doesn't like the meatballs simmered in the sauce but he still likes to put a little sauce on top of his meatballs and rice. Thank you for posting!!
