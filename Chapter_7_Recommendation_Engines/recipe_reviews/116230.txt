This is the best fluffy frosting I have used in 53 years of cooking...This is the 3rd time I have made it and it turned out perfect...I did take the advice of adding the 2 Tbls. white corn syrup, that keeps the frosting soft for the next day..If you are having problems adding the syrup slow the mixer down...And you need to cook the syup to med hard ball stage..242 is soft ball..I use the method of spinning at least a 6 to 7 inch fine thread with the syrup..works every time..Dip a spoon in the syrup and pick it straight up..about 10 inches above the pan..Let the hot syrup drip and when enough drips come off the spoon it will spin a thread..I use the wire whip on the Kitchen aid only to beat the egg whites..remove that and use the open beater when you add the syrup. I set the speed of the mixer at the middle spot on the slide, keeping a nice even beating.Pouring your syrup in a fine stream is good but you have to keep pouring before the syrup cools too much or you will have chunks of hard crystals in your bowl...Dark chocolate cake with this type of frosting won my husbands heart on our first date 45 years ago...I make this for all of our special days..

This is the second recipe I've tried for seven minute frosting. The first recipe turned out grainy, but this recipe was perfect and easy. I ended up eating all of the extra frosting plain...it was that good!

I just made this frosting for the second time.  This is the BEST seven
minute recipe I've tried.  And as
a tip ..be sure and use a candy
thermometer.  Turned out perfect.
This frosting is best when eaten 
the day you make it.  Don't be surprised
if it gets a crust on the frosting the
second day.  That is very common with
any seven minute frosting.

Added 2 Tablespoons of corn syrup as suggested by other reviewers & this frosting was THE BOMB! Fluffy & yummy without being too sweet. The only change I'll make next time is to cook a bit longer so that the frosting will develop a thin "crust" after it cools. My family/friends are begging me to use this as a filling to make copycat Twinkies, Ding Dongs, Suzy Q's....Delish!

This is just like my mom's receipe she made it for 30 years and we called it Fluffy Icing. My mom added the cornsyrup and a dash of salt to the sugar and water mixture.  Also she would add food colouring and peppermint.  We always had it on Angel Food cakes and requested it almost every birthday. Her receipe was hard to read so thank you so much for this easier to read version. Yummy!

Excellent!  Super easy and so yummy.  Just the right about of sweetness.  I didn't have a thermometer, so I used a glass of ice cold water to test when the sugar/water syrup was ready.  Frosting set up nicely on the chocolate cake and tasted heavenly.  Will definitely make again.

This was much easier than I thought it would be - I have never made 7-min frosting before and this turned out easy and tasty.  It was VERY sticky however, and was a bit too loose to pipe, but got rave reviews.  Not sure if this would be solved if I had boiled the sugar/water longer. Tastes almost exactly like marshmallows.

I have loved seven-minute icing since I was a little girl but I remember my nana making it by mixing while it was on the stove.  That made me very nervous so I never tried.  Then, I found a recipe that was different but didn't require handmixer and stove at the same time.  It didn't turn out well.  This one did!  It is heaven!  My husband who has only liked canned icing (yuk!) in the past, loves this one too!  Can't wait to have my daughter taste it!

This was so good -- and pretty easy, too!  I tried another recipe like this one w/ similar ingredients that did not work at all - I think the key is the boiling time of the sugar/syrup mix. I added 2 T white corn syrup directly to the sugar water to keep the frosting from getting icky tomorrow.  I also added the syrup mix to the meringue super slowly - like over 3 or 4 mins of whipping w/ a hand mixer - and kept whipping for probably 5 mins after that, just to get a frosting consistency.  Definitely worth it - it tastes like fluffy marshmallows but goes on cupcakes like icing!

This recipe is the best Seven Minute frosting recipe that I have ever tried. It was raining today, and it still turned out fine. Not grainy at all. Beautiful texture. Not too sweet. I added two tablespoons of Karo Syrup to the sugar mixture as it cooked, but I'm sure it would have been fine without it. I LOVE not having to beat the frosting while it is on the cook top. I'll use this one from now on. Thanks for a great recipe.

1st time I made this it turned out excellent.  I was in a hurry so didn't let whites come to room temperature.  The 2nd time I made it, the whites were at room temperature and the frosting took 15 minutes to whip up to soft peaks, not nearly as good as the 1st batch.  I'm going to use cool egg whites from now on.   Both batches were delicious tasting!

I tried to make this frosting today. I tried 3 times! It burned the first time, it turned into sugar crystals the second time, and the third time I just stopped the cooking at a soft ball stage. I will never make this again as it's too sweet anyway.

Wonderfully fluffy & creamy frosting. Tired  it on a red velvet cake I made for Valentines Day. My daughter & grandson couldn't stop eating the frosting with a spoon. I think I will try it with some lemon extract to put on a lemon cake. Thanks for sharing

This is the best Seven-Minute Frosting recipe I have found!  Thank you!  I followed the recipe exactly and used a standing mixer - I was surprised at how easy it was to make.  The frosting is light, fluffy and perfectly sweet.  It spreads beautifully.

First time making this frosting or any meringue type frosting for that matter!  This was amazing, truley a wonderful frosting that is light, fluffy and easy to make.  I did add 2 tbsp of light corn syrup as other reviewers suggested.  I do not have a candy thermometer, but I set my timer for 3 1/2 mintes from the exact time the syrup started to boil.  Quickly removed from heat and added to the FOAMY egg whites, very slowly and in a tiny constant stream.  I dont know if anybody has tried, but I dont think this frosting would be easy to frost a cake or cupcakes after it was completley cooled.  I frosted my cupcakes while the frosting was still slightly warm but not cool or hot.  I used my kitchen aid mixer for this, I couldnt imagine trying to make this with a hand mixer!  Great recipe Will keep and use in place of buttercream (which I HATE making)!

Are ya kiddin me? I've been using a double boiler for years for nothing. I had to boil for much longer than the directions to reach 242. I did add the corn syrup. I started beating the 'cold' eggs (I didn't have time to bring to room temp) on high in a stand mixer at the same that I started the sugar on the stove. Absolutely delicious and easy.

This recipe was incredibly easy! The family loves it!! I made this for a spice cake because I was out of confectioner's sugar to make butter cream frosting. This was similar to the 7 minute frosting my grandmother would make for her coconut cakes. I am reviving her coconut cake this Easter!

This recipe is easy and quick. I added the 2 Tbsp. of corn syrup while sugar n water was heating and had the eggs fluffing with cream of tartar in the mixer. It took about 7-10 minutes total and I had the cake ready to frost when mixture was done. I'm glad too because the frosting was starting to set as I swooped on the last of the icing. Thanks T.O.Home and Pat for the corn syrup trick with details! Yum!

Please try this as a FILLING! :) Used this for filling between cake layers.  Made exactly as stated only adding coconut extract for flavor.  Turned out perfect.  Not necessary to use corn syrup. You must follow the preparation as stated to turn out - no short cuts.  You really can't go wrong by following the directions to a "T".  Good filling!  I'm going to make it again to fill chocolate cupcakes with chocolate glaze - homemade Hostess cupcakes.

This whipped up fantastically! It's a nice, soft frosting with a sweet flavor (kind of like marshmallow fluff).  The only change I made was to half the vanilla (so only 1/2 tsp. instead of 1 tsp).  I also added pink food coloring for valentine's day.  Cupcakes looked so cute! Great recipe!

This is the best-tasting, easiest 7-minute frosting recipe ever! It's so much less stressful than whipping over a double boiler or on the stove-top. 

I've used it for cakes, and this year I'm going to make ghost cupcakes with it for Halloween!

It tasted very good like marshmellows. If you use it all at once it s great but not for a long term use. After a day it starts to turn yellowish and sticky.

This was awesome!!! It tasted just like marshmallow cream. I was out of cream of tartar so I used the same amount of vinegar instead. Will definitely be making again!

This tasted just like Fluff! On bread with peanut butter? Fine, but NOT something I want on my cake. Disappointed that I wasted my ingredients.

Most excellent. I made as listed on the recipe. I forgot to add the corn syrup as others had suggested. I'm not sure why they were adding it. I did do one thing by mistake but I think it was that mistake that made it great. I accidentally whipped the egg whites and cr. of tarter a little too long and it was way past "foamy" and turning into a meringue before I stopped the mixer. I didn't have to whip the sugar into the whites for very long before it was ready. Everyone raved about it and I will add that 30 servings (for 24 cupcakes is WAY too much :) I now and going to find something to make that I can use the leftover fluff. I put it in a zip lock bag this morning and it's still soft and fluffy.

I LOVE this recipe!  This is the first time I've ever made seven-minute frosting.  I was going back and forth between this recipe and another one that uses a double boiler w/less steps, but I am sooo glad I tried this one!  It was very easy with my stand mixer.  The consistency and texture were perfect.   I also thought the sweetness was just right too.  I can't stand icing that is so sweet it hurts my teeth.  This wasn't at all.  I thought it was right on.

Excellent, very close to Marshmallow Fluff if I recall correctly!  It's not quite as fluffy as the Fluff I remember, but this is excellent as a filling for faux Hostess cupcakes or any other chocolate cake, and is excellent on Graham crackers as a snack.  I may try it with some peanut butter in a sandwich too! I wouldn't use it as a frosting personally, but as a filling, between layers, or as a quick snack with graham crackers (with chocolate, s'mores without the hassle!), it's perfect!

This is the better way to make this frosting. It stayed fluffly until gone. It did not get crystally or crusty. NEVER mind Paula Dean. Just follow this recipe - it's worth it. By the way, I did not use a candy themometer and it still turned out. I just used the hard ball in water method.

I made the "Black Magic Cake" from this site and then started looking around for something sweet to put on it. I looked at all the "Seven Minute" frosting recipes and thought they were just too busy for me to try (I don't have a double boiler and mixing with a bowl on top of a pot just didn't seem safe to me). I read this recipe and it made so much more sense to do it this way rather than the juggling act that the other recipes wanted you to do!! I don't remember ever hearing of this frosting before, but when I tasted it, it brought back some old memories of the frosting that my Mom made so many years ago!. Just about like eating marshmallows. I did put some on the cake that I trimmings and oooooh so wonderful! I hope they like it at the party to night! There is a lot of frosting here. I did a four layer cake and just had enough to cover the whole thing with out having to scrimp. This recipe went into my recipe box already!! Happy Halloween!!!

This recipe did not work out well for me. Never reached stiff peeks even after 30 minutes with hand mixer. It also tasted too sweet, like whipped cream with sugar in it.

So delicious!!!  I just finished frosting my cupcakes and couldn't wait to eat one.  It was very much like marshmallow fluff but very good.  Super sticky to work with, I tried using a cake decorating bag to frost with and it was very hard to get the stickyness into the bag after the first time, but well worth it.  I also added the 2 tbls of corn syrup since I read the other reviews before I made this.  Two thumbs up!

This turned out to be easy if you follow the directions exactly although it might seem complicated, it actually wasn't at all. One thing that helped me is a tip I read that if you don't stir the sugar mixture as it boils, you won't have the problem with crystals.  Although I love the way mine turned out, depending on how it holds up I might have beaten it longer, we'll see.  And next time I will use a candy thermometer for peace of mind.  Oh, and it was raining cats and dogs and still came out great, this is definately on my list of go to ideas; I had everything I needed in the pantry, which is always awesome.

honestly I followed the directions exactly and my frosting was runny but I went with it. I dumped it on my cake and let run down it like a drizzle. My taste testers gave it a thumbs up. I used the karo like suggested too. Currently my cake is in the fridge I hope the frosting wont run off completely. I think I will try another recipe next cake

I'm a novice in the kitchen so I was nervous about boiling sugar and the candy thermometer (which I don't have) - but this came out perfect and it was EASY! I have a lot extra so I'm even thinking of baking another cake so I can show off to my neighbors (grin). I'll definitely make this again.

This was absolutely wonderful on top of the chocolate cake I made. I needed an alternative to buttercream because I was making this for someone who couldn't have dairy or soy. Surprisingly easy to make. I added in the 2 tbsp corn syrup for safe measure and some caramel extract at the end.

UPDATE: I made this frosting yesterday and my review at that time is below. Today, however, I'm not as pleased. The frosting became crunchy and it lifts off my cupcakes in one large piece. I ended up "lifting" the frosing off each of my 2 doz cupcakes and had to use store bought frosting since I'm taking them to a gathering tonight. This is fine if you're eating your treat immediately, but wait any longer and you'll have a huge disappointment on your hands. Lowering my rating to 2 stars.**I'm still on the fence with this one. I made the recipe exactly as stated. I used my electric stand mixer so I could do both steps at the same time. As I added the hot sugar mixture, the whip beater splattered some of the mixture around the upper edges of the bowl which quickly hardened. I found that the mixture had alot of sugary crystals at the bottom so I only used the frosting from the middle of the bowl. I had plently but felt I wasted alot due to it being crystalized in some areas. I liked the taste & fluffiness of the frosting but I wasn't pleased with all the crystalized pieces.

WONDERFUL - turned out perfect (and I even halved the recipe.)  I have never had luck with seven-minute frosting (or as my grandmother calls it, "sea foam icing").  The double boiler just doesn't work for me.  I used my trusted Kitchen Aid and this method, and it worked great!

Followed recipe exactly. Never reached stiff peaks, even after beating for about 20 minutes using stand mixer. Perhaps the problem was that it rained all day? Made a tasty sauce for the cake.

This is the recipe used by my mother since the late 60's or early 70's.  It's beautiful and can hide mistakes if cakes are not even!!  I do add 2 tablespoons of white corn syrup. This recipe is a stable and I will continue to make it. - Paula Akbari

I've been cooking/baking the entire 36 years of my marriage. Needless to say I've made tons of frosting. This is an excellent recipe. If it doesn't turn out you did something wrong. Some folks just need to stick to pre made or get help from a skilled baker.  A kitchen should never be too hot or cold when baking. A mixer or beater needs to be powerful. You can't fool around when making this...read carefully...be prepared and listen to the helpful hints & reviews of the skilled.

I'm writing a review because they're so many versions of this recipe & I don't want to lose which was my favorite. This is the frosting I use when making coconut cake. I've tried a dozen from here & Food Network & like this best. I use my kitchen aid mixer.

This is a great recipe for fluffy marshmallow tasting frosting. The only thing i would suggest is making this the same day. It doesn't last but more than a day or so. Everyone loved this frosting and it was easy to make.

Now that's the way a birthday cake is supposed to look like.  Exactly like the "boiled frosting" I made in my mom's kitchen 60 years ago.  Thank you.  I made it exactly as written.  Next time I'll add the corn syrup.

Made it just as directed and WOW!  I was so impressed by this recipe - I've never had good luck with homemade frostings before and this one perfect! - Not too sweet, fluffy, and picture perfect! Will use this again and again... 
Only I was sad that this recipe made so much, I iced a double layer 9" cake and could have easily iced another. It was a shame to throw away the extra after it came out so splendidly.

Best 7 minute frosting EVER!!  SO easy!  I had never made it before and didn't have a double boiler, so I was happy to find a recipe that didn't require one.  I followed the instructions as written and it turned out beautifully.  The family loved it and my Dad loved his birthday cake!

Family favorite- as a kid I loved this frosting on a white layer cake that had sliced bananas between the layers. Excellent!

This is it!!!  My search is over, I have found the easiest, unmessiest, yummiest, can't mess it up seven minute frosting!!  I just couldn't ever make a seven minute frosting without the graininess.  I did with this recipe.  I did add the 2 T. of corn syrup like someone else said, but not sure it is really needed.  Thanks Taste of Home!

This recipe is awesome.  So yummy.  My mother and I used it to frost my daughter's princess birthday cake (2 bowl cakes stacked with Barb*e stuck in it).  We used a candy thermometer and made sure the eggs were near room temp when we started.  Not the most dense frosting in the world, but it held up fine for a 3-year old :-)  It was stiff enough to make nice dress wrinkles as we frosted the cake.  This was SO much better than store-bought frosting (bakery cakes or pre-made tubs)!
