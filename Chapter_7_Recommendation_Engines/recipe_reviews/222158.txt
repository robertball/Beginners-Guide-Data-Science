Yes....and it is GREAT!!...I hate to say I get recipes and tell that I did do something different...lol but don't we all do that who cook alot! But I will brag about this one...so the only things I did different is I used red onions instead of white. And I DID NOT USE Serrano pepper because of my 13yr old son...and no jalapeno pepper but I did replace a little dash or two with crushed red peppers to taste (because I like hot salsa). I used Lime juice (because I had that on hand). I also added 1 cup of fresh pineapple I cut into tidbits for added flavor of just enough kick of sweetness to the kick of this great salsa!! enjoy!

This was good.  Used some green onions as I had some that needed to be used up.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

We love it. I omitted the peppers , and added green peppers from the garden as well as tomatoes, onions and clintro.   I also used fresh squeezed lemons, freshness of them makes a difference. We enjoy flavor, not interested any spice/heat.

I didn't make any changes. And yes I will be making this again. Great for tacos, or just chips.

I started making this salsa for my family & everyone loved it! Only thing is that this is actually pico de gallo so I usually don't cut up all the vegetables as much & put all the ingredients into a blender. Super tasty!
