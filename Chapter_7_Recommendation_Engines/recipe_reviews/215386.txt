Thanks for all the comments I am glad you enjoyed it . Now some comments I added to times back but I guess it went under a adapted version .. so did not show up ..."Well actually I never wrote the chicken should be grilled when I transmitted the recipe, the Editor here at allrecipes.com took a few liberties i don't agree with . I would either poach the chicken or finish it in the oven i it gets to dry otherwise . And I would keep the chicken off the Couscous and don't sprinkle Dates on the CousCous ( gets to sweet.. ) and then the sauce needs to go on the chicken as well on the tomatoes and cucumbers ... ( Please see picture ) Just my original instructions , but you are free to try the editors way of doing it :-)"

For the sweetness it is important to top it with the lime juice and as I said to season it , it should be a fine balance between sweet sour and savory flavor.

My husband does not like capers.  My husband does not like dates.  My husband took a couple of bites of this dish and announced that I could put it on the weekly rota and he would happily eat it.  And then he gobbled it all up!

The only change I made was I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream because I had that in the fridge and it was cold and rainy and I didn't want to go out.  I did neglect the sauce a bit and when I returned, it had separated in a terrible gloppy mess, but I just added some more 1/2 & 1/2 and stirred vigorously and it all settled down.  Disaster averted!  Served with a boxed Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil couscous and for veggie, I followed recommendation and put my own twist: I sauteed green beans, then 5 minutes before finishing, I tossed in a handful of tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced Kalamta lives and some Spice Isalnds Greek Seasoning (great all-purpose spice for the pantry shelf)  And for those who think cooked cucumbers sound yucky, you haven't lived until you've had braised cucumbers, but's that's another recipe.  

I highly recommend this recipe.  Yum!  (In fact, I just had the leftovers from my plate---there were none from Husband's and Son's---for lunch.  Nukes well!)

Made this for ten people at a dinner party and served it over couscous with a Greek vegetable salad (tomatoes, olives, cucumber, bell peppers with a little oil and balsamic). It was such a hit! The sauce was a little thick and I wanted to ensure there was enough to go around, so I ended up adding a little 2% milk. The combination of the rich mascarpone, tart capers, and sweet dates is decadent beyond measure. Everyone loved the sauce so much - even my vegetarian friend (we spooned it over eggplant meatballs for him). Try this one out!

I joined All Recipes to review this dish (eventhough I have been using allrecipes.com for years now). Delicious beyond measure! The sweetness was devine and original and perfectly paired with chicken. I made this exactly as directed by the chef and it was beautiful in presentation and very tasty. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the sweet sauce paired with the couscous. Too much sweetness. It would be better just over chicken with something on the side that is slightly salty like veggies or pasta. I baked the chicken with a little salt, pepper, and olive oil on it and that made the contrast between salty chicken and sweet sauce delicious! Also, for those of you with a thick sauce. The recipe is perfect, but you are letting it sit too long. Make sure it is on medium heat (no more) and just let the cheese melt into it. After it has melted, wait maybe a half a minute to ensure it is hot, then pour it over the dish.

Very good! Sauce was a bit thick, so next time would take on the suggestion to add some milk. Surprisingly nice combination. The caper and dates go so well together!

The flavors blended very nicely together.  I do have a few tips that I would suggest, however.  First, I think there needs to be either more chicken, or less of everything else.  I would say double the chicken for this recipe.  Also, it begins to get too sweet, and needs some side like a pasta salad of some sort, as suggested in earlier reviews... something salty.  Otherwise, it's like eating too many cookies with no milk.  Other than that, it's a pretty interesting blend of flavors worth trying.  I might make this every now and again, but not often.

This is a really fantastic recipe. I swapped the couscous for Orzo (I was just in the mood) and ended up having to bake my chicken because my grill was broken. Also, I substituted thighs for the breasts because that's what I had on hand. 

The sauce is really sweet, but  was it scrumptious.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I don't make it often because of all the calories, but whenever I do everyone loves it! I usually end up using more cream and cheese than what the recipe calls for

I halved the capers only because I didn't have as much on hand as the recipe called for. Hubby said he was glad I cut back on the capers and suggested adding a little more date next time. I agree with Brinnet's comment that you really need the tomato and cucumber (and lime) on top to cut the richness of the sauce.  Pan fried the chicken and subbed quinoa for cous cous. Hubby doesn't like quinoa nor cucumbers, but with this dish, he ate every last bite (and I'd piled a lot of cucumber and quinoa on his plate!)

UPDATE: I gave this recipe to a friend, who made it for me. She got confused and accidentally used figs instead of dates. The recipe is delicious with the figs, also, though not nearly as sweet. It didn't need the citrus, tomato and cucumber as much as the date version does. While I personally like the date version better, people who prefer it to be a little less sweet may like the fig version better.

I did a veggie version of this recipe by leaving out the chicken and it was awesome. I recommend using an ample pile of cucumber and tomato on the top of the dish (or sprinkled around it) to cut the delicious, but otherwise overwhelming sauce. An easy recipe to produce as long as you've got the ingredients around. Will definitely make again.

You're going to die when you find out what I did to this recipe (chef, please forgive me). I'm a compulsive substituter, because I hate waste and spent many years living in the woods far from town, so always use what's at hand.  Ask my grown sons. Oh, the stories.
So, I followed all the instructions, except didn't have dates, so substituted (ready?) fresh blueberries. I know they don't even remotely resemble dates, but wait till you hear what happened to the sauce! As it cooked, it turned a gorgeous lavender cream color. Ah, so beautiful. Goat cheese replaced the mascarpone (which I suspect prevented the sweetness that was prominent in others' comments) and it added an absolutely awesome depth of flavor. Tomato dices (didn't have cucumbers either!) sprinkled liberally added to the beautiful colors -- cream-colored couscous, light-blue tinted sauce with bright red accents. And, the flavors...Let's eat!

I thought this sounded pretty bizarre, but I was ever so curious - I am SO GLAD I made it.  Friends and family now request it ALL the time at my house.  The kids really love it - they call it "Adventure Chicken" (cause of the capers - get it?  Capers?  Adventures?  Ahem.)  I can't get enough of the sauce, it's just excellent.  Wickedchef, this is outstanding!!

Unbelievably good!  I added some sliced cherry tomatoes to the sauce right when I took it off the heat.  I had to use vanilla soy milk because I have a lactose intolerance and that was all I had on hand(weird - but it still turned out great).  Finally, something different and new.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

I just finished making and eating this dish! I made a few changes: I used 6 chicken thighs instead of breast and doubled the sauce ingredients (except the capers since my boyfriend doesn't like them; I only used 1/4 cup). I grilled the chicken on our PC grill (like a George Foreman) and it wasn't dry at all. I used the couscous in a box that has raisins and nuts in it as I felt it would go well with the dates and capers in the sauce - I was right! I omitted the cucumber as I don't like them. I followed the chef's suggestions in his comment post and didn't put the sauce on the couscous - only on the chicken. And I made sure to squeeze some lemon juice over the chicken and sauce once I had plated it. It was all delicious! 2 thumbs up! :)

I don't know how the sauce would taste using cream but it was wonderful using half and half instead.  When grilling chicken for dinner one evening we grilled extra chicken to have on hand to use for this recipe.  That way this recipe was ready in less than 30 mins.  The picture does not do the presentation of this dish justice.  It was very attractive with the red tomto and green cucumber on top.

This was so rich and tasty! It caught my eye when I was looking for a sauce to serve over pear and Gorgonzola ravioli from a specialty store. I had cooked shredded chicken on hand, so to give it a fresher, grilled, taste; I put it in the pan with the butter and 1/2 tsp chicken ‘better than bullion’ with a couple spoonfuls of pasta water and let it heat and brown a bit before continuing w/capers and dates etc.  I loved it over the ravioli (but I won’t add cucumber to Gorgonzola again) so very rich, that I wish I was allowed more salt to accent it. Never would have thought of a date and caper cream sauce on my own. Thank You!

Interesting in a very good way.  People hard a hard time describing it but really liked it.  I made the sauce as listed but with only 1/3 of the capers.  Doubled the chicken and baked it after marinating overnight and served with garlic and onion orzo.  Also had vegetable normandy with greek seasoning.  I only put the sauce on the chicken.  Also nuked the tomatoes and cucumbers with creole seasoning for 30 seconds.  Everyone ended up mixing the tomato relish, orzo and veggies together.

I made a few substitutions - I used chickpea cutlets in place of the chicken, and a vegan cheese sauce in place of the mascarpone and cream. We thought it was great - a good solution to lightening up a heavy dish.

One of our favorites!  We use pitted prunes instead of dates and we leave out the capers and flavor with additional salt to make up for leaving out the capers. The prunes in the sauce are delicious!  I also substituted half and half for the cream to cut some calories and still turned out to be a decadent sauce!  Great recipe!

Delicious!  Could easily serve this for company.  Husband and son are often skeptical but tried it and thought it was delicious.  I had limited groceries and did not have the marscarpone cheese available so I substituted soft garden vegetable cream cheese.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe!

Nothing was wrong with the recipe but we didn't like the flavor.  My husband & I thought the sauce almost tasted like it was mayo based.

Phenomenal.  I substituted a gardein brand veggie chicken.  This was delightful and a surprising combination.
