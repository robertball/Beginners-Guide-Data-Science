Wonderful cookie! I'm usually not prone to making oatmeal cookies, but this cookie may have just turned me around. It's nice and cripsy on the outside yet chewy in the middle even after a couple of days.  The cinnamon combined with a touch of nutmeg gives it just the right amount of spice. I cut back on the oats, using 2 1/2 cups. vs. 3 and I also used a bag of semi-sweet miniature chocolate chips. The dough is very thick, so I rolled these by hand into 1 inch balls that I flattened just slightly. I baked these on parchment paper at 375 for 10 minutes. These do spread so be sure to bake them a few inches apart. Don't be tempted to overbake these or you'll have a hockey puck on your hands. I had to have one of these straight out of the oven risking burning my mouth, but I just couldn't resist - so good!!!

I've been making these cookies for more than 15 years.  My friends insist that I bring it them every holiday get-together.  The posted recipe produces great results, and it is very forgiving of substitutions.  It works with butter or margarine (not low-fat margarine, though), bread flour or all-purpose, whole wheat or white flour, pecans or walnuts, quick oats or old-fashioned.  The butter can be cold or completely melted.  I've even made them with flax seeds instead of an egg for a friend who's allergic to eggs.  I switched to using white sugar and a tablespoon of molasses instead of brown sugar, but they're great either way.  The biggest single factor in the the texture is the amount of oats; for consistent results, you should weigh the oats.  I use 8 oz (slightly less than 3 cups) of quick oats for a softer cookie.  One last tip: Use freshly ground nutmeg for the best results.  You can taste the difference.

Perhaps due to my altitude I ended up with a very crumbly mixture (similar to granola). I added an 1/8 of a cup of milk and it made them PERFECT! The   only other changes I made was I reduced the amount of cinnamon (due to personal taste) in half. Makes a PERFECT cookie....delish! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were very well received in our Christmas baskets this year.  I cut back on the cinnamon but otherwise followed the recipe.  When the dough is chilled they stay like a regular cookie, but I found they were really awesome when they were baked at room temp.  They really spread and became sort of lace cookies that were thin and crisp. Yummy :)

Not that good.  The dough is mostly butter and the cookies are too much like a crystallized butter/sugar mixture. Maybe more flour would help? I burned a batch and they turned out to be the best batch, so cook longer than you think and they will come out the best. Oh, and I skipped the nuts but walnuts in it would have been much better, would have helped the consistency.

This is THE oatmeal chocolate chip connoisseur's recipe to end the search! Kids & adults alike will not stop at one cookie. Chill the dough - that is my only recommendation - otherwise follow recipe exactly & prepare to consume multiple cookies.

Really good cookie with great flavor, just wish they wouldn't flatten out so much during baking.  I tried chilling the dough, using parchment paper, etc., but they still flatten.  Will definitely make again though!

Really good and easy! Only had 2cups of oats so added about 1/3c of extra flour and still turned out great! Used a half bag of mini chocolate chips (semi-sweet) and about equal amount of raisins, and left out nuts. Yummy!

I'm sure this would have been perfect as written, but I made a few changes based on our preferences.  I swapped oat flour for the flour, softened coconut oil for the butter, and coconut sugar for both sugars. Lined sheets with parchment paper. They turned out very nice.

I bought a store brand of oatmeal that didn't have the oatmeal cookie recipe on the lid.  I picked this recipe because it had the most 5 stars. But it crumbles.  It won't stick together.  I knew it'd need more than one cup of flour, and ended up adding a little, along with water to try to make it stick.

These cookies are so good. I make about 50 at a time and it's very difficult to keep them in the house. Everyone who comes over raids the cookie jar.

Very good.  A LOT of chips ... I might cut down next time.  Also, I tried to make "crunchy/crispy" cookies but those were more like "dry."  Next time I"ll cook for the minimum time.

Excellent recipe. I used half vanilla extract and half almond extract. I also used less then half a bag of chocolate chips. Careful not to let them get too thin. I usually use my air bake pan, this time my thicker dark pan was much better. Very tasty and easy!

They spread all over the pan making it obvious there was not enough flour in them. I then refrigerated the dough for an hour and they spread a little less but did not have the consistency of cookies. they were more like granola glued together. I gave it one star because the app would not let me give it zero.

This is the perfect little oatmeal cookie.  Great texture and flavor, not too sweet but sweet enough.   I'll be making these again soon.  Thanks for sharing!

Not thrilled with this recipe. Cookies are flat and brown. I followed the recipe to a T. I like soft, fluffy cookies so I’m just not happy. I made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies a few weeks ago from another recipe but forgot to save it so I decided to try this one. I think the sugars are out of whack. Usually I use equal parts white and brown sugar, so next time I will try that. They do taste good, just not what I was hoping for.

I am a novice cook so I was a little concerned these wouldn't turn out but they were perfect, and delicious!  I cooked mine for 9 minutes and that seems to have worked out well for a chewy cookie.  The only change I made was to omit the nuts - I like nuts but never in a dessert!

Extremely yummy. I'm not a follow_the_recipe_to_a_t type so I have a few changes to note. Measured everything except nutmeg, butter (I had less on hand, approximately a stick and a half instead of two), chocolate chips (just poured some in and they were a generic brand), and finally I ran out of cinnamon so I squeezed a cinnamon apple sauce fruit squeeze into my batter. I figured that would help make up for the shortage of butter. Made my dough drops a bit bigger...well my five year old did that part so I'd say about a heaping tablespoon. Recipe yielded 3.5 dozen for us. Cooked for exactly 10 minutes and let them stay on cookie sheet for ten minutes too. They were perfect!

This is our new go-to oatmeal cookie.  Just the right amount of spices and crispy/chewy goodness.
Instead of chocolate chips I often throw in a variety of cut up dried fruits: apricots, craisins, plums, raisins.  Soak the dried fruits in hot water about a minute, then drain before adding. If you don't soak them first, the fruits pull moisture from the cookie dough, changing the texture of the cookie.
The fruits make the cookies extra Yum! Compliments every time.

My new favorite oatmeal cookie! The only variations from the recipe I made was half all purpose flour and the other half whole wheat, and 1/3 white sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Turned out perfect!

I loved these cookies  both ways: soft and chewy and also crisp! I took them to the Super Bowl party, and they were enjoyed  by all. Will definitely keep making them for casual parties and ourselves!

I followed the directions,  yet they still seemed a little dry. I added 1/2 cup 2% milk and used 1cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup dried cranberries. Baked them at the same temperature for 10 minutes, they turned out wonderful and yummy!

Our family loved these! I loved that they are a little crispy on the outside and chewy/gooey on the inside. I followed the recipe exactly, using the baking time for chewier cookies. Next time I may try adding a little fiber, maybe some ground flax seed or millet or substitute a little whole wheat for the white. I might also, cut the amount of choc chips in half so the other flavors can stand out more. Excellent!!

I think these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I was so impressed by how perfect they turned out!  I used whole wheat flour and fresh grated nutmeg but otherwise followed the directions.  I made very large cookies & baked them for exactly nine minutes & they are just how we like them, chewy on the inside & slightly crisp on the outside.  This is definitely my new oatmeal cookie recipe!

Delicious! These are easy to make. If the cookies turn out really flat, add more oatmeal. I didn't have any walnuts so I just made chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. I think what sets this apart from other cookie recipes is the quality of the chocolate, as well as the cinnamon and nutmeg!

These are a great substitute for the Neiman Marcus cookies I usually make - much less fuss.  I cooked them no more than 8 minutes - didn't look done, but they cooled perfectly.

Excellent oatmeal cookie!  It was my first time making oatmeal cookies and the chocolate chips were great in it.  I unfortunately didn't have any walnuts but will make sure to add those next time.  I got nervous about the consistency of the cookie dough and added 1 tbsp of warm water and only used 2.5 cups of oatmeal but it would have been perfectly fine with the 3 full cups so next time I will follow the recipe accordingly but I will still have to add the 1 tbsp of water.

I made these cookies with only one change to the recipe. I added 2 1/2c of oats instead of 3.  Everything else was the same.  They are nice and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I baked them for about 12 minutes and they came out perfectly!

The flavor is fantastic, *BUT* I had to add a second egg. The dough is FAR too dry. I threw the first pan away. They were crumbles. I added a second egg and worked it into the dough by hand. After that, I increased the bake time to 10 minutes and let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes before moving them to the cooling rack. They were crunchy on the outside and chewy in the center.

Really, really yummy! I do think I need to reduce the number of chips and nuts because of the crumbliness.  (as some others have said) I also agree with other commenters that they should be taken out when they look like they're not done and left to rest before removing them from the baking sheet. But really tasty!

Excellent cookies .I only used about three quarters of the chocolate chips because I don't like them that chocolatey.  I found it necessary to use some non stick spray on the baking sheets because the cookies kept crumbling when I was trying to remove them from the sheet.  Other than that, they were wonderful and everyone loved them.  I also made a batch without chocolate chips and they were great chewy oatmeal cookies.

Great cookie! I did a combo of dark and semisweet chocolate chips, and skipped the nuts only because I didn't have any. I also did 1 1/2 cups of flour and 2 1/2 cups of oats, (simply because I misread the recipe) but it worked out great. Husband has eaten 8 since they came out of the oven :) Will make again for sure!

I've been making these cookies for only 12 years.  I always mixed them by hand for best results.  They are fondly referred to as the Best Cookies in the Whole World by many people in our family.  Be sure that you check your oven temperature is accurate and you don't overcook the cookie.  Pull them out even when they don't look done and let them rest.  Perfect every time!

Followed the recipe and they turned out amazing. I did use spelt flour instead of regular flour. Everybody loved them. I'm not a fan of cinnamon but luckily it's not even noticeable. The only issues I had is that the cookies were a bit crumbly when I pulled them out of the oven but once cooled they stayed together.

Easy and delicious, though I made a few tweaks!  Like a previous reviewer, my batter was dry and and crumbly and wouldn't hold together at all.  I used her suggestion and added skim milk slowly until it reached a thick batter consistency -- overall I needed about 1/2 cup.  I added 1 cup of Reeses Pieces since I'm making these for a Halloween get together and the colors were perfect, but the peanut butter chocolate combo was so delicious that I think it will be a year round addition!  I skipped the nuts since I added the additional candy, and also skipped the nutmeg and cinnamom for fear of having too many flavors in there and just added an extra splash of vanilla instead.  Mine took about 10-11 minutes to reach soft and chewy, so I think the recipe needs a bit more bake time than called for.

Excellent recipe! I've tried many over the years and this is definitely one of my favorites. I didn't have walnuts on hand but we didn't miss them. The cookies had wonderful flavor and texture. My last couple of batches were better than the first so I'd suggest preheating your oven an extra 15 minutes longer before baking for best results. Thanks for sharing!

These are the BEST oatmeal choc cookies ever! No need to try any other recipe! I baked mine at 365 to make sure they stayed chewy, took them out when it looked like they weren't quite done and let them finish "cooking" on the cookie sheet on the counter. SO GOOD!
