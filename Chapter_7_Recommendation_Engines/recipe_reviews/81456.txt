This was delicious!  The cranberry sauce sweetened the meat perfectly.  I used cranberry sauce with berries.  It looked pretty, but I can't say I noticed a difference in the taste.  It didn't have a noticable cranberry taste.  My grocery store didn't have pot roast, only tri-tip roast (it was on sale) so I used that.  After putting my roast in the crockpot I chopped up the onion, but also added a couple of teaspoons of chopped garlic, baby carrots, and sliced mushrooms (there was no more room for potatoes.)  Approximately 3 1/2 hours later the roast was done.  I turned down the crockpot to low.  I cut up potatoes and added more baby carrots to a seperate pot.  I laddled the liquid from the crockpot into my pot of potatoes and carrots and boiled them for about 15 minutes.  All the vegetables tasted delicious and I couldn't tell which had cooked in the crockpot and which had cooked on the stove.  I invited my parents over for dinner and everyone loved it.  The meat was moist and tender and everything had a touch of sweetness.  Even the kids had seconds.

This recipe was INCREDIBLE. I only used 1 can of whole cranberry sauce, and then 2 cups of beef broth with a half cup of red wine, then I added a packet of dry onion soup mix. My family is still giving me kisses...my husband...oooh he LOVED IT!! Thank you thank you thank you!! this is going to be a family FAVORITE.

The flavor was heaven!  The cranberry flavor was subtle but VERY good!  Next time I think I'll try using the cranberry sauce with chunks in it.  It was perfect with the 'fanned baked potato' recipe.  This will be our staple pot roast recipe!

Like others I used one can of regular and one can of jellied cranberries. Next time I'll use all regular because I love whole cranberries. I put in a bag of baby carrots half way through. Everything came out delicious. A nice, easy recipe.

Pot Roast isn't my favorite cut of meat but I thought this turned out very nice.  I used the whole cranberry sauce which was great. I forgot the water...opps but didn't need it. I also deglazed the browning pan with the onions before adding them to the slow cooker for extra flavor. My four pound roast was ready in four hours on high.

I absolutely loved this! Just ate the lefteovers for lunch. This is so much easier than my old pot roast recipe with tons of different seasonings, and I think this one has a better flavor.

I tried this recipe with chicken. I reduced the liquid by replacing all liquid with 1 can of chicken broth. Otherwise i followed the recipe exactly. The flavor on the chicken was amaising. I will definitely do this recipe again.

Sinfully good....what a meal on a lazy Sunday afternoon!!! Couldn't decide which I liked more so I added one can of jellied cranberry sauce, and one can of whole berry cranberry sauce, plus a few potatoes and small carrots to the pot for a well rounded meal. Yum!

Very tender and moist.  Next time I will use more salt and garlic.  The cranberries were a nice change and enhanced the flavor.  I too, used crushed cranberries as well as dried cranberries.   I will make again.

Awesome!  Had freshly made cranberry/orange sauce left over from Thanksgiving.  Used  twice the sauce called for and 1/2 the liquids, it turned out perfect!  It wasn't very cranberry'ish but it had an interesting flavor nobody could put their finger on.  Thickened the gravy with cornstarch and re-seasoned with salt/ pepper.  Great over mashed potatoes and green beans....

Made nice gravy.  I was expecting more of a tart cranberry taste but I used jellied sauce instead of whole berry.  Will have to try it with whole berry sauce next time.

I'm disappointed.  This roast was good, but it was just roast.  The cranberry flavor was too subtle.  If I make this recipe again, I will decrease the other liquids and add dried cranberries.

This was the best pot roast that I've ever made! My hubby and kids couldn't get enough! I reduced liquid to 2 cups of organic beef broth, I first added broth to crockpot along with 2 big handfuls of dried cranberries (I didn't have cranberry sauce so I used dried cranberries they plumper up and dissolved and their flavor was amazing!) I seasoned roast with salt and pepper and sprinkled with rice flour, browned the roast and set in crackpot. In the same pan I saut√©ed large diced onion and then deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of port wine. After scraping up all of the flavor bits from the bottom I poured the port onion mixture into the crackpot. About an hour before it was done I added 3 sweet potatoes diced pretty small and 2 portabella mushrooms sliced into 1/4 inch slices. This is definately a new favorite in our dinner rotation :)

It was good, but it was missing something, I just don't know what. My mom and I made a gravy out of the liquid using cornstarch which was good because it added moisture, she overcooked it a bit. The cranberry flavor was not strong enough.

I liked this the cranberry flavor wasn't strong but noticeable  and kind of sweet. My husband however thought it was just ok  so he covered his in worcestershire sauce.

this is a keeper! I used the onion soup mix, omitted the water, added chopped garlic, lots of sh'rooms and baby carrots. I also used the same cast iron pot that I browned the meat in for roasting in the oven: 350 for about 4hours. The whole cranberries really makes this dish!  Talk about your comfort food!  My sister is making this for Christmas dinner it was that good!

Very good slow cooker recipe.  The cranberry gives the beef a nice sweet yet tart taste.  My 8 year old liked it and he doesn't usually go for sweeter meat dishes.

It was okay. The cranberry sauce (whole berry) did add a nice subtle flavor, but aside from that I didn't think it was very flavorful. Way too much liquid for my crock pot, but partly my fault for adding carrots and potatoes. I can't make a pot roast without carrots and potatoes. :)

This was so tender, juicy, and had a wonderful sweet taste due to the cranberries. It is one of the easiest meals to make. I served it with homemade mashed potatoes, sauteed zucchini & a Merlot wine.  My partner invited friends over and I was a bit nervous because they are both great chef's who own a chic restaurant. They loved it! Whew!

This was good. I have a small slow cooker, so I left out the water, and only used 1 can of cranberry. I used some dried minced 3 onion mix I had instead of a white onion. I was also to lazy to pre-brown the roast, so I just put it in the roast straight into the slow cooker. I added cubed potatoes about 3 hours before serving it, and then shopped carrots 2 hours before it was ready. Turned out great.

This is wonderful!  The meat is tender with only a hint of sweet from the cranberry sauce!  You can also skip the step of melting the cranberry sauce before pouring it in the crock pot.  Instead, just blend it up until it is loose and then stir it into the broth before pouring it over the beef.

My new favorite pot roast recipe! I omitted the water from the sauce and broth mixture and didn't add oil to my nonstick pan when browning the meat.

Excellent flavor! I omitted the water, but still had plenty of liquid. This is my new go to recipe for pot roast. Next time I might use pearl onions because they will soak up the wonderful sauce.

Wonderful!  I made this yesterday (halved the recipe) and I just love it. The broth/sauce is wonderful over a vegetable like steamed green beans.  I used the cranberry sauce with whole cranberries included and I'm glad. 
I expect to make this again often.

This was very pleasing to both adults and kids.  HOWEVER, I would caution you about being careful not to overcook the chuck.  I found mine was a little dry.  Like another cook I made a gravy adding just a little salt and some cracked pepper.  The gravy was an overwhelming hit. I loved the subtle cranberry flavor BUT will be doing this again with round roast that will fall apart.

This was an OK recipe.  But I like cooking in the oven much better with potatoes and carrots and lets just skip the cranberries.  All boils down to a personal taste.

I made this last week, and my family LOVED it. Great flavor! I did not change much from recipe, just used chunky cranberry sauce. Can't wait to make it again.

I chopped cranberries and cooked them in the beef broth with brown sugar. I added a leek, small amount of celery, and carrots cut French style. Then I cooked the roast in my Dutch oven on the lowest setting and cooked it for 5 hours. Supper yummy!

I made this last night using the original list of ingredients; since the recipe does not specify, I used whole berry sauce. Though I switched the cook time and temperature to 8 hours on low, I changed nothing else. The meat cooked perfectly, but both I and my husband (who doesn't care for "unusually flavored" meats) thought the beef was terribly bland, with way too little cranberry flavor. The sauce was very, very thin, more a tasty broth than a sauce. We tried pouring it over rice, and it just fell straight through to the plate, though the whole cranberries did add a nice sweetness. In retrospect, I don't know why the flouring step is included. It does absolutely nothing to thicken the sauce, and I think browning without the flour would work just as well if not better, and with less mess. I will probably try this recipe again, but next time I will not add water and will probably add another can of cranberry sauce, perhaps regular instead of whole berry or a mixture. I will also deglaze the pan with red wine and the onions next time, as at least one other reviewer suggested. Definitely not a bad recipe, but it didn't meet our expectations as written.

Easy and delicious. I found the cranberry flavor to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there. It added a really interesting sweet, complex flavor. I added large chunks of sweet potatoes and carrots to the slow cooker, as well as a tot of dark spiced rum, and substituted a gluten free flour mix for browning the roast (for my celiac spouse). I will definitely make this again.

For a twist on your boring, old slow cooker Pot Roast recipe, this is FABULOUS! I took the cue from 'i luv 2 cook' and deviated a bit from there. Boiled 2 cups beef broth, 1 can cranberry sauce and 1/2 cup Merlot while browning roast on both sides, forgot flour. Mixed sliced onions, carrots & red potatoes on bottom of crock pot about 2" high, sprinkled with Beau Monde Seasoning & Italian herbs. Placed roast on top of veges, filled sides of roast with more veges, even to top of roast. Poured cranberry/broth mixture slowly over roast & sprinkled with pkg of Lipton Onion Soup mix. Cookled on low, 6-7 hours & wala, everyone loved it!!

Okay, but I don't think the cranberry sauce does that much for the roast.  Hubby and our guests enjoyed this, but I won't be keeping the recipe.

This was the first recipe from this site that was a miss for me. My husband liked it, and I liked the flavor in general, but it was greasy!  It felt like because it cooked in its own fat for hours it was coated with fatty grease. I would not make it again unless I could find a way to fix that.

had all of the tartness of cranberries with no redeeming qualities. I made it exactly as written. I thought that since I so enjoy both cranberry sauce and pot roast this would be perfect, but it wasn't even edible. Wasted delicious homemade sauce and a fairly expensive cut of meat.

This was excellent. Just a hint of sweet and sour flavor.  The only thing I changed was the amount of liquid. Cutting the amount in half still gives you plenty to make gravy. Also added a bit of garlic powder.

I'm sorry, but this recipe lacked flavor (I followed the directions exactly).  I expected much more, because the other raters loved it.  I think the 4 hour cooking time made this roast a little tough.  (I usually cook this cut for 8 to 10 hours.)  But aside from the texture, the meat was bland.  My daughter ate hers with a dipping sauce from the fridge, and my husband said he couldn't taste it.  I have to agree, it was less than flavorful.

Wow, this pot roast was truly delicious! I kept thinking that there weren't enough ingrediants for it to be as good as everyone said but when I tasted it I was floored.  I originally made this for a potluck at work and decided when I tasted it that it was too good to share!  My husband who is a picky eater even rated it at 9.5 out of ten!  Allrecipes has never let me down.

How many ways can you say "delicious"? I used a Boston butt pork roast and chicken broth instead of beef. I served it over rice. This is a keeper! YUM!

I followed this recipe without any deviations, cooking it in a Dutch oven.  I was disappointed because the roast didn't seem to take on any of the flavor of the cranberry sauce and I found the end product to be bland.  Overall, I was very disappointed and I won't make this recipe again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I had high hopes that our family would like this because we love cranberry sauce. But, I am sad to say it wasn't the best. The roast turned out very well, but we just didn't care for the flavor of the sauce... Sorry! It was worth a try though.

I only use 1 cup of beef broth and omit the water. The beef will make more broth. I also use whole cranberry jelly, add garlic and a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. I do just throw everything in the slowcooker, it will blend itself. Super happy I found this recipe, have made it a few times for family and now they request it. Great for thanksgiving cravings! Thank you for the recipe.

This Pot Roast was delicious.  The tip on adding additional vegtables (potatoes, carrots, onions) to a pot and boiling 15 minutes (left mine boiling for longer until tender) in some of the broth you pull from the crock pot prior to the roast being ready was a simple way to stretch this meal even further.  While I loved the roast, I could see a complaint with this being a little too sweet for some tastes--If this were not the case, this was an easy 5-star meal.

My Mother-in-law liked it, but my fiance didn't.

Love a recipe you can put in a crock pot and forget about. I cut the recipe in half and it turned out great. I think searing it before putting it in the pot was a great touch. I will make this again. Good recipe.

This was so easy and super yummy!  I will be making this again.  I put some potatoes and carrots in with the meat.  It made for a well-rounded meal.

This was not only easy to make but also very delicious. The cranberry sauce gave it an exquisite tangy taste. I left out the cup of water and still had a whole lot of sauce. I also added 3 fresh carrots cut diagonally to the last 10 minutes. In a saucepan using cornstarch instead of flour I thickened the sauce. Served it with rice the first day and used the remaining with butterfly pasta the next day.
