This is a really good recipe for a spicy chicken soup. I used half water and half chicken stock for the broth instead of all water. It gave the soup a little more flavor, I think. I also added fresh garlic to the mix and doubled up on the peppers. I like things HOT!!! A very versatile soup, you could add or omit almost any veggies that you please. I will make this again, and probably play with the recipe more each time!

I loved this soup...or souw as we called it because it turned out much closer to a stew than a soup.  I used 3 cups of mixed chicken instead of the wings and used the water the chicken had been cooking in for the water.  I only put a 1/2 onion in as I am not a huge fan.  Next time, I may add some extra jalapeno.  I liked it enough to take some to work for my co-workers to try and they all liked it.  In fact, I am forwarding this recipe to one of them as we speak.

I planned to change two things right off the top which were red potatoes in place of the white (hate peeling potatoes and typically leave the skin on red) and then subbing some of the water/bouillon for chicken broth. Somehow though the fresh green beans got left off of my list so I saved the frozen corn I bought for another day and just used a frozen corn, green bean, pea, and carrot melody instead.I also found some mushroom stems and pieces in the fridge that I threw in at the last second. This recipe is so universal as to what you have on hand or things that need used up. My only complaint is that the base was extremely thin. My advice is to saute the veggies for a few minutes and then add a couple of teaspoons of flour to the mix before adding the can peas/hominy and other liquids for a bit of a thicker more rich broth.

5 stars for ease of preparation and the combination of ingredients. I did change a few things like using 4 cups chicken broth instead of water (always keep organic on hand) and reduced the water to 2 1/2 cups and use 2 packets of granulated chicken bouillon (hate cubes). Did not put in jalapeno peppers. Whole can of tomato sauce. No hominy! Used frozen: chicken wings, zucchini (already sliced), butternut squash (already sliced) and mixed vegetables. The only things I had to slice and dice were the potatoes and onions (didn't have frozen chopped in freezer)> I'm a  firm believer in keeping my freezer stocked with fresh frozen foods. Really cuts down on prep time. I also used a bay leaf and a pinch of allspice for extra flavor. My family cannot handle very spicy food. Turned out great and added this recipe to "My Recipes". Thank you for an all-in-one pot meal!!

This soup is SO good!  My 3 guys ate every last bite, with hot, buttery cornbread!  And wanted me to make it for supper again tomorrow! 
I made it with fresh-frozen veggies from our garden--squash, zucchini, green beans, corn, shallots, and garlic. I did not have hominy or chickpeas, so I added a little extra squash and zucchini, and added 2 hand-fulls of egg noodles instead of  potatoes.

I had to modify the original recipe because of my husband’s taste. I think it’s good with the new modifications. Scallions for onion, red and green peppers for zucchini and squash, pasta for potatoes. Extra water and seasoning for taste.

I did make a few changes. I added diced seasoned stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and used unsalted chicken broth. I used chicken breast and added a lot of seasoning. I loved it! It was very comforting on these cold days . Makes a nice lunch to take to work.. the reason for only 4 stars is because of the changes I made

Very good, versatile and easy.  I  used homemade chicken stock and leftover homemade onion soup for the base.

I did not use chicken wings or any meat at all. Next time I will not add potatoes and I will use the whole can of tomato sauce. Without any meat, I only cooked this soup for twenty minutes so that the vegetables kept there integrity and still had beautiful colors. My family adored this and it will become a staple go-to for any time of the year.

I made two substitutions. Boneless chicken breast for the meat and chicken broth in place of the water, eliminating the bouillon cubes. Salt to suit your taste because of eliminating the bouillon. Hearty AND tastey! Yummmmm
