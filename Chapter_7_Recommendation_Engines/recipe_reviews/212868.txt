Holy cow... Don't just sit there!! Go snip some rosemary (and don't even THINK about using the dried stuff) and make these cookies! They are fantastic. I ate half a dozen while baking these and I still can't keep my hands off of them! The size of this tasty little cookie is perfect, the sweetness is perfect, the rosemary flavor is perfect, the crisp is perfect... What a divine addition to our holiday cookie tray. Thank you SO much for this recipe. It is a new favorite in our house. :)

I was torn between this recipe and another rosemary recipe here, so I made mini-batches of both, baked them in the toaster oven, and compared them.  Although my family seemed to like the other recipe better, I definitely appreciate that these have more of a "cookielike" texture.  They are also quite hearty, and not too sweet, but sweeter than the other batch I made.  Thanks, sueb.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is cutting the amount of sugar down to 1/2 C.  They were really good but so sweet they made my teeth cry! Also, i would put the slices back in the freezer for about 20 min while the oven is preheating, so that they hold their shape better while baking.

These bake up beautifully!  I have now made 2 batches and have a request for a 3rd batch before next weekend.  I used dry rosemary, which I ground until almost a powder so there are no hard spikey bits.  The flavor comes through without being overwhelming.  They are a lovely delicate treat with a cup of tea.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Okay, I'm not sure why I always think I can slice cookies bc I clearly can't.  Every time I try a sliced cookie recipe, the slices always end up looking like little malformed blocks of dough, so I end up rolling the pieces up and flattening them out into little discs, and they always end up less flat than they're supposed to.  This time was no exception for me--don't know what my malfunction is, but obviously it's there.  So I ended up baking for about 18-20 minutes and they were little cookies with little muffin type tops.  These are a sweet cookie, not savory at all, with a punch of rosemary.  They are okay by themselves but better with tea.  These were fun to make (minus my inability to roll and slice)--maybe one of htese days I will learn how to cut cookie slices and revisit slicing these little cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Rosemary is one of my favorite herbs. I have a plant growing in my kitchen and couldn't wait to try this recipe. These are wonderful! They're light, crispy, and delicious. I think I expected a more savory finished product, but these are a sweet treat (not overly sweet, just right.) I will definitely be making these again - the next time my plant goes out of control. Thanks for a great new use for Rosemary!

What an interesting cookie.  Followed the recipe as written and thought it was good.  You really have to have tea or coffee with this cookie.  One of my daughters took a bite and wouldn't have another.  I froze one log for about a week and didn't taste as good as the first batch, so I wouldn't recommend freezing any portion of it.

Excellent cokies! I love rosemary so I had to try this. Easy to make but I only got 30 cokies not 60 like the recipe states, but maybe is because I like my cookies on the thick side they would have been like discs if had cut them thiner.Thanks for sumitting your recipe.

These were wonderful!  A nice change for a cookie.  My children loved them.  If you are looking for a good way to cut the logs, then try using a super sharp knife and rotate your log about an 1/8 inch after each cut.  I like to use dental floss.  Just slide your floss under your log where you are going to cut and wrap the floss up and around the log, cross the floss at the top and pull each end till it cuts your cookie off.  You get a perfect shape each time.  If you use the floss be sure not to freeze your dough.

Excellent. These are a lovely savory cookie with a hint of sweet. Very easy to make too. I baked some on parchment paper and some on a silpat mat. The cookies on the silpat came out evenly colored while the parchment paper ones were darker on the bottom. I cut mine a bit over 1/4" and baked 12 minutes, I advise you check them at 8-9 minutes depending on your oven. Next time I will only bake for 9-10 minutes.

Delicate flavors when first baked, but after a couple of hours, the sweetness really comes through. These are nice bite sized cookies. Very nice with some Earl Grey tea!

I'm amazed at this simple cookie recipe! The cookies are delicious. I'm not very skilled with the whole cutting a roll of dough into circles, so I used a small cookie scoop instead. Worked out just fine :)

First of all, YUM!!! The reason I had to give it four stars is because I am the only person in my family  who enjoys them. I uses 1-1/2 cups of all purpose flour and omitted the whole wheat flour because I didn't have any whole wheat flour. These are great nonetheless, and I will definitely be making them again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This recipe creates crisp, thin little cookies that can be served with sweet things, savory things, or alone. I brought them to a brunch and they paired really nicely with the soft cheeses. 

For me they don't really work as a cookie, but they were still nice. Next time I'll use less sugar and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and possibly even a bit of grated Parmesan so that they are more like a sweet, aromatic cracker.

Chilled dough is critical. I was tempted to add more flour when forming the logs because the dough seemed sticky, but after chilling, it was fine. Slice as quickly as possible in order to keep the shape, and put them in the oven right away or else put the tray in the refrigerator. Parchment paper on the cookie sheet lets the crispy gems lift off easily.

I was a little skeptical how these might taste. Picked the rosemary from the garden and my 3yo hated the smell. (I love rosemary!) followed the directions except used all white flour bc that’s all I had. After they were done my 3yo and 1yo kept sneaking into the kitchen to get more. It’s a rosemary sugar cookie. And absolutely phenomenal!!!

Two thumbs up from my family.
The only thing is my husband thought there could be a bit more Rosemary in the cookie so next time I will add 1/2 -1 more tablespoon. Other that that great cookie.
Thank you for  the recipe,

Unusual, but stunning! I needed to add about 2 T. of water to my dough to get it to come together, because as written I had a bowl of powder. Not sure why. Try these with a smear of ricotta cheese!

I enjoyed these cookies, which seem more suited to an adult palate than many other cookies around the holiday season.  I opted to cut the sugar by about a third, and may cut it a little further to make a more savory cookie.

Gotta give this one 5 stars... I reduced the sugar by about 1/8 Th of a cup, used fresh Rosemary, cooked on a Silpat for 10 minutes.  Quite a different taste, the sweet and savoury is unique, a bit like a shortbread... But would be good with a soft cheese as another reviewer stated.  I will certainly make these again, easy to pull together, and with the slice and bake,  fast to get them portioned and baked.

Made to recipe. Rolling them in wrap was laughable and fun until I get the hang of it. Mine were about the size of a 50 cent piece. They lost their shape as I cut them so I put them in the freezer for a few hours.
The flavor is nice, a little sweeter than I was expecting but definitely a nice change from chocolate chips and oatmeal raisin which are our staples :-) I'll make these again. Thanks for the new recipe.

Followed the recipe to a T...except for the fact that I may have used more rosemary (maybe a bit too much even). The cookies are still delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe, I will make these again!

Extremely good! Make sure the batter is good and cold before you cut them!
