I really liked this.  Can't believe no one else has reviewed it.  The only thing I changed (you all know me) why use grape juice?  I used the real thing - a white wine !!!  Update; I still can't believe this is so unreviewed.  I use at least 2 inch thick Sirloin Chops and I have dropped the steak seasoning and rub sage on the chops. Also I bake about half that time.  Take out at 140 degrees.

My husband and I just fixed this.  It was a lot of work and in the end, not worth the effort.  Too many conflicting flavors.  The grape juice and apples just didn't fit with the onions and mushrooms. I won't be fixing it again

I had left over white grape juice from canning and this recipe was a great find!  We did not stuff the chops. It was a little work but we loved it!  My father in-law said the sauce would be great on rice.   We

Excellent! Even with only the barest of items from my barren pantry (dried onions!) this was delicious. Will definitely be adding to my pork chop repertoire.
