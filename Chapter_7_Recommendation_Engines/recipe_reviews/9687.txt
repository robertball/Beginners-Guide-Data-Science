Someone asked about cracking - here's the secret for all biscotti. When you take them out of the oven the first time, cover with a damp towel while they cool. They'll slice perfeclty without crumbling.

This was very easy to make.  I used fresh orange juice in place of the liqueur and they were wonderful.  I would cut back on the almonds a bit for my own personal taste next time.

I make this recipe all the time, it is so easy and tastes so good.  I leave out the almonds though and use 2 teaspoons orange oil instead of the zest and liqueor.  Then because of the oil I cook 10 minutes longer.  And of course, because I love chocolate I dip these halfway in melted chocolate and cool on set on wax paper.

These are crispy and delicious. We love the orange flavor, so if I have orange oil available, I'll use 2-3t of the oil in place of the orange.In place of chopped toasted almonds, try toasted sliced almonds.I think it gives more of a nutty flavor than the small bits.

These are very good.  I used orange juice in place of the liqueur and added a tsp of orange extract.  I doubled the recipe.  I reserved some of the almonds to sprinkle on the top of the loaves before baking.  Next time I will cut back on the cinnamon to about half - personal preference.  I formed the dough on the cookie sheet which was covered by foil - much easier to handle.

My mom cannot eat sugar so I made some major changes to the original recipe, plus I thought I'd add somethings of my own to it. Here's what I changed: 3/4 cups white sugar became: 3/4 cups splenda 1 orange zested became: 1 orange zested and juiced 2 tbs orange liquor became: 2 tbs dark rum  I mixed everything the same, creamed the butter with the splenda and mixed the orange juice, zest, and rum in with the splenda, butter, and cinnamon. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I am quite pleased with the result, and my parents liked it a lot too.   I thought this was a great recipe and I enjoyed playing around making it, thanks for sharing :)

An excellent and easy recipe to make.  Like someone else suggested, I substituted the orange liquor with some fresh orange juice and finished it off with an orange icing glaze.  Super!

This biscotti was just ok.  I didn't find the flavor was all that great, and the texture wasn't the greatest either.  But they weren't a complete flop - I've just made better ones before so this was a disappointment.

Dough was more stiff than some biscotti I have made. I substituted pecans for almonds, and added 1/3 cup of dried cranberries to this recipe. Beyond the orange liqueur, I added 1 tsp of orange extract instead of orange zest. Worked well. Will use this recipe again.

I had a friend's recipe so used this to type it up - combined the two.  
Use toasted Pecans. Orange Juice or Apricot Brandy.  
Add 1 tsp. Vanilla; 1/4 tsp. Almond Extract.
Grease and flour cookie sheets.
And best of all = Slice with Elec Knife

I substituted orange juice for the orange liquer in this recipe, but the biscotti really lacked flavor.  If I make this recipe again, I'll definitely use the liquer.  My biscotti also ended up so crumbly that they literally fell apart in small pieces when they were cut.

Yum!!!!  Like most people... I made changes.  Used canola oil instead of butter.  Used frozen orange juice concentrate instead of orange liquor.  Used pistachios, as I didn't have almonds. 

My past biscotti have always been non-fat and rock hard.  These had a great texture!  I'm not sure of the texture that biscotti are supposed to have... but I thought that these were excellent.

These are super yummy and addictive.  Will make again!

I didn't change a thing. I hate it when reviewers change the recipe then give it a lower rating based on their changes. I did use an orange liqueur  (Gran Gala) like the recipe says but I think most of the generous orange flavor comes from using all that zest. Use a big orange, or maybe an orange and a half if they're smaller.  The dough was sticky, I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to work with it but I worked fast and it came out fine.  These are delicious!
