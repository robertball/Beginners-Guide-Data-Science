These were heavenly! I don't know what the problem was for the previous user and the cheese, first I don't know how long you beat the cheese for but I did mine for about 2 minutes and it was nice and smooth, no chunks at all.. maybe your cheese was bad or you beated for too long or not enough? Secondly, I see marascapone in almost every grocery store I go in. I would think cream cheese would give it a whole different taste. Anyway, the only problem I had was for them making it to the serving platter. lol This recipe also made about 16 medium plump strawberries for us and was a huge hit! Will definitely make these again and again.

These things are out of this world!! Oh my gosh they're so good! None of us could stop eating them. Even the men were silent (other than moans) when they bit in to them. Yes... they're that good. I followed it to a T other than i couldn't find the mascarpone cheese so I used philidelphia cream cheese. Makes a TON of filling though... you can do way more than 16 berries. I also dipped the ends of some of the berries in chocolate, let it set, then put filling in. Awesome!!!!!

A slightly sweet, creamy treat.  Next time I'll sift the confectioner's sugar to avoid lumps. I didn't have coarse sugar and didn't think of rolling the strawberries in granulated sugar; it probably would have helped the tartness of a few of the strawberries.  I halved the recipe and it was plenty for the two of us.

Pretty good but I have to confess, I used cream cheese because I could not find mascarpone. I live in rural area so we don't have alot of what is avaliable at most stores. This worked great with the cream cheese though. I thinned it with a little milk and beat it for a few minutes so that it would fluff up a bit. I am excited to make these for family summer get togethers with farm fresh strawberries!

Wow, everybody went crazy about it! a really huge success with no fuss at all: I served these beautiful roses at my kid's Confirmation party, and got rave reviews. I used cream cheese (the lighter version, less fat than the regular and extremely less fat than mascarpone cheese!), didn't bother with the sugar and used simply granulated sugar I had handy, and a tablespoon of lemon juice, that's all. Delicious and impressive

I hate to give poor reviews... but this one just DID NOT WORK.  After reading other reviews I made sure that my ingredients were at room temperature and that I did not overly beat the mascarpone cheese but it still got lumpy, something like ricotta, just like one of the other reviewers said.

The directions for this are misleading; they should read 'gently mix together the cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla'. Beating the cheese causes it to separate. Even thought I am an accomplished cook, mascarpone cheese is not easily found and so I have not ever used it.When I found this recipe I thought it would make a great topping for a lemon chiffon cake I was making for a party, and since I follow directions to the letter proceeded to BEAT the cheese......    so I ended up with $6 of cheese down the drain and a concoction that looked like ricotta!  The flavor was good, but I thought a tad sweet so I would recommend cutting the sugar by 1/2 a cup. I ended up using this recipe but with cream cheese (and not as much sugar) and it turned out great for my cake.

Mine turned out too runny, I don't know what went wrong. Maybe I just needed heavier whipped cream, but the sauce just ran right out of the berries. It did make clean-up a little more fun though (if you know what I mean)!

I used this filling in my jellyroll recipe.  It was amazing.  I did increase the whipping cream to 1 cup before whipping it.  You must have patience folding the cheese mix and the whipping cream together.

These were very good and didn't take a long time to make.  I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the mascarpone mix, which really finished it off.

Using the same idea of strawberry rose with cream cheese and brown sugar mixed together, and it was FABULOUS! Not too much work other than cutting the strawberries.

I made this recipe as directed several months ago and it was great.I decided to make it again for my family yesterday, but my grocery store didn't have a good strawberry selection. I was only able to get several small strawberries that looked alright, so I made some adjustments.
I baked some brownies, cut pieces for everybody, dolloped the cheese mixture on the brownies, and then placed thin sliced strawberries on top. The combination was excellent.
