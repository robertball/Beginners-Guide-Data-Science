When I make this, I like to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt as canned condensed soups can be quite salty on their own. I don't usually add the two tablespoons of water, I'll add a tablespoon or so of worchestershire sauce and maybe a little milk if I want a thinner gravy. This is one of the recipes I cherish most as my Mom made it for us kids when we were growing up.

I have made this recipe for years.  The only differences in my recipe are:  boneless pork chops, no salt, granulated garlic, and a 4 oz. can of mushroom bits and pieces.

Really, really enjoyed this recipe. A bit of advice though: don't brown the chops as long as they say to. I found after maybe 3 minutes per side they were just fine. Will make again. :)

Very tasty! I had to make a slight adjustment since I can't eat much salt. So I saved the mushroom stems and saut√©ed them in soft margarine, then added flour and milk to make a white sauce with mushrooms (mushroom sauce) , substituting this for the canned soup. then followed the rest of the directions. It is really a keeper!

I didn't have golden mushroom soup so I had to improvise. I used regular mushroom soup and mixed in 1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp ketchup. I browned the chops in olive oil and put them into a pan. After the mushrooms were browned I poured the sauce into the pan and warmed it a bit. Then poured this over the chops and cooked covered for 1 hour. The sauce was delicious. I want to try this again with the golden mushroom soup. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My husband and I both have high blood pressure so I also substituted garlic powder for garlic salt trying to cut the high sodium content of this dish. It was easy and came out exactly like I wanted it. I made mashed potatoes for the gravy and as some other reviewers posted I doubled my gravy. It was fantastic!The pork chops came out so tender you could cut them with a fork. Will definitely make again!

Followed directions exactly (substituted garlic powder instead of garlic salt), and this was a big hit.  The meat is moist and very flavorful.  Will definitely be making this again!!

Great recipe! Never really been a fan of using canned soups in recipes however I was in rush this looked good. Followed the recipe to the tee- only doubled it. Only thing I found it needed was a little more water to the gravy . Personal preference.....can really use this gravy recipe for anything. Thanks for sharing:)

Overall this was delicious.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had in the pantry.  I didn't have golden mushroom soup, so I used regular cream of mushroom.  I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder, salt and pepper and then pan fried them until they were golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side and then finished them off, covered in foil, in a 400 degree oven.  Then I added diced red onion and sliced crimini mushrooms to the pan and sauteed them until caramelized - then I added about 1/4 cup each of sherry and white wine and cooked it off until it was about 1/2...then added the mushroom soup and water.  The sauce was still super thick and I think I would add more water to it next time.  Try it with the sherry and wine.  It's delicious.

We make this at our home all the time.  Kids love it, pork chops are always tender.  Served over minute rice.  We add a lot of fresh mushrooms (or canned depending on availability) and its always a hit!

I live this recipe. Unfortunately I didn't have all of the ingredients in hand so I improvised. I used cream of celery and omitted the mushrooms. Using the CoCel was a great substitute for the mushroom soup. I made it with buttermilk mashed potatoes and used the extra sauce as gravy. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!

These were nice and juicy, which is good since a lot of pork chop recipes I've tried come out kind of dry and tough. Like others suggested, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but otherwise followed the recipe. The flavor was pretty good, but mostly all you taste is the overpowering mushroom soup--which is good if you like mushroom soup, but it seemed like the fresh mushrooms were mostly there for decoration. This recipe is a good start, but I think I'll be looking for ways to improve on it.

Holy cow, this was awesome! I don't know how, but I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand, and made this for hubby and me. I only changed two things: I used two large center-cut chops, bone in; and the seasoning... I seasoned the chops with Lawry's and cracked pepper, as opposed to seasoning the soup.
Served with white rice and pan-roasted garlic asparagus. Absolutely delish. Thank you for sharing!

Good, but I think the addition of a small onion would have brought more flavor.  Served with mashed potatoes and fresh peas and carrots.

I didn‚Äôt have garlic salt. I mixed sea salt, garlic powder and the black pepper together and then rubbed it into the chops.  It turned out AMAZING!! Served it with egg noodles. I only wish I would‚Äôve had more sauce for the noodles. But that was probably because of my skillet (just a cast iron) being a little small for everything.

Yes I made some substitutions partially due to what i did and didnt have in the cupboard. As others stated, i also did not use any salt or garlic salt but garlic powder instead. And for soup i used beefy mushroom. Instead of water i added a bit of milk and for more flavor i also added an envelope of onion mushroom soup mix. I diced up some fresh mushrooms and a little onion as well. (I cant get eniugh mushrooms)

First off, this was extremely easy to make. Great for busy family but still need to get dinner served. I added a little Cayenne pepper for a little extra flavor. Spooning the gravy over rice was a nice added touch.

This was really tasty but I did change the cooking directions a tad and added a couple of things, my personal preferences.  I had 2 pork loin chops, each about 2 inches thick and about 8 oz. of crimini mushrooms that needed to be used asap. I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and butter, then transferred to a bowl.   Seasoned the chops with onion powder and a good amount of ground pepper and seared on both sides.  I whisked the golden mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of dry sherry, added the mushrooms and poured it over the chops.  Turned the heat down to low, covered and cooked for 45 minutes (due to the thickness of the chops), and spooned the sauce over the chops every 15 minutes or so.  It turned out really well and the flavors reminded me so much of a recipe with chicken and rice that my Mom used to make once a month when I was growing up.

My friends mother used to make this many, many years ago and I was always invited for dinner when it was served. It was always served with green beans and rice, no exceptions! I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible but I couldn't find golden mushroom soup so I added a tablespoon of crushed tomatoes and a little red wine, two of the ingredients that are in the golden.  I've always had it with thin, boneless pork loin chops so that's what I went with. I doubled the sauce and cooked it for  30 minutes. This isn't something that I will make often but I will make it again. Thanks!!

I bought extra thick cut pork chops from my butcher, and followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of fresh chopped garlic. It is a new addition to the family favorites list.

I thought this was a really good! It's really nice to have something quick and easy to prepare for dinner after a long day at work. I will most definitely make again! I also have dentures, and I can't eat tough meat. This was nice and tender. We had it on rice, but I'm sure it would also go well with noodles or potatoes.

I've made this recipe several times.  It's brainlessly so simply and so delicious!. You must use bone-in chops and chops that are at least 1 to 1 and a half 1/2 inches thick. The bone enhances the flavor. The result are chops that are flavorful and tender and,  gravy that is delicious on mashed potatoes or anything else you choose to serve it on.

Made with only 2 thick cut chops.  Used healthy choice mushroom soup,  1/2  tsp  garlic salt,  1/3  tsp pepper.  removed mushroom mixture from pan ,  added pork chops and soup,  simmered for a couple of hours..  Added mushrooms to soup mixture, warmed and  served over egg noodles.   Absolutely DELICIOUS
Be sure to brown the chops very well, quite dark, to give the best flavor to the sauce!!

Had no mushrooms and only had cream of mushroom soup, but other than that, it was husband approved (and he's my hardest critic lol). Paired it with spicy green beans and rice so we had plenty of flavor on our plates!

I will definitely make this again. My husband LOVED it.

Next time I will have more time. While I simmered the chops for the 15 minutes noted in the recipe, and they were done, they were not as tender as I would have liked them to be. I think a little more time in the pan would fix that. 

I also used the light cream of mushroom soup, and while it was really good, I'm wondering if the regular would not have been better. But that's what I had on hand so that's what I used. (Next time I might add some chopped onions......)

All in all, it's going in our family book o' recipes to be added to the rotation.

So quick and easy.  I kept to the recipe except for one small thing.  I did use just garlic powder instead of garlic salt, due to the salt in the soup and I didn't miss it at all.  I definitely will make sure I make some mashed potatoes or rice next time with it to use with the mushroom gravy that was made here.  Feel free to use boneless chops if need be, that was all I had on hand and they were still nice.  Yum.

Wow, this was really good! I followed the directions, except I - like others-did not have golden mushroom soup, and used regular cream of mushroom soup.  I also used minced garlic and not powdered garlic. We had potatoes, green beans, and a salad. I will use this recipe again. It was so tender and juicy! Thank you!

I used white cooking wine (3Tbsp) instead of water and I added the onions when I put the chops back in.  This was so easy and delicious! Definately has become one of my go to recipes.

I've made a very similar version of this for years. My husband and all of our picky kids gobbled it up. Often use milk instead of water, regular mushroom soup (I'll have to try the golden mushroom!), a bit of Worcester sauce as others mentioned, but I mix in a packet of dry onion soup mix wit the liquid. I'm not a fan of pork chops or pork roasts, but I love this! I make extra sauce to pour over rice too

I made this for dinner tonight. They all loved it. I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used canned. I used bacon grease instead of olive oil, cook pork chop in to start. Then followed the rest of the recipe. I't turned out great.

This was a nice and simple weeknight dinner.  I deglazed the pan with soy sauce and used regular cream of mushroom soup rather than golden mushroom.  As previous reviews suggested, I skipped garlic salt but used onion powder instead then added minced garlic to the sauce.  Also added about a tablespoon of dried oregano to give a little more flavor.  Smelled wonderful while cooking and my sons cleared their plate.  This is a great go-to recipe to use when you're short on time.

Easy and delicious! Because of my on-hand supplies, I substituted canned mushrooms and added them to the soup (eliminated cooking mushroom step), and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as suggested in another review.  Will make again!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did have to use regular mushroom soup though as I couldn't find golden mushroom soup at the store.

I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, instead of golden mushroom. Plus 2 mire tablespoons of water and a splash of chicken broth. I serve ut over rice.

Very simple to make. I did have to substitute regular mushroom soup as another reviewer did and adding 1 tbsp. each of worcestershire sauce and ketchup to it. Turned out great though.

I just used this recipe tonight, and it was very easy and very good.  I had two problems:  1.  I had no pork chops so I used chicken breasts, and 2.  I will make double the gravy next time.  The gravy problem could be due to the large chicken breasts.  I'll use pork chops next time.  Very good, and thank you.

Very good! if you don't like salt don't use the garlic salt, just use regular garlic powder. I do not like to cook much, but it was very easy.
