Awesome pizza! We love anything with pesto! and hate arugula ;)! Sooo I substituted spinach in it's place...caramelized some onions and then added the spinach and the steamed broccoli. Next time we'll add a lot more spinach because it pretty much disapeared once it wilted. For the pesto, I used Easy Pesto recipe from allrecipes :)

Great pizza recipe!! I made a few changes- I used a pre made pizza dough and added garlic salt, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, crumbled bacon and mozzarella cheese on top. Cooked it at 375 for 28 minutes. It was amazing and my boyfriend loved it too. I will definitely make this again.

This was good!  I had a bag of mixed lettuce, so I used arugula, spinach and some swiss chard.  Loved the pesto in place of a sauce.  Very fun pizza :)

The flavor was good- crust stuck to the pan even after I used olive oil :(
