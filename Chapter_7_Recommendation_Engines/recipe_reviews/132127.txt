O.K.  I changed a few ingredients in this recipe....but other than that this was AMAZING!!!  I doubled the cheese to 4 cups of mozzarella and used 4 fresh tomatoes from my garden rather than canned.    I also used half olive oil and half water with a handful of torn basil to be more like bruschetta.  I then added a TBS of balsamic vinegar reduction. (You could use plain balsamic vinegar)  I used 4 garlic cloves and cut the chicken into wide strips rather than chunks.  I added  some dried parsley and oregano on top of the cheese and I then topped the entire dish with freshly grated parmesan cheese. This recipe turned out soooo good there was not even a crumb of it left!

As written, 4 stars, but with the changes I made I'd give it 5 stars. Used Italian diced tomatoes and added 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar and a dash of red pepper flakes to them before adding the stuffing. Omitted the salt and tossed the chicken with 1 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar, black pepper, and garlic powder. Instead of just mozzarella, I used mozzarella, swiss and parmesan. With these changes, it was AWESOME! Even the leftovers were great!

I left out the stuffing mix completely. I mixed breading and the Italian seasoning and  breaded the chicken cubes. Baked that for 30 minutes.  I drained the tomatoes, mixed the diced tomatoes with the garlic, sea salt, and a fist full of chopped fresh basil. The last 10 minutes of baking, I topped the chicken with the tomato mix, then sprinkled with the cheese and baked till the cheese was melted.  The kids loved it and went back for seconds.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have tried to date; I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing a few hours to keep it from tasting too bland, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  This recipe is delicious and very easy; I highly recommend it.  FYI: The photo provided doesn't really give this recipe justice...I was going to upload my own photo, but all the leftovers are gone!

I cannot believe that people said this recipe was dry and bland.  We found it to be quite flavorful and very moist.  This was one dish of many that I made on a weekend and popped in the freezer for a future busy work night dinner.  It freezes beautifully.  You could spice it up with red pepper flakes or green chiles if you desire.  But we loved it just the way it was written.  Excellent!

This was very well received at my house. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was excellent. I wouldn't change anything, but I was thinking that another way you could take this is to use Mexican spices, cumin and adobo...use Rotel...then use cornbread dressing and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Just a thought.....

This recipe was very quick, cheap and easy!  Perfect for a family on a budget and/or a person rushing to get dinner on the table.  Preparation was quick and easy, and the cook time was perfect!  I preseasoned my chicken in Mrs. Dash's Garlic and Herb seasoning, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper before putting the cheese over.  It made the chicken very flavorful and added to the overall taste of the dish.  Besides seasoning the chicken, I wouldn't change a thing!  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing, Heather!

Fantastic recipe!  I made a couple of modifications and used what I had on hand and a slow cooker due to time.  Instead of bread stuffing mix I used my own cubed whole wheat bread and mixed this with 2 cans of italian seasoned diced tomatoes and romano cheese. I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning then cut into cubes and lightly breaded with whole wheat bread crumbs and grated romano cheese. I added the chicken to the bottom of a slow cooker and topped with the tomato mixture.  Cooked on low for 8 hours then topped with romano cheese before serving. Froze leftovers

I haven't tried this yet, but giving it a 5 star for perseverance of the person posting. I read probably 20 reviews on this recipe and found that only 1 was actually a review of THIS RECIPE. All others were reviews on what they made. How can you review something and give it stars if you haven't even made it.  I punched in the ingredients I had on hand to find a recipe. After reading the 'reviews' (I say that loosely) I would have to have gone to the store 5 times over. Please review the recipes as written.

This dish was very easy and delicious. I was a bit concerned that the raw chicken wouldn't cook properly in just 30 minutes, covered in cheese and breadcrumbs as it was, so I precooked the chicken chunks. I think the cheese was a tad bland, so next time, I will add some grated parmesan to the shredded mozzarella. But, for a very fast meal, this was excellent!

As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a good idea that could use some tweaking.  My stuffing came out all soggy, and I thought the whole thing was a little too salty.

After reading some reviews, I opted to omit the salt and tossed the chicken in Italian seasoning, onion and garlic powder and crushed red and black pepper.  I topped the chicken with a blend of  shredded sharp cheddar, provolone, mozzarella and parm cheeses.  I mixed reduced sodium stuffing with one can of fire roasted tomatoes w/ basil and a handful of fresh basil and layered it on top. I also used HALF WATER AND HALF EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.  Lastly, I topped the dish with another sprinkle of Italian seasoning and parm.  I baked for an extra ten minutes bc the internal temp did not quite reach the recommended temperature of 160 degrees (f).  Easy and delish.  Family stopped by unexpectedly and there was plenty left...so she ate and absolutely raved  about it.  With a few modifications, this can certainly be a 5-star dish!

This was tasty but I did modify it per other reviews.  No salt and I used thin cut chicken breasts (whole)  I seasoned the breasts with basil, oregano, pepper and garlic powder.  I used diced tomatoes w/basil, oregano & garlic.  Last 5 min of baking I topped with cheese until it melted.  Fabulous FLAVOR!!!

Tried this as a kind of desperation dinner, and followed the recipe to a "T".  It had a good flavor, but I think Italian style tomatoes and another garlic clove would make it better.  Also, even though the chicken was done after 30 minutes, the topping was a little soggy.  Next time, I think I will bake it a few more minutes for more crunch.

I've made this dozens of  times now and we really like it. It  has become part of our regular rotation. It's delicous as written but I like to add 1/2 onion, double the garlic and add a tbsp balsamic to the tomato sauce. I also stir in one tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp balsamic with the chicken. Nice family dinner with or without the changes. Thanks!  I do not add salt. And I toss stuffing in just before I spread on chicken. Otherwise it's soggy. It seems to me calorie count is off.
...personal use...used 175 gm cheese and cal count is 412

This recipe is SO good! I made it last night for my family and there were no leftovers! I did tweak it a little though. I sliced the chicken into strips and then cut in half so that they are about 3" long. Then I cooked the chicken in a pan over the stove (I added a little bit of olive oil to the pan). I added Mrs. Dash seasoning and pepper to taste (I did not add ANY salt to the recipe at all as I thought it would already be salty from the stuffing...I was right). After putting on the cheese and Italian seasoning I also added Oregano and Basil (Honestly, I just covered it with seasoning as I love it...so no measurements were taken). I used a box of whole wheat chicken flavored stuffing (5oz) then added a drizzle of olive oil in the stuffing mix, 3/4 medium red onion, a TBS of Balsamic vinaigrette, and 3 fresh tomatoes instead of the canned (tin-canned tomatos aren't good for you as the acid makes BPA enter food more quickly and tin cans have that toxic chemical in them). I baked and then 15 minutes before it was done, I topped it with fresh Parmesan cheese along with grated Parmesan cheese. The only thing I might change or add next time is doing one less tomato and replace it with sun-dried tomatoes. Seriously, this was SO DELICIOUS....my new signature dish.

As my husband will confirm, I rarely follow a recipe to the tee, and this was no different. I mixed the chicken stuffing mix with tomato pesto and canned diced tomatoes (I drained the juice) I then layered cooked penne pasta /stuffing mixture/grated mozzarella/with whole skinless chicken thighs, followed by more breading and cheese. It was very easy and my family really liked it. I am sure I will make it again.

This was delicious.  I used Italian seasoning on my chicken instead of salt.  The only thing I added was chopped baby bellas to the stuffing mix.  My one mistake was I forgot the layer of cheese!  I added it to the top of the dish and it was fine.  I will make this one again.

I was hoping this would be better than it was.  I followed this recipe pretty closely.  In addition to the salt and pepper, I seasoned the chicken with a little of the Italian seasoning.  I used tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic, and added some fresh basil.  The flavor was good, but my biggest objection to this recipe was the stuffing mixture was pretty mushy, with the exception of the very top, which had a little crispness to it.  I baked mine for 40 minutes at 375 because I had made it ahead and refrigerated it.  I thought at 400 degrees, the top might burn before the chicken was done.

I thought this was good, but everyone else thought it was wonderful!  
This is now THE dish I make to bring to others (with new babies, illness, etc), and I am always asked for the recipe.  I had so many wives calling me to tell me their husband insisted they get the recipe, that I now include the recipe with the dish.

This was really good, but not outstanding. I followed the recipe to the letter the first time & it was good.  I made it again with the following modifications and they really put it over the top! Fillet the Chicken breast or cube it, then let it marinate in some low-fat Italian salad dressing. I also doubles the water that was added into the stuffing. (My first stuffing was a bit crunchy.) Lastly, I used a cheese mix of Parm & Mozz. Serve this with a crisp tomatoed salad & you are set!!

I had wanted to try this chicken dish for some time.  I finally made it, but with a couple of changes.  I used tomatoes from our garden rather than canned.  I cut the tomatoes in the morning and added the salt and the garlic and let them meld all day and create its own juice.  I didn't have a box of stuffing mix, so I made my own using another AR recipe 'Basic Bread Stuffing'.  The final result was a great tasting dish, with the flavor of the fresh tomatoes really coming through.  The leftovers were very good, if we reheated in the toaster oven.  Thanks Heather for sharing your recipe.

Holy comfort food! Delicious. I made a few alterations, like everyone else it seems. I put a couple table spoons of balsamic vinegar in with the stuffing. Also used a few different types of cheese, doubling the original amount specified. Added chopped jalapenos in with the tomato. Perfect all together. Will definitely make this often!

This was tasty, everyone loved it, fast, easy. I used pre-cooked chicken strips, added 1 pack of frozen spinach to chicken layer and topped with sauteed mushrooms and parmesan. Thanks for a great recipe. It was voted a keeper!

This recipe was very tasty. I didn't use a can of diced tomatoes. I marinated the chicken. Then I made my own bruschetta mixture with fresh tomatoes, basil leaves, olive oil, water, garlic, and balsamic vinegar. I let the bruschetta chill in the fridge for a few hours, then I mixed it with the stuffing. I put the marinated chicken on the bottom of the pan, added mixed shredded cheeses i/l/o just mozz, added italian seasoning on top of the cheese, then put the stuffing mixture on top of everything. YUM YUM

It was OKAY. Stuffing was too dry even with the can of tomato.. overall taste was good, just a bit hard to swallow! Next time I will add more tomatoes to give it a bit more flavor and make stuffing moist. Good recipe though!

This was fast and easy, and the whole family enjoyed it.  I only used about half as much cheese, as that was all we had left.  Great stuff.

Read the reviews before making and doubled the tomatoes and cheese as well as adding basil to the mix...it was fantastic but definitely needed the changes!  Otherwise would have been 5 stars.  Served over a little pasta with some bread and salad...excellent!

this was very easy and has a great flavor however I made some changes. I have a child with milk allergy's so I added a little cheese on the chicken  but put most of it on top of half...next time I would switch that put half the cheese over half the chicken and add a little on top to show which side has cheese. I also marinaded the chicken in Italian dressing and I used double the meat in tender form, didn't cube... I also doubled the topping but then realized that I still used a 9x13 pan. It was too much, so next time I won't double the topping just the meat.most of my family loved it and I had it ready for the oven in 10 min.  yea !!

This is something quick that I would make again. Added some balsamic vinegar and used panko instead of the stuffing mix since that's what I had.

At first, we were skeptical of raw chicken cooked for only thirty minutes, but it turned out we were wrong! This was a great find, although I would agree with others in that it was a bit too salty. Also, the cheese was quite bland, so in addition to what is already called for, I would add some three cheese blend in. Thanks! :]

As a comfort food and casserole, this recipe is five star. I am dumbfounded in reading those reviews that didn't like it. Granted, I made some slight modifications, but the basics of this recipe easily allow for that: 1) I used the kind of cheese I had on hand, Swiss. Six slices were enough to cover all of the chicken; I also used four slices of American cheese overlayed with the Swiss, and 2) Instead of regular canned tomatoes, I used one 10.5 ounce can of Original Ro*tel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies (with some leftover fresh diced tomatoes added, fill the empty Ro*Tel can up almost 1/2 way for correct volume), 3) added some (1 teaspoon, or so) Italian seasoning to the tomato mixture.

This recipe has a beautiful appearance and with Ro-tel tomatoes/chilies adds just enough of a kick to make the dish almost downright exciting.

This is really good - with a couple minor changes. I omit the salt and use 2 cloves of garlic, rather than a teaspoon. I also brown the chicken prior to putting it in the 9x13 and only use 1 cup of cheese. Oh, and I don't bother to grease the pan - it doesn't seem to stick in my glass dish. This looks fancy enough for company and is SUPER easy. My husband (who can't stand tomatoes, except in ketchup and spaghetti sauce) raved about it and said I need to add it to my regular rotation.

I originally saw this recipe on the side of a Stove Top canister and thought it sounded good.  Unfortunately none of the flavors blend together, it ends up tasting like chicken, stuffing mix, and canned tomatoes.  Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe; it's not a hit.

This was a tasty, easy recipe.  As the previous person stated, I was concerned that the raw chicken would not cook to my satisfaction, so I boiled the chicken first and then I poured some of the chick broth over the entire dish to make it moist.  If you do this, I suggest that you reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes.  This was delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

This is similar to a recipe Kraft puts out...and while it's easy, I find it to be just OK in taste.  The stuffing flavor really overpowers this dish...so you better like that!  Only thing I did differently was to marinate the chicken in Italian dressing all day prior to throwing this together.

Delicious!  This recipe was very quick and easy.  I would not salt the chicken next time.  The stuffing had plenty of salt for the dish.  I would definately make it again only I would have to double the recipe!!

Wow!! This was amazing! The only thing I did different was to use one and a half 10 oz. cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies to heat it up a little instead of the diced tomatoes. Thanks for the amazing recipe! I loved it!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!! I followed many of the suggestions- my cooking is never an exact science, so what I can say is I marinated chix strips in a balsamic vinaigrette dressing for a few hours, threw in greased 9x13 dish; mixed up the stuffing- added extra stuffing (I bought stuffing in a bag- used approx 8-10oz), extra diced tomatoes, extra olive oil and a little bit of water, lots of dried basil, fresh diced garlic; let that soak. sprinkled parm. cheese on chix, moz. cheese, then stuffing mixture, topped with more parm. cheese and mozzarella- YUMMO!

My daughter loved this. Simple ingredients and a snap to throw together on a weeknight.  I added extra garlic and some sauted mushrooms...delicious!

I coated the chicken in 1 tbs balsamic and 1 tsp garlic. Also added balsamic to the stuffing - enjoyed the leftovers and will make again!

This was fabulous! I can't give it 5 stars since I didn't have stuffing and followed more of the directions on the 3rd comment. But it will go into the rotation!

Although the stuffing turned out soggy, which was my fault, I loved the taste and how easy it was to make. I didn't cube the chicken because that didn't sound really good to me so I stripped it instead and put it in the oven alone first. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

We took the suggestion and made it in a crock pot... mm mm good!  The meat was tender and the brushetta added a kick.  I used a bit of basalmic vinegar, some fresh basil, and topped it off with Parmesan cheese.  Next time we might eat it over spaghetti.  Great all-around recipe!

Excellent casserole.  I followed the recipe as directed but instead of ordinary diced tomatoes, I added italian diced tomatoes and a container of President's Choice Bruschetta cheese mix (available in Canada).  My daughter who dislikes tomatoes ate all the tomatoes in this recipe.  A big hit!

YUM!!!  This is so quick & easy - great for a busy mom.  I also added a few dashes of balsamic vinegar to the bread mixture (which was 1/2 day-old crusty rolls cut up into squares because I didn't have enough stuffing).  I also sprinkled some Parmesan on top of the mozzarella.  Will definitely make this again!

For some reason I found this to be so much more delicious as a leftover than fresh out of the oven.  I think next time I make this I will just wait a day before eating it.  Also added some zucchini, which made it pretty darn tasty, I think.

Very tasty!! You can't get much easier than this one too. It was put together in no time at all.  My family loved it. I did use one can of the fire roasted tomatoes and one can of stewed tomatoes with the juices. I didn't need to add any more liquid.  It was yummy with a good salad, and french bread!

I thought this was good. I left the chicken breasts whole and I poured a little italian dressing over the chicken, topped that with the stuffing, and put the cheese on top. The chicken was nice and moist and we all really liked it. Another fast and easy meal...gotta love that :)

My hubby loved this! I only liked it but I'm also not a huge stuffing fan. I only tweaked this a bit. I cooked my chicken for a bit 1st...just in olive oil with garlic salt and pepper. I think it gave it a lil more flavor and helped it cook faster. I also cooked it for about 15 mins without the cheese then added it the last 10. It made the stuffing less soggy. It was VERY easy and very fast. Not many ingredients either and very cheap per serving!

Sorry, but I can only rate this recipe 3 stars as written.  I do feel it has the potential to be much, much, more.  First of all I did partially cook the cubed chicken and am very glad I did.  I do not feel it would have been cooked in the stated time if not.  So, I cooked the meat in a little extra virgin olive oil and seasoned with garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I did not add salt based on other reviews and am certainly glad I didn't.  This dish is quite salty on its own.  The stuffing mixture was spread on top of the chicken,sprinkled with the Italian seasoning, followed by a combination of both mozzeralla and parmesan cheeses. Next time I will use a combo of basil, oregano,and parsley rather than the seasoning mix.

Great easy dinner!
I used Low Sodium Stuffing mix to cut the saltiness and I added a few tablespoons of Balsamic Vinegar to add extra flavor.

i had seen this recipe in a magazine and later found it on a box of stuffing. the first time i tried it, i added too much water! oops! it turned out so mushy but we managed to eat about half the dish. i've been scared to try it again, but i'm sure if you follow the recipe it'd be good! i wouldn't use chicken stuffing though, just herb.

It was decent.  I used chicken strips instead of chunking up chicken breasts.  I sprinkled the chicken with the Italian seasoning along with garlic and onion powder.  Baked at for 40 minute and they were perfect.  Low on fat, full on flavor, nice weeknight dish with lots for leftovers.  Thanks

Quick and tasty. My partner loved it. For a next time, I will not add salt since the stuffing provides enough.

I tweeked this abit. First, no salt when cooking the chicken. I actually cooked it in a bit of reduced sodium chicken broth to keep it moist. And instead of boxed stuffing, I made my own with toasted chunks of tuscan bread and poured a mixture of celery and onions cooked in the remaining chicken broth, sage, garlic powder, s&p, oregano, basil and a little chicken soup base over top just to make it moist. Then, I drained half of the liquid out of the tomatoes, and mixed them with the stuffing. I didn't have any mozzerella to use, so I used a little dusting of parmasan. Absolutely fabulous. Even reheated!

Loved this recipe! So easy to make. I used whole wheat stuffing mix and no one noticed. I only used 1 cup of cheese to cut some of the fat. Will make again.

We make this recipe all the time. The only change I've made is to omit the extra salt. so far nothing has gone wrong with it and it makes great leftovers.

I thought this dish was very dry and bland in taste!  Not sure that more tomatoes or less stuffing would help it much.  Will not make it again.

Very easy to make and was received well by company. Instead of using shredded cheese, I used fresh, pearl mozzarella which added a better flavor.

I substituted store-bought bruschetta in place of chopped tomatoes to make the recipe a bit quicker and it still came out amazing. I was looking for a very quick, tasty meal to throw together after work and this was the perfect find!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, found it to be too watery and tasted processed. I also found when I bought the box of Kraft Chicken chicken stuffing box it is the recipe on the box. Overall I felt all you can really taste is the stuffing.. The concept is good but next time I would use all real tomatoes real basil and regular broken up bread without any seasoning and add my own.

Made it exactly as written., except used a cast iron skillet instead of glass backing dish and cooked for twenty minutes to adjust for the better heat conductiveiy.  Used an instant temp thermometer bo be sure it was done. The stuffing part tasted "OK" and I might try tweaking it into "Mexican" with diced.tomatoes with chilies and cornbread stuffing, but not sure if there will be a "next time"..  I would definitely substitute chicken THIGHs next time, if there is one,because the chicken breasts were much too dry.  Recipe has some potential but not as written, sorry.

Easy, inexpensive and super tasty.  5 stars as written, I tweaked things to suit my needs and am only writing to reference later.  I used rotisserie chicken sprinkled with Italian seasoning, got the water to 1/2 cup by using some olive oil to top it off, used diced tomatoes that already had garlic mixed in and did 15 min at 475 and then broiled on high to get it super crispy.

One of the first things I made my husband actually liked!  Tweaked it a little after reading the reviews.  I skipped the salt and the added water because a number of people mentioned sogginess.  I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinigrette for a few hours and cooked it on the stove first.  I also added Pecorino Romano to the cheese mix and used 3 cloves of garlic.  Very flavorful and easy to throw together.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is very easy, but I did make some adjustments to it.  I  cubed the chicken and marinated in a Caesar dressing overnight.  I used Mexican cheese and mozzarella cheese to put on top of the chicken.  I used 1 can of Rotel and I added sautéed onions, peppers and garlic to the stuffing mix.  I did not have chicken stuffing so I used turkey stuffing mix and it turned out great. I also topped the stuffing mix with fresh parsley.   The kids and I loved it!   Thank you!

This is a good start-I changed some things and added some things. I used basil olive oil instead of cooking spray. I sprinkled the chicken w pepper, chile and cayenne powder for a kick.  Replaced stuffing w Italian bread crumbs and added onion and garlic to the tomatoes. I would have used less water. Overall, very tasty and easy to make!

I have made this a couple of times now, and it was good, but it turned out very watery/soupy for me when I followed the directions.  So after the first time of following the directions, I changed it up a bit to suit my family.  I mix 4 cut up chicken breasts with a can of diced tomatoes (with garlic and olive oil), along with the additional minced garlic and some salt and pepper.  I then put that mixture into my 3 qt casserole dish and baked it in the oven for 20 minutes.  While that mixture was baking I prepared the stuffing on its own separately.  After the 20 minutes of baking, I spooned out the excess liquid from the dish.  I then sprinkled on a little dried basil, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese, and then topped with the prepared stuffing mixture.  I then put the casserole dish back in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.  My family of 4 much preferred it this way, as the casserole was not watery, but still moist.

This was very good!  For those of you who said it was bland, try canned diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano.  I also saute'd some mushrooms with the garlic and some Italian seasoning, then using the same pan saute'd my chicken pieces for a few minutes to ensure they were cooked through.  I also used an Italian Blend shredded cheese.  This had very good flavor and I will make again.

This recipe was a hit with my family and my company.  I stuck to the original recipe pretty much just used packaged whole wheat stuffing cubes and sprinkled some balsamic vinegar on top of the stuffing layer.  I decreased the salt for health reasons.  It was fantastic and there were absolutely no leftovers!

Made this tonight husband loved it. I did change just a few things as others have done. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half. I first marinated the chicken in Italian Dressing for 30 min did not use any salt, I also used Fire Roasted diced tomatoes which gave it amazing flavor.  Topped with extra Mozzerella Cheese.  Although I followed directions for everything else it took the chicken 55-60 min at 400 to reach internal temp of 160.

This was so easy and simple to make. I made it just as the recipe called for. I did use diced fire roasted tomato's and tomato's with green chilies instead of just diced tomato's. I also topped mine with cheese after it was done baking. It's so good and my family loves it.

I love this recipe.I have made it as is, and I've tweaked it too. Used different Italian cheese, extra garlic, made my own stuffing, thrown in some spinach, extra spices, etc. Depends what I have on hand. It is an easy all in one dish! I'll serve it with an extra side of veggies. Love it.

Followed recipe AS IS. With modifications, this could have been a 3 star recipe. Chicken was BLAND! Stuffing was very soggy. When I served the casserole, there was a puddle of liquid under the chicken. Not sure what was up with that. Overall, it was flavorless and not what I expected.

Great recipe!!  So easy that my 10-year old son now loves to make it all by himself for the family!  We used chicken broth instead of water and cut the cheese amount in half only because my son needs to minimize how much cheese he eats.  But, really, the recipe is perfect the way is is!

This is very good and quick.  Have made it several times as is, except for leaving out the salt and less of the Italian Seasoning.  This time I forgot I needed mozzarella cheese, so I used slices of Havarti, that I lay on top of the cubed chicken.  Used basil instead of Italian Seasoning.  Sprinkled Parmesan cheese, liberally over the topping.  It was not bland and the chicken was perfectly cooked, at 400° with convection.

Only made a couple changes after reading other reviews. Added some red pepper flakes and more garlic to stuffing mixture. Also did not salt the chicken but did marinate it in the italian dressing. My kids hated this (very picky eaters) but I liked it. The left overs where great too. Nice change up from the norm, and very easy to put together. Will keep it in mind for another night, this time when my husbands home.

This was almost too powerfully flavored. I also didn't understand how it was a meal. It said to put it in a 9x13, but that was WAYY too big for the amount of food I put into the dish, then when it cooked it all stuck to the bottom of the pan because there wasn't enough food in the pan. Maybe making this in a smaller dish would have helped. But I didn't care for the flavor so I probably won't be making it again.

Mixed reviews here. Boyfriend liked it. I wasn't a fan. I added red wine, crushed red pepper, and balsamic vinegar for more flavor as suggested by reviewers. The flavors of the stuffing mix didn't blend well with the canned tomatoes. To me it almost tasted like they were just heated up and thrown together. I am glad I tried it since the BF liked it.  I won't be making this again. I wonder if fresh diced tomatoes with chicken broth would improve this dish.

This is an awesome meal.
But I did made some alterations... For the stuffing mixture I used 3 garlic cloves, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup chicken broth, cut up half a tomato in addition to the can of diced tomato (I used italian style tomatoes) and drizzled in a little olive oil. I sprinkled parsley and oregano over the chicken and then again over the mozzarella cheese and sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese over the bread crumb mixture.
Delicious!

I made a lot of changes. I rubbed the chicken in poultry seasoning and let it sit in Kraft basil & olive oil salad dressing while I prepped the rest.  I put fresh torn up basil & oregeno in w/ the tomatoes and set aside.  I cut up onions, mushrooms, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts (the plain kind), red pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic.  Some people said that their stuffing got mushy, so since my prep work took longer than what the original recipe calls for, I waited until I was done cutting everything to add the tomatoes & liquid to the stuffing.  Then, instead of water, I added just a drizzle of each of the following: olive oil, balsamic vinegar, chicken stock, and marsala wine.  Then added the garlic cloves and mixed it all together.  I browned the chicken, cut it up and layered the bottom of the baking dish.  I then cooked the mushrooms & onions just a little and spread them in an even layer over the chicken and cheese, then added the olives, artichokes, and red peppers in an even layer over that.  Then added the stuffing mix.  It was VERY flavorful. The olives & peppers I used were from the antipasto bar at Giant Eagle, so the olive oil juices they'd been in seeped into the chicken keeping it VERY moist.  The stuffing made a great topping-key is not to use that much liquid.  It doesn't need it. Thanks for the idea!

I liked the concept but changed it up due to salt content. Cubed my chicken and marinated in Italian dressing,layered with cheese and used a plain stuffing and basil garlic diced canned tomatoes.

Im not too much of a fan of damp bread and thats exactly what this dish tasted like. It was ok but i wasnt able to finish it. It was way to soft and wet bread like...but i did strip the chciken instead of into bitesize pieces which I though was great. But i wont make this dish again.

Delicious!!!!! Defnitely will be making this dish again. My husband and I both loved it. I read reviews before cooking and decided to marinate the cubed chicken overnight in a caribbean jerk sauce which gave it a good kick and excellent flavor. It was a moist dinner that was crunchy on the top and I also added most cheese on the top layer and just a little on the chicken directly. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!

I loved it with the balsamic vinegar.  I used wheat bread stuffing mix, however.  Next time, I will use regular.

Very tasty.

Excellent!  Super delicious!  My husband moaned with every bite and the kids ate it too without complaint.  I took the advice of a few other reviewers....used a bit of olive oil, garlic powder and italian seasoning for the chicken, used a bit of olive oil mixed in with the water for the stuffing, and lots of cheese.  It was super easy and so delicious!  A Keeper for sure!  Next time I may use low-fat cheese to keep the calories down.  Thanks a bunch for sharing this easy weeknight dinner recipe!

LOOOVED this recipe!  I just made it tonight for the first time and it turned out FANTASTIC!  My boy friend and his buddy couldn't stop raving about the meal...four hours later and my boyfriend is still complementing me!  I did take the advise from a few other reviews.  I used 2/3 can of diced tomatoes, used garlic and herb seasoning for chicken and throughout stuffing mixture, used half the amount of water asked, used about two tlbs spoons of olive oil and lastly used a package of cheese that was a mix of six cheese's (you can find at any grocery store).  Loved every second of every bite and also made linguine for a side dish with separate tomato sauce.  Thank you for a WONDERFUL meal!  My boyfriend and I actually argued over who was gonna eat the last bit of leftovers!!!  AND THATS A FIRST!  Thank you soooo much..will become a regular meal in this house!!:):)

This is a staple at our house.  The only thing I do differently is add a little olive oil and pepper to the chicken.  It's always a hit.  And it's good for groups.

I wish I could give three and a half stars for this. The flavor was very nice, but the bread topping got quite soggy, not a texture that anyone in my family is a fan of. I might consider trying this again with homemade crusty bread croutons that wouldn't get so soggy (cut into larger chunks) and putting less liquid in from the tomatoes. This recipe has potential, but as written it was not for us.

Awesome!!!! I made 2 versions- one exactly as is, one with pesto added to the top layer, per my hubby's request. Let me say the original version is FANTASTIC. So easy to make, so quick, sooooo delicious. Adding the pesto did not make it better or worse, as it didn't really need it. The one with the pesto was just as yummy, with a slightly different flavor. Both are excellent, but there's no need to add the pesto unless you want to.  *I did omit the salt & used 1/2 TBSP garlic powder , those were really my only changes. My hubby went back for seconds & my 5 year old ate it with gusto. This one is a keeper!!

My entire family loved this.  It's not generally easy to make quick recipes that my picky husband and even pickier toddlers enjoy but they gobbled this one up.  The return on the prep investment was ridiculously high.  Definitely will make again.  Served with milk since it was a tad bit briney.  The milk balanced out the flavors very nicely.

Very good dish! I followed pretty closely but took into consideration some of the previous reviews. I cooked my chicken with the garlic and some balsamic vinegar and made this the bottom layer. The stuffing was perfect as instructed but became my middle layer. Sprinkled the Italian seasoning on top of the stuffing in addition to cutting up some fresh basil. Cheese went on top before baking. Yummy, fast and easy! Thank you!

Good and easy! Only change I would make would be to add pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan before adding chicken.

I was craving Bruschetta so I decided to give this a try, I followed the recipe exactly. I would of given it one star but my husband did like this with some tapatio hot sauce. I won't be making this again.

Ahhhmazing.  My family loves this meal.  It's super easy and comes out just delicious!   I am a hug fan of this recipe.  Although it's great without changing a thing, it can also be customized for just about any taste.  When I make it for my husband I use spicy diced tomatoes and when I make it for my mom, I use less cheese, no salt and dice fresh tomatoes.  Always a pleaser in my kitchen!

This was delicious and SO easy.  It turned out a tad bit too salty for my taste, so I'll use less salt next time and maybe slightly less garlic.  A full tablespoon of minced garlic can be a bit much, but then the diced tomatoes I used had garlic in them, too (I used the Italian canned tomatoes with garlic, basil and Oregano).  Otherwise, very good and simple recipe.  My husband loved it.

My husband and I loved this dish. I made it exactly as written  and found it to be easy and tasty.  I'll be making it several times.
Added note:  When my daughter came by, I gave her some to take home.  She called the next day asking if I had any more.  She loved it.

Loved it!  Okay, I really was going to stick to the orginal recipe, but had to deviate a bit.  First, I didn't use canned tomatoes & instead just chopped up 2 large ones.  Next, all I had was unflavored stuffing, so used that and added in just a whole can of chicken broth to it.  Since my stuffing was unseasoned I did use an extra TBS of Italian seasoning that I mixed in with that, the tomatoes and 5 cloves of garlic (hey, I love the stuff).  Following other reviews I omitted the salt entirely and instead chose to add in some fresh ground black pepper.  After exactly 30 minutes dinner was ready and soooooo good.  This is a great, inexpensive meal that I will totally make again.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

the kids really enjoyed this.  I found the stuffing too mushy and a little bland.  i think ill leave out the water next time and add extra seasonings.  Maybe use some feta as well.

This recipe was excellent!!  I made it exactly the way the directions said and it was really good.  My husband said it tasted like chicken parmesan (but it's so much easier to make!)  Next time I'll make sure to spray the sides of the pan more.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good! Super easy! I used garlic salt on the chicken instead of regular salt and at another's suggestion added parmesan to the very top. It went nicely with a caesar salad. Will definitely make again.

This recipe has faults, but can be fixed. First, leave out the SALT!! The water should be omitted in the stuffing mix, or it will be slimy. I use low sodium stuffing as well. I prefer fresh basil, but dry is good too (1-2 tsp). The balsamic vinegar idea of another reviewer is a good one - I will try that next.

nice and easy-very tasty. Add a little extra garlic and marinate the chicken. I just used thin chicken breasts-didn't bother cutting them up.

I really hate to give anything but 4 or 5's in my reviews.  However, this was just not very good IMO.  We love all the ingredients, but together they just didn't mesh for us.  It was very dry and the chicken rather bland.  Sorry :(

Very tasty! Hubby loved it! The only thing I did was the tomatoes were an "italian blend" and I omitted the salt.  When I layered the chicken, I also sprinkled 1 tsp. dried basil leaves on top before the cheese and stuffing layers.  I will definitely add this to our normal rotation of chicken meals!  Easy and quick!

My S/O made this with a couple of changes - instead of water, he used chicken stock, and he added extra tomatoes and stuffing. It was great! Very flavorful and the chicken was moist. We'll do this again, but probably for a larger party than just the 2 of us!

Very good recipe. I used 4 tomatoes from the garden and added 1 tbl balsamic vin. I marinated the chicken cubes in Italian dressing for 1 hour before draining and adding to the casserole. I highly recommend this one!

This is an easy, simple and tasty meal. Try mixing up this recipe with different combinations of canned flavored diced tomatoes. Using a variety of flavored croutons can jazz it up some too.  A wonderful flavor combination is Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic and Oregano; kiss the cook who came up with this in a can), with cheese garlic croutons.

This recipe is quick, easy and delish!  The whole family loves it.  We make it easier by just buying the "italian diced tomatoes" in a can and then season to taste from there.

Well, I messed up the directions and this still came out great!  I mistakenly put the cheese on top - I had to cover the dish so it wouldn't burn while baking.  I used a can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes so I didn't have to add extra garlic or seasoning.  I was glad not to have to cook the chicken before baking!  This recipe is a keeper.

Sounded good, looked good, didn't taste good.  It tasted like dry stuffing.

Maybe a little heavy on the Italian seasoning, but otherwise excellent.  Next time I think I would cut down a little on the Italian seasoning, and sub some basil. Really tasty, easy to prepare, and quick.

Very, very easy to make and everyone was a fan. I used a slightly bigger box of stuffing, and my chicken was still a bit frozen when I put it in the oven, and it still finished yummy in 30 minutes. I will make again.

Five stars with some tweaking.  It was AMAZING... hubby and teen loved !

Followed suggestions of others:  omitted seasoning chicken with salt.  Used combo of garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning and seasoned pepper from Penzies and crushed red pepper.  Eyeballed all seasonings...if you like things milder go easy on the red pepper, but can’t imagine not using at least some unless there are very sensitive taste buds.
Used around 12 oz of mozzarella.

No water at all - used only olive oil - eyeballed it - probably about 1/4 cup maybe.  Drained the diced tomatoes too.
Poured a bit of olive oil on top - just a bit.

Wasn’t soggy at all!
Very very easy!!!  Great for a weeknight meal and imagine it would be a hit at pot licks too.  Enjoy!

I made changes according to other reviews,  i.e. Left out added salt, used half olive oil half water, doubled mozz cheese, marinated leftover rotisserie chicken in Italian dressing and added fresh basil and dried oregano.  Dish was flavorful with herbs, however the end result was too dry and too much breadiness overall for the casserole.

Pretty easy meal! Instead of
mozerella I used Cabot seriously sharp cheddar. I didn't use the 1/2 cup of water. This easily fed four seniors tonight! We had one serving left over for someone's lunch tomorrow. Super easy & so easily adjustable with a little imagination!

We were not a fan of this recipe. I bought low-sodium chicken flavored stuffing because of the salt complaints in the reviews. —- found this recipe on the back! Well that explains it. I added some extra seasoning like some reviewers did, but it could not cover up the taste of the stuffing! Tastes super processed. My husband said It tasted like Stovetop - which it is. Terrible. We ate it but threw out the rest. Do not recommend. OFF THE BCK OF THE BOX! UGH.

I make this often. I omit the added salt as there’s plenty in the ingredients.  I also double the cheese, use the diced tomatoes with the added Italian seasoning and marinate the chicken in Italian dressing as it’s a bit bland with out the marinade.

One of the easiest recipes to make, as it cooks, the smell engulfs your house on a cloud of garlic scent that keeps the mouth watering.

The final product is absolutely delicious, even my 8 years old said it was good!

Super simple, and a big hit.  Would be good to use use roast chicken or turkey leftovers.  However as it is , it was great.  I added some spices (greek seasoning, minced onion, and a bit more garlic).

Marinate chicken in Italian dressing.
Cut into strips than cubes.
Italian tomatoes, not plain.
1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup olive oil vs water
4 cups mozzarella or mixture of Italian cheese
2 cubes frozen garlic
Omit extra salt as stuffing mix is salty as is Italian dressing.

Yummy and juicy!  I took some of the reviewers’ advice and added a bit of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and Italian seasoning to the chicken. Otherwise made as described.  Will definitely make again.  So easy!

So super yummy!! I made it with 3 cans of shredded chicken instead of cubes but everything else was to a T. Not sure why people are saying it’s bland, I thought it was perfectly flavorful! I may try rotel with chili’s instead of just the diced tomatoes next time, just to add a bit of a kick?

This was quick, easy, and very flavorful. I didn't have Italian Seasoning so I just used oregano and thyme. Would have loved to sprinkle fresh basil on top but since I didn't have any, I'll do it next time.

I have made this twice now and really love it. I added Balsamic as others did, I just sprinkled it on the chicken, used canned tomatoes with peppers for spice, and put a little cheese on top, other than that, followed the recipe. This couldn’t be easier to make, and good flavor. If you’re looking for something fast and easy, this is it. I cooked some green beans and had a complete meal

This gets major points from me for being super easy and quite flavorful, but it was somehow kinda watery at the bottom. I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing, which helped give the dish more flavor. I didn’t notice the cheese in there since the other flavors overpowered it. I used diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic in a can, and it worked well in there. The recipe is basically the same as the one on the back of the Stove Top stuffing mix box.

We made it as is.  My wife loved it I was ok with it. I felt it needed something my wife however thought it was fine just the way it was.  Also my two boys enjoyed it and thought it was good.  So 3 outta 4 gives it a 4

Very yummy. And super easy. I used cubed chicken thighs and leftover stuffing mix from Thanksgiving Dinner. I also drizzled balsamic vinegar before serving. So easy and delicious. The only thing I would change is to broil it for a couple of minutes just before serving. I served steamed green beans on the side.

This was really easy to make.  It was a hit with everyone.  I probably used extra cheese but I always do that because I love cheese in a baked dish.  I didn't have Italian seasoning but that didn't seem to make a difference..  I will make it again.

I thought this was really good. However I did omit the salt on the chicken and put onion and garlic powder, crushed red and black pepper on the chicken. I added some fresh tomatoes with a can of Italian tomatoes and next time I make this I would only use fresh tomatoes no canned at all. Also added parmesan to the top the last ten minutes of cooking and added chopped red onion to the tomato mixture. Will make again.

This was a miss for me. No one in my family liked it and even though I didn’t salt the chicken, the dish was still too salty. The whole thing tasted like stuffing with cheese and chicken. I read through the suggested changes and don’t think the substitutions would help that much.

Loved it! Made a couple of changes. Used loaf of "Everything" bread instead of packaged stuffing. Used chicken broth instead of water. Used two cans rather than one of Italian diced tomatos. (I like stuffing soggy before cooking.) used mix of about 3 grated cheeses. It's great and fun to make changes. Husband almost in coma from happiness.    Holly

I added a bit of Parmesan cheese and used Italian diced tomatoes. The stuffing is very overpowering in flavor, so It tastes like a thanksgiving dinner. I would eat it again but not for Italian night, for when I needed a holiday fix without a huge turkey preparation.

Perfect for make ahead.  Kids love it. I used a cooked supermarket chicken,  so it was really fast and easy.  
Due to milk allergies,  a lot of casseroles that use milk are a No,  but I just left off the cheese topping.

A little salty for me but my husband loved it. He went back for seconds. Next time I’ll add extra cheese to top also use crushed tomatoes. I also cooked it 10 minutes longer as my digital thermometer broke & I wanted to be sure chicken was cooked.

This was good and easy! The only thing I did different was toss the chicken in a little olive oil instead of using Pam. I drizzled a little on top but not much at all. I also used the Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and sprinkled a little fresh grated Parmesan on top after plating. It’s definitely going into the dinner rotation! Next time I’ll probably put more chicken in it. I had a very light lunch today and ate half the pan by myself. Lol

Excellent!!! Quick and easy, done in no time. I followed advice of some of the other reviewers and omitted the salt. Marinated chicken with Italian dressing overnight, added garlic powder then the Italian seasoning and the rest of the ingredients. Not salty at all. Will definitely make this again.

I used the diced tomatoes with green chilis which added a nice  flavor. I also used dried multi-grain flatbread instead of bread crumbs.

I made this recipe as written. Only change I made was adding garlic powder to the chicken. It was a little dry for me. I also really hate rosemary, which was especially strong considering the amount of Italian seasoning. I'd add a second can of tomatoes next time, as well as just use basil and oregano instead of the Italian seasoning mix.

Recipe was yummy- only change I would make was to also omit the salt and maybe marinate the chicken in a balsamic marinade.

I’m not quite sure what I did wrong but the breading turned out to be pretty soggy so the texture was totally off. It also took an extra 10 minutes in the oven for the chicken to cook through for me.  The flavors where totally on point though - hence the three stars.

Great recipe. Quick and easy to make.I added more cheese and baked a little longer so it was nice and crispy on top.  The left overs were amazing warmed up in the toaster oven. Would love to try with the balsamic.

Made this for my family just as the recipe calls for. They loved it. I loved it and it literally only took about 50 minutes to an hour to complete. It was a win-win in my house. Next time I make it I may add something extra to the breading mixture.

I used parmesan cheese and just a little mozzarella.  I used Italian style bread crumbs because the box of chicken flavored dry bread stuffing mix all had MSG in the ingredients. I stay away from that stuff. Sliced the chicken like thin filet style. Loved it! I want to make it every week! Amazing! To me 5 stars!

Sorry, but won't be making this again.  It was easy enough, but the taste was all tomatoes & blah.  Did everything as instructed.  You couldn't tell there was cheese in it which was a big downer for me.  I think it would've been better just using chicken, stuffing & chicken gravy as a hot dish.  I was ready to toss in garbage, but hubby & I were raised that you don't waste food.  Now is when I wish we had a dog again.

I only had a 28oz can of tomatoes so I didn’t add water. I also sautéed garlic, onions, peppers and put them over the chicken before I put the cheese. To the cheese I added shredded Parmesan as well as to the top, on top of the stuffing mix. I don’t like soggy bread but I really like this recipe.

This recipe never quite ends up as great as I expect.  I've tried playing around with it  (more spices, more tomato, more cheese ...) and can't quite get it to reach my expectations.  I'll keep trying it, but it's definitely one to read the comments for ideas.

This was VERY easy to make and very good.  Next time, I will put balsamic glaze over the top and finely diced red onion.  Used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and put 2 TBSP balsamic vinegar in the stuffing mixture.  Really tasty.

I wasn't optimistic, but it turned out great.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion to use balsamic and I loved it.  My wife was really reluctant to have any (she's not a big fan of bruschetta) but she went back for seconds.  If that's not an endorsement, what is?

I’m giving this a 4 because my brother really liked it, I thought it was pretty good but didn’t taste a lot like bruschetta because of the sage in the stuffing (I even added some basil to the stuffing mix for more authenticity), and my mother prefers the bruschetta chicken recipe I use that’s on my personal page.  If I make again I will use crumbled baguettes in lieu of stuffing mix.  Tasty though as is, just different!

Super simple and pretty tasty too. The only thing I would change to to use less salt on the chicken, since the stuffing mix is pretty salty on its own, and combined it's a little bit much. Otherwise though, a great meal for a busy weeknight!

I’ve made this a few times now! It’s a hit with my family. I don’t add the water to the stuffing mix as there is plenty of water in the diced tomatoes and the extra water makes the stovetop stuffing a little soggy.

Nice recipe but I must confess I made a big change. Instead of chicken and bruschetta used Italian sausage meat taken out of the casing and spread across the bottom layer, topped that with cubed panchetta. Also instead of water I used chicken broth. Added some fresh thyme and parsley and parmesan cheese. So yes quite different  but I have to imagine better unhealthy you want the healthier chicken version.

Taste is a bit mild, but it's a good "quickie" meal when you are in a pinch. I put a layer of mozzarella between the chicken and stuffing, and then added a light layer of shredded parm on top of the stuffing. Good for a family dinner. Not necessarily an eye popper to make for company.

Do not add the salt! Needs more water so it is not so dry. Next time I would use a 9x9 pan to make a deeper dish. The taste is good.

Very good. Did double the recipe and replaced 1/4 cup of the water with balsamic vinegar. Tossed the chicken in Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Added hot pepper flakes to the tomatoes. Did not add salt. Easy. Would make again but does need more moisture.

More Cheese next time. Bland but easy to add more seasoning but not more salt.  I broiled for a few minutes at end after reading a “soggy” review.

This was great. I added Mozzarella to the top at the end to let it melt. I might add a little sausage next time to round out the flavor. We garnished with Cholula for a little added spice but a nice sprinkle of chorizo or  hamburger might be nice.

I made it twice as printed.... Wonderful!  One time I changed it up a bit and went Mexican style by changing to cornbread stuffing, tomatoes with green chiles combined with salsa and taco seasoning.  Again a big hit!

Whole family like it. Made as written. Next time I will use bigger pan so as to spread out chicken more and maybe juices will evaporate better. There was too much liquid on the bottom and had to pour off excess chicken juice. Otherwise great flavor.

I cook for one, so I not only changed the portions, but, adapted the ingredients to "my" taste. I also made it ahead, so anything frozen was thawed when I put it in the oven.  I sliced two frozen, uncooked, hot Italian sausages, and put in the bottom of a small pot pie tray. I put some frozen bell peppers strips on top, and sprinkled oregano over that. I then sprinkled some Romano  cheese on top, then a can of diced tomatoes, mixed with a cup  of dry stuffing mix on top, and sprinkled more Romano on that, and cooked as instructed. I like less cheese, and a crispier stuffing mixture, and it came out perfect for me. This recipe has boundless options, for meats  chorizo, linguica, lean hamburg.  Next time I may add mushrooms to the stuffing mix, or carmelized onions in lieu of the pepper strips !

Because my husband and I watch our sodium intake, I purchased lower sodium Stove Top Stuffing and there was the recipe printed on the back of the box. I omitted salting the chicken so used part of the Italian seasoning on the chicken and the rest over the top and I used no-added-salt tomatoes.  I divided the mixture between two 8-inch baking dishes, since we are a family of two and have one in the freezer for another meal. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and we enjoyed it. My four rating reflects that I didn't make it exactly as written and because if I had, the sodium content would have been very high.

It was a very simple and flavorful dish. I doubled it because I had more than 1.5 lbs of chicken that I needed to use. My husband and I liked it and I would make it again.

I made this with ingredients I had on hand. I used shredded sharp cheese instead of mozzarella, and canned stewed tomatoes. I added the shredded cheese on the chicken that added the stuffing/tomato mix on top of that. It was easy and quick to make, It is now my new favorite. Thanks for posting this recipe!  I'm not sure how to add a photo but I'll try.

This recipe is from Kraft Food and Family Magazine from about 15 to 20 years ago. It was a winner then and is still one of our favorites.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe but found it was really salty. Now when I make it, I don't salt and I think it's just great. My daughter always asks me to make it, and since she doesn't eat alot, it's perfect for her lunch for school.

I made this according to the directions. It had good flavor but the stuffing was a little too dry. Instead of cooking for 30 minutes I put a digital remote thermometer into the thickest piece of chicken and it only took about 16 minutes for the chicken to be done and the cheese melted. It wasn't too salty but i used diced tomatoes with no salt added. I will make this again but I want to find a way to moisten the stuffing. Other than that, good dish – thank you.

Oh so good!  I'm trying to go low carb, so I exchanged the stuffing with a thin layer of bread crumbs. Still so good, but next time I do that, I think I'll omit the half cup of water. Eh, live and learn. But this has such a good flavor!!

The family loved it! Doubled the recipe, halved the salt and added half a TBs of crushed red pepper to the chicken and a handful of frozen chopped green peppers to the stuffing mix. Next time(and there WILL be a next time) I think I'll cover it in foil for the 1st 20min, then let it brown for the last 10.

First, I agree with the few others that the review should be based on the recipe as written, not on the changes you have done to it. That being said, I made it as written and the family enjoyed it! Flavorful, wonderful aroma, cheesy and easy to make. Wil make it again, just as it is written. Thanks for sharing.

quick easy and  cheap. Browned the chicken first and like a reviewer suggested put the stuffing mix together just before oven, not soupy at all.

This was a tasty dish.  While putting the dish together, I mistakenly omitted the cheese from the top of the chicken, so instead, I put the shredded mozzarella on top.  If you do this, I would cover the dish with aluminum foil.  I left it uncovered and the cheese was dried out and tough.

If you omit the 1 tsp salt it's possible to get an additional sodium reduction (approx 40%) by switching to a 5 oz bag of croutons, e.g. garlic/cheese, and adding 1/2 tsp dried celery flakes, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder  to compensate for the missing flavorings.

It was good. It does taste just like bruschetta if you make it the way I did (can't speak for the original recipe with 100% certainty bc of my changes). I used 4 cups of cheese, used fresh tomatoes (diced) and their juices, and I sprinkled dried basil, oregano, & parsley in the bowl with the stuffing mix. I also sprinkled some of the 4 cups of cheese on top when I put the breeding mix on top. I'm not the hugest bruschetta fan, so it was good to me in a smaller quantity (not as a main dish).

I made this last night, exactly as the recipe called for.  We loved it!  It's a very easy and tasty dish.  It will be great for camping and potlucks.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a very good base recipe.  I can see how you can season it to your preference, Mexican with cumin, etc or Hawaiian with pineapple tidbits.  I didn't have stuffing mix so I used diced sun dried tomato bread and there was no issue with too much salt.  Thank you for a recipe I will use in so many ways.

Not sure what went wrong but it did not look anything like the picture. I followed the recipe exactly and it was dry and seemed to be missing something. It was like eating a chicken pizza crust. The flavors were good but I won't make this again.

No major changes to the original recipe (added a little extra garlic) and it turned out awesome.  We did top it with a balsamic reduction and that made it even better.

I made this, but changed it up a bit due to a lot of comments on it being too dry. First, I roasted a whole chicken with butter and minced garlic. Then I used the drippings in with the chicken on the first layer, so the chicken would be moist and succulent. I then layered the chicken with mozerella. I then cooked the stuffing on the stove top and added the diced tomatoes to it. I noticed it was a bit too watered down, so I added about half a cup of garlic bread crumbs to the stuffing (until I got that perfect soft, yet crumbly texture). Then I put that on top of my mozerella, and topped it with the remainder of cheese. Since everything was precooked I cooked my case role for only 20 min (until cheese was melted). The way I made it turned out so tasty! Thank you for the recipe and I look forward to adding this as a family favorite. :)

I had double the chicken, so doubled everything in the recipe.  I also only had half the stuffing needed (Stove Top cornbread stuffing), so filled out the rest with Italian bread crumbs.

It came out as cheesy chicken goodness!  I think next time I might marinate the chicken a little before-hand, add some olive oil, but other than that a brilliant recipe!

I don't like making changes... but I didn't plan for Sunday lunch!!! Sooooooo, I found this recipe! My chicken strips were frozen with no time to thaw them... I used 2 large cans of chicken from SAMs Club instead of raw chicken! I used 1 cup of water instead of chicken stock. I skipped the salt completely. I used homemade bread crumbs. I put in 2 tablespoon of chicken seasoning, I added 1 tablespoon of onion power, cause we love the added flair in everything!!! I had 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, 1 cup of Monterey Cheese, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese so I put those all in!!! Next problem... still short on time I threw it all into a pressure cooker and cooked for 15 mins, stirred and cooked 10 more minutes!!! Delishious!!! Not watery!!! I will add one more can of tomatoes next time(I only use the seasoned chopped tomatoes!!!)

I made this, but really made something tasting quite different.  I started with 4 strips of cut-up bacon that I cooked until crisp.  Then because I love onion, cut up a couple of onions and sauted them in the bacon fat.  Didn't have chicken flavored stuffing but used most of a package of classic Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix left over from Christmas to which I added an beaten egg, because I like the flavor the egg adds to stuffing .  And finally, I used a wedge of guyere cheese instead of mozzerella.  Made and assembled according to the recipe.  Very tasty.  Next time I will try it acording to the recipe with the addition of bacon, onion and an egg and see how that tastes.

When making this I felt a little funny using boxed dressing and I was right to fell that way. Next time I will make my own dressing so it doesn't have that artificial taste. It's a shame because this could have been a 5 star recipe.

Great and easy recipe! I just made a few changes, after placing the chicken inside the glass pan I covered the chicken with a light coat of tomato sauce. Used Italian and mozzarella cheese on top tomato sauce and after placing the stuffing on top of the chicken. Also I used Italian sausage inside the stuffing mix.

Wish I'd read the reviews first. It was soggy, so next time I'll leave out the water. I'll mix the tomatoes and herbs,  put that over the chicken and cheese, bake it then top with either the stuffing mix or Italian croutons and get it toasty.

We used 3 large chicken breasts,  We drizzled the chicken with Italian dressing.  We also added the garlic and Italian Seasoning to the chicken.  You definitely have to double the amount of cheese in the middle and add more to the top (shredded parm is super).  We baked ours for 45 minutes...30 minutes covered with foil then uncovered the pan and sprinkled with more cheese and back into the oven for 15 minutes.  We loved it!

The idea is great....but the recipe is lacking flavor. I used savory herb stuffing and pounded chicken tenderloins, because that is what I had on hand. The cheese for me played NO role in the flavor of the dish. 
I'm going to keep in my recipe box and try perhaps to derive a more flavorful dish. Thank you for Sharing.

Good recipe. I used fresh tomatoes, instead of canned. It seemed like it needed some marinara.
Edit: I made this again and made changes suggested by other reviews. I cooked the chicken on the stove in olive oil, Italian seasoning, black pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Next time, I'll use oregano instead of Italian seasoning (I don't care for thyme).  For the stuffing mixture, I added 2 teaspoons of Balsamic vinegar. 2 teaspoons were too strong, so I'll reduce that. I added parmesan cheese with the mozzarella and a few basil leaves. Also, I added 10 minutes to the bake time. Better flavor with these changes.

This was very good!  I did pre-season the chicken ( I always do) in some olive oil vinaigrette for a couple of hours. I didn't have chicken boxed stuffing, but I did have some herbed stuffing and used that. I added a couple of slices of provolone on top because it just looked dry.   Very quick and easy.  My husband liked it  a lot.  I felt it needed more flavor.  Will add more seasoning and more cheese next time.  Definitely adaptable and a keeper.

Made this tonight and it was delish.  Served it with mashed potatoes and beans.  Leftovers for tomorrow and serving it with rice.  Will definitely make this again.  I added some fresh basil as well.  Gave it an extra nice flavour.

This recipe very good as is. I would next time forgo the salt. I noticed the recipe is or was the same one suggested in the boxed bread stuffing except for the amounts of water and cheese. However, it this recipe is spot on regarding the amount of water and cheese. For those who say it is watery don't cover the pan with aluminum foil. Don't be afraid of baking this recipe as instructed. It will come out just right. If you are afraid of undercooked chicken, you can cover it with foil and remove it the last 10 minutes so the stuffing comes out brown and a bit crispy. Overall, will make it again!

With all the different reviews I didn't know if wanted to make this but now I'm glad I did. It's one of my family's favorites and the only thing I did different was slowly add the water until there was just enough to moisten the stuffing mix . Now I know to trust that if it's on allrecipes than its usually a very good recipe.

I changed the recipe following some of the reviews here including putting breadcrumbs on the chicken and seasoning it with black pepper, oregano, Himalayan on king salt, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. I only used mozzarella (regrettably) over the chicken with seasoning over it; and then I put the stuffing mixture and put the same seasoning as already mentioned above. I topped off the stuffing mixture with three cheese packet shredded cheese and some more seasoning. The chicken wasn't dry as some has said and I didn't pre cook it (just thawed it out). Overall, was an easy meal to prep, but not something I really enjoyed eating.

This was a great and easy meal to make. I only made a couple of changes; I marinated the chicken in red wine for 4 hours and I purchased 3-cheese Kroger made bread to use in instead of the stuffing mix. Wow! I was impressed. By cooking this dish uncovered you are able to obtain a crispy edge to it. Nothing soggy here. ..just right! Thanks so much for sharing. I will be making it again.

Last minute choice to use this recipe in today's mail which required using what I had on hand. Tossed chicken with Plain Panko bread crumbs plus some Italian bread crumbs; added olive oil, balsamic vinegar and various seasonings. Mixed Fire Diced tomatoes with more balsamic vinegar and the water plus a little olive oil. My cheese was Mexican 5 cheese instead of  mozzarella; I added Romano cheese and more Italian Seasonings. It baked up beautiful in 35 minutes. We had leftover white rice, so I served the Brushetta Chicken with Mexican cheese over white rice. My husband eats whatever I serve him with rarely a comment good or bad. This meal got a rare compliment!  Hopefully I can pull it off again the next time!  Don't be afraid to make this your own.

I've been making this for years.  It's easy to adjust ingredients to your preferences, or what you have on hand.  It's always been a hit in our kitchen!  For those who found stuffing soggy, consider draining some of the liquid from the tomatoes, or add more stuffing mix or some bread crumbs to it.  We like our stuffing on the drier side and I've never had that problem.  We like fire roasted tomatoes better than rotel in this.  Once I only had cornbread stuffing on hand and used that. My husband loved it!  I agree as few others have said, that marinating the chicken does add more flavor to the recipe.  I often have herb flavored stuffing rather than chicken box mix, and I personally like that better.  Don't be reluctant to use different cheese you prefer (or even a combination of them) or revamp up spices to suit your taste buds.

Ok I added more cheese(4cups). I also used fire roasted tomatoes and I increased the garlic. I think next time I'll add eggplant to one side (for me), and zucchini to the other for (my son).

Can this be frozen?  Next time I make it I'll cut the salt to 1/2 teas.  and double the cheese.  I also used Stove Top Stuffing mix. It's the only thing I can find in Bangkok. Overall it was good.

I used the herbed and spiced diced tomatoes (in a can) and slightly reduced the chicken topping (my box was only 4ounces not 6) but other than that I left it the same and it was great! Definitely a keeper.

Didn't turn out as well as anticipated. After it was baked, there was a ton of liquid in the bottom that had to be drained out. Followed the recipe except that we put the cheese on the top of the dish instead of on top of the chicken and below the stuffing mix.

I would have given it 5 stars but I did make changes. Marinate the chicken in Italian dressing, use a can of stewed tomatoes with Italian flavorings in it, leave out the salt and add Parmesan cheese. Really good taste. Everyone liked it.

I followed your additions which made it absolutely delicious! The balsamic, fresh tomatoes,and basil I feel help the dish out a lot! Try adding some pancetta or prosciutto to the chicken bottom adds an extra nice Italian  taste to the dish!

We raise our own chickens,  so I opted to try this out since once the bird is cooked in the crockpot, we debone the chicken and use the cooked chicken throughout the week.   I used a savory Stovetop Stuffing mix and by choice opted to cut back on the salt and thought it turned out tasty. Not too dry at all. Seemed odd to me that it was without a sauce but had good flavor nonetheless.  Since my chicken was already cooked I only baked for 20 min.

I served this to my very picky family and they unanimously agreed I should make it again.  I changed it up a bit using prepared bruschetta purchased at my local store's olive bar, therefore, I eliminated the salt, Italian seasoning and garlic as well as the canned tomatoes.  Just 5 simple ingredients.  Yummm

I really enjoyed this dish. It was so simple, quick and easy. I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand and what other reviews had to say. I did not add any salt. Instead of water I used chicken stock, only because I did not want what I have left to go bad, added some red pepper flakes, lots of garlic (since I love garlic), and Italian seasoned canned tomatoes (like I would in a pinch to make bruschetta), plus a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar. Note ... use lots of cheese!!  I had an Italian cheese mix on hand. The top of the stuffing was crisp and crunchy while the inside was soft and most as stuffing should be. I will make this again.

Came out a little soggy the first day but still really flavorful. After reheating it for leftovers it was AMAZING. Great with pasta sauce and I added bowtie pasta on the side. Great easy dish!

I did as one reviewer suggested and marinated chicken in Italian dressing.  Great idea.  Also I added some balsamic vinegar as she had suggested, but only 1 tsp.  Another good idea.  More cheese.....fantastic idea.  Husband said it was good.  I don't care for chicken so going by his rating and not mine.  It was ok but doubtful I will make again.  Also used fresh tomatoes.  This  would be very good with beef.

My husband went nuts over this recipe! It was so easy to throw together. I did not cube the chicken, I placed 3 chicken breasts on the bottom of the pan. I also used diced tomatoes with garlic and onion instead of plain diced tomatoes.

Love this two dish recipe (a bowl to mix everything in and a casserole dish)!  Used fresh tomatoes, oregano, and chives from the garden.  I had doubled the recipe for my family  and friends (good thing, there was just enough left for 2 lunches) and it took longer to cook because of it.  Who doesn't love stuffing?

I read about 1/3 of the reviews and more or less followed the original recipe.  I did add Balsamic vinegar and omitted the salt.  I cut my three boneless/skinless chicken breasts in thirds and browned them in as skillet.  This recipe is a keeper!!!  So easy with the ability to serve it to company.

This is the first time I have made this casserole and I think with a little tweaking I could make it a 5 star meal.  I will make the following changes next time; 1. Mix the Italian spices into the stuffing rather than sprinkle them on top.  They just sat of on top of the stuffing and didn't blend well.  2.  Reduce a little garlic; it was quite overwhelming.  One change I did make this time was to add a large handful of chopped spinach just to give it an extra punch of something healthy.

Since I'm at a higher altitude, we ended up with raw chicken in the center of the pan when the cooking instructions were followed.  I'd recommend browning the chicken first.  Other than that the recipe was really good with a couple of modifications.  Added balsamic and pepper and garlic powder to the chicken, added balsamic and Italian seasoning to fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and added Parmesan to the top.

I made this tonight and it was very good. I always add a little extra of herbs and spices. So it was not bland. However, I feel its missing more...it just seems so light...next time I may add pasta or pasta sauce to give it a little more substance.

Really good!  Added my own twist, instead of the salt, I poured about 1/2 of Italian dressing over the chicken and used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded. Comfort food at it's best!

I don't think I particularly liked the stuffing. I feel like if I could substitute something else this recipe would be wonderful. However the stuffing was a bit soggy and I felt like there was a bit too much of it. The recipe was great though for a quick easy dinner.

I followed another's advice and did half water, half olive oil. I also used fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden, little bit parmesan on top chicken and put the mozzarella on as last layer. Will be making again. My husband wants me to put it on pizza dough.

Made as is, it was okay.  If you didn't know it was stove top stuffing, the flavor was a bit disguised, but as the cook who put the ingredient in there, it was hard to miss the distinct taste of it.  Mine also came out too dry as the stuffing soaked up all the juices and we couldn't taste the cheese at all.  This is a great idea though and with some tweaking we will try it again, skipping this Hamburger helper variety and use maybe fresh bread cubes, real bruschetta and parmesan cheese

The combination of tomatoes and dressing isn't very good.  Perhaps this would have been better made with real bread and built with the bread on the bottom using traditional bruschetta ingredients.

Just made this recipe. So good!! I tweaked it and used a can of Western Family fire roasted tomatoes and garlic blend and added balsamic vinegar (as someone else suggested) to the stuffing mix. Also tossed the chicken with balsamic vinegar, powdered garlic, ground pepper and Italian seasoning.  And added a blend of mozzarella, parmesan, asiago and provolone on top of the chicken. Will make this again!!

I made this almost exactly like the original. I only added probably 1/4 -1/2 teaspoon of salt to the chicken, and I used mixed Mexican cheese rather than just mozerella. Everything else was the same. My stuffing was in between soggy and crunchy - more like normal stuffing consistency. It wasn't gourmet, but but husband and I ate all of it and have lunch for the next day, too!

This was such a simple and excellent meal. Very fast, but so good. My hubby gave it a 4.5, (he practically licked the dish clean)

We loved it. Tasted exactly like what you would expect for something called Bruschetta Chicken bake. Even my daughter who normally hates cooked tomato enjoyed it. This was made exactly as stated above. The only comment my hunny had was to cut the chicken up a bit more bite size which will effect the cook time but I will work on that.

This was not to my liking at all (sorry!). My hubs thought this was "OK," but wouldn't be disappointed if he never had it again. The stuffing mix and tomatoes dominated each bite. Every now and then I'd taste a bite of chicken, but most of the time, I was eating a mouthful of stuffing and tomatoes. Another observation I have to share is that a 9 x 13 in. baking dish is far too large for this. I suggest using an 8 or 9 in. pan instead. I also strongly suggest adding more chicken (or skipping the cubing step altogether) in order to ensure the ratio of each component is appropriately balanced. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do much for me. Thanks anyways, Heather.

The recipe turned out great. I did have to use Herbs de Provence in place of the Italian seasoning as I was out. The best part was it was very easy to make!

Pretty good flavor. I added a bit more seasonings because we like a lot of flavor. I thought the recipe could use more chicken but otherwise it was pretty tasty, quick and easy! Even my picky son ate it, and anything he'll eat is a keeper!

My whole family loves this.  I even turned on people at work to it and they also have made it part of their menu!
I marinate the chicken in italian dressing first for some extra flavor.  You can also just toss some dressing on the diced chicken when you layer the pan with it.

My family liked this meal.  I did substitute a T of olive oil and a T of balsamic vinegar for some of the water. I also added some fresh basil.  Other than that I followed the recipe. An easy and tasty meal.

I was a vegetarian and just starting to eat chicken again so I made this for my husband. He is super picky and doesn't normally try new things so I was a little nervous, but he LOVED it! We were out of normal cheese (who runs out of cheese??) so I just sprinkled some Parmesan on top of the stuffing and it was amazing! Didn't even miss the cheese, and it  was much lower in fat that way!

Easy to prepare dish but needs some extra seasonings.  I added balsamic vinegar to the chicken as well as stuffing mix (as recommended by others) and used a mix of cheeses.  I might make it again if I was in a hurry.

My husband hates tomatoes, but LOVED this recipe!  There is so much flavor in every bite, my family had seconds (some even had thirds) and it was so easy to make.  We'll be having this again VERY soon!

This was soooo good!  I marinated the chicken in balsalmic vinegrette dressing for two hours prior.  I then layered that on the bottom of the dish.  I used four fresh tomatoes (don't add any additional water!!) a little olive oil and a little balsalmic vinegar, red onion, garlic, and wheat noodles instead of bread crumbs.  It was amazingly light and fresh pasta dish!  Be sure to mix in the cheese though and not layer it on top- it got a little clumpy!  Will definitely make again!

It's a good recipe in theory. I've made one quite similar off the box of Stove Top Stuffing if not just about exactly.  All the ingredients go together, but to me, it just seems odd to have diced chicken on the bottom with the stuffing mixture on top. Doesn't seem to hold anything together and it was really, really dry. By the time the stuffing soaks up the juice from the tomatoes and then gets baked, it seems to dry out. So it's wonderful if it turns out great for you, but for me, this recipe is just too dry.

The way this recipe sounded, I thought it would taste good.  It wasn't very good for me.  People better remember that if you try any recipes, they're not starving to death.  Thanks for the recipe that did taste good to some people, but not to me - thanks again for it.

Not outstanding, but definitely a great quick,  basic meal. Plenty of flavor & interesting taste.  My kids loved it, but thought that the bread crumbs didn't taste good so mushy. Something I will try next time I make this meal is to 1) leave the bread crumbs out until just prior to topping the chicken - to try to reduce some of the mushy texture my kids didn't like about it. 2) Sprinkle some of the cheese over the top of the bread crumbs as well.

This was excellent! I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out or if it would be enough as a meal on on its own, but it was. Next time I might add some tomato sauce to bottom as another reviewer suggested, and maybe some more veggies to bulk it up a bit. I was impressed with this!

I'm a single (full-time working) mom & I was so excited when this recipe was quick, easy, & delicious... I use Penzey spices with every meal I make and with the proper spices this dish was fantastic! Thank You, Heather! (I used garlic herb diced tomatoes for added flavor.)

pretty good, but not a bruchetta texture/topping you expect with the title of the recipe being what it is. I did add a side of angel hair pasta and garlic bread to complete the meal! I will make this again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I did not have boxed stuffing mix, so I cubed and toasted some sourdough bread (I also increased the Italian seasoning and added some poultry seasoning to make up for the seasoning that comes in the mix).  Like other reviewers, I also used half water/half olive oil, and cut back on the salt.  My 2 year old ate this up, which makes it a keeper in my house.  Will make again.

This is a family favorite :) the only thing I do different is instead of using stuffing mix, I make home made cornbread & crumble it into the tomato mixture. Also tried it with green chilies...so good!

My husband is not normally a fan of chicken because he thinks it's too dry, but he ate darn near all this pan!  The kiddos and myself were lucky to get a serving.  I thought it was pretty yummy, but if you impress him, on CHICKEN, no less, 5 stars all the way!

I was a little disappointed to find this recipe on the back of the Stove Top box after finding it here... But it turned out well. I got rave reviews. To me, though, it just tasted like the pizza I make all the time. I enjoyed it, I just don't know if I'll make it again.

4 Stars as written, 5 with some changes. Followed other reviewers advise and added a couple tablespoons of balsamic vin., also used italian style diced tomatoes, personally I think it could use another can, will do that next time!

Well you never know how a recipe will turn out until you try.  I did try it as written and it was just okay - nothing special.  It was easy enough to make and we did eat it but we found it dry and a little bit strange.  No one wanted seconds.  I ended up scraping off the stuffing and using the chicken in a mac and cheese so all was not lost.  Won't be making this again.

I cut the salt from 1 tsp. to just a dash- and the stuffing mixtire was still extremely salty.  Overall, an okay dish, but probably won't make this one again.

This was a great, easy recipe for a weeknight dinner.  I added a box of chopped spinach (drained) on top of the chicken. I also omitted mozzarella and grated fresh parmesan on top of the stuffing. I used chicken breast tenders so the cutting up was pretty easy. Previous reviewers suggested that the chicken might not cook well, so I added 6 or 7 minutes to the cook time.  It came out perfectly.

This was so good and so easy to make. I used 2 lbs of diced chicken and had a nice layer on the bottom of the pan. Served with a salad and it was a great meal. Leftovers are just as good.

I was having a date over for supper for the first time and was planning on making salmon, until I found out he was anti-seafood.  I phoned my sister to find me a quick recipe because I was already at the grocery store.  She found this one.  I made it in limited time, and it was awesome!  He was also impressed I tackled a new recipe the first time I cooked for him :)

I have only been a member for a little while, but this is by far the BEST recipe I have tried yet! Of course I made minor changes: I used two cans of diced Del Monte Oregano and Basil Tomatoes. I skipped the salt and just seasoned the chicken with Seasoned Salt and Tenderizor. I added only about 1/4 cup of water. I didn't want the stuffing to get too soggy. Added some Splenda to the tomato stuffing mix to cut the tartness a little. Added Garlic Power instead of minced garlic. Used reduced fat mozzerella and it was brilliant! I highly recommend for a quick dish or for company party. It's a very mobile dish and very filling. A+

Per reviews, I added a little Italian dressing over the chicken for flavor. I also used Italian diced tomatoes instead of plain and added an extra sprinkle of mozzarella on top (not much, maybe a quarter cup). Overall, this dish had very nice flavor and was sort of like a quick alternative to lasagna. I was thinking about adding black olives but I'm glad I didn't, because it came out quite salty even though I used half of the salt the recipe called for, but this was probably a result of my changes and not the recipe itself. I really liked this dish and will most likely make it again with a few alterations.

This was good for a nice change.  My husband liked it and he is pretty picky.  I used Hunts Fire Roasted diced tomatoes and it was really good.  I only used 2 chicken breasts, next time I will use 4.

I gave this 4 stars.  It was SO easy and great for a quick weeknight meal.  The chicken was a little bland even though I did season it with garlic and italian seasoning to.  Next time I will cut up some italian sausages and put in there as well.  It was really eye appealing. I had to use stewed tomatoes because I was out of diced.  I don't think it made a difference.

Husband said it was "Awesome".  It wasn't to try but not real moist either.  I mistakenly bought diced tomatoes with sweet onions.  I would do that again.  I toped with parmesan cheese.

After reading others' reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.  I did not add the tsp of salt as the recipe states, and I used fresh tomatoes (I have an abundance from the garden so I'm trying to use them up!).  I think this dish really has the potential to be something a little more than just another casserol with stuffing...maybe homemade stuffing might be the trick!

Hubby and I didn't care for this dish too much but based more on our personal preferences than the dish itself.  I gave it 4 stars anyway because the presentation is very nice, I followed the recipe, and the dish came out exactly as it was supposed to. Hubby and I just don't like stuffing much after all.

I made this a month or so ago from a recipe on the stovetop stuffing box.  It was not delicious.  I ended up with leftovers that were never used.  The flavors did not combine well and the tomatoes left the whole thing tasting very acidic (despite the balance of carbs/protein/dairy/fat).  It was edible, but there are far better ways to cook chicken.

I've made this before; it's a great dish that we make a few times during the Fall and Winter months.  I love it because you can definitely play around with the flavors.  I have never cubed the chicken; I just use regular breasts that I'd browned prior too and it cooks fine.  The stuffing turns out moist on the inside and crunchy on top.  I always use the orgegano & basil diced tomatoes.  Next time I will try marinating the chicken and adding balsamic vinegar as suggested by some of the other reviewers.

Loved it! I used two cans of chunk chicken and just seasoned with some salt and pepper. Tasted great. What an easy meal to throw together at the last minute.

I really loved this.  It was not difficult to make and I had all these common ingredients on hand.  That is always a bonus when I am out of ideas for a fast but tasty dinner.

My husband liked this, and I liked it, too, except for the TWANG from the Stovetop Stuffing I used.  It was too strong.  I think I would use more tomatoes next time and maybe get a different stuffing mix - maybe the kind that comes in a bag that is not quite so overpowering.

This was good, not my favorite meal, but it's good for when you need something quick and easy. I did marinate my chopped chicken in some Italian dressing for about an hour. I felt like the stuffing was mushy, but I may have let it sit for a bit too long. I'll make this again.

If I made this again, I would use more cheese and less stuffing mix, but I thought it was quite bland overall.
