These are verry good but I'm only giving it four stars since the "to die for blueberry muffins" are slightly better.  I made both recipes on the same days and they turned out almost identical in flavour.  However, the "to die for blueberry muffins" recipe had a thicker batter resulting in rounded muffin tops whereas this recipe is thinner so as it was rising the batter spread out more so the muffin tops were flatter. Vanilla is a nice addition to either recipe, and I would strongly recommend using only fresh blueberries.

every year my family loves this recipe.

to make the buttermilk - 1/2 cup milk add 1/2 tablespoon of white vinegar and let stand for 5 minutes.  

easy to make and always comes out great.

This year I substituted 3/4 of splenda for the sugar.  Nobody complained. Everybody loves them.   They are great muffins.

These are the best blueberry muffins. This is the exact recipe that I have been using for years except that my recipe called for 1/2 cup milk instead of the 1/2 cup buttermilk.  I tried it with buttermilk and found that since nobody tasted the difference, why buy buttermilk unless you are going to use it for other recipes. I ended up throwing out the leftover buttermilk since the smallest container i could find was the quart size and i only needed 1/2 cup.

I really wish I could rate this four and a half stars. It's ALMOST there. I cut the sugar back to one cup, added a tsp. of vanilla and used half blueberries/half blackberries. Really great muffin. The sugar topping made the muffins look like bakery muffins. I really didn't use a lot, just a tiny sprinkling over each muffin. Really, really good. I think adding a little lemon rind would really take these over the edge. NOTE: I actually baked these at 400* for about 20 minutes.

absolutely wonderful!  i had to make some changes:  i used 1 tsp lemon juice with remainder milk to make the 1/2 c buttermilk, i used 16 oz bag of thawed blueberries.  i think that was more than it called for.  i crushed 1/4 of them and put the rest in as the recipe called for.  instead of the sugar on top, i used the following from another recipe:
1/2 cup white sugar 
1/3 cup all-purpose flour 
1/4 cup butter, cubed, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
mix and add before baking

Thanks to all who have given these muffins such nice reviews. The secret to having any fruit stay suspended throughout your muffins is dusting the fruit with a small amount of the flour called for in the recipe. (Just like you do in this recipe) I,like many reviewers, almost always use powdered buttermilk.    Lynn

These were not "The Best" blueberry muffins and in fact I was a bit disappointed with these. I was expected something really good especially with the amount of blueberries and buttermilk in the recipe. However, even after adding 2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter I found these to be overly sweet and a bit on the bland side. I baked these in Texas sized muffin cups lined with paper liners and topped the muffins with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. I baked them at 400 for 23 minutes. And, while they baked up nice and big the flavor just wasn't there.... I think I'll stick to my TNT recipe "Blueberry Cream Muffins" from this site.

I thought these muffins had a very nice flavor. There were a few too many blueberries for my taste, though.  Next time I'll put in half the amount.
 One suggestion I do have:  if you *really* want them to have a crumb topping, you need to sprinkle more than just sugar on top.  Make a mixture of 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tablespoons of flour and 1 Tablesppon of butter.  Mix it all together and top the muffins with that instead before putting in the oven -- YUMMY!

Don't change a thing! Baked up fluffy, moist, like a cake!! A doubled recipe filled 24 x-large paper muffin cups generously to 2/3full and they were large and perfect. Wow!!! After YEARS of searching for a perfect muffin recipe, THIS IS IT! I used a stand mixer and just kept it beating merrily away! Who would have thought THAT with a muffin recipe?! Oh, JOY, oh, Bliss...this is heavenly!!!

I agree, these ARE the best!!  My modifications; no buttermilk on hand so subbed regular 1% milk with a sqeeze of lemon juice in it, did not crush berries, added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest, and sprinkled raw turbinado sugar on the top instead of white sugar.   I'm don't have a huge sweet tooth yet I kept coming back to these taking a small piece of a muffin - before I knew it the muffin had disappeared b4 my eyes!!

My muffins just got out of the oven and they taste great.  They taste even better than the lower fat pumpkin muffins I made and reviewed.  I made the following changes:
I used applesauce instead of butter
1/2 cup Splenda & 1/2 cup brown sugar
2 egg whites
1/2 cup skim milk
3 Tablespoons of Vanilla Extract
I did not sprinkle sugar on top

The muffins taste great for a lower fat, sugar, cholesterol muffin.  I'm glad they don't taste any better cause it would be hard to have just one.  Now that I have this recipe, I will never again buy a muffin at a coffee shop.  THANK YOU.

I have a few criticisms of this "just okay" muffin.  First, let's call it what it is - coffeecake in a muffin cup, but I'm okay with that.  It wasn't flat, but it doesnt rise as nicely as it should.  There are too many blueberries, believe it or not - not enough cake. Half the amount of berries would not only have been far tastier, but would have made a sturdier muffin as well.  Finally, I felt it needed the oomph of a little vanilla. Certainly NOT the best muffin I've ever made.  Oh... and this 12-muffin recipe turned out to be 17 standard-sized muffins. The second muffin tin and I were not prepared for this discrepancy.

I made these and "Stresel Topped Blueberry Muffins" (from this site) to see which I liked better.  These were good, but just didn't look or taste quite as good as the steusel topped muffins.

These muffins are excellent!  I used non-stick extra-large muffin pans and sprayed with PAM but didn't use paper liners and they came right out of the pan when they were done.  The only modifications I made to the recipe were doubling the amount of blueberries, I kept all the blueberries whole (did not crush them), and I left out the sugar topping.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is and they were the best muffins I've ever made (and I've made plenty in the past).  Just a few comments for less experienced bakers - when creaming the butter, make sure you use the paddle attachment on the stand mixer and make sure the butter is at room temperature.  Creaming the butter and sugar together should result in something that looks like fluffy icing/frosting.  When adding the blueberries, make sure the blueberries are first coated/dusted with a bit of flour, and carefully fold them into the batter (keeping the fluffiness of the batter/dough).  Finally, the buttermilk is a must - you cannot substitute the buttermilk in this recipe.

Exceptional muffins.  Followed recipe except that I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and I didn't crush any of the berries before adding to the mix.  What I did do was take the last 1/4 cup of flour and toss the berries with it before adding to the batter so they berries wouldn't bleed into it.  Wonderful muffins!

Oh my goodness - go ahead and make these, you won't be sorry!  They are perfectly sweet, moist and light - and very easy to make.  I used frozen blueberries (1-1/2 c)and they came out perfect!  Thank you for the recipe!  Off to have another!

This is what muffins are supposed to taste like, excellent. I want to suggest that you will want to use muffin papers. I had none, and the muffins crumbled when I tried to remove them.

These are the BEST muffins I have ever tasted!  I have been making them for two years and they are PERFECT every time! I double the recipe to make  jumbo muffins (always remember to use liners). I leave all of the blueberries whole and add a little vanilla.  Before baking, I sprinkle them with sugar crystals and a little light brown sugar. This recipe is a keeper!

I made a few changes: (1) I did not have fresh blueberries, so I used frozen ones, (2) I did not crush 1/4 of them, but reduced the amount of blueberry to 3/4 pint, (3) did not make the topping and (4) used 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice + enough milk to make 1/2 cup instead of buttermilk. The muffins turned out great, with a great taste and wonderful texture.

These muffins are fail safe. I've also made the "to die for" muffins, I liked these better. I got ahead of myself in the recipe and added all the sugar at once, then I messed up the order of adding things. OMG..still super great. To me,  mashing those blueberries make more of a blueberry flavor to the muffin. The only thing I added was about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I think cinnamon always compliments blueberries. I also have made this same recipe using banana's instead of blueberries. The texture of these muffins is by far the best. They are just great. I wish there were 6 stars.

I did not have buttermilk so substituted half and half with a tablespoon of white vinegar and let it set while I measured and made the batter.  It worked perfectly.  I also had to use frozen blueberries, thawed, drained, and patted gently dry with a paper towel.  I followed the directions as for the fresh berries and that worked wonderfully, too.  I made the batch for six muffins and ended up with nine so I guess I didn't fill the cups enough  so the baking time was only 25 minutes .  Next time I will fill the cups up 2/3 instead of 1/2. . . great food treat.  :-)

I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted 1/2 cup of 2% milk with 1 tsp of vinegar (letting it sit for about 5 minutes before using).  I also used frozen wild blueberries from Trader Joe's and the muffins came out great!  I didn't have any paper liners, but I sprayed my non-stick pan with cooking spray and didn't have any problems with the muffins sticking (after loosening the sides of the muffins with a knife).  I also used a jumbo muffin pan (filled all six cups) and baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.

Just awesome!  In a dark metal muffin pan you can cook an extra 2 or 3 minutes and get a nicely caramelized outer body.....

Made with 3/4 cup white and slightly less than 1/2 cup brown sugar; 1 1/4 cup wheat flour and 3/4 white. Frozen blueberries. Added 1 tsp vanilla. Used milk+lemon juice in place of buttermilk. They're delicious. A bit more fat and sugar than I like in a muffin, but a fantastic dessert-y type treat.

This recipe is great! My tips: For a little less fat, I used 1/2 cup non-fat milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon in place of the buttermilk. I used fresh blueberries but reduced them to 1 cup instead of 2 cups (1 pint) -- I agree with others that this recipe called for too many blueberries. I used foil cupcake baking cups instead of paper and they slid right out!

Hey Lynn, you may not be the "muffin man", but you're certainly the MUFFIN GAL!! These were incredibly delicious. I love using buttermilk in recipes and the instructions to dust the blueberries with the flour is brilliant! I did add a crumb topping and my whole clan absolutely loved them. Thanks so much!

Don't think I've ever flopped muffins before, but did with this recipe.  Turned out flat.  Good flavor though.  Maybe a little too much sugar.

These were amazing! I did make a few small changes - I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla, sprinkled with coarse demerera sugar instead of white sugar, and used plumped dried blueberries instead of fresh. I have been told they are the best blueberry muffins ever- and at the least I think they are the best I have ever made. Thanks for this recipe, it's a definate keeper!

Great muffins!  I used frozen wild blueberries (rinsed).  Omitted the extra 1/4 C flour that coated the berries.  Even though I coated the tin with spray they still stuck and were hard to get out, next time I'll make sure I use paper cups.

Perfect! I made mini muffins (32 total) and they were delicious. I subbed the buttermilk with lemon yogurt and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I used 1-1/2 cups blueberries total. Will definitely make again!

I used some blueberries I had leftover in the freezer. I also added some vinegar to 1% milk to make buttermilk. I don't like using butter, so instead I used non-hydrogenated margarine. The muffins were so yummy! I love how the top was crunchy from the sugar. I will definitely be making more of these soon! :)

OMG!!! I went into this recipe with the usual "it's a muffin how bad can it be" attitude and let me tell ya...I cook alot so my house smells good most of the time but NEVER-EVER this good.And these are great.LOADED with berries,super moist,sweet yet not overly.I can see why you need the liners though...don't skip that part.I only wish I would've had the liners for my jumbo tray,as I personally dont think regular muffins are as pretty on the plate as jumbo.5 stars though-all over the board.

This is going to be one of my staple recipes. I didn't have any milk, so I substituted 1/2 cup of vanilla lowfat yogurt for the milk and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. I also didn't follow the strange mixing instructions because that seemed like it would be overmixed. I did it the usual way: Cream together butter & sugar, add eggs and beat. Then add milk/yogurt. Mix together dry ingredients and blueberries, then combine the wet and dry. My muffins rose really nicely and look great.

I love this recipe and so did everyone at work!  My co-worker said "these are really good, better than the boxed ones I make, and those are pretty good."  :-)  

I did make a couple of additions though:
-zest of one lemon
-1tsp. of vanilla
-didn't have buttermilk (so used milk w/ addition of tsp of vinegar)
-I didn't crush the blueberries (didn't want blue muffins) and MAKE SURE you coat blueberries w/ flour before adding it to the wet mixture (this is what makes the blueberries float instead of sink).  
-I also the streusel topping that the other reviewers suggested.  

Yum!  It is more like a cake batter than a regular muffin, which is fine by me!  Enjoy!

All I have to say is....WOW - these were DELICIOUS! Not to mention extremely easy to make. The only thing I substituted was frozen blueberries for fresh and I am glad that I did. The frozen ones that I bought were HUGE,juicy and tasty and did fantastic in the recipe. Will definitely be making this one again. Thanks to Lynn and her Grandma :)

These were delicious!  Even my blueberry hating 5 year old devoured a couple.  I used margarine instead of butter and omitted the salt, plus I used homo milk instead of the buttermilk.  These muffins don't rise much, so you really have to overload the paper cups to get the big crusty top that make the muffin!

I really didn't like this recipe. Too much batter for 12 average size muffin cups, it was too sweet, fell apart too easily, and ended up too flat. No muffins I've ever eaten have been made with butter... always oil. These are too much like cake. I won't be trying this recipe again. :/

FANTASTIC!!!
This is the first time I have used butter instead of oil in a muffin recipe. I liked the cakey style, it was a huge hit with my blueberry loving family. I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar instead of plain otherwise it was perfect!
I just made again using 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour, and only half the sugar tastes great!
I made again using cranberries, really nice, add lemon zest as well, yummy!

I thought these were delicious and wonderfully easy muffins!  A huge hit at Easter brunch.  I topped with Sugar in the Raw to get the coated topping.  Also substituted frozen for fresh bluberries due to availability.  Will make again!

Very yummy & easy to make!  I made a few changes due to practical reasons.  I skipped salt because I was using semi-salted butter.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used one small peach yogurt, which was a little less than 1/2 cup, so I added milk to make it 1/2 cup.  I didn't dust blueberries with flour because they were really well strained and almost dry, and they stayed well suspended.  I had some leftover cream cheese, so instead of sprinkling with sugar, I mixed the cream cheese with white sugar & milk into yogurt consistency and put a spoonful on each.  The batter was really thick, so I was worried it might not turn out well, but they came out with perfectly round tops and didn't even crack much. The cream cheese topping made for a very moist and slightly sweeter top.

Makes 24 muffins regular sized, not 12.  Also, way too buttery for me and a bit too sweet.  I would cut at least 2 T of the butter out and the sugar to 1 C at most.  Also, I would cook until tops are golden brown since they never sprang like the instructions say.  Like the amount of blueberries.  The muffins are good enough to eat, but not my opinion of”the best”.

I have been looking for a great blueberry muffin recipe and after a few tweaks I have found it! I add some cinnamon and vanilla and then did some butter, brown sugar and flour for the tops. YUMMY!

I have to give these 4 stars even though they didn't have a nice muffin top. Very delicious. I changed minor things like using whole wheat flour and frozen fruit medley because this is what I had on hand. I used baking soda on accident but they were still fabulous. Will make again. I think a little cinnamon would be wonderful in these too. Thanks so much Auntlynnie!

Absolutely amazing muffins!! I use Presidents Choice Frozen Wild Blueberries instead of fresh in the winter.  Don't mix the frozen blueberries in until you are ready to scoop the batter into the tin as the batter gets really cold and thick fast.  Then I bake them in a 350 degree oven for 25 mintues and they are perfect.

A little sweet for my tastes and the part about mashing a few berries into the dough will predictably turn them slightly blue, not classic like the picture. But still tasty.

The flavor was fine, but the texture was terrible...there was nothing delicate about them...and by the time they were finally cooked through they were dry as a bone on the outside.  I felt like I was eating a blueberry cookie...  will not make again.

I would give this recipe a "0" if I could. It was the worst recipe I've ever tried. I was skeptical when the recipe called for 2 whole cups of flour, only a half cup of milk, and no oil. My suspicions were right. These muffins came out dry and course. They were inedible. Awful! It ruined my evening.

This recipe does not rise up like the muffins you see in bakeries. It also calls for far too many berries. I will not make this again.

These didn't turn out well for me at all.  The batter seemed too thin and they didn't rise well.  The flavor was ok, but I wouldn't make them again.  I made them along with the Blueberry Cream Muffins for a side by side comparison and the Blueberry Cream Muffins were much better.

These are perfect! I now use this recipe as a base for any type of muffin. Our other favorites are:
Mexican Chocolate Muffins: replace 1/4 cup flour with cocoa, add 3/4 tsp cinnamon and replace blueberries with 1 cup choc. chips.
Apple Cinnamon Muffins: Replace 1/2 cup flour with quick cooking oats, replace blueberries with 1 3/4 med. diced, tart apples + 1/4 cup applesauce, replace 1/2 c sugar with brown sugar, add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves.  Top with a simple strussel if desired.

I gave this recipe three stars for the following reasons.

The crown didn't pop like I like them.  May be due to my hot oven but I had the top brown quickly in the center of the oven.  They didn't hold together very well.  They were like McDonalds biscuits fine until you take a bite then they fall apart.  I did not use cups and the popped right out of the pan I did use criso.  I will keep searching for the best one.  With the flavor of these but pretty.  I did see some recommendations however the recipe as it is was only a 3.

I reduced the sugar slightly and we still thought these were way too sweet.  I would suggest 3/4 c sugar next time.  Also, my muffins didn't rise much above the top of the pan.  I like a higher crown on my muffins.  But, the texture of these were great.

11/24/07 Made this as part of a Thanksgiving bread basket, "These are awesome" was heard around the room. I didn't add the sugar to the top, but I am sure I will in the future. I am going to make these all the time. UPDATE Made these again, and yet again a crowd pleaser.

Oh my, these muffins are simply to die for!!  They are soooo good!  I had fresh blueberries that my little boy didn't eat, and I tried the recipe and what a surprise...wonderful tasting muffins.  They were so easy  to make.  I did decrease the sugar to 1 cup, and left the berries whole.  They reminded me of huckleberry muffins that my Mom made for me when I was little.  Will be making this wonderful treat again!  Thanks.

This is the BEST blueberry muffin recipe. We make it every week! We add frozen alaskan blueberries. Trying mashing 1/4 cup of the blueberries to give the muffin extra flavor. We also use powdered buttermilk so we always have the ingredients on hand. Thanks for this great recipe!

I'm not a huge blueberry fan but I thought these muffins were WONDERFUL! They were so soft and moist. They melt in your mouth. So good! I'm a fan of lots of different muffin textures, including the more "cakey" kind (which is how I'd describe these), I thought they were perfect. I made a second batch with chocolate chips in and they were gone twice as fast.

very good muffins. I added some lemon extract and increased the buttermilk a little, and they were soft and fragrant. I also used frozen berries and it worked well.

I made these by accident and am I glad that I did. I was going to make the most delicious Banana Crumb Muffins found elsewhere on Allrecipes because I had 3 overripe bananas but no brown sugar which is essential for that recipe, but I also had a pint of blueberries which needed using up. So I made these wonderful muffins. I didn't have any buttermilk in the fridge(who does?) so I used the old trick of adding a little vinegar(cider, of course) to the milk. Worked like a charm. Hubby thought they were the best he ever had. I thought so too. Didn't have any paper liners so I greased very well with margarine. Dug them out of the pan with 2 forks but they did come out in one piece. more or less. Would definitely make again. Oh, and I did go later to the store for brown sugar and made the banana crumb muffins.But that's another story

Well, I gotta tell ya...these are very tasty indeed, but hideous to look at! Please tell me where I went wrong! I doubled the recipe (maybe that's it!) because I wanted to share with my new neighbors to welcome them to the neighborhood. But, had I approached them with these...things...they would have surely ran from me AND the mutant muffins! I ended up sticking them in my freezer to torture my husband with later.
The recipe states baking time 30 minutes. I'm just lucky I checked them after 20 minutes or they would have burned to a crisp. Also, when I peeled the paper liners from them, chunks came out of the muffins where the blueberries stuck.
Seriously, this is a very good recipe. I will take responsibility for the blunders...this time (good luck to the rest of you!).
Concerning this particular recipe, a baker I obviously am not.

I just made these with some minor changes.  They are delicious!!
Everyone wanted higher muffins so I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup SELF-RISING FLOUR.  ELIMINATE the baking soda.  I used a 12 tin muffin baking pan and filled them just about 3/4 full since I didn't know exactly how high they would rise.  I'd say they rose about 1/2" above the tin top.  I may use all self-rising next time, or just fill 10 of the tins. I only used 1 cup of sugar because you get the sweetness of the berries.  Mine were fresh.  And I did mash some of them.   Sticking.....I sprayed Pam (or whatever you have) and flour the tins.  Only 1 other person did that and they came right out; no sticking at all.  I've never made muffins from "scratch".  I'll never use a package mix again!!

DEEEE-lish!  Even better the following day.  Very moist!  The perfect homemade muffin.  I followed the recipe to the letter except for the amount of sugar I sprinkled on top. I used a little less than 1 tbsp.  Next time I'll try a little lemon zest just because I love a hint of lemon (not that it needs it).

These muffins have great texture and not-too-sweet flavour.  I made 2 batches; first just as the recipe stated and then second with 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla.  The vanilla added a nice flavour.  The extra baking powder didn't do anything...they still had flat tops.  I also subbed 1/2 c milk, 1/2 tsp lemon juice for buttermilk, and they were fine.

My husband absolutely loved them.  He ate 4 within seconds of coming out of the oven.
I substituted 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tsp lemon juice for the buttermilk (didn't have any) and it didn't seem to make any difference.  Very moist muffins.  A classic to make for years!

I would recommend adding a 1/2 t of vannilla and 1/4 t of lemon flavoring, otherwise they are a bit on the bland side.

I also sprinkle sugar on top after removing from the oven, for a granulated sugar topping, otherwise the sugar melt into the muffin while baking.

The search is over as this recipe is the BEST.  I have made many others, including "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" which were good, but lacked "something".  The only change I made was reducing the sugar down 1/8 cup and using the topping from the "To Die for" muffins--because I had so much leftover from the recipe.  Other than that, no change necessary.  An extra bonus was using my not so sweet berries and having them taste delicious in this recipe!  Thank you.

i was skeptical just because of the mixing technique... usually the less you mix the better the texture...  and alternating the buttermilk and flour to the butter mixture might make it tough, but they turned out tender as could be.  as i have a terrible time leaving any recipe alone, i made some changes.  i used 3/4  cup of zylitol instead of sugar (look this product up if you never heard of it- its great!!!) and used sifted whole wheat flour - reducing the total amount by 1/4 cup.   and also i used unsweetened soymilk mixed w/ a t. of vinegar for the buttermilk.   and i forgot to crush some of the berries. and i did not sprinkle sugar on top.  but even w/ all the alterations- the muffins are fantastic!!!  i just finished my 3rd one.  im pregnant and had such a craving for blueberry muffins, and these turned out tender, and moist.  thanks for sharing!

I have tried numerous blueberry muffin recipies, but this one is the tops!  I didn't have butter milk, so used regular milk and they turned out great.  Definitely use paper liners as they don't fall out of the pan easily.  We will use this recipe every Sunday morning.  Thanks for making our weekends a little bit sweeter.

Great recipe!!!  I've gotten rave reviews, the muffins look great and taste even better.  I followed another reviewer's recamendation and used 2% milk instead of buttermilk, used frozen blueberries instead of fresh due to availibility and i didn't  sprinkle the tops with sugar although next time i will try it.  The muffins turned out moistand light, and the blueberries can be seen throughout (they didn't sink to the bottom).  I will definately be making these again.

We loved this recipe. This has become my go to for blueberry muffins as it makes light, fluffy cake-like muffins. Although we also like the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" on this site. I don't squish any of the blueberries and I reduce the blueberries to 1.5 cups. I always use fresh blueberries. (The muffins hold together better with the lesser amount of blueberries plus the muffins are full with berries at this amount.) I prefer turbanado sugar for the topping or use a streusal topping. I never have a muffin left when I make this recipe. Thanks for a great 5 star recipe.

I rarely review recipes but this one was so good I couldn't resist. I made this recipe exactly as written.  I did not add lemon or vanilla or anything else that would change the taste and then complain I didn't like the taste. These muffins were light and had just the right balance of sweet against the tartness of the blueberries.  I used fresh pick from Maine blueberries.  I'm not a very good baker but these were easy and soooo good that I will make them again & again. (PS I did make my own buttermilk using the proportions noted in another review here).

I have used this recipe a few times now, I LOVE it and so do my co-workers. Haven't changed a thing to the recipe and comes out great! I've done the sugar on top and done some without, it comes out nice both ways. (I also used cherries instead of blueberries...i don't have a food processor, so i used my blender and it turned out nice.)
Thank you AUNTLYNNIE!!

This is a great and easy recipe. I've made it a few times now...the first time exactly as stated and a couple alterations since. First, I highly recommend using the paper liners. Even though I used plenty of cooking spray and didn't overfill the tins (twice), the muffins still stuck. They came out easy as pie when I used the liners. Second, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and I liked the flavor and texture of the muffin better.

a good solid muffin recipe. Good texture/crumb & flavor. Not the best ever, but close. I recommend a topping of butter, flour & sugar to give more of that "bakery" look & feel if you like sugar/crumb toppings. Don't over bake, they dry out quickly. I baked both with & without liners, and as long as pan was well greased had no issues with sticking. I made large & minis, both turned out great. I used a combination of fresh, frozen & dried blueberries, and did not crush them- delicious! I will definitely make these again, but will also keep searching for the "ultimate" muffin recipe.

These are the Best of the Best by far!!  I've tried several different highly rated recipes and something was lacking in every one except this one.  These are a good as they get people!  I make them at least once a week and add a yummy cinnamon crumb topping before baking.  Delicious!!

Delicious! I didn't have fresh fruit so I subbed frozen blueberries and it turned out wonderful. I also added a couple chopped frozen strawberries to give it a sweeter, unique flavor. This recipe isn't too sweet, so the only thing I'd suggest is that if you like sweet, add just a tad bit more sugar!

Very good recipe. Made as is written, and I love the slightly crunchy topping the sprinkle of sugar creates. Boyfriend & his kids enjoyed too. Will use again with different berries to shake things up.

Very nice texture. Moist. Not too sweet. All flavours harmonious. It was GREAT as is but I LOVE blueberries and would even double the amount next time. But made exactly as directed they are amazing!!

I have never been moved to write an unfavorable review before...but this recipe ended up a true kitchen disaster! I don't know what I did wrong because I followed the instructions exactly! But my muffins overflowed while baking, made a mess in my (freshly cleaned!) oven, and nearly set off my smoke alarm. On top of that, they turned out flat! :(  Reader beware!

This wasn't the BEST blueberry muffin I ever had but still pretty good.  I didn't have quite a full pint of blueberries but didn't notice a lack of them in this recipe.

Followed recipe exactly.  Made 12 good sized muffins.  Very light and fluffy.  If I were to change anything, I would add a bit more sugar to the batter. But I will probably leave it the way it is because they are great.

This is a great recipe.  I have tried a few times to make bb muffins from scratch; only to be disappointed.  Not this time.  Delicious.  Will definitely make these again.  I did not have paper liners and did find them difficult to get out of the pan, but the flavor was worth it.  I used frozen blueberries, which tasted great in the recipe, but I forgot to mix them with the 1/4 cup flour before adding.  This may have contributed to my problems, but no matter -- these muffins are fabulous so will make this my standard recipe.  The sugar on top creates a yummy crunchy crust - I love to sprinkle sugar on tops of any muffins for this effect.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Excellent Muffins! The only thing I did different was using 1% milk because I didn't have buttermilk on hand and I also added vanilla extract just because I like it!!!! I love this recipe and will continue making it!!!!! :)

These muffins were good after making some adjustments.  I used half the sugar and next time I will cut the amount of  Blueberries in half. I used sugar crystals on top, that added a nice little crunch on the top.

Very, very good! I realized I didn't have buttermilk after I had started, but I just used lemon juice in milk to substitute for it. That seemed to work just fine. I didn't do the sugar topping because I like less sweet muffins, and that made it just perfect.

WOW!! These are awesome! I've made them twice in three days and both times my family ate them that night then for breakfast. After that there were no more. I used strawberries in them and it was pretty good. They were frozen and think it would have looked better if they had been fresh. My mom wants me to try them and adapt to lemon poppy seed next.

The best blueberry muffins I've ever made and I've tried many recipes.  I found the texture to be very pleasant and the taste is wonderful.  Only change made was sprinkling the top with cinammon sugar instead of plain sugar.

These muffins were incredible!  I will always use buttermilk in my blueberry muffins.  I didn't change a thing except for use a few more blueberries.  I had about a pint and a half.  I also put raw sugar on toptowards the end of the baking process.  Just a little.  You want to make these muffins.  Everyone will love you more for it. Trust me! ; )

Muffins tasted pretty good, but were more like cake and less like muffins.  They didn't rise at all, and the outside was a tough unless warmed.  I didn't sprinkle the sugar on top, and the sweetness was fine.  I also used a little less than 1 pint of blueberries.

These turned out great!  I will make again!  For those like me who don't usually keep buttermilk on hand, try powdered buttermilk!  Found in the baking isle of your grocery store. Stores in refrigerator for a long time and is available whenever you need it!

This is an awesome recipe.  If I could I would give it 4 1/2 starts, but it's not an option.  I didn't have cup-cake papers, so I greased, and lightly dusted the pans with flour.  The muffins totally sticked.  Next time I will have paper.  But they are quite moist, and tastey.  I personally used frozen blueberries.  2 cups worth, which is about a pints worth.  But I only thawed out 1/4 of a cup to mash, and add to the batter, and then added the rest of the blueberries still frozen.  Cake turned out fine, though I may add a little less blueberries next go.  However, they didn't make the cake fall or anything.  Baked up well, and kept its shape.  Just a LOT of blueberries for my taste.  Probably only reduce it to about 1 1/2 cups or so.  The recipe should be compatible with splenda, so I'm gunna try it with splenda next time.  I also didn't have buttermilk, and used what I had on hand (skim), and I substitued Canola oil for the butter, which I almost always do in my recipes, and it turned out great!  Definity a good base recipe for me to have.  Thanks so much.

These muffins are terrific, the best ones I've ever made. No contest. They are nice and sweet, with a light, cakey texture and a yummy tang from the buttermilk. Very, very good. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

These are the best blueberry muffins ever!  My whole family raves about them.  I used the plain yogurt that comes with cream on top in place of buttermilk, and it worked splendidly.

Fantastic recipe! I used bing cherries from a can, but with such a sweet batter next time I wil probably use pie cherries instead. 
I didnt have any buttermilk on hand, so I used the following substitution: 1 cup vanilla soymilk mixed with 1 3/4 tbsp cream of tarter set aside for 10 minutes then use the 1/2 cup as called for in the original recipe. (it was recommended to me to make 1 full cup for better consistency.
Also, as previous reviewers, used regular margarine and reduced the salt to 1/8 tsp.
YUMMY!!

Wonderful!  These were positively wonderful muffins.  I used 3/4 C. wheat flour, 1/4 cup wheat germ, and 1 C. All-purpose flour.  This recipe definately lived up to its reputation from the reviews!!  I made a batch today and my husband has already eaten most of it and requested more!

These were very good.  I doubled the batch and made them with half applesauce and half whole-wheat pastry flour.  I took them to a family campout and everyone liked them.  I sprinkled raw can sugar on top of the them instead of white sugar.  I didn't crush any of the blueberries either.  I would proabably make these again!

The taste of these muffins is excellent!  They were very easy to make (I didn't follow all of the steps to mixing the batter--I just threw them all in a bowl adding the blueberries last).  However, I did use salted butter because I didn't have any unsalted.  One change I would make is to put in fewer blueberries.  There were just too many and it overpowered the muffin.  Yummy muffins though!

EXCELLENT. I DO NOT EAT EGGS and so I substituted one heaping tablespoon of plain yoghurt for each egg.  Despite the substitution, the muffins turned out wonderful, although you may want to consider increasing the baking powder slightly if not using eggs. I used whole blueberrys and did not crush them. I was concerned about purple muffins. In addition, I forgot to sprinkle the sugar on top prior to baking, but it didn't matter. The muffins would have been somewhat sweeter is all.  Thank you to Lynn for posting such a wonderful recipie.

I consider myself a 'good cook'. Fifty years experience and lots of recipes over the years, but this was the first time muffins ever came up to my standards. I didn't mash the blueberries because I don't like purple muffins, but otherwise I used the recipe just as is. It was marvelous. Fluffy yellow cake that didn't fall apart and thick enough to keep the berries up just like the picture. This is a fine, fine recipe. Thank you.

Excellent. Update: I have been making these for 2 years now and I have found that if I use the flour cooking spray I don't have to use the paper cups - they come out fine.  Most of the time I am using frozen blueberries and use about 1 cup.

Absolutely delicious!  I've made them twice.  The first time I used a combination of fresh raspberries, blueberries and boysenberries. I did not have buttermilk on hand so I used 2% milk with vingear to sour.  Sprinkled tops with sugar.  My family thought they were perfect.  The 2nd time I experimented and used half Splenda and half Equal in place of the sugar and also used Craisins.  These were nice when they came out of the oven but became more dense as they cooled.  All in all, great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Yeah these muffins ROCKED!  I made them for my super picky little brother and he thought they were awesome.  They were gone by afternoon.  I made the little brown sugar/cinnamon mixture to sprinkle on top that someone else recommended and I think they really topped them well.

These muffins are great!! I used salted butter and left out the salt.  And used 2 percent milk.  Baked them for about 25 minutes and they are perfect.  My son says they are the best.  I used fresh blueberries from a friens.  Will only be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks Lynn.

easy to make, good flavor they were just a little on the heavy side, I think next time I will decrease the amount of blueberries that I used. You definatly need the paper liners or they will be tough to get out

Great taste and smelled wonderful while baking.  I had a hard time getting the muffins out of the pan even though I had generously sprayed the pan with oil.  They didn't puff up like I would have liked.

These are the best I've come across so far.  I don't use paper liners so you have to spray top and inside of pan and fill each one nearly to the top with batter.  Frozen berries worked well.  A big hit - will definitely make again.

These are very good, and easy to make. The family was very pleased with the results. Recipe makes 12 large, or 24 small muffins. (I opted for small, in an attempt to make them last a little longer. They vanished in a hurry!)

This recipe is excellent.  My whole family loved the muffins so much, I had to make another batch after only two days!  I had to substitute milk for butter milk and frozen blueberries for fresh ones, but they still tasted delicious.  They were a bit blue from all the juice that the frozen berries left once thawed, but that added to the fun.  Overall, very tasty and I'm sure to make them again!

Lots of flavor.  These are fool-proof.  I made these & left out the eggs by accident.  They turned out a little wrinkled, but the taste was all there.  They made it into my receipe collection!

Awesome muffins.  I used 2% milk (less fat) instead of buttermilk and frozen blueberries.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled the tops with Raw Sugar before baking.  Excellent.

Nothing could be easier and better!  Lots of plump blueberries.  I used frozen and kept the cup and a half frozen until ready to throw in the batter.  I also used the larger baker's sugar for the top of the muffins.  Thi8s put a nice brown crust on the top of the muffins.

Delish! I reduced the sugar to 1C, whipped the butter & sugar till lite & almost fluffy,  added vanilla & zest of a small lemon (must do!), baked 400 degrees 20 minutes. I did streusel as per other review... It was a bit much- I'll stick to sugar sprinkle next time. So yummy, lite & not too sweet.

I may have accidentally sent this review on another muffin, but let’s try again- these were absolutely delicious! I kade two batches- a blueberry wheat muffin (just subbed in half the flour as whole wheat and added a pinch cinnamon and vanilla) that was to die for! Then a cranberry bread that is for after dinner tonight that I’m dying waiting for! Yes, I just subbed in cranberries for blueberries, added lemon extracted and the zest and juice of a mandarin orange, it looks and smells like heaven and I can’t wait to try it!!! Thank you for the recipe, it really is a great base muffin

A lovely moist muffin, and very yummy! The only changes I made were keeping all the blueberries whole, and I greatly reduced the sugar sprinkled on top.  I only used about half a tablespoon - just enough to give them a bit of sweet on top.

I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, since I didn't have that on hand, and the muffins turned out delicious. I would definitely make them again!

Holy Moly!!!!! These are the best blueberry muffins I've ever had. I turned them into mini muffins and baked them for 20 min. They also popped right out of the greased pan. Wow!!!!

It's a good muffin, but it isn't so good that I'll get rid of my other muffin recipes and only use this one. If I have buttermilk on hand this will be the recipe I choose, otherwise I'll pick another recipe.

These turned out marvelously! My family devoured them all, immediately.  I didn't make any substitutions.  The only change I made is that I did not sprinkle sugar on top.  The outside was crisp and the inside moist and delicious.  I will definitely make these again!

I made these this morning.  They were so easy and baked up beautifully.  Just sweet enough.  I'll make them again and again.

I've made these so many times and everyone just loves them.  The only thing I do different is I add a little drizzle frosting.  I just couldn't help myself.

This made some pretty yummy muffins. I didn't have enough blueberries, so I put in raspberries to make up the difference. I subbed a half cup of milk soured with a half tablespoon of vinegar for the buttermilk. I wouldn't really say it makes huge muffins; they're a pretty normal size. 

Overall, though, they're pretty delicious and really easy to make.

Beware. I have made these twice following the directions just as they are written, and the flavor is good but something is off. They do not rise, instead they have kind of flattened out at the top both times. This shouldn't happen with a good muffin recipe.

I did substitute some of the regular flour for spelt flour. The muffins spread out on the top instead of rising, and were very difficult to get out of the muffin tin without falling apart. The flavor was just ok. They were overly crumbly and fell apart. They were also somewhat dry. I find this muffin recipe to be much more delicious. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/blueberry-oat-muffins/

I have made blueberry muffins with sour cream or yogurt and although a little skeptical about this recipe, I had some fresh blueberries and thought I'd give them a try based on reviews.
I made this recipe exactly as written but omitted the sugar topping.  This recipe is absolutely better than any other muffin recipe I have in my collection on this site.  I must admit too, using fresh berries as opposed to frozen (which I have used frequently) made a much better tasting muffin!  Use fresh berries whenever possible!  These muffins were bursting with fresh blueberry flavour.  OMG!

Blueberry muffins are my favorite and I'm always trying new recipes.  This one was delicious, extra thick batter, baked up nicely with a crispy and brown top.  I added grated orange zest for a zip of flavor but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I like sweet muffins so I don't have any complaints about them being too sweet as others have stated and neither did those that I shared them with.

I made this recipe using coconut oil for butter and coconut milk for the buttermilk. The coconut flavor does not come through and it is an excellent substitute for dairy! I also cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. These muffins were delicious! Thank you for an easy recipe. (:

These things were amazing!!  The only thing i added was about 1 teaspoon of Vanilla.  I then doubled the recipe in order to make extra large muffins. I also used large grain decorator sugar for the tops.  These things were hands down, the best muffins I have ever made.  and believe me, I have made many, many muffin in my lifetime:)  Also, ever good baker know sthat you never follow the exact time listed on the recipe,every oven is different adjust accordingly.  Wait unti they brown to your liking.

omMMMMMMMMM (like omg but ending in a long delicious mmmmmmm) I only used 1 cup of sugar and I used frozen blueberries and a bit of frozen mixed berries for sweetness instead of mashed (but the rest were fresh). It made a nice purple cupcake/muffin. It tastes delicious!! I also used sour milk instead of buttermilk!

Yum!  Best recipe I have found so far, and I think I can now quit looking. :-)  I did not have any buttermilk on hand, so made my own with milk and white vinegar, also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking instead of just sugar.  Whole family LOVED them!

These were delicious!  The batter is outstanding as is...and just as good after you cook them.  I followed a few of the other reviews and used sour cream instead of buttermilk (I had it on hand and didn't feel like making buttermilk)...I also added just a shot of vanilla.  I did have trouble getting the muffins out of the pans...but then again, I didn't use papers hoping that the cooking spray would be enough.  Otherwise, I will be making these many, many more times!

these muffins were amazing and super moist. I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and threw in some straberries with the blueberries just to mix things up. The muffins were not out of ther oven two hours before they were half gone.

The flavor of these were good, but I must have done something wrong.  My muffins didn't rise.  They were flat and ran over the edges of my muffin tins.  I have never made a muffin before that failed.

This is my "go to" recipe for blueberry muffins.  Works great at the high altitude in Colorado too.  I'm going to try them with chopped up strawberries today instead of the blueberries.  Update: We love them just as much using chopped strawberries instead of blueberries.  I'm going to try the recipe today using peaches and will probably add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to enhance the peach flavor.

Great recipes and super yummy muffins, 30 minutes was a little long, so I put them in for 20 and they were still a little crispy. Other then that, great!

giving 4 stars since I altered recipe -- cut sugar to 1 cup; cut butter in half; increased buttermilk to 1 cup; used 2 cups blueberries total and added 1 teaspoon vanilla ... yum. Be sure to fill muffin cups as much as possible.

Very good recipe. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup, and added 1/4 orange just. Also added 2 tsp. of orange zest in with the blueberries...it is an awesome addition. I'll be making these again! Loved the smashed blueberries.

I replaced the buttermilk with cream and a tablespoon of lemon juice just because that's what I had on hand. It may have been because of this alteration but they also only took 20 minutes to bake to the brown side of golden. There was also leftover batter so the whole batch was enough for 16 smallish muffins. Next time I think it would be fine to fill the cups to the top to make 12 because I did not have any of them sink. Man, oh man, they are delicious! I think these are the best blueberry muffins I have ever had. The outsides were a little crispy and brown and sweet and the inside was fluffy and light. I say that in the past tense because they are all gone!

This recipe turned out to be delicious! I substituted half of the white sugar with truvia and they turned out just fine. Some people thought the muffins were burnt because I dusted the tops with truvia and cinnamon. Also, my muffins were ready in 25 minutes, and the next time I make these I might add more than the suggested amount of blueberries.

My 2 year old daughter and I really loved these muffins, we just finished our last one and she's asking for more. I used regular milk instead of the buttermilk since that is what we had in the house and I used frozen blueberries without smashing any of them and I also used 3/4 of a cup of whole wheat flour to make them a little healthy. I really liked the sugar topping, it gave them a sweet crust on top but not too sweet like a strudel topping can be. I might add even more blueberries next time too since we really love blueberries. We will make these again... maybe later today even.

This is a favorite of my kids!  I've added flax seed for a healthier muffin and used half white sugar, half splenda.  Also try adding a little lemon flavoring or vanilla flavoring for added zest.

These are good, but not the best we've had.  We really like the sugar topping and the burst of blueberry flavor.  I used paper liners, so I had no problem with them sticking.  Mine were done in 23 minutes, so be sure to check on them before the 30 minutes.  Overall, we enjoyed these.

This recipe really is "the best of the best" - WOW! Absolutely delicious, and so easy. I'm forwarding it to my daughter so my grandsons, age 10, can make them. I LOVE the fact that it only makes 12 - there are only two of us, and just so much room in the freezer.  As for Renee's overflowing muffins, could she have forgotten the baking powder? I was concerned, as I filled the muffin cups, that it would be too much, but it worked out perfectly, a few quite tall, but none running over. And Tricia Jaegar's problem of the muffins sticking to the pan: the recipe says to spray the top of the muffin tin with non-stick coating, AND LINE WITH PAPER LINERS. (I do symathize with her, having it happen in a clean oven). Thanks for a great recipe, Lynn!

Very good - Can't quite give it 5 stars, as I'm looking for the very best of the best Blueberry Muffin recipe to give that to. I agree with 'nonsuchbaker' - these muffins are a bit too flat on top. Sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top with the sugar.

These turned out picture perfect and were quite tasty; though a little too sweet. I made the recipe exactly as called for except instead of using all butter I used half butter and half plain yogurt. I will definitely make them again but reduce the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 a cup.

These tasted great. The only modification I made was to omit the 2 T of white sugar because after using 1 1/4 cups of white sugar, I didn't see the need. Next time I would like to sub half the sugar for applesauce.

These were great.  Did not change a thing.  Doubled the recipe and ended up with 32 muffins.  I mixed these by hand and the blueberries stayed intact.  Used Michigan berries that were very juicy.  In my haste to sample a muffin after baking, discovered the paper liners don't come off easily.  Wait until the muffins are totally cool and the liners come right off.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! What a foolproof recipe... I woke up way too early this morning and decided to make muffins for the family; In my sleep deprived state I made more than one mistake, one of them really bad... I forgot the baking powder until I'd started filling muffin cups. I scraped it all back into the bowl, blueberries too, and added the BP and mixed it some more (Though I'd already overmixed it) My kitchenaid stand mixer did shred some of the blueberries on this mix, but after a minute of mixing I refilled the cups and baked as directed and they were still delicious. They rose, they were fluffy but not tough. I loved the flavor and my family did too. Great recipe.

Good in taste but horrible in presentation.  These muffins do not rise well.  I made them twice then switched recipes to the Jordan Marsh recipe.

Taste great, but like others have said, they had a flat top and were difficult to remove from tins.  Stuck to paper liners too.  In my opinion this recipe has too much butter - applesauce substituted for 1/2 the butter might be nice.  Taste is rich and sweet though.

THESE BLUEBERRY MUFFINS ARE FANTASTIC!!!I just made these blueberry muffins for my husband for a snack while he is practicing for the racing season.  I have tried other recipes and they never turned out the way I like them.   I did everything in the recipe that it called for except I grated some lemon  to the batter other then that I left it alone.  When they came out me and my daughter tried them and my daughter love them.  They are the best.  I will be sure to use this recipe from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

I have not complaints since that tasted SO GREAT.. I am going to try and substitute using some applesauce and cutting back on the sugar, they are very sweet.  My husband says NO, he likes them just the way they are.

These ARE the best of the best blueberry muffins!  And they aren't terribly fattening (6 weight watchers points each!) like most at coffee shops.  I followed most of the directions except that I just made the batter, then stirred the berries into it and poured it into muffin cups.  And I also didn't have any buttermilk, so I used a half cup of milk and one half tablespoon of lemon juice.  I have made these three times, and they've always turned out perfect.

Great Recipe!!! I also made some additions. The first time, I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract....add as much as you like for personal preference. The 2nd time, I didn't have white sugar, so I used 1/4c of honey to blend with the egg and butter and a little bit of brown sugar (which if you're diabetic you can omit) plus, I added some Real Lemon juice - about 2 tblsp.
In both cases, I used frozen blue berries, slightly thawed, which I believe allowed the muffins to remain moist and added 1/4 tsp of baking soda.

these muffins are REALLY good!  I did some substitutions just because as I started making them I realized I was out of some things.   I used frozen blueberries-coated them in flour, but didn't crush any-I was too lazy!  I also only had one egg, so I added some applesauce.  Otherwise I made as is.  They were fabulous!  BTW-my batter was not too thin and they rose up beautifully.  The sprinke of sugar on top of the muffin does really make a huge difference.  The only problem is-I am on a diet and this is not diet food and it is IMPOSSIBLE to eat just one!

We loved this recipe!  Like others, I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar.  I had enough batter that my 12 muffin tins were filled right to the top and ended up spreading out quite a lot as they cooked.  Regardless, they were delicious.  It was nice to have a recipe that actually called for lots of blueberries.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these muffins with my 4 year old and her friend and they loved them. For a kid size twist, I used mini cupcake wrappers and cut the recipe in half. It made about 18 mini muffins. They came out too cute. They really enjoyed making them and the recipe was super simple. I usually shy away from making muffins, however this recipe is a keeper. It's so nice to make your own fresh muffins, instead of buying those terrible tasting store ones. Thanks!

These muffins are absolutely delicious!  Light and fluffy and the flavors are clean enough so that you can taste the butter and blueberries - perfect.  I added a bit of cinnamon to the dough (1/2 tsp) and also a sprinkle to the sugar on top because blueberries and cinnamon are so nice together.  An excellent recipe.

This recipe is GREAT!! I only had half the blueberries so I crushed half and left the other half whole. I also used regular milk with a splash of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. My husband said that the muffins were the best I've ever made!!! I will make this again and again!

These were really good and I followed the recipe exactly. Not really sure why people alter the recipe then only leave 4 stars or less, because they didn't come out or taste that good! Hello! try leaving the recipe alone and see how it comes out! You may be surprised!

Lol... these turned out really good but I altered them a bit. Not because the recipe didn't sound good but because I suddenly felt creative while I was making them. Here's what I did: substituted 3/4c of the flour with whole wheat flour; used raspberries instead of blueberries, and topped each muffin with a dollop of cream cheese before they went into the oven. Delicious!

These muffins were such a hit in my Sunday School class, everyone loved them. They were easy and a great way to use my fresh berries. I did not use the sugar topping though, didn't miss it.

There's a lot of flavor in this recipe but I'm not sure I was crazy about the buttermilk. Maybe I'll try then again without it next time. Also didn't try sprinkling with sugar but they were still pretty good.

This was really good!  I only used about half the sugar and used vanilla soy milk instead of buttermilk (was kind of scared to see how it would turn out) and they were great.  The only thing is that I sprinkled the sugar on the muffins before baking and that made the tops hard, so I don't know if I should have waited till after they baked or what.

I have been searching for a good muffin recipes for a few weeks.  I knew I got it right with this one when my boyfriend said "get rid of all those other recipes, I want this one every time".  I left all the blueberries intact, but followed everything else to the letter.  SUPERB!

These are really good muffins. Moist, great taste, sweet, but not too sweet. Super easy to fix. I left all my berries whole. I liked that no other flavors were competing with the taste of the fresh blueberries like some recipes I've tried.

These were tasty, no doubt, but the work to taste ratio wasn't worth it.  We didn't even finish the the muffins - which never happens in this house.

Just made these and they are good.  Moist and sweet.  I have to admit that they don't knock my socks off or anything. I would use the coarse sugar on top of the muffins if you can get it because it gives it a crunchy sweetness that regular granulated sugar cannot.

Great tasting muffin, except it has way too much blueberries for our taste.  I did use some suggestions from other reviewers:  I added 1 tsp vanilla, added lemon zest, and I used reg butter and then a little less salt.  I also used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup milled flax seed, and 1 cup white flour instead of 2 cups white flour.  I would do all of that again.  I used tin foil cup liners - made 12 twelve muffins and baked them 25 minutes. My family made me promise to never make these again unless I used half the amount of blueberries, or replaced them with chocolate chips!  I think these were best the next day, and even two days later!  So the good news is, this is a great make ahead muffin!

A very good muffin! You have to use the buttermilk to get that nice fluffy texture though. These are very popular in our house! :) Will be making them again!

Easy recipe.  I followed it exactly and I'm happy with the results.  This recipe produces a basic blueberry muffin that is not too sweet.  You can definitely tell these are homemade because they don't have that greasy, oily taste that is common in storebought muffins.  I enjoyed eating mine warm with a little butter... butter makes everything better!  I baked mine for 20 mins and they came out perfectly golden. Recipe met my expectations, in the future I may add a brown sugar/cinnamon/streusel-type topping.

absolutely delectable, tender. Mixed gently w/ rubber spatula (after creaming butter, sugar), used 1 C sugar, used the really big muffin tin (6 muffins).  Perfect.  Just like the old Jordan Marsh muffins.

These are the best blueberry muffins I have ever made and believe me I have tried many recipes. The buttermilk in these taste so great. I made 8 jumbo muffins and smashed almost half of the blueberries. Got wonderful reviews from overnight guests. No need to search for a better blueberry muffin recipe.

Okay, I am sure these are wonderful when you do them as directed, and I plan on making them correctly. But here is what I did with what I had on hand, and the out come wasn't that bad... I used 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar. Instead of eggs (and this is only because  I found myself with out the ing) I used oil about 1/4 cup. Then by mistake I put in 1 tbsp of baking powder instead of 2 tsp. It was a hard night last night. But fortunatly they came out edible, only problem is you have to eat them with a fork. I'm debating on just slapping a scoop of icecream on it and calling it a blueberry icecream bowl.

These muffins are so good.  The sugar on top before baked just adds a little something special.  I forgot to add it when I made them over the weekend, they were still awesome, but I just love that extra crunch!  A great recipe that works well with raspberry and peaches too!  A definite keeper.

This was ok because it just had way too many blueberries for my taste.  The muffins were mushy due to all of the blueberries.  After filling in 12 muffin cups, I still had about half of the batter left.  Mixed up half of the ingredients (except blueberries) and added to the first batch of batter.  With more batter and less blueberries, a better muffins came out.  Thanks.

There is no way this could rate under 5 stars! I made 3 types of muffins today, and theese were BY FAR the very best!
 
 I used mixed berries, frozen that I thawed, and I didnt have buttermilk so I used the skim I had on hand... I also had no more flour after the first 2 batches of muffins, so I used cake flour. 
  
 I didnt have paper liners but i used the spray with flour in it, and once cooled some, they came out of the tin just wonderful! The berries inside were AWESOME!
 
 I could easily eat one of theese muffins for breakfast EVERYDAY. I will use this batter for other variations as well. Next time I might add less berries and some banana. The possibllities are endless! 
 Thank you for sharing your grandma's kick butt muffin recipe! This is by far the best I have had!

I had high expectaions for these muffins based on prior reviews.  They were not what I expected. The muffin was very buttery and cake-like as opposed to the tradional home made muffin.  They seemed more like a grocery store bakery muffin.  I still prefer good 'ol Betty Crocker from scratch.

the muffins came out great!  i followed everything on the recipe except i used i/2 cup of land o lakes margarine and i cut the salt down to about 1/8 tsp....they came out really good; the blueberries that i used were a little sour, but the muffins were still great.  i had no problem with them sticking.  i used paper cups and a non-stick pan and they fell right out.  i also only baked them for about 25 minutes.  this is a good blueberry muffin recipe!

I didn't have any white sugar, and had to use Golden Yellow for the recipe. I crushed a few blueberries, but even though there's no way I used a whole pint, there were plenty of berries. I added some vanilla (just 'cause I like vanilla), and even with the brown sugar, these were great. MOIST! which is very important to me for muffins/cakes.

These muffins were very light and tender.  My children loved them! Definately use paper liners; I had a hard time getting them out of the pan without them. I forgot to put the sugar on top and I think I would like that even better.

wOw! Really enjoyed these, the recipe is fantastic. I made only a minor change in the flavor. I added 1/4 teaspoon Lemon "Extract" (not lemon juice). A little goes a long way, but boy it added a little extra zing that goes well with these flavors! I also lined the muffin pan 1st with the liners, then I sprayed on the non stick coating and I topped the muffins with the 'Coarse' type sugar like the bakeries do! WONDERFUL!! Make them today!  :-)

Very easy and very tasty.  This was the first time I'd ever made muffins from scratch, and they turned out great.  Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't crush any of the blueberries and I added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the batter.

absolutely GREAT!  my guests & husband loved them.  the best part was the topping another reviewer recommended:  1/4 cup white sugar, 1 T butter & 2 T flour.  they made them even better.  next time i will only fill the muffin tins half full as 2/3 full resulted in overflowing (and kinda flat) muffins.  thank you, lynn!

delicious!!! very easy to make and I did a bit of substitution. Instead of buttermilk, I chose skim milk. The result turned out great, my cousins were begging for more!

Definitely the most delectable blueberry muffins I've ever made.  I used frozen blueberries and they turned out to be big, beautiful fluffy muffins.  Definitely a keeper!

Yummy recipe!  I halved the recipe, and it made 9 regular sized muffins.  As others suggested, I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla for a little extra flavor, and used frozen blueberries.

I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used frozen.  They worked great.  Mix the berries into the batter frozen - this prevents them from sinking to the bottom.  Very tasty!

Excellent muffins! Light and sweet! I took others advice and sprayed the paper liners and didn't have a problem with them sticking. I also added a bit more baking powder for a bigger top. I will make these often!

Tasted yummy--especially when fresh out of the oven.  A little dry, but good.  But I never use paper liners and these muffins wouldn't come out of my greased, non-stick pan.  I had to use a knife to get the bottoms out.

Delicious!  And easy too.  Blue Ribbon winner at our county fair.  After making them for family and friends and getting lots of compliments, I entered them in the fair, where they got 1st prize and a bonus too.   I do cut the sugar down to 1 cup and they are still plenty sweet.  I am fortunate to live in an area that has big, delicious blueberries.

It's not often that I have a recipe just not work for me, but this unfortunately was one of them.  The taste of the muffins were good, but the appearance was really lacking.  I don't like using muffin liners and have never had trouble with muffins sticking to a well greased pan like these did.  I should have read the reviews first, I guess, since I now see that others have reported similar troubles.  The texture really seemed to be somewhere between a muffin and a tender scone.  I'd be tempted to add a little flour and try to make more of a breakfast cookie with this recipe.  I'm still a fan of the Blueberry Cream Muffins here at this site.  Sprinkled with coarse or superfine sugar, they have the taste and appearance of good bakery muffins.

Thanks to other posts, I increased the blueberries, and I increased the baking powder by 1/2 t. and I sprayed my paper liners so the muffins did not stick--they came out easily.  I don't buy buttermilk, so I always substitute Saco (powdered) buttermilk blend which works great as a buttermilk equivalent and lasts a long time refrigerated. Even with added baking powder, the muffins did not rise as much as I would have liked, but they tasted great.

Very delicious muffins.  I made 24 mini muffins from this recipe.  They baked for 25 minutes.  Just a note - these don't rise much so you might want to fill the muffin cups to the brim.  Also, I topped them with sugar in the raw - very nice crunchy top!  The reason I gave them only 4 stars was because they didn't rise as much as I hoped and they were a little on the sweet side.  I think I am going to reduce the sugar next time.

Excellent.  I used margarine and 1% milk (instead of butter and buttermilk).  I also didn't have a mixer (mixed it by hand with a spoon ).  They still turned out great: i buttered my muffin pans (instead of using paper sheets), and the muffins came out easily and cleanly.  The sugar on top was a nice addition, as it made them crunchy, although spreading a bit of butter on top with 5or10 minutes left might do the same thing.  Mine were done after 25 minutes in the oven (5 minutes early).  The muffins were soft and tasty -- highly recommended.

This one is a tough call.

While the muffin has great flavor, full and rich, it is odd in how it bakes.  I followed the recipe except increasing the baking powder to 2 1/2 tsp.  I had loads of batter; too much for 12 muffins.  But these went flat once it hit the heat.  They did rise just a little.  Once remove from the pan, they didn't hold their shape, kinda slumped over.  The best part was that I had really huge blueberries, otherwise I have come across better recipes.

Awesome recipe-made it 3 times already and the kids complain they run out too quickly so this time I will double the recipe. Strange though, I do everything exactly per the recipe and always get 11 not 12-taste great though, very moist (I use frozen blueberries cause they are always available).

These were delicious!  I didn't have paper liners, so I generously greased and floured the muffin tin.  I figured the recipe was so much like a cake recipe that it would work, and it did.  I had no problem with sticking.  The muffins rose up nicely and were just like a bakery muffin.  Thanks!

These were very good!  I made them for my husband and son and even though I don't like blueberries, I enjoyed these muffins.  I used frozen and I had to increase the buttermilk (I used whipping cream) to at least 3/4 cup.  I substitued 1 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour and because the muffins were medium, they were done in 20 mins.  Delicious!!!

I'm a real blueberry muffin fan and I am here to tell you this is a great recipe. I picked blueberries last weekend so I used fresh off the tree blueberries and added a few extra, just for fun.  I like the fact that the batter is sweet, but not over-sweet.  The sugar on top is a nice addition.  I never use liners.  My muffins came out fine.  I use old muffin tins, used to be considered the larger size 30 years ago!  This recipe made 24 muffins for me.

Very good recipe. Muffins are even better the next day after cooling. Very easy to make too!

I was short on unsalted butter so I used half unsalted butter and half margerine.  The muffins were very good warm, but the next day they weren't the best.

Excellent! One of the best I've tried. They are my husbands favourite...so I have tried many recipes over the years. The muffins are easy to put together, bake up nice and large. The added sugar on top is a great ending...or beginning! Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful! I used frozen blueberries and an extra large muffin tin. This increased the baking time, but it was well worth the extra wait. Instead of fresh buttermilk, I substituted powdered buttermilk and it worked well. I will make these again

These are the best of the best of the best blueberry muffins I have ever eaten. They are SO good hot out of the oven or warmed up for breakfast the next day. They are relatively easy to make. My husband and I make them at least once a week. We cut the recipe in half since it’s just the two of us. It makes six, which is plenty.  ?????????? ????????????

Holy blueberry!  These are very good, but dare I say it, too many blueberries!  I will for sure make again but with 1/2 - 3/4 of the blueberries that it calls for.  
I also didn't have buttermilk, so just used the 1% milk I had in the fridge.  Tasted pretty good to me.  
Thanks for a yummy recipe.

I made this because I had extra buttermilk in the refrigerator.  Not worth buying buttermilk just for these muffins.

The batter was thinner and did not rises tall as my normal Jordan Marsh recipe.

I really like this recipe. I used frozen blueberries since it’s all I had. They turned out great nice round tops and taste great. I did omit the last sugar that you sprinkle on top. I find it unnecessary.

This muffin is amazing with a great taste due to the buttermilk. I used frozen blueberries and it made no difference to the outcome. The batter is very thick so I added a little more buttermilk to make it easier to fold in the blueberries and add the batter to the muffin tin. All good and my go to recipe from now on.

These muffins are amazing! The batter was so smooth and easy to work with. Smashing some of the blueberries made the flavor come out. I added a splash of vanilla to the batter as well.  It was so tasty! Licking the spoon a must when done.  Recipe has been saved and will definitely be used forever and passed on to my children!

These are good muffins , the next time I make I am going to put in a forth of a cup more of flour. I think they could be a little more firm. I also will only put in one cup of sugar. They are a little bit sweet for me. I got 18 muffins out of  this recipe,and I only baked them 20 minutes. They came out great.  CFC

Delicous!  They will taste the best if one muffin has more than five blueberries in it. Also, don't overfill the muffin cups, or they will dip in the center. Thank's for this great recipe.

I made this recipe with whole wheat stone ground flour. I substituted 3/4 cup honey for the sugar inside the muffins and then reduced the buttermilk to 1/3 of a cup to makeup for the liquid content of the honey. The small amount of sugar I sprinkled on top was organic unbleached sugar. They were fine, but I wouldn't call them "The Best of the Best." At least my changes made them somewhat healthier.

Moist and tasty muffin.  Batter is not too sweet, which I enjoyed.  I forgot the sugar dusting on top, surely that would have added sweetness.  But no mind, they were quite good!

I loved this recipe, it was so delicious. I did find that the tops didn't have much of a crust so I made a mixture of 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1 tablespoon room temperature butter. I mixed this up and sprinkled it on top of the muffin before baking.

These muffins turned out delicious. I kept the recipe the same except I didn’t put any sugar on the top. I felt they were sweet enough and didn’t require more sugar.  I cooked them in popover tins which let them cook through in 25 minutes because the shape of the baking tins makes the muffins tall and narrow. Next time I will add some cinnamon and lemon rind for extra flavour. The crumb on the muffins is just the kind I love in a muffin, not too cake like or too biscuit like. This recipe is a keeper for me.

Excellent recipe! Yummy!  Will make again.  I made a double batch using what I had on hand.  For the double recipe I added 2 tablespoons of dry buttermilk powder to the dry ingredients and used 1 cup of 2% milk with 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice added.  I used fresh blueberries, about 3 cups total.  Made the crumb topping of 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and 2 tablespoons softened butter which was suggested by another reviewer.  The batter filled 24 muffin tins full.  Nice big muffins!  Used paper muffin liners and sprayed the top of the muffin pans.

These are amazing! This made 16 muffins for me. Probably a smaller muffin pan. I didn’t have buttermilk so I soured the milk with 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar. I have a house of blueberry muffin lovers and they thought these were delicious.

I noticed that the recipe didn’t call for vanilla, and although they came out pretty good, I could taste the absence of vanilla.  I usually use a tsp of lemon extract but the vanilla usually reminds me.  Otherwise, they were pretty darn good.

I made half the recipe and got eight small ones, using a scant 1/4 c. of batter for each muffin cup. I left out the blueberries and added sweetened dried cherries, vanilla extract, and almond extract. These need a little more salt. They taste good but they aren't the moistest I've ever made. I made a glaze for mine too.

I thought these were delicious.  I added some lemon zest and a dollop of real lemon juice.  Filled the cups 3/4 full which made 18 muffins.  The only other thing I did was cut any large blueberries in half.  I did not mash any but I will try that the next time.

I love this recipe so much that I make it over and over. This is my go to recipe for blueberry muffins. The touch of sugar on the top before you bake them takes these muffins to another level. I especially love baking them with local hand picked blueberries, whenever they're available. I make sure to stock up on butter and milk whenever I bake these.

These were delicious but I didn’t bother with the topping. Mixing with an electric mixer seemed to make the batter lighter and fluffier. I didn’t have unsalted butter, so used the regular kind and left out the regular salt. It was fine.

Made it as is. Next time will add vanilla. As for buttermilk, I always have that on hand, but I have the dry mix. It is great. Stays in the frig. Lasts a long long time.

Baked these to celebrate my picking blueberries in the Texas heat.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla bc of a previous comment.  They didn't rise much; maybe bc I didn't fill the muffin cups to the top.

very good. Sweet and like cake more than muffins. Did take longer to make than my usual blueberry muffins but worth it as long as you have the time. I used frozen berries instead of fresh and pans oiled and floured instead of paper liners.  Worked fine

Wow these were really good! They had a beautiful, crispy top, with a soft, fruity inside. Very easy to make, and they came out tasting like something from a bakery! I added some oatmeal and cherries, which went well with the blueberries. I will definitively be making these again!

These were great! 2 changes I made--used frozen blueberries (did not thaw), used convection oven @350 for 30 minutes.  Made 4 colossal muffins!

30 min were way too much. Mine burned! 20 min would have been better!  Average size muffins, average filled. 375 degrees.

I do not know what I am doing wrong.  I have made this recipe two times and both times a total flop.  I will go back to my old recipe that never fails.  To me this seems more like a cupcake recipe than a muffin recipe.

The directions follow a typical cake recipe, not a muffin recipe.  I was worried the batter was over mixed but they came out great.  Never thought of mashing some of the berries - nice idea!  Mine tested done at 27 minutes.

Delicious muffins! Gave them a 4 and not a 5 only because I did make a few changes, based on reading the reviews. I added a bit of lemon zest, and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I kept all the blueberries whole. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the dusting. I didn't have buttermilk so used regular 2% milk with 1/2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice. I cooked at the temp and for time in recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Made 12 good size muffins. Will definitely be a repeat!

I made these the first time and they turned out great! I used fresh blueberries from the garden. The second time I made these I added too much milk. The batter was thin and once baked the muffins were sunken in the middle. So I made the muffins again, following the instructions exactly, and they came out perfect again. I baked over a dozen and took them to work. At thr end of thr day there was only one mufdin left. Very fluffy and flavorful! I used a sugar+stevia combo instead of pure white sugar and the muffins still tastes great. I love this recipe and I highy recommend this!

Gorgeous! This is now officially my favorite blueberry  muffin recipe. I followed it exactly, except that I did not sprinkle sugar on them towards the end.  The sweetness of the fresh blueberries, combined with the sugar in the batter is PERFECT. It really does not need a sugary crust.  They are light, fluffy, and rose and browned beautifully. They were in the oven for the full 30 minutes, and I didn't even check them with a toothpick. Also, no butter needed when you are ready to eat these :)

MAKE THESE TOMORROW!!   These are such good muffins, and if there is a way to mess them up, I haven't found it yet.  I live at very high altitude, and my oven is wonky with temperatures, but these always come out well.  the first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly, using frozen berries.  They didn't last long enough to get cold.  The second time, I added cinnamon to the batter and made a simple topping with flour, oatmeal, a bit of butter and sugar, and they were even better.   We have a very generous bakery near out house that is always sharing bread with us, and I took some to them.  They said they are the best.  Thank you for a great recipe.

With a couple of minor changes, these were some of the best blueberry muffins I have ever made, and I make alot of them! Increase salt to 1 tsp, increase buttermilk to 1 cup, add 1 tsp vanilla. Muffins turned out moist with a creamy flavor and texture.

This was a decent muffin but definitely missing something. Maybe some flavoring or even a streusel topping. It was rather bland. I've surely had better, however, if you're NOT a foodie this muffin will serve you just fine.

Pretty good blueberry muffins.  I reread the recipe a couple of times; no cinnamon and no vanilla?  I added both--vanilla to the mixture, cinnamon to the sugar topping.  Otherwise it's just a sugar topping with no added flavor.  I also subbed oil for margarine because I didn't have time to wait for butter to soften.  We liked the result, although my two year old wasn't too impressed; she kept taking a bite then putting them down.  This made 18 regular sized muffins plus about 4-5 mini muffins for me.  For some reason, I frequently end up with a lot more muffins than stated.  Almost every time.  Maybe my muffin tins are smaller than average.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these and they were the most delicious  muffins ever.  The only thing I changed was adding a tablespoon of mayonaise when creaming the butter.  I didn't add sugar on top.  I found it is sweet enough by itself.  Fantastic!

These are good, and simple enough to make thus the rating. The flavor is plain, nothing bad but just lacked a wow factor.

I made these just like the recipe said, they were very dense and not super moist like I'd hoped.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

Easy and yummy. My kids loved it. One tip: Don't be too stingy with the sugar sprinkled on top. It's the best part.

I have been making these for years. They really are the best as stated. I substitute the blueberries for whatever fruit I have on hand often, they taste good with strawberries, peaches, raspberries, etc. My favorite so far are cranberries. The tartness of the cranberries pairs well with the sweetness of the muffin. I bake for 20 mins.

Substituted buttermilk for 3/4 C of almond milk and added a tsp of vanilla extract. Also skipped the 1/4 cup of flower mixed with berries. Just mixed the whole lot at once. Beautiful muffins!

made them first thing on a Sunday morning.  I didn't have buttermilk, so used 1/2 & 1/2 with a little bit of vinegar in it.  Turned out really nice.  Nothing like warm from the oven blueberry muffins on a Sunday morning.

I made these last night to take to a breakfast potluck today. Everybody loved them and I got requests for the recipe.
The only things I did differently  were  cutting the sugar down to 1 cup and using only  1 1/2 cup of blueberries ( all I had). Because I didn't have enough berries I didn't crush any.
I loved the result and I plan to make them this way next time.  I might add little Vanilla as well.

Delicious, But.... Too much batter for twelve muffins! Everything was great beside  that, but the batter spilled over the top, making the tops fall off immediately. My BFF And I tinkered a bit with this recipe, adding about 1 cup more sugar than the recipe recommended. Make Batter for about 10 muffins if you want 12. -Angel Cake Club

I followed the recipe as directed and was really looking forward to these as I love blueberry muffins and finally had some amazing fresh blueberries to bake with this season--not too sweet, not too acidic. Just right. The muffins turned out nice and moist and had a nice texture, although maybe a bit on the denser side. They held together really well even when hot. However, they were simply too sweet for my taste and the taste wasn't very complex. Just sugary sweet. Not even the awesome blueberries were able to elevate them. Definitely edible but I won't be making this recipe again...it just seemed to be missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

Really good muffins. It made more batter than my muffin cups held so I tried to make mini-muffins too. This would have made 12 regular muffins and 12 mini-muffins. I did not line the mini-muffins pan and that was a mistake; definitely line the pan.

I did not have buttermilk so I used 1/2 Tbsp of white vinegar and milk.

I made these for Hubby who needs things with less sugar. I used 1 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup regular white sugar. I added about 1/2 lemon rind and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Just because I wanted those flavors in there. I also used fresh blueberries they were just fantastic.

This is a really good muffin recipe. The tops were slightly crunchy while the muffin itself was soft and moist. The only reason that I am giving it four stars is because the prep time was more like 25 - 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes, and they had to cook longer than recommended. I had to bake them for almost 40 minutes. Also, I didn't add the extra sugar that was to be sprinkled on top just before baking. I'm glad I didn't. I think that they would have ended up too sweet instead of just right.

I can bake just about anything, except muffins.  This recipe turned out to be the magic one for me.  First time I baked a muffin that didn't have the density of a cupcake.  I guess I was just over mixing the batter, but I think creaming the butter and sugar was the key.  Great recipe!

These are very good.  I followed someone else's advice and used only 1 cup of sugar....mistake.  It needs that extra amt. for a nice sweet flavor.  As most noted,  1 pint of berries is way too much for this recipe.  I think 1/2  the amt. works well.  I also baked them at 350 degrees for  20 min.  and they came out lovely.  Next time I will leave the sugar off the top since I don't think it  did much for taste or appearance.

These were okay. Not the best. Not everyone was really wowed by what I served them, family said they were alright to okay...little disappointed. Followed the recipe exactly to a T and the only thing that was off putting for myself was the buttermilk aftertaste. Sorry, will not make again.

So good!! Didn't want to make cupcakes, so I lined an 8x8 pan with parchment paper and baked 45 minutes. I have never tasted a homemade version that I want to devour in one sitting! I didn't  have buttermilk on hand, so I took a cup of milk and 4 1/2 tsp vinegar,  let it sit for 15 minutes and voila!

A very tasty blueberry muffin, and one that I would make again. I sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon-sugar mixture (only for ease, as I already had a shaker container with cinnamon-sugar in it), and I think the cinnamon was a nice addition on top. The one thing I do want to note is to fill the muffin papers only 2/3 full. I filled them about 3/4 full (got 16 muffins this way), and the tops kind of baked over onto the top of the muffin tin (which I can see now why the submitter says to spray the muffin tin with non-stick spray - even if using muffin papers).

This recipe is a must have. It's really yummy and easy to make. it makes one of the best batters I've made before.I made this for my husband and he loved it. I added about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. although I will really recommend this recipe, it did stick on to the muffin mold even though I greased it well.

Who doesn't like blueberry muffins. Mine did not crown well, maybe I should start the bake at 425. Lemon flavor would have taken it to another level, I used buttermilk. When I was younger we always had buttermilk on hand at the bakery, This is kind of a throwback to that era. I will use this again, its a better alternative than a mix and you can spin off of this.

These where great & the kids loved them. The only things I had to change was the cook time (my oven cooks a little hotter) and I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla (addicted to vanilla :D ). I only gave this recipe 4 stars because it wasn't the Best of the Best Blueberry muffins I ever had. I'm still searching for that NY Deli recipe I used to eat every morning on my way to work

The muffins, in general, was okay but I made a few changes. Instead of using the 250g (I used the metric system), I only used 200g of sugar. I didn't have buttermilk so I used the milk + vinegar substitute (which turned out fine). I also used blueberry paste instead of fresh blueberries (about 100g, I THINK). The batter turned out to be slightly lumpy and dry. So, I added about 2 tablespoons of milk to the batter. I didn't sprinkle the tops with sugar. 

The muffins turned out fine but slightly crusty after 30 minutes in the oven (but after being left in the container for a while, they moistened a bit). The taste was satisfying but I think a teaspoon of vanilla essence would give it a kick it needed. 

I also read a comment about mixing a 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoon flour and  1 tablespoon butter together to make a crumb on top. Definitely trying that out next time.

I will not make this recipe again.  First of all, it says to fill the muffin tin to the top, which yielded 9 muffins for the first batch and 8 for the 2nd.  They really rise so you can afford to not fill them so much.  The topping is way too much, I made 2 batches and still had a ton of leftover.  The muffins themselves are not very sweet or flavorful so I probably should have used more of the topping but these rose so much being so full that I'm not sure how that would have worked.  I will be searching for a different, better blueberry muffin recipe.

Kids loved them. A bit sugary and blueberry-y for me and likely why kids loved them.  I didn't sprinkle with sugar and they were still sweet. Beautifully baked though...perfectly browned and moist.

Hmm...  something wasn't right here.  Like some others, the muffins didn't rise, the tops just spread out and flattened and got a little too dark.  I tested my baking powder and it was good, so...  The flavor is good but there were too many blueberries.

I have a gluten allergy plus many other food allergies so I couldn't use milk nor eggs so I substituted gluten free flour plus 1 tsp of xantham gum for the regular flour; I used 1 mashed banana in place of the eggs and I mixed 1 tsp of vinegar with 1/2 cup of almond milk to make my own buttermilk substitution; I also used small muffin pans. I thought the recipe overall was really good;  it had more of a banana taste and was a little too sweet for me probably because of all my substitutions next time I will decrease the amount of sugar and add nuts but otherwise definitely will make again.

I had some expiring buttermilk from another recipe and I found these wonderful blueberry muffins. Delicious, to say the least. And bonus... had enough batter for almost 16 muffins! A few friends at work will be enjoying some.

I've made this recipe twice this week and my kids love them! They are nice and sweet, and the sugar on top makes a nice finish.  My batter was very thick both times, not runny as another reviewer said. I'd say it's thicker than what you get out of a mix.  The muffins are good sized and rounded nicely. I'll be making this recipe again and again - and I'm planning on trying it with different fruits too!

This was great! I added strawberries and blueberries to mine. Baking time and measurements spot on. Easy to make and didn't take long. Made my own buttermilk with lemon juice and 2% milk. They rose up nicely and looked awesome when done. Would highly recommend this recipe. All my friends are trying it now.

These muffins are pretty delicious! I tweaked it slightly and came up with a moist, flavourful blueberry muffin.
I used 1 c. all purpose flour and 3/4 c. cake flour, added orange zest, vanilla extract, pinch of cinnamon, and 1/3 c. blueberry yogurt to the mix.
Next time I will reduce the sugar as they were just a tad too sweet.
Definitely will make again!

Made these muffins today, they are excellent! I was afraid that the blueberries we're going to leak throughout the muffin because I used frozen blueberries, but it didn't! They turned out great. I underestimated the amount of blueberries though, so next time I will add more than asked for. Also, 30 minutes seemed too long, I took them out at 25 minutes and they were definitely done!

These were excellent!  I had about 3 cups of blueberries to use and these were absolutely perfect.  I like the idea of smashing some of the berries and leaving some whole.  The crispy sugar top is exactly perfect.  This will be my blueberry muffin recipe from now on!

These were the BEST blueberry muffins ever. All my oldest son could say the entire time he ate them was "wow, wow, wow" and my youngest kept saying "mmm, mmm, mmm"  Personally, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! This is my new go to muffin recipe!

I love these muffins and my family did too considering there are only a few left after our breakfast.  I decreased the sugar to 1 cup since my berries were sweet and I didn't mash up any of the berries since mine were frozen.  I only sprinkled the tops with 1 tbsp sugar.  I did add in vanilla extract and lemon extract as a personal preference.  These baked up tall and fluffy.  Thanks for my new favorite blueberry muffin recipe!

This is my go-to recipe for Blueberry Muffins. I use self rising flour and reduced baking powder to one tsp. Bake with fan forced 190 deg cel for 15-18 mins. Tried recommended 190 conventional oven bake for 30 mins, the muffin did not rise as beautifully.

Finally! I have been searching for a good blueberry muffin recipe and have finally found it! They came out moist and the texture and sweetness was just right for ME!  I've tried other recipes and they were too bland, dry or had a cornbread like texture. For now on, this is my "Go To" blueberry muffin recipe. This is definitely a keeper!

Lovely recipe! I reduced the sugar. Not sure by how much but i tasted the batter before i gradually added more sugar but definitely didn't put as much as per recipe. Probably 1/2 cup and a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added some lemon zest and a tsp of vanilla. I made the brown sugar streusel topping. Dredge the blueberries in flour.  Other than that, i followed the recipe as it is. They came out puuuuuurfect!  I think if i were to put in all the sugar plus the topping, it wld be waay to sweet. Thank you for sharing :)

I made this in a stone loaf pan instead of cupcake pan. Cooked it about 45 min and it was fantastic. The only thing I didn't have was buttermilk so I used 1/2 c. milk with 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice. I was not expecting this to taste so good. It was so easy to make. Oh, one other change, I used a little less blueberries and didn't crush any of them. Just mixed them with the flour and into the batter.  Makes a great blueberry loaf.

I agree with the First reviewer.  I have made both and the "to die for" weer more to my liking.  I was optimistic because of the butter, but it made the cooked muffins more crumbly and not hold together.

Best muffins I've tasted in a LONG time, but with a few awesome amendments.  I added the zest from two lemons and the juice from half a lemon.  I added 1/4 cup of plain whole milk yogurt.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, and I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  With those changes, seriously, these muffins were incredible.  Nice base recipe though!

This recipe was great! However, I did alter it simply because of the reviews. I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and added a tsp of vanilla and two tsps of cinnamon. This made it not too sweet, but had a nice, smooth flavour. This recipe was easy to alter and very simple to mix. The batter came out thick which made the muffin tops rise nicely. They were beautiful and delicious with a cup of chai tea. Definitely using this one again!

Great recipe.  I wish the tops would be a bit more rounded.  Also, the amount of granulated sugar to sprinkle on top the muffins was way too much.  I used 1 tablespoon for 2 dozen muffins.  I would recommend the larger rock sugar, as I call it, for the topping.  Overall a great recipe.  My taste testers all loved them.

These vanished. More cakey than muffiny texture, but sooo good! Might reduce the sugar a smidge next time, depending on how sweet the blueberries are.

I make these with only one exception, half the amount of sugar. They are amazing . My family loves them, i double a batch one a week when fresh blueberries are in season and have made them with frozen blueberries as well? I am trying them again today with whole wheat flour, half the sugar but using brown sugar instead of white sugar and with coconut almond milk ... I'll let you know as soon as they come out :)

I would say these were ok.  They came out nice and fluffy but weren't as moist as I would like them to be or expect them to be containing butter milk.  I also only had them in the oven for 27 min, I think 30 min would dry them out even more.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and still thought they were pretty sweet.  Even though I added vanilla, they came out pretty bland.  They also didn't rise very nice.  Don't think I'll make these again.

I thought they would be heavy for how thick the batter was.  I cut the sugar to a heaping 3/4 cup and added a few packets of stevia.  (I am trying to adapt recipes a bit at a time.) And, I was in a hurry since it took longer than I planned to mix them, so I skipped the sugar on top. Then they definitely were not overly sweet. My blueberries were frozen so I could not crush any up.  This made mixing in the last 1/4 cup almost impossible.  I would cut that amount back adding more of it to the batter and just enough to coat the berries.  I made 18 regular size muffins and baked them at 375 for 15 minutes.  Now I am wondering about substituting something for some of the butter without making them heavy.

These turned out very flat and unappealing. They didn't seem to have enough structure to have any kind of a rounded top or hold together.  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and added 2 T flour and 2 T buttermilk to compensate for the altitude.  Most of the time these adjustments work, but not his time.  The flavor was fine,but the appearance was a deal-breaker.

I made three different blueberry muffin recipes in one day to find the best recipe. This recipe was the 2nd favorite. I thought that it was too sweet. It had a good amount of blueberries compared to another recipe.I could taste the difference between the recipes that did not call for vanilla and the one that did. The one that did was our favorite! Also liked the recipes that had cinnamon in the topping better than this one that did not. Good recipe, just not our favorite.

Very good recipe, I only used 1 cup of sugar and i added 1-1/2 Tbsp of chia seeds for nutritional value. I also made them a bit smaller so my recipe made 2 dozen. They turned out fabulous!!

Absolutely delicious!  It's almost like cake.  I didn't even mash the blueberries to stir in the batter and they still came out delicious.  I made mini muffins and it took 15 minutes to bake.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, and extra blueberries.  I didn't smash up any blueberries for the recipe, mine were frozen when I put them in the batter.  They turned out great, very tasty.  I liked how the outside was crunchy when they cooled.  Nothing worse than a mushy muffin.

Good recipe.  I halved the recipe and made 6 regular muffins.  They only needed to be in the oven for 21 minutes.  I like my muffins a little on the sweet side, so, I next time I will ensure my blueberries are relatively sweet.

Did jumbo muffins- used oil and sour milk, vanilla and frozen blueberries and they came out really well. Maybe add a spark of lemon rind next time.

I love these muffins!  I added some lemons zest to the batter as I added the eggs and they were even better!  I made them this way and brought them to a bake sale and they were gone quick!  I've found these muffins are delicious even when using frozen (thawed) blueberries, obviously fresh are even better.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe handy.

These were great! My husband raved about them! Used frozen wild blueberries and didn't use paper liners and they came out fine. Added 1.5 t cinnamon and 1 t. vanilla. Next time will reduce sugar by 1/4 c. and try doubling. YUM!

These were delicious, almost more like dessert than a muffin!  Added 1 tsp vanilla.  Might consider reducing sugar as they were very sweet.  Overall, very good muffins.  Will make again.

These were excellent but I thought the topping made them a bit too sweet for me. I also made the mistake of thinking I needed to use all of the topping so my cupcakes did not rise. The next time, I will use less sugar in the topping and then sprinkle a small amount on them. Otherwise they were great! And I used frozen because thats all I had on hand.

I love these muffins and have made them a few times now, and they are great as is.  But I have also made them once with about 1 tsp of lemon zest and another time with 1/2 tsp of lavender.  They are great however you make them.

Very good!  I used large white sugar crystals on top instead of regular granulated sugar.  This gave the muffins a slight sweet crunch on the top.  (Similar to struesel)  My kids love them and I found them very easy to make.

Absolutely delicious :)  I had to make 'fake' buttermilk, as I had none on hand, but it didn't affect the flavour a bit.

I loved the flavor of these muffins! The tops turned out flatter than I'd like. Make sure you put plenty of non-stick spray on the tops of the muffin pans so they don't stick!

They came out beautifully!  I used almost all whole wheat flour.  I don't know if it was because of the change in flour or not, but mine were done in 25 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Added Vanilla, and used Raw sugar for the top, which adds texture to the muffin.

I used salted butter (1/3 cup), 3/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup buttermilk and 1/3 cup low fat vanilla yogurt (also omitted the sugar top).  Muffins rose nicely and are not sweet.  Would add some lemon zest next time for extra flavour.

Sorry, but I like my muffins a little "heartier," and these looked somewhat anemic coming out of the oven. Next time I'll try incorporating tried and true ingredients; replacing 3/4 of the white flour with whole wheat for baking, replacing the buttermilk with orange juice or pureed corn, and adding more blueberries. A nice topping is made by combining butter, flour, wheat germ and turibano raw sugar pearls (small pearl), topping the muffins and baking until browned and slightly crunchy.

The only problem I had was with my blueberries. My grandfather got some that weren't good and I didn't know so I used them and it made the whole muffin tasted pretty bad! But that was my own fault.

I dusted my blueberries with a little flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom, but I guess I should have used more flour on them. Most of them sunk creating a soggy blueberry bottom. use 1/2 the blueberries next time. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I think I will The sugar crust was really good, though!

Very good muffins!  Husband had to "test" three before he could give me the thumbs up, although I think his mind was made up after the first bite.  Followed recipe exactly except added 1 tsp vanilla, and did the vinegar in milk thing in place of actual buttermilk.  These were very moist, just the right amount of sweetness and a beautiful, fine texture.  They do remind me a bit of the old Jordan Marsh Blueberry Muffins we used to get, not exactly, but pretty close, and those were heaven in a muffin cup.  Only improvement would be to use fresh Maine blueberries when I get my hands on some this summer!  Even without them, this is one good recipe!

I used cinnamon and sugar on top.

So Good!  and came out picture perfect.  I preferred these so much more than the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins".  The sugar on top adds just the right amount of sweetness.   I followed the recipe, except added regular milk instead of buttermilk.  Came out perfect!

Oh my goodness, what a treat to have these muffins. We ran out of treats and I decided to make these after dinner. They are simple to make and delicious. Mine actually had a crispy crust around the top and are really soft and moist inside, so good. I actually doubled the batch and I didn't have buttermilk on hand so used just milk and that worked out just fine. I also used frozen blueberries, I put a paper towel on a plate and defrosted them in the microwave first. I will make these again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I was ready for these to blow my mind.  They were good, but not mind blowing.  Maybe I've just been fooled by fake blueberry muffins my whole life.  I was expecting them to be sweeter, but blueberries aren't exactly the sweetest berry, are they?  If you love them though, you'll probably love these muffins.

I had trouble creaming the butter and sugar together, sugar just kept flying everywhere. I ended up first using my pastery cutter to chop the butter up fine.  I made them in a small pan so I got 18 muffins, my husband gives them 5 stars he ate 12 in two days.

These are so yummy!!! I picked up blueberries at the store because they were on sale. Then I didn't know what to do with them so I looked at allrecipes.com.  I seen this recipe and I just had to try them. Boy are they yummy! I substituded the buttermilk for milk with lemon juice and let set for 30 min. I also used sugar in the raw on the top for a more crunchy topping!!!

Definitely the best of the best! I made a few adjustments...halved the sugar, added a bit of lemon extract, kept the berries(frozen) whole, and did not add sugar to the top. These muffins were perfect(I had to promise to make them again next weekend). Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

These muffins have a great taste and texture.  I gave it a 4 only because they did not have a top like I like to have.  I did make a couple changes that may have caused that.  First, I used applesauce instead of butter to cut down on the fat and eggbeaters for the same reason.  I also added a little cinnamon and did not put sugar on top.  
All-in-all a good muffin.

Wow, these are quite good - I was not sure what to expect as I don't tend to like white flour muffins and wasn't sure if they'd convert well to whole grain.

I ended up using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 "white" whole wheat and they came out VERY good.

I even used "flax eggs" instead of one of the real eggs as I only had one egg left.

They are very very yummy, the sugar on top makes it harden and be a bit sweet and crunchy on top.  My son and i are in love with these muffins.  :)

They were okay. I used Cake and Pastry flour and made sure to beat in a lot of air into the batter when I added the eggs.
Came out Light and fluffy, but really they didn't taste like anything special. 

I would not have labeled them "The Best of the Best" I would called them "Better than Decent Blueberry Muffins"

These muffins were easy to make and tasted fine but not what I was looking for. They were a cross between a muffin and and biscuit I thought and not real sweet. Certainly edible but not the muffin taste I was hoping for.

These were okay, but not exactly what I'm looking for in a blueberry muffin.  I'll keep looking, but they were good.

These muffins are quite sweet! Even more so than expected! I am no expert, but I think too much sugar sprinkled on top caused my muffins not to rise as much. I plan to use the rest as dessert muffins and my boyfriend loved them.

These are great. I've only made them with strawberries (used fresh) and they are delicious. I'm anxious to try the blueberries. Other than the fruit, did not change anything.

I needed a recipe to use up the leftover buttermilk I had in my fridge and these fit the bill nicely!  Used frozen blueberries (tossed w/ flour) w/ no problems at all!

These were great!  I have been looking for the perfect blueberry muffin recipe for a long time... and now my search has ended.  I thought at first they weren't that good - but once they had cooled they were absolutely delicous.  The whole family loved them and they were gone in minutes.

I followed the recipe true to form and no adjustments were needed.  I've been baking these muffins for over two years now and they have become our families "blueberry muffin" recipe to hand down from generation to generation.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

i agree these are a little like cake; but who cares, they're awesome. the simple sprinkling of sugar on the top is fantastic, since i always get boos from my boys about "strudel" toppings. u had to use a bit less blueberries, but next time i will use the recommended amount. i really suggest trying these. thanks for the recipe!

One of the best I've ever had!  I didn't have any buttermilk around so I used skim milk and it still came out perfect.  I will never need to buy the box mix!

Good muffins. Not "the best." I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla. Frozen berries that we picked and froze last summer. I just defrost slightly by running under cold water and stir in. Works great and tastes fresh. Oh I also added a little cinnamon with the sugar on top. I think I just like muffins made with oil better:) Thanks

Muffins had a flat top, blueberries sank to the bottom, and my family did not like these as much as the "To Die for" recipe.

Just so-so. The blueberries sunk to the bottom, even after coating with flour per recipe directions. They did not have the 'peak" other muffins have. Thanks anyway, but won't make again.

the name says it all, the best!  i tried it using thawed blueberries once but i definately wont do that again, the berries got too tough.  the buttermilk gives it the perfect touch and they always come out extremely moist, even a few days afterward (if theyll last that long).

My first blueberry muffins. We loved them. I mixed up weight meassurements with liquid ones and accidently put whole 16 oz bag of frozen blueberries, but they still turn out wonderful, full of tasty berries...:-)

This was very easy to make..The flavor was ok..I was expecting much more..I have to agree with the others, they have the taste of store bought muffing..I also found that when the topping got hart, it made the muffin crumble..I am not sure if I would make these again..

I was looking for a recipe for raspberry muffins, but didn't find a good one, so I tried this one, used then instead of blueberries and the muffins turned out really well, the best batch I've ever made! I will definitely try it with blueberries as well. Thanks for the great recipe, it definitely a keeper!

Just tried this recipe this morning and they are just as everyone else has said FABULOUS! I only added one thing and that was vanilla just a tsp and they were great!! You gotta try this! I am planning to try a brownsugar strusel topping next time I am sure they will be even better! Thank you for the recipe!

It just great. It was absolutely delicious. But now i kinda want to make it healthier. So i was wondering how much yogurt and baking powder would you use to substitute the eggs with?

These were delicious. I only had salted butter and skim milk so I only added a pinch of salt and they turned out great. I will definately make these again.

My family loved these muffins. I made some with the sugar on top and some without and they are great either way. I didn't have any buttermilk so I made my own (milk and lemon juice) and they were still delicious. Definitely will make again.

Very good!  I added a splash of vanilla and a few dashes of cinnamon but other than that I followed it to a T!  I even crushed the blueberries, and for all of those who were worried about it making the muffins purple, it didn't.

The first batch I made, the tops were real brown. It might be my oven! The second batch, I watched closely, to make sure I wouldn't over cook them. They were soooo good! I'm definetely going to make these again, now that I've figured out how long they cook in my oven! My hubby and Mothernlaw loved them also! I took advice from other reviewers and put the blueberry's in whole. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These muffins are so delicious! My husband gave one to each of his golf buddies, and one guy said that the only thing missing was...another one! Just like some readers I didn't crush the bluberries, and I used my own streusel topping. Yum.

Soooo good!!!  Added the vanilla, didn't crush the berries, and instead of white sugar sprinkled on the top, used brown sugar.  Ate 3 of them as soon as they came out of the oven:)

This is a great muffin recipe.  I used frozen mixed berries(blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.)  Added sugar to the top while still hot from oven.  These would be good for chocolate chip muffins, too.  Yummmy!

I have found my new "comfort" food!!!  These didn't rise as much as I had hoped, but they are ooooohhhhh so good!  I left the blueberries whole and added a touch of vanilla.  Using a regular-sized muffin tin I got 15 muffins out of the batch.  I will definitely be making this again!

These are the best in the world!  They are fluffy and taste amazing.  The sugar on top makes it even better.  I used turbano sugar on top and frozen blueberries with no problem. I didn't crush the berries like the recipe said - I didn't think it was necessary.  This is now my favorite blueberry muffin recipe.  Mmm...

These are excellent, but definitely add some vanilla to the batter. These muffins are light and fluffy, not a dense muffin. I didn't top with the sugar but instead used a streusel topping because that is what we like, but I'm sure they would be great with a crusty, sugary top too.

These muffins were delicious, although I must admit i omitted the streusel topping to save calories. One word of advice - grease muffins VERY WELL because otherwise your muffins WILL stick.

A moist and delicious blueberry muffin. It is very sugary, however - I usually like my blueberry muffins a little tart, and with a side of apricot butter. I added a hint of lemon zest as well to the muffins, which really enhanced the flavor (I think) of the buttermilk and the berries.

I tried these last night and they were superb. I didn't have buttermilk so I used skim milk instead. I used frozen blueberries also. I followed the recommendation to use the topping from Blueberry muffins to die for, I think was the name of it andit was delicious. We can't stop eating them, thank you!!

This recipe was great.  However, I didn't have any buttermilk and I didn't want to run to the store; so instead I blended up a half cup of silken tofu until it was milky.  I also used splenda instead of white sugar, and put some splenda on top of the muffins before they baked.  They turned out wonderful, you couldn't taste the tofu at all.  The whole family loved them even after I told them it had tofu in it!  Great way to get some protein without the taste!!

Good muffins...be sure to use the liners!  I greased the tin, and they still stuck.  I also added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar for the topping.  They turned out pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great - I used vanilla extract and went heavy on the blueberries- frozen berries which were fine. Didn't crush them either. Muffins great "strait" like cupcakes, but also how I like them- toasted with butter.

My family loved this!  These were so moist and chewy, and the flavor was really good.  I did substitute frozen blueberries for fresh, because they were easier and less expensive to get, but they turned out great!  A real treat for my kids before school, and my husband before he heads off to work at zero dark thirty (military expression, lol)

I think this recipe is an excellent recipe. It doesn't have to many blueberry and the muffins are soft and fluffy. The only downfall for me would be it is a little to sweet, next time i'll put 1/4 cup less sugar. Other than that i will be using the recipe again and again. Thanks a lot.

These were very good muffins.  I used fresh wild blueberries that my daughter and I had picked that day.  Mine rose very well and had nice "tops" on them.  I actually thought they could be just a little sweeter but all in all they were very good.

I was a little disappointed in these muffins.  Though they came out looking beautiful (they were very plump and the fresh blueberries really enhanced their appearance), I felt that they were lacking sweetness and a little moistness as well.  My boyfriend seemed to like them....so maybe it's just me.

The best, as the name says.  I forgot the sugar on top and sprinkled some on when they came out of the oven.  They were still the best.  I love a recipe when I feel like it's restaurant-, or bakery-quality!  I'm making them 2 weeks in a row.

I hate to give this a bad review after all the good ones. Maybe it was just my bakign powder, But my biscuits did fine the other day,so Im doubting it was that. This went flat at the top and spread out. They were better when they were cold, but at first, hard to take out of the papers (lost quite a bit of the muffin to the paper). I was a bit frustrated since I made these for Father's Day for my dh. He was sweet and ate some up anyway :) The batter tasted good, but the muffin results really was upsetting...

It is a very good formula... but , I would say that it is more a very good cake (it looks like a cake) than a real muffin.

Very yummy muffins!  The texture is cake-like and great with blueberries spread evenly throughout.  I didn't bother with any topping although next time will try the streusel topping as suggested.  Just make sure you fill the muffin tins up very full.  I was slightly disappointed they didn't rise up enough to my liking (I like a nice domed "cap"), even though I filled them to the top.  Maybe my ingredients were off?  I'd really like to try this with the big muffin tins to see what happens.

These were pretty good, not really outstanding.  I should have made them larger!!  And I used turbinado sugar, that added a nice touch.  Next time, I will make jumbo muffins, and I think they will be better.

My blueberries were not very sweet so I will increase the sugar next time. I also sprayed the outer edges of each muffin area before filling to avoid the muffin top from sticking to tray. Even though I filled batter to the edge of the paper liner, I ended up with 19 regular sized muffins and the tops were not as nicely domed as I would have like them to be.  The crispy top looked & tasted great! Overall, a good muffin!!

These didn't turn out so good for me.  They tasted ok, but they were pretty flat.  Maybe I forgot something...  Maybe I will try again sometime.

My family really liked these. Sweet, but not too sweet, and moist. I did have to sub milk and lemon juice for buttermilk like other reviewers stated. Thank you for the recipe.

PERFECT! These are the most wonderful blueberry muffins in the world! I used non-fat milk instead of buttermilk and they came out fine! Very moist and cake-like. Thank you Lynn, I have found the perfect blueberry muffin recipe!
