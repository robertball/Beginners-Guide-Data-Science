Yummy! This is such an easy, inexpensive, and tasty recipe.  I added some sliced kielbasa but don't think it was necessary.  I also sprinkled the top layer with parsley for color and pepper.  I really liked the seasoning salt flavor!  The method for cooking the potatoes seems strangely complicated.  I just poked the potatoes with a fork, microwaved them for 15-20 minutes and then sliced them.  Leavin the skin on is not only easier, but retains the vitamins in the skins.  I used low fat sour cream and margarine and next time might try to sub chicken broth for half the margarine and use fat free sour cream.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!  *Update* I've made this many times since, I make the sauce with pureed cottage cheese instead of sour cream (add 2 t lemon juice), 3/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup light margarine.  A bit healthier and still delicious!

One of my favorite childhood hungarian dishes my parents used to make, and in turn I make often now! This is very close to the way we make it except I do: three layers of potatoes and two layers of eggs and then spoon the sour cream mixture over each egg layer. I cover the top potatoes with some reserved sour cream mixture and sprinkle with fine, dry buttered crumbs! Yummy. On occassion I put in some sliced sausage.

This is the first dish I ever made as a child growing up in Hungary.  I also use kielbasa in the layers.  I lightly salt each potato layer and then drizzle it with some of the butter and sourcream mixture.  Then pour the left over sauce on top.  This year it will be part of our Christmas morning breakfast.  I'll prep the night before and bake while we're opening presents.

Pretty good. It was a big hit at the potluck. I added red onion and worchester sauce for a kick. 
*Be sure and melt the sour cream with the butter. If you just add melted butter to the s. cream you'll get a very puffy topping that wont sink down into the dish much.

Our family dinners were not complete without this. Though we did it with a couple of variations. Butter instead of margarine. Always start and end with potatoes. And on top of egg layer and final potato layer place 5 or 6 pats of butter instead of adding to sour cream, Use  salt and lemon pepper and garlic salt on top of eggs and final layer of potatoes. Usually do two layers of eggs and three of potatoes. After layering is complete add condensed milk to sour cream until it is pourable, pour over casserole and bake at 350 until it is bubbling. Potatoes were cooked until a fork insterted could go all the way into the middle. Anyone who had tasted it loves it! Hopefully this is not a double post, I messed up the first time

I don't know about this being a lenten recipe--we made it for Fat Tuesday and because I used butter instead of margarine it came out really rich and good.  I liked it, but it's not the kind of thing you can make every day.  =)

This was my Mom's staple dish when I was growing up. It's super easy to make and you don't need any fancy ingredients. She used to make it with Hungarian sausage added in between the layers of potatoes, eggs, and sour cream. Where I live now it's hard for me to find Hungarian  sausage and I use regular polish or other spicy or cajun sausage to substitute or just leave it out like in this recipe.  It still works and my family loves it.

Delicious! The eggs and sour cream go great with the potatoes.  Approved by my very picky dh.  He said it exceeded his expectations!  I added a little pepper.  Next time I will try sauted onion in butter.  Thanks for a great dish Connie!

I am Hungarian and I used to make this dish quite often, in fact this is one of my favorite. Only couple of  things I would like to mention:

1. The original recipe is with sausage. You cut in circles the sausage and you put these as a layer as well. If you do this, no need for seasoning, as it will give a really nice taste to it.

2. I never heard of anybody doing it with margarine or butter. You just pour the cream on it, and mixed with the sausage it will give a very nice flavor. I found it that economizing with the cream doesn't pay off as it would end up dry, but I guess it depends on the taste as well.

3. This part is not "standard" but I used to put couple of slice of bacons on the bottom just for the more taste.

Rakot Krumpli - needs butter, butter, and more butter.  Also being Hungarian and growing up with this
very rich dish, we use butter not margarin.  When layering this dish I also add the sausage and a few pats of butter on top of each potato layer so you really get the sauce throughout the casserole.  Love it and agree with others that you can't make this very often.

I am Hungarian and I also make this although with less potatoes and I use butter (and much less than a cup) with the sour cream. Occasionally I also sprinkle some paprika on it as well. It's a great way to use up leftover baked potatoes. It's also great if you add sliced smoked sausage or even hot dogs.

We've made this several times now and it's very tasty!  We always leave out the butter (and it's not missed.)  It definitely turned out better when we used a sausage which purged its fat so that it mixed nicely with the sour cream on the bottom of the bowl.  Additionally, my Hungarian boyfriend seems to think it's VERY IMPORTANT that egg slices are covered with potato, otherwise they may become hard while they're in the oven.  Who am I to argue? :)

This was really good. Easy to make, hard to screw up! I fed it Christmas morning and everyone loved it. Delicious topping, soooo creamy. I had to cook mine a little longer because the pototoes were still a little hard.

I haven't had this for 20 years - I made the lazy quick bersion .  I opened a can of sliced new potatos and layers with eggs I sliced on the egg slicer.  I melted the butter in microwave, added and whipped in sour cream then returned to microwave with a handful of diced onions to add a bit of flavor.  Some cracked peper on top and I got to have grandmom's cooking in a short time.  I forgot to mention I made the 3/2 layer in a loaf pan and cut the recipe in half and it was nice.  I had some as soon as half hour had passed but grandmom let it set for a while so will have more in a bit

The flavor was great but there was too much butter/margarine and the potatoes were still hard. I would reduce the margarine (I used butter) and cook the potatoes for longer.

Good traditional hungarian flavor- would've done 5 stars but the sauce separates during baking (even when I used less butter). Next time I'll try some cornstarch & beat an egg in with the sauce... I diced a polish dog in for extra flavor. yum!!!

This was horrible! My own fault, because I should have known potatoes and eggs with sour cream poured on top can not be good, but I did not expect flavors to not go at all and the runny appearance. Nobody touched it! What a waste.

This is really good.  I use Season All for the salt between layers.  Also, I don't even use close to all the butter (about 1/8-1/4) because it is just way too much.  I have use yogurt cheese instead of real sour cream and it turned out great.

I doubled the recipe and made it for an office pot luck.  It was a smashing success.  I altered it based on some of the other comments:  used butter, instead of margarine; added sauteed chopped onion to each layer; added shredded colby jack cheese to each layer; and I served it with fresh, spicy salsa on the side.  It was divine.  It is a lot of work to make two pans, much peeling and slicing and layering, but it is absolutely worth it.

I agree, the potatoes were way too hard.  Next time, I will boil them until pretty soft first.  I loved the flavor and the combination though.

I thought this recipe was great to work off of! I sliced the potatoes first, boiled them until very soft, already had the eggs cooked and cooled, fried up some pre-cooked ham, then cooked a small bit of onion & garlic & added that to my pot of sour cream and butter that was warming. I layered 1/2 the potatoes, half the eggs, half the bite sized ham pieces, half the sour cream mixture, then a small amount of sprinkled bacon pieces (store bought), season salt & paprika, & shredded cheese, & did the exact same layer again (leaving out the top layer of cheese). Cooked it for a half hour, then shredded a small layer of cheese on that, cooked it for 5-10 mins more & it looked beautiful and tasted great! It was very filling so a small serving would have been better. Even hubby thought it was really good. This took quite a bit of time to make despite having my eggs & potatoes pre-cooked, but was well worth it!

I'm Hungarian and am always looking for ethnic dishes. I made this as a side for Easter and it was a big hit. I am going to make this again but will add bacon or ham and serve as a breakfast dish for brunch.

My hungarian family makes this and it's yummy. There are a few things we do different is use real buter, we tried to use margarine and it just wasn't as good. Also we end with the eggs and sprinkle with paprika of course.  No season salt in ours. Also try using heavy creme in place of sourcream. Both are yummy.

Wow, what a surprising dish. Its great to FINALLY make something good and my husband looks over at me with wide eyes. Yep, i cooked that! Ha. I did add one varience since i only had half of the amount of sour cream, i added cottage cheese and melted it down into the sauce. Yum. And i dont even like hardboiled eggs but i liked this dish a lot. Good recipe for beginning cooks like myself.

Awesome! Just the way my MIL makes it. I'm so happy I found this recipe. I made it last night and I have over half left. Turned out awesome. Takes very long to make but worth it. I did the recipe exact but peeled and slice the potatoes b4 hand and added them to the water b4 it boiled so they weren't hard. Also, added small pieces of cooked polish sausage to it. I think my MIL always added Hungarian sausage. Love! My husband said it tasted just like his mom's.

This is a great casserole side dish.  I used the buttery yukon gold potatoes and didn't peel them as I happen to like the skins.  The next time I will slice the potatoes very thin to make them as "soft" as possible without being mashed.  I'm also wondering if browning some ground beef and adding that in before baking would make a main dish casserole.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe was very good!  I halved the recipe and made it in a deep dish pie baker, cause this makes way too much for just hubby and me!  I added some sliced kielbasa, but think it would be much better with added onions or onion powder, pepper and maybe some sort of shredded cheese.  I will probably make again!

I was disappointed by this.  I felt like the ratio of eggs to potatoes was way too low.  I ended up only using half of the potatoes called for because they didn't all fit in the baking pan.  The sauce was okay but in general I felt this dish was way too rich.  And I'd suggest slicing the potatoes ahead of time and then cooking because slicing them when they're already cooked was more difficult and messy and they ended up not being tender enough after baking.  Too much work for not an incredibly tasty dish.

I don't usually like to change the recipes much, but I only used 1/3 cup margarine and added about 1/4 cup milk to thin the sauce a little. I also didn't use the egg yolks. My husband is on a heart healthy diet. I used a suggestion on this site and added some turkey bacon to a center layer. It turned out pretty well, but next time I may put some of the sauce into a center layer so it incorporates through the dish better.

unexpectedly DELICIOUS!
I've been making since i found this recipe
It's easy ,hassle free & turns out great even though when i first did it I was so in doubt!
But it turned out great.
What gave it a kick was a cup of ground beef(cooked with chopped onions, a minced garlic clove & a bit of salt & pepper)
And also added black pepper to the sourcream

It tastes good but it came out really dry.  I followed the instructions exactly but it seems as though it needs double the butter/sour cream mixture.  Not sure what happened?

Very good dish! I'm not very familiar with Hungarian meals, but this was quite good. For my personal taste, it was a bit heavy on the butter side, but good nonetheless.

This recipe is pretty time consuming, so I don't know how often I'll actually make it in the future.  I followed the directions for the most part & boiled the potatoes a little longer (about 22 minutes) as other reviewers had suggested.  But my husband still thought they were a wee bit hard, (I thought they were fine.) I also cut the margarine to 1/2 cup as well.  I added a little bacon to make it more of a main course meal, but my hubby thought it was more of a breakfast dish.  It was good, I liked it.

This is well worth the time it takes to prepare. I used redskins I had cooked the previous night, but any potatos will do. I also added onion and shredded cheddar cheese. I didn't have any breakfast meats in the house, so I added bacon bits. This casserole is rich, but oh so yummy. Try adding your own ingredients to make it your own unique casserole.

This needed a little more for me, bacon, cheese and onions would be a nice touch. Also, my potatoes had a hard time getting soft enough, maybe I did not boil them long enough?!?!  My husband loved it though, hard potatoes and all.

I love this! Everyone in my familyloves it. It's my favorite food. When I make it i use light Sour Cream, butter, and only egg whites. So its pretty "healthy". I love when you make the "lighter" version, you get the soupy stuff on the bottom. I love to dip rye bread in it.

I used an egg slicer to slice the eggs and the potatoes, I also added polish sausage, next time I will try the ham. We believe that you need a meat with dinner. This is a super great recipe. Every one loved it.

I added some turkey bacon to it and some cheese since my boyfriend is one of those guys who thinks a dish is inedible if it doesnt have any meat.  But it really tasted good.  He ended up loving it.

Surprisingly better tasting than I expected.  I put a little grated cojack cheese on top near the end of baking.  Also used much less butter.  I might make it again, but there are much better breakfast casseroles.  I was looking for something for a friend who is on a soft food meatless diet.  This fit the bill for her purpose.

This is quite good though really heavy (obviously, smile).  I actually prefer it at room temperature because then I can taste the tanginess of the sour cream more. Since I am veggie I did not try it with kielbasa, but some kind of spicy soy meat might spice it up a bit...I did add freshly ground pepper to the top which helped, but even more kick might be good.

This was one of the most bland and boring dishes I've ever had. I thought all the butter would make it tasty, I even added a few spices like garlic powder (just because I love garlic), but this dish just left me feeling un-fed and unimpressed.

I used margarine & light sour cream and it was a total flop. I was told not to try again with the full fat ingredients. I really wanted this to turn out and to like it. Use the full fat ingredients & give it the best chance possible.

This definitely has potential, but needs a little zip! Maybe some mustard?

I love this recipe, but I use butter instead of margarine. I also like to add paprika along with the season salt. In a pinch, plain yogurt works pretty well as a substitute for sour cream.

This was amazingly tasty!  It isn't difficult to make, but there are a lot of steps.  I don't know how anybody could make it in the time allotted.  However, I added some fried onions and spinach to it.  My father-in-law took a second helping and complimented me on it.  Two things that never happen!!

Added shredded cheese on top. Also sprinkled chopped spinach in layers. Would cook potatoes a little longer. Make sure to use regular sour cream, light was too watery. Will try again.  Good for vegetarians.

2.12.17   I had a few mushrooms left in the fridge, so I sauteed them and added to the layers in this potato-egg dish.  Surprisingly tasty casserole considering how few ingredients there are, and the sour cream-margarine sauce tastes simply decadent.  As others reviewers have noted, easily you could turn this into a main course by adding sliced sausage, Canadian bacon, topping with crispy bacon, ham, etc.  This was a winner today for a lazy Sunday brunch with a Bloody Mary.

I'm Hungarian, and my Mom would make this and we devoured it. It's one of the few recipes that didn't get written down before cancer stole her away from us. She never used margarine, only a little bit of butter and she would add sausage as a layer too. I've been going though all the rukot krumpli recipes online, and this served as a good base to recreate my Mom's version. All the reviews helped too. Thank you for bringing back a wonderful memory of my Mom! FYI....it always tastes better the second day!  :-)

I thought it was great however... I added 2 t worchestershire sauce, 1 t mustard, 8 oz diced ham, a handful of chopped onions and a sprinkle of cheese. I thought it needed the extra oomph of flavor.  My one question is:  How does everyone else keep the sauce from separating after you put it in the oven?  I melted the butter and added the sour cream to it off the heat.  But once I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350, it was floating in butter.  Still tasted great but it was NOT an attractive dish.  My DH said this was his new favorite breakfast dish so I'll absolutely make it again, but I'd sure like to find out how to keep it looking creamy and delish, not oily.

This recipe sounded good for my son's girlfriend.  She is vegetarian and was coming for Thanksgiving.  With the eggs being the protein since she didn't eat the turkey.  It was a great hit and she took the recipe home and its a family tradition of both her family and ours now.

This is a staple in our house.  I will admit I was skeptical at first, but made this on a day with no other options.  Promptly made it again the following week.  We add Kielbasa sausage sliced in the layers, loosely follow the recipe depending on your taste.

We thought this was a very tasty side dish, easily capable of becoming a main dish with the addition of meat.  I scaled down this recipe by two-thirds for just the two of us, and we still have some left over.  Even though it's rich, you don't eat that much of it!  I was surprised at the few ingredients that led up to such a tasty dish!  Thanks!
