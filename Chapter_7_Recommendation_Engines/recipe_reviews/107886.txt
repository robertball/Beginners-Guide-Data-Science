These cookies taste OK but it is really difficult to bake them just enough so that they don't get really dark on the bottom if baked enough or are under baked if the bottoms are a nice color.  I tried lowering the temperature and cutting them more thinly than suggested which helped somewhat.  I will not bake these again.

This is a wonderful holiday cookie. Followed the recipe as posted and they came out perfect! Not to sweet. And my favorite part was when several if them came out with a perfect heart shape cherry. Thank you for this cookie!  It made so many with such little effort. Chill overnight for best results.
