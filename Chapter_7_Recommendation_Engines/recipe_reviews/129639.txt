i've been searching for nilla wafers everywhere, so i can follow the recipe to a t.  but to no avail, i used eggnog cookies.  i baked the crust at 350 for 15 minutes - just a preference - and double the layer of bananas since i used a 5 oz pudding (crust; chocolate; bananas; pudding; bananas; pudding; whip cream; crumbs).  i never knew banana cream pie could be so easy AND delicious.  i think next time, i'll make it easier by using store bought/ready made crust, tub frosting, pudding, and whip cream.  but then again, will the taste be as delicious?

My wife made this pie and it was delicious, "BUT" she used Hershey's chocolate semi-sweet as is called for but it was very hard after cooling

So tasty!  I used the ready-made Nilla Wafers crust.  Much easier than crushing all those cookies.  I also doubled the filling by using 2.5 cups of milk with both vanilla and banana pudding mix and folded in 1 cup Cool Whip as per the Nilla Wafers recipe.   I definitely should have preserved the bananas beforehand because it definitely didn't take long before they got brown.  Still delicious though.  This will be a staple dessert in my house!!!

This was very easy to make, but didn't turn out as good as I imagined it would.  I think the turn off was  the chocolate layer turned really hard after being in the fridge.

One of the best banana cream pies I have encountered.  My family and friends request this at every gathering or snack day.
