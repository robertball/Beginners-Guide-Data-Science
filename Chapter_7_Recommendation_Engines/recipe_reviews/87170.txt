I substituted regular sugar for baking Splenda, doubled the amount of blueberries, and cut the sugar in half used to sprinkle on the berries. It turned out excellent. If you double the berries, use a 9x13 pan or a deep dish.

This wasn't my favorite cobbler recipe for a number of reasons. As others mentioned, it was way too sweet, even after eliminating some of the sugar. I also agree that there seemed to be too much dough in proportion to the blueberries, and it took much longer to bake than the recipe suggested. Also, I thought the vanilla gave the blueberries an odd, almost artificial flavor--as though it was "blueberry-flavored cobbler" and not "blueberry cobbler."  I feel like a cobbler should really highlight the natural, tart taste of a fresh fruit, and this recipe, while it tasted okay, just didn't do that.

OMG!!! I have to say this was the best dessert ever! My kids gobbled it up! I only made a few changes. I doubled the fruit, and used a combo of fresh blueberries, strawberries and some frozen raspberries(i like more fruit in my cobbler). I added 4 tablespoons of flour to the fruit and left everything else just as is. It cooked for 30 min. or so and was heavenly! perfect combo of sweet and tart! I like the juice in it and use the topping to soak it up. YUM! I am making another one now using frozen fruit, lets see how that one turns out! Smells good so far!

This recipe goes right up there with my recipes from Paula Dean.  The only thing that would make it any better is a scoop of home-made vanilla ice cream but it's great without!  So as not to waste any butter, I added an extra tablespoon of butter to the blueberries and an extra one to the batter so I could use the whole stick of butter.  I also used Splenda and no one knows the difference.  It's a keeper!

This one is a definite keeper. It was the best cobbler I've ever made. It was like a cake married a blueberry pie. We have a family of 9 and I made three cobblers. Only one partial pan made it to day 2.

I used lemon juice instead of lemons and increased the flour to 1 tsp. I also believe there is a typo in the directions because I used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was certainly plenty.

A true 5 STAR recipe (without any variations needed!!!), except for maybe a longer cooking time.  I took mine out and then ended up having to put it back in the oven because the middle hadn't cooked enough.  It was yummy!  I will make this again!

I did not like this at all.  The topping was very cake like and tasted nothing like a cobbler topping should taste.  We also did not think that it tasted very good the next day.    Everyone else in the family gave it a 2 to 3 star rating.  I did follow the directions exactly and even used fresh blueberries.  Sorry but will keep looking.

This was excellent. I've tried so many cobbler recipes; this is by far the best I've cobbler I've made. Also, I'm not much of a blueberry cobbler person, but I changed my mind after this! I don't like my desserts too sweet either; so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and a few tablespoons more. It still came out delicious. Also, I didn't have a square pan so I just used a round baking pan. It came out delicious! I will definately make this again!

Really nice cobbler. Vanilla ice cream is a must with this. This cobbler lasted for about an hour before it was eaten up.

This recipe is good, but I don't think it's a "traditional" cobbler.  The topping of a cobbler is usually not sweet and more like a biscuit, this one was sweet.  Regardless, it was really good.  I did add more blueberries and added some cornstarch (about 1 1/2 Tbsp) and some cinnamon to the blueberries before adding the topping (omitted the 1/2 teaspoon flour) .  The end result was great!

I'm gonna jump on the bandwagon and say this was not my idea of a cobbler. It was much too sweet, and the fluffy cake-like topping didn't have the crumbly texture that makes cobblers so tasty. If you really want to use this recipe, cut the sugar in the berries to about 1/3 cup, and reduce the sugar in the crust to 1 tablespoon, and reduce the baking powder to 1 1/2 teaspoon. That will go a long way to making this a more "cobbler-like" cobbler.

This tasted great! but there is a couple things i would change. for one it was good but way to sweet, cut the recipe amount for sugar in half. and instead of 1 cup of milk use 1 1/4-1 1/2 a cup, and it wont be as cake like and thick. there than that everything was great!. so next time be sure to half the amount of sugar, and use a little extra milk. it will be perfect then! great recipe

I love this recipe...The only things I did different was I used 2 pints of fresh blueberries and cooked it in an Iron Skillet.  If you have one that's the way to go...I taste so much better and I baked it for 45 mins.

I am very impressed!  I doubled the recipe to use a 9 x 13 dish.  I was about out of vanilla, so I added some almond extract to compensate, used 1/2 cup less sugar, & put about a tbsp cinnamon over the berries, before I put on the topping.  I used all but about 1/2 cup of the crust mix, & cooked it 40 minutes.  It is absolutely delicious & we will be using it from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best desserts I have ever made!  My husband won't stop saying, "I can't believe how good that was!"!! I served it with Dream Whip and the next night I reheated each dish in the microwave for 20 seconds and it was as if I had just made it fresh! I didn't have a lemon, so I just added some lemon juice(1T). Awesome!! A nice easy dish for new cooks to succeed at the 1st time!!

It seems everybody that liked this recipe changed it. The cake batter overpowered the blueberries. There was too much baking powder 4 tsp  - gave a bitter taste, to the cake. Vanilla in blueberries not needed. Bake time was not long enough. My husband ate it, but he eats just about anything.

This simple recipe was a hit, however, the next time I make it, I'll probably cut the baking powder by half.  This is to make the crust "crustier" and less cake like...5 teaspoons is just too much!  Good luck & happy cobbling!

Very easy and hard to screw up!... Used a mixture of frozen blueberries and fresh cherries- I agree you could add a little more fruit- maybe a cup more or so- also the baking time was a little off- it took about 40 minutes to cook right through for me- the sugar mixture on top is a must!

This recipe needs "tweeking."  Although I liked it,  it was far too sweet.  If I make it again, I will double the amount of blueberries, flour, lemon and use the t tsp vanilla and 1 c sugar--maybe even less.  Otherwise, the cobbler was good.

Way too sweet.  Way too much baking powder. Needed to bake longer and ended up with a very hard top on it. I see others had some of these same results.  There are much better recipes.

Followed the directions exactly but I think maybe there is just too much dough. I had to cook for 50 minutes, not 25 so the top was pretty "crusty." I used frozen (not thawed) berries so maybe that was the problem. The recipe doesn't specify if you shoud thaw them. Went with my best guess since most of the time you don't thaw frozen berries. But it still was too much dough for my taste. But overall the taste was good. Be careful as other reviewers have mention the recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar but directions call for 1 cup. I used 1/4 cup and that was plenty.

I love this! I've made it twice now and it gets rave reviews! Sometimes cobblers have just too much breading, but this one calls for enough berries so it's more proportionate. I make it exact to the recipe. Thanks for this winning dessert!!! One thing...I had to bake it for over 30 minutes....

Very good!  I did half the amount of sugar mixed with the blueberries (from 1 cup to 1/2 cup) and it was excellent!

I made this tonight and really liked it. I added a can of peaches as I didn't have enough blueberries. I agree with the person who said maybe it was too much vanilla. Also, there was way too much batter for topping. I think I put it on too thick trying to use it all, and after 35 minutes of cooking, the batter still wasn't cooked all the way through. I think I'll spread the batter a little thinner next time. But overall it was very good. I'll make it again.

I've made this three times now, both for family and friends.y   Because I love blueberries, I increased from 2.5 cups to 4 cups... outside of that change, it was outstanding.  I served it with vanilla ice cream the first time, and the second time I added a little almond extract to whipping cream to make an almond whipped cream.  In both cases, everyone at the table wanted seconds.

I took the basics of this recipe and tweaked it to make it a weight watchers friendly version. I used 1/2 oats & 1/2 flour. I used margarine instead of butter, almond milk instead of regular milk (only 'cuz I didn't have regular milk on hand) and used 2 packets of truvia sweetener for the filling, and 4 for the crust...that's it for sugar 6 packets of truvia sweetener. I also added a dash of orange extract into the filling....all I can say is OMG! It was SOOOOO good! BTW my version of the recipe yielded 4 good sized portions. Each portion was 6 points.

Very sweet. I only used 1/2 cup sugar and it was still too sweet. Also, I had to bake the cobbler for much longer than 25 minutes. However, this is a good cobbler recipe and I will make it again with adjustment.

Good cobbler, will likely make again. Only changes I made were to up berries to 4 cups and added a scant 1/4 cup tapioca for thickening.

I agree with most people that the sugar could be cut in half (maybe more).  Next time I make this, I'm going to elimate the cup of sugar poured over the blueberries or sprinkle them very lightly (I used half a cup this time and it was still way too sweet) and use 3 Tbsp. sugar in the batter (I used the full 6 Tbsp the recipe called for this time, which was too much).   I used a splenda sugar blend and whole wheat flour.  Also, the cooking time is way off.  It took closer to 40 minutes for the crust to firm up.

This is an excellent blueberry recipe. Wonderful.  I used our handkpicked, but frozen blueberries, so they were a little wetter. I used more flour to thicken it.  I did bake it for a total of 40 minutes, but I covered it with aluminum foil after 20 minutes because it was perfectly browned, but still not cooked through.  I also used Splenda plus a littel sugar and it was just perfect.  I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this Blueberry Cobbler the very best! Because it is really allergy freindly with no eggs or nuts. I used a Milled wheat flour, instead of the bleached, and it was light and fluffy cake over my blueberries. Make this 10 stars!!!!!!

Very Very good!  The only changes I made were put one heaping tablespoon full of flour in the blueberries, added about 1/2 c. more of the blueberries, and baked for 40 minutes.  This is delicious.

This is truly an awesome recipe, I did doctor the size though to fit a 13x9 pan instead...I simply added about 1/3 of every ingredient and it worked perfectly and came out great. I also had to add 5 additional minutes to the time...We loved it...:)

I just made this...Oh my stars, okay here's the deal. I used Bisquick instead of the flour baking powder and salt. I cut in almost a stick of cold butter, beat in cup of milk and sugar..I did follow the blueberry part and the sugar cinnamon on top. Let the milk flour mixture sit for 15 minutes.light fluffy,absolutely divine.I am a seasoned cook and this recipe is outstanding!

So I have used this recipe about 5 times. Each time, I prepared it a little differently. The first time, I substituted Splenda for sugar. I thought it tasted great... except for my sugar loving boyfriend who was able to taste the difference. I've used both frozen fruit and unfrozen fruit, and the results are pretty similar. I actually recommend using frozen fruit since it would save you some $$$. I've also cut the amount of sugar in half for the fruit and for the dough, but again... boyfriend wasn't very happy about that modification either. The cobbler is great with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on the side. The recipe says that it usually lasts about two days... but I don't think it lasts that long because the whole thing is gobbled up before I can stick it in the fridge. It's a great recipe! I'm not a great baker, and even I was able to master this one. One alteration to this recipe that I highly recommend is adding more fruit. Good luck.

I made some significant changes to this so I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5.  I needed a larger cobbler for a party so I used a 13x9 pan and doubled the amount of blueberries.  If you have good, in season blueberries, you won't need this much sugar.  I only used 1 cup sugar to 5 cups of blueberries and it was plenty sweet.  Also, you'll need to sprinkle more flour in if you don't want it soupy.  I used close to 2 Tbsp.  I also sprinkled in about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg.  I don't like my cobbler too "cakey" so I did not double the topping and it worked really well.  I just spooned it over, leaving some small gaps which gave it a nice look after baking.  Everyone loved it.

The cobbler tasted absolutely delicious. However, the cobbler took longer to cook than anticipated. I finally had to take it out of the oven after 40 minutes and we still had to eat around the middle which was still gooey. It probably would have been better if I had left in the oven longer.

Just about the very best I have had, even comparing it to a good restaurant! I baked it about 35 min.  Added an extra pat of butter to the berries and the crust.  The ingredients call for 1/2 cup sugar in the berries (which I did) but the directions say 1 cup of sugar.  I don't know why there is a discrepancy.  1/2 cup was just enough for us in the berries.
I too, used baking Splenda and it was absolutely delicious!  This is a keeper for me and Hubby loved it!

I made very little changes to this recipe. (None were needed - it's REALLY good!) Instead of adding cin. and sugar to the top, I used vanilla sugar.  
Give this one a try.  It's simple and a wonderful way to showcase blueberries.

I personally loved this recipe. The topping is "cake-like" like one reviewer said but that's just how my grandma made it. When I made it I really thought of her. Thank you FriendlyFood for the recipe. It was super yummy. :)

This was delicious! Blueberry cobbler is my boyfriend's favorite and he has tried many versions...his response "Great!".  The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 start is because, based on other reviews, I didn't use the vanilla. This is traditional cobbler so yes, the topping is cake/biscuit like. Agree with others, taste your fruit and cut back sugar if the fruit is really sweet. However, southern cobble is meant to be very sweet (think sweet tea!). I made it a second time with strawberries and only used a 1/2 cup of sugar.

This recipe had some serious problems for me.  I used frozen blueberries and the 1/2 teaspoon of flour which needs to be increased as the sauce was watery, not thickened at all.  I baked for the 25 minutes, tested and baked an additional 10 minutes.  When I went to serve it, the batter was still like raw dough at the bottom.

The only problem I found with this recipe is the amount of sugar it calls for. I only used 1/2 cup and still found it much too sweet for my taste. The consistency was perfect. Very easy to make. I, too, had to cook it for about 40-45 minutes to get a nice brown topping.

It was a hit with vanilla and mango icecream, doubled the recipe, used frozen blueberries and only used 1/4 of the sugar. The fruit was sweet enough. I will make this again! Thanks!

This was great but too much sugar! The fruits have sugar already so I would say only 1/2 cup of sugar, otherwise great!

The best blueberry cobbler ever! Recipe is easy, the biscuit top is moist and and the berries are sweet and have a slightly thickened juice. The cinnamon/sugar topping adds just the perfect finish too!

I too, added more butter just to use it up.  I also used real vanilla bean because I didn't have extract.  I added lots of cinnamon to the batter and a pinch of cloves.  We ate it hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream and it was to die for!  Thank you for the recipe.  It will most definitely be made again :)

I used 1/3 cup less sugar than what was called for and it was still way too sweet -- maybe my fresh blueberries were naturally extra-sweet?? nah, don't think so.

I have made this several times and it is absolutely amazing! It has become a house favorite; even my in-laws request it on holidays. One thing you should keep in mind while considering this recipe is that you can switch out the blueberries for other frozen berries. I like to combine blueberries and raspberries. No matter which fruit you choose, it always turns out great. Don't be afraid to use more than the recipe calls for. If you do decide to use more berries use a bigger pan. I love this recipe and I'm sure you will also!!!

Very good!  I subbed orange juice for the lemon since that's what I had.  I used frozen blueberries and it turned out perfect.  I did bake it for about 40 minutes and it taste delicious with a scoop of ice cream.  Thank you for this great recipe.  Quick and good!

This is an awesome receipe! The light cakey topping is wonderful over the delicious blueberries. It was a huge hit. I gave it 4 stars only because I reduced the sugar significantly. Too much sugar just masks the sweet blueberries.  Will make again and try other fruits.

This recipe is not very good, at least in this translation. WAAAY too much baking soda.  It sounded funny to me when I put it in, but, it actually comes through even after its cooked.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  However, if you have indigestion, the baking soda will definitely relieve your discomforts.

Outstanding. Don't skip the step of letting the batter stand. It produces a light scone type crust that adds just the right level of sweetness.  So does the dusting of cinnamon.  I will freeze some blueberries just so I can have a touch of summer this winter!

this cobbler was pretty good.  it definately needs some changes though.  as others have said, it needs more fruit.  double the ammount of fruit it calls for.  if you don't, you'll end up with cake on top of a itty bitty tiny bit of fruit and juice that will be soaked up by the topping.  the topping gets very puffy and heavy.  it's not light and fluffy, or even butter soaked crispy like other cobblers.  i don't mind that though.  you just need more fruit to even it out.  Also, as one other reviewer said, don't add the vanilla.  it adds a weird and definate distinct flavor.  the fruit can stand alone.  
i used splenda and it tasted fine.  if you are a sugar fiend, ( like i used to be) you'll be able to tell if you used splenda.  don't let anyone fool you into thinking that you can't tell.  even splenda, as good as it tastes, makes things taste different.  
with modifications, i'd make it again.

Holy cow this recipe is very sweet!!  Next time I make it I'm going to use a lot less sugar because with all of the sugar it takes away from the natural sweetness of the blueberries.  I like the concept of this cobbler and I will make again, with less sugar, of course.

This topping is so wonderful. I've used it with frozen blueberries and canned peaches. It serves well right side up and upside down as well.
Next I'm going to try it with canned pineapple. I'm very sure it is going to make a terrific pineapple upside down cake. Follow the directions exactly, and you cannot go wrong.

This is great Blueberry Cobbler.  The top is the best I've ever eaten, light and fluffy!  The berries underneath were sweet but not heavy, the perfect combination.  And it was very easy!

This recipe is delicious!!! I can never seem to get the top to totally cooked, but I think it tastes good a little doughy.  My whole family ate this up within minutes.  I will have to double the recipe next time.  This recipe is one of my all time favorites...

In the words of my son "this is amazing!"  I loved the cake like texture of the topping though I added extra sugar and cinnamon on top for extra crunchiness. It was very good.I served it warm with vanilla icecream. YUM! This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was perfect! It is a great recipe. A perfect, classic cobbler recipe.... not like something you'd get at a fast food restaurant. I used fresh blueberries and it worked perfectly. Maybe it doesn't work as well (as one reviewer indicated) with frozen ones? A perfect, homey treat and GREAT use for fresh blueberries.  A sure hit and "must keep" recipe.

My goodness, talk about being a HIT...  I made this for our Fathers day barbeque yesterday and tripled the recipe in order to make enough for about  20 people.  There were no leftovers, all of it gone.  It was soo good.  My first time making this but not the last and it was soo easy!!

I give this two stars because the blueberry part was okay as long as you double the bluebeberries (I used fresh ones). The topping is extremely disappointing. It has no flavor, and is not the crusty deliciousness you expect a cobbler to provide. I scraped off the topping and turned it into a dump cake (dry cake mix and butter) to salvage the dessert. Dont use the topping recipe if you're expecting your mom/grandmothers crusty sweet goodness.

Have to give this one star to rate my review but.......No stars for this one! Way too soupy.  Followed the recipe to a tee & after baking, tested with knife, came out clean and when came time to serve,2 hrs later it was a puddle of fruit juice & the bottom flour & sugar that was mixed with fruit was all doughy when cut into.

I used Splenda to flavor the berries instead of the 1 cup of sugar and it seemed to turn out just fine.  I was not a fan at how the cobbler tasted as a whole though.  I did not like the top layer at all.  It had an odd taste to it even when I used regular sugar instead of Splenda.

So many good reviews, I feel bad about giving it two stars!  I followed the recipe, EXCEPT I only added 1/2 c. sugar to the blueberries, and omitted the lemon juice and vanilla (quickly read some suggestions before making this).  The blueberry component was fine, but the cobbler was bleh.  I brought it to a fellow baker of mine to serve as a dessert, and neither of us cared for it at all.

This was a very good cobbler, with the exception that it was extremely runny.  Next time, I'll add considerably more flour.  Also, as others have noted, it took longer to bake than the recipe says.  I'll make it again, but I think I'll skip the vanilla.

I can't believe that no one has commented on using 4 teaspoons of baking powder!  I am an experienced baker and I should have followed my instinct and cut waaay back.  As it turned out the cobbler was not even edible.  I will not try this again.  A shame because it sounded so good.

I really liked this recipe. Simple as can be and very tasty. I don't care for cakey cobbler so I changed 1 c of milk to 1/2 cup (maybe a bit less) of ice water. Also I didn't use quite as much sugar in the blueberries, only about 1/4c. And I sub'd the lemon juice w/ V8 fruit/veg juice; and I sprinkled about a tbls of flour in as well. The cook time was right on. Perfecto!!

One of the best desserts I've ever tasted!  I cooked it much longer than the time suggested here, for the knife to come out clean, but it wasn't overcooked and turned out great!  We had it with vanilla ice cream, and that was a great choice.  Our son said that he is a blueberry cobbler monster, and we had to hide it from him or else he would have had a third helping.

I made this last night for about 14 girls and we all loved it. I will say that the baking time should be longer, I think I checked it after 25 minutes and then kept checking every 5 minutes and probably left it in for about 15 minutes longer than the instructed 20-25 minutes. But when it came out, boy was it worth the wait! We gobbled it up! I served it with Breyer's Natural Vanilla ice cream and it was a huge hit. After making it, I read the other reviews about there being too much sugar or too cake like, I am not so familiar with cobblers and this was the first one I ever made, so I thought the sugar and topping was just fine and since there was none left at the end of our dinner party, I'm guessing everyone else thought it was fine too!

We cook for about 200-250 homeless every Tuesday night and I make 2 pans 24"long by 12"wide by 8" deep. There is never enough. Our blueberries are free and when I learned to make this, by the second time I had the recipe memorized. Totally awesome recipe! Thanks a million!

This is the first blueberry cobbler that I have EVER liked! This is delicious and easy to make! I did add extra blueberries and about 3/4 c. sugar rather than the full cup. It also took about 45 minutes to bake. It was JUST PERFECT! Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I used Tammydachef's suggestion and doubled the blueberries and used 4 Tablespoons of flour.  Kept the sugar the same, though.  It was very good.  I also needed to cook longer, even using a 9x9.  35 minutes approx.

Great cobbler! Loved the cinnamon at the end, gave it an added touch.  Even my mother in law (who claims to be the blueberry cobbler genius) was a fan! Would be a 5 star recipe but I followed other reviews and decreased the amount of sugar.  I will also at least double the amount of blueberries next time, can never have too many berries!

I thought that 2 1/2 cups of berries wasn't enough, especially with 1 full cup of sugar, so I reduced the sugar and added a handful of frozen blackberries that I had. I'd say that the cobbler was ok. I think that it was still too sweet, and the topping didn't have a lot of flavor (I just realized that I forgot to add the cinnimon/sugar topping! lol). I omitted the vanilla, because I could see the point of another poster that it would affect the blueberry taste. I's make it again, but with minor adjustments.

I read both the good and the bad reviews on this and decided to try it anyway. I'd have to agree that the crust just doesn't cut it. I don't mind the cakey texture, but it just plain didn't taste good. Whole family felt the same.

Fantastic!  We LOVED the crust in particular.  My husband doesn't normally like blueberry cobblers or pies, but he ate it right up.  Also easy to the point of being foolproof - my oven is a bit off on temperature sometimes, but this recipe was nicely forgiving of that.  I too used Splenda no-cal, and I always mix a little bit of cinnamon in with the "sugar" when I do that to cut the saccharine aftertaste.  Also used non-fat buttermilk instead of the milk, which gave the crust a nice sort of zing.

The whole family really enjoyed this cobbler! I accidentally added the  cinnamon with the berries, and it turned out better then I expected!I thought it  would have been a little more moist,but my son, the pastry expert( He once said  a crust on a pie from a resturant,was the best he's ever had, I've never made him a pie with crust),thought the cobbler was perfect! Thank you for a wonderful dessert!Patty

I made this exactly as instructed. I have a high-end oven, calibrated to exact temps. I did not test the pastry exactly in the center, but slightly off-center. After sitting on the counter for 10 minutes, I cut a piece out, and the dough was not cooked through. The sides were, but the pastry is so thick, that it was like a biscuit. There was not much juice left, as it was soaked into the pastry. I will not be making this again.

Very tasty, but I ran into a few problems. For one thing, you must halve the sugar unless you want it reeeaaaally sweet. Also, I used frozen berries and I think that may have caused problems: the whole thing was too 'juicy' even though I added some cornstarch to the berry mixture; and the batter, while really tasty, never set properly in the middle, but got almost too brown on top. I had to bake it longer to get the batter to set at all, which is probably what made the top too brown. The batter just wouldn't cook evenly. Next time, I would use fresh berries for sure, or thaw the berries first and let excess juice run off. I think the proportion of batter to berries is just right, though -- most cobbler recipes I see do not have enough batter to really cover the fruit properly. This is very good. But if anyone else has suggestions about making it less runny and making the matter set properly, please let me know!

The TASTE was good . This calls for much too much crust and it isn't crumbly . I had to take it in and out of the oveb 5 times because the center was so doughey . By the time I was done the top  I will keep looking for a better recipe or cut the topping in half.

This was a hit with my guests, young and old alike!
I used freshly picked blueberries. I needed to feed 10 people, so I used a 9X13 baking dish and doubled the recipe, but the batter seemed to make way too much, so I only put 1/2 of it on top of the blueberries. Took 35 minutes and came out perfectly. Adjust the amount of sugar according to the sweetness/tartness of your berries and it will be just right. Served with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

This is perhaps one of the worse desserts I have ever had. It was almost not edible. The topping was like a soggy cake and not a cobbler at all. It was far too sweet, and tart. The vanilla gives it a chemically sweetened taste. The largest problem with this recipe though is the cooking time. It took about an hour to bake.

I just put this in the oven. While making it and pouring a cup of sugar over the blueberries, it did sound like too much. Therefore, I added in another cup of fresh blueberries and didn't add the sugar to the dough part or sprinkle it on top with the cinnamon. I hope it turns out good, I'd hate to waste my blueberries.

I gave it three stars because it was a recipe that used items I already have in my house which I love.

I made this tonight and it was super yummy. Since I'm very particular about what I eat, I substituted the flour with whole wheat flour and the milk with Almond milk. The recipe is awesome! It is really sweet, so you certainly can do 1/2 cup rather than 1 cup..but if you don't change anything, you won't be disappointed.

I used a frozen berry mix (strawberry, cherries, blueberries and blackberries) and it turned out awesome!!!! It smelled amazing baking and tasted even better eating.

The cobbler tasted fine...except 20-25 minutes was not near enough time for the top to fully cook.  It needs at least 30 minutes or more.  Mine had never browned at 25 minutes, so I took it out and checked.  It was still runny inside.  I finally took it out after 40 minutes.  It had a great taste, but I did leave out the lemon.

I just made your "Very Best Blueberry Cobbler" and my family thought it was wonderful.  I did cut back on the sugar just a bit...we are not sugar fanatics but the sweetness of the blueberry carried it through.  Kudos on such a fantastic dessert.

My family loves this recipe.  I added extra milk to make a runnier batter and it made a great cobbler!  It is the most requested dessert for my family in the summer and disappears quickly.

First time using this recipe.  Based on the reviews, doubled the amount of fruit.  I did add 3 tbls of flour to the blueberries as suggested by one user and it make the cobbler too thick.  My family also prefers a crustier crust.

Delicious cobbler, but the baking time is way off.  Next time, I will either double--yes, DOUBLE!--the time, with foil over the pan for the last half to prevent too much browning, or I will double the berries and do this in a 9 x 13.

Good dessert, but the berry base was too soupy after baking and the pan took much longer to cook than the recipe lists. I will add flour to the berries if I make this again.

This was a terrific recipe. Used a little less milk in the dough and also added a little cinnamon to the dough as well. We served it with whipped cream to complete the presentation.

I would suggest not using all of the milk in the cobbler dough.  I dumped it all in and was sorry at the result.  Way too runny.  I think this also contributed to having to bake it twice as long as the recipe states.   I would suggest you start with 2/3 cup and see how it looks.  It should be spooned over not poured like pancake batter.  I did hold back on the sugar.  3/4 cup is enough to sweeten and juice up the berries.  When it was finally baked it was pretty good.  Top with your favorite whipping and sprinkle some cinnamon.  Giving it 2 stars for recipe that hasn't been "tinkered" enough; having to bake longer and keep rechecking,  but still good flavor.

I made this morning and took it to work.  My co-worker, whose son is a caterer, wanted the recipe for him.  It was simply delicious.  I followed the recipe except for one thing, I don't measure too closely. Only one thing would have made it better, if it had been warm with ice cream.  Who counts calories anyway.

I used 4 cups of fresh blueberries & 1/2 cup sugar on them. Overall the taste was good, but the blueberry base was too dry for my liking.   I guess more sugar would have made a syrup, but didnt want it too sweet.  I'll add vanilla yogurt to my portion & it should be delish!

This was a really great recipe and a crowd favorite at the latest gathering of my friends. I didn't use the cinnamon sugar topping, i wasn't sure how well cinnamon would mix with the blueberry taste. I used about 4 tablespoons of lemon juice for the juice of one lemon. I was surprised by how little sauce was in the blueberries when you baked them, pretty much just lemon juice and sugar coated berries, but the sauce from the cooked berries was wonderful!

Very good!  I never follow a recipe "exactly", but this was an excellent one to refresh my memory, since I haven't made a cobbler in many years.  I used a deeper, casserole dish, and more berries, also added some pear for a different texture, but it was EXCELLENT!  Thank You! (From my 10 year old son & I)

I love this recipe.  I added more blueberries, used splenda instead of sugar in the filling,only added 1/2 of the amount of vanilla,and cooked it 10 min longer.  Very yummy my children loved it also.  THe topping is very cake like and so rich.

It's my favorite  blueberry recipe so far. I did double the amount of blueberries, and used only a quarter of sugar to mix with the berries and that was plenty sweet. I baked it for about 20 - 25 mins and broiled it at 400 for another 10 mins to make sure the topping was done....or else I think it would take forever to bake the middle part of the topping. I have a gas oven however, so the timing may need to be a little adjusted for electric ovens, but I do still recommend broiling it in the end.

This is a wonderful cobbler.  My family loved it!  The only thing I did different was to add a few more blueberries and let it cook about 10 min. longer.  Great recipe.

I'm not typically a cobbler fan, but we have a blueberry bush and were trying to find a way to use up all these fresh blueberries. This recipe is quite good and I do like the thicker crust. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and still think it came out a little too sweet. Next time, I'm only using 1/4 cup.

My 3 1/2 yr old daughter, who won't eat fruit, ate this right up. I used 4 cups of blueberries and added an extra Tbsp. of butter to both the berries and the batter. This is delicious warm from the oven.

Also did 5 cups blueberries and used splenda instead of sugar. Forgot the lemon juice and vanilla accidently but the kids still loved it. I wasn't crazy about the topping was like a big ole pancake and the extra blueberries are a must...their wouldn't be anywhere near enough using the amount called for in the recipe. Will still look for a recipe with a better topping though.

I used fresh blueberries for this recipe and thought the blueberry sauce could have used far less sugar.  The topping was too biscuit like.  This recipe turned out more like a blueberry shortcake in my opinion.  The topping didn't brown well either, not like in the picture.  I used a stonewear casserole for this, maybe that didn't help.
Very valiant effort at a cobbler recipe.

This has a really nice flavor to it but it was way too much topping. The first time I made it I used all the flour mixture but it just took way too long to bake through. It was frustrating since I used fresh blueberries and had to do it over again. The outside baked faster and the inside took forever.  Once I cut back on the topping it was perfect. I also cut back on the sugar- I only used 3/4 cup.

This recipe gets 5+ stars. The first time i botched up the recipe and had to start over. The second time i nailed it and it turned out great. And by all means take the advice of others like i did and serve it with a good vanilla ice cream!

Delicious!  I took other's advice and cut the sugar to 1/2 C and it was still plenty sweet.  I also had to bake it an additional 10 mins. or so...I'm in Denver??  Anyway, this is a great recipe for when you buy that giant container of blueberries at Costco and don't want them to go to waste!  It's even tastier the next day straight out of the fridge!

excellent recipe. I thought it was too sweet right out of the oven but the next day, it was perfect. I will be using this recipe often. Works best with fresh blueberries however, and you may want to make extra topping.

Very good.  I made some changes to make it similiar to a good blueberry pie recipe that I have.  For the filling I used 3 cups of fresh blueberries, no vanilla extract, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, little less than 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 tbsp. flour and 1 tsp. melted butter (this could be left out).  I made the topping the same as the recipe said.  It took about 50 minutes on 375 to bake.  It was very good.  The topping is cake like but we found it a bit too thick for the filling so next time I may not use all the topping.

After reading other reviewers I did cut the suger in half in the berry mixture and the cooking time was twice as long as suggested.  Very good recipe and will make it again.  My son is re-heating some now!

Lovely recipe! Beautiful cobbler. I added a little nutmeg to blueberries and substituted buttermilk instead of milk. I gotta say sprinkling sugar on top was wonderful idea!

This might very well be the best cobbler I've eaten in a long time.  I doubled the blueberries, and I was a little worried that I didn't double the topping.  But I used self-rising flour, so there was plenty of cake to soak up the yummy blueberry juice!  I also used Splenda and my picky husband never knew the difference!  Thanks for this recipe; it's a keeper!

This is sooooo good!  It is also very easy to prepare.  The ingredients are basic and could be found in any kitchen, except the purchase of blueberries.  I used frozen blueberries and it was absolutely delicious!  Please watch the bake time.  I left in for longer to get the dough to crisp.  Bravo!!!!  5 Stars

Very good! I made this for a neighborhood cookout.  Suprisingly not much was taken.  Well, just more for me and my family.  I used a mixture of red berries, black berries, and blueberries.  Next time I'd like to add more berries.

This is good, but I think it could use more blueberries and less sugar...extremely sweet recipe.  Also, it seemed more cake-like than a cobbler should be.

Kudos, Friendlyfood!   Your tinkering paid off. I am a cinnamon lover so I adjusted this amount plus added more sugar on top. Thank you for sharing your delicious recipe. Your Grandmother must be proud.

The dough part of this recipe tasted more like a biscuit than cake which was not my favorite part.  I used fresh blueberries & liked the filling but would suggest less sugar.  I would not call this the "Very Best" but it was OK.

This recipe was very disappointing, and most definitely not a cobbler. It was a way too sweet cake/muffin type topping over blueberries.

This cobbler just didn't fit together. The blueberries were way too soupy and the topping was way too cake like. I will not be making it again.

Easy to make, didn't take a lot of time, which is important to me, as I have 3 children, one of them being a newborn, and is absolutely delicious!! I did the recipe exactly as stated & it was not overly sweet, the berries were delicious, I loved it!!

This recipe is fantastic! I used a 9x13 pan, so needed to double the ingredients, but it worked well. I did use more than the amount of berries it called for...in a 9x13 pan, 5 cups would not have been enough. I used a mixture of fresh and frozen blueberries, fresh blackberries and fresh raspberries. For the doubled recipe, I used approximately 1.5 cups of sugar mixed with the berries, as I was hoping for a slightly less sweet result, and it was perfect. Overall, just a very good recipe, and people rave about it every time I make it!

This recipe is delicious. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the berries and then followed the recipe exactly. It's wonderful, tastes like the one my mother used to make. 
Took it out of the oven, spooned some into my bowl and topped it with vanilla almond milk!
Oh yeah this rocked!!!!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and felt like it was too sweet - and I like sweet.  The recipe says to sprinkle the one cup of sugar or less over the blueberries but it's hard to know what to do the first time.  Now I know to start with 3/4 of a cup and see how that goes.  It definitely was easy to make and great - just a bit too sweet.

Good recipe, but cooking time is waaay off.  I cooked for 35 minutes, thought it was done (did knife test, which came out clean in several spots) but the middle was not done under the crust...ate it anyway.  Very delicious, but should be cooked for 40 minutes.

It was like cake on top of very little blueberries, too much cake. Plus cobbler should not be like a cake to me, totally missed the boat. It was a good dessert just not what I was looking for at all. I made this as is but i use frozen blueberries.

I read other reviewers suggestion, and made these changes: increased fruit to 4-5 cups mix between fresh blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. I lessened the sugar from the first part to 3/4c instead of 1c, and used 1/2 tsp + 4 tsp extra flour per a reviewers suggestion. For the step 2 sugar addition I used 4tbls sugar (instead of 6tbls), used 2% milk. I sprinkled the top with 1-2 tsp sugar, and 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of a pinch. Otherwise, I followed the recipe directions. Got rave reviews from the eaters about fruit and flavor. Very easy, I will make this again with these modifications.

Delicious. We picked blueberries in the morning and made this right away. We used a little less sugar and it was still quite sweet.  We also used a little less topping. Yum!

The texture of this cobbler isn't like any other cobbler.  I like a more biscuit-like texture, this was more cake-like, lots of odd pillowy softness, and it was way too sweet.  And it's weird-looking as well, when I pulled it out of the oven it had an unpleasantly smooth surface.  I served it last night and no one complained but they didn't rave about it either.  Well, I'm open-minded so I gave this recipe a shot, you live and learn LOL.

Excellent! The batter bakes up fluffy. I doubled the fruit and used lemon zest in addition to the juice of half a lemon. I had to extend the cook time to about 40 minutes.

I doubled the recipe except for the sugar -it definitely did not need that much. The cooking time was more like 40 minutes for this larger dish. I substituted soy milk and it worked great. Great directions. Very straight forward. Yum!!

I added more blueberries.  Made a few times.  DELISH.  I want to take away a star due to this contributing to my recent weight gain but I guess that wouldn't be fair to the recipe.

A great recipe.  I substituted Stivia due to a diabetic in the house....but it turned out so yummy.  Add a little milk or ice-cream!  Nice for dessert on a snowy day!

Excellent cobbler! I only had frozen blueberries and lemon juice in a bottle. I reduced to using 1 cup of sugar total for the recipe (3/4 cup and 1/4 cup). My family loves it.

My family loved this my husband said it was the best he loves the cake type crust. But I did change it up a little I added more butter to the batter about 2tbs and some butter in the blue berries about 2 tbs as well. I also doubled the blue berries cut down the sugar to half.  I also added cinnamon to the berries, half the vanilla because I use pure vanilla. My children said it was the best ever even better than my own recipe. I will be doing this one again and again, and will also use it for my other cobblers.

I fixed it for Thanksgiving, cut back on the sugar by 30%, and it was very good, with several people taking second helpings, which is always a good sign. I used the handy allrecipe calculator to increase the quantity of ingredients to serve 8 people and that worked well, except that I didn't increase the baking time to compensate, and my oven is a low-temp oven anyway, and a glass baking dish takes further compensation in your baking calculations. So, I got a few inches of gooey center, but the rest was golden brown. All told, I give this recipe a high rating if you reduce the sugar, but I don't think blueberries need too much sugar.

Just made this recipes & while it's easy enough, a bake time of 20-25 minutes at 375 is WILDLY inaccurate(unless maybe a convection oven is being used). At 40 minutes in, I started Googling other blueberry cobbler recipes, thinking I'd done something wrong & found that other's baked at 375 were baked for a minimum of 35-40 minutes. Mine using this recipe looks perfect(golden brown, clean knife) at 43 minutes. It smells & looks yummy though. I can't wait to try it!!!

I love blueberry oobbler. This was more like a blueberry cake. Also it took f-o-r-e-v-e-r for it to bake. The recipe called for a baking time of 20-25 minutes. I had to bake it for a full 45 minutes before my knife would not come out with raw dough on it. Luckily I have a sweet tooth. Ice cream definitely made it more paletable. Perhaps there was too much dough topping. One third less topping would have been better and a third to half less sugar.

It tasted delicious - but...the batter was very thin. I double-checked the recipe and went over my steps, my oven is accurate, and I did everything correctly, so not sure what the problem was.  I ended up letting it bake for 35 minutes and it turned out like the picture:-) It looks a little light on top, but it is done all the way through.  

The recipe itself was very easy also - all in all, other than the initial panic about the thin batter, this one is a keeper!

I tried this on the fly for Memorial Day. What a mistake. Way too much dough. By the time the dough cooked, all the juice was gone. Thanks to all the baking powder, this came out to be a metallic-tasting, very-berry biscuit. Next time I will just blot pancake batter on top and call it a day!

I do NOT recommend adding vanilla; it made the flavor a bit "fake" tasting. The sugar was cut in half, because 1 cup is just too much. The topping could have also done without the cinnamon sugar, because it didn't add to the cobbler. I also had to add 10-12 minutes to the cooking time. I liked the fluff of the cakey texture (although more shortcake than cobbler) but the taste was not there regardless. In my experience, it was just OKAY in taste.

I made this tonight for dessert with my boyfriend. I used fresh blueberries and followed the recipe exactly. I did need to use a splash more milk to get it the right consistency. The topping was definitely biscuity. I thought the whole thing turned out alright but too sweet. I don't think I will make this again.

I made this recipe as-is based on the 4 star rating, but neglected to read the reviews until after it was in the oven. I agree with others who have said that as written it is WAY too sweet, and the cake to fruit ratio is off by quite a bit (needs more blueberries and/or less cake). I also ended up baking for nearly an hour, as it was a sloppy mess at 30 minutes. The texture of the cake is nice, but the recipe needs a lot of tweaking.

This called for a little too much sugar. Only need about 1/2 of the amount the recipe calls for. It also didn’t call for enough blueberries. There was too much cobbler for the amount of blueberries. Would double or triple the amount of blueberries next time. Otherwise it’s a pretty solid recipe.

Made this yesterday with freshly picked Michigan blueberries. I used a half cup more of blueberries than recipe called for. It was simple and delicious. My first sampling was when warm, just out of oven, and I initially felt I could have cut back on sugar used for fruit portion of recipe (I had not added additional sugar despite adding half cup more of blueberries)..but we had a piece after cooled, and later from fridge, and it tasted perfect. I will definitely use this cobbler recipe a second time this blueberry season!

Very good! Such an easy, classic recipe. I could have done with a little more cobbler and a little less fruit but that is just a preference.  The recipe was fantastic and my husband LOVED it!

Delicious cobbler! Next time I would use about alf the sugar and about double the blueberries and use a 9x13 pan since the dough really fluffs up once baked.

I like a little crust to my cobbler yet I like this fluffier biscuit version. The sugar coating on top of the biscuits is a nice touch. Dab the top with butter to brown it nicely. It actually had to bake closer to 40 or 45 minutes though.

Not a good recipe at all.

It took MUCH longer than 25 minutes to bake.  In fact, I had it in the oven for 50 minutes after following the recipe exactly, and it STILL wasn't done, so I just took it out anyways because I was tired of waiting.

The flavor was disappointing, especially for how long this took.  It was bland, too sugary, and really cakey- the entire thing was almost crust/topping rather than berries.  The pan I used (an 8x8 as stated in the recipe) also seemed small.  With how long I had to cook it, the blueberry juices kept cooking out and nearly leaked out of the pan several times.

The only good part was the blueberries.  Definitely will not make again.

Pretty tasty dessert.  I didn't have fresh or frozen berries, so I used dried blueberries, added about a cup of water, and simmered for a few minutes.  Also, I halved the sugar in the berries.  It came out more cobbler than berries, so next time I think I'll increase the amount of berries.  Overall, this recipe is a keeper.

Our family can not get enoough of this cobbler. I used Splenda instead of sugar in the berries and Splenda for baking for the dough.  No one knew the difference and my diabetic husband could enjoy this along with the rest of the family. Less sugar is better for everyone . I tried other recipes, but this is the one everyone wants

This was good but not as good other "crust on top" desserts I've had.  I had to bake it double the required time.  The blueberries were very runny.  However, easy to make!  I will most likely make it again.

This was basincally very good however the next time I'll either use less sugar or add more flour to the berries as it came out very soupy. The taste was very good so it's worth making again.

I followed the recipe, aside from adding more blueberries to the dish.  There is just too much topping- and it really doesn't taste that great.  It is like a giant biscuit.  There are definitely better ways to use your precious blueberries.  Try the creamy blueberry pie recipe instead.

Wow, so delicious - but be warned - this is NOT your average "crisp" or "crumble" - it is very moist and cakey in the middle as is suggested - but for me, that was a pleasant surprise with this recipe. I began with intentions to find a crisp/crumble type recipe, and ended up making this one instead - and our family prefers it to a run-of-the-mill crisp anyday! Make this and prepare for your tastebuds to be blown away!

Delicious!!!!  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the blueberries because we love them, but used only 2/3 cup of sugar.  I did not add the vanilla.  I used 4 tablespoons of flour on the blueberries.  Everything else was done according to the recipe.  We ate it with vanilla ice cream, but I think it would be delicious alone.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this again and again.

My boyfriend and I thought this cobbler was very good! I only Changed two things, I added fresh strawberries and I sprinkled about a half cup of sugar over the berries because a whole cup seemed like too much. This was the first cobbler I have made and we were very pleased with it.

Wow! I definitely out-did myself when I made this one last night.  I made a few changes as follows: 1)I used a mixture of blackberries and raspberries, 2)I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter as well as to the berries, 3) I didn't have any lemon juice so I used lemon essence instead, 4)I reduced the amount of sugar.  My husband absolutely loved this one and now we have decided to make this one of our family recipes.  If I had to decribe this in one word, it would be YUMMMMMMMMMMM!

Very good flavor and easy to make.
I used fresh berries and only had just a little under the two cups.  Used a bit more flour (the berries were very juicy) and half the sugar. Could cut that even more, now that I see the rest of the reviews.

I added some lemon zest (aboout 1/2 tsp)  along with the lemon juice and thought it really gave it a nice citrus zing.

It didn't really turn out quite like I thought it would.  The cobbler part was very biscuity, and I prefer it to be more cakey, but that's my opinion.  Other than that, it's easy to make.

This was a delicious and easy recipe to make.  I doubled the recipe in a 9 x 13 pan.  My family likes more fruit, so I added an extra 2.5 cups of blueberries.  I didn't make any other changes.  It worked perfectly.  The top was crisp and tasted great, and the blueberries tasted sweet and juicy.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of cooking it 5 minutes longer (my darn oven), and it was soooo delicious. I will definitely make this again.

The best is what this recipe deserves!

I made this cobbler for Fathers Day (evening church session 2008), and oh my.  The folks were coming back to scrap the sides of the baking dish to get what little blueberries remained.

I made a few minor changes to the recipe.  I doubled the recipe (fresh 5 1/2 cups of blueberries) and halfed the sugar (1 cup to 1/2 cup) but kept everything else in the same portion (doubled).  Im making it tomorrow for a friend that is going out on maternity leave soon....Thanks for a great recipe!

This was relly tasty.  I put twice the berries, because I really like the berries! If you use the extra berries they need to be thawed or the center takes too long to cook.

I am a starting cook that has a limited budget.  I have to say that my husband loved this Cobbler! " This is the best thing that you have ever made mmmmm......" Thank you FriendlyFood for this terrific easy to make recipe. I had to add a little more flour to the dough and served the Cobbler with Vanilla Ice-cream. Between to two of us it didn't last long at all.  Can't wait to try out more of your foods!

MMMMM. This was the best cobbler that I have found yet! It is very sweet...nice and southern and the way I like it! If someone likes a tart cobbler, I would half the sugar..but I think its great. The cinnamon in it compliments the blueberries fabulously. I had to kick my oven up to 400, but other than that, I will make this time and time again! Simply delicious!

I have never eaten a cobbler before,but I decided to give this a try anyway. I used thawed frozen berries. It came out okay, except for some reaon the flour mixture  wasn't as dry as I thought it should be.

Loved it!  This was really, really good.  The blueberries were a little runny though, so I might either step up the flour or add a little corn starch to them prior to baking.  The topping is fabulous and I'm excited to try it with other fruit (peaches, raspberries, etc.)

The recipe calls for way too much sugar in the filling; I could have cut it in half even after I added an extra cup of blueberries. Takes a lot more time to cook also. I made 3 today because I had a lot of blueberries that needed to be used fast; my third one has been in the oven for 55 minutes and is still doughy--I couldn't save the others, so I'll have to scrape away the uncooked dough and serve as ice cream topping. Filling could have used at least a tablespoon of flour to keep it from being completely liquid.

I made it exactly  according to the recipe since it was my first time. Next time I will add at least double the blueberries and perhaps use a bigger pan the cobbler part of the recipe was delicious but way too thick for an 8 x 8 pan otherwise it tasted delicious

Loved this recipe! Easy, and tasty. I will agree that there is a bit much too sugar in with the berries. I would cut back about 1/4-1/2 cup next time.  Everyone had seconds and thirds, so I think it was a hit. I used frozen blueberries that we had picked just this past July, and didn't have a lemon and used lemon juice instead. I did double the recipe with no problems.

This is very good, but too cake-y for my taste.  I like more berries, less cake.

Doubled the recipe (otherwise followed it exactly) and baked it longer in a 10x15 dish.  This was hands-down the BEST cobbler I've ever had.  The only change I would make would be to cut down a little on the amount of sugar.  It was almost too sweet.  The buttery, sugar-crusted, cake-like topping was superb!!

This is the best blueberry cobbler ever! It's so soft and delightfully absorbent of the blueberry on the bottom.  I made it into a more muffin/crumble type of baked good by adding more liquid. I doubled the blueberries, doubled the lemon juice, and halved the sugar used on the bottom. I also cooked it longer at a higher temperature, took out the topping, and it was delicious. Health wise, it was a lot better too. My picky sister couldn't stop eating it! 5 STARS!!!

Ugh, tried this for the first time, not sure if I'll try again. Followed directions to the t, but doubled it, blueberries came out rubbery and juice was watery, not a good.flavor.

I read the reviews before I made it and the ladies were right. I used only 1/2 cup sugar and that was enough. I didn't add as much sugar to the topping. The dough was cake like. I will also keep looking. It was just ok, not the best

I ADDED about 8 large frozen strawberries I found in the freezer. I roughly sliced them into about 4 slices, each. I added this to the blueberries for the first standing time.

It was juicy enough, sweet enough, pretty enough, and satisfying enough for a first time prep.  A BIG thanks from
Georgia! MamaPat

I only used 1/2 c sugar with the blueberries and it was plenty sweet for me and my family.  Also, where I was supposed to melt 1 TBSP butter and pour over the blueberries - I got lazy.  I just cut up the butter into small pieces and dotted the berries.  I also had to bake mine for closer to 30 minutes for the top to be cooked all the way.  Was really good and everyone who ate it raved about it.  A definite keeper!  Next time we will be serving it warm and with vanilla ice cream!

Way, way, way too much sugar.  A whole cup on the berries and then more in the dough?  The berries were completely buried in a mound of sugar.  Then I had to bake it 25 minutes more than the recipe called for to get the topping done.  It was still gooey underneath next to the berries even then, but after a couple hours of cooling it seemed to set up a bit better.  I'm looking for something a bit less sickly sweet  next time.

The "sponge cake" part of this recipe is a hidden gem. I just made it..the cake part only. I just added a pinch of vanilla extract and it's the best white cake I ever made! How can this be with no eggs and minimal ingredients? Moist and fluffy..perfect texture! My kids are even going crazy over if...I can't tell you how many white cake recipes I have tried. With tons of steps and ingredients and this simple  batter is amazing. Didn't really like it with the blueberries but glad I found this cake batter!

I used 1/2 the sugar. The blueberry part is fine after reducing the sugar. The cake...needs work. Cobblers usually have a bit of crunchiness to them. This recipe is like a super fluffy pancake. And there is way too much of it. I put 1/2 of the "dough" on a flat cookie sheet with the cinnamon/sugar. It baked up really airy. So for an 8x8, it only really needs 1/2 the dough recipe.

I  added to the batter a teaspoon of lemon rind that I grated with my micro-planer.  I also added way more berries than the recipe calls for because I like lots of fruit!! As it was baking, I  had to loosely place tinfoil on the top of the pan, as it was browning quickly, giving the appearance that it was done. Don't be confused by the time given to bake this, It takes twice as long to get done as the recipe calls for. You'll know its not done, because your testing knife will come out doughy!! But, its definitely a keeper- a real yummy recipe!  But only Four stars because of the BIG time discrepancy!

This is a great recipe! I reduced an amount of sugar and instead of 1 cup - I used 1/3 cup. Besides I put raspberries and Fuji Apple on the bottom (I didn't have blueberries in my fridge).I made this recipes twice and always tastes delicious! Everyone loves it!
Thank you for sharing:)

Made exactly as written, and it was excellent!  Yes, it's sweet, but it's supposed to be...it's dessert!  If you want, reduce the sugar.  I don't think it needs any ice cream as it's great on it's own.  Make sure to brush your teeth immediately after eating.  The blueberries can stain!  A keeper!

This was a pretty good upside down cake, but there was far too much cake for it to be a cobbler.  I followed the recipe as written, and found the filling too sweet, and there wasn't enough of it.  I don't think I'll make this recipe again, but if I did I would double the blueberries, half the sugar, and half the batter.  So, basically, if I do it again I'd make it a whole different recipe.  Also, it took more than 40 minutes to cook, not 20-25.

Very tasty but way too much crust for the amount of blueberry filling, that is unless you like your cobbler very dry.  Next time I'll double the blueberries and use a 9 x 13 pan or cut the dough in half for the 8 x 8 pan.  I don't think it would be necessary to double the sugar when doubling the amount of blueberries unless the berries are extremely tart.

Very sweet. The topping could be eaten by itself. The only thing I adjusted on my second cobbler was the amount of topping. It was thicker than I like but I love everything else about it. 2 cobblers in 3 days with 4 boys.

The flavor of this  recipe was very good and it was pleasingly moist. However I agree with some of the other reviewers that the topping is indeed very cake like and therefor the dish does not have a cobbler consistency at all . I expected the crunchy consistency of a cobbler topping and instead liken the finished product to an upside down cake. Good recipe, wrong title.

I used an iron skillet. Too much sugar. I usually use 3/4 of the sugar. I also did  cherries and blueberries. Delicious.

Great recipe.  I think it was too sweet however.  The blueberries were pretty sweet already, and this recipe called for quite a bit of sugar.  I didn't even use all that was called for.  I think if I make it again, I'll cut the sugar down to about 1/4 of what is called for on the berries.

I made this this afternoon.   Very good recipe.  I had more than 2 1/2 cups of blueberries so I used a little over three cups.  Still only used the one cup of sugar as we don't like our berry desserts too sweet.  My berries were frozen so I defrosted in a sauce pan and cooked some of the liquid out. We loved the cake-like biscuit dough.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing.

It was good, but VERY sweet! I even used fresh berries. Next time I am going to put 1/2 a cup of sugar in the berries than the whole amount.

This is a great recipe for a blueberry cobbler.  Definitely a 5 star but would suggest a longer cooking time.  Even after 25 minutes @ 375 the crust was brown on top but "soupy" below.

My picky husband said this was the best.  I cut the lemon juice in half, used only 2/3 c. sugar on the berries and added 2T. butter to the topping.  Leave the topping part liquidy and part dry before adding to berries.  Scrumptious!

This is absolutely delicious!! Very easy to make. I did double the blueberries and flour in the blueberries and I put some lemon zest in it too. I baked it in a 9x13" cake pan for 40 minutes. Everything else was perfect including the vanilla. There's no way that changed the wonderful taste of the blueberries and believe me, we eat a lot of blueberries. I couldn't believe some of the nasty comments. Wow! Terrific recipe!! Thanks for posting!

My eldest daughter made this for us, and it was very good. I'm giving it four stars, though, because the baking time is (as others have noted) too short.  It needs to bake closer to 40 minutes, nearly double the time listed.  Also, I followed other commenters suggestions and had my daughter cut the sugar by 1/3.  Even that was still a tad too sweet; we will definitely make this again, but next time we will cut the sugar in half.  However, the cake-topping is delicious, which is why I recommend this recipe.

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  My only problem was trying to get the topping baked.  I kept putting it back in the oven over and over and it was still very raw under the crust. I finally stirred up the crust to let the heat get to the raw topping but it still didn't get done after another 10 minutes and the rest of the top was getting to dark. I am thinking you should add the milk slowly and only until moist, not the whole amount at once. Then it would be ok.

What a terrible recipe! Incredibly tedious in terms of recipe ingredient quantities (who measures in tbsp for everything??) and recipe instructions...this could have been written much simpler/easier.  The final product was a sticky undercooked mess and way too much sugar that didnt dissolve properly in the bottom part of the dish....should have added some water maybe to the base! Gross!

It was delicious but we needed to cook it far longer than instructed and still the center topping was uncooked. Those seeking a more traditional cobbler might be disappointed. I agree with those who suggest backing off on the sugar, both in the filling and the topping, and adding more blueberries.  NB: our berries came from the field.  Other fillings
may behave differently.

Delicious fall/winter dessert.  I used frozen mixed berries and baked for 35 minutes to a perfect golden brown.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll cut the sugar by 1T for the batter and 1/4 C. for the berries, as we decided the original recipe to be a bit too sweet for us.  Thank you so much for sharing with us.

Nice bubbly and quite tasty. I would have liked a little more crust though.

came out ok. watch cooking time as the cake was a bit hard, but that could just be a difference in ovens.

Two words....  Loved it!

I've got 5 blue berry bushes, producing a lot of nice fresh berries.  I know what to use them for now!

HINT. I used frozen triple berries(raspberries, blueberries, blackberries. The topping was great but the berries were very bitter. With the choice of berries I should have added more sugar so this was not a sweet cobbler as others have mentioned. Next time I will use sweeter berries or add sugar to the berries!

My family loved this recipe, and I did not cut the sugar.  I did substitute a splash of lemon juice from a bottle because I had it.  We are a sweet tooth bunch, though!  Thanks so much!
