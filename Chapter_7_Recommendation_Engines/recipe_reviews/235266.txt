Very nice.  I used the slow cooker instead of stove top.  Load everything in, I had to break up the carcass to make it fit, cover and cook on low overnight.  The next morning, strain the solids and you are done.  I do add the skin from the turkey but the fat rises to the top after it chills and can easily be scooped off.

One point I would like to make:  when cooking down the carcass, you should really really break the bones first! Use a hammer to crush them, or poultry shears....the marrow in the bones is LOADED with good nutrients and flavor. This makes all the difference in the world, and your broth should end up somewhat gelatinous. 
Also, as at least one other reviewer pointed out, your best bet is to strain and then allow the broth to cool so you can remove the fat.
Other than this, it's a great recipe.

It was really good after one critical step - refrigerate overnight & skim off the layer of fat, otherwise it tastes oily, especially if you have much skin or fat left on the carcass.

I freeze chicken remnants until I have time to cook and can a batch or two of this.  I cook in the crockpot overnight instead of cooking stove top, then I strain, refrigerate several hours, and skim off the fat.  Otherwise, I have been making it as written for the past two years, and I love it!

I used this stock recipe for two carcasses. I doubled it and it worked out great. I would definitely use it again.

I always brine my turkey and a couple extra turkey necks and freeze them.  Whenever I need to make stock I just use thaw a couple necks and it makes great stock.
