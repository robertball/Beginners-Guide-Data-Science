In Budapest, we use Nesquik as a filler as well as various jams.  The palacsinta recipe can be adapted to make savory meals as well. Another popular one in Hungary is Hortobagyi Palacsinta, a savory pancake stuffed with cooked seasoned chicken chopped fine, then rolled and covered in a paprka/sour cream sauce.  The art and the versatility of the palacsinta is a lasting legacy from Hungarian kitchen! Thanks to contributor for helping spread the word!  This recipe can be made as is or tweaked to unlimited variations!

i gave a crepe party for 7 yesterday using this recipe. Made ab. 40 crepes, 30 of which i cooked on 1 side, wrapped into them pre-cooked foods like chicken, sausages, and spinach/cheese filling, and fried again. These were wrapped into a money-purse shape. the other 10 crepes i fried on both sides and rolled fried bananas and fresh cherries into them, then broiled them and served w whipped cream, chocolate syrup and nuts. here are my observations on this recipe, i.e., on the batter and the making of the pancakes.  1. the mixing instuctions did not work fo me.  flour and egg create dry, had lumps that are very difficult to get rid of in the batter. in my 2nd batch i followed the conventional method by beating the egg first with milk then mixing the rest of ingredients in.  2. dont need to use this much oil. you can half the oil in this recipe and still not have any sticking to the pan so why add those calories.  3. the just- cooked crepes do not stick together even when fried just on one side so no need to bother with wax or parchment paper. much time saved.  still i prefer this recipe over the eggier-tasting french crepes so i do recomend it and will use again.

I am a Hungarian, but grew in Germany and tried Palacsinta with many different fillings. I prefer them filled with home-made jam, like apricot or strawberry!!!Germans make pancakes thicker, an often fill it with ham, (white) asparagus and Hollandaise sauce. Either way, sweet or savory, this is definitely worth a try!

My Grandma Fekete used to make these ALL the time when we were kids. We used just sugar and chocolate syrup - sometimes crushed walnuts - for the filling. So delicious hot or cold. I've never met a single person who didn't LOVE these!

Great recipe overall. I made this for my Hungarian husband and in-laws and they said it was good. The only difference in this and what they're used to is that their crepe was lighter. I think its because this recipe used oil and theirs used shortening. I will try it again using shortening, and also a flavored cottage cheese. This was a great recipe and very rich and sweet. Thanks for posting!

This is awesome!  I love the Almond filling. Instead of vanilla, I used almond extract to make the almond flavor more potent.  I also let the almond filling cook a little longer on low heat to make it thicker.  The chocolate sauce was so easy to make and I used butter.  I also topped it with whipped cream.

We used to make this recipe with my Mom, but instead of almonds, we used walnuts. I must try it with the almonds. She said it called gundell pancake, and in restaurants they serve it fired up.

My mom used to make these for my sister and I when my dad was on 2nd shift and not home for supper.  She would fill them with a sweetened cottage cheese and powdered sugar on top -so yummy...now I make them for my kids and I usually end up eating more than they do!  Maybe I'm subconsciously making them for myself!  :)

OP here. Thank you all for the positive reviews. I don't mind at all if you add a 5 star review based on a memory of eating something similar; however, it is not fair to deduct stars based on a bias against one ingredient without even sampling the recipe under review. "It doesn't seem right to use chocolate" is not a valid criticism. Please do not leave a negative review if you haven't tried the recipe!

I made this exactly as described, except I added some rum raisins to the almond filling (I didn't add the optional rum to the filling itself). This recipe was delicious!! My husband swore that the crepes were the best palacsinta he's eaten. Thanks for posting this awesome recipe.

We use 1/4 cup lemon juice for the liquid and a grated lemon peel. Great lemon pancakes and then fill them with jam, roll them up and eat 'em. Oh the memories!

Delicious! However, the pancake became a little gooey after being wrapped around the almond mixture for a while. I'm not sure if this was how it was meant to be, but my three little sisters all loved it nonetheless (that says more than you think!).

My grandma used to com visit and make these and my sister and I used to compete on who could eat more!  we used to put jelly or preserves and cottage cheese inside roll them up and put sour crem on top.   Although I am a chocaholic it doesnt seem right to use chocolate in them. She never used water but we use wondra flour and skim milk and no vegetable oil just margarine or spread in the skillet. Nan
