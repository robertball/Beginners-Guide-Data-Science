I needed a whole wheat recipe for banana bread and this was perfect! It’s nice and moist. The only change I made was to use coconut oil instead of olive oil. My kids loved it too and didn’t even care that it was whole what flour (and trust me, they ALWAYS care).

8.7.16   I'm typically not crazy about banana bread made with whole wheat flour, but this recipe turned out fairly well.  Baked in 3 mini loaf pans for 35 minutes, it's plenty moist, light in texture, flavorful, and certainly breaks down better nutritionally than many banana bread recipes.  It's a compromise for me, but it's one I can make.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Not too sweet. Very moist. I would make it again.
