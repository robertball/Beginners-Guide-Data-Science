I added chopped fresh cilantro to the dumplings and used my own seasonings and water instead of beef broth.  Family loved it!

This recipe was very good.  The meat was delicious.  My only complaint was that the cornbread was a little bland, even with the onions.  I think next time I will add some garlic or onion salt to the bread mix for a little more seasoning.
