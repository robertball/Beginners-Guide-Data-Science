I like this a lot; especially when the beef cheeks were combined with the kimchi. That's a match made in heaven. The beef on it's own, however, could use a little more flavor I think. It's good, just something's missing. I think I will try some fresh ginger, rice wine vinegar, or maybe some Chinese five spice in the future. I also made this easier by browning everything in a Dutch oven, then putting it in the oven at 275 degrees for about 4 hours. And I didn't have sesame seeds, so I left them out. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!
