It was great! Nothing beats fresh applesauce in the fall. I recommending cutting the sugar in half, though. It was just a little too sweet.

This is very similar to my recipe. However the point of home made applesauce is to reduce sugar intake! Cook the apples for about an hour over low heat, or until fruit is mushy. Use food grinder to puree fruit and remove skins. Add cinammon while warm then refrigerate for best taste.

Absolutely Fantastic!!! I didn't even add the cinnamon and nutmeg. It didn't need it.  And the sweetness is just perfect. We ate it warm right after I made it.

I always have and always will cook the apples with their skins on and then put them through a foley mill to finish.  It's the way my mother made it and I have never liked applesauce made without the skins, whether home made or bottled store bought.  I've used many different varieties of apples this way.  The finished color varies with the type of apple used and the color of its skin.

This is not my favorite applesauce recipe though it was acceptable. I reduced the sugar by half and it was still VERY sweet. I think the extra step with the skins was too much labor for no blush. After I added the cinnamon, it turned a bit brown. If you like a very sweet applesauce this would do it though. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I actually use a variety of apples to achieve a more blushed look (and for taste). I only cook for about 15-20 and use my NutriBullet to puree, as we prefer a more solid texture. If you use apple juice instead of water, you can cut the sugar a bit. I've done it both ways and both work out just fine. I add extra cinnamon because my kids love it.

I love leaving the skins on when making applesauce.  I did cut the sweetener, adding honey instead of sugar.  I think real maple syrup would work well too.

I made this exactly by the recipe except that I used Gala apples.  I left the skins on and when the apples were tender, I pureed them, skins and all, with my stick blender.  So easy and absolutely delicious, even cold the next day.  I will definitely make this again!

Very similar to applesauce I make all the time. Use whatever apples are on sale. Use my grandmother's Foley Mill, Sometimes replace sugar with Splenda, add a little vanilla and cinnamon. Nothing better than home made applesauce!!!

This was a big hit! As someone opposed to peeling fruits and vegetables in order to retain more fiber and nutrients, this recipe was great. I also found it to be sweet enough with half the sugar recommended.
