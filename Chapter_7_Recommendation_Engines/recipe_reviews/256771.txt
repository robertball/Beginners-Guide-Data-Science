Awesome brat dip! Used Johnsonville brats of course! Being in Florida I did not have access to curds :(.   Very good dip! Itâ€™s a keeper! Will make it again.

I used sharp and white extra sharp cheese and added diced onions while browning the brats.  Could have used only 1/8 cup of flour.  Great flavor!

The flavors in this all come together nicely. Instead of draining the brat grease I used it instead of butter. Made sense to me. Easy and different dip. The beer flavor comes through pretty strong but doesn't over power the whole dip. Served with Soft pretzels.

This dip is like being at Octoberfest! All of the flavors stand out, the beer, gravy, bratwurst, cheese. I have not tasted anything quite like this. I would serve it with soft oven baked pretzels. It does pair so well as stated. My only issue with the recipe is the fat to flour ratio in the roux is a bit off. I compensated by straining the gravy once but that was a bit nessy. I suggest upping the fat a bit to make a smooth paste before adding the liquids. My only change was not finding cheese curds and using 4oz German beer cheese. Using Johnsonville Beer Brats and McCormick reduced sodium brown gravy as pork gravy was not available. That all worked fine. Ty
