The reason why I gave this recipe three stars is because its missing a few key ingredients.  My mom has a recipe similar to this, but with variation.  She used to make it for us as kids for christmas only, since it was mixed with lemon-lime soda, we didn't get a whole lot of alchohol.  The ingredients that are missing include tea(steeped from about 5 tea bags), and crushed pineapple.  There was also not as much water in her recipe as this one, but it was made up for with a whole bottle of lemon gin.  I think this made it easier to scoop out.  I do believe that the water was at least cut in half approximately, as the rest of the liquid was replaced with the crushed pineapple and juice as well as the concentrated juices and gin.  Other wise a good recipe.

What an unfortunate waste of gin. I felt like I was drinking punch at a child's birthday party.
