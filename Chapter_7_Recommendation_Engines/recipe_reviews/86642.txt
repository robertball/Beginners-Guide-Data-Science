Pasta tonight - Salad the next time!  The only change I made was in making a compromise.  I just couldn't justify buying six lemons, for zest, when I only needed the juice of one.  So, I used the zest and juice of the most enormous lemon I could find.  That worked for me!  Also, I used freshly ground "Medley Peppercorns" and 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic for a litte extra pizzaz.

Absolutely delicious!!!!  Zesting six lemons is a lot of work BUT you can do it in advance as lemon zest freezes very well.  Lemon juice also freezes well so I just squeezed the rest of the lemons and froze the juice.  Also, I added four chopped roma tomatoes as my husband loves them.  I think they added color and a bit more flavor without overwhelming the dish.  If you love cilantro and shrimp, fix this!

Very delicious and will make again! Served nicely over a bed of lettuce, with extra virgin oil, cilantro, and lemon zest. Very colorful and as I said, delicious! Can't wait to try this with pasta!!

I gave this 5 stars.  Great recipe, made a few adjustments of my own but came out great. Added 3 roman tomatoes, a bit more of cilantro and only used the zest of 1 lemon and half of a lemons juice since my husband doesn't like to over do it on the lemon.  Used 1T. chopped garlic in olive oil.  Served over buttered, garlic pasta (noodles) and garlic bread.  Instead of sprinkling pepper and lemon juice on top, sprinkling w/parmesan cheese.  Great flavor do recommend this recipe to others.  Will make again.

Made this tonight for supper.  I agree with another reviwer that I could not see using the zest of 6 lemons when I only needed the juice from one, so I only used 1 lemon.  I also sauted some garlic in the olive oil before adding the shrimp.  Very good recipe.

For one serving I used 8 shrimp (28-30 count) that I marinaded overnight in the zest of one lemon, and the cilantro. When I came to cook the shrimp I added the zest and juice of one lemon, plus I added a good pinch of lemon pepper. Turned out great. Very tasty, and couldn't be easier. Thanks!

This was really good.  I served it over linguini.  I only had 4 lemons, but that gave it plenty of flavor and I  added 1 clove of chopped garlic to the pan. It's a really great light dish that doesn't overpower the shrimp.  Definitely a recipe to keep on hand.  

For a little extra flair, I am thinking that next time I may use limes instead of lemons and serve over rice with MARGARITAS!  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly. My husband kinda liked it; I thought there was too much lemon.   Sounds good on paper, but if I try  it again, I will use about half the amount of lemon and add crushed red pepper.

I used extra large tiger shrimp and served this over a bed of romaine since I'm counting carbs.  It was such a light tasting yet flavor bursting dish, that I can't wait to invite some guests for dinner to serve it again.

Delicious!  I only zested 2 lemons, and used the juice of both.  I didn't use a full cup of Cilantro, I have a plant and I didnt' have enough to do that, but the flavor was wonderful!  Instead of putting everything in a bowl, I put the shrimp, cilantro and lemon zest in a large ziplock bag with a little bit of olive oil and shook it well to coat.  Served over some cappelini and it was terrific with a salad  An entire meal in under 30 minutes!  Perfect!

This recipe is great to marinate the shrimp in for a cold cocktail as well!  I LOVED IT!  I also added a little lime juice to accompany the cilantro and it really worked.

Easy, fast, delicious.  I only used 1 lemon and it was wonderful.  I used the tubes of fresh chopped cilantro and it saved all the work chopping it up.  My daughter from college called for an easy recipe to make for her grandma, and they loved it.  Great for new cooks.  Super easy!

I used the zest of 4 lemons and I felt it was a little bitter.  I think next time I will try some red pepper and garlic for a some zing and fewer lemons. We served this on angel hair with extra lemon juice and enjoyed it but I will make it again with some modifications.

I used 1/4c sofrito instead of the cilantro - it's made with cilantro and other ingredients - and it was DELISH!  Thanks for sharing!

Too much Lemon.  If you do this, don't use precooked shrimp and don't over zest the lemon or it will be bitter lemon flavored without much else.  Couldn't even taste the cilantro or the shrimp over the bitter lemon flavor. Nothing I did could save it.

A little too lemony for my taste, but they weren't bad. I might try this recipe again but cut the lemon in half.

I have not made this with the lemon zest as I don't use fresh lemons that often and don't want to waste them... That being said, the lemon in this recipe is very overpowering. Maybe the lemon zest cuts that down a bit, I don't know. I also don't use as much cilantro as that has also been overpowering. The first time I made it, my hubby and I didn't care for it but we ate it. Since then, I've cut the cilantro back to just sprinkling it and adding 1/2 the lemon juice called for. I remove the shrimp from the pan and add the sauce left in the pan to the pasta for some flavor. I still make this on occasion...

I used 1 lemon for zesting and juicing and it had a powerful lemon taste to it. I tossed in some cooked spaghetti noodles with the shrimp. It had too much lemon in it for my husband and I thought it was okay.  If I make this again I'll use half the lemon juice.

I had cilantro and lemons to use and found this recipe - hubby actually made it and we loved it.  Super simple and very tasty.  I added more cilantro to mine after cooking cause I love the flavor.  Going in my big recipe binder.

An excellent base recipe for a pasta topper - but somewhat bland, and SUPER lemony as-is. I added a shake of garlic powder and some shredded parmesan (not the powdered stuff); that bumped it up to EXCELLENT.

Sorry we did not care for this recipe! My husband loves cilantro but the lemon overpowered any cilantro taste. Maybe I will try it with lime next time and much less of it.

This was a good base for my shrimp pasta dish.  I used 2 lemons and it was excellent.  Can't imagine it with 6 lemons.  I added some asparagus cut in bite sized pieces and would have added mushrooms if I had them on hand.

I only rated this one star because you can't go any lower (sorry).  I love cilantro and also lemon-- but 6 lemons??!  We wasted a perfectly good batch of jumbo shrimp with this recipe and regretted it.  And tasted lemon in our mouths for 2 days!

I would not have tried this in a million years had it not been for the great reviews.  It was awesome.  I only used zest from two lemons and about 1/2 c. chopped cilantro for 24 large shrimp.  SO delicious!!  We served it over a salad.

Way too much lemon in this. Needs something for some added flavor, not just lemon. In fact,there is so much lemon zest that you don't get the flavor of the shrimp. Use a little dash of chili powder or a dab of hot sauce, or some garlic or shallots to bring this dish up to a higher rating. Serve over pasta, rice, in a salad, or with steamed veggies.

This is a regular in our household. As written, I'd only give it 3 stars, but I'm rating it higher because its so easy to improve. I've tried a zillion variations based on what I have in the house at the time of cooking. My favorite version is: zest of 2 lemons, juice of 1, 1 bunch of cilantro (which generally equals about 1 C), add a clove of garlic and 1/4 cup of pinot grigio. That makes it a 5 star recipe.

As written this recipe barely makes it to a 3 star recipe.  I made a few changes to it so we did enjoy this meal.  First off, I zested one lemon only - 6 would have been way too much lemon!  I cut back on the cilantro as well - I cut up about 1/2 cup and that was more than enough.  I also added some garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  Served it over pasta, and we melted butter to pour over it as it seemed sort of dry.  Used more parmesan cheese at the table. I might make this again, and if I do I will also pour some white wine into the mix for some added flavor and liquid.

Flavour explosion! I was also put off by the number of lemons that were required in the original recipe and so I scaled it back a lot. I zested 1.5 lemons and then only squeezed juice directly onto the finished product from 1/2 a lemon (probably used half of the half). I also tossed in 1 small onion and 1 fresh minced garlic clove into the oil before adding any other ingredients. I added 1 tsp of Asian Chili-Garlic Sauce to the shrimp in the bowl as well. 

Served over long grain white rice.

In the end...a dollop of sriracha sauce on the side is just what this dish asked for. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as written, including all the lemon zest (I used the juice from those lemons in another recipe).  I served this over pasta and it turned out great.  Depending on how much pasta is used, an extra splash of olive oil may be necessary.

I like this recipe - it's very light and actually easy to make. 6 lemons for zesting is unnecessary! I buy 2 large ones and that works perfect for zest and juice.

I really liked this! Needed to change a bit based on what I had besides the fresh cilantro. For just 2 of us, I used 20 large frozen cooked shrimp. Put oil in the pan with a minced garlic clove, based on suggestions. Had only 1 lemon, so used that much zest then squeezed the juice.  I liked the idea of adding tomatoes, but only had canned low-salt diced tomatoes.  Served over whole wheat pasta and it was delicious and filling!

Ok, first off - I LOVE Cilantro but this recipe calls for WAY more than necessary in my book. I cut the recipe in half and still could not find the seafood for the green stuff. Next, zesting SIX lemons, and only juicing ONE leaves you with a bunch of naked lemons in the fridge waiting to just go to waste.  So, if you make this recipe, you can get away with 1/4 cup of Cilantro and the zest and juice of two lemons. It still has all of the twang, without the waste.

I kinda took this one out of the park.  I used Chicken instead of shrimp.  I also just used straight lemon juice (probably close to a cup or more) - no zest and dried cilantro.  I used lemon pepper, and just kept adding lemon and a little water so that I had a lot of juice.  I also used about 1 stick of butter and added, diced grape tomatoes (was all I had), artichokes and some capers. I also added a little flour until the sauce thickened up a little bit and served it over linguini. Was Delish!

Wow. This did not turn out as planned. I only had one lemon, so I used the juice and zest from it... and it was WAY TOO LEMONY. The cilantro was great, but it was definitely too much lemon. I am so glad I didn't have MORE lemons to add because it would have been completely inedible. 

I think I'll keep doing shrimp my way, with garlic and olive oil and a touch of butter (maybe add a squeeze of lemon). I'll keep adding the cilantro, though, because we're big fans of it.

Overall the recipe sounded delicious.  While preparing though, the flavor and scent of lemon seemed as if it were going to be too strong.  Unfortunately, I didn't follow my instincts.  The shrimp came out beautifully prepared.  The flavor of lemon on the shrimp was far too strong.  I'd recommend less lemon and cilantro.  The pepper and salt is fine, just watch out for those lemons.

This was pretty awesome! I used the zest of 2 lemons (6 would be overkill, i think) and juice of one.  I used 1 1/2 cups cilantro.  So great, everyone loved it ( hard to find something everyone loves in my family) Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe!  Easy to prepare.  I altered the recipe some based on others' suggestions.  I zested one very large lemon instead of 6.  I also roasted some fresh garlic in the oil before adding the shrimp.  I also added a splash of white wine.  I served it over gluten free pasta.  Dish tasted wonderful and tasted like I'm a more talented chef than I am!

I actually made this twice - the first time, the shrimp I had on hand were 26-30 count, hardly "jumbo", and the proportions seemed off, of course. The second time I used 13-15 count shrimp, and it worked much better. This was also the first time I had ever zested lemons, which I'd been avoiding it for a long time (and I even bought a Microplane grater). The results grew on me with the second batch. It's a somewhat elegantly-tasting dish, and looks attractive. I served it on a bed of pasta (angel hair the first time, I think, and fettucine the second time). So much lemon zest is a little bit unusual to have in a dish, but it worked for me. And I thought 2 cups of cilantro was a lot (I used lightly-packed cups, so one bunch covered both preparations), but it does "cook down" a little. Aside from the slightly-tedious step of zesting 6 lemons, this was a pretty nice recipe!

I found this recipe pretty easy and my husband loved it. Very tasty! I toasted some garlic in oil and then added the shrimp. I used rice instead of pasta and fried it up a little with the shrimp just before it was finished. I also used the zest of 2 lemons, 6 would be overkill in my opinion.

The original recipe would only get three stars; I gave it four with the following changes (based on other reviewers comments):  I used just ONE lemon for the zest and juice, and only ONE small handful of cilantro.  The taste of cilantro is very strong and the amount called for in the original recipe is WAY too much.  I also added 2 garlic cloves (minced), and 6-8 Roma tomatoes, chopped.  I find this is nice over green salad, as recommended, or with "bowtie" pasta.

Great recipe...Since I work I took a short cut in that I used frozen peeled shrimp and put them in at the very last second, turning off the heat and letting them sit in the sauce a bit.  I will certainly make this dish again very soon.

Delicious! I used a pound of medium shrimp instead.  I also only used the zest and juice of 2 lemons. I served it over rice and everyone loved it.

This was great and very fresh tasting!  I did not use allt he lemon zest that was in the recipe.  Put it over a bed of salad and served with corn on the cob and some pesto pasta.  A delish light summer meal!

Very good recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used the zest of one lemon and the juice of half the lemon.  I also added some garlic and only used 1 cup cilantro.  I thought it turned out very good.  I served this over angel hair pasta.  I would make this again.

I thought this was outstanding. Instead of serving it over pasta, I served it over rice. I also added just a little bit of garlic. Delicious

I followed the recipe to the letter.

 Including the zesting of the lemons.

 After all was said and done, I was not a huge fan of this dish. The lemon and cillantro overpowered the shrimp. Way too much cillantro.

 If you dont like the taste of shrimp at all, then this dish is for you. 

 If you do and want to try this recipe then I suggest taking a wedge of lemon and coating it in cillantro and take a bite, just to make sure you are prepared for the taste.

 I also made the mistake of serving this over the wrong pasta. Should have gone Angel Hair.

 If you LOVE cillantro, then this is the dish for you.

My husband and I thought this was wonderful, but I love cilantro!  I did add extra salt to it, just to adjust to my taste.
