Don't feel the quantity was sufficient for a 9X13 pan. Mine didn't even cover the bottom. I think it is better suited for a 8X8 pan. I doubled the recipe so that the fudge when cut would be a little deeper. Very simple to make.

I doubled the recipe because I didn't think it would cover the bottom of the pan. Mine never set up and ended up being a gloppy mess

Very easy recipe and tastes just like cake batter! I used yellow cake mix and can't wait to try it with chocolate!

It's tastes really good. I added walnuts and some chocolate chips. Although they melted, they created a really nice swirl to the fudge. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Easy and tasty!!

I had no problem getting this recipe to set. I doubled the recipe and instead of microwaving, I melted the butter over the stove in a medium pot, poured in cream (instead of milk) and then added the dry ingredients. Mixed it all until smooth and then let set up in a greased and foiled 8x8 dish. Took about 30 minutes to set up in the freezer. I added a picture too! Turned out great!

While pretty dang tasty, this never set. It was more of a sticky caramel consistency. I ended up rolling it into balls and serving them in little mini-cupcake papers. I sprinkled them with sugar and told everyone they were "cake batter caramels". *sigh*

This is super easy to make! We received a last minute communication to bring a dessert to a Christmas party, I was at work, and my husband told me to pick him out a super easy recipe. I stumbled across this one. He had no trouble at all and it turned out delicious -- big hit!

I decided to try this recipe. I cooked the butter and milk in the microwave separated from dry ingredients. I mixed them together with chocolate cake mix and the sugar. I decided to use an 8x8 pan. It set in the refrigerator and was delicious!

Just like Carol, I doubled recipe, was runny, added the confectioner's sugar as suggested still didn't set.  Then I made another batch and the confectioner's sugar "beaded" up?  It's still in fridge, maybe setting up...didn't use as much butter or milk in second batch, only one and half as much more.

No stars. This was disgusting. Tastes nasty. 1/4 inch thickness even when put in a 9x9 pan. Wasted ingredients and time

I made this using Pillsbury Funfetti cake mix. Turned out more like a really soft set caramel or something. It did come out of the pan easy and had a good flavor. Only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1.
