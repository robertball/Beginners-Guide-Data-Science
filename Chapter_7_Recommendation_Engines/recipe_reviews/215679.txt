I made some tweaks only because my 2 zucchini were quite small, and this recipe didn't steer me wrong! I basically halved all the other ingredients, left out zucchini in the stuffing mix, used dried basil (1/2 tsp, plus a 1/2 tsp dried oregano), and left the garlic at the full 3 cloves. We couldn't find just one link of chicken sausage, so we used regular Italian sausage. Oh boy was this tasty! One last tweak, I didn't want to try and use just a part of a can of tomatoes, so I used 1 large Roma tomato, finely diced and tossed it in with the onions to cook them down. Deglazing the pan with chicken broth is a taste booster as well. I can't wait to make this again!

This was delicious! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand that turned out rather well. First, I had Italian zucchini ( we call them hand gernades) so I hollowed them out and stuffed them with the filling. Before placing them in the oven, I brushed the outsides with olive oil. Next, I didn't have chicken sausage so I poached a chicken breast with garlic and onion and shredded it. Then I added Italian seasoning to the mixture since the meat did not have the sausage seasoning. Finally, I was low in parmesan cheese, so I threw in some mazzarella.  They were amazing! My husband doesn't typically like veggies and he loved it! I served it with pasta and tomato sause and garlic bread. I am actually going to be making this again tonight!  Thanks for an awesome dish!

Stuffed Zucchini w/ Chick Sausage Haiku: "This felt 'hors d'oeuvres-ey.' Too much leftover filling. But it was still good." There was something that tasted exceptionally rich about this dish, that made my family and I feel guilty for eating it as an entire meal, and not as a tiny-bite appetizer. It's not that it's unhealthy in the slightest, but it was just very, well, rich. There was also way too much stuffing mixture called for to fill 2 zucchini halves, so I just mashed up what was left and baked "balls" alongside the zucchini. I didn't change anything about the recipe except to bake it longer at a lower temp. I think if I made this again, I'd sub ground beef for the sausage and cheddar for the parm, otherwise, the directions, prep, and end result was pretty tasty.

LOVED THIS!! my whole family enjoyed it (they are big zucchini fans) and the extra crunch from the bread crumbs/parmesan cheese make it so delish. i had a lot of stuffing left, and i followed the measurements exactly. i stuffed 3 zucchinis and only cut up two of the slices of zucchini for the stuffing. i still need to figure out how to calculate the measurements so i won't have so much leftover. i will just be using the leftover for a brunch scramble tomorrow. i also used a diced roma tomato since i didn't want too many juices from canned tomato. i will be making this regularly and more servings! we did not have enough!!

I used this recipe as starting point,but did my own thing. Just scooped out the seeds of the zucchini,but left the rest intact. Used precooked chicken apple sausage,diced in the mix with fresh corn cut from the con. Amazing! The fresh basil is a must. Enjoy :)

Great meal.  I would give this 5 stars, but the directions were confusing.  At the end of the first paragraph it says "Chop up the long slices of Zucchini."  ???  I instead chopped up the flesh I scooped out.

I'm glad I read the reviews that mentioned the amount of leftover stuffing.  I used 4 medium zucchini and the amount of stuffing was perfect.  I also used Italian turkey sausage because that was all i could find.  2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper might be too much for most people, but my husband and I spicy food so it was delicious to us.   This is a KEEPER!

This is an extremely tasty dish but had no idea what size of zucchini to use hence had leftover filling.  Maybe the contributor could enlighten everyone as to the size of the vegetable.   Again, the filling is wonderful.

This was delicious.  The sweet squash was a nice counter to the heat of the pepper.  The only thing I changed was to use squash I found at a fall farmer's market and cut back on the red pepper flakes.  Also, I cut the squash in half, microwaved them for about 7 minutes, covered, with a little water and then stuffed them and baked them for 1/2 hour.  I used this as a main dish, but they were small portions.

Would have been 5 stars but it was way to spicy for me. (I live in Texas but it was still way to spicy for me) I would add a bell pepper and nix the red pepper flakes nest time....That would have been good. You have to microwave the zucchini before you stuff it otherwise its just hard.

This was exceptionally delicious and if I had made it as written would have been just as good.  Our grocery was out of zucchini (really?  who runs out of zucchini) anyway... I substitiuted acorn squash and was worried about the contrast, so I added 1/4 chopped apple.  The only other change I made was to use already diced tomatoes and Bob Evans sausage with sage.  WOW, was this good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this as a side dish for a dinner party.  We all really liked this.  I cooked the zucchini in oven for 10 minutes with olive oil before adding remaining ingredients and used 1 tsp of dry basil since I didn't have any fresh basil on hand.

This was so good! I used a spicy italian turkey sausage and then omitted the red pepper flakes. I also used halved cherry tomatoes instead of the canned ones. Thanks for the delicious, easy, and nutritious recipe!

What a delicious and easy dish.  I used 3 sausages and had extra filling that I just heated in the pan with the zucchini and ate as well.

very nice recipe.  different from the usual pork sausage.  easy.  plenty of stuffing for each shell.  only thing I changed was doubling the recipe and adding pesto to the stuffing.  started off at 350 for 25 minutes then to 400 for another 25 .  stuffing was hot and shell was cooked .  We like spicy hot so normally would have used  the amount of red pepper flakes called for but was making this dish with other people in mind that dont like things too spicy ..used half the amount and it  had a nice little bite .  Served with pasta

Absolutely delicious!  The grocery store only had really small zucchini so I used summer squash otherwise stuck to the recipe, after reading other reviews I bought extra squash. My family heated up the leftovers in the microwave the next day and they ate it all. I have made this recipe several times, we love it!! Thank You Christine!!

This was really good and VERY easy.  I put the leftover stuffing into a separate dish and baked it at the same time.  My very picky kids didn't care for the zucchini, but finished off the extra stuffing!

These were tasty and I stayed pretty true to the original recipe: I used regular Italian sausage (I just can't with chicken and turkey sausage; I've tried and tried to like it and just don't) and I used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes that I already had on hand. I read reviews that the zucchini boats were too hard/not done so I put them EMPTY in a pre-heated oven in a foil covered pan for 25 minutes until they were fork tender, then I stuffed them, then popped them in for another 15 minutes.  I'm low carbing it, so next time I think I'll try cooked quinoa instead of bread crumbs. We'll see how that goes!

the filling was tasty, but really gooey, and the baking time wasn't nearly long enough. after 35 minutes, the zukes were still hard. this might be better without the breadcrumbs, and baked covered with a little water in to bottom to steam the squash, but i didn't like it well enough to try it again.

I absolutely love this recipe. Great by itself or served with a side of pasta. As others have written, the filling makes more than can fit in 2 zuccini, probably closer to 4.  Next time I'm going to try to use the stuffing in peppers!

This was REALLY good!  My husband and I both really liked it.  Great for the summertime.  The filling stayed moist and the zucchini cooked perfectly.  One thing I did differently--I used a can of already diced tomatoes, and I had some left over sliced mushrooms that I roughly chopped and threw in, too.  I was able to fill 4 zucchini (8 halves) with the filling.  Will make it again!

These were okay overall, and the filling by itself was very good. I didn't blanch the zucchini beforehand, which was a mistake. It made it difficult to scoop out the flesh and my family complained about the zucchini being undercooked. I will parboil next time and I think this recipe will be a winner! As a side, I sauteed the extra squash flesh with a little butter and fresh herbs and it was excellent!

So incredibly delicious!  I did microwave the zucchini to soften it up. I have quite a bit of extra stuffing, but I plan to eat it over noodles or rice maybe.  This has great flavor!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

REALLY good! We added spaghetti sauce to the top for the kids. Then, we loved it and do it with ours too. It was A VERY hot day. So, i put foil on a baking sheet and bake on indirect heat on the BBQ. Worked amazing. I will be making these again and again. What a great was to get the family to eat veggies!

We really liked this! I used a good vegan Italian sausage and it was delicious. Then I shredded the zucchini pulp and used it in the Blueberry Zucchini Bread recipe from this site.  Healthy, easy, and no waste--perfection!

Amazing! Made it for the family and couldn't keep the little one out of it. Probably shouldn't have made her the "Taste Tester"...Definitely going to make it in a smaller version as an appetizer for parties.

Excellent taste and an easy way to get a vegetable into my diet.  I substituted Thin N Trim chicken sausage to reduce the fat and Whole wheat bread crumbs for a little more fiber. and low salt diced tomatoes for less sodium.  Easily a 5 star receipe.  Thanks

This was delish.  I did like others suggested and microwaved the zucchini after I sliced a little off the top lengthwise for 7 minutes.  I also used 1 can Rotel and added Portobello mushrooms, panko and topped with fresh mozzarella.  Play around with the recipe, its very good!

I made this last night out of one HUGE zucchini that had been hiding in my garden.  I had three links of  hot Italian sausage in  the freezer so I used it. I didn't need the 1 tablespoon of crushed red pepper that I added, but it was still good, though a little spicy.  Taking the advice of other reviewers who said the zucchini didn't get soft enough in 35 minutes, I microwaved both the chopped and the "boated" zucchini (separately) for a couple of minutes. My zucchini was so large, that it helped to steam the boats for a minute or two in the suggested chicken broth. And in response to the reviewer who said the stuffing was gooey, I was careful not to overmix it, and for the last 5 minutes of baking, I upped it to 390 degrees to make sure I got the crunch. This one is a keeper. Oh, in terms of what size and number of zucchini to use, just base it on the number of people you need to feed, and adjust the proportions of ingredients accordingly.  My huge zucchini, which would have fed at least four people, worked well with the proportions listed, although I did use three links of sausage (mainly because I just wanted to use it up).

I make a variation of this recipe.  This is a great way to use those giant zucchinis you didn't see growing in the garden. I cut in half, scoop out the seeds and nuke for a couple of minutes to soften a but.  Then stuff with sausage. Put in casserole and top with stewed or crushed tomatoes and cheese and bake until zucchini gets soft, around 30-45 minutes.  Not a favorite of my husband's but he'll eat it. I have assembled this the night before and baked when I got home from work.

With 4  teens I'm not looking for a light dinner.  1st I found 3 really big zucchini.  2nd preheated oven, put in potatoes to bake on 1 side of rack.  They were halfway done when the zucchini was assembled & that pan went on the other half of the rack.  With the mandatory salad this turned into a very filling dinner with no leftovers.  Quick, easy & delicious.  Thanks for submitting.

Easy and yummy! Great as a meal all by itself.  I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I just sprinkled in some cayenne pepper.  And as for the " big dilemma" of too much stuffing, just use an extra zucchini??(as I did-after reading reviews).

This is such a simple and delicious meal! Even my veggie-resistant boyfriend loved it and requested we have it again soon. I modified the recipe a bit based on what we had at home -- bulk mild Italian sausage and dried herbs. We also added more garlic since we're big time garlic lovers in our household

It was a 98 degree day when i decided to try this recipe.  Instead of heating up the oven, I put the stuffed zucchini in a baking pan on indirect medium heat on the grill.  I would use less crushed red pepper - a little too much heat - or none at all.  Very good flavor!!

Good flavor, but the stuffing does make way more than the amount that goes in the zucchini, so it the leftover stuffing ended up getting tossed.  I would either try to find another use for stuffing or plan on getting more zucchinis in order to not waste so much stuffing.

These were ok. They were great for a light meal (I paired with a cup of soup). Everyone ate them, but I just wasn't as "wowed" as I'd hoped to be. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious and very filling.  I used spicy ground sausage since I had it on hand.  I also had a little extra mixture, but just baked it in the pan also.  I will make this again.

Since many reviewers said there was a lot of stuffing for two zucchini, I made this with three.  The amount of stuffing was generous, but that's the way I wanted it.  I have to say that for a largely vegetable meal this was really good.  There is a lot of flavor packed into the stuffing.  We had this just with a multi-grain loaf and it was a satisfying meal for two, with a little left over.  I did make one other change and used a diced fresh tomato instead of canned, and I had to bake the zucchini for a good 10-15 minutes longer than stated.  I wanted to make sure the zucchini was crisp-tender, not just crisp.

This was really good.  I used mild italian sausage and everyone loved this dish.  I cut down on the red pepper flakes and added mild cheddar cheese along with the parm.  Will make again.

One zucchini is not enough for two people with the ingredients made for the suffing.  Iwould leave out the red pepper flakes.  Certainly worth trying again.

I love this recipe!  I'll use small yellow squash or zucchini so everyone gets a whole squash and at the end of baking I will melt a slice of provolone or mozzerella over each. Add crusty bread and  a glass of vino and you have a meal!

Very tasty, but there is way too much stuffing.  I sprinkled some Parmesan on top last few minutes of baking.  I agree it would also make a nice appetizer.

This is one of the few recipes from this site I actually tweak considerably. But boy, is it a gem! Impressive enough for company (everyone I’ve served it to asks for the recipe), yet still devoured by my 1, 2.5 and 4 year old. My major change is substituting ground chicken for the sausage. I brown a pound of chicken, pour off any liquid, add a cup of water and a few teaspoons of dry Italian dressing mix (you can make or buy the packet). I then simmer until the liquids cooked off. In terms of quantities, I use 3 zucchini and double everything else. You will have extra “stuffing,” but I toss this with about half a pound of whatever pasta I have on hand and just bake that along with the zucchini boats. I top both the zucchini and the pasta with additional bread crumbs and pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese, whatever I have on hand. This is a winner. I do make my own bread crumbs because our family avoids added sugars. While not necessary, this obviously improved e recipe. I just cube our day old sourdough, toss it with olive oil and Italian Ali was and toast it in the oven, then run it through the food processor. Serve these with a fresh baguette and company is wowed! Feed your kids the pasta. ;)

Cook the onions a bit first off then add the chicken sausage and chopped garlic. You do not have to cook the sausage all the way through as you are going to bake it in the oven for 30 minutes! Cook the zucchini in a cookie sheet in the bit of tomato water drained from the tomatoes. Add some shredded mozzarella cheese on top prior to baking. I was not impressed. Even though I had cooked the zucchini boats before stuffing the squash was still not really cooked through!!!

This was sooooo delicious! I made a couple changes. I couldn’t find chicken sausage at my store, so I used Italian turkey sausage. Also, instead of making zucchini boats, I just cut the zucchini up and put it all in little Dutch ovens. This was a smash hit in my house. Super impressed. Thanks!

We liked this. I wanted to use it as a main dish, so I purposefully chose larger zucchini at the market. Also, I simply cut the larger zucchini in halves and hollowed them out to make “boats”.  I followed the recipe other than the fact that I used Italian pork sausages rather than chicken. It was a different sort of taste. It was good, but I thought it was still lacking something.

This was really good! Because my zucchini weren’t that big I just chopped them all up, used fresh tomatoes and Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan. Baked it just like a casserole with a little extra cheese on top!  It’s a great low carb main meal!!

It tasted great, but only gave it four stars because I changed the cooking format.  Since my zucchini was small, I realized the "boats" were not going to really work.  Instead, I sliced zucchini length-wise and then chopped cross-wise to make half moon shaped pieces.  I then put everything in a pan and sautéed it on the stove like you would a stir fry.  I used canned diced tomatoes, which were fine, though it added a lot of liquid.  (Next time I may try fresh tomatoes.)  Also used dried basil as I didn't have fresh. Threw in fresh roasted garlic at the end and it tasted great.  Skipped the bread crumbs, but didn't forget the grated cheese at the end.  Will make again.

I made this with Mighty Spark pork sausage/prosciutto. I also used my own tomato sauce which is a little spicy. I cut the zucchini in half (rather than a slick) and it’s scrumptious.

I made a similar recipe, but used loose sausage instead of chicken. I didn't use the tomatoes in the filling. Instead I topped the zucchini with tomatoes sauce and mozzarella. Don't forget to hollow out the seeds from the zucchini. 
I'm sure the chicken version is equally as tasty, but a much ' liter' version. I would like it, but hubby doesn't care for ground chicken or turkey.

tweaks just a few for starters I only had hot Italian Sausage so that's what I used...I omitted the crushed red pepper... by the time I was done making the stuffing mix it was too much for the zucchini boats so I put it in a casserole dish topped it off with Italian panko bread crumbs and shredded parmesan cheese...baked it till the cheese melted served it with buttered pasta...delish will definitely make again...by the way I cut up the boats and blanched and froze them for another meal

I used 3 sausage links (mozzarella & roasted garlic), used all of the zucchini in the filling, used diced tomatoes (with basil and oregano), added 1/4 cup of mozzarella and about 1/2  cup marinara sauce. It definitely took more than 20 minutes to prep., and an extra 15 minutes to bake,  but I will make this again.

Recipe is somewhat confusing. But decided to chop some of the zucchini & it made enough for 2 large zucchini’s. My hand got a little heavy on the chili flakes, which my husband really enjoyed. I would certainly make this again.

This turned out beautifully, picture perfect, baked it on the grill. However with 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes-it was inedible. Luckily we have a frozen pizza on hand.

Absolutely delicious. I cut the red pepper down to 1 teaspoon, and next time I will probably cut it down even more, it was a bit spicy. Otherwise this recipe is a keeper

I really liked this recipe, but the amount of stuffing was far more than the number of zucchini boats called for. I would double the amount of zucchini boats to match the amount of stuffing!

I loved this! Simple and easy to add or substitute. I put some of the stuffing in a green pepper and baked with the rest. (Hubby likes stuffed peppers)

This has been a go-to recipe for me for YEARS now.  A little heavy on the chopping and scooping but worth every second.  Hubby requests it often too.  I usually over-stuff them and include the scooped zucchini into the stuffing mix.  I bake the extra in a small dish (it never goes to waste!).

This is a great basic recipe that I've made twice, and my husband liked it (not being a veggie man! :) However, I did make some changes  as follows:
Used 1 lb. Pork or Italian sausage (and no olive oil to fry up)
Substituted shredded cheddar cheese for parmesan
Did not use bread crumbs, and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes. Also,  we grow hot peppers, so used fresh instead of red pepper flakes (although those work well too.)  When preparing the zucchini (mine were 14" and 16")
I microwaved the basic "boat" (after I cut the top off) , without ingredients for 7 minutes before loading it up and putting it in the oven. Sprinkled about 3/4 cup shredded cheese on top and baked as the recipe calls for. 
This is a winner! Esp. when you're trying to use up zucchini and tired of baking  --z. bread...!

This is very flavorful and delicious! I used Sweet Italian sausage, cut the pepper flakes in half (still had quite a kick!) and used 1/2 can of tomatoes. Cutting lengthwise slices from the zucchini was bit confusing so they were not perfect boats. That's why I cut the tomatoes in half so the filling would not be runny.   Perfect consistency and the right amount of filling. Loved it!

Delicious and easy but makes an impressive presentation. I used 3 regular spicy Italian sausage and 2.5 fresh tomatoes for 6 zucchini halves. I also used both halves of each zucchini as a boat and put the zucchini insides right into the filling. I would say this recipe makes about twice the amount of filling for the zucchini listed so next time will make less. I also did have to bake for about 10-15 minutes longer to tenderize the zucchini so I think I might sprinkle some water in the pan and cover next time for the first half of cooking to steam/soften then uncover to crisp up the filling.

I made this last night for my wife and I.  I used Turkey Sausage instead and doubled the stuffing ingredients.  Along with the baked stuffed zucchini I had another dish with stuffing about 1" thick with extra Parmesan cheese on it.  It turned out wonderful and was a good meal all in itself.

I tweeked it a little. My chicken sausage is a little spicy so I left out the red pepper and I knew the filling was a lot so I used 4 zucchini instead of 2 and I topped it with mozzarella cheese the last couple minutes of cooking. DELICIOUS! Will definitely make again!

Perfect for those gigantic zucchinis from the garden!  I cut off 1/4 of the zucchini,  so that it was more "canoe" shaped and held the stuffing better. I scraped most of the flesh out, leaving enough to hold it's shape. The zucchini canoe/shells were then cooked in the microwave until soft; upside down with plastic wrap. After chopping the onion, garlic, and zucchini, I sauteed that until there was some browning, and not much moisture; at least 15 minutes. I added canned, chopped tomatoes, and drained out all of the liquid. When the zucchinis were cooked and cooled a bit, I soaked up extra moisture with paper towels before stuffing them.  I followed the recipe for the remaining process. The time in the oven helped dry out some moisture, and add a crispy top.

I had 4 chicken sausage with olives and feta cheese and didn't know what to do with them to make a meal. My 2 zucchinis were small and had blemishes on them so I couldn't use them as boats. I sliced up the sausages into 1/4" thick and also sliced the zucchinis. Prepared it pretty much as per recipe but cut the red pepper flakes in half. It turned out a tiny bit spicy but my daughter likes it spicy. I prepared it in an oven-safe skillet then put it into oven for a little bit to melt moz. cheese on top. Also, I used 2 Roma tomatoes instead of canned. It was very tasty and was easier than using zucchini boats. I'd like to find something else to substitute for the plain breadcrumbs but overall it was good.

I have made this a few times.  Its a good recipe; however, the recipe as written doesnt quite work.  Either increase the number of zucchini, or reduce the amount of filling. As written, its a total mismatch.  Also, the time allowed for baking is a little lean. I recommend 40 minutes weather than 3o.

I have made this several times...I only scoop out mid section of seeds, leaving zucchini pretty much in tack with flesh.  I usually do 2 large or 4 small zucchini's (or 4-6 halves) as left overs are great reheated.  I use diced tomatoes (just lazy)...I use any onion on hand & add some dried oregano & "dried" basil & use more Parmesan than called for.  I cut back on the red pepper  flakes...seemed a bit too hot first time. This is a really easy recipe & great for guests.

This was amazing.  Light but filling.  I do agree that the directions were kind of vague with how to handle the zucchini layers.  I just chopped the zucchini I scooped out and put it aside for zucchini bread.  My husband raved about it, and for a change, we didn't have pasta (although this filling would be great over pasta or rice as well).

This is a terrific and delicious recipe.  I was a bit cautious about using 2 tsp. Red pepper flakes so I only used 1/2 tsp.  It was still good and spicy.  My husband raved about it and we've also served it three times to guests who have loved it, as well.  Each time, I have used mild Italian sausage instead of the chicken sausage.  The recipe makes plenty of stuffing.  If I have too much, I just make a small foil "boat" and cook the extra stuffing in that along with the stuffed zucchini.  - Ruth in MO

Very yummy idea for fall zucchinis. I used spicy ground Italian sausage instead of chicken sausage for some extra kick. They were great as left-overs the next day too.

This recipe is a great way to use zucchini when we have it in abundance! I used a very large zucchini, so i ended up needing to bake it a little bit longer so it wasn't crunchy.  My husband also requested a fried egg on top of his, so i made a little divot in the toppings (necessary, since the first one i tried fell off) and cracked an egg on top before baking. It turned out yummy!

Given all of the reviews about there being too much spice and filling, I adjusted accordingly.  I used 3 large squash and cut them in half so I was able to use up all of the mixture (baked plain for about 12 mins to soften them, as suggested).  I too was confused with the directions to cut 3/4 slices, so instead used some of the flesh and the ends.  I like spicy foods (not super spicy) so I bought hot & spicy Italian chicken sausage and only used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  This was hot enough for me.  If I had bought sweet Italian sausage, I would have used about 1 tbsp.  2 tbsp would have been overkill. Grilled them for about 25 mins. Very tasty, will make again.

This was just wonderful...I used summer squash fresh from the garden. Followed the recipe pretty closely but substuted hot turkey sausage for the chicken sausage. It just adds more punch. Also used chopped fresh tomato instead of canned tomato...like others I had extra stuffing which was a blessing..stuffed heirloom tomatoes which had been scooped out (used the center for stuffing)...will certainly make this again..very versatile.

This is one of my go-to ways to prepare zucchini from my garden. If you follow the recipe with no changes, you will like it; if you have other ingredients you want to try, you now have the basis for making it your own.  Thanks, Chrisine for posting it!

This was delicious, only thing I would do different is to soften the zucchini prior to baking. The stuffing was so yummy!

If you like your zucchini cooked a bit softer you can bake them empty for a few minutes.

This was delicious! The only change I made was halving the red pepper, which is still very spicy so alter depending on your tastes. I used 2 extremely big zucchini and still had leftover stuffing. I followed another reviewer's recommendation and made it into little balls which were also yummy. Definitely a must try!

My husband and I thought this was really good. However, I added the full amount of crushed red pepper called for and found it to be almost too spicy for me (and I like a lot of spice) and definitely too spicy for my two-year-old. I'd make this again but will cut back on the red pepper next time.

I made this last night - it was delish! I was in a rush and totally forgot about the bread crumbs, parmesan, and basil - but it was so good even without them.  The only complaint I have is that the zucchini took way longer to cook than is stated in directions.  I also had quite a bit of stuffing left over so I took a small zucchini from our garden and sliced it in rounds (they were about the size of a quarter), sprayed the inside of a small baking dish with non-stick olive oil spray, and then placed some stuffing in first then layered the slices, and some shredded 4 cheese Italian blend cheese, stuffing, zucchini, cheese, repeated until the stuffing mix was all gone.  I then added some cheese on top and popped it into the oven with the zucchini boat.  I baked the boat for 1 hour and it still wasn't as soft as I'd like it to be and the top was browning so I removed it from the oven and covered with aluminum foil for a few minutes while I set the table and whipped up some garlic bread.  By the time we finished our salads, the zucchini had softened a bit, but not quite enough.  It was so yummy and everyone ate all that was on their plates, even my zucchini hating 14 yr old daughter.  My husband, he's not a big fan of zucchini either, actually finished off the boat and asked it there was any more.  He ate all that was in the bowl!!  He said he preferred the layered method much better than the zucchini boat method, so that's how I'll make it in the future. Thank You Christine!! :0

I made this for my husband and myself today.  I thought the directions were a little confusing about taking a 3/4" lengthwise slice from each zucchini.  If I make this again, I will split  each zucchini in half and trim good sized pieces from the ends and use those for the filling.  

I followed the directions exactly, but only put half the red pepper in the recipe and not any salt in the filling.

I must say that I LOVE hot, spicy food, but even with half the pepper, it was so hot, I could barely eat it and my husband stopped after two bites.  He was really unhappy that he couldn't eat the zucchini because it tasted delicious other than the heat from the red pepper. Next time, I may eliminate entirely or put a 1/4 tsp. in.   I was going to use jalapeno chicken sausage and was fortunate I didn't.  I used sweet sausage instead.  Can you imagine how hot it would have been with the hotter sausage.  I really think this would make a very impressive dinner.  It was very filling, but I did think it was only two servings.

I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  It was a lot of sausage for me, so I will half it next time.

Every time I make a recipe off of this site, it yields way more that the recipe says.  Here it calls for two zucchini; I ended up halving 6 (to make 12 'boats') in order to use all of the stuffing mix.  I just put them in the oven so hopefully they will turn out tasty.

Easy recipe to follow and the zucchini came out juicy and soft.  I set the stuffed zucchini on a bed of rice and it was delicious.  I will be making this again!

As Rock_lobster suggested, I do use ground beef for a similar stuffed zucchini.  (Ground chicken or turkey  would be another alternative.)  I cut the zucchini in half lengthwise and scoop out the center.  This would result in smaller portions.  I also use spaghetti sauce instead of the tomatoes and use only about a cup of the sauce.  I use the remaining sauce (as much as you would like) and pour over the zucchini after it is stuffed.  It can also be topped with some shredded mozzarella or provolone cheese.  I'm anxious to try the chicken sausage version.

This was a good base recipe. Next time I think I might leave out the tomatoes, they seemed to overpower the dish, and test out a few different seasonings, since it seemed to be lacking something. You can definitely experiment with a dish like this. Have added it to my list of recipes to make again in the future.

Great recipe! Even my two year old enjoyed it (she liked the stuffing... still working on eating veggies). We are stationed in Germany and I couldn't find chicken sausage so I used sweet italian sausage and it turned out great. After reading previous reviews, I decided to prepare 3 zucchinis instead of 2, but there was still LOTs of stuffing left over. Thankfully, I had two yellow bell peppers in the fridge. I used the remaining stuffing for the peppers. I would suggest that if you only want to make 3 zucchinis, use 1/2 amount of each ingredient listed. If you use the listed measurements, you can get about 5-6 medium zucchinis stuffed. I also cut out the olive oil- I have non-stick pans and the sausage made it's own juices and oil. I also added diced bell peppers (red, green, and yellow). I would recommend this recipe to friends!

My husband and I loved this recipe, but we had a tom of extra stuffing and so I just used more zucchinis. The zucchini boat was tender crisp, just the way we like it after baking. We topped it with a little extra Parmesan, a glass of wine and Voila, a tasty supper.

I made a lighter version of this . Less Oil. Added low fat mozzerella. Had enough stuffing for 7 full zucchini's. (14 halfs) They are easy and delicious. Re-heats well in microwave.

Yummy!  I made a vegetarian version with Italian Soysage.  I would cook it for 45 minutes next time to have the zucchini be more tender.
