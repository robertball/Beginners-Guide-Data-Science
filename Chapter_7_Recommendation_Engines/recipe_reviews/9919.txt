I could tell from the ingredients and the reviews that I would like this cookie.  But I made several changes and got wonderful results.  I used 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter.  I decreased the rolled oats to 2 cups and added a bag of Reese's peanut butter chips.  I dropped the cookies (generously rounded teaspoonsful) rather than rolling them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  What great cookies!

These cookies looked easy to bake...so I baked them. I didn't have very high expectations on these cookies -  meaning I thought they would be OK. But when I took the first bite... there was a sensation of heaven. If this review doesn't help you choose the right cookie, I don't know which one will! Happy Cooking!

This is an excellent cookie recipe.  Not too sweet even with the addition of the chocolate on top.  The amount of oatmeal makes these a healthier cookie as well.  The peanut butter flavour is mild so the added peanuts on top is a must.  I found 9 minutes to be perfect.

I didn't even get as far as putting the chocolate icing on. These cookies are amazing! One of the best I've made this year. I'm sure their off the charts with the chocolate on top!

I really like this combination oatmeal cookie and peanut butter cookie.  That said I didn't have time or enough chocolate chips to follow all the instructions. 

I converted this to a drop cookie by omitting the water and only using 2 cups of oatmeal.  Instead of adding more peanut butter, I added a half teaspoon of salt.  I needed to be as speedy as possible today so I just missed the chocolate chips in.  Yum!  The cookies are still have plenty of oatmeal but they may be a little cakey the way I made them.  I like the because they make such a healthy after school snack with milk.

This is a good cookie recipe.  To simplify things, I spread the batter in a jelly roll pan and baked about 15-20 minutes.  It turned out really well as bars but I ran out of frosting this way so I will probably double the frosting next time.

These cookies were good.  I did not want to put water in the cookies, so I left it out.  After the first batch they were a little dry.  I added some milk, and that helped.  I would probably add more peanut butter and less oats.  The oats overpower the peanut butter.  The chocolate icing helped make the cookies very tasty.  I will make again with the above changes.

No one in our family liked this recipe.  The cookies were very pastey tasting & they had little peanut butter flavor.  The cookies were not sweet enough even with the sugar in the recipe & the sugar from the pressing & even with the chocolate on the top.  The texture wasn't good either, very dense.

I am always trying different cookie recipes, my husband says these are the best yet. I used roughly chopped chunks of chocolate instead of chips & I didn't even bother with the chocolate topping. They were gone in a day!

I had my niece & nephew over and wanted to bake cookies for them with what I had on hand.  They came out great.  Real easy to prepare. Will make them again.
Thanks

Delicious cookie! I made a few changes...I added 1/2 C. flour so it wouldn't require refrigeration, and added the chocolate chips directly to the recipe rather than frosting them.  Perfectly soft and delicious!

These cookies were amazing!  I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews and added ½ cup more peanut butter, ¼ cup more flower, reduced oatmeal to 2 cups and a bag of Recees peanut butter chips.  I wanted them to be more peanut buttery than oatmeal.  While I was making them my husband said not to make too many because he wasn’t sure he would like them because of the oatmeal (always reluctant to try something new :-)).  Then after he had some, I was telling our daughter to take a bag to work he stopped us & said ‘don’t give them all away’.  He loved them!  They are soft and chewy in the middle and not too sweet, but I think the peanut butter chips made a big difference.

These are the driest, most crumbly peanut butter cookies I've ever had. I like my homemade cookies soft and chewy, so I am sure I will not make these again.

We really liked these.  Didn't do the drizzle, but did add 1/2 c. pb chips based on reviewers suggestions that the batter was not peanut buttery enough.  Added 1 1/2 cup choc chips to the batter also- really delicious.

I skipped the chocolate topping, but mixed in the chocolate chips (used 1 cup chocolate chips and about 1/4 cup peanut butter chips) and these cookies were absolutely FANTASTIC. I actually only made 28 cookies, large drop style cookies (baked about 11.5 - 12 minutes per batch on non-stick baking sheets). Everyone gave these BIG thumbs up. This is definitely going in my "keeper" pile! (I followed the ingredients list exactly as written, and I thought the texture adn teh peanut butter flavor was PERFECT. With how thick I made them, they came out lightly browned, with lightly crisp edges and soft and tender in the middle.)
