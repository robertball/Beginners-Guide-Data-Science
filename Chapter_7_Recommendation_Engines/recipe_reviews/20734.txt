Wonderful recipe! Who doesn't love something homemade? For some reason homemade just seems to taste better. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix and you could easily sub some craisins for the raisins and add nuts such as pecans or walnuts. Not only is this nice to have on hand, but for me this recipe is a definite keeper to place inside jars for "breakfast themed" baskets to give away at the holidays. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great way to make a hot breakfast very INEXPENSIVE, very HEALTHY and very EASY. I double the recipe and we only eat 1/2 cup serving each morning so it lasts for 2 weeks. I mix it in a 2 gallon freezer bag. I've added walnuts and/or almonds to give it more texture. **Update, I recently started adding 3 t. cinnamon and 1 c. wheat germ to the double batch. Much more flavor and sticks with you longer.

I put the oats in the blender a little at a time and use 1/2 c. cereal and about 3/4 c. boiling water.  Comes out more like the store bought instant.

This is a great mix!  I hate the little envelopes of instant oatmeal because my son will eat at least 2 in one sitting and they are gone in a couple of days!  With this mix you can pick the flavors you want and the portion you want for a lot less $$$.  I skipped the raisins (my son's orders;) and added roasted/chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of wheat germ and about 1 tsp cinnamon.  I found that adding 1cup water to 1cup oats and cooking it in the microwave for 2.30min made the results that I like (nice and thick and ready for me to add butter, milk, or maple syrup without having soup!)

I love this recipe!  Really you can put in any type of fruit and/or seasoning you want.  I have a dehydrator so I dehydrated strawberries and put them in.  My kids are too young to know the difference between this and the store bought stuff.  Be forewarned, the texture of this oatmeal compared to store bought oatmeal is VERY different, heavier.  But much cheaper and you control what goes in...

I doubled the amount of brown sugar.  I also added chopped roasted pecans.  To do this, I put the pecans on a cookie sheet and cooked them at 350 for about 8 minutes.  I filled quart baggies, put them in a cute bowl and wrapped all with cellophane to give away as a Christmas gift.  Looked cute!

This is a good recipe - but not for diabetics. It has about 40 net carbs versus only 6 grams of protein, which means that the pancreas will be producing much more insulin than glucogan. In type 2 diabetes, studies have shown that pumping out more insulin to process carbohydrates than glucogan to process protein can lead to high insulin levels in the blood and more insulin resistant cells.

I love this! Way better than the packaged oatmeal. I like to mix Craisins in with the raisins. I also add a heaping T of my homemade pumpkin pie spice from this site. I even use the old fashioned oats. I leave a baggie full in the fridge at work & always have a healthy, warm, filling breakfast! Thanks!

I am rating this recipe quite low because it is so bland and without a lot of additions I would not have eaten it (I tried). Here is what I did to bring it up to a 4 or maybe even 5 star recipe in my book: added 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1/2 cup dried apple bits, 2 additional tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and substituted dried cranberries for the raisins (personal preference for that one). Basically it is a compilation of all the other suggestions already posted - thanks everyone! If you do tend to add sugar, honey or maple syrup to your cereal the extra sugar probably isn't necessary.

I love this. In addition to the raisins, I also added dried unsweetened cherries. MMMM...
I think I might add some spice to it today though. If you find it rather bland, add some salt, a pinch at a time directly to your bowl. Remember, salt is a flavoring agent/enhancer. The salt will help it to not be bland. If you are on a low salt/no salt, then I don't know what to tell you. However you make it, enjoy it.

I used the recipe exactly with the exception of the raisins.  I wanted to be able to make different varieties of oatmeal depending on my mood and didn't think it would greatly affect the main dish.  I think this is a fantastic base and will definitely become a staple at our house.  The only thing I want to mention is that you will need to add more brown sugar and water than specified.  I couldn't taste any sweetness at all but I prefer that for my base.  That way it can be changed for personal preference.  The water amount was fine to start but after five minutes or so it was gummy and hard.    My son likes to eat it in the car to school so we will have to put more water so it stays creamy.  Add In Tips: Cinnamon, Sliced Almonds, Sugared Pecans, Dried Cranberries, Dried Apricots chopped, Sauteed Apple Pieces, Maple Syrup, Caramel Trail Mix...the list goes on and on.

My kids are serious Quaker instant junkies.  I made this and thought it tasted ok, but they cried every morning until I bought the instant oatmeal again.  Too bad!

This is perfect oatmeal in the mornings. I put the oatmeal mixture into the bowl and add some water then heat in the microwave until it's cooked and then I'll add some milk to get it to a thinner consistency and will heat that in the microwave. May add more milk to take away the stickiness. Extra brown sugar and bananas are added. Very nice. I love it!
