This is a marvelous salad! So good and the crunch makes it! The only change I made was that I used light soy sauce instead of regular because it's what I prefer. I make a salad similar to this, so I'd like to give a few tips:  1) Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to crumble the ramen noodles into smaller pieces before opening the packet.  2) There is a fine line between cooking the noodle mixture perfectly and cooking it too long. Stir often and watch it as it browns!  3) Do not put the noodles or dressing on the salad until ready to serve and eat.  4) Cut the recipe down to the number of people you will be serving. Leftovers become soggy and don't taste as good.

3.7.16   Had some bean sprouts in the fridge, so I threw some of them into the baby bok choy.  I’d recommend that you really break up the ramen noodles.  Seriously, I like crunchy, but I found even the small chunks of the ramen noodles just too hard and dry (hubby agreed). I could see adding a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to this salad, as well as some red bell pepper strips to give it a pop of color.  I used half the amount of sugar in the dressing (personal taste preference) and added a little soy sauce to the crunchies (trying to soften a bit).  Really liked the flavor of this salad, just wish the crunchies were a little less “crunchy,” but that can be taken care of.

Loved this! I had some bok choy in the fridge that needed to be used up, and I'm so glad I found this recipe. The only thing I changed was I used a bit of sliced red onion in place of the green onions, as I didn't have any. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved everything about this salad!  The dressing was the perfect complement to the bok choy and green onions and the crispy noodles gave it the perfect crunch.   I added some grilled salmon to the salad the next day for lunch and it was even better.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious salad. The only caution I would make is notmto make the ramen noodel mixture ahead. I did that, thinking it would save time at serving time, but the mixture hardened and was difficult to break up. Still good though.

I knew someone who used to make this and I finally found the right recipe!  I use splenda in the dressing but do still use the cane sugar to make the crunchies.  I use low-sodium soy sauce.  This is such a delicious salad, on of my very favorites.

mmm,mmm,mmm!  I am eating the leftovers from last night & I'm still loving this salad!  (Someone said it didn't keep well, I must disagree.)   Really fast & easy, we had it with grilled chicken and because of the noodles we didn't even have another side & it was a very nice supper. Oh, I went 1/2&1/2 balsamic & red wine vinegar just because i love balsamic, I'm sure it would be fantastic exactly as written too.  That was the only thing that I changed tho.  Thank you Heather \\m//

Fast and easy! My mother, who generally doesn't enjoy new things, gave it two thumbs up.  I substituted sesame oil for the seeds, because she can't eat sesame seeds.  My parrot liked it too!

Great salad!  I had LOTS of romaine on hand so I used that instead of Bok Choy.  Also added sugar snap peas. It turned out good - took the salad to a family dinner and it was all raves.

I didn’t have sesame seeds so used pine nuts. Worked fine. Did add more bok choy as there was more dressing and noodles than greens. Will make again!

We grow Bok Choy as it is supposed to be very healthy. I liked this recipe except for the super salty taste. I will make it again without including the Ramen Noodle soup  seasoning packets. I think the soy sauce might be enough to add some saltiness without the overkill that those little sodium bomb packets provide.

I made this because I had no idea what Bok Choy was and it came in my CSA veggie box for the week. I was skeptical of anything with Ramen in it, but I liked the sesame, almond, crunch mixture and the light flavor of the cabbage and green onions. I will make it again. The dressing is also good, tasty. (not sure how to make it “lite” since it has sugar in it, that will be a project.)

I think this is a delicious salad.  Because of my experience with ramen salads similar to  this in the past, I've learned to add the sesame seeds the last minute or two with the ramen and almonds to keep them from getting over browned.  I also whisked the packet of seasoning from the ramen into the dressing instead of adding it to the ramen and almond mixture.  Last time I bit into chunks of seasoning which had been added to the ramen in the frying pan.  This way it dissolved completely and I got only the flavor and no chunks.
