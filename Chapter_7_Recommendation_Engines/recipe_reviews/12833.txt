The only problem I felt these had was the need for a great deal more chili sauce, I added to taste.  I also added shredded carrot and sesame seeds to mine.

The kids hated it... I liked the flavors of the tuna and chili sauce with the cream cheese, but I didn't like them with tortillas.  Using chili sauce with tuna is a good idea for future recipes, though.

This was a good recipe.  I altered it a bit using 2/3 cup of chili instead of 2/3 tablespoon.  It was a hit.  The advantage is freezing.  Serve anytime you have company over as an appetizer.  The chili / tuna combo is delicious.  I made my chili sauce fresh, an extra benefit.  Question though, did everyone here really use 2/3 tablespoon of chili?  I upped it because the flavor wasn't disernable.  Thanks Jill.

I wasn't so sure of these after reading the reviews, but they tasted great!  I made them just as written, except that I ate them like a taco instead of cutting them into pinwheels.  And no way will this fill six large tortillas.  More like six small tortillas.

I am making this for the second time.  I also liked the sweet chili sauce and used lots, not one for measuring when I cook.  These are a definate hit for us.

I think chili and tuna are a bad mix. I would never put onions in tuna. Take away the tuna and this recipie's fine. Or just keep the tuna and take away the chili and this recpie's fine.

This is a pretty good little recipe.  It's fast, easy, and yummy.  I for sure used more than 2/3 TBS of the chili sauce.  It needs some sort of crunch to it though...I think next time I'll add diced up bell peppers or something.

1st time: Used cheddar & cottage cheese - what I had on hand. David really liked & suggested I make a batch to freeze.
2nd time: Used goat cheese, Lizano sauce & white onion. Tasty!

This was just all right, but I don't think I would make it again.  The flavor of the sauce was too sweet with the tuna.

These would be better is the tortilla was warmed in the microwave or in a skillet.  It makes the tortilla more pliable and brings out the flavor more.  Instead of semi-raw flour taste, the 
 warming gets rid of that; and if you fry them in a little oil, they won't be soggy at  all.  Or, you can just brush the "inside" with olive oil (or butter or coconut oil) to keep the other ingredients from soaking in.  Also, you can actually buy chile tuna in the can.  It's delicious.
