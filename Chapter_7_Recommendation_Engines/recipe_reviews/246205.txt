We liked these! I would think of them more as 'cheesy bread', but either way, they were good. I think next time I will brush them with some garlic butter after removing them from the oven for a bit more flavor.  Thanks for sharing. :)

This was very tasty . I used mozzarella sticks in place of the cheese. I cut them in 1/2, then froze them for 2hours.i brushed the rolls with melted butter and then sprinkled them with Italian herbs before baking. I also baked them at 400 for less time. About 8 minutes.
