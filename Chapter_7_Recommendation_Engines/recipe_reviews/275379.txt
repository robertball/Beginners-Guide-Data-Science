We really liked this!  First time using a cauliflower crust but we enjoyed it.  Used a bit of extra fill and a bit more feta.  Left off the tomato due to allergies but we didnâ€™t miss it.  Would totally make it again!

I really liked this. It was great to eat cold too.  If you enjoy Greek salads, then you will love this.  It presents beautifully.

This pizza was great! Delicious-tasting and easy to make. Using a CAULIPOWER crust makes it a better-for-you pizza that still tastes like a splurge. I really love these gluten free pizzas and this one was a hit. I made it to the recipe and of course forgot to put the sauce and fresh basil on for the picture but I did make it and we spooned it on and it was fabulous! Will make again.

This recipe was a great change-up on pizza and this was my first time using the CAULIPOWER pizza as a base which is genius.  We loved it and I really thought the CAULIPOWER crust held up exceptionally well and was delicious-tasting and crispy.  Two points on the recipe, next time around I might use Greek Yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Second, if you are making one, of these pizzas you might as well make two.  I really believe that the ingredients list as is can support two of these delicious pizzas.  No matter what though,  you are going to thoroughly enjoy this great Recipe!!!
