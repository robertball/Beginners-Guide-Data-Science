Great recipe! Followed it as-is except for the tomatoes - I didn't see the point in opening a whole can of diced tomatoes for 1 Tablespoon so I just used a regular tomato and diced it. Easy simple and delicious meal. Might try rubbing the chicken with garlic powder salt and pepper next time.

The original recipe was very good. The second time I made it I lightly seasoned the chicken w/ salt pepper & the Italian seasoning. Cut it into 1 in. chunks covered it & cooked it on med. heat w/ the minced garlic & a dash of lemon juice for 10 min. before browning it. I then added a whole can of diced tomatoes plus 1/2 a med. onion rough cut 2 cups chicken broth 1 cup rice & 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning. Brought it to a boil then let it simmer for 20 min. Much better!

The recipe was very simple as I like it but the rice was not tender at all. If I was to make this dish again I would prepare the rice in a separate pot as opposed to making it in the skillet.

This was AMAZING. So easy to make. The only thing I will do differently next time is to cook the rice for a while ahead of time so its tender and add some more tomatoes. Will be making this again soon!

I used a full can of tomatoes diluted cream of chicken soup instead of chicken broth and after adding the cheese I put a large handful of fresh spinach just before the chicken. All three of my men (ages 30 5 and 1) LOVED it.

My boyfriend demanded to know why I hadn't cooked this for him before and where I'd learned to make it. Haha. This was really basic recipe that tasted delicious. I didn't have the Italian herbs so I used fresh basil and cracked pepper instead. I'll definitely be making this again - maybe even for the in-laws if they're lucky.

Very tasty I added a whole can of tomatoes but I had to cook it for a lot longer to make the rice fully cooked I would double check the rice package and follow those directions till the rice is fully cooked then add the chicken.

I added a bit of sour cream and white wine to give this dish more flavour. Quick and easy to make!

Quick very easy and tasty! Most people said the used the whole can of tomatoes...Me too but to offset the extra tomatoes I used extra rice as well. Which then needs a little extra liquid so I didn't drain the tomatoes and for a little zip a splash of vinegar(little goes a long way). Also people suggested seasoning the chicken try adobo.

Excellent dish! Needed a little tweaking... I used a whole can (partially drained) of diced tomatoes and added more rice and more broth. I also used brown rice because that was what I had at home. It was unbelievably delicious though it took a long time to cook the rice (which I did separately from the chicken per the suggestion of other reviewers) and it ended up burning a bit and sticking to the pan. But overall the dish is outstanding. I'll be making this again!

Very good recipe. I sauteed onions with the chicken and garlic and added a half can of tomatoes instead of a tbsp. It's a great simple recipe that you can easily tweak to make your own. Will absolutely cook again.

This is a great recipe that can be quicker by using can chicken breast. I also added fresh basil and some red wine to intensify the taste.

This was delicious. I didn't have any chicken broth so substituted a tablespoon of soy sauce mixed with a cup of water and didn't add the diced tomato as I didn't want to open a can for that little amount and used brown rice. I browned the chicken in butter in a cast iron pan and cooked the whole meal in the pan. It was very tender when it was done. Also melted 4 cheese pizza cheese over it. Wicked awesome!

Excellent. I used the whole can of diced tomatoes without draining; didn't need to reduce broth. I used Kraft grated Parmesan and it still came out great!

This is a good recipe and my family liked it a lot. I made this with brown rice and I did not have the chicken broth so I made my own. The chicken was great and the rice was very tasty. I am just learning how to cook with brown rice so it was a little hard but that was me not the recipe. We had it with a salad and a slice of garlic bread. We will be having this again!!

It was delicious after I added more seasoning but the family enjoyed it.
