ADDITIONAL NOTE: USE A SHORTBREAD CRUST.  IT IS JUST AS QUICK AS GRAHAM CRACKER AND TASTES MUCH BETTER WITH THIS PARTICULAR PIE.  KEEBLER MAKES A GOOD SHORTBREAD CRUST.

This pie was fantastic.  I have made it 5 times or so over the summer and receive compliments every time.  It has just the right amount of sweetness and just the right amount of tartness.  The first time I made it I used some extra filling to dip some strawberries in, which was very yummy.  This gave me the idea to incorporate strawberries in some way.  The next time I prepared it then I added 2 tablespoons of All Fruit strawberry preserves.  Everyone raved about it and when I made it next I sliced strawberries and laid them on the bottom of the crust before I poured in the strawberry-lemon filling -- SOOO good!!!

AMAZING! So creamy and just enough sweetness not too much. I will be making this again and again. Would be wonderful with fresh fruit as suggested by some of the other reviewers. Divine! Thank you for sharing!

My family LOVES this pie!  It is tart, but we like that.  The lemon flavor bowls you over, it is not too sweet, but it's not too intense, either.  I agree with previous reviewers who say to use a shortbread crumb crust... it is awesome with this pie whereas graham cracker crust, I think, would just taste wrong.  I don't see why people complain about the gelatin.... okay so the texture may not be authentically "mousse" like, but the gelatin holds the pie together and it's not like the texture is bad.  I would rather have my pie hold together and be easy to slice, which is what the gelatin does for this pie.

I am making this for Thanksgiving this year, as my 8 year old begged for it.  Thanks for a new family favorite!

Made this for a big family dinner and everyone loved it.  Very refreshing and light.  It's not really the consistency of mousse, with the gelatin, but it does hold together nicely and tastes great.

Great pie--wonderful for summer.  Very light and cool.  I used a shortbread pie crust instead of regular and I think that gave it a better flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

The texture is definitely not mousse-like.  The gelatin makes it very strange.  Also not very sweet.  I used fresh lemon juice and it's VERY tart.

I made this tonight and got rave reviews from my family.  I used a graham cracker crust so it was much quicker.  I'm going to try this again and make some mini mousses for a party.

Everone LOVED this dessert.  I made it with fresh lemons and it wasn't tart at all.  I decorated with rings of blue berries, raspberries, black berries, and strawberries so it looked pretty.  For the crust, I did graham cracker with toasted almonds and lemon zest.

This pie was very easy.  I enjoyed the fresh lemon flavor.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it did not wow me.  I did use the shortbread crust recipe on this site.  it turned out good with this pie.

This is a little more tart than I think my family will like, but it is really delicious otherwise.  I think I'll add a little more sugar next time.  I used fresh lemon juice and Cool Whip for the whipped cream because that's what I had on hand.  The crust was the oil pat-in-pan crust from the Betty Crocker red cookbook.  Overall a very good pie.

I found the gelatin in this pie made the consistency wrong--definitely not a mousse.  Flavor was nice and tart though.

Very good recipe. I saw soe complaints in the reviews that it was too tart and I knew this would be the recipe for me- my family loves the taste of lemon!. Just to reassure you, it was not too tart at all, and I even added more lemon juice and zest. I also reduced the sugar. I also added toasted almonds to  a graham cracker crust. The pie made a huge impression on my guests who still talk about it till this day.

My friends and family really enjoy this dessert. The only thing I changed was that I whipped up extra whipping cream and placed it on top of the pie. It made it look nicer, and it also covered up my pie crust! It was my first time making a crust. It was edible, but not very presentable!

The whole filling of the pie had a substantial amount of sweetness and tartness to it. The pie crust turned out to be a little too solid, but that could be due to my own error. I made my own baked pie crust using a recipe in one of my own cookbooks rather than buying any factory made ones at a store. I didn't have any lemon zest available, so I substituted one-quarter teaspoon of lemon extract instead.

I served this pie as dessert at an Italian dinner. My guests love it. It was light and refreshing. 
The only change I made was to reduce the confectioner's sugar to 3/4 cup. I almost always reduce the sugar in recipes as I find most to be too sweet as written. I have rarely been disappointed when I've done this.

I didn’t make this as a pie, but as a mousse to be served with vanilla cookies.   As other reviewers have said, it is not too sweet and has the perfect amount of tartness.  The gelatin does give it a slightly different texture, but it is still creamy and delightful.
