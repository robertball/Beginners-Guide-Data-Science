This was a good salad, and I'd make it again. I made one change and used fresh green onions instead of red onion as I personally don't like raw red onion. To make up for the colour loss, I used red-edged lettuce leaves, and added a few pomegranate seeds on top for decoration.  I have to say that I found the mustard a bit strong in the dressing and would reduce the amount next time and add some raspberry vinegar instead.  I've made a similar salad in the past with additional red sweet pepper and shrimp.

The dressing took some tweaking.  I ended up adding some red wine vinegar and a bit more mustard and some honey.  Also, instead of the avocado, I used strawberries.  I was traveling with it and did not want the avocados to turn brown.  When all was said and done, it was a big hit.

Excellent light and healthy salad.  The dressing is what makes it.  I added red wine vinegar in lieu of the orange juice.  I find myself craving this dish!
