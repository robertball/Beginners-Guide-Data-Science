This was a wonderful recipe. 

My helpful hints. 

#1 Empty the fruit cocktail into a strainer and drain for a couple of hours in the refrigerator. 


#2 Mix the fruit cocktail and cream cheese together first then slowly incorporate the pudding mix. 

#3 Line a 1qt glass-mixing bowl with saran wrap leaving a generous amount over the edges. Spoon in the mixture and fold the saran wrap edges over the top and pat the mix down firmly.

#4 Refrigerate overnight. 

Just before serving unwrap the “ball” and invert onto a 10-inch pie plate. Serve with vanilla wafers around the ball filling the pie plate. 

This was a hit at my work potluck today!

I've made this for church and for work and everyone loves it.  One lady said "It is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth."  I got special requests for it at work.  I serve it with wheat thins and pretzels.  The nutty flavor of these go well with the sweetness of the dip

This was a big hit at the party I took it to.  Was too soft to mold into a ball, so will probably cut down some on the fruit next time. Served it as a dip with vanilla wafers....mmmm,delicious!

This recipe takes so few ingredients.  I had 3 people ask for the recipe within a half hour.  You can dip anything from pretzels, crackers, or graham snacks in this dip.

Mmmm, yummy!  This was really tasty.  I made sure to drain the fruit enough, and I took the advice of another reviewer and pressed the fruit with paper towels right before I mixed it in with the other ingredients.  I didn't have enough time to wait for this to chill to form it into a ball, but I did put it in a glass pie dish and sprinkle nuts on top.  This was pretty and tasty too, perfect for a hot summer evening!  I served this with 'Nilla Wafers and Graham crackers, and by the end of the evening half of it was already gone!  Thanks for the super recipe!

It would not shape into a cheese ball, so I just put it into a dish. Next ime I would just add the nuts instead of trying to roll them onto a ball

My family and friends love this fruit ball.  I've found it's very important that the fruit cocktail be well drained.  I blot it between paper towels to remove the liquid.  If too much liquid is left on the fruit cocktail the ball won't form properly.

I made a half recipe and it was way too much. It is really difficult for the ball to hold its shape. Probably best to serve it in a little dish, like a dip. I thought it tasted good, but doubt if I'd make it again.

This was really good tasting but made way too much.  It was also more like a spread instead of a cheese ball when I made it. I would make it again but half of the recipe.

The ingredients make for an interesting recipe. I however needed to drain the fruit for an extended period of time (which I didn't) so therefore I could not roll it into a ball. I may try it again.

I only made a 1/4 of this recipe bc I wanted to test it first before making a big batch. And to my surprise it is very good. Of course you can never go wrong with anything that has cream cheese. Didnt have almonds so I used pecan pieces. I will definetly be making this to bring to a party!

Neighbors decided to do a Fondue night and my cupboards were empty!  I checked the site and found I had all the ingredients for this.  Since there were 8 of us,  I cut the recipe in half.  I mixed it up and let it sit for 30 minutes while we got ready.  BIG HIT with everyone!  The guys just kept stuffing it in while the gals finished preparing fondue.  It is healthty and so easy.  I served it with Triscuts and Carr's Whole Wheat Crackers.

Just about the easiest thing EVER!!!  I dried mine as best as I could on paper towels, I must have used about 10 of them, but it paid off, because it rolled together perfectly!  I served it with vanilla wafers, but may try crackers next time, because you need something salty to balance out the sweet.

ALMOND EXTRACT!!!!  I made this and it was very good, but lacking something.  Then it dawned on me....almond extract.  It was really good after adding a couple of dashes to the mixture.  Nilla cookies were a good choice for a dipper as suggested by other reviewers.  Great Summer App or Dessert.  Will be making this one again.  However next time I think that I will try adding AMARETTO for an "Adult Version"  YUM!!!!

The dip was pretty good.  I think it would have been much better if I had used instant pudding instead of cook and serve, but you got to make do with what you have.  Served it with vanilla waffers.  Will try again with instant pudding.

It was good.  If I make it again, I will try it with peaches & pears instead of the fruit cocktail...the cherries were a little overwhelming.

Being a diabetic I had to alter this a little, I used fat free cream cheese and one can of fruit cocktail chopped up was plenty for us, and I didnt have any vanilla pudding at all, so I used fat free and sugar free cheesecake flavored pudding and didn't use any nuts at all. It was wonderful. I served it for Thanksgiving with Ritz crackers and it was gone in no time and you couldn't tell it was made with fat free and sugar free products. Will be making again at Christmas for our family Christmas party...

I agree with everyone who rated this 5 stars - it is the best. Problems probably came up when the fruit wasn't drained enough.  I put it between pieces of paper towel to drain it the same way as chopped spinach. It should be almost dry. I'm going to try pretzels but this is very tasty with the new graham cracker sticks, too.

I was looking for a dessert ball and found this recipe - read other reviews and decided to make it for a few parties.  Big hit and will make it again.  What I did was use a big 28 oz. can of fruit cocktail, drained half syrup out and poured in blender.  I chopped it up then put in a strainer (the big kind with a handle you can rest on a bowl) and let it drain about 4 hours in fridge.  This worked great because I didn't need to use paper towels to get the liquid out and added this to the other ingredients (except almonds, I left those out), then mixed with a hand mixer.  I lined two big cereal bowls shaped like balls/domes with saran wrap and split evenly, covering and putting in the fridge before serving with cinnamon graham cracker sticks.

I drained fruit cocktail in refrigerator for two hours then blotted with towel.  I also chopped the fruit before adding to cream cheese mixture.  I also lined bowl with saran wrap  made it easier to form ball.

Fantastic, you won't be disappointed.  This cheese ball is such a nice change of pace from the typical cheese ball.  I followed the recipe exactly but I did add a little bit of almond extract as others suggested.  The almond extract makes it fantastic.  You must try this one.  Everyone really loved it.

Unbelievably delicious!  I made, what I thought was a HUGE mistake with the fruit cocktail.  After reading everyone's reviews and warnings of ensuring that the fruit was well drained, I was worried because I needed to make the fruitball within a 30 minute time period.  I drained the LITE SYRUP fruit cocktail for about 5 minutes, then put  in a mini-food processor to chop. I had the wrong blade, and ended up with a course fruit puree.  I put  5-6 papertowels in a colander and tried to get a little more moisture out.  I put the finely chopped pecans into the fruit puree and hoped for the best.  IT EASILY ROLLED INTO BEAUTIFUL BALL!  I had no excess water at all, and it was finished in less than 20 minutes from start to finish.   I also used sugar-free vanilla pudding, and added the almond extract.  DELICIOUS!!  It was the talk of the appetizers, and everyone wanted the recipe.  Absolutely one of my favorite recipes now!  Served with Wheatables and Graham Crackers.  I liked the salt/sweet combination, but other's enjoyed the sweet on sweet.

MMMMmmmmmm!!!  I love this site!!  This is awesome!!!  I halved the recipe and drained the fruit cocktail overnight.  I then pulsed the fruit a few times in my chopper which worked great.  After chopping I still had to wring out the water by squeezing the fruit through a towel.  I did not add the nuts and added about a 1/4 tsp. of almond extract as others suggested.  It Made all the difference in the world!  I wrapped the ball in Saran Wrap and chilled overnight.    Even halving the recipe made a large ball.  This would taste great on anything from Nilla Wafers to Ritz Crackers!  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed!!

This was so easy and so yummy!.

The hardest part was draining the fruit.  I blotted it with papertowels.  I could have blotted more, because the ball was not as firm as it I would have liked.  

I did just dump the fruit in my mini-chopper to chop it.

Visually unappealing and for those who dared to try it simply scooped a glob either out of curiosity or sympathy...leaving most of it on their plates. Sorry, don't waste your time with this one. Ick!

My mom used to make this for cookouts and church gatherings and it is so good! You can substitue the almonds for pecans, which is how my mom's recipe was, but either way it is yummy!

I made this the night before a luncheon at work. It was very quick and easy to make. I served it in a dish instead of rolling it into a ball. Went great with Wheat Thin crackers.

I served this at a few potlucks and at my wedding. Everyone loved it and thought it was a great change from the traditional cheese ball. After the first time I made it, I cut the recipe in half because it was so huge!

this was okay, not the big hit of the night though. I served with graham and nilla wafers.

I halved the recipe, and it still made a large ball. Big hit on Christmas! Many asked for the recipe! Thanks!

Great recipe!  I did add a few drops of almond extract, as another reviewer suggested, and it really seemed to enhance the flavor.  I brought it to a party and it was a hit.  Will definitely make this again!

Quick and easy.  Delicious with snack crackers, vegetables and as a fruit dip.  Great alternative to a cheese ball.

Great recipie but I modified the fruit content a bit.  I used halved peaches & pears instead of the fruit coctail.  They were easier to drain & chop up.  I added cherries from a jar.  Great texture.  I served with Nilla wafers!  Hit of the party.

I used an orange cranberry marmalade and added vanilla extract. Rolled over crushed cashews. It was fantastic.

I made this with fat free cream cheese, 1 can of regular syrup fruit, and added in a small container of blueberries and chia seeds and it was delicious and had a great texture. I added a small amount of almonds to the mix and put the remaining almonds in a large bowl. After using a spatula to shape the mixture as much as I could, dropped it onto the almonds  then turned to fruit ball over onto a shallow bowl. Looks great!! Now to make some cinnamon sugar tortilla slices to serve with it. :)

I'm obsessed with cheese balls. My mother has been making the savory versions for years. It's a staple at every family get-together. This year, I'll WOW them with this. I plan on serving it with mini toast (another obsession is my mini loaf pan).

For those of you with nut allergies I use ground up cinnamon graham crackers instead of almonds on the top of the cheese "ball". ( I usually don't bother rolling it into a ball shape but just leave it in the bowl and top it)

A good alternative to the more traditional, savory cheese ball.  2 cans of fruit sounded like too much.  I substituted ~1.5 C diced strawberries.  Cinnamon grahams compliment the flavors very well.

I've made this for years for baby showers.  It's always a hit.  I don't use almonds, but roll it in toffee chips.  And I serve it with ginger or lemon snaps.  It's always a hit!

Very yummy! It was a bit soft, though - had to keep it wrapped in saran wrap overnight and until serving, and put it in a bowl as opposed to on a plate. Will definitely make this again!

Very tastygood...I agree that you don't need all the nuts....so I served it in a bowl for dipping with animal crackers  (for a baby shower)
