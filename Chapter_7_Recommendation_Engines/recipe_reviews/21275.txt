Delicious!  I would suggest one change, however.  The bananas get very runny in the oven if you mash them.  I now make this recipe using sliced banana instead.

This was very good!  We changed it a little bit by adding some cream cheese and sugar in with the mashed bananas, and we served some of the mixture on the side.  Quite a treat for breakfast!

this was pretty good although i took the advice from other users and didn't sliced rather than mashed the bananas.  my 6 year old would eat this every morning if he could.  thanks for sharing.

These were great. I made them for my husband and father on Father's day. After they came out of the oven I sprinkled them with powdered sugar, drizzled a raspberry sauce and topped them off with real maple syrup. A very tasty treat! The guys raved. Thanks for sharing.

This was really easy to make.  It was a nice variation from regular french toast, but I still like the regular kind better.  The bananas mashed in the middle gave it a strange texture.  By the way, this recipe is from a Bon Appetit magazine.

I used a cookie sheet for baking them.  I found that this was not enough egg mixture but maybe my bread was bigger than expected.  

Overall, good food.  My husband really liked it, even saying it was necessary to put anything on it.

Absolutely yummy! I halved the recipe and made this with 4 slices of heavy brown bread, used a bit more than quarter cup of skim milk, doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, and used only one sliced banana. I skipped the pan, and baked it on one side for 15 minutes, then flipped and baked the other side for 6 minutes. Perfection. A healthy sandwich that totally met my craving for something sweet. Plan on making more and freezing.

This was very good!! I like to make recipes healthy so I used whole grain wheat bread, skim milk and egg beaters and it tasted awesome. My only complaint was that, like others have said, there is not enough egg mixture so next time I will make a little more of it. I topped mine with sugar free syrup, a little sugar free reddi-whip and an extra sprinkle of cinnamon.....delicious!

I made these and thought how awsome these would be if I added walnuts, for crunch,  so I did and the whole family went "bananas" over this French Toast! Will make again for sure, thanks.

Really good!  I used 3 eggs and strongly suggest using spray oil on the baking pan.  Will make again for sure.

I did this and it was exceptional! I loved it and so did my husband. The banana was not too runny as someone previously stated in their review. It tasted amazing without syrup and also with it. The strawberries I could have done without because there was so much flavor in the french toast itself I didn't need any more. I actually gave them to my husband and he ate them on top of the bread. Great served with orange juice!

Both my husband and I thought this recipe was "ok". I added peanut butter (spread it on one slice of bread, banana on other and "sandwiched" them together). If I made this again, I would slice the banana instead of mash, as it was alittle too mushy for me.

This is sooo fabulous!!!!  I used the recommendation of slicing up the bananas.  I do have to say that using a better cinnamon is soo worth it!  I used Siagon Cinnamon by McCormick.  I never thought there was a difference in quality in cinnamon but there def. is!

i needed to add another egg (and appropriate amounts of extra milk, vanilla, and cinnamon) because there wasnt enough of the egg mixture to coat all of the bread.  my only other "complaint" was that a couple of the pieces were soggy; i guess they just need to bake longer than 8 minutes.  other than that, it was delicious!

This recipe has potential because the flavors work well together.  I did not care for the slimy texture of the mashed bananas.  I will try this recipe again, which is why I gave it 4 stars, otherwise it would have been a 2 star rating.  Next time, I will slice the bananas instead of mashing them.

This was okay, my husband liked it more than I did. I also had to double the milk/egg mixture to have enough. Tasted best with syrup and powdered sugar.

This was pretty good, but I feel like it could be a lot better. I feel like there was a bit too much vanilla extract. I could literally smell the vanilla when it was cooking. Also, too much banana. I used only half a banana per serving and it still seemed like a bit too much, almost overpowering. Just make sure to cook it completely on the skillet before you bake it, because the baking only serves  to melt the banana and make the french toast a little fluffy, not to actually cook it. 
I would suggest to just use your favorite french toast recipe, put bananas in the middle, and then bake it. Also, put whatever you want in the middle. You can use chocolate chips, strawberries, walnuts, or any other toppings you desire. Don't restrict yourselves to just banana! :)

Really wanted to like this, but it was just too mushy inside for my family. If there's a next time, I think I would just use sliced bananas and that might help. After dipping in the egg batter, we dipped the bread in an oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon mixture for crunch on the outside which was the hands down favorite part of the bread. But we also used regular bread, so maybe that was another reason why it was mushy inside...Sorry!

love french toast, and love bananas, but the middle was so soggy no matter how long i baked it, it tasted like a big soggy mess of raw egg and bread. I know i baked it long enough, any longer and the outside would've been too hard. think i'll try the cream cheese stuffed kind next.

The banana flavor was too overwhelming for me, and this is after reducing the amount of bananas in half.

Yummy!  I sliced the bananas as other reviewers suggested.  Then I spread one slice of bread with some cream cheese and the other slice with peanut butter.  Baked as directed.  These turned out very good.  Thank you for sharing!

Okay I made this recipe this morning for Valentines Day and it was  hit! Like others said, you could add different things to your liking but I loved the bananas inside! As suggested, I also cut the banana's into slices for the inside instead of mushing them. I topped with more bananas, strawberrys, syrup and powdered sugar!  It was VERY easy and quick! I will defanitley be making this simple, yet delicious recipe again and again! thanks!

Very Yummy.  Thanks so much for a new flip on French toast.  It was so easy.  Next time I will follow as others suggested and use sliced bananas, the mashed came out just a little bit runny.  I added powdered sugar over them and I served it with strawberry soup (recipe on this site). Thanks Karen

Nah.  Didn't really think this turned out that well for the trouble.  I did slices instead of mashing as one reviewer suggested.  I liked how the warm bananas tasted with the syrup.  But it seems to me you may be able to get the same flavors by just making regular French toast and maybe warming bananas in syrup before you pour it on.  Not worth all those extra steps. I am not one to be afraid of extra steps if it is worth it. Disappointing.

This was a great recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and spread some cream cheese sugar mixture on the bread and sliced my bananas, but I went one step further and added some orange zest to my cream cheese.  The result was amazing!

I enjoyed the warm banana, and how easy this recipe was, but we'll probably stick with traditional french toast.  Fun to try though!  Thanks

awesome! great way to use up ripe bananas. my boys tore it up, i only had a bite (diet), but it was so yummmy. made the house smell wonderful for a few hours. i used regular white bread with crust removed. used 10 slices instead of 8, needed more coverage for top layer. sliced bananas instead of mashing. served with butter and syrup.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I made it this morning for my boyfriend and myself and it tasted great. My mother looked quite skeptic about it so I just made her normal french toast. 
*Just a warning to any who try his recipe; first, do not add any more eggs to the mix as it will take too long to cook (meaning extra oven-time) and second, soak the sandwich for no more than 45 seconds as it will turn to mush and soak up way too much (further increasing the oven-time). One last thing, I attempted to slice the bananas finely and layer them in the sandwich, it would have been MUCH easier to just mash them as directed, that way you don't see all the banana juices leaking out as well. 

great recipe!

Used Challah bread for this and took Jessica's advice and added my daughter's soy butter (tastes like P.B.) to the bread. She loved this breakfast! Thanks so much!

Did not turn out the way the recipe describes. Mashed bananas do not cook in 8 minutes. Bread was mushy.

this turned out pretty good, but only i think because of the modification i made to it. i too sliced the bananas, and then i also added about 4 ounces og cream cheese to the bananas. the cream cheese added great flavor, nd also helped hold the bread together.

This recipe is awesome, healthy and very filling!!! I would make some minor adjustments for next time. I would use reduced calorie wheat bread, egg beaters and skim milk.  This can still taste delicious! You can even add a splenda to the filling to make it a little bit sweeter.

Very good recipe! I spread a thin layer of cream cheese on the inside of each piece of bread, then spread mashed bananas on that.  Also sprinkled with powdered sugar after they came out of the oven.  Husband loved it!

This was alright. The middle of mine came out very mushy and I questioned whether it was cooked (it was). It was also very hard to flip with the bananas in the center, so next time I might do the filling after the initial cook in the pan. Good start, I could see lots of variations to this recipe.

Really tasty. I used a wheat french loaf for some whole grains. I also spread some peanut butter on half of the batch (to accompany the banana)--this was also really good!!! I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was pretty good. I used whole wheat bread instead of french bread and put A LOT more cinnamon than the recipe called for. I mashed half of the bananas and spread them on, then sliced the other half and put them on top of the mashed. Very easy, basic recipe. The second time I made it, it turned out better because I put a lot more cinnamon and vanilla in the egg mixture. More cinnamon and vanilla made it delicious! I will definitely make it again.

I made a few changes. I sliced the bananas, as a few other reviewers suggested. Also, I didn't add the vanilla (we didn't have any), I added cream cheese, and I didn't bake them. I only fried it in a pan. My god. They were fantastic.

This is a nice change from the regular french toast.  I think serving it with strawberries and whipped cream makes it extra special - since strawberries go so well with bananas anyway.  Definitely a company-worthy dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome. Great with real maple syrup. I cut the recipe down to just make enough for myself by taking 1/4 cup milk, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, but I keep the 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and add I added 1 teaspoon brown sugar (not packed). 

:)

My son is a picky eater and devoured his banana stuffed french toast.  I sliced the bananas as other reviewers recommended.  I also added a layer a nutella on the bread before adding the bananas.  We topped ours off with whipped cream and strawberries.  It was delicious.  I will make this again.
