FANTASTIC!  A MUST for your kitchen cookbook!  There's just two of us, and let me tell you, my man loves his new bride all the more when I fill our home with the wonderful aroma of this dish.  This is a great meal to work with kids on in that it's very easy to make--if you're not kitchen savy, try this one--you'll wow the crowds!  *** USE THE WHOLE-JELLIED CRANBERRY SAUCE-IT'LL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE

I cut recipe in 1/2, used 3 chicken breasts, 1/2 can of jellied cranberries, 1/2 packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, and 1/2 cup of Western (light) dressing.  Baked for one hour with foil on, 15 minutes with foil off - DEE-LISH!!!  Would make this again ..... soon.

I didn't have any french dressing or onion soup mix, so I made the dressing and chopped an onion and added it to the mixture. We had it with salad and plain, white rice and it was very good.

Great recipe.  Used jellied cranberries, ff Catalina dressing and 2 T dried, minced onions in place of the soup mix to cut down on the sodium.  The sauce is delicious and had over brown rice.

I needed a recipe for a snowy, fall day & this recipe was perfect! The chicken was so moist & flavorful with plenty of sauce to spoon over the top. If you have members of your family who don't care of cranberries, but you do, make this!  You wouldn't even know that the recipe was titled cranberry chicken if you saw it & the taste is so dynamic that you can't really pin-point what's in it. Only use 1 packet of the onion soup mix. That is plenty & it won't over power like other reviewers have complained about.

AWESOME!  I LOVE this recipe, and even my two year old and very picky four year old liked it - he had thirds!  I took suggestions and only used one onion packet and whole cranberry sauce.  I actually used Kraft FREE French dressing and chicken thighs for this and it was delicious.  Perfect combo of flavors, a little sweet, not sour, but a little kick.  Will definitely be making this again!

My mom gave me this same recipe years ago. We use a lower temp though and cook for a few hours and the chicken is so tender! You can readily adapt it to a crockpot too. WOnderful flavor, even though the ingredient list seems odd, you won't be disappointed. It's a great company favorite too. Everyone loves it and will want the recipe.

This was a last minute dish for our Christmas dinner since I was unable to go shopping for the usual turkey.  So, needless to say I did not marinate for the recommended 8 hours.  That said, this was quite possibly one of the best chicken recipes that I have ever made and this is now going to be our traditional Christmas meal for years to come.  My hubby who loves chicken could not stop raving about this which is saying something since he rarely mentions anything about what I cook.  He said it was better than anything you can get in a restaurant even.  The only change I made was to make the French dressing from scratch (using one of the recipes here at Allrecipes) and I used bone in chicken breast.  The chicken was delicious and juicy.  Definite Keeper.

This was a great addition to my recipes! I can see this sauce with so many things! Ham glaze, grilled foods, pork chops, ribs....  and it goes so well over rice! My family LOVED it!! Thank you so much for submitting it! Oh, BTW, I used chicken legs, still came out GREAT! :o)

I prefer to use only 1 packet of the soup mix, low fat dressing, and the whole berry cranberry sauce.

The sauce taste like a mild BBQ sauce.  I would NOT recommend covering the pan with foil because this step caused the liquid to boil and a minor oven catastrophe.  Even this problem couldn't ruin a great dish!  My roommate and I enjoed this with both onion soup potatoes and rice.

My family wasn't crazy about his dish.  However, I liked it along with my daughter in law. My family thought the french dressing and soup mix was too overwhelming so I think next time I make it, I will use 2 cans of whole cranberry sauce with the 1 cup of french dressing and 1 envelope of soup mix.

Good! I would cook the mixture before marinated to break up the jellied cranberry sauce and to cook down the onions. I also only used a packet dry onion soup and did not cover with foil. Less cooking time also but This was very good and I will be making again.

I have been making this recipe for so long and I was going to post it but looks like someone already did the work for me.  Thanks!  4 Reasons why you should make this. 1. Doesn't get any easier. 2. Uses only a few ingredients that are easy to have on hand. 3. Nothing beats the flavour of this dish. 4. Great company pleaser.  I like to serve it with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad from this site.  3 suggestions: - There is no need to refrigerate this for 8 hours.  I usually just put the breasts in a baking dish, pour the cranberry mixture on top and instantly put it in the oven. - 1 hour in the oven is long enough and it leaves the chicken more tender. - I use whole cranberry sauce as I like prefer the texture and look of it.

Okay, here's the problem I have with this recipe.  A friend of mine gave me this recipe without the onion soup packet, whole canned cranberries instead of jellied, added pecans and baked it in the oven.  It was WONDERFUL.  I tried it this way yesterday.  It tasted exactly the same with one exception.  You know that onion taste that you can't get out of your mouth no matter how much you brush, floss, or pik?  Stayed with me through today.  I would definitely make this, taking out the onion soup mix and adding pecans.  I love it with rice.

This is a GREAT base recipe to have a lot of fun with. I added some of my own seasonings. I also added a can of apricots. Put the juice into the marinade and placed apricot halves in when baking. The comgined flavor of the cranberry and apricots was GREAT! It was also a nice display course. I thought this was great to start with and then add my own flavor to. I made it for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. I had one breast left over and I gave it to my neighbor, who immediately wanted the recipe. Went well with vegetable/brown rice and homemade rolls.

If I could give it 0 stars I would.  It must be an aquired taste.  I could not even finish it.  My husband said it was "ok".  Which is his very polite way of saying terrible.

I thought: Oh, goodie!  This looks like a simple recipe for my thawing chicken breasts.  I got everything ready and discovered I had no French dressing!  So, inspired by my fridge's contents, I used Blue Cheese instead.  It was delicious, and the tartness of the cheese went well with the sweetness of the cranberry sause.  I used a crock pot and added some fresh cut parsley, which gave it a rather festive appearance.  You'll like this one, and it is low fat...sort of!

My friend gave me this recipe and I was going to add it myself until I found yours. I must say this is one of the easiest and most amazing chicken dishes I have in my recipe book.  No one will believe you when you tell them that there are only 3 ingredients to this recipe.  Serve it with some form of bread so you can soak up the all the sauce!!

I would have never tried this recipe had it not been for the rave reviews.  I cut the sauce in half after Thanksgiving because we had left over cranberry and cooked it with four chicken breasts cut into large strips instead of six and it was delicious.  I also tried it in the crock pot but I DON'T recommend the crock pot for this one.  The sauce turns out runny and not nearly as flavorful.  Don't worry if you're not a cranberry lover.  You can't really taste any of the individual ingredients once it's cooked.  AND the cooked sauce doesn't really smell or taste anything like the uncooked marinade.  I was skeptical the first time I made it right up until I took the first bite.  Even the kids liked it.

Followed recipe exactly and everyone LOVED it. I didn't think the onion soup mix would taste good with the cranberry, but it was excellent. Only thing is, next time, I won't cover the chicken in the oven for the whole time. It wound up a little too soupy. Otherwise, GREAT recipe and very simple. Thanks for sharing it with us!

Sorry, this was a big disappointment for my family. Followed the instructions and ingredients exactly. Can't quite put my finger on it, but I think the onion soup mix was too overpowering. Think twice before making this.

I was so surprised at how good this chicken was. Came out tender and flavorful. My hubby said it was so good we could serve it for company. I was skeptical at first that this would turn out (seemed like a really odd combo of flavors) but I'm definitely making this again. Followed the recipe exactly. (except I marinated longer than the 8 hours)

Fabulous.Different.Easy. I made this with wild rice and broccoli spears and it made a colorful and tasty Christmas meal for guests. Everyone loved it. I would take the tinfoil off for the last 15-20 min. just to brown it up a bit. I also like using the jellied cranberries and western dressing.

This is similar to those chicken recipes with Lipton Onion Soup, but it is a little sweeter.  I like it because it is extremely fast to put together.  I have tried it both with jellied cranberry sauce and whole cranberry sauce -- I think I prefer the whole cranberry sauce, because you can actually tell that cranberry has been added.

Wow, this is a tough one to rate.  (1) Five stars for the number of ingredients and how easy it was to prepare. (2) Four stars from my husband who loved the sweet and tangy sauce. (3) Three stars from me on taste.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, it just didn't knock my socks off.  I served it with stuffing to try to duplicate a Thanksgiving dinner in February.  It sort of worked.

What a pleasant surprise. I love "cheater" recipes--ones that taste great but require little effort. I added 1/2 tsp ground pepper and a dash of port. I, in contrast with another reviewer, actually increased the amount of sauce and served it over the couscous side dish. I might try this delicious marinade over pork chops. (Note: I only marinated the chicken for an hour and it tasted great--I pound the breasts slightly to make them more tender and cook more evenly.)

Delicious and easy.  I've made it with and without the onion soup mix - sometimes I just put in sliced onions instead.  Great for a weeknight dinner that needs to be thrown together quickly.

I have no clue what all the hype is about with this recipe. I thought it was "okay" at best and would never make it again. My husband said he liked it but I'm not sure if he just didn't want to hurt my feelings or what? My kids did eat it though so I guess thats a plus? Not my cup of tea though.

Made it in the crockpot with my own version of french dressing (and less than stated).  Yes, the sauce is soupy but you could always reduce in a pan on the stovetop if you want it thicker.  I think adding the full amt of dressing would compromise the cranberry taste, so go light if you want it to come through.  Otherwise, pretty good!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but...I didn't. I don't know if it was the French dressing or the onion soup mix, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. It just didn't have enough cranberry flavor for me. I may try this again with a few changes, like using whole-berry cranberry sauce, some shallots, a little chicken broth and some caramelized onion.

Great, simple recipe.  Used FF dressing and jellied cranberries.  Subbed 2 T dried, minced onions for soup mix to cut down on sodium.  Definitely serve with rice to use the delicious sauce.

I hate to give bad reviews but this one some how never impressed me. I also agree with some other reviewers that the onion soup flavor is to strong, I would def half the amount next time. I was expecting this to be a sticky kind of chicken dish. That being said it is very easy and the chicken was very tender as I marinaded mine for about 20 hrs. Maybe thats why it never turned out? I won't be making this again although I do encourage others to try just cut-back on the onion soup

It was edible, But very bland. Chicken had no flavor, needed salt and/or other spices. The presentation (color) was hard to get around. Sauce was good with the rice but not good enough to make again. After reading all the reviews was really hoping I would like the uniqueness....but No.

Very easy and super yummy.  My kids even loved it.  I only had 4 chicken breast instead of the 6 that it called for, but it worked out fine because there was plenty of extra sauce to ladle over the brown rice we had to accompany it.

I used ground pork instead of chicken, and formed it into meatballs loosely following the "Sweet and Sour Pork Patties" recipe on this site. My oven is broken, so I cooked the meatballs, then added everything else, and simmered for a good 45 minutes and served over rice.

Even using pork, and not being able to use my oven, it was very good. Tangy and different from the usual dinner. I think, generally speaking, if you like things "Sweet and Sour" you'll like the taste of this recipe.

This cranberry chicken recipe is fabulous! What I like about it, besides the fact that it's so easy, is that it isn't too sweet. Cranberry chicken is our new favorite for Christmas and Easter! I made it with the whole berry cranberry sauce.

I did goof and use skin on breasts, which I think made it too fatty, but that was my fault. I added garlic and lemon pepper too.  ADVICE: Put aside some of the sauce to spoon on at the very end. I think if I had "sauced it" at the end it would be a 5. Did need the lemon pepper (or some extra something).

This recipe was great.  I used Catalina dressing instead, and only one packet of French Onion soup mix.  I will make this again!  My four-year-old even liked it! Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

This recipe is a keeper. YUMMY!  I used the recipe as directed.  I used a "catalina" type French dressing.  For all those that didn't like it, tinker with it.  Next time I am going to try a regular french dressing like Kraft. I think that may make a difference. Since I already love leftover roast beef with Kraft French dressing on it, I will try doing a beef roast in this.

The entire family thought this was awful.   I could barely get it down & I'll try anything (once).  I will say that the sauce was good mixed in with the rice that I served.   It's strange that it (the sauce) could taste better in combination with an unintended ingredient.  Don't waste time on this one.

Just one envelope of onion mix will do.  I also added some orange marmalade which really created a nice blend.  I cut down the French Dressing (not crazy about it).
Overall, pretty good

Hello,

I absoulutely loved this recipe. It was very easy to prepare, and while it is in the oven cooking, it gives your whole home a beautiful Christmasy smell.

My (picky) husband believed me when I told him the sauce was a "different type" of bbq sauce ;) - however, don't get me wrong, it tastes nothing like it (just kind of resembles in appearance and texture). We both loved it!

When I was reading the ingredidents I thought "wow that seems pretty gross - lets try it!". I actually ended up making this recipe for Christmas dinner and it turned out FANTASTIC. It was especially a wonderful gravy alternative for my mashed potatos.

Very easy and very good!  I added coconut shavings on top as a garnish, (similar to Chicken Suzanne), and it really made the mixture! Served it over jasmine rice and poured the sauce all over.

I'm still on the fence with this one. the kids LOVED it, which really surprised me, because I have a hard time with the way it smells. The aroma that filled the house while it baked put me off a bit. I liked it okay, my husband felt the same. I will make it again for the kids, but I also might try using apricot preserves in place of the cranberry sauce and see if we like that better.I wouldn't make it for company just because the aroma isn't very inviting.

This recipe was okay.  I used store-brand cranberry jelly --- big mistake.  Lots of potential if I use canned whole cranberries.

This is a very good recipe.  It is very similar, however, to the recipe that uses apricot jam and Russian dressing with onion soup mix.  The flavor is just a touch different.  The best results come when you pound the chicken to a uniform width with a meat mallet, then cook for only one hour.  This way, the chicken doesn't dry out.  Yummy.  Definitely need to serve this one over rice.

This was a good way to use up the leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving, but no one was crazy enough about it to warrant making it any other time of year.

The only change made to this recipe - I could only marinate for 5 hours, not 8. It was a hit! My husband said the best chicken he has ever eaten and I serve a lot of chicken! Can't wait to see what the extra 3 hours of marinating might do to it...I could definitely see serving this at a dinner party.

I don't get how you can omit 2 of the 4 ingredients, throw in whatever you have on hand instead, and then feel justified in rating this recipe a 3. Not fair at all! This is a holy grail recipe as written, worthy of 5+ stars! It tastes fantastic, takes mere minutes to get ready, is even better done in a crock pot, and pleases everyone including children. The calories maybe leave something to be desired, but isn't that the case with anything that tastes good? I will be making this recipe multiple times a month for the rest of my life.

The chicken was pretty tasty. Very moist. But the sugar tops out at 35g. I think it would do it good to have more savory flavors to balance out the sweet. I'd make it again but not often.

Was amazing... I love cranberries so I gave it a try and I was not sorry.  I used skinless, boneless thigh meat because that is what I had in freezer. I also let it marinate in refrigerator for 24 hours.  Will make again.

I make it exactly as written, but I use my crock-pot at camp. I cook the chicken until almost done, DRAIN off the juices, add the sauce and cook through. I'd even do it this way in the oven...less juices, thicker sauce! :) I also use the whole berry canned cranberry sauce. I'm making it agein this weekend at camp!

I mix the soup mix, cranberry sauce and dressing together and put it in the slow cooker. Put in the chicken and stir to coat. Dinner's ready when I get home from work. We used the leftovers for taco meat. Fantastic!

Great recipe.  I use Russian or Catalina dressing if I can't find French.  Yes, the ingredients look odd, but the flavors meld and are quite delicious!  This is a lovely "red" recipe to make for Valentines Day or a Christmas Party.  Use any chicken pieces you like - multiplies easily, I have made for 20 without issues.  Serve with rice and carrots - YUM!

I love this recipe! My two small boys and my husband eat it up!  I normally make things from scratch, so the flavors are a little more "processed" tasting than I am used to, but I love that I can prepare everything ahead and then just throw it in the oven and make rice and a veggie!

This was great, But (1) There is definitely no need for that extra half-envelope of onion soup mix. And (2) I have NO idea why we would waste the plastic wrap if doing the marinate-in-the-fridge step, only to replace it with foil!?! Just use the foil in the first place...what? (and loosen it before baking)

Really didn't care for this, even cutting back on the onion soup mix it seemed way to strong an onion flavor for my husband and I. I was hoping for more of a cranberry flavor, may just heat cranberry sauce in a small sauce pan to thin down and pour over boneless, skinless chicken breasts and try baking them in the oven next time. This is the first recipe from this site I didn't completely enjoy!

A friend made cranberry chicken when we were over to dinner. She wrote the recipe for me, but I lost it so I came online to look for a similar recipe. This one is the same except that hers said to use 1 cup French or Western or Italian salad dressing. The Italian gives it less sweetness and more of a cranberry 'kick' but we made it tonight using Western and it was delicious! The extra sauce seems too good to throw out so I am planning on mixing it in with some ground beef tomorrow to make a sweet BBQ sandwich filling. Also, the Liption's onion soup mix can be omitted if you want a gluten free option and the flavor is still great.

My youngest daughter made this for me for Mother's Day. It was excellent. I'm making it to take to a dinner on Monday night. I agree with the recommendations mentioned and will be making those adjustments as well. I am very curious about making in Crock Pot-are you pre-cooking chicken?  Thanks!

My family enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was extremely easy to put together and, served with rice, it was a winner! The only change I made was to use just one envelope of the onion soup mix. Thank you Heather for sharing your recipe with the allrecipes community.

Fantastic recipe for those who likes sourish-sweetish taste, especially, with mashed potato as a side dish! And the most important thing - no labor at all. I made 2 changes just for convenience: cut chicken breasts in strips and used only one pouch of onion soup.

I used onion stuffing mix instead of onion soup mix, and only refrigerated chicken for 1 hour and cooked the chicken 1 hour with the last 30 min uncovered. It was loved by all.

The boys loved it, dh, dd and I were all not thrilled with it (for various reasons - dh didn't like the pink color of the chicken and dd and I didn't love the flavor).  Don't know if I'll attempt again.  Disappointed, really wanted to *love* this one.

I don't think this has to have whole cranberries... I used a can of jellied cranberries, and like others used just one packet of onion soup mix, and some cheap french dressing. I put it in a crock pot on low for six hours, and it was absolutely amazing. My husband and two young sons ate it happily, and we've added this to our regular menu. So easy! So good!!

This was really good and the chicken was super moist.  I let mine sit overnight and most of the next day.  My husband and I are not big chicken people, but I had to use some up and decided on this recipe and we both agreed that it was good.

I used leftover homemade whole cranberry sauce (with grapes), and just one package of onion soup mix.  I also threw these in the Crockpot, which I discovered requires adding some water so that all the liquid doesn't cook away (at least 1/2 cup water).  I like the flavor of the sauce - fruity, tangy, and sweet - and it's great over mashed potatoes.  I use a similar recipe for pot roast, which calls for ketchup instead of French dressing.  I have to say I prefer this sauce on the beef rather than the chicken though.

This was a very nice surprise!  It is a refreshing twist on traditional sweet-n-sour chicken. The chicken came out very tender and tasty.

this i have to say was the first recipe i found on here that im slightly disapointed in. unlike most reviews, it wasnt the onion soup that bothered me, it was the french dressing. it was just too overpowering. all in all though it was fairly good. i will try this again but either sustituting the dressing alltogether or trying a different one.

If you are curious about this taste combination, try it out. I thought it was pretty lame. Plus, it did nothing to compliment the chicken; it's like an afterthought. And it's too sweet.

I could not wait to try this recipe, even gave a copy to my mother and a friend. We all love the ingredients and thought this would be wonderful.   We sure don't like all the ingredients when mixed together and cooked on chicken breasts though.  Hubby ate it but didn't care for it.  Onion soup flavor was over-powering.  Cranberry taste didn't come through at all.  Really disappointed in this recipe.

My family and I really liked this recipe, except I used 1 can whole berry cranberry jelly, 1 pkg. onion soup, and 1 cup of Dorothy Lynch Salad Dressing.  I thought it had a bit of an oriental taste to it, which we loved.  Served with white rice it was great.  I also had mixed the marinade the day before and let the flavors mix. Thanks.

Husband didn't love it. He said that it didn't have a specific taste...not salty, not sweet, not sour, etc.

I should have trusted my instincts on this one, but I thought that so many good reviews...maybe it's a good meal in disguise.  I only ate two bites. I ended up eating a cheese sandwich for dinner tonight.  I love cranberries, so imagine my disappointment at wasting an entire can of cranberry sauce.

If there were some sort of formula that took into account the amount of effort expended and the resulting taste, this would come out on top.  I liked it, my husband liked it, and it took ten minutes to prepare.  Sure it's not Crystal Hallibut Symphony, or whatever, but it's satisfying and easy.

I have tried this recipe a couple times and I am a little unsure about it.  It definitely gets points from me because of how easy it is to prepare.  I think it was better with whole cranberry sauce.  I also cut back on the onion soup mix to 1 package, which was more than enough.  My husband liked it but my kids didn't care for it much.  I liked the cranberry flavor and think it has potential.  If I try it again I may try adding orange zest and cutting back on the onion soup even more.  With the cranberry and french dressing though it does have quite a high sugar content!

This is great!  My family prefers the apricot chicken better (same ingredients but substitute apricot jam instead of cranberry sauce)but this is a nice change, and it seems healthier.  I cook mine in the crockpot.  Fast and delicious!  Tastes great with cheese Rice a Roni, the kids love it.

Really great flavors...even for those who would never have imagined combining cranberries with chicken. It has a lovely sweet flavor and a tangy zip that is perfect paired with Stove Top Stuffing! Almost a little reminiscent of turkey and dressing, but way better!

Easy and delicious!  The flavors go extremely well together.  I used chicken breasts and they came out very moist!  Hubby loved it and asked me to fix it again.  I served Rosemary potatoes (on this site) along side the chicken with a green salad.  Great for any night of the week as well as serving to company.  Will definitely use this one again.  Thanks for sharing, Heather!

This is a "company comming" recipe.  Very good, and easy to prepare.  Cooked it in a Romertopf dish and it was done in an hour.  Will most definitely fix this again and again.  Thanks to Heather.

Quick? Yes. Tasty? Hardly. It is an odd combination of tastes and the onion soup mix is too strong and doesn't meld well with the sweet French dressing and cranberry sauce. I will not make this again.

This was surprisingly good.  My husband hates cranberry sauce and thought it was barbecue sauce until I told him.  He still liked it.  I only had time to marinate it for thirty minutes.  It's good for left over cranberry sauce and EASY!

This recipe is fantastic.  Easy to make and delicious.  I cooked it in a Corningware dish with a glass lid and it turned out perfect.  I recommend this recipe to anyone.  And as a diabetic, it fits my diet perfectly.

Terrific!!  I've made this for years with a variation--a can of whole berry cranberry sauce and bottled Russian dressing.

This was so simple and a refreshing change of flavors.  I will prepare this recipe again and again.

This was excellent!  I only had a couple of hours to marinate, so I tenderized the breast with a mallet & poked holes in them with a paring knife.  I baked rice with them during the last half hour.

The ingredients listed make TONS on sauce so I would half the cranberry sauce, French dressing and use 1/2 of a package of onion soup mix.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, even our 2 and 4 year olds.  Definitely a do-again recipe.

This was a pleasant surprise!  My husband used to hate cranberries on anything... until he tasted this!

Cannot believe it tastes so good when it is so easy to make.
