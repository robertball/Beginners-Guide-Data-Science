I cut this down to two servings, omitted the simple syrup and used Malibu pineapple rum. No 151, just plain ol' Captain Morgan's spiced rum. Yum! It's sweet, that's for sure.

I use orange flavored Bicardi Rum for my fruit flavored option.  So yummy! Definitely a party favorite since it disappears and I have to make another full batch.

Adding the syrup to this recipe really made the difference. It added a creamy and sweet texture. We added Passion Fruit Rum as our fruit flavoring. I will make this on a larger scale the next time I make it.

I just make one glass at a time. Used a shot of Captian Morgan Dark and a shot of Captian Morgan Coconut. Also added some Canda Dry.

The recipe is spot on, only thing I changed was I used Malibu tropical banana instead of the plain rum. Color appetizing as well as flavor satisfying!!
