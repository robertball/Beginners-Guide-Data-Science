This is healthy and wonderfully flavorful alternative to conventional potato salad.  I substituted balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar and was so pleased with the flavor I will probably continue to use balsamic in this recipe.  I don't know if Old Bay seasoning is available in all parts of the country - for those who aren't familiar, it is a seasoning mix, used mainly for seafood (but good on just about everything,) that originated in Baltimore, MD.  If you can't find Old Bay, look for "Chesapeake Bay" seasoning or for "Seafood Seasoning."  These should be decent substitutes.  This recipe is a keeper.

I prepared this recipe last night.  My wife wanted to make sure there were going to be leftovers -- for breakfast!!  Needless to say, she really liked it.  I made a few modifications just because I had the stuff on hand and thought it might work well with the recipe.  I cubed and stir-fried half of a boneless, skinless chicken breast and tossed it in the salad.  I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic and 3 baby carrots finely chopped.  I added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped fresh mushrooms.  Served everything over a bed of baby spinach leaves (about 1/4 cup) in each bowl.  I re-calculated the nutritional values after my modifications.  The new calorie count was 163 calories, 3.5g fat, 27.9g carbs, and 5.9g protein.  Very healthy and very good.

This is a delicious change from a traditional potato salad. All of the ingredients went suprisingly well together. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Good, although a bit spicy if served cold; if hot, the spice isn't as prominent.  I think I'd prefer to bake this as opposed to boiling the potatoes as well; they just got starchy and started falling apart.  Other than that, I felt this was a good salad and pretty easy and flavorful.  It definitely makes a lot of servings--the serving amount is no joke!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good.  I didn't expect the cucumbers to add a nice flavor but they really did.  I only had a little bit of the wine vinegar so the recipe was missing some of that flavor but it very tasty.  We ate this with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan (from this site) and garlic bread rolls.  Excellent dinner!

This is really good, and a healthy alternative to mayo-laden potato salads. Definitely a keeper; will make again! I substituted zucchini for the cucumber - either would work well. PS my husband and son hate anything with the word "green" or "vegetable" in it, but they ate this up!

A nice, healthy change but a bit heavy on the Old Bay seasoning. I might try it again with a teaspoon or two less.
