This recipe was tasty, but the meat was not very tender. I think next time I will let the meat marinate for several hours. The red pepper is a nice compliment to the beef and we had roasted potato's.

The flavour was good, but as another reviewer said the meat was tough. The second time I marinated it overnight but the beef was still tough. The third time was the charm: instead of marinating, I browned the cutlets "as is", added all the ingredients except the red pepper into the saucepan, covered, and cooked on low for two hours. I then sauteed the red pepper separately and added it to the cooked steak.

I have a feeling the "round steak cutlets" I buy at my supermarket aren't the same that the recipe creator buys, which could be the problem.
