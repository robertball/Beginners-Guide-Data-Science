This recipe is just EXCELLENT! It was my first time making any kind of sushi and I was very happy with the results. I am a vegan, so I substituted brown rice syrup for the honey and I also used short-grain brown rice. I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good.  But please, don't rinse your rice!  Sushi rice is supposed to be sticky!  That's like a Japanese person recommending that you leave the baking powder out of your biscuits, so "they're not too fluffy" !!!

There are soy sushi wrappers available for people who don't like the taste of nori. You can find them in asian stores sometimes and online (amazon.com has some).

To the person who said not to wash your rice:  Japanese always wash their rice (multiple times) as sushi rice is not supposed to be "sticky" but holds together just enough for preparing the recipe.  Also, real sushi rice is a mixture of rice combined with seasoned rice vinegar before it is spread over the nori which gives it it's consistency for sushi.  This is OK for an "Americanized" version of sushi.

It just wasn't for me. My husband said if I had ever tried and liked real sushi I would have liked it, he thought it was good and authentic.

This was my first time making and eating nori rolls...it was a lot of fun! But, I've found I'm not too keen on nori. That aside, I think anyone enjoying nori would like this recipe. Although the rice vinegar also seemed a little strong. I might suggest the newbie forego the rice vinegar for the first bite. Fun recipe!

I've made sushi a couple of times before. I've always rinsed the rice until the water runs clear, then made it in a rice pot. When the rice is rinsed well, it's not so sticky. Other than that, this recipe works well. You can substitute imitation crab for the tofu too. My daughter and I love it that way.

Great dish.  I had a hard time getting the seaweed to stick together but other than that it was great.

NOTE: avoid using metal utensils to scoop rice. This can alter the taste of the rice due to the vinegar. If you do not want to use your hands, use a wooden or plastic spoon.

I'm giving the a 5 b/c I think it tasted good for sushi (I personally am so-so on sushi but don't think it deserves a lower rating b/c of personal preference).  I had trouble keeping it together once I made it, but in general thought it was easy to initially assemble.  I like all of the fresh and healthy ingredients that go into it!

Pretty freaking awesome. It took me a while to figure out how to roll sushi, because I've never made it before and had no clue, but after googling it it worked rather well.

Maybe I'm just not a sushi person, but I couldn't stand this recipe.  The nori rolled well and the tofu marinade was tasty, but other than that, I had to throw out the entire batch.  The rice was too sticky and sour, and my house smelled like fish for days.  Don't be discouraged by my review though, maybe if you like sushi, you'll like this.
