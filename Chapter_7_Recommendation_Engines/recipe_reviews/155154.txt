My husband and I loved this!!  I cooked a 5 lb. angus beef roast in the crockpot.  I seasoned it well with garlic and fresh pepper than cooked/browned all sides in a pan with olive oil.  It cooked on low in the crockpot for 6 hrs with NO VEGES.  My family loves mashed potatoes with roast.  I used 1/2 c. of wistershire sauce, 1/2 c. Sweet Baby Ray's Original plus 1/2 c. water.  The meat was tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  It turned out delish!!  I can't stop picking at the meat and dinner was over 2 hrs ago.  Thanks for this easy recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. I think those who didn't like the veggies need to realize they are really only there to add flavor, like when you make chicken broth. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MEAT! However I mashed down the veggies before serving, added 1 cup of potato water (from the mashed potatoes I was making, my mom's kitchen tip when making gravies) and thickened it to make gravy.   YUMMMMM

this was awesome although I substituted A-1 marinade for the BarBQ sauce.  Just fell apart at the end of the day and sweet as could be.  Served with mashed poatoes and peas. Yum Yum!

Couldn't be easier.  The use of BBQ sauce is a nice change from the more commonly used onion or mushroom soups.  We're on a  low-sodium diet, so I watered down the worcestershire sauce using 1/2 water and 1/2 sauce.

So tasty!  I loved the worchestire taste the beef picked up! This is the first slow cooker roast that my boyfriend has approved of.  I minused the veggies as we like mashed potatoes with roast and sprinkled the roast with a little onion & chili powder. Great recipe!

Despite the unappetizing picture accompanying the recipe, this turned out delicious. I had a bottom round and no clue what to do with it. I was skeptical about such a simple recipe - but I lacked ingredients for other recipes. I just put the beef and some potatoes and red onion, in the crock pot (after browning the beef), added the two sauces and left it on low for 10+ hours. Everyone loved it. I especially liked that it had a bit of a kick! This recipe is a keeper!

this was terrible. Every thing tasted the same-all b.b.q It would have been o.k. if only the meat had the b.b.q. taste

This is an excellent recipe. The meat was so juicy and tender. The carrots and celery had a very nice smokey flavor to them, which I had never experienced, but loved! Am definitely going to be making this again.

This was okay and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I’m not certain that the bbq sauce was necessary.  It didn’t seem to add to the taste.  Overall the meat was flavorful and tender.

This was the first time I'd ever used a crock-pot or made a roast. I had an almost 4lb. roast so I added more liquid and also didn't really have any veg that I thought would go well except onion. I used A! marinade as I didn't have bbq sauce. I let it cook from 5:30 am to about 5:30 pm. It was tender and juicy. I really didn't have to cut it or anything it just fell apart. The warmth and small kick from the A! and w-shire was comforting and brought thoughts of curling up on the couch on a cold night munching the roast. I can't wait to have some of the very little leftovers on bread with provalone cheese tomorrow. If my brother doesn't do one of his amazing disappearing food tricks while I sleep tonight. YUMMY, that is all I have left to say.

Awesome and unbelievably easy.  Its very filling and is super quick to throw together.  It was a bit sweet and a bit spicy, but both probably could be fixed easily with some ingredient tampering.

This was the first beef roast I've ever cooked and it was excellent and my husband loved it! The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was celery but we didn't miss it.  I'm cooking it again next week and I'll add the celery to compare the difference in taste.  I can't imagine it tasting any better!

This is super good. Used a 5lb roast with 1/4 Worcestshire, 3/4 BBQ sauce and 1 cup water.  Slow-cooked for 7.5 hours.  Will probably cook for 6-6.5 hours next time. Thanks! Mom loved this.

This was a very tasty dish and the first slow cooker recipe I ever tried. I did not have all the veggies so I just used onion. After the roast was done I thickened the juices slightly for more of a gravy. The leftovers are in the fridge, the meat shredded in the sauce and will be used for sandwiches, with coleslaw, tomorrow.

I also took the suggestions and added 1/2 cup of water and used the sweet baby ray's bbq sauce. I did not have celery but it wasn't missed. The veggies do not taste good the other reviews are right that it's just suppose to add flavor to the meat. The meat though was great!! I will definitely be making this recipe again!! I cooked it for 3hrs on high and 3 hrs on low and it was perfect!!

Excellent beef roast.  I have always found round roast to be dry and altogether inedible but with this recipe it was falling apart under the knife.  I have made this twice now, trying both six hours and eight hours, and believe me, the extra two hours is worth it.

WONDERFUL idea - bbq sauce & Worcestershire!  I did follow other reviewers suggestion of cooking the veges separately.  Mashed tators go great with this.  The flavors are not overwhelming; you can taste the beef which my hubby likes.  I didn't use the celery or onions.  I put garlic powder & pepper on the beef, then browned both sides in olive oil before I put it in the slow cooker.  Smelled great and tasted great.  If you want MORE flavor, add more spices/sauces.  Sweet Baby Rays original sauce is the BEST!

Not a bad taste, but not as tender as some of the recipes I have tried.  I omitted the celery, as I hate the taste of it, and did not miss it at all.

Delicious.  Only change I made was I did not add the carrots or celery since I was out and didn't want to run to the store.  Very easy.  Will definitely make again.

Made exactly as written. I agree with some other reviewers that the Worcestershire was too overpowering. I couldn't taste anything else. Too bad, a good roast that wound up tasting like drinking a bottle of Lea & Perin!  One star for the tenderness of the meat and veggies

This was my first roast that I ever made.  It turned out great!  My bf even said, "wow, this couldn't have turned out better!"  I follwed the advice of previous reviewers...I used A1 marinade instead of the bbq sauce and left out all of the veggies except the onions.  The sauce ended up being delicious to pour over veggies and mashed potatoes on the side. I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty! The BBQ and Worcestershire sauce make a unique, sweet and tangy sauce. A nice twist to the traditional tomato-based roast I usually make. I omitted the celery and used potatoes and it worked very well, too.

I love making this on a busy day. Throw all the ingredients in the slow cooker in the morning and sit down to a nice homemade dinner in the evening!It always comes out tender and juicy.(It's also a nice change from a regular roast beef recipe.) It has a really nice smokey yet mild bbq taste to it. The sauce was especially good over rice.

I'm drooling remembering how good this was.  I made this for our Sunday dinner with my roommates and they were still talking about it days later.  I skipped the celery and carrots and had veggies on the side.  Definitely bringing this back soon!

This dish turned out to be very tasty.  I was pressed for time tonight so I cooked the pot roast on high in the slow cooker for 3 hours, rather that on low for 6 hours.  I also used baby carrots instead.  Quick and easy.

Tasty but a little n the dry side when all was said and done. I used a tri tip roast and didn't put any celery or carrots in as I just didn't have any. Will make this again, but with a gravy on the side.

I varied this some but it was great!  I was afraid to "ruin" my roast by not using my traditional recipe but I tried it anyway and it was a hit!  I used a mixture of 3 different BBQ's that I already had open in the fridge.  The only veggies I put in were onions.

Sorry but I can't get on board with all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly but I found the meat to be very dry and uninspiring. The slow cooker liquid did make an excellent gravy which when combined with mashed potatoes saved the day.

Delicious! Did not use carrots or celery. Used onion, fresh garlic, and added a can of Rotel.  The meat was really tender and soooo flavorful! Will definitely make again!

It just goes to show how people have different tastes because I hated this dish. I followed it to a T and all I could taste was Worcestershire sauce.

This was very tasty BUT, each crockpot is different and 5 hours in I noticed my beef was well done (I hate that). I lowered the crockpot to simmer. Fortunately, I served it smothered in the sauce and it was good. Next time I would check on it at 3-4 hours. Don't assume 6-8 hours is ok.

Easy! Many roast recipes for crock pot require browning first, which to me removes the ease of crock pot cooking...one pot, a knife, a cutting board, 10 minutes - done. Husband and 4 year old son loved it. Cooked 6 hours and it was very tender.

I was really surprised at how well this turned out. Not dry and very tasty. Left out the veggies and cooked them separately as I didn't think I would like them in with the bbq sauce. Hubby really liked this recipe!

I cooked the round roast just like the recipe said but left out the veggies and steamed them. My husband like it more then I did. He said it almost is like a wanna be brisket. The next time I make it I will probably do just a couple dashes of the Worcestershire Sauce and more BBQ Sauce. I think that 1/2 cup of Worcestershire Sauce was just to strong and over powering.

I had high hope for this recipe. It was definitely easy to make, but the flavors seemed to clash with each other. My husband thought it might taste better if the BBQ sauce was omitted and a packet of onion soup mix was used instead. I would maybe try that, but I also wonder if the variety of BBQ sauce used makes a difference in the end result. In my case, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original. The meal was edible, but nothing to write home about.

I really did not enjoy this at all.  My husband did, however.  We substituted soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce, but I don't think that was a huge difference.  All of the veggies ended up tasting like the sauce, like they were drenched.  The meat was fine, but I think the same level could be achieved with a different recipe that leaves the veggies tasting nice.  I thought the sauce tasted best with the egg noodles I made to go with it, but that is the part my husband didn't like.  I doubt we will be trying this again.

Wow this is awesome and super simple. I made some modifications.  I pan seared the meat first, used half a bottle of dark beer instead of worcestershire sauce, and omitted the celery.  It was the best roast ever.  Next time I'll add even more onions as they tasted like french onion soup onions, yum!

VERY Easy and super simple but it was delicious.  I found the BBQ sauce and worcestershire sauce were a good combination and neither one overpowered the other.  I made it over rice as suggested and made (haha boiled more like it!) fresh sweet corn on the cob, and it was a great compliment to the gravy from the bottom of the crock pot poured over rice.  The roast was perfectly cooked.  I was unsure what shpinky meant by "chopped" carrots and celery but I chopped them down to small bite sized peices about the size of half a penny.  Enough so that they would still flow fairly easily out of the gravy boat.

I used frozen chopped onions on the bottom of the slow cooker. A practice I started before I started using liner bags. Ran on high for first hour to thaw. Did not have celery. Followed directions with three pound roast. Very tender! Sweet Baby Ray was the dominant flavor. Garlic and Worcestershire Sauce faded during cooking. Paired well with the best backed potatoes recipient and Cabernet.

It was good but I agree with the other reviewers that said the vegetables didn't taste good (although my husband liked them and he normally doesn't like vegetables!)  I guess that's a matter of taste.  The meat turned out really good and very tender.  I used a top round roast.

This recipe makes a tender roast.  I didn't have bbq sauce so I used only Worcestershire sauce.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I used a no salt sauce blend as a rub and I sprinkled garlic powder  and pepper on it.  This was to compensate for the lack of salt.  I cut the potatoes into chunks and put them on the bottom and the meat on top. I put the rest of the vegetables on top of the roast. I added 1/2 cup of water.  The potatoes were delicious  because they turned out brown and flavored like the "broasted" potatoes you get with a roast in the oven. The reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 is the vegetables on top.  None of us liked them.

I  did not have any barbeque sauce so I used a cider vinegar  drink for the sauce.  My family love it.   Served the sauce over mashed potatoes  with the beef on the side.

The family loved it!

This was a big hit. I usually follow recipes to the tee--but I didn't have any worcestershire sauce (gasp!). I subbed it for some "Dale's Marinade"--I know its not available everywhere, but if you can get it, its great. Aaaaanyways, it worked out great.

I have been cooking for at least 40 years, and this was the best pot roast recipe I've ever used. I made only a few changes- I added red potatoes and mushrooms to the list of veggies, I added one quarter cup Worcestershire sauce and one quarter cup water, and I thickened the gravy before serving with a little corn starch mixed with the broth. It was delicious. It's the only pot roast recipe  I will use from now on.I would even recommend it to company!

Very good recipe! My family loved it! I did tweak it a bit... I sprinkled the roast with salt, black pepper & garlic powder then pan fried the roast on all sides with some olive oil first.  I largely chopped 3 whole onions (NO other veggies at all) and placed them in the crock pot, place the pan fried roast on top of the onions in the crock pot. I then mixed 1/4 cup of Worcestershire & 1/4 cup of soy sauce & 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce together in separate bowl. I then decided to add a can of beef broth to the mixture and poured it all over the roast in the crock pot. Cooked on low for 6 hours and voila!! Done!! It had soooooo much flavour! I also made white rice on the side and the onion sauce was absolutely awesome as a dressing for the rice!!

This turned out wonderfully. I didn't have Worcestershire cause so I used 1/2 cup of A-1 Sauce. Also, cook time on low @ 6-8 hours - next time, I'll do 7 hours. But the sauces were great, carrots were delicious & the roast to die for!

Simple and Tasty.   I eliminated the bbq sauce as I think this adds too many calories and all you would taste is bbq sauce instead of the meat.   I kept in the celery, carrots, mini potatoes and mushrooms and onions.   I just added beef broth and some garlic buds.   Before putting in the slow cooker, I browned the top and bottom of roast, then sprinkled Montreal spice all over it.   All liked it!   I used the juice to make gravy.

This was pretty good! Only changes I made were added a little garlic powder, red peppers and used 2 different kinds of BBQ sauce so, I did 1/2 cup of each! I used 1 sweet & spicy and 1 was Cattleman's! I went to bed early and when I woke the next morning there wasn't much left over of the huge roast I made! So, that means family approval! Not even enough left over for the next meal! Wow!

This was good. I threw in some whole garlic cloves and liquid smoke. I would imagine the taste varies with the type of bbq sauce you use. I used Sweet Baby Ray's because it was what I had in the fridge. I would make this again

I used this recipe just for the method, but added flavour according to my family's taste. This produced a lovely tender and moist roast beef - something I have struggled to do in the past. I'm sure the flavour profile here would work nicely as well. Just used the leftovers to make beef stroganoff for dinner tonight - yum!

This was delicious.  I only used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and only 1/2 of the worchestershire sauce called for.  When it was done,  I added some corn starch to the liquid to thicken it a bit and served it, veggies and all, over pasta one night and mashed potatoes another night.

I used a bread and butter roast, I used a lot more liguids then it calls for more like 3/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce and 3/4 cup of BBQ sauce I used sweet baby rays original I also added about 1/2 cup of water. I used celery, califlower, carrots, didn't have an onion so I used dried onions, I also used garlic salt. I cooked 3 hrs on high 3 hrs on low. It just fell apart it was so delish. I usually do the whole box food meals.. Well frankly because they are quick and easy. But this was just as easy. I will say I was scared to ruin my roast or that my boyfriend wouldn't like it. But he even used the juices to put on his mashed potatoes. ????

This recipe was great!  I didn't have the vegetables on hand and the meat had already defrosted.  I added the remaining ingredients and hoped for the best.  It was delicious - moist, tender and super tasty.  Can't wait to try it with the veggies!

I just made this tonight.  First time cooking a roast in the crockpot.  I substituted the Worcestershire sauce with Demitri's Bloody Mary Mix-Extra Horseradish and substituted the BBQ sauce with beef broth.  The grocery was actually out of celery so I only used carrots and onion.  Very tasty with a nice zing from the Blood Mary mix.  Will make it again.

Great flavor!! Even my 10-year-old really liked it! Put it over egg noodles and it was truly delicious. The only thing change I might make is to thicken up the sauce before serving. Definitely a keeper!

This was my first roast to cook in a slow cooker and it was so easy!! I used Jack Daniels for the bbq sauce and it tasted phenomenal!
