Delicious!  I used 8 oz of chocolate and found that plenty.  I also added another cup of cereal for a variety. This alliwed it to be sepersted and not globs. If you it looks like it's going to be to thick add more ingredients to spread it out.

Tastes great, but IMO there is way too much white chocolate.  Once hardened it was impossible to break it apart in a presentable manner.  I would either downsize the white chocolate to 9 oz. or add an additional cup of chex and cup of pretzels.  Fun to snack on but it is a very thick coat of white chocolate. This recipe might work better if you were making "haystacks" out of the mixture.

I love to add this to my cookie gifts each year. I also add in 2 c. Cheerios to the above mix. This year I had rice and corn Chex. I used a cup of each and it worked out great.  I noticed some trouble in the comments, so Iâ€™ll add my thoughts here. When spreading this, I like to spoon it out on either foil or wax paper and kind of shape it into a rectangle, think 9 x 11 and then maybe 2 inches high and let it set up. I find it breaks well into big or small clumps kind of organically as I put it into ziplocks. Enjoy!

I added an extra cup of cereal and pretzels, and used a whole bag of chips. It turned out nicely. Will make an excellent addition to my Christmas baskets I hand out to my neighbors.

Definitely good. I cut the recipe in half. I've had similar before but I realized once I made this what I was missing.... captian crunch collosal berries! My district manager made this for us one year and hers had NO NUTS but had the captian crunch. I will be adding that next time. Sooooo good

I used pecans instead of peanuts, change white chocolate chips to 8oz instead of 12oz and added holiday sprinkles while after spreading out to dry.  Really easy and great holiday snack!
