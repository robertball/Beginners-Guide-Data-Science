Bland bland bland. Where are the celery,carrots and onions? I put in all3 and sometimes green beans or zucchini. I put in thyme and Italian seasonings and fresh garlic and parsley. I would not make it as is.

After reading some of the reviews I decided to add a few ingredients.  
I added a can of cream of chicken soup, pepper, and basil to taste.  Rather than using the spaghetti, I used egg noodle twists.  My husband & I both enjoyed this soup with a grilled cheese sandwich.  It's true comfort food!!

This was good, I would definitely use chicken broth in lieu of water next time.  It is a little bland but that was fine, my daughter loved it with the spaghetti noodles.  Fresh herbs would help cure the blandness too.  Thanks!

This soup was good but a little bland.  I added a lot of salt as well as carrots and celery to give it more flavor.  If I made it again I would add chicken broth to give it more flavor. I'd say overall its so-so.

This recipe turned out wonderfully!  I added carrots, celery, chicken boullion, and 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth and it was just perfect!  I will definitely make this again!

Perfect I have a cold and don't wanna cook make me feel better soup.

As one of the commenters suggested I added a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup, two teaspoons of white pepper, one teaspoon parsley, one teaspoon celery salt and one tablespoon salt.  And the soup was amazingly delicious.

I will make this every time I am sick from now on.

My husband and I enjoyed it. Just added chicken bouillon cubes, like the another suggestion said. There were WAY too many noodles, next time I would add only half a pound!

Easy and Good! I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti (homemade noodles would have been the best)I also added a few chopped carrots and used half chicken broth half water and added some chicken bullion. Yum!

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy to make and tasted wonderful.  It's definitely healthier than eating a can of soup.  Try substituting egg noodles instead of spaghetti, it tastes great.

Exactly the simple recipe i was looking for.  It's two days till grocery day and I only shop once a month so I was out of all my veggies and didn't have any cans either.  This met my requirements exact.

Had to give this one 4 stars, because I'm sure it would be quite bland if made "as is". I used chicken broth instead of water, and added Italian seasoning. Also added carrots, celery & some sliced mushrooms, which I sauteed in EVOO w/ onion & garlic. I also marinated the chicken in zesty Italian dressing all day, then seared, shredded, & added to soup. Topped off w/ one bay leaf,  and it was scrumptious!

Wow!  This soup is an excellent easy base.  I love the simplicity of the recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added bullion.  Then I seasoned with celery flakes, parsley, oregano, basil, garlic salt, garlic powder, and a couple dashes of curry.  The flavor was magnificent.  I also increased the onion.  The flavors that stand out are the celery flakes, curry, garlic, and onion.  Thanks!

Used other reviews and added parsley, basil, carrots, and celery, as well as using half chicken broth, half water. I had to even add a few chicken bouillon cubes to help that out. A decent base though... with a few of your own twists.

I actually thought this was pretty good overall:) I added some veggies and used all organic products. It was simple and quick to make. Great to curl up to when you have a nasty cold. My husband felt it was very bland and didn't care for it though. Thanks!

Excellent base recipe. Made a few delicious changes>
Sauteed all the vegs and a package of fresh mushrooms in 1/2 cup butter.
Used 4-2" sprigs of fresh sage and 2-6" sprigs of fresh rosemary out of the garden instead of marjoram. Also some garlic.
If this doesn't sure what ails you, NOTHING WILL!!

I liked this soup because I could just throw in the ingredients. The trick to this one is just to throw in a few more! Otherwise, it would have been bland. I threw in whatever I had that might be good in soup, a can of beans, a little ketchup for tomato flavor, more salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and carrots.

this recipe needs serious work.  if you are not going to make your own stock than at least add some generic powder to the mix.  better luck next time and if you want a good recipe try the awesome chicken noodle soup.

This soup was very easy to make--I already had all the ingredients in my fridge and pantry and loved putting them to use.  It was also easy and fairly quick to make.  Very delicious!

I've made this twice & it is great! Try adding chicken broth to the boiling chicken for stronger chicken flavor.

Yes it’s a bit bland.  But when I am having stomach issues (or in this case both myself and my roommate), this soup is just what the Dr. ordered.  Easy and clean, and tasty.

I will definitely make this again. I cut the recipe because there are only 2 of us. I made it using chicken broth. I also made it in my instant pot. I sautéed the chunks of chicken breasts in the pot with the onions and garlic and set the pot to cook for 7 minutes. Opened it and added gluten free spaghetti and frozen corn and cooked in 5 more minutes. I opened it and added a can of green beans and let it sit for a few minutes on keep warm and served it. My hubby loved it. It was great on a rainy day in Hawaii. I didn't have any carrots or celery but I will add them the next time too. I think without the extras it would have been bland but it was a good place to start.

Very good!!  I didn't have any garlic on hand, so I put a few dashes of garlic powder.  I also used 3/4 to 1lb of spaghetti instead of the half, we like noodles.  Only changes I made to the taste of the recipe was definitely adding black pepper & a little more salt.  It tasted very good.  But after reading others reviews, I added cream of chicken soup.  It was good either way.  Will definitely make again.

I was a little skeptical of using water and not broth. But after boiling for 30 minutes, it all evaporated away! It was delicious!

I used 4 cups of chicken broth, 2 cans of cream of chicken soup & 4 bouillon cubes with 4 cups of water. I added garlic salt, Italian seasoning & poultry seasoning. Next time I will added vegetables and see how that turns out

The first time I made it per recipe but added some garlic.. The second time I added a bunch of extra stuff.. I sauteed the girl c and onions then added the water and 1 cup of low sodium organic chicken broth. I added carrots, celery and 2 halves chicken. After simmering for 15-20 min I added the No-Yolk noodles and simmered for another 15 min. My kids ate it all up!.. Oh, I minced the onions, carrots and celery so my kids don't complain. Picky eaters!

This soup was really easy! My family loved it!  I added some carrots at the same time as the onions and I added 16oz of noodles because my family likes mostly noodles.  I was mad because there wasnt any left for lunch the next day! Great soup! My family was begging me to make it for dinner the next night! Will make a million more times
