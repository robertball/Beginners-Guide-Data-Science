I smoked my own brisket. This wrap made itself as I always have tortilla's around. I did add bbq sauce & sliced jalapeno jack cheese. Delish! Next time, I will add creamy slices of avocado. Add some chips or pasta/potato/fruit salad and you have a perfect lunch or dinner! Thank You K_Lynn. Winner::)
