Great shake!  I did not have frozen OJ concentrate, so I substituted a 1/4 to 1/2 of a cup of OJ and about 9 ice cubes.  It was very tasty.

I can't believe how delicious this smoothie is.  I modified it a bit to make it a little more "carb" balanced but nonetheless, this is a smoothie that I make before a workout or for breakfast when I'm on the run!  Thanks for a yummy smoothie Stephanie.

Yummy.  This is a great morning drink, I loved it.  I used strawberries instead, I didn't have raspberries.  I wouldn't change a thing, perfect as it is.

I had leftover soft tofu to use up so I tried this.  I used regular milk and used a clementine instead of the orange juice.  The banana and raspberries were frozen, which I think made the recipe better.  I was suprised that this wasn't overly tart.  This is creamy and tasty.

This shake was incredibly bland, it might be better with more flavorful and bold fruits.

I didn't have raspberries so I added fresh strawberries and some frozen blackberries.  This is my first experience with a tofu recipe.  I feel so healthy!

Had a box of silken tofu that was about to expire and a search turned up this recipe. I added a few ice cubes to thicken it.   It is delicous!

3 stars               I substituted blackberries and almond milk. It was okay, but might have been better had the berries been frozen.  The banana took over the flavor-I would use a lot less.
