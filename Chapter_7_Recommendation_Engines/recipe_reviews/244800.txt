Made them for the first time. I used Flax seed for the cocoa nibs because I couldn't find them. First batch turned out good. It was a small amount so I made another and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder. Tastey!

Delicious little addictive things! I cut the recipe in half and followed the subs in the Cook's Notes using peanut butter for the almond butter  and ground flax seed for the cocoa nibs. I do think less than 1/4 cup ground flax seed should be used. I used a little more than 2 T. for half the recipe.

Don't make these unless you have impulse control.  They are very addictive.

Used Maple flavored Jif and they we so great!  Daughter loved them and unfortunately so did all her friends at lunch .  Making more for sure.  I used Chia seeds and regular sweetened coconut.  All we had in the cupboard and were perfect
