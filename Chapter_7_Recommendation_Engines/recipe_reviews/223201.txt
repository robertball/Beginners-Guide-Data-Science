It's the middle of a snowy Wisconsin winter but I didn't let that stop me from making this.  I followed the directions with the foil pouch, but just slipped it in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Hubs always turns his nose up when I make zucchini, but not this time. It came out flavorful and crisp/tender, which he appreciated.  (I tend to like mine on the soft, well-cooked side).  I didn't use the cayenne pepper, preferring to substitute my seasoning of choice which in this case was just some sort of seasoning blend in the cupboard. This will be a repeat. It's nice to keep Hubs happy.

Baked in the oven at 375 in a covered pan until tender. If you don't like things spicy, you better reduce the peppers!

So, so good! I have never used cayenne pepper on my zucchini & squash before, but that little bit of heat was really tasty.

It came out more spicy than expected; but otherwise, I loved this. Next time I'll use less cayenne pepper though.

What a momma does to do for her squash loving kiddo ;-) Recipe was easy to follow, I didn't try myself because of allergies, so I'm basing this off the 4 girls that would eat it. I did doubled the squash and zucchini and left everything else the same because I saw the amount of cayenne. While the older 2 girls said "love it love it" with the spice, the 2 younger girls said HOT!! and grabbed for drinks. Will make again for them but will totally cut the cayenne down by half.

I liked this recipe.  However the cayenne pepper made it too spicy.  I didn't add the suggested amount and still removed as much of it as I could and sprinkled parmesan cheese on instead.  Will make this again but without the cayenne pepper.

This was such an easy recipe and the veggies tasted great!  I skimped on the red pepper, which made it perfect for my family.  Summer grilling at its best!

Nice, but WAY too much black pepper. I’d only use a teaspoon instead.

The measurements as is make the dish way too spicy. Definitely adjust to at least half of what’s listed. Otherwise, the lemon is a great touch.

A delicious combination of flavors for those summer veggies.  This was kid friendly for us (but my children like vegetables).  Most of us in our family like the heat, but for the one that doesn't, Lawry's seasoning salt is a great substitute for the cayenne with delicious results.  So if you have some that like the heat and others that don't, split the portion and bake one pan/foil packet with cayenne and other with Lawry's or other seasoning salt.  Everyone is happy!

Used zucchini and some other type of Asian squash we thought we'd try. Forget what the name of it was. I'll check again at the store this week and then update my review.  Couldn't get yellow squash and no other squash was going to slice up similar to the zucchini.  It IS quite a bit hotter than you might expect but the flavor is very good.  If you're not fond of spicy, you might want to go easy on the cayenne the first time you try this. I grilled mine using the foil inside a veggie grilling basket for 30 minutes which was at least 10 minutes too long.  It was overdone.  Still tasted good but next time, I'll set the timer for 20 minutes and test it.  Thanks for this. Nice alternative to the usual grilled side.

IT Was alright. I think I did something wrong cause the bottom squash and zuchinni were soggy and the top were had hardly any marinade in them. I think it was I had too many veggies in too small a piece of foil and they stacked too high in a ball almost...but I followed the direction....oh well

Way too much pepper.  If I make it again, I'll use only 1/2 teaspoon.  We can always add more at the table.

My husband really likes this.  We slice the squash lengthwise,  so they won't fall through the grill. The thinner the better, as it will also crisp, and the crunchy texture around the edges is nice.   He puts a brown sugar/olive oil 'rub' on it (will try honey next time).  The sugar caramelizes (MMMmmm).    MUST SERVE HOT-right off the grill.

Who doesn't love zucchini and yellow squash together in a nice light dish? I have been making mine this way forever, it seems. Last night, I wanted to switch it up and use red onion in place of the yellow squash. I didn't use the foil this time which would been the better choice but I used my grill pan instead. I wanted the char marks on this it was raining so stove top it became smile emoticon:-) I also sprinkled some feta on the top. Delicious!

got okay from family, we added Parmesan cheese at the table and that made it a little better.  If I make it again would add grated onion, and grill longer than 30 minutes.
