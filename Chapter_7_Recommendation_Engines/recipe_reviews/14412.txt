This is a great recipe, one handed down through many generations.  My version is it a bit different as I add some dry mustard to dressing (make sure you mix your mayo, oil and vinegar well...this helps keep the coating adhered to the potatoes) then I add in a chopped hard boil egg.  Also, if you quarter your potatoes, boil them till done (not mushy though) cool them a bit, the skins come off easily and you can cut them into bit size chunks. The flavor of the potato is better if you cook them with the skins on.

I served this at an Oktoberfest party recently and the crowd went wild!  Even people who said they didn't like potato salad in general had to try some just from the raves everyone else was giving it!  

Be warned though, I nibbled on it just after making it - before it had time to sit for 24 hours - and I thought it would be horrible.  I even went out and bought store-brand deli potato salad thinking I couldn't serve this at my party.  It was amazing the difference some time in the fridge made!!  Once the flavors had a chance to combine, this was the best potato salad I have had in a long time - I will definitely be making it again!

I was looking for the Austrian potato salad I loved during my year in Austria.  After several disasterous attempts with other recipes, I found this one and gave it a try.  Though it didn't look or taste much like Austrian potato salad, it tasted WONDERFUL.  I wanted to keep the whole bowl to myself!  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, which seemed to give it an added zing.

I rarely have success with Potato Salad, but I followed this exactly and everyone LOVED it.  It's easy and a keeper!!!  The only potatoes I had were red. Did not peel-sliced them about 1/8" thick, added potatoes to boiling water and cooked for about 15 min. They came out just right for the salad.  Update: Since the first time I made this recipe I cannot tell you how many times I've made it since - everyone loves it and keeps requesting me to make it.

This was a really good recipe.  I used quartered red potatoes and it came out great.  Definitely better the 2nd day...the vinegar aftertaste goes away completely after it sits in the fridge overnight.

This one is a keeper. Once you've tried it you'll make it over & over again! I scaled this recipe down for 2 & it turned out great.
I also added a handful of Bacos, which gave it a little more zip

Thank you so very much for this wonderful recipe.  It is easy, and very pleasing to my whole family. In fact my son that doesn't even cook, asked how to do this, and he is able to make this one come out every time.  It is perfect and one of my favorite's.  A+
You can leave the potato skins on as well, it gives it a nice looks as well....

Too much vinegar! Perhaps this dish needed more mayonnaise, but I don't know. Aside from the vinegar the potatoes were rather bland. It sure wasn't what I was expecting. I tried it hot and I tried it cold. I will have to look somewhere else on the net for a better recipe. I give it 3.5 with lots of room to improve.

This recipe is delicious! It really reminds me of one o the potato salads I had while living in Germany! (FYI potato salad to Germans is like Chili to Americans - every Region/Family/BUndesland has their own special recipe and they are all delicious!)  I substituted honey dijon mustard for the sugar in the recipe. This change gave the sauce an extra tang and a faint caramel color.   Guten Appetit!

This recipe is very good and authentic! A couple hints though...German potato salad is supposed to be a little tangy, so just be cognizant that it won't be sweet. Use good mayo, cheap stuff can really ruin a good recipe! Lastly, I let mine sit for two days in the fridge (I made it ahead of time for a party)...the flavor just got better everyday, let yours sit for at least a day, it makes a huge difference.

I made this for an Oktoberfest party, and my friend from Germany raved that it was the first time he'd had "German Potato Salad" in America that actually tasted like his grandmother's.  He vetoed the "gentle stirring" and mashed it like a dervish, claiming that was how it was supposed to be -- so if yours comes out more like mashed potatoes than salad, just tell your guests you're being extremely authentic.

We really loved this recipe.  I made a few minor changes.  I used 2T Balsamic Vin. (and subtracted it from the Cider Vin.) and sauted the onions instead of adding them raw.  I used several kinds of small potatoes which made the salad even better.  I would pour the dressing over the potatoes instead of adding the potatoes to the dressing.  We added the potato salad to mixed greens and made a meal of them.  I think you'll be really pleased with this one.

This is an outstanding German potato salad!  Even my picky teenager (who will NOT eat regular potato salad) eats this and asks for more.  The only big change I made was to use a bit of dried dill in it for another layer of flavor.  I did use red potatoes (which don't turn to mush when you boil them), and dehydrated minced onion for convenience.  For those who are afraid to use the 2 teaspoons of salt listed, trust me - the potato salad NEEDS it.  The people I know who have tried this recipe and didn't like it are the ones who wouldn't use the full amount of salt.  It *does not* turn out salty (the potatoes absorb all of that wonderful flavor if you pour the dressing on while potatoes are still hot).  Aside from the above mentioned tweaks, the recipe is perfect as originally written.  This one is in my regular recipe rotation.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is really good served with sauerkraut.  Just watch how long you cook the potatoes.  The first time I cooked this dish, I cooked the potatoes the full 15 minutes and the potatoes turned to mush.

LOVED IT ~ JUST PREPPED THIS FOR MEMORIAL DAY LUNCH. I USED RED POTATOES & LEFT THE SKIN ON FOR MORE COLOR & USED A YELLOW ONION. I ALTERED NOTHING ELSE. GREAT TASTE, VINEGAR AMOUNT WAS PERFECT TO ME, NOT TOO SWEET, NOT TOO SOUR =) A DEFINITE PLAN TO MAKE THIS IN THE NEAR FUTURE!

Really great recipe.  It tastes just like my Great-grandma used to make, and she was from Germany.  The only change I made was using lime or lemon juice instead of vinegar since that is what she always did whenever she had the option.  Doing this makes it taste more like a gourmet version.

This is the best! I've made it a few times and my husband and company loved it! In my opinion, it has the perfect amount of vineger deespite what the other reviews say. You can always use less if you wish, but I wouldn't change a thing!

I have made it twice and it was a big hit each time. Everyone asked for the recipe. Don't try to skip a step like I did the first time. You need to wisk together the mayo and vinegar well before you add to the potatoes. Otherwise it doesn't blend well.

This was perfect for Oktoberfest.  I've made it as the recipe states and it is great, but next time around I added my own flavor as usual.  I felt bacon was in order for this recipe. so after cooking up the bacon, I sauteed the onion in the bacon grease.  I did drain off the grease from the onions before adding, and then when making the dressing I reduced the oil by a TBLS or so.  Everyone raved.  Great with brats!  Make the night before to really let all the flavors marry. TIP:  Pour the dressing on the warm potatos and carefylly toss.  Use red potatoes and dont peel just slice, it adds a nice color.

This recipe is awesome!  Not like a regular German Potato Salad but better!  I did add two chopped hard-cooked eggs to the potatoes and onions before adding the dressing and I added 1/2 tsp dried mustard to the dressing.  You have to whip the dressing a little with a whisk to make it creamy and then add it.  It is a very good recipe...thanks!

This was my first attempt at making potato salad. I followed everything exactly and it was a disaster. I cooked the potatoes for 15 minutes, which ended up being way to long. In the end, I had lumpy mashed potatoes with a wierd vinegary flavor. I took it to 3 different gatherings and no one would eat it. Embarrassing! Thanks anyway though.

The recipe longs for more mayonnaise and less vinegar. Anyway it has nothing to do with Oktoberfest. I southern Germany potatoe salad is always made with oil and vinegar and never with mayonnaise. The varieties with mayo are only found in the northern parts of aou country.

It bothers me when people rate a recipe but they changed it so much it's not even close to the original. So, before I say what I did, making this as is will be very good and you'll probably love it. I used red wine vin instead b/c I didn't have cider vin, added a tsp of spicy mustard to the sauce and added 2 boiled eggs and a couple of stalks of finely diced celerey for crunch, and it's killer. I am AWFUL at making potato salad, so I was pretty impressed. I also boiled the potatoes in their skins. I liked that idea. It's actually quicker & easlier to peel them that way.

Tastes just like in Munich!  I would go a little lighter on the mayo and a little heavier on the vinegar just for appearances sake but the taste is 100%

What a wonderful recipe!  This one is worth keeping potatoes on hand for.  I substituted one teaspoon of regular salt with celery salt, added a handful of bacon bits and I can't even let it sit for the recommended hour before sneaking bites.

I have made this recipe three times -- and each was wonderful!  First, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I added a T of mustard.  The third, some grated horseradish.  This is the perfect side dish for sausages!  Thanks, luvs2bake!!

My friends and I loved this recipe.  I made one slight change I used rice vinigar instead of regular because I heard it was more mild and good for dressings because of this.  It turned out terrific.

This was the best potato salad I have ever made.  I took another reviewers advice and used red potatos without peeling and added a half a cup of bacos.

Then longer it sits the tastier it gets...two thumbs up!

I really like this stuff.  When I made it, I didn't use all of the cider vinegar called for, and it was great.  Don't know what it is like with all of the vinegar, tho.  I am, however, convinced that none of the other kids in college like or are willing to try any form of potato salad.  Everyone who tried it said they liked it, except for one guy who gagged and promptly went to the WC to spit it out.

Terrific potato salad. My husband,German, thinks it is the best ever. I like American potato salad but thought I'd give this a try for him. It is a hit with friends as well. Perfect. Thank you for this recipe.

We decided to do our own Oktoberfest at home and I made this potato salad. It was very easy and a big hit with the family. After reading several reviews I went with the suggestions to make it ahead and put it in the fridge the night before. The only change I made to the recipe was I omitted the dried parsley (didn't have it on hand) and substituted dried dill. The dressing seemed like too much when I poured it on but after sitting overnight it was perfect. Not too soggy, not too dry. It went perfectly with the sausage and sauerkraut. Will make this again.

Great authentic recipe! I boil my red skin potatoes in vegetable broth and it adds more flavor to the salad. I make the salad one day before and let it chill in the fridge. That really enhances the flavor!

I tried this at a party and the next day I HAD to make some for myself.  It is delicious.  I know some people don't like warm potato salad but this is the only way I would ever want to eat it.  I added some caramelized onions to this and it turned out great.  It is a little bit vinegary but you can just use less of it. Fresh cracked pepper is great with this dish as well.

I leave the skin on the potatoes and just add diced celery and crumbled bacon and sometimes chopped hard-boiled eggs. I've made this recipe several times. Everyone loves it! My brother-in-law who never gets up to get seconds always gets seconds of this delicious Potato salad.

Doubled the recipe and turned out well- except for the fact that it was too vinegary- even after I only added 2/3 cup of apple cider vinegar. Next time, I will use much less.

I found my potatos were over cooked but even mashed the flavor was excellent. I will try this again with red potatos. Someone said they stay together better. Its even better the next day.

Excellent dish! I didn't have parsley on hand so I substituted it with some rosemary and thyme. It turned out great! The cider vinegar gives it a wonderful flavor. Will make this again and again.

This recipe is fantastic, but here are 2 quick fixes that make it perfect... Use 1/4 vinegar, instead of 1/2 cup and add an extra tbsp. or two of sugar. ^_^ Cheers!

My new favorite potato salad!  It's wonderfully tangy, and the onion really makes it so flavorful.  I love vinegar based salad mixes and dressings and crave them often.  This potato salad really satisfies that craving.

This was a good potato salad, but the vinegar flavor went beyond "zing" to "tart."  A little too much for me to really love it.

Excellent recipe.  I used a combination of red and russet potatoes with sweet onion.  I kept all of the ratios the same.  Just what I was looking for!

I made it using 1/2 the vinegar.  Added dried dill, chopped onion and celery, salt and pepper.  I have eaten half of it already!   It has mellowed as the day wears on. The dressing seemed very soupy  but the potatoes must soak it up. I had refrigerated the boiled potatoes overnight, so I heated them up in the microwave,chopped them up and then added the dressing. I also added 2 chopped hard boiled eggs.

This was a very good recipe that I had to tweak a bit as I was trying to recreate my Mom's potato salad.  I at first did not add the sugar but this resulted in a too tangy taste so I mixed up a couple of tblsp mayo with the 2 tblsp of white sugar and stirred that in.  Perfect----I also added sour cream and did not use the oil---seemed like overkill with the mayo, and Mom never used oil in hers.  Topped with fresh chopped parsley.  Next time I will add some celery and red onion for a bit more kick.

This recipe was great!  I added a few things:  6 strips of chopped bacon, one tablespoon of dijon mustard, and I substituted red onion for the regular white.  I will definitely make it again!

Excellent German Potato Salad - a keeper.  We did cut back on the vinegar to 1/4 c. based on other reviews.  We also added 6 slices of cooked, crumbled bacon, and two chopped hard boiled eggs.  We served it with Vienna Schnitzel, found here, and sauerkraut.

Loved this!  So much so that I made it 2 nights in a row!  Used just slightly less vinegar than called for and maybe a little more onion, otherwise made as directed.  My new favorite grilling side dish!

This is the best potato salad (outside of restaurants) that I have ever had...homemade.  I agree with all other reviewers that the amount of vinegar is too strong, so I also cut back and used white vinegar instead of cider.  I made this recipe for my co-workers and everyone wanted the recipe, it was that good.  My husband also really liked it which told me sooooo much.  Definitely a keeper and a recipe to make over and over again.

This was quite good!  I took the advice of other reviews and reduced the vinegar by a little; I "tasted" the result every few hours and definitely found that it mellows out over time.  By day two, the balance of flavors was just right.  I had no dried parsley, so I used a tablespoon of tarragon and was very happy with the result.  I'd definitely make this again on (or the day before!) a hot summer day.

We served this with German Rouladen and it was an excellent side dish. Next time I might use a little less vinegar so it's not quite so powerful.

I enjoyed this potato salad but I will tweak it a bit as I found it too liquidy.  I think by cutting the vinegar a bit it will help.

this was a great recipe. i smashed my potatoes instead of slicing.  also i halved the recipe as well since there's only two at my dinner table. i would prefer a less vinegar flavor, but that's a personal thing. my husband, who eats vinegar on all veggies, thought it was was excellent.

This was wonderful.  I ran out of regular vinegar so I used 1/4 cup of balsalmic  and then I ran out of sugar, so I used splenda. I also didn't peel the potatoes to increase the fiber content of the dish.  Delicious result!

This potato salad was very good, but I'd call it an all American potato salad, not German. Both of my parents are from Germany and we make it with bacon, some of the bacon fat, onions and vinegar. We did love it though!

I made this for an Oktoberfest party and served it with Wisconsin Bratwurst and Kraut  I made the apple kuchen for dessert.  Everyone loved it.  The potato salad was excellent.  Almost everyone went for seconds and we got lots of compliments.  THis one is a winner.

This is an excellent recipe, I modified it slightly by adding 8 slices of crumbled bacon, used fresh parsley instead of dried parsley, red skin potatoes, and vidalia onions.  Superb flavor changes as it cools and the onions become more pronounced, excellent with BBQ ribs.  Recommended!

I really liked this potato salad.  I am not a fan of traditional potato salad and this one is definitely not my mothers potato salad recipe.  I did serve it with grilled brats and kraut and everybody loved it.  I'll make this again this summer.

I normally make the hot German potato salad with bacon, but I forgot the bacon at the grocers....so this looked good and..... it really IS good. I didn't realize I was out of sugar too (ugh) so I used truvia (2 tbsp made it a tad too sweet in my opinion so I think I will cut it back to 1 1/2 next time around), but everything else was by the recipe. My husband who was born and raised in Wisconsin loved it.  "I" loved the flavor contrast that the sugar and vinegar made to this side dish. I'd tell you about the next day's flavor but.... we didn't have any leftovers! Always a good sign in our house.

This is a GREAT recipe! My husband came across this one when he was looking for something different and this fit the bill. When we first tried it we COMPLETELY agreed with the reviews that said it was too much vinegar and was a bit disappointed, but trying it the next day was a different story. It was AMAZING!! I am dying to try it with some boiled eggs and celery thrown in with it but my husband is a purist. :) have also subbed the rice vinegar for the cider vinegar with great results.

Be sure to let this refrigerate for 24 hours.  It is really great!  I added real bacon bits the second time I made it for my bacon loving family, it was good too!  It's a keeper for German potato salad fans.

This is a wonderful, easy potato salad recipe.  Wanted something a little easier than mom's & grandma's.  I did add celery & chopped chives.  I may add sliced radishes & diced baby gerkins the next time.  I tried this the first time with just white vinegar that was ok, but the second time I used a good cider vingegar and it doesn't have the bite it did before. 
   I didn't peel & slice my potatoes first.  I boiled the potatoes in their skins and then the skin just peels away.  An old trick of my moms.  I used white potatoes. I'll be making this one a lot.

added diced bacon (thick cut, well done,3 strips), finely diced sweet carrot & red bell pepper (for color & taste, a 3+ tablespoons), scallions. Mixing mayo/oil/vinegar/sugar before is a good idea.  Set for 10 hours resulting in immersed flavor ... Enjoy!!!

I pour the vinegar over the warm potatoes and let them cool absorbing the vinegar before adding mayo, chopped onions, chopped celery, hard boiled eggs, little dijon mustard and some dill relish. Then refrigerate till cool. Sort of a mix between German and Southern!

Maybe I'm not a big tater salad fan, but this was okay.  It was prepared as written and presented to a number of German friends and colleagues.  They suggested more mayo and a little less vinegar.

A very nice recipe for a party.  I mixed the mayonnaise, oil, vinegar, sugar, parsley, salt and pepper mixture prior to making the potatoes to save time.  My boyfriend said it was awesome.  He ate the entire portion that was left over for lunch.

Really loved this recipe. Made a few of my own changes like adding cooked bacon, then browned the onions in the bacon grease, used miracle whip instead of mayo, and chopped boiled eggs, and celery seed. This reminds me of my mom's recipe from many years ago.

I am so glad there are leftovers today!  I made this last night for dinner and I followed this recipe exactly.  It was wonderful!  I thought the sauce was going to be too runny, but when you add it to the potatoes and let it meld in the fridge, it soaks up the starches from the potatoes and gets thicker.  I served with a Buffalo BBQ meatloaf and they complemented well.

My boyfriend loves potato salad. I tried this recipe as a change of pace and he can't stop talking about it. He said this is the best potatoe salad he has ever had.   The only changes I made were to cut the oil in half and toss in crumbled bacon.   Thanks for the great recipe.

Overall a good recipe. If I make it again I will only add 1/2 the vinegar and a cup of mayo. It seemed to be missing something. I might add some more pepper and onion powder.

this is an excellent recipe, i grew up with my grandmother making german potato salad, and it wasn't like the think type you find in the stores. This recipe is as close to it as I've come. I didn't have any parsley on hand, so i used 2tsp of dried dill...wonderful!

This was really, really good! I followed the recipe exactly, and wouldn't change a thing, except I am thinking I might add a little dill next time. Also, be sure to let it sit at least an hour before serving (the longer the better!). The initial taste isn't nearly as good as after this has had time to sit a while.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome. Reminds me of the store-bought version in Germany (this is a compliment), which I didn't think I could copy! Now, I can make my favourite store-bought at home. And it's so easy. I like to heat the chopped onion and dressing in the microwave and pour this warm dressing over cooled potatoes. Less chance of turning to mush.

Husband raved about this one and I will probably make it again. Cooked according to the directions and let it sit for a few hours in the frig before serving.

I am giving this recipe 5 Stars, because it's pretty good. However, it is not the kind of potato salad served in Bavaria. Bavarians don't use majonaise, at all, in their potato salad.

I brought this to my Dad's house on Labor Day and everyone loved it. This is a very good recipe and it was dubbed authentic by my family. I have also noticed that a lot of people who don't like traditional potato salad tend to like German potato salad.

Thank you for this. I used red skin potatoes and they worked fine, (only boil for about 8 min though.)and since I don't keep/ care for parsley, I used dill weed, garlic powder, and lemon thyme... all coming together for a wonderfully flavored dish.

This was okay. It does not compare to my husband's family recipe for german potato salad though. Everyone has different tastes though. We just prefer more of a vinegar taste. Thank you.

our family and friends loves this recipe. i sprinkle a little cider vinegar on the onions and potatoes while still hot (it seems to infuse a bit more vinegar taste) and add chopped celery. i reduce the vinegar in the dressing a bit since i already added some to the potatoes. this ones a keeper.

Have made this potato salad about four times for various parties, and it goes fast every time.  Very easy to make, and I generally supplement with fresh parsley when I have it in the garden.  Will make again and again!

really good but I would add just a little less vinegar next time. I took this to work and half the people thought it was just right and half thought it had too much vinegar, but everyone ate it.

I have a friend from Germany who makes great potato salad.  She told me the ingredients but no measurements.  I found this recipe here and it is the same.  I think hers is better but it was still good.  A little more vinegar tasting than I prefer so next time I think I will reduce the amt.  Otherwise very good though.  And it does taste better after it sits a while.

I love this potato salad! It has become my go-to recipe and every time I make it is a success. I'll bring it to friends or family bbq's and always everyone complements me for it. I love the tangy taste the vinegar gives to it, and I like that is not too creamy.

I loved this potato salad, but my husband found the vinegar was too much, even on day 2. I'm going to try decreasing the vinegar next time I make it so he can enjoy it too. As for me, I could eat this several times a week exactly as it's written.

Super delicious!! I added a couple of hard-boiled eggs, some celery, dried dill, a spoon of German mustard, and a tiny bit less vinegar. I used olive oil because it's what I had on hand. I will make this again.

OK, but will use wine or sherry vinegar next time  My Austrian MIL would never use mayo .  More the bacon fat/vinegar type . One thing special about hers was she boiled banana potatoes. She called them kipferl SP? potatoes.  They are waxy and hold their shape.  They are small and curved, thus ''bananapotatoes'' Peel and slice when tender. This needs to sit pref. overnight and then u can adjust the sweet/sour/salty flavors.

Good recipe. I have a favorite recipe but didn't have it with me so I used this one instead. I liked it because it used mayo instead of cooking a sauce of bacon grease, flour, vinegar, sugar and onions, it made it a quicker preparation. I did make some additions to "dude it up" as my husband would say. The  3 things I did differently are halved the vinegar, added celery seed and bacon.

Absolutely stellar!  Love this recipe though I wouldn't use as much vinegar!  The only difference is I sliced my potatoes  (the potatoes look cubed in the photo even though the recipe says sliced)... purely for nostalgic reasons... my German mother sliced the potatoes and it feels like she is here when I make it that way. :)

Wow!  This was so good.  I only used half the vinegar, everything else was to recipe.  It was so super good.  Hubby loves it, too. Thank you so much for sharing.

My family loved this potato salad. Even my aunt who doesn't ever eat potato salad went back for seconds. You really do need to let this sit the hour to bring out all the flavors. I taste tested at different stages and the hour was perfect. I will be serving this again!!

This was a big hit when I served It last night with brats and a red cabbage and apple slaw.  I made a couple of small modifications.  As in the recipe photo, I used sliced small red potatoes with skin on.  When I checked them after 11 minutes they were probably a minute overdone, so watch the time.  I used Miracle Whip light (which upped the vinegar taste which another reviewer complained about) and Truvia blend (half sugar) to cut back a bit on the calories.  I refrigerated the salad until an hour before dinner (no eggs in the dressing) so that it was room temperature when served.  (The recipe didn't specify temp.) One of my guests is a big German potato salad fan and had thirds. I'll definitely make it again!

Minxybaby is wrong. I am so used to folks making sweet German potato salad and that is not what my grandmother made. This was so close to my grandmothers Texas German potato salad that I swore she was standing beside me in the kitchen giving me pointers. Luvs2bake, than you for the memories. This took me back 50 years and put a smile on my face.  Wunderbar!

Made this for an event and it was well received. I'm more of a vinegar based fan for my german potato salad. This was more of a southern style to me.

Yum!  Made this in the a.m. for supper in the evening & served it on a small salad plate on spinach & salad greens (yeah, more greens worked into the meal!) w/small'sh carrot sticks & fresh baked rye bread on the side, all as accompaniments to red beans seasoned with sauerkraut, caraway, & yellow mustard (one of my favorite, vegetarian fall dishes). It was nice to finally have a great side to go with that bean soup. My husband, daughter & I all thought this was terrific. One of our sons wanted a tad less vinegar, but enjoyed the salad without an overnight-melding. However, one of our sons still despises cold potatoes. Next time he'll try this hot? I minced the onion somewhat fine, but it still had a nice crispness to it when we ate the salad (I have quite a bit of chopped onion leftover from a party this weekend-so heeped the 1/2 C measure a little) & it was the just right amount. I have trouble w/white sugar, so I used 1 Tbsp raw sugar and equiv. of 1 Tbsp stevia. Otherwise, made this recipe as written (well, my potatoes overcooked just a tiny bit, but I thought the texture was great when the slices fell apart a bit). Now I'm wondering whether or not I'll toy with the recipe by adding more onion, just to see if more is still good, or trying thinly sliced celery, or an egg, as other reviewers have, or possibly adding a touch of dill. Both my husband & I wondered how that would taste.  But I'm only thinking that because I'm sure we'll be making this again! Thanks luvs2bake!

Delicious and a huge hit at dinner!  I made it with the German style pork chops.  I did tweek the recipe a wee bit however.  I blended the vegetable oil with an equal portion of the bacon drippings.  Also I added two hard boiled eggs sliced along with a full package of the very thinly sliced bacon (cut the bacon when it is parfrozen at a 90 to the strips in cuts about a half inch in width; cook the bacon, drain it and let it set up to a nice crunchy bite).  Mix the bacon into the diced potato bowl and fold in the balance of the mixture.  I would also suggest a pinch of ground yellow mustard.  Let the whole salad chill for about an hour and serve as a cold side dish alongside the German Style pork chops.  Mmmmm...

This went together very quickly and I was eager to try it, but decided to give it some "standing time".  I actually waited 36 hours before serving it with sauerkraut and sausage.  We found the vinegar still over-powering even after sitting for a day and a half.  I will cut the vinegar by half and try it again.  

Fifteen minutes for the potatoes was too much.  I cooked mine for 12 minutes and they still turned mushy when I stirred them together with the dressing.  I like the idea of slicing them instead of cutting in chunks, so I will try 10 minutes next time.

Next time I will also try a different herb than parsley.  Parsley is too bland in this salad.

The guys were fighting over who got to eat the left overs. One of whom is my brother, who typically hates potato salad or anything with mayonaise. We have agreed, this is now our go-to potato salad.

Very nice salad !   Like my pasta sauces, i have a few "favorite" potato salads.  Everytime i make this, i  always get asked for the recipe.  ONE excellent variation i make is to add chopped BACON pieces to it, and make sure the onions are chopped real "fine"    people  love  it  !

This is a great potato salad.  I love how quickly it comes together. 
As mentioned by other reviewers, the flavors really do come together as it sits.   
I did omit the oil entirely and still found it to be plenty moist.

I have made this recipe many times and have received raves every time.  I get a request to make it when invited to a BBQ or house party.  Has a nice "bite" to it.  I love it.  It does have to age in the fridge for a day to bring out all the flavours.  I serve it cold.

Delicious!  Not the way I grew up making potato salad with my mom, but I really like this recipe.  I had no cider vinegar so I substituted 1/3 C rice wine vinegar, and it came out great!

My family did not care for this.  We love German Potato Salad, but did not like this one.

Really great!  The first time I made it I let it sit overnight and everyone finished it at the party.  It went fast.  Many requests to make again!

Very authentic, dissapeared very quickly at our annual Oktoberfest and I used 10 pounds of potatos.  Absolutely deliscious!  I let is sit for 24 hours in the fridge, flavor was superb!

I overcooked the potatoes a little, so it was similar to a mashed potato salad, BUT got rave reviews and EVERYONE wants the recipe.  Will definitely make again. Was very quick, oh so easy, and satisfying.

Really enjoyed.  The second time I made it, I added extra onion, however it seemed to be too overpowering. The ingredients/quantities as listed are great.  PS:  The picture does not do this recipe justice.

This is effectively my family recipe - I was on here looking for one pointer as I don't have my mom to refer back to anymore.  This gave me the pointer I needed and the potato salad was a hit!  My husband didn't know I could do such things and our friends were quite complimentary!

I left out the mayo, and added bacon this was awesome. Almost like a potato salad I had in Germany at Octoberfest.

It was okay. I did as the others suggested and decreased the vinegar but definatly not enough! It ended up being one of those left overs that just sit in the fridge. I don't think I would make it again.
