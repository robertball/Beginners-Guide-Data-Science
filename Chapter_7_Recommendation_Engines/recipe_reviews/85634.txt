I use this recipe with pork and only use the dry rub part of the recipe. I find that the meat comes out so moist and delicious that there's really no need for the mop sauce. I also add a little more cinammon and paprika than the recipe calls for as I find this really gives a wonderful warmth at the back of your throat. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!!

Very good rub, omitted the cayenne.  Rinsed ribs in apple cider vinegar then boiled them for 45 mins. in water and 1c apple cider.  Rubbed them wrapped them in foil sprayed with pam grilled at 250/275 for 45 mins removed foil and grilled for another 15 or so mins.  Meat fell off the bone! Great flavor, thank you!

Very intense flavor.  I smoked mine for 3-4 hours, then wrapped them in foil for a 1/2 hour to rest them.  The meat comes off the bone and is meltingly tender to the last morsel. I saved the mop, boiled to reduce and served alongside the ribs.

We have an electric smoker so we used that. We used a piece of cherry wood and a smaller piece of apple wood for the smoke flavor. I didn't add any of the cayenne pepper and we didn't use the mop sauce at all. When the ribs were finished we applied a thin layer of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and finished them off.  These ribs were to die for!  After a few weeks of having them, the guests are still raving about them.

Delicious! I did not use the mop sauce, but instead just rubbed the meat with the spice rub and let marinade for a few hours. Baked at 350 degrees for 1.5 hours and finished off on the grill for approx. 30 mintes = PERFECT RIBS! This rub is fabulous and had everyone asking for my "secret recipe." Thanks so much - this is a keeper!

My Husband and I have NEVER cooked ribs before, so we tried this recipe.  It was EASY and WONDERFUL!!!!!  We cut down the chili powder and didnt add the hot sauce to the Mop Sauce because I have a baby mouth, but they still had a bite to them, and were TERRIFIC!!!  We deffinately will use this recipe again!  Its saved in my recipe box!!!

My husband has never been one for bbq sauce, so when i tried this recipe for the first time he LOVED IT. I changed the mop sauce a little, i used just plain 'ol apple juice (or cider) and some tobasco, and mopped throughout the entire cooking time. Gave just the right amount of sweetness to counteract the intense spiciness for the cayenne. A perfect sweet and spicy!

we have used this recipe now 3 or 4 times and it is a winner everytime. a little different a little spicy very very good, no sauce needed. we have smoked almost all of the baby back recipes on this site and this is definitely the best. whenever we try a new recipe we only cook half the new way and the other half this way just to be safe. THE BEST BARRED NONE.

THE FIRST TIME I MADE THESE, MY FAMILY LIKED THE RIBS SO MUCH WITH JUST THE RUB THERE WEREN'T ANY LEFT  TO SAUCE.  PLANNED THEM AGAIN FOR  FRIENDS  AND SLOW COOKED THEM  IN  250 OVEN FOR HOURS WITH  RUB AS WE HAD A FRIGHTFUL THUNDERSTORM AND EVERYONE LOVED THE VINEGERY COMPLIMENT OF THE SAUCE TO THE SPICY SWEET RUB,( I MAY HAVE HAD A HEAVY HAND WITH THE BROWN SUGAR)ONE OF THESE DAYS WILL GET THE SMOKER,MOP SAUCE AND RUB ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

This was great. My family are all BBQ lovers and this was as good as any restaraunt if not better than most. I did a mix of baby back and beef ribs with the same rub...equally great results.

I cooked the ribs for quite a bit longer though (maybe 6-7 hours total at a temp of 215-225 in my electric smoker). I used a mix of hickory and apple chips, alternating between the two. I also used a different mop sauce  This is going in my recipe book as my go to rib recipe...just perfect ribs! 

Thank you so much!

Absolutely to die for! I marinated the meat overnight and baked in an over for 3 1/2 hours at around 300. Then finished on the grill with the mop sauce. I did omit the apple cider and replaced it with chili sauce and it was still a little too runny for my taste, but very delicious. The meat was falling off the bone! I was heavenly! Will definitely make this recipe again.

I do not have a smoker or a grill, so I cooked my ribs in the oven at 325 degrees for about 2.5 hours. I used the dry rub, which was awesome! It gave the ribs an intense flavor. Instead of the mop sauce, I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. I coated the ribs with the sauce, front & back, several times during the last 1/2 hour of cooking. My husband loved 'em! I will make these again and again.

First time smoking pork ribs and after reading the reviews on this recipe, I decided to give it a shot.  The whole family LOVED it!!!  I did not use the mop sauce but the ribs turned out nice and moist.  Since most of the family likes spicy foods, I did increase some of the hotter spices and the slightly sweet flavor with added zing was awesome.  Definitely will use this recipe again.

You are my hero! Followed the rub recipe exactly. But, I baked my 4 pds. spare ribs in the oven at 275 for around 3 hours. Then, as i didn't have apple cider, or juice, I simply slathered bbq sauce over it, removed the lid, and continued baking 15 minutes longer. I really wanted to pig out on these. There is no way you could get a better rib ANYWHERE! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

The flavors are excellent.  I'm new to smoking, and to my smoker, and I just want to share for other newbies that you may need more time.  After 4 1/2 hours my meat was done, but I think another two hours would have made them fall off the bone.  Be ready to adjust time.

3 people in family liked, 2 didn't.  I left out the cumin and the wood chips.  I doubled the recipe...I personally liked the taste but didn't give 5 stars because not everyone in my house enjoyed them.

Excellent! I added Thai Chile pastr & Tabasco East Asian Chile sauce to the brush, to give the ribs a sweet & spicy taste. These ribs were the hit @ the cookout.

Great ribs - my dumb smoker wouldn't get hot enough so I had to finish in the oven.  Put the ribs in a dutch oven at 350 for 2 hours to finish off.  Came out super tender.    The rub is fantastic!  Plenty hot without the jal. seasonings.

My family loved this recipe. The rub is full of flavor. I will use less cinnamon next time. I marinated them for 3hrs, baked them @175 degrees for 4hrs and bbq'd them for 30 min for the added flavor. I mopped while bbq'ing, which I thought didnt add much more flavor. They were almost a little tough still and will try marinate the night before and cooking @ 250 next time. All in all great recipe!

Yummy!  These ribs turned out great!  My guests all seemed to enjoy them, and they had fun guessing all the spices that were in the recipe.  Slightly sweet, spicy, but not too hot.  (I left out the jalepeno ingredients because we had quite a few kids coming to the dinner.)  I will definitely be making this again.

These ribs were very tasty and enjoyed by all.  I left out the jalapeno and cayenne in the rub because I was cooking for people who can't handle any spice.  I put only 2 tsp of hot pepper sauce in the mop sauce.  The flavor was still very good, but if I was making it again for just my famil, I would definitely put the cayenne in (though maybe not the jalapeno.)  The recipe was easy to follow, and my husband had great success on the grill, even though he had no experience smoking anything.  Thanks for sharing!

The biggest complaint my husband and I had was that we ended up with way too much rub on the ribs--so next time I am going to use the rub a lot more sparingly.  But the flavor of the rub and the method of cooking the ribs was amazing.  I will definitely do it again.

Yummmmy!  Followed the rub recipe except for the omission of the cinnamon. (I'm sure it's good....I just can't!)  And just sprayed them in the smoker with some apple juice instead of the mop sauce.  Falling off the bone tender and yummy bark and meat flavor.  Also put some of the rub on some chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill.  Those were very good also!

I tried this for my first ever attempt at making ribs. I smoked them without using the Mop Sauce and they turned our really good. I used them to enter a Unit Fun Day and took home a 3rd place trophy. They were dubbed Colorado Style Ribs because of the spice and my being from Colorado.

These ribs were great, left out the jalepeno seasoning and cut down on the cayenne pepper a little, let sit with rub for 4 hours, then smoked them with hickory chips for 4 hours and finished cooking in the oven til done.  Everyone loved them.

Very good. My husband and I are always trying to find the "best rib recipe ever" I'm still looking, but this recipe is definitely up there! It's for sure "Not your every day smoked pork ribs" but that's what I love about it. Let's face it, anyone can put store bought bbq sauce on some ribs. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, so I only added 1/4 tbs of cayenne pepper, and 2 tbs of red pepper flakes. I left the rub on it for 24 hours, and cooked it over indirect heat at 250 degrees, for 8 hours. Overall, I would definitely make this again.

OMG! Spicy, sweet, 
moist and full of flavor.  This recipe is not for the faint at heart or the time to just grill and chill. I smoked a pork picnic shoulder instead of ribs. The rub is packed with flavor (or, intense as previous reviewers stated) and created an excellent bark.  I added fresh garlic cloves, a sprinkle of the leftover rub, and spiced rum in the mop sauce.  I used Sirachia (sp) sauce to add the heat in the mop.  Thank you Tanlor for a great recipe!

The rub was a bit too spicy for my taste.  Will omit the cayenne next time.  But otherwise the flavor was wonderful.  Cooked them ever so slowly in my smoker.  Definitely worth the time.

I smoke these ribs using this recipe and they were awesome. I did leave out an ingredient, it was the  jalapeno seasoning salt. I added all of the rest of the ingredients into the recipe that it called fot. I'll definitely make these ribs again and recommend that you do as well. they were sweet and spicy but still left the flavor of the meat to come through with it. I love them..

My family loved these ribs! I made the rub and left the ribs to marinate overnight. Fired up the smoker at 250 and cooked for 3.5 hours, then wrapped in foil for another hour at 225. (Used oak and added some soaked mesquite chunks hourly). Basted every hour with the sauce. Came out perfect!  I used some Louisiana hot sauce and a little Stubbs Original in the mopping sauce. The ribs came out a bit spicy, but they were so delicious.  I will definitely be making again.

This recipe is the best rib rub I've ever tasted.  I've made it twice.  The first time was exactly like the recipe and I couldn't get enough.  The second time I accidentally used Mexican hot chili powder.  It was a little on the hot side for me but still delicious.  Hands down the best I've ever tasted.

I was looking for a highly rated smoked ribs recipe here to try out in my  new electric  smoker, so I only tried the rub because I wasn't using a grill.   Ribs did have flavor, but then because I can't handle a lot of heat,  I only used 1 3/4 T of  the chili, and omitted the cayenne.  Maybe I should have made as written, but other reviews said it was very spicy.  Maybe I didn't put it on thick enough, but I don't see how I could have done it any different. I even put a little mustard on the ribs so the rub would stick.  I smoked at 225-240 for 6 hours....low and slow.  (Smoker) Recipes I've read say to wrap the ribs in heavy duty tin foil when they are 3/4 done,  that wasn't even mentioned here, as I recall.  I didn't want to wrestle with the ribs to do that, so I just poured some good BBQ sauce on them as they finished.  It would be great if people who have electric smokers would submit more of their favorites.. It would be much appreciated.  AND I think allrecipes should tell visitors they have specific recipes for different appliances, i.e. they also have recipes for electric pressure cookers, etc.  I belong to an electric smoker FaceBook group, and when I mentioned that there were recipes on this site for smoking, they thanked me for the heads up, even though they had been already familiar with allrecipes.com, they had no idea.  I  know, I shouldn't have even written a review, but  I just wanted to share some ideas.

This was excellent barbecue. I used pork ribs and followed the recipe exactly except for omitting cayenne from the rub.  We never used any barbecue sauce. The mop sauce helped keep the meat moist. I used apple wood chunks in the grill, which I have never tried before. I don't know if it added flavor or not.  I think you could bake these in an oven too. I rarely have time for this kind of cooking but it was worth it!

I used this recipe on both chicken and pork. The dry rub is very good and it didn't necessarily need the mop sauce but the vinegar base mop rub was good. I only used the apple vinegar.

Excellent-- we used this recipe on baby back pork ribs to break in our new Masterchef smoker.  Wonderful flavor.  The only suggestion I have is that whether you mop or not, it is important to remove your meat at 3/4 of complete time, wrap in foil and return to smoker or oven for the last quarter of cooking.  This is what gives the "fall off the bone but still a little bite resistance" texture

This was my first time making ribs. I did not foil them, because I thought it would be easier to use the mop sauce without it.  Next time I plan to foil at the end, as the ribs got a little dry. I cooked them at 225 in my gas smoker for 6 1/2 hours. They could have used a little longer to make them "Fall of the bone" tender, but I liked them just the same. :)  I would make these again!

Absolutely magnificent. I made it just as listed, and it came out fantastic for my dinner party. Love the spice in the mop sauce! 
I served it with roasted potatoes and veggies, a tossed green salad with peaches, and paired it with a california zinfandel. 
Was a hit, and no leftovers, all gobbled up!

this rub turned out pretty tasty.. i cut the recipe in half to use on a 4 lb rack but i only used about half the rub.. i subbed table salt for the kosher and didn't use the jalapeno seasoning salt (never heard of it, but it sounds interesting).. like most other reviewers i didn't use the mop sauce and didn't feel like the ribs were lacking anything.. the wood chips were a must for us.. ty for the recipe

This is my GO TO recipe for ribs. Hubby loves it and we have not had a complaint yet from any guests. I have to agree with most of the reviewers that the mop sauce is not needed and I've actually never made it! The meat comes out falling off the ribs, moist and flavorful. Made this 3 times so far-- we did add honey and liquid smoke last time it was awesome.

Used this rub recipe on spare ribs.  Recipe is excellent.   We didn't even need a sauce for these ribs.   Put them in my smoker at 225 degrees for about 6 hours.   Turned out incredible.

These were awesome.  I like my smoked ribs without sauce so didn't use it. I also didn't use the jalapeno salt. The less salt the better. The combination of sweet and hot was perfect.

I used this recipe for the July 4th gathering yesterday and everyone loved it!  I did not use the mop sauce.  I let the ribs marinate in the fridge for 3 hours and then baked in oven for 1 an hour and 30 minutes and finished off on the grill for 30 min.  The ribs were very tender and had great flavor without any bbq sauce.  I highly recommended.  Thank you Tanlor!

This is the first time I've ever tried anything like this. All I can say is wow! I didn't use as much hot sauce as it calls for. A little less than half. And I substituted apple sauce for the apple cider. Use what's available right. But they turned out spectacular!! Nice and sweet with a little bite. I'm smoking a whole hog this summer and I'm defiantly using this recipe!

Only reviewing the rub - didn't make the mop sauce, but the rub was awesome - probably could be used on any slow cooked meat or chicken.

This is an amazing recipe.  I have made it many times. The only thing I changed is I made more rub and I don’t have the jalapeño salt.  I kept the proportions the same.  I have used this in pork and wait for it.......  WILD TURKEY!!!!  Came out amazing on the turkey breast.  The legs, not so much.  I have made this for gatherings and I always get asked for the recipe by someone. Thanks for the share!

My first attempt at bbq pork spare ribs. Total success with this recipe. I was unable to locate the jalapeño season salt in time to bbq, so I left that and the single jalapeño pepper out of the recipe - and good thing too cause the remaining flavor kicks butt. I’d call these the “hot wings” equivalent to bbq ribs... SMOKE’IN

I use this as a guide. I riff quite a bit with recipes. Instead of mopping with it I put a version of the mop sauce in the pouch when it was time to wrap. The ribs came out exceptional.

I followed the recipe and added a little bit of time  in the oven, as the first time I made it the meat was not fall off the bone. Barbecue sauce excellent. My daughter-in-law told me everything was great except she felt I grilled too much and she did not like the char On the ribs. Personally I like the char  and I really like this recipe.

After 3 hours I wrapped it with aluminium foil spread with half a cup of brown sugar, good squeeze of American mustard and maple syrup. Continued cooking for another hour and a half. This  gave it extra flavour and a great bark .

this sounds delicious, however, I have made a decision that unless those who send in the recipes clarify that the paprika is either regular ( sweet) paprika or SMOKED paprika, I will not make it.  There is a VAST difference in the two paprikas and its ridiculous the way no one is putting which one except chefs.

Must be careful about the amount of salt in the rub. Supermarket ribs are injected with a saline solution, so too much salt is a hazard.

This was okay but I wouldn't waste my time or ingredients on it again.

Some of our family members liked them, some did not.  Went by the recipe, but wish we would have boiled the ribs first to render some of the fat.  Personally I thought it was an unusual taste.

Made this to the recipe except I had to use apple juice instead of cider. After smoking for 2 hours the internal temp was creeping up on 160* so I laid the ribs meat side down in a tinfoil pan with apple juice for 1 1/2 hours. Then I mopped them and let sit on the smoker/grill for another half hour. The ribs were AMAZING!

I have been making pretty much the same thing for some time now using just the brown sugar, ground black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground cumin. And with seasoned salt. The other ingredients I never thought of trying, But I am going to now! One very important step,(That I think) you don't do is soak them in a brine over Night. I always soak mine in apple cider. then use the apple cider instead of water in the smoker

Entire family went crazy over these ribs!  Used a plain grill- no wood chips.

We actually loved these, but I'm rating 4 stars cause we didn't use mop sauce, we used favorite BBQ sauce. The rub was very good. I cut down on cinnamon and cumin, and omitted cayenne.

I only used the dry rub recipe and it was very tasty. Everyone liked it, will use the dry rub again.

this rub is excellent! I use it with a little different cooking method, but the rub is the best you will find!

These were delicious!  It was a little on the spicy side. Next time I will cut back on some of the spicy spices that way my little ones will eat it better.  I did think they were extremely tasty. I used Sonny's sweet bbq sauce.

Great way to cook ribs. We didn't have the time to do the long cooking so just bbq'd our normal length of time (about 45 minutes) and the ribs still came out tender and tasty!  6/09 Just finished with going the smoker route and they were absolutely fantastic!!!!!
