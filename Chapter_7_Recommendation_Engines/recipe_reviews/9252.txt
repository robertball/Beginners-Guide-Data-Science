We LOVED this!  I cooked this in the crock pot for 8 hours and didn't marinate is at all.  I only used 1/2 c. of sugar instead of 3/4 c.  I used 5 fresh squeezed limes.  I think it could have used a little more soy sauce.  After it cooked all day, I boiled rice and made gravy out of the sauce that it had been cooking in all day.  It was wonderful.  Everyone loved it!

Terrific marinade - add a few drops of red food coloring and it will remind you of Barbequed Pork from your favorite Chinese Resturaunt.

I made sure to marinate the pork for at least 24 hours and my family said that this was the best pork they had ever eaten!!!

I alway thought that I hated, loathed, dispised, pork roast.  My husband bought one and I grudgingly prepared it using this recipe.  I had planned to just eat side dishes for dinner.   After making a scene like a little child,  I reluctantly tried a bite and to my surprise, I LOVED it!  So tender and flavorful.    Thanks so much for the recipe!  Next time I will cut the sugar in half but it was still fantastic the way it is.

Not a fan of pork but I've been trying pork recipes and this is a good one! I did omit the salt because I felt with the soy sauce, it might have been too much for me.  I will be making this again.

This is one of the very best roast pork dishes I've ever made!  It was a total hit!  

Instead of a pork roast, I used wild hog (a small sow that my husband shot).  This receipe managed to eliminate all of the 'gamey-ness' normally associated with wild game.

I only had one small little lime, so I used both the zest and juice of a lime, a lemon and an orange.  I marinated it for 24 hours then cooked it in the marinade juices in pressure cooker.  

Magnificent!

Delicious! This was a hit with the entire family.  I doubled the sauce and made gravy out of it like many others on this site.  Very juicy and flavorful.  It made the entire house smell great and everyone was anxious to try it. It did require planning ahead, but it was worth it. Next time I will try the crock pot ideaa someone posted to make it even easier.

This was just way too salty. I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the additional salt. Still all I could taste was the salty soy sauce. If I make this again, I will use 1/4 C soy sauce and 1/2 C chicken broth.

This was amazing! The best pork roast ever. We used some leftovers to make Cuban sandwiches. This has been moved into frequent rotation.

Made this, this evening.  I accidentally grabbed the bottle of Teriyaki  sauce, realized after i started pouring in to  make the marinade so is used about 1/2 cup Teriyaki and 1/2 cup soy.  What a great mistake.  It turned out wonderful.  It sweetened the marinade just a little that way and gave the finished pork a little bit of a tangy flavor.

Quite good! I made it in a pressure cooker with no marinating time, and the flavor is very nice. I used Teriyaki sauce and no sugar. The kids LOVED it!

I marinated mine for over 24 hours, which gave it great flavor and roasted at 400 for about an hour to speed up the cooking time.

FANTASTIC…the family told me it wasn’t good, it was GREAT!!! The only change I made was to use thyme instead of rubbed sage (because I didn’t have any on hand). Marinated the pork overnight, and the fridge smelled wonderful when I opened the door. I let the meat sit and come somewhat to room temp (maybe 20 minutes) then popped it into the oven with a lid on for about an hour, took it out, turned the meat, basted and loosely put foil on! 4 hours later we had a delicious, moist roast that the kids and fiancé took seconds of! I also read over prior reviews and used a ¼ cup for soy sauce, but made each of the three ¼ cups short and used the regular amount of salt. I paired this with the boston baked beans recipe (submitted by AJRHODES3) … both are delicious and both cook at 325! Definitely recommend this pork roast recipe!!!

I didn't change anything, except I put it in the smoker with an applewood smoke.  8 hrs in there and it just fell apart!  Serve it up with a spinach salad with raspberry/apple dressing, and roasted new potatoes...whoops just drooled on myself!

This was great! I did not marinate it, but put all ingredients in my electric pressure cooker for 90 min. We used the shedded pork for Chipotle style burrito bowls. YUM!

Deliciously different. Marinated overnight, didn't have lime juice so I used 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 fruit punch juice, but I'll cook this again with limes and see if there is much difference. Cooking time for a 5 lb. pork roast was considerably less than the recipe (about 2.5 hours at 325 convection). Strained and simmered the pan juices and drizzled over top of slices. A nice tasty change from the usual pork roast for sure!

We give it 4.5 stars.  The Caribbean flair was a nice change, I would make this one again.  Made the drippings into gravy which was placed on top of the slices of pork on each plate.

I did not care for this recipe. Far too much soy. Too salty. Too strong of an Asian influence. I had lots of lime (3 whole limes) but could not taste their fun tang. I chose the recipe because of all the great reviews.  Wish I had not!

Wow. Totally 5 stars. I used low sodium soy sauce and a little less sugar because I was low and powdered ginger. Everyone inhaled this.

I cooked it fill time and added all ingredients listed. I did not find this to be that great but at the same time it was not horrible either. Parts of the roast where dry, and over all I’d just not make it ever again.

This was an awesome recipe. Made it in the crockpot and let it cook all day. Removed the meat and thickened sauce with cornstarch and water. Added shredded meat back in and served over rice. Family LOVED it! Definitely will be making again

Beautiful! Tasty! I braised it on the charcoal grill before roasting and I left it on warm for an additional couple hrs after roasting. Plus substituted honey for sugar. It was melting off the bone!

I VERY rarely review a recipe, but I just had to on this one.  This was the BEST pork roast I have ever made.  As another reviewer suggested, I cooked in crock pot, so only marinated for about 2 hours while the roast finished defrosting.  The flavor and tenderness was amazing.  With the Asian flavors from the marinade, I felt it could benefit from an Asian style barbecue sauce, so I made the one from Sweet and Spicy Asian Style BBQ Back Ribs on this site and it was AMAZING.  The perfect complement.  Served with steamed rice and the sauce from cooking the pork was just perfect to flavor the rice.

I skipped the sugar and lime juice substituted organic lemonade. I made the marinade overnight and wished i would have put the roast in with the marinade overnight.
Overall it was delicious . Pork was so tender and tasty.

I made this in the crock pot because it was too hot to use the oven.  So needless to say, I didn't marinate it.  The pork turned out so good and it fell apart as I cut it, which was a good sign that it was really moist.  My husband and my oldest really liked it on rice.  I would definitely make this again!

I prepared this for a Christmas party gathering. What a hit!
I made 2 6-lb roasts and there was 1/2 a roast left after serving 12 people. Prep notes: I doubled the recipe since I fixed 2 roasts. I used low-sodium soy sauce, reduced the amount of sugar by half - and increased the garlic.  I will definitely be making this again.
