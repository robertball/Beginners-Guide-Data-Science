I am always in search of a good recipe for Chinese food, but this one is disappointing.  It totally lacks flavor, and the proportions aren't right.  It needs less chicken, less oil, and more vegetables and seasonings.  The fried almonds were okay, but I think some other nut (like cashews) would have provided more flavor.  I won't be making this again; it needs more than just a few alterations.

I think this is a great recipe! We get so used to the artificial, additive/preservative-laden junk served in restaurants that we forget what real, fresh food tastes like! The second time I made it, I did cut down on the chicken a bit, used less oil as well as a healthier oil and added some broccoli, carrots, garlic and more onion--delicious!

I was very disappointed in this receipe. The only change I made was no sherry because I did not have any. I used chicken broth. The receipe says to  also use the soya sauce at the end, yet there is no other soya except that which was used in the marinade and I would not use that. The indgrideants tasted good but it had no flavour as there are no herbs or spices. I will try to doctor it and make it again.

I was craving Almond Chicken and had all the ingredients. I have had such good luck with allrecipes recipes that I picked it first out of the googled list. YUM! My only change will be to cut back on the salt.

I LOVE this recipe!! It is simple and tasty. I didn't have enough peanut oil so I combined vegetable oil with peanut oil, but that didn't matter. My dad is my biggest culinary critic, and he said it was great! Better than our local Chinese restaurant. Used the liquid from bean sprouts instead of chicken broth. Good for Tofu, too!

we tweaked the recipe and only made the meat/sauce combo.  we really liked it.  we used it like a sweet and sour chicken, and I made a sweet and sour sauce to go with it.  I also used the almonds.  i will make it again, and i look forward to trying it with all the vegetables.
