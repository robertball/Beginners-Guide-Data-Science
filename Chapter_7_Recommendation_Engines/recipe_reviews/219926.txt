Made them last weekend and was not impressed. I have found better receipts for smokies. My husband thought they had to much of the bourbon flavor for a smoky.

I made these today as part of an assortment of appetizers to eat during the Steelers vs. Browns game. I used Jim Beam and spicy ketchup. The guys ate all of them, but my husband said they were just OK and he wouldn't particularly care for them again.

I was planning on making these for our office holiday potluck and had never made this specific recipe before so I tried out a half batch the weekend before and my husband and I both noted that it needed more bourbon and that it did make a lot of sauce compared to the amount of smokies.  I made a larger (2.5x) batch for work and added in a lot more bourbon, almost triple, which was, needless to say a bit much.  Sending the hubby out for more ketchup to mellow the sauce out a bit I finally came to a good ratio and everyone at work loved them.  Unfortunately I don't have an exact amount for the bourbon I used but it was at least twice as much.  Because of my experimenting I was left with a bunch of sauce that we froze and plan to use later for more smokies and salmon.

My family has been making these for at least 45 years! Sometimes I add some hot sauce for a little flavor kick. :)

Excellent! Next time we will reduce the brown sugar and add pepper flakes. But the Bourbon flavor is excellent!
