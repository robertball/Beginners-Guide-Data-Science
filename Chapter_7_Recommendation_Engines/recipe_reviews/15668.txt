WARNING:

This doesn't make popcorn balls... it makes CARAMEL CORN. It's yummy, but I tried to shape it into balls and it just didn't work. It's very crunchy, and not gooey/sticky like I wanted. If you like caramel corn, try this recipe, but if you're wanting popcorn balls, look elsewhere.

For those like me without a candy thermometer-boil the 'sauce' at bubbling & stir for several minutes, until a drop in a cup of cold water makes a gooey ball, then it's ready to drizzle on the popcorn and they will hold together when packed by hand (after cooling a bit). I used just 1 cup corn, but 1 1/2 c sugar and 1 1/2 c molasses, and got a yummy batch of 22 (24 if I hadn't eaten some on the way to the wax paper!).

Great recipe for the holidays. Next time I may make it with unsalted microwave popcorn to shorten the process. I added salted peanuts which gave them a great flavor! The kids loved them!

Was looking for recipe for carmel corn to use up the left over popped corn - used this recipe because I don't use corn syrup at all - had about 6 cups leftover popped corn (organic, already seasoned with coconut oil/butter/salt mixture) - Mixed 1/2 TBLS butter with 1/2 cup of raw organic cane sugar and 1/2 cup unsulphured molasses, no salt.  Brought to boil, and since I don't have candy thermometer, dropped drops of mixture into cold water until hard, pliable (but not sticky!) ball formed - poured over corn, mixed and layed out on wax paper to dry - YUMMY!

They tasted very good but next time I'll use half the popcorn or double the syrup that goes on it.  The problem may have been that I used a hot air popper instead of popping it on the stove.  I ended up with more popcorn than syrup to hold it all together.

This was okay.  I halved the recipe (because I only had 1 C of molasses).  Like other reviewers stated, there wasn't enough sauce for all of the popcorn.  It only covered about half of it.  The flavor was pretty good... not exciting though.  Oh, and there was no way I could turn the bowl of popcorn into balls... there just wasn't enough sauce to make them stick together.

made carmel corn not pop corn balls, I agree with the other womans review who said the same thing. It was good but next time I Am going to only use 1 cup of popcorn instead of 2. I also used the colored sugar to make it colored and it worked really well but it absolutely makes carmel corn not popcorn balls!

I just tried this. I used 1 C un-popped corn in air popper( I had 2 cups popped corn left over.)For the syrup,Iused 1 C un-sulphered black strap molasses and 1 tbs. water, 1 C sugar and 1Tbs.butter I Cooked until it formed a firm. but pliable ball in cold water. Grease hands before forming into balls. It made 50 mini balls. If you like Cracker Jacks, you will love this recipe. Add peanuts for the complete taste of Cracker Jacks.

I use this recipe and add 1 envelope of koolaid or jello to the syrup before making into balls. Family likes Black cheery koolaid or strawberry jello powder. The taste is awesome. Try your favorite flavor of either and enjoy!

Popped 2/3 cup corn instead of the 2 cups and doubled the butter.  Also added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to keep from crystalizing.  Texture was good and balls were easy to shape, but my problem with this recipe is just way too much molasses for my liking.  the molasses flavour was overpowering.

Made them just as the recipe calls for and got delicious popcorn balls! This is going to be a new favorite at home! I might try adding some peanuts next time.

Made it with 3 bags of microwave popcorn.  I also only heated it to 238 degrees F.  This made them stick together better and have the not so hard to break your teeth.  But the are great!! Just like Grandma's.

Ok, the one thing that i noticed that this recipe did not have was any water. I used 3 quarts of popcorn 2/3 cup Sorghum (molasses), 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup WATER, 1/3 tsp salt, 1/3 tsp vinegar, 2tbs butter and 2 tsp vanilla.
