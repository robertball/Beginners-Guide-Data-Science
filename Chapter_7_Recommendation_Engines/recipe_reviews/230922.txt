I thought it was a really good basic recipe but made some adjustments that really boosted the flavor. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of regular ones. Also instead of the cream, I used 1 cup of roasted garlic parmesen sauce. Really made a huge difference! great mix of spicy and creamy.

Tried the recipe and was so disappointed. Nothing to jump to the ceiling really, will not do again! :-(
