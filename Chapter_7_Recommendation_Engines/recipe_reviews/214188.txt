This recipe was fantastic! So easy too.  I marinated chicken for a few hours in a citrus, onion, mustard seed marinade and used bacon instead of prosciutto.  I'm no chef but this recipe sure made me seem like one.  Delicious. Thanks for posting.

Great idea and sooooo simple!  I also used bacon instead of the prosciutto, and it was in the oven for about 35 minutes, but everyone loved it.

This was phenomenal!  I didn't have prosciutto, but can't wait to try it that way, too!  I always season my chicken with kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder before I make it, but the pesto was so flavorful that I probably could've skipped that step.  I served the chicken over pasta tossed with pesto.  Easy enough for the family (my 4 year old loved it) but impressive looking enough for company.

To add more flavor, I pounded the chicken out and made a filling of feta, roasted red peppers, garlic, pepper and finely chopped mushrooms. I coated the inside with pesto first, then filled it and covered the tops with salt, pepper, pesto and then the prosciutto. AWESOME!!! 
ADDING: After making this several times, I don't care for the texture of the Prosciutto after cooking. Now, I coat the outside of the chicken w/Pesto, S & P. Then on the inside, I do Pesto, S & P, Prosciutto, then the filling. Fold and cook. PERFECTION!!!

I never really cook and yet this turned out great! It was easy, and very delicious. For the pesto sauce I used the recipe for "15-year-old pesto sauce" and it worked out really well!  I served this with brown rice and asparagus and it tasted wonderfully  together.

We really enjoyed this! I made this with a slight variation: A reviewer mentioned that she didn't like the texture of the prosciutto cooking on the outside so I decided to cook it on the inside.  I pounded the chicken breasts even, dusted them with garlic powder and a bit of freshly ground pepper. I spread just one tablespoon of pesto on each breast [I love pesto but didn't want it to overwhelm the dish], a slice of prosciutto and then 2 thin slices of  smoked gouda per breast to cover the prosciutto. I rolled it up and secured it with a toothpick and put it in a greased glass baking dish in the fridge, until I was ready to bake it, which I did later at 350 for 25 minutes.  I was afraid the cheese would all melt out but the gouda held it's shape. The flavors went together wonderfully.

I would encourage lovers of this recipe to try it with the prosciutto and pesto inside.

My husband said this was fantastic!  I made pesto with fresh basil from my garden.  I wasn't sure how to prepare the chicken, so I tried it two ways.  First I pounded the chicken, then spread the pesto on the breast, then rolled the chicken and wrapped the bacon around it (picture added).  The smaller pieces that I cut off the breasts, I also pounded, spread the pesto on, but the wrapped the bacon around the chicken as it lay flat with the pesto side up (picture added, but you can't see the chicken under the pesto).  Since the chicken was not as thick on the smaller pieces, my husband said they were more flavorful.  They cooked in 25 minutes as well.  The full breasts took closer to 45 minutes.

I made this Pesto Chicken for myself (even though it is portioned for four) and it was great right out of the oven and it was also good as leftovers. I'll make it again for sure.

This was pretty good and very easy to make. The quality of the pesto will determine how good your dish is, so home made will likely be the best. Thanks for a quick weeknight meal idea!

This recipe was so incredibly easy and yummy. I'm not as comfortable in the kitchen as some, so instructions like "bake uncovered" are necessary for me :) Instead of pasta I made Parmesan couscous and used the leftover prosciutto to wrap and bake some asparagus.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This was very easy!  Used 2T Costco pesto over chicken breasts, sprinkled with bacon, and baked for 30 min.  Made penne pasts and mixed with pesto, quartered cherry tomatoes, and sprinkled with feta cheese.  Very good and easy.

Very good dish and so easy to prepare, the only thing I did differently was to stuff the chicken with a finger sized piece of fontina cheese, we love cheese and since I was wrapping the chicken with prosciutto I would let it do double duty in holding the melted cheese in. If you stuff it you must reduce your baking time by a few minutes and if you have a Viking stove with more BTUs than the average stove be sure to drop your heat to 375.  This dish was tender and flavorable. Thanks "Pjaros" for submitting it.

Made my own pesto from AR and followed recipe as stated.  Had to cook my chicken about 10 minutes longer because they were humongo.  But other that than, very good.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe Pjaros!

Very moist and flavorful. I used 1/4 of the Pesto recipe also found on this site (3/4 cup packed basil leaves, 1 clove garlic, 3 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, 1 Tbsp pine nuts, 2 Tbsp olive oil. I had to add more olive oil to get pesto consistency but the oil comes out during baking and it bastes the chicken so it was all good)

I needed a recipe using chicken and pesto but NOT pasta (we're gluten-free around here). I used 2 frozen chicken tenders (the strip of meat off the breastbone, NOT the battered breaded stuff!), some pesto I'd made with basil from DH's garden, and thin-sliced Butterball turkey ham (I didn't have prosciutto). Spread the pesto on the frozen chicken, wrapped each in 2 overlapping slices of the ham, placed in an olive-oiled casserole dish, baked uncovered at 350' for 25 minutes. The ham was a bit tough (that's what you get when you go fat-free) but the flavor was good, and DH loved it with "his" pesto. Less salty than using prosciutto, but I think I'd like the flavor of the prosciutto better.  Next time, I'll use the real thing, or did I hear someone mention bacon? Thanks for the inspiration!

DELICIOUS & SIMPLE!!! Another recipe that looks (and tastes) gourmet but is so easy! We did add cheese to our chicken by cutting a piece of string cheese into halves/quarters and rolling the flattened chicken breast around it! WOW!! Will make again & again!

Must rub pesto into chicken! Lacking the prosciutto & only having boneless skinless chicken tenders, I wrapped & substituted solely ham slices w/some tender strips & solely hard salami slices for the rest; I liked ham better. Can't wait to try this w/prosciutto, thank you for sharing this fairly quick, easy recipe! 5 stars w/pesto rub & 1 slice of provolone cheese (many white Italian cheese would go well with this dish)!

This was just ok for me. Hubby liked it more than I did. It was a good start - but next time I make it I'll definitely be doing some tweaking. Fast and easy - just lacking something...

Great on the (slow) BBQ too! Add garlic to the pesto for extra zing! Suggestion: serve with creamy  mushroom pasta, green salad and garlic french bread

My family gave this rave reviews, 'make again anytime you want'! I sliced each breast to make thinner and smaller portions & used bacon which I just curled on top so it would brown. Cooked for 35 minutes and served with a side of vegetable fettucini.  We usually grill chicken strips and just top with fresh pesto, this version was more convenient as we were having an ice storm. Was a little concerned as we usually don't cook pesto, but it was delicious!

This was pretty good. The combination of pesto and prosciutto was a little too salty for me though.

Wonderful recipe!! You should pound the chicken breast. It makes it easy to roll, cooks evenly in 25 minutes and is a good recipe for company. I placed the prosciutto down then I put the chicken breast with the breast side side to the prosciutto then I spread my pesto. Then roll it up...looks great and tastes great too! Enjoy...I will make this again.

I made this exactly as per the recipe. I'm not sure what made this "too salty" for some other people, because we thought it was fantastic! Only three ingredients and it worked really well together. Two slices of prosciutto per breast was needed, and my SO suggested pounding the breasts flat next time. Fast, easy, and delicious? I will definitely be adding this to the rotation!

How elegant!  Such simple ingredients!   My guests were so impressed, they did not know how simple this was!  It is a keeper for us, and I will repeat.  Try using chicken tenders, this cuts down the cooking time and keeps everything very moist and tasty.

I have made this chicken in few occasions and always get the same compliments.  My husband liked it and he is not a huge chicken fan.  I will make this again tonight for my husband's b-day surprise party! I did one change, I used bacon instead. I love this recipe.

VERY GOOD.I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN, BUT I WILL TRY PUTING THE CHICKEN ON A RACK, INSTEAD OF FLAT DOWN IN A GREASED BAKING DISH, HOPEFULLY THE BOTTOM WILL BROWN ALSO. TURNING THE CHICKEN OVER WHILE COOKING WILL RUIN THE LOOK OF THE PESTO ON TOP.

Very Good! I used bacon instead of prosciutto but would definitely use the prosciutto next time.  The bacon didn't quite get crispy enough - ended up taking it off but the chicken tasted delicious!

Amazing!.  After wrapping with prosciutto I coated mine with a layer of mozzarella, tomato slices, basil leaves and re-wrapped with prosciutto.  I make my own pesto sauce and the flavor of the chicken is dependant on using a good pesto as well as good prosciutto since the salt from the prosciutto gives it flavor.

No.........don't think so. Seemed to be a neat idea for a unique dish...but...found the chicken to be a little dry and the pesto didn't do much to bring that basil flavour to the breast. The proscuitto just got hard during the cooking process - 25 min. Feedback from my 17 yr old son a day later - HE LOVED IT!! WANTS MORE ASAP!! Got great comments when girlfriend used it sliced up in a salad - changing from a '3*' to a '4*'.

What an awesome recipe! I gave it 4 stars because I did make some changes. I put some crumbled fear cheese on the pesto before wrapping the chicken with bacon, and I had to cook it for 40 minutes before the inside temp was 165 degrees.

I placed the pesto over the prosciutto and just seasoned with salt and pepper. Took maybe two minutes of prep time and it was amazing.

Quick and easy dinner. Yummy. I used bacon instead of prosciutto and put it on the top rack so it would crisp the bacon a bit, which caused a shell of sorts that trapped in heat and moisture. :) I think this would also be yummy with a nice meltable cheese inside.

Honestly the simplest recipe I have ever made! And SO delicious! I did use prosciutto. The only thing I would change is adding some broth to the baking dish before cooking because mine smoked a lot. But I didn't set the alarm off so all is go

I made pesto with basil from my garden and used that on top of the chicken.  Wrapped it with bacon instead of prosciutto (since it's what I had at the time).  Very flavorful!  I think that I might try a thinner cut bacon, or the prosciutto, next time and cook for a little less time to keep the chicken more tender.  Even my picky kids ate it!

I was not sure as I really like to see what the outcome looks like; and w/out a picture took the chance.  This was fabulous!  I cooked it a little longer than I should have; I used fresh basil from the garden... Kids and all loved it!  Strong recommend trying!

Definitely will make this again.  I flattened each chicken breast and rolled each one into a spiral with the prosciutto wrapped into the spiral.  I used a skewer stick to hold together and allowed it to sit overnight before cooking.  Definitely one of my favorite recipes because of its simplicity and taste.

Oh my goodness this was SO GOOD!  I made the pesto from scratch the day before and had my husband assemble the chicken breasts, pesto and proscuitto and put everything in the oven before I got home from work.  He was very proud of himself for having "cooked" something so elegant-looking and tasty!  We will definitely be making this again, perhaps even for company!  We served this with roasted garlic cauliflower, another awesome recipe from this site.

Excellent recipe with the addition of the provolone cheese someone else mentioned.  I did divide the breast and found one tablespoon of pesto sufficient.  Easy and quick preparation too.

Fantastic recipe and so easy.  My husband loved it.  I did not have any basil pesto, so substituted sun dried tomato pesto and it was delicious.  Next time I may score the top of the breast and insert some of the pesto in side the chicken.  I added a side of orzo, cooked in chicken broth and flavored with a fine herb blend.  Definitely a "keeper".

This is delicious!  Made it exactly as instructed, but pounded out the chicken first. I served with a pasta that had sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, black olives, zucchini, and yellow squash mixed with olive oil.  It was a major hit with the family - no leftovers!

4.5 Stars:  This is very easy and quite tasty once you mix some of the pesto with the side pasta.  We loved how the prosciutto was crispy, although we did bake it for closer to 45 minutes.

This recipe is awesome. You can use bacon if you don't have prosciutto, but prosciutto is better. I serve this for guests and they love it. A winner and soooo easy. (I use Wegman's prepared pesto which is also awesome. And do not admit that to guests!))

I didn't have prosciutto on hand, so I used sliced deli ham instead.  It was very good.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  Ham was kind of rubbery the next day when eating the leftovers, though.

I used bacon because that's what I had in the house. It definitely kept the chicken nice and moist. I was really pleased with how moist the chicken came out being boneless and skinless. Salty, but full of flavor! I sliced up the breasts and put them in a big salad.  The crispy bacon and chicken really made our salad a yummy & flavorful meal.

Very good. However, I think it might be better with a thin cut of chicken. I basted proscuitto with some pesto to keep it from drying out.

I am the poster of this recipe, so I am giving it 4 stars :).  Michelle, it is 4 individual chicken breasts, I am not sure how many ounces that would be (probably about 1 1b for all 4 breasts). If they are very large, I would suggest splitting them in half, or adjusting the cooking time; you want the chicken to cook through and the prosciutto to get crispy, but not burnt.  The quality of the pesto you use makes a big difference.  To those who liked it. I am glad that you are enjoying it! :)

I thought this tasted great, but my picky boyfriend wasn't too thrilled (I think he's just so-so about pesto in general).  The prep was super easy, and the house smelled wonderful while this was baking.

This was an extremely easy recipe with very few ingredients, and it looked professional and delicious on the dinner table. I did find it a bit salty (just the nature of the ingredients) but I assume if you serve it with a grain like rice or bread, it evens everything out. I served it with some steamed veggies, and it made a great, simple, quick dinner for my boyfriend and I.

This was by far the easiest, most delicious meal I think I've ever cooked.  I bought prego basil pesto smeared it all over the chicken and wrapped bacon around it. Threw it in the oven for 30 minutes and oh my gosh the tenderness and amount of flavor was amazing.  It took 3 minutes to prepare and looked like something out of a magazine. Super easy, but looks like you put major effort into it.  Will most certainly be making this many more times!

As easy as one, two, three.  I prepared ahead of time and popped it into the oven 30 minutes before the guests arrived.  Served it with kale salad and fettuccini (rose sauce).  Fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this several times - as written and "tweaked" - and it turns out excellent every time!  I make my own pesto and freeze it in ice cube trays - makes for a CRAZY easy dinner! My new favorite way to make this is after I have pounded out the breasts and rolled them up with the pesto inside, I dip them in an egg wash then roll in Italian Bread Crumbs.  SOOOO very good! Oh, and the leftovers (if there IS any) get cut up and thrown into a salad the next day.....SINFULLY DELICIOUS!  :)

I only subbed the prosciutto for thin sliced bacon (my local grocery store doesn't have a notable deli) and I used a store bought Pesto that contained romano cheese and basil. This was awesome! My fiancee demanded that I make this at least once a week! I may try and stuff the chicken with pesto or ham or cheese just to add a little more complexity to a brilliantly simple and tasty dish!

For only being 3 ingredients and so easy to prepare, I thought this was delicious.  Everyone was happy with it.  Doing it again I would be sure to buy more prosciutto to ensure the entire breast is completely wrapped.  Four thin slices is no where near enough if you are wrapping 4 medium sized chicken breasts.  Luckily the guy in the deli asked me what I was doing and made sure I had enough.

Yummy and very easy. I used homemade pesto and turkey bacon. I also secured it all with toothpicks. I might try rotating the chicken partway through to get all of the bacon crispy.

This was delicious and so easy!  Definitely a keeper.  Everyone in the family enjoyed it, which does not happen often enough! The only thing I changed was to reduce the cooking temp to 350 and then I cooked a few minutes longer.  I store my homemade basil in the freezer in ice cube trays and I used a hefty half ice cube size of pesto on each breast.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's tough to find a recipe that the whole family loves.  Hubby liked the contrast in flavors.  The kids asked for the leftovers in their lunches tomorrow.  Even my very picky son, who thinks anything green is kryptonite, said it was delicious.  

The only change I made was marinating the chicken in balsamic vinegar and olive oil while it was defrosting.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was AMAZING!  It looks and tastes like something you could order in a fine Italian restaurant.  I did not use 2 tablespoons of pesto per breast as that seemd excessive.  I used 1 heaping teaspoon of pesto per breast and the family thought it was perfect!  This is a great company dish.  I gave it five stars for ease of preparation and taste!  Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe.

Good way to prepare, and really easy, but the flavors didn't come together all that well.  Too much pesto overpowered the initial taste, and didn't really take to the meat. The prosciutto is a nice addition.  If made again, I would probably reduce the pesto and perhaps add some spices to balance it out a bit better.

Amazingly simply to make and full of flavor.....great fast recipe for a week night. I cut the cutlets in half first and then pounded them before using a jar pesto, which was great and easy.

I made this last night and it was excellent!  I followed another readers advise and roasted red peppers, onions, and garlic.  I pounded out the chicken and marinated it for two hours.  I then placed the proscuttio inside the chicken with feta cheese and the roasted peppers.  I tied it up and put 2 tablespoons on the top of each chicken roll.  I served it with Angel Hair Pasta.  Everyone loved it, Thanks for sharing!

Reviews are  to let others know how you liked a dish or not. To give a recipe 1 star because the picture is not to your liking and without even trying it is just plain rude. Delicious and thank you for sharing.

Made this 6-30-12 and we really enjoyed it!  I followed the directions exactly except used one rounded tablespoon of pesto rather than 2T on each piece of chicken.  No need to change anything.

My husband decided that he was going to make this the first meal he EVER cooked.  Well, it was great! Simple enough for someone with NO cooking skills to do, and do it well.  It was just great. So tasty, too. I think it all depends on the pesto you use.  That will make or break it, so be sure to either make your own, or get a good quality one.

was good but could be a little better. I don't think the pesto I bought was a great one. Will try again with better quality pesto or make my own.

I was worried this would be bland (without adding any spices), but the pesto and the bacon (or proscuitto) come together fantastically!

I did not have proscuiutto, so used bacon.  I can only imagine how much better it would be.   I used organic chicken breasts which were large.  So I cut the half breast in two so they weren't so thick.  Everyone at the table enjoyed this from kids to adults.   The chicken was tender and juicy. It was good tasting and easy and that gets and pleased everyone?   5 stars for sure.

This was SO easy and delicious! I used chicken cutlets which made it easy to roll and served over pasta with some pesto, garlic and parmesan mixed in. My two boys, (14) and (8) loved it and have asked for it again tonight!

I used bacon instead of prosciutto.  Turned out pretty good.  The chicken breasts were pretty thick, next time I might flatten them out or butterfly them.

My boys LOVED this! I marinated chicken breasts first thanks to another reviewer’s suggestion. Used Paul Newman’s Italian dressing.Then I made a sauce from the marinade: melted 2 T. butter in one heaping spoonful of flour. Mixed over low heat until smooth. Added marinade that I used to soak the chicken, then about a half cup chicken broth. Simmered 5 min. then added about 1/4 cup half and half after turning off heat.It was DELICIOUS!

Easy to make for newbies in the kitchen, taste was good and enjoyable. Will make again. Added garlic powder to chicken for personal preference for all things garlic. Sided with arugula salad with balsamic vinaigrette.

Pound chicken and Marinated  ahead of time . I used bacon to wrap then used a rack to lift chicken in pan because bacon made fat drippings.

Delicious! So much easier than stuffing the breast. Didn’t have quite enough Pesto so I mixed  with Neufchâtel cheese to make enough. It was still flavorful enough. We had different sized breasts so we cut the small in half and  the large in thirds so they were all the same size. Served on top of a bed of fettuccine tossed with a little leftover garlic butter I had frozen and some parsley flakes.

I liked it. I used the advice of another reviewer and put the ham on the inside of the rolled chicken.  I also included some sautéed mushrooms.  I brushed the chicken with egg and sprinkled with bread crumbs to ensure it browned.  I served it with pasta also tossed in pesto - it was quite good.

As is, it is good and easy to execute. I took the suggestion of a reviewer and spread the pesto inside the chicken, add feta and roasted red peppers. I used Cento’s chef cut Roasted Peppers from a jar. I spread the pesto on the outside and used two slices of the prosciutto on each piece of chicken, finish with a few shakes of black pepper. No additional salt needed anywhere as the prosciutto is salty enough. I would advise to wrap the prosciutto along the width of the chicken so that it “seals” the cut. Use gentle hands as the prosciutto tears easily. A reviewer mentioned bacon. While this isn’t a bad choice, I beg that you try the prosciutto first. I found that the thin slice really brings an element of class to it and a different taste from the same bacon and chicken recipes. Thanks for a recipe that could be easily dressed up or down and that makes a beginning look like a novice.

Delicious and easy! I flattened out the chicken a bit before rolling it up. Also had to cover the dish after about 20 minutes because the prosciutto was crispy but the chicken wasn't quite done. My family loved it!

Unlike some recipes, the simplicity of this did not work in its favor.  There was nothing particularly wrong with it, but it just felt like the ingredients were somewhat randomly placed together.  Didn't produce a cohesive flavor profile.

This recipe was ridiculously easy and soooo tasty. However, I used a smaller baking dish and I ended up having to drain it a couple of times. Also, I did sub the prosciutto with bacon which was good but next time I'll stick with the prosciutto to see if it's any better.

We really liked this... I browned the chicken rolls slightly on the stovetop first before baking to ensure that the prosciutto was crisp, and served it over some penne tossed with olive oil, fresh basil, and fresh grated Parmesan cheese - delish!

Fantastic! I messed up and put a little too much pesto on which made the liquid/oil nearly boil the bottom of the chicken but the recipe amount seems about correct after checking against what I used. I would add some pesto on top instead and, if I had a torch, flambé it a little because crispy pesto is deadly.

Delicious. But I wish I had made the effort to buy prosciutto instead of using bacon the way other reviewers did. The bacon spat so much now I’m have to clean my oven!!  And even at 30 minutes at 400 the bacon didn’t crisp up. Prosciutto would have.

Very easy and delicious.  Buy the  thin sliced chicken breast or pound your breast flat to make rolling easier.  After it was rolled, and before baking,  I sliced the breast in half or thirds to make all the breast the same size and ensure uniform cooking.

I made this as a meal prep for the week....AMAZING!!!  I did make some changes.  After pounding my chicken breasts, I seasoned  them (inside and out) with salt-free chicken seasoning.  I then placed a layer of basil pesto, feta cheese, and instead of wrapping the breasts with the prosciutto, I placed it inside.  I rolled the chicken breasts and held it together with butcher's twine.  Surprisingly, the contents stayed instead.  The flavors were awesome.  The rest of the meal prep consisted of fresh buttery garlic green-beans and chicken broccoli rice.

Easy and delicious.  Two things:
1.  Slice open and stuff with gouda cheese.
2.  Cook on a baking rack instead of on the pan.

Been on a diet and always looking for ways to cut back carbs. So simple to make! I pounded the chicken flat. I used thick cut applewood smoked bacon and Canadian bacon with fresh garlic. Chicken, Pesto, Garlic, Canadian Bacon then smoked bacon and rolled it up. I baked it at 350 for 40 min to make sure the thick cut bacon cooked through. Served it with a seasoned Cauliflower mash and it was great! No to low carb and I will be making this one again.

My chicken was dry and I cooked it at 375. The chicken was sitting in a pool of oil. All the flavour seemed to have baked out of the pesto. Disappointing because it was easy to prepare, but I wouldn't make it again. It was lacking flavor too.

Making it for the 3rd time tonight! Recipe is great. I used 2 slices of prosciutto per chicken breast.  Serving over angel hair pasta. Veggie side and bread. 
So simple. Love it.

this was so good! I didn't have any prosciutto on hand so I just used some deli ham. It dried out just a little bit it might have been the fact I didn't have prosciutto so I flipped them over after taking it out of the oven and let it sit in the oil and juices for about five minutes and it helped.

I made this recipe as written. I baked it 35 minutes instead of 25 as called for in the recipe. The chicken breasts were moist with a mild flavoring. Thanks for sharing.

I butterflied the breasts. Seasoned with s &p, no salt seasoning and garlic powder.  Mixed in 2 tblsp of artichoke and Asiago dip with the pesto. No need to use toothpicks.  Then wrapped in prosciutto . Lots of juice and oil to baste with. Next time use less salt or no salt.  The prosciutto provides it. Serve with roast baby potatoes and steamed veggies or a side salad.  Will make again.

Delicious, super easy (my cooking-challenged daughter did it) and it looks impressive. The store was out of prosciutto , so I substituted Spicy Cotto. It was great.  That's all I would use now, as it perks up the bland chicken.

Very good! I made it with basil pesto and an asiago cheese  marinade. I cut the chicken breast in half and put the pesto inside the breasts along with a slice of prosciutto then let it soak in the asiago cheese marinade. Mine took about 40 minutes to cook through. At about 25 minutes I had to cut the tops open a bit. I served it with a side of pesto cavatappi pasta. I added fresh Sicilian cheeses to the pasta

Five star for the simplicity of the dish yet complex flavors. I used some pesto sauce from a jar which I never have as I prefer fresh but happened to have it on hand. The prosciutto got just a bit crisp yet cutable which was very nice. As the dish cooked, the meat and pesto made juices so the chicken didn't dry out. The flavor didn't totally knock my socks off. I think next time I will also add a slice of cheese just to give a bit more oomph.

I used bacon instead of pruscuitto. I also added crumbled feta. Baked it at 400 for 25 minutes then broiled it for about 3 minutes to make the bacon crispy! Served with rice and broccoli!

This is an excellent recipe.   I followed the recipe as I usually do when making a new recipe for the first time. I did use prosciutto.. I also pounded out the chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch thickness. I liberally applied thick pesto that I had just made to the breasts...

The only change I will make the next time I prepare this is to roast my pinions I had included in my pesto.

I made 5 servings for three of us thinking this would be good left over... Maybe next time...There were no left overs.

I also followed the directions for oven temperature... Ours was perfectly done in 21 minutes...

Thank you Pjaros  for sharing this recipe

Super quick, super easy, super tasty!  I tripled the recipe and served it with broccoli ( s&p, garlic, evoo) and brown rice...I've got a big family to feed.  It was a big hit!  The only thing that I did differently was to butterfly the chicken breast and put some pesto in the middle, fold it back up and then coat it with the pesto before putting the prosciutto on... I'm guessing it would be pretty amazing if I put a roasted red pepper/feta mix in there, too...

All I had on hand was sun dried tomato pesto so I used that in stead of the basil pesto, it was good though. Thought the prosciutto would crisp up more (and wow what a pain to work with...like filo dough). Will try it again when I have basil pesto.

Awesome recipe and super simple and easy to put together! I used bacon because I had it, pounded the chicken before following the recipe. YUM!

Delicioso!   Love this recipe. My husband normally doesn't care to much for pesto and I love it.  This recipe was enjoyed by us both.

Yummers!  I think next time I will wrap the chicken in bacon instead of the prosciutto, though.  The prosciutto was great, but it's EX-PEN-SIVE!!!  Thanks for the recipe - it's definitely a keeper!

This recipe is SO easy, and yummy! I followed directions exactly (used thin chicken breast) and it was perfect. I'm definitely going to add mozzarella cheese to put inside next time because who

Loved this one!  I used tenderloin rather than breasts clustering 3 pieces with the pesto filling the gaps.  Great flavor and the family requested to have it more!

I liked it, but my husband said that he didn't like how the proscuitto got chewy and he felt that the chicken wasn't flavorful throughout.  Maybe next time I will marinate first and then top with pesto and bake.

Make this for dinner, my husband loved it.  It is very good and easy to make.  I cooked my chicken on the grill and it turned out great.
