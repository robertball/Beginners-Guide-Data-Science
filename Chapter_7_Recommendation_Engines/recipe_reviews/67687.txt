Wow.  So simple, so delicious, and so healthy!  I doubled this and added mango, strawberries, and kiwi since watermelon isn't quite perfect yet this early in the year and it was such a hit at the potluck I made it for.  Everyone wanted to know why it was so incredibly good--and I think it was the orange-honey-ginger dressing.  This is going to be a stand-by for all my summer picnics and potlucks.

I made a change to the dressing.  I heated the orange juice, honey and ginger on the stove in a small sauce pan to boiling and added a teaspoon (I had doubled or tripled the amount, so use less for the original recipe) of cornstarch to thicken it.  I cooled it before pouring over the fruit.  It worked wonders; It actually stuck to the fruit!  The other change I made was to use cantaloupe and honey dew melons instead of the watermelon.  Everyone loved it and I think I will make it my summer potluck staple.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day this year and ever since, it's been my responsibilty to bring this salad to every family party.  I prefer it with watermelon and I definately suggest you let the fruit marinate in the dressing OVERNIGHT in the fridge.  This is Yummy with a capital "Y"!

Great recipe! I used a pineapple, blueberry, strawberry, melon and kiwi combination. I also served the "dressing" on the side.

I used the dressing on a totally melon salad (honeydew, canteloup, watermelon) and it was fabulous. Canned pineapple did not mix well with other summer fruits, however, in another sampling, although ripe fresh pineapple, blueberries, and peaches were quite good with the dressing flavors. The dressing is what I was searching for, so use your own fruit combinations to find what tastes best. (And I do NOT recommend marinating fruit with dressing in frig overnite...all fruit tastes and looks best freshly cut!......maybe serve the dressing on the side as a dipper?)

A delicious light and healthy dressing that enhances the flavor of the fruit without overpowering it.  I used about a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and used cantaloupe and peaches for the fruit.  A big hit with the whole family.

This was ok....i added dried coconut flakes and some sugar, and i used a combination of pineapple, apple, kiwi, blackberry, rasperry, and strawberry.  Next time, i might ;eave out the pineapple, because that and the orange juice was just too acidic together. I couldn't taste the ginger, maybe i should have added more. This tasted very good, but not necessarily because of the dressing. Just because i like fruit. Thanks anyway, i'll keep it in mind.

This fruit salad wasn't anything to write home about.  The dressing kept sinking to the bottom (even though I tossed it often)  so it didn't contribute much flavor and I was left with a bowl of fruit.  Not quite what I was expecting.

This went over well at a family BBQ party.  I used watermelon.  The ground ginger gave the dressing a definite zing.

Really good dressing for a fruit salad. I made mine with fresh pineapple, white peach, blueberries, and apple (didn't have any melon). I put the dressing over it and served it as a light dinner. It was perfect for a hot summer day. Thanks
