FLAWLESS. I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone absolutely raved about them. I made just as directed: butter, 10 chopped fun-size bars (I think that's about the same amount? I don't buy the bites) and natural creamy peanut butter. Very sweet but oh-so-good. I don't see how anyone could have a problem with these bars but I am the first review: hopefully these stay five-star because they really did blow my family away with the peanut-chocolately simplicity. Thanks so much for sharing!

My son's favorite candy is Butterfinger.  Found this recipe and made it with seven full sized bars.  It was AMAZING!  Still fresh and chewy days later.  Definitely a new family favorite!

Made exactly as is and just found it over the top sweet. Might be because my husband and I are rice Crispie square purists and don't like usually to add or change anything to them

pretty tasty. I will use more Butterfinger pieces next time though, the amount listed with the bites wasn't sufficient in my opinion. I'll probably top them with a lot of broken pieces next time for more Butterfinger flavor. still delicious though. I could eat a pan myself easily.

Oh my.......so simple and so good!  Brought these to work and everyone loved them.  Like other reviews - I used 7 full size candy bars.  (and crushed up part of a 8th to sprinkle on top)  Next time I might drizzle on a little melted chocolate to make them pretty.  : )  Certainly does not need it though.  It's one of those recipes that you go.......why didn't I think of that!

Just made this recipie and it was fantastic!!! Everyone loved it and I chopped  the leftover butterfinger bites on top, I also lined the pan with tin foil much easier clean up and no weird taste from the spray
