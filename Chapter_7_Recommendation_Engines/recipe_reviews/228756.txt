Yummy and different. Tastes better the longer it sits.

Super!  The wife and I both like to eat the heat, and we both
like fish.  So for us, it doesn't get any better than this. We've
made it so often that it's no longer "Jalapeno"  Tarter Sauce.
Around here its just Tartar Sauce.  If you don't have capers
I think you will enjoy it anyway, but I urge you to buy some.
They definitely add a sparkle to it.  So simple and so good,
yet I would have never thought to add Jalapenos.  
Many thanks, Dianna Brown-Brenny.

I bring home Snapper and Grouper every year for a NYE Fish Fry.  Two years ago I made this tartar sauce and everyone , about 30 people loved it.  Last year didn’t make it and had to listen to people complain all night as we didn’t have it.  This year 2019 made it again.  Was another hit and everyone was happy once again. Printed the receipt out for people to take home.  Had to do a second printing, 25 copies in all.  This is a big hit. I do bump up the jalapeño as I buy two of the largest available and use 100% of the peppers.  I also chop up everything very fine.

Loved this recipe. I made it just as it was and it is delicious. Everyone who's had it asked for the recipe.

We don't have any kind of tartar sauce at our house except jalapeno, thanks to this excellent recipe!  I leave out the capers because we never have any. Sometimes I chop a dill pickle as the recipe says and sometime I replace it with dill relish - just easier.  I put a lot more jalapeno in than 2 teaspoons, but we have a garden with lots of jalapenos!

I can't wait to try this. I really love the idea of kicking up the spice level in tartar sauce!

I love anything hot, but this had hardly any flavor and, it was too salty. I will have to blame myself for making the full receipt, I should have made 1/2.  I made it a day ahead of time for a fish fry, it was hardly eaten at all, so I guess my guests didn't love it either. I am slowly using the remainder for tuna salad and other like dishes so I don't waste. I might try again with a jalapeno with more oomph, not sure I have given up entirely. Love the idea.

Fabulous. If you got the dill pickles and capers in there, do your heart a favor and skip the salt, this recipe I think doesn't need it and I prepared mine without it.

Made this for fish fry. The day before I baked Tilapia & put some of this sauce on the fish. It was good! The next day I took it to the fish fry, I'm not much of a fried fish person, but I could tell the sauce was better the next day! Will make again.

The recipe was fine. Although I feel it did need some pickle juice. I added about a tablespoon and cut the entire recipe to a third. It was a little loose, but tasty just the same.
