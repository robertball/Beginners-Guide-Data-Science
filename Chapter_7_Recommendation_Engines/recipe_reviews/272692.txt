I made one change, with this recipe.... I used monk fruit sweetener from Costco, instead of sugar... And it came out just as I had hoped!   Perfect for a lower carb sugar-free diet!!  And, it tastes 'normal.'   I bake with monk fruit sweetener a lot, lately, and I prefer it to other non-carb sugar replacements, for taste.   I will be making this again, before Thanksgiving season passes us by!

I love anything pumpkin and this did not disappoint. I used Neufchâtel cheese, Truvia and added  a tsp of vanilla. Very reminiscent of crustless pumpkin pie. Will make again. Thank you for the recipe! I

I made it like the recipe. It was good. The next time I make it I will be adding 1 tsp vanilla and will increase the cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. This will be good at Thanksgiving as I have to watch my carb and sugar intake.

I couldn’t find pumpkin purée, so I used pumpkin pie canned mix, and it came out pretty good, but next time I’ll try it with pumpkin purée and see how that comes out (:
