This was very good and a nice change from the norm.  Just make sure you fine chop the orange zest.  I also used a deep dish pan and it was filled to the brim.  Enjoy!

Very nice for company! They won't be expecting this when you say "pumpkin pie" for dessert! Really good. I'm making another tonight to take to work tomorrow. I think i'll impress my coworkers!! I hate zesting rinds, don't know why, but for this i'll do it!

I Love this recipe and think it is a real nice addition of both the orange and walnuts!  Beautiful but I cooked it a bit longer after I put topping on-could be difference in ovens.
