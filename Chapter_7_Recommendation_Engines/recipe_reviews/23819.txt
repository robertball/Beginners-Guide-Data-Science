These were fabulous. I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the dough mix, and only used 1/2 a cup of milk (Use butter, not shortening). I added 1/2 cup more of brown sugar to the butter and cinnamon. The outcome was to die for!!! My suggestion is to not use the melted butter, but use butter at room temp, and spread with a knife over the dough.

FABOOO snack! MY family gobbled these down before I knew it! Very tasty. My suggestion is that u DONT use the muffin liners. The cinnamon turns into a carmel like substance and its VERY hard removing them..Otherwise it was pefect!!

This recipe is great....the biscuit dough is just the type of dough I was looking for. I also did not use muffin tins....and I think next time I bake them I will add more cinnamon and use brown sugar with the white sugar to make them extra gooey!!

My husband really, really liked these. He ate 5!  He saw me making them and asked me to add pecans and really that was the only added ingredient.  I don't pour in all of the milk at one time when making biscuits, bread, etc... because some days you need it all and some days you don't depending on the weather.  I floured my parchment paper, my hands, the rolling pin for rolling out the dough and had no problem.  When rolling the dough into the roll, just use the floured parchment paper to roll and it won't be sticky.  After it's rolled, you might want to place in the fridge for a few secs to make slicing easy.  I didn't use the muffin tins and only cooked half of the log.  I made icing by using 1 cup confectionary sugar, 1 tbsp vanilla and maybe one tablespoon of milk. (Add slowly until you get the consistancy you like.) Just drizzled it over hot rolls with a spoon and they were beautiful!

These turned out way better than I thought they would.  They were tender and flaky!  I added about 1/4 c sugar to the flour mixture just to make sure the dough didn't taste like a biscuit.  I also baked them on a sheet rather than in a muffin tin.  They turned out great and didn't last through the day.  The only negative thing about them is they lose the delicate texture several hours after baking.  I guess that means we'll have to eat them all right out of the oven!

Fantastic!  So easy, so good.  Just a word- I used parchment paper on a jelly roll pan and they get a lot BIGGER, so space them well, and use butter for a great taste and texture!!

OMG! These are absolutely delicious!! I have searched long and hard for a cinnamon roll recipe that is quick and yummy and I found it. These taste like Pillsbury cinnamon buns! I was shocked at how easy they really were. Other reviewers have mentioned a problem with the dough being sticky and the dough being too salty-I had none of these problems, I followed closely and they came out sinfully good! I added flour until it was the texture where I knew I was able to roll it easily. I would suggest to those add a little less salt next time and be patient with the dough until it is the consistency that you can work with...
This is going to become my new "Holiday Morning Cinnamon Bun" recipe. I can not tell you how much time this recipe saves compared to your standard yeast roll recipes and is just as good, if not better! Thanks a bunch-It's a definite keeper!!! =)

So good! Followed the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of sugar to the dough as well, and used about half the amount of milk stated. Used milk to seal the edges. The texture is wonderful. Using some leftover dough, I sprinkled sugar, cocoa powder and a few chocolate chips, then baked those as well. Also good. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

First I divided the recipe in half. Didn't need 12 servings - though I'm sure we could have easily eaten more. I made a few slight changes. I added a teaspoon of white granulated sugar to the dough to sweeten it. I also reduced the milk by a third. I added a bit more brown sugar and melted the butter into it before spreading the mixture onto the rolled out dough. Rather than using muffin tins, I greased a pie pan and fit them all into it. Worked out perfect. I will make these again.

Tasted nice, but was nearly impossible to roll up since the dough was so sticky and stuck to the board even though I had floured it. Definitely needs less liquid... Any raisins that arent covered with dough will burn, so be sure to keep that from happening.

This is the ultimate "quick and easy" cinnamon roll recipe for me! Everyone enjoyed these! My son thought I made "Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls". I've also made them using a combo of butter and garlic and butter and chive, which also came out fabulous!! If I could,I would give this recipe ten stars! **********-Done! Thank You for sharing this most awesome recipe, my family thanks you and so do I!! P.S. forgot to mention- I used margarine instead of short; omitted raisins and baked on a cookie sheet. I also added additional flour til mix was easy to roll out. Will refridgerate b/4 slicing next time. I used canned vanilla frsoting  and it was so yummy! Will be using this recipe for many years to come!

This had way too much milk.  I had to add an extra cup of flour to make this dough even somewhat manageable.  It is very sticky to roll out, so don't skimp on flouring your board.  The final product is tender like biscuits and goes well with a thin cream cheese frosting.

I followed the recipes but just like some other comments that it's not possible to knead or roll the dough because it's too moist. I don't call them Cinnamon Rolls or Pinwheels. Strange recipe, I think.

These were delicious!!!  I didn't melt the butter, but I think I will next time. Either that or make sure to press the sugar mixture down into the butter and dough so I can get a tighter roll. When I went to cut them and put them onto the cookie sheet the sugar was falling out. I just scooped it back into the rolls. They tasted fabulous and my husband wants me to make these again. which is a compliment since he doesn't really like cinnamon rolls that much.

Yum! My kids loved these cinnamon rolls, and I was happy with the time required to prepare the recipe.  I modified the recipe a little because of food allergies in the family.  I used a soy margarine and non-hydrogenated shortening in place of the butter and shortening called for.  I also substituted 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour to add a little more nutritional value. I made a soy-cream cheese icing to top the rolls.  Absolutely delicious even with all of these changes to the original recipe!

It was so good! Also i omitted the raisins because i don't like raisins. It came out good but the first batch came out really bland. Also i kinda didn't like how the dough was flaky, but at a party everyone else liked it.

These are the perfect BREAKFAST cinnamon rolls. It was definitely NOT too sweet. It was accompanied nicely by some sausage with melted cheese.

I made some changes. 1) I didn't add quite as much cinnamon. 2) I didn't use muffin pans, either.

Oh! And a tip, if not using muffin pans, put each individual roll face up.

I have adapted this recipe to make what I call butterscotch bisquits.I use buttermilk to make the dough, omit raisin, and spread the dough with a butter brown sugar paste, plus I spread the pan with the same paste.  I even make them the night before. Thanks

this were good and really easy to make because it didn't need yeast! however, we found it a bit salty and had a weird after taste, probably from the baking powder..next time i will add less salt and less baking powder

I made the recipe nearly as written (sans raisins, on a cookie sheet w/parchment) and it was SUBERB! My infant son kept yelling 'bun' at me after he'd finished his and would not eat anything else. Dough was easy to handle and they were amazing even without icing!

I wanted to make a cinnamon roll that didn't contain yeast. Gave this a try. Followed the directions but used margerine instead of shortening and omitted the raisins. When making the dough, I slowly added the milk then rolled the sticky dough on a floured surface. After making it, I refridgerated it overnight. Baked them on a big pie pan (don't use a cookie sheet since the butter will melt all over) in a 415 degree gas oven. After they were baked, spread a cream cheese frosting (3 tsp soft butter, 1/3 c. cream cheese, splash vanilla extract, 1/2 c. powdered sugar). It was pretty good, you can taste the baking powder in this these and they aren't very big sized rolls. My family liked them. My husband ate 4 of them.

My partner absolutely LOVED these! I omitted the raisins, and used some whole wheat flour as i didnt have quite enough all-purpose. Added a bit of extra brown sugar, a bit more butter, and a bit less milk. Have an apartment sized oven (smaller) so set it for 410F, and baked for 14minutes. Only way to be improve may be to sweeten the dough with a bit of sugar or vanilla?

What a mess!  It was a fairly easy recipe, but I agree that it was a mess.  I followed the recipe and although it tasted good, the pinwheels spread way too much, and the filling spread everywhere.  And well it was just a big mess.  Worked for the moment to calm my cinnamon roll cravings, but will definitely not be making these again.

These took long to make. They were sticky and my arms were so tired of rolling them out when I finished. My siblings and I enjoyed them together fresh out of the oven, but the cinnamon turned hard the next day. Too much cinnamon?

Like others, I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of sugar to the dough. Made a simple glaze of powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and sour cream...heavenly!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  First of all, the dough was way too sticky to either knead or roll out, and I had to add more flour.  I also thought it called for way too much butter to be spread on the dough.  As I cut the roll and tried to put the pieces in the muffin cups, generally the pinwheels got distorted.  The finished product was very good, but not as tasty as I had expected.  In all, I don't think I will make these again.  They took much longer to make than I expected, and the outcome, while good, was not as good as I'd hoped it would be.

Delicious! I, too, used all butter instead of shortening. Had to add some extra flour due to it being so sticky. But I've made them twice and everyone loves them! I whip up a small bowl of icing real quick and drizzle on top.

These are so yummy and really easy to make. I always feel guilty eating cinnamon buns but these are about a quarter of the size of the regular kind. That way I only feel a quarter of the guilt and they definately cure the craving.

My boyfriend LOVES these Pinwheels.  He is always asking me to make them for him for breakfast.  One tip is to make sure you roll them up tight so that they don't fall apart!

Followed the recipe except omitted the raisins and used butter instead of shortening as I didn’t have any. Absolutely delicious. Quick and easy for a weekend morning. No icing is necessary as these are plenty sweet. I recommend grating the butter into the flour dry mixture (a tip I got from another fav AR recipe) as it seems to bake the dough flakier. Definitely making these again soon.

I didn't use a muffin pan, I sliced each roll and set them in a 9" cake pan.  I used butter instead of shortening.    Very soft dough, needs lots of kneading flour.  Take care not to make the dough stiff.  Gentle Gentle!!  Yum!

The dough is salty, or at very least, not sweet. There were some great suggestions in other reviews, but as is, the recipe is just okay. I didn't really like it, but I also wouldn't throw in the towel on it. With some alterations, it has potential.

I first made this with in my cooking class - my teacher used your recipe - and I kept it for the future. Next time, I made them for a bridal shower and they loved it! I also decided to make it for a family gathering and it was a hit! I suggest not to change anything on the recipe - it's perfect - except for the icing sugar. I added less milk because I wanted it a bit more gooey. But that's about all I changed. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Mmmm!  These were delicious!  Fast and easy enough to make in the morning for breakfast...No yeast!  I used all butter instead of shortening when I made these and they turned out perfect...Very soft, fluffy and flaky.

These pinwheels were delicious.  I brought the over as a hostess gift (what was left of them since we could not stop ourselves from eating them fresh out of the even) and all the guests loved them!  I did however, burn myself on the filling when trying to take them out of the muffin tins.  Next time, I will try baking them on a baking sheet line with parchemin paper.  These are at their best when they are still hot out of the oven.

What a great, quick alternative to making cinnamon rolls. They were gone as soon as the plate touched the table!
