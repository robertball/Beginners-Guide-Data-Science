We really liked the chicken- thought it was a super yummy marinade, but the strawberry salsa was just okay. We thought it had way too many flavors going on- fruit, chiles, onion, mint- too much. Will proabably make the marinade again because we liked it so muhc, but will leave off the salsa or just use plain ol' strawberries with a little bit of sugar.

There was a time when I couldn't imagine combining meats with fruits.  Not any more, I have learned to love the combination.  THIS is GREAT.  Every single thing appealed to me.  The hot, the sweet, the sour cream. OH!!!  If you think you won't like this-well maybe you won't.  I plan on this being a work lunch at least 3x's a week.

This was really good.  I too am not one to eat fruit with my meats yet the spice of the pepper, the sweet of the strawberries and the cool of the sour cream was just terrific.  My whole family enjoyed, even my pickest son(who omitted the sour cream). Kids gave it a 2 thumbs up so it is a keeper.

This was sooo good!  I decided to try it because my fiance loves strawberries. I was worried about the spice because he deos't really like things very spicy, but it was perfect and he loved it! It's one of our favorites!

My family loves this recipe! Instead of raspberry vinegar I used raspberry pomegranate salad dressing. I also use cilantro instead of mint. Other recipes that I have found for this suggests adding  avocado in the salsa with juice from 1 whole lime. Some add honey instead of sugar. I'm going to try different variations....maybe even add some mango!

The whole family loved this recipe.  When the chicken is topped with lots of salsa and a big dollup of our cream it looks like a sundae!

Fantastic.  I didn't have mint and used cilantro instead.  Worked wonderfully.

So Good! This is now one of my favorites

I didn't have everything on hand so I used balsamic vinegar in place of the raspberry vinegar and cilantro in place of the mint but I'm sure its great as written as well. Oh, and I also left the serrano seeds in for the extra kick. I don't really like sour cream so I was planning on leaving it off but decided to put a little dab on just to try it and it was amazing, it added a whole other layer of depth to the dish

We loved this recipe.  I can hardly wait to make it again.  Using fresh ingredients is the key.  I’ve got mint in my garden and wow, it really added great flavor.  Couldn’t find the Serrano chile so used jalapeno.  I also used some chipotle powder in addition to the chili powder.  And my husband is a big garlic fan who thinks you can never have enough garlic. I removed all of the seeds from the chiles, so it was not a hot dish; will probably leave some in for some more heat next time.

Delightful dressing; added more rasp vinegar, less sugar, chipotle chile powder, cilantro, green onions, and cucumbers.

Great dish, especially for spring and summer when strawberries are in season.  I marinated my chicken all day and broiled them, since it was too cold to grill outside.  This was delicious!

This was way different and surprisingly yummy. I used fresh frozen strawberries (they worked great), no serrano peppers on hand so I used jalaps, I strongly dislike mint in my food so I used cilantro like many others and it was wonderful. I will make this one again. It's quick, healthy,tasty, and a perfect use for my bottle of raspberry balsamic =))

I liked this fine but the rest of the family didn't seem to care for it. The only issue I have with it is if you don't eat it all the first day, the strawberries go bad if they sit in the fridge.

We liked this one a lot!  It was certainly a bit different, but most enjoyable.  I made 1/2 the recipe, but cut the sugar back to 2 t. instead of 1 T. because I thought it might be too sweet.  But, I was wrong - it needed that extra teaspoon and I'll add it next time.

My 30th birthday was this Saturday and I had about 20 people over.  I served this chicken and salsa and it was the biggest hit of the day!  Most people told me they had never tasted anything like it and that it should be in a resturant.  I let the chicken marinate for 6 hours and i let the salsa sit mixed in the fridge for 2 hours or more and served it chilled.  I forgot to set out sour cream with it, but no one seemed to mind - those are the only things that i did different from the recipe above.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS RECIPE!

this was awesome! I didn't have time to marinate but it still turned out pretty good. Since I didn't have time, I had to change a few things...didn't use any of the peppers and used the raspberry vinegar dressing, I changed the 1/4c oil to 1/4c raspberry vinegar and used 2tbsp of olive oil instead. The grocery store didn't have mint so I also used cilantro. This is a definite keeper...thanks

My whole family loved this! I used raspberry balsamic vinegar because that's what I had, plus I used jalapeno pepper instead of the serano - again because that's what I had. Also substituted fresh lime juice for the vinegar in the salsa and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again while strawberries are so plentiful. Final substitute was cilantro for mint because we love cilantro. I'll try it as written next time. Thanks for sharing!

I had been looking for raspberry vinegar for 2 months to make this recipe...the longer I waited, the more I could taste it.  I found raspberry wine vinegar last week and made this recipe last night.  After waiting for so long, I was really nervous about whether or not hubby and I would actually like it.  It was DELICIOUS - one of the best new recipes that we have ever tried.  Hubby is not at all big on chicken, but he is already planning to make this for out of town guests next month.

I've tried this recipe a few time and I keep twee king it .  The original salsa is way to sweet for me and the chicken marinade is tame so I don't seed the Serrano chilies.

A delicious summer recipe! I also didn't have raspberry vinegar so I used a prepared raspberry vinaigrette and substituted mint for cilantro. The chicken was lightly sweet and very tender and juicy, and the combination of sour cream, spicy strawberries with the chicken was delightful. I served it with fresh cut summer corn sauteed with garlic, lime, and topped with queso fresco

This meal was great! The whole family loved it! We really liked the Strawberry salsa, which I have also made this salsa replacing the strawberries with Mangos, and also did one with pineapples.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times and haven't changed a thing! It's a simple recipe but looks and tastes elegant. . The flavors are wonderful and it looks beautiful in a plate. The salsa is also delicious on Salmon. It's a great for company too. Grill the chicken ahead and keep in wa in the oven or refrigerate overnight and warm, covered with foil before serving. :-)

Hubby loved this one, I liked it but didn't love it. Next time I'll reduce the sugar or take it out completely as it was too sweet for my taste. Good combination of flavors though.

I combined all the marinade ingredient with some strawberry yogurt and used a bit of strawberry jam and balsamic vinegar in the salsa.  This was a very enjoyable way to use fresh strawberries.  
Round two:  apparently I missed the fact that I had tried this recipe once already and decided this was a great recipe for some beautiful ahi tuna steaks and fresh strawberries that I had just picked up.   I followed the recipe exactly except for using tuna which was a really great combination for us and reducing the recipe by half to make only two portions.  I agree with another reviewer that this should be enjoyed fresh.

This combination of chicken and strawberries really works!  Just the right amount of spiciness, the mint, and red onions balance the sweet strawberries with the chicken.

Personally, I'd leave the serrano out, & add some chopped mild green chilies instead. Some folk can't handle too much heat, & those are HOT! Otherwise, very good recipe & quite unusual.
