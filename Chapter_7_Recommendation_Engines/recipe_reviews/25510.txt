This is an excellent recipe!!  I've been making this for years!!!  I have found that the dip stays hotter even longer if you warm it in a 300 degree oven for 20-30 minutes!!! Yum!!

Very easy, cheap and good. We used chili with beans and it turned out excellent. I put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 8 minutes instead of using the microwave like the directions said.

I have made this dip for years (in the oven) and I always used Hormel chili WITH beans.....I tried it once without the beans only cause I couldn't find the other and I didn't care for it.  I always am asked to bring this dip to parties (I always bring enough for a double batch).  Trust me, you won't have ANY leftovers with this one!!

I've made this dip numerous times and it's a hit everytime! I try and make is a little healthier, so I use Turkey Chili, Light Cream Cheese and 2% Chedder Cheese.
I made it for Superbowl and it was devoured by all! I heated in the stove, instead of the microwave, 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

This is one of my favorites dips! and it can be made in the crockpot too. Just layer the ingredients (cream cheese, then chili, then cheddar) turn on low and heat for 1 -3 hours depending on how cold your cream cheese is. Stir and serve. I usually double the recipe but use 3 cans of chili. Anyone who normally 
is turned off by using canned chili shouldn't be. It's 
excellant served with tortilla chips! This is the same recipe as "Man Dip" posted later on this site.

yeah, ditto.  we've made this recipe since the early 80's only diff is we don't use chedder, just cream cheese chili and about a half a cup of your favorite salsa.  Always made before the big game.

This was fantastic.  I was looking for a way to use some leftover chili and this was recommended. I couldn't believe something so easy would be such a hit!  I made it for a few friends and it was gone in 10 min.  We decided that we are going to have to make sure we always have leftover chili so we can make this the next day.

I used reduced fat cream cheese and 2% shredded sharp cheddar. Out of desperation to clean out the dregs of containers in my fridge, I threw in the last bits from a salsa container and a half can of green chilies that I'd had sitting in a small tupperware container. My boys totally scarfed this up. I did not bake this, I just dumped everything in my Crockette (small crockpot made just for dips) at breakfast this morning so it could heat through until snacktime. They loved it!

We call this one "crack dip" because once you have a bite you are hooked and can't leave it alone.  I cook it in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hour.  We have been known to go through 2 double batches at a single party with no leftovers.

Wow. How simple, yet soooooooo good! Instead of using the microwave, I baked it at 350 (uncovered) for 20-25 minutes. This is definitely a keeper.

This was really good.  I used a can of turkey chili with no beans and added a little red pepper to it for heat.  I also baked at 350 for 30 minutes (15 mins covered, 15 uncovered).  I wasn't expecting to like it - the canned chili had me hesitant - but I have to admit I was surprised.  Very good and very, very easy.

Served this to family and everyone loved it. I did use Turkey chili. Because kids were going to be eating it. Beat the turkey chili up with mixer. So that the kids wouldn't see the beans. Very good same favor.

Pretty good.  Quite easy.  Tastes as expected.  Maybe adding green onion on top would be good.

This is wonderful dip. It was so simple and quick to make. I also cooked it 350 for about 25 and it was nice and hot. We really enjoyed this while watching football. Thanks ONEANGEL for this great recipe.

I have made this dish for years. I layer the cream cheese first, then the Hormel chile without beans, and then 4 stalks of chopped scallions. Then I top it with a package of monterey jack shredded cheese. Then bake in 350 degree oven for about 25 mins. Everyone loves it!!

Wonderful and quick. Being allergic to onions and peppers, it's very hard for me to find a recipe that doesn't call for them. Chip dip being among the hardest to find. I never would have thought that cream cheese could make such a great entrée!

Way too salty! I might try it again with leftover homemade chili, but commercially made chili in a can is very salty I guess.

This is so good - So easy- I love also to use refried beans instead of chili- I will make this sometimes for husband, son and I, and we will dip and eat as part of dinner.  can be microwaved or done in oven.

YUM! Used chili with beans. I forgot that I was going to make this and my guests started arriving, so I litterally just threw all the ingredients in the dish (didn't bother to spread the cream cheese around) and nuked it, mixed it all up after it came out, and it was GREAT!! Everyone wanted the recipe!

This was satisfactory for me.  I used chili without beans because that is all I had on hand.  I felt the recipe was lacking although, I liked the whole idea of a layered chili-cheese dip.  The cream cheese was a nice addition although, I thought the dip was lacking and needed to be jazzed up a bit.  My husband didn't care for it.  I may make again using chili with beans and some additions of my own.  Decent recipe if you're in a hurry and don't have any other alternatives.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was good but a little boring.  I will try it again but make some changes to spice it up, it's a good basic recipe and it's perfect if you need to whip up something quickly.

I've been making this recipe since I was 13 years old. A great simple dip that everyone loves. The only thing I do differently is use Monterey Jack cheese, beanless chili, and I stick it in the oven at 350 F for about 10 minutes.

Soooo good!! I made it in the crockpot instead of the microwave and had to change a few things. I heated up the chili in a microwave safe dish for about 5 minutes. I then mixed the chili with the cream cheese [the heated chili "melted" the cream cheese] and threw that into the crockpot. The shredded cheese was sprinkled across the top, and I set the crockpot on low until the cheese melted. From there I kept it on warm all night and it held up perfectly! Everyone raved about it and the the bowl was literally licked clean by the end of the night.

This is a great dip! I serve w/ tortilla chips or crackers. Try sprinkling a little garlic powder/parsley on the cream cheese layer for a different flavor.

I have made this recipe before, but instead of cooking it in the microwave, I cook it in the oven. I think it brings out the flavors more. Try covered at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and continue cooking uncovered for an additional 10 minutes. You will know it's done when you can see the bottom layer of cream cheese bubbling.

I made this!! It was so simple, quick and easy. I didnt follow the same measurements given, because I love cheese so I used more than indicated. I also left it in the microwave for 8 minutes because I wanted the cheese to be extra cheesy! My boyfriend loved it!!

I have been making this for years and is my go to recipe for potlucks and get togethers.  I usually use the turkey version of canned chili with no beans.  My brother has also started making this as well and uses a taco or Mexican style shredded cheese instead of regular cheddar which is really good as well.

This dip is amazing!  Made it for Christmas Eve and it was so easy. Everyone loved it!  I did cook it in the oven and I think that made it even better. I cooked it at 300 for about 30 minutes. It made the cream cheese melts and the cheese on top melted nicely and was bubbly. Definitely making this again!

I have been making this dip for years and everyone loves it. I always try to have the ingredients on hand so I can just throw it together for unexpected guests. It's always a hit. We eat it with tortilla chips but ran out after I made a second batch the other night so we used Ritz crackers instead.

Not as great as the classic chili and velveeta dip, but pretty good. A quick, cheap and easy appetizer.

It was really easy, but nothing special. Put a little more effort in and you can make something that tastes better.

Greatest (and EASIEST!) dip ever. Took a previous poster's advice and cooked it on 400 degrees. What a perfect football game recipe! Thank you!

Very good but I made with chili with out beans and would probably be better with chili with beans.   I also microwaved dip and it seemed watery I'm not sure if it was because I used the generic yoders cream cheese or my chili didn't have beans.  I would make again but cook in oven like other reviewer's recomended.  I would also make sure I used chili with beans.  I also used 1 cup cheese maybe it needs more cheese.

Very easy, very good dip. I used turkey chili and reduced fat cream cheese. I will surely make again.

This recipe needs help.. So I dumped in salsa and taco seasoning then it had more flavor. I though it would be good. But it was really blah. Guess it all depends on your taste buds. But mine like lots of flavor..

This is so easy, and really good!  I sometimes add jalapeno peppers.  Sometimes we eat it as a dip, sometimes we eat them in tortilla/taco shells, or even on hot dogs.

I added jalapenos and black olives on top put in oven for 20 minutes at 350 and when done I wrapped it up in a tortilla with fritos in it.  Delicious.
Makes a great burrito.

I was really disappointed with this dip. I thought it would taste better than it did. It seemed to lack flavor.

I have had this in the past and it's my favorite.  If I don't have cheddar, I will substitute it with shredded mozz. or just regular chesse broken up.

A friend suggested this recipe for a get-together. It was a big hit. We couldn't stop dipping in the dip (forgive the pun). This dip is absolutely addicting.

Best with chili no-bean ~ I like to mix in a packet or so of taco seasoning in addition (less or a whole packet acc to your tastes)~ to either the cream cheese if its softened enough or even to the chili. So easy & delish!
