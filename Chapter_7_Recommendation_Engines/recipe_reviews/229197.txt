I made this to take to the nail salon for my fdil and her bride's maids the day before my manchild's wedding. We all enjoyed it very much! I made 1 1/2x the recipe and babyxray and I enjoyed the leftovers the day after the wedding before heading to the airport. I did use ginger ale that I had leftover from Thanksgiving in place of the 7up.

I enjoyed this a lot. The first time I made it it tasted like it needed more sprite/7up so I added more and it was great. The second time I omitted the water and it was perfect!

A great "mock-tail" to have during holiday dinners. Kids love the fizzy stuff.
