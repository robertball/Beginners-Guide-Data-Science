This recipe almost has it right except for the Alfredo Sauce.  In the resaturant not mentioned it is a white wine butter sauce. I make this all the time we LOVE it but I do it right!  Sauted chicken strips in olive oil 1/4 cup with salt and pepper. Remove from pan leave bits in bottom. Add peppers and onion to pan and saute til tender not too soft, then also remove from pan.  Add more olive oil if needed you need 1/4 cup then add 3-4 cloves of garlic minced saute til soft and slightly brown be careful not to burn. Add 3 T flour and wisk then add 1 cup dry white wine to deglaze pan scrapping all bits with wooden spoon. let reduce down on med heat. Add 1 can chicken broth when thick add 1/4 cup cold butter in pieces stir well.  Check for seasoning may need addtnl salt and pepper. Add back in chicken and pepper&onions to rehaeat serve over fav pasta! yum yum and the real deal!

I love chicken scampi at the Italian restaurant chain and hated this one. The alfredo sauce is all wrong for the recipe. Try Chicken Scampi II. It tastes much more like the recipe at the Italian restaurant.

Great recipe, though I did make my own Alfredo sauce. (I hate that stuff in the jar! Ick!) I just mixed a few Tblsp of butter with a few Tblsp of flour and stired in a sauce pan untill crumbly. I then added about 2 cups of light cream (Heavy cream is better, but I always feel guilty *LoL*) I finished it off with a 1/4 good dry white wine, and 4 large crushed garlic cloves. Yum!!!

This recipe almost has it right except for the Alfredo Sauce. I was hoping for something similar to the chicken scampi from Olive Garden.  This was sort of close but not exactly.  The sauce from Olive Garden does not taste like alfredo sauce and it's a different consistency.  So I did an experiment.  It seems like the resaturant version is something like a white wine butter cream sauce?  So I followed steps one and two (the same way as written) but when it came time for the sauce I just melted butter, then sauted the garlic in the melted butter, then added half and half (cream) and some white wine.  In my opinion, this turned out much better.  Very yummy!

I recently made this for my family who loved it.  I altered it quite a bit to add more flavor.  I used a roasted garlic alfredo sauce, chicken broth and white wine instead of the reserved pasta liquid, and added garlic powder, basil, oregano, and 1 tsp lemon juice to the sauce.  I also added salt and pepper as needed.

I love Olive Garden Chicken Scampi, but this tastes nothing like it.  Scampi sauce is not alfredo sauce, this is all wrong.  I made this again, but made my own scampi sauce which is butter, onions, chablis wine, heavy cream and seasonings, and it tasted identical to restaurant-style scampi.

If you love the chicken scampi at the Olive Garden, this isn't quite it, but it's not bad for an at home knock off either.  As many reviewers have said, it's a little bland, so go ahead and spice it up with some extra garlic and whatever other italian spices you prefer.  Using chicken broth instead of the reserved pasta water helped add a bit more flavor.  You'll definitely want to either halve the pasta or double the sauce, depending on how many you're feeding.  It would be much too dry as written.  I'm sure homemade alfredo sauce would make this fabulous, but that's more work than I'm looking for unless it's a very special occasion!  Overall, my family really enjoyed this dish.  Even my 3 and 6 year olds cleaned their plates.  Just don't expect that you're getting an exact replica of the Olive Garden's dish.  If you want that, head out for dinner!

I did as another reviewed suggested and made a white wine butter sauce instead of using the alfredo sauce. But I did everything else the same. This was a HUGE hit, my husband has already begged me to make it again! It was not quite as good as the chicken scampi at olive garden but I was still very satisfied :) Thank you!

This was better than Olive Gardens.  I cut the spaghetti in half per other suggestions and it was great. I couldn't find the Four Cheese Alfredo sauce so I used one 16 oz. jar of Classic Alfredo instead & it was great.

I used an orange pepper instead of green and made my own alfredo sauce. I think this wouldn't have been as good had I not made my own sauce. I thought this was great as did my oldest boy though my youngest and husband were indifferent. This didn't really need the flour coating. I'd like to try this with a little fresh lemon juice next time.

I loved this one. After trying the chicken scampi at that Italian Restaurant Chain, I thought I'd cook it for my hunny. He loved it. That was late last year. I'll be making again this evening. My mouth is already watering at the thought :) Thanks so much for finding the secret :)

Eh. This was OK. I worked from home today. When I do, I like to make a nice dinner (I rarely have time to make a sit-down dinner due to my daily commute to Chicago). Because this wasn't too complicated and called for ingredients I had in my pantry, I decided to give it a try. While I didn't "hate" this, I wasn't "wowed" either. My hubby liked this a little more than I did, so I decided on a 3 star rating. Afraid that my final dish would lack flavor, I made a few changes. Keep in mind, I have never ordered chicken scampi at the "chain" and have nothing to compare this to. Here are my changes: a) added a t each of dried parsley / basil and 1/2 t oregano (to my flour), b) cut my chicken into cubes (personal preference) and c) subbed chicken broth for the cooking liquid called for. Neither the spices or broth enhanced the end product, so I'm not sure I'd recommend adding / substituting them. Served with garlic breadsticks, this was a decent meal, but not one I'm anxious to repeat. Thanks anyways, Julie. :-)

Update: I haven't made this dish in years but cooked it again last night-- this time without the jarred sauce and using 8 oz of whole wheat angel hair (or capellini) pasta. It was fabulous! Again, I seasoned the flour liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a sprinkle of paprika.  While cooking the peppers, onion, and garlic, I sprinkled in a bit more salt, pepper, and garlic salt with parsley. Once that was finished cooking, I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Then I stirred in 3 Tb of unsalted butter, 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of freshly shredded parmesan cheese. Tossed in the pasta and let it soak up the sauce before serving. This way of cooking tasted much more authentic to the restaurant scampi than when I cooked it before using the jarred Alfredo. Will definitely make this again!

I only used 3/4 pkg of spaghetti and still the ratio of pasta to the chicken and peppers was way too much!  I might try again but with half the pasta and when peppers are in season.  The peppers were slightly bitter, which didn't help the taste at all.

I am giving this five stars because the concept was great, it was easy to make, but it was lacking in flavor. Next time I will up the quantity of spices I used.  I did mix seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder with the flour.  I also added some basil along with the parsley to the sauce. Will give it another try.

This was one of the best recipes I've had in a long time. Chicken scampi is the ONLY thing I get at a "certain" restaurant. It was so nice to be able to make it at home. I used chicken broth instead of reserved water, and will make sure to add a bit more garlic next time. But all in all, it was wonderful!

I agree that the recipe was bland.  We even used chicken broth and white wine instead of the reserved water, hoping that is would add more flavor. I also added oregano and basil.  If we make this again I will add more garlic (much more) and salt.

sorry, but I really hated this dish.  I did everything as specified, but it was completely tasteless.  The chicken, pasta, and vegetables were all bland because this dish depends completely on the sauce to give any flavor.  It doesn't taste anything like the dish at the Olive Garden.  I am very disappointed and will not be making this again.

I agree with previous reviewers--too much pasta!  But otherwise, this is delicious.

This was great!  I think next time I'll add more chicken though as it seemed like the pound of spaghetti overran it.  I also used Light Alfredo sauce and it turned out great!!!

4 stars because there is either not enough sauce or too much noodle, however it works out it left the dish with only subtle hints of taste and alot of starch.

I made the recipe as described (almost).  I think if one is going to rate a recipe it should be the recipe described.  A few small things, I used whole wheat pasta.  I took my chicken breasts and cut them on the diagonal crosswise to get nice sized nuggets about 2 1/2 inches diameter. I didn't wipe the olive oil out of the pan then just add more olive oil; why waste that good, chicken flavored oil.  I'm saving this one, it's a keeper!

I found the Alfredo sauce wrong for this recipe. And I agree that the white wine butter cream sauce is the way to go. Also I added fresh lemon juice to taste .

Very yummy...  Personally I didn't think it needed the bell peppers but they were good just the same. You could easly add more things. Next time we will use shrimp.

I decided to follow sweetie pies review almost exactly but didn't have white wine so I used half sherry and half chicken stock. It was "almost" like olive gardens chicken scampi but was missing something...maybe needed more garlic (is that possible?). It was FANTASTIC, nonetheless.

Loved it! Easy and flavorful. Only made one minor change - I didn't have any alfredo sauce so I used one of those dry  mixes in the envelopes.

This was just okay. Pretty dry and bland in my opinion. Something is missing, I not quite sure what. Maybe needs some salt. I would make it again but tweak it a little.

Loved the concept of this one, but I agree with the others - be sure to double the amount of sauce. It was quite dry. I added lots of extra garlic and spiced up the flour, too. I still thought it was a fabulous dish, just needed more sauce and spice! Try it - everyone will love it with those changes!

This recipe is wonderful!  I agree with other people that adding spices to the flour helps and using chicken broth instead of the water is crutial.  This is a definite keeper.

I read the reviews, and a bunch of them said this was kind of bland... so I seasoned the flour (italian seasoning, salt, garlic powder), added more chopped garlic plus salt and pepper to the veggies.  I also served the pasta (angel hair - all I had!) on the side with a drizzle of the sauce (left out most of the reserved pasta water).  Even with all of my changes, it was still a bit bland.  4* for my changes.

Needed quite a bit of "doctoring" - definately needs ALOT more garlic.  I also added about 1 cup of grated romano cheese (from the block) and it really helped add to dullness of the jarred alfredo sauce.  I will make again and experiment with more spices and homemade Alfredo sauce.

Agree with other reviews, this dish was very bland.  In the future will add MUCH more garlic and experiment with other seasonings.  A good jumping-off point though.

This was fantastic!  Nearly felt like I was at the Olive Garden eating my favorite meal.  I did add Canned Chicken Broth to the Alfredo sauce in place of the pasta liquid.  And I used Anglehair paste instead. Mmmmm Mmm Makes my tastebuds water

This recipe is awesome!  I agree with previous reviewers, though - cut down on the amount of pasta, but make sure you add at least the recommended amount of garlic (or maybe more if you are a garlic lover!).  If you can find it, use Bertolli's Garlic Alfredo sauce (has more flavor than the plain Alfredo or Four Cheese Alfredo).

I seasoned the diced chicken with dry good seasons Italian mix and used roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  I added 1T of white wine to rinse the sauce from the jar.  So easy to prepare with normal ingredients.  Thanks for sharing!

I feel dishonest giving this recipe 5 stars since I used another reviewers alfredo recipe to make it. This recipe as posted IS NOT scampi.  It is an alfredo recipe.  I wish the author would change the name.  Either way, using the homemade alredo recipe, this was awesome! I'll look for an actual scampi recipe elsewhere.

It was pretty good!  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour when tossing the chicken.  I also took another reviewer's advice and added a packet of the McCormick garlic alfredo sauce seasoning mix to the alfredo sauce.  I didn't use all of the spaghetti called for because for us it just seemed like too much (used about 8 oz).  I like lots of flavor, so it still seemed to be missing something even with my extra flavor additions.  However, at the end of the day it was still a good and hearty meal!

I love Chicken Scampi at Olive Garden. This tastes nothing like it. It was OK, but not what I expected.

THis was really yummy. I actually used two packs of McCormick's Alfredo sauce instead of the jar sauce. It made plenty so I added the desired amount to the chicken mixture, and just left the rest in the pan for anyone who wanted extra sauce. Everyone loved it.

This was really good the next time I make it I am going to cut back on the peppers and add some different veggies. I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper to the flour before I coated the chicken. Turned out really good will definitely will make again.

Pretty good.. It was way too much Veggies for me so next time I probably won't use the green pepper and I'll double the sause.. I also added garlic powder, paparika , salt and pepper to my flour for the chicken and after I fried it I added some already made pesto . Yummo Very flavorful Oh btw it tasted a lot better the next day!

We loved this recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The second time I made a few alterations and used chopped green onions and some sliced mushrooms instead of the peppers and 2/3 cup chicken broth rather than the spaghetti water and it was every bit as good.

I liked this recipe for its foundation. As others suggested however, it was rather bland. 
To combat this, I made a rub for the chicken using garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper... and omitted using the flour entirely. Also, I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to the sauce- after those changes, it was fabulous!! I suggest also being choosy with the brand alfredo sauce you buy if dont make your own.

I work for the popular Italian restaurant and the dish I recommend the most, my favorite, is the Chicken Scampi. This recipe is perfect for achieving the same dish at home.

This dish was beautiful to look at, but very bland tasting.  Definitely needs more garlic and spices...maybe also cheese?

This recipe was OK but there was hardly any sauce at all for the amount of noodles it called for.  Next time I'm going to try doubling the sauce.

This was really tasty, I loved it, and ate it for nights to come! :) The chicken was extra tasty. A bit too much pasta and not enough veggie for my taste, but to fix it I needed to buy bigger peppers/onion.

Just a little bland despite all the garlic. I noticed the recipe doesn’t call for any salt or pepper. I would recommend seasoning the chicken before cooking it.  Also, half a pound of pasta is plenty.  A pound seems like it would be overwhelming!

Super simple to make and I used my own Alfredo sauce recipe. One thing I will change in the future is to increase the amount of garlic I use. The family loves garlic and the recipe will definitely improve with double the garlic

I used organic coconut flour instead of all-purpose flour and it gave the chicken a nice texture and natural sweetness.

I made some modification whem i prepared this dish. First, i did not coat my chicken, instead i seasoned it with salt, basil, oregano and pepper and sauteed it olive oil. It came it very tasty and pretty. Second i made my Alfredo sauce from scratch with heavy whipping cream, cream cheese an a hard asiago, Parmesan, mozzarella blend and a little minced garlic. It was a hit!

I made it just as the recipe directs but had  to make the Alfredo sauce as I could not buy any ready made. I found a nice  simple recipe using  Parmesan cheese and cream mixed it in with the rest and I could hardly stop myself from eating the whole lot!

We are eating low carb, so I substituted a package of French Dressing Mix instead of flour,  left out the spaghetti, parsley, garlic, used 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange bell pepper. It was great, and really easy!

Great Recipe, very tasty. But technically it is still Chicken Alfredo with a few added ingredients. Scampi is Italian plural for Scampo , A Norwegian lobster, and was adapted by chefs to identify a dish using Shrimp garlic wine and butter, served alone or with noodles,usually with  fettuccini or thin spaghetti.

This looks good and I will add it to my recipe collection. However, the recipe title is somewhat misleading! Scampi is normally made with butter, garlic, and white wine or chicken broth, and sometimes with a little fresh squeezed lemon juice and/or bread crumbs on top. I think I'd call it Scampi-style Chicken Alfredo or Creamy Chicken Scampi--but whatever the name, it looks very tasty, especially once "doctored-up"! I can never seem to leave a recipe alone, always wind up adding more herbs & spices.

It took me a little over an hour. the chicken deff needs longer than 5 minutes and the vegetables arent soft after 3 minutes. We cooked them for 15 (atleast)

I made a few changes to this recipe. First, for the chicken, I dipped in flour, then milk then put it in the baggie with flour, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, basil salt/pepper. The chicken was the star of the show!  I did not reserve the water and the alfredo turned out just fine. I really liked this recipe and im sure ill make it again. Next time, i will boil the veggies after chopping them to cut out some time to cook them in the skillet. oh, we also seasoned the veggies.

I did not read the other reviews until after I had purchased the ingredients or I might have made the white sauce from scratch. That said, the restaurant version of this used to be my favorite meal there. A couple of years ago we went gluten free, so bye bye scampi. I was able to use this recipe to make a pretty close replica. I did buy Classico 4 cheese alfredo (it's gluten free) and added seasoning to my rice flour mix for the chicken. I also added a tablespoon of butter and 3 large cloves of garlic, as well as subbing the chicken broth for the pasta water. Gluten Free pasta creates an extremely starchy water so I would not have used that regardless. We have 1 tiny serving left. My extremely picky 17 & 12 year olds had seconds. That rarely happens, so I'd say this is a keeper!

Loved this recipe and was a big hit. I think the pasta should be cut in half.I used Classico four cheese pasta which worked very well. I spiced up the chicken to taste while cooking. Next time I'm going to sprinkle some fresh three or four cheese mix over the top before serving.

I've been making this for many years, with just a few minor changes: I add a few sliced mushrooms and some fresh basil; I just sauté the chicken, seasoned with a little salt and pepper, in evoo without the flour; mix together the cooked chicken, cooked vegies and cooked pasta (I usually use penne). I don't see any need to add the pasta water or chicken broth.  Rather than jarred sauce I make my own, a very good one to try is Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce on AR submitted by Dawn Carter.  I don't use the fresh parsley, just a couple of shakes of Italian seasoning.  This turns out really good; add a salad and voila! Dinner is served!

Yes! I made this recipe for a delicious dinner for 12! I used DeCecco Bucatini spaghetti pasta, and cooked it the night before. I also cooked up lots of sweet Italian sausage & sliced mushrooms the night before.  Day of dinner party, sliced half the sausages into
Bite size pieces, which I tossed into the mixture along with the mushrooms...added giant flavor to the dish!  I kept a dozen sausages whole to serve along side the chicken.. It was a bit time consuming to prepare, but an easy one pot dish to Serve when guests arrived! Thank you for this delicious recipe!  We will serve it again...I am sure we will have requests!

Excellent! This is my favorite dish at the chain restaurant that is referenced. This was a really close replica. The next time I make it will go a bit faster now that I have done it once, and I wouldn't change anything. Family wants it added to our regular menu.

The chicken should have a flavor to it prior to mixing it with the rest of the ingridients. Perhaps, when cooking, add a little seasoning to it.

Very good!  There was not quite enough sauce for the angel hair spaghetti, so next time I will use 3/4 lb rather than the full 1 pound.  I added some oregano, lemon thyme, rosemary, and garlic salt to the flour.  I used a full 10 oz can of chicken broth instead of the reserved cooking liquid, and would have added white wine, but didn't have any.  My husband really liked this.

Next time I definitely need some seasoning added to the meal. My family also likes either less noodles or more meat. I felt like there was too many noodles for the chicken. But other than that...it did have a great taste!

I just made this for lunch and it was pretty good. I am only giving three stars because as written, the recipe is quite bland. Add some salt, pepper, garlic powder and chicken stock and it becomes quite tasty.

I really loved this dish. I don't however, use store bought Alfredo Sauce, cause it's nasty. I made "Alfredo Sauce" by Rebecca Swift (on this website) and it turned out great! I didn't change anything else. I do like my Chicken to have a little more flavor, so next time I will add some salt and garlic powder to the flour mixture. And use either thin spaghetti, or angel hair pasta next time.

Awesome recipe! Changed the onion to some shallots, but left everything else alone.  Thanks for the great meal!

This was wonderful!  It was very close to the restaurant style.  I have to admit however, that I did add more water because the sauce was a little thick.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made with some broccoli and my husband and I loved it.  Wasn't a huge hit with the kids though.

This was really flavorful. Cooking the peppers with the sauce added so much more to the taste. Great recipe!

This was great! :) I did half the spaghetti called for, and used a poblano pepper too, to spice it up a little bit more. Friends loved it!

Great starter recipe. I used roasted garlic oil to saute everything, so I added no garlic. I added onion powder, salt, and ground black pepper to the flour, and I added chopped fresh basil and asparagus to the veggies. I boiled my pasta in chicken broth, then tossed the drained pasta with the roasted garlic oil and omitted the alfredo sauce.

I really liked this.  4 stars b/c it needed a little bit more punch.  Next time i will try adding the lemon juice to it...a tad bland...but all my guests absolutely loved it and cleaned their plates.  will make again!

My family loves this dish.  We prepare it for special dinners, but it's good anytime!  It tasts just like my favorite dish at the Olive Garden- Chicken Scampi.
