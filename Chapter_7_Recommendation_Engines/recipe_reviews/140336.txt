Loved these!  I used fresh basil and grape tomatoes from my garden.  Could not find the small mozzarella balls at the store so I got a large marinated ones and cut into squares.  The only time consuming thing is folding the sliced procuitto (mine was very thin).  I used EVOO/balsamic in place of the italian dressing.

these were yummy!  drizzled with olive oil and vinegar dressing, used plain mozzarella balls (lazy of me, i know) and it was delicious.  will definitely make again -- great midnight snack.  thanks for the recipe!

Made these for a wine dinner with friends and they were a great hit. Loved them. I also used the non marianated mozz balls instead, b/c the store didn't have the marinated ones and I didn't have time to marinate them. Definitely going to be added to my appetizer repertoire.

This were a smash as a fresh addition to my appetizer table.  I found longer than usual toothpicks, so I added a kalamata olive to each, as well.  They were a hit!!!  I used some fresh cherry tomatoes, straight out off of the bush, which added such a pleasant taste, as well.

I brought this appetizer to a pig roast BBQ. It really was a hit! I used a round loaf of bread and "stuck" the mini skewers in it. Then I used a round plater, lining the perimeter of the bread with fresh basil leaves. On top of the leaves I alternated tomato mozzarella.

This was beautiful and delicious. I also marinated the mozz balls. I added artichoke and prosciutto to the skewer. I couldn't find the toothpicks, so I used half of a skewer you would use for a kabob. I then stuck them into one large tomato, and decorated the outside of the plate with basil leaves. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I couldn't find cocktail toothpicks but found a little larger wooden ones. To make everything fit, I just cut a bigger slice out of each grape tomato.  I also used a large leaf of basil for each.  I bought small marinated mozz. balls from the deli section at the food market.  Everyone at the party just raved about them.  The only thing I would change is to make more next time, which according to my father-in-law, is the next party!

Instead of prosciutto, I used hard salami (cheaper, and I cut each slice in half and rolled it up) and I marinated my mozzarella balls ahead of time, and left out the basil and italian dressing since the marinade gave a similar flavor. My mozzarella balls were so small, I put two on each toothpick (salami, mozz ball, grape tomato, mozz ball) and after it was all assembled, sprinkled a bit of course kosher salt and cracked pepper. So pretty! Thanks for the recipe!

Extremely popular at parties! Would suggest using only one tomato, since its quite a mouthful!

I did not like this at all. I think it would've been better to use slicing tomatoes and layer the ingredients rather than put them on picks. I suppose it wouldn't be as pretty that way, but, I do think it would taste better!

These were great and a big hit. I couldn't find long cocktail toothpicks so I made my own out of celery. This worked out great and made the whole thing edible. I will definitely be making these again.

This didnt go over so well at Easter. I had over half the plate left. They all opted for the more fattening appetizers. It could just be my family. :/

This was a quick and fresh appetizer I made for a warm afternoon event. I followed the recipe but added a light drizzle of  quality balsamic  vinegar to perk up the flavor.

These turned out great.  I didn't have fresh basil, so sprinkled dried basil on.  I used dressing from the Olive Garden, and only used one tomato because my toothpicks were short.

So easy, so good. Used tomatoes and basil right from garden, and put some italian dressing in container of mozz balls overnight. Only had longer wood skewers so did 2 tomatoes, 2 mozz balls on each. Big hit at party.

These were time intensive but absolutely beautiful.  My extended family gobbled these up when I brought them as an appetizer to a family meal.  I definitely recommend this, and will happily make this as an appetizer or for a tapas-style summer meal.

So good! A party in your mouth! I used only one tomato, I couldn't find long toothpicks and didn't want to go all over to find them. I also marinated my own mozzarella, I had string cheese on hand and the prosciutto about broke the budget. I would absolutely would make these again!!

I marinated the mozzarella balls overnight with the ingredients listed.  I did not use any dressing on top of the finished product.  Flavorful and delicious without additional dressing!

My husband loved this snack!  I leave the prosciutto out and just put the red tomato, green basil leaf, and the white mozzarella, and it is a fabulous snack at Christmas parties!
