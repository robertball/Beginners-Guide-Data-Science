I thought that this was the worst recipe for chicken cacciatore.  I think I'll stick with the tomatoes.  This recipe by far was not quick and easy.

I made this using all thighs, it worked out great.  I served it over pasta and even the person who doesn't like wine or mushrooms asked how I made it.

I liked this recipe... i used only a 1/4 cup of vinegar and i chopped up the bacon and added it to the sauce... i also used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken... it turned out great and was quick to make

This really is a great dish. We really enjoyed it served over rice. The kids enjoyed it as well as my wife's family. I also made it with a homemade jalepeno and cheese french bread.

Very good.  Although it sounded a little different, we enjoyed this very much.  I used slightly less vinegar as someone had suggested.  Next time, I will make more sauce and serve with rice.

I evenly substituted chicken broth for the red wine and used Wish Bone's Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing in place of the balsamic vinegar. I also chopped boneless, skinless chicken breast into one-inch pieces before sauteeing instead of using chicken pieces.  One more thing, fresh mushrooms could have been better but all I had was canned.  Otherwise, we could not imaging this dish being much better than it was.  I served this to my lovingly analytical/critical husband over white rice and he gave it his, "you can make this anytime" review.  I agreed.

I thought this was good, but not your traditional chicken cacciatore. I would prefer to call this a sweet and sour chicken since that is what it really tasted like.  I found the vinegar to be a little overpowering (and I love balsamic) so I added a touch more brown sugar to offset it.

I didn't have red wine so looked in this site's substitution chart and went with fruit juice and vin. I think that was a big mistake. It came out too sweet. My family liked it, though, and I will try it again. (with the wine this time!)

Good stuff.  I added two tomatoes to this(they needed to be used) and cut the Balsamic in half...and I also used red onion (it was what I had on hand).  I served it with couscous (also what I had on hand) and it turned out quite tasty if I do say so myself.  I was just looking for a way to use some left-over wine...this was a good choice.

I found this recipe to be very unique. I have never had anything quite like it. The taste is quite rich and complex. I was really amazing that I had cooked something so interesting. The taste was pretty good for me, although I wasn't really able to eat a lot of it. My boyfried found it to be very good. We substituted boneless chicken thighs since that is what we had in the freezer. A nice recipe and a great excuse to buy a bottle of wine.

This chicen is good but has to much vinegar for my tastes.  I will probably make it again with about 1/2 the vinegar.

I made this recipe and tasted it. The taste from the balsamic vinegar ruined it. I rinsed off the meat and just added some tomatoes to salvage what I could. I had only used half of balsamic vinegar that was called for.

Two sour for the kids, even though I cut the vinegar to about 2/3rd's.  Next time, I would reduce the vinegar to about 1/5th.  The wife liked it.

I liked this recipe but preferred it with the addition of two peeled, seeded tomatos.

I would add more liquid to the recipe as it stands. Maybe add chicken broth to the same amounts of wine and balsamic vinegar. Most of the liquid had boiled off during the 30 minute cooking time, even in a covered pot.

My dad would make this dish however he did not use the brown sugar and used wine vinegar instead This recipe brought back memories. My daughter and I really enjoyed it. My wife did not like it. She likes the more traditional dish (whatever that means). It seems there are many traditional recipes, so I wonder who's correct? Going to make it again.

This was pretty good, but I think I prefer the ones with more of a tomato base. I made this because I had the majority of the ingredients already on hand - the exceptions being an onion (instead used a leek that needing using) and I only had white wine on hand, so used that and a little red wine vinegar in place of a bit of the balsamic. I imagine the sauce would be wonderful over rice.

My mom prepaired this basicly the same way. But she used an old Corning, plug in skillet from the 70's. She put in a bit of spinach & a splah of what ever wine was in the house.

discard the bacon?! What! Lets eat it for breakfast instead! An excellent recipe however I don't prefer the carrots.
