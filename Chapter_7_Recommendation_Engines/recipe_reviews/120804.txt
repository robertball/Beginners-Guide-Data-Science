Great flavors!  I didn't do the glaze because the filling was sweet enough for me.  Used fresh oranges for the peel and juice - made the house smell fantastic!  However, not easy.  I screwed up and didn't separate into two and the dough was too soft; the filling burst out in one spot.  But even with these little oopsies, it still salvaged out great.  A mark of a great flavored recipe!
