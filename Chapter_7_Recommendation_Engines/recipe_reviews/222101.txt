I oversaw my oldest boy making this dish--I didn't give him much advice, other than explain how to make a roux properly because the directions did not explain to brown it before adding the milk and to gradually add the cheese so the sauce does not seize up. He used sharp white cheddar cheese and added a couple shakes Frank's Hot Sauce and four quartered all beef hot dogs, as he wanted to make it a little more personal. The kids and I loved this macaroni and cheese recipe and my son was quite tickled that he was able to make it on his own.

I used fat free milk (2 cups instead of 3 for 4 servings) and skipped the breadcrumbs, and it turned out quite delicious. I added some more paprika, black pepper and tiny bit of chili powder for an extra kick.

This was pretty good, but I think for the calories/fat content you might as well use regular cheese. I find it makes a big difference with the taste and regular cheese melts more easily. A few other things I found:
-definitely make sure to add cheese very gradually into the milk (esp. with low fat cheese)
-don't worry if the cheese sauce comes out runny (it thickens up in the oven)
-some chili powder works well in the sauce
-I'm betting a little sauteed onion would add some great flavor

This recipe is bland.  I added a lot of extra parm cheese which helped.  Also, the recipe says it makes four servings but it actually makes at least 12.

The cheese sauce came out a weird texture and it didn't have a very strong cheese taste

I made this with vegetable elbow macaroni. I did not have any 1% milk available so I substituted nonfat half and half.  I also mixed in a package of  sliced vegetarian frankfurters. I served this to my grand daughter and she really liked it. The vegetarian frankfurters made this a bit salty. Next time I make this I will skip the Parmesan cheese or just skip the frankfurters. I will definitely make this again.

used almond milk instead and halfed the butter with olive oil, a little cheddar and parmesan, broiled each dish in toaster, until breadcrumbs crisped up, perfect!

The cheese was weird from the beginning. When I was melting it, it was like the melted cheese was separating from the milk. And so then it was very liquidy when I poured it onto the mac. I think I would have added more flour maybe. I will definitely try it again though.

I gave this 4 stars because I've had better. However it was pretty good I think what makes the differance is how good the cheese is, how good the noodles are. Fallowing the recipe exactly it comes out great.

this got my 14 year old's stamp of approval.  I added frozen veg (carrots, peas, & green beans) to the pasta water at the last min. 
Simple to cook, plenty of leftovers and my family likes it.

Bland and a bit tasteless. My suggestion is to add sea salt while eating and it turns out perfect. Make sure to drain the macaroni fully before cooking, otherwise it gets a little watery. But, I managed to pull it off with several mistakes, so great overall and yummy with a few adjustments :)

I liked that it used less butter but did not come out well.  Lacked taste and was very watery.

Did this with two (2) boxes of 12oz elbow macaron. Used three (3) cups of cheddar and probably about two (2) cups of parm. Instead of bread crumbs I sprinkled the two cheese's over the top with some salt and pepper. Delicious! Around ten (10) servings.
