Good Flavor.  Thin (1/2" chops) will take 2.5 - 3 mins/side.  Thick cut chops (2+")
will take much more than 5 mins per side-
up to 8 mins/side on med heat.  This will tend to over cook pecan coating.  May need a little more salt to taste.

This recipe is ok. If your chops are thick-
 1 3/4 to 2 inches the crust will burn in the frying pan. I cooked them in the pan for 4 minutes each side, then finished in 350 degree oven ( 12 min).   Definitely increase salt/seasoning.

Loved the combo flavor of pecans with the honey mustard coating. Surprised how tender the pork was.

Delicious!  So moist yet crispy on the outside. I will definitely make this again.
