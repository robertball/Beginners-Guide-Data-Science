Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for, and taste just like the popovers I grew up with! I didn't have a popover tin, so I used a muffin tin, and found that the amount of batter actually made 12 popovers instead of 6.  so i cut the butter down - 1/4 tsp per muffin tin (12) and reduced the baking time slightly - 15 minutes in 425 degree heat and 10 minutes at 325.  They turned out wonderful, very light and very very fluffy. Excellent with some melted honey. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

I couldn't believe it they came out perfect the first time. And, every time since. I always start with the eggs and milk at room temp and when they come out of the oven I pierce the bottom sides a couple of times with a sharp knife to release steam. Keeps the centers from getting soggy.

My popovers turned out HUGE, about 2x bigger than I expected. I followed the recipe exactly and served them with Cinnamon Honey Butter from this site. My only advice is do not wait for your butter to get bubbly, mine never did. After two minutes the butter just burned so I had to wash it out and start over. The popovers alone were a little bland, but amazing with the Cinnamon Honey Butter. Do NOT open the oven until it's time to take them out, not even for a quick peek!

Great and easy popover recipe. My husband DEVOURED these. They all popped beautifully without having to leave the ingredients at room temperature.

***UPDATE*** I have made these several times now and I have found that if I heat the milk in the microwave to feel warm to the touch and set the eggs in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes the popovers pop much higher than using cold or room temperature ingredients. I also use these in a popover pan that makes 12 and I set the oven at 425 for 15 mins and 325 for 10 mins. Comes out perfect every time. Also, make sure you mix the flour in last and make sure it is mixed until there are no lumps left. Good luck!

These were amazing. It has been so long since I had made popovers. I'm not sure why but I feel so foolish for waiting after seeing the ease of this recipe. So no peeking in the oven once they are in. Follow the instructions to a T and while popover tins are wonderful don't be afraid to pull out your muffin tins.

This was really simple and quick! I made it for the kids in a "mini" muffin pan, which actually yielded a tray of 24, plus another 10 muffins! I also added a pinch of brown sugar to each muffin and it gave it a nice bit of sweetness!

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  I have had a hard time finding a good popover recipe (especially one that didn't stick to the popover pan) and this one was perfect.  I will definitely make these again.

Excellent and SO SO SO easy to make!  Grew up in the north and now live in the south and NEVER see popovers anywhere!  I am so thrilled to have found this recipe. My husband and kids absolutely love these.  (I do too!)

The recipe fails to mention that you only fill the pans 1/2 way. Otherwise if you fill to the top, you don't get popovers: you get an oven full of smoke and dripped batter that burns and leaden sponges.

Last night I ate at a high-end restaurant in Philadelphia. They served me a rosemary turnover which was absolutely divine. Today I found myself craving another, so I went to searching AR for a solution! I added about a teaspoon and a half of fresh chopped rosemary, and made them in my muffin pan. I didn't have any trouble with sticking at all, but may I suggest that you use salted butter for a savory popover? I used unsalted per direction, and found the flavor a little flat. The texture was light and airy, and I will be keeping this recipe for certain!!!

My mom used to make popovers for us. I did an experiment with this recipe, based on a popover recipe a friend from England gave me. I put a dallop of mashed potatoes in 3 of them before baking. Actually those "opened up" and looked more like the popovers I grew up with...the others stayed closed and looked like muffins. The taste was good but I am not sure what I did wrong to get the muffin-like appearance. Good base recipe, any good cook has a popover recipe in their file box, IMO! Thanks for the post!

Awesome awesome awesome!!!  Just like my grandmother's!  I'm so pleased.  I'd tried other recipes before and my popovers never "popped" correctly.  I had no custard cups so I ended up working with a muffin tin and 12 perfect little popovers!!  Excellent!

Super easy to make, I also used the muffin pan and reduced the time.  18 minutes at 425 then 12 minutes at 325.  Light fluffy and airy.  I have made these a number of times, one time I melted my 2T of butter, added some mashed roasted garlic and divided that into the cups.  WOW were those amazing.  I am now asked to make them all the time.

After 25 years of trying to make these, this recipe and the attached reviews finally made me get the PERFECT pop-overs.  Usually we make Yorkshire Pudding (either in a pan or in a muffin tin) which is the same basic ingredients, but the English recipe we've been using specifies holding the batter in the fridge before using, and the result is a heavier doughy "pudding" - which is an entirely different beast (and not a bad one).

The secret for "pop" is to have the eggs and milk at room temperature or slightly above.Cold batter and you get "pudding." Make sure to spray the pan and pre-heat to keep them from sticking. We used a combination of beef fat (from a roast) and butter as the cooking oil, filled 1/2 to 3/4 with batter and never opened the oven door (cooking near the top of the oven) at  425 for 15 minutes, 375 for another 20 and they were absolutely perfect, hollow and able to hold gravy!

For those who have never had a pop over before, they kind of taste like a pancake.  It's a dense texture, but spongy.  We ate them with honey and they were awesome.  I didn't have a pop over pan, so I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made them in a muffin tin.  It made 24. Definitely will keep this recipe.

Didn't rise!! I followed the recipe exactly, only I had to use a muffin tin since I have no popover pan. Others said they had done the same, but that it worked anyway. Instead of being light and airy, they turned out like corn muffins, only 3/4 inch high. I'm not sure if the muffin tin was the problem or not!

This recipe is great, but -- and I don't know if this is just because I used a muffin pan instead of a popover pan -- the butter pats in the bottom of the cups prevented them from popping correctly.  I happened to have enough batter for a cup that I hadn't buttered, and that was the only one that turned into a real, light, hollow popover.

These popovers are wonderful plain, but I like to add 1/4 cup of thawed frozen broccoli and 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese. It gets all melty and savory and they are delicious!

This was the most amusing popover recipe I have ever used! The popovers puffed even in my muffin tin, however, some only bubbled on one side, several collapsed and made caves/craters - modern art! All popovers taste the same, but these ones had character! (I think it was the butter.)

I love this recipe! I didn't have unsalted butter so I omitted the salt and used salted butter. It still came out awesome. These are fantastic with butter and honey.

I had never had a popover before. They are interesting. What I didn't like was lack of flavor. I added chives and cheddar cheese the second time I made them and enjoyed them more.

Great popover recipe!  I added 1/4 tsp. of baking powder as this helped them to rise more. I used my mixer to do the batter, filled the popover pans 1/2 full and they raised beautifully. I made a double batch and we ate them ALL. I served these with cinnamon whipped butter. To die for!

Fantastic! Really good. We were trying to recreate popovers from a nearby restaurant and these are actually better - not as greasy. If you use a muffin pan (instead of a popover pan), it will make 11-12 popovers. No fail recipe with delicious results.

This recipe worked PERFECTLY for me. I followed the directions pretty much exactly and finally I got tall, fluffy popovers.

The thing that was different for this recipe (from the other ones that failed for me) was that I mixed the batter with a hand mixer so it was really smooth. Also, I'm guessing pre-heating the pan helped too.

One tip - put a cookie sheet or broiler pan under the popover pan because melted butter will likely spill over and start smoking on the bottom of the oven.

First time ever making popovers.  I do not have a popover pan so I just used a muffin tin.  They turned out beautifully.  I will make these again and again.  Paired with cinnamon honey butter, they are my new obsession.

I love love love popovers! I was slightly disappointed with my popovers. I've made them before using the Stonewall Kitchen package and they always popped, these didn't. I don't know why. They still tasted amazing! I followed the directions, but used room temperature eggs and milk. I also melted the butter and put it in the preheated hot popover pan, that gave me a bubbly butter mix. I followed the rest of the recipe. So, I'm not sure why mine didn't pop....Maybe I didn't mix enough? Or mixed too much? I will deifnitely be trying this again!

This is the same as Yorkshire pudding and can be served with roast beef and gravy on top.  Mmm  DO NOT PEEK IN THE OVEN BEFORE FINISHED.

I tried this yesterday, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome!  They taste just like the popovers at one of my favorite restaurants from years ago.  So simple, yet so incredibly delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

OMG! The best! I have never successfully made yorkshire pudding or popovers, but these turned out incredible!!!! I only had to alter the recipe a little bit to fit what I had on hand. Margarine instead of butter and Homogenized milk instead of regular (because hubby grabbed the wrong one). Dont let the butter bubble, it might not make it, just let it melt. I also added chopped garlic and some Italian seasoning. As well, I used a mini loaf pan instead of a muffin pan. The whole pan was gone in minutes. It was INCREDIBLY tasty.

This recipe was SO easy and SO delicious.  People were eating them before the dinner was even served!  I added some fresh thyme and a clove of minced garlic, and they were a hit!!  I will be making them for many years to come.  One tip, follow the directions EXACTLY with preheating the muffin pans and cooking time.  DO NOT open the oven until they are done baking and you will have an impressive bread to serve with any meal!!

I just tried these for the first time. I took other reviewers advice and warmed the milk a little in the microwave and warmed the eggs in warm water for about 10 minutes. I also used salted butter.  I used the Nordicware Grand popover pan I ordered on Amazon and they came out PERFECT!!!!!!  The amount of batter was perfect for  my 6 popover pan!

What did I do wrong?  After the butter melted I put the batter on top then put it in the oven.  All that happened was SMOKE and the popovers crusted up and burned with the butter.  Had to turn off the oven after 15 minutes because we couldn't breathe

Good popover recipe. They were a hit. I followed directions and found them to be a bit overcooked   on the outside but the interior was perfect.  I would probably turn down the temp  to 375 next time as another reviewer recommended.

Excellent recipe.  I used silicon muffin cups.  The first six didn't "pop".  On the second six I turned the heat down to 375 instead of 325 and they were very good!

****  This recipe is fantastic and makes wonderfully airy popovers that are not doughy or heavy.  I substituted 1/4 tsp of oil in each cup instead of butter and it worked perfectly.

Followed this recipe to the T. They didn't pop and were dense, not eggy and light. They turned out like corn muffins minus the cornmeal. I would never try this recipe again.

This is a great recipe. I did a few things differently because this was my first time making popovers. My inadvertent changes seemed to work in my favor. I added and mixed up the wet ingredients first, then added the dry. My oven tends to run hot, so I lowered the first prescribed oven temp to 400, and the second temp to 300. I also decreased the second portion of cooking time from 15 minutes to 7. If I hadn't done this, they would have burned. I suggest keeping a close eye on them until you figure out what works for you. I don't know if they came out the way they were supposed to, but my husband LOVES these and his surrogate mother used to make them for him when he was little, so I had high expectations to live up to!! Don't be afraid of this recipe. It's super easy!!

Super easy to make.  Popovers were light and flaky.  I served them with honey butter.

Wow, I tried a different popover recipe on this site and gave it a 4, but if that was a 4 than this one is an 8 because they were twice as good. I will be ditching the other recipe. These turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe to the letter.

Triple five star. Will try to upload a photo but these  popovers looked like they  were on steroids! Haven'tt  read the other reviews but I  imagine maybe the extra egg helps? Yes they are a bit  "eggier"  than  usual but not enough to make them taste bad.  Really quite good and the  extra butter sure  helps with  the flavor. Don't skip it.  Live a  little.

Perfect! I love this recipe. Easy and delicious! Made them to go with a traditional roast dinner and they were a huge hit! Much easier and better than the William Sonoma recipe I have been using that was included with my popover pan. I wonder if one could use beef drippings instead of butter in the popover pan for more of a "Yorkshire pudding" popover..or should the beef drippings replace the butter in the batter? or leave the recipe as is....Any thoughts???

Haven't made popovers in years and gave it try for some Bostonian company.  We all enjoyed them.  Will try the recipe again and add vanilla and cinnamon for a breakfast treat.

Excellent!  I've made a similar recipe for years, but I have to say that these puffed up much better.   And, the butter in the bottom of the tin was a neat idea.  Great flavor and super simple!

I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A NO FAIL RECIPE FOR TRADITIONAL POPOVERS AND THIS ONE FILLS THE BILL.  EASY PREPARATION, AND A SNAP TO PUT TOGETHER.  MY SEARCH IS OVER.  FOR ADDED FLAVOR, TRY ADDING SOME DRIED ONION (OR FRESH, GRATED), OR GARLIC TO THE BATTER.  YUMMY!!

Came out perfect! Lovely high pop! Right amount of crisp and flake. I have been baking popovers for many years. I have mostly used the recipe that came with the Chicago Popover Pan. It’s a hit or miss how well they pop. Best batch I ever made with that recipe was when I forget to set the timer and overcooked them! Thus, I searched for tips and recipes. This one is very similar to the Chicago Popover recipe except the ingredient amounts varied slightly and it calls for higher oven temps. I have to substitute the milk for soy milk and the butter for vegan butter due to my son’s dairy allergy. I knew to use room temperature eggs and soy milk. I have found slightly warmer than room temp even better. I followed one reviewer's advice to mix in the flour last. That seems to be a good trick. And did not open the over door. The popovers rose very high and tasted great. Just like the restaurant “Popovers” on Manhattan’s UWS. They used to have lines around the block but unfortunately they have closed after 30 years.

What a great recipe find! I followed the recipe as directed and they came out great. I will definitely add this one to my recipe database. When I made them the second time I made some changes, I added two tablespoons of sugar and a little bit of vanilla and they were awesome! It added that extra that some said was missing. Keep in mind, popovers are bland, the taste reminds me of french toast batter. It really is all about personal preference. The addition of the vanilla and sugar to the recipe made them so tasty on their own. The original recipe is just as great and I highly recommend the cinnamon honey butter to complement as was suggested.

Excellent.  Reminds me of popovers I used to have on vacation on the Cape.  One suggestion; bring the eggs and milk to room temperature first, otherwise follow recipe exactly.

Great recipe. I've made these numerous times now using my popover pan and they always turn out delicious. Light, airy, and crispy. Just don't overwork the batter, it can get chewy if you do.

My family is gluten-free.  I used a combination of GF all purpose flour and sweet rice flour (the sweet rice flour gives a lightness to the popover) and I used half and half instead of milk.  They came out amazing.  A little dense (maybe more like a Yorkshire pudding?), but we fought over the last one (I won).

Doubled recipe, made it in regular muffin tins, and recipe made 16 popovers. Second batch came out better because i did not open door. Just great with butter and fruit preserve. This is a keeper.

First time to ever make Popeyes and they turned out great.  I made warm sautéed peaches in butter and sugar with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to go with his... I would like to add some garlic powder and cheddar cheese and make savory.

Excellent! 5 stars. Only change I made (third time around) was to bake at 350 to get higher "Puff" and a bit more chrunch. Another thing to consider is to allow all ingredients to come to room temperature before baking and keep that pan hot!

Just out of the oven and these are by far the best popovers I have ever made. I used my muffin pan and it made more than enough batter for 12 popovers. With the combination of non stick spay and butter, they did not stick as the always have in other recipes. They all popped and rose up beautifully. With other recipes I have used, it has been hit or miss.

YUMMM!! I didn't have unsalted butter; I only had regular butter on hand so I left out the salt. I think my oven runs too hot; they were done after the first 20 minutes (any longer they would have been charcoal).  These were soooo good!  Thank you for sharing!  Ohmigosh.  I want more...

Perfect popovers!  They rose and stayed without collapsing. I have tried almost every combination of ingredients, temperature, time and resting. I mixed the ingredients early in the day and refrigerated the batter, then let come to room temperature before baking.  After the first 20 minutes, I baked for 15 minutes at the lower temperature then turned off the oven and left them for another 5 minutes.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  I did read that the ingredients should be room temperature, so I made sure the milk and eggs were taken out and warmed first.  They were quick to mix and were absolutely delicious...I can't wait to make some more and try putting cheese in.

This is a great recipe, but i mistakenly put the butter in the preheated pans and put the batter on it w/o first melting the butter and it came out fantastic! i thought i had blown it, but no! all good.

Very good, light and airy!  I used muffin papers and greased them well, they did not stick.  The popovers themselves are a bit bland, but with any addition- brown sugar and butter, honey, garlic butter- they come alive and are great.

These are super easy to make and taste awesome. I had never heard of them before a couple weeks ago when I saw them made on tv. I was wanting something new to eat today so I looked up this recipe. It took my oven less time than said in this recipe though so I would watch them threw your ovens window. I used a normal muffin pan and they popped just fine. I ate them with some honey butter and it was a perfect match. :D

Easy and delicious!  They cook long enough at a high enough temperature that even some egg allergies don't have a problem with them.  My picky eaters, 4 & 6 years old, each ate 3 of them when made in a cupcake pan (they are smaller than from a popover pan)

So easy, but the batter made way more than 6. I could have done 12 but I filled 9 of the pan's cups almost full.  They puffed up really big and made a great presentation at Christmas dinner yesterday. I will use this recipe again.

Turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I used a muffin tin.  I had better luck with these popovers than any other recipes I have attempted.  Saved recipe and will be making again.  thanks!

PLEASE - Be sure to sift the flour before adding it to the mix. If you do not sift flour, you end up with more than the recipe calls for. 

I tried many times to just measure the flour straight into the mix. They just get too heavy and don't "pop".

Sift, sift, sift!

This is a great recipe and I’ve made a couple times. But you cannot make it ahead and then put back in the fridge. I did this in Thanksgiving in order to save some time but the popovers were very dense. They were still good but not what you’d expect.

These came out AMAZINGLY well! I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made them and they actually popped just like they're supposed to. I used a muffin tin, and there was just enough batter for eight popovers. I will definitely make them again, most likely multiple times.

I followed the recipe exactly as I believe you should before making any changes.
The recipe is buttery, light and very flavorful.Even at high altitude, which I was worried about. However, I think next time I will add a tablespoon of sugar as I feel this will not only enhance the flavor, but the texture as well.
I will try Yorkshire pudding next

I’ve used this recipe quite a few times and love it! I will say, I don’t think warming up the tin or adding butter to the bottom is necessary. I use vegetable spray and that does the trick. I tried to swap regular flour for gluten free flour today and it is NOT the same. They turned out almost muffin like without the gluten. Still love this recipe though, just not for when I need to accommodate allergies.

Spectacular!  I doubled the recipe and used 12 popover tins.  Have all ingredients (except melted butter) at room temperature.  I let the batter sit for an hour or so before I baked them.  I also used avocado oil in the pans instead of butter since it has a higher flash point and the oven temperature is so high.  The exteriors were perfectly browned and these were at least 4” high!

These turned out perfectly! Light, crispy and airy! Like other commenters, I used a muffin tin. It made 12 and they turned out great. It reduces the cooking time to 15 minutes at 425 and 10 minutes at 325. I make these often!

Excellence recipe! These were so delicious and turned out perfectly. I don't have a popover pan so I used a muffin tin which worked great and the recipe was the perfect amount for 12. I used salted butter because that's what I had on hand. Next time I will decrease the salt in the recipe by a smidge when using salted butter. We have eaten these with roast beef and gravy (similar to Yorkshire Pudding) and also for dessert with whipped cream like a cream puff. Wow!! What a special treat!!

Wonderful! Best popover recipe I've tried to date. Bringing the ingredients to room temp (or even warmer) is an absolute MUST to get that nice rise. Also don't open the oven door. I pierced the bottom of each once they were out so they didn't get soggy on the inside.

Mine did not "Pop" very much and were a bit too dense.  I followed the directions exactly.  They were a bit too dense.  Perhaps I filled the cups a bit too much so I will try that adjustment for the next time. Any other thoughts would be appreciated.  I will retry till I get it right.

Very good, HOWEVER DOES NOT NEED FULL COOKING TIME. Just the time on high and then a few minutes on the lower temperature. Also does not need the chunks of butter, just the melted. Nice easy recipe that tastes wonderful with soup

I reduced the recipe to make 2 popovers. They came out perfect. I used salted butter and Italian dipping spices.  They were delicious!

This is the BEST popover recipe that I've tried. I used popover tins and they raised about 3 INCHES above the top of the cups.  I made sure the eggs were room temp and the milk was JUST PAST room temp. I put the flour in last to mix., making sure all lumps were out. The oven was 425 for 15 min. and 325 for 10 min. They came out light and airy. The recipe made 6 good sized muffins. Excellent with Roast Beef/gravy!
This is definitely my  "go to" recipe!

I’ve made these pretty much exactly as written, minus the dedicated popover pan, about a dozen times. Easy, tasty, will definitely keep making them. Only issue is sometimes they get too dark, but could be my oven. Usually just cook for less time than indicated. Last night, I made a change to the process. Instead of starting high and dropping the temperature midway, I heated the oven to 400 and baked for 30 minutes straight. Worked beautifully!  Did fall a little easier, but that didn’t matter to me. Have made these in 12 cup muffin tins and 6 cup, as well as a rectangular brownie pan—key is to fill the well halfway no matter the size.

We make these quite frequently.  Room temp eggs and milk and the popover pan works great every time.  I dont use butter in the pan, but rather spray the cups with pam spray and it works great.  I forgot the pam once and they turned out weird on the bottom, but the tops were still perfectly good.  Great breakfast treat wit a little honey butter!

They came out ok.  Never made them before but was asked to make them for a dinner party.  Everyone liked them and they came out as expected.  Not my favorite thing, kind of blah in my opinion.

Mine didn’t rise. :( I have the hardest time with making popovers. Sometimes they work sometimes they don’t. This was a different recipe but still didn’t rise and I followed the recipe to the tea. I even let the milk and eggs get to room temp before mixing.

Whoops!  I forgot to add the melted butter to my mix and it turned out just fine!  So, if you want to cut a few calories or some fat, it will work out.   Another hint - make sure everything is warm before you start mixing the ingredients - even the eggs.  You can warm them by placing the egg in the shell in a bowl of warm water for 15 minutes before cracking them.  This will give you great pop to your popovers every time!

425 was way too hot to start with.  When I do it again, I will start at 400.  Also used muffin tin and the results were good.  Room temperature ingredients and heated pan are key.

Made these and they turned out great.  I made the mistake of doubling the batter.  That was enough to make almost 2 dozing in a regular muffin pan.  The 2nd batch definitely rose higher since the pan was hotter than the 1st and the better was able to come closer to room temperature.  Also, if you use a non-stick pan, there is no reason to use cooking spray as mine just got black when I preheated the pan.  There was also enough butter remaining in the pan for the 2nd batch that I did not have to butter it again.
I will try a chicken pot pie with this recipe as the crust.

Popovers are a special holiday treat for our family. I tried this recipe for Easter and found them to be especially delightful. I was in a rush and misread the recipe. I put a pad of butter into the bottom of each cup and then poured the batter over it. The result was popovers with a sweet buttery flavor and a hint of salt. I can't wait to make them again.

This Is the BEST popover recipe EVER. My grandma made AMAZING popovers when my Dad was a kid and he says that these are better than hers. It has become an annual thing in my house for me to make popovers  every Saturday morning. The are light, fluffy, and DELICIOUS! Also for the people who say that they do not have any flavor, popovers are not supposed to have flavor. That is why you put butter and jam in them. duh. And for the people that said that they leaked all over your oven, well, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO USE A POPOVER PAN!!!!! THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POPOVER PAN AND A CUPCAKE PAN!!!!!  SO IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A POPOVER PAN, OH WELL GET ONE!!!!

This turned out fantastic.  The only thing I changed was omitting the step of lowering the oven temp, and putting it back in the oven after the first 20 minutes.  Not sure what that's about, but the popovers were perfectly browned and appropriately crispy on the outside after the 20 minutes at 425 degrees F.

Lovely popover recipe! I used only 2 large eggs and added a tablespoon of oil . The batter rested  several hours in the fridge before baking. Very important to really heat the muffin tins before adding the cold batter.

Great recipe. It was my first time making  them and they turned out good. I have nothing to reference them by since I've never had popovers before, but they tasted great. I used a muffin pan and reduced the time slightly like another reviewer said.

I followed this recipe twice and they were delicious. I whipped some butter with honey and cinnamon and spread over the popovers straight out of the oven. If they are warmed up they are still good but not quite as well as fresh out the oven.

I loved these! I was a little nervous at first, since everyone says how hard popovers are to get them right, but these were so easy and delicious. My family loved them, especially with some butter and cinnamon & sugar on top. I will be making these again!

Excellent. Crispy crust, light and flaky inside. I spice it up a little by adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to the batter and sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top.  I've made it several times with success. Let your eggs and milk come to room temperature for a guaranteed rise.

I am a retired person over the age of 60 and this is the first time I've dared to make popovers. This recipe was perfect and these popovers were easy to make and sooo delicious.  Will definitely use my popover pan again and again to make these wonderful additions to any meal. One thing though, it made 12 instead of 6 so if I had filled my tins any more they would have spilled over and would have made quite a mess.

Yes!!!! This is my mother's recipe that she made when I was a child over 40 years ago.  You must use whole milk and real butter. I have tried this recipe with 2% milk and margarine and they did not rise properly because these products do not have the proper fat levels. You must use whole milk and real butter and these popovers will be humongous.  My sister and I have searched for years to find the popover recipe that my mother used when we were children and this is it. A very important part of this recipe is putting the butter in your cups in the oven before you put the batter in the cups to cook. I can bake these in glass custard cups on top of a cookie sheet.  I grease my custard cups with Pam cooking spray.    However I remember Mom using Crisco and hers rose even higher than mine. Mine were over 5" high.

I changed the recipe to 4 servings (using 2 eggs) and used small muffin pans and reduced the cooking time(it made 12 muffins). I followed other recomendations to warm the milk and put the eggs in warm water first. They turned out so fluffy! Great with honey butter.

Tastes delicious, had to edit the recipe though. I made mine in a cupcake tin and found I had to reduce the bake time to about 18 minutes total in order to not burn them. (they were quite brown already and my oven runs a little hot). They turned out a little more like bowls than muffin-shaped, but still tasty!

This was so easy and good.  I was a little short on milk and ended up using some of my vanilla creamer.  What a pleasent surprise it added a hint of sweet!  I also used a muffin tin and it turned out just fine.  My kids can't wait for me to make them again.

I've made this recipe multiple times and always turns out. I do reduce the butter that I melt in the popover pans just a bit so that it doesn't run over and smoke up the house.

I decided to use this recipe which is close to the one I've made over the years.  I wanted to see how it was to add butter to the batter and to the popover cups, too.  Well, they were a huge hit!  They turned out perfectly.  The one thing I did that is not written into these instructions is to let the batter sit at room temperature for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  After turning down the heat, they didn't require the whole time of baking---only about ten minutes more.  I would make these again!  Thanks, J Miller!

Great recipe! I was apprehensive to try it because it was different than the recipe on the back of my new popover pan-but these were so easy and delish! I took Amy T.'s advice and warmed the milk and eggs first, served them with honey cinnamon butter....Wow!

These popovers came out beautiful!!! I adjusted the recipe a little, I used 1 & 1/4 teaspoon of salt, warm the milk & run hot water over the eggs before cracking them. The results are amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly & they came out perfect! I bought a popover pan from Target since I was worried the muffin pans weren't deep enough.
Definitely going to use this as a basic recipe and make some tweaks to add some flavors.

This recipe was amazing! My family used to make popovers when I was younger and I haven't had them in over 20 years. After my wife gave me a popover pan for Christmas, I decided to pull the trigger and make a batch.  The only change I made to the recipe was using salted butter because I didn't have unsalted - and I'm glad that I did.  I pulled them out of the oven after 15 minutes at 325.  They were moist inside and flakey outside.  PERFECT!

I watch Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Cooking Channel.  One of the segments had a restaurant that was known for their popvers.  After I saw that I just had to buy myself a popover pan to make them.  I followed the recipe exactly, warmed my milk and eggs and they came out perfect!  Next time will try adding some cheese or perhaps cinnamon as one person suggested on here.  Delicious!!!

I just made these for Thanksgiving, and they were a big hit!  I did a "trial run" a few days before and found that it helped to put about half the amount of chilled butter in each cup.  I also added about a tablespoon of honey to the melted butter for a little bit of sweetness.

I made these exactly as written except I reduced the time a bit as my oven runs hot. These were crispy outside and tender and eggy inside. Just perfect with butter along side beef stew. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I had tried to replicate my mom's recipe, I remembered most of it, but this was very close and happily the tasty and "pop-overness" was just right. The only thing I did differently (and according to Mom's recipe) was bake them at 425 for 25 minutes.

I was very happy with these :) It makes sense that they would taste like egg as its one of the predominate ingredients, so expect it to taste like egg! Its a mix between scrambled egg and butter biscuits, they go well with jam, I wouldn't like it much if they were not eaten with a spread of some kind.

INCREDIBLE and easy!  I have made these things about 2 million times, and every single time they come out perfect!  BUT you must make sure you're using a pop over pan, otherwise using a muffin tin will get you hockey pucks!

Love these popovers. They are very light and airy with a crispy outer texture. This is an very easy treat to make. And it is fun to watch them cook. I can't wait to make this with my grandchild.

They POPPED. This sounds obvious, but I've tried several recipes and this one was magnificent. They were a bit overzealous with the popping, but I prefer to much pop than too little.

Very easy and very good!  It was my first time making these and followed the directions exactly... they turned out great.  I did not have a popover pan, so I used my muffin pan, alternating every-other so that there was good heat flow around them.  I filled the muffin cup FULL and this made 8 popovers.  I served them with homemade chicken noodle soup, but I would highly reccomend them for a brunch.

All the adults loved this recipe and the kids didn't. Kids said it tasted eggy. Adults ate their leftovers! My father-in-law, who was a professional baker, loved them.

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out yummy and light! The batter did make about 10 popovers in a popover pan. And the extra butter I put in the cups spilled over into my oven! :O  A lot of clean up, next time I will try with just cooking spray.

this was my first cooking experiment. i didnt have cooking spray so i put a little butter around the cupcake tin. the mix made 10 popovers. this was really simple and came out perfect. i never had them before so when i tried them i was pleased. i think next time i will add a little cinnamon to the mix.

These are amazing! I am eating one as I type, and they are fantastic! I used a muffin pan and changed the times to 15 and 8 minutes. Great with cheez whiz, jam, or honey!

The popovers burned on the top and were uncooked in the middle!

These are really yummy with preserves and whipped cream or even a bit of cream cheese.  I didn't have the right pan so I made them in a mini muffin pan and those were the perfect size for an hors d'ouevre or a tea party.

I could not stand these.  You can actually taste the eggs in them when they are cooked, and I can't stand eggs.  They were not for me.
