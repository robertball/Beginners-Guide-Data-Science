Very good pie. Unique and yummy, I love rhubarb so I would have added more and left out more blueberries, but we all enjoyed at my house!!

We enjoyed this very much, had a nice sweet-tart flavor.  Strangely, I noticed the flavor of the raspberries and couldn't really taste the other fruits.  Next time, I would add a little more of all 3 fruits, it wasn't a very full pie.  I didn't bother to lattice the top, just put a solid crust, sealed it, and cut three little slits on top to let out steam.
