So good. I grilled my sandwich cause I like it that way. I've had these ingredients in a quisadilla before and loved it so I thought I would try this sandwich. 4 stars regular but 5 stars grilled. You can also use chicken

Wow!  This was pretty fantastic!  I just sauteed my onions on LOW for about 20 minutes adding a little sugar and salt.  I also broiled mine with the cheese on top to get it melty.  I am definitely making this one for my husband really soon, he'd love it!  Thanks!
