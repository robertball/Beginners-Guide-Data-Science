A friend's mother used to make this years ago but wouldn't share the recipe.  I have looked since then for the recipe and never found one exactly like it until now!  This is it and it is wonderful!  The first time I made it I didn't let the pudding thicken enough but it still tasted great!!

This pudding was a huge success at a gathering at my house. Some asked for the recipe. The only thing I did different was I had to cook the sauce 20-25 min.for it to get thick.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone couldn't get enough!! 
I had to cook the pudding on the stovetop for a lot longer than the 12 mins.  It took about 20, but it was perfect.

This is my fondest childhood food memory.  My grandmother made it, and I loved it.  This is just like hers.  Not too sweet. Although I made it as the recipe says, I will modify that next time.  I will make less graham cracker crust, and I will add 1 Tab of flour to the corn starch.  Thanks for the memories!

I made this while in a rush which was not a good idea. Didn't cook the pudding for quite long enough on the stove so it was pretty goopy but tasted very good. The graham crust was delicious - I plan on using it with other fillings. The topping turned out rubbery for me but again I was rushing and may not have beaten the egg whites long enough. Next time I would skip that and just put the remaining crumbs directly on top of the pudding. The flavour was subtle and sweet - good desert for a heave meal.

It turned out very good. I really like the middle layer. It is nice and gooey. It did take a while to make, but the result is worth it.

Like other reviewers, it took me about 20 minutes for the pudding to thicken.  It was not worth the effort.  Their was no real flavor other than a little sweetness and I think the graham cracker topping is what kept the meringue from being stiff and turning out chewy.  It was so bland no one finished desert; not even the 5 year old.

We thought this was horrible.  Something about the egg whites made the topping rubbery.  My first negative recipe experience at allrecipes.

This recipe was alright.  Wasn't something to WOW about . . . but good.  It is best served at room temperature.  My husband and I ate it while it was still hot and it was WWWAAAYYY to sweet.
