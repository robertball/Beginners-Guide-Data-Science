The cook times are way off on this recipe. It had a very onion taste and was just not good. Sorry! It took a lot longer to cook than indicated and it was too late to make something new. I wouldn't even waste my time modifing.

Really really tasty! Cook times were a little off as the other reviewer mentioned but pretty easy to figure out. Chicken had great flavor.

This was actually pretty good. And as the other's said a little onion-y but nothing that couldn't be fixed.

I read some of the other reviews and scaled down the cooking time greatly for the chicken and the chicken still turned out kind of dry. The flavor of the chicken seemed a little muted. However the cheesy potatoes and onions produced at the end were dynamite. I used about half of the onion suggested and made sure to get really good carmelization on them and it was so tasty. I may simply omit the chicken next time and make the potatoes all on their own.
