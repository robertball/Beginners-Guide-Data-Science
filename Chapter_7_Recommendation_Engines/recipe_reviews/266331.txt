This recipe was great!  With the flavors of the smoke (I used maple wood) pairing well with the buttery, cinnamon and bourbon flavors, it provided a delicious taste that was enjoyed by everyone.   This is a great alternative to the corn and plain butter that gets repeated all summer long at barbecues.  This is going to be a new summer staple for my parties.  I will be having this again!
