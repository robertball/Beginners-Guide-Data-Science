Great recipe!  I fixed this as part of a buffet for a Superbowl party, and it looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful.  (Sadly, I can only assume it tasted wonderful because everyone raved about how good it was... but by the time I finished in the kitchen and got my plate - it was already gone, so I only got a few little scraps!)  For ease of preparation, I fixed a fruit salad with it, and used the drained juice from the canned pineapple, and substituted 1/3 cup of orange juice because I forgot to buy an orange.  It was much easier to make than other recipes I have used - yet tasted like it had taken a ton of effort.  I normally use more complex recipes from the major cooking magazines that can require dozens of spices and ingredients, as I love to experiment with flavors and love gourmet food, so I was leary of how simple this was... but with a very limited budget and limited prep time for this party, I decided to try this one - and was VERY pleased.  It looked delicious on the table, and it was the first to disappear on the buffet - I will be throwing away my other ham recipes, and sticking with this one.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was an absolute HIT!! I do not eat Ham but I fed this to about 10 diffrent people and they All said it was fantstic! Instead of cooking it they way they did I made the glaze, put the ham and glaze in a bag, shook it up reall good and baked it in the bag for about 3hrs. Alot easier then basting every 10 min.s.

This was wonderful, I will be using this glaze on my ham from now on. I added pineapple rings and cherry's for the last 30 minutes and brushed the glaze over them, it candied and made for a wonderful garnish. Wonderful flavor.

I put the ham in a roaster pan and poured 1 cup of water inside the pan as the ham instructions stated. It also said to cover the ham with foil, so I covered it with foil ONLY for 1st  hour but I won't be doing that again because the outside of the ham started to get crispy too soon, so next time I'll cover the ham in the last 35mins of baking instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated and was quite satisfied with the results. I think I'm going to add 1 1/2 - 2cups of water inside the roasting pan because that water gets the ham moist and it serves as a "dip" when you glaze the ham. Any glaze that falls down to the bottom of the pan, falls into that water and it is delicious! Once the ham is done and you are ready to serve the ham slices, dip the slices of ham into that glazed water mixture at the bottom of the pan. It makes the ham so moist and you get to taste the glaze a bit more.

Excellent!  My only variation of the recipe was that I spiked the ham with whole cloves and so I left out the ground cloves.  From now on I will always use this recipe for my holiday hams.

This recipe is just incredible!  I have gotten so many compliments.... my husband even volunteered me to make this for his work party at Christmas!  The first time I made it I stuck exactly to the recipe and it was very good.  I made some changes the last time because of the ingredients I had on hand, and it still came out wonderfully.  I added more pineapple juice and used both golden and dark brown sugars.  I also added some cinnamon, onion and garlic powder.  Don't be afraid to play with this recipe...  it's very versatile!

I used an inexpensive 8 lb ham & trimmed off any really thick areas of fat. Diamond scored the outside. Placed the ham cut side down in a heavy disposable roasting pan with 1/2 bottle of Honey Brown Ale. Studded the ham with whole cloves vs using ground in glaze. Used 1/4 C real maple syrup vs honey & reduced brn sugar by 1/4C. I used orange juice (I had orange zest on hand) & reduced glaze down a bit longer. I heavily brushed glaze on initially prior to my tradition of toothpicking fresh pineapple rings on. Loosely tented ham w/foil for 1st 2 hours @300 degrees. Uncovered, then 'spooned' glaze on every 15 minutes for another hour at 325. The BEST ham and my company thought it was DELICIOUS! Moist, tender and using an electric knife makes slicing a breeze. Spiral sliced ham won't be going in my cart again, LOL. I didn't deviate too much from recipe and it's so easy. Tip: You can bake ham earlier in day, let it rest (loosely covered) for 30 minutes. At this point I slice & pile on oven safe platter, spoon on some drippings, cover tightly and re-heat about 15 minutes before serving. Makes my life in the kitchen easier with the sides, etc. needing the oven space...just a mention :)

Very yummy! I made this for a surprise 50th birthday party and got many compliments! I used light brown sugar (didn't have dark on hand) and wrapped the ham in foil while baking so it didn't dry out. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated. This is a great and easy recipe!

Excellent recipe Elisa! Like others suggested, I doubled the glaze, but kept the cloves at a minimum. I had no trouble with the glaze burning on the bottom of the pan, but maybe that was because the instructions on my spiral ham suggested it be cooked at 250 degrees. I ended up adding cornstarch/water to the rest which made a delicious sauce. Thank you so much and no more packets for me!

Think like Austin Powers...YEAH BABY, YEAH!  This is very tasty.  My husband started the ham while the kids & I went to the mall & as innocently funny as it is, he put the ham in my Corning Ware quiche pan (ya gotta love him, as he really doesn't know any better), so needless to say I was verrry careful basting this one.  It turned out great!  I only had light brown sugar & used pineapple-orange juice (left over from new years eve Mai Tai's, because someone ate the orange).  I was really on to the clove taste, so maybe I'll use less next time (maybe I'm not a fan?).  Good recipe Sue, we will use it again ;)

Seeing how I've made this ham several times I figuered I'd better give it the great rating it deserves.  I ensure the temp is 325ºF or less and I gently cover the the ham (not the entire pan) with a piece of foil to prevent the edges from over cooking.  I double the sauce, baste frequently for the last 45 minutes and serve the remaining glaze on the side.  This is a no-fail recipe and today for the first time I switched out the honey for pure maple syrup and it got rave reviews all the way around.   Thanks for sharing!

I didn't care too much for this. The orange flavor was too overpowering and I didn't even use the full amount! If I were to make it again, I'd probably just leave out the zest and only use the orange juice. I might also cut back on the dijon mustard - maybe 1 tbsp instead of 2.

Made per the recipe, with one addition.  I also studded the ham with whole cloves.  Not too many cloves, but I am glad I did because it helped bring a little bit more of the clove flavor to the meat. Definitely a recipe to use in the future!

This was the best ham I've eaten in a very long time.  I made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  Then for an added touch, I kept the ham bone, making sure it had some meat on it.  Then I got the 10 Bean Soup mix, threw away the mix packet (Don't need it.) and soaked the beans overnight.  Then I washed them the next day, threw them into a large pot, added 8 cups of water and the ham bone, plus extra ham, skin and some ham fat.  Simmered it for about a good 3 hours and made a pot of really good bean and ham soup. It thickens as it cooks. Then once it's done, I took out the leftover fat and obviously the bone. (I guess you could give the bone to the dog?) You can add celery, peas, onions, spices, whatever you want.  I just used water, beans and the ham and yum, yum!! The water soaks up all those fruit juices and brown sugar that's left on the meat and bone.  Thanks, Sue, for a wonder and newly traditional Christmas meal. I will make this next year for Christmas or maybe earlier and of course, my bean soup. :)

this is very close to my recipe but just enough diffrence that I thought I would try it. First time -- not enough sauce for ham and family did not like the cloves in the sauce. Second time I doubled the sauce omitting the crushed cloves. I also coved the top of the ham with tin foil and kind of "tent-ed" it so that it would not touch the ham. I made one small hole to vent it just slightly. I scored my ham and placed whole cloves in the ham. I cooked on 200 degrees and cooked for a longer time. I basted the ham once an hour and half way through I put pineapple rings and cherries on it and basted more.  When I felt like the ham was done I sat the pan on my counter to let the ham rest and juices to come back so would be moist and I basted it very well one more time, covered and left alone until it was time to slice and put on the table. It turned out very well glazed, moist, and delicious.  My family liked it better this time around. Oh, you pull out the whole cloves and discard them. The sauce was just right --not too thin and not to thick. Yummy!

Had a 8 pound not cooked ham and wasn't sure when to start basting so started after it had cooked for 2 hours.  Delicious. Husband thought the gravy was too sweet though but he's not a ham person.

OH YUM!!!  I have used this glaze a lot, and every time, EXCELLENT!  The ham remains very juicy and oh so sweet.  I put pineapple rings all over the ham before I start baking it, and maraschino cherries in the middle of those rings.  Then start to glaze 45 minutes before it's done.  Sooooo tasty!  Also, don't forget that when you cover the ham with tinfoil, tent it so it doesn't lay against the ham, keeps it even juicier!  Thanks for sharing Sue!!!

This was a delicious glaze.
Instead of brushing on the glaze last, I just dumped the entire glaze mixture onto the ham and into a baking bag with the ham. I tossed in some pineapple slices too.Then I cooked it at 325 for 2 hrs. The 6 lb ham I used turned out moist and delicious!

Very good!  Due to what was on hand and personal preference I used a mixture of dk. and lt. brown sugar, 1/3 c. prepared orange juice, regular mustard and no cloves.  Put pineapples and cherries on with first application of glaze and basted them with glaze for 2 more applications and one additional basting with pan drippiings/glaze mixture, which was also delicious served on the side as is.  I did tent the ham after first hour and cooked 2 1/2 hours total prior to adding glaze.  Much enjoyed by all.

Been improvising this glaze for years. Stud the ham with cloves after cutting diagonal pattern on top. Decorated with pineapples as shown. Did not have Dijon mustard, so used brown mustard. Also tasty.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I bought a spiral sliced ham that had the glaze packet and tossed the packet.  This glaze recipe is SO good.  I didn't have an orange so just used 1/3 cup orange juice.  Also, I reduced the oven temp, according to the directions on the ham I purchased, to 300.  I shortened the total cooking time by about 1/2 hour so it wouldn't dry out.  The result was beautiful!  Update:  I did this again for Christmas Eve this year.  I wrapped the ham in foil and poured the glaze over the ham.  This is THE BEST glaze. No need to look further.

This is an awesome recipe- my friends have gone nuts over the glaze.  I just make a couple tweaks to it- I'm not much a fan of cloves, so I leave them out.  Also, if you just include a little orange zest, and leave out the juice, it's perfect for those who think an orange flavor is a little overwhelming (like me).

My first time cooking a ham. Followed the recipe as is and turned out GREAT!!! The orange (juice/zest) gives it a very nice flavor.

Very good glaze. I served some extra at the table as a sauce and it was delicious. Perfect blend of sweet and tangy.

So good!!! I put the pineapple and cherries on top and used regular mustard since I didn't have Dijon. It looked like it could he photographed for a magazine and tasted like something I could impress with. Thanks!

This glaze was delicious. I used clementines, instead of an orange and it came out great!

The Glaze recipe is FANTASTIC!!! The sweetness of the fruit mixed with the Dijon mustard is so delicious, and has a nice little kick to it!   I used an apricot puree instead of the pineapple and orange and I did the ham in a slow cooker and it tasted absolutely amazing!  I even made a little more to use as a dip!  All around FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!

I love this glaze! I couldn't stop licking the pot! I used half an orange and I bought a can of pineapple rings in their own juice and used that as well. Came out pretty and just so good!

I made this for my husband and I tonight.  I loved it.  My husband thought it was okay (hence the 4 stars).  I think the reason he didn't like it as much was because we could taste the mustard and he is not a huge mustard fan.  We'd probably make it again with less mustard in it.  Thanks!

yum! i used orange marmalade and orange juice instead and doubled the dijon it was delicious! next time i would buy a better quality ham. and if i had whlole cloves i would have put them in the meat to better flavor it. since i was going to be gone while it cooked, i combined all ingredients in a bowl then poured over the ham in an oven bag in my roasting pan, put the lid on and baked at 275 for 4 hours, then when i got home took the lid off, opened the bag and basted it and cooked for about 30 more min without the lid. i also had put carrots in the bag with the ham just like i would for a roast and the were delicious! i'm so glad i did i would definitely recommend everyone does it!

Wow.  We are a family who doesn't love ham but  this just became an instant hit!  I plan to add this into our monthly rotation, which is saying a lot as we usually have ham twice a year at most!  This was soooo good!!

This will be my 3rd year making this ham for Thanksgiving, and it is great!!  Everyone asks for the recipe.  I feel kind of guilty that my ham is always eaten, and the other hams are hardly touched.  Part of the key to success is to not use the spiral-cut ham.  Spiral cut hams are dry and awful compared to this ham!

I give the glaze a 5-star, but do not put a pre-cooked ham in the oven for two hours at that temperature.  I only had an 8 1/2 pound ham and it only took about 40 minutes total. Please pay attention to the instructions that come with your ham.  I think I added a bit more orange juice and a little less zest, but the glaze is great...just keep basting that ham.

I've made this twice now -- once for Christmas and once for Easter.  Several people said it was the best ham they've ever had and they asked if they could take some leftovers home with them.  I ended up being bummed because there was hardly any leftovers for me and my boyfriend.  The first time I made, I tripled the glaze and used a whole large orange.  It was a tad too orangy for my boyfriend's plain palate, and there was way too much glaze in the pan.  The second time I made, I just used a small, not very juicy orange, and used the amount of glaze the recipe called for.  It was still good, but got a little crispy around some of the edges.  Next time I make, I think the solution would be to just double the glaze.  I also stuck some whole cloves directly into the ham, during the initial 2 hours of cooking.  I love pig!

This has become THE glaze recipe of our family.  A mere mention of this recipe sends my kids begging and pleading for it.  During the several times that I have made this I have found it useful to regularly pull the ham out and use my baster to squirt the glaze/juice evenly over the ham.  This promotes an even flavor and beautiful color.  I would have rated this ****** stars if possible!

Made this for Christmas. It got devoured. Very good flavor (I'm told), but I wouldn't recommend following this word for word with a spiral ham. Give it about 30 minutes less cook time, and drop the temp to 300 while glazing. My guests ate every drop of the glaze (even on their mashed potatoes).

The sweetest and most delicious ham I've EVER had. Since the instructions don't specify when to add the syrup, we ended up pouring it over the top after the fruit was toothpicked in, which created a really nice glaze over it all.

This ham was a hit at my house.  Everyone raved about how MMMM Good it was.  The only change I made was to score the ham before baking.  This allows the glaze to seep deeper into the ham.  I am making this ham again tomorrow for Easter.  Highly recommend.

this is so good!  I left out the  mustard, and it was perfect on my spiral cut ham.  I will be sure to use this again.  And its good to just dip your ham into when your eating it.

Excellent! Because I had only light brown sugar, I added a couple tablespoons of dark brown corn syrup to give it that hint of molasses flavor--I could have used molasses, just happened to have the dcs at hand.  I strained the pan juices for table use, without the addition of any thickening agent, since they were already slightly thickened from being in a large, open roaster.

This is the basic recipe for the glaze my mom and grandma used for many decades!...I have altered it to make it "mine" only by adding some freshly grated ginger...about 1/4 tsp....not enough to change the flavor..just enough to enhance it.....

Good Heavens!!!!!!  This was soooooo delicious!  I was looking for a recipe that had a pineapple sauce to pour over the ham, but I was a little disappointed after I started cooking it and realized that it was more of a carmelized baste.  I had my husband slice it and of course he had to sample it first. Before he even got finished slicing it, he said that he must stop and take some over to the neighbor.  I then took a bite and loved it!  It was very juicy and tender.  We will definitely be making this again, but I think I will still try to find a pineapple sauce to pour over it.  Thanks so much!

This glaze is awesome!  I tasted it before putting it on the ham and I thought it was a bit too orange-y but it mellowed out to perfect  I even brushed some on the cut pieces.  So delicious!

My family loved this!  The glaze is what made it.  I followed another reviewer's advice and put the ham in a bag with the glaze.  After 2 hours I opened the top of the bag and basted the ham with the glaze every ten minutes for another 1/2 hour.  It turned out tender and juicy.  The next morning, I had hungry teenaged boys that had slept over and put the ham and glaze in a pan and carmelized the sauce.  They ate it all!

I've used this recipe a few times and everytime I get rave reviews! I noticed some reviews said it didn't change the taste of the ham and I'll agree, if you only rely on what you baste the ham with during cooking, it does not soak in enough.  I usually serve it in a gravy boat and have guests pour it over the ham.  It's so good, we want to lick the plate!  It's even better the next day when you soak the leftovers in the glaze!

This is a keeper!  Delicious!  It's sweet and tangy.  I didn't have cloves, so I used a little cinammon.  I also omitted the zest because I didn't want it to be overpowering.  I won't be using any other recipe.

OMG! I made this yesterday for Easter dinner, along with the pineapple stuffing recipe from this site, and it was delicious! The one other time I made a ham, it turned out bland-tasting. This one had a beautiful crust on it and smelled so good cooking. I was worried that the flavors wouldn't penetrate the meat because they're only added in the last hour, but it was juicy and wonderful all the way through! I didn't have an orange so I left out the zest and used 1/3c. of orange juice. I think I'll tell Mom to let me make the ham from now on!

I love the flavor of the glaze on the ham.  Will have to wait til tomorrow to try out the gravy.  I will keep this recipe for sure BUT, next time I will add a little fluid to the bottom of the roasting pan ie orange juice, pineapple juice etc. at the beginning of the cooking process.  I will wrap up the ham in foil.  I've always wrapped and this was a first unwrapped.  It started turning dark early on in the cooking process and the first 2 layers of the spiral won't be served to guest...they're tough and crusty.

Overall it's a great recipe.  Thanks for submitting it.

I used this to glaze for my Christmas Ham.  It was good.  It made way more glaze than you needed.  I wasted a lot.  I will make again, but cut the receipe down a bit.

I have rated this a 5 due to ease and taste. I have made this twice and it is a big hit with my family.  I also have saved the pan drippings/glaze and used it as a sauce for the ham.  Delicious!

This is an awesome glaze for ham! Thank you. I followed the ingredients, the only thing I did differently was put the ham in a bag with all of the glaze and with the pineapple from the can. The pineapple delicious too! My ham was 5 pounds, and only took about an an hour and a half to cook.

Sweet and savory...Yum! 
I studded the ham with cloves and pineapple, so left the ground cloves out of the glaze.
Will definitely ue this again!

This is Amazing!! I just made it for our Easter dinner to go with orange glazed carrots (also from this site) And it was a huge hit.  I did cut the brown sugar and honey in half and it was just the right amount of sweetness for us, even my pickiest eater!!

This is the best ham glaze I've ever tasted and resulted in the best ham I ever baked.  I used a 10lb shank portion Cook's ham, bone-in and followed the directions on the packaging to cover it tightly in foil and bake 25 minutes per pound at 325 deg.  I temoved the foil and basted it with the glaze several times during the last 30 minutes.  It came out juicy with a beautiful and delicious glaze.  The next day I sliced  thick pieces and fried it in a little butter until hot and then added leftover glaze and it was even better the next day!  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't have dark brown sugar so used light brown and added about a tablespoon of molasses and I was out of Diijon mustard so used spicy brown mustard. Perfect!

We decided to make a ham for a today's Super Bowl get together at my son's house. I had an 11lb. shank, bone-in Cook's ham. I figured it would take a good 5 hours to cook, so I got up early to make sure it would be finished in time to get to my son's house before the game began. After reviewing a few recipes. I decided to use an "oven bag" ("turkey sized"). I had never used these, but know people that have...for beef roasts & turkey, but never ham. I chose this recipe because, like the author, I had most of the ingredients. I made only a couple variations. I had 'light' brown sugar, my orange wasn't in the best of shape, so I forewent the zest. Finally I adjusted the cloves to 1/8 tsp. for personal tastes. For the pineapple juice, I opened a can of pineapple, which I buy the 'light' or the 'in it's own juice' versions, so it was a great stand-in. Once the ingredients were all combined & the ham was placed in the bag, I poured the glaze over every inch of the ham. I twisted the end of the bag as tight as I could & used the zip tie included. I did not make the slits in the top of the bag as directed on the box (mostly because I was half asleep, lol) VERY EASY PREP-about 10 mins :) Once in the oven, it took only 2.5 hours!  Exactly what the box that the bag came in stated...haha! Again, it is probably best, especially w/ a new recipe & method, to be wide awake :) It was bulging w/ moisture, & juices ran as soon as the knife touched it. Sliced thin,succulent & tasty! GO Saints!

This is a wonderful glaze! I have another glaze recipe from this site that I've been using, but it's just been replaced! Love the contrast of the sweet and tangy flavors. The orange zest gives a wonderful flavor. I had a 6 lb ham, but made the amount of glaze as written.After scoring the ham, I placed pineapple rings and merichino cherries on top of the ham and fastened them in place with whole cloves and brushed with the glaze prior to putting it in the oven. I covered it with a foil tent and brushed on more glaze every 20 min untill the thermometer read 160. I then removed the foil and set the oven to broil for 5 min. This browned the ham and candied the glaze. It looked beautiful and tasted great!! Highly recomended. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This glaze is very good and a definite keeper! I didn't have pineapple juice or an orange so I substituted orange juice for the pineapple juice, leaving out the juiced orange and zest ... other than that, I made it as stated. I had a boneless ham sliced by the butcher and poured some of the glaze over the ham, covered it with foil so it wouldn't dry out and cooked it for 3 hours at 175 degrees since I had to be away when it needed to be basted. About the last 10 minutes I put the ham under the broiler to crystalize the glaze (baste a couple of times and watch so it doesn't burn). The flavored permeated the ham ... yummy!!

Cooking time was waaay off. I baked my precooked 8 lb ham for an hour and twenty min when it started to look like it was starting to burn. This was very tasty. I used a store brand spiral cut mesquite smoked ham, the smoke flavor went very well with the sugars. I had to omit the cloves b/c hubby doesn't like it. I think I'd have preferred regular yellow mustard as the dijon was a little strong. I subbed 1/4 c OJ for the real orange. Made a nice glaze for our ham.

The cloves are little too strong for my taste. But it still adds to the ham.

Best ham I've ever had. Followed the directions completely and turned out perfect. Put two cups of water in the bottom of the roasting pan and the ham came out juicy!

Not sure what is was about this glaze. I made it per direction. My husband was a bit floored by the overwhelming smell of orange (It really does not call for much!). I thought the flavor was okay, but if you are not a citrus fan, you may want to opt that out. Think I keep searching...TY

Excellent. Followed recipe pretty closely, used a 7 lb. uncooked smoked ham. Don't forget to score the ham and press in chives. Added a little extra water as World_Diplomat03 suggested to provide guests with that delicious juice. Warmed the pineapple rings in the juice rather than on the ham and served as a side dish. Ham browned nicely, had to cover with foil for the last little while to avoid over browning the outside. Orange flavour is a nice kick. Raves!

The first time I made this ham, it was pretty good but not the best.  My grandma told me to use only a teaspoon of zest and instead of 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar, to use only one cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup amaretto. Also, BASTE. A LOT.  Was delicious.

The glaze was easy to make and delicious!  Bought a shank half ham at Target which was fantastic (Archer Farms), juicy and not too salty.  Cooked the ham in a 325*F oven, tented with foil and a small amount of chicken broth in the pan to aid moisture retention.  Glazed it the last hour - every 15 to 20 minutes.   No need to by Honeybaked when you have this glaze recipe. AWESOME !  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was fabulous. I'd never made a ham before so I was hoping for the best and it was. If I can avoid using my oven I do so I put the ham in a foil tray and put it on the BBQ for the same time and temp. I also added the glaze from the beginning and basted every so often. I also added 1 1/2 cups of water to the pan but next time I think I'll add 2.  Turned out moist and the glaze was perfect.

Absolutely deeeeelish! We doubled the sauce and use a couple whole cloves instead of ground (couldn't find ground in the store). We used regular orange juice instead of zesting an orange and it came out fine. Highly recommend!!

When I make ham I have to make ham gravy too.  I loved this recipe because the mustard toned down the sweetness just a bit which made the gravy very tasty.  This will be my permanent recipe for ham.

This is a delciouis ham glaze. I used this on our Easter ham, and everyone loved it! Every ingredient in this recipe compliments ham, and when combined delivers a wonder, full flavor glaze. I scaled this down a bit as our ham was less than 10 pounds. I will use this again, thanks :)

I have made this ham twice.  It is the best hame I have ever made.  My husband does not usually compliment recipes and he said this is the best ham I have ever made.  So Good you can't stay away from it.  I made the glaze and based the ham every 20 minutes for about 3 hours.  I cooked my ham at 250 degrees.  That is the only thing I changed.  I definately recommend this recipe.

This was ok, would probably have been better if I hadn't overcooked the ham slices. I used a cook ham, placed on the slices and then put in the oven. Hubby, however, was late (an hour late, actually...but...ahemm....) so the ham was in WAY too long and so was horribly dry.  I"m sure the ham would have tasted much nicer glazed had the ham not have been so overcrooked.  Not a fair assessment.  
Did pour some of the left over glaze on Wolseley's dry dogfood and he gulped down, so it did pass the Wolseley test with flying colours!

This was the first time I made a ham that didn't already come with the glaze and it was a HIT! The ONLY thing I changed was that I cooked the ham in one of those Reynolds bags. Then, when it came time to add the glaze, I got rid of the bag completely and continued with the directions listed. It made for a WONDERFUL tasting ham that was so moist and juicy. I will be making this my official Christmas ham recipe from now on!

Have made this twice.  THe first time i followed reviews and didn't really stick with the origional recipe.  Didn't come out so good.  The second time i followed the recipe as stated and it is the best ham i have ever had.  I ended up using too much orange, and it was way too much, but still great.  This is my ham recipe from now on.

I bought a big ol' ham from Sam's and sliced it really thick.  While they cooked on the grill, I whipped up this glaze.  It was fantastic!  I didn't have the orange zest but I did have everything else.  I used the juice from canned pineapple rings and put the rings on the grill.  It was sooooo good.  I think I could eat the stuff on pancakes!

This was the BEST ham I have ever tasted! I cooked it with foil over it. It stayed so moist and juicy. I also took someone's advice that said about putting orange juice in the bottom of the baking pan. My husband doesn't even LIKE ham, but he LOVED this. :) The kids also gobbled it down. My brother and his wife stopped in and I had them try the ham also. They want the recipe! :) Thanks so much for making my first ham the best ham. :)

We loved this glaze.  I used crushed pineapple and pureed the glaze in my mini-chopper before bringing it a boil.  It got nice and thick as it cooled and really stuck to the ham.  I had a bit left of glaze left over so I added the pan juices to it and poured it over the sliced ham.  Delicious!

I’ve been making this ham for over 10 years. It’s a great recipe and Im always asked to make it (even for a wedding once!). I’ve always hated “fruit cocktail” ham with the cherries and pineapples so this one has a nice kick. I always double the mustard and cloves. That counters the too-sweet complaint. Try this recipe you will not be disappointed.

This was very ummy.  I made this for Easter and it was a big hit.  I didn't have any oranges on hand so i used orange juice.  I also had to cook the ham for a total of 4 hours before it reached the correct temperature.

Very flavorful. I had a 6.5 lb ham, but made the full glaze recipe, and having the extra made it tastier and easier to baste. I only basted 3 times, not every 10 mins, and it turned out great.

This is the perfect baked ham recipe. I have made it exactly as written, and when I forgot to buy an orange, I substituted my homemade kumquat preserves. Orange marmalade would suffice. This is the only baked ham recipe I will ever use.

I don't eat ham, so I was taking a big chance making this for my ham loving family. Well they love this! I have made it the last 3 Christmases, and they gobble it up and rave about it. I use a 10 pound spiral sliced ham, since I hate scoring and cutting it. I use a plain smoked ham if I can find it. Then I glaze it really well, I actually just pour the glaze on and brush it in. Cooked for about 2 hours total, glazed every 10 minutes for the last half hour. Even the chef in the family raved about it this year! Such an easy recipe!!

This glaze recipe is wonderful!!! I used light brown sugar instead of dark - that's all I had in the house. I baked my ham covered and also added a can of root beer to the pan to keep ham moist and add extra flavor. After 2 hours in the oven I brushed the ham with 3/4 of the glaze and recovered for an additional hour (my ham was 15 lbs). The last 10 minutes of baking, I removed the foil, brushed with remainder of glaze and put under the broiler to caramelize the top of the ham. YUM!

This is an awesome recipe! The ham was the juciest ham I have ever eaten! Even my husband (who doesn't like pineapples) loved it! My 9yr old son is a very picky eater. Even he loved it! I'm saving this recipe to use again! :0)

This is a very belated congrats because I made this at Christmas.  Everyone loved it!!!!  I didn't buy that big of a ham since I really thought with everything else there was to eat I wouldn't need much.  I was wrong.  My nephew and son ate almost half the ham by themselves!  Really easy and really delicious...my 2 favorite things in a recipe!

This was THE best ham I have ever had.  We did as suggested by others and wrapped them ham in foil for the first (2 hour) round of baking.  It came out perfect!!

This was phenomenal!  I changed it up just a little bit.  I used orange juice instead of juicing an orange.  I also left out the cloves because when I went to buy them, a small container was $12!  I never use cloves so didn't purchase them.  I didn't miss them one bit.  This was sooo good and will be the only ham glaze recipe I use from now on!

Fantastic! I have actually used this recipe several times now but haven't reviewed it. The prep time is great, the ingredients aren't exotic yet the flavor is really spot on. My husband is a very picky eater and must have complimented me on the ham 4-5 times tonight. I really like that it allows for one to spice up an already cooked ham. Will definitely use again.

This was so yummy! My boyfriend, who doesn't care for ham, even loved this. It was so tasty. Sweet and tangy just as you would imagine from the ingredients and the name. I will use this recipe from now on when I make ham!

This was sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly (well I didn't add orange zest, but that's all). I had about 6 lbs of ham, but decided to make the whole amt of glaze. I was glad, b.c the glaze was soooo sooo good. The ham had a great flavor and was enhanced by the glaze, not overloaded. Served w/ cheesy potato bake and salad.

Very flavorful glaze for ham. I cooked mine for 30 minutes and then started glazing, rather than waiting until the end.

My hubby and I agree that this is the best ham we have ever made. Very juicy and so very flavorful. This glaze rocks out......loved the citrus and the pineapple juice. And the dijon mustard stood out but was not over powering.  We made a 12.5 lb. ham so we had to cook longer....once the internal temp. of the ham reached 160 it was done. Will most definately make again. Thanks!

This glaze is delicious. The orange zest/juice give it a freshness that is above and beyond the typical honey glaze. A real stand out flavor that my family loved on our Christmas ham. Served it with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach salad from this site, using the orange flavored craisins, and Giada's Baked Mashed Potatoes. A simple yet delicious holiday meal.

I just made this for a potluck and can't wait to hear the reviews.  It tastes fabulous. I doubled the glaze so there would be extra. Decreased the honey by half and one less tbsp of mustard. It was perfect.  I was worried that the orange flavour would over power but once you cook the glaze with the ham, the natural juices and saltiness from the ham soften the orange flavour.   It was perfect. Will make this again.

This was sooo delicious and made the most beautiful ham. I should have taken a pictures. :) Everyone loved it! The only think I changed was to use pineapple orange juice because we always have it at the house.

I used this recipe on a 8lb uncooked ham. The glaze was delicious! My boyfriend and his mother really liked it. We are looking forward to the left-overs for sandwiches. Next time I will take my sisters advice and boil the ham for an hour first. She told me that this takes out some of the saltiness.

This was my first ham - I used a pre-glazed sprial sliced ham (I didn't realize the glaze was already on the ham when I bought it).  This recipe certainly jazzed up the dull, generic glaze and added some extra flavor.

This was a great recipe.  I increased all of the ingredients but the ham because I like powerful food, and I also baked it at a lower temperature for a lot longer.  It turned out great and even my I-only-eat-chicken-nuggets cousin ate a huge serving.

Used it on a spiral-sliced fully-cooked ham (just throw away the packet of powdered stuff that comes with it).  Didn't have pineapple juice on hand, so I subbed a can of pineapple slices in juice.  Diced up the pineapple and it worked fine as a substitution.  Husband said it was "Awesome!"

This sauce is so delicious! Rather than add the glaze while baking, I pour it over the ham after it is sliced. I usually serve the extra sauce on the side. That way, I can use the "carcass" for soup or other recipes without the glaze flavor.

I loved this recipe! I did not have any pinapple juice nor did I have oranges, so I used a tangerine instead. My wife said this was the best ham she had ever had in her life. Definately a keeper!

This glaze was PERFECT.  Very Tasty.  I wound up putting this Ham on the BBQ for Thanksgiving because everything else I was making was at different temps in the oven.  It cooked beautifully on the BBQ and this glaze gave it an amazing flavor.  My guests loved it.

Very good.  We had to modify it a bit on cooking time because our ham was raw.  I cooked a 8lb raw ham for 2 hours at 325 and then put the glaze on for the next 2 hours and basted it frequently.  I probably should have waited until the last hour of cooking as the glaze got really thick and sticky by the end of it, however the flavor and taste was still awesome!  We just couldn't use any of the "juice" on the bottom of the roaster because it had baked semi-solid on us.  I will try this again with a spiral cut ham!

This was very good.
I drizzled this over the Costco fully cooked spiral ham and it turned out golden brown and delicious.
So easy !

This recipe is very, very tasty,and I have made it several times, but the proportions don't measure up for me.  I always need to double (or triple!) this to cover a 10 lb ham.  So for that I only gave it four stars, but it is really yummy!

EXCELLENT! I didn't have oranges OR orange juice, but I did have on hand some Tropicana Orchard Peach Juice, so I substituted that for the OJ.  It was the most remarkable glaze I've ever made!!!  This is now officially going to be my ONE and ONLY HAM GLAZE!!!

This is a great glaze for ham.  I used it on a 9lb. spiral cut and followed the directions pretty much exactly however I usually don't measure with ingrediants that I know will work really well like these did.  I didn't have an orange so I too like another reviewer just used some orange juice (odwalla)so it tasted just like the real thing.  My 8yr old son asked for seconds which is rare for him with any kind of meat so I know it's a good one and a keeper for Holiday's!

Glaze was very good.  I also cut up some sweet potatos and put them in the roaster with the ham and glazed them along with the ham.  Made the sweet potatos super yummy.

This was absolutely delicious. I had made this glaze for a regualr frozen ham and served it to my family (full of cooks and caterers) and they loved it! Said it tasted better than a honey baked ham! Wouldn't change the recipe at all.

This gave me a nice glaze for my ham but I felt the orange taste was a little overwhelming.  This year I will try using just the zest or the juice but not both, just to bring it into balance for our taste.

Very good.  I made this without the orange juice and cloves.  I used just 1 T. of the mustard.  I used the juice from 1 large can of pineapple slices, then included the slices around the ham for baking.
The sauce never thickened to use a brush to apply, so I just used a baster.
This ham had such great flavor.  Definitely will use this recipe again.
Thanks Sue!

This was very easy and everyone loved it.  I bought sliced pineapples in juice and used that juice in the recipe.  I scored the skin of the ham, brushed on the glaze, and then put the pineapple slices on the ham with toothpicks.  I baked the ham the entire time with the glaze and had to baste it about every half hour.  After about 2&1/2 hours I covered it with aluminum foil b/c it was getting dark.

I made this for the first (huge) family holiday in our home.  It smelled delicious cooking.  It tasted fabulous (we had to pass around pre-dinner morsels because my family was circling the roasting pan like vultures!!).  I had TONS of compliments and requests for the recipe.  So easy!  I thickened the pan drippings with cornstarch for a great gravy.  Start with a good ham, and you'll be pleased.

Changed slightly by using whole cloves and pineapple rings. Thought it was good but by no means was it close to a five star rating. That beinng said I would use this recipe again and would advise others to give it a try.

Excellent.  My first time cooking a ham and ham lovers raved!  I personally am not a huge fan of ham and that is the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars.  Easy to make the glaze and basting wasn't as much a pain as I thought it would be.  Going with a precooked sliced ham was a lifesaver; slices made it easy for the glaze to penetrate deeper than top layer.
Ended up looking like it was a lot more work than it really was!

Follow this recipe to the "T" for a sure fire winner that even ham haters will love.  I know, I'm not a big ham lover but I sure enjoyed this one.  I was asked to cook one for a 50th wedding anniversary party.  I received many compliments from people I didn't even expect them from...and not one bit of ham was left.  This is a definite keeper and will become the standard ham glaze in our house from now on!  Thanks Sue - you sure turned my attitude about ham around!!!

This was a little too bland for me. I missed the spices from the spice pack that comes with the ham.  I guess I am just a "spice girl".  I thought that my bean soup made from the leftover ham wasn't as good without a spicier glaze.

This was a good glaze.  I added extra mustard and didn't have an orange on hand.  So it may have been a little better with the orange juice and zest.  But is was still good without and I'll use again.  I cooked my ham in my crockpot on low all day.  The last few hours I spooned the glaze over the ham every half hour or so.  It tasted wonderful!

This was absoluteley the best ham I have ever tasted.  It was easy to prepare and the ham turned out tender and juicy.  I never was a big fan of ham until now.  Especially delicious with a spiral cut ham, it gets into all the slices.  Yummmy.

On our last visit to Minneapolis, we bought a "real" ham from a "real" butcher shop. Twelve pounds ! We followed the recipe as written and it was very good - however, we have one family member who is not keen on the taste of orange zest and so we will keep this in mind the next time we use this recipe. It's definitely a keeper - thank you Sue S.

I love the glaze and the taste with the ham is truly amazing! But to be honest, I was baffled by why a fully cooked ham would need almost three hours in the oven. So, I made the glaze and set aside, placed the ham in the oven for about twenty minutes, then I added the glaze. One hour later, the ham was warmed through and the glaze topping was perfectly caramelized and fragrant. If your ham is not fully cooked, then three hours might be necessary, but it truly is not for a fully cooked ham. Then it just needs heated through and time for the glaze to permeate and caramelize.  :)

I used it the way it is listed before and I have doctored it - Today's rendition involved agave nectar instead of honey - a mixture of lemon lime and orange juice and zest - and pumpkin pie spice mixture I am using on my pie instead of the ground clove. I scored it and added whole cloves as well - Ridiculously good.

The aroma is wonderful while cooking and taste just as good! I added canned peach and pineapple slices as well as jarred prunes (pits removed) and poured a little of the prune juice from the jar into the glaze. Perfect! Made it for Christmas Dinner and everyone loved it.

Favourite at Thanksgiving.  Criss-crossed the top of the ham and studded it with cloves.  The flavour of the glaze is outstanding.

I served this ham for 16 people at Easter and had rave reviews from everyone and there were some pretty picky eaters in that group! They especially loved the glaze which I poured over the entire ham prior to cooking. I substituted 1/3 cup orange juice for the fresh squeezed, left out the zest and cloves. I did put whole cloves in a criss cross pattern on the ham itself. I basted a couple of times during cooking and then just poured the leftover glaze and pan drippings right into a gravy boat that I served on the side.  Best ham ever and it will definitely see many holiday tables to come!

This glaze saved my boring christmas ham. I overdid the orange zest, and did not have pineapple juice on hand (subbed extra orange juice), but it still was excellent. Next time I will make sure I have everything on hand that I need, this is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly except for one minor change.  I used the whole orange, peel and juice, instead of just 1/3 of it.  The glaze was easy to make and delicious!  The ham was perfectly moist baked exactly according to directions.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh, my--this was outstanding!  I used real maple syrup instead of honey and cut back slightly on the cloves--but what WONDERFUL flavor.  I served this for Christmas brunch and couldn't have been happier with it.  Then I used the ham bone & leftovers in ham & bean soup; fantastic!  So easy, such simple ingredients, so delicious.  Thank you, Sue S.!

Amazing flavor!!  I made this glaze for my Trader Joe's Ham last night and my family loved it.  I only had a 4.5 pound ham so I cut the sugar in half and I used orange juice instead of juicing the orange. It was so easy to make.  I will share this recipe with my friends !!

Tasty and easy to make! I mixed the glaze ingredients and left in the fridge overnight. That made it super easy to heat it while I was baking my ham. Multitasking, FTW!

I am NOT a ham lover. So when I used this recipe last Christmas to feed 10 people, I was skeptical. This was the BEST ham I have ever had!! Can't wait to make it again this year! SO glad I saved this recipe!!

All I have to say is fantastic!!! Thank you for the recipe! I didn't have an orange, so I just used all the pineapple juice that was in the small tin and I had whole cloves and threw those in the pot. Worked just fine!!! Next time I'll make sure I have the orange! Once again thanks, found  my ham recipe :)!

The only changes I made to this recipe were to use peach nectar instead of pineapple and pulp free orange juice, not big on orange zest. I also doubled up on the glaze.  It was excellent.  My husband and my Mother in Law loved it.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.  This will be my go to glaze  for ham from now on.

Made this twice - very good. Loved that I only needed to baste a hour rather than the whole time. Made it in a roaster and should have started it earlier.

Did not know anything about Ham before this.  As a matter of fact a ham was given to me two years ago and it went to waste.  I had difficulty finding a fully cooked ham.  Those that are fully cooked states so on the tag.  So finanlly I asked help to someone else who was buying hams and seemed to know a whole lot more than I did.   We did find a spiral cut fully cooked ham.  I followed the recipe as stated and now everyone thinks of me as the ham master.    Thanks for sharing.

I have to say - my ham came out amazing! It was very flavorful. I saved a bunch of money making a regular ham this way, rather than buying a spiral ham (like I usually do). Loved it!

Made this for my daughter's birthday dinner two weeks ago; it's absolutely Awesome!!! Am making it again for my Christmas Eve dinner tonight. I skipped the orange and cloves but kept the other ingredients as listed. The ham came out nicely glazed with a yummy flavour. Everyone loved it!!! This is now in my "Keeper" box :)

The absolute best glazed ham ever; perfect balance of flavors!  Only change was that I covered ham with pinapple rings using toothpicks and did start glazing the ham a bit sooner than suggested.  Thye carmalized pinapple put this recipe over the top.

I've used this glaze twice now on spiral cut half-ham and each time it has come out perfectly! I use 1/3 cup orange juice instead of the juice & zest of an orange simply because it's what I have readily on hand. All the other ingredients are spot on. The flavor is so delicious! I always roast the ham in a baking bag according to the temperature & time on the instructions that come with the ham. I place the ham in the baking bag & pour half the glaze over the ham before closing up the bag & throwing it in the oven. When there is 20 min left in roasting time, I cut open the baking bag at the top, pull the bag to the sides, & leave it uncovered to glaze (two or three times) and finish roasting. Perfect every time! Thanks for this absolute keeper & no-fail glaze! :)

This is delicious! I love the sauce with it even if it's a little bit bad for you. It had a really nice flavor and made for a delicious ham to serve my picky family. Don't be afraid to add a teeny-bit more of spice. It is the best! (: Thank you for such a fantastic recipe.

I used crushed pineapple juice and a spoonful of the pineapple itself and an extra shake of the ground cloves. My family gave it rave reviews on Easter Sunday! Delish!

We made this for Easter sunday and everybody loved it. My family has never been ones for putting anything on their hams so I was a little nervous but it was a hit! I left the cloves out only because I don't care for the flavor of them. Will definitely make this again.

I used orange juice instead of pineapple since that's what I had. It worked wonderfully and the ham and gravy/sauce it produced were delicious!

This honey glazed ham was wonderful.  I had a spiral ham. It was moist and yet nicely browned on the edges.  I used a cooking bag.  Basting the last 20 minutes  with the glaze really gave the ham a tangy sweet flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.  I'll always glaze my ham from now on,using this recipe of course!!

This was a delicious glaze. I didn't have pineapple juice so I used all orange juice instead (still used the zest). I used a spiral ham and it was just okay, but the glaze made up for it! I think it would be great on chicken & pork too.

I made this for a Christmas potluck dinner and it was a hit!  I bought a spiral ham and it was accompanied with a glaze in a pouch but made this tangy honey glaze instead.  I had enough left over for a sauce in case others wanted it...and they did!  It had the right amount of tanginess from the dijon mustard and the citrusness from the orange and zest was just perfect, not too overpowering.  I'll be making this everytime I make a ham!  It's a keeper!

Delicious and easy!  I baked my ham according to the package directions and basted every 10 minutes for the last half hour.  This was the first time I glazed a ham and it couldn't have been easier.  Thank you for sharing!!

My first ever ham...and I did it for thanksgiving and it was SO GOOD!!!  I will totally make this again.  I just have to learn how to cook it correctly when you have an uncooked ham...mine ended up a bit dry in some areas.  But the taste was great...I liked it better than mom-in-laws famous turkey!  Yay!  :)

This glaze was super tasty!  I used orange juice instead of the orange zest and bought a spiral cut pre cooked ham and basted it in between all of the slices to get the taste in there.  I only had to cook it for about an hour, basting ever 15 minutes and it turned out delicious. I made a pineapple casserole with it.

 I cook almost every night and my dad said that it was the best thing I had ever made.

I made this with a 10 lb. shank portion.  Since it was not fully cooked, I cooked the ham for 20 min. per lb. while tented with foil, then removed the foil and basted with the glaze every 10 min. for the last half hour.  I made the glaze per directions, doubling it as many reviewers had suggested so I would have some to serve as a sauce.  This was very tasty, and I will certainly make it again. BTW, it was even better the next day!

Ok, was reluctant on using this recipe..because my husband said he's not much for glazes on ham.  I did it anyway!  I'm glad I did, because he was sold on it.  He loved it.  I did end up using a bone in half ham that I had to cook beforehand, but I just added the glaze 30 minutes before it was finished.  It was wonderful!!!  My kids even had 3rds.  :)

This glaze was simple and really added what I was looking for. I advise everyone though, steam the ham first then finish it in the oven with the glaze. You will avoid a salty ham this way.

I've used this as the ONLY ham recipe the past 2 years for Christmas and New Year's. The glaze is the best! I prefer this to the popular expensive honey-baked version. Everyone loves this ham. And the glaze is the best part. I like to dress up my ham with pineapple slices and maraschino cherries as I glaze the ham while it cooks. Very tasty!

Very nice glaze.  This was my first time cooking a ham and I was nervous!  The glaze was a very nice consistency, coated well, and had a great flavor.  For me, the clove taste was a little strong - I may cut it back to 1/8 tsp next time or leave it out completely.  But I will make it again, for sure!  Thank you.

This glaze was wonderful! I used it on a 3 lb boneless ham, and adjusted the ingredients accordingly. It was simple to make (I omitted the orange juice and zest as I had none) and it made a lovely glazed crust on the ham. Great recipe, thanks!

Wow! So easy and it really adds a nice flavor to the ham. I reduced the sugar and increased the orange juice and zest, basted the ham every 10 minutes during the last 40 mins of cooking. Love this one..will always make ham this way now!

This was awesome!  I bought a spiral sliced ham that was on sale and made it using this glaze.  I used pinapple juice from a can of pinapple.  I minced up some of the pinapple and made a sauce using some of the same ingredients from the glaze.  I think I have converted my wife to like ham!

I did not find this glaze to be worth the effort it caused me.  I wanted to "dress up" my holiday ham, although I really like the flavor of plain ham.  The glaze was simple to prepare but did not add significant flavor to the ham.  It just gave a mildly tasty crust, but it mostly got cut with the fat that is also on the outside of the ham.  Applying the glaze increased my cooking time enough that my dinner timing was thrown way off.  If you do choose to use this glaze (or any other) please do yourself a favor and add at least 30 min. to your cooking time to account for the oven cooling significantly from frequent opening and closing while you glaze.

This is by far the best ham I have ever tasted. I serve this at every holiday meal. I have made the ham three times now and it always gets rave reviews. Make this ham you won't be dissapointed!

Amazing! I never though that ham could be made so delicious. I made this last year for christmas and it came out great, the left overs were great the next day. We could not get enough.  I will be making this again this year. Thanks.

This is probably the best ham I've ever tasted - I can't wait to show off for company with thie recipe!  I didn't have an orange so I used the tip from another reviewer to sub in 1/3 cup orange juice.  Update:  This is my go-to recipe for ham.  The glaze makes it nice and juicy, not dried out and stringy.  Does have a bit of a stronger taste with the cloves but we enjoy it.

I normally enjoy a bottled glaze called "Saucy Susan" but can't get it, here.  I was so pleased to find this recipe, which is VERY similar (a citrus-sweet sauce).  I omit the mustard because we don't like mustard.  My kids wouldn't eat ham before, but now they gobble it up when I put this sauce on it.  Oh, and I just cut the recipe in half and put it over a ham steak for a VERY easy meal!

I just made this glaze and it is wonderful! I will use a little less of the ground cloves next time, but that is a personal taste. I have never made a ham before, and I was super excited when it turned out. Adds a beautiful color too! Thanks!

Really Really Good and it smelled like a piece of heaven.  My family gobbled it and then were ticked off at me when I used the remainder for soup - they wanted me to leave the dregs for picking. Highly Recommend!

My local grocery store smokes their own hams and they're wonderful so I was afraid of messing w/ it but wow! I'm glad I did.  I had a 6 pound ham so I halved the recipe---I could have even used the whole thing because the flavor was wonderful and more would even be better! Everyone raved!

I put a mixture of pineapple juice and OJ in the bottom of the roasting pan as others had advised. I also used the OJ instead of fresh orange juice. I did add a little zest probably only a teaspoon or so, but it was enough. This was the first time that I cooked a ham and it turned out wonderful(even better that my parent's). I would reccomend this to anyone. It has a nice crispness on the outside from the glaze as well.

Here in northern New England we call recipes like this "wicked good".
I added a couple of tablespoons of bourbon to the glaze and cut back on the fruit juice accordingly. Supah!

I made this for my in-laws on Christmas Eve and my ham got rave reviews! I used orange juice instead of an orange and I omitted the cloves. I mixed a little Orange juice and water (about 1/4 inch) on the bottom of the roasting pan the entire time it was cooking. I also covered the ham until the last 20 minutes so it wouldn't get too dark. Thanks for the Awesome Recipe!

This recipe is delicious & very easy. I used light brown sugar and I added 2 tablespoons of crushed pineapple, otherwise I followed it exactly as written. The ground cloves and orange zest give it the perfect blend of spice. My husband & I both agree that it made the best ham either of us had ever tasted.

Made this ham for my first family lunch. I used a 6lb boneless ham. I followed this recipe pretty cloely, substituting whole cloves on the ham rather than ground cloves in the glaze. I also added pineapple rings to the ham the entire time it cooked. The ham turned out delicious. The glaze was wonderful as a gravy, although I was the only person to have the gravy. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best ham glaze recipe ever!! I made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  They poured the glaze all over the leftover ham to take home and fought over who would get the last drop.  I am not a ham fan, but I loved this recipe, even my kids loved it.  Highly recommend it!!!!

Made this glaze today for my Easter ham and it was absolutely delicious.  So simple.  I did make 1 substitution and that was using one small can of crushed pineapple in place of the third cup of pineapple juice.  Hubby said I better make a second batch to put on the rest of the ham.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Excellent! I will used this one again for sure!Years ago we baked hams (and also apple pies) in a brown paper bag. We can't do that any more because of recycling bags, so I made a parchment paper "envelope" slid the ham in and applied the glaze with a baster. I then sealed the parchment paper and baked. DELICIOUS!
I also used ingredients on hand, substituting the regular orange for 1/2 of a small blood orange and used buckwheat and  orange blossom honey mixed together for the regular honey. The slight bitterness of the blood orange added a pleasant tang.

This is an excellent ham/ham glaze recipe. My family loved it. I did a dry run the other night, in anticipation of the Easter dinner I am cooking. I wanted to know if there was a better ham recipe out there. With my other recipe, the drippings provide wonderful ham gravy for mashed potatoes. This recipe has an amazing combination of flavors, but might be inappropriate or overpowering for gravy. Unfortunately I didn't make gravy from it to see what it would be like.

I had to do this recipe a bit different as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, like the pineapple juice and ground cloves. Instead I used the juice of a whole orange and added a small dose of lemon juice. I also put the ham in a baking dish with sliced carrots and potatoes with just enough water to cover the veggies. I covered the ham with the glaze and threw some in the water. It came out absolutely delicious! The ham, potatoes, and carrots! My 3 year old daughter is a real picky eater but she had two helpings of the ham. I highly reccomend this recipe!

Excellent! Everyone loved it.  So simple and so tasty.  I scored the ham crosswise and inserted whole cloves into the ham which I removed before I put the pineapple on. I didn't have any oranges so I used apricot preserves, which were really good.  Due to a guest's allergies I had to swap out the honey so I added some extra brown and white sugar and let the glazed boil a little longer. At the end I added a little cornstarch to get a thicker consistency.  Covered the entire ham with pineapple slices with maraschino cherries in center held in place with toothpicks.  I kept 1/4"to 1/2" water in the bottom of the pan. I served the drippings on the side.  I couldn't have done this without this simple, easy, delicious and versatile wonderful recipe. Thank you Sue S!

Excellent recipe!  But will add more brown sugar and honey to a7 lb ham. Like one of the reviewer suggested, i placed the ham in an oven bag,  came that the rest of the ham came back a little dry , will NOT use the oven bag again, but will go back and baste the ham every 15 -20 min to cover the entire ham.

Will never use another recipe!  Husband said it was the best he'd ever had!  Took suggestions of others and skipped the zest, cut back a smidge on the cloves, added some water to the pan, topped w pineapple rings when glazing.  I can't think of anything that would make this better!

I doubled it to have extra for dipping, it made more than enough for leftovers.  Be careful when you bring it to a boil, it comes up and over the top fast   ; /    It is easy to make and delicious!

Made it tonight with a ~8lb bone in half ham. Laid Ham cut side down, scored the fatty part and stuck a few whole cloves in, added a little water to the pan, covered with foil and in it went. After about 1.5 hrs, I pulled the ham roast, emptied the juice out, used the foil to line the pan, decorated the ham with pineapple and cherries, and placed it back in the pan to go into the oven again. I didn't use the zest, and instead used bottled OJ - turned out beautifully. What I'll do next time is add the pineapple/cherries and baste a bit earlier - I like them almost caramelized and this didn't allow that. After carving, I placed the pieces back into the pan with the juices/marinade (removed the foil) and let it soak it up. YUM!

Wow this is amazing  and couldn't be easier! Definite keeper. I cooked the ham per package instructions & increased oven to 325, uncovered ham & basted with glaze every 10 min for 30 to 45 min. The glaze will be honey consistency. Yum!

Used this on a spiral ham for Christmas dinner.  It was a perfect combination of favors and also gave my house a "Christmas smell" with the cloves and oranges.  I had to adjust the recipe because my ham was 12 pounds, I may have just enough for a small sandwich left.

This was good, but not particularly outstanding.  Pretty much your standard ham glaze.  I'm not really sure how you get 1/3 of an orange juiced, so I just used a couple of tablespoons of orange juice and a little zest from an orange.  I would use more next time, as I didn't taste much orange.  Also, it seems ridiculous to open a whole can or bottle of pineapple juice to get 1/3 of a cup, so I threw in about 10 frozen pineapple tidbits and then used an immersion blender to smooth out the sauce before glazing the ham.

I have done this recipe so many times..... yes, on my own.  Kind of like you, with what I could afford or had.  I need a much smaller ham, so this year I could only find a 6.5 lb ham, but tomorrow I will still use the full sauce amount, cause it is so good to have for the left overs.  I do not understand how anyone could not totally love this recipe.  Oh yes, this year I am lucky enough to have some home grown Tangerines to use in my sauces..... heaven, just heaven.

I made this for Xmas dinner. I put the ham in the oven at 1230 and it was finished at 415.  I kept checking the thermometer and it was not done so I kept baking it more.  Husband tasted the glaze.  It made the ham very tasty and this was my first time cooking a ham.  I would only suggest that you make sure you cook it thoroughly, it really takes almost 4 hours. I like my food cooked well, especially meats !  The longer time did not make it dry at all.

This year I am contributing to Thanksgiving dinner for the very first time. I was pretty nervous but willing to try. I just finished making this ham at 2 a.m. and my husband asked if he could try some eventhough he was about to hop in bed! I love how this recipe is so simple, yet delicious! Thank you!

Awesome recipe.  The only thing I changed was, I glazed the ham several times after the initial 2 hour bake.  Total time I baked was 3 hours.

This is good as long as you like sweet hams. This is REALLY sweet, a little too much for me. It was good sliced and cold on sandwiches, but when I first tasted it, I expected it to be better. I couldn't eat more than a small slice because of overwhelming sweetness.

I really enjoyed this ham recipe. I'm not going to lie, I wasn't a huge fan of the glaze and it could have been the orange zest that did it. Next time I'll go a little easier on it and I didn't have the cloves (I don't like those anyway, so that's fine). I put pineapple rings on it which gave it a nice flavour. Regardless, the boys loved it and want me to make it again, so that's a good sign :) Happy cooking!

The orange and cloves overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients so this wasn't a big hit with anyone.  That being said, if you played with the recipe a little, it would probably be decent- you also have to be sure to use a pre-spiral sliced ham so you can get the glaze onto each slice.  I'm just not sure if I would put the effort into this when there are so many other excellent recipes around.

I used light brown sugar since that is what I already had in the pantry but used all of the other ingredients as posted. I estimated amounts rather than measuring.  This recipe made my husband very happy!!! Thanks Sue.

Wonderful recipe!  I made use of a few hints from the reviews...doubled the sauce (except the cloves) and saved half of it for a dipping sauce at the table. Put the juice from a can of pineapple rings and a jar of maraschino cherries in the bottom of the roaster.  Added the pineapple and cherries to the pan when I started basting. Because I thought it was a little dry, I will change the cooking temp to 300, bake 1 hr 15 min, start basting for another 45 min, so I have a total of 2 hrs counting the basting.

This is very good.  Did not have dark brown sugar so used lite and let it get heated through with a slow cooker to soak the flavor in even more. Another easy good recipe :).

This was very good and very easy.  My ham was precooked and spiral sliced.  The package heating directions were much shorter than the recipe so I was a bit nervous.  I cooked a 10 lb ham for 2 hours which worked well (started basting at 1.5 hours).  Wish the glaze had attached better, may suggest backing off just a bit on some of the liquid if you want a thicker glaze.  The ham made a beautiful presentation.  This is a great way to feed a crowd.

I used the recipe on a Kretchmar ham which was pre-cooked, but I wanted a glaze.  It was an excellent glaze.

Great recipe! This was the first ham I've ever glazed and I got a lot of compliments. Super easy recipe. I left out the cloves because my husband is allergic and used orange juice because that is what I had on hand and it still turned out great. In fact my husband's family liked it so much, they told me I am in charge of the ham for all our family gatherings! I also used the baking bag - made the whole process very easy.

I mixed all the ingredients put it in an oven bag in with the ham in the ovenand turned the bag over every 20 minutes. Very tasty and juicy. My family preferred the honey ham without the tang of the pineapple but this recipes is great.

I wish I could give this recipe a higher rating because I made this both for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and both times I got rave reviews. ;] It's a good feeling when your first Thanksgiving hosting experience is a good one. Let me just say, thank you. Oh. Sooooo yummy

This was fantastic! Had this for sunday dinner w/ the in-laws and they kept saying how good it was! Very easy and smells great. I used it on a shank portion of ham which hadn't been pre-cooked, but I just stuck the ham in an oven bag and then for the last 45 min opened the bag and basted the ham w/ the glaze. Very good and will definitley use again!

OK, so I thought I had all the ingredients to make this....but not really. So instead of dijon & honey, I had to use my honey mustard, and I only had about 1 C of brown sugar, so I added 1/2c sugar and a good heaping T of molasses. My ham was fresh from the smoke house,so baking time was different....still tasty and moist.

Fantastic ham glaze!  I didn't have a fresh orange, so I used juice from a carton and fresh lemon zest and the taste was wonderful.  I recommend brushing ham several times during last 30-45 minutes to build up the glaze.  This will be my ham recipe from now on.

Used this for a 22 lb fully-cooked ham, doubled the recipe and put half of the glaze in an oven bag with the ham.  After cooking for 4 hours, I poured the rest of the glaze over the ham, covered in foil and cooked an additional 45 mins.  The sugar from the glaze made the ham nice and dark which I loved.  It was so good, thank you for the recipe.

I tried this recipe this past Thanksgiving (2009).  I tried something a little different.  We were already smoking our turkey so I put my (thawed pre-cooked) ham in a foil pan and heated the ham in the smoker approx: 45 minutes covered in foil.  I then added the glaze to the ham and cooked (coverd) for another 20 minutes.  WOW.  i'm not a fan of ham but since Thanksgiving, I've looked foward to my ham sandwhich drizzled with a little leftover cranberry sauce.  Definitely using again!  Thanks, SUE!

Fantastic. I started glazing the ham a little earlier than suggested, and used the glaze over the pineapple on the ham as well, and it turned out amazingly good. I am making it again tonight.

This glaze is awesome!!!  I am not a big fan of Dijon mustard so only used half what this recipe called for.  I baked and glazed the ham, sliced it and took it for a potluck at work.  I placed the sliced ham in the crock pot, poured leftover glaze over slices and kept warm on low setting.  I ended up giving this glaze recipe to several co-workers.  Planning on making it this year for Thanksgiving!!!

My family including 2 young children just adored this recipe!  My husband says its even better than a certain well known ham store.  I followed just as directed except added carton OJ because I didn't have any oranges on hand.  My daughter (7) says she wants it in her lunch tomorrow.  I asked her if she wanted it on bread as a sandwich, she said  "NO! just put it plain!"  Need I say more? Thanks that really was delicious!

This will become our "go-to" menu for ham! Excellent recipe!  **Because I was afraid it might dry out, I put some water in the bottom of the pan, put a layer of glaze on the ham and tented it for 2 hours and then finished glazing for the last 20 minutes.

Easy and Delish!  Ham is not one of our family favorites, due to saltiness.  But this was great( moist, tender, and not very salty!)

This was delicious! I had 1 small turkey ham, and 2 small boneless hams. I used the full recipe for the sauce. I only cooked the hams and turkey for 1.5 hours. The only change I made was using orange juice instead of the juiced orange as others advised. I still used the orange zest though. I put whole pineapples and cherries around the top of each one. What a hit!!

This turned out delicious. I didnt have pineapple or Dijon and it still turned out awsome. I cooked my ham covered with tin foil for half the time then I uncovered and added the sugar mixture and started basting for the rest of the time. I also added cherries the last 30 minutes. It was awsome.

Great glaze!  My guests loved this ham! I feel bad, but like others, I didn't use the pineapple juice, because we never drink it.  I used apple cider in place.  Also, a clementine works out great in place of 1/3 of an orange.

I made this for a 5lb ham and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours. I brushed on the glaze 3 times during the last 30 minutes. I used 2/3 cup orange juice instead of fresh oranges and pineapple juice, because that is what I had on hand. Delicious!

I made this and my family didn't really like it. They thought it had too much of an orange taste even though I did not put the full amount. I did double the recipe as others have suggested but there was a strong citrus taste, not for us.

I made this for Easter, and the taste was very good.  The recipe states that you should cook it for 2 hours uncovered, then add the glaze.  I did this, and the outside of the ham was charred - though the inside was still juicy.  I would recommend covering the ham for the first two hours, and uncovering it for the last 30-45 minutes when you add the glaze.

Overall, very tasty.  I will try it again.

This recipe was a hit!  I've never glazed a ham before and my guests loved every drop of it.  We also used it at the table to drizzle on the meat.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  I'll never use another glaze.

I used a tin foil tent over the ham and it was great. I would suggest making the sauce as someone said, with cornstarch, because otherwise we served the ham and not much of the yummy glaze was tasted.

This is absolutely, without question the best ham glaze I've ever had!  I had bought a whole ham for Christmas dinner,  just a cheap store-brand ham.  I put it in my roaster oven for 2 hours, then poured some of this glaze over it and basted it every 10 minutes for about 45 minutes. The results were amazing! My family doesn't even care for ham, but they were begging for seconds, and thirds, and fourths!  I think they ate more ham than anything else on the table! Not too sweet, not too overwhelming, it was the perfect blend of flavors. The only thing I changed was that I didn't have any orange, so I added a little extra pineapple juice instead. Next time I'll try the orange and see what happens.
Great recipe!!!

I made this ham recipe for our family Christmas dinner. I made it exactly as the recipe said - no changes, and it was wonderful. The ham was very tender and flavorful. The only problem I had is that my pan was too small and when the sauce came to a boil, it boiled all over my stovetop. Not a big deal to clean up, but I would suggest using a larger pan than you think you need so this doesn't happen to you. Everyone wanted the recipe. This will be a family favorite from now on. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My fiance and I both enjoyed this recipe, but this most likely won't be a do-again recipe for me.  I was hoping all the flavors would come together, but it was easy for both of us to pick out the individual flavors of citrus and clove.  Again, it was good, but not a favorite. 

EDIT:  I made this again for Christmas because my fiance wouldn't stop hounding me about it.  It was much better this time and even I was happy with the way it turned out.

Fantastic!  Followed recipe but had no ground cloves so I cruched some in my pestol and morter.  Also,put pinapple rings on the ham.  The carmelization of the pinapple and ham from the glaze was beautiful.  The best ham any of my house guests had ever eaten!

WOW!  This was grrreeat!  Very sweet and a great pair with the ham.  I served the ham with the "Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes" (also a great recipe).  There isn't a better way to eat ham than with this glaze!

This ham was so good!  I had never cooked a ham before and could not believe how easy it was.  I used a butt portion, which was very inexpensive but somewhat fatty, so I just drained the fat after it baked for two hours, then did the glaze - there was almost no fat in the pan after the glaze was done.  I was so impressed with this.  The glaze was super easy two, especially since I was in a hurry and didn't measure anything, i just eyeballed it and it came out great - also used regular orange juice instead of juicing and zesting an orange.  I'll definitely make this again - so much easier foe a holiday meal than turkey!!

I tend to change recipes because i'm picky.  Since i don't like orange on ham, this is what i did and it tasted great: Didn't use the orange juice or the orange zest.  Boiled ham and then baked it with the glaze the last hour of cooking.

This was really good- my first time making ham and it was a great success!  I didn't have pineapple juice or cloves (strangely) so I just omitted them.  I used 1/2 orange and cut the brown sugar back to 1 cup.  So good and flavorful; I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

I scaled this recipe down to 4 and served the glaze over a one pound ham steak.  I didn't have an orange so I used orange juice as other reviewers mentioned.  My husband thought it was good, but still prefers honey baked ham over this recipe.

WOW! I grew up in the kitchen having to take care of the family and although I am young, I have cooked my share of hams!  This one was delicious!  Absolutely loved it.  I have made hams similar to this but without the cloves, orange, and honey.  I only used a 5 lb. ham but didn't change the recipe so we could have plenty of that yummy glaze.  I highly recommend this....go ahead try it!

This was very easy to make and the ham turned out GREAT!!  IT was very good.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.  I didn't baste it every 10 min.  I just basted it 3 times in the last hour.  It was very good.  Thank you!

I've found a new glaze for my ham! My family loved the taste of the ham. The drippings made an excellent gravy that I could use on the meat and potatoes. Don't change a thing!!

Usually my Aunt makes the ham for our Easter dinner, however, this year I was assigned the task. I tried this recipe. I realised at the last minute that I didn't have any honey. I substituted maple syrup instead. It turned out exceptionally well. I received lots of compliments from everyone. I didn't have the heart to tell my Aunt that I didn't use her recipe. A definite keeper!

This Glaze was excellent, but I made a couple changes. I cut the brown sugar back to 3/4 cup packed, and I added almost a cup more pineapple juice. It was really great drizzled over baby carrots too!

This was OK, but not great.  I don't think the flavor penetrated the ham well at all, and I don't think the sauce was tasty enough to serve on the side.  Cloves were definitely overpowering; if you try this, start with half the amount and then adjust to taste.

I gave it 3 stars to be fair b/c I didn't follow the directions exactly. I guess I just don't like cloves.

I made this recipe for Easter and everyone loved it!  The only change - omitted the cloves.  I heard "this is the best ham I've ever tasted" many times that day.  Be prepared to give the recipe.

Excellent!  Gosh, this tasted so good!  Didn't need to add anything to the pan drippings/sauce, it thickened up all on it's own to a thick syrup that tasted great drizzled over the sliced ham and sopped up with biscuits/bread.  Wonderful meal!

This ham was excellent!!! I didnt have an orange, so I used a pineapple orange juice blend, and increased the juice content by 1/4 cup. I used the glaze on a pre-sliced ham, and baked for 45 min (because it was already pre-cooked). I glazed throughout baking. There were no leftovers!!! Thanks, Sue!!!

I made this for Easter and I impressed everyone!  A quick shortcut - instead of the juiced zested orange, I used 1/3 cup orange juice and sprinkled some dried orange peel into the glaze.  The leftovers were just as good the next day!

I made this for our Christmas dinner. The family kept saying how goof this ham tasted. The glaze made so delicious! It was the most complemented item served. I’ll make this every holiday that we gather for a big meal.

The basting sauce was perfect and I didn't need to doctor it up. I usually do not like the taste of mustard. But the mustard as well as orange added another dimension to the traditional taste of the clove, sugar and acidity of the pineapple juice.  I stuck 2 skewers through the spiral ham to hold the slices in place. Then baked it at 275%, at 12 minutes per pound, and covered the pan with aluminum foil. I basted the ham with the natural dripping every 30 minutes. But uncovered the ham and used the basting sauce from the recipe every 10 minutes in the last 30 minutes of baking. It was delicious served on Hawaiian rolls.

I made this ham for a Church meeting and I'm making it again for my family. It is delicious!!!! I misread part of the instructions and used the juice of two small oranges and the zest of one but followed the rest correctly and it turned out great and with a beautiful glaze to it.
Thanks, Donna Votaw

I thought the baste was a little 'liquidy'. If I make this again, I'll make sure to give it more time to simmer.

Great, easy glaze for our Easter ham. Added cornstarch to remaining glaze to thicken slightly and served with ham. I substituted Truvia brown sugar blend for brown sugar.

I don’t really like sweet things but wanted a traditional glaze for the Christmas ham I made. The only thing I changed was that I added about a tablespoon of hot sauce to the glaze while it simmered. It was fantastic!

I made this for Christmas lunch and I must say it was great. I made it exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The temp was right, the time was right, and the flavor of the glaze was perfect. The family kept talking about how good the ham was. This is now our traditional ham recipe. Thank you Sue!

I used a Sam’s Choice fully cooked double brown sugar ham and followed the instructions for that ham while using the ingredients in this recipe. I mixed the ingredients with the glaze that came with the ham, basting every 10 minutes and it turned out wonderfully!

I make ham for my family even though I don’t like it. This recipe makes such a lovely juicy roast I may need to change my mind. Everyone loved it   
I only had crushed pineapple so I used that juice and added the crushed fruit to the pan drippings and heated it through. That made a wonderful “gravy”.

Loved this recipe but I wanted it a bit more spicy. I didn’t have oranges so I added 1/4 cup marmalade and  3 tbsps whiskey, 2 tbsps cloves and 1 tbsp of pepper sauce.

Instead of using fresh orange zest/juice, I used orange extract, which worked out just fine. This glaze was not only easy, but delicious!

Great recipe, I've made this several times, I use Ham Butt and soak it in fresh water to reduce the salt taste in some cuts of ham. Make extra sauce for a topping to mashed potatoes or to soak up with a dinner roll!

First time I've cooked a ham, and I decided to try this recipe. I didn't use orange zest because I think it's too overpowering, but other than that, I folowed the instructions. Turned out absolutely wonderful. I will never buy a Honey Baked Store ham again, and i will be making this many times in the future. Everyone LOVED IT!! And it makes the best ham sandwiches with the leftovers!!!

Awesome! Used 10 lb Cook’s shank ham.  Put ham on rack in pan. Added 2 cups water to pan.  Did not have ground cloves so inserted whole cloves in ham. Made sauce and basted ham generously (I did not have orange so used 1/3 cup orange juice instead).  Tented pan in foil and secured foil tightly and cooked for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Took out of oven and unsealed ham and let rest for 20-30 minutes.  This was amazingly moist.

Really great recipe!! This was my first time using someone else recipe for my ham. I usually make my own glaze to put on the ham. I had everyone taste it before I put it on the ham. My husband didn’t care for the zest and spit it out, but the kids loved it. And when the flavor soaked  in..... all I can say is ‘oh my, my, my’ (in my Johnny Gill voice).

I did not have pineapple juice, so I used the juice of a whole orange.  I loved the orange essence of the glaze and so did my family.

I have made this every Thanksgiving for several years now. It's a family favorite. Instead of using pineapple juice and 1/3 of an orange zested and juiced, I just buy pineapple orange juice and substitute that.

Perfect. I followed this exactly, well almost, I added 1 cup of Dr. Pepper and since the ham was cooked I dumped the juices that gathered in the bottom of the pan and used about 2 TBSP of the juice to add to the glaze, this made it taste amazing, it will be my go to recipe from now on.

Turned out excellent! Ham was moist and the pineapple slices were very sweet(after the glaze). Added about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon lemon juice to make it a little more tangy per recipe recommendations.

Excellent ham.  Super moist.  I made one change.  After putting the glaze together I didn't  think it had enough kick.  So I added about 3 tablespoons of brown mustard.  The Dijon just didn't add enough flavor for me.

I made it with a little change. I did not use the zest and I did not put the pineapples on top. There were too many cooks in the kitchen and a few steps were skipped but it was really good. Not too sweet and a good amount of tang. I will definitely make this again.

This glaze is easy and tasty! I didn't have an orange so used orange juice. My ham was a spiral sliced fully cooked ham that I heated, covered, at 325 with a cup of water. The last 45 minutes I removed the cover and drizzled on the glaze...straight from the pot. I drizzled the glaze 3 times. But the best part was turning the glaze and juices left in the pan into a sauce! I did that after we ate and some of the ham looked dry. I poured the juices into a pan, thickened with cornstarch and oh my goodness...we practically wanted to eat again right then!  Delicious!

this was spot on. like others I seen the ingredients and said what's the big deal! well let me tell you this was the best ham i've had and made.. i made this for a sunday dinner with in-laws and it was a winner.. i used other review suggestion and made the glaze and put all in a oven bag.  made sure ham was covered by  all, tossed it back and forth, cooked for 3 hours untouched. Had a 8.25lbs picnic ham. Had smashed taters with glaze ham gravy and brussels sprouts. yum yummy!! my new ham recipe!!

I used a bone-in spiral cut ham and followed the glaze instructions exactly.  I wasn't sure what type of pan to use, but the ham fit in my large rectangular glass pan.  I found the cooking time was too long - maybe because I used a glass pan instead of a metal roasting pan - it was very well done at 2 hours and the spiral slices were separating and dark brown at the edges.  The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, although my husband loved it.

Awesome, I had to use no bone pork - and make it in a slow cooker (Oven had the Christmas Turkey and the Toaster Oven had the Brussel Sprouts)

Put the ham on HIGH for 2 hours, made the glaze and then set aside to sit for the 2 hours while ham cooked.

Then turned the slow cooker to lowest setting, covered ham with glaze and crushed pineapple; basting every 30 mins or so for 2-3 hours (I left the cover off the slow cooker for this as it would have made the glaze too runny.

FANTASTIC!!! Was a hit all round at Christmas dinner!!

NOTE: Due to allergies I had to use a full mandarin orange instead of a regular orange.

This was so simple to make and  it was very tasty. And even though I made a couple of emergency tweaks, apple cider vinegar for oranges and whole grain mustard for dijon, it still worked really well. Will definitely use this again!

I didn't use the zest, and used orange juice instead of an orange. I also used whole cloves in the ham instead of the ground. It was delicious!

I preferred this much more when I switched out the orange and just added a tablespoon or two of lemon juice. I had the whole family raving so much about it at Thanksgiving, that I was given the honor to do the family ham at Christmas with the same glaze. Original recipe rates a 4/5, but with my alteration, it is a perfect 5/5 ham glaze. It'll probably be a regular from now on.

I loved this recipe. I changed the part where you boil sauce seperate because I work a lot and prefer one dish meals. I put the sauce in with the ham. Same temp and time. 15 min before serving it i  cranked to 450. Wow it thickened beautiful. I didn't use cloves as had none and regular mustard as had no dijon. Wow amazing. Thank you for this.

This glaze is one of the best I have ever used and it was easy to make! I used light brown sugar instead of the dark brown, and added some maraschino cherry juice and a little bit of nutmeg. The ham was just amazing!

Every time there is a holiday get together I always get asked to make this! I sometimes add a beer for a little juiciness and sometimes I double the glaze. Either way it's so good! My family loves it!

This is the best glaze I've ever put on a ham! I wanted to eat it like soup and skip the ham. I've tried other glazes, like apricot and less sweet pineapple glazes, but by the time the ham was done, I couldn't really taste the ingredients. The ground cloves in this glaze make all the difference. We preferred them much more than studding the cloves. Now I want to figure out a way to make Sticky Chicken Wings with this glaze.

WONDERFUL Flavor! I used this on a spiral ham that I put in a cooking bag. I pulled apart the slices a little and slowly poured the glaze over it and made sure it got in between the slices.Then closed the bag up.  EASY Cooking my guests LOVED the ham.

Excellent!  I have spent a lot of money over the years on fancy specialty hams with their own glaze. This year opted to try something on my own and everyone agreed this was the best ham ever. I did cook the ham according to the label directions, covered with foil. I was running out of oven space so when I put the glaze on, I added carrots around the pan edges to roast. Te addition of the sweet glaze on the carrots was delicious. Definitely a crowd pleaser and my go to recipe now!

This was amazing to make last minute, in fact thing that never happens is I had every ingredient at hand. I do have to say it didn't look pretty when it came out of the oven and felt disappointed but when I sliced into it and took my first bite I was in heaven. I did reduced the amount of sugar because I had a 8lbs ham, same with mustard only because I was running out of it. Left the amount of orange juice as is. The only difference was I didn't have ground cloves so I used the whole cloves and sort of crush them, not a whole lot since I stuck some of the other whole cloves on the ham. Also I didn't stick a whole lot of cloves ,I didn't want it to over power the ham. I couldn't believe it was so good, so tender. Amazing

This is becoming our "go to" recipe, when it comes to baked ham. We made this for Easter and I just used this recipe, again, for our Christmas Dinner. Excellent. Rave Reviews! The only extra thing I do, is add a can of chicken broth (and 3 Tbsps of the sauce!) to bottom of roaster pan, at the start. This keeps the   ham moist And adds an early hint of the glaze taste.

This was very simple to make and made a delicious accompaniment to our Christmas ham. I dislike super sweet sauces so was looking for something that wasn't completely sugar. It was still very sweet, of course, but not cloying. It was just 5 of us, so I cooked a 2 lb ham with 1/5 this recipe. I just used a splash of OJ without the zest. I had a fresh pineapple and used the juice for the recipe then threw the slices in the oven toward the end of the cook time for the ham and served them alongside. My 3 year old loved it so much she ate too much ham too fast and gave herself a tummy ache.

Delicious! I did as some others suggested and added water to my roasting pan and it made a huge difference. We have a large family so we buy our meat by the side and this particular pig turned out more dry than others. Adding the water to the pan helped it stay moist, which my seven-year-old kept pointing out. Haha.

My family loved this ham, the recipe made the ham sweet and savory. I followed the directions for the glaze as instructed, but I prepared my ham a little different. I rubbed the ham inside and out with brown sugar, put the pineapple and cherry on top and wrapped it in foil inside of the roasting pan. After cooking the glaze I dazzled the ham inside and out with the glaze. I baked it for an hour and put the glaze that came with the ham inside and out of the ham and baked it for another hour. After the ham finished baking I topped the ham with he remainder of the glaze I made with this recipe. Everyone loved it and said it was delicious.

This was a family hit last Thanksgiving. My son, a ham aficionado of many years, devoured it and gave high praise. Thanks for the recipe. As I am not a fan of ham, I normally outsource to the big brand store on the holidays. Now I have a new option to go in my recipe box as a keeper.

This was my first time cooking a ham, and I chose the glaze by the number of 5-star reviews! This glaze was fabulous; I didn't have the mustard so it was probably a little sweeter than intended but no one complained!  Will definitely use this again.

I didn't really care for it, and it was too sweet, but then I didn't put it  on my ham, I just simmered it for quite awhile, so that was prolly my fault. I'll try it again when I bake it with my ham.

This glaze is amazing. My guests at the dinner I served it at were very impressed and it disappeared quickly. I actually didn't have a brush to brush the glaze onto the ham and had to use a wooden spoon. Additionally, I accidentally forgot a few times to glaze it as often as the recipe requests and it still turned out amazing so I can vouch that this is pretty fail proof. Enjoy!

This glaze was amazing!  I used a frozen brown sugar ham and added this glaze to it right when I put the ham in and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low so it wouldn't dry out.  Everyone loved it!

Yummy!  I remember my mother's ham (from a can with cloves and pineapple, yuck!) This is nothing like that!!  I used a spiral cut bone in ham, it turned out wonderful, with not a lot of fuss!  And my pickey husband enjoyed it, you can;t beat that!

This glaze tasted really good, and was very easy to make.  It didn't make a crust on the ham, but the flavor was there.  I used a 10 pound spiral sliced ham.

Based on the reviews, I was expecting an exceptional ham.  It just wasn't.  It was alright.  It wasn't horrible, but not something I'll go out of my way to make again.

This is a great recipe. I don't eat pork, and have never cooked a ham. Baked a ham for Christmas for my family and they were amazed. Because I don't eat pork, they couldn't believe how good it was. Great Recipe...

This was great!  But let me tell you, the ham with the glaze was SOOOO much better the next day!  The orange really comes out.  Love it!

This was a very good glaze.  I didn't use all of it, but passed it at the table along with the ham.  This will be the glaze I use again for sure.

Absolutely delicious!!! I usually get hams from the honey baked ham store, but decided to make my own glazed ham this year.  The glaze gave the ham great flavor.  Definately will use again!!

The ham was very moist and juicy but I could taste the glaze only on the skin of the ham; the meat itself was still a little fresh. Not the flavor I was expecting but nice nevertheless.

This was the best ham I have ever had.  I made it for a Christmas party, and everyone raved about it.  I didn't have an orange, so I used orange juice like several other reviewers.  I also don't use exact measurments, I just eye-balled them.  I'm going to make this again in a week for Christmas dinner.  Thanks!

I put in sweet potatoes like someone else suggested, and they simply wouldn't bake and then later when they finally softended I hated the flavor. 

But I did vote only based on the recipe itself. I thought it was okay but it wasn't anything special. My dad, who usually loves pretty much anything (and whom I was hoping would love the glaze) wasn't a big fan, either. That said, the ham was very tender and delicious and maybe someone who likes sweet and tangy things more would enjoy it. 

I'm not sure if I'll make this again... If I do, I will make a lot less and only enough to glaze the ham with, instead of having so much leftover.

This was ok.  The glaze burned on the bottom of my roasting pan and gave the meat a bit of a burnt flavor.  Not sure if id make this one again.  Perhaps if mine didn't burn it would have been better.

I used this on a boneless tavern ham.  The only addition I made was to put pineapple slices on the ham right before putting on the glaze.  This was the best ham I've ever made and all my guests for New Year's dinner agreed.

This was a hit on Christmas at my house.  We spread some of the reserved glaze onto the ham slices.  I used a little more OJ probably about 1/2 an orange.  It had a different taste but it was good.  My husband really liked it.  I will make it again.

This glaze was good, but I'm not sure if I would make it again since my ham came with a glaze pack that would have been MUCH simpler to put together on such a crazy holiday. But it was fun to give it a try and it definitely was tasty! :)

This made the best ham ever!  We made this ham on Christmas Day and everyone declared that it was the best ham they have ever had.  We have since made this again, and it was just as good.

This was a tasty, sweet glaze but be careful with the orange zest.  I think half of what it calls for is enough or it is overpowering.

Tihs is a fantastic glaze! I cooked it about 5 minutes longer than called for so it would be a nice thick sticky consistency in order to assure it stayed on my ham for the last 45 minutes of cooking. Everyone raved how great it was. Thanks so much for sharing!

I use this glaze over and over again and everyone always loves it!  It seems to enhance the ham perfectly without being overwhelming.  Plus, it's easy to throw together and I typically have the ingredients on hand.

I made this for Easter, and it turned out great.  My boyfriend raved over it!   I didn't have the dijon mustard or the honey, so I added a little ketchup (to taste) and a handful of raisins.  I also used a can of tidbit pineapple, juice and all.  A very good recipe...easily adjustable to make it a little more sweet or a little more tangy, depending on your taste.  Will definitely make again!

We make this for Easter  every year and everyone loves it.  I usually never have any pineapple juice in the house so we use a flavored orange juice which works amazing with this recipe.  I hate juicing fruit, so I just basically use orange juice and no one  complains.  This is my go to recipe for ham for the fact that there is no whole cloves,  I hate taking the time to stud the ham with the cloves to get the flavor.  Excellent!!!!!

I tried this glaze for the first time this Easter weekend.  I didn't have any recipes for one, having tried many of them.  This is by far the best glaze I've ever had.  I even marinated the ham in it over night, and kept basting it while it was cooking.  Even my boyfriend told his mother it was better than her ham.

Made this for Christmas this year and it was a hit!  We forgot to purchase honey at the store so, at the last minute, I used honey BBQ sauce in its place.  This really cut back the taste of the cloves  (I noticed that previous reviewers didn't like this ingredient, so this may help for like-minded cooks/families).  

I smells wonderful cooking during the day and tasted excellent.  I was asked for this recipe from many of our friends and family.  Highly recommended.

Very good ham recipe.  The orange was just a little overwhelming for me.  The drippings made an excellent gravy.

I made this for Easter 2004 and remember using a combination of honey and maple syrup as I don't use anything but those two and/or blackstrap molasses in my cooking.  Also, I think I used orange juice as it was more practical at the time.  The glaze was delicious.  We ate every last bit of that delicious glaze from the bottom of the pan afterwards!

This was not quite as flavorful as I expected.  I used even more fresh orange juice and zest than called for and more ground cloves, but the flavors were still pretty subtle.  I will keep trying to find a better ham glaze.

Fantastic!  Will use this recipe again as it is so easy to prepare.  Nice change from most brown sugar glazes. I did find the cloves a bit overpowering.

I first made this glaze a month ago and it was so good that i am using it for my Easter ham instead of the packaged glaze that comes with the ham. thanks for the great recipe.
