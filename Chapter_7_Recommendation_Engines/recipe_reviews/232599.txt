I added this to my collection months and months ago but I've kind of been waiting for someone else to try it first.  Today, I gave in and decided to be the first reviewer.  I'm glad I did.  It is very good.  It's a little heavy on the pineapple and could use some salt, but those are probably just a matter of personal taste.
