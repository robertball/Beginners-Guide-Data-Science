The recipe doesn't say to chill the dough, but yes, you must do this. Also I cut the ground ginger down by a teaspoon.

I'm giving these cookies only a 3 because They were okay but if I make them again I will make a few changes.  They're definitely chewy, that I liked. To me they are too sweet and not enough flavor.  I may try adding a smidge of cloves and using less sugar if I make them again.

This was pretty good, but it has a pretty strong ginger taste. A bit too strong in my opinion. My friends loved them though, and they keep begging for more.

I followed the recipe and the cookies were way too sweet. I would recommend adding less sugar. When I baked them for 14 min. and they burned at the bottom.  
I will definitely have to make some changes if I make them again.

Gingerbread cookies are my favorite, but they are so hard! They need to be dunked (try lemonade!) These are so soft and the taste is outstanding. I won't be buying hard cookies anymore.

I used cane sugars instead of regular sugar as thatâ€™s all I had. These were so tasty and easy to make!

Wonderful texture, but very strong taste of molasses. I will edit recipe by substituting half the white sugar with brown sugar and possibly reducing the amount of molasses used.
