This cake tasted awesome.  When it comes to chocolate, the more the better for me, but this cake did not need icing or add-ins. Icing or chips would be overkill, nuts or coconut maybe.  It was extremely moist--great with a glass of milk.  My only problem was that the batter prepared as directed did cook over, so it wasn't very pretty the first time.  So the next time I made it, I kept about a cup and a fourth of the batter and made a half dozen cupcakes with it.  The cake stayed in the pan, the kids got cupcakes, and I had delicious cake that was pretty, too! This recipe is good with any flavor box cake and icing.

Delicious!!! I actually made the cake in a 9x13 cake pan instead of the bundt, and it turned out perfect! It was moist and chocolately, but not too sweet. Very good recipe!

I love this recipe!  Made as is...the cake is moist, rich and delicious.  The same can be said for the many variations that can be made, by simply varying the type of frosting, cake mix and/or liquid. (Spice cake mix, caramel frosting and water/butterscotch schnapps was fantastic.)  Bea, thank you for my new favorite, fast cake recipe!

I made this with lemon mix and lemon frosting.  I happen to have this on hand.  Excellent result.  Very moist.  I did leave out some batter from my 12 cup pan...I had just cleaned the oven and did not need to do it again.  Made 6 cupcakes and all was wonderful...thank you!

This is the best cake. All my friends love it. I have tried other flavors of cake and frosting and they're all good. You must grease the pan very well. I also sometimes add chocolate chips and walnuts.

This cake was a big hit with my co-workers over the holidays and so easy to make. Try adding a couple of tablespoons of coffee liqueur and decrease the water by about a tablespoon.  I have also made this cake with milk chocolate cake mix and milk chocolate frosting, then add 1 cup of milk chocolate chips, and this is also very good.

More like a moist, fudgy brownie than a chocolate pound cake, but who cares about the name when it tastes this good?!?  I added nuts (about a cup) and it came out perfectly.  I almost took some out for cupcakes since others had problems with overflowing, but now I think their bundt pans may have been too small; even with a cup of nuts added, this came out great. I would not add more than one cup of additions or even the 10 inch might overflow.  Came back to get the recipe, I am going to try Lemon Supreme cake with Lemon Supreme icing. Update: The lemon came out much more like pound cake than the chocolate and was just as delicious.  I replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce when I have it, and it tastes equally as yummy and is healthier.

I make this cake as directed but when it is warm, I use a wooden spoon handle to push holes in it about half inch deep all over the cake. Let cool completely. I then use a jar of caramel topping and pour all over the cake. I refrigerate the cake for about 1 hour, then frost with a jar of hot fudge topping. You will need a gallon of milk to get through a piece of it though!

This is a very quick and easy cake and comes out very "chocolately" and very moist! A nice recipe to have on hand for last minute baking for company or bake sales. For my neighbor who loves white chocolate, I melted some and used that as a glaze on top. I will take the advice of others to flour the pan as well as using spray, since one time I was stuck keeping it(but that was Okay, Yum!) because it did stick in the pan even though my bundt pan is teflon.

This cake was awesome! the only thing I did different was to substitute coffee for the water. I thought it really brought out the chocolate flavor even more! Will definately make this again.

This is such a great recipe. I did only one tweek, I used cooking spray and then dusted pan with cocoa(unsweetend) instead of flour, makes for a much cleaner looking cake out of the pan and adds a another layer of chocolate flavor as well.

I'm amazed that this has a 4 star rating. It's not a good recipe and this is definitely NOT a pound cake as it's titled.

I was expecting a denser (sp?) cake since it's called "pound" cake.  But, it was melt in your mouth moist.  Everyone at our church supper oo'ed and awed... thought we should have an altar call after the meal!!!  After seeing the reviews of overflow problems I used two lasagna foil pans for one batch.  Made two nice sided cakes.  I tried lemon and chocolate fudge... wowzer they were good.  Sprinkled with powder sugar for looks.

I was skeptical, but this turned out great. I baked 2 8" and one 9" layer and it was moist and delicious! I did have to watch the baking times since I wasn't using a tube pan.

This was very good and had a very nice rich flavor, however it lacks the texture of a pound cake.  My daughters called it a "brownie-cake" it had a very similar taste to brownies, however a lighter, more moist texture.  It did rise more than I anticipated, and I did make some cupcakes.  Next time if I make cupcakes I will fill them lower than usual as it overflowed a little and they did not rise with a mound in the center like regular cupcakes.

This has got to be the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! I used a cast iron bundt pan and baked it at 325 degrees. I drizzled the finished cake with a thinned caramel frosting. YUM! I made it for a birthday get together and I'll make it again and again! Maybe I'll experiment with other cake flavors and frostings!

This was pretty tasty for a cake mix cake. When I checked it at 60 minutes though, it was done (over done actually) and I had to trim off some burnt crusty edges. I think this would be good also with a German chocolate cake mix and german chocolate frosting mixed in. I may try that next time cake mix and frosting are on sale!

This is a great recipe to have on hand when you don't have the time to bake from scratch. I used a devil's food cake mix, and substituted butter for the oil. Next time I'll use a butter recipe fudge cake mix b/c oil -based cake mixes taste a bit bland to me. I also used the chocolate ganache recipe from this site as a glaze. It turned out to be a very fudgey and rich chocolate cake, and is now a permanent fixture in my recipe book!

Made this cake for a coworker's transfer party, and again to take on vacation. It was a big hit both times. One warning though, I tried it another time with the "whipped" canned icing, and it wasn't as good. This is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe!

This tasted great but was kind of unattractive in the pan so a added Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site to the top; it set up well and hid the defects. I baked this cake in a 9 x 13 glass pan for 55 minutes. However, I gave this recipe only 4* b/c it wasn't a pound cake; it was just a really good chocolate cake. Anyway, this dessert went over very well, but its very rich so don't cut too big a piece for yourself:) I'll be making this easy cake again I'm sure!!!

This recipe gets rave reviews when I serve it to friends and family. I have also tried it with other flavor cakes mixes. Yellow cake mix and vanila frosting also great.  I will cntinue to make this cake for a long time. So moist and flavorful. You will not believe how easy it is.

Good chocolate flavor.  Didn't hold together well.  Family didn't appreciate that the frosting was inside and needed frosting on top too.  Won't be making again.

Very moist and delicious. Take heed of all the suggestions to spray/oil and flour the pan, as I only sprayed mine and it didn't come out very well.

So easy to make and tastes great. I did add chocolate glaze to the top which of course made it a triple chocolate threat.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  I took it to a meeting of 20 people and there wasn't enough to go around.  Some people had 2 pieces and wanted a third piece!  It's awesome.  Thanks a bunch.

Wonderful recipe.. everyone was asking for the recipe and it tasted and looked as though I spent more time on it than I actually did.. I topped it with powdered sugar and mmmm .. I also used fudge frosting with chocolate chips as that is all I had. Great recipe

I got a coupon for a free container of frosting with the purchase of a cake mix, so I used it.  I rarely buy cake mixes, and never frosting, but was glad to have it on hand for this recipe. The cake turned out just great.  I read ALL the reviews before making it, so I made the following changes. Used french vanilla cake mix and chocolate frosting. Instead of 1 1/3 cups water, I used 1 cup water and 1/3 cup coffee liqueur and threw in about 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I put the bundt pan on a cookie sheet, just in case, and got about 9 cupcakes out of the additional batter. I made sure to grease and flour the pan really well, which worked fine, the cake popped right out. We loved it!

I give this 3 stars, even if this cake is so delicious. I had a 12 cup bundt pan and it still made a huge mess!! The other missing star is because the cake got stuck in the pan, even when I greased it a lot! Otherwise, yum!

This was the first cake I tried from this site.
My husband loved it!  It was so good I made him take it to work so I wouldn't eat the rest of it - he shared it with a co-worker who wanted seconds right away!  Made it in a 10 inch pan and it was fine; a little denser perhaps but tasty - didn't frost it; didn't need to.  Excellent!

So delicious! But I encountered a problem in that the cake split in several places. It didn't look beautiful but it was indeed delicious.

Sooo easy! Yes it is a box cake, I have been there done that scratch cake stuff.  When one works why scratch...I would if I had the time. I followed the directions completely using a 10" by 4" angle food cake pan.  I guess my only complaint was it was a little dry so drizzle with what ever you like or as we did drizzle and a scoop of homemade ice cream.  I definatley will make this cake again.  Using different mixes sounds like a great idea, for instance the strawberry cake and the lemon cake mixes.I give it a 4.5 because it is not dense enough to be a pound cake.

Blah! This was no different then making a regular cake adding an extra egg and putting the icing in the cake instead ontop, which you still need more icing to put on top. Kids liked it of course but personally I won't be making this again... too bland.

I have made this cake several times and everyone just loves this recipe. I have made strawberry flavor for a birthday party made them into cupcakes and topped with a cream cheese frosting. People were wanting more :) Made the lemon flavor WOW this flavor was the best !! I used a deep dish 13 x 9 pan. I made home made cream cheese frosting with lemon extract and added a few drops of yellow food coloring.  Everyone LOVED this cake. A big hint Keep the cake cold. What a hugh differnce it makes. This is a great recipe !!

I'm sorry, but we didn't care for this cake at all. I had to use a vanilla cake mix w/ vanilla icing becuase that is what I had.  But otherwise I made it as directed.  It turned out more like a bread pudding cake and we can't stand the texture of bread pudding.  Now if you like bread pudding then this might be the cake for you!  I ended up throwing it all away and making something else.  If you do make this, make sure you grease your pan very well. I did, but it still stuck in the pan and came out in clumps.

I was disappointed with this cake. I think it still tasted like box cake and don't even bother with the frosting I couldn't even taste it. I give 3 stars because of ease but I will not make again.

This was tasty, but I wouldn't say it qualifies as a pound cake - it has the weight and texture of boxed cake, not the density of pound cake.

Several folks suggested adding chocolate chips - I tried this and it ruined the recipe.  The chips sank to the bottom of the batter once I put it in the oven, and the chips melted and adhered to the pan.  In spite of my greasing and flouring the pan, the chips portion stuck in a clump and took off the top of the cake when I popped it out.  I cut up the remaining cake into slices and spread them on a platter sprinkled with powdered sugar so it was presentable.  It was good, but not a pound cake.

What a disppointment! I expected something special and it just tastes like a boxed cake, but more oily. All those extra frosting calories added for nothing. It also made a mess in the oven. The batter measured fine into the pan but it oozed over during baking. Don't waste your time on this one.

Makes a very moist and tasty cake.  Lighter than pound cake, but very good.  I used melted butter in place of the oil -- just my preference.  I have made it three times in the last 2 weeks!

Let me preface by saying that I did not follow the instructions exactly and nothing irritates me more than when someone doesn't follow the instructions and then gives a recipe a low rating.  That being said, the way that I made it I would only give it a 4.  I will describe my changes so you can prepare if you plan on making changes:
- I wanted to make a layer cake, and I thought that with this being a pound cake, it would work perfectly.  It actually was just as fluffy and light as a normal cake, not the density I was seeking.
- The store that I went to only had a box of store bought Devil's Food cake mix that was the appropriate size.  All of the name brand boxes were about 4 oz. smaller, I thought that might have a crucial impact on the end result.  
- I baked mine in 2-8 inch rounds at 350 degrees.  They were done in less than 40 minutes.
Overall, I would make this cake again.  The taste was nice and although it wasn't the density I was looking for, it was extremely moist.  I really wish that I had not frosted the cake and just dusted it with powdered sugar.  I LOVE frosting but I used store bought and it really took away from the cake.

This recipe was disappointing.  It probably would've been better to just make the cake and add the frosting on top.

Good chocolate cake.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter for some extra chocolate, baked it in a 10" spring form pan for 70 minutes and frosted the top with chocolate fudge frosting.  5 thumbs up.

I made this for an auction and it went for $450.00.  I used a wheat free, gluten free cake mix called Pamela's Luscious Chocolate Cake and Dr. Oetker Organics Chocolate Icing Mix 
I made it again for a MOP's Moms meeting and received rave reviews. This is the best chocolate pound cake recipe I've ever made that's NOT from scratch!
