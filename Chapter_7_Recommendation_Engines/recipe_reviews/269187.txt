I wasn't sure I was going to love the flavor combo in this but it turned out excellent! I made exactly as written except that it didn't end up needing the cornstarch. Leave the lid off of the IP while your pork is resting and the gravy will thicken up perfectly on its own. Definitely a keeper!

Note that the recipe is only for a 1 lb. pork tenderloin. Takes a lot longer for the typical 2-3 lb. tenderloin. But the flavor was wonderful.

I did not put in fresh sliced onion or onion soup mix. I used about a tsp of dried onion bits, 1 tbsp of regular mustard and most of a can of cranberry sauce. My roast was only a bit over a pound. I pressure cooked it on high for 9 minutes; let it release and then gave it another 9 minutes. I am sure it was cooked after the first session, but wanted it a bit more tender. The sauce cooked down with no cornstarch with about 7 minutes on Saute set at medium. It was a hit with my fairly picky other half who never eats cranberries! Next time I make it will likely be with a home canned cranberry-orange sauce I make when the berries are in season. :)

I had NO tarragon...couldnt find any. So., I used nothing but the other ingredients. The dish was remarkable. My entire family absolutely loved it I used a bigger roast and set the pot for 20 minutes instead of 9...it was perfect. Thank you, so much!

The taste was great, but this recipe needs work.  I used the 6-quart Instant Pot and followed the directions as given.  At first, there was not enough liquid in the pot and the  machine gave an alarm and posted "Hot"  After I figured out what that meant, I added some water and re-started it using the 9-minute high pressure cycle as directed. It went through the cycle , including the "natural" pressure release. By this time, I was nearly an hour into it, but the meat was still way under-cooked by internal temperature (

My son gave me my Instant Pot  for Christmas. This was the first recipe I tried in it. It was delicious! I was unable to find any fresh tarragon at all so substituted dry and using 2 tsp instead of 2 tbsp. I will definitely make this again!

It made quite a bit of sauce/gravy that we put over rice.  I did not have tarragon on hand and it still was great!

Wow! I happened to have cranberry sauce left over from Thanksgiving. I found this recipe and thought, why not? Amazingly delicious. I used about a 3 pound pork loin so I cooked it for 20 min and did the 10 min slow release for steam. The only other change I made was using dried terragon, so I lessened it to only 1 tbsp. My family raved about this dish. I will definitely make it again. Thanks! Photo is from the leftovers, looks prettier fresh out of the pot.
