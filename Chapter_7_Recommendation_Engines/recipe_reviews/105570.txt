Wish I could split the rating on this because the topping was so delicious, but the meatloaf itself needed some serious help. There are virtually no seasonings listed in the recipe which is rather unusual. I didn't see the need for both bread crumbs and saltines, so I skipped the crackers. A whole onion, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, dried parsley and worcestershire sauce went into the meat mixture. The end result was very tasty but I truly suggest you tweak and add seasonings to your liking because the glaze alone is worth trying. Thank you!

I have no idea how i can mess up a simple meatloaf recipe but for some reason, the texture of this meatloaf was unappealing. I, like the other reviewer added a lil pineapple to my meat mixture and thought maybe that had an effect on the texture. I dont know what else could have happened. It was almost unedible to be honest. Have no idea what went wrong. I will attempt this again just because im a lil baffled. On a positive note the sauce was AMAZING! A lil to sweet so i will cut back on sugar next time but other than that it was amazing. I used real bacon instead of the bits. If anything, i will continue to use the sauce for my meatload topping.

Loved this recipe, and my whole family loves it too!  Even my teenagers, who turn their nose up at the mention of the words meat and loaf in the same sentence, ate this like they hadnt' eaten in weeks.  Great recipe - I only changed one thing - I used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  Nummy!

My family loved this meatloaf.  The pineapple tastes great on a warm day.  I added a few crushed pineapples in with the meat mixture as well.  Yum!!

Love this! I thought that it needed something in the meat mixture as well.  So I added ketchup, worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and green pepper.  I also cut out the crackers and used chips instead and used real bacon.

I have never left a review for anything on this site. I never felt like anything was really worth writting about but THIS IS AWESOME! I will never need another meatloaf recipe ever again. Even my daughter who is going through a "no meat" phase ate every bite! THANK YOU!!!!!

I make meatloaf all of the time, but have never followed a recipe before.  The only change that I made in this was to skip the bacon.  I really liked this and would make it again, but my husband wasn't crazy about it.  He prefers meatloaf without any topping.  Thought that this one might win him over, but no such luck.

I used this recipe bc I had recently lost a recipe that called for pineapple preserves in the topping that my family LOVED!!!  I still used the preserves along with the ketchup and brown sugar....Still the topping was delicious once again!!!   I did choose to juice up the meatloaf recipe however, this one is a  little bland for my taste buds.  I added garlic salt, a dash of pickle relish, lots of onion and 2 cloves of garlic.   Altogether, my family LOVED this!!!!

This is the best meatloaf in the whole world. I would suggest putting sliced bread at the bottom to soak up some of the grease.

This meatloaf was very good.  I was worried the hubby wouldn't like it because of the pineapple, but the pineapple/bacon/ketchup mixture was really delish.  He said it was a "nice change" from regular meatloaf.  I'll make this one again!

The pineapple topping was wonderful! I thought the meatloaf itself lacked flavor though. Next time I will use my usual meatloaf recipe with this recipe's topping.

It is a tall statement, best in the whole wide world and, some will disagree but, we have made, over the years, I can't tell you how many meatloaf recipes we have tried. This has to be one of the best!

FOLLOWED EXACTLY EXCEPT CRUMBLED MY OWN BACON, MEAT HAS A SMOKEY TASTE TO IT- NOT BAD, (ALOT BETTER THAN OTHER RECIPIES I'VE FOUND ON HERE) IF THAT SMOKEY TASTE TURNS YOU OFF MAKE THE TOPPING AND PUT IT ON YOUR OWN MEATLOAF,  KIDS LOVED IT

4.5 stars for the topping.  I used my own spice blend and added chopped green pepper to the meat mixture.  Doubled the ground beef for a larger meatloaf, thus increased all of the ingredients.

The only change I made was that I had 1/2 a cup of chopped bacon, so added 1/4 cup to the meatloaf and the other 1/4 cup to the glaze.  Very tasty! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I had been lokking for a new Meatloaf recipe that was not boring.  This recipe was amazing..

I did make a few changes.. I used 1/2 Turkey burger + 1/2 spicy pork sausage to mix it up a bit.

I have made this several times and usually make 2 so I can freeze one and bake it later. 

This is our go to Meatloaf recipe now.

I love this recipe. Instead of using saltine crackers I use butter crackers. I dice a whole onion and add it. I use ground venison instead of beef. I’m going to make it today and add in a chopped jalapeño and either cheddar cheese or goat cheese. Yum!!!

I tweaked the meatloaf and made it how I usually make it and followed the sauce recipe exactly. It was delish. Highly recommend doing it this way. My kids loved it too.

Yes I will make this again. It was delicious. Added salt and pepper in with the meat. Ran out of ketchup for the glaze so I used honey BBQ sauce, teriyaki sauce a dash of soy and Worcestershire sauce. Made the sauce caramelize on top of the meatloaf!

Out of the ballpark! Husband kept going back for seconds, thirds,... Until I made this my favorite meatloaf was the "Brown Sugar Meatloaf," which is delicious. But this one might have been even better!  Not only scrumptious but has a great mouth feel and texture!   
I doubled the recipe. For the glaze, I used diced turkey bacon instead of bacon bits and added a heaping teaspoon of Bacon Jam for good measure. For the meat, I took the advice of reviewers and added spices including garlic powder, onion powder, a little "sopping sauce" and Adams House Seasoning. The time given was perfect! Best Meatloaf Ever!

This is the tastiest meatloaf ever. My family got bored with the more traditional meatloaf I used to make so we tried this one. Delicious!

Very good recipe and I agree with others in that there could be a little more herbs/spices in the mix and that there was no need for the bacon.  Didn't seem to add anything except calories.  Not sure why both bread crumbs and crackers, so I would say use whatever you like.  Like the use of pineapple for a little different flavor.

You know I got to be honest I really don't like meatloaf.  With that said I have it about once every 3 years but I lost my recipes and went searching the Internet for best meat loaf and this was the first one I selected (I had most of the ingredients.)
I am a very good cook I believe and I added some seasonings without really thinking about it lol. I didn't think anything of it.
I didn't have. Worchceshire or pineapple, nor do I use beef. Instead I had turkey. I t was too lean so I added a tblsp each of butter and and olive oil. For seasonings I used about a tsp of chicken stock ( good stuff in the jar ) and about 2 tsp of beef stock.  And I used dried cherries in place of  pineapple. 
Wow.  I really liked the texture. I think it mainly came from  both the bread crumbs (I used panko)  and saltines. 
I know I use some ngredients others may not but what I can say is this. ...
This is by far the BEST meatloaf I've ever made, and most likely ever eaten.   I had two huge pieces which I  NEVER do. It's definately the sauce....suprising really.  I will most definately use the recipe again. I joined this site only to make this review .... something else I never do. 
I SERVED IT OVER MASHED POTATOES AND ADDED A DOLLOP OF SOUR CREAM SINCE GRAVEY WASN'T A GOOD CHOICE THIS TIME .
HATS OFF TO THE COOK WHO CAME UP WITH THAT SAUCE!!

This is a great recipe.  I did add a few things based upon the comments BUT I think that it would still be good as is...so 5 stars.  My additions were to add a pound of ground sausage, use Italian Bread Crumbs and no crackers, fry a half of a pound of bacon and then saute' a whole onion and 1/2 of a bell pepper in the bacon grease.  I reserved some of the bacon for the topping and added the rest to the meat mixture.  Because I doubled the meat, I doubled all of the ingredients... plus more garlic and a shot of Texas Pete's Hot Sauce. I used a 8oz can of crushed pineapple and didn't drain it at all...just used the whole thing!   I made mini meatloaves so that I could freeze them for later.  (There are only two of us!)  Super yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very flavorful and good, but I don't know if I would rank it "the best".  However, it is definitely approved by a 5 year old; my husband said the meat was good, but the topping was a little too sweet for him.  Here's a small tip for anyone who is in a hurry...instead of preparing the topping first, start by preparing the meat first, so that while the meat is in the oven for 30 min, THEN you can be multi-tasking and mixing the topping. It saved me several minutes! Also, I think that next time, I would put the bacon in the meat, rather than on top.  The flavor of the bacon got completely lost in all of the sweetness.  Overall it was a fun little recipe to try.  Thanks!

I did add some extra seasoning because I was worried it would be bland after reading some reviews and looking at the recipe.  I added a few tablespoons of bbq sauce in the meat mixture, some extra pineapple, some ground chipotle powder and some salt & pepper.  That made a huge difference and gave it a nice subtle kick.  I also added the chipotle powder to the glaze mixture.  Another trick that I adapted from another recipe was instead of using the crackers/bread crumbs, I took some garlic croutons and pulsed them in the food processor until they were coarse crumbs.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a great recipe!!  My husband was skeptical because he does not like cooked fruit, but he loved it.  One suggestion, something I'll try next time, is to add cayenne pepper or jalapenos or some type of spice to the meat that way it's sweet and spicy.

First time I made this it was good and had moistness to it.  I made it again and did something, not sure what, but it turned out a little dry.  Will continue to use this recipe...and tweak it a little bit...  Thanks All Recipes!!!
