I've made this several times as it is SO good!  I took other reviewers advice and used only 2 c. rice cereal.  I didn't have chocolate chips so I substituted 4 oz. semi-sweet chocolate.  I also could not find 5 oz. cans of sweetened condensed milk so used a full 14 oz. can.  I took Cookiesprite's suggestion for the topping and melted 1 oz. semi-sweet chocolate and dded 1 tbsp. of butter to make the chocolate coating for the top. The last few times I have reduce the peanut butter to 1/2 c., as it was a little to peanut-buttery for us, and add an additional 4 oz. cream cheese.  We really like the crust, by the way! Thank you Angel!

No rice krispies on hand, I made an Oreo cookie crust from scratch. I kept to the recipe otherwise. Most of the ingredients I found cheaply at Grocery Outlet, so it wasn't expensive to make. I did use Super-Chunk peanut butter and I sprinkled the top with chopped honey-roasted peanuts. I don't care for peanut butter and chocolate and I liked this, as did my husband, whose a Reese's fanatic. I think using the homemade whipped cream really makes it good. NOTE: This is a VERY rich pie. Make sure you cut small wedges of this and share with your friends/family! This would be great for a potluck or family dinner.

I, also, decreased the cereal to 2 cups and increased the chocolate chips.  I used cool whip instead of whipped cream because I was concerned that the whipped cream would get runny.  I also chopped and toasted some fresh peanuts to sprinkle on top.  Overall very good.

we thought this was wonderful.  I make a very similar pie with peanut butter filling and a crushed chocolate wafer crust.  The crust definately makes this pie.  I took the advise to reduce the rice crispies to about 1 3/4 cups and increased the chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate) to about 1 1/4 cups.  next time I would probably reduce the whipped cream to 3/4 c to give a little firmer texture.  we also left this in the refridgerator instead of freezer.  was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW!! Incredible! It IS very rich but its soooo good! the rice krispy crust tastes like a crunch chocolate bar and it compliments the peanut butter cake so well! Absolutely incredible!  BE WARNED THOUGH, only have a small amount, it IS VERY rich and heavy in the belly.

Hi, I'm sitting at the computer eating a piece of this now so thought I'd rate the pie.  My finacee, who is also eating a piece right now says 5 stars are in order.  The only thing I changed when I made this was I didn't have any vanilla, probably would have been better with it.  And I didn't have any chocolate sauce so I took milk chocolate chips, which I used for the base also, and melted them in the microwave with some butter, about a tablespoon or two to a half cup, or you could use regular oil, kind of like you do when making a coating to dip truffles in.  Then I drizzled this over the top of the pie and ran a wooden skewer through the chocolate to make a spiral spoke pattern then again making lines like cutting a pie.  Not only was it pretty but the chocolate topping hardened to a softer version of a hard shell for ice cream.  Sauce or this topping it's all good!  I made this for a 15 year old boy's birthday and all the kids loved it, their mom said this recipe is great for ice cream, she has Celiacs and couldn't eat the crust so I put some filling into a bowl and topped it with the chocolate then froze it, she loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Cheers...

I made this pie for the first time for a party on the fourth of july.  It was a huge hit!  I will make this again, only I would suggest not using but 1 - 1 1/2 cups of rice crispies for the crust and substituting milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet ones.  2 1/2 cups makes the crust a little too thick for my taste, but the pie is delicious!

YUM! This was delicious! I do recommend taking it out of the freezer at least 15 minutes before serving. The chocolate was hard to slice through when completely frozen. I also increased the choc. chips to 1.25 cups and decreased the cereal to 1.5 cups. The crust was delicious and the peanut butter mixture was VERY CREAMY. This recipe is a keeper!

Hubs rates this four stars, which in any one else' rating system would most likely mean a five.  He is a huge fan of rich, decadent desserts, anything peanut butter/chocolate being one of his favorites.  Me, not so much, so it's difficult for me to review this with a whole lot of enthusiasm. He liked the contrast between the sweet, crunchy chocolate crust and the rich, but not too sweet, creamy peanut butter filling. I questioned the addition of the lemon juice, which just seems wrong with both peanut butter and with chocolate and even tho' neither of us could taste it, I still do.  I thought perhaps it was maybe to temper the sweetness of the filling, but I actually thought it could have been a little sweeter.  I did not freeze the pie, preferring it simply chilled instead.  Tho' I could take it or leave it, Hubs called this a "make again," and if I do I would prepare it the same way - but probably without the lemon juice.

This is really rich, but not in a good way.  I think it's got too much Sweetened Condensed Milk in it which takes out the peanut butter creamy texture and kind of makes it gummy.  The crust is very hard to cut through and even harder to bite into.

Delicious! The chocolate topping hardens into a delightful crunchy chocolate. Easy to make and looks great. I'd reduce rice cereal next time

This recipe was so fantastic and the way I presented it made it look especially mouth watering.  I brought it into friends at school and they couldn't stop eating it.  They came up with crazy names for it because they instantly became obsessed.  The one thing I changed is that instead of using crispy rice cereal I used Cocoa pebbles when making the crust.  I thought this tasted absolutely delicious just this way so I don't think I will change when the occasion comes to make it again. Purely fantastic.  I'm only a Senior in High School and people already can't wait to eat the next thing I bake all thanks to this recipe of deliciousness. :)

This is my first bad review, I was so disappointed with this recipe. First of all, WHY does this have lemon juice in it?! It gives it a tangy flavor that makes this pie taste like it went bad. Second, I have a huge sweet tooth but this pie was just too much. I used a regular graham cracker crust and substituted the chocolate on top with mini chocolate chips mixed it and it was still sickeningly sweet. Even my husband "the human garbage disposal" wont eat it.

Great recipe, although very rich. I used light cream cheese, light whipped cream, and fat-free chocolate sauce in an attempt to keep the calories down... but that didn't work out so well. It still tasted amazing but the calorie count was still through the roof :) While not something I would make every weekend, its definitely something I would make for a special occasion. The amount of sweetened condensed milk seems abit high, but it worked out. Kudos!

Pretty good, rich. Not sure why it calls for so much lemon juice. I used a tad bit and could taste it.

I made the recipe as is and was not impressed.  I made the mistake of making this recipe for the first time and brought it to 4th of July.  The people who tried it were polite and said it was "good" but I have a feeling they were just being nice.  The lemon juice was odd and the whole thing reminded me of one of the "fake" cheesecakes one would expect at a low budget buffet.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! So good, rich and easy! You will not be sorry you made this!  I made mine in a spring form pan and it looks so elegant when you take the sides off.

great pie. I would make it again. The pie is so creamy. Only set back is the crust gets so hard from the freezer that you can't hardly cut it. I put it in the refrigerator instead of the freezer and that seemed fine. Otherwise it tasted delicious.

I made it in a springform pan which made serving a breeze, but when it came out it looked so tiny.  Next time I will double the filling since it was gone in a flash anyway.  I served it with some store bought hot fudge sauce and chopped peanuts, like the picture shows.  It got gave reviews, thanks!

I am giving this a 5-star because it tasted awesome but I had trouble with it.  I followed the recipe exactly but I seemed to have a lot of the topping left over (like half a bowl).  Then I put it outside for over 4 hours (I am in Canada!  and the temperature was -15) and it didn't really freeze ... we finally ate it but it was just a soupy consistency but it tasted great, a bit rich but what do you expect from a cheesecake recipe.  I am not sure that I'd make again though.

I've made this about three times now and every time it comes out excellent! Everyone who tried it loved it, even the people who claimed they did not like cheesecake.

I did make one mistake with the crust the second time I made it. The chocolate with the rice krispies were too hot, so I mixed the cream cheese while waiting for the chocolate to cool. I let it cool too long and when I tried to put it in a pie plate it didn't want to stick together.

I doubled this recipe and put it into a 13 x 9 pan to serve more people.  It requires a great deal of freezer time for it to set up hard enough.  The taste is pretty good but not particularly a special recipe.  I did like the crust and plan to use it with other frozen pie recipes.

This recipe is awesome. I made it for Easter and there was none left. The changes that I made was that I only used 2 cups of cereal, like people suggested in past reviews. I used about 1 cup and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips instead of only 1 cup. I was pretty easy to mix. I didn't have a brender to mix it, so I had to mix it by hand. It takes alittle more work, but it came out fine. I also used the only 14 ozs of condensed milk. My husband is not a big fan of desserts and had 2 pieces of this. This is a make again in my book. Waiting to make it again. Thanks again A+

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed it exactly and it was delicious, but everyone thought the crust was "too much".  The second time I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and fat free whipped topping.  I also used a graham cracker crust on which I sprinkled some chopped up peanut butter cups (to counteract the fat free ingredients :)).  The fat free ingredients did not change the taste of the filling - it was still fabulous and everyone liked the graham cracker crust better.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

I made two of these for our family 4th of July BBQ and there was not a single piece left.  It was so yummy and easy, I have since e-mailed the recipe to three other people.  I do agree with the other reviewers who suggested using less rice crispies.  After reading their comments, I cut back to two cups and was glad I did.  I will probably use even a little less next time I make this (which will be soon!)  THANKS for a great recipe!

Delicious!! I recommend taking it out of the freezer at least 15 mins. before serving. (It was a little embarrasing when someone cut into it and lifted the whole thing out of the pie plate =) My first frozen cheesecake; we will definitely make it again!

This was a hit at my dinner party. I'm not a big dessert fan, so I didn't have any, but my guests enjoyed. I made a couple changes by mixing other user suggestions: I increased the chocolate chips to 1 3/4 c and decreased the rice crispies to about 1 1/4 cups.
I also didn't know if this would be good with cool whip so I used the KitchenAid and made homemade using the whipped cream recipe from the site simply titled "Whipped Cream". It included whipping cream, 1 T confectioners sugar and 1 t vanilla. I did use 1 cup whipping cream which yielded more than this recipe called for, but it worked out.
I also used a full 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk, I couldn't find a 5oz can.
For the topping, I used Breyers Chocolate Flavored Ice Cream Sauce.  I was hoping the container it comes in (that you can heat the sauce up in) would allow me to drizzle over the pie, but the spout is huge, so I melted it in the container it comes in, kneaded it to distribute the heat then poured it into a baggie, clipped the end and drizzled it over the pie before freezing.  It made a great presentation!

This was pretty good -- very rich.  The only thing I'd do differently would be to add less or maybe none of the lemon juice.  The end taste was a little to tart for me.  I'd probably also change the crust to an oreo crust, because our family really didn't like how hard the rice-krispie/chocolate crust turned out.  BUT- I still think the pie was great.

Loved this.  The cereal crust is clever, easy, and good.  Although, it is a bit hard to remove from the pan once the pie is frozen.  I had to let mine warm at room temperature for awhile before cutting a piece.  My peanut butter loving family loved the filling.  It is rich, but keeps nicely in the freezer for days, so you don't feel like you have to finish it quickly.

This is delicious. I left out the lemon juice and only used 1 can of milk. I found that if you also add some disolved gelatin it helps to keep it firm without freezing it. I got huge raves about the recipe and I am making it again for a friend's birthday.

I have made this twice now, the first time reducing the amount of cereal, the second time, using the full amount.  It was much easier to cut, with the full amount of cereal, chocolate wasnt so hard.  Good recipe, lots of compliments on it, will make again.

Great dish.  I made it this last weekend and I had rave reviews from all.  Some people thought I bought it and dind't make it.  I would recommend using a small puffed rice cereal though.  I used a larger grain and the crust was very card to cut and rather chewy.

I am 14 years old and I love baking. I made this for my dad who is a Reeses fan and he loved it. It has a nice cheesecake flavor and also is very peanut buttery. The crust is amazing and there was a little left over so I was eating it warm out of the pot. I would totally recommend this to anyone, peanut butter lover or not :)

This was a tasty recipe a few things to know:

1) The crust amazing! will use this again and again on other pies (very hard let come to room temp before biting or you may need dental work)
2)Very heavy and sweet but good if your in the mood
3) Instead of chocolate sauce I would use melted chocolate ( I felt the chocolate sauce took away from the dish giving it an artificial flavor and drippy as I made in small cup cakes instead of pie)

Otherwise an awesome recipe and would make again.

This was good and quite easy to make.  It is extremely rich for our tastes.  A little goes a long way.  The crust was interesting and quite tasty.  I was hoping for a stronger peanut butter flavor.  Thanks for sharing this decadent recipe, Ange_Shephard!

Delicious recipe! I substituted cool whip lite for the whipped cream to lighten it up and used lite cream cheese. Also, instead of crispy rice cereal with chocolate, I used chocolate graham cracker crust with butter. It was amazing!!!!! Chocolate graham cracker crust goes perfectly with the filling! I think next time I make this recipe, I will use more cool whip and less sweetened condensed milk to make it fluffier. Love it!

I made this for a cookout, use 2 cups of rice cereal, 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk, double the recipes and use 13x9 pan, and follow Cookiesprite's idea of melt butter and chocolate chip coating, really good.  it's rich, but really good. will use the crust recipes for something else too.

Have made it so many times now - so simple and fab - I do not even like peanuts or peanut butter... tastes like a snickers bar a bit. All my friends want the recipe after I have made it for them!

Completely irresistable! I used a bought graham cracker pie crust instead of making my own; I was bringing the ingredients with me and didn't want to bring any excess food. So I couldn't rate the crust, but the pie is wonderful! Excellent peanut butter taste for pb fans!

My husband and I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate.  While we loved the creaminess of the peanut butter mixture.  WE were not fans of the rice krispies crust. I will try next time a granola or cookie crust.  I also put in cool whip instead of whipped cream.  Overall very good.  I also made it into bars.  I  have a pan that is not as big as a 9x13, the ratio worked well in that size.

This cheesecake is amazing!    My only suggestion is that you make sure you read over the recipe carefully (which I usually do), as I missed the fact that the two cans of sweetened condensed milk we suppose to be 5oz. cans...not the two 14 oz. cans that I had in my pantry (Yikes!  Who knew sweetened condensed milk even came in 5 oz. cans!?).  I just tripled the recipe and made 1 huge cheesecake in my springform pan (with a doubled crust recipe) and 1 small cheesecake in a pre-prepared crust pan.  So, all turned out okay in the end!    Rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious despite my error!

Yikes, intense!  This is as rich as they come.  It didn't have a very strong cheesecake flavor, more like a cream pie I'd say.  I used about 1-3/4 cups chocolate chips (half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet) and about 2 cups of rice krispies.  The crust was delicious but was frozen solid into the pan and made the pieces really hard to get out without making a big mess.  I made my own whipped cream without sweetening it in an attempt to lighten up the filling.  Still super sweet.  And instead of fudge sauce on top, I had some Hershey's Special Dark syrup on hand, but it didn't occur to me that it doesn't freeze.  Whoops.  So that made it a little messy to wrap and travel with after the rest of the pie was frozen....which, by the way, never happened entirely, at least not in the projected time scale.  Four hours to freeze?  Not even close.

I made this recipe for the 4th of July, and at a BBQ the next week, and both times it gave rave reviews!  It didn't sit long enough to get melted.  I did make one change- I used a peanut butter chip/chocolate chip blend for the crust.  Also, using a springform pan and adding some additional rice cereal to form a higher crust makes it look like it came from a bakery.  I will definately make this again.

I brought this to a Fourth of July party and it was a big hit. When making the crust I used 1/2 a cup semi sweet chocolate and 1/2 cup peanut butter chocolates to give the crust more depth(I bet the butterscotch flavored ones would work well too).

I made this recipe as directed. The filling was great. For those questioning, the purpose of the lemon juice is that it chemically reacts with the sweetened condensed milk to make a thicker filling. I could not taste it at all. I think if I make this in the future I will do a different crust. This crust was difficult to eat because it became so solid in the freezer.

Great recipe! . The comments from everyone were extremely helpful. Definitely less Rice Krispies, the thinner crust is better (1-3/4 cups). I also cut the lemon juice in half. It's hard to cut through the frozen crust, so I refrigerated it after it froze for 4 hours and it was great.

I made this cheesecake for a party last month and it was phenomenal. Even the non-sweet eaters tried a bite. The only thing I did differently was instead of drizzling the fudge sauce over the pie, I marbled it.

This taste divine. All I'd change is only 2 cups of rice crispies. And grease your pie pan w bakers joy or butter or something. Without it being greased, you have to pry it out of the pie pan. Lesson learned.

This was very rich. I'm a HUGE cheesecake fan but wasn't a big fan of this. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best cheesecake ever. I substituted a cookie crust for the one made in the recipe. I would recommend serving  this in tiny amounts, because it is so rich. I cut myself a typical sized piece of pie and had trouble finishing it. Over all it was an okay dessert.

Very rich.  I even cut the whipped cream back as suggested.  I made it in a 8x11 pan and the crust was very thick and hard to cut through.  The topping  was very soft in contrast.  I think I will try this again, but instead of a 8x11, I will do it in a 9x13 to spread the crust out a bit more.

Yummy. This was a request for my youngest son's bday. I made as written except I omitted the lemon juice. Instead of the fudge sauce I used an entire bottle of fudge flavor magic  shell.   
That crust is so good.   I put it in a 9 in spring form pan.

after a few changes to the recipe this was INCREDIBLE.

I only used 1 1/2 cups of rice krispies and 1 1/3 cups of chocolate chips for the crust ... and it was surprisingly easy to cut even after sitting in the freezer over night! 

I only used 2 splashes of lemon juice and I didn't have any whip cream so I put in a little extra cream cheese. I will be making this again!

My husband and I snuck a few slices 2hrs into freezing and while it was still good, it wasn't as good as it was this morning when it had the entire night the set... OMG ...yum!

This was good, but be advised, it is very rich and you will only need a small sliver of a piece.   Also, next time I would use less fudge topping as I found myself scraping some off.

well i think i used the wrong milk because the filling was not sweet, and i had enough filling that i ended up making 3 pies, so that really sucks that it didnt turn out great, definately cut back on the rice crispies, that was part of the problem to much crust and not enough room for filling, the crust was really good though, other then that i will have to try this again.

This was amazing!!I changed a few things to make it more healthy and you could not tell that anything was lowfat. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, Fat free cool whip and low fat cream cheese.I also used a store bought oreo crust to save time. It worked really well with the peanut butter flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

I would give 4 stars but everyone loved them so much - this has to have 5.  I took them to work for a going away party - they got beyond wonderful reviews.  I made my own whipped cream for them, so it was a bit more tedious - but worth it. I used the 2 1/2 cups of crispies as called for - I also tripled the recipe and would suggest for easy of cutting to put it in a square or rectangular pan lined with wax paper hanging over the pan, by doing that I was able to remove them before they were totally frozen and ran a super-sized pizza cutter thru to cut them, returned them to the pan and let them freeze solid.  The next morning, all I had to do was break them apart and they peeled so nicely off the wax paper - I will definitely be making these again.

I thought this was a great easy recipe. I'm not crazy about all the chocolate in the rice crispy crust so next time I'd probably switch it out for a gram cracker crust!

My 10 year old requested this recipe for his birthday party instead of a cake. He was so happy with his decision. This is the best cheesecake I have ever made. It was so creamy and so tasty. The peanut butter really shone through. I used hot fudge on the top and then ran a knife through it to make a pretty design. Everyone at the party enjoyed it. They said it was better than birthday cake. I will definitely make it again and again.

This was really easy to make, but the flavor wasn't as good as I had hoped. I might make it again. I may have to just play around with it to figure out how to make it taste right.

This pie was delicious!  Rich and decadent tasting, and very easy to make. Only change I made was to use a store bought pre-made chocolate crust to cut down the prep time. Can't wait to make it again!

This is one of my favorite desserts.  It is so refreshing, and the crust made from rice crispies is out of this world.  I usually use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat sweetened condensed milk to save on calories and it is still delicious.  I have made this so many times, and it always comes out great!

Despite all the reviews, I thought this recipe was not worth the effort (or the calories), as it just didn't taste good.  It tasted like one of those pre-made, bought in bulk desserts at a wannabe classy restaurant.  The crust was okay, but the filling tasted like sour peanutty cream that was frozen.  I like all the ingredients... just not mixed up like this-- I would not attempt this recipe again.

Decreased the rice krispies to 2 cups and followed the rest of the recipe to the T.  Impressive, simple dessert.  Couldn't stop eating it, which is the only reason I haven't made it since.  It is a very special treat!  Awesome!

This was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I'll use one of those prepared chocolate graham cracker crusts because the chocolate chips harden so much in the freezer, although my brother-in-law will be disappointed because that was his favorite part!

This was excellent.  I made this for my hubby on Valentines and he loved it.  I do not like cheesecake, but this definetly was a good compromise.  The crust is delicious.  I used 2 cups of cereal ...and thought it was the perfect thickness.  Thanks for a great recipe  ...I'm looking forward to making it again.
