This was a very flavorful marinade.  The london broil came out very tender.  I didn't add any salt because the soy sauce is salty enough for us.  This will definitely be in the rotation!

LOVED THIS!  Yes, truly!  I used the exact ingredients except went short on the salt, but I didn't need to.  I would not cook this meat as written, however, as you can tell by my photo!  When cut in thin slices, this meat as rare is perfect!  It is a perfect recipe!  Thank you so much!  This will be a repeat for sure---maybe this week!

AMAZING! Made exactly as recipe called for. I let it
 marinate for 7 hours and the flavor was delish! The hubby said one of the best steaks he has ever had.

I didn't have any Dijon mustard but used some honey mustard I had. I marinaded a flank steak for about 40 hours. The steak was moist and flavorful. The only change I would make is cooking the steak for 4-6 (vice 6-8) minutes/side. I prefer my flank steaks a bit more rare  (medium/rare) versus medium.

Loved this recipe. Only had time to marinade for 30 minutes and it was delicious! Want to try it again with more marinating time. This is a keeper.

Absolutely outstanding! I had a 2 pound flank steak, so the cooking time was 3 minutes longer for it to come out medium rare.  Other than that I used yellow mustard because that was all we had in the house. The flavor was terrific and the smell of the steak, while it was resting, just made my mouth water.  Not only will we have this again, we'll try the marinate on some other things as well.

Used Pomegranate Balsamic Vinegar as it was all I had on hand.  Wasn't crazy about the taste of the marinade, but let the steak marinate in the fridge for 2 days.  Really like the results.

This recipe was awesome and super easy. I marinated a top sirloin overnight and threw it on the charcoal grill.  Cooked it med rare. After serving it to guests with corn on the cob and grilled asparagus, everyone thought I was a genius!  One friend whispered to me to send the recipe to his wife!!  I followed recipe exactly-except for the onions (a guest doesn't like them) and the steak was soooo tender and delicious.  Many thanks for posting this.

Very good, but still doesn't reach the level of my mother-in-law's, which is the reason for the 4-star rating.  I did, however, like the contrast of the balsamic; I think it really stood out in the dish, in a good way.  This is easy to throw together and will probably make again.  It's a healthier alternative to those flank marinades with brown sugar.

Marinated my flank steak 2 days, turning the Ziploc bag over after the first day.  Grilled it to 140 degree internal temperature and then covered it and let stand for 5 minutes.  OMGosh is this delicious!  Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent marinade! I used a couple tablespoons of dried minced onion instead of the 1/2 cup of fresh. Will definitely use this again.

Absolutely fabulous! Followed the recipe as precisely as I ever do (I don’t measure, I eyeball), cooked it over charcoal, and it turned out incredibly delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe as written, however I doubled it and marinated two large flank steaks.  I would recommend marinating it at least 4 hours, preferably more, to get the most of the yummy flavors soaked into the meat.

Delicious and I liked that it didn’t have sugar s in it.  Much richer with deep flavors and the rosemary is so good with beef!

I don't know that I have ever rated a recipe on www.allrecipes.com, despite relying on others' reviews for years. This steak was so easy and delicious that I feel compelled to rave about it. I threw it together last minute (with no changes) and expected mediocrity (simply because I put so little time and effort into it). What I got was fine restaurant quality steak. WOW! This will be a front runner entree for our family moving forward.

Wow, this is good!  After searching the site,  I selected this recipe as I had all the ingredients on hand. I used fresh rosemary.  I only had about 5 hours to marinate the steak by the time I came across the recipe, and that was more than enough.   The meat was very flavorful on it's own, but I boiled the marinade and drizzled it over the cooked meat for added flavor - yum! Definitely will be making this again!!!

A family favorite!   It makes an excellent flank steak (the longer you can marinate it, the better!), but I also use it as a marinade for chicken breasts, steak kebobs (usually sirloin) and pork tenderloin.  Sometimes I leave the onions out, but I prefer the flavor with the onions.  So yummy!  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  Marinated the steak for 3 hours and used fresh rosemary and balsamic vinegar dressing.  It was perfect and so tender!  I then used the leftover meat for steak tacos the next day and it was also delicious!

This was a very easy and flavorful recipe.  Marinaded overnight 
and grilled  out on charcoal fire. Made  recipe exactly as presented. The steak was delicious. My wife  absolutely love the 
flavor and was truly excited about the meal. Served with corn on the cob, sliced tomatoes, and barbecue baked beans. Wow, 
what a summer treat. Thank you for sharing!

I made this exactly as written minus the salt and it was amazing.  Everyone loved it.  Very tasty.  I would marinate next time for even 48 hours ahead to lock in the amazing flavour.  The flank steak was very tender.  Definitely will make it again.

This came out so good, way better than I expected. Meat was tender and juicy. I plan on making this again and using it for Fajita's. Wow, super impressed. Great recipe.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  Followed it exactly as it was written with the only change of white balsamic rather than dark.  Cooked it on the rare side as that is how we like it.  I found it not too salty at all with the soy.  I also heated up the marinade and cooked it down a bit to add as a sauce for the finished meat.  This was  hit for both my husband and me.

Wow, this was amazing. Marinated it 24 hours and followed recipe. I didn't have a grill though, so I broiled it 2-3 inches from broiler for 10 minutes one side and about 5 the other and though it didn't have the char-grilled taste I would have loved, it was still amazing! I will definitely make this again.

Really good! steak was tender and flavorful. Was easy to make.  Left it in the marinade for three days (not on purpose)  Took about 7 minutes a side to grill. Husband also really liked it. Will make again, especially when having company,  Made it exactly as written.

I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I took the excess marinade and boiled it down for about 5 minutes.  Served it as a sauce for the flank steak!  A bit vinegar ish but I liked it!  Both men at the table said it was delish!

Made according to the recipe.  It tasted good, but the meat was tough.  Wouldn't make again, unless I changed the recipe and can tenderize the meat along with marinating it.

You can also cook it in a black skillet and the oven to finish. Sear in hot oil on medium high for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Then, keeping it in the skillet,  put into pre-heated oven at 425 degrees for another 3-5 minutes, depending on thickness and how done you want it.

Loved the flavour and texture but my guest found it a bit "chewy".  Never the less will make again and marinate a bit longer and grill more slowly.

Great marinade! Made it on a whim with a frozen london broil. Marinaded for about 3 hours then broiled on low, flipping every 10 minutes till everything else was done. Will be my #1beef marinade from now on.

This marinade rocks!  I fixed up the marinade exactly as written.  Didn't change a thing.  Sealed it in a gallon sized freezer bag and let it marinate from a Friday afternoon until Sunday evening.  I did grill it about 12 to 15 minutes per side because my steak was about 2lbs and I like it a little less pink than the current photo here.  It turned out perfect!  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

We used this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious and easy. We will absolutely use it again! Also, the recipe didn't specify fresh vs dried rosemary. We only had dried so that's what we used in quantity listed and it was great!

I went with an overnight marinade, used a press for the garlic and served it with sauteed mushrooms. I might have had the grill a bit hotter than medium. Awesome.

Delicious! I used green onion in this marinade. Very nice flavors here. I marinated a London Broil instead of flank and grilled. Everyone loved it!

My husband and daughter gave this a "4". It was simple to put together, but didn't seem to wow anyone. I marinated it for about 4 hours, so there was plenty of time for the marinade to penetrate the meat. Thanks!

This is our go-to recipe for flank or skirt steak. I've used it for a one-hour marinade or overnight and we've been happy with the results either way. The intensity of the marinade flavor increases with the time marinated, yet even with an hour long soak, the meat turns out pleasantly flavored with a savory rosemary and garlic essence with a hint of basalmic.
