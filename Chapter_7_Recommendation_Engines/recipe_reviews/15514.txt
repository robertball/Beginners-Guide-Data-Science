I do not understand how others had a hard time with this recipe. If you follow it exactly as written it works GREAT.  Thanks again Robin for a wonderful recipe!  I may try adding 2/3 cup of raisins to the next batch for a change of pace.  I really enjoy pumpkin and these are great... not to mention healthy! If you do not have the flour called for do not waste your time and money.  It would make up differently!  This is chemistry folks!

it's hard to tell when these muffins are done, because the center is still very wet when the top 
is nice and brown.  Mine did not rise well at all,
and the centers were almost mushy.  Still, the 
flavor was good and they're so healthy that I will
definitely try again.  Add extra almond and vanilla
extracts for better flavor.

I would use less nutmeg next time.  My husband and I thought they were pretty good, but our kids devoured them - especially when I topped them with peanutbutter.    We avoid sugar so we substituted 2T applejuice concentrate for the sugar.

UPDATE: Please read before making these muffins.... This recipe is truly for those of us who are diabetic, and/or are watching carb intake; because of the lack of added fat and the addition of the applesauce, the texture may take some getting used to. But for those of us who need this recipe to work, it certainly does. Per the reviews, I cut the applesauce in HALF, and doubled the spices. This took care of the "too moist" problem.  I also added a tablespoon of ground flax seed for additional fiber. They were delicious. As stated, if you DON'T need to watch your fat, carbs, and calories please choose another pumpkin muffin recipe with full fat. For those of us who need this recipe, I, for one, was not disappointed.

This is a delicious, sweet, and spicy recipie.  I love the muffins so much; they are esspecially good when you add raisins or some chopped nuts.  I also add a tsp. of almond extract and a tsp. of vanilla extract to add more flavor because I love almonds but want these muffins to serve as "diet" muffins.  This is definatly a recipie to try.

I wanted this to be more pumpkin than apple--what I did was used two cups of pumpkin puree and one cup of applesauce. I did sprinkle a little brown sugar over each muffin before baking. My muffins were done at 22 minutes. These turned out quite big--very fluffy and moist. Very pretty muffin. My one issue was that it had a little too much nutmeg. I'd like to make this again but I think I would use pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.

Very healthy breakfast food, easy to make.  I think dried cranberries or cherries would liven this recipe up a bit but still keep them healthy.

These muffins are very moist, but I found them also to be very bland.  I added the extra spices and vanilla and almond extract that some had suggested and still didn't get any flavor out of them.

These were very moist. All most too much so. I added more spices than called for and it still tasted a little bland. Very healthy, though.

These muffins are yummy...I ran out of pumpkin and used more applesauce and they still worked!!  Would be a bit more interesting with cream cheese or cinnamon sugar on top though.

I just made a batch of these and made just a couple of adjustments:  Used 1/2 cup Splenda instead of sugar, used 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice plus a generous sprinkle of just cinnamon, and added 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I think these are delicious.  They are not super sweet, but they have a lot of flavor.  I will definitely make these again and will likely use a bit more walnuts and maybe add some raisins.  I have an oatmeal cookie recipe that uses raisins that you soak in beaten egg, so I would probably do that here and soak my raisins in the 2 beaten eggs called for. Also, I saw many reviews that complained of sticking.  I made my batch mostly in a silicone muffin pan and had no sticking at all.  The other 6 muffins I made in a non-stick muffin pan that I sprayed with Pam first, and again no sticking at all.

I was amused by the fact that this recipe recieved both very high and very low ratings, so I just had to see for myself.  For the healthfulness of this muffin, it is very good -- moist and flavorful.  I substituted the 2nd tsp of nutmeg with 1/2 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp of ginger for more flavor.  I also did not have unsweetened applesauce on hand, so I used what I had (sweetened).  I will make these again.

I've made these a few times but something about the flavor was off.  Texture was always good and they're very moist.  I'm happier with some changes I made - used half the applesauce and added some yogurt, and for sweetness I add 3/4 cup dried cranberries and 3/4 cups chopped dried prunes (They get  really sweet when baked!) Ended up omitting the almond extract. Better the next day. Will make again, but will continue tweaking.

As I am diabetic, I watch the nutrional information, and this recipe not only met my diet requirements, but has outstanding flavor!! I add a pinch more cinnamon because I prefer more than others. I find the recipe very easy and when I made the muffins and took them to work, the raves wre extremely high and my coworkers ask frequently when I'll make them again. I love this recipe and appreciate the contributor! THANKS!!

I love this recipe!!!  I did make some adjustments.  All I did was add 1/2 cup of brown suger, about a cup of cranberries and used just vanilla extract, no almond.  For the spice I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and nutmetg and I didn't have buttermilk so I just used 2%.  My hubby loves them as well.  I am trying to get him to eat breakfast and this was a great muffin to get him started that was also somewhat healthy.  I love baking with whole wheat flour and this has a great taste to it

The first bite or two, we all thought it was just average. But by the end of the muffin, we all loved it -- children, too! These muffins are great for breakfast (or any time, for that matter). My kids can't get enough of them. Some of the reviews were not very positive, but we are accustomed to ww flour, so maybe that helps? I successfully substitued pumpkin pie spice or allspice for the cinnamon and nutmeg when I ran out. Based on other reviews, I also increased the almond to 1-1/2t. and added 1t. vanilla. Very good. Very moist muffin. A new favorite in our home.

This is an excellent, healthy muffin recipe.  I made adjustments as noted by prior reviews:  4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (instead of cinnamon/nutmet), vanilla instead of almond extract, 1 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2, 1 tsp. salt, 1 cup Craisins (dried cranberries). I baked them 25 minutes, and they turned out very moist and tasty.  Both my toddlers loved them. I sprinkled top with powdered sugar. Next time might add dried apple pieces as well. Also, makes 24 (vs. the stated 18). I took to preschool for treats. Nice to find a healthy and tasty recipe to feed the kids!

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I had misplaced my usual recipe for Pumpkin Muffins that I always bring to Thanksgiving Dinner at my Mom's so I thought I would try these instead. Unfortunately, no one, including myself, would eat them. They were very bland tasting...almost no flavor at all. Even though we followed the recipe exactly, it was as if some very important ingredient was left out.

Definitely a KEEPER!!!Made this for my diabetic mother and myself (I just watch my sugar).  Couldnt' have been better.  I did add a little Sweet N' Low to batch 2, however, they were great either way.  Freezes well.

I have perfected this with a few tweaks! Decrease the apple sauce to 1 Cup, use whole wheat PASTRY flour, and bump up the pumpkin a few more tablespoons. They turned use very light and fluffy. For being such a healthy muffin, these are quite tasty.

This recipe makes good, healthy muffins. I  didn't have applesauce, so I used a mashed banana and a little extra pumpkin. As recommended, I used extra spices.

I thought these were very good. I used Trader Joes Unbleached White Whole Wheat Flour, reduced the nutmeg to about 1 tsp and used vanilla instead of almond. I added some pecans in the end. They are very moist in the middle (if you've ever made low fat muffins with reduced oil or applesauce as a replacement you know what to expect). I love that they are low in sugar and fat and pumpkin is a "Superfood" loaded with vitamins. They'd also be good with raisins or blueberries I think. If you want a healthy muffin, you should try these.

These muffins were too spicy and not sweet enough, and I'm not someone who has to have things sweet.  The texture of mine turned out really well, so I gave it 2 points for that.  My husband was shocked at the taste (not in a good way), but I didn't prepare him for the health factor.  My 3-year-old ate 2 the first day, but the next day just nibbled at it.  I ended up eating the rest, but had to use honey-butter to make them palatable!  Don't think I'll try this one again.

For being a low cal, low sugar muffin, these really weren't bad. I didn't add any additional cinnamon or nutmeg or anything, but I might suggest doing that. You really can't taste the pumpkin, so they end up tasting like moist but hardy whole wheat spiced muffins is all.

It is very difficult to find a recipe for whole wheat muffins that are moist and light. (I usually end up with a dense rock!) This recipe has everything I look for: 100% whole grains, low fat and low sugar content on top of great taste and texture. A keeper for sure! Thanks Robyn!

P.S: The first time I made these I used paper liners and half of the muffin stuck to the paper, so be sure to use a non stick pan as indicated.

These muffins are really good!  My modifications:  Added 1/2 cup dried cranberries as one reviewer suggested, used Splenda instead of sugar, and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the combination of other spices.  Delicious!
I'm going to make another batch so I can use up the rest of the pumpkin  - can't wait to have these for breakfast next week! I think I may add crystallized ginger this time.

I liked these muffins.  I changed the sugar to Sugar Twin to reduce the calories even further.  As far as low fat goes, these muffins do not turn out tough at all.

I made these with regular flour, not wheat...they were HORRIBLE!!! I guess that's why they call for wheat flour? They tasted like water...it was weird! They were sooo bland, and I put all the spices and everything in!!! Oh well...if I try them ever again, definately will use wheat flour!!!

The spices need to be toned down. They over
powered the recipe. They should be adjusted to about 1/2 teaspoon for cinnamon and nutmeg instead of 2 teaspoons each.

The only part of this recipe that turns me off is the use of wholewheat flour......somehow it just doesn't belong.    White flour, irregardless of some peoples adversion to it, tastes better.

These were ok.  I modified it a bit.  Used 1.5 cups W/W flout and 1/2 cup white, 1 cup pumpkin  (homemade), 1 cup applesauce (homemade) as both are a bit watery, added a 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup packed br. sugar.  I was a bit concerned after whipping up the batter, cause it was very volumunious, thought it was going to overflow my bowl.  A bit bland for my taste, need to bump up the sweetness just a bit, and needs more spice, just didn't taste like what I expected.  Will make again, but will try Pumpkin Pie Spice and topping with spice/sugar or a streusel

I made this for my childs preschool class.  We made a test batch since the sugar is low to see if we liked them.  My kids could not get enough of them and when we brought them to school there was nothing left afterwards.  They were a big hit.

I liked these, but they don't seem to have much of a shelf life. They started to taste funny and the texture changed by day 3, even though they were wrapped air tight. My son didn't care for them at all.

I have been searching for a low sugar pumpkin muffin for my toddler... I will keep searching. I subbed honey for sugar and halved the recipe. I also made minis, but they still took over 20 minutes to cook and would sort of mushy in the middle and the outside got tough. I love using whole wheat, so the taste could be good with some tweaking of the recipe-just not sure what. Sorry, probably won't waste time making these again!

As written, these are very bland, and the taste of the wholewheat flour was a bit overpowering.  I've never had a 'flour' taste in baked goods before, so this was a first.  After adding 4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, and doubling the sugar, this still was bland.  Added salt and had used sweetened applesauce.  Another tsp. each of cinnamon and allspice helped.  They did bake up nicely, but the batter is incredibly thick.  Made 8 Texas sized muffins and baked for 37 minutes.  If one is on a special diet, then this is a pretty good recipe but will need much more spice to give it something.  I would recommend adding salt and more spice if making these without any dietary restrictions.

Very bland!  Did not have much pumpkin flavor.  Not enough sugar even after I adjusted as someone had suggested.  Was dissapointed.  Oh - and they stuck horribly to my muffin cups.  Sorry, not a winner with us!

Terrific combination of flavors! I added some butter flavoring and vanilla flavoring.  If you like a crunch in your muffins, try adding chopped walnuts.  I've also made them with white chocolate chips.  Delicious, and so nutritious!

They are moist, don't taste like much but almond extract- even after I added more sugar and more spices. I also realized I don't like almond extract. I did also add vanilla extract. Won't make again. If you do have restrictions with sugar, etc, this would be good to make if you can't have anything else. I found 350 for 30 min was a perfect cooking time.

These turned out wonderful!  I did make a few changes: 2 cups pumpkin and only 1 cup apple sauce, no vegetable oil, added 2 teaspoons almond and 2 vanilla extract also added hazlenuts.  Made mini muffins.  Not a very sweet muffin but very good.

Working with an oven thermometer so I know the temperature isn't the problem, but 350 at 30 min and the insides came out completely uncooked. What size muffin cups were used on this one? Bumped up the temp to 425 as I've used on some Organic box mixes and got a much better consistency. Disappointing.

Not too impressed.  I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes recently and was looking for a good snack recipe.  The muffins were really sticky (I may not have baked them for long enough) and although they had enough flavor, I had to throw most of the batch away a few days later because they went moldy!  Kind of a waste.

I was surprised that the recipe didn't call for salt. Based on other reviewers' recommendations I ended up changing the recipe drastically, but the most important change was the approximately 3/4 tsp of salt I added. The raw batter was very bland until I added the salt, and I'm glad I taste-tested the batter before baking. However, this recipe was a good starting point for a basic healthy pumpkin muffin.

Let me begin by saying after this recipe I will no longer trust the star ratings without reading the reviews!  I feel compelled to share my experience on this one....I made very minor tweaks based on my pantry contents: whole wheat pastry flour, home-made pumpkin puree (not canned), brown sugar (instead of white), sweetened applesauce (b/c it seemed to lack the sweetness that my family prefers), and vanilla extract.  I wish I'd only made 1/2 the batter instead of the full 12 cups, b/c they weren't even edible to me!  I couldn't finish the one I "taste-tested".  It was too "moist" I ended up cooking them for 45mins just to fix the gooey insides.  They lacked flavor, sweetness, and presentation (look appeal).  I had to doctor the second batch up with more brown sugar & cranberries so it would be edible.  Oh, and I was only able to make a total of 16.  I wont make these again, I'll stick to the Pumpkin Cranberry muffins, they're Dee-lish!

It's bland because there's no salt.  Add about 1/4 tsp salt.  That will bring out the flavors of the spices considerably.

I'm eating these as I type! They are delicious! A wonderful, healthy muffin recipe. Even my picky 5 yr old daughter loves them. I made a few alterations. I added 2 tps of pumpkin pie spice, 2 tsps of ginger, and topped them with a cinnamon sugar mix. I didn't have almond so I used vanilla instead. This made 19 muffins so we will have plenty left over for breakfast tomorrow morning.
Thanks for posting a great recipe. :)

this recipe did not do it for me.  I have been looking for the perfect pumpkin muffin that is hearty and this was not it.  the applesauce makes it too bland, and I even added extra spices and vanilla.  I did not have almond extract though, perhaps this would have added what it needed.

Muffins were light and moist. Flavor was simple but good. Will add nuts, cranberries, or raisins next time to try something different. I did make a few alterations, as others had mentioned. Used vanilla extract instead of almond, used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg, and added 1/3 c of brown sugar. Enjoyed this healthier version. Thank you.

It is a great base for something, but to just use those ingredients tastes like something is missing. I added raisins to the second half and it helped, but it still tasted like it was missing a certain flavor. I'm wondering if it just needs salt?

Delicious. Made as written. Next time I will use vanilla extract in place of almond. I like almond extract, but it leaves a funny aftertaste. I may add a little salt. But the texture and spice were great. They baked for 20 minutes and are perfect, but my oven also runs hot. Thanks for a good healthy muffin recipe!

This is a very moist and flavorful muffin.  I used 4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg and omitted the almond extract.  Next time I will add vanilla extract.  I did add some chopped walnuts.  DELICIOUS and just the right amount of sweetness.

These muffins are pretty good considering that they are more healthy than the average muffin.  I liked the almond extract.  The muffins were very flavorful and moist.

Muffins tasted a little flat, and cooking time could have been more like 20-25... mine seemed a bit dry.  I was looking for a recipe that mimicked the muffins that starbucks was selling before Halloween, these are close, but next time  I think I'll add a touch of salt, and some ginger too.  Also, I used muffin cups, next time I might just grease & flour the muffin pans, the muffins were sticking to the paper.

I have to say, for these being so healthy and so low cal - they are quiet good.

Some people complained that the nutmeg was too much. I didn't use any nutmeg in mine at all (didn't have any) and instead just upped the cinnamon to 2 1/2 tsp. I also used 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of 1/4 cup of sugar.

Mine came out great! I can see why people who aren't used to eating whole wheat flour or healthy baked goods would not like them. But for a dieter, these are by far one of the best healthy muffins I've made! :)

these aren't the best ever but i like em alright. they're just missing something. i added some brown sugar and vanilla, next time i think ill add nuts. i think this is a good recipe if you're dieting, but if you're one of those people who like everything super sweet they're definitely not for you.

This recipe has way too much nutmeg in it; it comes out like nutmeg-flavored dough in a muffin tin. The pumpkin was really hard to taste; perhaps it needs some more sugar or something to bring out the flavor. I couldn't eat these muffins hot, but they tasted better after being in the refrigerator overnight.

Ohhh, I wish I could give this a better rating.  I followed the instructions utterly to the letter and I was not impressed.  The muffins had great texture and were very moist, but the "sweet" in the author's description did not apply to my muffins--it was as if I'd left the sugar entirely out.  I wasnt expecting cupcake-sweet, but this was very very bland.  They are pretty good with some peanut butter or (sweetened!) cream cheese, which ends up increasing the calories.  I have some Funfetti icing in the fridge--I think I'll try that out! :)
I'll enjoy the rest of these but I dont think I'll be making them again.  Maybe my tastes are just different! :)

Very tasty! I added raisins and pecans which did nicely with the recipe.  The spice was not too much for me but then I think my spices are a bit out of date and these are favorites of mine.  They definitely did not rise much if at all. I think honey might be a good sweetener next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I added 3 teaspoons of the spices because some of the commentary suggested and I agree. The muffins didn't rise at all but are moist and flavourful. I also added 2 tablespoons of flax seeds which adds a little something to the texture. I think next time I'll sprinkle pumpkin seeds on top.
I would make this recipe again.

These are my new favorite muffin.  I used white whole wheat flour, as I do in most muffins.  I also used only 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  These are very dense and just the right amount of sweetness.

I read a few reviews before making this so I minused 1 tsp. of nutmeg and added a tsp. Of cinnamon, 3/4 tsp of both ginger and all spice. Then I added a cup of raisins...I think that really helped with adding sweetness. The texture was great. I made sure they were cooked through before taking them out. I still do prefer other recipes though but this one was great for a healthy treat.

If you want to add a little bit more flavour, add some 1 teaspoon ginger, 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves. It just adds a little bit more flavour to the muffins. I also added some bran to mine!!

Tasty, healthy muffin but a bit bland as other reviewers mentioned.  I'll likely make them again as they were super-easy and quick to make, but will either amp them up with more spices or add either nuts or berries - maybe both walnuts and cranberries.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I found it to be a bit bland.  I added some cinnamon and sugar to the top for my last 1/2 dozen, and even that didn't help.  Maybe some dried fruit or a cream cheese topping would pump up the taste a bit.

Wonderful!  I didn't have any whole wheat flour so I used 1/2 cup bran and 1 1/2 cup white flour.  I added ginger, cloves and dried cranberries and they turned out wonderfully!  Great recipe! Love it!

Really LAME!!! I disliked these so much that I didn't even bother to bake the remaining batter after my first batch.  I even added chocolate chips and glazed them with honey butter just to make them bearable!  These are not even remotely sweet, they really lack flavor, and the nutmeg was overbearing.  And we love healthy stuff.  I made this with a combo of Kamut/Barley flour, which should have made them even better and just as healthy. Trust me - use a different recipe!

I was a little disappointed by these muffins, they were just a little blander than I expected them to be. They go well with some low-calorie cream cheese though. Maybe next time I'll add more cinnamon, nutmeg, and almond extract.

Great recipe!
I didn't have applesauce so instead I used  a can of creamstyle corn and it turned out really tasty.

These muffins are good for healthy muffins.  The almond flavoring is overpowering and I can't really taste the pumpkin.  Maybe try vanilla extract instead or don't add any additional flavoring besides the spices.  This recipie would also be good with raisins or nuts added.

this recipe was good but I recommend you cut the applesauce to one cup and they turn our perfect.  I added raisins and pumpkin seeds to jazz it up.

For a healthy recipe, these were pretty tasty.  Not too sweet, but a nice combination of flavors. I definitely recommend eating them quickly, because they got soggy in the middle after sitting for a few days.

Rating it as a low-fat/low sugar option, I'm giving this 4-stars ... going up against regular, it wouldn't make it that far ... but, if you know what you're getting into, you will enjoy these, as did I ... thanks!

I thought these were great! If your not used to healthier baking you might have to aquire a taste to 100% whole wheat baking. If that is the case with some of the people who were not fond of this recipie I urge them to give it another try!

I also thought these were bland but I guess its a trade off for the health factor. I did like the moistness of them, they just need more flavor. Next time I plan on doubling the sugar and using some pumpkin pie spice in it as well.

I add almost 1/2 c splenda to provide more sweetness. The nutmeg is WAY too much in my opinion so I put about 1/2 teaspoon in. I still sometimes have the problem of mushy centers though.

Too much nutmeg and could have used a little more sugar.  With those modifications this IS a recipe worth trying.  Whole wheat and pumpkin is a great combination.  I also had to bake much longer than called for - could have been my oven, but make sure they're ready before you take them out.

I didn't have a muffin tin yet (oh horror!), so I poured the mixture into a springform pan, and it made a lovely moist pumpkin spice cake.  I also used the pumpkin pie mix instead of puree, vanilla instead of almond extract, and all purpose flour instead of whole wheat -- and then topped it with a light glaze.  Really delicious!  I brought it to a brunch and left with none.

Very moist. And I even forgot to put the oil in! I used canned pumpkin pie mix since I had some left over from another recipe. I just left out 1/2 the spices and sugar since the pie mix already was flavored. They weren't a huge hit in my house, but my very picky son ate them and I really like them. They weren't overly sweet or cake-like which is what makes things a hit here.

For more yumminess, top with cream cheese!

I did not have whole wheat flour or almond extract, so I used white flour and vanilla.  The recipie is great if you love the taste of flour.  I added additional seasoning and pumpkin along with half a bag of mini chocolate chips, but it didn't help at all.  Hopefully they are better with the wheat flour and almond flavoring.

I doubled the recipe so I could use a full can of pumpkin.  But then I used only 3 c. applesauce and about 1/4 c. apple juice concentrate.  They turned out pretty good.  I might use more spices next time . . .

I was looking for a healthy muffin, & these are OK.  I find them pretty bland & would not make them again, unless I added some nuts and maybe chopped apple along with the applesauce.  The pumpkin flavor is mild as well.

Good if you’re looking for a not too sweet and sort of healthy muffin (I’m saying “sort of” because though it’s low in sugar, it still has tons of flour). They were so moist that nobody could get the paper cups off them to eat them. They also went bad after staying on the counter for 3 days.... I added cranberries to them and got a whole bunch of compliments for that. I think that next time I make muffins, I’ll probably stick to a more traditional recipe with sugar and butter.

I like healthy muffins... and really like anything made with pumpkin... but was really disappointed in this recipe .   I tried a second batch and doctored it with bran and pumpkin seeds, raisins..still terrible.   Coarse, lacking richness and flavour... I think it would be better and easier to simply make bran muffins and add pumpkin to that recipe.

Will definitely make this agian.  I heeded some advice used 2 cups pumpkin and 1 cup applesauce.  I am also watching calories so substituted egg white for one of the eggs.  I really like my cinnamon so I used twice the amount.  I also used a combination of whole wheat buckwheat and almond flour for calorie reduction and used vanilla extract since I didn't have almond ( almond flour added the flavor). Since some said it was too moist I added some red wheat bran to the mix.  Sprinkled tops of muffins with raw pumpkin seeds.  They were moist, fluffy, nicely spicy, rose really well, sweet but not overly so.  Next time I will try erythritol-monkfruit as a sugar substitute to increase sweetness and reduce calories.  All in all a guiltless tasty treat at only 150 calories per muffin.

I made this recipe and it came out perfect! The texture was soft and the muffins have a great taste. I did add 1 tablespoon of pumkin pie spice for extra flavoring. Next time I will add raisins or crushed nuts. Loved it!!

Not bad tasting. Not hard to make either. I'm glad I tried them but I wouldn't go out of my way to make them again. Might add raisins or cranberries if I were to try this again.

I thought this was very tasty. Since my husband and I are gluten free, I used Bob's Red Mill  Gluten Free 1 to 1 Flour. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon and nutmeg, giving it much more flavor. I will definitely make these again!

The texture of these muffins was perfect, but I couldn't really taste the pumpkin. Also,  even when I added in more spices, the muffins were still bland.

I will make this again and add salt.  Maybe add vanilla also.  It just seemed to be missing something.

Amazing muffins! So moist and they stick together very well. No messy crumbs to clean up after the kids. I left out the sugar completely as my apples and pumpkin that I pureed were very sweet already. Perfect amount of spice too to complement the flavour.

I loved this recipe! I used one teaspoon of nutmeg instead of two and I didn't have muffin tins so I made bars instead. they turned out perfect and tasted delicious :)

The real test was whether my three kids, ages 10,8 and 5 would like. They LOVED them. Funny they commented' gee these aren't sweet but are still reallly good'! The whole reason I made them was to get my very picky 8 year old to get more fruits/veggies and protein. I figured the pumpkin, applesauce and egg and low sugar made it a great choice. Well, she loved it so much begged for a second one after dinner. I hadn't even tried them at that point so decided lets what these taste like. I thought they were great too. I don't like overly sweet things and normally don't even eat muffins, but these I would eat. The only modification I made was adding a pinch of cloves to it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.
