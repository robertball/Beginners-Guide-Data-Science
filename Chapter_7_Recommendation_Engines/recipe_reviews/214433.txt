I used a mixture of strawberries and raspberries because I only had about a half cup of each. I used whole wheat white flour and buttermilk instead of whole milk. I used a round cake pan instead of a skillet because I don't have a cast iron skillet. This was really easy to make with my oldest son and when it was done, I let it cool for a couple minutes, then flipped it out and cut it into pieces with a pizza cutter. My kids had this with a little butter and homemade freezer jam. Huge hit!

Awesome recipe!  I have made many of the variations and they have turned out great too.  I will say that I like this recipe best with just two eggs.  Thanks for sharing!

Simple recipe to follow, although I made a few tweaks.  Instead of 1/4 c sugar, I used 2 TBSP agave syrup, which made this sweet enough.  I used a gluten-free baking mix instead of flour. I also added (surprise) a few mint leaves to the blender, my new fave flavor combo of strawberry/mint.  I didn't have whole milk, so I used 1/2 c strawberry honey yogurt and 1/4 c 2% milk.  The consistency is similar to a ricotta cheesecake, so I may try making it with ricotta instead of yogurt next time, and increase the sweetness.  Overall, I thought it was simple and yummy.

I love this recipe! So easy on a lazy Sunday morning! I have one suggestion if making with strawberries,  try using 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond extract. The almond really complements strawberries.

LOVE this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T the first time and give it 5 stars.  I have since modified it using coconut oil instead of butter since we don't do much dairy, and I also throw in blueberries in addition to strawberries.  I like it with the 3 eggs as it seems almost custardy.  I double the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 pan.  Any leftovers can be eaten cold straight from the fridge, almost like a dessert.  Can't wait to try a savory version as others have suggested (no sugar and cheese added). Very versatile recipe.

If you are looking for a delicious and easy breakfast, you may want to try this recipe.  No need to heat up the pan, I just put the butter in the skillet and put it in the oven while it was preheating until the butter was melted.  I also added extra strawberries.  Some of us preferred it served with real maple syrup while others preferred it with whipped cream.  However it was served, everyone loved it.   This made a tasty and attractive breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly (which is what you should be doing at least the first time you make it, then you can tweak it to your liking) and I thought it was wonderful! For the naysayers who said it wasn't a pancake, it's not like your traditional pancake, if that's what your after you should be using a traditional pancake recipe. This is like a Dutch baby and will be custardy and wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing!

This is not your typical flour pancake, if you see that amount of egg to flour you'll realize it comes out more like a quiche than a typical pancake. It is tasty, but the egg flavor is very evident...not something *I* enjoy, but it may not bother others. A plus is that it is very easy to cook and I could see this as a dessert when sprinkled with powdered sugar.

Really tasty.  I blended up the strawberries with maple syrup to make a dipping sauce instead of slicing and baking them with the pancake.  Kids loved it!

Not having a cast-iron or ovenproof skillet, I melted 2T butter in my glass 8x8 Pyrex dish in the oven while mixing the ingredients. Followed nearly to the letter, only adding a few sprinkles of cinnamon to the batter as well as a drop of almond extract (in addition to the vanilla). After removing the dish with the melted butter, I sprinkled in some brown sugar and added the batter. I sprinkled some extra cinnamon and sugar to the top and it was perfectly puffed after 25 minutes (my oven runs hot, so I baked at 400). Make sure you let it rest for 5-10 minutes so it sets up well. The full cup of strawberries was a little much for our preference, so I'll simply use fewer next time. If you rinse and slice your strawberries immediately before adding to the batter, make sure they are completely dry, otherwise you'll have extra liquid floating on top. Love the puffy edges and the custardy texture. Served with homemade whipped cream and a dusting of powdered sugar. Delicious!

Amazingly versatile recipe!  Thank you for all of the ideas and variations.  This has become one of our favorite breakfasts.  My pancakes never turn out quite right, but this is nearly foolproof and comes out hot in one dish (as opposed to one pancake at a time).  We typically use 2 eggs, but I also like it with 3.  I also use whole wheat flour and skim milk with a little greek yogurt or sometimes almond milk.  Again, very versatile.  We really like strawberries or cherries with cocoa powder and/or chocolate chips.  I use a regular oven proof skillet without the butter and the pancake just slips right out onto the plate, ready to serve.  We typically eat it with yogurt.  Wonderful and tasty recipe!

What a great recipe! Our whole family loved it! I was out of milk so substituted buttermilk and it was divine! SO much easier and tastier than normal pancakes. This is a keeper!

It was well received and I would make it again. I'm not giving it 5 stars because I'd like to experiment with the strawberries. They were dry when sliced and added to the batter but their natural liquid comes out during baking and I wasn't totally thrilled with the texture of the finished product. I make puff pancakes frequently and usually add sauteed pears or apples when serving. Note: I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used an 8" cake pan instead of cast iron skillet and that worked great!

This is simple and delicious. Based on other reviews, I used 2 eggs rather than three. I will definitely make this again. Thank you, Rita.

Absolutely delicious!!!!!! Made one yesterday for family and three more today for neighbors. One of my “new”  favorite recipes that is simple to make and impressive to serve. Reminds me of a German Puff that I recently had at a German festival.   Today I used strawberries and blueberries (more than the recipe called for)! Yum Yum. Will try chocolate chips for my grandson and I’m going to experiment with other additions.

EXCELLENT and very easy. I enjoyed more than pancakes.
My First time I used 4 eggs, and added cinnamon to the batter.  Pie was ready in 11 min. (but I live at 4700 altitude). I dusted the finished pie with butter dabs and powdered sugar. I'd say it's the quantity of 4 pancakes.
Next time I'll bake at 400 and stick with the 3 eggs and keep an eye on. Very versatile toppings.

Delicious recipe, similar to a Dutch baby.  Mine was a little doughy  in the center, but this may be characteristic of the recipe. Flavor was delicious.  I imagine  any fruit would work.  Will definitely make it again.

This was not a hit in my house. My kids(5 & 10) didn't eat it at all. I think it would have been better without the strawberries. It was pretty plain. Might try the cinnamon or chocolate variation once.

This is a great versatile recipe. I've made it with strawberries, and again with apricots. It's pretty good! I used 2 eggs both times and it's still pretty eggy. I sprinkled a little sugar and cinnamon over the batter just before popping it in the oven. I topped my apricot ones off with whipped cream and strawberry syrup and it was delish.

Skillet pancakes are also called a Dutch Baby or a Hootin Annie. I made the Apple Dutch Baby this morning. It had skim milk instead of whole milk, because that’s what we had. I browned a whole apple’s worth of slices and picked out the 4 or 5 thinner ones that cooked to black instead of brown. (I ate them while the pancake was in the oven. ) Instead of a blender, I used my rotary hand beater. It turned out beautifully, and was delicious, light and sweet, but very filling.

Great spin on a recipe I've been eating/cooking for many years!  I always allow my cast iron skillet to heat up inside the oven as it's preheating.  When the oven is up to temp and the batter is ready, I add the butter to the already hot skillet, swirl it around as it melts, then pour the batter in.  I didn't have any strawberries on hand, so I used blueberries.  Added a little cinnamon, and reduced sugar to 2 T. brown sugar.  

As kids, we knew these as "German Pancakes" -- they were one of our favorites.  My son calls them "Puffy Pancakes."  I typically cook them in a 10' cast iron skillet with varying ratios of eggs/flour/milk.  (In a larger skillet, the edges really puff up and turn golden brown.)   I use very little sugar in the batter, sometimes omitting it altogether.  We've always liked to eat them with a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.  I also make a "french toast" version that has cinnamon  and maple extract in the batter, served with a drizzle of maple syrup +  sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.

I wanted to try a different recipe for breakfast and figured I'd give this a try since I had everything on hand already. Pretty interesting! It has a very different texture than a pancake. It came out to be pretty dense with an egginess to it, similar to a deflated souffle. I followed the recipe as written for the plain version (didn't have any fruit and didn't feel like having chocolate chips in it). Only difference was that I made it in an 8" round cake pan but followed melting butter in it and pouring the mixture in. Will definitely try again but with fruit.

The easiest and best breakfast  recipe. Have made it with apples and twice with blueberries. Followed the recipe as written except cut back on the sugar because we prefer less sweet.

Perhaps it's the altitude, but mine worked a little differently. It puffed up around the edge and looked nothing like the photo. It was great though. I'm wondering how to keep it from cooking so unevenly.

My family loved it. There's 4 of us, and cooking it in an 8" cast iron skillet yielded just enough for all of us without one drop left for leftovers. Delicious. Next time I might serve it with raw, fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

wow, wow, wow!  I made exactly as written with the exception of putting it in a 8" cake pan since I don't have a 8" iron skillet.  My husband says this one is a keeper!  Not at all like a traditional pancake, it's a custard type of something.  Easy to whip up and so yummy!!  BTW, I also don't have a blender so I used my food processor and that worked well too.  Please try this recipe, so good!

I cut this recipe in half, using two eggs. I thought it was very good but I like Eggy things. I was pleased that it so easily released from the pan. Used only a very small amount of maple syrup with it and it wasn’t too sweet.

Fast and easy! I substituted to make it lower carb, gluten free and less dairy. Used ultra fine white rice flour, sugar substitute erythritol with monk fruit and coconut milk.

Amazing.  Loved the eggyness.  So easy.  I added a teaspoon of magic baking powder - I’m not sure if it did anything, but mine turned out light and eggy.  I used frozen blueberries so I added 5 minutes to make sure the batter around the berries was fully cooked.

As suggested I used only 2 eggs and half strawberries / half blueberries.  Only had a 10" skillet so cooked it a few minutes less.   Taste was very good (ate the whole thing myself) but  texture is definitely not a pancake.   Did not need any syrup.  Will make again.

Thoroughly enjoyed this.   The texture was spongy, similar to a popover, which I prefer to the standard pancake, but not everyone would. 

I made it with blueberries instead of strawberries and they floated to the top and weren't well integrated into the pancake, but it was still good.  I think they'd incorporate better if they were sliced in two.

Very good. I prefer using 2 instead of 3 eggs.

Having only small apples, I added cinnamon to the batter and thinly sliced honeycrisp apples over the top.  It was delicious!  Maple syrup is a must.  I think if you added a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it could be a dessert.

Awesome ! Very easy to prepare. I used Splenda for the sugar and Blue Diamond Unsweetened Vanilla Cashew Milk for the milk. It was very delicious!

I love this recipe! I followed the recommendations of some other reviewers of using only 2 eggs. I also like to add 1/4 almond flour and replace the vanilla extract for almond extract. Then finish with 1/4 cup sliced almonds in top of strawberries.

I found the oven at 425 a bit too hot as shown in my photo. A bit scorched. I'll make it again

None of us cared for this recipe at all, although it looked amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and ended up with a dense heavy pancake.

Made the version with apples and cinnamon - delish! Also used only two eggs as suggested. Must have been good - my husband ate three pieces of it!

This was delicious! I didn't have enough strawberries so I added bananas as well and sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Even my 2 year old gobbled it up!

I followed the recipes exactly and the pancake turned out to be a catastrophe. The top and the sides were burned and only about half of the recipe remained edible-- if you would consider soft, runny mush edible. The taste was okay but my thirteen year old sister left the majority of her serving untouched.

I especially enjoy this version of Dutch Baby because of the idea to heat the pan on the stove top (and not in the oven). After that, it's all about timing. I still can't get mine to puff perfectly, but next time I'm going to try a shallower cast iron pan.

I made it exactly as written. It is easy to make and really tastes good. My husband even requested it for Saturday breakfast. It was sweet enough that we just sprinkled some confectioners sugar over it.

Great alternative to pancakes.  I added 1/2c wheat flour, 1/2t baking powder, 1c frozen bb.  My husband wants me to try making a regular pancake dough recipe but then baking it in the iron skillet.  Not sure if this would taste as good though.
