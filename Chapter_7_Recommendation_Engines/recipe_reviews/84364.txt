I made these to grill on a charcoal grill and they were terrific!  The only change I made was to add about 1 tbsp. of paprika in order to give the juice a more 'red' color as I was trying to get something close to what we eat when we go to our favorite Turkish restaurant.  The flavor was excellent!  Next time I think I will spice them more liberally since we are spicy food people, but really, the (amount of) spices called for in the recipe worked very well.  We will definintely make these again!

These were good but I did make a few changes. First I used a fresh green chili pepper instead of the dried chili flakes and it gave it a nice, subtle heat. I added an egg to help hold everything together. Also instead of the curry powder I added paprika, adding a nice smoky flavor. I added 2 minced mushrooms as well because they needed to be used and they give the patties a nice texture and I think they helped keep them moist on the inside. I served these with couscous with toasted pine nuts and I wilted some spinach and cabbage in the pan I cooked the patties in and it gave the greens a really nice flavor.

Super tasty, hubby and I both loved it.  We broiled it because we're doing a specific diet where we can't fry things and we live in upstate NY so grilling is pretty much out of the question this time of year.  It still came out really yummy.  Be sure to add salt and pepper before cooking or it'll be a little bland and you'll have to add it later.  Served it on a plate with modified Avocado Tzatzi sauce (recipe on this site), brown rice and leftover savory butternut squash.  Awesome meal.

This was very similarly spiced to a dish at my favorite Indian restaurant. I did up the spice slightly, since so many other reviewers suggested it.  I also tried the yogurt sauce, and it was an authentic accompanyment to the lamb.  Loved it!

Delicious with the feta orzo recipe from this site and homemade tzatziki.  I served it with a salad of sliced tomates, cucumbers, feta and red onions with drizzled olive oil

These are more like lamb burgers! I made some yogurt dill sauce to go with. They were a big hit at our house.

I never would have bought ground lamb but finally did because it looked nice and it was very cheap. Searched the net for something that looked appealing, and lucked into this.  I backed off a bit on the amount of cumin and curry because it seemed to me it was too much.  WRONG!  Will make again for sure with recipe intact.  Found fresh mint sauce recipe and used that to dip in and I was in heaven, and can't wait to make again with full amounts of curry and cumin.  I never find what I consider a perfect recipe, but this one is perfect.  New found favorite.  Thank you for sharing!

We did not like these at all. They tasted gamey. Maybe that is how ground lamb is suppose to taste or maybe it was a problem with our ground lamb. I can't bear to serve the leftovers.

Delicious... I added fresh chopped cilantro, substituted red onions and green, and threw in an egg for moisture. Yum! Next time, I'll add a bit more salt, but overall, very tasty. Will make again!

Wow these are good and flavour wise would love to give 5 stars but I had one issue.  When I started to form the patties they just would not stay together.  So I added 1 egg which helped but since I was doubling the recipe maybe should have added 2 as I was have slight issues.   When you are making this dish please remember to check the heat level of the curry.  There are 3 levels mild, medium and strong.  If you have not used curry then try the mild.  We use curry powder a lot so I used medium and it was fine for us.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish.

I didn't have any green onions so substituted chives and onions.  I didn't adjust the spices at all.  We BBQ'd them and they were terrific.  My husband and I both agree that this recipe is a keeper.

Wow! The flavor is awesome. I didn't have any green onions, and I made meatballs and threw them in the oven, but this is my new favorite ground lamb recipe! I served them over some basmati rice, and dinner was great! Thank you for sharing!

Wow!  This was an incredibly easy and delicious recipe.  I sauteed them (rather than grilling) and served them wrapped in a heated flour tortilla filled with shredded carrots, lettuce, cukes, and chutney.  They really hit the spot and it only took me about 10 minutes to make (I'm not kidding).  I will definitely make these again!

I was craving some Indian food, but didn't feel like going thru the hassels of making something elaborate. I made the patties and my husband grilled them on a propane grill. This hit the spot. I didn't have any yogurt (actually I messed up and wasted the yogurt putting hot curry powder in instead of cumin) so I food processed some cottage cheese w/ lemon juice, lemon rind and fresh mint. It was good! My ten year old daughter had never had lamb and she liked it...but she didn't like the sauce and oppted for ketchup. Thanks for the easy recipe!

We made these in a cast iron pan because it gets really hot and creates a nice crust. My husband sprinkled black pepper and salt on one side for extra flavor.  I didn't have green onions so I used about half of a small yellow onion plus 4 large hunks of garlic.  I whipped up a quick sauce using dijon mustard and about twice as much light sour cream, garlic powder and pepper and it was perfect with these.  I also made a side of cucumber, yellow tomatoes, red pepper and avocado tossed with red wine vinegar, a good quality olive oil, salt and pepper and it was a perfect accompaniment!  We also made them into smaller sized patties (more like slider size).  I would definitely make these again!

These are great!  The only change I made was to half the curry to 1/2 a tablespoon and add 1/2 a tablespoon of paprika as suggested by another review.  I eat them on a wheat bun with tzatziki and tomatoes - yum!

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!  My boyfriend and I LOVED these.  I had never made lamb before, so I was nervous, but they were amazing.  THe meat I had appeared to be a bit dry, so I put an egg over it and mixed it in.  I put the meat in pita bread, added some Greek dill veggie dip, and WOW!  Amazing! :)

Friggin' amazing!! Didn't have curry powder so sub'd equal parts of cayenne, paprika, and lemon pepper. Served on pita bread with yogurt/mint/cucumber/red jalapeno sauce.  My boyfriend was very upset there wasn't leftovers. Thanks for the awesome recipe! :)

These were very good...different.  Served it, as suggested, with a plain yoghurt/cucumber mixture.  We like them on the rarer side so 3-4 minutes per side was perfect for us.  Thank you.

Great recipe! I bought lamb on a whim last week so this was great since I had most of the ingredients. I subbed some purple onion for green onion and added some fresh dill. Served like a bun less burger topped with julienne cucumber and some cucumber-dill yogurt dip we had. Very flavorful, we will definitely use this recipe again.

As is ,it is ok. Add some minced onion,finely chopped parsley and green onion  for more flavour. I added an egg and 1/4 cup  breadcrumbs since I find this works best for meatballs. Baked at 375F for 25min. Will use this recipe as a base and add my extras .

Very good!  I used 1/2 T. curry, and 1/2 T. paprika, after reading reviews.  Didn't have quite enough green onions, so added a T. of minced yellow onion.  Will make this again!

This is a very quick and tasty recipe. The spices don't overpower the main ingredient, the lamb. For those who like spice, I would suggest adding more cumin  and curry powder.

This is a delicious recipe! My curry powder already had red pepper flakes in it so I omitted that and we pan fried them - yummy!! I will definitely make these again.

These were a great departure from beef patties...enjoyed the zing nicely tempered by the refreshing yogurt sauce suggested.

This has incredible flavor.. If you are looking for something to do with ground lamb, give this a shot.   Just the right amount of heat.

We double the quantities because it certainly wasn't enough to feed 4. We served it over tumeric rice with peas.

This recipe was ok... My lamb patties wern't really spicy enough!... I actually couldn't even tell they had red pepper flakes in them.  I accidently left out the curry and I didn't salt them enough...oops!  I'm sure that was a big part of what went wrong.  They also came out dry though!   maybe I'll try it again and double the red pepper next time and try mixing in some ground beef... It may add more fat to the meat.  My husband liked them with ketchup!.. I think they may have been really good if they would have had more spice!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and I loved these, although I'll add a bit more spiciness next time.  That's just personal preference, though--the recipe's great as written.

I really like this. I used Jamaican style curry and omitted the green onions. As someone else suggested I added an egg to help bind it all. I don't know if it was necessary but I did it. Then we ate them like hamburgers.

Did not care for this at all.  I cut the spices way back and it was too strong for us.  My husband said     “Don’t save this.”

These were great. Made them on a skillet inside with oil. Adjusted the recipe per reviews and added own touches: added 1 egg, added 1 piece of mashed bread (mash down bread with milk over low heat, cool and add to recipe), and after making meatballs added light coating of bread crumbs. As suggested, served with green salad, naan, and string beans. Loved it!

These are so very simple (you can have them on the table for a weeknight dinner in less than an hour) and really delicious! I make them as meatballs rather than patties and I do them under the broiler. I do add 1 egg per pound of lamb, and I need to double the recipe for my large family.  My young children LOVE these; they end up fighting over the last meatballs. I make a very simple yogurt sauce with plain Greek yogurt, a dash of lemon juice, and a dash of garlic powder to dip the meatballs into. Very good.

I didn't have green onions on hand so I made it without and they still came out great.  I made them in the oven on a greased baking sheet.  Takes a little longer in the oven.  Super easy and delicious.

Oh my goodness, this is good! I made it without the red pepper. I used half sweet curry powder and half spicy curry powder. I fried in coconut oil in cast iron and then slipped the pan in the oven at 400F to finish cooking. I served with a sauce made of sour cream (I was out of yogurt), diced cucumber, mint leaves, salt, garlic, and pepper. Made a double batch for 4 people and everyone is craving the leftovers that are in the fridge right now. These have become a new favorite!

Out of this world! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added some paprika for color, but otherwise used the spices that were recommended. Since we haven't gotten the grill fired up yet, I made them into meatballs, sauteed them for a couple of minutes until they were brown on all sides and then baked them in a covered container for 10 minutes at 375. They came out FANTASTIC! The yogurt sauce is a great way to serve them - I also put out a side dish of couscous with fresh mint leaves.

Oh YUM!  Utterly brilliant.  Did them on the BBQ for the time specified and they were incredibly juicy.  Crumbled them up with lemon juice + chopped red onion + olive oil and served in pitas with rocket and yogurt mixed with a bit of cayenne pepper and lemon juice.  5 star supper.

Very good.  Served with the Avocado Tzatziki Sauce recipe and sour cream.  Topped with a few pieces of chopped tomato.  This dish was very tasty and had good presentation.
