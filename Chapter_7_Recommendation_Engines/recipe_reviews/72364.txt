Fabulous! This not only tastes good, but is good for you! The flavor combination is wonderful - just the right amount of sweetness and the crunch from the walnuts is a nice touch. I used plain milk and added a bit of vanilla. I topped it with vanilla yogurt and the optional honey which really put this over the top! Great breakfast treat!

This is absolutely delicious!!!  I make it EVERY Sunday night and bring it to work for the whole week.  It is just as excellent reheated!  I customize quantities and kinds of nuts and dried fruit... I've found its great with chopped almonds and extra coconut.  I also like to top it with freshly cut banana or blueberries!  YUMMY!!!

I used regular milk that I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I cooked the oatmeal in my rice cooker, adding in the maple syrup, raisins, and cranberries and letting it cook with the milk and oats. This was so good. The combination of the fruit with the creamy oatmeal, the crunchy nuts and chewy coconut with a maple-y flavor was just incredible. We all really loved this oatmeal. No leftovers.

This is THE BEST oatmeal I have had yet.  I made some minor modifications that do not significantly alter the recipe. I scaled it down for 2 servings; combined 1% milk and quick oats in the microwave on high for 2 minutes, added the maple syrup and fruit, returned to microwave for 1 more minute, and then added the walnuts and coconut. It was perfectly sweet without the added honey. I love the combination of walnuts and coconut, which gives this oatmeal just the right amount of interest and pleasant crunch. Next time I am going to try it with steel cuts as I prefer them over regular. Thanks for a great recipe.

It tastes good.  But I'm not so sure how "healthy" it is...  People have this concept that unless its packed with fats or artificial this or that, a dish is healthy.  Make no mistake - this is a dessert.  There's fiber in the bran, but aside from a couple of walnuts - its all carbs.  Maple syrup, raisins, cranberries, sweetened flaked coconut, and honey is optional.

EXCELLENT. I am just learning to eat oatmeal and by the time I add enough brown sugar to my taste it is no longer healthy, but with the added fruit to this one I only needed a small amount of honey.  Tomorrow I think I will substitute dates for the cranberries.  The possibilities are endless.  Thank you some much for helping me in my venture to healthier eating.

This would probably also be excellent with some banana and/or pineapple. I couldn't taste the maple syrup (used 1 tsp for a single serving of oats) so I'd probably just skip it entirely next time. The fruits lend plenty of flavor anyway. A nice variation for morning oatmeal!

Really liked this oatmeal, although next time I would like to try using 1/2 milk, 1/2 water, or maybe try regular milk instead of soy. My oatmeal came out a little too thick for my liking. One thing I did differently which I will do next time is toast the walnuts before adding. Not sure what the coconut did to the oatmeal, I couldn't really taste it. Next time I think I'll add some coconut or vanilla extract to the milk. Overall a good filling breakfast.

Wow - this oatmeal is amazing. After scrambling after my morning workouts to quickly make oatmeal (with nothing) - this is a great change. I love the coconut and I agree that the walnuts really give this texture. I would lessen the maple syrup to a little less than 1/4 cup and definitely do not add the honey. It is naturally sweet enough with the raisins and coconut.

This was good, but nothing to write home about. I used 2% milk instead and dried blueberries instead of raisens. I love coconut, so that was great, but it needed to be punched up a bit. Maybe a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg next time.

Used a 2 qt saucepan for 6 servings. 1% milk & pecans because that is what we had.  Used real maple syrup.  Really tasty.  No need for the yogurt & honey this time.  Maybe when it is reheated for a quick breakfast tomorrow.  Thanks so much BMARYGREEN for the recipe, I look forward to trying different variations.  UPDATE:  2nd day warmed up leftover oatmeal with a little milk.  Dried fruit now so-o-o plump.  Served with vanilla yogurt.  Delicious.

Yum! This had the perfect level of sweetness for me. I don't buy soy milk, so I just used regular but other than that I made as written omitting the optional yoghurt and adding only a little honey. I'll be making this for breakfast regularly.

This was so good!  It was the perfect sweetness and consistency.  I didn't have enough milk, so I used some water aswell, and it turned out fine, still really creamy.  I did not have the cranberries so i used golden raisins and dried currants, and it was really delicous anyways, but I would like to try the cranberries.  This will definitley become a Saturday morning staple!

This was great, until I added the yogurt and honey. I didn't think they went well with the rest of the oatmeal, so next time I will leave them out.

I thought this was a nice, hearty oatmeal. I used 1% milk and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of maple syrup, which kept it lightly sweet. I also used dried blueberries instead of cranberries. Love the coconut!

Sorry, but this did not turn out. I love coconut, but I found it overpowering.  Next time I'll adjust the fruit etc - there is potential with this recipe, so thanks for the idea.

This oatmeal tasted great! And this coming from someone who could never finish their bowl of oats until Quaker's oat medley cups. I loved the combination. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk (be sure to get a big enough pan because it boils over quickly!) and added pecans and slivered almonds on top because of prefrences. It had great texture and was sweet enough to add plain, nonfat greek yogurt to, and was super fast to make. Thanks for the recipe!

My kids LOVE this recipe and it is the favorite of our usual oatmeal recipes.  I used almond milk instead of soy, and the second time I made this, I cut it with water and it still turned out great.  We also left out the walnuts because of allergies.  It is great even without the yogurt and honey.  Thank you!

Great oatmeal!  I used 1/2 unsweetened almond milk and 1/2 water.  I cut the recipe in half and it was just enough for the 2 of us.  Even without the honey on top, it was just sweet enough.  The maple and coconut flavors went great together.  Hubby says, "It's unlike any oatmeal I've had before!"  (That's good, btw.)

Quite delicious.  I went with half milk/half water so it wouldn't be too creamy and it worked out perfectly. Very filling. Will absolutely make again!

This was sweet and tasty. One thing, though: I made it with brown rice, and even though I used instant is was still too firm for my tastes. I'll experiment with ways to make the rice softer, because I will definitely be making it again.

This oatmeal was the best I have ever eaten, but I used regular milk instead of soy. The word healthy should be "delicious". I plan to make this one for my family for Christmas morning. It should hold them over until dinner is ready.

Healthy, fast and easy! To the negative review that downplays the benefits of this recipe, I tweaked it a bit and this is a great healthful recipe: 
1.Oats = fiber and reputed to boost breast milk supply for those BFing moms!  
2. I used a mix of coconut-almond milk, cow milk & water.
3. Fresh or frozen cranberries pack more fiber without added sugars; cranberries = proanthocyanidins & many other potent healthful benefits. Doubled the amount.
4. Subbed raw honey for maple syrup. Potential benefits for allergies or illness.
5. Raisins yep they're sweet. I added less.  Raisins are packed with fiber, minerals, and polyphenols.
6. Unsweet flaked coconut. Well this packs major sugar and fat. Contains iron and zinc. This should potentially be omitted. However, a source of fat can be good for you in the morning and may keep you from feeling hungry too soon after breakfast.     coconut oil contains lauric acid a natural antimicrobial. 
7. Walnuts - hello. Omega-3 fats, antioxidants, vitamin E, folate... these are so good. Add more, I did.

This is great for breakfast, but it is a bit too sweet to be healthy. I used unsweetened coconut flakes and omitted the raisins to cut back on the sweetness. Walnuts are a tasty addition and provide crunchiness. I am sure this is just delicious as written but if you are trying to cut back on sugar and watch your calorie intake the above changes should be helpful. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was a very yummy and filling Sunday morning breakfast!   I followed the recipe fairly closely, subbing dried cherries for cranberries and also adding a handful of sugar-coated pecans in addition to toasted walnuts.  I also added about a tsp of vanilla just because, and swirled a tiny bit of butter in my bowl. Deliciousness! I couldn't taste the coconut, but it added the perfect amount of sweetness. I will portion out the leftovers for quick breakfasts for the next couple days. Reheated with a little milk, this is a satisfying way to start the day. Next time I'd like to try a bit of coconut extract to bring out more of a coconut flavor.

Easy to make. My husband found this recipe and follows the measurements exactly without deviation. I would love more cranberries in it, but hey, I'm not doing the cooking. I make up for it with lots of honey. The yogurt makes it even yummier! We have this 2-3x/week for breakfast the past 2 months. A great way to eat my fiber. I never liked plain oatmeal, but I find myself asking him to make this rather than eggs in the morning. Great husband too. :-)

I made with half water, half regular milk. I used unsweetened coconut (what I had).I added all the nuts and dried fruit toward the end of cooking. I topped with yogurt and more maple syrup. I liked the coconut and maple flavor combination.

I really enjoyed the combination of all of the flavors in this, but knowing ahead of time it would be too sweet for me, I left out the maple syrup, and used just honey, but next time I think I'll just stick with the sweetness that the coconut already adds. I did decides also to make it with water instead of milk, as that's always made oatmeal anyway. Lastly, I left out the salt as I generally don't like salt. However, this was absolutely delicious and definitely filling! (Next time, I'm going to be sure to put away all the ingredients before I enjoy it because I kept focusing on all the carbs I usually don't eat)  I felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast, but again, it was delicious!

To take to church, I increased the recipe to nine servings and made it in my Instant Pot, to try out the "porridge" feature. The only sub I made was to use powdered coconut instead of flaked, because that's what I had on hand; I used a little less than called for because it's more dense in the measuring cup. // I forgot to set the Instant Pot vent to "sealed" at first. So my oatmeal cooked longer than nine minutes, which caused it to scorch a little on the bottom. Despite that, this was delicious! Its sweetness was light and delicate; the texture was rich; and the fruits and walnuts were just the right accent. And because this recipe is vegan as written, everyone at the church workshop could enjoy it, which they did -- this recipe got rave reviews!  I set out additional soy milk, dried cranberries, walnuts, and coconut for everyone to "dress" their oatmeal as desired. // Oatmeal is typically a breakfast of last resort for me, but *this* oatmeal is definitely in the rotation now! (P.S. I recommend using real maple syrup. The imitation stuff is a lot sweeter, and may be why some reviewers found the recipe too sweet.)

DELICIOUS!  I have made this numerous times and it's always a hit.  I've used regular milk when I don't have almond milk, and I've used whatever variety Craisins I have on hand, whether it's cherry, blueberry, or pomegranate flavored.  Big hit in our home, and a recipe I usually make when we have company.

This was amazing.  Only changes I did were regular milk with a teaspoon of vanilla.  I did not have any walnuts so l could not add them but, could tell they would have been a great addition.  I cooked this the night before to have for my week long breakfast and I could not be more pleased with the results.  I reheated in microwave with a 1/4 c of milk.  Once warm I did put a small scoop of coconut yogurt on top.  It was so creamy and smooth, loved it.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Perfect for a cold day!  I used steel cut oats, dried blueberries and only half of the maple syrup so it wasn't overwhelming and it was great!  And even have some left over for the next couple of days.

I found it a refreshing change to my normal "Oatmeal Bar".  I made it as per the directions with the exception of using 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 water, and I used pineapple yogurt instead of plain. All of my changes were due to using ingredients I had on hand at the time. Very nice on a cold, snowy day : )

This definitely is a tasty way to eat your oatmeal. As far as the health part goes, you should probably be concentrating more on eating the oats and less on the other ingredients that are high in sugar.

I loved this and I don't really care for oatmeal as a rule.
My husband loved it as well.
Made it by the recipe except for the coconut, next time I will add that too.
I put the drizzle of honey on top but not the yogurt.

Excellent! I scaled this down to one serving, and it was the perfect amount. I used unsweetened coconut milk because I had it on hand, and it needed to be used. I skipped the raisins and topped with a little brown sugar. It's great to have a few extra moments to make this. Nice recipe!

This is an awesome breakfast. I loved it. I cooked it in coconut milk instead of soy. I put a scoop of yogurt on top but I think it will taste just as good with or without the yogurt. I also love that it makes a lot so I can warm it up on days that I'm in a rush to get out the door.

I have eaten oatmeal for a long time.  I also like to add raisins and brown sugar.  I normally don't add the honey or yogurt.  But I loved the idea of coconut.  I now add the coconut to my oatmeal.

Yum! Did not use the raisins (used plenty of cranberries though), honey, or yogurt. I used 2% milk. Subbed brown sugar for maple syrup b/c my hubby can't stand syrup. We loved this! Whoever is giving bad ratings...not sure what you are looking for in oatmeal because this is fabulous, and this is from someone who has never been a big oatmeal eater!

This was a tasty way to start the day.  I used 1% milk and added a dash of vanilla and it worked out perfectly.

I love the coconut and oatmeal combo. I switched it up a bit by substituting 2/3 water, 1/3 Trader Joe's light coconut milk for the soy milk. I also added 1/2 cup fat free powedered milk. I hate to drink powdered milk but it adds creaminess if you cook with it. I also find that the oatmeal is creamier if you add the oats to the cold liquid(s) and then bring things to a boil.

This is a really easy and versatile recipe.  I accidentally used molasses instead of maple syrup (I know, I don't know what I was thinking) but it was still good.  My kids especially loved it with the tartness of the greek vanilla yogurt.

Really Delicious!  Different enough from plain oatmeal to feel like you are eating something special.  I thought it was a bit on the sweet side for breakfast.  Next time I might try unsweetened coconut. I didn't have any walnuts, so topped mine with sliced almonds. I also used water instead of milk, but missed the creaminess of the milk so next time I should definitely follow the recipe ;)

Will definitely make this one but try it with coconut milk (unsweetened in the carton like regular milk). We make all of our oatmeal and most of our rice with it...so, so yummy! Although I haven't tried it yet, I can taste it already so will give it four stars! :-)

Too sweet for me. Next time I'll reduce the syrup. Otherwise it was great!

Really liked this oatmeal. I used agave nectar instead of the maple syrup and I tried it the first time with the yogurt, but didn't like it. Don't think it needs the yogurt or extra honey. My one year old loved it too, minus the walnuts:)
