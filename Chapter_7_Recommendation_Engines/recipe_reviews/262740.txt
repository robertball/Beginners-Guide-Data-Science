Needs something else. By itself it tastes like it is missing something.  So I added vanilla yogurt with maple syrup as a dip with the berries , in addition to low fat cream cheese lemon drizzle over the top of the bars. That was very nice. I got many complements on it

First time for the mixed berry blend with oatmeal and it is delicious. It is on the menu for all the time!
