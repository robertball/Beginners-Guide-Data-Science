This is pretty good considering it has no sour cream and breaks down great nutritionally.  I used plain Greek yogurt, so there was no need to drain as written in step #1, making this even easier.  Only thing that I would change in the future is cutting back on the lemon juice.  For us, it was just a little too much lemon flavor, but it did work well on gyros (another recipe on this site), and I definitely will make again.

We've been looking for Tzatziki for awhile the was close to our favorite Greek restaurant.  This one is amazing!  We also used the Greek Yogurt so we didn't have to wait for it to drain.  Definitely tastes better the second day after it has time to marinate in the fridge.

The only thing I did differently was use a nonfat Greek yogurt that was low moisture and didn't need straining overnight. It is great for sandwiches, souvlaki, an alternate salad dressing, and had the flavor I was looking for.

This recipe has all of the right ingredients, but it needs more of them.  I increased the garlic to 3 cloves, (could barely taste it with only 1 clove).  It also needed more lemon juice, increased to 2-3 tablespoon.  I also increased the chopped parsley to 1/4 cup.
