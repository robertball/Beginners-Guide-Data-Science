This was a great chowder recipe.  My 6 yr old turned her nose up at it and said it didn't look good, but after tasting it she loved it and wants to eat it every day.  I made a couple changes.  I didn't have any thyme or savory so I added some celery seed and old bay seasoning.  And I happen to have some light cream that needed to be used, so I subed 1 1/2 c. & 1/2 c. milk for the 2c. milk.

I have never made clam chowder, and this was easy and very good! I used chopped clams instead of minced so that clams would be a little larger.

This is similar to a chowder I make called Down East Chowder. Instead of using fresh potatoes I use bagged shredded hashbrowns. It gives it a more meaty texture.

My sister and I really liked this soup.  The only thing we didn't like was the amount   of parsley.  It was overpowering.  We're  going to make it again with much less parsley and a little more bacon and then we are going to ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!

This is a very good clam chowder. I substituted Jennie's 99% fat-free turkey bacon for real bacon, and used NuSalt to lower the sodium, and it turned out just fine. As a bonus, I made it for a Christmas party, and the "bacon" and parsley added festive colors for the occasion.

VERY YUMMY!!  I had a bottle of clam juice that I wanted to use up, so I subbed it for the water.  And I didn't have any milk, so I used half-and-half, instead.  Also...I had only 4 strips of bacon so I used them all up...2 strips crumbled and mixed in as suggested, and 2 strips crumbled over the top to serve!  As someone else suggested, this is a hearty main course when served with a side of crusty bread and salad...and that's exactly what I did, too!  Most excellent...no leftovers, though.  Next time, I will double everything so I can enjoy the leftovers for at least another day!  Thank you for sharing this simple, and very tasty recipe!!  I will make it again and again!

This was a very tasty, flavorful dish, but it was a bit thin. I would recommend putting in some cornstarch or flour to thicken it.

Really wonderful recipe.  I used more bacon, substituted half and half for the milk and added a can of sweet corn.  My husband had me make it twice in one week...he loves it!

I substituted unsweetened soy milk for my dairy-allergic family and it was very tasty.  Even better with bacon bits on top.

Just the recipe I was looking for. I wanted to make clam chowder for my husband before he came home from work and this recipe was perfect because it had all the ingredients on hand without me running to the store. I added a little bit more bacon than the recipe required. Great Clam Chowder soup!!!!! Highly recommend to anyone.

East, basic, delicious.  My family loved this- a few changes- I added minced celery, a tiny bit of garlic (because I put garlic in everything!) -  I added a LOT more clams (made 10 servings and used 7 -6oz cans of clams)  and used mostly clam juice from the canned clams in place of the water.  But it was going to be TOO thin before all of the milk was added, so I used less milk and put a bit of cornstarch in some clam juice to thicken it.  I omitted the parsley and Savory because I had none.  The leftovers were gone in a flash the next day.  The next time I will add some milk earlier because I don't want to leave out the milk, which makes it rich.

LOVED THIS! I made this with cream instead of milk and seafood stock instead of water. I also didn't put bacon in it because I didn't feel like making any, and it was freakin' amazing! Seriously good.

Very delicious! We used half the milk/half and half it called for, and triple the black pepper and some red pepper flakes! Also threw some shrimp in there, cut them into three pieces, gave it great color and another texture! It was amazing!!

I thought I followed the recipe pretty close. What changes I did make should have helped the results - 4 slices of bacon instead of 2, a stalk of celery - but I ended up with a watery mild flavored soup. It was good...just not what we think of when we say "clam chowder". Not the hearty comfort fare we expected.

Very good! I didn't really measure the water, and I probably put in more milk, but this taste good. I was tempted to add celery; I love celery in soup's like this. I am eating it right now. :-)

Excellent and easy; a definite keeper.  The only thing I changed was that I used leftover cooked, cubed potatoes; I browned them with the onions and it was very tasty.  I reduced the overall cooking time since the potatoes were already cooked.  My only problem is that with 3 grown men to feed, there were no leftovers!  This would serve 6 as a soup course, but as a main course (served with crusty bread and a salad) I wouldn't plan on getting more than 4 servings.

This recipe was very good.  I think using half and half instead of milk would make it even better. I only had one can of clams so I uused that and also a can of smoked mussels. I also used more bacon. Everyone enjoyed...thanks for the recipe!
