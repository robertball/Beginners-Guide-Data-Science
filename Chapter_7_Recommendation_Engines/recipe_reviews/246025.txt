This turned out amazing! My enhancements were as follows: added 1 cup of diced baby bella mushrooms, and swapped out the cream with cashew milk. Because I didn’t have gluten-free bread crumbs, I grated some herbed  Parmesan cheese on top and let it bubble and lightly brown. There was no time for picture-taking-we dug right in!  This recipe will go on our rotation for sure.

My husband and I both really liked this one. It did lack a little something. I think when I make it again, I will add a little garlic to it and maybe a cheese blend instead of just the plain cheddar.  We took leftovers to work and everyone wanted to know what we were eating that smelled so good.

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my son, 10 months old. Very cheesy. I did add garlic to the sautéed onions.

Loved this recipe.  I knew I wanted to try this recipe until my husband told me he did NOT like tuna casserole.  I decided to make it anyway and he LOVED IT!!!  He went back for seconds.  I altered the recipe by using fresh spinach and 2 cloves of garlic.  Topped it with crushed red pepper and it was superb!!

Definitely will be making this again.

Loved this! I have SIBO so I have to make adjustments since onion is difficult as well as peas for me to eat. We used green onions at the beginning and added green beans instead of peas. I also added the tuna to the pot as I was adding the cream and other ingredients so that it would absorb more flavor. We also love herbs so we added cilantro, oregano and a lemon and Himalayan salt blend from Trader Joe’s to the original mixture ( Has a small amount of onion and garlic when ground). We also added more diced green onion to the top of the casserole as well as toasted gluten-free diced bread before cooking. We sprayed this lightly with avocado oil spray. We cooked with aluminum foil for 15 minutes and then for 5 minutes without to brown the top. LOVED IT! Tasted just like my mom used to make. May try it with a dairy-free milk next time like one user suggested.

Following other reviewers advice I added garlic but omitted the spinach because I didn’t know I had any until it was too late! I added fresh mushrooms because they’re on the verge of going bad. Very yummy and a definite keeper!

Such a delicious dish! This would be great to bring to a potluck or for a family night in. I sautéed onion first in ghee, added two heaps of minced garlic, and then added defrosted peas in same pan along with red pepper flakes (3 pinches). S&P followed then added 3/4 cup spinach. If you like spinach, be sure to add the whole cup and maybe just a tad more on top of that. I ran out of cream so I added half and half to the sauce however be sure to add the full 2 cups if not more. After the sauce reduces, you'll miss the extra bit of liquid as the noodles absorb the sauce very quickly. I love the cheesiness of this sauce by the way-such a great flavor with the few revisions. I covered the casserole with a thick layer of panko crumbs because we like the extra crunch. A real easy dish and a clear winner in our home.

My son and husband looooooved it and they are NOT gluten free, but instead of using gluten free bread crumbs, I used crumbled up Chedder Whisps.

Just finished this tuna recipe and it was very good. The only problem I had was with the cheese.  I didn’t mix it enough ,  and there were small clumps of cheese here and there.  Other than that, we liked it and I will make again . I just have to mix better.   I also used half & half , about 1 1/2 cups. Very good, thank you

This dish is so versatile! I used my own homemade gluten free bread crumbs that I added various Italian spices to and Banza penne pasta (made with chickpeas). I added a few spices because salt and pepper alone isn't enough (coriander, paprika and turmeric). I also added garlic to the onions!

This was super easy to make & loved by all in our house, even non-GF folks.

I read the reviews and added garlic to the recipe. It was just perfect. 

5 Stars Yum!

My family loved this twist on the traditional tuna casserole. I doubled the spinach because it shrinks so much and to pack nutrients. I also used the best tuna-skipjack- from our local Co op. I think that quality brought the flavor up.

This was delish! The only problem I had was with the big can of starkist tuna I used. It had a ton of bones in it and my boyfriend and I couldn’t even finish the leftovers. Other than that, holy smokes it was sooo good.

I concurred with the group and also added garlic to the recipe! We added 5 cloves after the onion simmer translucent. We cooked garlic for a minute on medium before adding peas. I also added a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the onion for a little zing, not hot or spicy. 

This recipe was exceptional! My husband who has celiac rarely gives recipes a five star rating. He gave this recipe 5 star. This is a great family weekday casserole! Budget friendly and tasty.

I was looking for a good tuna casserole recipe and came across this and had all the ingredients. I substituted the heavy cream with half and half and used regular pasta. It came out really good. I would make this again when I am in the need for a comfort food dinner.

This recipe was delicious! It was rich and flavorful and my family loved it. I used raw cheese instead of pasteurized cheese and himalayan salt (which added additional flavor). It definitely seemed flavorful enough for my family, but it could have been due to the changes I mentioned.
