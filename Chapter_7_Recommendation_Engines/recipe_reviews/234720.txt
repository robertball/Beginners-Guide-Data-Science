WOW. Addictive! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cut this recipe in half. It yielded 30 cookies. I also cut the sugar by 1/3, and used 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white sugar for this halved recipe. I added a half a teaspoon nutmeg and substituted applesauce for half of the oil.

I just made these and the recipe yielded 81 good-sized cookies - not 2 dozen! I made it with 1/4 c oil and 3/4 applesauce and 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar.  They are very cake-like, but good.  Very easy to make and took exactly 10 minutes.

Definitely cut the sugar in half. You'll never miss it. 
I also made it with whole wheat flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Yummy.

They were very spongy, and the recipe made about 100 cookies! I would divide this recipe in half.

Delicious! I used  a half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar, a half cup oil and half cup applesauce and also half whole wheat flour. Super soft, perfectly sweet, and very easy. Made about 72 cookies.

I made these for Thanksgiving goodie bags. They were an absolute hit! Everyone was scrambling for more! I made them with one cup of melted shortening instead of oil. I wouldn't change a thing. Not too moist, packaged up great and were melt in your mouth yummy.

I read some of the reviews and cut the recipe in half as others suggested. These were so delicious. I've made them a few times and people just love them as do I. The changes I made were: olive oil instead of vegetable oil, I added a little pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon and organic raw sugar instead of white sugar. Yum. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 apple sauce. I also added a whole bunch of extra spices.. ginger, all spice, white pepper, nutmeg.  
I also cut the sugar to use 1 c brown and 1/4 c white.  And I used half whole wheat flour and only 1 C chocolate chips.  So even with that increase in nutrition, they were pretty decent.
My kids loved them.  My daughter brought them to her 1st grade class (and no, she does not go to any sort of private school for organic granola type kids) for her b.day and she said the kids thought they were great!  
They are kind of cake like so best to eat up right away. Not the kind of cookie that can sit on the counter for days. Besides, when they are so good and healthy, who can leave them on the counter anyway?

I've been making these cookies for almost 10 years every fall and winter. This is a fun cookie to make with children. No decorating just mix, bake and eat. I have used white chocolate and butterscotch chips. As well.

My daughter made these for a pot luck dinner with her coworkers and they were absolutely delicious!  She substituted white chocolate chips for the milk chocolate chips.  They made a lot more than 2 dozen, probably close to 40 or 50 cookies I think, and they were big sized cookies too.

Delicious cookies. I cut the sugar in half and used pumpkin pie spice and a bit of extra cinnamon. I made them a decent size and got 50 - perfect amount for my work event. I also baked for 14 minutes and got a lovely slightly crispy top and bottom.

So good! Makes SO MANY cookies, you should probably halve the recipe!  I made some changes for health- 1/2 coconut oil instead of veggie oil. 1/4 pea protein to 3/4 flour. I shredded dark chocolate sea salt into the mix (always amazing!) and these are among the best cookies I’ve ever made!

Fantastic recipe! These were perfect. Very fluffy, not overwhelming & taste great. I don’t understand the reviews saying the taste of baking powder or soda is too overwhelming- there didn’t seem to be anything “off” or too much of in the ingredients. They really turned out perfect, flavor & consistency! 

The only thing I will add for my input on making this- form the cookies on the sheet the way you want them to bake. They won’t spread much like a normal, chocolate chip cookie due to the consistency of the pumpkin. So, if you make a heap with stiff spikes- that is what will come out of the oven. If you want a more classic, rounded cookie shape- you need to make the effort to slightly “shape” them on the pan before baking. The consistency allows this, fairly easily. Also- this recipe does yield quite a few cookies... but I didn’t get near the “double” recipe as others stated. I think most were putting a dollop on & not flattening/shaping- that will use dough waaay less than making a decent-size cookie, not a dollop that you expect to “spread” while baking. These won’t expand & spread like that, so make them to the size you want to see coming out of the oven. 

This is my new go-to pumpkin cookie recipe!

Using a cookie scoop this recipe made 5 dozen cookies.  Also, I replaced the oil with applesauce, added a half teaspoon nutmeg and an eighth teaspoon allspice.

Only reason it's not 5 stars is because I omitted the chocolate chips (didn't have any). Otherwise, these were amazing. Wonderful pumpkin flavor. Next time, I will probably add a few chocolate chips just to see if it makes them better. I feel like it would overwhelm the pumpkin though.

I made this and found the dough to be more like quick bread dough than cookie dough.  Added about another 3/4 cup flour and more spices.  I found just adding cinnamon left the cookie dough rather bland.  Added some nutmeg and cloves to zip it up a little.  It was a good cookie but don't think I'll make it again.

I love these, though they're not your usual cookie. Very cake like, and not as sweet. (Which I happen to love, my family, not so much). I've made them a few times, and I like to add some nutmeg. Also have substituted walnuts for chocolate chips which was great!

Delicious! I did taste the baking soda a bit as others have mentioned, but it didn't ruin the cookie for me. Next time I'd use a bit less. Also subbed pumpkin chips (seasonal item at my local store) instead of chocolate chips and they were great!

In fairness to this recipe I made them only once and made changes so my changes may have affected how these turned out.

Change 1 - I cut this recipe in half beause others warned it makes a lot of cookies. Cutting it in half yielded 3 dozen cookies.

Change 2 - I used fresh pumpkin puree which is more watery than canned.

Change 3 - I omitted the milk because of the added moisture from the fresh pumpkin puree. 

Change 4 - I used between a half of a cup and a cup more flour than the recipe called for as the dough was just too watery. I didn't measure what I added. I just kept adding in small amounts until I reached the proper consistency.

Change 5 - I added pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. 

When baking at 375 as this recipe calls for the bottoms of the cookies became over cooked while the center of the cookie was still raw. This was after only being in the oven for 5 and half of the 10 minutes the recipe calls for. Turning down the oven to 350 helped but the bottoms still got over baked after only 7 minutes. Is this the fault of my changes? Is my oven too hot? Was it because I greased the cookie sheet as instructed (even though I find that usually leads to over cooked cookie bottoms)? Is this how the cookies are supposed to turn out? I don't know.

Over all despite being over baked on the bottom the cookies were still edible. They're soft, moist, and cakey. The flavour however is severely lacking. I taste no pumpkin at all. The cinnamon (and pumpkin pie spice

Was very disappointed in the taste of these cookies.  Not much pumpkin flavor at all.  They are more like a glorified chocolate chip cookie - I would not make them again.  Also - calls for way too much sugar.

LOVED these cookies!!! I did however make a few adjustments.
1. Instead of vegetable oil I used Coconut Oil.
2. I used Self-Rising Flour and omitted the baking powder, soda and salt (I didn't have All-Purpose on hand).
3. I added a couple dashes of Nutmeg and Clove.
4. Omitted the chocolate chips.
Will definitely make these again!

You don't need to make any changes, these are great as recipe states. And yes they are cake like but that's what makes them uniquely soft and wonderful. I use a natural (non-GMO) sugar.

These did not have much flavor. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin and like another reviewer said- they had an overwhelming taste of baking soda and powder.  I could not find my grandmothers pumpkin cookie recipe that I usually make and thought of just finding one here.  Sad face

Used recommendations by others by adjusting to 
1 C Sugar, 1/4 C oil, 3/4 C applesauce, 2 tsp pumpkin spice.  Came out perfect. Quantity is perfect for all of us to enjoy as I was able to keep some home, send  to my son and daughter in college!!

I made these using whole wheat flour instead, and they were delicious.  The biggest surprise (I admit to not having read the comments) was the size of the cookies when you try to make 24.  I'd equate them to jumbo muffin tops.  Kids were super excited to see the small cake, but my son was quick to say to his sister that she could only have one each day!

Loved these cookies. First time I made them I followed the recipe, very excellent. Second time I made them I cut the sugar in half and added Half a teaspoon ofpumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. I also forgot to add the milk. The recipe still came out wonderful both in taste and the way they cooked. I will probably stick with the less sugar going forward. Definitely try these cookies you won't be disappointed.

I thought these cookies were great. It was like putting a pumpkin chiffon cake, pumpkin pie, and chocolate chip cookies together.  I changed it up slightly by adding 1 cup light brown sugar in substitute for 1 cup of white sugar. I also did 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice 1/4 tsp ginger and 1\8 tsp clove.  Definitely perfect during the holiday season!

Made these cookies...everyone liked them and was surprised by the soft inside.  They were very tasty but I think next time I will use less chocolate chips as some of the cookies were overpowered by chocolate chips flavoured.
