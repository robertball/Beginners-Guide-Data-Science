This is an incredibly delicious and hearty soup (one I make often), especially considering its ease in preparation and its simplicity.  I do love baby spinach but I love Swiss Chard even better, so I chose to use that instead, including the ribs, which I sliced like celery and simmered in the soup for ten minutes before adding the chopped leaves and the beans.  On this occasion I also cooked the ditalini separately so I could control how much Hubs and I each put in our bowls. I also added some cooked chicken, a chopped, red-ripe tomato and finished each serving with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. This soup is one of the best comfort foods I know.

This recipe, despite its name, is the best "pasta e fagioli" on this site.  I reduced the broth by about 1/4 because I like soups that are a bit thicker.  It tastes okay as is if served w/ a generous topping of grated parmesan cheese.  Without the cheese, it's a bit lacking in depth of flavor.  By adding ~1 tsp. of lemon juice and a small pinch of chipotle pepper powder (to give a smoky flavor) I gave it enough flavor to stand on its own w/o the cheese.  Anyhow, thank you, Lisa, for giving me the right proportions of ingredients for a real "pasta e fagioli".  I really enjoyed it.

This is a great soup!  I used chicken stock instead of broth and I also added about six sprigs of fresh thyme (leaves only), juice from 1/2 a fresh lemon and a few dashes of McCormick "italian herbs" seasoning.  I also added grated parmesean cheese and a little EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) to each individual serving - the EVOO & parm added to the presentation and the flavor was great.  My hubby loved it and said this should be a keeper!! The leftovers tasted even better the next day.  Yum!

This was very good.  I made it as written using mini bow ties for my pasta.  The only change I would make next time is to coarsely chop the spinach, rather than putting the leaves in whole.  Even after wilting I thought some pieces were quite large.  I also think frozen chopped spinach would work well in this.  One word of caution – if you think you’re going to have leftovers, cook your pasta separately and add it to the soup when serving, otherwise the pasta will soak up a lot of the broth and you will no doubt have to add more broth to your leftovers.

This is a great recipe, easy to make and tastes just like the Beans & Greens from a wonderful restaurant called Umberto's.
I use a little more garlic, and add extra beans. Excellent !

Bland, until I added a shake of hot pepper flakes and shredded some real parm on top of each bowl.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I added a large can of diced tomato, and used chicken stock and mini bowties.  I seasoned with some crushed red pepper, italian seasonings, some celery salt and some regular kosher salt, and pepper.  I added some fresh grated parmesan to each bowl. This will definitely be in regular rotation during the cooler months.

Happy tummy!  So good!  I used orzo, and kale instead of spinach.  Also added celery, a can of diced tomatoes and some smoked turkey sausage.  The stock I used was pretty bland, so I added some dried thyme, parsley, a tad of ground cayenne and a ton of black pepper.  Gave my dad a bunch to take home since he loved it too.  Yes, pasta in soup will absorb the broth as it sits, so I just add some water when heating up leftovers.  Not ideal, since the pasta does get mushy, but when a soup is this great I don't care all that much.  I often cook pasta separately from soup for just this reason, and store the leftovers separately.  Didn't bother this time.  Garlic, greens and beans RULE.

Really a good soup if you season it well. IF you use ORZO, DO NOT use a full cup. I made it with a full cup and when I put it in the refridgerator overnight, the orzo soaked up ALL of the broth and all I had left was orzo and beans no broth at all. I would say 1/2 cup would be fine but definitely NOT a full cup!!

I followed the recipe as it directed.  It was good and filling without a ton of calories.  It would be fine to add chicken to it but for me it was a nice change to not eat meat and still feel satisfied after eating a bowl of it.  Nice on a cold night!

Very good !! The only suggestion I have is to cook the ditalini as directed, but DON'T put the pasta in the soup. It will get overcooked. Instead leave it out after cooking, you may oil it slightly (to keep it from sticking together) The put a portion in the bottom of the bowl, add the hot soup on top. This method is useful especially if you double recipes to freeze as I do, the pasta stays perfectly al dente until you are ready to eat it.

As is it would probably be kinda bland, but it gave me something to start with.  I added sliced carrots and chopped celery, because I needed to use them and I thought they would be good in this soup. I also added much more seasonings (about 1/2 tsp each of dried oregano and thyme, plus about 2 tsp of dried parsley, and a couple shakes of cayenne pepper), along with a chicken boullion cube + 1 cup of water because I only had 5 cups of chicken broth.  I used elbow macaroni because it was the only small pasta I had, but next time I would like to try it with whole wheat pasta to make it even healthier.  My husband gobbled it up and said it was "outstanding," but he says that about almost everything I make so I don't know whether or not to believe him.  I thought it was quite tasty. Very healthy and filling!

LOVED THIS SOUP! So easy to make and great flavor too! Made exactly as written and would not change a thing. Reminded me a little of the greens and beans that my family makes. This is definately going into the dinner rotation! Thanks for sharing. :)

I will have to admit, I was skeptical as this cooked.  This was my first attempt at beans and greens and I'm not a big fan of greens.  This was awesome!  I cooked it and put it in the fridge overnight, put it back on the stove the next night and thickened it up then served it over rice.  I will definately make this again!

Absolutely fantastic!  You know when you are craving something and you can't put your finger on exactly what?  Well, this soup was PERFECT!  I used fresh, regular spinach and Great Northern White Beans and it was awesome!

This was very delicious and easy to make.  I used orzo. And even though it was a little bland, I will make this again.  Next time I'll try using the garlic flavored chicken broth and more garlic (you can't have enough garlic!).

This was just ok. A couple weeks earlier, I'd made pretty much the same soup but no spinach and no beans and it was somehow way more flavourful. This was still alright though, I'd make it again and play with seasoning. Fresh grated parmeson or romano cheese is a must for sprinkling on top! That was the best part.

This soup is so simple and quick.There really is no prep and the whole thing can be done in under 30 mins. So flavorful. I have made this several times in the last year or so and have used both canned broth and my own. When I use canned I sometimes added additional garlic and onion powder but my own already has it. I also, usually just put in a couple of handfuls of frozen spinach and that works beautifully. I've sent to sick friends and they loved it and now I am sharing the recipe with others as well. This is a definite keeper.

Fantastic! I did add extra garlic and used 6 tsp of Better than Bullion No Chicken Base to 7 c. of water instead of broth. Simple and perfect as is. Because it is so simple I would suggest not using frozen spinach or a generic broth. Great comfort food.

JUST what I needed tonight! I didn't have to go to the store, didn't have to do much prep, didn't have to do much thinkin to throw this together and have a delicious dinner tonight (and lunch tomorrow and the next day and the next day...). It's just me this week, so this couldn't have been a more perfect meal (the other half prefers meat, which I could easily add some cooked chicken to this...). I followed Naples substitution and added swiss chard since it's what I had on hand. Excuse me while I got eat my dinner... :)

This recipe is awesome! I added carrots, doubled the noodles and added water to make up for the extra ingredients. It is definitely something my family will be doing again! Also, my husband topped his with shredded pepper jack cheese! WOW! good call. I recommend every cheese lover trying that.

I love this.  I made it today and doubled the amount because I'm sick and want to have this for the next few days.  I also added some browned pork loin, cut into very small strips.  It adds a little color and flavor and a little more protein.

incredibly good...unbelievably good given how simple it is. used regular spinach instead of baby spinach, added a cup of raw chicken breast cut into 1-2 inch pieces...did that when the pasta was just about cooked. Other than that stuck to recipe...family scarfed it up.

Delicious and can be made quickly.  I ended up making the soup in the morning and added the spinach to it when I heated it up for dinner.  I did add some italian herbs to it.  Thanks submitter.

This is a good soup. But (of course), I made a few changes: (a) instead of tiny pasta, I used Pearl Barley; (b) instead of Baby Spinach (which I love and use a lot), I used fresh green beans (not a particular family favorite, but they were on an INCREDIBLE sale; I mean $0.59/lb.); and (c) I quartered 3 medium sized tomatoes and "tossed them into the mix". Spiced to our liking, topped with a "cheese of your choice" (I usually keep at least 5 different varieties on hand) and served with a buttered "dense" bread (I used a SourDough loaf), we had no leftovers. I consider that a SUCCESS! Will make again (with Spinach. though).

I used two cans of cannellini beans, acini de pepe past and 1 pkg frozen spinach. I would cut down on the pasta next time (very thick), 1/2c and needed to add additional broth. This was really good and easy. Great winter meal, very hearty

Quick and delicious!.  The only substitution I made was in the use of Penne Pasta as that is what I had on hand. I will be making this more often.

This is a great little soup as is. Quick, easy and tasty. Use this recipe as your base and adjust as you see fit. I love beans and greens soup and plenty of garlic is a must. Today, I did not have spinach but I did has organic Tuscan Kale so it needed to simmer a few minutes longer. Turned out excellent. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Good hearty soup! I added ground sausage, a can of diced tomatoes drained, celery salt to taste, and used large pearl couscous for the pasta and cooked and stored that part separately so it wouldn’t absorb all of the broth.

I’m trying to boost my potassium and thought this would make a nice lunch to bring to work. I used spinach, cannelini beans.  It’s quite delish and I already made my 2nd batch. Super easy and tasty.

Delicious! Thank you so much for the recipe! 

After reading some reviews, we did add some celery salt and a little  “heat” for our family who likes more seasoning. But it was totally delicious and I will make it again for sure!

Delicious!  I make this often, and usually start with a small amount of ham or bacon, then follow the recipe as written and add a good amount of parmesan cheese and ground pepper at the end, with extra on the side if anyone wants more.   I know Olive Garden puts tomatoes in their Pasta Fagioli, but I prefer it this way.  Yum!

This soup was quick to make and very delicious. I was quite surprised by how tasty it was. I did beak the little stems off the spinach because I wasn't sure it they would interfere with the texture of the soup. I let a coworker taste the soup and she loved it as well.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me!

This turned out really, really well although I used a slow cooker and didn't use chicken broth. I used water, added a can of diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup of lentils to make it bean-ier without big beans. If you make it in a slow cooker, put the pasta in about 30-60 minutes before you're ready to eat. I'll make it again for sure. Thanks for posting it.

We (adults, not our child, though) enjoyed this soup a lot, and it was easy to throw together.  I did also add about 10 cherry tomatoes  cut in half, crushed the garlic rather than chopping it, and used less  spinach  than called-for.  (I used frozen spinach, and it came out fine.)   I used about 2 level Tablespoons of vegetable broth powder (containing salt) in about 6 cups of water.

I love this soup, but I made two tiny changes to it.  I rough chopped the  spinach to make it more manageable, and I used vegetable broth to make this dish more vegetarian friendly.

Delicious and easy soup. I had some kale that needed to be used up and subbed that for the spinach. Of course kale needs to be cooked longer so I added it at the very first when the broth is added and cooked for 10 minutes before adding the beans and pasta. It's snowing here in Colorado and this soup is comforting. I can't wait to try chard from my garden next summer in this soup. Thanks Lisa

This is delicious! It is a hit with everyone in my house, it is in our rotation for dinner on a pretty regular basis. I add more garlic, and I use Kale instead of Spinach. I have added both turkey sausage and roasted garlic Kielbasa, and also made it with no meat. Although the addition of meat makes it a bit heartier, it is not necessary, and since I try to cook meatless at least twice a week, I usually go without.

I doubled the beans - 2 cans - and chard (because I had a lot), and topped with a generous pinch of shredded Parmesan. I liked this.  My wife asked for hers to be minus the greens, then complained it lacked flavor...Hmm...But, the soup really needs salt (at the table - I never salt soup while cooking, especially soup that starts with broth); and next time I will add some combination of Italian herbs, basil, thyme, savory, chili powder, black pepper...Maybe crisp bacon pieces.

Made this one exactly as written...and it was good! What's even better is that it really does lend itself to simple variations like using a little chicken or bits of ham. How good would bacon be as garnish...or more? Really do need to heed the "just till wilted" instruction for the spinach. Oh! Wouldn't chopped green onions be pretty (and tasty) on this!

This tastes amazing. I made it for my family and they absolutely LOVED it. Even the baby that barely eats anything ate most of hers. For the broth, I just used knorr's chicken bouillon and added way more than six cups (I have a family of six so I probably put 14 cups). I also put just a bit of cumin (because the knorr mix can be a little salty), some granulated garlic, and some onion powder. I also substituted baby arugula  instead of spinach. It came out great.

I used frozen spinach - 3 "lumps" and small bow tie pasta. It's pretty good!

Came across this on a chilly spring day, craving some nourishing comfort. I made some changes based on what I had on hand. I had some barley I needed to use so subbed that for pasta, and subbed garbanzos for the cannelini. I had about 1/2 an onion and used dehydrated garlic. I added lemon juice and turmeric to taste, and before serving, a handful of fresh chopped tomatoes, cilantro and Swiss chard. Super yummy and very adaptable, easy, quick and healthy! Will be a go to!

Not bad but boring. I added some additional herbs and some parmesan to try to give it something extra, but it didn't really do the trick. My husband didn't like it at all, but he's a tough sell anyway. Wish I had liked it better.

Great soup and made it in less than 30 minutes. I used 8 cloves of garlic because I love it and hear from other reviews that it was not flavorful. I also added 1 seeded jalapeno chopped in with the garlic and onion. I added fresh garden chives and chopped parsley. I did a rough chop with my fresh spinach and am glad that I did otherwise you would get a large mouthful of it. The final test...the flavor is wonderful. Will make again for sure & it

This is great!  I put canola oil in place of olive oil cause I didn't have olive oil.  I let the onions and garlic brown (caramelize),  and I used better than bouillon brand chicken stock because I didn't have canned or homemade stock. I used red pepper instead of black pepper.  It still turned out to be a great recipe!

This was an easy and delicious soup!  I used green onion which was great.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  I threw in a sliced carrot for color and it ended up a very pretty soup.  I will definately make this in the future!

This was a very yummy soup--filling and comforting on this chilly, fall night.  My only changes was that I didn't drain the beans because I like the thickness the liquid gives the soup.  I also didn't have ditalini, so I broke up angelhair pasta.  I always think beans can be a little tough, especially when they are canned, so I added a healthy squirt of ketchup to the water with the beans and pasta.  Really good!
