These are the best baked beans I have ever made.  I get actual cheers and requests for these beans.  I do them in a crockpot.  I also substitute for what ever beans I have on hand.  I have even substituted for other butters.  They have all turned out yummy!

This is an easy baked bean type dish.  It is pretty with the different color beans.  I wasn't sure about the cumin, but it was quite good in the sweet sauce.

This was a good basic recipe. I doubled the recipe. I used 12 cups of cooked beans from a four bean combo that I cooked myself rather than canned beans. I used 1 cup of finely chopped onion and added 1 tsp of mustard, 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke; 2 cups of browned hamburger meat; and one small can of tomato paste. I left the salt out. I used a robust honey that almost tastes like molasses. The result was a little sweet  for me but was a total hit. Next time I will cut the honey in half.

Great, easy recipe with wonderful flavor.  I cooked in the slow cooker, as my oven was in use.  Turned it on low and let it go for a few hours.  I loved the cumin in this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This take on baked beans is delicious. It is awesome when made as directed but I added some Johnsonville brat slices which kicked it up a notch for me. I used store brand apple butter, which was fine and might try a bit more cayenne pepper next time. I used my slow cooker 2 hrs low than 2hrs hi. Don't hesitate, try it!

These are easy and a nice twist on regular baked beans.  I'd give them 5 stars as written.  I cook mine in the slow cooker and add a pack of real bacon pieces.  Makes a meal served with salad and cornbread.

I don't like baked beans and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used Apple butter that I made from the crock pot Apple butter recipe on this site. Awesome!

I would never thought to use apple butter in a baked bean recipe, but it turned out very good!

Great baked beans.  The apple butter gives a great sweetness.  I feel a lot better using apple butter over molasses.  I used the crockpot and put some onions in it.  The varied colors of beans gave it a much more appealing look.

These baked beans are the most delicious I have tasted.  I will certainly make them again.  I made this for a BBQ themed pitch-in at work.  I doubled all the ingredients as I needed to serve many.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon, which was great!  Everything else I followed exactly.  Everyone was talking about these beans and complimenting me on a job well done.  I ended up passing out this recipe to several colleagues.

Best baked beans we've had in a long time.  Modified it slightly.  The sauce would probably make a good barbeque sauce.
