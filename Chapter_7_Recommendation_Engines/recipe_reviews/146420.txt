Love this stuff.  I use ground pork instead of beef and omit the green peppers because the kids don't like them.  I make about 4 pounds of this chili on the weekend and it's mild enough to eat all week long.  It's low fat, fairly low carb, and high in protien and fiber, so you can easily lose weight on it.
