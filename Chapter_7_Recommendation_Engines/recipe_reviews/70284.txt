Good base but try using white wine instead of water. Deglaze before adding juices. I added minced jalapenos and cilantro for a little heat. I also added a pat of butter after reducing for a little creaminess.

This was fabulous! I was doing a "dinner in a hurry" and used fresh OJ, but botteled Lemon & Lime juices.  I added a little orange zest to brighten the flavor and a bit of ginger for kick. And I thickened with a little corn starch.  My hubby and I both loved it and I will be making this regularly.

Excellent, easy recipe. 

I tried it on salmon... prepared fish with very light oil and some salt, lightly brushed on glaze before grilling. Cooked as usual, recoat with glaze, and serve as a sauce. I'll break this one out for company I want to impress.

Delicious, simple, easy. I used this on broiled Tilapia: just brushed it on before broiling til done. I used fresh orange and lime juice and bottled lemon. I also used Stevia sweetener (one packet for 2 servings) and it worked properly. I added a little sprinkle of crushed red pepper to the fish before cooking, which was a nice flavor, too.

too sweet, would recommend trying with citrus juices on top of fish with some lemon pepper; much better; shame to waste fish with this glaze

this just didn't do it for us.  I was looking for more of an orange glaze and I think the lemon I used was way too big.  I used chicken stock in place of the water and a dash of balsamic vinegar.  Too lemony, next time leave out the lemon and lime, just use orange maybe.

I was looking for an easy way to give some flavor to my mahi mahi & this recipe worked great!  I didn't have a real orange so I used regular orange juice & cut back on the water and sugar a bit, but it still worked.  I'm sure with a freshly juiced orange, it would be even better!

Not thick enough to be a glaze. It was runny and I could hardly taste it. I was disappointed.

Very good but very sweet. I think maybe I would like it more with a little more fresh juice added in. Very good otherwise.

I wasn't impressed with this as written however after making many (many) changes I was able to salvage the results and turn them into something wonderful.  I added more orange juice, brown sugar, green onion, soy sauce, ginger, a little sriracha, and red pepper flakes along with small amount of cornstarch slurry and it was fantastic.  Obviously a totally different recipe...but I did start with it the way it was written before making changes.

You'll want to blend this all together before reducing it but instead of water use white wine, add a little bit of fresh dill (I used about half a sprig), and 2-3 cloves of minced garlic or use minced shallots. Another option is to saute your shallots/garlic and then add your juices.  Adds a lot more flavor and complexity to it!
