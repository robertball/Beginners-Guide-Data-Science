This recipe is awesome! I tried to make these early last week, but I misread the recipe and used too much butter, so I couldn't make them into balls. But then I made these for my boyfriend this last weekend and they turned out perfect. I had to refridgerate the batter for a little while because pouring hot, melted chocolate into dry indgrediants, of course, left it sticky and warm. When properly cooled, the icing won't smear around and you can put them in a lunchbox or even a ziplock bag.

Ohmigosh!  I was recently at a dessert party, and had something similar to these, and came looking on Allrecipes for a recipe for the cookie.  Bingo!  I found it.  These are sooooooo good!  I made the first batch as written, then made a second batch in the same bowl--didn't rinse it or anything--and made a second batch, only using mint extract in place of the almond, and vanilla in the glaze.  This was because I had a real "mint tooth" going on. (Although I'm not sure if they are still Austrian ;) ) I also replaced the nuts with mini chocolate chips in the second batch.  They are sooooo good, too!  The glaze seems to stay prettiest if it stays warm.  Mine got a bit grainy.  Thanks for a keeper!

I wanted to find a new cookie that would be a hit and this is it!  I doubled the original recipe and added a few mini-chocolate chips.

We just made this for my son's class project (had to make something Austrian since he studied Austria).  Wow!  Easy to make - I supervised my 12 year old and we followed the recipe exactly.  Our dough was very dry and I was worried if we had done something wrong.  They came out delicious, though!  We'll make these again as most of the cookies are going in to his class.

I'll admit, I have not frosted these yet, but I have eaten two of them right out of the oven. VERY rich, almost too rich, and very reminiscent of brownies. I think brownies would have been easier. We'll see how my cookie exchange likes them with the frosting on. That might put them over the edge into 'too righ' for my taste, but a die-hard chocolate buff would really enjoy them.

I was excited to try this recipe (a fix for my chocolate craving!) after reading the reviews, but this recipes disappointed me.  The texture was odd and I just didn't particularly care for the flavor.  I ate a couple and tossed the rest...not worth the calories at all  : ) Those who like a less sweet, darker chocolate taste may enjoy them, but I certainly won't be making them again!

It was either these or brownies, and I'm glad I chose these!  The chocolate flavor was just right--my mom said they tasted "gourmet".  Definitely a recipe to keep.

Ok, I made these into the tiny 3/4 inch balls the recipes calls for and baked them on parchment paper...which means they STAYED little tiny balls after they cooked.  I'm sure had I not used parchment, they would have spread a little.  They are very cute..but small!  The glaze did NOT work for me AT ALL.  I ended up melting some chocolate chips with a little shortening and just dipped in that.  They came out looking like little chestnuts...very cute for the holidays! :)  They taste good too!  The not too sweet cookie with the sweet chocolate on top is perfect!

I've made these 2 years in a row and they're a big hit.  For the icing I simply melt chocolate in a baggie and pipe it over the cookies in a decorative design.  This year I put a candied cherry in the center of a ball of dough before baking ... AN EVEN BIGGER HIT!!!!  Wonderful cookie.

These were so good I made the recipe twice in three days!  Each time I shared a few with someone then they each asked me for the recipe.  It's a lot easier to make than it sounds and the chocolately taste is YUM, YUM, YUM!

Not nearly as hard to make as they taste! My husband gives it 4 stars even though he's not a huge chocolate eater- if you are a die hard, super rich chocolate fan, these are amazing and surprisingly quick and easy! The hardest part was making sure they didn't overcook since the cookie dough is so dark. Wonderful!

The glaze never turns out for me, so I skip it. No one complains. The balls themselves are delicious--not too sweet, but definitely chocolatey. I've (accidentally) made them with the granulated and powdered sugar and both versions are good. The ones with the granulated sugar tastes sweeter, while the one with the powdered sugar taste smoother but less sweet. A great treat to make in very large batches.

What fantastic cookies! I used vanilla instead of almond extract but am looking forward to making them again and trying the almond. Super easy to make, very similar to a brownie.

My daughter made this recipe for a school project on Austria. They are delicious! The almond extract adds just enough almond flavor and they are beautiful with their little cap of chocolate icing.

Was a very good cookie with a brownie texture.  We used vanilla extract instead of the almond and pecans instead of walnuts (it's what we had available).  The only thing is that it made only 24 cookies, not the 42 noted as # of servings.

Pretty and delicious.  The chocolate and almond extract are delicious together.  They smelled wonderful when they were baking.  Thanks for a great recipe, Cindy.

With all the rave reviews, I'm sorry to be in the minority.

I found the cookie very easy to make. The texture perfect. However, I found the the taste of the almond extract was overpowering...

I would reduce this ingredient...and for chocolate lovers, I might even consider eliminating it.

Pretty cookie, easy to make....but not a 5 star cookie for me.

I just made these today.  The only thing I did differently with a few of them was sprinkle the tops with a teeny bit of salt.  Both were really good.  Oh...I omitted the walnuts and used imitation almond due to allergies.  I would definitely make these again.  Super fast, easy, and delicious!

We have been making this cookie recipe for the last three years! It one of my husbands favorites. My sister and I have found that you should make one batch at a time instead of doubling. Doubling changes the texture of the dough. Do not try and stretch the chocolate glaze, make more if you are running low (we learned our lesson on this one). To make quicker balls we roll the dough in a snake and then cut equal portions to hand roll in balls. This seems to speed up the process, especially when you are making a lot as we do. Enjoy!

If you don't want a sweet cookie, these are for you.  They have very good flavor and taste even better with the glaze!  I used a mixture of chopped pecans and almonds in mine.

These are great!  Definitely a grown-up cookie, though, as they are not too sweet and some kids might not like the almond flavoring.  I love it though.  I use ground or very finely chopped almonds in my recipe.

I just made these for Christmas and i just might have to make more to make up for the ones i eat! Recipe is easy. I love chocolate so i reduced the almond extract to 1/4 tsp and subbed choc chips for the nuts. A definite keeper. Will make again!(probably today)

I am so thankful I found this recipe when I was crazing chocolate. The only thing I would change is next time I won't make them when my kids have friends over. :) This recipe is perfect. A million thank yous Cindy.

These are just sinful. I made them with chocolate chips instead of nuts and a little bit of Kahlua because I wanted to see just how much flavour I could pack into them. They were like dense cookie balls, and the glaze made them so rich, I was surprised I managed to... eat half the batch myself!

These were great.  They were really easy to make yet look elegant.  I didn't have walnuts on hand, but they were good without anyway!

Adults LOVED this cookie!  I didn't care for the icing -- so I piped melted semisweet chips over the tops and then piped royal icing over that for a really beautiful presentation.  These will become an annual holiday favorite!

I just made these and they're ok.

A few modifications to the cookie recipe: I used an 86% cocoa chocolate bar because the grocery store didn't carry unsweetened chocolate. I also halved the sugar (wouldn't have done this if I was using unsweetened chocolate) and split the remaining amount 50-50 between cane sugar and brown sugar. I like the almond taste, but I didn't find the cookies anything to write home about.

The glaze recipe, as written, was a disaster. Not sure if it's because it was my first time trying to make glaze, but my first attempt was unsalvageable. Second time around, I melted the butter and chocolate, but then added 1 tbsp of milk before starting to add the sugar. Then I slowly added the sugar and as it would become too thick, I'd add another tbsp of milk. This finally worked for me. Glaze is good, ended with some leftover as well.

These cookies are wonderful! They are great with or without the chocolate frosting. They are basically chocolate amaretto cookies.

These were really tasty! They weren't too sweet and they looked so nice after they were frosted. I had run out of milk so I subbed French Vanilla Creamer for the milk in the glaze, and only put in 1-2T to make it more of a frosting, and they came out very nice.

They looked beautiful and I quite liked them, but my friend, who normally loves everything chocolaty, ate only one declaring that they tasted like these brown bars that taste a bit like chocolate and are supposed to be good for you. Actually he might be right but I still quite liked these. I reduced the amount of almond extract, added a bit of coffee liqueur to the glaze and glazed the cookies on the bottom side, as the tops looked so nice!

These are delicious!  I didn't have any baking chocolate, so I subbed 1 T butter + 3 T cocoa powder per square of chocolate, and it turned out fine.  The almond extract really makes the cookies!

We too had to make these for a school project. These were easier to make than I thought and they were good! I added a little more milk to the glaze because it wasn't creamy enough and I used pecans (only 3 oz vs a half cup) instead of walnuts.

These are good. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used the  mini chocolate chips, but I'm sure they would be just a good with the pecans. Otherwise, made exactly as written. These were easy and I am looking forward to adding them to my annual Christmas Cookie bake. Thinking about a white frosting instead with red/green sprinkles.

Very easy, great treat. I prepared this without changes and it turned out great. 
Making two dozen, I took a dozen to my friend down the street. When I got back, my old man had eaten most of the rest! 
Great recipe.

I cant believe i never rated these. I have been using this recipe for years. They´re really good and pretty foolproof. im usually too lazy to make the glaze and when i do, half of them have been eaten bij the time they´ve cooled down enough. They´re awesome either way.

I have been making these chocolate balls for about 6 years, and still make them every christmas. These always taste so good, even if you are not a big fan of dark chocolate. People I know look forward to when I make them, and they NEVER last long. Easy to make, and perfect for a different dessert than your regular cookies.

These were a hit.  The chocolate "dip" became streaky after a few days, but the taste was still great.
