Who knew making your own ricotta was so easy? Truth be told, I had never even thought about making my own until I saw this recipe. We don't use it very often and maybe that is due to how expensive it is to buy in the store. Why is it so expensive anyway when it is this easy and affordable to make? Going into this recipe I just knew it was going to be a big fail and I would get my answer as to why store bought was so expensive. Negative. I actually made this last night and the end result was so impressive that I couldn't stop thinking about it all day today at work. I wanted to tell everyone around me but they are not foodies and would have had no interest in listening. I did let it sit too long and it was a little too thick but that was my own fault.  This recipe is excellent! Once you try this you will never go back to store bought again.

I've made this (the Indians call it paneer) and it really is that easy. Just a note, your milks should NOT be ultra-pasteurized, as are most organic milk.  The best results come from raw milk, but you have to be in the know to get a hold of that.  you can also press this under a can and plate, and get a fantasic base for dips.

This worked out fantastically spot on,  the only thing I changed was I added a Cup of cream as I like a richer Ricotta like the one you get in Italy.  Thank you for the recipe. It will be my go to as it is an easy recipe and makes a decent portion.
