I believe there is a mistake in this recipe. Proportion of broth to rice. For two cups of rice, there should be FOUR cups of broth. Otherwise, too dry and uncooked. Almost every rice recipe requires two parts liquid/broth to one part rice. Otherwise, PRIMO. I actually went to the trouble to find all the 'exotic' ingredients. Portland OR has a great Thai-oriented grocery called Lily's Market. If you have an Asian community in your community, you should be able to find these ingredients. The panda leaves, shown as optional, are incredibly aromatic and like nothing else. When you smell them, you realize you've been exposed to them in every Thai restaurant you've ever been in.

This doesn't taste like the Khao Man Gai you'd buy from the restaurant.  And, the rice that comes out of this recipe isn't really oily.  The name "Khao Man Gai" translates to Rice from Chicken Fat.  Also, when cooking the rice if you're chopping the garlic, look at the video to see how they should be chopped.  They're chopped in big slivers vs. chopped pieces.  

When I cooked the rice, we used 3 cups of broth vs. 2 cups of broth and it came out good.  Not too wet or dry.

The food came out good, but I'd stick to buying this instead.

A variation of this has become a staple of my diet; easy, delicious, and cheap. I substitute legs or thighs if available, and then use the broth from cooking the chicken to cook the rice instead of this other process.  I also add fish sauce. The rice ratio here (1 water/broth:1 rice) is for fresh rice--that's my theory as to why Nong's is so good--for OK jasmine rice that isn't particularly fresh use a 1.5:1 or 2:1 ratio.

I've made this a couple of times and it's delicious. My daughter LOVES it. I serve it with homemade quick pickles, made with rice vinegar and fish sauce. I've had to substitute miso for the fermented beans because I haven't been able to find them. Also, I've added an extra cup of broth to the rice. I use the broth that the chicken was cooked in.

Chicken:
-needed almost a gallon of water
-increased the salt by 2 teaspoons
-stuffed the chicken with ginger and green onions
This made the chicken flavorful inside and out. 

For the rice, I used 1 tablespoon of chicken fat fried from the excess fat and skin trimmings instead of coconut oil. This made the rice bursting with flavor and aroma.

This is a fabulous recipe that has become a regular in our household. There is in fact an error in rice to water ratio. I use 2 cups rice to 3 cups broth that the chicken cooked in and it comes out perfect every time! I also season the cooking broth with extra salt and serve as an accompaniment to the chicken and rice. My family enjoys the broth as much as the chicken and rice. I freeze the extra and then heat up for snacks or when someone is feeling a bit under the weather. Ginger is great for upset tummies! Enjoy!

It turned out great!  My husband and I followed the recipe, but adjusted the chicken broth and rice ratio to 1.5:1, as some previous reviews have suggested.  We also used the same broth that the chicken was cooked in to cook the rice.
