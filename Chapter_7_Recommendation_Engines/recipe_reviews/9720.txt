As a Greek that is very familiar with the cuisine and these cookies, I can say it's the best recipe!  Bravo!

A very traditional Greek cookie.  They are pretty easy to make, just roll/shape carefully , as the prettier you shape it the better it will look when it's done.  (I need more practice!)  
My cookies only needed to bake for 10-15 minutes-  I didn't want the bottoms to be too dark.  Also- I had no sesame seeds, so I used white sanding sugar for a delicate touch.

I thought these were very good, not too sweet, and easy to make.  I might decrease the baking powder a touch the next time as the cookies might be a bit more dense (personal preference only), but even as written they certainly were very good.  Thank you, Nico, for taking the time to share this recipe.

Very yummy.  My son and I made these for part of his 2nd grade history fair project.  Although he did not end up winning a prize for his project, the judges voted unanimously for these cookies as their favorite food out of all the projects!  He is very proud of his ribbon! I followed the recipe exactly, just cut it in half in the interest of time.

These Greek cookies, also known as "koulourakias" are simply amazing.  I make them every year around Christmas and have since I was a child!  My 3 grown children love them and they are not too sweet...just perfect for dipping in coffee!  Thank you for publishing this wonderful cookie recipe!  (I omit the sesame seeds as I always preferred them plain, although many relatives have added anise, lemon or orange rind or the sesame seeds).

I am Greek and I have been searching for the perfect Easter Butter / Egg cookies.  These are very close!  
I had to increase the sugar slightly as we like our cookies a bit sweeter.
The ratio butter  flower is a bit off I had to add a bit more flower. Keep an extra 1/2 cup just in case.
No sesame seeds as the part of Greece I am from they do not include inside.
Next time I will use rind from one orange.  
Simplest and best recipe I have made so far.

The only problem i had was  to get them in the traditional shape and i add orange extract not vanilla it tastes a way more fresh ,vanilla  makes them to heavy since butter is the main ingredient than you very much ! I madesome  with sasame and some without .I added a pic and they look realllyy yummy !

What a great cookie for dunking into coffee or tea!  I am not much of a baker and found this recipe easy. Had a little hard time "braiding" but worked it out!

I needed to dial the baking powder waaaay back. They came out bitter the first time so I looked up other versions of this recipe and they called for around 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder, much less than the 3 tablespoons this recipe lists.

First, these are what we in the United States call "cookies," so the title follows the British definition of "biscuit."   Very easy to make and very tasty. I added about three tablespoons of"Nutella for additional flavor.

These are good, and although I was doubtful at first, I am glad I took the chance. They aren't very sweet, so if you prefer your biscuits to be sweet, I suggest increasing the amount of sugar. I didn't use sesame seeds because I didn't know if we had any, but they still turned out well. I dipped some in honey and my brother put sour cream on his and he also tried them with butter. We both liked them.
