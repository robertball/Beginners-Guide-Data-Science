I scaled the recipe to 4 servings because I was not canning it but using it for dinner. I added more seasonings and a tsp of sugar. I used a green bell pepper in place of the sweet red bell pepper.  We liked it.

This is the second year making this sauce. I only use this recipe because it is so good even without all of the sugar and salt that store bought sauces are made with. My whole family loves it and my friends are always asking for some of my jars.

Made recipe as noted, minus red bell pepper. I canned this and the recipe made 8  pints and 8 half-pints.
Tonight, I  served as dipping sauce with cheesy bread sticks. My husband said it was as good as Pizza Hut. My new go to recipe! Thank you!

Great recipe!!!  I made a few changes.  I used heirloom tomatoes (makes the whole house smell sooo good).  I added mushrooms, 1 TBS 1/2 TESP of Worcestershire,  a large handful of fresh oregano, roasted garlic, and used Red Wine Vendange Cabernet Sauvignon.  My family loved it!!!  I will be canning several jars!!!!

I varied the recipe, roasted the tomatoes and added much more celery and peppers, but overall the recipe is very easy and quick.
