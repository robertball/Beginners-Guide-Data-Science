I was surprised by the bad reviews. I just took the second one of these out of the oven, and wanted to see if anyone tried other fruits. This is truly delicious. Yes, the batter is thick. I used light sour cream instead of the yogurt, because I had it on hand. The secret is to barely mix the wet ingredients into the dry. Then use a spoon to spread the batter in the pan. I also drizzled the glaze on as soon as getting the cake out of the oven. This is yummy either hot, or room temp. Delicious and beautiful!

Perhaps the poor reviews came from those less experienced with this type of old-timey fruit dessert, like a slump, a pandowdy or a slumgullion; the dough is supposed to be "glumpy."  As for me, I used vanilla yogurt (I had it on hand) and thus the cake was extra vanilla-y! I did bake it several minutes longer, but I like my cakes a bit more browned. I used frozen raspberries, my stash from last summer's fence row harvest, and I'm delighted with the results.

I thought this was a fabulous coffee cake! The ingredients were perfectly balanced, and it's a wonderful treat for those that choose to eat healthier. Obviously the bad reviews came from those who don't follow directions very well, as it turned out beautifully for me.

This just may be the most spectacular recipe I've ever tried on this site (and I've tried many, many, many...).  I made it as written except I added almond extract to the glaze.  the dough (this is not batter) will absolutely be thick and sticky and not real easy to work with, but that is how it is supposed to be.  I baked mine in a small glass cake pan and it turned out fantastic! I'm going to make another one right now to take to work with me (I have to share this deliciousness with the world!!).  **Just made cake #2, this time with LEMON pudding and put lemon in the glaze.  Oh my...  Wish I had some poppyseeds...

This was just OK. Not very good.  I had to add some milk to the batter because it was WAY too thick. Bland in flavor, and the raspberries make it soggy at the bottom.

If your looking for a traditional coffee cake type recipe, this is probably not for you. I really loved this coffee cake because it wasn't overly sweet and "cakey" like some coffee cakes can be. I didn't have any raspberries on hand so I substituted with frozen peaches and strawberries and absolutely LOVED it. I also subbed Greek yogurt for regular. I panicked a little when it came time to "pour" the batter because my batter was far from "pourable". Instead I used a greased spoon to spread it in the pan. I was surprised by how moist and springy the cake was (if you're concerned about it being TOO soggy, try reducing the amount of sugar added to the berries as this produces quite a bit of liquid). I can't wait to try this again with different fruit combinations!

I made this coffee cake for breakfast except I used frozen blueberries (because that's what I had). And followed the rest of the recipe as stated. Everything turned out just fine and it was really good. Thanks Sarah

Very, I mean berry good coffee cake.  I used a combination of blackberries and raspberries and it turned out great.  And only 2 tablespoons of butter makes it even better!

Hello, This is an easy recipe with the basics you probably have at home.  I used fresh strawberries and blueberries instead of frozen and light sour cream instead of yogurt because it was on hand.  The batter is perfect and its just sweet enough. The cake is pleaseing to the eye and the stomach.  I would caution that if you are making for more thatn 4-6 that you double/triple the batter.  It comes out in a thiner layer than a traditional coffee cake.  I doubled mine and cut into little rectangles to serve.  You should try this recipe.  You won't be dissapointed.

Used a gluten free flour.  Was unsure how it would turn out because didn't have much batter to drop over berries.  Used frozen mixed berries.  Turned out beautiful.  The dough under the berries rose to top.  Was amazing!!!  The glaze on top was much needed as the cake is not very sweet.

Good. Key is to read entire recipe/instructions and reviews and improvise to best of your decision. Knowing what to expect lessen the disappointment. Since I used thawed frozen raspberries, it had a lot of liquid so I used only 2/3 cup and without the brown sugar. I baked in glass pan for 35 minutes. For those who said coffeecake came out thin?!? Yall probably didnt use EIGHT INCHES pan. I will make this again.

Amazing!  This came out so great!  I made a couple of small changes.  I used Greek Gods honey/strawberry yogurt (all I had) and I left out the almonds (didn't have any).  My pan was also a little large, so I wasn't able to layer in the raspberries.  I just put them on top and swirled them around a bit and it came out super great.  I haven't made the glaze yet (waiting until the morning to make it), so I don't know about that, but the coffee cake is excellent!

Very thin in height, but very good in taste, mainly due to the berries.

I used blueberries and vanilla yogurt and no glaze - coffee cake was sweet enough and yummy.  Yes, batter was thick, but manageable.  I have made other coffee cakes where batter was this thick and it makes no difference.  Will definitely make this again.

The recipe says, 'POUR the batter...' that is why so many of us were surprised.  If it had said, 'press the batter over the berries with a spatula' I would have been prepared. As it was, I barely had enough batter to cover the berries.  I was making two recipes up to that point, but then decided to use both batches of batter in order to completely cover the raspberries.  I love a delicious coffee cake--but directions need to be written for the inexperienced

To all that attempt to make this...the batter is going to be thick.  This is how the recipe is but do not fear.  My daughter and I just made this and it is absolutely delicious!  I love it and as easy as it is to make it is a keeper in my family's dessert menu.

Got great reviews with this recipe, altho I wasn't too thrilled. Changed it a bit so that maybe why. Used 1 cup of frozen blueberries and vanilla yogurt. Am going to try strawberries next.

Overall, this had a really good texture and flavor. However, it didn't seem like there was much batter. I spread it all in the bottom of the pan, then topped with the raspberry mixture. I also added cinnamon to the batter. Good even without the glaze, straight from the oven!

So easy and delicious! And it smells so good -- how nice to wake up to its fragrance. 

This recipe is so versatile. Today I followed it exactly, including fresh raspberries. Previously I have used different types of yogurt -- raspberry flavored, or vanilla flavored -- but always Greek.  If using flavored yogurt, I cut the brown sugar amount in 1/2.

I used some fresh fruit from the fridge that was getting soft since it was going to be cooked anyway.  We're not big on nuts in baking so I didn't add them but if I make this again I will make something of a crumble topping to put in the bottom of the pan so that the fruit isn't right on top of the cake.  We enjoyed the cake but found it a bit bland.  Might make again.

Flavour wise it was lovely, but it came out quite flat— and I did bake it in an 8-incher!  I feel like it would have been more visually pleasing if I either doubled the recipe and still did it in this dish, or if I used a jelly roll pan or something.

I used blueberries. One change was unintentional, I absent-minded added the berries after tossing to the batter. So the cake got a little stuck to the pan, my bad. I used pureed fresh strawberries in the glaze along with the instructions given in the recipe. Like the colours! Will make again for sure.

This made a lovely little coffee cake that was a wonderful use of raspberries from the garden.  The batter is thick so the use of an  offset spatula is ideal for spreading.

This was super easy and yummy!  I used spelt flour, to make it a little healthier.  I didn't have plain yogurt or almonds, so used sour cream and unsweetened shredded coconut instead.  I just dumped the raspberries and coconut on top (rather than layer, and cooked for 30 minutes in an 8 inch square pan.  I would make this again!

I added a little milk to the batter so it could spread easier.

I tried this recipe and found the batter was way too thick, and there wasn't much batter.  The batter did not spread well, either... just way too thick.  I'm not an advaced baker... so I didn't know how to remedy the problem.  I noted some of the reviewers said they added milk to the batter to thin it out.  Won't be trying this one again.
