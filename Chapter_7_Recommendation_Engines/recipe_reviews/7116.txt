Indescribably delicious! I usually make banana bread by hand, so I was a touch skeptical about using the bread machine, but it came out dense and golden and smelled wonderful while baking. I began with the recipe Dee provided, then I added an extra banana, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, a splash of vanilla, and in lieu of nuts, a heaping tbsp. of poppy seeds. I also added 4 oz. of plain applesauce (one of those individual cups). I used a Breadman Rapid Deluxe machine, which does not allow you to stop and then bake. Instead, I used the 1 pound setting and the "fruit/nut bread" option. It takes about 3 hours and 15 minutes to produce the loaf, but it mixes and stops and mixes and stops: the actual baking part is about an hour long. The banana bread had a more cakelike than breadlike texture (due to the addition of the applesauce) and was very dense, but oh so good! I love the ease and convenience of this recipe and I will use it often. A word of caution: use a rubber spatula to scrape the corners during the mixing phase to integrate all of the flour (be careful of the machine's mixing paddle), or some of the dry ingredients may get stuck in the corners of the pan. Enjoy!

Hi There:

The problem I had with this receipe is that I have a Black & Decker bread machine.  There is no stop button and you can not set the cook time you would like. Once you have picked the bread/ pasta or dough that you want to make that's it the machine does the rest.

This receipe is probably really good but for people that have a Black & Decker machine I don't recommend it.

This is just like the one my mom would make! Putting the big pieces of banana in didn't work well for me, so instead I put them in a ziplock bag, removed as much air as I could and squished them with my fingers then dumped the bananas in the bread machine pan and it works great!

I don't have a bake only setting on my machine so I just left it go in the quick bread setting.  It took a bit longer but was DELICIOUS. Will definately use it again especially when it is my turn to supply lunch at the card party.

I tried this yesterday and it turned out great! The next time I make I will add vanilla and walnuts, it was a little bland..I think I needed another banana (mine were pretty small) and I did like another reviewer and put them in a plastic bag first and squished it up first, this worked well..this recipe only took about 5 minutes to throw together and was by far the easiest way to make banana bread! Thanks Dee!

This is the easiest recipe for banana bread I have found. I especially like the fact that you don't have to mash up the bananas and then measure them. It is awesome!!! I also added some chopped walnuts to my bread, It was great! Thank You Dee.

Super Duper easy recipe!  I use it now to make my pumpkin bread too.  I just substitute the pumpkin for bananas and add nuts, spices and raisins.  What a time saver from making it the old fashioned way. :-)

This bread is moist and delicious.  I used the "quick bread" setting on my machine, so it took 2 hours, but it was so easy!

I used this recipe in the oven and not the bread machine and it turned out great. I mixed the bananas, egg, oil together, then added the sugar and baking soda/powder (mix very well to get slightly fluffy). (I usually use more than the suggested # of bananas, by at least 1/2 extra banana) Then added all that to a larger bowl with the flour and some cinnamon. Baked for 40ish minutes at 350-375 (depending on your oven). Took it out when the toothpick came out clean. I also added blueberries to the mix. Very tasty. Light and Fluffy.

I live in Texas and Bananna Bread used to be a thing I only made in the fall and winter because I didn't want to heat up the house.  Not anymore, this is the only way I plan on EVER making it again. Quick, easy, fast clean up and delicious on top of it all.  Who could ask for more.  I do add nuts to mine at the very end of the mix cycle.

DELICIOUS! This is the PERFECT starter recipe. I am quite health conscious, so I kept adding/modifying things to make it healthier. After several times, I finally ended up with a different (and more complicated) bread: 2 c whole wheat flour, 1/3 c honey (ripe bananas and applesauce give sweetness), 1 c applesauce, 1/4 c nuts, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3 Tbs ground flaxseed, same baking powder, baking soda, eggs, and bananas (applesauce was in place of veg oil). Great recipe from the beginning!

Ok, so I NEVER take time to write reviews, but I simply had too on this one! It was amazing! I am really picky with my banana bread too, but this one is the ultimate! I too used more banana than called for and quickly mashed them in a bowl before adding them to machine, added some vanilla and cinnamon and 1 serving cup of applesauce. I put it all in my Oster bread machine, mixed it on the dough setting for about 6 minutes until well blended (with my help) and cooked it for just over an hour. It came out absolutely devine! I never eat the ends of the bread, but I simply could not put this one down! YUM YUM YUM! Thank you SO much!

This was great.  I added nuts, vanilla, and cinnamon like other raters suggested and used 3 bananas.  I smashed the bananas and eggs in a bowl before added them.  I wasn't sure this would work with my machine - it's pretty old, but I put it on a 3-hour bake cycle, and it was just fine.  I kept peeking in; it looked raw until into the last hour.  I was worried it would be a bust, but it turned out perfect.  I dreaded pulling out the bowl and beaters and all the mess, and because of this easy bread machine recipe, I didn't have to.  I'll be making banana bread more often now.  Thank you.  Easy!

The bread turned out great and it was very moistbut I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer in my machine.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon for more flavor.

This recipe was okay, but the bread turned out kind of dry in my machine. I followed the directions exactly as they were written.

Good recipe that worked well with my 2lb Black & Decker All-in-one Horizontal Breadmaker using the Batter Bread™ setting.  I had 3 bananas and adjusted accordingly. It was liked by all and was VERY, VERY easy to make. Will make again. May add nuts, dried fruit, Chocolate chips ect. for variety.

This worked great with the Cake setting in my Zojirushi mini.  I didn't even need to mash the bananas.  I should have added the liquid ingredients first though because there was some flour stuck to the bottom of the bread.

this recipe is delicious. I did change one thing, because i didnt have white sugar i used light brown sugar and it turned out perfect. I did add a small hand full of nuts as well. I was unsure about adding the banana in big chunks, but they did mash in completely. I will definately make this recipe again. Big hit with my hubby and 4yr old  =)
EDIT: I now make this bread once a week. My 1 yr old daughter totally devours this bread! I changed the recipe a little over the years. I add 1/4tsp pumpkin pie spice, 3 bananas 3 eggs and cook 30 minutes longer. Comes out super moist every time!

We tried this recipe last night.  We had the same problems mentioned before.  The inside did not cook all the way through.  We added an extra banana for flavor and it was still missing something.  This is a very plain basic recipe, I was looking for something with a little more flavor and spice.

5 Stars because it was darn easy and decent for a bread machine.  It's not the same as from the oven, but nice to dump everything in the bread pan "set it & forget it".  I have a Zojirushi Machine with a "Cake" setting.  I dumped the ingredients in, did ADD vanilla, pressed Cake, scraped the pan once with a spatula at about 4 minutes of mixing...then walked away.  
The banana bread looks & smells great...trying not to eat it all right now!

This is my go-to recipe for banana bread.  It's so easy and requires so few ingredients, I love it!  My lowest time setting is 1 hour 30 minutes, so I just let the bread go for that long and it comes out fine.  I also chunk the bananas instead of leaving them in large pieces.  Last time I made it, I added a third banana and a couple of handfuls of nuts and it was so, so yummy (I didn't change any of the other ingredients).  We enjoy this bread -- thanks for posting the recipe!

We love this bread! I have been making it for years but just now got around to rating the recipe. I am constantly asked by my kids to make it for their lunches.  We are in a 'nut-free' school and, as this recipe contains no nuts, I can send this bread with them and know they are getting a healthy snack.  The only substitution I make is that instead of using oil, I use the same amount of applesauce.  I usually freeze my bananas when they get to that brown colour where no one will eat them (just throw them into the freezer, peel and all).  Those frozen bananas are the ones I use for this bread.  When thawed and peeled, they mix into the bread perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I don't even mix it up first. My machine has a cake setting, and mixes for about 8-10 minutes before baking.  I put oil, eggs and mashed bananas in first, then add the dry ingredients.  Turns out well every time.
Also great with added walnuts.
Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good and super easy.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and I would have added walnuts, but I didn't have any.  It was very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Good base recipe.

Following other suggestions, we added vanilla, cinnamon & nutmeg, and 1/3 cup sour cream we had left. We used room temp butter instead of oil - Not sure if that made a difference. I used the recommended amount of sugar - I wouldn't use more. We measured 1 cup of bananas, then my husband tossed in another half banana. We dumped everything into the bread machine & let it run on the Quickbread setting. The bread turned out very nice, although a little sweet. We'll use this recipe again. Next time I'll add nuts or raisins. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe which produced a good moist loaf with plenty of flavour in my Sunbeam 5891. Cut thin slices and spread Cool Whip thickly for a nice simple dessert.

The only issues: (1) Mash up the bananas first if they're not very ripe, and/or if you don't want the occasional lump (the Sunbeam doesn't mash efficiently enough). (2) It may take 30 minutes longer than stated to cook thoroughly in a Sunbeam 5891 (mine didn't burn but did come out quite dark; however, it tasted great - my wife's opinion as well! :)).

I made this bread for a recent ski trip and my nephew stated that it was the best banana bread that he ever had!  I used three bananas instead of two.  I wanted to use them up.  It was yummy!

Sorry, but this ended up in the garbage disposal.  It was brown on the outside and nothing but a goopy mess on the inside.  I was really hoping it was going to turn out great, but it just didn't turn out.

I couldn't make it work in my bread machine so I baked it in the oven at 350. I like my banana bread spicey so I added cinnamon, cloves, ginger and vanilla. It was pretty good.

Great base recipe. I added another banana, a splash of vanilla and a couple shakes of cinnamon. Mixed together in a bowl then poured into my Sunbeam bread maker. Sprinkled 1/2 cup walnuts on top of the mix and set on the Quick Bread cycle. May try adding chocolate chips next time. Yum!!

Ease of preparation bump this recipe up a notch.  I've made Banana Bread countless times the old-fashioned way; this was my first experience with a quick bread in the bread machine.  I placed all ingredients into the bread machine pan, added cinnamon and vanilla and let the machine do its thing!  After a few minutes of mixing I scaped down the sides of the pan with a rubber spatula.  Overall, it's a bit denser, darker, and drier than 'regular' banana bread, but tastes very good.  My house smells absoulutely divine right now - and with minimal effort on my part.  Adding milk/sour cream and/or additional banana would probably solve the dryness issue with the bread.  Will defo make again when my leftover bananas become overripe!

Wow this recipe is great. It passed the ultimate test, my wife liked it. She has an old family recipe that we've used for years,and she says this is just as good. Will make it again and again. My machine did a great job, so much easier than doing it the old way. The only thing I changed was to mash the bananas up a bit, mix with the beaten eggs and oil,and put in the pan before adding the dry ingredients.

Awesome!! I used the dough setting on my Sunbeam 5833 machine. I did scrape down the sides, and even stired in a bit myself here and there. My "Bake" setting bakes for 1hr.  I had to reset the bake cycle and  bake for an addition 20 mins.  Very moist. I used 3 ripe bananas ans added 1/2 an individual unsweetened apple sauce cup. I'll be making this again!!! Thanks for the recipe.

It came out really well, but not a good recipe choice if your breadmaker doesn't have a "stop" button for the dough-mixing cycle.

I used applesauce instead of butter & 1/2 wheat--1/2 white flour & I let my bread machine do all the work.  My family loved it & couldn't tell the difference.  I didn't have any walnuts or pecans & for me that was the only thing that would have made this bread better....& maybe a crumb topping but that would have defeated the purpose of the substitutions lol. Thanks for sharing.

I unfortunately found this recipe a little too dry for my tastes.  I even added an extra banana as I thought two didn't seem like enough.  The flavor was pretty good, but just hard to get past being dry.

I wound up taking it out of the bread machine and scooping it into a muffin pan and baked them in the oven. The taste was just ok.  I had techinical difficulties in trying to match the machine settings mentioned with my bread machine.

delicious easy banana bread, I did it both ways using both the dough and bake cycle and using the quick bread setting, It came out much better using the bake setting, I found using the quick bread setting, didn't cook it all the way through, and it came out very heavy and very doughy.  I usually add more bananas and walnuts. Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Seems like too much sugar, so I only used 1/4 cup and used about 1/3 cup more whole wheat flour.  I also substituted the vegetable oil with coconut oil.  The baking time was right on for my bread machine (Oster Expressbake, using the quick setting and removing the loaf with 30 minutes left). The loaf came out great, although I would consider adding another banana and maybe some spice.

Not sure if I did something wrong, or if maybe my machine is just different, but my loaf came out VERY tough and thick on the crust. I followed the directions exactly. My machine also does not have a "bake only" setting, so I just ran the "quick bread" cycle like a few people had said to do instead.

First time using my sunbeam bread machine and I used this recipe to break it in. I added some cinnamon and cajeta caramel and it tastes great. My only problem was that there was a bunch of flour on the bottom of the loaf.

I have an older model Regal bread machine and this was a fantastic recipe. I added 3-4 mashed bananas (very ripe), just a sprinkle of cinnamon, and a little vanilla (in one batch)-- all of them turned out great. On my Regal bread machine, it needed 1 hour to bake, not 50 mins. Thanks for sharing!

I found this bread to be absolutely the best banana bread that I have ever eaten.  My children love it for a dessert.   You have to be sure to follow the directions closely and check for doneness.  For me it was quick, easy and economical.  I would recommend this recipe for anyone with a bread machine with a dough and bake cycle.

What a disaster!  I wouldn't have tried this recipe, except for all the reviews of it working on a "quick-bake" cycle.  I would not recommend trying this recipe unless you can follow it exactly as the bread cycle is explained and have the option of extending the cycle if needed.  I tried the "quick-bake" & have to now try to finish it in the oven.  By the way, the batter literally poured out of the middle of the bread when I had to transfer baking pans!

mine came out great. i did add a extra bannana 1/2 tsp or so of cinnamon, and a little sprinkly of lemon peel. my 14 month old son loves it. i also used the flour for the bread machine. it was nice and thick and very taste. I did Not do the 4oz of apple sauce i am making it again just the same way i did it last time for my 14 month old and I. he has a corn intolerance and i was able to make this easy for him. i baked it the first time after i used my oven for remander cooking due to it not cooking long enough in the breadman machine.so this time i am trying a different setting (fruit and nut setting) will let you know how the bread machine does on this setting later. thanks

This tasted good - but a warning!  I doubled the recipe to make it for a 2lb loaf, the entire loaf didn't cook all the way through.  So I had to stick it in the oven.  Just keep it a 1lb loaf, and you should be fine!

This is delicious!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Since my bread machine doesn't have a bake only setting, I baked in muffin tins for 20 minutes at 325.  Very moist!  This will be a regular in my kitchen!

I added some cinnamon and pumpkin spice and I am at a higher altitude so I added a little more flour. Worked out perfect, everyone loved it. Also, I use zuchini one time since I had no bananas.

Good flavor, somewhat dry.  My mother's recipe is much very moist, so I have been spoiled.  Not bad for bread machine banana bread.  I added walnuts at the end of mixing, which worked well.

This is a great banana bread but using the dough setting is not necessary at all. All bread machine banana bread recipes have to be premixed in a bowl before going into the machine. I have a Black and Decker bread maker and i mix all of my ingredients in a bowl first. I mash the bananas first, add all other wet ingredients and then the dry. I pop the mixture into the machine and puch number 7 on my machine which is the quick bread setting. The setting cooks the bread for 1 hour 40 minutes and it turns out wonderful. Give it a try. Yummy. It don't last 10 minutes in my house.

The bread is moist and has a nice flavour without being overpowering. I'm not even a fan of banana bread and I enjoyed munching on a slice. This is an overall nice recipe but it loses a star because the directions do not take into consideration how bread machines vary (power, timing, etc.) Our machine was not able to handle mixing all the ingredients together and the cook time was well over 1.5 hours. The next time, we will have to mix the ingredients in a bowl beforehand and really watch the timer. We will definitely be making it again, though.

This was so easy. I used 2 1/2 bananas, chopped. I used the ' quick bread ' setting on my machine but I pulled the plug when it still had about 15 min left. The bread was perfect but if I hadn't stopped the cooking early - I think it might have been well overcooked. There were no chunks of banana in the bread, so next time I won't chop the banana so much. Cinnamon was a good addition but I'll add vanilla next time too.

This is an amazing recipe, I do not have the bake setting on my bread machine, I just use the setting for sweet breads.  I also need to mash the bananas before hand and i added 1 extra banana which keeps the recipe moist.  Love how easy it is!  My 2 teenage sons love it and they are my biggest critics... thanks....

Oh my goodness!  This is SO yummy and so easy to make!  I just got a breakmaker and had only used it one other time when I found this recipe.  I love banana bread and thought why not try it in the bread maker.  I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and a slash of vanilla for a little extra something.  So good!  I cooked it on the sweet bread setting, but it wasn't quite done at the end.  My machine says it cannot be restarted till the machine is cooled all the way.  But I figured out how to reset it (hold down the start/stop button till it beeps) and put it on the bake cycle for an extra 10 mins, and it was perfect. I thought it might have been too long, as it looked a little dried out, but I was wrong, moist and tasty!

I loved how easy this recipe was!  Unfortunately I can't say the same for the taste.  I grew up with incredibly moist and flavorful banana bread and I can't seem to find a match in a bread machine recipe.  I used 3 bananas and I think that helped.  I would probably make it again because of how easy it was.  Also, I used the 58 minute quick cycle on my sunbeam and still had to put in the oven to finish baking.

I used the BatterBread cycle on my Breadman and it turned out PERFECT! My modifications:
- used 3 bananas instead of 2
- added 1/2 c. plain non-fat yogurt to moisten since I didn't feel like buying applesauce *just* for this recipe. Vanilla yogurt would work too.
- substituted 1 c. of the white flour for 1 c. whole wheat
- added 1/4 c. raisins
- added 1 T. wheat berries (didn't have any nuts on hand)
Next time I'll try adding nuts and some cinnamon. Great breakfast/snack to keep you going! If you really need some fuel, spread a slice with peanut butter or cream cheese and top with jam - YUM!

I made this last night and have brought the results into work today.  A big, big success.  It has gone down a storm.  Incredibly easy to make and as at the end of most weeks I have leftover bananas ready to spoil, I imagine this will be a frequent recipe of mine.

Only changes I made were to use one cup of wholegrain flour in place of one white cup and added a couple of handfuls of mixed nuts (walnuts, hazels, brazils) purely for added health benefits.  I'm in training for a marathon at the moment so a slice of this loaf is ideal fuel.  Thanks!!!

it was a simple recipe...It's a very dense bread.  I put in one extra banana, some nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla.  I should have used more cinnamon, but oh well.  This bread would be good with some cinnamon butter or even apple butter!

I thought this recipe was terrific!  I took the advice of the others I saw and added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  When I ran out of walnuts I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, delicious!  It's also good with 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup chocolate chips...the best of both worlds.  My hubby's hooked on this bread, as am I!

I have made this bread several times when I have extra "brown" bananas around.  It has OK flavor, I add vanilla to my recipe and usually add more bananas too.  Easy to put together and hard to mess up.

I'm a baking newbie and this is the first recipe I tried in my first bread machine that was given to us with no instructions. It came out so well that my wife is constantly requesting it over and over again. I also followed the suggestions and added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon. Its really good for a quick breakfast bread while rushing out of the house.

Because I don't have a BAKE only cycle, I used the BATTER cycle and stopped the baking cycle 20 minutes sooner. It was very good, a little dry, so the next time I make it I will stop baking it 25 minutes earlier and see what happens. The taste, however, was very good.

Baked up perfect and the taste is wonderful. Such a great way to make banana bread year round. Thanks so much!

It was good but would've liked it a bit more moist.  Only thing I added was vanilla.  Next time will increase the oil and add another banana.   I really needed to use my spatula during the mixing cycle or it wouldn't have been mixed well by my machine, an Oster Expressbake 2lb. Bread Maker.  My bake cycle is a full hour.  I checked it at 50 minutes but it was still raw in the center.  Let it complete the hour and it was fully cooked.  The sides were beginning to burn but I sliced those off before serving.  I will make this again because it was so easy, clean up was a breeze,  and I didn't heat up my whole kitchen.

I don't have a "bake setting" nor can I set the length of time. Fortunately I have a "cake" setting and the bread was PERFECT! It was moist and delicious. A nice alternative to the traditional method (Less dishes and the kitchen didn't get heated up.). I recommend this recipe.

Best banana bread I've ever had. (-:
I don't like the way my bread machine bakes, so I baked it in my oven. But I did let it go through the dough cycle. I put the ingrediants into my machine in the exact order listed then put a cup of chopped pecans in. After the dough cycle I baked it at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.(in my oven) Will make again!!   (:(:(:

Best banana bread I ever made. Used two frozen and thawed bananas for this. Dumped it all in the pan, set to dough for 5min and baked for 50 min. My first banana bread that didn't come out doughy in the middle. Everyone loved it...

The first time I made it exactly as described and it was ok, but nothing amazing.  The second time I used half whole wheat flour and half white and it tasted like cardboard.  I think it has to do with the fact that my machine doesn't let you turn the mixing cycle off after 5 min.  It mixes for about 10-12 minutes and then bakes.  I put mine on dark instead of medium too and so it overcooked.  Seems like it's not right for my machine, but I am not an experienced baker so I may be doing something else wrong too.

Simple enough to whip up in no time. I followed the ingredients to a "T" except for doubling the recipe. I used the dough cycle for 10 minutes, then reset my bread maker to "Extra Bake Time" setting for 90 minutes. Bread rose very nicely. I've had other banana breads with a more potent banana flavor, however this one was still good enough to try again. Next time I will add raisins, nuts, or maybe both.

I made this in my Hamilton Beach HomeBaker on the Quick Bread setting and it turned out really well!  Although I picked light crust, the crust was a bit thicker and darker than I would have liked, but the inside cooked perfectly.  As others have mentioned, it is a little bland, so next time I'll be mixing in chocolate chips or nuts, or maybe just adding some spices for variety.

I wasn't happy with this banana bread. I thought the consistency was off and it tasted dry. I did substitute apple sauce for the oil, so that might have affected it.

it came out very dry.  I tried several variations, and finally found this to make it moist: substitute 4tablespoons butter for oil add 1/3 cup sour cream. add 2 capfuls vanilla. also, I added walnuts because I like them in my bread. With the sour cream, it came out wonderfully moist.  I am baking another now, this time using 1/2 can pumpkin meat instead of bananas, and with nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves.

Sorry to say that this was the first thing in 13 years of bread machine recipes that didn't work.  Perhaps if the instructions were more compatible to most machines.  I tried to adapt as best I could with my Black and Decker.  It didn't mix nicely, didn't bake through completely.  I wish it would have worked, but I'll stick to the handmade banana bread that my family loves.

I could not figure out how to "bake" the bread in my bread machine (lost the manual). So I took the pan insert out of the bread machine and put it on a cookie sheet and baked it in the oven, and it still turned out great :) I also added cinnamon etc.. per other reviews. Thanks

This recipe was FANTASTIC. I baked it in the oven at 300 degrees for around 35 minutes and used 3 bananas instead of two. It's so moist, the crust is just right (not crunchy, not falling apart.) Thumbs up from everyone at our house.

I have used this recipie I dont know how many times, and as soon as the bread is done all my family and neighbors eat it before it can even cool, it is just perfect when you have some old bananas laying around!  Matter of fact I'm making it again today for my mom!    One little thing I do diffrent, I let the bread mix through the whole mix cycle, not just for 3 to 5 minutes, it still comes out great! :)

Very moist and hit at my house. I have the breadman ultimate with a batter bread cycle. Turned out great. I used regular flour, splenda, added one cup of cinamon applesauce and some walnuts. great!!

My 17 month old son loves this bread. I added an extra 1/2 a banana & a splash of vanilla as per other reviewers. I don't particularly like banana bread, so I haven't tried it. However, my mom says its pretty good. I'm hoping my husband (who I actually made it for) likes it as much as our son! I used my machine's Raisin bread setting since mine doesn't allow timing changes. Oh, and I freaked out a bit b/c I could smell what I thought was burning, so I pulled the plug on my bread machine. However, there was still a patch of dough - so I popped it into a pan & cooked it the remaining 20 minutes. Turned out moist & soft!

I tried this recipe today for the first time. I loved it! The only thing I did different was I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. I also smashed my bananas in a bowl first before I added them to the bread machine. It needed to cook for about an hour and 10 minutes in my oster bread maker. It was not dry at all and was just delicious. Next time I will probably try some vanilla and cinnamon for extra flavor.

Great recipe! I also added a splash of vanilla and sliced the banana into small pieces. This is better if you don't want chunks of banana in your bread.  I have an Oster bread maker and I just put it on the Cakes/Quick Breads setting.

It must be my bread machine. It stopped 1hr in. Still doughy on bottom, banana too big to mix. Had to put in oven. Tasted bland. Outside burnt inside doughy.

What a perfect recipe.  I have tried this several times and it always turns out great.  I now make this as healthy as I can.  Instead of eggs I use flax eggs(2tbs flax and 6tbs water mixed) ,instead of oil I use 3tbs cinnamon apple sauce and instead of all purpose flour I use whole wheat.  It turns out great!!!  My kids and husband love it.  Now all I have to do is find something to replace the sugar??? Maybe stevia or something :)  I will keep you posted.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I have some bread cooking right now for breakfast...YUM!

A better version...  Use the same ingredients plus:  1/4 c water 3/4 c chopped walnuts  Add the water to the rest of the ingredients.  I use my bread machine's cake setting for cooking. It mixes for 24 minutes (with the walnuts being added 11 minutes in), cooks for 80 minutes, and cools for 16 minutes.  The water adds a bit of moisture to the bread and, at least for me, the walnuts are a requirement.

My bread machine does not have the features the poster does.  I followed the suggestions of others to just let it run a normal bread cycle at light.  The middle was not done and came out as a gooey mess.  The bake portion had a good taste.  This would be a good recipe if you have the bread machine as the poster.

This bread was not done when the bread machine was done.  I had to get it out and put it in another pan to bake it :(  I tried it a second time on regular bake setting, same thing, not done.  When it is done, it has a great taste.  I would recommend this recipe for the oven.

Wow this was yummy and easy.  I threw it all in the machine when we started dinner and it was ready for dessert. I used 2 frozen bananas (thawed)chopped in 1 inch pieces.  Next time I will use 3 bananas and cinnamon for more flavor, but it was good as is...maybe pecans too?

This is very easy, and since my bread machine does not have a quick setting, I appreciated the dough/bake instructions.  I did add one more banana because mine were smaller and I did mash them as other reviewers had suggested.  I added 1 1/2 tsps. vanilla.  The only thing I notice was I needed to bake it for an entire hour on my light setting vs. 50 minutes.

I'm baking this bread right now and it smells delish! I can't wait to take a bite. I have a SunBeam Breadmachine and was able to follow the directions just fine. I also made a few changes. Another reviewer suggested vanilla, cinnamon, and raisins. I went ahead and added it. OMG...I wish I could speed up time and take a bite! It smells wicked good!

First, I confess I tweaked this recipe before trying it as written. I used half white/half ww flour, brown sugar(1/2c), butter(3T), and added about 2T lemon juice. The bread is moist and smells wonderful but ended up short on flavor. Would add nuts and more banana and perhaps some lemon zest. BUT, I LOVED that it worked so well in my bread machine! (Cuisnart Convection on QuickBread setting). WILL try again!

Works beautifully with my Sunbeam breadmaker, just bake it on Bake one after you use the dough cycle. My bread turned out moist and so tasty. I added dates which i needed to use up, but a hint: if you have an oblong setting pan, mush up the bananas well and let the dough cycle go about 4 minutes more than recommended here to completely mix igredients. I also added some honey with the dates and some nuts. Yummy!

This was pretty good. Use the advice of others and add stuff, I added walnuts and a couple of tsp of vanilla. It tasted good good flavor but mine came out dry so next time I think I'll try more banana and maybe some milk or extra oil but it was still really good!

On its own, this recipe is quite bland.  In order to jazz things up a bit I added cardamom, cinnamon and sunflower seeds.

To be honest I thought this was just mediocre.  I added an extra bannana and a bunch of spices and ended up baking it in my oven.  All said and done I expect a good quck bread to be eaten without any butter and be great...this needed butter and then was just ok...I won't be keeping this.

I liked this recipe but felt it was a bit on the dry side and needed pecans or walnuts to lift the flavor. If you ad a half cup of fresh sliced strawberries or fresh blueberries and a pinch of nutmeg with the bananas you have a more flavorful bread.  Drizzle with homemade creamy caramel sauce and now it's Gourmet.

My dad and I always make bread together but I decided once to make this on my own while he was at work..hehe..I really love bananas so I decided to use this recipe..I really didnt know what to expect but I absolutly loved it.  It was very moist and full of flavor after adding vanilla and cinnomin to it like everyone else said to do. I also added about 1 tablespoon of unsweetened applesauce and a little less vegtable oil:)It was the BOMB!!

This recipe is the one I use most often in my bread maker. Suggestions: use two large bananas or three small ones. The ideas for adding vanilla and cinnamon are good additions. This is a “staple” for my household and for potluck dinners, etc. Watch the bake times- all machines are different.

This was ok. I couldn't figure out how to make it in my bread machine though which is a Panasonic. When I put it on the dough setting it had to rest first and then it took 4 hours to prepare the dough and bake. There was no way to stop it or set the time to what I needed it to be. Almost 4 hours later it started to smell very done so I stopped it and opened the lid. It was still a huge dough ball and had only 30 minutes left. It was a pain because I made it late at night after getting home from work.
I ended up just doing the baking only cycle the next morning. It looked nice when it came out, but it was very doughy and undone in certain areas. I was a little disappointed and ended up not taking it to my ladies day function at church.
My husband liked it though so I'm giving it 3 stars. It was just too much waiting time for me so I'll stick with my traditional recipe to be done in the oven.

This recipe didn't work at all for me. The bread was dry and bland.  Maybe because my bread machine only makes 1 1/2 or 2 pounds.

I'm only giving this two stars because it was very simple. I will be sticking with my recipe from now on. I really don't like to give bad reviews but this was entirely too dry even using 3 bananas. It was not nearly as sweet as I would have preferred.

A bit dry and bland but the house smelled wonderful! I will modify next time with the suggestions from others like adding applesauce, three bananas instead of two and more spices! But thank you for the tip  about using a bread machine! I just unplugged my machine in between stirring and cooking and it worked great.How easy and I did stir with a spatula  a couple of times  to catch the drier ingredients at the bottom. I may try adding chocolate chips, coconut, persimmon  or pumpkin for variety,too! A very good starter recipe and a great way to use up frozen bananas!

I really liked this recipe for the ease, but even though I used 3 bananas as several reviewers suggested, I still felt the banana flavor was weak.  I think next time, I'll add about 1/2 tsp of salt.  It's been a long time since I've seen a cake or quick-bread recipe without salt in it, anyway.

I too have a Black and Decker machine which is fully automated from start to finish. Is doesn't allow you to adjust mixing time or cooking time. But the point of using the breadmaker is to avoid doing it the conventional way right? 
So here's what I did to circumvent those restrictions. 
I added the ingredients as per recipe,  adding only a touch of vanilla onto chopped bananas. 
I set machine to dough setting, allowed it to preheat, and mix for a few min. Then unplug machine to reset, leave unplugged for couple min, then plug back in and set to quick bread setting.
It will do the preheat and mix again, but it didnt seem to affect the bread at all! 
Total mix/cook time is 110 min. Allow it to cook for the complete time.
Not only was it not over mixed like I thought it might be, it was moist, dense and delicious! ! :-)

This recipe is so easy and quick. My 3 year old prepared it in the bowl all by herself and I threw it into the machine. We did make some adjustments though. We added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, 1/2 cup of walnuts and used 4 small ripe bananas. I have the Oster expressbake machine which also has a start/stop function. I put it on bake and it baked evenly throughout in the hour time. It was very good. Moist and light. However, because of the adjustments I rated 4 star, I think it may have been bland and dry without.

I don't have dough & bake as single programs on my breadmaker & my one attempt at a cake had been a disaster. I read in earlier comments of this recipe of similar problems with machines so I tried  a "fastbake" setting. The bread was delicious.  I added a handful of sultanas as the only change to the recipe. Thank you.

I had to create an account just so I could review this recipe! Mine came out perfect!!

I received an Oster expressbake machine as a christmas gift and wanted to try something simple. I followed the recipe but I used 1 cup almond flour and 1 cup 'Better for Bread Flour' from Gold Medal. Other than that I added a little vanilla and a handful of sliced almonds and less sugar, 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and 1/8 cup of white sugar I didn't want it to be super sweet but just a hint of sweetness to compliment the banana. I mixed all the ingredients myself and used the machine to bake. I used the medium crust setting, although I like the crispier crunch crust I will go the light setting next time. The kitchen smelled AMAZING! my mom wanted to sneak an earlier taste, I had to fight her off, LOL.

I was totally expecting a dense somewhat gooey kind of bread but it was not. It had the perfect amount of fluff. I was not dense at all!! 

This is definitely a keeper that I will be making often!!

I use this recipe all the time, have it printed and saved in case it ever disappears from my bookmark!!! I use 1/4 cup sugar when I make it for my diabetic dad, and he loves it that way. I always add in 1/4 cup of pecan pieces, too. I find that my machine is getting older and it has to bake at least 75 minutes now. My most recent addition was both pecans and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips... ohhhh the reviews that got!!

I followed the recipe except I added a two extra bananas and TBS of vanilla and it was still bland.  I think  a bit of salt and maybe some cinnamon would have helped.  The bread was moist enough just not very flavorful.  I may or may not make it again.

I use an Oster bread machine, and this recipe has seen its way to the pan on multiple occasions. The stand alone recipe is quite delicious by itself, but (by recommendation of other users) adding about half a teaspoon of cinnamon and about a teaspoon of vanilla really kicks up the flavor to a whole different level. Sometimes I add nuts, depending on what's on hand and how lazy I'm feeling. Yum! The loaf never lasts more than 24 hours in my household; it's always eaten in a hurry!

I tried this recipe to the "T" and I was not pleased with the results. The flavor was not what I was expecting, I will continue to search for the perfect one.

Before I started it, I was a bit worried about the outcome. However, it's really easy to prepare and very delicious! I used Sunbeam bread machine, with Dough mode for 5mins + Bake mode for 1hr 5mins. I'll definitely try again, but maybe with smashed bananas. Thanks Dee!

Quick, easy, delicious. Worked perfectly, as written, in a Zojirsushi bread machine. Added chopped walnuts along with all other ingrediants. Wonderful!

I'm sorry but this was the worst banana bread I have ever made.  I wish I could say i messed up the ingredients, but I followed everything to a T.  Sorry, but I won't be making this ever again.

this was a good recipe.  My only complaint was it didn't work too well in my breadmaker. I had to stir it to make sure it chopped up the banana and mixed properly. wasn't mixing on it's own thoroughly in the dough setting. then my machine bake setting only goes 10 minutes at a time so I had to keep resetting it till it reached 50 minutes/ and was done cooking. tasted great. would probably have been sweeter with vanilla though.

This recipe is great.  Easy and quick.  My husband is a diabetic and I was able to make sugar substitutions without substituting taste.  I didn't think baking it in my breadmaker would turn out so good.

I LOVE this!  I made it in under 10 mins, super-easy and so delicious.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon to deliver a more exotic taste and it was amazing.  I've found this to be a great base that can be maneuvered and personalized quickly and easily - it tastes like a million!!!!

Loved how easy this is.  Made a few minor changes: added 1tsp vanilla and chopped up some pecans.  The bread batter was sweeter than I was used to, but the loaf was delicious.  My kids loved it, but asked me to leave out the nuts next time.  It's so easy, I can make a loaf for them and for us in half a morning.

This was overall very nice.  I checked on it after the five minutes of mixing and the bananas weren't really mashed, so I stopped it, mashed them in the pan with a pastry cutter and restarted.  I also had to scrape around the edges of the pan as suggested to make sure all the dry ingredients were incorporated.  I used melted butter instead of oil (what can I say, I like butter) and used a cup of whole-wheat pastry flour and a cup of white flour, as we're trying to increase our whole-grain consumption, and added some vanilla and used brown sugar.  Very nice, but the taste was just a little flat.  I think this is because the recipe has no salt and I plan to add a little salt next time.  The salt and mashing the bananas up first (probably in the baking pan, why get an extra pan dirty) will almost certainly make it five stars and I am very pleased to find a recipe that won't heat the kitchen up in the summer.

Ok, it came out great...had my doubts at first because it took forever to rise...in my own personal bread machine it took almost 3 hours to cook which is fine; I was expecting that. Next time I will add a touch of vanilla and maybe try it with nuts but this batch was perfect because my son is only 10 months old and can't have the nuts!

A GREAT recipe if you are not wanting to heat your kitchen by using an oven. Is super easy, just through everything 2gether in less than 2 minutes into my machine! Very tasty too. I did however add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. Will keep this recipe around!

I have a SUNBEAM bread maker. Thought I could make it under the quick bread setting...the cycle was 1hr 40 min and I still had to set it to the bake setting and cook it for about 40 more minutes.  Followed the recipe except I did mash the bananas before dumping them in and added 1 tsp vanilla because I like it in banana bread.  Bread came out moist and tasty. I do love "creamy banana bread" from this site, but I need to cut out all forms of dairy right now and this was a great alternative. Loved not having to clean up a large mess!

If you don't have a machine that allows you to stop and set your own time, try the Cake setting.  Mine came out perfectly and was enjoyed by the whole family!

I'm a fan of this one. I found my mother's older Black & Decker bread machine, so I thought I would try my hand. This was the first of three breads I tried and it was great! I split the over-ripe bananas (the ones you are ready to through away) and then cut them into 1 inch pieces. Apparently I knew this from the past, as it is not in the recipe. It blended perfectly and the "white bread with raisins" setting on my machine cooked it perfectly. This is one of the very first bread machines made and “raisins” means “with fruit”. I will be adding chopped walnuts or almonds next time.

The end result was pretty good- but I have to give it a 4 star because it is so easy!!!- no messy bowl to clean- I had no idea my bread maker could do this! I did mush the bananas so there were no lumps! I wish all baking was this easy!

Took the risk and  bought a bread machine at a second hand store without any directions or recipes. I knew All Recipes could help with my dilema. Thanks for the easy to make recipe.  I tried to follow the directions as is, but I had to chop up the bananas in order for it to mix well, (they were very fresh though) and after 50 mins it had not baked.  After pressing the right setting and 3 hours later, surprise it baked and turned out great.  Easy and delicous.  Thanks

This bread is absolutely great!  I did make a few add-ons however.  I added about 5 strawberries cut up & a half cup of pecans chopped in addition to the 2 bananas.  (It taste like a banana split cake)  Wonderful.  I did have to go an additional 20 mins in my bread machine to get it cooked.  I will definitely make this again!

This was my first attempt at banana bread and it turned out fabulously! I needed something for a quick breakfast that I could make ahead of time, and just happened to have some bananas on hand I needed to use up. I followed it almost exactly, except for a adding an extra banana, cinnamon, and vanilla per another review. I used the Quick bread setting on my Sunbeam breadmaker, and it turned out so well my family keeps asking for me to make it over and over!

Great Bread with and without my alterations!  I wanted a bit more banana flavor so, I put 3 halved banana's instead of 2, added 3 Tbl. honey, and added nuts.  Loved it!  I even just made the dough in the machine and then baked a loaf in the oven at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.

Made this recipe this afternoon in my bread machine, and was very pleased with the results. Mixed and baked perfectly in the machine without any problems. My only complaint would be that it's a bit too sweet (at least for my tastes), so although I will use this recipe again, next time i'll cut back a little bit on the sugar. And perhaps use brown sugar instead. Regardless, it's a good recipe.

This Bread is great! I made it in my bread maker and it worked good, but I just made it in the oven and it came out even better! Baked it at 350 for 50 min, or until you can stick a toothpick in and it comes out clean. This recipe doesn't call for butter which makes it much better for you.

Easy to follow and quick to make and is a great base recipe. Bread is not sweet. First try, bland and ate with applebutter which made the taste just right. Second try, added vanilla and almonds, great kick to the base.

Good recipe.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  Also, I put in 3 bananas, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and mixed in brown sugar with the white sugar because I didn't have enough.  I left the bread in the bread machine when the timer was up until it cooled down to make sure it cook all the way through.  And I sprinkled cinnamon on top about 3/4 of the way through baking.  Will make again when I have bananas that are on their way out!  Thanks!

Great bread!  I added walnuts a little ground Flaxseed and substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for white to make it a little healthier- it tasted fantastic.

Maybe I am just missing something, but where is all the liquid in the recipe? Mine just turned out dry and crumbly but had a good taste.

Very easy..........Keep close watch on the mising, you need to make sure all parts are being mixed. Some flour did stay in the corners, so next time I will watch the mixing closer. Looks great. I added Tupperware spice cinnamon/vanilla. Haven't tasted yet, but I'm sure it will be yummy.

My first try at banana bread-NOT this recipe- in my machine was a flop and I had not tried again for a long time. But I was very pleased with this recipe. I did add another 1/2 a banana because I had some that needed used. Mashed the banana before adding. My bread machine is old and does not have many options on the settings. On quick bread setting and used a spatula to push down the flour a couple times. Used light setting but will use normal next time because the very top was still a little raw when done cooking. I think that is a common problem with quick breads in a machine? Nice firm texture. I ate it toasted with peanut butter for breakfast until it was all gone! The last slice was eaten Elvis style this morning-PB and bacon.

Pretty good recipe. I used it as jumping off point for making a healthy banana bread in my bread machine.   I substitued splenda for sugar, apple sauce for oil and added a dash of cinnamon, about 2 tbl of vanilla and used wheat flour instead of white. I also added an extra banana (I freexe any uneaten bananas before they can go bad and then defrost in the microwave then peel length wise).   I did use the quick bread setting on my machine, which takes 1:40. I didn't get the machine to babysit it, so I took advantage of the it being able to work for me.

I loved the banana bread but was a little dry. I will blame it on my bread maker because it wouldn't work exactly to the recipes directions. Will try it again though.

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  It tastes great, and I really enjoyed it, especially because it was so easy to make.  However, next time, I think I will add one more banana (3 total versus the 2 stated).

great banana bread, super easy to make. I mix the flour with the egg and veg oil and then put it in the bread machine pan with everything else. I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon to it.

Tastes great... great consistency... easy to make.  I have a Sunbeam and I used the "sweetbread" setting.  I think it's important to stress that you must use the spatula to mix the flour from the sides of the bread machine pan.  I ignored this and now my loaf is covered with unmixed flour... not just a dusting, but alot!  But the taste of the loaf is fantastic :)  Will try again, and use the poster's advice more closely. Thanks!

Maybe it's a problem with my bread machine, but this tasted more like bread flavored with bananas than was I think of as "banana bread". It was a lot chewier than I expected. I would recommend that you really watch how long it's mixing for; maybe I overmixed it.

This was really good! It wasn't too sweet and just enough flavor. I found it to be a lovely breakfast bread to go with my coffee. If you have a larger bread maker like that makes double loafs double the recipe as it doesn't make a big loaf.

Great recipe for the bread machine. It was a bit tricky baking it though since our bread machine doesn't have a timer. We used the "Cake" setting and just watched the time it took to bake.

Superb.  I have a Toastmaster machine.  And I followed the directions to the "T".  It turned out fabulous!  The hardest part of this whole recipe is trying to make yourself not eat the entire loaf after it is done.  Just absolutely dee-LISH!

Great banana bread!!! Was a little dark around the edges, but very good and flavorful. For other users using a bread maker that only has setting buttons like sweet, dark, or light, use the Quick Bread setting. Thanks for the recipe!! Will use again and again!!

This is a great recipe to use up bananas that are getting too ripe, the ones I used were too squishy to cut in half so I just squished them and threw it in like that.  I also added an extra banana as I happened to have 3 on hand.  It worked great in my bread machine and I have a Panasonic.  Everyone loved how it tasted, especially toasted with some butter for breakfast!  Definately a keeper for us!  THANKS!!

As with other reviews, i took the advice to add an extra banana, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 4oz Apple Sauce and some seeds. I chose pumpkin seeds. I did need to cook this a bit longer than the recommended time, i had to cook for about 70 minutes - which was really irritating because my bread machine is a breville, and the bake setting is only 10 minutes long! I had to keep re setting it!!
This was great, very moist and flavourful, everyone loved it.

This came out delicious and smelled so good while cooking.  I followed what Marinated did, by adding an extra banana, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, a tiny bit of vanilla, and 4 oz of plain applesauce.  It came out very moist.  I will be making this again!!

This is a great recipe for me especially when you add nuts making Banana Nut Bread.  I might try adding a little applesauce to add a little moisture.  Either way still a wonderful bread.

I liked that it was more bread like than cake like.  I added a 3rd banana like the other reviewers and a dash of cinnamon.  Great flavor and great way to use those ripe bananas!

Yum!  I doubled the bananas the 2nd time I made this and we really enjoy it.  I try pushing the batter up in the corners to help even out the top.  My kids plow through a loaf for lunch!

I had a hard time with this recipe.  I had to stand over my machine and keep adding flour.  Gradually added about 1 cup more!  The taste was ok I guess, very dense.  Lot's of trouble when it's easier (and faster) just to mix it up by hand and put it in the oven.

This bread was delicious. I mixed the ingredients in a bowl then added it to my bread machine. I put the temperature for 300 degrees for 1 our and it turned out great. I added the cinammon and vanilla just like the others. I will probably put a little less sugar and some honey next time.

It was very difficult to tell if this bread was done (very gooey on the top), but the flavor was very good.  I had to use the "quick bread" cycle on my machine.  I may stick to using the oven.

This was ok.  I used wheat flour and added about 1/2 c. chopped almonds.  I've never used my bread machine and this was a test and it turned out ok.  Very easy and would do in a pinch for a quick coffee klatch or if you had older bananas that you wanted to use but if I wanted REALLY good banana bread I'd make it the original way with a loaf pan.

Good recipe. My bread machine wouldn't cook it all the way through the first time so I had to use 2 cycles and it still didn't come out fully cooked. It was my machine that was the problem.

I, like others have reviewed, have a Hamilton Beach bread maker that has pre-made settings that don’t allow me to change or adjust numbers. The quick bread setting over mixes the bread dough too much, and over cooks it. Banana bread is so delicate in the sense that you cannot over mix and a bread machine doesn’t care about that. My bread turned out good in texture, but a bit too firm and the flavor was off. I did it again by pouring the mixture in my bread machine and using the “bake” option instead. No overriding, and still a nice even bake. I recommend a “light” crust setting, and unplugging early if the bake is going too long with your machine settings. Yes it’s a bit extra doing all this, but I love the even bake!

This is a pretty good bread as it is, but next time I would add another banana and some more walnuts, just because of my and my husband's preferred taste. And like others have said, I mashed the banana because my machine doesn't do that very well.

This banana bread is okay.  The taste is nothing special.  I like the Betty Crocker cookbook's recipe baked in the oven much better.   Mine also turned out a bit dry after having to bake it longer due to the top being completely uncooked.  Might have been my bread machine's fault, however.  I think it is just easier to bake these kind of breads in the oven rather than fuss with finding the temperature and crust color setting for each individual bread machine.

Wonderful! Used QuickBread setting on machine, and made it vegan with Just Egg (2.5 T) for the two eggs. I also swapped coconut oil for the veg oil and added a t of vanilla extract. Came out fantastic.

Pretty well followed the instructions and incorporated a few of the reviewers suggestions, and while it was moist and tasted fairly good, it lacked the heavier density and moisture that I had sought. I did add a third banana, also some chopped walnuts and a power seed blend, cinnamon and vanilla. I am still searching for a recipe for a heavy, moist and dense banana bread like my grandma made for me every holiday.

I was looking for a quick  recipe, bread machine and I landed on this recipe. This was the first time  I'd used a bread machine. By the way, I recovered it from the basement of the building that I live in.  Wow, I love it, I must admit I tweak it.  3 tablespoon of Vegetable oil spread, and one tablespoon of coconut oil .2  Frozen banana., and the eggs I just used the white s, whipped,. Oh,, I shouldn't forget  self rising flour King Arthur's..in which I omitted the baking soda.

Beautiful banana bread. Not your usual fruit bread, much more of a "bread-y" bread that was a real hit with the family. I did add an extra banana to the recipe.

Fantastic quick bread recipe that is really easy to make. My bread maker needed 70m total on bake and it came out perfectly. Slightly sweet, we reduced sugar to half a cup on the 2nd round and it was a bit more balanced but your mileage (and sweet tooth!) may vary.

I really wanted this to work. I did exactly what you said, and right before I went to put it in, I read a few reviews saying to add a bit of vanilla and cinammon. I did, but not a lot because I didn't want to completely ruin it. After putting it in for an extra 15 minutes after the 50 minutes, it came out tasting bland and was still a bit raw in the middle.

I made this with wheat flour instead of all-purpose and it came out really thick and rich.  I'll definitely make it again.

I've made this bread many times. It's my "go to" recipe when I have a couple of over ripe bananas.  Most of the time I swap out half of the flour for a wheat flour. It gives the bread a denser texture, which I like.

I made this quick and easy.  I suggest toasting some thick slices then topping with fresh banana, french vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and seving as a "foster" desert. Crowd goes wild!

I made this recipie per the instructions in a Wolfgang Puck breadmaker. The bread tastes like all the flour had not cooked out. Also I should have added another banana.

It doesn't appear my machine lets you select a bake only setting so I used the light basic setting. Another issue I had when it was mixing, there wasn't enough liquid to make dough...so I added about a 1/4 cup milk until it started mixing. In the end I was surprised it did cook, came out dense, and tasted good.

Pretty good. Followed the other reviewers’ suggestions. The bread was moist and tasty (used applesauce and bananas to make moist, Penzey’s cake spice, and quick bread setting on my machine), but had chunks of flour throughout after scraping the edges with a spatula. Next time I will fully mix the batter beforehand and use the bread machine for lazy baking.

This is SO good!  The recipe claims to be “no frills”, so I took that as permission to experiment and “frill” it up a little bit…  I was looking for a recipe to use on the Quick Bread setting on my bread machine, and to use up 3 over-ripe bananas.  I love cinnamon and bananas together, so added 1 tsp, and I wanted to try the Bourbon Vanilla extract from TJ’s, so added 1 tsp of that as well.  I didn’t mash the bananas just broke them into chunks and added them to the wet ingredients in the bread pan.  The bread machine did most of the work — mashing, mixing and baking.  (I did scrape the sides a couple of times while it was mixing) The result was amazing!  Dense, flavorful and addictive.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I might add chopped nuts or maybe some poppy seeds.

I'd like to give this 5 stars for method and texture and 2 stars for flavor. It tasted a lot like the store bought baked goods in that it has a lot of white sugar and is made with white flour. It lacked the richness of brown sugar and whole wheat and was also too sweet for me. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp each of cardamon and nutmeg. I only had 2 bananas but wish I could have used 3.The flavor was still quite mild and as I said too sweet for me. But the bread machine method is awesome and the texture was nice. I think it also would have been nice to use butter instead of oil. I think I will try a different recipe but am very grateful to have discovered this method and the basic recipe that uses eggs is good, too. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good - one of the best breads/pies I've made using my bread machine. I also added ~1 teaspoon vanilla sugar and ~0.5 teaspoon cinnamon.
To those who don't have a stop button - just pull the plug when it's time.

my go to banana bread recipe! so easy and it turns out great even though it seems so simple.  I added some vanilla and cinnamon after the first few times I made it. But it really is great just the way it's written. AND SO EASY!

Delicious! This was the first time I ever used my bread machine in this way, and it worked out great. A few things: 1) I took the blade out after the bread was mixed so the bread wouldn't have a hole in the bottom in the end (don't know if the instructions said to do that). 2) I didn't use any sugar or bananas. I used 3/4 c persimmons in place of the sugar and bananas. Also, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Wow! The house smelled great while this was cooking, and everyone loved it.

Turned out fantastic! I added a 3rd banana and 1/3 cup of walnuts.  Made 2 loafs, first loaf cooked for 1 hr 20 min on light crust setting, second was on medium crust setting, used the same cook time so a little over done but still good. Love that there is no dairy in it so I can enjo y too.

I'll admit I held my breath as I made this recipe, as I have a Sunbeam Bread Machine and like some other reviewers, there is not a separate bake cycle on it. Following the advice of others, I used the Quick Bread cycle and plunged ahead with the recipe. After reading the reviews, I added another banana, 1/2 tsp of  vanilla and 1/4 tsp of salt. The bread is denser than other recipes I have made, that being said, it is tasty and I will make it again (not having to puree the banana was very positive!).

I used the quick bread setting; 1 hour 20 minutes . Checked it at 1 hour then every 5 minutes. Sides were cooked, but toothpick still came out wet. Result: over cooked edges, and a bit dry. I would omit using the baking soda and a bit less of the baking powder as you could definitely taste it in the bread.  I usually use the recipe in the Bread Machine cookbook, but wanted to try this one.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for!  Simple and quick to make directly in the machine bowl. The original recipe makes a perfectly adequate banana bread.  My kids prefer more bananas and the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Used the recipe, but baked it in the oven in a glass 8 1/2" loaf pan-Wonderfully crunchy crust on all sides, and moist on the in.  After checking with reviews, I made these changes:  added a 3rd small banana, subbed 1/4 c. brown sugar for one of the 3/4 cups of sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 chopped pecans, 1 tsp vanilla, & 2 Tbsp raisins.  Also, I mixed the wet & dry ingredients separately, then added the dry to the beaten bananas, vanilla, oil, & egg, stirring gently just enough to  mix. Then folded in the nuts & raisins. Baked at 350 for 45 min, checked it and decided to lower the temp to 325 for the last 5 min so as to not over-brown the outside. I have made this before in the bread machine, & the loaf turned out very soft, light colored, and short.  In the oven it made a beautiful crispy tall full loaf. with a hint of cinnamon. YUM!

From the start I was skeptical, lack of spices etc.
It is too plane. I made it a second time;  adding  another banana, cinnamon, nutmeg and used coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil and preferred the results.  Think I will continue using my oven for future banana breads.

I doubled the recipe, then adjusted it for high altitude. Added about a cup of chopped walnuts, a cup of chopped cranberries, and a cup of chocolate chips.  I did not want to cook this in a bread machine because of the texture.  So I allowed the machine to run until all ingredients were smooth. (Realized this will work with a regular mixer...) Then ladled it out into oiled mini muffin pans and baked it in the oven for 25 minutes.  The results were fantastic.  Thought the recipe would be too sweet, but absolutely loved it.

I think it was great. I will make it again , although I would rather double the recipe next time  because  the one I made ended up smaller than I would have liked. :-)

It seemed okay while it was cooking, but I'm not so sure what happened, but it turned out kind of dry and bland.

My first time to make bread.  This was an easy recipe & before I knew it was finished, the adult child of mine and the grand baby had eaten over half of it.  When I took it with me on a road trip, I was told to not come home.  They are insisting I make more today.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe! So quick and so easy! I add a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt. It's great without those additions, but like all chefs and bakers we can't help but tweak the recipe. Great job. I am very pleased

Moist and delicious! I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 extra banana, 1 single serving of an applesauce cup, and 1 cup chocolate chips. I changed the flour to 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour. It cooked for longer than an hour.

I made this and it turned out very dry. I followed the directions just like it said and after it cooled it was very heavy. I believe it needs some alteration done to it and it would be very good. I'm going to look for another reciepe that has more moisture to it .

Added Half a spoonful of cinnamon powder, a handful of Walnuts and a tablespoonful of golden linseeds.

Baked for 75 minutes.
 Perfect. The banana bread was more like a cake.
Excellent buttered.

For the first loaf I followed the instructions. 
Second loaf, I added a individual container (snack pack) of applesauce and 1/4 cup almond milk, plus one extra banana?? with all the ingredients listed.

My daughter tried both, and said that she liked the applesauce ?? one more, because the first one tastes like to much banana... I think she's crazy, but I enjoyed both recipes.

I altered the recipe a lot after reading other reviews, so it is quite different than the original.  I added an extra egg, tsp of vanilla, tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, extra mashed banana and brown sugar instead of white I I used the quick bread setting.   Came out moist and flavorful.

I made it my Welbilt bread machine. The only two things I changed were the flour; from all purpose to bread flour and I added a cup of walnuts. The loaf came out huge!!! I followed the directions exactly. I made the dough on the dough cycle really mixing the bottom and sides very well - lots of hidden flour pockets. Once complete I put it on bake for an hour, check it, it rose and started to look like a loaf but was complete liquid inside. I put it on bake for another 20 minutes and it was completely done! Huge and heavy!!! probably the heaviest and largest loaf of bread I've ever made. I've only tried an end piece, however so far I'm thinking of a couple changes I plan to try: add brown sugar and a little salt. It's good, but needs a little work.

Not sure if I did something wrong here but it didn't cook fully in the middle. I had flour embedded into the bottom, even though I was thorough with scraping with the spatula(great thing was my machine will continue to knead with the lid up. I was pretty confident about getting all the ingredients mixed, but that was my fail. I used 3 small ripe bananas and sliced them into rounds. I took a sample taste off the end piece and there was a lingering vinegar taste. I thought it was an odd ingredient - but what do I know?
I have an older Breadman machine that works well with yeast formulated breads. So it very well could have been the machine and a user error. However I followed the directions to the T and didn't come out feeling successful. I would not try this receptive again unless I have an ah-ha moment down the road and figure out a way to make it work,

Yes, I will make it again. My husband said it's perfect. But I have some comments. I use this recipe but I doubled it and add 100 grams walnuts. It took 1 hour 30 minutes to cook it well. Also you need to be sure that dough mixed well, before baking, by checking with spatula in corners of the pan.

I tossed all the ingredients and used the cake cycle cause I don't have a bake cycle on my bread machine.  I checked it out around 15 to 20 minutes before the end of cycle with a tooth pick and it was done.  This is so yummy! Easy too.

Excellent recipe! I do highly recommend adding 1/2t salt- sweet baked goods need salt as much as any savory dish. 
I added 1/2 C walnuts and 1/2 C chocolate chips, because we always have to gild the lilly...

Like another reviewer, my bread machine Hitachi) doesn't have just a 'bake' setting, but it will steam rice.  I used the 'dough' setting until it was mixed, then used the rice cycle 4 times until it was done.  It was moist, dense and delicious.  Didn't make  any changes this time, but next time I will add some vanilla and cinnamon.

this is an amazing recipe, it comes out perfect as-is, but it is also the perfect wet/dry ratio to make it your own!  I have started substituting bananas for pumpkin puree (add spices like cinnamon & nutmeg if you do this)  or apple chunks, I sub a full cup of flour for a cup of mixed oats, almond flour, chia & flax...it still works!

Great recipe!  I added 1/2 cup each quick oats andbchocolate chips, 2 tsp cinnamon, dash of vanilla, and 1/4 top yeast.  My hubby almost ate half the loaf at once!  I have a black and Decker all in one with the double spindles.  I put it on rapid bake 2 and it seemed to work perfectly.

Caveat - I amended this recipe and loved it, If I had made this recipe exactly as described, I would have rated it a 4. Some other review mentioned their bananas didn't get mixed properly by their machine, so I pealed a single strip drown the bananas and used a fork to mash them while in the peel (this took no time and didn't dirty an extra dish) as I added them to the mix. I also thought it might turn out bland, so I added a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Next time I think I'll substitute applesauce for oil and I'll make sure I have nuts on hand and add those as well!

This banana bread was amazing & wonderful served warm!  I ended up baking it for 60 minutes & it was perfect.  I had never done the stir/bake option that the recipe mentions, but it worked well!  I will be confident to try other recipes now that I know how quick and easy it was!

VERY good recipe, and easy to follow!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and some pumpkin pie spice. 

Spread some room temperature butter over this baby and it's heaven!  :-)

I've made this a few times, and love it. I use the Quick Bake setting on my machine, and it's come out well every time. I add a quarter cup of chopped walnuts, for some extra crunch. Delicious-

Very moist. I reduced the cooking oil to 1 tbsp and added 3 tbsp of sour cream. I used the quick bread setting on my machine as others suggested. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. Very good base recipe for sweet bread in the machine!

I don't see why you need to stop it after only a few minutes in the dough setting. I just let it go through & then set it to quick bake & it turns out yummy!

I added a third of a cup of apple sauce instead of the oil.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I do recommend scraping the sides of the bread maker pan before it starts baking, as I had a slightly floured area on top.  I left the bread and the house and when I came home it was too late.  My bread maker has a quick breads setting, so I did not have to select knead and then select light.  I just selected quick bread and the bread was done in about an hour.  Great recipe!!!

This is a wonderful bread!! Easy to make too. So far I have added 3 tablespoons of Orange Juice to this and it was delicious. Also 3/4 cup chocolate chips. I also used my Two Pound bread pan and the bread cooked faster, but also worked great in my two One pound loafs pan, just had to cook 15 additional minutes.

I have tried this recipe and my family loves it sooo much. Those who are complaining that they have Black & Decker and can't 'stop' the machine then I recommend you do this: Put all your ingredients in the bread machine and press start. Let the machine run for about 6 or so minutes and just unplug it. It has to stop, right? After that, just check and see if everything is mixed (using a spatula). If your ingredients are not properly mixed, after using spatula, run the machine again for 2 minutes. After that, just grease a pan and add a bit of flour and put your dough in there, bake it in the oven at 175 degrees Celsius for about 15-20 minutes and there u have it! I never bake in bread machine simply because I don't like the shape...and it's not always well done in the middle. I however mix the ingredients in the bread machine, then transfer to pan and then oven.

This was a quick and easy recipe that worked well in my bread machine. The only thing I'd change is maybe adding a pinch of salt. It seemed a bit flat flavor wise. I added a cup of walnuts bits to mine. Texture was spot on, easy to slice and this will be a keeper recipe.

It was easy to make, but ...
The taste just isn't quite there for me missing something, as well as being quite dry.  That, and I'm definitely going back to hand-mixing and using the oven over the bread-machine for Banana-Nut bread.

I was so excited about this recipe.  Followed the directions to the point it says stop the machine. I do not have any of the other options that the reciped said so I had to just start all over again with my machine settings. I dont get to pick bake times etc.

Mine turned out a lil mushy and under done as well.  I used the fruit and nut bread setting in my bread machine. Also used an extra 1/2 banana and sub. applesauce for oil (as I do in most recipes).  I think I will use the basic setting next time on my machine or move the dough to the oven and bake it that way.  Will surly make this again because the flavor was great, perfect with a cup off coffee for breakfast!

Worked great with our Welbilt bread machine. I used the Dough setting to mix the dough, I let it sit through the whole setting. Then I used the 2 cups quick bread setting and allowed the bread to cook for about 60 min. The bread turned out great! I also made sure to set it to the light setting so the bread didn't over cook on the sides. My only issue I came across was the top was a little doughly in the center about half a finger length in. Highly reccommend this easy recipe to everyone!

I made the recipe, as is, in my spanking new Emeril T-Fal bread machine, under the CAKE setting. It came out very well; the crust was crusty and the inside was nice. I am sure I can improve on it by changing out or adding some ingredients but I am satisfied with my results. It is super super good when toasted. Wow, baking without mixing and washing bowls and baking pans is heaven!

I made this in my bread maker. I set the setting for basic crust 1 1/2 - 2lbs and I had to finish this thing in my oven.  My machine is hardly used so I know it's not that.  Do not make this in a bread machine.

Great banana bread! Dense and hearty but not heavy on the belly. I added a 3rd banana, about a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to add character and it turned out fantastic! Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I had no white sugar, so I had to use brown sugar instead. I also used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. It turned out very well, except there were some unmixed floury portions on the bottom of the bread. Next time I'll make sure to mix it first before putting it in the machine pan to avoid this. I took the advice of a reviewer below, to use the quick bake setting because of my type of bread machine. Overall a very good recipe! Will definitely make again and again :D

This recipe was very good but by adding a teaspoon of vanilla, it was even better! I mixed the wet ingredients & placed them on the bottom, mixed the dry ingredients & put them on top, then added some walnuts. It turned out delicious!

Came out great (though in my machine I had to bake it for 1:15). Next time I'm going to add walnuts or chocolate chips.

This bread is delicious!  I added a little bit of vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and I used 3 bananas.  It took a little longer to bake, but it was outstanding!

This was a great use of some banana's I had starting to spoil.  I also don't have a "bake" only cycle on my machine.  I used the 80 min. quick bake option and it turned out great.  It's a very dense breakfast/snack bread.  With peanut butter on it my 9 y/o went nuts!  Smells SOOOO good when baking.  I added a little vanilla and cinnamon as did another reviewer and I think that added a little more flavor.  I could also see adding some nuts but I didn't have any.  All in all I will make this again for sure.  And as another reviewer mentioned, scrape down those sides so you don't have leftover unmixed flour!  ENJOY!

Good bread for the bread machine. If you are looking for the texture of a quick bread, this is not for you. We like to serve this toasted with peanut butter for breakfast and it is perfect for that. Thanks for giving me another breakfast option.

This is a nice easy banana bread that tastes great.  For a little variety I replaced the 3/4 cup of sugar with 3/4 cup of strawberry preserves.  YUMMY!

It made a pretty loaf! I followed the directions exactly but added some cinnamon as someone else suggested. My sons both gave this a thumbs up. I have a programmable bread machine and followed the settings as listed. Next time I'll slice the bananas first though because there were a few chunks in there.

I am in South Florida and thought this would be a wonderful way to make banana bread without heating up the kitchen....NOT the case!! This did not rise at all and even though it is brown, is is mush inside! I am really shocked because of all the positive reviews!! Other than adding a touch of Cinnamon and some craisins, I followed the recipe to the letter! I will try it again, but for this attempt, I am NOT impressed!

Well the Idea sounded good! Dug the old bread machine out and gave this recipe a try. Love banana bread and I had a few left over from the last stock that ripened. I added a 1/3 cup of chopped pecans, 1/2t of cinnamon, and a little vanilla and got the machine a working. After the dough mixed for about 4 minutes I pulled the plug and then used the "cake" cycle on my old Hitachi which will bake for 70 minutes. Well after 70 minutes the bread was still raw on the top! I tried to re-start the machine for more cook time but wouldn't start again until it cooled down. At that point I gave up and took the bread out of the pan. Good thing it didn't cook more, the sides of the loaf were getting dark and hard. I trimmed the loaf down a bit and ate it anyway!! Tasted pretty good but I didn't care for the cinnamon. I'll try it again someday but will have to use the oven next time.

This didn't work for me. I have a WEST BEND bread maker.  I used the dough mixer part as mentioned. but mine, takes 3 hrs for a light loaf to be baked, that includes all the mixing and rising.  I can't adjust it.  So I ended up, putting it a pan and had to mix it again, as it still wasn't mixed. Then baking in the oven for an hour.  Great tasting.   I will try this again, but change things around a bit, for the breadmaker.. I'm sure there is a way to make this work.

This was very yummy. It seemed a little dry to me at first but everyone loved it. The second time I tried it, I added a little cinnamon because I love cinnamon and it was a hit. Thanks for the great recipe.

My toastmaster bread machine does not have a bake option. I added an extra banana, some cinamon and vanila, a small box raisins and a handful of pecans ran on dough cycle for 10 minutes.  Put in a greased bread pan and baked at 350 for 70 minutes.  The bread was perfect. Best banana bread ever out of the bread machine.

Very Good, Very Easy, Family loved it. Personally, I prefer whole wheat flour, and brown sugar. I also added a few chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Worked great in our bread machine.

Great recipe! I've been the owner of a bread machine for less than a week. This is the first quick bread recipe I've tried, and it turned out perfect. I also added cinnamon and walnuts, as well as a teaspoon of vanilla sugar. Had to bake mine an extra 15 minutes, but it was worth the extra wait.
