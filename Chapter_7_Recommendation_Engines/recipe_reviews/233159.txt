I had no rotini, so I used orecchiette pasta which worked out well.  You get so much color from the vegetables that I don't think that tri-color pasta would enhance presentation.  I used mini-cukes, so no need to peel, and added a little more honey to suit our tastes.  After refrigeration, the pasta really soaked up the dressing, so I think I'd add more dressing the next time. This is a nice pasta salad with a lot of fresh veggies and was enjoyed on a hot summer day.

It was delicious.  I added more olive oil, vinegar, honey and pepper. I also added Oregano.
