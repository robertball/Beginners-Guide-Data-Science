These are very oily and, because of the coconut and white chocolate chips, almost too sweet, which is why I decided to tone down the sweetness with a drizzle of semisweet chocolate rather than the white chocolate.  And it worked--they were much better.  Obviously these cookies are quick and easy to make, and I guess they'd be okay in a pinch, but I doubt I'll be making a point to buy the cookie mix to make them again.  I could see these as a fun thing to make with kids. Update: Hubs came home from work, ate four of these even before dinner, and promptly rated these 5-star. That said, I am compromising, revising my rating from three stars to four!

I had a hard time with the dough...very dry.  I ended up adding 1 Tbsp water and still was kind of dry.  I made them for my sister in place of macaroons and she said they were a keeper.  I was disappointed, I hoped I didn't have to make them again.

Great cookie! I made these last Christmas & was asked by my Fiance's brother to make a triple batch next time.  I skipped the coconut extract & they still had plenty of flavor. still had plenty of flavor.

These cookies are addictive!  My mother made them last year and my sister and I couldn't stop eating them.  My sister begged my mother not to make them this year - so I am!  Hee hee hee!

Note:  We do not add the coconut extract.
