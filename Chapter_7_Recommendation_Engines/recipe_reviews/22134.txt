This is a great make a head dish.  I have made it several times and wach time it has been a big hit.  It does reheat well, in the rare event there is any left over.  I plan on incorporating this into our holiday brunch this year.

Like everything I make, I changed the recipe a bit.  I omitted the tomato, and added ham.  I also sauteed some hot peppers with the onions. It was excellent.

I used what I had on hand- regular white bread and tomato paste instead of tomatoes.  There were a LOT of onions in it, although I halved the amount of onions I put in it.  My husband, who dislikes onions, will normally eat them if they're 'disguised' well.  He hated this recipe.

I thought it was really good, however!!!  My daughter loved it as well, but we both love onions!  I'll make it again, but when he's out of town!
