Pizzaiola in southern Italy refers to a dish, almost always beef, cooked with pizza flavorings, meaning canned plum tomatoes and dried oregano. This recipe is a healthy take on that idea.  The chicken turns out so tender and flavorful - great if you are looking for something different to do with chicken.  Very versatile (think of all the veggies you can sub in & out) & healthful, too.  One of my favorite recipes in the winter!

Tasty dish... I actually made this in a crock pot and added carrots, an onion and fresh garlic.  In order to have enough liquid to cover everything I added a second can of diced tomatoes, a can of crushed tomatoes, and 1/2 can of beer. I started with frozen chicken breasts so I let the whole thing cook in the crock for about 6 hours. The veggies and chicken absorb a ton of flavor from the slow cooking.

Tasty, tangy healthy comfort food. I cut down on chicken (used what I had - 2 breasts). Added 1/4 onion. Flavors permeated chicken. Next time will add 2 cloves minced garlic. This was a winner - husband went back for seconds.

I made this last night and it was delish. Today, for lunch I had some with some white rice. It tasted great. thank you again for the great recipe. The only thing I did different was cut the potatoes smaller. Still delish. Enjoy

This was a delicious recipe! I substituted chopped celery for the green peppers because I didn't have any on hand. It was a hit with the whole family!

Delicious! Made a few changes (added sliced onion and cooked uncovered to thicken sauce). Will definitely make again.

Used celery instead of green pepper and did not pound the chicken.  Used large breasts and cooked the entire 45 minutes, came out delicious! Next time I will cut the potato a little smaller.
