I loved the marinade but next time I will use it on filet mignon or ribeyes-the flank steak is too tough for our tastes.

Really outstanding marinade!!  It seriously took me about 2 minutes start to finish to get this prepped and then just 5 minutes on the grill, and it tasted fantastic.  I added a little more soy sauce and a little less vegetable oil.  Also, once the steak went on the grill my husband boiled the remaining marinade in a saucepan, added a tiny bit of cornstarch, and made a fabulous sauce to dip the meat in!!

Great steak marinade, perfect for when you don't have a lot of time. I used olive oil vs. veg oil, low sodium soy sauce, white wine vinegar, and chili sauce instead of ketchup along with the garlic.  In most marinades that call for ketchup I use chili sauce as a good rule of thumb because it provides that little extra kick. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for four hours. Be sure to bring your steak to room temp. before grilling. The steak came out very flavorful - a definite keeper.

This was easy and very good. I had it in the refrigerator for about a day and cook it in the oven and came out great. The steak was nice and tender. This is be one of those easy to make summer dinners. I am a big big fan of garlic so of course had to add more. I am pretty sure I added about 3 tablespoons and some onion powder to the mix. I cooked it on about 300 deg. for about 1 hour and 15 mins and came out perfect. Thanks

My husband and I are not that fond of steak  but we were given some and so tried this recipe. I am not very good at grilling or frying so I also cooked the steak in the oven (300F for 1 hour). I put the marinade in with the steak when I cook it to help keep it moist. As long as it is not over cooked it comes out tender and moist and we really enjoyed it. Any time we do have steak this is the recipe that we will use.

Good stuff.  I only marinated for 3 hours and the flavor was good.  I think I will marinate longer next time for more flavor.

Wonderful marinade!  I used this on a London Broil and it was sensational!  Made great leftovers too.  I used it the next day sliced thinly for a steak salad with blue cheese vinaigrette.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this marinade and can't wait to try it on other meats. I also think if I took a burr (stick) mixer to it it would be really good as a salad dressing on a ramen noodle salad

This recipe needs tweaked as it does not have enough of the ingredient to actually marinate.  Would have to have more of the vinegar or lemon juice marinates, too.  But, the entire recipe would need to be changed.  The flavor is good, however.

I was really surprised on how good this was. I needed a meal fast, so I only marinaded the flank steak for about 3 hours. It was really good.

I'm usually very fussy about marinades but this one is incredible!  It's very easy to make and the flavors blend well.  I used a rib eye steak and let it sit in the marinade overnight.  The steak came off the grill melt-in-your-mouth delicious!

It was so good. my group for class used a George Forman grill, but we couldnt get it to cook all the way through so we took it off the skewers and laid it out on the grill. The flavor was sooo yummy, and it was very juicy.

This made for a wonderful meal.  My only addition to marinade was 1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce.  I had less than stellar frozen steaks that needed used, and I was really impressed with how well the meat tasted.  I sliced the steaks fairly thin across the grain, marinated for an hour and stir fried with a little oil in the wok. I added some broccoli and touch more marinade, and simmered for about 10 minutes. It was served over rice with cooked down extra marinade for sauce.  Simply delish! All 6 people served gave it 5 stars (well, actually 1 gave it 10 to be honest:) Truly a rare occurrence!   this is going into the regular rotation. In the future I will double sauce and maybe add some onion and more veggies like carrots. Instant 5 star dinner...so simple and so good! Thanks Grace!

Excellent recipe. It's even better if you let it marinate overnight, like I did, It really brings out the flavor. I used sirloin tip steak (which is really lean and tender) and cooked it in a pan with a tablespoon of vegetable oil under medium-low heat for about 5 minutes a side. My husband cannot get enough of it. I'm not really a steak fan, but this marinade is excellent!

Good marinade for flank steak. 
Flank steak is tender if cut properly. You need to slice the steak against the grain of the meat. If you cut it wrong, it will be tough.

This has got to be one of the best marinades ever. My whole family loves it and I have given the recipe out at least a dozen times now. If you have leftovers, it makes a great sandwich the next day. Thank you for a great recipe.

I was really reluctant to use ketchup on a good steak, but it turned out to be a great combination of flavors. I did add a little more garlic, but I’m sure it would have been just as good without it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used some round steak instead of flank. Cut it into very thin strips across the grain. I let it marinate for about 3 hours and then cooked it on a g.f. grill. Wrapped it in a flour tortilla with mozz cheese. I thought it was pretty good. My daughter thought it was a little sweet. Will def use this again.

My husband made this using steaks grilled on the George Forman.  He didn't marinate them for 3 hours, but they still tasted good.  I think they would have been better if he had marinated them longer.

I really liked how easy and quick this marinade is to prepare.  I just put all the ingredients in the plastic bag and swirled them around a bit instead of mixing in a separate bowl, then let the steak marinate for about 8 hours.  The marinade was nice because it flavored the meat well and smelled good, but didn't completely overpower the beef taste.  We will use this one again!  Thanks!

This recipe was super delicious.  I changed the recipe a bit.  I added extra garlic and cut it into small chunks instead of crushed.  I also added a bit of brown sugar and a couple of squirts of lemon juice.  I also added some Club House Greek seasoning.(lots of it.)  I also used sirloin tip and I marinated it for about 7.5 hrs.  I broiled it because it was raining, but can't wait to try it again and bbq them.  This will be a new favourite marinade keeper in our house.

I halved this recipe for 2-5oz fillet-type steaks (put everything in a freezer bag, froze a couple of weeks, then let them defrost/marinate for a couple of days).  We couldn't grill (bad weather), so I ended up pan-frying them.  Delicious.  The marinade almost carmelized on the outside!

This was pretty good.  Next time I will let it marinade overnight to really get the flavor but it was good either way.

This was pretty good.  The meat came out tender but the flavor was not very strong.  Thanks for the recipe but I don't think I'll be making it again.

It was a good recipe. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I love garlic so I added a bit more. I also added onion powder. I grilled two London broils. They were delicious.

This recipes is the best! I use this with flank steak and every time i get rave reviews. I don't eat meat, so for me to make a good steak for my family of meat eaters was important. They love this recipe, and even served it to guests and they all take the recipe home with them. I would not change a thing.

Very good, very fast. Only marinated steaks for about 1 1/2 hours because we decided late to do this. Still had plenty of taste. Next time will marinade at least 4 hours or more for extra flavor. Will make this again, Thanks.

I also used Olive Oil and only had balsamic vinegar it ended up tasting wonderful.  Ketchup (tomato flavor) dominates the marinade, so adjust the ketchup to your liking.  Next time I'm going to add hot sauce to the marinade to spice it up :)

This was delicious. I did use flank steak, but instead of grilling I broiled mine for 5 minutes on each side. It turned out yummy. It is important to remember to let your food rest for at least 10 minutes after you take it out and to cut AGAINST the grain.

I've used this recipe at least 10 times. So simple and delicious. Throw a couple of flank steaks in a bag, then grill them. Great for large groups, this recipe easily expands. I often triple it.

The marinade was made according to the recipe but my boyfriend and I didn't think that there was enough flavor. I'll try this recipe again but maybe I'll add more garlic next time.

This was a great starter recipe for a great marinade.  Although his original recipe is ok, I dressed it up a bit to give it an extra flair. (I also doubled i  Instead of using regular distilled white vinegar, I tried using Imported White Wine Vinegar, and mixed 'Enova' brand vegetable/soy oil with a deep bodied Sesame oil; and mixed soy and terriaky sauce to make the same amount called for; a tablespoon of garlic 'juice' from which my store-bought chopped garlic is packaged in, a couple dashes of Tobasco, a good squirt of dijon mustard (probably the equivalent of 2 tbs), and a whole minature Cracker Barrel 100% pure Maple Syrup (the bottles you get with your pancakes...I only use them for cooking).
These adjustments made for a great marinade, thank you for a great start!

I made this tonite and then grilled the steaks on the GForeman grill, it was out of this world! I didn't expect it to be so savory and delicious. I had marinated the steaks about 4 hours. Next time I'll do it longer but I don't see how it could be any better!

If I could give this 20 stars I definitely would! AWESOME FLAVOR! I marinated my sirloin tip steaks which I had cut up into chunks for about 6 hours. Skewered the meat with vegetables and lil smokies. YUMM! I made the mistake of not reserving some of the marinade for basting tho, had to resort to another recipe to baste while cooking. next time I will save some of the marinade before I add my meat to soak and use that as basting sauce. YUMM, WE LOVE KABOBS PREPARED THIS WAY! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

Oooh, yeah, Babe!  Thank you Grace!  Easy marinade to make, easy to work with, and Yummm.  Husband likes less garlic than I, so I make it with less, still good.  Used Chuck eye.  Melt in your mouth is right.  It's a keeper!

This was the best steak ever I used rib eyes, also I only used the soy sauce fresh garlic (lots of it) and salt free steak seasoning. Let them  sit in fridge for (1hr) before grilling over charcoal (med rare) 5+++++ stars.

Good and easy.  My husband said dinner tonight was better than some he has paid for recently (made this and some roasted red potatoes).  To make clean up even easier, I just used a large ziploc bag and opened it over an empty canister to pour things in more easily and then just closed it up and marinated for about 6 hours.  This will be added to my regular rotation- super easy and tasty too.

We didn't have the garlic specified, so we used garlic salt.  And we didn't measure the ketchup.  And by some strange force of nature these ended up marinating for about 24 hours or more.  They came out a little more tangy than I expected, but, man, they were good!  I would definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks! :)

I've been making marinade with the same ingredients for years, but the measurements in this recipe are off. There's not enough vinegar to tenderize the meat. I've always used 2:1 vinegar to the other ingredients. I also use balsamic or red wine vinegar. It works excellent on chicken, beef and pork. It's also delicious for shish kabobs (marinate the veggies, too). So for about 2 pounds of meat, you'd want to use 1/2 balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup oil, 2-4T minced garlic. Measure the oil before the ketchup so when you measure the ketchup, it will all come easily out of the measuring cup. It's best if you marinate for 24 hours and turn the ziplock bag periodically. If you want to set it in the fridge and forget about it, then make enough marinade to completely cover the meat.
