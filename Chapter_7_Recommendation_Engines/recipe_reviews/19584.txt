Very good flavor! I have made this 3 times this summer, with the last batch having about 4 hot peppers added! We love it with white beans and cornbread. Make it in wide-mouth pint jars, halfpints aren't big enough. Thanks Linda for a great recipe.

Thanks Linda my Mother made this Green Tomato Relish when I was a kid.When she died her recipe's disappeared. My favorite meal was Her Meatloaf with the Relish piled on.Mashed Potatoe's,Gravey, and her Toss Salad, and warm Home Made Bread. I can smell the aroma from her kitchen now 69 years latter

I made a batch of this. It has a very good flavor and is great on sandwiches and burgers. It also makes a interesting tatar sauce when mixed with mayonase or salad dressing. Try it!!

YUMMY!!! My family would eat this as an entree! I made 1/4 of the original recipe. I was able to can 2 wide-mouthed pint jars and 3 half-pint jelly jars from the 1/4 recipe. The only thing I would change is that next time I'll reduce the celery seed by just a tiny bit--maybe use 2 TSP instead of 2-1/4 TSP. But really, this is a wonderful relish.

Yesterday I removed my vegetable plants and had loads of green tomatoes.  I decided to look for a way to use them and chose this recipe.  Wow!  Delicious! I used only 3 cups of sugar but was very pleased with the results.  This is going to make great Christmas gifts.  Now I can't wait until next year's garden!

This is an awesome recipe!  I think I may have used a bit more tomatoes then called for...I didn't count because I had a lot of very little ones.  I also did not drain the juices, I used them and everything seemed to come out fine.  This recipe made 17 one pint jars for me.  My DF who normally does not like relish piled this high on his hot dog.  I am grateful for this recipe so all those end of the season tomatoes don't go to waste!  Thank you!

My husband made this recipe as we had an over abundance of tomatoes this year and we had to find various recipes for green tomatoes. This recipe was excellent and very easy to make. Thanks to Linda McDaniel for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is the best relish recipe I have ever used in 40 years of canning.Great on hot dogs, ham eggs or put cream cheese on a craker and a dollop of this  WOW!!!!. A hint to the lady who had trouble chopping it to the right size. Fill your blender 3/4 with water, add quartered tomatoes and pulse a little until it's the right size for you, put in a colander over a bowl to drain and  reuse the water. Also works good for peppers, onions etc. Great way to shred cabbage for slaw too.

My mom made this relish every fall to use up all those green tomatoes! It was a family favorite. Mom died before she could pass along the recipe. How delighted I was to find it on Allrecipes. I reduced the sugar to 3 cups and canned in 12 oz. jam jars. Thanks, Linda, for sharing this recipe. It's a delicious walk down Memory Lane.

One difficulty I had with this recipe: how big is a large tomato? We had large beefsteaks that had bigger water content and larger size than normal. It was hard trying to adjust to what was expected of "24 large tomatoes". Alot of guesswork involved. Surely a poundage or a volumetric measurement would help more!

The simmering mixture turned out needing more vinegar and more sugar in adjustment, my guess being that there was too much tomato from misguessing. That said, I tried my best to get it to a nice outcome but the final product tasted like there was an ingredient missing somewhat.

Still it was a pretty decent, if fussy outcome.

We've used a similar recipe to this for generations. Great for using up the last of the green tomatoes from the garden in the fall.  We love it!  The only difference I can see is we've always used some horseradish and some cloves. We put the spices in a cloth bag and only let a few escape into the relish. Here's my recipe:    Green Tomato Relish (24 pints)   30 # green tomatoes 6 sweet red peppers 12 green peppers 12# med. onions 3 cups salt 6 qt. cider vinegar 12 cups sugar 6 Tbsp. celery seed 12 Tbsp. mustard seed 6 Tbsp. horseradish 6 tsp. whole cloves  Grind all vegetables on fine grind.  Add salt.  Let sit overnight.  Drain (squeeze!) all liquid out of vegetables.  All liquid!    Place vinegar in large pan.  Add sugar and horseradish.   Place spices in cloth spice bag ( I let a few celery seeds and mustard seeds escape).   Add DRAINED vegetables.  Bring to boil.  Pack into jars.  Seal.  Hint:  Light a couple of candles while you're grinding the onions.  It helps burn off (cook) the onion gases so they won't bother your eyes.

This is close enough to my recipe that I feel I can review it. This stuff is so superior to store-bought relish! I can't eat a hot dog, hamburger, or ham sandwich at home without it. For a wonderful treat and a quick appetizer, mix this relish with shredded extra sharp cheddar, mash together, and add low-fat mayonnaise to a spreading consistency. Serve with crackers. Fast, different, and fabulous. Also great in ham salad. Grind the ham, add relish and mayo to taste. Best ever!!!!

This was my first time canning by myself. I had a bushel of green tomatoes and found this recipe. I read ALL of the reviews for help, and decided to cut the sugar to 3 cups. I am glad I did! It was super sweet with the 3 cups. I had two pots of it on the stove, and added fresh jalepenos to one of them. That gave it a sweet and spicy taste, and i prefered that. i don't like sweet relish or sweet pickles, so cutting the sugar for me was needed. Overall, my onions were super strong, and next time i would probably cut them down, and make sure the green tomato's stood out more. It is a good relish, and unique flavor that you cannot get at any store!

I never would have guessed that this recipe would be sooooo good!  What a great use for green tomatoes!  I was uncertain whether the tomatoes should be peeled and cored, but since it didn't specify in the recipe, I just chopped them up whole.  It came out fine!  (I HATE the whole peeling and coring ordeal)  I left sugar as is and added a couple of peppers for some zip.  It is all you really need on a hot dog, the mustard, tomato, celery seed, relish, and onion are all there in one package!  Great for making thousand island or tartar sauce.  I never added relish to my chicken or tuna salad, but I do now!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This is SO good.  However, I took the advice of so many others and added only 3 cups of sugar.  It was more than enough.  With 3 cups worth it has the equivelent sweetness that store bought relish would have.  It comes out perfect and has a nice crunch.  There is one other thing i would change next time.  I would not drain it.  It did drain off a lot of water but i found when i filled my jars i did not have enough juice to fill them all up and it left air pockets.  I have my fingers crossed that they will remain sealed.  Not that they will last long.  I am now customizing my family meals around this relish so i can use it more often!!

I love this recipe... although I had my doubts. I usually throw out the whole tomato bush, tomatoes and all, at the end of the season. Well, no more! This was easy, tasty and looks pretty in the jars. I have only ever canned jelly so the 30 min hot water bath thing was a bit much since I have no canning supplies. Just make sure your biggest jars fit in your biggest pot with plenty of room above it for water. Mine didn't and there were two jars that I could not process that are hanging out in the fridge. No matter, though, they won't last long!!
All I changed was that I added extra salt and a little more vinegar than called for. Tastes like sweet pickles, NOTHING like tomatoes, in case you are worried. Also, I had a variety of tomatoes: big, little, cherry. Some were green, some were a little orange, I think maybe a few red ones even snuck in. One thing I'd love to try is adding heat, like a hot pepper or red pepper flakes to zip it up even more. I'll let y'all know if I try it! YUM!

I first found and made this recipe in 2009 when we were going to have an early frost and my tomato plants were covered with green tomatoes -- including green cherry tomatoes, which I also added in.  I figured out that 24 large green tomatoes weigh approximately 13.5 lbs., so I factor that in when using different sizes.  The changes I made to this recipe are:  1)  I make this as a hot relish, adding 18-24 jalapeno peppers (remove the seeds for medium heat), 2) I use less sugar (~ 4 cups), and 3) I remove any seeds that can be removed quickly and easily from the tomatoes as I cut them up to put in my food processor, which helps reduce the time needed to drain the tomato mixture.  With these changes, I get anywhere from 15-17 pints.

absolutely delicious and easy to make.  Tip: save the liquid drained from the tomato, pepper and onion mixture and use it as a soup base.

My mother also made this for years. Now that she has passed
I make it and distribute some of it to my brothers. 
The recipe is made to use up whats left in the garden at 
the end of the growing season. I add about 6 to 8 cups of
ground cabbage also. I triple the recipe keeping the onion about
the same amount as this recipe shows. I don't like using a food processor it works to well. I like it not so finely ground up. But
I like it finer then store bought pickle relish though. If it
is to fine you lose alot when draining the water off it. I use a blender. You add water with vegetables about half and half. Works well. You don't have to be exact on your vegetable mix ratio. But keep the syrup ingredients ratio pretty close to the measurements given. Make sure your juice saturates the vegetable mixture top when in the jars. You need warm wet paper towels to keep jar rims clean of the sticky juice. If the rim is sticky it will not stay sealed for years but a month or maybe less. So check lids repeatedly before storing. I use it in potato salad, egg salad, tuna salad, on hot 
dogs. Macaroni salad and in deviled eggs.  Even people who said 
they don't like pickle relish love this. I think it's originally called chow chow many years ago. Good stuff!

My husband eats this by the spoonful at times!  We are both diabetic so instead of sugar I use a bit less than 5 cups of Splenda.  This relish is fabulous.  I have a grinder so this recipe goes easy. I'm about to make another batch.  This stuff gets gone fast! We can eat as much as we like as there is no sugar! Splenda works well for this unlike baking where you need a combo of it and sugar for best results.

Great tasting, and not too difficult. What a great use for my over abundance of green tomatoes. I made a half batch and used 2 cups of splenda in place of the sugar, came out perfect. I plan to make this again and give as gifts as well.

I really liked this but I made it with end of the garden tomatoes so I converted 24 large green tomatoes  (large is 7 oz minimum) x 24 =168 ounces, so 10 lbs and 8 ounces is correct amount of any size tomatoes.One cup of onion roughly chopped is 1 large onion.  I don't like recipes that are measured in "large, small" because of the room for variance!

I used green grape/cherry tomatoes. Wasn't sure whether celery seed was grey or large yellow type called French Celery Seed so used as much French Seed as I had & made up rest with grey one (labels referred to both as "whole"). I wanted lots of jars so added 4 c. of cabbage as in other recipes, which I put through the chopper.  I hand-chopped peppers though, and left sugar at 5 cups.  Don't do as I did putting vinegar, sugar and spices in pot & then dumping drained veggies on top an hour later - sugar was cemented to bottom.  Draining prevents lengthy boiling.  I cooked it until peppers turned lighter in colour - more than 5 min.  Was still somewhat watery & colourless so made a paste of 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 to 1 tsp. green food colouring and 1/2 c. vinegar (next time I will cut back on the original amount of vinegar by 1/2 c. to accommodate)and mix to a smooth paste.  Strain it into a 2 or 4 c. measuring cup, mashing it in strainer with spoon to remove any lumps, and add as much hot relish to fill cup, stirring constantly, then add very slowly back into the hot relish, stirring constantly until relish reboils and thickens ever so slightly.  Cook 5 minutes more. I am probably going to get into trouble for saying this next part but I never water process anything hot-packed because jars, lids and contents are already boiling and whenever I water process I have always had my seals burst & contents boil out.

Just like my favorite aunt use to make.  Great way to use up all the green tomato's left in the garden for a year-round treat.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

This is the best relish!  We get this from a relative as a Christmas present every year and we go through it so quickly, we can't wait for the next year to get another jar.  I have a large amount of end of season green tomatoes and I decided to look up the recipe to see if I could duplicate it, and this was a match.  We joked that this is so good we would eat it on ice cream!  I made half a recipe and didn't change a thing.  I found another reviewers suggestiong of adding water to the blender to help chop the tomatoes very helpful as I don't have a food processor.  I would add one cut up tomato (or pepper or onion) and just enough water to cover.  Pulse a few times until chopped to the consistency you want, then drain through a fine mesh strainer.  Then into the cheesecloth.  Thank you for the tips and for a wonderful recipe!!

Very nice, I accidentally forgot to add salt to the recipe so it was quite sweet. Also was unable to chop it coursely so it a little watery. Otherwise very nice. Alterations I would make another time: chop a little more coursely, remember salt, add a little less sugar and reduce the celery seeds. I used it in a chicken wrap (recipe also from this site) and was amazed at how much nicer it tasted as a result!

Well for me this became an early summer recipe after some "critter" ? rabbits ate off at the ground 8 of my 10 tomato plants. I could not stand the thought of losing my tomatoes so I went looking for a recipe and found this one. After reading all the reviews I subed 3  cups of splenda for the 5 of sugar. And I used 2 red, 2 yellow and 2 green peppers for a little more sweetness. Since the critter left my banana peppers I added 6 of those. My onions seemed strong so I cut back to 8 and I did not drain anything so I would have enough liquid per another review. The nice thing about this recipe is it taste great, is very adaptable, low in sodium and works with splenda so it can be enjoyed by those on special diets. I will use this recipe again.

Great tasting recipe...love this recipe to put to use all my green tomatoes..I would like to try and make this with larger slices of tomatoes, onions, and jalapeno peppers and no spices...so it will taste like a favorite catfish resturants relish that I just love.

I reduced the amount of sugar by half, and added table-spoon of powdered cumin with a tea spoon of ginger. Also I used onion salt instead of plain salt (or pickling salt). It made a great sweet and tangy relish. Super, great.

I give the recipe 5 stars, though with a couple of caveats and clarifications.  My one complaint is that the recipe quantities should be halved.  Yes, it's simple enough for somebody to divide everything by two themselves if they don't want the full recipe, but I blindly followed the recipe since I had plenty of green tomatoes that I needed to use.  Holy #$@^?!, what huge quantities this recipe produces!  I wound up having to split the recipe into two batches just to be able to fit it into my mixing bowls, colander, and stock pot.  But since this halving was done on the fly rather than in a planned manner, I'm sure that the proportions of ingredients in each of the two batches varied by quite a bit ("let's see  - that looks like about half of the tomatoes, and about half of the onions," etc., etc.).  Also - I had planned to use 4 cups of sugar instead of 5, only to realize that I only had 2 cups of sugar left in the pantry.  It still came out to be quite tasty and plenty sweet.  Had I used 5 cups of sugar, it's hard to imagine the result being anything short of sickenly sweet.  So in my personal view, it seems like the sugar dosage can be dropped substantially - with much less sugar it's quite tasty and much healthier.

An excellent recipe.  Beware, however, of filling jars to the top.  You must leave a small headspace for processing or the jars may leak or not seal.  I left about 1/8 inch.  The jars might seal before you can even get them into the processor with even this low headspace, but process them anyway or they will not be sterile.

Just a tiny bit bland. I added some crushed red pepper flakes and that kicked it up a notch.  Loved it otherwise!

I had over 175 green tomatoes and found this recipe to use up every last one of them! I did add some jalapenos to the second batch about 5 but it could use a little more for extra heat! I will def make sure that i do plant some tomato plants a little later in the spring to make sure i have green tomatoes to make this relish again! gave some away and in a week had people handing me empy jars for seconds!!! Thanks for sharing this with our family !

This was my first time making relish and it turned out wonderful. I ended up with about 7 litres of relish that I canned in 250ml jars for gift giving during the holidays :)  I would totally recommend this recipe to anyone looking to use up those green tomatoes.  The only change I would make, like other users have suggested, is lower the amount of sugar to 3 cups instead of 5.  Personal taste :)

Like others, i had lost this recipe and was so happy to find it here.  mine differs slightly, in that i use a bit of flour to thicken the sauce, and i use brown mustard seeds (great colour), and light brown sugar instead of white.  I also use a bit less sugar as others suggested.  a real keeper.

I used 3 cups of sugar instead of 5 and 1 1/2 cups of cider vinegar (because I ran out), but it was still delicious.  Highly recommended!

Excellent recipe! I read other reviews and saw some people did not drain theirs, so I compromised and drained some of the tomato liquid, but not all. I noticed it is still a bit runny so I will just drain it as I use it and it will be fine. :)

I give this relish 5 stars plus. I made this yesterday and my home smelt so good. The memories it brought back being at my grandmother's home was heart warming.
The great tangy taste is what I have been looking for in making my relishes.
Thank-you Linda for your wonderful recipe and the walk down memory lane.

This recipe is A +. I had about 30 lbs of green tomatoes at the end of last season, so I made the relish. I did add some banana peppers. It is delicious. Use it on burgers, hot dogs, or use 1 jar with olive oil mayo and leftover or canned chicken for a crazy easy and great chicken salad.

This is soooo yummy. I only made 1/4 of the recipe and it filled 8 half pint jars with a little left over to snack on. I did not have green pepper so I used red and yellow. The color is so pretty I plan to give jars of this along with other homemade treats to family and neighbors in gift baskets for Christmas.

Used this recipe yesterday, but used pablano and jalepeno in place off the green bell pepper. Used the red bell, for the color. Turned out wonderful, with just a little bit of bite. Great  recipe, thank you.

Thanks so much.  I was looking for an easy recipe.
I used to help my mother make the relish from our own garden of delicious veggies, too many years ago.  I did my own canning after getting married.  But the work world got me away from it.
Now I am retired and looking to settle back into it again.  I will let you know how I make out.

This was my first time making this relish.  I made one alteration and added some hot pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I probably didn't add enough but anyway, but flavor was great and everyone who tried it wanted more (even people who thought they didn't like relish)!  Great recipe!!

Fan-freaking-tastic recipe!  Made as written and the only change I'd make for me personally is probably a tad less celery seed, just because it's a fairly strong flavor.  Other than that it's delicious!

Amazing!! Everyone loved it! Even the oldest family members of our family. Said it was the best. I'd have to agree! However, I only came out with enough to fill 6 pint jars. I'm a first timer. Never canned before. I'm sure I made a mistake somewhere. But it still turned out incredible! Its our new favorite!

I've gotten so many people hooked on this recipe!  It is great and one of my "must put up every year".  My mother loves it with a little butter on toast - it's that good!

Wonderful relish. I ended up using less sugar as 5 cups would have been too much for our family. Lots of raves from those I gave this to. Also used  kumbucha vinegar instead of cider vinegar. Worked great. Will definately make again if I end up with green tomatoes.

This recipe rocks. This was my first time doing any sort of canning. I had a boat load of green tomatoes at the end of this year and decided to look online to see what I could do with them and found this recipe. Tried it and anyone and everyone who had tried it loves it.   Will definitely do this again next year. Why didn't anyone tell me canning was so much fun!!!! Enjoy!!

I used this recipe last year to use up our green tomatoes that did not ripen. And today I am going to use it again. So happy I found this recipe.  I use it as I would use any pickle relish I buy in the store. It makes great thousand island dressing.   I gave some of the canned jars away to friends  this summmer and it will make a great gift for someone special this Christmas.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

I couldn’t get celery seeds or mustard seeds by themselves, so I used a pickled gherkin packet mix that also had peppercorns, dill, and coriander in it.   Also, I followed the advice of other reviewers, and cut the amount of sugar by about 1/3rd. Glad I did, because it’s just about perfect now and I wouldn’t want it any sweeter.  I only made this yesterday and have already tried it with cheese on toast. It's REALLY good!

Nanna, my first hubbie's grandmother used to put up a big batch of this made with ripe tomatoes once a year. She called it homemade ketchup. The local Catfish Cafe in Shelbyville, TN. had this green tomato relish on the table for whatever you wanted to eat it with, YUM! My fav was fried catfish, white beans, this relish and hot cornbread.
Thanks so much for the recipe! I'm going to make it this way And try to make a  light version with a combo of sugar and Splenda. I'll let you know if the light version passes the taste test. Cajun Belle

This was a great recipe. It will become a great fall tradition to use up green tomatoes left in the garden before the first frost. We really enjoyed it, and it will make great gifts.

I made it! .One comment was the most helpful; she converted 24 tomatoes = 10 1/2lbs, so I weighed mine up. 27 of my enormous, average & small tomatoes = 10 1/2lbs. I'm so thankful someone figured this out! I used the food grinder attachment of my MixMaster, huge time saver! One jar out of 12-250ml & 3-500ml jars was 1/2 filled so used that for taste test. It's a bit dry, I might've drained veg too much, but is fantastic alongside eggs! I used 3c sugar vs 5c & so glad I read those comments, it would've been too sweet. It's the right amount of  sweet & tangy.

Quartered the recipe, filled 12 4 oz jars.  The only thing I changed was I used 6 banana peppers instead of red bell because that is what came from my garden.  Absolutely delish!

My 92 year old neighbor gave me a jar of this what he called his "hot dog relish".  Occassionally he'd ask me if I had tried it yet. Well, I finally did and WOW!Yesterday, we put up 6 jars just for me.  I had never had any relish except the store bought pickle relish.  The color of this is lovely, yellowy green with little dots of red.  I love this relish.  Oh, and we hot packed it after a 30 minute boil longer boil than called for in this recipe, didn't water bath it.  NOTHING will be able to grow in all that acid, lol.  He's 92 and healthy.

Thank you Linda very much for this delicious and easy recipe, it's super good, I finished a whole glass with hamburgers and seitan burgers, everybody liked it very very much. 
I come from Italy and I love italian food and I only look for recipe on italian websites, I had some cherry tomato in the garden that were completely green, I was looking on the most common italian cooking forum for some good recipe but none of them inspired me, so I looked on the english cookingforum I saw that your recipe had A LOT of excellents reviews and comments and I dared for the first time to cook it, and that's great, a good starting for allrecipes.com, I bookmarked it and I will try it again when it will occur,
Thank you again!
ciao

absolutely perfect! The whole family loves it. I didn´t have any celery seeds, so put in coriander seeds instead, which works really well. I also put a little mild chili in.

Mix this relish in a little cream cheese, with or without a touch of horseradish.  It's the perfect dip!

This year was a bumper crop of tomatoes and green peppers for me; unfortunately, while my hubby and I were gone to New Mexico for 3 weeks, Wisconsin had freezing temps and snow!! So, I ended up using freeze-damaged green and red tomatoes as well as freeze-damaged green peppers. I added a few "extras" such as garlic piece, pickling spice, dill seed, cayenne pepper, and black peppercorns to the mixture. Wow!! This relish is fantastic! I'm ecstatic because I hated to see all of that garden produce going to waste. As for Laura not hot-water-bath processing, I don't always do that either. As my mom always said, the acid in the vinegar helps to prevent spoilage. She was a successful canner for more years than I can count. Happy eating and gift-giving to me!!

Made this last fall with our leftover garden tomatoes and it turned out fabulous. Everyone who got a jar couldn't stop raving about it. Thanks so much!

This was my first adventure in canning and I couldn't be happier with the way it turned out.  My only regret is that I didn't have more green tomatoes so I could make a second batch!

Great use of those late season green tomatoes.  
I altered recipe a bit.  
I used 24 Sweet & 12 Hot Bannana Pepper in place of Green Bell Pepper.  
I used 1 Orange & 2 Red Bell Pepper for more color. (next time prob. dbl each) 
4 Cups Sugar & 4 Med-Large Cloves of Garlic & No Salt at all. 
I Split Qty of Onions between white & Yellow.  
Next time I will probably reduce Celery Seed by 1/3. I'm not a big fan of Celery.

Our growing season was about 6 weeks late here in Colorado this year which left us with a lot of green tomatoes.  This recipe is fantastic!

I'll probably be making another batch of this stuff since there's 8 people in my family and they all love it. I'm sure it won't last long with my crowd especially with 5 of my 6 children being boys and always ready to eat! Very easy to make and goes great with many dishes. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Really loved this recipe, so much I made two batches.  One of them with some hot peppers.  My Mom would make this, but through the years the recipe was lost.  I had so many green tomato's this year due to weird weather, so I put them all to good use.

My mother has made a very similar recipe for decades,but her recipe is at least 100 years old so there are differences as food processors were not available.  To make this recipe use equal parts tomatoes, peppers an onions rather than LG tomatoes.  Another big difference is we use golf ball size tomatoes at the end of the garden season, for two reasons.  1 small green tomatoes have very tiny seeds an 2. Small tomatoes have very little water as opposed to larger tomatoes.

Wonderful condiment. Watching the associated video is extremely helpful, particularly regarding tomato quantities. 6lbs is what you should be looking for.

Also, I started with 12 large onions but it seemed like waaaaay too much so I ended up using only about 8 or 9 of them. I think large is too relative a term so I just went with what looked right. Otherwise it is delicious and relatively easy to make.

Wonderful recipe I make again and again.  For those asking, l large tomato = about 1 1/2 cups grated.  Wonderful way to use up green tomatoes.  We  also love it mixed in tuna as well as burgers, hot dogs,  etc.    I put extra onions in and give jars of this in my Christmas gift baskets.

I used 2 cups, instead of 5 cups of sugar.  And since we love spice, I added a few jalapenos, as well.  YUMMY!

I'm not a big fan of relish, but THIS relish is wonderful!  I did take some ideas from other reviewers and cut the sugar down to four cups and cut the celery seed down to two tablespoons but I honestly think it would have tasted just as good if I hadn't.  This recipe is a keeper!

I had an over abundance of green roma tomatoes last fall, so tried this recipe. I loved how it turned out and only put half the amount of sugar it called for. I am going to try substituting zucchini instead of tomato and will hope for the best. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I make a very similar recipe, but it also uses green cabbage and it sets in a sprinkling of salt for a few hours or overnight and rinsed and drained before cooking and canning.  Our family used this on burgers and in our tuna fish or for making tartar sauce.  It's a great way to use up the leftovers from the garden...

At last! Something to do with all those extra green tomatoes. Since this recipe is rather large, I cut the recipe in half and used my largest cooking pot. This made 7 pint jars, which filled up my canner. I followed the suggestion of others and cut the sugar down to 3 cups (1 1/2 for my recipe). It is hard to judge the amount of green tomatoes that goes into this, as the tomatoes vary in size. So, it is just guesswork. But it tastes really good. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This is absolutely fantabulous!  I've been making this for several years and it never fails me.  Great way to use up the last of the seasons tomatoes that don't make it to the ripe stage.  Always have this on hand and it does come in handy (no pun intended) for an impromptu hostess gift or for holiday gift giving.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe that I hope to never be without!

Fantastic recipe!  So simple, yet completely wonderful!  I added a single cleaned jalapeno pepper to the vegetable mix for a little bite... but otherwise was true to the original recipe.  

Thank you so much!  A keeper, for sure!

I just made this recipe this afternoon.  It came out great.  Next time I may use Splenda granulated instead of sugar, because my husband is a diabetic. I never heard of this relish, until a friend told me about this recipe she liked so much.

My tomato plants starting dying early this year, so I picked the green ones off and decided to made this.  This stuff is awesome!  I made as directed, except reducing sugar to 3 1/2 cups and adding 3 jalpeno peppers.  Next time I might use 4 cups sugar.  I also did not drain for 1 hour.  I lined a strainer with cheese cloth and just squeezed and squeezed and dumped into my pot and added my ingredients.  Just the right amount of liquid.  I got 12 pint jars.  The best relish I have ever made.  I can't wait to make more.

Living in Wisconsin we don't always get a chance for our produce to ripen before the weather turns.  This recipe is a great way for me to use all of my green tomatoes that I didn't want to waste!!  Thanks so much Linda!!!

Made this while my DH was bowling.  I'm allergic to onions, so couldn't even taste it.  He tried it when he got home and immediately wanted to fix hot dogs.  Said this is the best he ever tasted.  This is definately a keeper.  Canned 5 pints.  Still have some green tomatoes left in the garden, so will be making more.  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my! simply heaven on earth!  I live in the Adirondacks NY, and to say that we have an early frost is no exaggeration!  Now I will ALWAYS have a yummy reason not to mourn an early end to another growing season!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I added a bit of cumin and garam marsala to this recipe, which gave it a slightly exotic flavour.  Great recipe, highly recommend for relish lovers.

I threw in some cayenne pepper on the second batch and it added a nice flavor kick. Great on hot dogs and black eyed peas.

Brilliant! This will be added to my usual canning schedule.  Though I used considerably more green tomatoes (at least forty) and reduced the number of onions to nine, I still put up eighteen half-pint jars. Great in tuna, chicken, or pasta salads.

Just wondering the quantities of ingredients to make the original batch of 12 pints. 

My Mom made this type if relish when I was a kid, never liked it much then, but I've grown up now.  Great to find this recipe.

Thanx VJ

This recipe turned out alot better than I was expecting considering that this was the first time I ever made relish of any kind.  Unfortunately, I'm the only one in the family that will eat it.  I think next time I'll scale down the recipe so I'm not left with a ton or relish to eat :)

The frost came early so I had a lot of tomatoes I rescued in various stages of ripeness. I added a few jalapeños (red) too and I also substituted brown sugar. Extremely tasty but a very slightly bitter aftertaste. Since it was difficult to estimate the volume of my tomatoes in terms of the recipe’s large tomatoes (various sizes from cherry to large) I may have underdone the sugar. Will definitely make it again!

I made this delicious relish with the over abundance of green tomatoes we were left with at the end of the growing season.  The only changes I made was to decrease  the sugar to equal the vinegar, and added some turmeric.  It was really good.  I want to thank the reviewer with the suggestion of adding to beans.  I made a bean medley salad with a heavy dose of this relish and all loved it!!

A great way to use up green tomatoes! I used 3 cups of sugar and it was definitely sweet enough for my taste. I added some black pepper to give a bit more flavour. Next time I could see adding a bit of cumin and/or using yellow sugar for good variations. Goes well with hot banana peppers.

I really appreciate the basics of making the green tomato relish, but wow it had wayyyy too much sugar. We used an eighth of sugar the recipe called for, doubled the apple cider vinegar, and probably quadrupled (if not more!) the salt content! So tasty!

I had a lot of green tomatoes in our garden so found this recipe but was hesitant to try it as the tomatoes seem weird in a sweet relish, but it is great!  We use a lot of sweet relish on hot dogs or to make tuna salad or tartar sauce. This will work great for any of those plus it’s great all by itself. Not as sweet as pickle relish but that’s not a bad thing. Now I have relish for the whole year with no artificial ingredients! Try this you will not be disappointed. By the way trying to figure out how many tomatoes to use is difficult as it just says 25 large tomatoes. I weighed one large tomato and then figured I needed about 12 pounds and I got just a little over 12 pints so 12 pounds is about the right amount.

This is what I remember from my childhood on ham and beans with sweet cornbread!  Yum.  For half the batch we added a few hot peppers.  Mom didn't add peppers, but they are now my favorite of the two.

It simply doesn't get any better than this- everyone in my family loved it, even when they were hesitant about green tomatoes!  Because I had so many tomatoes, it did become very time-intensive to food-process the tomatoes after coring them.  Then came the other veggies, so I never left the kitchen for most of the day.  The end result was worth it, however, and it is just as attractive in the jar as it is delicious to eat.  Thanks for a true "winner".

I used splenda  as my added sweet and it did fine. People request this relish and I make batches at the beginning and end of each growing season.

Made two batches. First batch used food processor and did not like the texture. Tasted great though. Second batch got a 3/8" chop. Added can of whole kernel corn and added one more (3 total) red pepper and used only one green pepper. Tasted fantastic. Thank you for the recipe as I always had some spoilage of green tomatoes at year-end.

Being that this was the first time I made green tomato relish or any relish, I watched the video and read the reviews/tips. I halved the recipe and it came out great and six pints exactly.  What would have been helpful as a newbie would be to add measurements for the tomatoes, peppers and onions.  I made my own notes as I went along and hoped for the best.  Could not have turned out better!
Now I know why this recipe continues to get a five star rating.

I loved this for ease of preparation and the wonderful smell as it cooks... and that's before eating it!  One question I have is the timing of the hot water bath. 30 minutes seems long when most similar  recipes are 10 minutes, even with cabbage in the mix.  Does omission of a salting step increase the needed processing time?  Or is this a case of just taking no chance of spoilage? Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!

Great way to use green tomatoes.  I cut the recipe in half and added some dried red pepper flakes.  Great on hamburgers and am going to try it on ham sandwiches.

This is one of the best green tomato relishes I've made, and over the years we have made quite a few.  This has a lot of flavor and not too sweet.

I was so happy to find a use for my green tomatoes and be able to can this relish!  And I don't have a food processor and found one member's very helpful tip to fill the blender 3/4 with water and grind up the tomatoes and onions that way.  They came out perfect.

Okay, I have to be fair here-I see that the original recipe yield was 12 pints.  I planned to make 1/3 recipe but because of not knowing how big a large tomato was I used too many tomatoes and ended up with 7 pints.  I agree with those who said it tasted good mixed with cream cheese for a dip on chips or crackers. It is very similar to Harry & David's red pepper and onion relish recipe which my family loves.  I will gladly use it that way.

This is excellent, and a simple way to use up green tomatoes.  We use the relish on everything, from hot dogs to meat loaf.  I will make more next year, for sure.

i made this because I had a bunch of green tomatoes and had nothing to do with them. I gave a few jars away and people started raving about it. Then i tried it on a hotdog and was amazed at how good it was. I have one friend who will call to see if I have any chores he could do for me, he only wants paid in Green Tomato Relish!

My food processor ground the ingredients to a finer texture than the original recipe photo, but we actually liked it better that way.  This relish is sweeter than I expected, so next batch I am planning to replace some of the sweet peppers with jalapeños to kick up the heat.  The recipe also made more than it indicated.  Not only does this relish have a fantastic flavor, it is very easy to make. I put this in small decorative canning jars to give as gifts when we have guests at the farm. Now, they are spoiled and ask for a jar every visit!   --ChicksRUs

This was very easy and very tasty--I was pleasantly surprised by how crunchy it turned out.  Nice texture!

For the peppers I used a mixture of yellow and green peppers and some red Portugal Hot peppers (that was what the garden was offering!).  I also added a bit more salt, a bit of allspice and clove for flavour, some turmeric and green food colouring, and some liquid pectin for some extra body (worked great).

This relish is delicious! I picked the last of the green tomatoes for the season and over half went into this recipe. Doing it again next year!

Tasty way to use some of those green tomatoes left on the vine.  Will make it again next year.

This recipe is FABULOUS.  Reminds me of the relish my grandmother used to make.  I chop everything in the food processor and it makes it so easy!  This year I had such a bumper crop of tomatoes that mid-season I pulled off enough green tomatoes for a 1/2 batch to give myself a "red tomato" break!  My kids love to get this in their "Christmas Goodie Basket"!

I lost this recipe years ago. Really glad to have it again. It is as good as it gets and SO much better than the commercial "relish" one finds.

My sons use this like salsa on tortilla chips, I add some to tuna salad. Mine turned out a bit too liquidy - probably my fault, not the recipe.

This recipe is just like my mom used to make!  It's awesome!  I only made 1/2 of a batch, but will make a full batch next year.  I shared the finished product with a co-worker and she will also be making this next year.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and cut back on the sugar.  It was still plenty sweet.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very easy but just tasted a little off to me. Not sure what was missing. However, it's a good basic recipe that I will use again and tweak to my taste!
