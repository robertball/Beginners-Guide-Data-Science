Excellent and easy.  I did not use milk in the recipe.  One tip if the eggs curdle, use very hot water and add a little bit at time till the sauce smooths out.  Perfect sauce very time!

YUMMM! Will be my automatic go-to. I served atop Chicken Cordon Bleu and asparagus at a dinner party...we all loved it! I had chicken broth ready, so when it needed some smoothing, a few teaspoons did wonders.

I tried this and it was just ok.  I went and looked at my standard recipe and tried again.  I left out the milk and added  1tsp of dried mustard (i think colman's is the best)  be sure to take it out ever 15 mins to stir,   i just a small wire whisk or use a fork be sure not to put metal utensil in microwave.  Delicious!! especially on asparagus!!

So good! Needed a hollandaise that my 16 year old could make while I was poaching eggs for Eggs Benedict. She made this perfectly! Great consistency and taste! It was her first time having Eggs Benedict and she is in  love!My only suggestion is to cut the lemon juice some. It was a little tangy.

Not a 5 star recipe, but defiantly a 5 star cooking technique !!! Increase egg yokes to 3, use white pepper (to taste), use lemon juice to taste. As one reviewer already mentioned, if yokes start to set or curdle, whisk in 1 teaspoon boiling water at a time until sauce becomes creamy smooth & thick. (works every time)

Okay, I use allrecipes.com (or the app) for almost everything I try for the first time, but I’m bad for leaving a review.  Sooo I’m writing a review because I surely didn’t expect something so easy to be so good - especially with the side note of making it savoury by switching up red wine vinegar for the lemon juice.  Wow - just delicious and soooo fast.  We usually use the package stuff, but we were out so I’m very glad I tried this!  Thank you!  I only need 3 x 15 seconds for it to set btw.

I made this exactly as recipe called for. It is AWESOME!!!  This is embarrassing to admit but there was leftover sauce and I couldn't stop tasting it and ended up drinking what was left.  This is my favorite sauce but always avoided making it from scratch because it's very time consuming. But this is the answer to a delishious hollandaise,  it's quick and you won't be sorry about the taste. I made it for my daughter when she was home for Christmas and she copied the recipe and took it home with her.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  Diana~

Amazing! Absolutely perfect, can be done every day or weekend. I’m never paying for the eggs Benedict at a restaurant again! Followed the recipe exactly except i had to microwave butter for 1.5 minutes, that’s how long it took to melt.

Quick, easy, and delicious! But it does take more than 1minute to thicken. About a minute and a half. My new go-to hollandaise recipe.

Wow, this was yummy! All of a sudden I started craving eggs Benedict but wasn't in the mood to fuss with the hollandaise sauce. This recipe looked super quick and easy, so I tried it and I'm so glad I did! I used vanilla soy milk in replace of milk because I was out of regular milk. I also need to remember that with the last step 30 seconds on our low wattage microwave is perfect. 45 seconds was a little too long.

I rarely order anything with hollandaise sauce and never make it. Keeping that in mind, I really like this sauce. It adds a layer of flavor that really amps up the regular old poached egg on toast.   It's very easy to make; however, I must have cooked the first batch I made too long because it broke down. So once it starts to thicken, either use it or continue cooking it for less than 15 seconds at a time until it's the thickness you like.

Perfect as is! I’ve used a few other recipes and this one is great and the easiest to follow. It didn’t specify salted or unsalted butter so I used salted and just added a pinch of salt.

Wow! So easy! I make Eggs Benedict for Christmas breakfast and usually hate making the sauce. But this was so easy and tasty! I didn’t add the milk (not usually in it). Had no problem with curdling and it was just so easy!! I will be using this every year!

I doubled the egg yolks and lemon, and skipped the milk. It curdled, even cooking at 30% power for 15 second bursts, so I also added a tablespoon of boiling water to smooth out the sauce. It was slightly runny but had good flavor. Definitely a great option when wanting a quick version, but not as good as the traditional sauce.

My first time making this.  Tasted better on the eggs than when I taste tested it.  It wasn’t as thick as I expected.  I will add a bit more lemon juice next time.

Made according to the recipe, it turned out fine. Next go around I’ll adjust for our taste. If you need a quick and easy hollandaise, this fits the bill.

I thought this was a good easy sauce. I think I will add a little more lemon or even hot sauce for extra flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

Great, easy recipe. Used vinegar in place of lemon. Ran out. But the assembly was so simple. I only made a half recipe, good for four egg/muffins of eggs Benedict.  Only needed two cycles in the microwave. 15 sec at 50% and 10 sec at 40%. My microwave is freakishly strong for a compact unit. Tasted spot on and the texture was perfect

This sauce is simply amazing. Easy to prepare. I have made it at work in the microwave and enjoyed eggs Benedict. Enjoy this recipe as is or alter it to your taste. Thank you for sharing this “awesome sauce”!

So good!  If you can separate an egg, you can make great hollandaise!

Easy breezy... I find the key is whisking fast and often to keep it from separating.

I didn't like the taste. Actually, it was tasteless except for the lemon.

This recipe was easy and straightforward.  Didn't have lemons, but used lime juice to good effect.  I will definitely make this again.

This sauce was good, but not my favorite. I'm not really a huge fan of the tanginess. That being said, I would probably use less lemon juice next time.

I did not care for this recipe. The instructions are so vague it didn't turn out.
