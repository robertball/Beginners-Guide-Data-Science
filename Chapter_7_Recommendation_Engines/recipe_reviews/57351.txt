These tasted really good. However, I do have some suggestions. #1 I would use cresent rolls. #2 I would use atleast 2 lil smokies per cresent. I just got finished eating these and found myself peeling away all the extra buiscut and just eating the middle where the lil smokie was. Even though it was not difficult to construct with the biscuit dough, I tried several methods of pinching and rolling them closed. Most opened up atleast partially during the cooking process. The cresent roll would probably be better presentation wise.

Really good. My only change was to use reduced fat crescent rolls instead of biscuits. I made a little assembly line of ingredients and the process was quicker and easier.  Worth the efforts. Family and friends ate the up. Bbq sauce and the lil smokie goes hand in hand. Great lil appy. Thanks!

If you place the Lil' Smokies and the cheese in the middle, roll them up and cook them without the sauce, they make less of a mess and you can serve the sauce on the side to dip......because who doesn't like to dip? This is also good if you roll them up in crescent roll dough and make a sauce of half BBQ sauce, half grape juice.

#1 I knew I wanted something more than cocktail wieners. I used Johnsonville Cheddar & Jalopeno Sausage.  Heated the sausage covered with water in a sauce pan for 10 minutes over medium heat to cook out a good bit of the far. Cut each sausage into 3 pcs. Used Pillsbury Crescent rolls. Spread 1/2 tsp of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on the roll.( tsp will run out all over the place) Next added 1/2 slice of Sargentos Pepper Jack on the roll. Then rolled up a piece of sausage in the roll Bake for 9-10 minutes at 375.(400 is too much for the rolls  . .look at the container) Tastiest game treat I have ever made. The BBQ sauce mellowed out the peppers. Much . . much tastier than a wiener.

Tasty but the timing is off on cooking...my one batch especially turned out a little charred on the bottom.  Hubby's lodge buddies loved this and it will be something I'll try again!

Great twist on pigs in a blanket. I used one can of crescent rolls (didn't have buscuits, and really needed to use up the crescents.) I made a basic bbq sauce from this site. I also used two lil smokies inside each crescent. Hmm Hmm good. Thanks for the recipe.

This was rather good and the kids loved them! The only thing is I wasn't sure if they were suppose to be completely sealed in the biscuit  or if the ends were suppose to stick out! VERY GOOD !
