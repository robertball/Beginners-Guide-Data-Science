The last time I had these was about 53 years ago on Christmas Eve and I never forgot the taste. This recipe brought back many great memories and was Exactly the taste I remembered.

I had several people exclaim that it was a tasty ginger cookie. I agree the simple frosting is the best complement to it. With the mix of spices and chocolate, I thought it was like indulging in a cup of Mexican chocolate.

Just like my Grandma used to make! Same recipe! My favorite cookies in the world! The tip is correct for the frosting. If you want it heavier use more confectioners sugar. I could have used more but didnâ€™t see the tip until after. The way I made it was to the T as instructions indicated and it is still very good!! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with everyone

This recipe is delicious.  It is more of a ginger cookie than a chocolate cookie. I will tinker with the ingredient the next time I make them.
