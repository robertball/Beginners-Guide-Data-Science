I was bummed by this recipe. I made the vegetable/shrimp mixture while my pasta was boiling, and it smelled and tasted so yummy! Then I added a full pound of pasta, and it was way too much. I strongly recommend only using 8 oz of pasta. I love this idea, though!

I really liked this.... for both the flavor and the ease and speed of the preparation.  I love onions and use them in pretty much everything, so I added about 1/3 cup of chopped onion (when I added the anchovy).  I also used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes and used 8 oz of whole wheat thin spaghetti, as there would be way too much pasta if you add a whole box.  I think I will add some fresh mushrooms next time as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a delicious dish.  I didn't have anchovies, so I in place of that salty item, I used chopped green olives.  They played nicely with the flavors!  I also used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh and it worked out really well.  Thanks!

This is a very nice combination of flavors and definitely one I will try again but with the following changes: replace bucatini with pennete or fettucini and use less of it (I like a much better sauce to pasta ratio), add about 8 oz of tomato sauce to give the sauce some thickness but not too much more salt.  Thank you for a great idea.

SO SO GOOD! I used 1 zucchini and 1 yellow summer squash. I used one large tomato, then added a can of diced tomatoes (drained). I also added some sliced squid, which gave the dish another texture. Overall, absolutely delicious! You must not leave out the anchovies and anchovy oil. They make the dish! Didn't use the recommended Bucatini but rather salad macaroni, which is the same as bucatini only cut up into tiny pieces. Simply delicious!

I decreased the recipe for one person and I LOVED it!  I used 1/2 cup sliced zucchini and 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes.  I also used whole wheat penne pasta to decrease the calories which also resulted in 1/2 cup when cooked.  I couldn't taste the anchovies which I love so next time I will use more than three anchovies.  Make this recipe without making any changes first; you won't be disappointed.  Will definitely make again!

Great dish with great flavor.  I substitued the zucchini with yellow and orange peppers since my boyfriend will not eat zucchini.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of grape because its what I had, and I think it helped give it more of a "sauce"  If your worried about the anchovies, just make sure to chop them up really fine...my boyfriend didnt even know they were there!

What a disappointment.  I was so excited when I looked at the ingredients.  I had beautiful shrimp.  My family said, "Definitely not a repeater."  One of those recipes that looks pretty but has no follow through.

This was an awesome recipe.  Good flavor from the fresh veg and depth from the anchovies.  Definitely a keeper.  I had garden fresh heirloom tomatoes so I subbed those for the grape tomatoes.  I also slightly varied the preparation wherein I sauteed the shrimp ever so lightly in the anchovy garlic and then removed them from the pan picking up the instructions with the zucchini and then tomatoes.  Tossed in the mostly cooked shrimp at the very end to keep them from becoming overdone.  My tasters say that this is a keeper.

This was good, but I couldn't hardly tell that this had anchovies in it. I even cut the amount of pasta called for in half.

The only changes that I made were to use compari tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes and fresh herbs. I'm not a huge fan of anchovies, but they were not too over powering in this, which I liked. My Italian husband loved this! He had been asking for bucatini pasta for awhile now, and I happened to find it at Target (from Barilla's Collezione collection).  Tasty dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved it. I was able to use fresh tomatoes, zucchini, and basil from my garden. The only thing I changed was I added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I will definitely make again!

Fabulous.  I substituted frozen green, red, yellow peppers and onions for the zucchini and drained diced tomatoes for the grape tomatoes to use what I had in the freezer. The flavors of the seasonings with the anchovies were superb. I can easily recommend this recipe!

This was a great dish! I made it exactly as written, using just over a pound of 26-30 count shrimp. I'd never even heard of bucatini, but I managed to find it in the second grocery store I checked. The flavors were great, and I liked the variety of ingredients. The only thing that really seemed "off" to me was the pasta itself. It just seemed unwieldy here, for lack of a better word. Since there was hardly any sauce to speak of, it just didn't mix well with the rest of the ingredients. Maybe a smaller pasta, like penne rigate, would be more suitable, in my opinion. But that's a minor complaint, and I'll give this a 5-star rating anyway. I enjoyed this a lot, and highly recommend it.
