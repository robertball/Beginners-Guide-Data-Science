Very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly and came out very good.  The garlic and ginger give it a little kick.  My kids thought the sauce looked a little funny (applesauce texture), but it did help keep the chops moist ( I spread some on top of chops also).  I made baked spiced apples and spooned over the finished chops-made presentation nicer.  Great fall meal!  Thanks!

These were great. I didn't have regular apple sauce so I used the cinnamon apple sauce and it came out perfect. Very tender and juicy.

I made this and it came out wonderful. If you are a fan of pork chops w/applesauce, it's nice because it fills that need with a little something extra as far as flavor. Will definitely make again. tks for a keeper!

First Allrecipes review I've submitted as it's the first one that I'll definitely make again.  I'm a tough grader so I only gave it four stars but it turned out five star (maybe six) with some tweaking.  Didn't have ground ginger so I used a pinch of pumpkin pie spice.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.   Following previous reviewers hints I seasoned the chops liberally before browning.  I was not in my own kitchen so I winged it with what was available.  A pinch each of seasoned salt, curry powder, cumin and black pepper.  Rubbed it into the chops and let them sit for twenty minutes.  Sauteed them in hot olive oil until they were very brown, removed them and then added a couple of Tbsp. of butter and half a chopped sweet onion.  When the onion had sweated and started to caramilize after a few minutes over pretty high heat it's moisture had deglazed the fried pork bits and I poured it all into the applesauce mixture.  Laid half the applesauce mixture into the baking dish, added the pork chops and then added the rest of the applesauce on top.  It was absolutely delicious.  I believe the combination of the sauteed onion deglazing the browned, amply seasoned chops was what made this recipe really work and forget about the sugar as it's not needed.  I think you could use some different spices and seasonings in the rub and/or sauce and the sky is the limit.  Thanks for a great idea.

My family thought this was very good. Just as the original poster said, it was a great way to use up some applesauce I had lying around, and it smelled great while it was cooking. Made this as described except double the sauce and cooked the pork in part of it and poured the rest of the sauce on the pork pieces to bake. Very yummy!

Love this quick weeknight recipe. The only thing I would change is omitting the added sugar because applesause has a lot of sugar in it already.

WOW didn't change a thing and this was a delicious recipe and so easy to make!  I have tried other pork/apple dishes on this site, but this one is the best.  Really great with sauce over brown rice.

I didn't care for the consistency of the sauce and the taste wasn't that great.I think I would like this better if apple juice or cider were used instead of applesauce, and not quite so much salty ingredients. They didn't seem to improve anything

I loved the flavor of these pork chops, and I was especially pleased with how tender they were.  I omitted the sugar like many others suggested.  This one's definitely a keeper!

Easy to make and tasty.  The key to this recipe is the preparation of the pork chops.  For me, the browner the better.  Although the recipe does not call for seasoning the meat, this should be done with whatever savory blend you like.  If not, the outcome seems too sweet for a main dish.

These turned out really good.  I used Mott's Original Applesauce, and made Roasted Garlic Mashed potatoes to go with it.  My daughter put the sauce on her mashed potatoes and thought they were great.

Pork chops were very moist.  I liked the sauce but he didn't... Probably could've used a little more heat... chili powered or red pepper flakes

I made this last night and it was great. My wife and sister were skeptical because of the appesauce and because they are very picky, but as soon as they took a bite they enjoyed every last piece of this recipe lol.

This was just okay for us. May or may not make it again. It had an odd taste from the soy sauce. Something to work with and may change it up some and try again.

OK, the ingredients did put me off at first, but I wanted a new recipe, so I tried it, and boy, am I glad I did.  Super easy, super quick, and super tasty.  I love pork chops and apple sauce together, but this gave it something a little extra.  The family all loved it too.

This was very tasty. I didn't have applesauce, but I did have two apples, so I made a quick applesauce similiar to one from this site (unpeeled diced apples, splash or two of apple juice, cinnamon, clove, dash salt, Tbsp brown sugar, and a splash of lemon juice added- after cooking covered 10 minutes or so). I mashed them a bit with a potato masher, then added the rest of the ingredients. Substituted brown sugar and reduced the amount, and baked for only 20 minutes. The sauce is subtly sweet and the garlic flavor really stands out. The chops are juicy, and the dish isn't overly salty despite adding salt and pepper during the browning process. This is now a favorite. Thank you!

I didn't make these in the oven, I used a crock pot. I just like how tender the meat comes out in it. I used garlic powder instead of minced, and omitted the butter, as I didn't brown the meat first, just simmered in the crock pot. I also added a little cinnamon to the sauce. These were even better the next day, as they seemed to soak up the flavors even more. My mom absolutely loved them, and she isn't a pork eater!! Thanks Amy for the recipe!

Who knew such a simple dish could be so yummy.  Since I didn't have applesauce in the house, but had apples, I made the applesauce from scratch - no sugar.  My husband raved about the dish, then took leftovers to lunch the next day.  Enjoy.

Ok so this was pretty good...a bit too sweet so I'll marinade the meat in something else to balance it out as suggested in the reviews. I enjoyed the sauce, but my hubby was not a huge fan of the mixture. I'll probably make this again with only some slight alterations to the meat, not the sauce, the sauce was yum!

Good, not great...I'll try again with 1/2 cup less applesauce as it became very watery.I will also omit the sugar as I agree with others that it's not needed. Company ate it & no one commented or asked for the recipe. That to me is very telling if people ask for it, the recipe should get 5 stars, if not it loses one. If it needs modification it also loses a star.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it is consistently delicious.  Served with steamed veggies and rolls, this sweet and tasty pork chop is easy and quick to prepare.

Wonderful! Used some apple butter, and that was nice. Seasoned meat while on the stove. A keeper!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was pretty good. I liked the sauce better then plain applesauce and it was very easy to make.

A nice fall-style recipe. Good for a fall/Halloween dinner. The ginger is strong in the sauce, so you don't want to eat bites covered in sauce. If you like applesauce on your pork but want a little more, this is a good way to spice it up.

I loved this, however my husband HATED it.  I didn't add any additional sugar, since I used homemade applesauce that I canned myself and I think that had plenty of sugar in it.  Very delicious, but like I said before, my hubby doesn't like applesauce with his porkchops...I'm sure I'll make this again sometime, but it'll have to be when he's not home...Thanks for a great recipe!
