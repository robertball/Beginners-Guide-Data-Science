My mother used to make these all the time.  She would press the cake batter into a large cookie sheet to thin out the cake part and then pour the cream cheese topping on top.  It lessens the cooking time a bit, but they come out super moist and more like bars or brownies.  Great recipe!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made this three times in the last month and always get rave reviews.  One helpful hint - I find the cake part of this hard to stir, so the last time I made it I used a potato masher to mix it up and it made the stirring a lot easier!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This cake is unbelieveable! My grandmother used to buy pies from the grocery bakery. She called them Chess pies, I would die for them. I never got the recipe because they were "fattening" Once in a while I'd buy them when I got older, but always thought they would be hard to make. When I saw this recipe I thought how easy, and mabe it'll taste like the pie. OMG!, it's lovely tastes like the pies my Gma used to buy. I took it out of the oven, and only let it cool 10 min before I tasted it. My hubby and son couldn't beleive their taste buds! I will be making this, and I've already thought of other cake mixes to use in it. (I like experimenting)

This is a great cake. I have made a variation of this recipe many times. One tip to mix the cake more easily is to mix with your hands. Use gloves. You may want to try a cup of pecans in the cake mix. You may also try a differnt flavor cake mix. (german chocolate cake mix with pecans and coconut drizzle with melted german chocolate bar).

This recipe is great.. my husband tried to eat it straight from the oven. It doesnt make it very long at my house.
I add some vanilla to the cream cheese mix..just a special little touch.

This is really good!  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cream cheese part.  It turned out very, very sweet- probably the sweetest dessert I've ever made.  You could cut back on the sugar to 3 or even 2 cups.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect with this recipe and was expecting something more cakey.  It ended up like a bar.  The texture of the crust part and the filling part is actually very reminescent of lemon bars.  The crust part is kind of chewy (particularly the edges and if it's cold) and the filling part (which does not taste like cream cheese to us) is gooey.  So if you like chewy and gooey, make these for sure, but if you don't, stay away!

This is the very best Chess Cake recipe.  My kids loved it when they were small and now I have too make it for my grandkids at Christmas every year.  I sprinkle some chocolate chips before baking and that dresses it up some.  My son doesn't like pecans so I only add those to half of it before baking.  I'm sure you could add othr flavors of chips and other types of nuts or whatever your imagination could come up with.

I baked this recipe for 45 minutes and it still didn't get done, it was really gooey.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I will try it again, but bake it in a jelly roll pan.  I am open to any suggestions, as this recipe is simple and sounded very good.

This is a combo rating: 5 for how easy and quick it is, 3 for how overly sweet it is. We all enjoyed it, but WOW is it sweet. I'd definitely cut back on the sugar next time. Followed the recipe exactly and baked as stated and I loved the way it came out, texture was great.  The custard consistency reminded my husband of lemon bars, so he felt some flavor was missing, but he still had seconds and couldn't stop nibbling :)

The whole family loved this dessert! I used a lemon cake mix rather then yellow and it added a great summery flavor. I will be making this again and trying different flavors. I am glad I cut the bars small as they are very rich - but you can always have two!

This cake is awesome. My husband, who usually just eats a little dessert after dinner, enjoyed some later in the evening and awoke to have some for breakfast the next morning.

I received this recipe from a friend years ago and gets many many compliments and recipe requests when I make it. The base layer is very stiff, not at all like cake batter. I've found it's easier to dive in with my hands to mix it than to try and use a spoon. I cut it into small (small because it's very rich) squares...great for parties!

I made cupcakes instead of a cake as I only have a toaster oven.  I used 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of the cake mix in the paper cup and topped with 1 heaping tablespoon of the topping.  I used just 1 box of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract with the cream cheese and eggs for the topping.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Ssssoooo good.

i dont understand the rave reviews. i made the yellow cake "mix" from scratch... and followed the rest of the directions as written. (used 3.75 cups confectioner's sugar instead of 4... just because thats what 1 box equals) in any case, it was a pain to stir the base layer, and even worse to try and keep it down without it sticking to your hands. the top layer is way too eggy and there's not enough of it if its supposed to be like cheesecake. ugh, this was not what i was expecting at all and im far from pleasantly surprised. (35 mins at 350 seemed fine for mine tho - it looks the same as the 2 pics posted)

This recipe initially worried me for two reasons before going into the oven: 1) The cake "batter" was very dry and 2) the batter and topping nearly filled my pan.----After it came out, it settled a bit while cooling to a fairly level surface and was simply amazing.  This will be my new standard chess cake recipe.

This cake is sooo rich but it is really good. I have a crazy sweet tooth and even I questioned if it was too sweet.  I only did about 3 and 1/2 cups of sugar and it turned out fine. My oven cooks uneven and it seemed like one side was more done than the other and I preferred the "crispier" side, so I will probably cook it just a little longer next time. Also, I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. All in all a good recipe that can be prepared quickly and feed a lot.

I'm surprised about all the reviews; this cake was so sweet that my grandkids (ages 9, 10 and 11) couldn't eat it.      Jan

Good, rich comforting stuff.  The tips about using hands or potato masher were good ones! I thought this was easy-peasy to make for as yummy as it is.

I have a major sweet tooth but this is so overwhelmingly sweet that  even I can't stomach it.  If you're determined to make this, I suggest cutting it into one inch squares and holding off until you have a very large bbq to attend.  It went to waste at my house.

This is an easy to make cake, very tasty, and it is impossible to taste the cake mix. One of the very few cakes in my recipe box that are not made from scratch - and nobody can tell! However - I reduce the confectioners' sugar from 4 cups down to only 1 1/2 cups and the cake is still borderlined too sweet for most people I had taste it - and even for me. Since I really like sweet (sugar does not get old in my house!) I can not imagine how "normal" people can enjoy this cake with the full load of sugar!

I made this recipe exactly as written and found way too much sugar.  My whole family agreed it was too sweet to enjoy.  I may try making it with one cup of confectioners' sugar - not four!

A friend of mine gave me this exact recipe last year.  I had one similar to it years ago but it was called sugar cream cake.  Every time I make this everyone asks for the recipe.  Now other people are making to bring to our pitch ins!  We love it & if you have a sweet tooth you will too!

My mother gave me this recipe and she called it Sticky Cake. I made it for my family and friends at work and everyone love it. I made it with a lemon cake mix and it was wonderful. I am going to try it with Red Velvet cake mix for Christmas.

I was really looking forward to this recipe. It was good, but took much longer than 35 minutes to bake. It was closer to an hour. But other than that, yummy!

try using lemon or cherry chip cake mix just about any flavor will work some better than others.

This recipe was awesome! It didn't require a long list of ingredients and it was super simple. I used fat-free egg substitute since that's all I had on hand and I used about 3-3/4 cup confectioners sugar because I figured it was really sweet anyways and I was right. My boyfriend said it's the best thing I've made :) I only got rave reviews, everyone liked it a lot. It really was delicious.

first timer on the Chess Cake, I just can't pin it but it needs something; kind of taste like cheesecake, kind of reminds me of tapioca pudding on a crust.
I would make it again if someone gives me an idea of what it is supposed to taste like or some pointers

I liked this recipe. I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup of 10x, powdered, confectioners sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract...More of a cheesecake flavor. 4 cups of sugar is insanity! I also tried a variation that we loved...choc choc chip cake mix, added one cup of chocolate chips to the cream cheese topping layer...was like a black bottom cupcake/bar cookie...excellent! Also have added a little coconut and chopped pecans to topping with chocolate base..have fun with the variations...good base recipe! flavor and texture better on second day too...great make ahead!

The first time I made this with carrot cake mix...Awesome!  The next time I made it with chocolate cake mix and I invited the same people to taste test. Guests ranged in ages from 11 years to 69 years old. Hands down the carrot cake won!  By the way, they are both better the next day.  The only thing I do different is I add vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and add 10 more minutes to the baking time.  I shake the pan to make sure the middle of the cake does not jiggle before removing from the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I going to make it again today with a different flavor cake mix.  Can't wait!!!!

I love this cake, its better then blondie brownies. Its great for bake sales, and A big hit at school. But beware they are addictive and if your watching calories, you might want to look away.

I don't know which came first, but this is almost the same thing as a gooey butter cake, which I prefer over this. I used only 3 cups of sugar and thought it was waaaayyy too sweet...(Although my offspring appreciated the sugar overload, as did my guests). Btw, this cake tasted even better the next day.

I did like this a lot and so did my brother and family, but my own family did not rave about it.  We put it in the fridge so it wouldn't be so gooey and the next day...yummy.  It was so much better the next day.  I also added a cream cheese frosting to the top so that the cake part wouldn't be as dry and that seem to go over really well.  I would try it again.

This was easy to make and looked perfect. I thought it was too sweet.  I took it to a family gathering and everyone raved.  I think that if I make this again, I’ll double the cream cheese and eggs, but not the powdered sugar.  This one is worth tweaking.

This is from the viewpoint of someone branching out and trying a recipe for something completely unfamiliar to me (chess cake). I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it's somewhat deceptive. Had the look and ingredients of a cheesecake like bar, but nothing like cheesecake. You really can't even taste the cream cheese. Good if you're looking for an easy and SUPER sweet treat.
