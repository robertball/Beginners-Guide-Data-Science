5 stars with my adaptation as follows: first I soaked the sprouts in salted water for close to an hour, then drained the water and tossed them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and some cumin (roughly a tsp worth each of the seasonings). Then I sliced the sprouts lengthwise and baked sliced side down in the oven at 475 degrees for 15 minutes. They will get a nice little char on them, just watch carefully to ensure they don't burn. While the sprouts cooked, I added the butter and seasonings from the recipe (all quantities the same) to a small sauce pan. Then I added about 8 tbsp's of coconut milk and reduced the sauce slightly. Once the sprouts were cooked, I placed them in a large bowl and tossed with the sauce. To quote both my girlfriend and roommate, both of whom assured me they hated brussel sprouts, "Oh my god, these are the best brussel sprouts I have ever eaten."

All I can say is... WOW!  These were really good in my opinion.  While I don't entirely dislike Brussels Sprouts as a rule, I can't say I normally make them often.  This recipe could help to change that!  

I soaked the sprouts in salt water for 1 hour prior to cooking.  For the jerk seasoning, I used a recipe from this website.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added a little water near the end of the cooking time and then covered the pan for a bit in order to steam them and make sure they were fully cooked and tender.

Added a bit of water and covered for a couple of minutes near end of cooking to get the sprouts cooked through.  I then let water cook off.  This was a delicious way to cook brussel sprouts.

Too spicy for the family and I. I made a jerk spice recipe that I also found on this site .... maybe that is what made it unbearably hot. Either way, I just wanted to give those that, like me, enjoy a spicy dish, but not so hot that you can't taste a thing, to skip this heartburn in a brussel sprout.

Best. Brussels. Sprouts. Ever.  Not bitter at all, full of flavor! I may never roast them with boring salt and olive oil again! Made the recipe as written, but reduced butter in half only because I didn't think I had 2 lb. ....

Terrific recipe. The curry, brown sugar and jerk work so well together.  Did mine on the grill in a throw-away aluminum pan. Really really tasty!

Curry can be very overpowering in my opinion so I did cut it back to 1/2 tbsp and increased the brown sugar a little just as a personal preference.  Very good overall. Served w/ coconut shrimp and pineapple lime rice.

We made these for Thanksgiving and they were delicious! I will be making these again. I think they would be good in a foil pac on the grill in the summer.

This was delicious. We used asparagus instead, but next time we'll try it with the Brussels sprouts. Excellent!

I was looking for a lighter fresh side to compliment a caribbean inspired fish with spicy mango sauce and this recipe was a great balance for the fish, but we flavor profile a bit disjointed for our tastes.

I like the recipe without the brown sugar.  The jerk is alittle spicy but I am going to try to put a little sour cream on it to tone down the jerk and I put a little salt.  It is really good that way!!!

Flavor was great, perfect mix of sweet and spicy. But the middle of my spouts were still quite tough. I used frozen sprouts so that might be the issue. I think I'll try roasting them instead next time.

Not a huge fan of brussels sprouts but really enjoyed this one! Only drawback was we had to use frozen brussels sprouts, I think it might be a 5 star recipe when made with fresh veggies.
