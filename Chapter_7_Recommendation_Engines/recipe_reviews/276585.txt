10/29/19 - Blood oranges are not in season right now, so I used naval oranges in their place. My husband is Italian, and he introduced me to "orange salad", which he usually makes using just oranges, salt and high quality extra virgin olive oil . . . and then eats it with bread. This was a nice twist on that, with the addition of green onions and pepper. We enjoyed it.
