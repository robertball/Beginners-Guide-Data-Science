This dish was delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I didn't include the chicken and I couldn't find this exact dressing but used another that was an Asiago dressing. I made it for a gathering and came home with an empty bowl. I was not sure how the spinach would taste in the salad but it was GREAT! Others asked for the recipe.

This was delicious! Made no changes except I added a splash of red wine vinegar and I refrigerated overnight before serving and it was WAY more tasty because all the flavors sunk in whereas it was quite bland right after I made it.

I've made this twice.  The second time, I added sliced mushrooms.  I also used Drew's Roasted Garlic and Peppercorn dressing the first time and liked it better than the Asiago Peppercorn.  I'd suggest making it at least one day before you want to serve it.  The longer it sits, the better the flavors blend.

I generally hate any recipe with balsamic vinegar in it. I really liked this as did my two children. My wife left out the olives but did everything else. No overpowering balsamic taste.

Very good recipe, I had just made it tonight. My family loved it, although it wasn't my favorite. I didn't add as much peppers, since they don't favor them too much. I wasn't a big fan, but I am glad they loved it.

Great pasta salad!  I needed a side dish, so I left off the chicken.  It was wonderful and made a huge bowl.  Tomorrow I'll add grilled chicken and have it for lunch.  The family loved it as well.

This was delicious I used all of the ingredients except I substituted the feta cheese for goat and Gorgonzola. I also used turkey breasts marinated in a pineapple mango salsa. I also used jalapeno stuffed green olives in addition to the kalamata olives. I also used grilled shrimp which had been marinated in a sundried tomato marinade.  It was delicious and I got rave reviews

Very good pasta salad, but I would go lighter on the olives next time.  They are very salty and can be used sparingly.

Does anyone know where you can get Marzetti dressing? I went to 4 grocery stores and no one even carried the brand. So I made the recipe with Briannas home style asiago cesar dressing. Used black olives instead of kalamata olives. Used dehydrated tomatoes I processed last year instead of the ones packed in oil. And added probably 1/4 cup of the dried tomatoes. Overall the flavor was good. I grilled my chicken and served it separate from the rest - I wasn't in the mood for cold chicken. Next time I will probably try a peppercorn dressing - but overall it was a success.

I made this as a side dish for a dinner with friends and their (young) kids, and everyone wanted seconds. I left out the olives (allergic) and chicken, and I used a basic italian dressing & added ground peppercorns. It was very tasty and very easy to make -- although it would have been easier to mix in a much larger bowl.

Made this for my birthday BBQ party with my man and a few other couples.  It was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and it's beautiful too.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because I wasn't able to find the dressing suggested but used another peppercorn dressing instead.  I skipped the chicken and made this as a side dish to steak instead.  Otherwise, didn't make many changes which is weird for me. Quick and easy and a good dish to make while entertaining as it wasn't complicated and didn't involve cooking.  Had lots left over for the next day which was good cause the power went out!  I will definitely make this again!

I liked all the ingredients, but thought the salad tasted meaty. I was looking for something different - I think there is bacon in the dressing or something? That's what it tasted like anyways.

SO good!  I made this for a crowd and everyone was asking for the recipe. I found the dressing at Whole Foods in the refrigerated section.  I did leave out the chicken but it would be just as good with it.  Also I couldn't find the tomoates so I added a can of italian diced tomatoes and it turned out wonderful!

This was really good. I too could not find the right dressing but selected a Garlic Parmesan in the same brand. I didn't care for the olives and will probably substitute something else next time. Overall, everyone raved about this pasta salad.

Great salad!  I made changes based on what I had on hand - used whole wheat rotini pasta,  had 1/2 bottle asiago parmesan dressing and added Ranch dressing and mayonnaise; no dried tomatoes, but added red, yellow and green peppers, red onions, 2 cloves of garlic, chopped and sauteed.  No olives, but added real bacon bits, shredded parmesan-romano cheese. No spinach, so I added chopped field greens instead of spinach.  Sauteed chicken breasts with garlic and added. It was wonderful!!

Very good. Couldn't find the dressing suggested so I substituted with a parmesian peppercorn instead. Lots of Flavor! A hit at the que.

Amazing!  I rubbed olive oil on the chicken, seasoned it with basil, oregano and garlic powder then grilled the chicken.  I do not like feta so I grated some mozzarella and provolone and shook in some grated Parmesan cheese when mixing it all together.  Everyone loved it.

Couldn't find the Peppercorn dressing at our local grocer, but their Champagne Vinagrette works equally as well.
