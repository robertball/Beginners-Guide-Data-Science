Just made this Simnel Cake and it came together beautifully.  I did use ready made almond paste and used 3 X 7oz tubes as we all love it.  I added some almond essence to the batter as well as a little cinnamon, allspice, ginger and nutmeg.  I  brushed the warm cake with about 2 tablespoons of Disaronno liquer before using the apricot jam.
Make sure you keep the cake a good way down from the heat while browning the the top as it can burn very quickly.
