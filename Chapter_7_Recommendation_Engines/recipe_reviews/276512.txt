A definite keeper!  Followed recipe with only one change - no fresh herbs so used dried.  I roasted potatoes but will use mashed next time to soak up even more of the delicious sauce

I made this recipe with boneless breasts and I didn't have fresh sage so I used a ground ingredient. I also added two drops of hot sauce and a tablespoon or two of brown sugar. It gave it a small kick with sweetness to the sauce. It went well with the mashed potatoes but all in all it was great . This will be one of many types of chicken I make .
