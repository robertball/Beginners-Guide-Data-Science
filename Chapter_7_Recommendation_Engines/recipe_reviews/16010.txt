This recipe was delicious, easy and quick to make but just needed a little help.  First I pounded the chicken breasts out to thin them out a little.  Then I mixed some feta cheese in with the peppers and stuffed the chicken.  I added a little salt & pepper to the bread crumbs.  Definately use olive oil instead of veg. oil and with the chicken thinned out you only need to cook it about 7 min. on each side.  As for the sauce, I added a little salt & pepper, a dash of garlic powder and parmesan chs and simmered it for a couple of minutes and it was much better.

Nice presentation even though a little hard to keep together at first. I did not dare "shake" in breadcrumbs,(would of fell apart) I just carefully "rolled" the chicken in them. I only used half of the crumbs called for. I had to use two toothpicks for each breast and then after browning they stayed together nicely. I choose to bake after browning(I poured sauce over all, covered and baked for about 20 minutes) I did add some feta crumbles, fresh minced garlic and a couple fresh spinach leaves to the chicken "pocket" along with the roasted peppers. Due to reviews, I also added ground cayenne pepper and chili powder to the sour cream mixture. Loved the flavors of the roasted red pepper, the sour cream sauce with the Feta (more than the chicken!) I will make this one again!

After reading all the reviews and seeing some had trouble with the recipe, I decided to take a different approach.  
1.  I used partially thawed chicken breasts - this was much easier to handle and to slice.  I sliced lengthwise and placed a small amount of the feta cheese inside, then red peppers.  I then placed in the fridge for 1/2 hour to defrost entirely.
2.  I used buttermilk to coat the chicken (while held together with toothpicks).
3.  I used panko bread crumbs seasoned with dried parsley, oregano and garlic powder.  
4.  I browned slightly in pan in olive oil. Removed toothpicks.
5.  I felt I had to bake in the oven because the chicken pieces were quite large.  350 degrees for 30 - 40 mins. Unfortunately I didn't have any roasted red peppers left to make the sauce.  I used 1/8 cup of mild salsa with the sour cream.   This was very good!  I will definately serve this to visiting guests for dinner.

This recipe was ok, however I disagree that it is "full of flavour". The red peppers give it nice, but very SUBTLE flavour. (It needs more seasonings!) Perhaps adding something to both the filling and the bread crumb coating would help (Maybe even the sauce?). Cooking it in vegetable oil on the stove isn't a great idea (I used olive oil). The coating got too brown- I suggest baking it in the oven. Also, the cooking times given were too long. If I had cooked the chicken for 5 min, then 10 min, then another 5 on med-high heat, it would have been severely overdone.

This chicken was ok, it wasn't half as hard to put together as I thought it would be. I slit the chicken and stuffed it with roasted peppers and secured it with two toothpicks.Then I  salt and peppered the chicken and coated with breading and fried in a small amt of oil. When I made the sauce I used reduced fat Feta and reduced fat Sour cream. I added a little garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper to it too, so that jazzed it up a bit. Then I baked it in the oven for 20 minutes or so at 350 with the sauce on it. (otherwise it never would have been fully cooked)It made a nice presentation but the chicken was kind of bland unless you had it dripping in sauce and there wasn't enough sauce to do that.

This dish turned out beautifully for me without any modifications.  The flavor was well-balanced and not overpowering, and the dish looked gorgeous when plated.

The idea was great but I did make some changes. I added feta and spinach to the stuffing, as suggested, also added a garlic clove to the pureed sour cream/red pepper mixture, salt/pepper the chicken, breaded it, then put the chicken into a baking dish, covered it with the sauce and baked it.  Delicious.  We all enjoyed it.

I loved this but had to give it 4 because I changed the procedure quite a bit. I stuffed the chicken with the red peppers, and garlic and feta. I then brushed it with sour cream so the breadcrumbs would stick. I then baked it. I made the sauce as is but I heated it up so the texture was thinner which was better in my opinion. So delicious - even the picky veggie hating bf ate it. :) Thanks for a great base recipe!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe, although I made some changes.  My husband is not a fan of red bell peppers, so I substituted sun-dried tomatoes instead, and it came out perfectly!  Also, I added a clove of garlic to the sour cream mixture and that added a little kick to it!  Finally, I used goat cheese instead of feta and it was just terrific!  I'll definitely be making this one again, and soon!

Full of flavor.  Next time, I may bake the chicken in the sour cream sauce to reduce the fat.

This is a beautiful and simple dish. I think the presentation should be exactly as written.  Adding more to the filling and more to the sauce as others have suggested is a gread idea, and up to personal taste.  I also agree with browning the chicken and then finishing it in the oven so the chicken stays moist.  Excellent recipe, with plenty of room to tweak!  Gives me great ideas!  Thanks.

I had a difficult time getting this cooked through without overcooking it since the peppers inside kind of insulated the meat.  I may try the baking method next time.

I baked these in the oven because I though it would easier at the time(it had been a busy day) and they still turned out wonderful.  I wasn't impressed with the sour cream mixture but the feta cheese was great with the red peppers!  This one is a keeper.

This recipe sounded delicious, so after reading all the comments, I made my own creation.  It was 5 stars!  Loved it.  Here's what I did differently:  Dredged thin-sliced breast in flour, then egg, then italian bread crumbs.  Rolled with pepper and goat cheese in the middle, secured with 2 toothpicks.  Put in pyrex dish (that was sprayed with Pam).  Put a small piece of butter over each one.  I then took the sour cream, some goat cheese, some roasted pepper, a clove of garlic, and salt & pepper in the food processor.  Put some of that over the chicken and baked on 350 for about 40 minutes?  Lost track of time, but until chicken no longer pink.

I loved this recipe because it is quick, yummy and healthy! I did bake the chicken in the oven and it turned out great. I even put a little of the sour cream mixture in the inside of the chicken. i have made this recipe several times and will make again.

Like most other reviewers I slightly changed the recipe, so apologies to the author! I blended sour cream, roasted bell peppers, garlic, basil, paprika and ricotta to a thick sauce, spread it over chicken breasts and baked whole for 45mins without stuffing. Yet another successful variation!

I didn't do the breading, and I added chile poblanos along with the red peppers for a "Mexicana" look. I used Pepperjack cheese instead of feta, also putting some inside the chicken breast. I flattened down and rolled the chicken instead of trying to do pockets. Worked easier for me. Hold the rolls together with toothpicks while baking.

Made this dish for dinner last night and we really enjoyed the flavors.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts and rolled the roasted red peppers and cheese inside the breasts.  I used pepper jack cheese for a kick.  I did bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 mins, poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked for another 10-15 mins.  I used a 16 ounce container of sour cream, chopped some of the roasted red peppers and added to sour cream, added a dash of cayanne powder, garlic salt and chili powder, along with some feta cheese.  I also used Italian Panko bread crumbs.  This was easy to make and I will make this again.

This was great! I made some changes though. Stuffed the chicken with Feta and peppers. I added garlic powder and Italian Seasoning to the bread crumbs and then fried it in olive oil. I also added garlic, chili powder, a dash of Cayenne pepper and feta to the sour cream sauce. Poured the sauce over the chicken during the last few minutes of cooking. Yummy.

This is a fairly quick prep and cook time recipes, so I make this at least once a week with slight variations. I do not make the sauce.  As for the filling I usually sauté a handful of spinach and tsp. of garlic in some olive oil and stuffed inside the breast along with the red pepper.  Bread it and cook in pan on stove slightly coated with olive oil.   Last week I added some caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese with the spinach and pepper.  Makes a good cold sandwich the next day. (Disclaimer:  I actually don't eat this as I am a vegetarian. I make it for my boyfriend. I ask him to rate all recipes I make.  He gives it a 5 every time).

The flavor wasn't bad, but I think if I make this again I'll stuff the chicken with a mixture of pepper, feta & maybe kalamata olives for more punch.

We're a house torn on this one. I did sub mozz/mont jack foir the feta & Italian bread crumbs for plain. What hubby & I didn't like at all was the sauce. So sour w/the sweetness of the red peppers. Not good. My daughter thought it was great, hence 3 stars :)

Not going to lie I just barely followed this recipe.  I stuffed the breast with roasted red peppers and feta, drizzled with olive oil and a dash of liquid smoke, and threw them on the George Foreman grill.  Came out awesome.  Fast and simple. Less than 20 minutes start to finish.

This dinner was great for valentines day.  Perfect colors.  I pounded out the chicken breasts and rolled up the red peppers and asparagus.  Held them together with a toothpick.  Placed them in italian breadcrumbs, and pressed some on top.  Then, I baked them in the oven for about 40-45 minutes.  In the sauce I added red pepper, smoked paprika, garlic & onion powders, and black pepper.  Great sauce!  I plated it by drizzling the sauce over the chicken and sprinkling some chopped parsley.  It was wonderful!  I served it with pasta noodles dressed with olive oil and black pepper, along with red chard and garbanzo beans from this website.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great Recipe! I did give it my own twist. I added garlic salt to the bread crumbs and lightly pounded the split chicken breast. I also added a layer of spinach on top of the feta and pepper. I jazzed up the sauce with some chopped leeks,salt and pepper. No need to shake in a bag.Super yummy!

This was just great, even when I made the mistake of buying marinated red peppers instead of roasted ones. The sauce on its own isn't anything to write home about, but it is heavenly on top of this chicken! I sliced through each chicken breast, stuffed it, and then tied it up- I found I was able to get more stuffing into the chicken this way. I served it with some roasted red potatoes and root vegetables. Would definitely make again!

I love this recipe and have been making it for years since I first saw it.  I bake it, instead of frying.  I also add fresh chopped garlic to the sour cream sauce as well as some Italian seasonings.  I use lowfat feta cheese.  I serve it with penne pasta and sauce and a salad or sauted' spinach.

This was a really great start. I did tweak it just a bit. I agreed with some other reviewers that the sauce was a little bland. I tasted it before removing from the blender and ended up adding a little basil and garlic salt. I also followed another reviewer's advice and put a little of the feta inside the pockets of the chicken before adding the roasted red peppers. I also added some marinated artichoke hearts. I browned the chicken and then cooked in the oven. It took about 40 minutes on 350. with just a little tweaking, ended up a great recipe and I will definitely make this again.

Very good, very moist.. I mixed in roasted peppers/spinach and instead of feta, I used goat cheese.   I also mixed in olive oil in the breadcrumbs, roll the chicken in egg wash then breadcrumbs.  It came out crispy and delicious.  A healthier version.

Very good.  I fried and then baked the chicken.  I also carefully placed the bread crumbs on the breasts as shaking would have spilled the contents.  I definitely recommend adding feta to the sauce and using more than the recipe calls for.  Very rich but very good!

Like some of the other reviewers I was concerned that cooking it on top of the stove would result in chicken too dark on the outside but not cooked enough inside. I didn't want to solely cook it in the oven, so I lightly browned them in a skillet (sprayed with Pam only; no extra oil). I then baked them, sauce in all, covered, at 350 for about 40 minutes. I also took some other reviwers'suggestions and added sauteed spinach and feta to the red peppers for the stuffing. I used non-fat sour cream.
All family memembers enjoed this.

Very festive!  Makes a nice presentation if you put the sauce on the plate first, then the chicken and feta.  Next time, I'll place the feta on the chicken just before removing from the pan so the cheese will melt a little.  The kids removed the peppers and ate the chicken, but loved the sauce (go figure)!

Nobody diliked this one, a nice change of pace. I did bake it instead 375 for 40mins (flipped halfway) in a little olive oil. I also did stuff the feta in the chicken. I added fresh cracked black pepper, galic powder and fresh chopped parsley to sauce. I will be making this one again.

I loved this recipe, but did change a few things. I used bone-in chicken. Sliced on thickest part and added as any peppers as I could fit. I browned them in olive oil and finished bakingat 35 0 for approx 30 min. I used a horseradish cheese the juice from peppers and a few remaining peppers. Poured over near end of baking. I also used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the plain.

This was very tasty.  I did make a few modifications.  I added some grated Romano in with the bread crumbs and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Served with fettuccine that was fancied up with butter, olive oil, pepper and garlic salt.  yum yum yum!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I made a few changes, first I used thin chicken breasts spread them flat and placed the peppers on top then rolled them up.  I used panko bread crumbs and added garlic salt, pepper and dried basil to the mixture then coated the chicken.  I really liked the sauce and I didn't really measure the sour cream and peppers just kind of did it to taste.  Good recipe if you want something different.

Very good and pretty with the red peppers inside the chicken.  I lightly pan fried then baked to finish cooking.  No need for toothpicks as long as you are careful the first time you flip them in the pan.  After that they stayed together nicely.  Will make again, but may add a few more spices to give more flavor.

I'm giving it a 5 star rating based on my adaptation of this recipe.  I chopped up roasted red peppers, and mixed in some sundried tomatoes, shaved Parmesan, oregano, basil and minced garlic.  Then I secured them with toothpicks (I really loaded in the stuffing!) Then I seasoned panko bread crumbs with sea salt, pepper, and a little more garlic.  (Use whatever you like)  I then browned the chicken in olive oil, til nicely browned.  A did up an appropriate amount of basmati rice, and just before it was done cooking, I put it in a casserole dish with the chicken breasts on top.  I then topped it all with the sour cream mix, which I seasoned up.  Baked it for @ 20mins. in a 350 oven.  Check and add chicken broth if the rice starts to look dry.  You can really do any variation with this dish.  Next time I'll do an Aegean chicken with feta, Greek olives, oregano, etc.  Adjust the seasonings to suit your family's taste.

I have made this several times, the roasted red peppers keep the chicken so moist.  Instead of coating in breadcrumbs and frying, I grill the stuffed chicken.  This cuts the fat and gives it GREAT flavor!

I took the advice of the reviewer who did this with chicken cut into cubes. But I went a little further and added a dash each of salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the bread crumbs. Instead of milk I used 1/3 cup white wine vinegar to deglaze the pan. I pureed the red peppers with the sour cream, poured this into the deglazed pan to just barely heat through. Served over rice.

I thought this dish was wonderful, and I have made it numerous times. Both my family and my extremely finicky boyfriend love this recipe. It is often requested at family gatherings. I plan to add feta cheese and/or spinach to the pepper stuffing the next time I make this recipe for a little variety. Thanks so much, Avery!

This is a wonderfully simple yet delicious chicken dish.  I make this often for company who delight in the sweetness of the red peppers stuffed in the chicken.  Try roasting you own peppers instead of buying the canned ones....

My husband and I love everything with red peppers, however this recipe was tasteless. Even after adding spices, it had no flavor. I would suggest marinading the chicken for a couple of hours before cooking, but I wouldn't make it again.

Very good!!! I used Spicy Shake & Bake as my bread crumbs then baked in the oven. So juicy and tender. I then used fat free sour cream for the red pepper sauce and it was perfect.

This recipe was great!  Nice and easy to make.  However, if you cook using larger sizes of chicken (like me), I would suggest browning each side then throwing it in the oven.  I started getting concerned my chicken was going to burn on the stovetop.  I also served this with the sour cream sauce like the recipe calls for, but more like a dipping sauce in addition to a pesto as an alternative as well.

This recipe was delicious.  A great spin on plain old chicken.  I prefer the hot roasted red peppers to the sweet ones though.

My family loved this recipe.  I added some fresh thyme to the sauce, as well as garlic, salt & pepper.  I also sauteed fresh peppers in some white wine instead of using canned.  I used one suggestion of using sun-dried tomatoes, so I blended some to add to the sauce, which gave it an excellent flavor.  I think in the future I would use plain yogurt instead of sour cream.

We really liked this recipe. I added gorgonzola cheese to the sour cream & peppers in the food processor to make a rich, thick, flavorful, bright-orange sauce. After browning the chicken, I covered it and cooked the extra 10 minutes. The chicken was so moist. Try that vs baking. I'll make it again - and I'll add a clove of crushed garlic to the sour cream sauce & some cayenne pepper (I didn't read the reviews before cooking).

This is a very pretty dish.  We enjoyed it, but the recipe won't make it into my regular rotation.  It was a little boring, despite the ingredients list.  But if you want a nice dish with mild flavor and good presentation...this is one to keep.

I loved this recipe---but.  I don't like sour cream so I left the sauce out completely.  I used bread crumbs made from brown bread so they were quite crumbly.  Dip and pat the crumbs instead of shaking.  Worked out great.  Many raves.

This has got to be one of the worst things I have ever tasted in my life. I added additional seasonings and that didn't help. Down right awful. I thought it was bland; he didn't just thought it was weird combination of things. Don't waste your time on this one.

The chicken was extremely difficult to stuff and I purchased thick breasts.  My knife just kept going through the other side of the chicken so I just added the filling on the top and baked it in the oven.  Maybe the presentation was not as fancy as the stuffed chicken, but considering the level of difficulty for stuffing, it would not have been worth the time and effort.

I thought this was pretty good.  I noticed comments that people wanted more of the sour cream layer, so I doubled it (loosely--didn't really measure, but I had enough to cover all 4 pieces of chicken).  I liked it, hubs thought it was so-so, but I think it might be more tasty and visually appealing with an assortment of veggies instead of just the red pepper for the chicken filling.  Hubs isn't the biggest fan of peppers but he does eat them; I'm thinking a mix of peppers, artichokes and maybe potatoes or zucchini would be good.  It does, I agree, need a bit more seasoning--I added garlic powder to the sour cream mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe calls for cooking in skillet after coating with bread crumbs, but I cooked this on the grill with just a thin rub with olive oil and a little salt and pepper and it got rave reivews.  To get more peppers and Feta into the chicken breast, I cut the "pocket" along the length and used round toothpicks to hold together while grilling.  I put the cheese in first and then the pepper so the chees would not run out during grilling.
Like other reviewers, I thought the sauce needed some help, so I added a little salt, fresh ground white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Mrs. Dash' s Vegetable seasoning and 2-3 dashes of Frank's Red hot sauce, which really helped.  I was unclear from the instructions as to how many roasted red peppers to add, but knew I did not want a "pink" sauce, so I kept adding until the sauce was nice and red.  After blending, I refrigerated until ready to serve and then heated in microwave until warm.  
Family & friends say this is a keeper to be served again and several asked for the recipe, which I gladly shared.

Excellent! a little challenging getting the roasted red peppers to stay in the chicken (I did use toothpicks, helped a little lol) but well worth the effort. I love the sour cream 'sauce', used some on my vegetables too yum!  I didn't need as much bread crumbs, so maybe set up less (had it in a bowl and gently coated my chicken) and add more if needed. I blended the feta cheese with the sour cream & peppers so those in my family that claim they don't like it wouldn't decide before trying it that they didn't like it because of seeing the feta :) we all really liked it!

The taste is great though I added some more spice with black pepper. Love the redness of the peppers with the chicken. Some modifications I made were to include some feta cheese in the sauce and use less sour cream. Also, i did jarred grilled red peppers instead of the roasted and used the brine that the peppers were to coat the chicken and then roll the chicken in the breadcrumbs.  I fried the chicken but the breadcrumbs started to burn when i flipped sides in spite of using medium heat and so i baked the chicken for it to cook thoroughly on 350 for about 25 minutes.

Very good!  My husband called it a "taste explosion". I listened to some of the reviews, and added a sprinkle of garlic powder and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper to the sauce - I'm glad I did.  I also baked it after frying in olive oil - but the sauce turned out a little spongy, so next time I will cook it completely on the stove as the recipe says, and heat the sauce in another pan.

Husband rated this a 3 and I rated it a 4 1/2, so we compromised @ a 3.75!  I prepared the recipe mostly as written... however, rather than breading and pan frying, I grilled it in the George.  The sour cream sauce, I had to heat.... and headed or not, it was rather runny with the addition of the peppers.  The flavor, however, I thought was very good... a very understated taste... (husband referred to it as "bland") that was really amped up with the addition of the feta on top.  I had skimmed the comments of other reviewers... and felt compelled to hit the chicken with a quick grind of salt and pepper before spooning on the sauce... and then added a sprinkle of parsley at the end... and the flavor remained pretty mild.... I think I expected more....but again, the feta added a nice bit of flavor.  Overall, I would make it again... but perhaps in addition to blending the peppers and sour cream, I would add some coarsely chopped... as well as some of the the cheese into the sauce... and into the pocket of the breast as other reviewers suggested.  I don't think I would add additional seasonings, though... more cheese and maybe just the parsley for some color.  All in all, I think this was very good... and I will be making it again!  Thank you for sharing!

Try adding a little bit of smoked paprika. It gives the sauce alot of flavor with very little fuss.

Everyone loved this except my hubby that doesn't care for "dry" cheese like Feta.  Even my kids enjoyed it.  The sauce seemed a little runny.  Extra sauce is good...We really liked it!

This was a good recipe.  I did make some changes.  I stuffed the chicken with smoked provolone and fresh mozzarella,and the peppers.  I baked it in the oven for one hour.  It was a bit dry but tasty. I think next time I will follow the recipe to the letter and see which one is better. :)  Very quick and simple. Family loved it.

This makes a great presentation, and its taste isn't just generic.
I substituted Bleu Cheese for the Feta cheese, I used the bleu cheese in both the stuffing with the red peppers and the sauce. I also garnished it with freshly chopped cilantro.

I made this by cutting chicken in small pieces then tossing in bread crumbs and browning in oil.  Then I removed chicken to a plate, and added a touch more oil then added a 1/2 c milk to deglaze pan.  Then I added the sour cream and all the red peppers, and mrs dash and garlic.  Simmer a couple minutes then toss chicken pieces back in and stir to coat.  It was sooooo good. good served with rice.

Excellent flavor, but the "construction" of the dish is off.  I'm not sure how to improve on that, but I believe it can be done.

I breaded the chicken first, then stuffed it with the red peppers.

I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and mixed in the feta to the sour cream.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder and black pepper to the mixture.  It was SOOOO good!

Very easy and presents nicely. I read all the reviews prior to making this dish and took many of the suggestions. I also modified the recipe a bit to make it lighter. These are the changes I made:   For the sauce, I reduced the sour cream to 1/3 cup and used 2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt. (I thought 2 cups of sour cream added too many calories).Along with about 1/4 cup of roasted peppers I added about 1/4 cup of the juice from the roasted peppers into the sauce.  I also seasoned the sauce with garlic, basil, parsley salt and pepper. I don't like feta cheese so I used 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. Instead of frying, I baked the chicken. The dish was a big hit!  I will definitely make this again. Hubby had second and third helpings!  I didn't tell him about the yogurt!!! ??

Made this twice. Only change I made was seared it in the pan and transferred the breast to oven to finish them. Breast were to large to cook on top of stove. I also severed w/ and w/o the topping either way it was delish.

The only thing I changed was to use a "Moroccan" flavoured breadcrumb which gave it a little kick .....all in all a very nice recipe.

This is a favorite in our house. I didn't modify the recipe much. I add a little feta to the sour cream with salt and pepper.

Soooooo good!!! The sour cream sauce on top was a little bland so I added some ground red pepper and fresh minced garlic. I can't wait to make this one again!

I tried this the first time as written and the 2nd time modified. The 2nd time, I omitted the bread crumbs and grilled the stuffed chicken breasts. I pounded the breasts flat which i highly recommend to cook evenly and quickly without over drying. I stuffed the breasts with feta and roasted peppers and seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper. I used string to hold it together. For the sauce I chopped the roasted red pepper and mixed with sour cream and feta, added a pinch of garlic powder and cayenne. I prefer the chunky sauce so as to separate and appreciate the different flavors. I did prefer this on the grill. I like my version better but would rate the original recipe as a solid 4 stars.

i loved this!! so tasty and my husband loved it, he said it was delicious, different and comforting. :) I even messed up somehow and the breading got a bit burnt? not sure if it was the veg oil or if the pan was too hot on med/high heat. It wasn't pretty on the outsidelike the picture but cut in half, it looked great and yum - yum - yum!! When stuffing the chicken, i made slits on the thickest side middle of the breast and slid the knife slightly left and right so i could get more bell peppers in there. I added a little paprika, garlic powder and italian seasons to the breadcrumbs and I didnt have feta cheese so i used mozzerella.  Also, I didn't have roasted peppers in a jar, so I used the red bell pepper that i had. I cut it into 4ths and put it in the oven wrapped in foil with a little olive oil and butter and baked at 375 for about 15mins. tasty :) I will definately make this again! Thanks!!!
