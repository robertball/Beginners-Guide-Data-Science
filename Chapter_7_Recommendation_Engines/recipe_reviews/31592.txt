I made a few changes to suit our tastes and what fresh veggies we have right now. First I used both fresh tomatoes and fresh corn instead of canned. Also added about a 1/4 cup of water with 1/2 of a Knorr vegetable bullion cube dissolved and some fresh basil. Then put the entire sauce over pasta. Made for a very satisfying, fresh summer meal (and a way to use up that zuchinni!!!) Oh, and added some grated parm cheese on top too! Done this way, I rate the recipe a 5!

Wow!  This is sooooo good.  I added some yellow pepper and a half of a jalepano as well.  Great flavor.  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of canned as well as the corn. Made a great sauce over bow tie pasta noodles.

This is good and easy. I added 2 cans diced tomatoes.  Plus an extra 1/4 cup of light cream that I thckened and added toward the end. It was good with light cream

This recipe didn't turn out well for me.  I substituted milk for the cream, which was probably the reason it didn't work.  I'll have to try it again sometime using cream.

This is a great base recipe to make as a pasta dish.  I used this recipe as a base and added a little here and there to make my own.  I added in some chicken and extra seasonings and served over bow tie pasta.  I loved all the veggies in it! Thanks for the recipe!

Used yellow onion instead of red, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I also added Italian Seasoning, basil, mushrooms & cream of mushroom soup. (Soup didn't make a huge difference though!)  I love vegetarian dishes, but my family and I all agreed it needed something..... we thought maybe ground turkey!

I substituted sweet yellow onion for the red, and I added half a poblano chili, roasted and diced.  I served this recipe with pasta and Italian sausage.  A guest who generally avoids vegetables went back for seconds!

I thought this was a great dish . . . I varied on two ingredients and the result was great overall:  in lieu of salt and pepper I added some "Greek" seasoning and some traditional Italian seasonings, as well, and I used the diced tomatoes that contain basil and oregano.  A little time consuming, but well worth the wait!

A great recipe that I'll fix again!

I made this last night for my family and we loved it so much that we made it again tonight.  I made it just the way it says to last night and it turned out very well though the sauce was a tad thin.  Maybe it's because I covered the skillet for the entire cooking time.  Tonight I changed it up a bit adding different vegetables; green pepper & celery.  Still a hit!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious! I used home grown zucchini and bowtie pasta. I also added home grown basil. We are also growing corn which will be ready soon so I'll make it with that as soon as the corn is ready.

I found this incredibly easy and tasty!  I can definitely see how I could use this recipe with just about any vegetable.  I made some minor adjustments.  To stiffen up the sauce I added about 2-3 tablespoons of flour about 7-8 minutes after the cream had been added.  I also used much more pepper, some dry basil flakes, and some red pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick.

This was pretty tasty.  I used about 5 fresh garden tomatoes, which watered it down quite a bit, but it was still good as a sauce over whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  I could have thickened it up with some parmesan, but I wanted to save a few calories tonight.  I enjoyed the corn in there (used frozen) and would have liked even more.  Oh, I added a bunch of fresh basil during the end part of cooking time.  And I used a whole sweet onion.  Would have loved to use red, but I only had yellow on hand.  Didn't add much salt at all- all those fresh veggies don't need it.  Tasty and easy recipe!

This was pretty tasty. I had the first serving alone as a side dish, but the subsequent servings over pasta. I like it much better as a pasta sauce than as a side dish. Instead of the heavy cream, I used evaporated skim milk. This would be good with the addition of chicken.

it looked nice, but the taste was not too good.  Maybe something to make the sauce/cream thicker would be good.

I good idea, but it was a bit flavorless to me...all i could taste was the corn. Has to be served immediately over pasta or it gets greasy.

Added some hot Cherry peppers since I love them with creamy sauces! Only problem I had was getting the sauce thick! Other wise with the peppers it was delish!

This was really good. I had some left over zucchini that I had roasted in the oven and that came out fine. I also don't cook in oil. I just spray the pan with cooking spray to cut down on the greasiness. And I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, as that was all I had. Came out great!!

Made this for supper tonight. I used shredded zucchini from the freezer, added cherry tomatoes instead of canned, used 1 cup of tomato bouillon and added noodles and polish sausage. I also added 2 cups of whole milk and a tablespoon of flour instead of heavy cream. Yum!!

This was a delicious lunch with some leftover pasta mixed in. I made as directed, adding some red pepper flakes for bite. The half cup of heavy cream is spot on, it made the perfect sauce with the written ingredients. I would not have liked this as much if I subbed half and half or milk. Thanks very much for sharing.

I give the original recipe a 4 but with the suggestions made by other members and some variations I added it came out a 5!! I used it as a pasta sauce and used evaporated skim milk instead of the fattier ingredient and I thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch.  I also added mushrooms, red pepper and oregano for more flavor.  I will make this again, only next time I will add some spinach and more mushrooms.  All in all it was a big crowd pleaser.
