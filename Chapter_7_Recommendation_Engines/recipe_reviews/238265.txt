This was a nice change from the usual potato salads. I did not cube the potatoes before boiling b/c I have better luck when I keep them whole. I also peeled the sweet potato, which it doesn't say to in the recipe, but I thought they should be. The flavor was really nice...the slight sweetness from the sweet potatoes w/ the tang from the horseradish and spicy mustard, and, of course, the bacon! I did measure the horseradish and spicy mustard, but eyeballed everything else. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe did not disappoint but I did make a few changes. I omitted the sweet potatoes and doubled the red potatoes. I added 1/4 cup of sour cream, about 1/2 cup of chopped celery, more salt and pepper that the recipe called for, and 12 slices of crumbled bacon instead of 4 like the recipe called for. It was awesome!!!
