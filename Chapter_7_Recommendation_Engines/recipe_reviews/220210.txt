Really, really good!  I made the recipe to a T - didn't change a thing and everyone loved it.  Some paprika or seafood seasoning on the fish itself might be a nice touch.  Next time, and there will be a next time!

I had some halibut stashed in the freezer and decided to give this a try.  It was very good!  I baked this in individual oval Corningware dishes, which helped to contain the yummy sauce.  I didn’t think an oven temperature as high as 475 was necessary, so I baked mine at 400 degrees and they were perfectly cooked in 20-25 minutes.  I think 20 minutes at 475 would have overcooked the fish.  This is super easy and we enjoyed it.

This recipe is outstanding!  I couldn't afford halibut, so I used cod instead.  My entire family devoured this and requested that I make it again very soon.  I was a little concerned that the sauce would be bland, but it was just right.  I'll be watching for halibut to go on sale so we can try the recipe as intended, but until then, this will be in our regular rotation for other types of fish.  Thanks for sharing!

1-12-2016 ~I'm lucky to have beautiful halibut filets in the freezer we hauled back from a trip to Seattle.  Hubs has always said he dislikes it, preferring firmer fish like salmon or swordfish,  but I just can't eat it all myself while he grills himself a steak.  I took a chance making this tonight and much to my pleasure and surprise, we BOTH liked it.  I didn't have green onions at hand but frozen chives filled in nicely.  I wasn't confident with the high cooking temperature and 20 minutes at 425 degrees for the thick filets I had worked out fine and perhaps could have used a minute or two less.  This doesn't get any easier to make and is surprisingly delicious given how quick it is to throw together and pop in the oven.  Give the bonus of Hubs enjoying it too, this is something I won't hesitate to make again - in fact, I'll be eager to.  One suggestion however - it needs a little pop of color so give it a little sprinkle of paprika either before or after baking.  A spring of parsley or something green upon serving doesn't hurt either.

Without the delicious topping, this would have been just another fish recipe.  Loved the creaminess of this dish, mild, flavorful and such an easy recipe to assemble. It's not often one comes across a recipe that's so balanced that you don't need to change a thing...  Served this with Fresh Tomato Salad also from AR which complemented the fish's creaminess.  Thank you jalexandropoulos.

I made 2 changes to this fish dish. Other wise I would give it 10 stars. First, picture me, in the market try to remember the ingreds for this dish. Confussed look, creased brow. You get the idea. I snagged a package of tilapia. Somehow thought of most of the nearly everything else. There was a Demo lady who was giving samples of fish, sprikled with Chef Moritos fish seasoning on it. WOW, that is Yummy! Second, got my bottle and headed home. Whipped up a great salsa. Darn! Forgot the dill weed for the fish.! What to use? Cilanrto. Gave a shake of the fish seasoning slathered on the spread and in the oven with tator tots they went. Mmmm, starting to smell good in here! Time to toast the corn tortillas. One of my DD's friends Happened to stop by. Funny how they Just Know huh? OK gang, dinners Ready!! My DS was a bit skeptical, so he only got. Well he ate 2 more for good measure! Hubby was home and before I could get the kids fed, he was RAVING about how good these were!!  Keeper. Thanks Jalex.

Great recipe!
I try following recipes exactly the first time I make them, but didn't have green onions so used chopped white onion instead. It still turned out delicious, and I'm sure with green onion it would be even better.

I baked the filet (approx. 1" thick) at 400 for 15 minutes.
I agree with the other reviewer that 20 minutes at 475 degrees would definitely result in overcooked fish (and I like my fish well done).

We have about 60 lbs of halibut left (down from 75) in our deep freezer from a trip to Alaska.  I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it, ans this one got a definite thumbs up from my husband, 7 year old son, and 4 year old daughter.  I didn't use all of the spread/sauce and served it with the fish.  I made mashed potatoes and peas, and the sauce was really good on the potatoes.  This will become a halibut staple recipe!  So easy and delicious.  The only change I made was I reduced the temp to 400 and baked for 12 minutes since we "butterfly" our halibut steaks.

This was great! I used cod and forgot to mix in the dill, so I just sprinkled some on top before baking. Very tasty and different...will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Everyone is right. This is a fabulous recipe. I used  a pound of wahoo rather than halibut. I usd fresh dill instead of dried. I also reduced oven temp to 400 as other suggested. It was perfect after 20 minutes. I added white wine, a little butter  and lemon in the bottom before placing the fish.  Added a little bread crumbs to the top. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans with almonds, cranberries and lemon. I will definitely do again but would want it a little lighter,  I’d reduce some of the dill/mayo/sour cream sauce that I put on the fish and maybe serve with brown rice or quinoa rather than mashed potatoes.

I did without the onions, but it is a wonderful dish for us and for guests.  I regularly hear, "It's the best halibut I've had."

This was very tasty...bf said I could make this again anytime:)
I followed the idea of another reviewer and put melted butter, about 1 1/2 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice and same amount of white wine in the pan followed by the halibut, covered with the  mayo/sour cream/green onion/dill mixture, then sprinkled it with fresh bread crumbs and lastly  sprinkled it lightly with shredded cheddar cheese.  I baked it at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes (the fish was still pretty chilled inside) instead of the 475 degree temp in the recipe and it came out perfect!  130 degrees internal temp.  Thank you jalexandropoulos for the recipe!!

Being a Midwesterner, my seafood cooking skills usually leave a lot to be desired. However, for our traditional fancy Christmas Eve dinner, my daughter asked for seafood. I used frozen halibut fillets from the grocery store (very, very pricey compared to even high quality beef steak, but this was a special occasion). This recipe was full-proof even for someone not used to cooking seafood. We loved the dill topping with the halibut and added a little paprika for color. All around great compliments from a crowd that eats seafood only rarely. I will try this in the future, but probably with a less expensive piece of fish.

We get our halibut from  Alaska and I typically would not put a sauce on it because its so good with just lemon and butter.  
I am glad I tried this sauce and will for sure make it again.
I would probably double the sauce as it was so yummy!!!

I followed recipe to a t. I've always loved halibut but husband is not the fish eater I am. He just said this is probably the best fish he's ever had and helped himself to seconds.

Very good and simple recipe to make for Halibut. I was a bit hesitant to make this as I couldn't imagine what sounds like a warm dill sauce, but was pleasantly surprised and pleased it did not cover up the actual flavor of the fish. We liked it so much that we thought to make it again the next day using Lingcod, but my husbands taste buds changed in the morning. The only change I made to the recipe was using Lactose Free Plain Yogurt in place of the sour cream (1:1 sub). It worked wonderfully for my dietary restrictions. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. This will be our go to recipe in the future for a quick and easy, but very flavorful fish!

I added parmesan on top, which was a nice addition.  I think I'll add a little paprika next time, as well.

This recipe caught my attention because of the Sitka reference in the name... recently visited Sitka and loved it....I've made this twice now and my family devours it...they don't even speak during the meal....just eat while making appreciative noises.

I S&P, and squeezed fresh lemon juice to the halibut prior to adding the mixture.  Very good, this will be a “regular” at our home.  I served it with green bean almandine and long grain & wild rice.  (I would choose asparagus, but hubby doesn’t like it!)

Made several times!  Easy restaurant style dish.  When halibut is out of season, I’ve used cod.  Company worthy and one if those that you can have ready before guests come, pop in the oven and still enjoy your conversation.  I serve with long grain rice pilaf and roasted asparagus (same time as fish)...and wine!  Quick for weeknights too!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I lightly seasoned the fish with a herb seasoning prior to baking it.  Used a little to much sauce but it was easy to scrape off the excess.  I'll make it again.

Loved this dish ! Changes I made: to the sauce of mayo, sour cream and onions, I added about 1/4 tspn of Bay seasoning. I placed the individual fillets in their own baking dishes to contain the sauce and reduced the oven temp to 450 degrees for 18 minutes.
This dish was perfection...moist and tasty. My husband and I loved it and will definitely make it again!

My husband and I both thought this was too rich and heavy for an expensive fish like halibut.  It covered up the taste of the fish.  I won't be making it again.

This was awesome!  I seasoned the halibut first with a bit of lemon, lemon zest, salt & pepper.  I added some garlic powder to the sauce and added some paprika once I put the sauce over the fish for a bit of color.  My husband raved about it!

We loved this! I didn't have sour cream, so I used nonfat Greek yogurt, and while I had some green onions, there weren't enough. So, I diced some sweet onion into the mix. I sprinkled some paprika over the halibut before putting it into the oven, to add some color. Served with smashed red potatoes and sautéed spinach, and it was delicious! Thank you, I'll make this again!

Lovely 4 star restaurant quality recipe.  Made it exactly as written except put a tablespoon of gluten free bread crumbs on the top and broiled for a few minutes before taking it out of the oven.
If you like fish you'll love this recipe. Thank you for a keeper, jalex!

Wow!! This was really tasty! I did substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream. I used lemon pepper for plain pepper. Roasted veggies in same pan as I made half the portion and had room. Great dinner for two! Thank you for a flavorful fish! Can't wait to make again!

Big hit. Seemed like lots of onions but after they baked it was just right. Need to pay close attention to temp of fish. Easy to overcook. The sauce help keep the thin parts of the fish moist waiting for the thick parts to come up to 143F. A really good instant read thermometer makes this so much easier. Added paprika for color.

I made it as per the recipe except I didn't have green onions so used chives from my garden.  It was moist,  tender and deliciously flavored to be complimentary to the halibut.  It is also an easy preparation.  I'll make this for guests.

I love this recipe.  This is so easy to make.    And so delicious.  I didn't have green onions but I did have fresh chives in the garden.   It turned out  so good and the flavors  complement the halibut.   I definitely will be using recipe over and over again.

I have made this recipe twice and when I pull halibut from the freezer this is how I cook it. I do not change anything but I do watch the cooking time. If the pieces are thinner I reduce the time 5 minutes. Guests think you are brilliant cook.

Definitely will make this again.  I had an abundance of limes so I decided to omit the dill this time.  I added about a teaspoon of fresh lime juice to the sauce, and layed the halibut over lime slices in the baking pan.  I baked for 20 minutes at 425, done perfectly for us.

I've made this at least half a dozen times and we always enjoy it. I follow the recipe as written except for one substitution – the fish. Being a native of northeast Florida i'm virtually unable to obtain halibut unfortunately. However local firm mild fish such as grouper or snapper are fine replacements. This has become my go to recipe for baked fish.

Perfect taste with a good slab of fish. Try cooking a few minutes more to crisp the top a bit more. We also used it on link cod and it was just as tasty.

This recipe produced a tender, but flavorless fish, which is unfortunate for such an expensive fish. I also thought the cream and mayonnaise "sauce" was unappetizing, as a congealed, white slather on top of the fish.  I followed the recipe exactly but reduced the baking temp and time to 400 degrees for 15 minutes; maybe that negatively affected the outcome of the sauce. With so many recipes, I would skip this one.

I will definitely make this again because it's just soooo easy. We substituted chives for green onions because we have them growing in our garden.

Used our  Alaskan halibut. I would like to try it again without having to share the oven with other things, adjusting temperatures and times. And my guests coming late. The topping, though, was first rate!

Amazing simple reciepe! Nothing was left at my dinner party, but it's halibut so not surprised. Spouse gave this version with my modifications a 16/10. Unheard of in this house hold. So These are some of the changes I made. My child is anaphylactic to eggs so mayo is not an option, so made the cream sauce with only the sour cream but used a full cup to compensate for my no mayo use. I also didn't have green onions on hand so I sautéed regular onions in olive oil with minced garlic. I then put them all together (sour cream, onions garlic, dill) in my food processor and whipped it together with (Salt & pepper to taste) I salted pepper and garlic powdered seasoned the fish both sides and put into my compact dish. At the bottom of the dish I squeezed half a lemon, some white wine and melted  butter, and poured it into the bottom of the dish and then layer my fish on top, poured/spread my cream base over all the fish, then I took my Italian style bread crumbs to make a crust and added a light layer of cheddar cheese. Baked it for the allotted time then switched my oven to broil @555  to make the topping crispy. Mmmmmmmmm! Delish!

I made this just as the recipe directed the first time and my family loved it. This is a great recipe. The next time I made it I sprinkled some lemon juice on the fish before adding the topping and added some grated Parmesan to the topping mixture. We love that too.

I liked this recipe....and normally, I avoid recipes that have mayonnaise, that gets cooked in the oven. I just don't like the flavor of hot mayo. But, much to my surprise, I could not even taste a hint of it. I made two small minor changes to this recipe. After applying the sauce, I sprinkled lemon zest on each filet. After cooking, I sprinkled some paprika for added color and presentation.

This had good flavor, but the temperature is way too high or the cooking time is too long. I cooked my halibut at 450 for 18 minutes and it was dried out. Hope this helps. I will make again, just need to adjust the time/temp.

We have a lot of Halibut in the freezer from a fishing trip and I was getting tired of the same old fried fish and chips and wanted something Baked!  This more than met my expectations! The sauce was deliciously different and creamy, didn't even need tartar sauce. I didn't have green onions so I used dried chives, which worked perfectly and I topped the fillets with panko crumbs to give it a little crunch. Will definitely fix this again!

Rave reviews every time I make it, both on work sites and at home.  I omit the green onion and some of the leftover topping turns sliced cucumbers into an instant tasty cold salad.

Tonight I am making this with swordfish. This has been a favorite for several years now. Started with halibut, tried mahi mahi, orange roughy, and even tilapia. The only thing I do differently is make the salsa a double. One of these days I will have to try it with some bluegill and largemouth bass. One of our favorite recipes.

This was wonderful! I was liberal with the salt and pepper on the halibut. Also, we like green onion so threw a little extra of that into the mixture. The mixture is so good on it's own I made extra of it and we used it as a little bit of a dip for the fish as well. I bet it would make a great vegetable or home made potato chip dip. Definitely will make this again.

I read the other reviews and used cod because I had 2 fillets  in my freezer.  I was a bit skeptical because it called for such few ingredients. Boy, was I wrong!! This was DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely make this again. It was so flavorful. The only thing I regretted was not making MORE! My boyfriend and I LOVED IT!

Love this! I have alot of fish from Alaska and am always looking for new recipes. This was SO easy and SO good!!! I wouldn't make as much sauce next time. Maybe 1/3 cup each because it was alot of sauce even for a big piece of fish. I tried to reduce heat to 400 for 12 minutes but my piece of fish was to big. That would be perfect for smaller pieces of fish as the small part of mince was done. After I turned it up to 425 for 10 more minutes and it was perfect! Sprinke a little paprika on at the end...and YUM!!!!! Can't wait to make this again!

Fabulous!  I made it for the first time, and my guests raved!  Cooked thick pieces for 20 minutes at 425.  Perfect, and moist.  I used locally grown, organic scallions and added chopped fresh dill on top. I would make this again in a heartbeat.  Served with fresh white corn on the cob and a simple summer salad.  Quick and easy, but tastes like a restaurant dish.

I am not a big fish eater but I LOVED this!  So dod my husband and my 7yo daughter.  Yum!!!  I had halibut steaks about 1.25 inches thick.  The fish packaging said to cook it at 400 for 10 minutes per inch.  So I just dropped the temp down a little to 450 and cooked mine for about 15 minutes.  Perfect.   Served with french bread and asparagus.
