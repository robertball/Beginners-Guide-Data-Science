Love the chicken meatballs and I wasnâ€™t sure that I would. I am doing a whole30 diet so I had to omit all dairy and breadcrumbs for the recipe. I added in a Tablespoon of coconut flour to bind them. I cooked in the oven for twenty minutes and then another twenty or so in a pot of bubbling sauce. The taste was fantastic and a great alternative to beef/pork! Thank you
