This were pretty good. The only thing i did different was I didnt boil the zucchini shells. I just stuffed them and baked them until they were done. It saves time and an extra step. I also added some breadcrumbs before stuffing them. My family really liked them, Can make them as a main dish also, just brown some sausage with the other ingredients. This also works great.

Yum!  I had extra zucchini and mushrooms so this was a perfect option.  I did make some changes though.  I saut√©ed 2 cloves of garlic then added the pulp, mushrooms and green onions. I used the white wine which gave a great flavor. After 12 min. I still had liquid in my pan so I mixed in some Italian breadcrumbs (enough to soak up the liquid but still a moist stuffing). I did not boil the zucchini as I was concerned about them being too soft for my taste so I just popped the zucchini in the oven after they were stuffed on 400 degrees for 25min.  I served with garlic and rosemary potatoes.

So good and so easy! We have (surprise, surprise) a bumper crop of zucchini and the husband says I can make this over and over again. 

I followed the recipe entirely this time, and it was fine (a little soupy, but good). Might try experimenting with bread crumbs. 

Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this for dinner tonight. It's all I ate! Delicious. I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand, so I had to use canned. :( I also had to use red onion instead of green. I added some garlic, black pepper, grilled chicken, and onion powder. Came out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I made it for New Years dinner. I think it would be better with the chicken broth instead of the white wine though. I used the white wine, and I will definatly try it with the chicken broth next time. It is a good side dish that isn't too heavy.

Yummy! If you love zucchini and mushrooms you HAVE to try this! It was very good and it wasnt over powering so you could still taste the zucchini and the mushroom mixture was the perfect compliment.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  Now I know how I will use my excess zucchini.  I made some slight modifications as follows:  I added approx 3-4 T of finely chopped sweet onion, 1 thinly sliced fresh sweet banana pepper and a few (chopped) cherry tomatoes from from my garden.  I also added a little more salt (kosher).  I think 1/4 cup of wine would be sufficient because there was a lot of liquid that I eventually had to drain off.  Like some other posters, I also did not par-boil the shells.  After putting the stuffing in the shells, I topped them with some fresh basil, a little extra parmesan, and some panko bread crumbs.    Instead of broiling, I grilled the stuffed shells for 5 - 7 minutes with the lid of the grill closed.  Delicious.

YUM! Only thing I did differently was fry some bacon and crumble it into the mix, I felt it needed a meat component. But yeah, it was delicious!

Good base recipe that you can alter to your tastes, but as written, I found it bland. You can just bake the zukes with cheese on top- skip the boiling part!

I sprinkled it with paprika to add some color. Thinner zucchinis are more tender than thicker ones.

I think these were pretty good.  Next time I would use some hot sauce to give it a little more flavor though.

Yum!  I saved this recipe 9 months ago and finally got around to making it today.  I'm not much of a zucchini or mushroom fan, so i was unsure if I would like it.  Also, I didn't have white wine so I had to use chicken broth.  It was excellent!  I want to have this again and again.

Zucchini is so cheap and plentiful right now we always have it in the house. I was looking for something different and found this recipe. My husband couldn't get enough and was looking for leftovers the next day. Only things I did different was to add bread crumbs to the mixture and stuffed them raw, then baked till done.

This is a really tasty veggie dish. I'm not a fan of green onions, so I sauteed finely chopped shallots instead and that added a really nice flavor to the mushroom mix. I also took another reviewer's suggestion to add a bit of bread crumbs (1T) to give it a little crunch.

This was really good, I would make again.  I added 4 cloves of garlic and grape tomatoes right before broiling.  I also used Vegetable broth to make this a vegetarian meal.

This has become a family favorite, and has also become a pizza with a few modifications. I cook cubed chicken in the white wine (I prefer riesling) then use the same wine with a little butter to sautee the zukes, onions and mushrooms. I also use the Kraft 3 cheese blend (parma, asagio and romano) for the top. Don't boil the shells, just add some of the leftover wine/butter mix to the bottom of the dish. Wonderful!

This is a recipe that I will make over and over again.  Of course I customized it to mine and my families taste, but this is a wonderful base recipe.  The changes I made were, I didn't add the mushrooms due to a picky kid.  I added groud italian turkey sausage, a little texas 1015 onion, and bread crumbs to the veggie stuffing mixture.  I liked the white wine instead of chicken broth so that is what I used.  Also added a little grated parmesean to the mix right before stuffing the 'boats'.  I also followed the bake instead of boil the shells recommendation and it came out just fine.  Once the 'boats' were stuffed, I poured some of my homemade spaghetti sauce on top and added some italian cheese blend on the top of the sauce then baked @ 400 for 25 minutes.  My family ate every last bite!!!  Totally ROCKED!!

very delicious! i also did not boil the zucchini, and added some garlic to the mushroom stuffing.  i simmered the stuffing until all the wine had evaporated and then added some bread crumbs.  it was really really good! the stuffing was really flavorful, and added to the plain zucchini very nicely.  my boyfriend also loved it!

Best stuffed zucchini's I've made, really tasty, I just didn't boil them first. Second time made, I used less mushrooms, added some chopped garbanzo beans beans & added a small amount of leftover spicy rice. Again they were great. Nice flexible recipe.

Super tasty!  My zucs were too big to boil, so I put them in the oven with a little butter and water in them and baked until tender.  I also didn't have the parmasian cheese so I subsituted a little motza cheese.  I used canned mushrooms and used the juice from the mushrooms and added 2 chicken bullion cubes to replace the chicken broth.  Overall a great recipie!

This was my base recipe. I have homemade beef spaghetti sauce available. So I used that as stuffing but added whole wheat bread crumbs with some leftover tuna flakes and to mellow down the smell of tuna, I added some homemade pesto.

These were a hit, the only thing I did different was add some finely chopped red pepper!

This tasted wonderful, thank you so much for sharing.

Some changes we made:
-Made this a main dish using 4 good sized yellow summer squash (zucchini was in bad shape) and added 6 patties of turkey breakfast sausage.  I sauted the sausage along with the mushroom, onion, and squash filling.
-Used 2C mushroom and 2 green onions to accommodate using more squash.
-Added shaved parmesan cheese to the stuffing mixture and didn't sprinkle on top.

My husband and I both said we would make this again.  It's also wonderful for a low carb entree or side dish.
