Delish! I don't think I've made a cobbler with a brown sugar batter before, and it's yummy! This is not too sweet, a perfect balance of sweet and spice with lot's of peach flavour. This recipe is a keeper! :)

This is quite simply, the best filling for a peach cobbler I've found. I have an abundant peach tree so I make a lot of peach cobblers. I freeze my peaches and use them frozen right into the pie dish. I do use my own pie dough recipe handed down from my grandmother.

In order to get away with using 1 bowl, I made the filling first...and then dumped the ingredients into the 8" dish.  Then I made the topping.  I have never had peach cobbler, so wasn't sure what to expect...but it's like an apple pie (with peaches instead of apples) & the topping is like a muffin!  Very good!  We ate it the day after I made it, so I just microwaved each piece for 30 seconds before we enjoyed it!  Will make again :)  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I'm such a failure at making cobbler until I found this recipe! The topping was begging for pecans.  Just came out of the oven smelling heavenly and tasting that way too. Not too soupy and not to dry. I'll use this recipe again.

Excellent base recipe for a family cobbler. After I made it the first time I customized it to my family's taste buds so the second time for us I added 3/4 c sugar and 1/2 tsp salt to the batter plus I found the batter a touch thin so I also added 2 tablespoons of additional flour.  I didn't add the water to the filling as my peaches were quite juicy but I upped the flour in the filling to 2 tablespoons.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is not a pleasant recipe. Way too mushy. Followed directions as described  used perfectly sweet peaches  turned out like a pile of mushy peaches no crispy anything. Very disappointed
