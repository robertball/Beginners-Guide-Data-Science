I made this pie for Thanksgiving as something different, and it was a definate hit! The coffee is just enough to taste, but not so overpowering that those who don't like coffee won't care for the pie. I garnished wth chocolate chips before serving, looks and tastes amazing!

Made this for Recipe Group...YUM, YUM, YUM! This was super simple to make and was light and delicious to eat! I only had a reg. size graham cracker crust on hand, so I just halved the chocolate, pecans and filling ingredients (except for the cream cheese, brewed and instant coffee granules), and that was the perfect amount w/o wasting any. I used the microwave to melt the chocolate base ingredients together...about 40 seconds was all it took. Also, I used SF vanilla pudding mix and FF whipped topping, and no one could tell the diffrence, including me! My only tiny complaint was that I wish the coffee flavor was stronger, but I did use an off brand of instant, and I guess that could be why. Topped it w/ additional pecan pcs. and mini choco. chips. This was a nice ending to dinner tonight and one that I will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for recipe group. I liked the ganache/pecan base with the graham cracker crust and pudding type filling.  If I made it again I would put less pudding into the crust (too much didnt balance well with the crust and ganache) and I wouldn't mix cool whip with the pudding...and I would top with real whipped cream.  The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons Bailey's Irish cream to the pudding mixture in celebration of St Patrick's Day.  Thanks Gail for sharing your recipe.

The taste was terrific, but the pie didn't set properly for me. I fear that I probably beat the whipped topping too much.

Wonderfully delicious, this pie comes together in no time. I prepped it in the morning and let it set up until later on Thanksgiving day. A big hit, great with coffee because the sweetness is not overpowering. Definitely recommended!

I have made this 5 or 6 times now and it's always a huge hit, and always amazing. I always end up with extra chocolate, and have just started folding that into the pudding layer. If you want to add flavorings (I've tried Bailey's and hazelnut syrup) the chocolate layer is where they end up tasting the best as well. This pie is so easy and so amazing. Thanks!
