I think it should be 2/3 tsp or 2/3 tbl sugar - not 2/3 of a cup of sugar :)

There are many strawberry and spinach salads recipes but it is the dressing makes the salad. I felt this one was a bit too sweet for me although my son and husband liked it they are the sweet eaters in the house. So if you have a sweet tooth you'd like this dressing. I had some blueberries to use up so I tossed them in also.

I make a very similar salad (dressing) and the ratio is 1/2 cup sugar to 1 cup oil. It's a delicious salad that everyone loves.
