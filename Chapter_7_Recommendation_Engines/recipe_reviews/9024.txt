As written, I think it would need a little bit more zing to make it sing.   I had to make some changes based on ingredients on hand and w/that it was one of the best dishes I have ever prepared.  I only hope I can remember what I did for next time.  **It takes longer than 20 minutes to roast garlic to make it golden brown.  I have a garlic roaster and it took double time.  Only had legs so threw those in oven w/the white wine and s/p, Old Bay.  Covered and baked while the garlic was roasting.  Doubled the amt. of cheese and shredded both parm. and romano.  Sauteed onions in 1 tbsp. butter, 1tbsp. olive oil and added a couple of chopped romas, tsp fine herbs, and in lieu of 1 cup milk, used the wine from the chicken w/milk to make 1 cup.  Wine I used was sweet so it made the sauce too sweet so squeezed half a lemon and about 1/2 cup sour cream.  Made a flour slurry using some of the hot wine liquid and added to mixture to thicken.  The house smells wonderful and I wish it were not so fattening because I could eat the whole thing.  Serving over linguine.

First off I will say that that method of cooking chicken is fabulous.  It came out so tender you could barely tell that you were eating a piece of chicken.  I changed up the sauce quite a bit.  I suspected that it would be bland even with the garlic, so I sauteed 2 shallots and some crimini mushrooms in butter and set it aside just in case.  When I made the sauce, I added the flour before the milk in order to make a roux so the flour wouldn't be chunky.  Then I used 1/2 cup half-and-half and 1/2 cup nonfat milk.  I also used the whole head of garlic.  The sauce was still incredibly bland.  I added more parmesan, threw in some pecorino romano cheese, the shallot/mushroom mixture, and some salt and pepper.  I also added a little bit of the wine from the cooked chicken.  It came out pretty good.  I'd make it again, but probably only once every few months.

After reading all of the reviews, I decided that I'd have to do something to add some flavor to this dish.  So, I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, and marinated in white cooking wine and a little soy sauce, along with some salt and pepper.  After about 20 minutes, I added a few tablespoons of flour to the chicken pieces, and mixed it up.  I then sauteed the chicken pieces on a high heat until cooked.  Next, I sauteed some green onions and matsutake mushrooms in a separate pan with a tbsp. of olive oil, and a tbsp. of butter, then added the tbsp. of flour, a dash or two of salt, 1/2 cup of skim milk, a 1/2 cup of half and half, and the roasted garlic cloves.  Before the sauce came to a boil, it was thickened just right - be sure to make the sauce on a really low heat, so that it does not come to a boil, otherwise it will turn out too thick.  Lastly, I spooned the sauce mixture over the chicken, and it was ready to eat.  In the end, I think it turned out pretty good, a little time consuming, so not something I'll make on a weeknight.

Well, nobody else has mentioned this problem, so I guess I did something wrong: I could not get the flour to blend into the milk and butter. It started off as big thick lumps, and though I stirred and stirred, it made the sauce grainy. I should have followed my instincts and made a roux, then added the milk bit by bit. The end result was ok but nothing outstanding - I added more cheese because it was rather bland - and certainly not worth the unexpected effort. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway. (PS, I roasted my garlic for just under an hour)

This was delicious!  I made quite a few changes, though... to start, I did not broil the chicken in white wine... I was afraid that the alcohol would dry the chicken out by itself, so I just whisked some onion powder, oregano, italian seasoning, parsley and some lemon juice into olice oil and generously brushed the chicken breasts before putting them in the oven.  I turned them over once during cooktime and broiled for about 22 minutes.  I made the sauce by first making a roux... I know that the recipe called for something different, but I hate the taste of uncooked flour in a sauce.  Once the flour was a little browned, I slowly added the milk, whisking constantly.  I threw in double the cheese, and I used shredded rather than grated.  Once the cheese was melted, I added the garlic.  I roasted two small heads of garlic... it was perfect!  When well combined, I added a touch of salt, some fresh parsley and a TON of black pepper (I love lots of cracked black pepper in a white sauce!!).  I served it over some whole grain mix (brown rice, bulgur and cracked red wheat) and it really was a DELICIOUS meal!  My house smelled amazing and I could have just eaten the sauce!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was an excellent meal.  Although, even though it says dont be afraid to use the whole head of garlic, I didnt.  I only used about half in the recipe.  It had plenty of flavor of garlic, and I love garlic.  The whole head may have been to overpowering.  Will make again.

I had to add more spices to make this have flavor. I also sauteed the chicken in 1 tbsp of margerine/1 tbsp Olive Oil in a cast iron skillet till they were brown on both sides. Then removed them and made a cream sauce with the roasted garlic. I used a whole bulb of roasted garlic and I think it still need more for the sauce taste of garlic. I would probably use fresh garlic next time instead of roasting it.  I also added onions, dryed basil and a pinch of cayanne. After the sauce was made, I put the chicken back in the cast iron skillet covered it with foil and baked on low for about 20 minutes. Then put it on rice. it was okay, nothing special.

Hello...this was delicious! I actually only made the sauce and put it in a baked pasta dish. I was looking for something very garlic based because we LOVE garlic! I had to make changes based on what I had and because we are a gluten free family. I can't wait to make this again and neither can my husband! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!  Changes: 2 heads of garlic & roasted it for 40 minutes, 1/4 cup of Parm cheese and 1/4 cup Asiago cheese , (we love our cheese too), rice flour & stirred in some sauteed peppers and onions.

Very good! We love garlic so I used a large clove. I thought it was a fairly simple dish with alot of flavor. Might add green onions to sauce next time.

Not bad, but not great either. Overall, I thought it was a little bland. It's a good alternative to a "heavy" cream sauce, but I felt it was missing something. I might make it again and play with some different seasonings. Thank you for sharing!

I did a few things differently with the sauce. You do need to melt the butter then add the flour and mix well before you add the milk and cheese. I minced the garlic instead of roasting it which did add some flavor, but it was still bland. I added some green onions, pepper, Italian seasoning and a shake of Lawreys's season salt. It came out great! We cut the chicken into bit size pieces and served over whole grain pasta. Yum! We will definately make this again soon!

This was very good. I didn't have wine, so I simply sprinkled the chicken with seasoning salt and a bit of olive oil. Happy to have this recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I started my evening tired and not sure what to make for dinner. I ran into this recipe and decided to try it out. I am happy I did! This is the easiest sauce recipe I think I have ever come across. Needed a change on a typical school/week night. If you are tired and dont want to put much into a GOOD dinner, you should try it. I thought this was a good recipe. I did not roast my garlic however. I decided to just mince it because I like the strong garlic flavor. I added some salt, parsley flakes for color and a few twists from the pepper mill. I also decided to add some pinenuts for a little bit of crunch and flavor. I served this sauce over some baked chicken thighs, white rice and salad. It was good...I will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as directed and used the entire head of garlic.  The chicken was surprisingly moist.  I did sprinkle some salt and pepper on the chicken before broiling it.  The sauce was good, but could maybe use a little more flavor.  It was pretty light tasting as written, although we definitely still enjoyed it.

This was pretty good. As others did previously, I did make a few changes. I marinated the chicken all day in the white wine, added 2 tablespoons of italian herbs and a tablespoon of olive oil. I browned the breasts before putting them in the oven. Since others had a problem with the sauce, I sauteed some onion in the butter, then added the flour and then warm milk and cheese and roasted garlic. I heated it through but it still needed a little something so I added a couple tablespoons of white wine and some some sliced green onions and that did the trick. The chicken definitely is tender and I would make again. Thanks so much for sharing.

The ease of this recipe appealed to me, but unfortunately it came out quite bland, even with extra parmesan & the whole head of garlic.  I won't bother making it again.

I loved the recipe, my roommate thought it was great, just be careful with how long you cook the sauce as it turned out thicker than I would've liked and it didn't spread well over the pasta and chicken.

I used this recipe as a starting point for a really yummy dinner-- I don't care for broiled chicken, so I marinated my chicken in white wine & garlic and grilled it.  I also added white wine to the sauce with the milk.  Served with pasta and broccoli w/ sauce overall.  The roasted garlic has such a good flavor!  The sauce also reheats well, which is rare for a cream sauce.

I thought this was really good! I'd never roasted garlic before, and now I wonder why, it was so easy! Next time, I will add more seasonings, though.

This is delicious.  I added a handful of chopped ripe (black) olives to the sauce at the time when the parsley is added, too.  No question that I'll make this again.

This is such a yummy sauce and is definitely a keeper!  (The only substitute I made was I used cornstarch instead of flour.) It would also taste good with shrimp or scallops over linguine.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe had a lot of flavor. I did marinate the chicken for about 30 minutes in white wine, italian seasoning and minced garlic.  The sauce was very good with the chicken and could be used with other dishes.  Thanks for the recipe.

The sauce was delicious and this meal was very easy to make.  I did make a few changes.  I added a splash of wine to the sauce and used a bit of Italian seasoning since I did not have parsley.  I also used minced garlic (sauteed) instead of a fresh whole head.  
Instead of the splash of wine with the chicken, I marinated the chicken in white wine, olive oil, a splash of chicken stock, and Italian seasoning for about 30 minutes.  I cooked the chicken as the recipe directed in the marinade.  This made the chicken really tender and flavorful.  
I served over brown rice with asparagus.

This was really great with a few modifications. #1 at the very least use a high quality parmesan such a parmigiano reggiano. That is where the most flavor will come from. Other tips bake the garlic at least 45 mins so that it really softens and bake the chicken at the same time. No need to take the extra step to broil. I took anothers advice and sprinkled some old bay seasoning on top for added flavor.Ymmm Also I made a rue instead of following the directions. I even used only 1/2% milk and it came out nice and thick like I wanted. I had green onions ready and waiting for extra flavor but did not need them since I used good cheese. I will surely make this again!

This was absolutely wonderful.  My husband said it tasted like something gourmet!!  First time he's ever said that!  Anyway I had fresh garlic on hand so I used that and while washing off the dirt I slipped it out of the skin. I didn't know if that was going to ruin it or not but it didn't.  I then rubbed in oil, wrapped in foil and put it in the oven for 20 minutes and it came out perfect!  I ended up just slicing it into little chunks.  I didn't use parsley and just put the cheese in it until I thought it looked like enough.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk because I had it on hand and wanted to use it.  Probably why it tasted so good.  A lot of people said that this was too bland and so I decided to cook it in butter, season all, and pepper right on the stove.  And let me tell you... it turned out awesome!  Served it with broccoli and bow tie pasta.  This is going to be used a lot.

This dish was amazing! I did make some changes however. #1...I "fried" the chicken breasts in a little olive oil and butter, and seasoned them with dried oregano, garlic powder, salt & pepper. I didn't think that baking them with just white wine would taste the way I wanted it. #2...I doubled the sauce recipe (it wouldn't have been nearly enough for me, my husband & 17mo old son if I hadn't) and used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 heavy cream, which made it more fattening, but creamier, I think. I also minced the garlic before adding it to the sauce. I served the sauce over the chicken and some brown rice. It was delicious. The only thing other thing I would say is that the sauce does needs salt added. Other than that it is simple, easy and delicious. My husband & son loved it too!

Funny that I didn't think this was bland, when it's usually me who thinks stuff is more bland than everyone else. :-)  I made it as is and liked it quite well.  (Though it didn't wow me or anything.)  This is the first time I've attempted to roast garlic and didn't think this turned out too well.  I tried to time this all out and had to just dump the garlic into the sauce before it over-cooked. Now I see Caroline (love the cats) says it won't roast in 20 minutes. Well, I thought that was a pain anyway, so maybe I'll just reduce the amount and make it an unroasted garlic sauce. LOL. I put the chicken on rice and poured the sauce over everything. It's definitely nicer looking than "bare" chicken.

Very yummy. I enjoyed cooking the entire garlic head! It was my first time doing so - I thought it was somewhat tedious getting the garlic out of the head afterward, but hey, the end result was the same! The sauce was a hit in my household, kinda thought it was a bit grainy but overall very good. I liked the broiled chicken! Will definitely do that again.

This recipe is so good!  Even my toddler enjoys it!  I added crimini mushrooms to the sauce and it tastes just like something I've had at a restaurant (even regular button mushrooms were great in this recipe).

I made this for my boyfriend, mom and sister and they loved it.  I used half and half low fat instead of milk and added wine in the sauce.  I combined this with parmesan asparagus from this site.  My boyfriend thought asparagus from the can was good.

An easy and delightful dish, without the overpowering Parmesan flavor of a typical Alfredo, and roasting the garlic gives it a nice mellowness. I didn't have any parsley on hand, so I used Cilantro instead. Goes well with hearty-nutty flavor of wild rice.

This recipe was very tasteful. The sauce, I thought, was delicious. However, to give the chicken for flavoring, I marinated it in white wine then dipped it in garlic and onion seasoned flour and sauteed it with butter until crisp. It came out delicious.

I added mushrooms and took the chicken (which I chopped up into bite size pieces) and white wine and added it to the sauce after cooking.  I put this on farfalle (bowties) and loved it.

Unbelievable good!  If you let the sauce sit for a few minutes before serving the garlic flavor really seeps into it.  We put it on asphargus and long grain and wild rice and it was amazing.

This recipe saved the day. After a year and a half of trying to convince my "Iron Chef" boyfriend that I am able to do more than boil water, this recipe blew him away. We absolutely loved it, and will definitely make it again. I felt it could have used a little bit of salt, but he liked it just the way it was. It didn't taste anything like alfredo.

Not bad, but I wasn't that impressed.  Tasted a lot like alfredo.  I should have guessed that though by the ingredients.  Was expecting more, but still not bad.

Wow! I was surprised how easy this recipe was. The roasted garlic in the sauce makes the meal. I served this with mashed potatoes and used the sauce as a gravy. Adults and kids alike loved it. Definitely a "keeper" in our house!

I didn't have any white wine, so I used vermouth to broil the chicken. I used whole wheat flour in the sauce, and added a liberal amount of freshly ground black pepper to it. Served on whole grain brown rice. Delicious!

I played around a little bit with the sauce and used half-and-half instead of milk.  It would have been really good except that I cooked it a little too long and it thickened too much.  Otherwise, this was great.  I used the sauce over penne.

I was laying in bed this morning thinking, how can I make a sauce with roasted garlic? Well I really thought of the garlic, flower, milk, parsley, I thought would this work. so I decided to go onto allrecipes.com and see if anything like this was out there. and I found this! I didn't have any chicken so I made the sauce and I only had Penne pasta.   When I added the parmesan to the recipe it made it all come together. Thank you so much for your recipe I love it! I can't wait to make it with the chicken!  Thank You!

My family ABSOLUTELY LOVED the sauce. They said it made the dish taste special. 
I did not use as much parsley as the recipe suggested. 
If your family likes using sauce ... I would suggest doubling the sauce recipe. 
My family literally wiped the bowl clean. 
They loved it on the rice as well.

Pretty much made this as per the recipe but added some chopped mushrooms sautéed in butter. And a dash of white wine to the sauce as well. Didn't follow others comments and had to make the sauce a second time as On medium it thickened way too fast. The sauce is AMAZING! Definitely worth the second try! I'm fighting the urge to stand at the stove and eat it with a spoon! Thanks so much will for sure be making again!
PS Did I mention I don't like chicken thighs? They were fantastic cooked this way :)

After reading all the reviews about this recipe being bland, I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegar, basil, oregano and garlic. Then I sauteed some onion in butter (mushrooms would have been good too but I didn't have any) and added that to the sauce along with extra parmesan cheese, crushed red pepper, sea salt, and rosemary. My husband said it was good but I thought it was just ok. I may make this again and try more modifications.

My husband had cooked some chicken breasts in butter and garlic and then told me to finish dinner! HA! So, I ran in and typed in Garlic Sauces and found this and it just looked lovely.  So, I made it and it was great.  I too put the chicken over brown rice and then covered it all in this sauce.  I made the sauce as directed, using FRESH parmesan cheese, and whole wheat flour (rather than white flour), and since I didn't have any cloves of garlic, I used a full Tbsp. of pre-minced refrigerated garlic.  It was great.  As directed, it was plenty for myself, my husband and my 3 young boys (ages 7, 5, and 1 1/2).  I think I'll play around with it a little, but its yummy as is too.  Thank you so much! You saved dinner tonight! :)

I loved this recipe! I added some mushroom and red pepper to the dish and i used soy milk because i was cooking for someone who is lactose intolerant. Still the recipe turned out excellent!

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Pretty bland, and I don't want to work out a bunch of changes to make it great.

My girlfriend made me this meal after a long day at work and it hit the spot! I do agree that it was a little bland but I usually find this to be a positive since you may cater it to your own tastes. She did this by adding sauteed red peppers which made it perfect. Almost ate the leftovers while doing dishes! Can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow.

I love this sauce, and I use it over fish quite often.  Nice subtle garlic flavor, not too overpowering because its roasted.

I thought this was bland. I did change the recipe slighty. I sauteed the chicken in pieces instead of broiled it and incorporated the wine into the sauce. I would season it up a little more.

Very easy to make and very tasty! Instead of serving the sauce over rice or pasta, I poured it over the chicken for a nicer (less "boring" looking) presentation of the chicken.  Served with oven-roasted potatoes.

I loved the sauce, but I thought the chicken was really bland.  I think I'll try it next time with pasta instead of the rice.  Again, the sauce was really terrific.

I'm not that crazy about a cream sauce on rice but my son loved it!.My wife thought it was good too. I tried it a couple of ways. Change half the parm cheese with old cheddar and/or use vermouth on the chicken 8-).
