This was very rich and decadent, so I will not be making this often.  The flavor was excellent and I did not think the coffee flavor was too much, even though I used espresso powder!  I did have some problems with the directions. I could not get the butter and cocoa powder to combine, and wondered if the directions should have read to combine the butter with the sugar.  Despite the wonderful taste, the finished product had small lumps of butter that I could not beat in, and the sugar never dissolved, leaving a grainy texture to the dessert.

This was awesome.  I made it for a lunch I was having with friends and served it with strawberries and cream (it's too rich on its own) and I was asked for the recipe... brilliant.

I agree - it does have a strong coffee flavor. But that's fine with me, I love coffee!
