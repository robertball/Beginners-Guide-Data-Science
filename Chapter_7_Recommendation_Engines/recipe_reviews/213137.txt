It does need a little more flavor.  I added rosemary to mashed potatoes and also the egg/milk mixture. I also was out of evap milk, so just used regular milk. Took longer to cook but tasted great.

Made as directed, except no Cheddar cheese so used Mozzella instead. Prep time was 45 min, baking time 63 min. Quiche tasted great, but could have used more flavor. Next time will try small cubed or thinly sliced ham in mixture. We ate as a full meal, not a side dish. Thanks Bird1114 for sharing  this recipe.

It tasted good, however it had no resemblance to a quiche. It was not eggy and the small amount of egg that there was took at least an extra half hour to set. I would try a different recipe if you're looking for quiche. If you're looking for something that tastes good, go for it.

Not at all what I expected. I should have realised this was not for me when I saw evaporated milk in the ingredients list. There should be some warning that this is a sweet quiche and not a vegetable quiche as we know it.
