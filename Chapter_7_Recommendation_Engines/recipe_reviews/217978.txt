There was a bit of preparation involved, but it was worth it!  This recipe makes me think of Floribbean cuisine but not spicy.  Thanks for the recipe Chef Eden!

Awesome recipe for chicken! The sweet and tangy was a great taste, especially because the sugars from the sugar and whiskey carmalized. Didn't have chicken breasts, so used skinless thighs. Came out great!

Awesome recipe !! I made half of the sauce for marinating. For the other half, I cut the peaches and mangoes up, mixed them with the other ingredients, and warmed them up on the stove to pour over my chicken, when serving.  I also added some red pepper slivers for some more color.I baked these in the oven. My Husband loved it !!!!!!

This recipe was okay. I think it would be better with the fruit sitting on top in chunks, like a fruit salsa.

I had some peaches that needed to be used up so I left out the mango.  I added a bit more sugar and a little taco seasoning just to help tie the flavor to my side dish.  Not having a grill I browned the breasts in a skillet then poured in the remaining marinade over all, brought to a boil and cooked until done.  Really great flavor and so easy.

I only had honey beam on hand so the bourbon flavour wasn't really there. I won't use it the next time. I used this on chicken wings and baked them in the oven. With a better bourbon and longer marinating time it would be 5 stars.
