4.29.18  We love potato salad, all kinds of potato salad, and we enjoyed this one today.  Three ingredients really enhance this potato saladâ€™s flavor:  bacon, dill and horseradish, the last of which I will increase in the future.  The rest of the ingredients are fairly typical for a mayo-based potato salad, but that horseradish really makes it distinct.  jandeli, thanks for sharing your recipe

6-21-2019 ~Given the high hopes I had for this because of the wonderful assembly of ingredients, especially the bacon and horseradish, this ended up being just okay for me.  My disappointment can be summed up in just a few words: too much vinegar, too little horseradish.  Hopefully it will improve after sitting in the fridge for awhile.  As is, even after adding considerably more horseradish, this fell flat.

This is a wonderful take on potato salad. I'm not a big fan of mayo so the mix with sour cream is tasty and the addition of horseradish takes this another step up. Thanks!

Love love love!  Used green onions instead of red. Bacon could be left out for vegetarians but is great in there.

Was looking for this recipe for a while.  Use green onions instead of the red.  Nice change of pace from the usual potato salad.

Excellent, tangy potato salad. The hubby and I loved the horseradish.  I wouldn't change a thing. I think tomorrow this salad will be even better once the flavors meld.
