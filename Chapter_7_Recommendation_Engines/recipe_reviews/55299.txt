This was the first time I made fudge, and it was great!
Instead of an 8x8" dish, I used a 9x13" pan and, after it cooled, used small holiday cookie cutters to cut the fudge in fun shapes.  Makes a great gift for coworkers and friends!

I made this for my friend's birthday and it was a hit! Everyone couldn't stop eating it. This was my first time making fudge and it was very easy. I wasn't able to find Reese's Peanut Butter and Milk Chocolate Chips, so I used Nestle Toll House Peanut Butter and Milk Chocolate Morsels and it was fine.
    And today I used Ghiradelli Classic White Chips instead to make white fudge. It came out yummy.

This is the easiest fudge recipe ever. Very quick and easy to clean up. The first batch I made was slightly too sweet so I only used 1 cup of sugar for the second batch. Everyone loved it!

I personally found the taste a little "bland" for fudge.  Certainly NOT the best I've ever made.

The consistency was good, but the taste was not as great as I had hoped.

The fudge tasted great! It was very easy to make. The best part was the easy cleanup. You just pull the fudge/foil out of the 8 x 8 pan, and then the pan is clean or ready to use for storing the fudge.
I would make sure to cut the fudge out within a few hours. I made 2 batches, and the second batch cut easier when I cut it about 2 hours after setting it in the fridge.

So yummy! Has the perfect consistency. We loved it, but wanted more of a chocolatey taste, so next time we will add some extra chocolate chips and use less of the peanut butter chips. Easy to make, but you do have to stir for quite a while. Yummy!

Great great great! Needed to use up some ingredients, so I gave it a try. Everyone liked it, and the only think I added was some extra peanut butter- cause I am obsessed with it!
