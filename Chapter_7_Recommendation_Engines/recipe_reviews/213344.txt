Simple to make, rich to taste!  I like the idea of using rye flour!  Great cookies!

I made this for my fitness students as a gluten free option for a Saint Patrick's Day treat.  It was more popular than regular shortbread.  I didn't modify the recipe and it was wonderful!  Crunchy and not overly sweet.  Try it and it might become your favorite shortbread cookie recipe!!  I'm going to make it again for Easter because I've had so many requests to bring it back as a treat after a hard workout.

Made this good the first day. Got dry and hard on day 2 even in a storage bag.
