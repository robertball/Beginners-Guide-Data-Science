This recipe was fabulous.  The meat was so tender but of course with this cut of meat a little fatty.  The flavor was wonderful and a little bit of the sauce served over white rice made a quick and yummy dinner.  Definately would make again.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. Mine didn't come out as tender as I'd hoped-I think next time I'll try them in the slow cooker.

The sauce is just great. I think I'll try it on some other cuts of meat! I am new to using boneless rib meat and mine came out a little tough. I love the idea of it so much I am going to try it again!

Delicious!  The sauce smells soooo good while it's cooking.  Ribs came out very tender.  I didn't have tomato juice, so I used a "Spicy Hot V8" and omitted the hot sauce.  Would make this again.

The people who said to put these in a slow cooker were probably right. I didn't have time to leave them all day cooking. They were a bit dried out and tough. I also had to adjust the sauce, as it was really too hot for my taste. We added some brown sugar and honey and it mellowed out the heat a bit. By slow cooking and adjusting the sauce down a notch, I'm betting this recipe would earn 5 stars.

This recipe was VERY yummy! I used the exact ingredients and broiled the meat on both sides for 20 minutes. I dumped the sauce and meat into a crock pot and let it run on low for 8 hours. SO GOOD!

I needed a receipe to cook my ribs in a short time frame and this one worked wonders! My meat was nice and tender and my family loved it.  I made my own BBQ sauce though.  I will make my ribs like this again if I am making them on a short notice.

I made this last night. Follow other reviewers, I browned the meat and cooked them in slow cooker for 8 hrs in low setting and they were very tender.  I used short ribs with bones. I omitted the clove.  I used gravy separator to take out the fat and served them with mashed potatoes. I only put about Â½ tsp of hot sauce because my daughter does not like spicy food. I did not have onion so I used onion flakes. Definitely will make this again.

I love the flavors. Wonderful with gnocchi. I added a bit of garlic and red wine to give the sauce some depth. Next time i will also add mushrooms and put the broiled ribs and the sauce in the slow cooker for several hours to make the ribs more tender.

This is delicious. Thank you for sharing. What I did different:
I used about 8 ounces (because that's all I had left) of garlic & onion jarred tomato sauce, about 1.5 cups of V-8, 1 tsp molasses, omitted the ground clove, 2 tbs chopped parsley, added more cinnamon and gave it 4 healthy squirts of Sriracha instead of hot sauce. Came out great. Yummy.

My hubby would not let me share the leftovers of this dish with our family who live nearby!  That should say it all.  He loved this, and so I did, too!  The only thing I did different was to leave off the cloves (personal preference).  I cooked it in my Magnalite pan in the oven for about 3 hours after the broiling process.  The meat was tender and very delicious!  Thanks, Rebelmom!

My family absolutely loved this recipe! I followed the recipe ingredients to the "T". But I used a slow cooker on low for 8 hours so it would be ready for when I got home from work. We used the juice to put on top of the mashed potatoes.  This was so easy to make. Thanks so much for sharing! I will definately make this again and again.

This was very good and very easy to make.  I didn't have any vegetable juice so I used a can of tomato soup.  It seemed just fine.  As recommended by others, I put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours and added a bit of brown sugar.  Served it over rice and my family made loads of yummy noises and went back for seconds.

Needs a little tweaking, but it's pretty good. Ingredients were exactly as written. Maybe cut down or omit the cider vinegar, add some honey and/or brown sugar next time.  The hot sauce probably just added flavor, hardly any heat - don't be afraid of using it.

Really good recipe, my family liked it! During prep, I only broiled for 10 minutes, so the meat wouldn't overcook. I used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, and I added 1/4 cup of red wine for a heartier sauce. I thought it unusual there was no salt in the recipe, but it came out great without it (I didn't tell my husband there was no salt added!). I'd make it again! Thanks!

This is so easy and so great!!!  When I first made this, I followed it to a "T" and it was amazing!!! I love how clean up is a breeze and the house smells terrific. The only thing I changed when I made it again, is I only used about a pound of short ribs and cut them smaller so I didn't broil them as long (maybe 8 minutes) Sometimes I've added mushrooms m, oh, and do yourself a favor and do this with pork loin chops! You don't even have to sear them first, just make the sauce and cook less time (usually about 30 minutes depending on the cut of the chop, I used a meat thermometer to know when they were done. It is sooooo tasty!!!

Recipe does not tell you to cover short ribs or have them uncovered when finish in oven. 
I added fresh garlic to sauce and a touch of brown sugar, I also preferred to add my own hot sauce rather then Frank's hot sauce.

I use  a jar of Emeril's Chunky Marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce & juice.  A whole day in the crockpot makes this dish awesome!
