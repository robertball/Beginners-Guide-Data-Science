Yummy ribs! I spruced this recipe up quite a bit to achieve my desired results. I omitted using the oil/searing the ribs. I seasoned the ribs w/ onion/garlic powder, seasoned salt and roasted them @ 300 degrees in a pan covered tightly w/ foil for 2 hours. Then I drained off all the fat, mixed up the sauce and added honey, brown sugar, and a couple of squirts of our favorite BBQ sauce to it. I then poured ½ of that over the ribs baked it covered it and baked it for 30 min, uncovered it poured on the remaining sauce and baked uncovered at 350 degrees. They were tear away from the bone tender and extremely flavorful! With all those changes I still give credit to the recipe, it's a great one!

I chose this recipe because I didn't have time for marinating or boiling.  I wanted something quick and easy.  These turned out great.  I couldn't believe how tender the ribs were.  The only thing I did differently was at the end, like last 20 minutes - I brushed on my favorite BBQ sauce (Stubs), and then broiled them for the last 5 minutes to get the BBQ saude baked on to them.
Delicious!

I was very happy to find this recipe- too cold to grill outside, but my family loves barbeque ribs. This was a good how-to-cook-oven-ribs recipe and the three other ingredients were a good jumping off point for creating a very sweet and gooey barbeque sauce. I made more sauce on the stove top (ketchup, brown sugar, ginger, vinegar, worchestershire sauce, ground mustard, a little splash of coca cola) for dipping. All in all a good recipe that yields tender ribs. I will experiment with different flavors next time.
*** 02/03/07 Tried this with 3 pounds of bone in chicken breasts. DELICIOUS!

Great base recipe. I changed things due to preference - seasoned the ribs with salt, pepper, garlic, dry mustard, cumin, paprika and red pepper. My husband seared the rack of ribs on the grill for 10 minutes each side, then I put them into the oven for 2 hours wrapped in foil, removed and added sweet baby rays bbq sauce mixed with horseradish and cooked for another hour.  Very easy to do in the oven and I appreciate the help because I had no idea how to prepare ribs in the house! :)

This was a great alternative to grilling when you want barbq and it's FREEZING cold outside!!  In addition to the diet coke and ketchup, I skipped the ginger, and added some brown sugar, honey mustard, worcestershire sauce, and horseradish, along with some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cajun seasonings!  Wonderful dish!

I rated this "the best" because it really is if you factor in ease of preparation, tenderness and taste. I usually like to "tweak" recipes I make often and may choose to do so with this as well but the basic cooking method described (with cola base) worked beyond expectations.

Ribs came out nicely.  I did not have any ginger so it was not used, added a bit of honey and molasses to the coke and ketchup.  I did season the ribs before browning with garlic and onion powder and I used a bit of Mrs Dash® garlic and herb seasoning and black pepper.  I baked the ribs for 1½ hours covered, and then poured of the grease and sauce, I added some Sweet Baby Ray's® BBQ sauce, and baked them the remaining ½ hour uncovered.  They were fall off the bone and finger licking good.

8-3-2017
Today for my birthday I made these again.  I did not have cola this time.  I used Cherry Dr Pepper.      I also added a thinly sliced onion to the ribs.  I also had the ground ginger this time.  After I browned them I put them in my dutch oven and poured the sauce and onions over them, Then I put them covered in a 300 degree oven, I baked them 3½ hours, then I added some Sweet Baby Ray's to the ribs and baked them uncovered for ½ hour more.  MMMMMMMMMMMMM they were so good.

My boyfriend, who hates bbq sauce, loved this. I am a fan of bbq sauce, and just thought that it was ok--not bad, but not knock your socks off great. I loved how easy this recipe was to prepare.

Great EASY, FAST recipe!  I had about 5 1/2 lbs of meat and doubled everything and turned out great!  My hubbie is a rib person and he said it was great too.  I did baste some bbq sauce at the end just for a little color and flavor (I didn't think there was going to be enough flavor).  Still great.  Thanks!!

I need to start off by saying that I did not use the sauce recipe, however, I followed the cooking instructions.  The ribs were FANTASTIC! I substituted a bottle of my favorite BBQ sauce, and it was great. I covered my ribs with sauce before placing in oven, drained liquid after 2 hrs of cooking.  I basted the ribs with BBQ sauce, and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. Ribs were so tender! Don't skip browning the ribs in the beginning...I think it made a big difference. Thanks for the great recipe, it was so easy! I will definitely make again!

These are reallymoist and tender! I used EMRILS ESSENCE to season the ribs and then seared on the grill on high heat for a couple minutes each side. I then used my broiler pan with some water in the bottom and put the ribs on the vented tray and covered with SWEET BABY RAY'S. I then used foil to make a tent so it could steam while it cooked for a couple hours. when done , I put some more BBQ sauce on it and put under the broiler for a few minutes to carmelize the BBQ sauce. Fell off the bone goodness!

These were very good. I used country style pork ribs. And the only soda I had was diet dr. pepper, gave the recipe a hint of cherry. I also added a dash of liqued smoke

I used diet cola so I added 1/3 cup brown sugar to cola/ketchup/ginger mixture.  Before browning the ribs, I sprinkled paprika, onion salt, ground black paper, and garlic powder on both sides.

Was ok but the sauce was very runny.  Tried to thicken up with cornstarch.  The favour was so-so, next time I would add more garlic, brown sugar, for more flavour.  The ribs were however very tender.

This was so easy and so yummy! I had no soda, so used beer instead and it was so good. The butcher advised I get the babyback ribs and that was excellent advice. He said that the slow-cook method is great, but also said that he has cooked his ribs (covered the whole time) at 500 degrees. I used my great-grandmother's huge cast iron skillet with the lid and it took much less time (as you would expect). Fast or slow, you can't go wrong! Lee

Amazing recipe.  I changed the sauce up some to my liking by removing ginger and using crushed garlic along with onion powder and cumin.  Tasted the sauce before putting over meat and was amazing!

Tonight was the first time I've served ribs for dinner and this recipe was good.  The original recipe is a bit too ketchup-y for me but with some BBQ sauce for the last 30 minutes it was delicious.  Will definitely make it again!

Exceptional. The only thing that I did differently was marinate them overnight in vinegar, white onions, and garlic. The meat was tender and so juicy. Excellent recipe.

So simple and tasty!  I followed the suggestion to season the meat with salt, pepper, and cajun before browning.

I was so surprised at how tender the ribs were!  I followed others' advice and seasoned ribs before browning, and then added my own BBQ sauce in the last 30 minutes.  A keeper!

These were by far the easiest ribs to prepare. They came out fall off the bone tender. 
I am sorry to say that my pickie eatter didn't go for them but the rest of the family enjoyed them, even my husband.
They even taste better the next day.

This is another great rib recipe that I have found on this sight. The ribs were GREAT! I did use one reviewer suggestion to slather my favorite sauce on during the last 30 min of cooking. The ribs were so good I almost bit my tounge!

I gave this recipe 5 stars for the method of cooking the ribs, not the sauce. You can use any sauce you want, homemade, or store bought, but make sure to mix it with the coke. These ribs are so tender and if someone didn't know they weren't BBQ'd they wouldn't know. The ribs must be browned first, that is the key. I cooked them in the juices to keep them from drying out. I  baked them a couple hours, and then removed the foil, drained them, covered them with straight BBQ sauce, and popped them back in for about half an hour. My son, who had requested them, loved them, and he was expecting BBQ'd ones. I recommend making them in a non-stick pan as they are quite messy, and the sauce can be hard to clean off. We will be making these again, it gets quite cold up here and we don't always want to go out the use the BBQ.

Awesome recipe! Bought a rack of ribs for the grill but the weather turned out bad. This recipe saved the weekend! The only thing I did different was marinate the ribs in soy sauce and rice vinegar for 4 hours before cooking. After cooking for an hour and a half the meat was falling off the bones!

Super moist, fall of the bone goodness. I changed up the spices for our taste. The browning of the ribs is the key that gives them that outside grill flavor. The
Only thing I would different,I would use baby back ribs to eliminate some of the grease. I also added our
Favorite BBQ sauce at the end. Thank you for sharing

Delicious and easy. Didn't have ginger, so we skipped it and didn't really miss it. Replaced the ketchup with BBQ sauce to great effect.

I prepare every meal in our house..on the weekends I look for complicated recipes, the incorporate multi-steps...This recipe is one of the best spare rib ones that I have come across..That accomplishes tender meat pulling ribs in the oven...I did one rack cut in half...one that I put the BBQ sauce on the other plan from the coke brazing...The BBQ sauce is key in this recipe...the meat plain is tender and somewhat sweet...I pulled the meat out at 90 minutes and poured out all the liquid then applied the sauce....It was just excellent beyond belief....I will make sure to do this one again many times!

found some ribs in the back of the freezer from who knows how long ago. was worried they'd be too freezer burnt to eat. your cooking method gets 500 stars. wow these were perfectly tender! as for the sauce, i didn't like the flavor of the ingredients so i dumped a bunch of whatever bbq sauce i had in the house in a saucepan with the other ingredients and cooked it down a bit before pouring it over the ribs. then continued to cook it down while the ribs were baking. sauce ended up delicious as did the ribs! thank you!!

Better if you season the ribs first with salt, pepper and cajun seasoning! Really quick and easy though and the family loved them. Will definitely make again and again...

The ribs were fantastic. I think they would be great as is. I didn’t have enough ketchup so I added a bit of barbecue sauce and liquid smoke. When I fried ribs I made sure it carmalized. I played around with oven time. Personally follow the time that they say.

I used this recipe for my first time making ribs. They were delicious & I made a few adjustments. I cut the sauce recipe in half and poured that over the ribs after searing and before baking. As soon as the ribs were done in the oven I poured Sweet Baby Rays (personal favorite) on top. These ribs were juicy, tender, and fell right off the bone. I will definitely be cooking ribs like this in the future.

Terrific recipe. I cooked two racks meat side down at 300. After one hour, I flipped them, basted them and recovered them with the heavy duty foil. At two hours, I basted them again, took the foil off for 35 minutes to brown them further. I didn't brown them before cooking as the liquid level was below the top of the ribs and browning would occur (Maillard reaction) naturally anyway. Next time, I will use half the amount of sauce since I ended up with "too much" sauce. These are wonderful and are going into regular rotation of recipes. I did not change a thing, other than temperature and I had already learned with my electric oven to do this from a prior recipe. Thank you for sharing! :)

I really liked this one. So easy. Followed the ingredients using root beer.  - 
I put foil on bottom of pan overhanging sides. Placed in meat, poured in sauce, and covered with wax paper (keeps in moisture) then folded over ends of foil to seal.  Turned spareribs at halfway point and drained juices into pan and thickened for rice.  Turned again and removed foil & wax paper 30 min from end.  Will reuse this recipe many many times....

Didn't know you could do ribs in the oven.  They came out good. I didn't do the oil thing instead I basted the ribs with apple juice and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon ,I didn't know there cinnamon mixed with the brown sugar, wrapped them in foil and did the 325 for 2 hours.  Appreciate the efforts and thanks again!

Yum!
This was my first time making ribs and they are so good! I threw some worstershie sauce into the sauce. I also rubbed a salt, seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper, brown sugar, and onion powder mixture onto my beef ribs and let it sit in the fridge for two hours before I cooked it. The sauce called for ginger, which I didn't have, so I used cinnamon and I threw in some onions, mushrooms, and cloves of garlic. Then I took my ribs out and drizzled some sauce on it before browning it. Threw it in my pan and drizzled the sauce all over. I also put a pan of water on the bottom rack to make sure the ribs didn't lose moisture (they didn't!). Cooked for two hours followed by half an hour with bbq sauce on it, covered, and then and additional 20 with more sauce uncovered. Delicious fall off the bone ribs! The mushrooms taste excellent as well!
Thanks for sharing!

Last night was the first time I'd ever made ribs (sad, considering I've lived my whole life in Texas!). My college-aged daughter, her fiancé, a couple of their friends, and my 25-year-old son ate with us. I was tired, so I cooked dinner, then headed to bed, leaving them to put away leftovers. To my surprise, there were hardly any!
I followed the suggestion to bake the ribs for a course hours instead of braising them. I also followed a couple other posted ideas...I doubled the recipe, seasoned the ribs with onion & garlic powder, herb blend, and paprika, baked them tightly covered at 300* F for 2 hours, drained off the fat, then mixed the sauce. I added 1/2 the sauce and baked covered for  30 minutes, then added remaining sauce and finished baking uncovered for about 45 minutes until they were done. I made the sauce from 2 cans cola, 2 cops low carb ketchup, not quite 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, and a couple Tablespoons of honey. I served the ribs with baked beans, broccoli slaw (added a squirt or two of honey to the pre-made dressing, corn on the cob, watermelon, and my daughter brought warm brownies with vanilla ice cream. 
There are few things that make me as happy as feeding a group of college kids and having no leftovers to put away!!!!!

I ran out of ginger and used garlic instead. Worked, still pretty good.

4 stars only because of the grease that was left in the dish when finished. I had no cola bev and no ground ginger but I did have ginger beer, I also added 3-4 tbl spoons of creamy honey.

Had this last night and we all really liked it! Next time I think I will "spice up" the sauce just a little, but overall very good and a keeper for us!

My 3 & 4 yr old kids Loved this recipe! They cleaned the bones, and they are both very picky eaters.
I dry rubbed before searing with S&P, and I sautéed a chopped onion and added it to the Pepsi/ ketchup mixture.
Oh, and I left out the ginger.
A definite hit in my home!!

This recipe was perfect for what I was looking for!  I didn't have time to put them in the crock pot or to grill them.  I liked that I only had to spice the ribs to my preference and then sear them for 5-10 min per side on my flat grill pan that I have for the stove. During this time, I mixed together all the ingredients as mentioned above except for the ginger (I didn't have any- I did add a dash of prepared mustard).  After the searing process, I threw them in the oven wrapped in foil and placed them in a large pan.  I left them in the oven for 2 hours and removed the foil for the last 10 minutes.  These came out great and the meat fell off the bone.  I ate them as is!  My husband added his favorite Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to them. He said this recipe is a keeper!  He didn't even want to know how I cooked them...just to do it again! :)

*The seasonings I used before searing was salt, pepper, garlic powder, beef rub, paprika and red pepper. Very easy to do in the oven and I was able to do things around the house while they were cooking.  Perfect for a busy mom like me!

Very easy and quick receipe for when it is pouring down rain outside.  Only change other pepper and salt was that I used Dr. Pepper as the beverage and grated up fresh ginger to use in it.  Great and Easy

This is a really great way to make oven ribs!  I don't use the marinade directions, I concoct my own & have made mouth-watering, extremely tender ribs with this method many times.  Never a complaint & several pounds of ribs get consumed in just a few days!

These were super easy and everyone seemed to like them.  I did one rack exactly by the recipe and I put some Stubb's on another rack.  I thought the ones without the Stubbs were bland, but the kids loved them.  The meat was falling right off the bones.

This was perfect since it was snowing and I didn't want to go outside. I also added my favorite bbq sauce 20 mins before it was finished. Very tender perfectly cooked. :)

Best ribs I have ever made, probably the best I've tasted.  I was looking for a recipe without garlic or a lot of spices as my hubby has a sensitive tummy. These were incredibly simple and fell off the bone after 2 1/2 hours in the oven. Will definitely make these often!
