It was the best curry ever!
Somewhere between korma and tikka masala.
Creamy but spicy.
But I do have one advice for anyone who is interested, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ADD MORE SPICES!! I have made my own curry powder and I have marinaded chicken over night prior to cooking.
Here is my curry powder recipe, two servings, ENJOY!!!

3tsp Cilantro/Coriander powder
4tsp Cumin
1/2tsp Very hot chilli powder
1/2tsp Chopped ginger
1/2tsp Chopped garlic
1tsp Garlic powder
2tsp Sugar
2tsp Mixed spice (Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Ginger, Cloves, Dill seeds, Coriander)
1tsp Turmeric
2tsp Paprika powder

While I didn't follow this faithfully, the results were unbelievable.

I had no fresh mango, so I went to the freezer and used a tropical fruit mix I use for smoothies, which had papaya, mango, and pineapple.

I also used half a sweet onion in place of the shallots and added sliced red bell pepper and snow peas and let them simmer in the sauce with the chicken for about ten minutes.

I did not add any seasonings, but also was fairly heavy handed with the curry paste. The balance of sweet with spicy was really, really delightful. This is going to be in the regular rotation at our house!

I made a few changes.  My family really loved this and ate the whole double batch in one setting.  I had to use frozen mangoes and light coconut milk (what I had in pantry).  I sauteed half an onion with 1 garlic clove before adding the chicken, then sprinkled garam masala on the chicken while cooking.  I added 1 T of curry powder.  For garnish bowl, I chopped green onions and mixed them with leftover marinated cucumbers, drained and chopped (marinated in spicy vinegar).

I think this is a fantastic, and very fast, easy recipe with restaurant quality results. I used a Thai red curry paste instead of Indian. I was able to cook it while chatting and it did not take a lot of concentration.....The secret is in the fresh mangos. Let them ripen fully. Plan on buying them a week ahead of making this recipe and put them in a cool cabinet to ripen (don't leave them in plastic). This was even better after sitting for a day and being reheated.

I had to alter the recipe a bit myself, but the outcome was very very delicious! I didn't have any cury paste in my pantry, so I used spicy cury powder instead. I started off with frying onions, the added the chicken and curry powder (also put in red peppers). I then added the puree, and stirred in more curry powder to taste. Also, I added salt to taste. It was excellent, I got many compliments on it.

This was good but it needed something else.  I added some ginger, cinamon, red pepper, and I sprinkled some sugar.  That kicked it up!

Due to the coconut milk and mango, this tasted more Thai than Indian.  It was a little bland as is, so I added some Fish sauce until I liked the taste.

This recipe is fantastic. I made it with tofu instead of chicken so it doubles as a tasty vegetarian recipe as well. I'm a big coconut fan so I added some coconut flakes cooked with the tofu and curry paste and it was a very good addition.

Very very good! Something unique and delicious. I added coconut flakes like others suggested and extra spices (garlic, onion powder, turmeric, cumin, ginger, and cinnamon). My husband asked that we make it again frequently. We agreed it was like something you would go to a restaurant for because of the uniqueness and the great flavor.

My husband and I loved this, and it was very easy to make and fast.  I used Pataks Mild Curry Paste (cilantro and cumin). The combination of tastes with the rest of the ingredients was great with basmati rice.  I'm sure it will also make excellent leftovers!

Wow wow wow. Made a double batch and we can't wait to eat the leftovers. I followed some of the other reviewers recommendations and added some cumin, shredded coconut and mini red and yellow peppers. I also added a couple tablespoons of peanut butter (makes it taste more like panang curry). Definite favorite in our house. Thanks so much!!!

This recipe is amazing!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly but I found the mango overwhelmed the coconut milk flavour and the spice was bland for my tastes.  The next time I reduced the mangoes to 1 and added more spice: 1 tsp chili paste, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp garlic, 1 tsp fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp paprika.  I also used half a can of coconut milk to reduce the fat the second time around.  Thanks so much for such a wonderful and refreshing recipe!

Well I wish I wasnt the one to write this type of review, HOWEVER, as you'll see I gave this 1 star, I wish i could give NO STARS. Note to self: Dont try a new recipe when you are entertaining, make it a few times to perfect the taste. 

Speaking of taste, this had no taste to me. The coconut milk took from the mango flavor in the puree. I had to save this dish by adding Schezwan sauce to it to give it a Hot/Sweet blend.

This was far from an Indian dish, it lacked the flavor and feel.

This dish tasted so good. It's spicy and a bit tangy because of the mangoes. My family loved it... Then I made a variation... I used firm Tofu (quickly fried on all sides just enough to make a soft brown crust) and then followed the rest of the procedure... the end result is equally delicious! This Tofu version, I made for a vegetarian friend who's a cancer survivor... He loved it!

My husband and I love this recipe and have made it on numerous occasions.  We pretty much follow it exactly, but we also add in some pineapple (to both the sauce and actual chunks in the dish - only use a bit though because the pineapple can overtake the mango flavoring) and about a tablespoon of minced ginger.  I also serve it with shredded coconut on top and use an indian-inspired rice as a base (cook your rice with browned onion and a bit of cinnamon and cumin).  DEEE-LICIOUSNESS!

4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this - the sweetness of the mango really went well with the spices.  I didn't have/couldn't find a spicy curry paste, so I made my own blend: 1 clove crushed garlic, a little bit of fresh minced ginger, 1-2 tbsp crushed tomatoes, and the following spices to taste: ground cumin, coriander, garam masala, curry powder, turmeric, cayenne.  
I left out the cucumber because I didn't have any.  I would try this again (and if I could find curry paste, would give it a go to see how it would work).  But overall very happy with this.

I really like the sweet undertones contrasting with the spiciness of the curry.  The mango puree really adds a lot of thickness without a lot of fat.  The coconut adds enough fat on its own!  I had to add a dash of salt but very good.

I found this recipe to be delicious! I halved it the first time and made it as written (only with light coconut milk). The second time, I doubled the curry paste and used a frozen bag of mango/raspberry/blueberry pieces (because that's all I had on hand). Both were great, but the fresh mango is better and the doubling of the curry paste is a must for me!

I really liked this. It could have been a little spicer for my taste. Used frozen mango chunks from Trader Joes. Made it very easy to prepare. The brown basmati took longer to cook than this dish.

Good, but the recipe as it stands isn't great. I added twice the curry past and 1/2 the mango, some tumeric and sea salt. I do recommend adding the rest of the mango in a bowl and letting people add it to their meal. IT'S AWESOME!

the recipe does not say whether the mangoes are supposed to be ripe or not. I used medium-ripe ones and that seemed to turn out with a good sweet flavour. next time I make it I will dice the mangoes and cucumber into little peices instead of large slices and then I think it will be perfect. it has lots of nice exotic flavour for those who arent afraid of mixing fruity and spicy. yummy

I started out using pure sesame oil with the paste and garlic. I  used 50% more curry paste.  We thought it was perfect and the Mango gives it that sweet combination that brings the dish together.

Really good, I added quite a few more things, once adding garlic, carrots and whatever else I felt like. Very ripe mangos are key! Great basic recipe, thanks!

Not as spicy as I thought. The cucumbers might have cut the spice to some degree. Interesting sweet and slightly spice dish though.

Why compromise the mango flavor? This mango chicken curry is moist and delicious with loads of mango flavor! Friends and family love this recipe and say it's by far the best! It's wonderful over rice!! Enjoy!

We loved this recipe.  I used red curry paste and added about a teaspoon more than what the recipe called for.  I also added carrots and some spices - garlic salt, ginger, cumin, pepper, red pepper flakes--yummy!  I think the more I make this recipe the better it will get as I tweak the spices I add to it....but even so, it was really good.

this ended up great, but i really had to add spice.  granted it i used too much coconut milk (14 oz vs 10) which probably drowned it.  so i added Tbls. curry, 2 Tbls Sambal Oelek chili paste, 1/2 jalepeno, 2 Tbls cilantro, 1 Tbls ginger and garlic and 1 tspn cumin and one fire roasted pepper.  YUM!

Very good recipe! Easy to make, perfect for two people. I don't care for shallots, so I made mine using onion powder instead. Almost the same effect, but minus the green.

Yummy. I used spice blend instead of curry paste. Light and creamy, mango is mild.

Terrific, and easy to modify (use low-fat coconut milk, add sauteed red or yellow peppers, delete cuke, add cumin and/or coriander). Since I was serving a mixed group (some like hot, hot curry, others only mild), I used a mild curry paste base and no extra spice, then split the batch and added red pepper flakes and more coriander, curry and ginger for the spicy folks. Serve over brown rice with mango chutney -- raves all around!

This recipe was very mild when cooked as is.  I made a few changes to this so that it was more to my and DH's liking.  I used spicy Vindaloo curry paste, and used at least twice as much as was recommended in the recipe.  I also added some extra spices at the end including: tumeric, garam masala, ground ginger, curry powder, cumin, and black mustard seed.  This really spiced the recipe up.  I would also like to say that it is very important to use optimally ripe mangoes.  If they are underripe, they are not nearly sweet enough and it makes a difference.  I think if I made this again, I would leave the cucumbers out, or I would cook them first, before adding them to the pan.

I thought it was a little bland so I add hot curry paste and cook it in oil first.  I also add chunks of red,green,orange or yellow peppers and chunks of onion.  Also add a little chicken broth to make it more saucy and not so thick.  Adds flavor too.  Then, it's 5 stars to me.  It is very good if you add a little more to it.  Also, no cucumbers for me but that's just my opinion.  I've made this a few times and it keeps getting better each time.  Love it and crave it!

This was incredible! I used Thai red curry instead of Indian and no cucumbers. I also cut the mangoes into smaller pieces. I am going to make it for a pot luck dinner. DEFINITELY worth the try!

Great, easy, simple.  Used coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil and half of the coconut milk.  We don´t have shallots in Costa Rica, so I used garlic and green onions.  Got a lot of compliments.  Thanks for the récipe

Not quite what I was hoping for, but still good. It was a bit bland, so I suppose that could be the fault of my curry paste and not the recipe -- I used a mild paste, but there should still be plenty of flavor if not spice. I needed to add a lot of salt so it didn't just taste like pureed mangoes. I will probably make it again but add more curry paste and some salt. I also changed the veggies: half an onion and half a green pepper, sauteed with the curry paste, then a couple small tomatoes quartered thrown in with the mango slices.

The recipe is a good base, but I had to add a few other items to make it flavorful.  We added yellow peppers, chili sauce and curry powder to give it more flavor and substance.  I served over basmati rice and it was fantastic.

this was pretty good, it didnt come out as near as pretty as the picture! but it is something that is very healthy for my family to eat, it was easy too. but it wasnt as spicy as i thought it was, it was extrmely mild. the coconut/mango mixture wasnt very sweet, it was kinda bitter, i had to add just a smidgin of sugar. the cucumbers went very well with it, we just had it with rice.

Loved the blend of spicy (added some extra hot curry paste) and mango sweet.  Great recipe.  I made it with chicken thighs because my husband prefers dark meat.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a very tasty dish. My only complaint is that it is not spicy enough. I used a Madras-style curry powder and mixed it in 4 tsp of oil to make a paste (as I didn't have any spicy curry paste). The spice got drowned out by the mango and the coconut milk. Next time, I would definitely double the spices and put in additional cayenne pepper if necessary. I like my curry spicy!

Easy to make, but no taste/flavor. I felt it was a waste of mangoes that I love. The price for coconut milk was high & I thought I was lucky to find the last can in the store. Now I wish I'd left it for someone else. The curry paste, I thought, would've brought some distinct flavor, but nothing. Very disappointed & won't make this again.

This was fantastic.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was a bit much cucumber for my personal taste, but I took a few slices out and it was just perfect.  It's in the permanent recipe box now.

Loved this recipe.  I made the mistake of using mild curry paste instead of spicy (my husband and I are not 5 alarm spicy curry lovers so I wanted to be careful the first time through).  It was somewhat bland.  Salt and pepper helped - will use spicy paste next time.

This is essentially how I usually make my curry. I switch it around a bit depending on what meat I want to use, and change the vegetables, each time. Turns out great every time.

I hate to leave a mediocre review but this was a bit bland. As others have previously stated, it needs MORE SPICE! I added some crushed Thai chili peppers, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, ginger, and a little salt. That seemed to help a bit. I may make this again, but I will be altering even further with a few more spices and ingredients. Nice base recipe though.

Excellent curry although I did make a couple of adjusmtents.  I added a good tablespoon of mango chutney to the coconut milk mix with the fresh mango and more curry paste to the chicken. Results were fantastic - a real keeper.

Lovely! I can't wait to make it again for my mother or sister. I blended all the mangoes because my man said he didn't like things too "fruity" and I used a Massaman curry paste which gave it a really rich flavor without being too sweet. Next time I might try cutting the coco milk with coconut powder to make it a little lighter. Super quick, easy and delicious.

The juxtaposition of spicy and sweet is perfect (however, I like my food a lot spicier so I added quite a bit of cayenne). I could eat my weight in this stuff!

Sorry, I didn't care for this.  Too bland, needed salt and spices.  The cucumber was weird...but I did make a cuke salad with it, and that was delicious.

Great! I agree to add more spices: extra curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, chili powder, paprika, salt, & pepper.

This is really delicious. I added a lot more spices to this. I used about 2 tblsps of curry powder, a tblsp of paprika, a teaspoon of chili, and a tsp of turmeric. It came out VERY delicious. thank you.

Very good though quite bland. The amount of coconut milk and mango puree overpowers the curry. I was afraid of putting too much curry, as I hate spicy food, but this was too bland even for my taste. Next time I will try adding more spices to the chicken, or to the puree. But I will definitely make this again! Great with naan bread made according to the recipe on this website.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it has such a unique taste and I have fallen in love with this recipe.  however, I do think it could use more curry paste (depending on your paste) and a little kick to it.  Nice for kids though.

Loved this!Reminded me of an old recipe I have, and will post that. In addition to this if you have some fresh pineapple chunks,plus sprinkle grated coconut on top, mixed with unsalted peanuts or chopped almonds,plus any fresh cilantro you have on hand to top it off is extra delicious!!

The only reason this does not get 5 stars is because, as written, the recipe is very bland tasting. We love Indian food and love the spices, but I believe the puree was the culprit in drowning out the spiciness of this meal. It was mild, at best. Next time I will make some changes to the spice blend and hopefully it will make me rethink the one star I am not giving now.

This is a great base recipe, though I make it more Thai by using green curry paste, adding 1 tsp of fish sauce and some cilantro. Amazing over jasmine rice!

This is an easy and superb-tasting recipe.  The most difficult part is prepping the mangoes.  I usually don't deviate from the recipe the first time I use it but time was short and I had no shallots.  I have small boys and a parent that can get small kids to try shallots deserves a medal.  Anyway, the outcome depends a bit on the quality if curry used.  I used a mild blend that my boys will eat.  When cooking for just the wife and I, I use a more "Flavorful" blend.  I learned long ago that "Medium" to a native Thai is insanely hot to me.  I tend not to use anything more than "Mild" when shopping in Asian specialty stores.  I've varied the vegetables with this recipe depending on what I can pick from my garden.  The recipe is good enough to stand a fair amount of variance without compromising it.  I give it 5 stars because of the ease of prep and consistent high quality despite my best efforts to vary the ingredients and proportions.

I made this recipe several times when i lived in Canada ( I love it!) and I just happened to move to Arlington, Texas too. Unfortunately i have a hard time finding any curry paste at all in grocery stores like Kroger and Tom Thumb. Where do you get your supply?

I followed several of the suggestions, like cubing the mangos, omitting the cucumber, using onion instead of shallots, etc.  There was a good contrast of sweet and spicy, but one thing it sorely needed was salt, especially on the chicken.  Be sure you salt the chicken when you fry it or you'll have big chunks of bland in an otherwise good curry.  I think when I make this again, in addition to salting, I'll finish it off with a little garam masala along with the mango/milk mixture and see what that does.

This is a great recipe. I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, about 2tbs minced ginger and some mustard seed to the shallots. When the mustard seeds start to pop add the coconut milk mixture. I also added some yellow curry powder. At the end i used garam marsala. I left out the cucumber (didn't have any available) It came out just like my favorite Indian restaurants!

My boyfriend is crazy about mangoes. So I had to try this. Although the mango taste is subtle it was really delicious!
I added a green bell pepper with the curry for extra colour and texture. Thank you!

I loved the added flavor of the mango.  For a vegetarian version I used tofu instead of chicken and deep-fried it with cornstarch before adding it.

This dish was delicious!!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I can't believe how simple it was to make!  I used Biryani curry paste and I used a little more than was suggested because I wanted more flavor.  I also diced the cucumber and mango which worked out well.  I can't wait to make this dish again,

It was a hit and we’ve had a similar dish at a local Indian restaurant that we loved called “Shrimp Molly”. It was a similar curry sauce with a kick of heat and sweetness and pairs well with shrimp and chicken.

Made this for the first time tonight with a 13oz can of coconut milk and Thai Kitchen green curry paste.  While it was definitely tasty, the paste had zero heat.  Tasted a little of the paste directly and it had little or no heat.  I kinda thought green curry paste is supposed to be the hotter one?

I was not super impressed with the original recipe. I thought it was too bland! However, the mango sounded fantastic and as a base it's a great dish. I think part of the reason why mine did not turn out as well is because the mangos that I used were not ripe enough. I will try again with super ripe mangos and see how this turns out. 
I did add garam masala to the chicken and I also threw in a little bit of sugar and minced garlic to the dish in an effort to add some flavor. I also ran out and got some fish sauce. That made it a lot tastier and the next day, the dish was even better after the flavors had mixed together. Definitely get the fish sauce and add it to the chicken while cooking then splash a little on your plate at the end. It makes a big difference. 
Also, make sure your mangos are properly ripened! I think that will add a bit of sweetness to your recipe without having to add sugar.

Very good recipe, but it definitely needs more spices, in my opinion. I made this twice and stuck to the recipe exactly the first time, and then added to it the second time. I definitely recommend adding an extra mango to the blender with the coconut milk. I also used a lot more curry paste than this called for and a big dollop of pepper jelly. I think mango chutney would be excellent in this as well!

Everyone loved it. This was my first time cooking out with curry. The mangoes weren't sweet enough and had a bitter taste to me so on mine I added brown sugar sprinkled on top and it was perfect for me. Everyone else ate it as was! Thank you!!!!

Everyone loved this. Even my two kiddos. I didn't use curry paste (because I didn't have it) and just used curry powder in oil.  I then also had to add some heat because of that.  But that allowed me to serve the children's plate before adding the heat.

Great! Not an overpowering flavor. I added pineapple juice to the mango mixture. And I added a handful of cilantro, 2 garlic cloves and some salt to the final product.

Wonderful recipe. I made a few changes from other reviews and added more curry according to taste about another tablespoon. I added a sliced onion, cut the shallots in half and added some red pepper I had on hand. Everyone just raved about it.  I served it over Brown Jasmine Rice. This is a keeper!

This is an unique recipe indeed. However 1 can of coconut milk will give a mild creamy taste to the curry instead of spicy. It will be good to cut down the coconut milk in half to bring the spiciness.  I have only blended one mango and did not add any mango or cucumber slices to the meal.Moreover I have added ground cumin, tumeric powder, curry powder and garam masala. A pinch of salt will bring out the flavour and I have sprinkled ground black pepper and chilli flakes at the end. Spicy yet creamy. Perfect combo!

It was my first time making Indian food at home - so I'd say it was a success!  I added the extra spices like many reviewers suggested to add a little more character.  My husband wished I added some "kick" (maybe cayenne?), but the girls at Book Club loved it.  Went great with our Book for the month - The Hundred-Foot Journey, by Richard C Morais.

So good! I actually made a mistake and added four teaspoons of garlic chili sauce instead of the curry sauce. When I realized my mistake, I then added about eight teaspoons of curry paste (four definitely wasn't enough flavor so I just kept adding.) It was amazing! My husband and I like really spicy food so I would maybe start with two teaspoons of the chili sauce and work your way up to suit your taste.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars including the modifications I used. I could only find red curry paste, so I used that but had to more than double the amount. On top of that, I added cayenne, cumin and ground ginger. Without the extra spice, it would have been much more sweet than spicy.

A wonderful way to use up mangoes with this yummy curry sauce.  Used chicken thighs and legs and left out cucumbers, used more curry paste as we like our food spicy. Also added some grated fresh ginger.

This is a wonderful recipe! Its perfect for the paleo diet with some cauliflower "rice." I added a lot more spices, and it was just the flavors I needed.

Very good. I made a few changes, added an additional tablespoon of the curry paste, a tbs or garam masala, and salt. Cooked the onions with a clove of garlic before first before adding the paste. I also ditched the cucumbers.

Will definitely cook it again

Some in my family can't eat hot foods, so I substituted mild curry paste for the spicy stuff.  It was still really tasty.  I also substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil--gives a little more flavor and healthier too. The recipe makes a lot--four very generous servings or, more likely, six normal ones. Best thing about this recipe is the lovely fresh taste from the mangoes and cucumber. Worst thing is the prep time--no way is it 25 minutes to cut up raw chicken, prep the mangoes, seed and slice the cuke, peel and slice the shallots.  It's worth it, but this isn't a speedy recipe--unless you have a sous chef!

Excellent flavor.  I used red curry paste and had to use frozen mangoes (that's all I had).  I also used thighs instead of chicken breasts, though I liked them I will try the chicken breast next time I make this.

Like one of the other reviewers, I found this recipe to be bland. I added some sea salt and a small amount of cayenne pepper to pep it up a bit. I made it for a potluck, and a few people went back for seconds and even thirds, but it was a little too exotic for about half of the guests.

Not sure why this has good reviews.  This needed SALT!  It just didn't work for me, even though all the ingredients in this dish I like.  When I'm older and not allowed to eat salt anymore, I will make this again.  Just straight up BLAND!

Best Curry I've made yet.  I did not find it spicy enough so I doubled the curry paste and added a few hot dried peppers.  My mangos were not ripe even after sitting for a week in my house, so I pureed 1 with a cup of fresh pineapple and the milk to help sweeten/flavor it.  I didn't have shallots so I used 5 scallions which ar much less potent.  I was surprised how well the cucumber went with the dish and added a few cashews to garnish also.  Overall good curry served over rice.

I like the idea, but it came out a bit bland.  Try adding a few chili peppers and some common Indian spices such as garam masala, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin.

This was tasty.  I added more curry paste as well as extra curry powder.  The thought of the cukes warming up sounded gross so I didn't add those - I topped it with cilantro instead.

This was excellent. Everybody in the family was raving about it, even my younger picky eaters. I did not have shallots so I just sauteed an onion before the chicken.  I made it more saucey by about doubling the mango and adding extra curry paste. I also added red pepper and curry powder for a little extra kick. Served it with naan for dipping in the sauce. This was a very easy recipe and a real crowd pleaser. I highly recommend it.

My family loved this.  My changes were to use 3 large mangos and since I had powdered coconut I used this with some fruit juice (mango/orange) in place of the coconut milk.  To kick up the colour of the sauce I added 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley into the blender.  Both the color and flavor were vivid!

Very yummy!!  Perfect amount of spice but very flavorful and satisfying.  I will definitely make this many more times as I LOVE a good curry recipe.  I added the garam marsala and garlic as recommended, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

HOLY SHALLOTS! I did it exactly like the recipe said, and the amount of shallots completely over powered everything...as for taking half of the mangoes and not putting them in the blender...totally not indian food style. I was looking for a recipe similar to a meal at our local indian restaurant...this was NOT it. I bet if I could tweak 90% of the recipe it would have come out better. The only thing that saved it was the curry.

Excellent.  I wanted a lot of sauce, so I doubled the coconut cream and added a little water so not too rich.  Also added crushed fresh chillies and a head of garlic crushed.  Family loved it and will be making several times during mango season.

It was very good, but a little sweeter than I usually like dinner to be. The curry was also a little bland at first, so I added a small amount more of the paste, then some Tiger Tiger curry that I had in the cupboard. Very good though. I will make it again.

Yum! Made exactly as directed and it turned out great. However, next time I'll probably leave out the cucumbers. Authentic or not, I just don't care for them in this particular dish.

This was delicious, the whole family loved it –including my 8 year old. I used rttii's homemade curry recipe listed in the comments below, so the color of this dish was more of an ocher brown than yellow. I used what I had: 1 fresh mango, 1 can of coconut milk, 1/2 a cucumber, 3 tsp of curry, and replaced the shallots for an ordinary medium onion. I found the dish to be very runny (probably because of the missing mango) and right before serving decided to thicken it with cornstarch. (I took all the meat out, dissolved 2tsp of cornstarch into 1tbs of water and whisked it into the coconut mango). I will definitely be making this again, with or without the second mango.

i love curry and i really wanted to give it 5 stars but it didn't really dazzle me. if i could; i'd rate it 3 1/2 stars. i had to add extra spices because it was a little bland. something was missing; not sure what.

Unfortunately, I found this a little bland... Also be very wary of overcooking mango, it only takes a few minutes and both mango and coconut quickly loose their flavor. That said, this snafoo may have been my fault, but it was still a bit of a disappointment  :(

This is a very good recipe to try just the way it.  I do plan on adding things to it the next time I make it again; but that is just because I love to experiment.  Very good base recipe though!  thanks!

Good and easy recipe, but I agree that it needed more spice. I added the whole small jar of curry paste, and then hot chili, tumeric, curry powder, a little cinnamon and nutmeg. I will be repeating the dish.

This was my second time tasting a curry dish and my first in preparing one. It wasn't to difficult and it tasted pretty good. I will make this again.

This was a very easy recipe.  I'm giving it a 4 because it needed a little more kick than the original recipe called for.  I added more curry and salt before my family was happy with it.

This recipe was amazing!! My husband and I frequent Indian restaurants, but this definitly gave us our fix at home! I followed the recipe for the most part but I did add curry seasoning and some allspice to the chicken while cooking! I also added a little garlic salt and pepper to tone down the mango just a little bit, great recipe! It is now a family favorite!

Excellent and unusual dish, made just as written except for the use of low fat coconut milk instead of full fat to save a few calories.

I could not find curry paste at my local grocery store.  I used regular curry which was not powerful enough.  It left it needing a stronger flavor. It was pretty good otherwise.

This is very easy and healthy. I like more thai "kick" so I added way more curry paste and more spices, otherwise, the original recipe is pretty tame. Overall I liked it.

I made this recipe last summer because we had a lot of mangoes that we were trying to use up (we have a delicious mango tree in my parents' backyard in Miami), and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this dish tasted.  Although I was skeptical while preparing the food, I was thrilled when I tried it.

I followed the recipe as written and it was okay for me, but my kids and husband didn't like it at all. It was much to spicey for my younger kids...may try again following recommendations listed.

This is an excellent curry dish. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed and we were delighted by the results. If you like really spicy curry then you will probably want to use more curry that the recipe suggests.

I cook in small country hotel in Tintaldra Australia. I made this for the boss and guests, they loved it. Very easy recipe to follow. Lovely fresh mangos & I used Thai red curry paste. Next time I will use more chilli (sambo olick) as we like it hot. The colour is wounderful.

WONDERFUL!!  It's so yummy!  I misread the directions and accidentally pureed all the mangoes but it still tasted good! I served it with long grain brown rice and used Lite coconut milk for a healthier meal. I also sauteed the chicken and shallots with coconut oil.

I very much enjoyed this reipe. As I am a vegetarian I used quorn instead of chicken and it worked very well, thank you
