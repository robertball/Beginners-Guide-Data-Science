We made this tonight and it was a fantastic dish. I didn't have any amchoor so I looked up substitutes and found I could use lemon or lime juice. We also used olive oil but this is a personal preference on oils. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I added more oil (olive) and salt, but that is just personal preference. This is a really good recipe. They definitely taste like authentic Indian potatoes!

Loved this recipe.  Followed it as is, and it turned out great. I loved that the potatoes were not too oily, and the spice coating, fried on the potatoes had such great flavor- especially the cumin!  Will definitely keep this recipe on hand to make when I cook Indian food!

Very very good.  I made it with mini potatoes (cutting the larger ones in half) and used ghee as my oil.  The ghee gives it a rich buttery taste.

I loved it! I did not have the mango powder and used a little oregano and cayenne. Very good.
