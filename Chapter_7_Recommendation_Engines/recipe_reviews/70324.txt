This dish is very good!  It smells wonderful while baking!! Next time I make this I am not adding the additional melted butter on top of the bread crumbs, it made it a little runny and greasy. Otherwise, great recipe!!

I had some mushrooms to use up and no one in the house likes them except me.  So, I made a teeny version of this - oh, my is it delicious!  I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the shrooms, and it was only one layer; I made the recipe just as it's written in that single layer, but sprayed olive oil over the top instead of butter.  I'll be making this many more times!!

This was not even close to a good recipe. It tasted like olives and cheese. It more like a pizza topping.

This was amazing! Delicious, I think its vital to not overdo the olives as they will take over if you do!  I used about a half can of Lindsay's large pitted olives and it was just perfect! My son, who detests olives, didn't even realize they were in there.  They are important though, I think it helps balance the dish! Thank you Debbie!

This dish misses the point of using the ingredient. I suppose these are the most different tasting mushroom ever, considering all you can taste is the butter, cheese and bread. Maybe you should shoot this one Paula Dean's way.

I loved it.  I liked them mushrooms more than the olives so next time I will 1/2 the olives.  I used the mushroom juice over the top instead of butter and it seemed to work fine.

It was ok, but not great.  I took the advice about leaving out the butter drizzled on top, but that made it kinda dry.  Next time I think I'll add more vegetables to add more variety.

We enjoyed this one. Simple. Smells great cooking. It does taste like pizza topping so if you are not a pizza person...
I love pizza and my husband hates thick  doughy crust pizza. For us this recipe fits like a glove with little prep time.

Definitely making this again.
The boss had a pig roast Saturday and I made this as my potluck contribution. It went very quickly and got rave reviews.
I garnished it with mini bell pepper slices for some colour, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings and baked each serving in individual ramekins. We liked this just fine and it would pair nicely with many different things. I agree with some of the others who said that last drizzle of butter made the dish oily. I recommend skipping that step. The mushrooms retained plenty enough butter and the extra just isn't needed. I personally love olives but for those who don't, it would work just fine without them too.

I've made it for some very picky eaters and they really enjoyed it. I don't use as much cheese as the recipe calls for, I think it's a bit over powering. But it is a nice change to the usual side dishes brought to dinners.
