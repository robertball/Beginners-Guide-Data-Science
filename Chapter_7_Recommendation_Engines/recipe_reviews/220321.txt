These are sinful and rich little guys! The recipe is very simple to follow with it's detailed instructions. Please feel free to look at my blog here on AR to see step by step how to assemble. It's one of my family's favorite holiday dessert recipes. And now my family looks forward to it every year. This keeps well in the frig for a week and can be frozen for a later time. I hope you like it as much as we do. Please NOTE: the cheesecake part of the recipe doesn't rise but about 1/4 - 1/2 an inch, but won't fall flat. It stays the same thickness as when you poured it in. It's thick and creamy but will stay firm after refrigerated. Don't flip out if you think it's suppose to rise, because it won't.

Just ok - too many packaged ingrediants.  Next time I'll make it without using a cake mix and the canned frosting.

I made these for an early St. Patrick's day event. They were the first thing to go! Rave reviews all around. Yes the recipe has quite a few steps, but it is well written and thorough. I used chopped Andes mint candies since I couldn't find the dark chocolate and mint chips. I also put a little parchment in the pan to make removing them easier. Thanks mis7up!

As a cheesecake novice, I learned a few things by making this recipe.  #1. Mine also puffed during baking & fell in the refrigerator.  I read that this is due to overbeating of the eggs causing a "souffle effect."  It didn't affect the texture of the finished product, other than the 4 edges remained raised.  Next time I will add the eggs as the last ingredient of the batter so as not to overbeat them.  #2. There is an art to cutting cheesecake so that the filling doesn't cling to the knife.  Use a very thin, sharp blade (steak knife) and dip it into the hot water often to prevent dragging the filling and making messy edges.  #3.  My grocery store did not have candy flavoring, so I bought peppermint extract.  I used 1 tsp. in the batter.  They also did not have mint chocolate chips or even mint chocolate candies (Andes)!  So I bought dark chocolate chips & white chocolate chips.  I colored the white chips with a drop of green coloring in a plastic bag.  They somewhat absorbed the color.  Pale green mint chips would've been prettier, but this worked fine.  Also because of the lack of mint in the topping, I think the batter could've used more than 1 tsp. of peppermint extract to stand up to the strong cheesecake flavor, maybe 1 1/2 tsp.  #4.  I cut the squares & arranged them on a plate, & then drizzled melted dark chips from the corner of a bag onto each square individually.  This prevented smearing the chocolate onto the pale green filling during cutting.  LOVE IT! THANKS!!!

This was a yummy recipe.  I used much more food coloring than reciped called for.  The crust was the best part.  I didn't have mint chocolate chips, so I used mini chocolate ones, and then drizzled melted green chocolate over the top.  Everyone thought it was great!

i had so much fun making this!! mine did fall but its probably because i put it in the fridge right after i took it out of the oven instead of letting it cool first. but that was my fault. other then that it came out great & i can see myself making this again. next time i will wait for it to cool before i put it in the fridge. also i put some wax paper down to make it easy for me to get the bars out of the glass pan. they came out so easy!!!

These are sinfully good! Thank you so much for sharing. I goofed the first time I made these and forgot to reserve some of the crust for the topping. I had some leftover thin mint girl scout cookies so I crushed a bunch of those for the topping and mixed with the amount of butter called for in the recipe and yum!!! I also used crushed Andes mints to garnish and melted milk chocolate chips to drizzle over the top. My fiance and I ate them after the 2 hour refiregeration like the recipe called for, and they didnt taste that great. I would suggest letting them completely chill over night before eating because it made a huge difference in the taste and then we couldn't stop eating them!!

Made this today and it was delicious, the only thing I changed was I didn't have the frosting and don't really care for store bought frosting anyway so I subbed it for a home made cream cheese frosting.
4 oz. butter
4 oz cream cheese
2 cups confection sugar
1 tsp. vanilla

My daughter who loves all things mint-y absolutely loved these. I did change the recipe a bit. Apparently after Christmas my small town doesn't carry the dark chocolate and mint chips! So I had to use Andes pieces or something like that. Also instead of the pre-made cream cheese frosting I made my own using Cream Cheese Frosting II from AR. Then just measured out 16 oz. It worked fabulously. Lots of steps in the recipe but it goes quickly. Mine didn't crack or fall at all, I did have my cream cheese at room temp so maybe that helped. They actually came out very nice. But when I was putting them in the fridge I dropped them right onto the floor!!! Lucky for me I had them covered so at least they could still be eaten they were just really ugly after that :( But tasty :)

Made the cheesecake without the mint and food coloring.  It was very yummy. Loved the crust. Smells wonderful baking.  Will make again.  Thanks
Made the cheesecake again, this time I used a lemon cake mix and a can of lemon frosting to mix with the cream cheese.  It was a big hit with my family and coworkers.  Had a lot of request for the recipe.  It is so easy to make.  Yummy!!

This was a very expensive/labor intensive dessert to make.  Not one of my guests were WOWED!  In fact, most plates were brought to the sink with half of the dessert untouched.  I would "never" make it again.

Many of you have stated that your bars "fell" If you have never made a cheesecake before ( have made 100's of them)...they always "fall". Out of the oven the cake is puffy but as your cake cools it falls in and becomes the dense deliciousness of a cheesecake. That is supposed to happen, it is not your mistake or a bad recipe. And yes chilling them overnight will improve the flavor and texture of your cake/bars.

The ingredients sound like it would be wonderful, but I hated it!  Frankly, to my taste, the mint flavored cheesecake is a waste of a perfectly good cheesecake.  I actually made it twice, thinking that I had done something wrong.  I used creme de menthe the second time, even that didn't help.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day this year and it is amazingly yummy!  I changed it a little bit for what I could find in the grocery store and in my kitchen, but mostly the same.  Will definately make it again!

Since this was a rather annoying issue for me, I feel I ought to point this out now since no one else has. I had a difficult time trying to cut decent squares after the chips had re-hardened in the fridge. Maybe it was that I let it cool overnight, or maybe not, but next time I will cut them before placing in the fridge and see if it works better. If not, maybe adding them after chilling instead. This small problem aside, I was rather impressed at how well my first foray into cheesecake-making turned out. Very delicious.

Very, very good! Never made cheesecake before & it turned out great.  Was a lot easier than I thought cheesecake would be. Loved baking in 9x13 pan instead of spring form.  Used peppermint extract & Andes candies.  Did not drizzle any chocolate on top. Still very good.

Scrumptious! Had to find a bottle of the Creme de Menthe candy flavoring at a craft type store, but it was worth the trip.  This is a recipe to repeat.  A real crowd-pleaser!

This recipe is very sweet.  Also, I ended up adding quite a bit of mint flavoring to the cheese filling mixture because I could not taste the mint at first when I only added what the recipe called for.  In the end, I added too much mint flavoring, so it is a sensitive process.  Other than that, delicious and easy!

Great!  Only don't say bake until firm, because that's not how cheesecakes are supposed to be baked!  They will still be jiggly in the middle, but will stiffen after being chilled.

I LOVE that this is an easy recipe - relying on "packaged ingredients" makes it a speedy-quick dessert.  Gobbled up super quick at our house - and it's now a part of our St. Pat's annual celebration.

I made this for my friends and said it was out of this world.   Did use Andes mints since I couldn't find the other.   Added them after baking.   Cut in the morning and then drizzled melted chips over.

I made this the other day and I thought it turned out ok but my cheesecake loving husband liked it. Mine also fell and I'm not sure why. When I pulled the cheesecake out of the oven it was nice and puffy but then after about 10 minutes it fell and it definitely wasn't as thick as when I poured it in places. I couldn't find candy flavoring anywhere and had to try to use extract and I didn't think it came out very minty after using 1 and 1/8th teaspoons of extract.  Another more important note I found out in the middle of making this...Betty Crocker cake mixes don't always come in the 18.25 oz package the recipe called for mine was only 15 oz and the one cup also wasn't enough to cover the top of my cake at all I ended up using another box of cake mix that I had to make the top of the bars.  Next time I make this I will cut the recipe back to make a smaller batch and probably cut the cake mix in half so I know I have enough to cover the top of the bars.  Oh and I didn't see the dark chocolate and mint chips either but I did happen to find some Andes mint chips that are awesome and I also got a bag of chocolate chips so I could have both chocolate and mint chips and it worked out great.  I really like the idea of these bars but to make them work for my family it needs a little tweaking.

I made this yesterday for our church fish fry, and have to say that I won't make it again.  As someone else said, mine also fell in the middle as it cooled.  Taste wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  The ingredients are very expensive, probably costing at least $20.  I did have to make a couple modifications, as my grocery store didn't carry some of the ingredients.  No dark chocolate and mint chips, so I used chopped Andes candies for the topping and sprinkles afterward.  Also didn't have the Wilton's creme de menthe flavoring, so used peppermint extract.  Otherwise, I made this exactly according to the recipe, including the brands and flavors of cake mix and frosting that was specified.

5 star rating from my teenage sons! Made it more for the St. Patrick's Day festivities than the mint aspect. Actually omitted the mint from the cheesecake portion because most in my house don't like it. To accomodate everyone, I topped half with non-mint chocolate chips and the other half with crumbled Andes mints. Worked for our family. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Everyone likes it,  I could not get mint chips so I shopped Andes mint bars up instead and I used 3 tbs of creme de mint liquors instead of food coloring.

I really liked this and loved the tip of using the parchment paper to take out of the pan easily.  I had used mint extract instead of the crème de menthe candy flavoringfor a mild mint flavoring.  With the mint chocolate chips, I had a delightful chocolate mint dessert that was very good that had a subtle mint flavor.

I made this exactly like it said. I gave some to the campers on my rv campground. Then I tasted it . Not much like a cheese cake flavor at all I could really taste the frosting most. Won't make again sorry did not like and am so bummed I passed it out without tasting because with the rating it had and three blocks of cream cheese I figured it was so so good but not at all . Sorry yuk

Made this for the wife to take to work for birthday treats and I'm told it was loved by all.  I had to make some substitutions because couldn't find dark chocolate mint chips and mint candy flavoring.  I used dark chocolate chips and Andes mint chips.   For the flavoring I found some mint syrup.  I also had to use a lot more food coloring and the mint syrup added some color.  I got 1 small piece and it was great.  I'll probably have to make this again since the wife works with a bunch of chocoholics.

Sorry but this was just ok.  It looked really pretty but the taste was just "meh".  I don't think I will make it again.

This came out as pretty as the picture! I got rave reviews from all the ladies @ our luncheon. I could not find mint chocolate chips, so I got dark chocolate chips and melted in microwave, added about 1 tsp peppermint extract and drizzled over cooled cake. I would highly recommend cutting you servings and THEN drizzling; the chocolate drizzle hardens & is very messy to cut through. I also used 6tsp crime de menthe instead of the other Flávorings & food color. It was delicious!

I made this for my annual office baking competition and won.  I scored well in 2 (appearance, texture) of the 3 grading categories. The flavor needs some work though. I need to find the perfect balance between mint and chocolate flavors.

Perfect dessert for St. Patrick's day! I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting creme de menthe with mint extract. I also melted dark chocolate chips with the fillings of mint oreos for the drizzle. A big hit with everyone! Will definitely be added to the annual St. Patrick's day meal.

This is good and the presentation is so pretty.  Make sure to pat the crust down well. When you cut the squares, if it's not solid it crumbles.   I'd add more mint extract next time. 1 1/2 tsps wasn't minty enough.
