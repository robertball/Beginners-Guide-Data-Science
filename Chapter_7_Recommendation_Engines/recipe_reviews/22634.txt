I made this into garlic cheese bread by folding in a whole small bulb of roasted garlic. This was good but the mayonnaise was overwhelming. Next time, I might sub out half for cream cheese.

I use this recipe everytime I BBQ. I make the following changes though...I use Texas toast style bread, you can use french toast bread as long as it isn't maple flavored or something. Then I add a clove of crushed garlic. I only have to put it in the oven for about 8 minutes, and then the broiler for about 2 minutes. It comes out PERFECT! I have NEVER used frozen garlic bread or any other garlic bread recipe since this one. Thank you =)

This is good.  I roasted a bulb of garlic and added the cloves to the mix.  My boyfriend thought the mayo taste was too strong, too tangy, I have to agree with him.  Next time I will use less mayo, maybe 1/2 as much.

This recipe was wonderful!!!  We are big garlic fans, so I added more garlic and cut the onion to only 1/4 cup.  I also cut the mayo back to 1/4 cup.  It was easy to make and everyone loved it.  Thank you very much!!

Too much mayo. I hoped the mayo would kind of "melt" into the bread and flavor it but the mixture just sat there on top and got hot. Not what I was looking for.

This is cheesy, gooey, and delicious.  I did make a couple of minor adjustments.  I added some garlic powder to the cheese mixture, and I only baked it 10 minutes to keep it from getting dried out.  Very good!

This is a very rich cheese bread! I followed others advice and used half the mayo and was glad I did! I only had marble cheese, but it was great. Also used bread because I didn't have a loaf but it was a bit soggy so would imagine would be perfect on a french loaf.

Great recipe. Halved the mayo. Sliced 1" thick slices (rounds), and made them. Wonderful for over-all coverage and easy to eat. Thanks.

The name says it all! This is the BEST EVER. 
I also halved the mayo. 
Make a double batch because this will disappear before you know it.

Very quick & easy to make.  For those who don't like the taste of "MAYO," cut the mayo with softened butter (a half and half ratio works very well).  I made this as the recipe indicates but prefer the butter to mayo ratio as it evens out the taste.  We usually also add some spices of choice such as garlic, salt, sometimes onion powder, into the mixture.  A light sprinkle of salt ensures all the good flavors really show when you get to the proving grounds - which is the eating of it!

I make something similar but I add crisp bacon and equal part butter to the mayo...sometimes I add cut up olives to the bread as well...I mix all the ingredients together and spread on the bread...kind of makes a pizza like bread but everyone loves it!

Made this last night to go with our pork chops and it was wonderful! I made 2 loaves, one exactly as written and the 2nd with a few minor changes. For the 2nd loaf I used 1/2 of the mayo called for, added a bulb of minced garlic and about 1/2 cup of diced green chile. It was fabulous!! We all preferred the second version, but the original was eaten up too. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing

Tried this, it was good, made it just as the recipe called for, I read some of the reviews and did add some garlic, will make it again, but next time use Miracle Whip I think that will give it the zip that I was looking for.

One of my very favorites! I grew up with my grandma making this for us. She added chopped black olives as well. I cook it under the broiler and it goes faster. If you don't have a French baguette, English muffins are a yummy substitute. And always remember, you don't have to use the exact proportions of mayo to cheese. You just need enough mayo to make the cheese into a paste.

This is delicious as is but we even made it better.  Add chopped black olives, green chilis and a few chopped pickled jalapenos (to your taste) to the mixture and it's even more addictive.

What I've done to make this easier and lessen the mayo taste is to spread the bread slices with a thin layer of mayo and then top with the shredded cheese, folding and pressing the cheese slightly into the mayo.  This doesn't sound easier, but it gives me more control over how many slices of bread I need to make.

Decent, and something I might make again, but not a four or five star recipe--at least the version I prepared.  Fifteen minutes made the bread crunchier than we like it, though it might have been my choice of bread.  Next time, I'll use fresher bread ... that might bring the recipe up to a four.  We'll give this one another try, but I don't think it will be a favorite.

Very good.  The bread texture was light and crisp, and the topping flavor was very good.  I added a blend of italian herbs, which was a nice variation.  I'd have given it 5 stars, except that I thought it tasted a little greasy. I will certainly make it again.

My mother-in-law gave me a similar recipe. We put it on cocktail rye and broil about two minutes!! YUMMY!
