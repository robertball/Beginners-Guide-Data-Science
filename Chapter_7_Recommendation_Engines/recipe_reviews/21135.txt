I have made these with and without the cream of tartar, and much prefer them without. The cream of tartar, I thought, gave them a slight bitter aftertaste. With that correction, these are tender, fluffy, and ohhh so tasty. Not to mention EASY. Hope that little tip helps everyone.

Excellent easy receipe. Note - Baking Soda already has some Cream of Tarter, or similar acidic leavening in it, and this may be the reason Cream of Tarter may be left out without too noticeable an effect. Also note all dry ingredients should be mixed THROUGHLY before adding liquids.

Finally, note there is a TIME LIMIT of about 15 to 20 minutes from the time you have added liquid to Baking Powder until you start baking them for Baking Power to have its best leavening(rising)affects. So be sure to preheat oven so its ready for baking when bisquits mixed and ready

I've been looking for a biscuit recipe that doesn't use hardened shortening/butter...as my daughter doesn't tolerate dairy or soy and we have to use oil for everything.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  It's so forgiving, as I made many changes.  I used half whole wheat flour and half ap flour; accidentally doubled the sugar; left out the cream of tartar; used 1 teaspoon salt (since I was not using butter); used olive oil instead of butter; used rice milk instead of milk.  They turned out tender and delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I was looking for a quick biscuit recipe when I decided to try this one.  It was fantastic!  I did not change the ingredients at all.  The only change I made was to not melt the butter, but to freeze the stick of butter and grate it (using a box grater) into the flour mixture.  Stir this around and then add the milk.  This process yields very flaky
biscuits.

These biscuits are quick, good, and easy. I haven't used the cream of tartar just because I don't buy it on a regular basis but these work just fine without. I have added brown sugar and cinnamon, and will try them with crushed garlic and herbs, Thanks.

These biscuits are perfect!  I omitted the cream of tartar.  I mixed the butter and milk together and added them both into the flour mix.   I added the milk/butter mix a bit at a time and found that I got a good consistancy when there was still about 1/3 of a cup left, so I did not use the rest.  May only use 3/4 of a cup of milk the next time.

I made larger biscuits (got 7 out of the recipe...LOL), so they took about 20 minutes to cook instead of the regular time.

These were perfect and went great with stew!  But they also would taste great on their own with some butter!  A keeper!

Light, tender, flaky...and so QUICK to make!!  These are YUMMY biscuits, and the easy preparation is great for busy mornings when I'm trying to get my family out the door!!  Put an egg or slice of sausage in there, and you have a cheap, delicious biscuit that rivals any restaurant!!  I made mine twice as big as the recipe calls for, and they turned out great.  They do fall apart a little, so you have to handle them carefully.  But, you get to skip all the kneading, cutting, and MESS!!  Thanks, Angela, for this great recipe!!

Easy, easy easy, did I mention these are easy? Delicious, I love drop biscuits because they are no trouble. My batch only made 10 biscuits I think the recipe said the yield was 12. Served with homemade sausage gravy and eggs. Way better than the yellow box drop biscuits!

I followed the recommendations of others and deleted the cream of tartar. However I also substituted 1 cup of the all purpose flour for a cup of whole wheat white flour and in my experience you need a little extra leavening when you do that, so I added about 1/3 of a tsp more of baking powder. I dropped teaspoonfuls of the dough over  a homemade simmering berry/apple compote to make berries and dumplings. I left the lid off for a few minutes to promote lightness then put the lid on, turned it down to very low and simmered for about 12 minutes. (You check them with a fork to see if the insides are cooked yet.) Mmmmm, they turned out great! (Drop biscuits generally make fabulous dumplings. I use them for chicken and dumplings too, but today we wanted something sweet.) I wasn't sure about the melted butter thing, but I was in a hurry to feed the kids before school so I tried it and I'm glad I did. Oh, and I baked up about 1/3 of the dough as biscuits because I didn't need it all for the dumplings. They also were lovely. TIP: if you smooth over the bumpy lumpies on the drop biscuits before baking with a silicone brush dipped in melted butter, people won't even know you used a drop biscuit recipe AND the butter makes the outsides crust up a teeny bit and sooo yummy!

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  They were so simple, I didn't think they'd be all that great, but they were!  Wonderful texture, very tender.  Took less than 5 minutes to whip up.  Used skim milk and half whole wheat pastry flour.  I've been looking for an easy recipe without shortening, and I've found a great one!

I couldn't believe how tasty these were for how simple the ingredients are. My only changes were I didn't have cream of tartar so I left it out and soured the milk for that butter milk flavor. (You add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to your measuring cup and then fill with milk to the 1 cup line and let sit for a few min.) They were so moist and light and flaky! These are going to be one of staple recipes now!!

This is my go to recipe for biscuits! It is easily doubled and very easy to put together.  I love to add 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and then brush them hot out of the oven with a garlic and butter mixture. Just like Red Lobster's!!!

This is a very quick and easy drop biscuit recipe.  The texture of these biscuits is light and flaky and they have a nice buttery flavor.  I have added cheese and spices and they are delicious.  I made this when I didn't have any Bisquick on hand, and now I don't see any need to ever buy biscuit mix again.  Great recipe!

The best and easiest drop biscuits I've ever made.  I leave out the cream of tartar.  The recipe is SO versatile!  Add a TBSP (each) of garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning, a cup of shredded cheese, or 1 TBSP cinnamon and 1/2 sugar, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mix before you bake.  The possibilities are endless with these.

Wow, this recipe makes the easiest food to make even easier!  I ended up w/ 16 good sized biscuits and sub.ed applesauce for the butter and just used water for the milk (I was out) and they turned out just fabulous! (and only 56 calories a piece-- you can't beat that!)

These were SO YUMMY!  I served them with butter and honey and I can't stress how much we liked them!  I think next time I'll make them a little bigger - maybe a 2 TBS size.  A hint - spray your scoop (whatever you use to scoop out the biscuits) with non-stick spray and they'll fall right out without a sticky mess.

This is a great biscuit all the way around.  Easy to make and simple too.  I have also made these by putting all the dough on my baking stone and spreading out....topped with sausage and cheese and baked.  Absolutely wonderful.  The only thing I changed with the ingredients is that I added more salt.  I added about an extra 1/2 teaspoon.  
This recipe will be a keeper in our home :o)  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe today and absolutely loved it. It is the most moist, tender, flaky, light biscuit I  have ever made, and I  have made a LOT. No other one I ever made can compare to these. I made it exactly like the recipe states (imagine, not changing it and THEN rating it) and had no problem with them. I even had to let them sit for about 15 minutes until my oven was free and I could reset the temp and they came out delicious. My granddaughter loved them too. If people are complaining about them being too crunchy or bland, they overcooked them and the butter and honey can spruce them up fast, even though they really don't need any embellishments.

I wanted to make drop biscuits to go with stew, but didn't have any biscuit mix. this recipe was easy and they came out GREAT! Hubby Ed said he did not need to put any butter on them, they were good on their own. I did forget to add the cream of tartar, but they still came out fluffy and just like the box mix. I'm also going to use this recipe to make dumplings, instead of baking them just drop them into boiling soup or stew. Thanks for a quick, easy and delicious recipe!

These are perfect, just like from red lobster if you add some cheddar cheese. I left out the cream of tarter. They are also wonderful w/ butter and honey (without the cheese) for breakfast.

VERY quick, easy, and tasty!  I love how you can stir these by hand (no mixer necessary) and how you don't have to roll them out like traditional biscuits. 

The first time I made these, I used canola oil instead of the melted butter, as some suggested, and I substituted rice milk for the cow's milk (we have dairy, soy, and egg allergies in our house).  I left out the cream of tartar, and I increased the salt to 1/2 t. and the sugar to 1T.

I used a large scoop and was able to make more than 12 biscuits (about 16).  The only downside was that they flattened out quite a bit while baking, and they were also very crumbly on the bottom (but maybe this was due to my alterations?).  

I made them the same way the next time, except I baked them in a greased muffin tin (instead of on a cookie sheet) and used the cream of tartar.  They held together so much better! 

I will definitely make these again and again! THANKS!

These are so easy & tasty!  I make them at least four times a week.  I omit the cream of tarter, and they come out fine.  I also put 1/2c of finely shredded colby/jack cheese in the mix. Plus these make awesome dumplings!!  Thanks for such an easy shortcut:)

Oh my goodness!  These are the BEST biscuits I have EVER eaten!  I halfed the recipe because it was just my husband and I eating, but should have made the entire batch because we want more!  Thank you so much.  I will never buy refridgerator biscuits ever again.  They melt in your mouth!  Thanks!!

These are phenomenal.  I do leave out the tartar, and add onions, bacon, and cheese.  I could live inside of these biscuits and just eat my way out, and be happy for my whole life.

These biscuits were very easy!  And the cook time and serving size were right on.  But I didn't care for them...  They tasted too much of baking powder for us.  Maybe lots of herbs or seasonings would help to hide it?  Thanks for sharing, Angela.

There are easy and they bake up light and fluffy - BUT- they lack flavor.  Needs more salt.

This was a very easy recipe and while the hubby loved it, I disliked them, I followed fellow member's advice about the cream of tartar and they turned out very dry and tasted very bland.

Perfect biscuits.  I substituted Buttermilk for the milk and used a muffin tin to keep them neat looking.

These were easy, and the whole family loved them with the following alterations.  I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry and 1 cup white whole wheat flours.  I substituted applesauce for the butter and omitted sugar ~ this requires greasing your pan a bit more to prevent sticking.  I also added some chopped scallions and a handful of shredded cheddar.  Excellent flavor and texture!

I was so excited to find a biscuit recipe that didn't require shortening! It's a perfect base recipe that I needed - adapting it is easy. I made it for my incredibly picky guy last night, and dumped in a wallop of crushed garlic, and he thought it was fantastic. I think next time I'll experiment with some rosemary too.

Foolproof. It cannot get any easier than this recipe. I made  a great bbq chicken dinner the other night and the meal "screamed" biscuits! Since I was on the tail end of dinner being done, I needed something fast and this recipe was it. Like a lot of others, I left out the cream of tartar. Really, you do not need it at all, so don't get bummed if you don't have any. Watch the liquids. Add the butter, then 1/2 cup of milk and stir. Add the rest of the milk a little bit at a time until it is all moistened. You don't want these too wet.  To spruce up my biscuits, I added some parsley flakes(1/4 cup) along with 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese that I needed to use up. I have to say that something so fast and so easy became the instant hit at our dinner!

This is certainly a good base recipe but I did tweak it a little bit.

Like others have said, this recipe actually works without the cream of tartar. I've baked them with and without the cream of tartar and both times worked.

Secondly, they're kind of bland as is. In most recipes, 2 cups of flour call for 1/2 teaspoon of salt so I increased that ingredient by doubling the 1/4 teaspoon the recipe calls for.

I did decide to turn mine into more dessert-like biscuits so I swapped the 2 teaspoons of white sugar for 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla into the melted butter/milk mixture.  I served them with sweetened strawberries (old fashioned strawberry shortcake style) and they were awesome!

I didn't have any cream of tartar so I just made the recipe without. I think these were my favorite drop biscuits ever! Very light and tasty. I actually used this recipe as a topping for a pot pie, and I hate a slimy bottom on a biscuit top. So I dropped the whole recipe onto a parchment-covered baking sheet, flattened it out to the size of my pot pie dish, pre-baked it on the bottom rack for about 8 minutes at 375, then carefully slid it onto the pot pie and baked the whole thing at 350 for about 15 more minutes. The pot pie filling was already hot so the additional bake time is really just to get the biscuit done.

This is really the first allrecipes recipe that didn't work for me.  Although my husband thought these tasted fine as long as they were doused in honey, I thought they were super bland.  I mixed the dry ingredients well and only mixed the wet ingredients in until just moistened.  I also double checked the ingredients list to make sure I used the right amount of everything.  I appear to have followed the recipe exactly, so I'm really not sure what went wrong.  I won't be making these again.

I'm not sure what went wrong but the biscuits spread out everywhere and the butter ran out onto the oven element and caught the oven on fire.

These were really simple,quick,and easy to make. I made them to go along with some gravy. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't think the biscuits themselves weren't flavorful enough to eat by themselves....but they were perfect to go along with the gravy I made! Next time I'll use buttermilk and add some garlic and cheese

I thought these were very good and love that I don't need shortening for them. One question though, mine turned out like puffed up cookies. The dough seemed to be too soft. They didn't look quite right, but tasted great!

Amazingly easy recipe. They don't need cream of tartar. My variation was to use an ice-cream scoop to make the biscuits more uniform and not get my fingers too sticky.  They turned out really nice, light, fluffy golden, but only eleven.  You could use a smaller scoop, but who doesn't like big biscuits?  I tried half with cheese and half without.  Hot biscuits taste the same, but after cooled the cheesey biscuits are more appetizing.

This is a good recipe.  I was out of bisquick and needed to make some drop biscuits.  I'm vegan, so used melted earth balance instead of the butter and coconut milk instead of the milk.  I didn't need all of the coconut milk, but did use most of it.  The biscuits are soft and a little richer than those made with bisquick.  My son is scarfing them down like a little bandit, so they've passed the test.

Very versatile recipe! I made these for strawberry shortcake, so I added extra sugar and a dash of vanilla. Turned out great! I can also see turning these into super quick "scones" by adding raisins/dried fruit into the dough.

The best biscuits I have ever had, and so quick and easy!!  I prefer them WITH the cream of tartar, and have added cheese and dried herbs on several occasions (cheddar and thyme is my fave).  They are best warm, but if I make them at night, they still work just fine for an egg-and-cheese.  I just pop it in the toaster oven long enough to warm it and crisp it a little on the outside.

Wow- my cream of tartar must have been old, because mine came out rather flat. But no one minded as the fam scarfed em down! I found this in a hurried search for something to go with my beef stew & this fit the bill. Seemed like a lot of butter, but my FLAT biscuits were tasty & kind of crunchy around the edges. YUM. Can't wait to try them with fresh cream of tartar. Thanks!

I have used this recipe many times and with great success; making them for guests or potlucks is a snap. Feta cheese, olives, onion, fresh herbs, garlic, chicken soup base, leftover mushroom sauce... it ALWAYS works, no matter what I throw in it. Thank you!

Great to find a recipe with melted butter! I omitted the cream of tartar, added about a teaspoon of granulated garlic, 2 tablespoons chopped (jar) garlic, and 3 handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese. There are 7 of us in my family, so I just divided the dough to make 7 biscuits --and then baked them at 410 for about 20 minutes. Next time I will add more salt, but it worked well with this meal, because I served a beef pot roast for the first time, and it was a little too salty. Will certainly make again - thanks!

I would give these 5 stars but my husband said they tasted too baking powdery!  I loved them and the baking powder flavor.  The only change I made was I added baking soda in place of the cream of tarter and I added a tablespoon of vinegar to the milk 5 minutes before putting the milk in the mix-to make buttermilk.  They are 5 stars in my book!

These were good, but mine did not rise very much.  They were very flat, almost like a fluffy cookie. I will try to make these again though and try to change a few things!  Maybe they will trun out better with a little help!

I normally make biscuits that require a little more time/effort with rolling and cutting. I decided to give this one a try as I was short on time. It is *very* easy as the name implies. I gave it 4 stars only because they were a little bland. I think next time I will add the cheddar cheese and brush the biscuits right from the oven with butter and garlic powder (1/4 C melted butter to 1/4 t garlic powder ratio) like the Red Lobster biscuits.

I halved the recipe and used 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda instead of baking powder as I didn't have any on hand and threw in some shredded mixed-cheese (so I can use them before they go bad).  It made 5 scone-like biscuit.  It was great - probably not as soft as it would be if I had use baking powder.  I'm not a great chef and this was an easy recipe to follow.

Incredibly bland.  Maybe the recipe should specify salted butter, if that's what it requires.  I used unsalted, which is what I always use, and thought they were way too bland and flavorless.  If I make it again, I'll either use salted butter or increase the salt.

Double the recipe, and make your biscuits bigger, at least 3 times what the recipe calls for, then you have excellent biscuits!!!  Best eaten the same day!

These certainly were quick and easy, but they were pretty bland for having so much butter in them.  Not worth the calories for me.

I needed something quick, and quick these were! Extremely easy to make, but a tad on the bland side.  Slathered in butter they were rather enjoyable.  I did love that they only took 2 minutes to make, which means I will surely make them again when pressed for time.

Wonderful, light, airy, delicious biscuits!  This recipe works very well with soy milk.  This is the newest addition to my recipe collection and I definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a great drop recipe, in a pinch!

I've made this dozens of times and I've never used the cream of tartar.  First because I didn't have any and other reviewers said it wouldn't matter and then because everyone loved them so much without it that I figured why fix it if it ain't broke!
This is now my go-to biscuit.  We've added all kinds of things to them - cheese, ham, bacon, sausage, herbs, jalapenos.  Never any leftover.

I have made these biscuits a number of times, and my husband and I both love them. They are a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They aren't as dry as some biscuits seem to be. This recipe makes 11-12 good-sized biscuits. I melt the butter in the microwave, and then add the milk to cool it. Then I add the milk and butter to the dry mix. Don't over mix. Mix just until the dry ingredients are all moistened. For baking, it always takes 18 minutes to brown the tops of the biscuits in my oven. We never eat all of the biscuits for one meal. They warm very well when wrapped in a paper towel, put into a plastic baggie, and heated in the microwave for 45 seconds or so. I have had them in the frig for as much as a week and they still warm in the microwave like I just baked them.

These are incredible.  I can't believe how good these are, seriously.  I didn't add the cream of tartar because I didn't have any, and instead of dropping them I made them in a muffin pan - the recipe made 12. I had to cook it for 16 minutes.  They were light, buttery, sweet, delicious.  Will make again and again!

These are awesome! Of course I had to play with it a bit and make it mine by adding 1 tblsp of garlic powder and substituting 1/4 cup if the butter with bacon grease and it's awesome!! Shredded cheese is good too. :-)

Amazing! Made these this morning for biscuits and gravy. No changes made, perfect as is. I used real salted butter and will next time too. I have a big family of hearty eating boys. Doubling the recipe seemed like too much, so I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and had no issues with the results. This will be my go to recipe from now on. I can not wait to add bacon/cheese, herbs/garlic/parmesan. Thank you so much Miss Angela!

My husband loves it when I make these!  I modified the recipe slightly based on the recommendations of other reviews.  I omitted the cream of tartar and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  Also, instead of adding melted butter, I grated a frozen stick of butter into the mix.  The little flakes melt beautifully into the batter, and the biscuits turn out deliciously buttery and crunchy every time!  I have also substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose flour without any problems.  You have to try this recipe!

Great and FAST way to start a biscuit morning!  I use an ice cream scoop to lay each biscuit on parchment paper cookie sheet.  Didn't have cream of tarter and came out great.  Also, they reheat in oven perfectly.  I don't think anyone could mess these up!!  I think the bigger the scoop the better the biscuit, although you will only get 6-8 biscuits!!  Oh, they freeze nicely too.

Great for a very basic biscuit. I sifted the flour to make it more airy. My husband loved them, but we both agreed that the recipe may need a tad more salt. I think I will use 1/2 tsp next time instead of 1/4. I love that this is a no mess quick recipe that can be modified. I'm also going to try adding herbs and cheese the next time I make them so they aren't so bland. Thanks!

I am lazy and hate the thought of rolling and cutting regular biscuits.  This recipe works perfect for me!  Great tasting with butter, jam, or honey.  My 3 yr old requested these to go with stew the other night.  I did omit the tartar as others recommended.  They are perfect - thanks for sharing!!!

I followed the recipe and then added some shredded white cheddar and some garlic powder (a teaspoon or so).  Used the baking powder and cream of tartar in the amounts specified.  The dough was just the right consistency for a drop biscuit.

At 5 minutes into baking they were nicely puffed. At 10 minutes they needed a few more to brown properly.  They baked for a total of 15 minutes.  The taste is quite nice.  Maybe a bit more garlic powder, or chopped green onion/chives would have been good.  But otherwise, with the flavour additions, these were pretty spot on.

These were so tasty and so fast and easy to whip up along a hearty bowl of soup. I added 1 cup of grated cheddar and baked them on my PC stoneware baking sheet and they turned out perfectly. Delicious!

VERY GOOD AND LIGHT. I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BECAUSE I AM SO USE TO BISUITS MADE WITH SHORTENING. BUT THESE WERE VERY NICE AND QUICK, REALLY DOES BEAT BISCUITS FROM THE CAN. I MADE THEM WITHOUT THE CREAM OF TARTAR BUT I AM TRYING THEM AGAIN WITH THE CREAM OF TARTAR JUST TO SEE IF I WILL GET A MORE COMPLEX FLAVOR. BUT I WILL SAY THESE WILL BECOME A STAPLE IN HOUSE

Super easy recipe, and super yummy biscuits! They took about 15 minutes total to throw together, I added the cheese and omitted the tartar, and they turned out perfectly fluffy, moist, and golden on the outside. Delicious recipe - so much better (and cheaper!) than buying canned biscuits!

I'll probably make these again because they get the job done, but they didn't have much flavor. I cut the recipe in half and omitted the cream of tartar. They were easy, but I wasn't impressed with the taste.

Great little biscuit! Tender, fluffy, and moist. These had a "buttermilk" flavor to them maybe that was the cream of tartar? Very good recipe and they turned out well. I cut this in half and got 4 biscuits from it. Thanks for a wonderful fast little breakfast bread.

This was a great recipe as is.  
I've also baked these up with some shredded cheddar and garlic powder - when they came out of the oven, I brushed a butter/garlic/salt/italian seasoning mix on top. Rivaled the infamous Cheddar Bay Biscuits from Red Lobster -SO GOOD!

This recipe is so quick & easy. I love biscuits and being able to whip them up in a snap is just wonderful. I don't add the cream of tartar, it's just something I never have in my pantry. I love adding various ingredients to them as well, like different cheeses! and they're great to go along with gravy!

Taste great better for Gravy's they crumble really easy and are not very thick.  If making a sandwich I just use 2 one for the top the other for the bottom.  Very quick and Very Easy.

These were delish.  I made a few changes to them to make them like "those restaurant ones" and they were INCREDIBLE!!  Will be making these again and again.  Made this but omitted cream of tartar.  Added 1 cup shredded cheddar.  Baked 10 minutes.  Make sure to REALLY oil your pan or they will stick!!  Or use parchment paper.  Brushed the top with:  1/2 c melted butter, pinch salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, pinch onion powder, pinch parsley all mixed together.  Baked another 1 minute.  These were AWESOME!!

These were very good. I skipped the cream of tartar because I didn't have any on hand, and added about 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and served them with a lentil and smoked sausage soup. Kids loved them.

Our new family favorite!  I didn't have cream of tartar, and it seems fine. We also have halved the recipe and still made 12 (small) biscuits with no problem. Thanks!

these are so easy to make and they are very good, I made a batch with white flour and a batch with wheat flour and they both tasted great.  I had some half and half that needed to be used, so I used that instead of milk and omitted the cream of tartar.  I will never buy biscuits from the store again!!

VERY easy to make.  Light and fluffy.  I left mine in the oven just a couple minutes longer because I love a golden brown crust on my biscuits.  I served them with mango butter and peach butter - but no one used either.  The biscuits were stars all by themselves!  If you're thinking of a way to get kids involved in the kitchen - this is a great family-friendly recipe!  ENJOY!

I tried these for dinner tonight.  I needed something quick that my 2 year old would eat.  I halved the recipe and added shredded cheddar cheese and baked in a mini muffin tin.  it made a perfect amount for the 12 muffin tin.  YUM!  We made a meal of them with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  Really great and quick!  Thanks!!

Very easy.  My son can't eat dairy so I substituted plain soy milk and canola oil.  They came out great.  I cooked them in my cast iron drop biscuit pan, wonderfully crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside.  I also made a variation by using applesause and soy milk, adding cinnamon and apple chunks.  I added a little more sugar to sweeten and they are a great dessert.  I have always added more fluid than it calls for, probably about 1/2cup more since I am baking them in cast iron pan.

These bisciuts were excellent!  They were light and flaky just like a rolled biscuit but so much easier--I onmitted the tartar like others did and they turned out great.  I made them to go with soup for dinner, but they would be just as delicious with butter and jam for breakfast.  They will be made (and eaten!) regularly in our house.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  Just wonderful.  My four children and husband really enjoyed them.  I will be using this recipe for Strawberry Shortcakes..=)  I made them with whole wheat flour and they turned out so good.  I did add a tad extra milk.  It seems baking with whole wheat it is hard to get a tenderness/flakey texture like this without adding part white flour.  Not this recipe...YUM!! Thank you!

So amazing! I use a grater to shred the butter into the dry ingredients and then mix in either dried berries and nuts (breakfast) or garlic and cheese and herbs (savory) before slowly blending in the milk and baking.
My boys LOVE the buttery texture of the nut and berries.
(By the way I suck at baking but can make these all day long! Easy to make!)

These biscuits are easy to make & delicious. I skipped the cream of tarter as I feel it is not needed. I measured all the other ingredients except for the milk. I just poured in a little at a time until the dough came together. I mixed lightly and then shaped the dough into loose “balls” with my hands and placed on baking sheet. Perfection!

The trick to super flaky biscuits is to not melt but cube the butter. Add cubes into dry mix and slowly add in the milk. Mix with your hands- it's messy but fun. This way pieces of butter melt as the biscuits bake- and they become fluffy and flaky!

These were so easy to make! I watched the video and made them as the video did, using an ice cream scoop. I got only 10 biscuits and had to bake them longer. My only complaint is that they need more salt.

Easy and adaptable, no cream of tartar, subbed olive oil for butter.  Next time will add a little more flour, and some spices.

These are fantastic and are so easy to make! They've become the staple in our house. Sometimes I'll mix in some shredded cheddar cheese and granulated garlic to change it up.  I leave out the cream of tartar and just add a little extra baking soda.

I never made home biscuits before. I don't bake. But I want to learn. I read multiple recipes and reviews on so many biscuits. I don't have a biscuit cutter. I don't have Cream of Tarter. I don't have buttermilk (but learned how to make to make it..via All Recipes). So I thought I could conquer this highly rated (easy) recipe. -I added pepper, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes. SO GOOD. Will make many times again.

I used this as a base recipe tonight. I omitted the Cream of Tartar and I added 2 tsp Garlic Powder, 3 tsp Onion Flakes, and 1 Cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese. I ended up using all the Milk and Melted Butter in the recipe and they came out so awesomely soft and fluffy. I did do Tablespoon Drops of them and came out with just over 2 Dozen Biscuits and baked them for 8 minutes. They came out really great and the whole family enjoyed them.

My mom was a country cook, fried chicken and biscuits every Sunday dinner, biscuits almost every day. This is the biscuit recipe she used at least 3-4 times a week. She rarely made rolled out biscuits, she just didn't have the time. I make these biscuits myself a couple of times a month except I use self rising flour, they don't get quite as fluffy but they are still good. This is a great basic recipe, it's very versatile. I've added extra sugar and a little vanilla to make sweet biscuits for strawberry short cake, added cinnamon and raisins or other dried fruit for an easy sweet treat. My son loves them best with chopped jalapenos, cheddar cheese and a little garlic and onion powder that I make when we have chili or other Tex-Mex. I usually have to make a double batch any time I make them! I really recommend this recipe.

I made them without the cream of tartar as other reviewers had suggested (also because I didn't have any). Turned out great!

Followed the recipe but didn't use cream of tartar and dumbed it down to 6 servings. Delicious! Have fun trying to spread butter on them. I would suggest adding chunks to the mix or, brushing melted butter on immediately after baking. With or without they are still delicious.

I use this recipe for my biscuits ALL the time. The only change I make is to exclude the cream of tartar. I didn't have it the first time I made them, then I saw that other reviewers didn't use it either. 

Sometimes I add shredded cheese and/or spices for different flavors. Some parmesan cheese and italian seasoning make for good easy bread for pasta.

I love this recipe! Just to use up more things in my refrigerator I added 1 cup grated cheddar cheese and 3 green onions to the dry mix (before adding the butter and milk). When they came out of the oven, I had amazingly savory cheddar and green onion biscuits. Yum!! (PS like most people, I did not add the cream of tartar)

So easy, so flaky, so tasty... It's a winner!  I left out the cream of tarter because I didn't have it and they were still wonderful. I mixed just until combined but still really lumpy. Baked exactly 10 minutes on a standard non stick coated cookie sheet with just a little bit of cooking spray. Way better than the ones I've made with crisp and cold stick butter.

Great and easy recipe! I skip the sugar and tartar cream. I also only use a 1/2 cup of milk. You can also use self rising flour and skip the salt and baking powder. Either way they come out perfect every time.  I have also used buttermilk if I have any available. The recipe is a great base for simple biscuits or you can add your own twist like ham and cheddar cheese or garlic powder, Italian seasoning and mozzarella cheese. They won't disappoint.

Could not have been easier.  Shortening has its uses, but butter is the best here.  As someone else suggested, I made 6 large biscuits (for strawberry shortcake), they took 20 minutes to cook that way.  Highly recommended.

Great, easy biscuit recipe! I didn't use the cream of tartar, but I enjoyed the taste and texture of the biscuits. The recipe is very simple, yet versatile. They made awesome ham & cheese biscuit sandwiches on a lazy Saturday morning.

Yummy! 2nd time making these I omitted cream of tartar, and added 3/4 c. shredded Colby jack, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and dried parsley.  I also subbed 1/2 of the flour with white whole wheat  flour.  5 stars for both original recipe and my modified version :)

This is  a great simple recipe. After adding ingredients I realized I was completey out of butter. WHAT!!! I'm a butter fanatic. My epitaph will read "death by butter". However, I used Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil instead of butter as I had that on hand. I'm telling you, these biscuits were off the radar good. I think I will begin substituting in this recipe from now on. My picky kids loved them! They are not chef quality, but really really good and simple to make.

Bland doesn't even begin to describe this recipe, there's just no flavor and I even increased the salt a bit.  I really don't know how most people got this recipe to work.  I cut the milk down to 3/4 a cup and it was STILL too wet. I had to bake them for 20 minutes. They did, however, have plenty of crispy crunch. Way too much butter n milk called for.  I had to add more flour and still thought I'd be sending my son for canned (yuck) biscuits.  Since I made them for biscuits and gravy, they'll do, but I won't make this recipe again.

Delicious, I didn't have cream of tartar but it worked out fine, I had to add about 1/2cup of extra flour because it came out really sticky, to sticky for biscuits in my opinion. But overall a good recipe.

Also made without cream of tartar. Made them like Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits by adding cheddar, 1/4 tsp of garlic salt, and some chopped parsley to dough. Then melt a few tablespoons of butter and add a bit more garlic salt (just a bit - 1/8-1/4 tsp) and brush on biscuits after cooking. Very good!

it occurred to me, as i came back to this recipe for the umpteenth time (to use as a topping for veggie pot pie, because i'm too lazy to buy, let alone make, a pie crust) that i never rated this simple, excellent, go-to recipe. back when i had a fully stocked and functional kitchen, i would always stir in some dried sage. these are versatile and awesome.

Incredibly easy and delicious! I use a large scoop to drop them onto my cookie sheet and keep them all the exact same size. I always have the ingredients on hand and can whip them up in no time. I refuse to buy store bought biscuits/rolls and these make life easy :) Thank you!

Great, easy recipe. We did omit the cream of tartar, increased the salt to 3/4 of a teaspoon, decreased the temp to 400 degrees (could be our oven but the first batch were slightly too dark on the bottom with no color on the top) and BARELY mixed the ingredients. The biscuits were light and fluffy.

Outstanding drop biscuits. Excellent flavor and fluffy. Easy to make. Save just a little melted butter to brush the tops to brown a bit. Rather than break in half to spread butter or jam, spread it on the biscuit bottom which keeps the biscuit from crumbling. I have tried for years to find a drop biscuit recipe this good. The search is over.

Delicious and quick!  So easy yet the results were great!  Hubby loved them so much, he was raving about them to his family at a recent gathering.  Definitely a keeper.

I was in need of a delicious and inexpensive recipe for biscuits when I lost my "old faithful" recipe last minute. The only differences I were that I baked them without the cream of tartar (because we did not have any in the cupboard) and reduced their size by almost half due to lack of time. I served them up with some home made turkey soup and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Mom says she has never ate biscuits this tasty in her life. I will be replacing my "old faithful" recipe for this one. Thank you for the recpie!

This recipe is amazing! These were my first biscuits and I'll stick to them. I used .5 cup of half-and-half combined with .5 cup of skim milk (that's what I had). Also, I omitted the cream of tartar. They are so easy and fast! I love making brunch at home with family or friends and I will be making these a lot. Thank you!

I only had margarine and self rising flour, so I made 1/2 recipe to see how it would go.  I mixed 1/2 stick of lightly melted margarine with 1/2 cup of milk and a tsp or so of sugar.  Then I dumped a cup of flour in the bowl and barely mixed, just to moisten and come together.  Dropped heaping spoonfuls of dough onto pan sprayed with canola oil and ended up with five 2 1/2 inch biscuits that were absolutely tender and wonderful with crisp edges after eleven minutes.  I'm so excited because I'm no good at traditional biscuits and they're somewhat of a hassle and a mess.  This couldn't have been easier and with a fantastic result, too.  Just don't over mix.  I'm sure that was the trouble for anyone with flat biscuits
Have made these again a few times...shredded cheese and garlic powder make a great cheese biscuit and I'm sure you could make a few interesting modifications.  Can't get any easier than the self rising flour method either.

These were extremely easy and very tasty.  I was a little skeptical at first that they would be so delicious given that it was such a simple recipe...but they were fabulous!  I also omitted the cream of tartar, since its not something that I have in the pantry.  I don't know what that ingredient would bring to the party but they were delicious and light and flaky without it.

I think these biscuits are great for a quick fix! I didn't have any cream of tartar, so skipped that.

What did I do wrong??? These biscuits were as flat as pancakes and totally inedible. I even opened a fresh new can of baking powder! The only think I changed was I omitted the sugar as I don't have a sweet tooth. Other than that, to the letter of the recipe. If anyyone can shed light on my mistake, I'd love to hear what I did wrong, as I assume from the positive ratings that it must have been my mistake!

Gets 5 stars for the easy factor and taste combined.  I prefer these types of biscuits with my sausage gravy, it seems to hold up a lot better.  Was a little crumbly (which I like) but not dry.  Husband also approved, will be using this one again.

I was looking for something quick and easy and these are perfect! Left out cream or tartar and used 1/2 cup regular milk and half cup sweetened condensed milk. Came out great!!! Also brushed tops with a little melted butter before putting in oven. Served with homemade honey butter and jam. Delicious and easy!!!

I love how quick and easy this recipe is! I've used other recipes on this site that are good but require kneading, rolling and cutting. I was looking for a recipe that was quick but also tasty as a last minute addiction to go with my Shrimp Scampi. I added some cheddar and parmesan cheese and these were amazing. I also left out the cream of tartar based on other reviews. Well make again for breakfast without the cheese.

These were pretty good and definitely easy.  I doubled the recipe and increased the salt by 1/4 tsp. and yet still thought they were a little bland.  Also, they were quite crumbly but I'm thinking that may have to do with doubling the recipe, next time I do I'll cut back a little on the baking powder and cream of tartar.

I had a last minute emergency with the bread I had bought for dinner (it was bad even though I had just bought it) so I quickly did a search on drop biscuits and this one came up.  I seriously had them mixed and ready to go in three minutes.  I used an ice cream scoop to quickly get them on the baking sheet.  The rest of the dinner was baking at 375 so I threw them in hoping for the best.  Ten minutes later I had wonderful biscuits.  I will make these again and again.  They are delicious and half the cost of buying them at the store.  Plus they are fresh baked with dinner.

Just a note.....I was surprised that the dough was wetter than I thought, but don't worry, I still got great biscuits that rose beautifully even with the wetter dough (not super sticky).  I think this is how it is supposed to be.

Thanks for the post.  This one was a dinner saver and definitely a keeper.

Fantastic beyond words. To be able to whip up biscuits in 15 minutes is a dream come true! Thank you...for the record I left out the cream of tarter as I do not care for the taste. Don't hesitate..make these biscuits and you'll be a star!

According to my son this biscuits were delicious. And to me this biscuits were so easy to make. Just because I was making breakfast at the same time but for next time I will be putting butter on top before they finish baking for that extra flavor. I do recommend and will be making them again.

Very flaky and tender!  I used white wheat flour, almond milk instead of cow's, and grapeseed oil instead of butter.  Came out fantastic, just melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  I will definitely keep this recipe, thanks!

I'm going to try this recipe based on the reviews without the cream of tartar.  Also, I prefer a savoury bread, so I will add only 1/2 tsp sugar, and some garlic powder and chopped jalapeños.  
Lastly, I plan to add a big handful of parm or cheddar cheese, and reduce the fat to 1/4-1/3 c, and use oil instead of butter.

These were so good! I used butter milk in place of milk, added cheese, fresh pressed to the melted butter garlic, fresh chopped parsley, and a small jar of pimentos.  AMAZING!  If you sprinkled with garlic salt as well, they would taste very similar to red lobster biscuits, but even better.  I baked them in my cast iron skillet in the oven.   I will be making these again.

We LOVE these! I melted the butter on the stove-top  (it was frozen) and then added the milk to heat through. I used 1 1/2 cups  wheat flour and the rest white  (oh I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for later use). I also added browned and drained breakfast sausage then when the biscuits were done we just put gravy over them and had B&G for brunch! Super easy and so very yummy!! Thanks for such an easy recipe that is adapted so very well to make just what we needed!

Since moving to Ireland where "biscuits" are cookies, they don't have anything like this here. It is great to have a simple recipe that I can whip up in just about the same time as placing pre-made biscuits on a pan and baking them. Thanks.

Excellent basic drop biscuit recipe.  I omitted the cream of tartar and they puffed up really big.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 cup of shredded cheese.  They turned out so delicious and were a hit with the husband and my 4 and 2 year old boys!!  **Update-due to dietary restrictions, I made these dairy-free with coconut oil and almond milk and they still turned out delicious!!  This is definitely my go-to recipe!!!!!

Came out tasting a bit bitter.  Next time I will try without cream of tarter as other reviewers posted.  Like the recipe because of the ease of it but won't make again if I can't figure out that odd taste.

These are unbelievable!  But beware of teenage boys...they will demolish them in no time flat!  I hadn't made drop biscuits in a long time because mine always seemed dry (my mom's recipe).  These are so moist.  I added about a cup of Fiesta blend cheese when I made them. Next time I might try adding garlic and see if they turn out like Ruby Tuesdays biscuits (that's what the texture reminded me of).

A little dry, but that may be due to my baking. :)

Otherwise a simple and tasty recipe!

Batter was too wet.  I may try again but add the wet ingredients more slowly and in a lesser quantity.  The "biscuits" were still delicious, just not the texture I was looking for.

I just made these for our biscuits and gravy lunch, and they are so delicious.  I followed the advice from other commenters and did not put in the cream of tarter and so glad that I did.  They taste fantastic, no more biquick for us!

Yay!  So easy!  So yummy!  I took out the cream of tartar and the sugar, I added parmesan cheese and pepper.  I poured it over a hot pot pie filling and cooked it as the crust.  It took way longer for the middle to cook - more like 30 minutes.  But it was so worth it.  I think I like this better than regular crust!  And it's so much easier!

I left out the cream of tartar too.  These are so moist yet crunchy on the outside!  I added 1/2 tsp dill weed and 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning.  Really good!

These biscuits burnt a little even though I checked them after 6 minutes. I think I'll reduce the heat next time. Otherwise these were great, very easy and no rolling pin!

I've been using this recipe for a while now and it's amazing every time.  It's incredibly easy and yields amazing biscuits every time.  I even use this recipe for the dumplings in my chicken and dumpling soup! Oh, and the other thing is that most of these items are staples in my kitchen.

I made these last night; I didn't have baking powder, so I used self-rising flour and omitted the cream of tartar and salt. Also, I made a huge mistake. I put in 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2 teaspoons! I was worried the biscuits would be way too sweet, but I ended up being glad for my mistake. They were awesome! This is going to be my go-to recipe when I need some quick, easy and delicious bread!!

I made this gluten-free and the biscuits turned out very well. I baked for 9 minutes and they were perfect. I suggest moving them right off of the cookie sheet though, as mine ended up being a little too 'done' on the bottom. I think this was because I left them on the cookie sheet too long. I did not add the cream of tartar and I used Jules Gluten Free Flour, which has xanthan gum in it already. Very good and easy- will make again.

Great biscuits! They were very light and fluffy. I made them with water because I ran out of milk. Will try them again with milk next time around. I also made some lighter and some with a little more color for those of us who like them darker. Just add a tab of butter and they were perfect.

Awesome recipe. I was missing a few ingredients like  butter and sugar so had to adjust.  I just used 1/2 cup of olive oil. They came out fine even without adding sugar. Thanks Angela!!!

I have a gluten sensitivity, so I replaced the flour with all purpose gluten free flour mix and 3/4 tsp of guar gum for half of a recipe. I also used oil since I did not have butter, they turned out more smooth than I would have expected, but they made awesome breakfast sandwiches!

I love cheesy garlic biscuits but could only find the recipe for the premade mix. I found this, use garlic instead of sugar and mix about 1 cup cheese and just a tad bit more milk. When I pull them out I brush garlic and butter over the top and taste just like in the restraunt!

These were excellent.  I got up this morning planning to make sausage, cheese biscuits for a trip and realized I was out of bisquick.  Found this recipe and used it without the cream of tartar (I had none), and they turned out fantastic!  Better than my usual ones made with bisquick.  Thank you Angela, very easy and good recipe.

I made these tonight to go with sausage gravy for dinner. I went by the instructions but I was in a hurry and all the butter hadn't melted when I dumped it and the milk into the dry stuff. I fished it out re-nooked it and poured the butter on top right before tossing them in my oven. I baked them in a cast iron pan with just a drop or two of butter in the bottom. They turned out AMAZING and dinner was on the table in a half an hour.

I also do shredded cheddar, and I added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder and did them in regular and mini muffin pans.  My 4 1/2 yr old son ate one of each and wanted more!  Yummms all around :)

As other reviewers suggested, I omitted the cream of tartar. My family loves these biscuits. I make them several times a month and will no longer buy the store bought tubes of biscuits. 

A couple weeks ago, I made homemade yogurt and saved the whey from that. I used the whey in this recipe instead of milk and they were even better.

These were really tasty and easy. I used unsalted butter because it's what I had on hand, so I doubled the salt to make up for it. I baked them for only half the time and then took them out of the oven. I then made an indention in the top of each biscuit and filled it with jam (like thumbprint cookies) before baking them for the remaining time. They were great when fresh.

I've been using this recipe for months now... I use it each time I make biscuits & (sausage) gravy. They break up nicely and absorb the gravy well... way better than any cut-out biscuit in a can.

These are excellent and very easy to make. I have tried them with and without the cream of tarter and they are definitely better with it. It gives the biscuits a fuller and more flavorful taste.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe, although I made some alterations. I used cold margarine and cut it into the dry ingredients, instead of melting it. I omitted the cream of tartar, and used 1/2 teaspoon of salt rather than 1/4 teaspoon. Cooked them for 10 minutes, and they turned out perfect! Very fluffy biscuits and very easy recipe. 5 stars!

Great recipe and so easy. I made it last night for a dinner party.  I'm only giving four stars because I didn't use cream of tartar so I didn't make the recipe with the exact ingredients.  Very tasty!

Omitted the cream of tartar as recommended by others - turned out very fluffy and moist.  Next time might add some cheese and brush with garlic butter for more flavor and better color

I cut the recipe in half, made 4 biscuits. I omitted the sugar & tartar, and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 teas. freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 teas. of Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning and a pinch of finely crushed rosemary. Wow!

Love this easy, yummy recipe!  Loved that it was all homemade and not from a can. I used the cream of tartar- no problem.  Next time I will brush with butter or add onion and make onion bisquits.  So many things you can do with this ...

These are absolutely my go-to biscuits!  I used to think canned biscuits were my only option when dealing with two little kids first thing in the morning, but not anymore.  These take little more effort than opening that can and they taste ten times better!  Thank you for a great recipe!

OMG, I just put Red Lobster's biscuits to shame with this recipe! I did make some additions: I mixed in grated Fiscalini San Joaquin Gold cheese, and then sprinkled the top of eat biscuit with garlic salt before baking. So easy and adaptable. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

These are delicious! I substituted 1 cup of AP flour with whole wheat, added crumbled bacon & cheddar cheese & just a touch of olive oil while leaving out the cream of tartar. My kids loved them & will be taking them in their lunch to school. Thanks!

EZ? Y-E-S!  I did a test batch using 1/4 recipe.  I even added 1 tsp flax meal to the flour and the flavor and texture were perfect.  I did not use the tartar, because I do not prefer the flavor it adds and I noticed no ill effects.  These will make a wonderful, portable breakfast in the morning.

I mixed these up and plopped them on top of a chicken-pot-pie filling. Next time I'll lower the oven temp and bake a little longer - the tops were done, but a few of the bottoms weren't. Used shortening and rice milk to make them suitable for our daughter with many food allergies. Looking forward to making them on their own!!

My family loves this recipe.  The baking powder (can find recipe on this sit) has, salt, cream of tarter has baking soda in it, so leaving out the cream of tarter should not make a difference.

These are not impressive, but they are good when you are pressed for time in the morning and don't feel like spending an hour in the kitchen. They were crumbly and looked weird.

this recipe is very simple, makes a great simple biscuit and can be portioned down to suit your needs. I skipped adding cream of tartar, as previous reviewers reported it changed the taste and was unnecessary. it worked well.

My husband was looking for a recipe for biscuits to make for sausage gravy (his first time for both). I found this recipe. So simple. Others were right about this lacking in flavor. I wish I knew what was missing. The recipe was followed to the T. These were great with the sausage gravy though. Excellent outside and great consistency inside!

I was also pleasantly surprised by this simple recipe!  I wanted a quick and easy biscuit that didn't take long to bake, as I usually use the recipe from 'The Joy of Cooking' and it takes a bit longer to bake.  I did however cut in my fat, skipped the cream of tartar, and decreased the sugar a bit.  Using a tablespoon to drop, this recipe yielded 24 biscuits.

I forgot to buy bread to serve with my corned beef and cabbage paddy's day dinner, so I needed to find something I could make quickly. This was my first experience making biscuits from scratch, so I was a bit nervous about the outcome. Wow, they turned out fantastic! Took others' advice and left out the cream of tartar. I added a few shakes each of garlic and onion powder, and 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese. These turned out so buttery and flavorful - my only regret is that I didn't double the batch! I will be making these again soon. Thank you!!

Nice easy recipe to make, but really bland overall even with cheese.  Will make again, but will use more salt and maybe throw some garlic powder into the dough.  This recipe is worth keeping though because of ease and quickness.  Just needs a little tweaking.

We LOVED these!  They fell apart in my mouth. They were just the right texture and just the right taste.  And so easy even a novice could make them.  I also added a tiny bit less milk because the batter seemed a little too loose.  Just a tiny bit less.  Like maybe 2 tablespoons.  It probably wouldn't have hurt to add it in.

I make this recipe often.  It's a quick solution to a meal that's not quite complete.  Try it with whole wheat: the flavor and texture are the same, and it adds some nutrition to an otherwise low-nutrition food.

These were great.  I needed something in a pinch to top off a chicken/casserole thing, and they were perfect~~light and fluffy.  I used oil instead of butter, as someone suggested. Easy and fast!

I made these last night They were great!. I made a first batch just to see what they turned out like, and since they were so easy and good I made two more batches to freeze!! I made all three batches without the cream of tartar, and my last batch was made with margine instead of butter and turned out kind of flat compared to the others,still tasted great. I would recommend using real butter. Great quick and easyrecipe thanks!

This was just what I was looking for!  Quick, easy and good too!  I made sure to wait to mix until right before I put it in the oven like someone else suggested.  I stirred in the butter first and then the milk. They came out perfect.  Everyone loved them.

Very easy and tasty.  They came out very light and fluffy, I was really happy with how they turned out.  I did mix honey with the melted butter to give the biscuits a little more sweetness.  I think this biscuit is going to become a regular in our house!

These are great!  I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour and  canola oil for half of the butter, and they still came out delicious and fluffy.

Really "E-Z" and very good! I added some garlic powder and dried basil to these and they were awsome for how easy they were. I did use a little extra baking powder and left out the cream of tartar (it's in the baking powder so it's not needed again). They puffed up pretty nicly and were light and flavorful.

This recipe is very easy and extremely delicious. The only thing I changed was I used 2 1/2 cups of spelt flour instead of all purpose flour. I will be using this recipe again and again.

SUCH an easy recipe, it's absolutely no fuss at all! Perfect for when there's suddenly no more bread. A tip: be careful not to use too much butter w/ sloppy eyeballing like I did my first try, it will make the biscuits much too heavy. After my lesson was learned, no problems whatsoever! Even when using b.soda in a pinch these taste great.

I doubled the recipe and didn't change anything. The biscuit texture was good, but it was a little bland. Next time I will add a little more sugar and more salt.

Awesome biscuits, tender and flaky just like biscuits should be.  I did it a little differently when it came time to bake.  I let the dough rest a bit then, instead of making individual drop biscuits, I took a large handful of dough and shaped it into a ball.  Then I put the balls fairly close together and pressed down with my palm to flatten so the edges touched each other.  Baked them that way and it took a little longer (about 5 minutes).  It was worth the extra time as the sides were just as tender and flaky as the interior. These were SOOOO tender and delicious!  They are definitely going in my permanent folder and I will be making them again and again.

I've made these biscuits twice now and they are easy and delicious. My sister has compared them to Knott's Berry Farm's biscuits.  If that means anything to you, then you know this recipe is good.

Perfect. The texture inside is moist and the exterior is a little crunchy on the edges.  I have tried many other biscuits that were not nearly this good.  I think the cup of milk is key.  Also it is important not to stir biscuits too much.  I definitely will be making these again and again.

Super quick and easy!  I actually overbaked these for a good 10 minutes while I was making the rest of breakfast and they STILL tasted great!  My toddler requested them in his lunch the next day.  What more can I say?  Great recipe!

These were great.  I was looking for a recipe for breakfast with peach jam.  I made these just the way the recipe stated.  It only took me minutes to prepare.  Perfect - with a light buttery flavor.   I will certainly make these again and will try the cheese for a dinner side-dish.  Thanks for sharing this.

These were great! I too left out the cream of tartar because so many advised to do so. I scooped them with my cookie scooper that has a handle squeeze to release the scoop -so fast! I would reduce the sugar if using them with a savory dinner.

I needed a quick biscuit for brunch to go with gravy and these turned out great. I left out the cream of tartar, but left everything else the same.  Will definitely keep this recipe for a quick breakfast.

I just made this recipe and something must be wrong with it. The dough was way too liquid and all baked together on the cookie sheet, and barely rose.  I double checked all the amounts, it must be 3 cups of flour instead of 2.  What a mess!

I love this recipe. It is so easy and quick to make. I have made these biscuits about 10 times already and they taste great everytime.I never use the cream of tartar that the recipe asks for and they still come out perfect. I even add alot of garlic powder and shredded cheddar to the mix to have some garlic cheddar biscuits.I have even made these biscuits just to snack on. I will never try any other recipe but this. Thanks!!!

I give 5 stars for a fabulous base recipe. I added parmesan cheese, basil, and oregano to the batter for extra taste which worked really well. I'd say about 1/2 Tbs of each. My batter was light and fluffy although they biscuits looked something more like cookies when they came out of the oven. This might have been the way I set the batter on the pan. Next time i'll make more effort to keep them rounder. Thanks for sharing.

These are pretty good!  For a quick, easy, drop biscuit, I was impressed.  They can be prepared in 2 minutes and no one at dinner knew the difference.  I did make 1-1/2 batches of dough, and used my Pampered Chef large scoop to put them onto the baking stone.  We ended up with 19 perfectly shaped biscuits.  I'll DEFINITELY make these again.....great with stew!

A simple, easy recipe that would have been great had I not gotten distracted and burned the bottoms. They had a good texture with no rising problems.  I used all whole wheat flour. Whole wheat flour may not be as stable as white flour, but I am health concious and used it anyway. Also, I did not add the cream of tarter as per the reviews. Next time I will keep a closer watch.

These biscuits are tender and tasty. As advised I left out the cream of tarter.  Also, I made these with freshly ground whole wheat pastry flour and used sucanat with honey instead of white sugar.  I will definitely be making these again.

Wonderfully tender, slightly sweet and simple biscuits.  I doubled the sugar since we like our biscuits a little sweeter and used whole wheat flour, but those were my only modifications.  We loved them.  Thanks so much for this recipe. It's a keeper!

These turned out just like my mom used to make....but even better....we have ours with syurp or apple butter on them.  Better than the Betty Crocker recipe.

Very good, easy no frills drop biscuit recipe that I am using to replace my current Betty Crocker recipe. I did not have cream of tartar, so I omitted it. I used country crock instead of butter, and didn't melt it first; instead, I simply cut the butter in with the flour until it had the consistency of coarse crumbs. Summary- don't avoid this recipe just because you don't have the cream of tartar, and you don't need to trouble yourself with melting the butter. :o) Thanks, Angela!

These were good. I used an unsalted stick of butter and added 1/2 tsp of salt, next time i will increase the salt a little more. Overall very good. I did have any issues with consitency etc. These were good and very easy to make. Thanks.

These were good.  I didn't melt the butter, though.  Instead, I mixed room temp butter into the flour mixture with a fork until it resembled little grains.  Then I stirred in the milk.  Gives it a better texture.
Also, these are *really* good if you mix in about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese -- just like the ones made at a famous seafood restaurant.  Yum!

This one is a keeper! Wonderful, light and fluffy. I made these with skim milk. I halved the recipe, scooped a heaping tablespoons of dough onto a covered sheet sprayed with cooking spray, popped them in the convection toaster oven, and about 9 minutes later had these delicious biscuits. It took all of maybe 2 minutes to whip together. Fabulous!

I REALLY DIDNT LIKE THESE, BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. I THINK I MIXED THE DOUGH TOO MUCH AND THEY CAME OUT KINDA CRUNCHY. I WILL TRY AGAIN AND SEE IF I HAVE BETTER RESULTS.

I like these because I dislike to roll out biscuit dough.  These are so much less time consuming.   Sometimes I mix in garlic, cheese, or spices before I drop them on the baking sheet.

Tried the recipe last week with cheese and my kids really enjoyed them!  I baked at 400° for 12 minutes as my parchment paper isn’t safe in the oven over 415° .  They were delicious. Moist and tender. This is a basic recipe that I think I can do a lot with - or not, depending on my mood!

I made them again  yesterday with a tablespoon more sugar, added frozen blueberries and sprinkled with powdered sugar before baking . Also substituted coconut oil for the butter.   They were moist  and delicious!

Like others, I left out the cream of tartar and they were great. We are gluten free and so I used Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free flour. These are lighter and crispy on the top. Will put into our breakfast / dinner rotation. Thanks!

Be careful to add the milk last, and slowly. I ended up using about 3/4 cup and the dough was a perfect consistency. Had I used the full one cup, I think I would have had biscuit soup.

These werent that good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they were a huge flop around here.  I'm better off using Biscuit for quick drop biscuits

I’m not normally a biscuit fan but these are super delicious. Made them for biscuits and gravy and they were a big hit. I also left out the tartar as per previous reviews.

I LOVE this recipe! It's my go to for biscuits. So fast, NO mess and very yummy biscuits. Great just as they are and amazingly good when you add shredded cheese & garlic. I've also successfully subbed oil for butter when I didn't have enough butter (butter is tastier tho). Very versatile. I'm positive they'd be great for strawberry shortcake too. Now you can have biscuits in a flash! Thank you for the recipe. Edit: I don't use cream of tartar, always had great results.

I make these biscuits all the time. I substitute Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour (the blue bag). I have also substituted applesauce for half the butter. Each way I have made them turns out great!

The flavor was there, and I loved the texture. I just wish they got taller, followed the recipe exactly and they were still flat. For a quick biscuit, it's definitely a good recipe though.

These are excellent "drop biscuits", I used 1 tablespoon brown sugar instead of white and chopped the butter into the dry minus the cream tarter before adding buttermilk. Nice, fluffy and moist with the bottom light brown crispy! Turned out great!!!

Use salted butter! Unsalted will leave them flavorless. Second batch:  soured the milk with white vinegar, omitted cream of tartar, increased salt to half teaspoon, turned out great!

Very good. I added one cup of grated cheese, omitted the cream of tartar as recommended by others, and also grated in the frozen butter to make them flaky, as someone suggested. I will make these again, thanks.

4 Stars because this is a very easy recipe for a biscuit base.  Missing one star because to our family it was a bit on the bland side if you follow the recipe exactly.  My tips - Using it for something sweet, like jam? Add an extra tablespoon of sugar and a bit more melted butter.  Using it for something savory, like soups? Add 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2+ cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Adjust liquid content accordingly to have a very moist but not runny dough.  You can even use buttermilk instead of regular milk, adds a mild tang to the biscuits.  Overall, however, a great biscuit base to use and then adjust according to your personal taste.

First time making a biscuit recipe with melted butter and I will never go back to grating cold butter again. I made the recipe exactly as written and thought the result was perfection. I will be replacing my old recipe with this one. I can’t wait to try it with garlic and cheese next.

I omitted the cream of tartar but that was the only change I made. They came out light and fluffy and simply delicious.

Great treat with butter and jam and a hot cup of coffee on this raining morning.

I suggest you try them. I don't think you will be disappointed

Very good, simple recipe. Due to other reviews, I made the suggested changes: leave out cream of tartar & added a little additional salt and sugar. They were great and think they would have been good even if I didn’t change salt and sugar.

This is an easy recipe that yielded the fluffiest, most delicious biscuits I’ve ever had. I served it with gravy, and my fiancé LOVED it. I too left out the tartar (because I didn’t have it on hand), and it was perfect without!

I have made these several times for my family and no matter how I adulterate them, they are always a favorite.  I've added cheddar, parmesan, dill seeds, garlic etc.  Awesome and super easy.

I am gluten free and have missed making and eating good, homemade drop biscuits for  almost 10 years! Instead of wheat flour, I substitute Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour. These biscuits are amazing, moist and so delicious!!! Not the regular dry texture of gluten free recipes. Now that I found a flour that will work, I am going to be baking so much more than just my well loved drop biscuits. @allrecipes is my go-to recipe needs.

They were good biscuits, soft and a little chewy. I’d make them again, but they are very flavourless.

I make these biscuits all the time! I use the original recipe for our biscuits and gravy, and they're delicious. When we have seafood I put some garlic powder, parsley, and cheddar cheese in the dough to make biscuits just like a certain restaurant whose biscuits are irresistible

With over 1100 ratings, I'm not sure mine really makes a difference, but these were delicious, tender, and SO quick and easy to make. I halved the recipe since there were just two of us and followed it to a tee. I wouldn't change a thing...

I made these without the cot, used fresh baking powder. I gently kneaded each ball of dough and patted it into a round, wanted them for egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, they were excellent, so tender and melt in your mouth!

This is just what I was looking for, perfect for tonight’s dinner.  I, like a lot of others, did not have the cream of tartar on hand and I don’t think that I missed it?  Will try another batch with it and see.  I did use the advise of others by spraying the utensils with Pam to avoid the dough from sticking thank you very much for that tip.  I used a cookie dough scoop and managed to get twenty two biscuits, will definitely make bigger biscuits next time.  Thank you so much for this recipe, can’t wait to experiment with other flavors such as garlic and basil.

These always come out perfect moist and fluffy. You can even easily change it up by adding garlic cheese and herbs or whatever you want to do.

Remove cream of tartar. These are my go to biscuits. I don't make anything else, but I throw in a handful of cheese and diced fermented jalapenos!  Then they're excellent!

They were really simple to make, had a very nice flavor but in order for them to have a nice golden brown top I would brush with butter before baking next time.

I omitted the cream  of tarter as suggested and found the texture to be great. I wish I used an egg wash for color even leaving it longer and a drizzle of butter on top didn’t get me the golden color I’d hoped for. I expected more flavor so next time I may add more salt, but overall pretty good and very quick.

Wow! These are delicious and so very easy.  I actually split the recipe and used most of the dough for the topping to a turkey pot pie recipe I found on this website.

I made just as it says and it was perfect.  For a change I added some cheese (Monterey Jack, Cheddar) or what ever you like. It  was great.  This recipe is so easy and versatile.

I’ve made these twice, and they came out even better the second time. I live in a super humid area. I ended up not using all of the milk/butter in the batter the second time.
These were very quick and easy to make. I highly recommend this recipe!

Mix seemed a little wet but I dropped them on the cookie sheet and they were good with butter and jam.  I will try honey later.  Very simple and quick.  I substituted a 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I will try adding cheese and garlic and herbs next time.

I made with out the cream of tartar. These were easy to make and very delicious. My hubby has currently transitioned to a soy free diet due to allergies. These are even better than the canned biscuits I used to make. They don't hold together well for a biscuit sandwich, but the taste makes up for it.

These biscuits are good, I followed one of the other commenters advice and left out a few ingredients, but I was surprised at how easy they were to make. They almost tasted like the biscuits that they serve at restaurants. for what few ingredients I used. I was impressed. I will probably make these again. Overall they are average biscuits, but I was impressed with the quality.

Wow! These biscuits turned out really light and the bottoms were crispy the way I like them. I followed the recipe except I didn't quite have enough flour and used a 1/4 cup of whole wheat and it still turned out great.

Good basic recipe. I used muffin tins, baked for the longer time and they came out nice and moist. I did skip the cream of tartar and extra salt.

Definitely good for a quick biscuit. I baked at 400 instead of 450 the baking time was 16 minutes and they were perfect. Didn't rise all pretty like a cut biscuit would, but otherwise, they have good flavor and worked out great for a quick breakfast of biscuits and gravy.

these really are easy to make.  my son helped me with them and they Were a huge hit in our home.   i dropped 2 tablespoons worth of batter into each well of a muffin tin,  which really helped with creating a round biscuit shape, and towards the end of baking time,  i brushed each one with melted butter and garlic powder for a twist that resulted in a great taste similar to some restaurants biscuits.  a new staple in our home.  thank you for the great recipe

WOW - so quick and easy :).  I used buttermilk powder instead of milk (4 Tbls powder to 1 cup water mixing the powder with the other dry ingredients), no cream of tarter, no sugar, increased salt to 1/2 tsp and brushed with butter immediately after they came out of the oven.  Moist, tender, and VERY tasty.  Will be using this recipe many times.

These were OK, Nothing to write home about but easy for sure. I made to the recipe except didn't have cream of tartar so trusted the reviews that said it wasn't needed. I will make again. Maybe add some cheese or seasonings next time.

HIGH ALTITUDE REVIEW: I made these this morning in Denver, just a little above 5000 ft, and I was not successful. I will sometimes try baking recipes with minor alterations first, which can work with some recipes,  but I think this one is going to need more altitude adjustments. The only changes I made were to remove the cream of tartar, since  many reviewers recommended this and often high-altitude baking does best with less leavening agents.  I also added a handful of shredded cheddar. These biscuits simply did not rise and were almost burnt at only 8 minutes.  They were quite buttery, but something about the flavor is just off.   If I make these again I'm going to have to make several more adjustments for the altitude.  There's a nice article on this website for high-altitude baking for those that are interested.

This was a super easy recipe compared to the traditional one. As did other reviewers, I left out the cream of tartar because I didn't have any. I substituted buttermilk for milk and added shredded old cheddar cheese and a pinch of Cayenne pepper for a savoury biscuit. Overall, I liked the result and would likely use the recipe again if in a rush and confident that the entire batch would be consumed in 2 days. Perhaps due to the changes I made in the recipe,  I found the biscuits somewhat dry after 48 hours.

love  these biscuits so easy and quick and good.    I omitted the cream of tartar and used unsalted butter increasing the salt by 1/8 teas.    Biscuits are tender with a little nice crunch on outside.   They were buttery tasting enough that I can eat them reheated without anything on them.  Reheat in microwave on low for one minute.

I loved these! I didn’t add cream of tartar because I don’t have any, but I thought they were perfect just the way they were. And they were super fast and easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

Quite easy to prepare, but very bland, which is the only reason for the rating.  Am not too familiar with biscuit making so not sure of the issue here.  My only guess is that I only buy unsalted butter, so could that be why?  As other reviewers mentioned, omitted the cream of tartar, which is the only change I made. Other reviewers added more sugar but I did not on the first try.  Could that be it?  When making a new recipe for the first time I always halve it, which made 8 nice-sized biscuits.  I also use a convection oven so the temp was reduced to 425 and they were baked 11 mins.  Everything was easy to prepare and I so wanted these to be mouth watering, but absolutely fell flat.  If anyone has any suggestions for a better tasting biscuit please advise.
Thank you!

So amazing! Moist light and fluffy. Just needed a bit more salt. Used 1/2 tsp. And I didn't have enough milk. So I used 3/4 c. Milk 1/4 c. Heavy cream. Mmmm.......

This easy recipe will be the one I use for biscuits from now on. They turn out moist and flaky and it’s a cinch to put together. There are none leftover once these hit the table.

The easiest, fluffiest best biscuits I've ever made. Hands down! I didn't add the tarter and and I added jalapeño jack and shredded cheese. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for a regular in my household :) thanks for sharing!

Followed directions exactly, easy to make, very light, and tasted delicious.   I used an ice cream scoop to make them uniform, but I think they would be even better a little bit bigger.  Probably going to kick it up a notch next time with cheese and maybe some jalapenos.  Toasted some leftovers biscuits the next day and they came out like (almost) I just made them.

Simple, easy, quick, and tasty. What more could you want?

I, like many others, simply omitted the cream of tartar (mainly because I didn't have any).
The result is a fluffy and delicious biscuit. Took less than 20 minutes start to finnish. 
Perfect for this college student.

Loved these! This is a great recipe for fast and easy biscuits. I served ours tonight with butter and honey to go with a dinner-breakfast. One note I would add is that it takes more than 1 TBSP of batter to divvie this up into 12 biscuits. It's more like 1 very heaping TBSP of batter per biscuit. Also, these need to bake for more like 14 minutes to develop a nice golden crunch on the outside to complement the  fluffy interior. Definitely a keeper!

I am usually hit or miss w/ recipes because I usually don't havre all the ingredients and have to substitute.  well, I did sub on this one, I used country crock unmelted butter instead of melted butter because I read reviews of other biscuits that said use cold butter/shortening so the biscuits are flaky (even tho these are drop biscuits).  I did use the cream of tartar and I even accidentally added too much.  I cut the recipe in half because the biscuits were just for me and I forgot by the time I got to the add the cream of tartar.  However, I couldn't tell the difference.  All I know is the biscuits came out awesome.  I cooked on tin foil on a baking sheet sprayed with no calorie spray for about 11 minutes. they were light and perfectly crisp on the outside.   Will definitely make these again!

Super simple and fast drop biscuit recipe! I wanted something a little sweeter than a regular biscuit, so I added 1/4 cup of honey. I also  omitted the cream of tartar as I didn't have any on hand and they turned out wonderfully. I was just going to make some Jiffy biscuits but my bag of mix had expired and I'm glad it did otherwise I wouldn't have found this recipe.

Great recipe.  Super fast and easy, too.  I did use almond milk (that's what I had), and I brushed the tops with melted butter before baking.  They were light and moist with a crispy outer shell - yum!  They were a bit bland - I may throw in a little extra salt next time, but there will definitely be a next time!

These are incredible and very easy! As other reviewers suggested I left out the cream of tarter, which is fine by me, and added in the milk/butter mixture slowly. I didn't use all the milk/butter mix as the consistency was perfect about 1/3 cups short and they turned out excellent! Made 6 large biscuits, perfect for breakfast sandwiches. Southern husband approved!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are amazing! They're both quite like regular cut out biscuits but they're not cakey either. These are a great treat! I use oil instead of melted butter because it's cheaper and they come out great! Great recipe!

The dough came out very runny, so I needed to add more flour. They turned out beautifully and equally tasty. I rarely make drop biscuits because they tend to be dry; these came out moist and fluffy.

Delicious! The original recipe is kind of bland, so I added a little extra salt. I divided the batter into three parts. The first part was plain; they tasted good. Not super amazing, but they satisfied the craving for biscuits. The second part was with raisins; these were very yummy. The third part was with garlic powder and parsley flakes; these were very tasty. I suggest baking them for 8 minutes (until small patches become golden). Do not wait for a lot of the outside to become golden because, by then, the insides are very dry. Oh - almost forgot to mention - I didn't have cream of tartar, and my biscuits turned out great without it.

I was looking for a quick, easy recipe for some last minute biscuits to go with our elk roast. These were a breeze to make and were the perfect addition to the roast.  They are crumbly and dry, but this makes them perfect for biscuits and gravy, soups and stews.

DO NOT USE CREAM OF TARTAR! The baking soda has an active acid that is enough for the biscuits to rise so you don't need cream of tartar and it'll make them taste bitter. I used 3 tsp of sugar to make them a little sweeter and I use 3/4 cup ap flour and 1/4 cup oat flour (to give it some texture and flavor)! I also used vegetable oil in  place of the butter since it's cheaper!! I made bigger ones so it took a little longer to cook but they came out great each time! Would highly recommend!!

These were super easy to put together and drop--gotta love drop biscuits for this! But I found the taste a bit bland. Maybe with some cheddar mixed in and/or herb butter? I'll try some variations the next time!

Never made homemade biscuits, but wanted some for my jam, so I am rating for the ease of making these and having all ingredients on hand, which was nice not needing buttermilk. These turned out great and fit my need. Will make again! Mine turned out delicately crispy on the outside and soft/moist on the inside and golden brown on the bottom (cooked at 450 for 11 minutes total [tried 8 and then 10 minutes, but needed 1 extra minute)

I made this recipe as per the instructions before I modified it. I found that  it tastes better without the cream of tarter. The batter is a bit too thin. I either use less milk, or more flour. Also, 450, at least on my oven, is a bit too hot, leaving the center of the biscuits just a tad under done. I like the results at 400 better. It's best to let them rest 5-10 minutes before serving.  
Enough nitpicking. These biscuits are a favorite. I make them about once a week. This is an easy, quick way to produce tasty biscuits that are perfect for gravy. They taste just as good as regular baking powder biscuits with a fraction of the hassle.

3 times in 24 hours! Amazingly quick and easy! I didn't use cream of tartar as I didn't have any, so I added 2 tbs of yoghurt. They came out cruchy on the outside, moist in the inside. I added shredded cheese,red pepper, fresh oregano and thyme and they disappared in no time! Thank you for the great recipe.

A big hit with my whole family! I added some garlic powder and Italian seasonings. Not sure why, but they didn't puff up at all, so they came out a little dense. But still tasty!

If you don't feel like making roll out biscuits and need something faster, these come out every time.  Recipe even works with einkorn flour.  Goto this recipe over and over.

These came out really good for my first time making biscuits. I wanted a quick and easy recipe to go with jambalaya I'd made and I wanted to make cornbread but I didn't have cornmeal so I wanted to find a quick Biscuit recipe. And since I couldn't find my rolling pin, I knew I could make this. The recipe made more than I thought but they came out perfectly golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft and warm in the middle. And best of all my fiancé loved them so I know they're a hit. I will definitely make these again!!

Amazing biscuits! I had everything in my pantry and fridge to make them. I opted out of adding cream of tarter and added about 1/4 cup of water so they could spread easily over my gravy mix. I will never buy canned biscuits or mixes ever again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and after it was  mixed  it looked more like a thick batter. I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour.  I baked as directed and was well pleased with the biscuit. I will use this recipe again adding the extra flour.

I followed this recipe to a T.   No changes needed.  These biscuits were delicious.  Crispy outside, moist and light on the inside!  I will be making these again and again for sure!  And to think, I thought these weren't going to be as good as Bisquick.   Boy, was I wrong!!!

We loved these.  I am not a baker and these were super easy.  I added some grated parmesan to the mixture.  Excellent with chicken chili and will be even better with a stew.  Might try adding some herbs next time as well.

I make these ALL of the time.  It's the only recipe I use.  They are very good and EASY!  I've used buttermilk, 2% and whole milk.  The taste is still good with all of the different milks.  The only adjustment I make is to use 7/8 cup of liquid so that the biscuits are a little firmer.  Every time I make them I am told how good they taste.

Love, love, LOVE these biscuits!! I only had self-rising flour on hand so I used it and omitted the baking powder and cream of tarter. Kept everything the same and used unsalted real butter. Added a cup of shredded cheddar and they were delish!! This is now my 'go-to' biscuit recipe!!

Turns out great! I've made this numerous times. Only consistent changes - don't use cream of tartar, and use veg oil instead of butter. I customize the recipe in many different ways - cinnamon + sugar, cheese, add dried fruit, etc. and it always turns out yummy. I make these for breakfast all the time because they are so quick to put together and mix up all in one bowl - no giant kitchen mess, yay!

I thought these turned out excellent not changing anything. I give 4 stars only because they were a little bit bland, but it would be easy to tweak to how you want: Cheddar cheese, herbs, sweet, etc. I'll make these again for sure!

I've made this with white flour, whole wheat flour and Red Mill's 1 to 1 gluten free baking powder. They are all delicious! With butter and earth balance.

I loved the taste of these biscuits.  My only issue is that they turned out more like biscuit cookies.  I think next time I will not add all of the butter and milk.  They are amazing with a dollop of raspberry jam!!!!  I loved they with my sausage gravy too.

These biscuits were okay, but I would omit the cream of tartar and substitute 1/4 tsp baking soda.   I would also not melt the butter.   perhaps it was my oven, but I found the heat of 450 too high.   I think 425 would work better.

Best biscuits I ever made in that short of time. Prep was under 5 mins. I added a little cheddar cheese like some of the other reviewers. Recipe is exactly what I was looking for! My daughter devoured them!

Wonderful and simple! Didn't have cream of tartar, so subbed with 1tsp fresh lemon juice. Turned out perfect! The second time I made them, I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar - great addition!

I basically used what I had on hand and they came out great! I substituted coconut oil for the melted butter, used half buttermilk and half  2% evaporated milk, substituted Splenda Blend for the sugar and eliminated the cream of tarter and they came out great!  Will definitely makes these again!

My family LOVES these plain, with jelly, or with sausage gravy (see Pioneer Woman). Most times I jazz up this recipe by adding 1/2 tsp each of dried dill and dried rosemary to the melted butter before mixing. Oh and I also double the salt to 1/2 tsp. Eight thumbs up!

These are fantastic!  I too left out the cream of tarter....next time am going to try buttermilk in them; and the next time will try cheese!  Leftovers were as tender as when they came out of the oven.

My 6 year old son and I just made these for lunch I would love to show you a picture but the kids devoured them. A little honey and butter and they were gone in minutes.  I did not have cream of tarter but it obviously was not missed.

Excellent base recipe for drop biscuits or dumplings. I left out the cream of tartar because I didn't have any. Infinity customizable. Worked great with bean soup last night and under runny eggs this morning. I will use this recipe over and over, sweetened up for desserts or made savory with herbs and cheese.

They turned out great but the next time I make them I will leave out the cream of tartar. They were so easy to make and would have been perfect except for the cream of tartar. I'll definitely make them again.

I've made these several times and they always turn out great.  I also use the dough recipe for my chicken and dumpling and it works perfectly.  The only change I have ever made was swapping out buttermilk for half of the milk portion and both ways are great.  Thank you for such an easy and reliable recipe.

I have made these a dozen times. Turn out every time. Love that I can just melt the butter instead of having to knead it in, so much faster and easier.

I made these with half wheat and half white flour so that they'd be a little more hearty. They're small, but I have a two-year-old, so they ended up being just the right size for her. Liked the little bit of bite from the cream of tartar but might try them without next time. Go well with and can stand up to a sausage gravy.

My mom loves biscuits and I don't like buying the mix from the supermarket. I follow the advice from other reviewers about not adding the cream of tart, so i didn't add it and I make some changes myself to make it  more flavorful. I added 1 tbsp. of garlic  powder, 1 tbsp. of dried basil and 1 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella. They came out perfect... I will definitely make this again...

I would love to roll out some  southern biscuits, just cause. But, I have four kids and needed something simpler. This is easy and delicious. Add a little garlic powder and some shredded cheddar to this recipe , and it's a dinner biscuit. Seriously delicious.

Much too salty. I would reduce cream of tartar and well as salt. Great fluffy texture. I will try making them again.

My mother used to make drop biscuits every Saturday morning and I loved them. I now live out of state and she doesn't do very much cooking anymore since all of us kids are grown and moved away. I was wanting to make some drop biscuits go to with supper tonight. So I tried this recipe and only made a few tweaks. First, I remember my mom putting Mayo in her drop biscuits so I put one dollop of reduced fat mayo in. Second, I didn't have any cream of tarter so I left it out. Third, added a bit more flour to compensate for the cup of milk which was too much (Next time I'll add 1/2 cup milk). Last, I am making them to go with our dinner so I added some garlic powder and a handful of grated sharp cheddar cheese. This is a pretty solid recipe! I will continue making these! ( I baked one biscuit without the garlic and cheese and they are good too!)

I added some shredded cheese to the mix before adding the butter and milk. It definitely helped the taste.  I left out the cream of tartar, having read other comments that it gave it a bitter aftertaste. The texture didn't come out right. I think the problem is that adding molten butter activates the baking powder too early, I will cut the butter in cold next time and see what happens.

I have to give this 4 stars for ease, forgiving nature, and really light crumb. I'm used to the more finicky biscuit dough recipe of cutting in the fat so I decided to do that per my usual SOP instead of melting. I had also forgotten to stir the dry ingredients together before adding the liquids and it still turned out pretty well. Based on other reviews I didn't add the cream of tartar. They came out less 'craggly' than most drop biscuit recipes, looking more like scones with smoother rounded tops. Didn't affect the texture at all though these also do brown way less than usual drop biscuit recipes. All in all, it doesn't have as much flavor as other drop biscuits I've tried but they were pleasingly tender, easy and fast (which was exactly what I needed for a weekday carb to accompany leftover chili). Definitely will keep in rotation for an emergency side carb.

These are good for a quick buscuit. I excluded cream of tartar, and added garlic powder, Italian herbs, and sharp cheddar cheese. Cool for 2 min on baking sheet before removing if you use cheese, otherwise they stick.

I changed the cream of tartar to baking soda, and also added 1 tbsp white vinegar before topping off the cup of milk to sour it.  Very tasty!

Very easy to make and super delicious! I omitted the cream of tartar and these still came out perfect. These biscuits were tasty and moist (some biscuits recipes come out too dry for my liking) and I will definitely be making these again.

Copied recipe-minus the tarter (since I didn't have any hand). I also doubled it to make 24, I ended up with 36...that's okay! The 1st batch I put on a cookie sheet, turned out good, but a little flat for a biscuit. The 2nd batch I put in cupcake pans & they also turned out good, with more of a biscuit shape. Either ways is good! This is a keeper :) Like it says, EZ to make!! Next time I'm mixing in jalapenos for a kick.

Love this recipe.  Super easy and fast for biscuits and gravy.  My family loves then and we like to mix them up with adding a handful of cheddar cheese or adding cinnamon for a yummy breakfast side.  I didn't have cream of tartar so have never used it and they turned out great!

quick and easy. I exclude the tartar and like to add a bit more butter and either sugar or salt depending on the batch. always taste before you put it in the oven so you can add what you need or want. 
be careful about having too much moisture cause this will cause them to be dense.
Edit:
this has become my go to side dish. It is a really great base to play with and manipulate. I just tried it with slightly sour half and half instead of milk (not good for drinking coffee with but not so sour it would make you sick) and the added fat made it really great.

I wish I had read more than 1 review before I made them. I did add an extra tsp of sugar. They come out pretty flat. I sifted the flour (doesn't say to but thought I should). The flavor was great. Next time I might add a few other ingredients just to change it up a bit and might try it without the tartar too. It's very easy and  I love not having to flour my counter and making a mess making these.

I used this recipe as a regular drop biscuit, and they came out scrumptious. Then I used the recipe again subtracting one quarter of a cup of milk and using them as a dumpling in my crock pot. It was fabulous! Versatile and delicious.

Leave out the cream of tartar and these are PERFECT!  I've made them at least 10 times and for a variety of people and everyone loves them.  They are easy and fast and taste fantastic.  In fact, I have a batch due out of the oven in 3 minutes, yay!

Added shredded cheese. Followed directions. Very wet dough. Pre-cooled cookie sheets to prevent burnt bottoms, but bottoms still burned while tops were doughy. Heavy to eat. Tasty, filling. Would probably adjust to lower temperature with longer cook time.

Delicious. Possibly the best drop biscuits I've ever made. I think next time, I might use 3/4 the cream of tartar because they are a little tart, but that zing makes them special.

I will have a hard time not eating the leftovers as a midnight snack. My husband doesn't actually need any, right?

I wanted to have some drop biscuits with my lentil soup for lunch so I quickly found this recipe. They turned out awesome and took no time at all to make!! I didn't have any cream of tartar on hand so I looked up a substitute for it- it's necessary for the acidity with the baking soda so instead I used 6 tsp. of lemon juice to measure to the 1 Tbsp. of baking soda. I also added a little bit more salt (we use Himalayan pink salt) 
These would be really good with cheese in them. I will be doing that next time!

Great for biscuits and gravy. Have been using this recipe for years, and everyone loves them. My only advice is to avoid using foil or grease since the bottoms will burn (for those of you out there who are in love with Pam) and to make sure you're using Rumsford baking powder, or really any other brand that doesn't have aluminum in them, but that's the only one I'm aware of. The aluminum gives them a weird taste that you may not even know you're getting because you're just so used to it!

. Came out great even with a big mess up. Since it was my first time I decided to make half the amount I put in my last ingredient the milk, well it was a liquid mess cause I forgot to half the milk so I rushed about and added more  flour baking powder etc. but did not have time to melt frozen butter so  I used flavored olive oil.  Tastes great very flavorful and proberly  healthier.  This is it not only easy but very very forgiving.

I made these just as recommended and they came out perfect. I added a little bit of pepper because I like pepper. Make these just as told and they come out awesome.  Soft, fluffy, pillowy nd taste just like they came from a fancy bakery.  This will be a keeper in my kitchen.

SO SO good! They're not going to be pretty, but they taste so good and are so quick to make.  I did omit the cream of tartar because of some of the reviews, but I did not change one other thing! I added some shredded cheddar cheese to some of them and served with sausage gravy. I love the taste of homemade biscuits, but I hate how long they take to cut out and the mess that goes along with them. This recipe only takes a few minutes to prep and 8 min in the oven! I get around 12 biscuits.

I was searching for a quick and easy biscuit recipe as tomorrow is my shopping day and today is a cold and rainy day here in Northern Pa.  Found this one and let me tell ya, instead of the extra 1/4 cup of milk I just simply used 1 full cup of milk.  They rose and taste great!!  Made these for soup night at my home tonight.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone!  Thanks a bunch!!

Love these, but with a little tweaking, which is why I gave four stars instead of five.  As suggested, grate very cold butter into dry ingredients and toss in before adding milk, and skip the cream of tarter. Also, double the salt.  For a variation, use a little less butter (about 5-6 tablespoons) and add a handful of grated cheese (Cheddar, Parm, Asiago, whatever) ... sprinkle a bit on top, too. I have even made this with half whole wheat (add a third more baking powder) and they were delicious and light. A good basic, quick recipe that's easy to jazz up but wonderful plain.

I did leave out the cream of tartar as others suggested and poured the melted butter into the milk and then added a little at a time. I used quantities listed and the batter was soupy (like another reviewer stated), so I sifted in another 1/4 cup of flour and it was perfect!  (read reason below)

I think the recipe all depends on how packed your flour is before measuring. I dump my extra sifted flour back in the container so it was not as compact as a new bag, thus throwing off the consistency.

Really good!  I did make one change though.  I didn't have cream of tartar so I used sour cream in it's place.  These were tender and flaky.  Good with honey, preserves, gravy or with butter...or they are delicious on their own!  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks Angela for the great recipe!

Great recipe! Definitely a good idea to add the milk in little by little. I actually used an eighth cup less milk then stated, because I could tell they would have been just a little bit too watery otherwise. I also only had unsalted butter on hand, but I compensated by adding twice as much salt then recipe called for.

We use this recipe a lot.  If using it to go with pasta, we add a little garlic.  If we use it for chicken and dumplings, we add 1tsp parsley to the recipe.

You can cut the butter a bit and still end up with a good biscuit. Try adding stuff to the center (like leftover seasoned meat) for a more Eastern European flair.  Didn't use cream of tartar.

Didn't have enough butter, so used shortening instead.   Granny used to make them without butter, so I figured it would be okay.   The texture of these were awesome, but they were pretty bland.   Maybe the butter would've fixed that.

Easy and tasty.  Mine got really fluffy.  I will definitely make these again. (I did leave out the cream of tartar since the reviews were mixed about whether they need it and I don't keep it in stock)

Impression: These were very good. The dough was pretty wet, but the biscuits still turned out very well. They were also very buttery. (I might tone down the butter just a bit next time - see recommendations.)

Changes: 
I reduced the amount of Cream of Tartar to 1/4 tsp. 
I used skim milk and mixed the butter and milk together before I added it to the dry ingredients. I had to cook them a little longer (about 15 mins). 
I didn't use quite as much sugar as the recipe calls for. I reduced it by a very small amount (maybe by 1/2 tsp.).

Servings: This made 15 large biscuits for me. 

Uses: I added blueberries and sprinkled some sugar and topped with creme fraische for dessert one night. The next morning, I used for breakfast sandwiches. The following evening, we served them with dinner. We are only 2 people, so 15 biscuits goes a long way with us! Great recipe. Next time, I might see if I can make 1/2 of it.

Recommendations: The only things that could have made these biscuits a little better was that they were just a little pale. Not sure how I might brown them up. 
Maybe I might brush the tops with butter next time. 
I think I might reduce the butter by 2 Tb. next time, or move them to the top rack. (I used the middle to prevent burning.)

Final word: If I'd used all of the Cream of Tartar, they might have turned out even more tender, but as it is, they're very, very good. I'll be making them again!

I made with self rising flour... all i had. After 8 minutes brushed the tops with melted butter. Rebrushed when they were done. DELISH!

I can't believe I made these.  I can't make biscuits.  They were wonderful, crispy on outside, soft in middle. Going to make more.  Thanks for the recipe

Made these for strawberry shortcake. They spread out a ton, were very dense, and looked nothing like the picture. I'm no novice to baking, so I don't know what went wrong. We liked the taste (I added a touch of vanilla), so they worked for shortcakes, but I'll probably try softening rather than melting the butter next time.

I love this recipe. I have made it many times for biscuits. I usually skip the cream of tartar. This time I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup, added vanilla, a few drops of almond extract, and diced 2 fresh peaches. they were wonderful. This is a perfect base recipe to alter a little to fit the needs of the day. Thank you very much.

Easy to make and adjusts to specific portion beautifully.  The PERFECT biscuit for sausage gravy.
I have even used 1/2 melted butter and 1/2 frozen stick butter grated.  This makes a great pockets of heaven.
If you add sheaded cheese - freeze it first, it will hold up better & do NOT use Fine Shredded, it just disapears.

These are GREAT! I've made biscuits from scratch and they never seem to come out right, but these are awesome. I did leave out the cream of tartar as recommended by the other reviewers.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white and honey instead of sugar. The only tip I'd recommend with using honey is to add it first to the cup within which the milk will be measured so that the total amount of liquid is 1.5 cups (butter, milk, honey). The batter was a bit too wet when I added the 2 tsp of honey to the wet ingredients by itself and thus didn't stick together as well.  It was still delicious and I plan to make it regularly!

I made recipe exactly as written.  They were beautiful.  Best part, tender on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside.....PERFECT for hubby and me.  Didn't notice any "bitter" taste as all.  Of course, I had them covered with a lovely white sausage gravy...just like gramma and momma used to make. We did taste them "pre-gravy" and again,no bitterness.  Oh, I melted the butter and then warmed the milk slightly and mixed those two and then added to dry ingredients. Best part, we were eating breakfast within 30 minutes, start to finish. Next time, I might try "buttermilk" instead of plain milk, just to check it out.   I make all kinds of biscuits, but this will be my "go to" for ease and of course tastiness.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made these to go with sausage gravy & they were good. To eat as is, I personally would have made them a little bit sweeter. But the ease was great, tasted much better than canned biscuits. Thank you for posting

I have made these several times. The butter gives it a nice buttery flavor as well as a light texture.  Very simple and my now go to recipe.   I did not want to have to cut butter into the mixture and did not want to use oil. Works for me! Will next try adding cheese.

I made a couple batches for a friend's party, and many people loved them! Like some other commenters suggested, I left out the cream of tartar. I also added shredded cheese, and each batch had either leftover squeezed-and-chopped spinach or leftover bacon chopped fine. Both turned out fantastic!

Great versatile recipe!  I followed the ingredients exactly for the base but added some Italian herbs and minced garlic so they would compliment our meal.  I could easily use this recipe for sweet or savory biscuits.

I wanted to make a drop biscuit to top a turkey stew to pop in the oven. I didn't have baking powder so had to make my own with a 2:1 ratio of cream of tartar to baking soda.  Worked perfectly and therefore, I didn't bother adding the extra tartar.  This made a perfect topping to my savory stew.  Light and fluffy.  Good flavor.  thanks for the easy recipe; surely enjoyed.

Yet another recipe that is nothing like my mom's but tastes just like hers!  These are easy and I LOVE that they use butter instead of shortening or (shudder) margarine.  Perfect for a night when I need a bread dish quickly.  Would be great with a little herb or cheese addition.

Easy and pleasing recipe!  I wanted an easy go to that didn't involve rolling the dough. I didn't have nor miss the cream of tarter. The biscuits came out a light brown, with a soft and smooth texture and slightly sweet flavor. i have picky eaters in my family and they raved about them.  Perfection!

These were very good and very easy to make. I didn't use cream of tartar because I didn't have any and I left out the sugar. The only problem was that it was hard to stop eating them!

Excellent recipe!! I used shredded marble in the biscuits. Also I added a glaze after it came out of the oven; about 1/8 - 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp salt and pepper,  1/2 tsp garlic,  and 1/4 tsp oregano. Mix together and bush over the biscuits, I sprinkled some extra cheese over top. Any extra butter mixture I had left over I used as a spread.  It was delicious! !

Very quick and tasty.  It held together well and its texture was more like a pancake and less crumbly than many biscuits.  (That is just what I wanted, though!)

I made these just as the recipe stated with the exception of omitting the cream of tartar.  I'm rating these 4 stars because they are exactly as stated:  quick and easy.  I made these in just minutes and they cooked up nice and fluffy on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside.  The flavor is on the bland side, but it wasn't a big problem for me because I enjoyed them greatly with some butter and jam. I will definitely be making these again and probably adjusting the ingredients slightly for more flavor.

I loved this recipe, the results were amazing. I make these as a breakfast staple two times per week. With the rising cost of bread it's a real money saver.

Perfect little drop biscuits and such an easy recipe. I made them exactly as written. I used my big cookie scoop instead of a tablespoon and the biscuits were just the right size and done in 10 minutes.

This recipe is simple AND tasty alol by itself.  Add a few other things and it's just scrumptious!  My biscuits turned out crispy outside, and light, moist, and fluffy inside.
  To make them perfect for my family's tastes, I cut in 2-3 tbsp unsalted butter before adding the melted, unsalted butter and milk, as well as two dashes cayenne pepper, some garlic powder, a little onion powder, a shake or two of garlic salt, a scotch parsley and a 1/2 tsp oregano or there abouts.  I also stirred in a cup of shredded mexican blend cheese (from Aldi's).  Drop biscuits are my favorite no-fuss biscuit.  We use leftovers for biscuits and gravy or Jammie Dodgers.  (Biscuit and jam).

Super easy and delicious!  Won't buy the refrigerated ones anymore! Skipped the cream of tartar as I didn't have any on hand and they turned out great.  My only comment is that for 12 biscuits it was a lot more than a tablespoon....more like a quarter cup (give or take).

Worked great! I added cheese and no cream of tartar.  Ended up with only one cup of milk and mixed milk and butter first.  Made smaller biscuits, ended up with 18 small biscuits. Poured peppered gravy over them and served with chicken fried steak! Was a hit and super easy!!

This was such an easy recipe. I used others suggestions and omitted the cream of tarter. Since we were wanting something sweet, I added brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. My 5-year old loved these with honey. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I omitted the Cream of Tartar, added a handful of cheese and topped with garlic salt and melted butter. These came out really heavy and dense and almost flour tasting. I was pretty disappointed. I didn't have the issues of it being too wet like others did. The dough mixed right up and I did not over mix. Just a very heavy recipe. I probably won't be making this again because even with my additional mix in of cheese and topping it off it was still very plain and bland. I gave it two stars because it WAS quick and easy.

I know how to bake cakes, cookies, etc.  But, my first time making biscuits from scratch.  Came out awesome.  Soooo light and fluffy.  I used 1/4tsp. of kosher salt instead.  Next time I'll add a pinch more salt.  And 1/4 tsp. more sugar and some cheddar cheese.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Will be making again.

They came out great. 
Soft and sweet.
I did not add the cream of tartar, 
I softened the butter and cut it up into small slices and added it to the dry ingredients.
Instead of milk, I used sweet cream
will make more.

Did not add the cream of tartar based in the other reviews. Added crumbled Colby jack cheese for some saltiness but did not do a whole lot. Texture is nice, taste is good but simple. Ultimately I put cream cheese and blackberry jam inside and that was a big hit with my husband and daughter. Fast and easy!

I've made these twice. First exactly as written, the second time I shredded frozen butter into the flour mixture vs melting it, and added garlic and black pepper. They tend to get crispy bottoms (could be my oven) but are tasty and filling.

PS - both times I left out the cream of tartar. You don't need it if you're using baking powder.

Feeling a little home sick in the North Pole of Germany, I found this recipe and gave it a shot. GREAT recipe - these are all things I have on hand almost all the time, so that was a huge plus right there! That being said - I couldn't find my Cream of Tartar so left it out since it called for Baking Powder. The biscuits did come out a little flatter than I thought they would but - since I didn't follow it to a "T" I can't fault the recipe in any way. I think next time I'll add just a little more salt - but that's just me. The texture of this biscuit is great and holds up well with everything I threw at it... eggs - scrambled & fried, marmalades, butter & honey... I'm a happy girl!

I tried this recipe today because I needed something fast and easy to go with some homemade peach-pineapple preserves. I give this recipe 5 stars. I left out the Cream of Tartar and added an extra pinch of salt. I made 9 large biscuits instead of 12. They were light and fluffy with a little bit of delicious crispness on top. The key is definitely to use a light hand and incorporate ingredients but do not overmix. They do not hold together like a rolled and cut-out biscuit so have a fork handy, but it takes nothing away from the flavor. This will be a quick standby biscuit recipe for me. I love these easy drop biscuits. I might try the recipe with buttermilk just to compare. It would also be delicious to add dill weed and cheddar for a savory bite.

Love them! Moist and light!! I used butter instead of shortening and needed in oregano. i also spread garlic butter on top before I baked them and sprinkled parmesean cheese on afterwards! I didnt haven any garlic bread on hand for my pasta so I used these guys as a replacement!  They were actually a hit with my family!!

I left out from of tartar and Cooked biscuits within 15 minutes of adding liquids to dry ingredients as suggested in other comment.   My oven doesn't handle 450º very well, So I baked mine at 400º for 12 minutes.  I also glazed top of each biscuit with butter before baking.

I agree with comments about the wonderful texture of these biscuits.  I added 1/2 c. grated sharp cheddar and 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped chives...omitted the sugar.  Heaping tablespoons yielded 16 small biscuits - perfect for sharing with a crowd at a meeting - providing a savory option.  10 minutes gave them nice brown peaks.

We loved these. In particular with sausage  and gravy. As suggested previously eaten alone are a little bland, but could easily be amped up with spices and herbs. Maybe even cheese... definitely a keeper. Thanks again!

I made these originally to use as dumplings for chicken and dumplings. I accidentally used baking soda instead of powder, and I left out the tartar sauce. They were pretty tasty but didn't stay together so it seemed more like stuffing. I had more than I could fit in my crockpot so I made three biscuits in the oven and they were good but seemed to be lacking salt.
I made these again today - added 1 cup of cheddar cheese, left out the tartar sauce again, and added a tiny bit extra salt. They still needed more salt. I would at least double the salt, possibly even up it all the way to a full teaspoon of salt.

This recipe was just what I was looking for! I baked them at 425 for 10 minutes and they came out perfect! I skipped the cream of tarter, but followed all other directions. If you are looking for a quick, easy, biscuit recipe, then you have found the right one. Thanks for sharing :-)

Easy & quick! I don't use cream of tartar. I usually decrease the butter a little because I prefer a less buttery taste. Also, I make my biscuits bigger than the recipe calls for so I've found that baking them at 425 for a couple extra minutes ensures the insides are fully cooked, while still making the outsides golden brown and crisp.

I love this recipe and use it every time I make biscuits! Someone said something about the cream of tartar and baking soda having similar properties, well this recipe calls for baking POWDER not soda. I think the recipe is great as-is. :)

I skipped the cream of tartar cause I never have any and added approx. a tsp of salt. This turned out to be a lovely, light biscuit that was just perfect for a dab of jam.

These were so easy!  I left tartar out but did everything else the same.  I did not drop the biscuits on the sheet but hand shaped them just because I like that look.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.

Best drop biscuit I've ever made from scratch!  Only change I made was omitting the cream of tartar - simply because I did not have any on hand.
Thanks for a great recipe, will be making these again!

Tasted great and creamy.  I used them in my chicken and dumplings, so they steamed pretty well.  Very quick. I , too, do not think the cream of tartar is a must for these great biscuits.

This is the easiest receipe ever. You can add cheese, herbs, anything your heart desires. I made two dozen for my church. One batch with mozzarella cheese and Italian herbs with diced garlic to go with my Italian sausage soup.  And the other batch with cheddar cheese, herbs, garlic. What I forgot to put was garlic powder which really gives that garlic taste. I also omitted the tarter, which is fine I never use it. I was asked by so many for the recipe. It was a big success, which I knew it would be cause I make them at home and add different ingredients all the time. What a great way to make real homemade biscuits. Yummy thank you ALL RECIPES, you make me look like such a pro when it comes to cooking. Just call me Chief CiCi

These are very good. I followed the recipe exactly. I was looking for a recipe where I didn't have to make dough with shortening or butter. This is about as EZ as it gets. I had shredded cheddar cheese right next to my bowl and forgot to add it..:-( Oh well there's always next time. Topped with butter when they came out...YUM!

Seriously ez drop biscuits! Taste great and can have them on the table with dinner quick. I usually add a couple handfuls of cheese to the batter and omit the cream of tartar as it's not a staple in my spice cupboard. Make sure you don't mix too much or you may end up with tough biscuits definitely a keeper!!

Turned out good. I added a cup of cheese. I cooked on a light color sheet for 12 minutes at 450 and came out pretty white. I liked them better cooked another 2 minutes to get that golden color.

This is my go-to biscuit recipe for weekend biscuits & gravy. I don't bother with making single biscuits though. I save some time by using my mom's trick & slap it all on a baking stone, spread it out, bake, then slice.

Love these biscuits! Using this recipe I can have biscuits, gravy and scrambled eggs on the table in 15 minutes on a weekend morning. For a little more savory, I add granulated garlic and onion. Usually omit the cream of tarter, don't notice any difference without it.

These really are super easy. I must say that I never add Cream of Tartar - I just never have it. That said, I have made these biscuits multiple times, and they always come out. EVERYONE loves them. Sometimes I will add 1 cup of shredded cheese before adding in milk, just to give them a more savory flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  I used white whole wheat flour in this recipe.  I also used only half the cream of tartar the original recipe called for due to the previous reviews concerning omitting it completely.  They were very flavorful and light.  After melting my butter in a saucepan, I added it to the cold milk and stirred it up.  The butter had gotten cold and hardened some.  I say this because one other post suggested freezing the butter and grating it into the mixture.  Definitely will add this to our menu lineup!

Perfect and sooooo easy. I didn't have cream of tarter so I omitted it and they still came out perfect. I also added a little garlic powder for extra flavor, but I don't think it was necessary.

I made this with 1 cup flour and 1 cup oatmeal ... it was perfect .. you will not regret it. 
Just be careful when adding the milk because it you will not need to use the whole cup .. I used only half. I also used vanilla Instead of the cream of tartar.

It was super fast and fairly fluffy, but a lil plain. Add in some flavor and they will be great!

Great easy recipe! Awesome for biscuits and sausage gravy or add a little garlic & butter and shredded cheese to the tops and they're great dinner biscuits!

These are great biscuits and oh so easy. I made them with soured milk and added more salt- I used unsalted butter and they could have used about 3/4 of a teaspoon.

I usually don't like made from scratch biscuits. I tried these but changed the sugar to 1 teaspoon and used unsalted butter and they were delicious. Both my husband and I loved them. They were crispy, tasty and fast. Perfect.

In regard to people with the flat biscuits- Too much milk- you are supposed to add it until "just combined"-- For me, it came to 1/2 cup of milk, not a cup- varies slightly each time, honestly.

Per other reviews, I left out the cream of tartar.  I couldn't see using 1/2 cup butter, so I did 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup Chobani plain greek yogurt.  I added some herbs and a bit of grated sharp cheddar.  Wonderful biscuits.  Mine made 14 large biscuits and done in 11 minutes.

I love this recipe because it is quick and easy, and since I spend a lot of time making the rest of the meal, this is what I need. I added rosemary to the batter to give it a kick and since rosemary is so good for you.

I grated cold butter into the flour mixture and then added the milk. Oh, and no cream of tarter. Other than that, I made it as written. These are the best biscuits, for real. I don't know why people said they were bland and dry. Mine were the opposite!! Super moist and fluffy and buttery. I will be making these from now on.

EDIT: I've made these so many times now. I find that melting the butter like the recipe says produces the best results. I can make these from start to finish in about 20 min. Also, adding cheese makes them amazing!!

I don't know what I did wrong.  As far as I know I followed the recipe exactly, but I could tell immediately that there was way too much liquid.  They turned into pancakes rather than biscuits.

These were amazing out of the oven, but after an hour or so they seemed a bit dry, without butter, but they were fairly greasy because if the cheese, strange combo.  I will make again though, and just make sure I serve them fresh!

Simple, easy and tender. Careful not to over bake. I prefer using the convection setting on my oven and begin checking after 7 minutes.  Normally with a 10 minute total baking time. Remember to whisk dry ingredients first before adding liquids. Add some sharp cheddar and green onions to mix. Wonderful as a base for deconstructed chicken and dumplings or to drop in broth for traditional style. YUMM

By far the best basic drop biscuit recipe I have ever tried. I made it exactly as said this morning and it turned out wonderfully light and fluffy. I was a little concerned that as I was adding the milk that it would be a little too liquidy, but it firmed up just perfect. I cant wait to try with a few other fresh ingredients such as garlic, cheese, parsley or even cilantro. I only came up with nine biscuits as I made them a bit larger than recommended, 12 minutes was perfect timing in my oven. Thank you for the recipe. I taped it on the inside of my cabinet as I plan to use this over and over again.

Followed this to a "T", but left out the cream of tartar. Turned out fine except I think I'd add a touch more salt, maybe. Biscuits were golden brown with crispy edges, and top was light in color with no browning to them. Texture was crunchy due to the edges and bottom, but inside of biscuit was moist and light.

I took pancakeone's advice and left out cream of tartar since I don't ever buy it.

This was a fantastic quick biscuit recipe. I'll have fun adding various things to give it a little more flavor and texture. But it's great as is with some butter and jam, mmmm!

I have been trying to make biscuits for the longest time, and always failed badly..this recipe was SO perfect and SO easy..the biscuits turned out flaky and full of flavour. I didn't change anything except I used powdered milk. Will be making these for the rest of my life!

These biscuits are easy to make in a short period of time.  They are so yummy with some jam for breakfast.  They are also so moist and fluffy!!  When I made these biscuits I added some shredded spicy cheese to half of the batch.  I will definitely make these again!

I just made these tonight and read several reviews who advised not to add the Cream of Tartar which I didn't, but these turned out exactly like pancakes, same look, taste, and consistency. I don't believe it was the omitting the cream of tartar that did that, but not sure where I went wrong. I would definitely attempt these again with the cream of tartar to see if this makes a difference.

I am terrible at biscuits!  These for me came out wonderful though.  I made sure not to over mix.  I added extra baking powder in place of the cream of tartar.  You can  add cheese, or add more sugar and cinnamon etc.  Any nut butter or jelly would be great.

The first time I made it, they spread like crazy - tasted wonderful, but were flat and about 4 inches across.  Tonight, I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups and started with 1/2 cup milk and added a little at a time to get the right consistency.  Probably ended up with a total of 3/4 cup milk.  They are in the oven now and holding their shape beautifully!  Both times I also omitted the cream of tartar per other reviews.

Quick and easy. My 12 year loves to make these.  Just concerned about the amount of fat. Found another quick and easy recipe with coconut oil.

These turned out great.  We liked the taste even more than the Bisquick drop biscuits, which is what I normally make.  I ran out of Bisquick and needed a quick biscuits recipe for dinner.....this was perfect!!

These are easy to make and I changed the cream of tartar to lemon juice and they turned out flaky.  I doubled the size of them served with melton butter brushed on top. Family loved them!

I have made this recipe twice and both times the biscuits have turned out light and fluffy. I have increased slightly the amount of baking powder to replace the Cream of Tartar, which I didn't have. Also the second time i was low on butter and used half butter/ half shortening and put just a touch of heavy cream along with the milk. Perfect!

This was a good recipe. I did wheat flour instead of white. I did a tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt and left out the cream of Tartar. I also did brown sugar instead of white and the amount of brown sugar I put in was a tablespoon. These came out yummy. My kids approved so I will make this again with my own tweaks.

These were quick, easy and super yummy! I didn't have enough butter so I used quarter cup butter and quarter cup canola oil. I liked how the consistency of the biscuits came out with this adjustment to the recipe. Definitely a new favorite!

I've tried this recipe a number of times now and it has now become my family's favorite! I've found that it's very versatile and can make DISTINCTLY different biscuits based on nothing more than what you do with the butter. If you MELT the butter, like the instructions say, and pour it in with the milk, you have fantastic drop-style biscuits with no changes to the original recipe. If you GRATE cold butter into the dry ingredients before adding the milk, the drop in liquid makes a perfectly smooth traditional biscuit dough that can be rolled out and cut into biscuits that rise and give the most amazing texture. After cooking for large crowds at our church, I've found this recipe fits my rule: the simpler the better!

This recipe was really good. I left out the cream of tartar since the recipe calls for one tablespoon of baking powder, and added some parmesan cheese and shredded cheddar. I followed the other directions as listed and they came out perfect! I used a cookie scoop to scoop them onto a parchment lined baking sheet and got about 14 biscuits. The exteriors had a light crunch and the interiors were moist and delicious. This is definitely a keeper in this household!

I tried this recipe again today. The only adjustment I made besides not adding cream of tartar was to warm the milk. They def came out much more improved than my first results. They were light, fluffy and a bit crumbly, which I didn't mind. I plan to keep the recipe once again. 


My original review is as follows. These did not come out at all how I thought they would. Mine weren't light, fluffy or flaky, they were just masses of what tasted like unseason dumplings. It may have been because I used 1/4 c butter and the other 1/4 cup olive oil. I'm very disappointed, but over all it may have been my inability to make a good biscuit to save my life.

I substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice for the cream of tartar and 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk mixed with 1/2 cup of water for the milk because i didnt have it on hand. They were very very yummy. My husband loved them. We used them with sausage gravy.

Good recipe. Very easy to make. I used cold butter and cut it into the dry ingredients. I served them with chicken soup (instead of dumplings) and they seemed to have needed a bit more salt. If I was going to serve them with sausage gravy, it would probably be fine. I added some parsley and oregano. Would be good with some cheese or some melted butter with garlic on top (or both!!). With adjustments this will be our go to biscuit recipe.

Very good for no shortening. I too omitted the cream of tartar but i melted additional butter and mixed with salt and drizzled it over the biscuits so they didn't taste so bland. I know thats how they did it when i worked at ruby tuesday.

Easy and delicious.  I did not add the cream of tartar and they turned out tender and fluffy on the inside.  I used an ice cream scoop to portion them onto the baking sheet and came out with a dozen good size biscuits.  This will be my new "go-to" recipe for quick biscuits and gravy :)

I made these to go with new years breakfast, and I added italian seasoning, garlic and cheese, they were very easy to make.  No rolling, no cutting, no needing.  They were really good, will definitely make again!

I chose this as my first recipe for baking biscuits--I'm a cook, not a baker!  I grated the butter as much as possible and baked them in a cast-iron pan, which produced the crispy bottom I was craving.  I had to use non-sodium baking powder due to dietary restrictions, so they didn't rise as much as they might have otherwise, but the texture was very, very nice.  I gave the dough a little gloss of oil before putting into the oven so that the tops were as crispy as the bottoms.  Served them with coconut-curried butternut squash soup for Christmas Eve dinner.  I'll be happy to use this recipe again.

This is a great recipe and very easy to follow.  I made drop biscuits when I don't wanna roll out biscuits.  I normally make these with homemade gravy easy peasy.   Light brown on the bottom and crispy.  Middle was nice and fluffy and soft and top was soft with a bit of crunch.  Perfect.  When I was throwing this all together I had already added my cup of milk.  The dough seemed kinda wet already and I yet had to add my melted butter.  I was nervous so I went ahead and melted my stick of butter and it ended up being 3/4 cup!  So, I just used 1/2 cup of it and added to biscuit dough.  I am sooo glad I didnt add the whole thing!  So, I hope y'all read my review about my butter tip!  An alternative is if you just add a little more flour to compensate thats ok too if you wanna use the whole stick of butter.  This is my new go to drop biscuit recipe.  10 minute baking time was perfect.

These were very good. I made with half the amount of Cream of Tarter and a hare more of the salt and sugar. They came out wonderfully... although my boyfriend thinks they look funny. He did eat them and said they tasted good.I really liked them a lot. I still want to try other recipes, but may put this one in the rotation. They almost taste like  a less greasy version of KFC's biscuits.

I really like this recipe! Easy and good. I used buttermilk and no cream of tartar. Made them with & without sharp cheddar for for a more savory version. Either way they are great!

I made two batches of these biscuits exactly as the recipe stated.  They were very easy and quick to whip up.  The first batch came out great.  The second batch was over mixed (by a helper) and it still came out great!  This will be my 'go to' biscuit recipe from now on!

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  It was super easy and I'll never buy boxed biscuit mix again.  I would reduce the milk slightly because the batter was a little runny than expected so the biscuits didn't hold their shape as much as I would have liked, but the flavor was great with butter and my husband could believe I made these from scratch.

Will someone tell me why I have been buying prepared biscuits all these years?  I needed something quick to go with a pot of soup, and these  mixed together in a snap and were delicious!  I didn't have cream of tartar, but it certainly didn't matter.  Thanks for this recipe!

Great! I needed to make 50 biscuits and tried a recipe with hardened butter, too time consuming. I tried this and it is fast and easy.  Better tasting too!  No cream of tarter.  They are flaky and tasty. Used mix of milk and buttermilk.

More salt.  No cream of tartar.  Other than that, these were great.  I added fresh basil, lemon thyme and sage to my batter for an herb biscuit.  The recipe says to bake for 8-12 minutes.  I put them in for 10 minutes and the bottoms burnt.  With that in mind, I would suggest closer to the 8 minute mark.

I love this recipe! I sometimes adapt it: adding fresh rosemary when serving with lamb stew, sometimes adding cheese (just because I am a cheese addict!) I am going to try adding blueberries and lemon zest, then finishing off with a light sprinkle of fine sugar on top.

Excellent. Even my 2 year old can make these. I measure just out ingredients. She dumps them in the bowl and mixes. She then spoons them out onto the tray. This last bit requires some supervision. I make a 1/2 recipe and end up with 9 half dollar size biscuits. Perfect every time.

Made these biscuits for the first time and they were a delicious compliment for my country gravy.  I didn't use cream of tartar though.  Next time I make them though, I'll add a dash more salt.

I left out the cream of tarter based on others' suggestions.  These are delicious!  They have a very tender crumb, because the butter is melted.  If you are looking for very flaky biscuits, then you want to use very cold butter and cut it into the flour.

Easy-peasy and on the table in the same amount of time as biscuit mixes. I altered the recipe when I decided on herbed biscuits and added fresh parsley, fresh thyme, garlic & onion powder and omitted the cream of tartar because I didn't have any.  Turned out great!  My new go-to recipe for quick & yummy biscuits!

Great recipe! Added a couple of tablespoons of vanilla yogurt to make them moist, a tad bit of cinnamon and a little more sugar. Also did not use cream of tartar, came out great! Will make again.

I was surprised at how well these turned out with just a few basic ingredients, very fluffy and light.  I did omit the cream of tartar, only because I didn't have any...and I threw in some grated parmesan cheese....yummy!  I had mine warm with a little butter, and my son had his with my homemade sausage gravy...they were loved both plain and with gravy.  I've tried several different recipes, but a lot turned out tasting doughy or like warm flour....don't have a better way to describe it.  LOL  This one is a keeper!

Truly exceptional! Not only the easiest biscuit I have ever made but also one of the best tasting. I am currently looking for an excuse to make them again. Great steaming hot right out of the oven. Slather with butter and homemade cherry preserves :-) I don't know what they taste like cold. They never lasted that long.

tastes heavy on the baking powder.  Perhaps adding more cheese and some garlic powder, then brushing with butter hot out of the oven would help.

Yum! I want so badly to make good homemade biscuits and I haven't had luck with the rolled ones. I think this is my go to recipe now. Maybe a tad too sweet, so will reduce sugar next time. Can't wait to try them with cheese and garlic! Oh and i left out the cream of tartar per other reviewers.

Super easy! Didn't add cream of tartar as I didn't have any and increased the sugar to 3 TBSP as I am using them for strawberry shortcakes.  Thank you for sharing such a tasty and easy recipe!!

These were very easy and very yummy. I did not have cream of tartar on hand, so did not use it. I used my small muffin scoop to portion them and got 10 good sized biscuits. 

My own preference would have been a *little* more salt, but that's just me. They mixed together super-quick and my family really liked them. I liked only getting a bowl and a small microwave cup dirty, instead of my KitchenAid. Thanks for the recipe!

Giving them a 3 because they were pretty easy.  But they were pretty bland.  Next time I'm increasing the salt.  They needed salt. I added a garlic bread seasoning and an herb seasoning blend, but definitely not enough.  I would also like to try them again with shredded cheese.  The consistency was perfect.  I also left out the cream of tartar.

These are quick and easy. I added sharps cheddar and colbyjack which added perfect salty flavor. They also look great. Perfect for a dinner party. Yum!

I actually made these gluten free and they turned out phenomenal! I substituted 2 cups of gluten free baking mix (I use Arrowhead Mills) for the flour, and also omitted the cream of tartar. I was SO excited when I tasted these. Definitely will be making them again.

So Quick & Easy! Came out perfect! I used whole wheat and added a tad more butter. I always only use whole wheat so very happy this worked great! They taste wonderful, moist, crusty outside with perfect texture inside! Thanks for posting this!

Fantastic.  I used 1/4 cup less milk and mixed in cheese and seasoning to make Italian Style drop buiscuits.  Had another recipe I used for that advice.  Super great.

I've had a good drop biscuit recipe for years.  I thought I would try a different version this time around.  Even though they are only slightly different, these just have the little bit something special.  I have a new favorite drop biscuit recipe now!

This is one of the easiest biscuit recipes I have used. They come out soft and fluffy every time. You can add cheddar cheese to change the taste. They are super.

Easy & fast and really good biscuits, did not use cream of tartar as suggested by other reviewers, did add sharp cheddar cheese & dried herbs, also used 1 cup of white flour & 1 cup of whole wheat.  Can't wait to try these again at a little lower temp. as 450 degrees is a little too high for my oven. But this is a keeper recipe for me.  Thank you.

E-Z to make with good results.  I reduced to 8 and found I had to watch the liquid.  Very light, sweet and great tasting.  I did extend the cooking time by three minutes.

I've made these 2 ways... exactly by the recipe (really good) and also using one of the ideas from a review... cut the butter into small pieces and stir in with the batter (made them even better)!

I LOVE this recipe! I use them to make dumplings as well as biscuits!! Just drop into boiling stew or soup and let simmer/ low boil for 10 min then cover another 10 min they turn out wonderful! They make my chicken and dumpling recipe amazing! Also works wonders for cheddar dumplings in a beef stew! 
 I love them as biscuits as well cheddar biscuits topped with 1/4 test garlic powder in 3 tablespoons or so of melted butter brushed on top of warm baked biscuits tastes even better then red lobsters!! Topped with sausage gravy and they are WONDERFUL!!! Love love love these biscuits!!! THANKS!

These were really easy to make.  I found them a bit bland, but really, it's a biscuit so I didn't mind.  They were nice and moist and I will gladly make them again.

Delicious, I didn't use the cream of tartar, and added cheese on top of some and sugar on top of others.  They were light, fluffy and very easy to make.  Thanks for that recipe, this is my new biscuit recipe!

I just made this recipe last night and as a person who biscuits are typically unedible I was happy to find a recipe where I could make them from scratch and my family be able to eat them. Im not giving 5stars due to the fact that the biscuits flavoring seemed to be lacking something. Gonna try to tweek it a little but I think it needs a pinch more salt and butter but other than that great recipe. I also got 16 biscuits out of my batch not 12 so that was a good thing. Very easy and didnt take long to fix.

I've made these twice and both times they didn't turn out the best.  The flavor is decent but the texture/shape leaves a little something to be desired.  Looked more like a giant sugar cookie than a biscuit.

Wonderful, easy biscuits.  Added a little garlic and fresh parm cheese; otherwise exactly as written WITH cream of tarter.  It was a little soupy but I let it sit for a few minutes and it sort of filled in and rose.  I gently scooped it out onto the pan.  They were a little flat (probably user error) but were delicious; a slight crisp on the outside but fluffy and moist on the inside.  No butter needed at the table.  Kids and husband loved them!!

easy! left out cream of tartar as suggested by others. tasty as is. for healthier version, i used half wheat flour, half white flour; and melted brummel spread for the butter. i also made sure oven was ready to go before mixing the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.

At first I was baffled that they didn't look like they were done.  But they were!  I thought oh no!!!! But everyone loved them and ate them up.  While they don't look light and fluffy they are!  Great recipe exactly like it is written.

Very easy and delicious! I also omitted the extra cream of tartar and added some shredded parmesan & asiago. Next time, I would add some garlic flavor, and they would be perfect!

Delicious! We ate them with sausage gravy for dinner, and the only one left was eaten without any added flavors. It was a delectable light, and airy biscuit.

Followed the recipe exactly and came out with light, flaky, and tasty biscuits! Preparing them couldn't have been easier. I will definitely make these again, and perhaps add shredded cheese as suggested.

Solid drop biscuit recipe.  Skip the cream of tartar though.  It is uneccessary and flavor is better without it.  Also note that if you make larger biscuits, cook time moves to 12 - 16 min.  These are great for strawberry shortcakes as well.  Add an extra tsp of sugar to sweeten the biscuit a bit more for desserts.

So simple, so easy, definitely a keeper.  I made this for a biscuit topping for a chicken casserole.  Amazing.  It can easily be spiced it up a bit with different herbs and/or cheeses to suit the pallet - but overall its Fantabulous!

These were quite fast and delicious! I did sub white whole wheat flour for the all purpose and did not add the cream of tartar. I served these with chicken noodle soup from this website and they were very good!

This recipe didn't work for me.  I don't think I ended up with the desired texture of dough - It started off very liquidy and took a lot of stirring and a minute or so of letting it sit to get firm enough for me to drop on the pan.  It never really rose to anything more than what looked like a cookie, and at the point that I had to take it out to avoid burning the bottom, the top was very pale.  The taste was okay, but I'd have definitely preferred the big puffy biscuit I see in others' pictures.  I reread the recipe and am sure I did nothing wrong, so I don't know how I got such different results from other reviewers...

Very Nice and moist.  I cut the recipe in half. I kept the sugar the same with just a tad bit more. I like my biscuits a little sweet. I did add melted butter to the tops.  The only problem I had was I think the brown on the bottom much quicker than the top. I may broil a tiny bit next time. These were awesome and I did leave out the cream of tartar and I probably could have use the entire 1/4 of salt instead of 1/8 when I cut them in half.

My family LOVED these!  I didn't use the cream of tarter and they were delicious.  They were flakey and fluffy (much to my suprise).  I will definitely make them again.....next time I will try them for dinner with a little bit of garlic and cheese....so versatile and fast and EASY!!!

You cannot beat how easy this recipe is. I substituted 1/3 c of protein powder for flour (picky eater in the house).  I did half with cheese and half without.  Both were good.  This is definitely a biscuit, not a scone.  Without cold butter you can't expect fluffiness, but considering these were ready to bake before the oven was at temperature...I will make again.

These were very good and very easy.  Only changes I made was as follows.  Used 1/2 milk and 1/2 non-fat half-and-half.  I also sofened the butter and then mixed it in with my mixer before adding the milk and half-and-half.  I also left out the cream of tarter as others suggested.

My new favorite biscuit recipe. I made the half recipe for husband and I; we ate all 6 biscuits at dinner. Only addition of 1/4 tsp garlic and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, next time I would add more.

I omitted the cream of tartar and added some grated parmigiano and cheddar cheese.  Still lacked a little flavor for me, but were a quick fix in a pinch.

Delicious! I made half a batch, cooked them for about 9 minutes and they were PERFECT! I do have to say though, what made them so perfect was melting some butter and mixing some garlic powder with it and brushing the biscuits on the top with the butter mixture when they were hot out the oven! DELICIOUS!!! :) Thank you!!

Wonderful.   I cut in the cold butter rather than melting.  I also skipped the cream of tartar.  Additionally, I doubled the salt - because I like salty biscuits!  They were a little sweeter than I expected, but still a great breakfast!

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for biscuits to go with some soup I made. I tried these last minute and they were great! I added some shredded cheddar into the mix and my kids loved them. Didn't have creme of tartar so didn't use it and wouldn't have known the difference. They were great.

Wow these are amazing!  I was so sick of the recipes where I had to cut in cold butter (and the mess it made) so this was a great find.  I got a little worried with how wet the mixture was but I did everything the recipe stated so I figured it must be right.  It was.  I made them pretty big, and they turned out great!  Thank you so much.

I needed something really quick and this was the answer. I had it all prepped and ready to go in 5 mins, maybe rushed too much.  Followed the recipe exactly, but forgot the cream of tartar and added it in at the end (mistake maybe). I baked for 14 mins, but they wouldn't get brown on top, scared of them getting too dry so I took them out.  I will definitely make these again, maybe next time baste with a little butter on top??  Great quick and tasty biscuit.  Thanks Angela!

Substitute 2 cups SELF-RISING flour and OMIT the baking powder and cream of tartar for very light and delicious biscuits. Also, lowfat or skim milk as well as lowfat butter work well in this recipe.

Made this with my boys.  Very easy to make. We loved them.  Added cheddar cheese as the author said she sometimes does.  Omitted the cream of tartar and used less butter.  They were still tasty and crumbly.

This is my go to recipe when I need a fresh bread fix.  I make a few changes for my personal taste.  I leave out the cream of tartar, use 1/4 c. melted butter and change out the milk for buttermilk.

Hi every one its me Casserroo.  My husband and I just finished eating these for dinner.  They were very delicious.  However, I did have a little trouble with them, but that was my fault.  I forgot to wait the full amount of time for my oven to preheat.  My oven takes fifteen minutes to fully preheat.  I ended up, baking my biscuits twenty minutes.  The extra wait was worth the wait.  I just love that smell of fresh baked bread or biscuits flowing through out my apartment.   My husband commented that these tasted alot like this aboriginal bread his family made while he was hgrowing up, called Banic.  Thanks for the really great easy recipe.  I got twelve biscuits out of that recipe and we will be eating the left overs for breakfast.  Thanks again for the terriffic tasting and really easy recipe!!!    Oh, yeah, by the way they are very filling!!!

These were so easy, fast, and tasty.  Halved the recipe and got 5 biscuits.  Omitted the cream of tartar like most (because I didn't have any).  I was serving these with some pasta marinara so I added about a TBS of Italian seasonings and a heaping tsp of garlic powder.  I will make these again, and as many have suggested, you can improvise with a lot of different flavorings.

Excellent, and so easy! I did not use cream of tartar because I didn't have any. I used a cinnamon flavored Rice milk in place of regular milk. I will definitely make these again and play around with additions and substitutions.  I'm thinking of honey and butter baked into the top! ** update** I tried regular milk, added 2 tsp cinnamon and a little applesauce and I wasn't too pleased.  Maybe it was too much cinnamon...

These were yummy. I made them with Trader Joe's whole grain milk and vegan margarine and used half whole wheat/half white flour but they still turned out quite crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and flavorful. Very easy and quick. Thanks!

I don't usually like drop biscuits but I needed something to go with dinner and came accross this recipe. They were so easy my 11 year old made them from start to finish! They were also tasty, so light and fluffy. We did add some chedder cheese and top them with garlic butter. I think this is a good base recipe that you could do anything to.

Great recipe. Easy and delicious. I drop them on sheet using a 1/3 mixing cup. Combine this with Bill's Sausage Gravy (also on this site) and breakfast is complete.

My husband loved these biscuits and this recipe will now be my go-to. I modifed it a bit, but not much. Reduced the cream of tarter to 1/4 tsp., deleted the salt entirely since I used salted butter. Next time I might add Thyme or Rosemary or Sharp cheddar!

These are great. Easy and fluffy...very little mess. I made 10 instead of 12 - my only advice would be to watch them closely. I almost burned them because they didn't look done. They don't really change color from the dough to done.

I only gave this four stars because I didn't use the cream of tartar and they came out amazing. Instead of melting the butter I chopped up the whole stick to put in so it needed a little more milk.

I am usually a flop when it comes to baking and it seems I ALWAYS over-mix biscuits, but these were excellent! So soft, tender, and delicious! I dropped them by the spoonful into a 12-cup muffin pan. Very easy and great biscuits!

I was in the middle of making a turkey dinner when i realized i didn't have any biscuits, so i needed a quick recipe that i had all the ingredients readily available for, so i found this, followed it except for the tart which i didn't have.  Nonetheless, they were easy and delicious, and i would definately make them again.  They were delicious, everyone loved them :)

i used to use a biscuit recipe that required cutting in hard butter.  I almost never made buscuits because it took so long.  I love how easy this recipe is and it tastes great!  i leave out the cream of tarter because its not something i keep in my pantry and they are still great!

I've made these biscuits a few times now, and my family loves them.  When made as-is, the dough is too loose.  It takes about another half cup of flour to get the right consistency.  I leave out the cream of tartar, and sometimes add a bit of garlic powder and cheddar cheese.  My kids love these biscuits, and they are so easy to throw together last-minute.

Super Easy to make! It took less time to make these than to buy them in the tube from the store, open it, separate them and put them on a cookie sheet. And it's certainly cheaper. My only complaint, hence the 4 stars, is that they are not the most flavorful or as dense as some. But in a jiffy they're perfect!

I loved the texture of these muffins. Crisp on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle. I think they could have used a little more flavor though. We ate them plain, so I'm sure spreading some butter on them will definitely help. Also, I didn't use cream of tartar. Yummy!

A regular in our household!   I make them dairy free with vegetable oil and rice milk into a variety of shapes for my allergic son and he LOVES them.   Very easy and quick to prepare.   A star at potlucks too.

I love how easy this recipe is.  It's really a no fail recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the cream of tartar.  For a great flavor I added a teaspoon of thyme and a teaspoon of parsley.  The flavor from the thyme was wonderful!  Will make these again.

Nice basic biscuit.  My daughter can't have dairy, so I made this recipe with Earth Balance instead of butter and rice milk in place of cow's milk.  I also used organic whole wheat flour instead of a more processed flour.  Fast and easy recipe.  I can't imagine how yummy they would be with some garlic and cheese mixed in!

Very good biscuits and super easy to make. My family raved about the taste and I raved about how easy it was to make such tasty and tender biscuits.  I'll never buy frozen biscuits again. Try this recipe, you'll enjoy them.

I've made these twice now.  Once served alone with a meal, and I made them once with a sausage gravy from this site.  Both times the biscuits turned out sooo flaky and delicious!!  I have found the biscuit recipe that I will stick with. I did leave out the cream of tartar both times.

Easy to make, light and fluffy.  I added 1 egg by mistake, and it still came out good.  Will use again and again. Update, last night I added shredded cheese and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the mix, then topped with cheese the last few minutes of cooking, really great.

I was in the mood for biscuits, but wanted something easy.  I found this recipe and I have to say it was super easy and taste just as good.  This will be the way to make biscuits versus buying premade. I would not change a thing.

I was very surprised at how well these turned out. I had decided to make breakfast one morning for me and my husband, but had no shortening, no cream of tartar, nothing but the most basic ingredients. These were fine w/o the cream of tartar. I did have to add a tablespoon or so of extra flour, but I will definitely make these again.

Fab...they're not pretty, but they are nice and fluffy, not dense at all. I halved the recipe and added a lot more sugar than was called for, but didn't change anything else. Definitely tastes better than packaged biscuits or biscuit mix, and the recipe is versatile too, so you can tailor it to the meal.

Very very easy and very good.  I wish they were just a bit fluffier and lighter, but I'm not sure you will get that with a drop biscuit. Try this and you won't be disappointed!

Meh. Made them to go with some soup. I dropped them into a mini muffin pan. They were quite dense. I prefer rolled out biscuits so much more.

For as much margarine as I had to put in these, I thought they were disappointing.  They still needed to be topped with more spread to make them appealing.  I much prefer the mini sour cream biscuits on this site.  I put them on the pan like a drop biscuit.  They are delectable fresh from the oven.  Sorry!

These were absolutely wonderful, I loved the texture.  Didn't have cream of tartar and didn't miss it.  I can't believe they tasted so good and were so easy to make.  Will become a staple in my home.
2/1/10 - made again tonight.  Used 1/4 tsp cream of tartar and lowered the temp to 400 degrees.  They were done in 12 minutes in my oven.  Made a huge difference, there were no crumbly biscuits at all.

I love these! They are easy, taste great, and all the ingredients are already in your pantry! I skipped the Cream of Tarter only because I didn't have it. They were still great!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I've been searching everywhere for a nice soft drop biscuit with this texture.  This is fantastic!  Soft without being greasy, and flavoured with BUTTER to boot! This will definitely be my go to biscuit recipe from now on!

Very easy.  I halved the recipe.  I too left out the cream of tartar.  Also used this recipe for shortcakes.  I just doubled the sugar then added some more to taste.  Came out beautifully!

I was out of biscuit mix and looking for  a recipe that had ingredients I already had in my cabinets.  I didn't have the tartar but the biscuits came out fine without it.  We actually like the taste of these biscuits better than the package mix biscuits.

These were fantastic. It is hard to find a biscuit recipe that doesn't use shortening. We ate these with apple butter and the leftovers were even good reheated. Yummy!!

I just made these to go with dinner tonight.  They are extremely easy to make.  I skipped the cream of tarter like many others and added garlic powder and oregano.  It's a really good mix I'll be using a lot!  Thank you!!

This gets 5 stars for good taste and super super easy prep.  I left out the cream of tartar (didn't have any). I thought they were awesome. I prefer not to cook with lard, and was looking for a quick easy biscuit recipe that didn't call for kneading, rolling, etc. Loved them!

Perfect recipe that is very easy to prepare. I would recommend doubling this recipe in order to cut the buscuits to 1 inch thick, so that you do not end up with thin, hard patties.

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were honestly not that good. I tried again, though, but this time I substituted the 1/2 Tsp. cream of tartar for 1 Tsp. of garlic powder, and then  dropped them as 7 large biscuits onto my baking sheet and added shredded cheddar cheese on top before putting them in the oven. I highly recommend the substitution!

This recipe was very good.  I was trying to find a biscuit recipe that didn't require Bisquick, using a pastry cutter, and kneading and cutting the dough.  This one was perfect and it was quick and easy to make.  I too did not use the cream of tartar because I didn't have any.  I will definitely be making these again.  My husband loved them!!

Let me just say, that I'm from the old school where I was taught to cook from scratch by my Grandmother.  These are one of the best biscuits I have ever had!  When I bit into them it was like airy and moist that I couldn't believe these were the bisuits I had just whipped up in 5 mins.  Thanks so much for sharing, you definetly have mad skills in the kitchen!

Wow! I'm a first time baker and wanted an easy recipe- I live overseas where certain ingredients are hard to find but this recipe was so simple, I didn't even need to go to the market. I had everything already. I followed the recipe as best as I could, since I don't have measuring cups or spoons. Even so, these biscuits turned out perfect! I love this recipe.

These were simple and quick.  They were a perfect compliment to a Saturday morning breakfast...and they were still cumbly and tender after we forgot them for a few hours on the counter!  Everyone near me is shocked that I can make homemade biscuits...but it's totally thanks to this recipe, that I make without changing a thing.

This is an excellent drop buscuit recipe!  It takes no time and the biscuits are so light and fluffy.  I have to make extra when I make biscuits and gravy because my guys like to eat them for dessert with butter and honey.  YUM!

Very basic but so easy.  I was looking for something to make very last minute to have with soup and did not want the fuss of rolling/cutting.  These were just the ticket. Turned out perfectly.  
Easy to jazz up as others have suggested with cheese, garlic powder etc.

Makes good biscuits.  I use buttermilk and no cream of tartar.  I also add enough flour to pat out biscuits so I can cut them.

I didn't add the cream of tartar(didn't have any, and after reading reviews didn't feel it necessary), and substituted buttermilk for regular milk.  I realize that it's not following the recipe to the letter, but darn, it sure was tasty.  Light, crisp shell, soft interior.  Excellent!

These were just what I was lookin for!  I wanted to make an easy biscuit for strawberry shortcake.  I made these minus the cream of tartar and put half on the cookie sheet.  Then I added shredded cheese and garlic powder to the rest and made biscuits for dinner.  Add 1/4 tsp. Old Bay to the mix and 1 TBSP. vinegar to the milk!  Both were delicious.

Didn't change a thing, and they were perfect!  I read the reviews, but didn't note any bitterness associated with the cream of tartar.

These were very easy to make biscuits.  I think I made them in less than 5 minutes (not including cooking time).  My toddler loved them, but I thought they were pretty bland.  I slapped on quite a bit of butter to make up for the lack of flavor.

This is the best drop biscuit recipe I've tried and with 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1/2 cup cheese it comes very close to the biscuits we love at a favotite seafood restaurant!

I loved these biscuits, they are better than Bisquick. They are soft, but not heavy. They also keep very well in a sealed plastic bag overnight. I added in some shredded cheese to the recipe and they were the perfect compliment to our minestrone soup!

My husband generally doesn't like homemade biscuits, and prefers the Grands flaky ones, but he couldn't stop eating these. Can't blame him--I couldn't either.

I was trying to make a quick supper for my family. I made sloppy joes and had intended to use store bought biscuit mix and found I was out. I tried this recipe and it was a wonderful addition to the sloppy joe casserole. YUMMY! I will use it again, I may not buy the store stuff anymore.

Really good biscuits!  I made these tonight to go with some soup and the only change I made was to add 1 Tbsp of sugar (instead of 2 tsp).  The end result was a really light, flaky and tasty biscuit....I would bet that this will become my "go to" biscuit recipe!

I thought these were very good, although a little plain. My husband LOVED them, and ate probably about 10 of them (mine made about 18 instead of 12). I didn't have any cream of tartar, but I did follow the rest of the recipe to a T. Maybe next time I'll spice them up a little bit...Very easy to make, and great paired with the Hamburger Vegetable Soup!

Delicious and easy!  I had to make breakfast quickly this morning and this recipe uses few ingredients and is easy to make.  I dug out our forgotten Cream of Tartar (waay in the back of the spice cabinet) and boy was it worth it!  This recipe comes together in a snap and my family loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is my new fav recipe.  So quick and easy and really yummy.  Cannot wait to serve them with dinner tonight with homemade soup(if I can stop eating them!!).  I added some shredded cheese and next time I'll add some mustard powder for a bit of a kick.

Oh my goodness! These biscuits are dangerously good! I made them to go with some homemade chili and before we even realized it, my husband and I had eaten all 12! These bisuits are so light and fluffy, better than any recipe I have ever tried. Thank you so much for sharing it! :)

The adults loved em! the kids...eh...what do they know. I added Colby Jack instead of cheddar like was recommended and I don't think I would do that next time. I was also afraid they weren't cooked and baked them a little longer than i should have. I will definitely make them again and I am sure they will be a hit with everyone.

My husband and I loved the taste! The biscuits were super easy. I did have a little problem with them spreading and coming out a lot more flat than I thought they should, but I will try to do better next time. I am looking forward to experimenting with cheese and spices!

Very Easy Recipe, I was looking for a biscuit recipe that didn't require a lot of work. We eat biscuits a lot with our meals and a regular biscuit recipe is just too much work to do every night for a family of 5. These were very light. They didn't rise as much as I had hoped but I think that is due to the fact I used oil instead of butter. Next time I will use butter and see what happens. I also left out the cream of tarter. Will use again and again.

These biscuits were excellent. I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, and I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 tbsp. of cinnamon, and as suggested, I left out the cream of tarter. Very fast, and all of my siblings loved them!

This recipe was so easy and turned out great.  However, the bisquits were rather bland.  A good base recipe.  I will make again and add cheese, etc.

These were really easy to prepare. I only used half of the cream of tartar, and, after reading the reviews, I used regular salted butter. I also brushed a little melted butter on the top of the biscuits before baking, and because I used my toaster oven, I baked them at 425 degrees for about 8 minutes. They turned out great: fluffy on the inside, and golden brown on the outside! Delish!!!

These were great! Better than Bisquick, and took me five minutes to put together.  I feel that this might not have worked for others because they goofed up something...these brown beautifully and taste GREAT! thanks!

Made corn chowder tonight and decided at the last minute I wanted biscuits.  For like no planning and about 2 minutes effort, these are great, although they do crumble.  My tummy won't notice the difference though!  Next time will try with cheddar garlic and herbs.

after I put only half the milk called for into the batter, I knew it was too much...it looked like soup! I tried to fix it by adding a little flour. Unfortunately I added too much and they came out heavy, although they did tast good. I think I'll give up trying to make homemade biscuits, I just can't seem to get them to turn out.

I followed this recipe exactly and was disappointed in the results.  The biscuits did not brown or turn golden on the top at all.  I baked them for the maximum time of 12 min and was afraid to burn the bottom and bake them any longer.  The consistency of the biscuit was not light and airy either.  These tasted more like over blown pancakes.  I think there is an error in the recipe- too much milk, too much cream of tartar, something.  The only way I could eat them was slathered with lots of butter and honey.  Will look for a different easy biscuit recipe.

These were okay. We ate them with sausage & gravy. Flatter than expected. Will stick to Betty Crocker.

YAY! Finally a biscuit that even I can't mess up.  We loved these.  Made them with turkey a-la king (also from this site).  They were a hit together.  I made 8 large biscuits.  I had one with dinner and had the other with butter and honey. YUM-O!

These came out better than I expected, but nothing spectacular.  I also left out the cream of tartar like others recommended.

These biscuits turned out awesome!!!  I tweeked the recipe some by added a generous amount of sharp cheddar cheese, garlic powder, and used garlic salt instead regular salt.  My husband loved them, but wanted them to be sweeter.  Next time, I will add more sugar and see how they turn out.  I'll make an updated review then...

These are very simple and easy to make, especially if you're crunched for time.  If you find them bland then try adding a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to make them more interesting.

Super, super easy to do.  Have made it with and without ww flour, and I find it tastes better without.  I don't put in the tartar as it isn't something I normally have.  I use my hands to mix as well.  Adding in cheese, garlic and italian herbs topped with some melted garlic butter...AWESOME  Or just as good plain with honey butter on it.  YUMMMY!!

Reading other people's reviews, I added more salt and they came out fine.  I also made them with light butter and skim milk.  In fact, I had made them to go with gravy before I realized I didn't have all of the ingredients.  So, I made the gravy the next day and reheated the biscuits.  They were still really great!

Mine didn't rise much and I thought they were a bit bland. Maybe, I over-mixed but I only did so until everything was blended.

Great recipe!! Very easy. Worked well with spelt flour and soy milk.(use less liquid if using spelt flour) Will make many more times. Next time I'll try with cheese. Thanks Angela.

Great tasting; moist!  I added a little more milk with great results, just for a more drop-biscuit-like consistency!  Yummy!

These E-Z drop biscuits are so fast and easy, they taste better than the ones you can buy in a store.  They are the perfect size for my kids, and made a wonderful start to our day.

These are the best biscuits I have ever made! They are delicious as well as easy to make! I am looking forward to the other suggestions of adding cheddar cheese to the recipe! I didn't have to change or alter the recipe at all.

This was very easy to make. I did add cheese and it tasted wonderful. I will make this again since my picky eaters even liked them! Thanks for a great easy recipe.
