Been using this recipe for around 35 years.  I use half ground beef and half italian sausage.  Also, frozen spinach works fine.  If you don't have ricotta cheese use cottage cheese.  I've also tried it with swiss cheese on top, then sprinkle parmesan on that and bake.  Great recipe, don't think you will be disappointed.

This recipe is great if you use it as a base for making lasagna. I realize this is a Johnsonville recipe, but the ground sausage wasn't sold at the store I went to so I used italian ground turkey (which is healthier anyway) and turned out just as good in my opinion. Also, made my own marinara/basil/red wine sauce. One other thing I changed that seemed to add a little more flavor was I sauteed the garlic and onions separate from the meat/marinara sauce and put them in with the ricotta spinach with a little powdered garlic as well. I'm sure it doesn't matter but I don't like plain layers of ricotta when you get that bite. I flavored my own sauce with oregano so it was in the pasta, not just on top like the recipe says (I would recommend making the sauce with more spices, even if you buy jarred).

Also, add on a few more sprinkles of mozzarella on top about 10 mins before the lasagna is supposed to be done... then leave in the oven for just a tad longer than it's supposed to once you turn the oven off so the italian spices brown a little and the flavors blend (YUM!!!)

I keep switching between this recipe and Enchilada Lasagna that I've taken from gourmetrecipe.com. The taste is just very adorable. I think I can't let go both of these recipes. The procedures written on this page is a little bit different from mine. I guess I'm gonna have to apply it even though I already have different versions.

First, I made this AS WRITTEN. I hate it when people write a review based on all the changes they made to the original recipe. My teenage son and his friends thought it was fantastic. I didn't care for the texture of the sausage, too chewy, but I liked the rest so I will probably make it again but stick with ground beef.

I thought this was just OK. I used Johnsonville ground Mild Italian sausage and it was actually too mild for my personal taste. However, my main disappointment is that the sausage was very greasy. I usually cook with very lean ground beef, so this was a bit on the heavy side for me. I drained the meat in a colander and pressed on it with paper towels to get out as much of the grease as I could, but when I cut the first piece there was a rush of liquid in the pan and at least 3/4" of grease gathered where the piece had been. 
All that aside, it gets four stars because my kids ate it and my daughter even had seconds. Next time I make this I will use a spicier sausage and really, really drain the grease off.

This was an absolute hit with the family! Only a few changes were made on my part. I used 2 cups ricotta and 2 cups low fat cottage cheese. I also used frozen spinach, thawed instead of fresh. 
Time consuming but worth it, as there will be left overs.

This is a basic, tried-and-true recipe for making lasagna.  There are so many ways to change this up if one wishes to.  I used the Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage, which was quite flavorful and melded nicely with the organic pasta sauce that I used.  Since I couldn't help myself, I snuck in some slices of provolone between the mozzarella and lasagna noodle layers.  It was delicious served with a green salad and home made garlic toast on the side.  Treat your family.  You won't be disappointed!

This was super good! I made this even easier by using no-boil noodles for the first time, and it turned out perfect. I am so very excited to have this as left overs for the next few days. I used Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage and it really made the lasagna stand out.

This was underwhelming to say the least. I was disappointed in the lack of flavor in this dish.  The recipe really needs to kick up the seasoning and meat. It was edible but I will not be using this recipe again.

I am a big fan of Johnsonville products, so, thought I would give this a try.   I made exactly as the recipe stated.  I really liked the creaminess the ricotta gave the lasagna and the spinach was a nice addition.  Personally, I thought the sausage taste was a little too much for us for this recipe.  Next time I will do have beef and half sausage.

Made as is. Definitely needs more meat sauce, I would double. We ended up breaking out a jar sauce and pouring it on top just to make it edible. Once we did that, it was great!!!

This was my first time making lasagna, and I made it exactly as written. I even found "Italian-style" shredded mozzarella cheese. Leftovers are a struggle in my house, but this actually got eaten up within a couple days! Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was... alright. I followed another user's tip to mix the sauteed onion and garlic into the ricotta instead of the meat, and it definitely made it tastier. I added a whole bunch of salt and pepper into this mixture as well because ricotta can often be pretty bland. For me the measurements of the sauce and meat is a little bit off--most definitely the sauce. Since I didn't have enough sauce, the edges of the noodles did not cook, which was sad. I used a tomato/basil store-bought sauce and mixed in a heap of oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder to enhance the taste. In the end, I really wanted more salt and spice. I suppose it depends on the person, but I do agree that this recipe ended up a bit bland, even with the spicy sausage and spiced up sauce I used.

This is probably the best lasagna recipe I have come across - but only if you increase the amount of marinara sauce!  The first time, the recipe was followed exactly, but we found it was a little dry and needed at least 1.5 to 2 times the amount of sauce - and a little extra mozzarella doesn't hurt either :)  Also (personal preference), the 2nd time I made it I used ground beef instead of sausage and liked it even better.

We enjoyed this very much. I put it together in the morning and only had to pop it in the oven at dinner time allowing me to spend time with my family instead of spending all my time in the kitchen cooking. Tasty and a fun Sunday dinner.

Great recipe!!!!! Will make again, with a few adjustments. To me it was a little dry so I am going to use more meat sauce.  Instead of repeating the layering steps three times, which makes 4 layers of noodles, going to repeat two times.  I like mozzarella so lots more mozzarella on top.  Thanks for the recipe......

AMAZING! I changed a couple of things to make it spicier.  I used spicy ground sausage instead of regular, spicy marinara sauce instead of four cheese and frozen spinach that was thawed and drained. So good!

One of my favorite dishes to make for a few days of leftovers. My wife doesn’t like ground meat with pasta so I ha e to be creative, I like to buy Italian sausage  strip them out of there casings cut them in half and cook over stovetop until close to done. And than use the links as a layer of meat and just spread red sauce over them. Fantastic treat!! All my coworkers love it! As well as my wife. We can finally have  lasagna again.

Very good! It was a little cheesy, and I would love for there to be more meat. Also it could use a little more seasoning and spices, but otherwise this is a great base lasagna!

This lasagna was excellent.  I like the Italian Sausage instead of ground beef...more flavorful.

I loved this. My non-eating ricotta family did not give it a fair shake but I loved the depth of flavor that the sausage added.

The recipe does not call for any seasonings so I added salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and Herbs de Provence. I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage, which by the way is delicious. I did find the lasagna a bit on the dry side, so next time i will double the sauce.

This was easy to put together and tasted great, it was much better the next day. It was a bit on the runny side the night I made it. The next day, it was settled and easier to serve. My 3 year old loved it - the addition of spinach is a plus!

i added 16 ozs of ground beef to the 16 ozs of sausage. i used the johnsonville brand sausage, but i used the "hot" one...i like my food spicy. Since there was more meat, i also added another jar of marinara, for a total of 2 jars of marinara. Everyone that had it said it was the best lasagna theyve had. So Im happy. Next time I will add more ricotta , because i think it needed it.

This was my first try making lasagna and my husband approved. I used the spicy Italian sausage and used direct to oven lasagna noodles.

Big hit in my house. I used Johnsonville Italian sausage and it was delicious.  I liked the fresh spinach in it and will add this again. I did add a bit of red pepper flakes to the marinara sauce. I also seasoned my ricotta cheese with fresh basil and parsley. We loved it.

I have to be honest, I was skeptical about this... I dont know why, something about it.  I was so wrong.... it was so good.  My husband didnt love it but I think he tasted the spinach and he eats like a 5 year old.  My kids loved it and I sent some over to the neighbor and she thought it was delicious! I will definitely use the Johnsonville sausage again, but I might use my own recipe.

Very easy and good--I used no boil whole wheat lasagna noodles and it turned out perfectly.  My husband loves sausage and he chose this recipe over another, and we look forward to making it again!  Thanks for a great lasagna!

This was an awesome lasagna! I added mushrooms, green, red yellow and orange bell peppers and used sweet onions in mine, along with mozz and provolone shredded cheese.  Made my own sauce and baked two.  I got texts/calls VERY quickly about how good this was

This was an excellent variation of lasagna.  Everyone liked it and the leftovers went fast.  I used the sweet sausage and it had a definite sausage flavor so don't feel you have to use the spicy to notice the difference.  Will make again.
