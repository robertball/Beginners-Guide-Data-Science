It's a great recipe! I only gave it 4 stars because I had to doctor up the seasoning for the fish. I made the mango salsa almost exactly as the recipe calls for - I just added a bit of cilantro to the mix. Delicious flavor! I could tell by reading the seasoning ingredients for the fish (I used tilapia, since mahi was not available at the time) that it would be too bland. I gave it a wow factor by putting the zest and juice of 1 lemon onto both sides of the fish first, and then dredging both sides of the fish in taco seasoning. I baked the fish in an oiled baking dish at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. It came out fantastic! I served it with warm taco shells, a shredded blend of Mexican cheeses, and sour cream. Yum!

I made this tonight for my family and was so pleased! The salsa could possibly use 1.5 tbsp of brown sugar instead of two, but even the way it is written, it was probably the best fruit salsa I've ever tasted.  We used cod instead of mahi mahi and the flavors still complemented each other nicely.

This is the first recipe I have reviewed, although have been an Allrecipes user for years. My 5-yo daughter and my husband absolutely LOVED this recipe (I made it exactly as written). We had left over salsa and my husband has been looking for things to put it on...he said it was one of the best things he has ever eaten. Thanks for the this easy and tasty recipe!!

So delicious & easy to make.  Some revisions I made:  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and only added 1 T of oil.  I also added approx. 1/2 tsp dried coriander. I just used the fish I had on hand (president's choice blue menu lightly breaded haddock).  For a sauce, I used mild jalapeno yogurt dip from Costco.  Definitely a keeper.

We loved these tacos! 
I used soft tacos and made the shells star burst shaped before I put them in the oven draped over on the racks. This created a stand-up hard taco with a fun shape. I then used the cut-outs for cinnamon and sugar chips for dessert!
I added garlic to the seasoning for the fish, and used cod (as this is what I had). The result was a fantastic dinner. We really enjoyed the mango salsa and will be eating any left overs with nachos! I will for sure make this again!

I made this last night with Salmon instead of Tuna (it's what I had in the house).  The mango salsa was great with the avocado!  I made the salsa with pomegranate balsamic vinegar for a little sweeter finish.  This was a great dish, but the fish seasoning was bland, so I used a different recipe for blackening the fish, which gave this a little more kick.  I also topped with some creme fraiche (just a dab).  This was a fun base recipe but needed some livening up.

This recipe was outstanding!!!  I did not have any parsley, and only one avocado, but even without those it is hard to imagine it could have been any better.  I did use a little more onion (1/2 onion) and red bell pepper (1/2 bell pepper) for more crunch, but this is an easy recipe to tinker with.  When I try it next time, I think I will use cilantro instead of the parsley.

This was SO good!  Amazed at the flavor in the salsa.  Ended up being low on fish for the tacos so we could only have one.  Going to try the leftover salsa on some shredded chicken, but this is definitely a do-over dish.

I needed a recipe for mahi-mahi which was on sale.  I made the salsa as the recipe said except that I used dried parsley flakes. I ended up just serving it on the pieces of grilled fish as I had no tortillas.  It was delicious, my husband really liked it, and I will make it again.

This salsa is so good. The only thing I changed was the red onion, not a fan otherwise so yummy. I've also made it with some fresh cod my husband brought home. It was even better than the mahi.

Delicious.   Instead of using taco shells I served the fish covered in salsa over salad greens.  Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was FANTASTIC!  We had it for leftovers even the next night and my wife was thrilled!  It was easy and delicious.  I cooked the mahi-mahi exactly as written (3 minutes on each side) and removed the skin before serving.  I highly recommend this one!  Enjoy!

So Yummy!!!  Huge family hit.  My family does not like avocados so we left those out of the salsa but otherwise so delicious! I did marinate the mahi mahi over night in a weber orange juice marinade. Then when I cooked it I added the paprika ect.  will be making this weekly!!!!

By far the best fish tacos! The mango salsa was fantastic. Next time I will not add brown sugar, really don't think it's necessary. The whole family enjoyed these. I used fresh flounder filet as Mahi Mahi was not available. Again, simply fantastic!

Was good I had to use Cod which made it a bit less desirable than as described above, but the excellent mango salsa made it very good.

I made this fish taco with the mango salsa and everyone really liked it.  Only change was that I didn't use any of the brown sugar.  In my opinion the sugar is totally unnecessary.

The salsa is amazingly good!!! The fish would have been better if I had been able to find fresh (not frozen) mahi mahi; I’ll use a different white fresh fish next time.

I wouldn't use canola oil it's way too powerful. Probably substitute it for coconut oil. I personally didn't like the mango but that's a personal preference. I added about 1 a teaspoon more salt to the fish and it came out tasty. I used 2 types of fish though (mahi mahi and red snapper). Otherwise i followed the entire recipe and came out tasty.

The Fish Tacos and Mango Salsa were delicious!  I only made two pieces of the Mahi Mahi but the  whole recipe for the salsa.  We also used it on grilled chicken and it was delicious!  You could put it on anything.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Used with cod.  Mango salsa is amazing - I didn't make any changes.  I will keep this for a healthy fish dinner on a regular basis.

We loved these tacos! We made a few modifications, omitted the red pepper (it  just didn't seem to fit?) and swapped the parsley with cilantro. For the hot sauce, we used Pickapeppa mango hot sauce. Also drizzled it on top. And we threw in a little shredded cabbage for a nice crunch. For the taco shells we used raw corn tortillas that had to be quickly cooked in a skillet. Delicious!!

This salsa is delicious and it made a lot more than I expected. It added just the right amount of sweetness. This turned out to be a really filling, delicious meal!

I used sole for the fish and added double the mango; another winner for sure!

I made this as written, except I used tilapia and cod for the fish. Oh, I added a tsp. or two of fresh jalapeño to the salsa and added shredded cabbage to the tacos, so very small changes.  Loved this recipe! The only thing I would change next time is to use a tad less brown sugar. The salsa was pretty sweet, but definitely delicious.
