Kind of flat. I thought I had made this before, but when I looked back I had actually made "Yummy Artichoke Dip" from this site which is much better. I added cream cheese to the leftovers to make it more like the other recipe and it improved.

This stuff is awesome! I have made it 4 times since I got the recipe and take it to all of our parties. I use 1 can of HOT chilies. It is still very mild, you could use hot for both if you wanted. MMMMM! Enjoy!

I make this dip a lot for family parties and it is a hit with everyone! I use it as a dip with crackers, but that adds to the carb count.  For those counting carbs it would be a great veggie dip for celery or broccoli.

Made this for Thanksgiving. The women of the family were begging for the recipe! We found monterey jack with jalepenos in it, so we used that. Even the spice-haters in the family loved it. We also used all the parmesan inside and topped off with more. Still wasn't too cheesy. 5 stars, definitely!

Tooooooo good! Toss in some roasted pine nuts for an additional taste kick. Roasted garlic cloves mashed would put this thing way over the top!

Yum, Yum, Yum!!!  I made this recipe last night for my book club, after losing my old recipe.  I'm glad I did - it was delicious!!  I did reduce the green chilies to one can and added a few sprinkles of garlic powder.  Delicious!!

Great Stuff! We loved it and I'm taking it to a pot luck tomorrow. Note: I'm always careful to pick over the artichoke hearts to make sure there are no tough leaves.

My family and friends love this dip, my Mom started making it and we all make it now.  Changes:  for a healthier recipe substitute 1 Cup of the Mayo for Greek Plain Yogurt (amazingly good) and if you want spicier, add a diced jalapeno pepper - you'll have folks asking for the recipe!

At my party my very conservative father and stepmom couldn't stop eating it for like 20 minutes. Addictive! I'm making it again this week with pepper jack cheese to add some more spice.

I have been making this recipe since my two kids were living at home. They always asked me to make it for special ocassions. Only change I make is, no pimentos added.
