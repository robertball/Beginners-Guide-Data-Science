Awesome!  I did make a couple changes to make it even healthier still!  I didn't have oat bran so I used ground flax seed.  Instead of butter I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/4 cup vanilla yogart. 3 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs.  1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I had to cook them a few minutes longer and they turned out moist and tasty!

Very good! This recipe made 24 mini and 7 regular sized muffins for me. I couldn't find oat bran in the store so I used oatmeal and it worked just fine.

We absolutely loved these muffins. So flavorful and moist! I made two small changes; I added one teaspoon of baking powder and added 1/2 cup of raisins that I "plumped up" in some unsweetened, hot chai before adding them to the batter. Out of the whole recipe, two muffins remain. Even my husband inhaled them!

Followed the recipe as is (HATE it when I read reviews of things people added, deleted or changed!  Its not the same recipe so they shouldn't review it...I digress...).  My 18 month old is SUPER picky and I'm so happy he likes these muffins.  Sneaky way to get in some veggies!  Even I like them and I hate squash and carrots!  Might try it with organic sweet potato baby food instead of the squash next time.

Thank you for this recipe!  I wanted one that was healthy enough for my tough standards as a diabetic for a quick breakfast or snack, and this was PERFECT!  I replaced the baby food squash with half a cup of pumpkin puree only because that's what I had, half the flour with whole wheat, used a little less sugar and added a few packs of Truvia sweetner and a half cup chocolate chips - have to get in those antioccidants, right?!  Anyway, these are yummy warm with butter - we heat them in the microwave cut in half and buttered - delicious!

My 2-yr old VERY picky eater loved these!  I did make a few changes.  I replaced 1 of the bananas with a 4oz. jar of spinach baby food, cut back the sugar a bit, and I couldn't find oat bran so I used Wheat Germ.  I used baby carrots, and just guessed the amount...I think I used a lot because I ended up with 48 mini muffins.  But they were great!  Baked them for about 16 min, and they turned out perfect.

I know some people don't like when people review a recipe if they didn't follow it exactly.  But I like seeing what people did and how they turned out.

OMG these things are so dang tasty!  I think my husband and I like them even more than our picky toddler!  Just be sure that your grated carrot does not exceed 1 total cup of carrot, because they will be too moist and won't cook well if you do.  And I think they taste the best when made in the mini muffin pans because the edges get really brown and it adds to the taste.  When they are hot out of the oven I can hardly stop popping them in my mouth.  This is an excellent recipe and great not only for picky toddlers but the whole family as well!

My kids loved these almost as much as I did... So moist and yummy. Definitely a new favorite!

(Used canned pumpkin, half ap/ half wheat flour, and I didn't have oat bran so I subbed 1/4 c flaxseed meal and 1/4 oatmeal. Also added 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp baking powder.)

These are amazing!! A few changes due to what I had on hand; mixed veggies instead of squash baby food, used oats instead of oat bran, and added some raisins. They are so yummy and all those veggies in there makes me feel good about giving a second one to my 3 year old. She is quite picky and ate them up.  I was even thinking adding a cream cheese frosting and sprinkles to this for a birthday treat or holiday treat. Great recipe! Thank you Lori!

Great recipe.  Can easily be modified for what one has in the house.  Both of my kids (and me!) loved them.  We ate one every day for breakfast, until they were gone, and never grew tired of them.  Very moist - my 10 mos old, could eat small bits I pinched off for him.  Here's the substitutions I've tried so far.  I used canned pumpkin puree instead of baby food.  B/c that isn't quite as liquid-y as baby food, I used only one carrot and added a small zucchini (b/c it's moist), grated.  I've also used milled flax seed instead of oat bran.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly except for using different baby food puree.  I doubled the recipe and used a jar of cinnamon sweet potato puree and a jar of squash.  They are wonderful.  My 5 year old and 2 year old loved them.  So did my husband and I.

So good! Everyone loved them and could feel good about munching them down quickly. I even made a bread loaf out of it.. but cooked it for about 50-55 minutes. Yumm!

Ehhh...I tried this recipe only substituting canned pumpkin for the squash. The mini muffins didn't really have any flavor. The butter and banana were really the only things I could taste, and even then still kind of bland. 

For fun, I tried a second batch using 1/2 c. applesauce instead of butter, 1/2c. turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar, still used canned pumpkin, 2 T. flaxseed meal, and did half the batch with craisins and half without. Thought the ones without craisins were just as bland and the ones with craisins were overpowered by the craisins. 

So, this recipe is not a keeper for me. I really like the morning glory muffins from this website. Some similar ingredients and I like the way they taste.

Fantastic healthy muffins for all ages. I found them a little greasy for my liking so will try making them with less fat next time and more pumpkin. I used 100% whole wheat flour and they turned out just great. Thanks for the recipe!

Hi Kathy, I get the oat bran at the grocery store in the cereal isle.   It's near the hot cereals.  You can also use wheat bran but I think that that is different than wheat germ.  Oh and my son is now 5 and his sister is 1 and these are still a popular treat at our house :)

Just a quick edit, kids are now 8 and 4.  I'm making the muffins today for my father in law who loves them too!

I substituted canned pumpkin for the baby food and rolled oats for the oat bran. This made about 16 muffins. My first impression was that they were ...odd? I did not like them at all when they first came out of the oven. The texture was wonderful, but the carrot was too prominent or something. I started calling them "funk muffins". My roommate loved them. I was too lazy to cook the next day and I hadn't thrown them out yet, so I tried another one.  Suddenly they were amazing. I don't know if the flavors meshed better after they sat for a while or what, but I finished off the rest of them myself over the course of two days. Go figure. I think these beat out banana bread when I have overripe bananas now.

I need to "sneak" a few vegetables and fruits into my own diet.  These muffins do the trick!  I have made them several times and even sent a batch to work with my husband.  The muffins were very well received!  I made the recipe as written the first time, and then have twice swapped pumpkin puree for the squash.  Having no children and living in a rural small town, a few eyebrows were raised when I recently bought half a dozen jars of baby food squash (it was on sale!).  I just told folks about this recipe and where to find it.  Hope they enjoy it as much as I. :)

These muffins are delicious! The name "Toddler Muffins" is a misnomer. Mommy loves them, too! Moist and just sweet enough, my 17 month old took one bite and said, "Yummmmmm!" I used a little bit of honey in addition to the brown sugar and 1/2 cup of rolled oats instead of oat bran since I didn't have that on hand. I will be making a double batch next time to have on hand in the freezer. I think you could also play around with the veggies you add. Zucchini would also be really good in them.

We have made this multiple times and they are are a huge hit from the kids to the adults.  The last time I made them I used real squash instead of baby food squash and they turned out perfect.  Making them now for a healthy camping snack.

Delicious.  Didn't have any baby food, so I used about 1 cup of left-over cooked carrots.  I added some chopped pecans, 1 tsp of baking powder and vanilla.  The muffins were moist and very flavorful.  Will definitely make these again.

I've made these four times in the last month.  I love them!  I hate to write all of my substitutions, but thought maybe it would be helpful for someone else.  I have a TON of baby food to use up and this is a great recipe for that.  I use one banana and one jar of baby food banana; one jar of squash; one jar of carrots (kids didn't like the grated carrots).  I also used 1/2 the amount of butter and one jar of applesauce (although I prefer the the taste slightly with the original amount of butter).  Also used whole wheat flour.  As another poster said, I used 1/4 c ground flax and 1/4 c baby food oatmeal instead of the oat bran.  I am tempted to try other kinds of baby food just to mix things up, but so far haven't done that.

These were really good, tasted like banana bread.  I used 4.5oz of fresh squash, rather than baby food jar.  Also ground up 1/2 oatmeal, rather than buying oat bran

I let my 5yo help me make these, all the while telling me she would not eat them because they had carrots in them. After they were done baking she asked if they still had carrots in them, then said she didn't care because they were "DEE-lish!" This is a keeper!

My little guy really liked these. I used oats instead of oat bran and applesauce instead of baby food because that's what I had. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

good recipe !  I have a hard time with people who think changing oil for butter and for sure don't eat a whole egg.
If you want to make it healthy leave out the flour.

A snack with vegetables and fruit that my 2 and 4 year old beg for?!  Amazing!  I am so happy that I found this recipe.  
I followed the recipe exacly as written, and they were delicious.  I might try replacing some of the butter with applesauce to make them even healthier.

I made them with all baby food. I used banana and strawberry, pear pineapple, mango, carrots, and squash. They turned out terrific! Everyone loved them. I did have to cook them longer but they were so yummy!

These are pretty good, and they smell great when baking. Only thing is, the directions are kind of arbitrary. Two carrots can really vary in size and affect the batter. I made twenty four minis and still had lots of batter left over, but I like this recipe. I added golden raisins and some cinnamon. Yum

These muffins were great! I liked them as well! My 13 month old loved them! She ate 2 mini muffins and reached for another! I did some minor changes because i didn't have certain ingredients.  I used cinnamon instead of the pumpkin pie spice and old fashioned oats instead of oat bran. They were delicious and I will definitely be making them again!

Mine turned out a little "chunky"...but I loved that! 
I used quick-cooking oats instead of oatbran.
I also had to substitute the baby food sqaush with another baby food vegetable blend.  
All in all, these were really, really good and I plan to make these more often in the future.

Recipe is perfect just the way it is, but next time I may try using half the butter and adding 1/2 cup applesauce. I also stuck the carrots in the food processor with the bananas to make for quicker "mashing"! I usually don't expect a recipe to turn out perfectly the first time, but this one did! My husband, toddler, and I all LOVE the results (half of them were gone within 30 minutes!) I can't wait to make these for my toddler's Mother's Day Out class for snack.

Yes, babies LOVE these!  I subbed grated zucchini for the jar of squash, used half white flour and half wheat, used half whole oats and half ground flaxseed.  Second time I made them, they turned out too wet even with extra oven time - probably used too much zucchini - and they're still super yummy.

Fabulous.  My two year old and my hubby raved about them.  I substituted canned pumpkin for squash since I had some leftover from another recipe and swapped whole oats for oat bran.

Awesome recipe! My son is a very picker eater (3 y.o) but has been requesting muffins lately. I made the recipe almost exact except I didn't have oat bran so I used instead 1/4 cup of oatmeal and 1/4 ground flaxseed. Absolutely delicious. I plan on making a huge batch to keep in the freezer.

My toddler likes these.  I heat up a sweet potato in the microwave to soften and throw that in.  I shred zucchini and carrots and add ground flax.  I think they are pretty tasty, too.

These are great!!! My stubborn 5yr old who refuses to eat vegetable LOVES these and has no clue they are packed with veggies!!!! I do recommend not using the baby food the recipe calls for, I purée real veggies and use that instead. It's more healthy and it's the real deal, not some processed shelf baby food. I take 1 raw yellow squash & 1 raw zucchini (with skin) and purée it in my food processor, that replaces the baby food (granted it's allot more than the 1 container it calls for, but It doesn't mess up the texture or the taste of the muffins) then I continue on with the recipe as it calls for...bananas, carrots, ect. They take more like 18-21 mins to cook and I make sure they cool on a baking rake due to being very moist cause of the extra veggies I put in them. I highly recommend these!!!!

My twin one-year olds eat these yummy muffins every single morning. I expect muffin to be among their first words. I use canned pumpkin instead of baby food squash, ground old fashioned oatmeal instead of oat bran, and I cut the butter in half and replace with 1/4 cup of applesauce.

Just made these muffins, in hopes that my 18 month old son will enjoy them in the morning! I just ate a mini and it was delicious ;] I made a few small changes:
Rather then 1c flour- 3/4c flour & 1/4 wheat germ [plus a tablespoon or so for consistency]
I added about 3/4c mashed sweet potatoes
I added a handful of rasins
I added chipped pecans, approx. 1/8c. just sprinkled in
Rather than pumpkin pie spice, which I do no have, I used cloves, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom 
These things are SOOOO moist!

Substituted oatmeal for oat bran and grated a whole small zucchini in place of baby food. Turned out well and made 24 mini muffins, and 6 small regular muffins! My 2 year old announced "cake!" And ate one right away!

My 1 year old LOVES these muffins. I bake them as mini muffins and he eats 3 to 4 at a sitting. When he's teething, they provide great relief when they are frozen. To help increase his protein intake, I've substituted a jar of turkey and vegetables baby food for the squash - I couldn't even tell the difference! Going to try with a jar of chicken and broth and see what happens.

OMG. My grandson has been loving these muffins for several months now. They are absolutely wonderful as the recipe is written, and I have made a couple of variations as others have suggested with much success. The best thing about this recipe is how well they freeze - I let them cool completely for at least an hour before storing them in a gallon ziploc bag and place them in the freezer. My 18 month old grandson calls them "muffies" and - seriously - takes a bite and closes his eyes in pure bliss and says "mmmmmmmmm!" Thank you, Lori!

I added 1 tsp. baking powder, and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  They turned out so good. They were nicely fluffy and not dense and heavy like some muffins are.  They had just the right amount of sweetness, too.  Tomorrow I'll see if my picky grand-toddlers will
like them. Thanks for this recipe.

Mmmmm, excellent just as is.  Also works without squash baby food.  My 2 yr old loves them, and so do I!  BTW the pumpkin pie spice I used  is 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  Tastes great!

I went by the recipe exactly, and these turned out really well. Sort of a cross between pumpkin and banana bread. Can't taste the veggies at all. My cooking time was more like 10-12 minutes for the mini muffin pan... and it made closer to 42 mini muffins rather than 24. (Score!) I will for sure be making these again.

Very good.  I had to use what I had on hand, so that was carrot baby food (2 3.5 containers) wheat germ instead of oat bran and cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice.  Also added a 1/2 tsp baking powder and no carrots because I only had baby carrots and I wasn't sure how many I would have to shred to equal 2 carrots.

Made a batch of these simple muffins for my two VERY picky eaters. All three of us LOVE them! So moist, so flavorful. The recipe is perfect as written. I made a batch following the recipe exactly (except I did blend up 1/2 cup of oatmeal because I forgot to get the oat bran, but I'll just do that every time b/c it's what I would regularly have on hand) yesterday. And then today, since we loved them so much, I made another batch, this time subbing the butter with vanilla yogurt. They just came out of the oven. They haven't even had time to cool yet, but I just ate one and it tasted just as good, only is probably way more moist. It will probably still work for me though.

my 3 kids love these. they are 5, 3, and 1. my 3 year old eats almost nothing, especially veggies so these are a wonderful way to sneak them in. i made one change. i realized after i started making them that i didnt have any pumpkin pie spice so i used apple pie spice. still came out great. ! Thanks for the recipe!

Great muffins! Easy way to sneak veggies into food. I also used oatmeal instead of oat bran.

Wow! These are really yummy. What a great way to sneak some orange veggies into a family friendly breakfast or snack. We liked them so much I made a double batch the next day to freeze. These make wonderful snacks to send to school with the kids.

Awesome & super moist as everyone else says. I used a little less butter & brown sugar & substituted whole wheat flour & sweet potato & chicken baby food (all had in cupboard) & turned out great. Made mini-muffins & baked for 20 min & still could have left in few notes longer.

These were REALLY REALLY good! So moist and delicious.  My kids really enjoyed them for breakfast with a glass of milk or kefir. And they didn't even suspect there was anything "yucky" (i.e. healthy) in them.  : )  My husband and I liked them too.
Great recipe!

These were delicious.  I substituted 1/2 C of pumpkin puree for the squash baby food.  Also, I used flax seed instead of oat bran and added some sweetened coconut.  Will make again for sure.

My 15-month old loved these.  I used a jar of sweet potatoes instead of squash (I didn't have squash), rolled oats (didn't have oat bran), and Allspice (didn't have pumpkin pie spice).  We'll make these again!

My kids love these, and I don't think they're bad either. I used frozen pumpkin puree, ground up oats since I didn't have oat bran, and I threw in some raisins. Doubled the recipe and made 24 muffins, 24 mini-muffins and a mini loaf of bread.

These are fantastic, moist and hearty. Not only did our baby gobble them up, but so did picky older siblings. It's a breakfast or snack I can feel good about offering. I also enjoyed one (ok, 3!) myself with a cup of coffee.

These are pretty tasty!  I made some changes as I didn't have all the ingredients.  I put some oats in the food professor to substitute for oatbran. I didn't have squash baby food so used some applesauce and some squash/carror/chickpea toddler mush that I had on hand.  Also made my own pumpkin spice.  My toddler enjoyed making them and eating them.

I make these all the time and freeze them for my 2 year old son.  in the morning I wet a paper towel, wring it out and wrap muffins in it and heat in the microwave for 30 seconds.  easy healthy breakfast!  He loves them so much he asks for muffins several times a day.

Great recipe. I tripled the recipe, worked fine.  Used my own frozen pumpkin, added some raisins and chopped walnuts.  I did not have oat brand so I added more flour. I left out the salt.  Baked for about 22 minutes.

Terrific recipe and my toddler loves them! I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned squash and like someone else here replaced the oat bran with oatmeal and worked great. Think I'll add raisins next time.

These muffins are great!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of baking powder as I noticed others suggesting in previous reviews.  I cannot believe how awesome these are!  My picky toddler will love them!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

My two year old granddaughter and I have made these twice.  She is an extremely fussy eater and LOVES these.  It might be that I let her help me mix them, but she asks for more!!!  Incredible!  I admit to using quinoa instead of bran and squashed fresh peach instead of squash.  Great recipe!

LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!! I've made these 4 or 5 times now and my kids go ga-ga for them! I've only used the baby food squash once, the rest of the times I've just puréed my own squash, I can't tell the difference. I highly recommend this recipe especially if you have kids who aren't so great at eating breakfast before school! My 5 year old is always up for a "toddler muffin" no matter how early it is!!!

I've made this recipe countless times now, and like to double it, giving me 18 medium-sized muffins. I use baked butternut squash, and like to add raisins or cranberries. My 2 1/2 year old son loves them.

These are so good!  I couldn't find oat bran so I instead used regular oats and also subbed 1/4 cup ground flaxseed for 1/4 of the flour.  Sweet enough to keep the kids happy and healthy enough to keep momma happy!

Delicious!  These were just wonderful straight out of the oven.  I look forward to trying different variations in the future.  The flavor of bananas really dominates the original recipe, which is fine if you want to "mask" the other vegetables.  I might double up the squash and carrots next time, since they were totally obscured by the banana in the original ratios.  And next time I plan to add dried cranberries.  Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe! Muffins were moist, sweet enough and I love that they are good for you too!! Plus, they were kid-approved! I made them exactly like the recipe states. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I am not a fan of the little crunches the oat bran added but that is something I can easily get past. lol My 4 yr old even helped me make them and after he ate one he told me, "Thank you for adding the carrots mom! They are yummy!"

I have made these muffins several times and they always come out delicious! My 2 little ones gobble them up! I even subbed avocado for the butter this last time and really enjoyed the smooth richness. We also usually double the pumpkin pie spice and add 1 tsp of ginger. Using whole wheat flour works well, too and I imagine that there are several gluten free 'flours' that would do just fine.

My 4 year old daughter will not eat veggies at all. This recipe was an excellent idea to help her get her veggies intake for the day. She eats them like they are candy. I also have been playing around with the recipe and have added some vanilla extract and some shredded zucchini. When I don't have bananas I have also added pureed pears or apple sauce. I also decided to try it with 3/4 cup wheat flower with 1/4 white. 3 out of 4 of my kids LOVE these. Thanks for the recipe!!

My super picky 3-year-old has loved these muffins as long as she has been able to eat them.  They are relatively easy, although I had to search for the oat bran at first (ended up finding it at Whole Foods, where you can buy as much or as little as you need).  I make a double batch and then portion them out and freeze them in ziploc baggies.  They defrost great and taste like fresh-baked.  Excellent recipe!

I made these muffins for my 17 month old who is pretty picky when it comes to muffins. He LOVES them! I tried one and they are pretty good! You really don't taste veggies. I did use Greek yogurt in place of the 1/2 cup of butter though, because I try to keep everything as healthy as possible.

Delicious!  I added more spice because I always wish for more; added about 1/3 more of same spice.  Only had 1 banana so I added a little buttermilk to maintain the moistness of the original recipe.  Used pureed pumpkin instead of squash.  Otherwise exactly as written.  Love them!  Husband loves them!  Five-year-old grandson LOVES them!  Nice idea to make them mini and freeze.  I love hearing from people on how they do things.  Enriches my own life!  THANK YOU for this recipe!

Made it this morning. Used oats instead of oat bran. My daughter loves them. It made 24 mini muffins and 6 small "regular-sized" muffins. The muffins came out much better in greased pans as opposed to paper-lined pans. Next time I'll skip the papers.

I made these with oatmeal instead of oat bran only because I didn't have any.  They were amazing.  I can't wait to buy some oat bran to make them again!  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

These were delicious & very moist!!  For the sugar I used 1/4cup applesauce & 1/4cup brown sugar.  I also used gluten-free oatmeal for the oat bran and gluten-free flour.  I didn't have any pumpkin spice so I substituted cinnamon.  My squash puree that I used from my freezer had some sweet potato and apple in it, too.  My toddler didn't like them but she's in a picky phase.  My husband and I gobbled them up!!  I will definitely make these again!  Yum!

My 2 year old LOVED these muffins.  He ate almost 3 muffins in about 30 minutes.  I know he was stuffed and was still asking for more.

I used 1/2 can of pumpkin instead of squash because it was available and used whole wheat flour (and no all purpose flour).  I did have a to cook a bit longer (maybe 25 minutes), but still amazing.  These are a must try for anyone with a picky toddler.  Thank you for this recipe!

My 14-month-old loves these! I used muffin cups, which was a bit of a mistake since the muffins don't have enough fat in them to peel off of the paper. I also substituted a container of applesauce for one of the bananas since I only had one banana and they still turned out well.

Delish! I cut the butter and added in apple sauce. Also increased the pumpkin pie spice slightly. My toddler daughter has been asking me to bake muffins and I feel,good about serving her these.

Delicious! Added some flaxseed for omega 3 fat and used grated zucchini instead of baby food squash because I had fresh zucchini to use. Even our picky teenager said these were great (high praise). Thanks!

Pretty tasty and I feel great about cutting small pieces of this to give to my 10 month old as he's eating finger foods! A side note, this recipe made 48 mini muffins for me, not 24 like the recipe says.  Oh well - more for the freezer!

I have tried so hard to find a healthy muffin recipe that my daughter actually likes and doesn't taste like complete garbage and as stiff as a rock. This recipe is fantastic. Perfect consistency, not too dry or hard. The flavor is great. It's not overly sweet, or overly bland/healthy tasting. And the best part was I didn't have to tweak a single part of the recipe. I am making these again for my daughter. She loves them. You can freeze the extras too! My daughter loved them just as much after a couple months being frozen.

I didn’t have all items on hand but used a 4 oz veggie pouch instead of the baby food and instant brown sugar oatmeal packs for the oats, reduced the brown sugar. They turned out more like a zucchini bread muffing but I liked them. Turned out very tasty and 3yo twins loved them!

Excellent for you and absolutely delicious! I have a supper picky toddler who refuses to eat anything green. I didn’t have oat bran or carrots, so I used chopped quaker oats and Gerber’s squash purée, and the pea, carrot, spinach purée from Gerber. I will definitely be making these from now on. Many thanks from one thankful momma!

So I did a few alterations based on what I had on hand.  For half of the flour, I used whole wheat flour and flax seed in place of the oat bran. I also used 1 tsp baking powder and threw in half cup raisins. After cooling completely, I stored them in foil and this morning they were moist and delicious! Definitely a keeper with only 1/2 cup brown sugar in entire batch! My 2 year old grandson loves them!

We did this with my 12 year old son. I substituted oat bran with oatmeal and pumpkin spice with cinnamon as we were missing those ingredients. We also added 1/4 cup chocolate chips. It turned delicious and made 12 regular size muffins.

5 stars for taste (not very sweet at all, which I liked) and minus 1 star for the greasy mess it made. Next time, I'll halve the butter OR use canola oil or vegetable oil.  I'd increase the spice, too. The butter oozed out of the muffin and seeped into the muffin tin, making all of the bottoms wet and drippy. I had oat bran cereal and used that. I'd recommend letting the muffins sit for a few minutes before putting them into the oven so that it can hydrate.  Thanks for a tasty treat!

Delicious and moist recipe. Subs: used 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 1 tsp if chia seeds, 1 cup of wheat flour and half cup of regular oats, 1/8 cup of maple syrup and didn’t have pumpkin on hand so just used a carrot apple food pouch instead.  Baked for 20min

I loved these! My picky eating grandson ate 3 of them. I added 1 tsp of vanilla only because I add vanilla to everything. I can see how you could experiment using different kinds of fruits and veggies, but the recipe as is, is great!

Awesome muffins! For the record, I love when other reviewers post variations. As some have allergies or an intolerance to certain ingredients, variations give options! I take it as a compliment when people improve on my recipes to their liking! Thanks for the recipe!

I just made th we muffins for my picky 3 and 4 year old. They’re DELICIOUS!!! So much so that I’m going to make a gluten-free version for myself. Definitely a new family favourite. And perfect timing with the start of school (great addition to school lunch).

Love these muffins. I've been making them ever since my daughters were babies. Now I make them for a healthy breakfast "treat" for rushed school mornings. I love them too and I'm celiac, so I substitute Bob's Red Mill Gluten free Baking Flour 1:1, equal parts and they come out great.

These are great! I didn’t have the baby food or oat bran so I subbed applesauce and ground oats. I have no toddlers but they were a hit with my 13 year old and my 6 year old and my husband said they were possibly the best muffins he’s ever had. He said it wasn’t really the flavor (which was very good) but that they were perfectly moist and a great texture.

Great recipe. Very versatile.  Sometimes I throw in apple or mashed sweet potato instead of the squash and we like to add raisins and walnuts pieces to it as well.  My hubby loves these

These are soooo good! I used whole wheat flour and I only had 1 banana so I used a jar of strawberry banana baby food along with the squash. I also didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp all spice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I didn't have enough butter so I used 1/2 coconut oil. They came out great and my 11 month old gobbles them up!! Anything to get veggies in him!!

Followed the recipe. Tastes like banana bread to me, which is OK, but wanted more than banana flavor. Next time ill only use 1 banana and more of the carrots and squash.

I did end up making changes. I didn't have enough squash, so I used pumpkin puree instead, which I weighed. I thought I had oat bran, but what I ended up having was wheat bran so I looked up substitutions and used oatmeal instead...aaaaand I had EXPIRED pumpkin pie spice so I researched how to make that and THANK GOD I actually had the ingredients for that. Luckily for me, the chickens laid enough eggs. These came out moist and flavorful. I weighed the bananas too, which were baby bananas and they came to about 9.8 oz. I forgot to weigh the carrots because I was SO frustrated at a family member for using the grater to make homemade soap and they ruined the grater so I had to use the carrot peeler to slice the carrots and then the hand chopper to chop the slices to bits. In the end they came out YUMMY and beautiful... a little flat but, my toddler ate them. She even ate Gramma's when she wasn't looking. WE WILL be making these again.

Excellent! Followed the recipe pretty exact. I couldn't find oat bran so I substituted with just oats as others have done. Also used 1/2 pumpkin baby food and 1/2 squash baby food rather than just squash baby food. My two toddlers gobbled three up within the hour. Husband and I also enjoyed them! I will be making a few batches of these for my son's class for his birthday! Thanks for the great recipe!,

I loved it. They were pretty tasty, which I was skeptical of, and I liked them. my one year old niece ate an entire full size muffin in one sitting she loved them so much. I made them exactly as the recipe states except I used a 4oz jar of baby food, and a bit more brown sugar than called for.

Very tasty but could definitely cut back on the sugar by half at least. Also would consider avocado instead of butter for this recipe in the future to make it healthier. Little one will love these I'm sure!

I made these for my 10 month old with a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand. I only had one banana so I added more pumpkin and no oat bran so I used 1/4c flax and 1/4c oats. They turned out great and she loves them (although she eats anything)! Makes me feel better giving these to her with breakfast or as snacks than most muffin recipes that call for 4x as much sugar! Plus you get the extra fruits and veggies! Mom win!

Very very good!  I made for a non veggie eating 16 month old.  She didn't hesitate to eat it and as a  adult I liked it too.

My 4-year old daughter and I have been making these muffins for a couple of years now. They are so good and simple enough that she can help out with the bonus of being semi healthy. We've followed the recipe exactly, exchanged out the bananas and squash for applesauce, pumpkin, sweet potato, etc, used flax meal or oatmeal instead of oat bran, and replaced butter with coconut oil....all with good results. We tend to add an additional 1/2 tsp or so of cinnamon and about a tsp of vanilla just out of personal preference. Thank you for this household staple!

These are so good! I just made a batch for our road trip tomorrow. The baby is asleep and my husband and I just scarfed down three of these lol. I tried another kid-friendly muffin on this site and it was way too sweet and greasy. But these were awesome! Thanks for a great recipe for my little one (and me)!

Best recipe I've tried on AllRecipes and only one I've ever reviewed! I only gave it 4 stars for "as written" as I made the following alterations to make this the perfect healthy snack for my family: Subbed Whole Wheat flour for all of the all purpose flour. Subbed 1/4 c apple sauce for 1/2 the butter, and 1/4 c honey for 1/4 the sugar (though next time will try a complete 1:1 substitution). Also subbed 1/2 a can of pumpkin (about 7 oz total) for the baby food, and cinnamon for the pumpkin pie spice.  The flavors were PERFECT and my toddler can't get enough of them! I feel good about feeding them to him for breakfast or as an on-the-go snack, as they are packed full of good-for-you ingredients.  AND I love them too! The recipe made 24 high-rising mini muffins plus 4 regular size muffins. I will make these again and again!

Love love.  Toddler loved it and they freeze well! I still make them occasionally even though toddler no longer, now a 6 year old.  I normally use less sugar and butter than the receipe calls out and I add apple sauce or butter squash sauce to soften it up since I use less butter. I even added moderate ground up flaxseeds.  Always turns out fluffy and hearty.

Made this recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out great — 24 reasonably healthy mini muffins that my 1-year-old loves. I'll definitely make this again.

Very good muffin. I used carrot puree and butternut squash puree and added chocolate chips to mask that they are a healthy muffin. Yummy!

Good recipe. Make sure that the butter is at room temperature or the texture of the muffins will not be homogeneous. Great flavour. My kids love them! A keeper.

I made this twice and it turned out great each time. The only thing I changed was I used oatmeal instead of oat bran because I didn't have any. (Oh, and the second time I used part oatmeal, part flax seed, but I think I liked the plain oatmeal better.) The first time, I used paper cupcake liners, but that didn't work very well because the bottom of the muffins came out too soggy. The next time I just greased the muffin tin with great results. I think you could definitely cut down on the sugar, especially if your bananas are ripe. I froze the second batch of these, and they freeze and reheat great. Perfect for a quick morning breakfast.

My 1 year old loved this!  I used wheat germ instead of oats bc she has an oat sensitivity and used pumpkin instead of squash (both per different reviews).  She ate the whole, regular-sized muffin!  Will def make again.

I made these all the time when I worked as a nanny for a family full of extremely picky eaters. Each batch I made was gone in no time, and their mother was happy that they were more nutritional than most other baked goods. Followed the recipe exactly.

I had some cooked butternut squash in the fridge - so I just scooped a bunch into the batter. I also blanch greens, blend them smooth & freeze into icecubes. I add 1 green icecube too. My kids devoured these!!! Thank you!

Yum! My toddler loved these, and so did everyone else. We're low cholesterol, so I made these with oil, egg whites, and whole wheat flour. I also subbed 1/4 c acorn squash for the baby food and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. They are delicious.

I will definately make these muffins over and over!  The original recipe was delicious, the second time I added grated zuccinni just to up the vegetable intake, and didn't have oat bran so had to replace with hemp hearts.  Upped the healthiness and tasted equally as awesome!

These are a HUGE hit!! I always have to make a double batch because not only do my 18 month old and 4 year old devour these, so do my adult children! I only alter the recipe  by using ground flax instead of the oat bran, and i usually use at least 2 more carrots than it calls for. I use the organic rainbow carrots and I chop them up fine in my Nutribullet. These are AMAZING!! 
(These are easy to make all organic if your into that thing :)

These are a HUGE hit with me and a picky 4 year old! I used a zucchini and a carrot instead of 2 carrots and I use steelcut oatmeal since we don't have oat bran. I also make normal sized muffins rather than mini ones! Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly when I make them for the 4 year old. When I make them for myself, I make a few changes to make them a little healthier, ex. substitute greek yogurt and peanut butter for the butter, take out the brown sugar, etc. These muffins are really easy to adapt for different tastes, LOVE them!

Love it! The only change I made was using cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice. I did use thawed frozen bananas and the result was fine. Next time I will cut the spice to about 3/4 t. They only took 10 minutes in my oven and this recipe made 36 mini muffins. I filled the cups very close to the top and they didn't over-flow. 15-month old approved!

Loved this recipe and so did my kids.  I made a few substitutions though due to what I had on hand. I put in an apple in place of the squash and pureed it with a bag of baby carrots.  I used whole wheat flour instead of oatbran, and all spice instead of pumpkin pie spice.  I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and nutmeg as well.

Hi, these are delicious... The only differences I made were using coconut oil in place of the butter, rolled oats instead of oat bran, baby carrots instead of regular carrots, and pear/mango canned baby food because I didn't have squash. They are so moist and definitely deserve a 5 star rating! Thanks for the recipe

I made these for a trip down to the Kentucky Derby for the guys to have something to munch on.  They loved them!  The texture was nice and they were super moist.  I made as written only baking them in mini muffin pans.  This made a great size for the guys to pop in their mouth without making a mess in the car.  I would definitely make these again.

I added cocoa powder, a handful of chocolate chips, some agave syrup, only one banana, 1 container of babyhood squash, 1 container of babyhood green veggies, and 1/3c of ground carrots and spinach and it really tasted good.  If it is at all bland, I dab a bit of butter on the warm muffin and everyone eats them up. Next time I will try pumpkin and/or peanut butter as well as a ton of veggies.

Thanks for this great recipe! I have a crazy 2 year old that won't touch fruits and vegetables. I tried to get nutrition into him with smoothies at first on the recommendation of my pediatrician. Somehow he always knew what was in there and refused to drink them. Then, I came upon this recipe, and everything changed! He loves these and gobbles them up. I changed some things. I made sure I used the fine part of my grater. He would notice bigger chunks of carrots?? I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the butter. Green vegetables are the hardest for me to get him to eat, so I used an asparagus/pea medley. I was a little worried that the taste might come through with my baby food choice, but they tasted great! I used all whole wheat flour and Stevia baking blend instead of sugar. Wonderful!

Love all the nutritious ingredients in these muffins and they taste great too.  Tried these for my daughter at 1 year, she didn't care for them so I froze them and tried them a few weeks later.  She likes them now :)

I love this recipe! I use it with my one year-old who hates to eat vegetables. They usually end up on the floor. I change this recipe a little bit by adding shredded zucchini and walnuts and raisins and substituting half whole wheat flour for regular flour. What I love about this recipe is that it's versatile and you can add things or take away and see how it works! My one and four-year-old both love them and I think they're pretty good too :-)

These should be called family muffins, it wasn't only the toddlers who loved them!
They were moist and delicious and healthy too.
I didn't have baby food so substituted applesauce. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. 
Highly recommended!

Substituted canned pumpkin as I didn't have baby food.  Very nice, subtle flavours.  All of the kids enjoyed them.

A hit in my house hold, I also tried it with the pumpkin instead of the squash and it is just much better with the squash they kids eat them faster when it is squash, thank you for helping me hide those great things my little guy will not eat.

This is a great recipe. It is very adaptable to what you have. For instance, I didn't have squash baby food but had carrot. Since I used carrot already, I used minced apples instead of carrots. And I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flower. They were awesome. Next time I will try then with a little less butter.

I've made at least 5 batches of these muffins for my baby.  I make my own squash puree so I'm not really sure if I'm using the suggested amount.  I substitute quick oaks for oat bran and zuchinni for carrot (I've tried carrot but I like it with zuchinni better.)  I also use whole wheat flour.  My baby loves these so much.  I started giving them to him at 12 months old for breakfast.  I recommend letting them cool to room temperature before freezing but they freeze very well.  Just defrost in the microwave for 20 seconds for a mini muffin or 40 seconds for a full sized muffin.

Everyone in my house from hubby, 15 year old, to 11 month old gave these a thumbs up! I used wheat bran in place of oat bran and pureed baby sweet potatoes in place of the squash since that's what I had and otherwise followed recipe exactly. These are awesome! My husband, son, and I almost ate half of these fresh out of the oven... oops. I put half of what was left in the freezer, and saved the rest out for everyone to enjoy. My daughter ate one of these up with her dinner and really seemed to enjoy it!

My picky toddlers approve! Very moist and tasty. Froze them and reheated in microwave for about 30 seconds and tasted like they just came out of the oven. Used wheat germ, in place if oat bran.

This is a simple and quick recipe that my toddler loved helping me make and eat! All I had was baby carrots so I measured out 2/3 cup grated and it was perfect. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted cinnamon. They tasted great, but I do want to try them with the pumpkin flavor.

Fantastic recipe!
I have made these over and over again for my 1 year-old.  My older kids love them too.  They are terrific without any changes, but I have substituted many times according to what I had on hand, and they always turn out perfectly.  A few subs I've made: for the bananas/squash/carrots- any equivalent quantity of boiled and mashed carrots/butternut squash, for the oat bran- wheat bran.

Pretty tasty, even for grownups.  Nice texture, too.  I added more spice, as I do with most muffin or other recipes, especially when they are healthy and relatively low sugar.

Not the easiest recipe with all the different ingredients.  I used organic frozen squash grated organic carrots, and mashed organic bananas, which added to the difficulty.  Pregrated and mashed food would have lessened the time.  I also used all other organic items so my kiddo could eat mommy-guilt-free.

My young girls love these every time! Instead of baby food I use applesauce. It works great. Sometimes I will throw in zucchini as well. And I have also added ground flax seed. They think these are a treat so it works out well to throw in anything healthy.

Really yummy little muffins! Wanted a treat for my little guy feeling under the weather, and these really did the trick. Great flavor with the pumpkin pie spice and jam packed with fruit and veggies! My husband and I did them too. Awesome, homemade, healthy snack.

My toddler has a true food aversion due to medical issues, and he gobbled these down (so did I).  The only changes I made were based on what I had in my pantry; I used oatmeal instead of oat bran, and I didn't have pumpkin spice so I used a few dashes of cinnamon and a dash of cloves. Thanks for this recipe--it was wonderful to see my toddler happily eating.

Just made these for my 2yr old and he loves them. I wanted something packed with veggies that I could send in his lunch for preschool that he would actually eat. They just cooled and he's already eaten 5 of them in 5 min. I love that you can freeze them for later!

I didn't have exactly what recipe called for, but even with a few substitutions, they still came out perfectly moist and delicious! I subbed coconut oil for butter, sweet potatoes for squash and used wheat germ instead of oat bran.  Upped brown sugar to 2/3 C. Baked mini muffins for 15 minutes.... Perfect and yummy!

So good, and perfect for quick breakfast. I have a hard time getting my 8 year old to eat in the morning. At least if she just has one or two of these I'll know she's getting lots of good stuff. Also perfect for resisting the drive through temptation. 

I used quick oats instead of bran because I didn't want to but something I know I wouldn't use for any thing else.

I, personally, did not love them, but my toddler always gobbles them down (veggies and all!)  And so does every other toddler I have ever fed them to.  So, since they ARE toddler muffins and toddlers love them, they deserve 5 stars :)

Great recipe!  I used ground flax instead of  oat bran because its what I had on hand, and used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2.   Very moist, and my two year old and I really like them.   My husband says they don't have a lot of flavor though.  I would have given five stars except for his comment.

LOVED these!  We all liked them - adults and a picky 18 month old!  We used the full amount of sugar but will cut that back next time.  We also used the pulp from some carrot/apple juice instead of the grated carrots but it worked perfect.  Didn't have the baby food so just left that out.  They were still perfect though!  I think we'll have to try some variations based on this recipe next.  So excited to find a healthy muffin (with veggies!) that we all love!

If I could rate it 10 STARS I would. I make double batches of these almost weekly. Hubby LOVES...LOVES...LOVES these muffins.
Only thing I do is add more carrots to it, more fiber one original cereal & more bananas and I have to add pecans and or English walnuts Some times I add both types of nuts together.

Thank you for this recipe...
Everyone LOVES them in our family & that includes Friends
If my Brother loves them that would be a miracle. He has to have icing & all the ooey gooey bad sugary stuff to it NOT THESE. YEA !!!

THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Made this for my veggie-hating toddler, and unfortunately they were not a hit.  I have to agree with him.  Quite dense and not a very nice flavor.

My daughter loved this recipe.  I did switch 1/4 c of yogurt and 1/4 c of oil for the butter and I pureed 1 zucchini cut into chunks with a teaspoon of water in place of the jar of baby food.  I actually ran the carrots and banana through the food processor as well.  I don't feel guilty now when she would rather have a muffin instead of dinner because it is packed with fruits and veggies.  I wonder if it would work as well with other vegetables like broccoli?  
Thank you for this recipe!

Very tasty! My son wolfed it down. Next time I might try adding zucchini instead of carrots. Great recipe! Thanks for helping me sneak some veggies into my boy's diet!

Wow! My six year old helped me make these and says he can't stop eating them because they are so good! Made exactly as written except with quick oats instead of oat bran.

These are great.  I've followed the recipe exactly as well as changed it up for what I have on hand and it has always been a hit.  Adults love them just as much as the little ones.  I like to keep a few jars of banana baby food on hand for times when I don't have enough ripe bananas.

I just made these and my 19 month old loves them! Neither of us likes a lot of spice so I cut the pumpkin pie spice amount in half. I also replaced the oat bran with quick cook oats and it turned out great. They are light, fluffy, and not too sweet.

These were awesome!  The only change I made was that I used fresh pureed butternut squash instead of the jar of baby food. I also added 2 TBS of milled flax seed. They were so moist it was amazing.  My 2 year old loved them and kept asking for more "cupcakes" because they were so tasty.  The only problem I had was that I liked them so much too I kept going back to eat more!  I am going to make them again today and expand it a bit more by adding some zucchini as well.

Great start but I made a few changes. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of butter. I didn't have enough bananas so I used one banana and another 1/4 cup applesauce. I had wheat bran at home so I used that instead of oatbran. I also used whole wheat flour to make them a little healthier. I also added a little extra pumpkin pie spice due to the fact my daughter likes things zippy. My 21 month old daughter couldn't shove them in her mouth fast enough and quickly asked for more:)The changes in the recipe also added an extra 12 muffins to the recipe which obviously was a bonus.

Just made these as we have a potlach at daycare tomorrow - substituted canned baby blueberry dessert (blueberries and some brown suger) for the squash. They turned out delicious - moist & tasty! I think the kiddos will love them!!

These were moist and fluffy -- but too salty for my liking.  I think the salt could easily be halved in this recipe.  I used 6oz of pureed squash and about a cup of chopped steamed carrots (I was using up our existing stash of freezer baby food) with mashed bananas.  Baby boy was interested for a few minutes, so that's always a win.

Didn't use the squash as I didn't have any in hand. Added another carrot and used All Bran instead of oat bran.
Came out perfect. My 17mth old can't get enough of it.

I found this recipe and promptly went to the kitchen. My 11month old has become a picky eater already (though I don't blame him being sick of "baby mush"). The only thing he will consume is smoothies, and I really wanted him to eat something "solid" again. These yummy muffins, which yielded 3 dozen mini muffins for me, did the trick! I didn't have any squash, so I substituted a 128ml packet of HEINZ baby food in "pear green bean mango" flavor in order to still pack in the veggie matter. I also had no oat bran, so replaced that with toasted milled flax. They still turned out delicious and moist. Thank you for sharing!

Gluten free and egg free version: I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the 2 eggs, and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup. I also used Cup 4 Cup brand gluten free flour instead of all purpose flour. I Replaced oat bran with more g-free flour, to eliminate aftertaste. I chopped carrots instead of shredding (easier). Forgot to put the squash in. Used 1 1/2 " scoop, which made 18 muffins. They were very good before changes, and even tastier after changes

Made this two weeks ago. My entire family LOVED these muffins. They tasted like banana bread! Will be making more to stock in the freezer! Thanks for the great and healthy recipe. I plan on trying half whole wheat flour the next time I make these just to see if it's noticeable.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. They smelled good while they were cooking, but they tasted like carrots and squash with a hint of pumpkin pie spice.

Yummy!  I had to use zucchini instead of carrots because my carrots were bad and I couldn't find pumpkin pie spice so I used pumpkin pie filling.  Was delicious!

I made this recipe for my very picky toddler and she loves them. She thinks they are cupcakes and eats them easily, licking her fingers even. Note that they are very soft when they come out of the oven (may be different if using oat bran, I only had wheat bran on hand and used that) and taste the best if kept in the refrigerator and eaten the next day.

Super-easy, super-delish!  Made according to recipe, with the exception of needing to replace squash with canned pumpkin puree, as that's what was on hand, and we didn't want to wait to make these. :o)  These are TeRriFiC!  Topped a few with chopped toasted pecans we had on hand, and LOVED THAT!  

Will definitely make these often.  Will incorporate nuts into them, or sprinkle on top, as our family loves that nutty flavor & crunch.  Will add soaked raisins sometimes, just because we like them.  These muffins were great as written, though.  The recipe variation is just because of family likes.  Will try w/cranberries, as commented by another - sounds like a nice twist!

SO glad to add these to our breakfast/snack choices!

These muffins are delicious!  Just made my 2nd batch  in 24 hours!  My 11 month old loves them...And so does my husband.  I made mini muffins for my baby to freeze and big ones for my husband and I.  The only alteration I made was cutting the sugar in half.  Yum!  Such a great muffin!

They're gone in 2 days! Made two small changes - didn't have oat bran so used just regular oatmeal instead and used 1/2c pumpkin instead of squash since my kids are waaayyy past the baby food stage.  All 5 in my house from 20 months to 32 years loved them and because they're relatively healthy, quick, easy and made with 'everyday' ingredients this will become a regular in my kitchen!

These are delicious!  I have to admit...I'm not the healthiest adult, so stealing a couple from my kids on the way out the door could very well be my way to sneak a little fruit & veggie into my diet too:)
