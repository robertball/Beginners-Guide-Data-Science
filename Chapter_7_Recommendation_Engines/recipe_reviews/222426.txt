Good base but needed some tweaking. I'm a Bulldog Tonkatsu Sauce fan. My next batch, I think I will use 3/4 c. ketchup and 1/4 c. either apricot or plum puree.

I made my first batch last night on a whim.  I didn't have dry sherry so substituted apple cider vinegar.  It was hard to leave it sitting for an hour for the flavors to meld because the first taste after stirring/heating was really good!  This is a definite keeper!  I might try adding additional ground ginger or a dash of hot sauce/ground cayenne next time for a little more zip.

Lucy you hit the ball out of the park with this ton katsu sauce - better than the rather expensive Japanese bottled version.  Thanks!

I've never had Tonkatsu before, and this recipe isn't going to make me want to try it again. I suppose I'm just not a Tonkatsu fan, however, DH liked it, so it didn't go to waste.  I served it with Katsu Chicken, jasmine rice, and steamed broccoli. Overall,  it wasn't inedible,  but nothing I'll be trying again soon.

Made it twice now, first go was following the  recipe and having no more wine left made a batch with a sweet Sake and I like both. Simple enough to make and the next batch will be a quadruple batch cause it's good on eggs, chicken, pork pretty much universal!

Good enough to put Ki****an out of business! Did not have sherry, so I used marsala wine instead, and it worked out just fine. I can't believe just how incredibly easy this is to make, and like Lucy said, all from stuff you already have in the kitchen. My Tonkatsu sauce buying days are behind me.

I've never had Tonkatsu sauce so I have nothing to compare this to but it was delicious! I didn't heat mine in the micro but rather, simmered on the stove for about 20 mins. so the flavors could meld. Absolutely loved it although my other half would prefer a touch less ketchup. What does he know, lol. Thanks! :o)

I let this sit for only a half hour before using it and the Worcestershire sauce was mighty strong.  The next day it had mellowed, but I'd probably reduce the WS to 2T or even less.  Good sauce though!  It got me out of a jam when I made Chicken Katsu then realized I had no sauce.

Very pleased with this katsu sauce. We are fans of bulldog sauce also, but thought this was a great substitute in a pinch.

Really close to authentic katsu sauce I've had before.  I know it's just a little off, but not sure how to mod it for true authenticity.  However, It is a delicious sauce, and my family, who had never had chicken katsu before, loved it.

I paired this sauce recipe with a Katsu chicken recipe off this site. I didnâ€™t have wine so I used apple cider vinegar (only 1 tbsp) as mentioned in the reviews. My husband thought it was better than the Hawaiian BBQ place we frequent.

This is delightful and so easy. It really makes the dish. I sometimes substitute mirin for the sherry but I've made it both ways.

As written it was okay. I used this as a base for a second batch. Mirin instead of Sherry. A wee bit of horseradish as it goes a long way. 2T of apple/pearsauce. Oh, and 1T of BBQ sauce to even out the flavor. Other common changes: no mustard, used brown sugar, 1 tsp of garlic and ginger powders.

My wife gave this rating having had tonkatsu before. I didnt have the sherry but the sauce was close to what she had in a restaurant. Its definitely an interesting flavor that pairs well with chicken katsu. Just be sure to use sparingly until you know you like it. I had to go back and add more after it quickly grew on me. Cant wait to make it again with the sherry and see how that tastes!

This recipe is amazingly good for the simple off the shelf ingredients. Very easy to make too! This has been our standard katsu sauce for years.

I have tried several recipes for this sauce and this is my favorite. My only change was I used Truvia instead of sugar as I cook for a diabetic.  Still amazing!

I made the recipe without the sherry, but instead added a teaspoon of dijon mustard. And also about a teaspoon more sugar.  Was delicious!

Very quick and easy tonkatsu sauce. Like others have mentioned it's a good start and could use a few other flavors to make it really great. When you're running short on time this is super quick to whip up and works well.

Was making tonkatsu pork and realized I did not have any sauce, so I searched and tried this recipe.  It was a very good base, since I didn't know what to start with.  I tweaked it a little with more Worcestershire and sugar, and also didn't have garlic or ginger powder so I minced up fresh garlic and ginger.  It was pretty much spot on to what I've had in Japanese restaurants!

Pretty good. We found it a bit sour for our taste. Next time I think I'll add a little plum sauce or a tad more brown sugar. Didn't have sherry on hand so subbed apple cider vinegar, and used fresh ginger and garlic.

I don't think this style of tonkatsu sauce works for me. :( its very busy and lacks a fruity element that many bottled katsu sauces have. Next time I'll just heat some catsup, Worcestershire sauce,  a plum or apricot jam,  and a bit of soy sauce together like I normally do. Its pretty close to the bottled kind.

Nice quick recipe to make in a pinch. We also like the Bulldog brand tonkatsu sauce, so I made a couple changes. Used white wine instead of dry sherry and added a splash of hard apple cider. Also a dash of cayenne. Worked great!

PERFECT! I did make a few changes based on reviewers and available ingredients: I added 1/4 cup plum sauce, I used Gluten-free tamari instead of soy sauce, and I soaked grated ginger and garlic in a mix of the allotted soy sauce (my gf tamari) and dry sherry overnight then strained it into the rest of the mix. Also, it may seem dumb but remember to cover it when you place it in the microwave as it likes to splatter. My family adored this sauce and my father, picky eater, reported that it was far better than any regular store bought ones and it was gluten-free to boot! Amazing recipe that I recommend everyone try! Thank you for this incredible recipe!

This was really good! Growing up I had katsu often, and this recipe is exactly the flavor I was looking for.

This went wonderfully with the tonkatsu recipe found on this site. Substituted rice vinegar for the dry sherry since I didn't have any in my pantry. But oh man, it was great!

Based on the most helpful review by laxgmom, I upped the ketchup to 3/4 cup and followed everything else pretty much to a T.   It tastes like some of the best Katsu sauce I've every had and I only had an hour to let it rest.  I think I'll try it again, a couple of days in advance.

I think this could be used as a substitute for BBQ sauce, but it didn't taste anything like tonkatsu sauce to me.  I was disappointed with the flavor.

Very good. On occasion I used to have this dish at a little hole in the wall gem called Azuma at 16123 S Western Ave, Gardena, CA. I used the sauce on the familiar dish of pork cutlets breaded with the standard flour, egg and panko breadcrumbs.

The "no thank you" persons at the table were converted by the meal's end. Ha!

Sides were shredded cabbage with a dressing of light mayo/very small amount of ketchup added, rice and peas. Don't laugh at the cabbage dressing combo til you try it :-)

Super easy to make, and honestly, I prefer it to store-bought barbecue sauce
