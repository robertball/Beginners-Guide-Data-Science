Beautiful blend of condiments, herbs and spices. However, the Ketchup base has to go. Either make a brown roux or use a jar of  gravy. If you can't do without the tomato, add a couple of tsps. of nice tomato paste.

Sorry.  My last review ended before I meant it to.  This is great!  To make true Singaporean chili crab you have to use the ketchup - so this is an authentic recipe.  The commenter who said not to use ketchup is making a different type of sauce that is not Singaporean.  Very delicious and you can use all different kinds of crab - whatever you have available.
