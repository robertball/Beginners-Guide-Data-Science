Great Muffins!  always a hit with my family. Heres a tip:  I found that if I use a good brand of bran (kellogs or the like) it absorbs much better then the cheaper no name brand.  After a long time of refrideration the no name brand will still be quite "sloshy", rather then absorbing moisture while in the fridge it seemed to absorb during the baking time.  Not a big deal just a matter of personal preference I guess.

I've been using this recipe for several years and just now remembered to review it.  :o)  It is the BEST bran muffin recipe I've ever tried.  I did make some changes, as it looks like most everyone else did too.  I use apple juice and chopped apples instead of the pineapple juice and raisins originally called for.  I also add 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves to the flour mixture.  I had a problem with the cereal retaining some of the flour and having white clumps on it, so I mix the cereal in separately - after the flour mixture has been incorporated with the wet ingredients.  You need to use bran FLAKES - I buy the store brand that says 100% whole bran flakes and it works great.  I've also subbed applesauce for the oil, and the only difference noted was they didn't rise quite as much.  I use olive oil if I leave the oil in, and it doesn't taste olive-y after it's cooked.  I've also made them with pineapple juice and chopped pineapple, and it's excellent that way also.  The batter is very thin initially, but I let it sit overnight and it's perfect in the morning.  I use an ice cream scoop to measure into the muffin tins.  I normally make a double batch of muffins and freeze them.  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!  Definitely FIVE STARS!

I've used egg beaters to replace the eggs; have added up to 1 c. shredded carrots as well - both with excellent results!  Cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice are also excellent additions.

These muffins came out beautifully! I used General Mills' All-Bran cereal and was out of raisins, so I looked through my pantry and decided on using apricots which I chopped. Another difference I made was using Juicy Juice brand's Orange Tangerine juice instead of pineapple juice (didn't have any). After chilling for 3 hours, I used a cookie-dough spring action-type scoop to distribute the batter into the muffine cups - 2 scoops was the perfect amount to fill regular-sized muffin tins. I baked the muffins for 15 minutes, and they came out perfectly - 20 min. would be way too long. In the end, I was able to make 27 muffins, not bad. :) The next time I make these, I think I would crush the bran cereal a bit to avoid the bran "chunks" as I call them. I think making the bran a bit more discreet would be better. Also, I baked the muffins in aluminum muffin cups. This didn't change the speed of cooking (they ended up the same aas they would if they were in paper ones); but I did this so I could keep them fresh by refrigerating, then I can heat them up in the toaster oven each morning so I could have a 'hot, fresh muffin.'

Wow these were great! I made a few changes: I used whole wheat flour instead of regular. I also substitued 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I cut the honey down to 1/4 cup. And I used eggbeaters as previously suggested! I used All-Bran cereal. And I did use pineapple juice because I happened to have some on hand - I love what pinapple juice does for these muffins! Just great! I made half the muffins after the batter chilled for 3 hours and only had to bake them 15 minutes before they were done. I will make the rest of them tomorrow and see if they can possibly be any better(I doubt it)!

I found this recipe to be tasty, it really doesn't taste like a heavy bran muffin.  The tempeture of 400F is a little too warm to be baking muffins so I turned it down to 350F.  Also be aware that the muffins stick to the muffin cups!  Other then those set backs the taste is great!

I'm not usually a big bran muffin fan but, this recipe is GREAT.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I omitted the raisins since I don't like raisins and added nuts instead.  They were delicious.  Thanks!

These are the world's best bran muffins and the only ones my family will eat.  We use store brand bran flakes, and crush it up with the bottom of a glass until it is crumbs.  The important thing, though, is to substitute 1 cup of crushed pineapple for half the raisins and add about 1 cup pecans. Since I never have pineapple juice I put the rest of the can of pineapple & juice in the blender, add enough apple or orange juice to make 2 cups and then thoroughly pulverize it.  If I can remember, I use less sugar because this muffin is really sweet. I bake them in a dark pan at 350 or in a silver-colored airbake pan at 400.  Times will vary, but DON'T overbake and don't use muffin cup liners unless you plan on eating those too.  The batter will keep for days in the refrigerator, to be used as needed Cooked muffins can be stored in a closed container for several days, or frozen.

I already have a great bran muffin recipe... but this one is better.  The other reviewer was correct - these are similar in taste to Mimi's Cafe's honey bran muffin.  I have made these as-is, and also using wheat bran instead of cereal, and ground flax seed to replace some of the egg.  It didn't rise as much then, but the flavor was just as excellent.  DO NOT USE MUFFIN LINERS!  You'll never get them off the muffin.  Grease the pan well, and try drizzling some honey in the bottom of each muffin cup before you scoop in the batter.  Delicious and sweet and perfect right out of the oven.

These are great!  I used pineapple juice, three cups of raisin bran (raisins picked out, haha) and one cup of all bran cereal.  I mushed the cereals up and let the batter sit overnight - baked in the morning for 18 min.  I also did 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I love the honey taste.  Next time I'll sneak in a bit of whole wheat pastry flour or spelt flour :-)

REALLY GREAT!  I consider myself a bran-muffin connisure and these are great.  Instead of pineapple juice I used Nantucket Nectars Peach Orange juice which ended up to be  a very good choice.
I also just used pure Oat Bran which I had a hard time figuring what a whole bran cereal is exactly but this worked out great.
Grease your muffin holder with butter for an extra delicious addition.

These turned out wonderfully, even and especially for bran muffins!  I substituted one cup wheat flour and one cup white flour, and 1/4 applesauce and 1/4 oil, and I used black raisins because it's what I had on hand and even with the deviations, they came out wonderful. They're moist and flavorful, and compared to other bran muffins, are very light. I made these because I'm trying to discipline myself to eat better. Suffice it to say, I'm usually the last to reach for a bran muffin. But even I have enjoyed these heartily and it's no chore at all to enjoy one for breakfast.

I baked these again, using a bit of lemon juice + water (did not have enough pineapple juice). They were flat the first time, so I increased the baking soda by 1.5, let the bran mix sit overnight, and beat in the flour + soda immediately before baking. This time they were moist AND tall & fluffy. Very forgiving recipe; don't worry about overbeating/overcooking, the gluten won't overdevelop thanks to the bran and the muffins don't get overcooked easily. Honey really goes well with bran, and the sour juice 'lightened' the taste up and gave a nice flavour.

following another review, I added 30oz of crushed pineapple instead of the pineapple juice.  I also substituted eggbeaters for the eggs, to cut down on the fat.  I thought these were awesome and very moist!

A very heavy muffin!  It's a little to heavy for me, but you could actually eat it for breakfast on its own and it would fill you up.

I was looking for a recipe like the honey bran muffins that Coco's restaurant serves.(Love them) This was the closest one I found. But first, I cut the recipe in half,and I changed the 1 cup of pineapple juice to 1cup of pureed fruit cocktail, and 1TBL water. Also, only used 2 eggs, and the raisn bran cereal, I put in the food processor. After 10 minutes, I drizzled honey on top of each muffin. Plus, I didn't chill batter, used it right away. The muffins turned out very moist and DELICIOUS! Thank you for the recipe!

Good bran muffin recipe. Pineapple juice is the key ingredient for me. I baked for 20 minutes and some of the bottoms were burnt. I will cook for 15-18 minutes next time.

This is THE BEST recipe, but I don't generally have pineapple juice or golden raisins on hand, so I substituted a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and regular raisins for these. I cut the honey to 1/4 cup and I used regular raisin bran. I didn't bother with the "3-hour chill", I just baked them as soon as I was done mixing. The ingredient changes probably destroyed the original calorie count, but the muffins came out WONDERFUL! Even people who don't normally like bran muffins LOVED these!

The wait on these scrumptious muffins is well worth it.  These were the best bran muffins I have ever made.  My boyfriend and I had them fresh three days in a row and still weren't tired of them.  EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!

Very moist. Used apple juice like another reviewer (because had no pineapple juice on hand), and put in a dash of cinnamon, which gave a lovely flavor.

These were very good, though I did cut
back the cooking time, as the first batch
got overcooked at 23 minutes.  The second
batch I cooked for only 18 minutes and
they came out great.

I make these often for my family.  The only thing I change is I use a diced apple in place of the raisins and apple juice in place of the pineapple juice.  This is only because I usually have those on hand more often.  These turn out great every time.  The batter really doesn't look like it will turn out right when you first make them, but don't worry it does thicken up and bake wonderfully after refrigerating all night.

Love these!  Only change was to use applesauce instead of oil (I try to do this whenever possible).  That usually makes the muffin a little denser, but I still really like them.

These are great.  I was so confused as to what type of bran to use, that I used a combination of 3 different types.  One cup oat bran, one cup Fiber One (kind of like All Bran - the sesame noodle looking cereal) and 2 cups of crushed up Bran Flakes.  They turned out great and the texture is amazing.  Not dry at all.  I also used one of the chopped dried fruit medleys with pineapple, papaya and mango instead of raisins...mmm, mmm good.

Awesome muffins... I received MANY compliments from my mom's Bible study group this morning. Used apple juice, half canola oil/olive oil (ran out), and added 1 cup shredded carrots. Recipe made 2 dozen muffins. Will make again...next time I will follow the recipe exactly as I bet the results will be the same (but I didn't have any pineapple juice in the house.)

I've used this recipe several times now and I have found that it is very versatile.  I've used whole wheat flour in place of the white flour and used water in place of the pineapple juice with great results.  Thanks for a great healthy recipe!

These were great muffins!  They are really moist and the flavorful.  We found that for two of us, the recipe made way too many.  I would recommend making half a batch.  We froze half of them, but still couldn't eat them all before they got stale!

I was inspired to make some honey bran muffins after just eating a Mimi's Cafe one which was Fantastic! 
So I did a web search & came up with this recipe. 
These are disappointing compared to Mimi's! Not as moist and not as sweet. I do live at 6000 ft so that may be the moisture problem!
Addendum to my review above on 4/6/03
I tried reducing the oven temp to 375F and doubling (maybe a little more) the amount of honey.
What a difference! They are now outstanding!

Great recipe!  I used whole wheat flour instead of enriched and used fruit juice and extra honey instead of brown sugar and also added nuts and blueberries--and they are awesome!  Very moist and tasty!  Best bran muffins ever!

My boyfriend does not like rasins, so I substituted grated carrots and added some chopped nut.  A new favorite.

My husband likes bran muffins so I've tried many, many recipes, usually with bad 
results.  They're usually either too dry or have no flavor.  Well, my search for the 
perfect muffin is over.  I made these and he loves them.  They're moist and 
delicious.  I like that I can make the batter the night before and just pop them 
in the oven in the morning.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great Recipe!  Easy to make.  Kids love it, they have no idea it's good for them.  I make a batch and freeze them then pop them in the microwave for a quick breakfast on busy mornings.

I loved them, my mother-in-law loved them, my baby loved them but my 4 year old did not.  I loved the pineapple flavoring that took hold of the bran and made the raisins plump up.  Very moist and I will make again and am sharing this recipe with my mother in law.

These were so yummy and a great way to sneak fiber and nutrients into your morning!  I had dried apricots on hand, so I used those instead of raisins.  I cut it to 1 c of apricots and used 1 c of shredded carrots (based on an earlier review).  Instead of pineapple juice, I used the peach mango V8 splash juice.  With all of this, they were a little bit sweet for my taste, so if you don't like sweet, I would recommend using slightly less honey (you can definitely taste the honey).  But they were a pretty big hit with my family!

These muffins were very moist and so delicious! I did make a few changes: I used bran flakes and I reduced the raisins to 1 1/2 c. and added 1/2 c. of dried mixed fruit, consisting of pineapple and papaya pieces.

These were good! My two toddlers & 5 yr old love them, and my husband & I enjoyed them also. This seems to be such a versatile recipe. I used about 3 cups of bran flake cereal (though the recipe says shredded bran), and then added about a cup's worth of miller's bran and some wheat germ. I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil. I only had 1 cup of pineapple juice, so I used some pear juice for the rest. I didn't use all the brown sugar--only a 1/2 cup. I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. I added some dried blueberries instead of raisins, and those really boosted the appeal of the muffins. I let my batter sit overnight and it was very thick in the morning, so I added some water & juice as another reviewer did. Even with all these changes, they still turned out great!

I gave this a five star with some added changes. I left out the oil and added one individual serving pack of applesauce. Left out the sugar and increased honey to 3/4 cups and used whole wheat flour,added 3 T. flax seed oil and dried blueberries. Used All Bran cereal and let the mixture sit in frig. for five hours. Added some water to thin out batter. After all of this, I ate two when they came out of the oven with some promise spead. Yummy.

I agree with everyone else, that these are the best!  The flavor is wonderful and they are very moist and rich.  I used 2 cups shredded carrot instead of raisins and added 3 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves and they were soooo good for a healthy, fast breakfast and good lunchbox food. Also, I didn't know which bran cereal to use so I just used plain bran flakes and had no problems at all.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will be making these a lot!

I love this recipe!  My only change was to use whole wheat flour instead of regular, and I cooked the first batch for 20 minutes and they were overdone.  So, on the next several batches  I stuck between 10-15 minutes and that seemed to be perfect.  Probably varies from oven to oven, so my suggestion would be just to carefully watch your first batch and go from there.

I used stone-ground whole wheat flour, cut the brown sugar in half, and subbed chopped dates for raisins.  As someone else said, this recipe is VERY forgiving and even with my changes it turned out great!  I did add about 3/4 cup water to the chilled muffin mix before baking because the wheat flour dried it out.

WOW!!! These are the best bran muffins I've ever made... or ever had!!! I was really afriad of how they would turn out because I live in Colorado and so far all of my baked goods have turned out aweful! Luckily I read online that if you add ten degrees to the oven temp, and shorten the cooking time, the baked goods will come out fine! So I baked them at 410 for 20 minutes in a regular sized silicon muffin pan. I didn't have raisins but I'm sure they would have turned out even better with them... I used apple juice instead of pineapple juice... But they are awesome!!!

This recipe is great.  I followed the recipe with a few substitutes.  I used apple juice instead of pineapple juice, whole wheat flour instead of allpurpose and I used Raisin Bran Cereal.  With the cereal, I separated the raisin from the bran flakes then followed the recipe accordingly.  These are great in the jumbo muffin pans.  When I took them out of the oven to cool I smothered the tops with honey.  In the morning at room temp they were nicely moist with honey.  Great with a cup of joe.

These were wonderful. I was dubious when I mixed them up because the batter looked too thin, but it was perfect after the night in the fridge. I used apple juice instead of pineapple and the taste was great.

This is a keeper. I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used apple cider instead of the pineapple juice and i used stone ground whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. After I let the mixture sit for the required 3 hours i had to add more apple cider because th ewhole wheat flour is more dense.  These turned out with just the right moistness and flavour. i made jumbo muffins and the recipe yielded 20 muffins. Thanks for a great recipe!

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING. I added 1 cup of chunky applesauce and it was even better!! It is also perfectly fine to use water instead of pinapple juice (it does make the muffins less sweet). What else.....I like to add about 1/4 cup of Splenda to sweeten them up as well. ENJOY!!

One last note, do not freeze the batter, it does not cook the muffins well afterwards. Instead, you can freeze the muffins and they stay well for a long time.

This is a good recipe, but I did make a few changes. I used spelt flour instead of all purpose flour. I also used Grade B maple syrup instead of honey and maple sugar instead of brown sugar. Since I am not a raisin fanatic, I used 1/2 the amount. They turned out really well. My husband hates bran muffins, but he loved these.

Maybe I did something wrong. I was a little unsure of what sort of bran cereal to use. I ended up using Kellogg's all-bran and the muffins were extremely heavy. I added extra honey because my boyfriend loves honey bran muffins from bakeries. Overall, they were good but a bit too dense.

This turned out awesome! I used whole wheat flour instead of white which gave it a grainier taste, but still delicious. Instead of oil used the same amount of applesauce and didn't have the full 2 cups of raisins, so supplemented with a 1/2 cup of craisins. Gave it a little bit of tartness. The last thing is I didn't have any muffin pans so used a bundt cake pan. Overall, turned out great and will definitely be using it again.

Great recipe!! Changes I made included using whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and adding 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dry inredients mix. Yummy! Moist, filling, and goes great with my morning coffee/tea!

These were not bad. They are fluffy and moist on the inside, but they were a bit bland. Twenty minutes was far too long to cook them, unless you use cupcake cups. I added buttermilk and extra sugar to to my second batch to make these a little tastier

I have made these muffins many times.  I don't care for raisins, but I love chopped dates in cereal, so I use them instead of the raisins in this recipe.  These are the best-tasting bran muffins I have ever eaten.

These are the best bran muffins I've ever made! I make them as mini-muffins, freeze them and take them out for breakfast as needed. I tried the recipe as written with the pineapple juice and golden raisins but I like it better with orange juice and regular dark raisins plus the zest of one orange. I also like to use half wheat flour and half regular flour. For the bran I use All Bran cereal but be sure to buy the original shreds, they work best in this recipe.

Good Recipe, though it may be a bit sweet for some people. I greased the muffins tins well, but they muffins would not come out in one piece, the tops broke off. Next time I will line the muffin tins instead.

And another muffin hits the dust..  I love the moist texture of this muffin and how it didn't let all the suger overpower it. It's really sticking with me right now and I guess that's what brand muffins do since they took 27 minetes in the oven, but my only objection is the time. I didn't like that it was an overnighter as I don't have the most golden patience in the world. These golden muffins were my first of many bran muffins and I plan on making more.

Excellent breakfast! I followed this exactly but didn't have enough raisins so I added chopped apples like other reviews recommended and it was sooooo good! Okay, maybe I didn't follow it exactly because I also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Really good!

These were really good!  I did not have time to let the batter sit overnight so I heated the pineapple juice in the microwave until hot and then poured it over the cereal then let it sit for about 10 minutes to absorb the liquid and soften.  I then added the other ingredients as shown in the recipe.  It worked great - nice texture and no lumps.  I also used Fiber One cereal because it's what I had on hand.  This will be my go-to bran muffin recipe from now on!

These are way too sweet for me. I think it's the pineapple juice; might be better with apple juice or even orange juice. I was really confused about what type of cereal was specified. I ended up with Post spoon size shredded wheat n bran; this created interesting little pillows in the muffins. I probably should have cut up the pillows--it might have helped cut the too sweet taste. If I make again, I will also reduce the amount of honey.

I made the batter last night and baked some up this morning.  The batter looked really good.  The All Bran soaked up the liquid and became very moist.  I used 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup of dried cranberries.  Unfortunately, I was running short on time and decided to make both jumbo and regular sized muffins at the same time.  I took the regular ones out after about 19 minutes and they looked ok, but I didn't taste one yet.  I had to leave the jumbo ones in for a while longer (while I was in the shower) and when the buzzer rang, they looked a little overdone.  Sure enough, now that I'm at work and eating one, the underside of the top is a little darker than it should be and it tastes overcooked.  So I'm guessing my 6 jumbo muffins are basically a waste.  I will try the smaller ones when I go home for lunch.  I will probably make these again, but with some alterations.  Maybe add some banana puree and/or applesauce to add some more interest to the taste.

These taste really good - and I'm not even one of those "health nuts" who likes everything with the word "bran" in it.  These will be enjoyed by people who enjoy natural sweet flavors rather than refined sugar.  I used chunky applesauce instead of oil.  The texture is substantial without being tough or heavy.

This is a good basic muffin but nothing to really scream over.  The texture was rather chewy right out of the oven, but tasted much better after toasting in the toaster oven.  I followed the recipe exactly except used cranberries instead of raisins.  I couldn't taste the pineapple juice at all, which was disappointing.  I also thought the batter was too sweet before baking, but it came out just right after it was cooked.  I would make again, but I will continue to search for a recipe closer to Mimi's Cafe bran muffins.  These were a bit bland.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! And sooo easy to make. I added pineapple to the first batch that I made and apples to the second. I think the next time I'll turn the oven down to 350 degrees and let them cook slower and longer. They were a little to brown.
I love bran muffins and have had many of them, but this is my favorite thus far. Thank you!

I must not have been doing something right, because I changed a few things and the muffins turned out a little dry and not very sweet  - only 2 yolks, 5 whites, 1 1/2 cup shredded carrots, low-sugar apple juice instead of pineapple, a combo of golden/regular raisins and cranberries, wheat flour... However, they were still good, especially warm with a little butter. So, if you want decent health-nut muffins, then change away, but for really delicious muffins, stick with the original recipe.

My favourite bran muffins! I usually use apple juice instead of pineapple (only because pineapple is hard to find where I live), and I omit the raisins because I don't like them.

I was short on fruit juice, so I used half orange juice and half water.  I also used half the amount of honey.
Mine turned out just a tad on the dry side, but still great.  I think this happened because I used freshly-ground wheat, which tends to thicken things up a bit.
I used wheat bran instead of cereal, so maybe this also contributed to the thickness?
I had fun adding things, such as apples, blueberries, and chocolate chips.  So experiment a little!
I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice (amounts in that order), and drizzled them with honey while they were baking, as someone suggested.
17-18 minutes was the perfect baking time.

This delightful goodies taste are pretty much dessert for me when made with white flour. I usually half the recipe and it still makes a respectible amount. I also usually sustitute a cup of whole wheat flour for reg. flour to make it a little healthier. It's still good, but not as good when you do it with regular flour, esp if you want to eat them the next day, instead of straight-out-the-oven. I also use All-Bran cereal. Sometimes I also stick it in the freezer for a bit to speed of the process, but they are really much better if you just let me sit in the fridge for the designated amount of time.

This is by far the best bran muffin recipe I've tried. I was looking for a muffin recipe to duplicate the ones I bought from the Vons bakery, because I like those the best. This is it - only better! It does have lots of raisins, so the second time I made them I cut the raisins in half and used 1 cup of pineapple tidbits with the raisins. It was good that way too. I think next time I make them I'll only use 1 cup of raisins instead. Great recipe!

Great muffins, I too made changes. I used un filtered pure apple juice instead of grapefruit juice, added cinnamon, added walnuts, dried creanberries and apricots, used more honey and no brown sugar, whole wheat flour, and they turned out great:)

I don't personally eat these, but I make them all the time for my husband who absolutely loves them (and that's saying a lot because he's very fussy).  I like that the batter can be mixed up the night before and all I have to do is pop them in the oven in the morning.

Good taste but definitely time needs adjusting. the bottoms were burned on all of them.  Dough was really tough to pour and had to scooped into muffin pan.  Will definitely have a go at them again!

Beautiful, sweet and moist muffins. Try adding dates instead of raisins for a change. I also add 2 fresh apples cut into small pieces. I cook the lot and freeze most of them to have one every day.

I love the subtle taste of the pineapple juice in these muffins.  I've used regular raisins when I don't have golden on hand and are every bit as good.  I do cut back on the brown sugar a bit tho to 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup instead of the full cup. The convience of making the batter the day before baking them is teriffic!

I've made these muffins twice - once using All Bran (the "sesame noodle" cereal) and last night using Smart Start oat flake cereal. The flakes do blend down, but not quite as much as the bran. Just stir the batter really well after overnight in the fridge and before baking, but I think I'll stick with the All Bran next time. The texture was a little different. I cut the brown sugar in half and not quite the full amount of honey. Still plenty sweet. Also, baked them a little less time than called for. I got a dozen regular size muffins and five jumbos. LOVE these babies!

These are the best bran muffins I've ever had - moist, just sweet enough, great texture - perfect! One thing I have to point out is that the recipe doesn't specify what type of bran cereal to use...there are multiple types! It seems like other reviewers used flakes, but I used the All Bran kind that looks like skinny sesame noodles. I can't possibly imagine the texture would have turned out right using flakes. This type of cereal is the way to go!

This was my first time making "non box" muffins. I enjoyed making them however they didnt come out as fluffy as most muffins I buy in the stores? I will try and let the batter sit a few more days to see if the bran gets broken down more and they become more fluffy.

Best bran muffins I have ever tasted. I cut the recipe in half and made tiny muffins for bite size snacks and they turned out wonderful. I also added some wheat germ and cinnamon to taste. Mmmm thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, is definitely a keeper!

excellent recipe!  they were nice and moist.  did not have pineapple juice, so i used an 8oz can of crushed, and added a cup of water to compensate.  mine made a few more muffins than suggested.  but i wouldn't change a thing.  my roommates keep eating them, they won't be around long!

These are really good and the recipe is very forgiving w/ substitutions! I used orange juice instead of pineapple juice. Also try with mixture of craisins, raisins, walnuts & dried apple. Have also added 1 pouch of Quaker flavored oatmeal supreme when I fell a bit short on the bran cereal (I generally use crushed Total Raisin Bran because we eat as cereal). Very moist muffins!!!

Very good muffins. Bran is really an aquired taste, I have a feeling the more I eat these, the more I will like them. The recipe makes ALOT of muffins however, and you can't really eat very many because they are quite filling, so make sure you have some bran enthusiasts around to eat all these, or cut the recipe. I have been eating them for breakfast this week- a good source of fiber, folate, and iron. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making these again.

These are great!  I made them originally for my daughter but she hasn't taken to them yet (she's only 18 months!)  but my husband and I love them!  Instead of adding the raisins whole, I soaked them in boiling water to plump them up and then pureed them in the food processor.  This gives them the taste of raisins without the raisins themselves...which my daughter tends to pick out.  Very moist...most yummy!

WOW, this was a GREAT muffin. I, too, am not
a big fan of bran muffins. I substituted one cup
of grape nuts cereal for one cup of the bran cereal and didn't have quite enough pineapple juice so I used some plain water. Also only had the dark raisins. Even those who don't like raisins couldn't even tell they were in there!
The muffins are so moist, not at all heavy, and quite delicious!!!  Healthy enough to eat as breakfast but sweet enough for a dessert treat.

I make a bunch of them ahead of time and put them in ziplock baggies and put them in the freezer. They reheat really well in the microwave.

So good! It's so delicious with the raisins, but you could substitute with cherries or apples or blueberries, etc. I cooked for 20 min and they turned out good, just a little overcooked. I'm going to try 15 min.

Loved this recipe. At first I was concerned that I had gotten the wrong cereal (All Bran, the kind that looks like guinea pig food), but it worked!! Next time I will bump up the flavour with some allspice, cloves and cinnamon, but as is it is very good. Even my picky eater girls like them, half were gone within an hour!

Really love this recipe! Even my picky 2 year old loves these muffins. Cooked for 20 minutes at 375 degrees and they came out perfect. Made almost exactly like the recipe says, except I added in a bit of cinnamon as another reviewing suggested. And I made directly in the muffin tins (no liners) as I read from quite a few reviewers that it sticks really badly to the liners.

Great recipe. I like a heavy bran raisin honey muffin and this does the trick. I used all bran buds cereal for the bran and used all wheat flour instead of half bleached flour. Also, I found its hard to locate pineapple juice in small quantities so I used a small can of crushed pineapple. Then added 3/4 cup water to make up for less liquid in the can. Wonderful. It results in tiny pineapple chunks throughout the muffin that complements the raisins, bran, honey, and brown sugar beautifully. Thanks!!

Made this twice and both times they turned out great, muffins are super moist. Only change I did was using apple juice, instead of pineapple, only because I have lots of apple juice. Next to blueberry muffins, this is the families next fave.

The first time I tried this recipe I realized part-way into it that I had overlooked the part about the chilling overnight. Oh, well, I just threw the All Bran in the juice with the raisins for about 10 minutes.  Added the flour mixture first to the egg mixture and then stirred in the wet glop of bran and raisins.  The batter was not thin; it baked up perfectly--no extra waiting!
I just made them with apple juice today and they were super yummy!  Thanks!

It is fabulous! Did not change a thing about it and it turned very good! I used dole pineapple juice and Kellogg's All-Bran Original cereal. I put a few muffins in the freezer and the rest has been on the counter for three days - still fresh, moist and good. Highly recommend!

Definitely 5 stars I made a few changes I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (Robin Hood) and 1/4 cup ground flax instead of the all purpose flour. I used 1/3 cup of Coconut sugar instead of the brown sugar, I used 1/4 cup of milk in place of the honey, I used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil, I used 1/2 cup pineapple juice and 1/2 cup orange juice instead of 1 cup of pineapple juice. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I just used a couple of pinches of salt and I cooked it at 425F for 11 minutes and 400F for 11 minutes these muffins have a great taste lots of flavour and very moist, they have just the right amount of sweetness i let them sit in the fridge for about 5 hours. It  made 13 muffins that is with the recipe cut in half Thanks June M for posting

Loved these.  My husband even said they were good.  The test will be if the toddler likes them or not.  Used applesauce instead of oil.  Didn't have enough raisins, so used some chopped dates and chopped dried apricots to add up to 2 c. of fruit.  Also used raisin bran, raisins and all, so they're a bit overly fruity, but still quite yummy.  Batter made 12 regular sized muffins, 24 mini muffins and had enough left over to put in a loaf pan for some slices.  Used muffin cups, but sprayed them with cooking spray and haven't had a problem with them sticking.  Next time I plan to use whole wheat flour and maybe some mini chocolate chips for my toddler (she loves chocolate chip muffins).  Can't wait to try all the variations I've read about for these.  Definitely a keeper!!

I love this recipe but I make a few changes. We don't like raisins in my family so I omit those and then once I pull the mix out of the fridge after resting it overnight, I add 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries and I grate 2 large carrots into the mix for extra moisture and nutrition. I also find the recipe as-is a bit too sweet so I halved the brown sugar. It was still plenty sweet so I may try to cut it out totally next time. The honey, pineapple, blueberries, and the sugar already in the cereal make it sweet enough for us.

I used this recipe as a base for my bran muffins. To cut down on calories and add more benefit I substituted the following ingredients: Omit oil Bran cereal : Bran flour Half the flour : ground flax omit honey Half the brown sugar: 1/2tsp stevia 5 Eggs : 9 Egg whites Raisins : Either dried cranberries or chopped dried peaches and walnuts  The end result is very natural tasting and may only appealto certain individuals but my family loves them. They are a great way to start the day or keep in your purse to avoid tempting takeout on a busy day!

Should be called RAISIN honey bran muffins.  So healthy, great way to get bran into your diet, even healthier if you use wheat flour.  I wasn't sure what kind of "bran cereal" was intended, but I used bran flakes with good results. Very good - moist, naturally sweet.

Yummy with no change to instructions.  Used Bob's Red Mill Wheat Bran to avoid unwanted ingredients in processed cereals.  Children not big fans.  Will try with orange juice instead of pinapple next time and add orange zest.

Huge hit in my household and many others!  I substituted whole wheat pastry flour, and used all-bran (blenderized in mu Cuisinart). Muffins stored well in the freezer & are perfect for a quick morning snack! Next time, I will use applesauce as a substitute for the oil, as I don't think it would take anything away from the delicious taste. Reccomend raisins and small chunks of apple. Yummy!

Not impressed even though the texture was very good. I didn't expect it to be so light, fluffy, and moist . However, the flavors were really off. I know there is honey in the name, but I thought it would be like other recipes and just be a sweetener. The honey taste comeplely overwhelmed the taste of the muffin. There was no other taste but honey. It was like drinking honey from the bottle. Will not make again.

I tried these muffins having great expectations after reading all the reviews, but didn't think they were that stellar.  The muffins were a little dry and not very sweet.  I had even added some craisins, apple butter, and cinnamon to give them more flavor but they were still bland.  They were better warmed with a little butter, but I plan to try another bran muffin recipe next time.

It's pretty good.  Way too much fruit, though, borders on fruitcake only much lighter. But would not turn me off from bran. But it is a lot of sugar.  I will try half the fruit and water next time and add nuts. Listen to the reviews that say 15 minutes.  I made this for the staff at church this morning.  I hope they like it.

My kids don't like raisins, so I switch them to pineapple chunks. It makes the muffins a little sweeter but no one seems to mind. :)

My older son and the neighbors thought it was a good recipe, moist and flavorful! Others always seemed dry and bland.  This one is very good.  Yes, it does make alot!

Finally, a bran muffin recipe my hubby and I agree on! He tends to like very traditional bran muffins which to me, often seem dry. The banana in these really helped keep these moist.I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda and they were great!

I followed the recipe exactly except I only baked them for 17 mins.  They turned out great!  My whole family enjoyed them, even my 2 year old.  I will definitely make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

After much trial and error I've found if I zap the All Bran in my food processor a bit before measuring out, I get a great textured muffin. After they've cooled, it's off to the freezer with the lot of them-individually wrapped so we can grab one each morning, heading out to work. Perfect!

These are fabulous muffins!  Definately worth the wait!  I have never used the raisins, however.  I snip apricots into bite-sized pieces and drown them in the pineapple juice.  Very tasty!

I also made a variation of this recipe to make apple cinnamon muffins--I substituted apple juice for the pineapple, apple sauce for the oil and added 2t of cinnamon and 1/2 t each of ginger and allspice (nutmeg if you prefer).  It was very tasty too!

These are delicious, if a bit sweet for my taste. I will definitely make these again, but with a little less sugar.

these are sooooo good! I made only half the recipe as it made 14 regular size muffins and also used Post Raisin Bran cereal instead of whole bran cereal and cut the raisins to 1/2 cup. They are delicious and will be making them often.

These are very moist for bran muffins,The family loved them and I liked that you make them the night before and refridgerate overnight, so that when I get up in the morning, give the batter a quick stir, and its ready to cook.

Wonderful and tastey recipe. The amount of sugur used in this recipe seemed a little much but with the amount of muffins you can make, it isn't too much. Suggestion - make the larger muffins as the smaller muffins can burn easily. Great overall!

These muffins are fantastic!!  They have become a favorite in our house.  Very moist and flavorful. Dried apricots work well in this muffin too!

Very good.  I also increased the amount of honey to 1 cup, "plumped" up the raisins and pureed them.  Excellent.

I used apple juice instead of pineapple and they were awesome.  Soft and moist and simply delicious.  Best raisin bran muffin recipe I've found
