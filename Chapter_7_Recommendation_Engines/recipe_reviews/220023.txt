These cookies were very easy for my 10 year old to make.  The chocolate was a bit difficult to get on and I even added a bit of cream to it to smooth it out.

These were good cookies, but I thought that they would be really easy to make.  Unfortunately, and maybe this is my fault, getting the chocolate to look really good on the cookie is very difficult.  Sorry, but thanks for posting the recipe.

I got five cookies from this. After that I couldn't get the dough to stay together. Won't do this again.

I liked this recipe!  Definitely do not need as much chocolate as the recipe calls for.  Will make again.

Very easy to make. I had to add more sugar as the dough seemed too wet based on measurements listed. Leave at least an inch between cookies on baking sheet as they expand into eachother & end up looking more like boobs than hearts. Dough does not hold cookie cutter shape well.

Made for my cookie monster husband.  He said "best pb cookies I've ever eaten"  Easy to make.  I used 1 1/2 c pb and sugar with 1 egg.  Got 18 cookies.  Put big teaspoon of crisco in chocolate chips and melted in micro.  Only needed 1/2 bag of chips.

Great simple cookie. To make it easier to dip in chocolate, melt your chocolate chips with a tablespoon or two of shortening. It will help a lot with thinning it out and making it easier to spread.
