Great! It has a combined taste of sourdough/cornbread with a bread like texture.
I triple the jalapenos but I only chop them slightly instead of dicing. My guest raved. Made it two days in a row.

Great bread! I used one whole jalapeno, (like things with a *kick*)--also added a bit of garlic powder, and onion flakes. I ended up having to add more water to my dough....probably b/c of the "extras" I threw in.

I did as others suggested and increased the amount of peppers used in this bread and it turned out good.  I was disappointed in how small the loaf turned out, but it may have had something to do with the express setting I used on my bread machine. My husband enjoyed it a lot and liked the kick the jalapenos gave it.

Per other reviewers I was expecting a small loaf but not quite this small!  I thought this bread certainly had to be heavy but I was pleasantly surprised by the light, chewy texture.  I added extra jalapenos but thought that it could have used even more.  If you have left-overs, try toasting slices and serving with breakfast.  Yummy!

Had a large get together that i had promised to bring jalapeno cornbread. I had never made it before so I found this recipe and decided to try it. We made it by hand as I had to make a quadruple batch. We found the recipe to be more like jalapeno bread with some cornmeal. I would change the ratio to 2/1 bread flour to corn meal. Definitely nice with the extra peppers! (THANKS!)We found that it had to cook for about an hour (cake pan) before it was not doughey any more. Also, butter the top and add some Kosher salt for a very nice twist!

Overall loved it and will make it a keeper.

I made this for New Years to go with our ham and beans. Wow this is really good. I did not change the recipe except adding the whole jalapeno. I baked in a #5 cast iron skillet (yes that is all it makes). Next time I will double this because I eat half by myself.

Not really corn bread. I opted to leave the corn out of the recipe. This recipe only made a very small (about half of bread machine pan) loaf. The bread itself was very good, but next time I'll omit the corn, double all the other ingredients, and hope to have a full loaf of bread.

The liquid to dry ingredients is very off!This bread lacks flavor. maybe if I try this again I will add cheese of some sort? The idea is great  But I suggest using a differnt recipe.

I must have done something wrong because the 1/2 cup of water just didn't do it for me...it couldn't form a dough for lack of moisture.  So I added another 1/2 cup and the bread was really very good.  (Perhaps I shouldn't have drained the corn? Next time I won't.) The texture was nice and the corn made it chewy. I would have prefered more of the hot pepper but my hubby preferred it as it was.  I served this with ham and, had I served it with chili, hotter might have been better. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I liked the fact that this cornbread had yeast in it, sounded really good. I can not tell a lie, I was in a hurry and forgot the bread flour at the store. I used a Jiffy box of cornbread instead. I did heat up some heavy cream (out of milk) and used the yeast, let it foam up and went about the rest of the recipe with the box. I put it in a loaf pan and Boy, was it Yummy!

not enough liquid by far. I made the recipe for 20 servings to fill my bread machine at 4 cups - flavor was great but the bread was heavy and crumbely. This recipe needs your attention to get it to work.

Odd Bread, not really cornbread, not really bread. Taste is very bland, but did put it under Black-eyed peas and it was better. Not to sure this will be made again. Much prefer cornbread.

If you double the recipe be sure to add extra water (I eyed it).  I tried it w/o the jalepenos and it still turned out great.  I ended up making both a single batch (1/2 loaf) and double batch because my husband begged for more.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

Tasty and moist.  I added a cup of shredded pepper jack cheese and it smooths out the cornbread.

I followed the recipe and the dough was so hard it wouldn't incorporate the corn and jalapenos.  I have a 2 lb machine and I think the recipe is not suited for large machines.

Not real cornbread. It's reminiscent of cornbread ,but not cornbread. It was somewhat tasty but not the authentic taste I was looking for.I will use the corn and jalapeño in another recipe.

This recipe needs tweaking.  I've attempted it twice and haven't been satisfied yet.  It was super dry-not sticking together at all so i added a tiny bit of water.  then when i added the  corn and jalapenos  when instructed the dough was mushy and needed flour. once i got the moisture evened out it end result is decent and enjoyable but nothing I would rave about.

Used pepperoncinis instead of jelepenos (don't like too spicy of food) and a little extra water as suggested by someone else. Pretty good.

Five stars in spite of it not tasting much like cornbread, it is so very good!  The loaf size is way small. I am going to make it again and double everything, see if I can get a regular size loaf of bread out of it. 
I took another reviewer's idea and after baking, melted butter on top and then sprinkled with Coarse Salt. 
Don't let the size of the loaf fool you, it is very light.
Worth making.

This was a wonderful cornbread!  The corn gave it sweetness and of course, there was some heat from the hot pepper.  I melted butter on top of it when I took it out of the oven, and sprinkled on a little cheese as well.  Will make again soon.

I used canned corn.  Too watery.  Need to use fresh corn on the cob.  Needed to add more flour to the mixture to make up for the water in the canned corn.  But, other wise good recipe.  Used more Jelepenos.  Maybe next tiem add cheese.

Very moist and flavorful. I am not a spicy food guy but this just added enough warmth. When I make it again I will use s little more jalapenos.

Think you got the amount of water wrong - needed more to achieve soft dough. Addition of corn much improved interest and texture over straight cornbread - next time  will add more chilli

I have been experimenting with my bread machine. I did use alot more jalapeno's but it came out perfect for me. The crust had a nice crust and the rest was tender. It was great with the chilli I made.

I have been trying many different corn bread recipes and found this cornbread to be dry and boring.  I followed the recipe to a tee - will be sticking with other recipes.
