I'm a pumpkin seed purist (roasted w/ sea salt & EVOO) so I enjoyed trying out new recipes this afternoon, after some goopy, messy jack-o-lantern carving. I chose this recipe (for the sweet) and another one that was more spicy. Truth be told, after they cooled, I mixed the 2 batches together for a co-minglng of savory and sugary. However, as this recipe stands, I enjoyed it, but really recommend going 300 deg. instead of 350, b/c some of my seeds got sticky and burnt. The smell wafting through my house while these roasted -- DEEEEEVINE!

This was a nice different recipe.I liked the sweetness, instead of the regular saltyones I make.  I doubled everything in the ingredients, except the butter.  And I only had to bake it for 20 minutes, but that may be because I used a pie pumpkin instead of a regular sized pumpkin, so the seeds were smaller and cooked faster.

Addictive. They pass the kid test. These will go fast at our house. I may make another batch and include them in a granola mix.

It was pretty good flavor.  Sweet but not rich.   I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of maple syrup and because others were saying there was too much butter I only used 2 tablespoons and it was perfect.  I baked at 300, as suggested by another, for 30 minutes and it could have been a bit longer because I would have liked them a little more crispy.

Ended up burnt, and I only had the oven on 325. Did make the apartment smell lovely, though.

I made these for a Halloween party.
Lots of people loved them; the bowl was gone at the end of the night.
I would use less butter next time.  I had to drain some off then patted them off with a paper towel.

I didn't change anything.. I loved them. I also had made some cinnamon/sugar pumpkin seeds. I took the two and combined them. They were amazing together. My husband isn't a big pumpkin seed person like I am and he was eating them..

Pretty good.  I didn't do any of the extra prep though, just mixed up the seasonings and seeds and baked.

Followed directions exactly except reduced oven temp to 300 degrees based on other reviews, but still tasted burnt with very little cinnamon flavor.  Not sure how to get these to turn out right!

gave 2 stars because I have a kiddo that likes the brown burnt flavor. I could not taste the cinnamon.
back to my original way with no butter and seasoning of choice, with lower Temp.

I did not like this recipe.  Mine came out burnt and sticky.  My pan was coated in butter, had to clean 2x because of all the butter.  Not sure if its too much butter, the cook time or the sugar but mine were inedible.  And I really wanted pumpkin seeds since I haven't had them since I was a kid.  I will not make this again.

Almost fool proof since I didn't read well before starting! I mixed the butter w/ the spices and 2 T brown sugar, melted it and then added the pumpkin seeds... Oops! I cooked them for about 20 mins over medium-low heat and then transfered them to a lined baking sheet and baked at 300 for 20 mins stiring once. Not sure if they were supposed to turn out any different then they did, but the whole family thought they were excellent. Even the cat liked them! My 8 year-old was beside herself when she looked down to find the cat eating her pumpkins seeds out the bowl she was holding. We will definately be making these again!

My new favorite!  I followed directions but lowered oven temp to 300, stiring every 10 min till done.  3- 40 min.

Loved this recipe! I'm new at roasting seeds and this one turned out great. I did, however, follow another post by coking them at 300 instead of 350 to keep from burning. The only thing I changed about the recipe was that I sprinkled sugar on the seeds and stirred them well, again, about 10 minutes after I pulled them from the oven to give them a sweeter taste. And my home smells better than any expensive candle could offer. I wish this recipe had "smell-a-vision"!! You couldn't pass it up if so!

These are delicious!  I also only added 2 tbsp of butter.  I also used 2 tbsp of brown sugar, and 2 tbsp of agave nectar to make them even sweeter.  Great recipe!

Can’t stop eating these! OBSERVATION: I baked half on parchment on a perforated pizza pan, and half on a bare greased baking sheet. The ones on parchment taste sweeter.

I am a huge maple fan, so this recipe sounded amazing.  The flavor of the nutmeg was way overpowering.  Half would have been plenty.  After having the seeds in the oven at 300 for 10 min, I stirred them and realized the recipe stated 350 degrees, so I turned the oven up.  I set the timer for only 4 minutes.  When I opened the oven, they were burned!

I only cooked mine for 2x 12 minute oven sessions and they were almost over done. Be sure to watch them! If you love candied nuts, these are great.  I also added a pinch of sea salt.

I made this and it turned out pretty awesome. I did make one little change. At the berry end I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar over them to give them a tiny bit more sweetness. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as said and it turned out awesome.

The first 10 minutes in the oven was enough to burn these.  I might try these again and only put them in the oven for 5 minutes.

Yummy.  Used coconut oil instead of butter to make it vegan - they are half gone and not quite cool yet.

While they smelled absolutely divine before going into the oven, mine ended up burnt after only about 20 minutes.  I'd try the recipe again but at a much lower temperature.  If they ended up being half as tasty as the smelled I'm sure I would have enjoyed the recipe much more.
