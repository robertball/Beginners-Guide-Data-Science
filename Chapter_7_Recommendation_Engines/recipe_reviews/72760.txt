I didn't have the proportions exactly right since my jar sizes were different, but it was still delicious.  My kids (2.5 and 5) ate every bit on their plates and my daughter asked for more!

We don't really care for spaghetti sauce. We maybe eat it once a year if that, but this was really good. I have never bought jarred sauce before so picking one was a challegene. We like hot & spicy foods so we used hot picante sauce. I used spaghetti noodles insted of rice and shredded grilled chicken on top, instead of cooking it in the sauce.  Now that I have this recipe maybe we will eat spaghetti more often. Enjoy.

Pretty good stuff.  Made as is, except I didn't find a reason for the sauce to cook that long.  I started the chicken first and let it cook while getting the sauce together in another pan, by which time the chicken was nearly done.  Then dumped them together and re-used one of the pans later for the rice.  I doubt the sauce even cooked for an hour total & it worked out fine.

This was pretty good.  I put the chicken breast in the crockpot frozen and let it cook on low for about 8 hours.  I served it over rice butI think my family would have preferred it over pasta.  Will make again.

Nice easy recipe. I like that the chicken is boiled in water instead of fried in a pan since I'm watching my fat consumption.

Super!!  I thought it was just really tasty.  It was a bit spicy for my little ones so next time I will be a little less generious with the ceyenne pepper.  Will definatly make this again.  P.S. Also thought it was wonderful with rice.

I'm eating this right now and had to review.  Its just as good as mom's sauce!  I had a plethora of subs though.  Didn't like the size of the picante sauce jars(I had to 5x the recipe) so I used mild salsa.  I also used spaghetti. Finally, I ran out of chicken so I used cooked ground beef.  Yum!

This was incredibly strong tomato taste. I ate the leftovers but wonâ€™t make it again.
