If you love your green veggies, you're in for a treat. I omitted the bread and served this as a side dish with George Foreman grilled chicken breasts. I was a little worried about serving kale to my fiance for the first time but he said he liked it even better than spinach.
I can see why you would want the bread too though - the broth is awesome!

This is not a recipe I would have tried except my husband bought some kale & said "I know you'll find a good way to cook this". Well this definately was a good way to cook it! Of the 3 kale recipes I tried, this was our favorite. I didn't change a thing--we will be having it again.

I made this recipe exactly as is and everyone I've prepared it for has asked for the recipe.  Absolutely fabulous and very healthy.  Also good with roasted garlic instead of raw garlic.

Great as a MAIN dish.  i omitted the bread and served as an stewy, soupy entree.  i used canned plum tomatoes and didn't worry about seeding them, and it worked great.  i also soaked and cooked my own bans.  next time, i may simmer the garlic a LITTLE more to avoid the slightly overpowering taste of the (almost raw) garlic.  would be GREAT over chicken breasts or (dont say it!) PASTA!

I too, was looking for a creative and tasty way to prepare bland kale.  Mom & I really enjoyed this.  It was a real treat.  I pretty much stuck tot he recipe, but used spinach and kale, and topped it with sauteed semi-spicy chicken strips.  I am making this for the 2nd time now, and finally rating it. Thanks for this!

We really like this recipe - mostly because it is such a yummy way to eat kale. It has protein and fiber from the beans, too. So, five stars for food that is creative, healthy, and delicious!

I made the recipe as is and thought it was a very good meatless meal.  We will definitely be making and eating this again.  Now if only I could get the kids to eat kale.....

This was really good! I worried about the bread getting soggy, because my peasant bread (also from this site) was fresh out of the bread machine before I toasted it.  It was perfect, though! It really all goes well together.  My four year old thought the garlic rubbed on the bread made it spicy, but that was an important flavor in the dish... yum!!
