This was downright tasty.  5 stars for ease, ingredients on hand and the low amount of prep time involved.  After reading through the reviews, I consolidated the best changes and I am so glad I did.  Cooked the onions with the mushrooms and added crookneck squash (before it went bad in the fridge as I hate to waste food).  Added a 1/2 tsp of onion powder and a tbsp of hot sauce to the eggs.  Forgot to toast the english muffins, and the strata still turned out fabulous.  Served to 11 women on the last day of our Girl's Weekend and every single one of them asked for the recipe.  Now that's my idea of success!!!  Thanks Shandeen for a wonderful recipe!!!

I used Thomas' Better Start Light Multi-Grain English Muffins, 2% milk, & Kraft 2% shredded Colby-Jack cheese. It dropped the calories per serving to 270 and dropped the fat to 12 grams per serving (22 carbs, 20 grams protein).

Wow, the best new recipe I've tried in a while. This recipe prompted me to get an allrecipes sign on so I could give a rating. 5 + stars!  I halved the portions and prepared it in a 8x8 pan as suggested by another reviewer, baked for 45 minutes and it came out perfectly.  The only thing I did different than the directions was cook the onions - added them to the mushrooms when they were about 2/3 done. So simple. Would be a very impressive brunch dish.

Yum! I halved the recipe, but was generous with the seasonings. When making eggs, I always add some drops of hot sauce. It doesn't make things spicy, but definitely kicks the flavor up. I sauteed all the veggies except for the asparagus and since I used a 9x9 pan, the dish only had to cook for 35 minutes. If I made this for more people, I would definitely add some chopped ham. Thanks for the easy recipe!

This was fantastic!  I did not have any Colby Jack cheese, so I subbed in sharp cheddar instead.  What's great about this dish is that you can add any vegetables you like-it is really flexible.

Made this for my daughers graduation brunch and it was EXCELLENT! So easy to make and anytime you can make something the night before is a good thing! I used Portabello mushrooms because I couldn't find crimini...

This is the most amazing breakfast I've ever had! Moist, tender, savory.....sheer heaven in my mouth. For couples I recommend halving the recipe and using 8x8 dish as this dish is best eaten fresh out of the oven. Leftovers tend to be tough and rubbery, but still yummy!

Delicious! I chose to try this out this year for a Mother's Day brunch with my mother in law. It turned out wonderfully and everyone said it was great! I didn't have any Crimini mushrooms so I used sliced white button mushrooms, and added some sausage. My mother in law is allergic to peppers, so I omitted those and they weren't missed at all. I also used Kraft Tex Mex cheese mix and substituted the dry mustard for yellow mustard (I tripled the amount as per google directions). As per a review I added 2 extra eggs. Yum! Will definitely make this again!

Yum! We loved it. It was maybe a bit bready, so next time I would either increase the milk/egg a bit or leave out that extra English muffin that the recipe says to crumble in between.  I also would do closer to 2 C mushrooms.  The asparagus was in some cases still a bit tough, though not enough that I'd go to the trouble of steaming it first or anything.  For our second helping, we added sriracha sauce.

This is a fabulous brekkie or lunch and keeps for days.  It's even lovely cold in a picnic or to take camping and the ingredients are so adaptable.  I added bacon to mine and a selection of hard cheeses grated (just whatever was in the fridge), I also added some smoked paprika, substitued the milk for skimmed/low fat variety & grated some nutmeg on top before cooking.  This recipe is delicious and I will definitely make it again and again!

This recipe was a hit at my family get-together.  I was asked for the recipe and the entire 9 x 13" casserole was devoured in 1 sitting, with several of us wishing there was more!  I followed the suggestion of sauteeing the veggies in advance.  I used only medium cheddar.  I also added 1 tsp of sriracha hot sauce.  I was also forced to use bagels rather than english muffins, and it turned out fine!  I will definitely be making this again!

My family loved this on Christmas morning.  followed the directions exactly except I used shitake mushrooms bc I couldn't find crimini and i substituted broccoli and zucchini in place of the asparagus since I thought asparagus would be to "springy" for Christmas morning.  loved the english muffins, not soggy like bread.  will TOTALLY make again!

Made a lot of changes to use what was on hand. Halved the recipe. Used French bread slices leftover (which I should have cubed). One egg, egg substitute for the rest, steamed broccoli, chicken sausage, cheddar cheese and added a little parmesan on top for flavor. A little dry (I had too much bread) but I will make it again.

I made this for an Easter brunch and it was excellent. As most people do, I made several changes. I omitted the mushrooms, sauteed the red pepper & onion in butter, and I very quickly stuck the asparagus in boiling water - maybe 2 minutes, although I'm not sure if it's necessary to do. I used mozzarella and parmesan cheese (about 2/3 cup mozzarella and 1/3 cup parmesan), and I made 2 in different sized pans (a 6x6 and an oval pan that's maybe 10-11"), so I added 2 extra eggs and 1/2 cup milk. It took nearly an hour to bake both, but it was delicious and everyone raved about it.

Exactly what I've been looking for!  I've been wanting a vegetarian breakfast casserole and this is it.  It's so yummy that nobody misses the meat.

Overnight Asparagus Mushroom Strata Haiku: "This looked beautiful. Perfect for Christmas morning. Leftovers better." Put this strata together on Christmas Eve, with the only difference being that I sauteed the bell pepper and the onion with the mushrooms, and otherwise followed everything exactly as written. It made Christmas morning sooooo much easier, but as far as the taste goes, we all agreed that we would've 1. preferred spinach to asparagus, 2. added a couple drops of hot sauce, and 3. included a meat, such as diced ham or chopped bacon. I was; however, more blown away by how good it tasted as leftovers 2 days later. I would definitely make this again, but with some small adjustments, and I guess that's the nice thing about this recipe is that the vegetables can be swapped in and out.

This was the first time I have ever made a strata. I had searched all over the site and liked the idea of the english muffin instead of the traditional cubed day old bread. I followed the recipe exactly with exception of subbing out the asparagus for ground turkey sausage (see grandpa's coriander turkey sausage on the site- you will not be disappointed.) It was so delicious and a perfect make ahead meal when you don't want to take the time to prep in the AM but want a nice meal. You can easily change this to suit your tastes and the english muffin was a great choice. Definitely making tghis again when we have company!

My husband who doesn't like "baked egg dishes" loved this and so did the whole family.  We made our own changes using 1- 10X15 w/ 6 E. Muffins, and 1-8x8 w/ Gluten Free toasted Bread. Changes;
3/4 c bell pepper, asparagus was quick sauteed w/sherry until liquid was gone, 10 eggs, half & half instead of milk, 1 lb. herb sausage browned, drained, and twice as much organic, raw cheese. (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Swiss). Everything else was the same, but all organic.  Not too eggy, great mix, and very nice not to have to rush around this Easter morning after church.  Thanks Shandeen for sharing your Mom's 5 star recipe!

This is a good recipe, but I agree with the person who said it was a little bland. Next time I would add some minced garlic to jazz it up a bit. Maybe double the onions. Other than that, I love the asparagus and mushrooms together.

Made this for Easter brunch I was hosting and it was amazing! There were 2 other egg dishes there as well as ham and fruit salad and this was the first to go. My husband who isn't a "veggie" type guy couldn't stop eating it. I might try throwing in some artichokes or broccoli next time to get in the extra veggie I like to serve to my family. But this was a absolute keeper!

Added more eggs (12 total), doubled shredded Colby-mix cheese to 2 cups, used baby bel mushrooms, used spinach and yellow squash instead of asparagus, added 1 tsp sriracha hotsauce. Sauteed veggies and 1 onion chopped in butter before mixing together.

Don't forget to toast the muffins, otherwise it's too soggy. A little bland but would taste great with hollandaise sauce.

I am a breakfast casserole connoisseur so I was pumped to make this. I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast and it disappeared very fast. I made a few changes. I used one pound of Italian sausage and 5 Italian cheese vs. colby jack. I did away with the english muffins (all bread for that matter) and added chopped red potatoes and a little bit of baby spinach. Other than that it was FAN-tastic! Perfect temp, Perfect time, Perfect EVERYTHING! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!

This recipe was a hit with my family, will definitely make again.  I would add a little more spices, as it was a bit bland without hot sauce.

This was good!  I did not toast the muffins first, and used steamed broccoli in place of the asparagus.  I also added some cooked, chopped ham.  Tasty!

My wife and I enjoyed putting this together for Thanksgiving Brunch.  We went with the multigrain muffins and 4oz's of diced ham.  It just tasted wonderful.  We'll do it again.

My family enjoyed this and everyone wanted seconds.  This dish would be perfect for a brunch. I added the diced ham and sauted the mushrooms, onions & red bell pepper before like other viewers suggested.  We also broke open a bottle of champagne for momosa!

This is delicious! And easy. The only change I made was to add about  tablespoon of fresh chopped golden Caribbean peppers (seeds and pith removed!) which added a little interesting heat and extra cheddar cheese for the topping.

Just made this for a brunch with friends. Turned out pretty good. I added one more egg, used one cup half and half and one cup milk and added a few dashes of cayane to the egg mixture. Like other reviewers, I cooked all the veggies together before hand (even the asparagus) and I think this really helped. The muffins held up well and it was great for leftovers.

This made a delicious Christmas morning breakfast! I forgot to toast the muffins, and was only able to wedge 4.5 muffins into the pan.  I used zucchini instead of asparagus and cooked all the veggies together before putting them atop the muffins.  The was delicious and got rave reviews! I'd definitely make this again!

This is a fantastic dish! I followed the directions exactly, aside from sautéing the onions with the mushrooms. I did used about 1.5 cups of cheese on both layers, and broiled it at the end to brown it on top. I will be using this recipe again, I plan to try different toppings to change it up a bit. YUM!

My husband gave this recipe a "pretty  good" which is the best review he's ever given me!  I tweaked it a little, using English muffin bread in place of English muffins; half and half instead of milk; and not all of the asparagus.  I also added some leftover chicken and spinach brats.  It also sat longer than overnight and still came out fluffy and delicious.  Next time I plan to add more mushrooms, no salt, and some different meat.  But even without any meat, this strata would still be super!

At first the husband said 'english muffins, in a casserole?? I should half faith, right?' This was good and filling. The mushrooms disappeared to nothing - I would use the whole basket of mushrooms next time (8 oz). I think this needed seasoning and would carmelize the mushrooms with balsamic vinegar and/or add 1-2 teaspoons of Cavendar's Greek seasoning. There are overnight casserole recipes that don't really need to sit overnight, but this really did - at first the egg disappeared and I was worried it wasn't enough (the veggies were just hanging out on top), but in the oven, the casserole puffed up and beautifully, and the english muffins turned into a bread pudding of sorts.  My husband's new favorite breakfast he said! I made this for work and it made 5 days worth for each of us.  I bet this is also good with pepperjack cheese.

i typically follow recipe's to the T upon first attempt but even though i love asparagus, i didn't want any in our breakfast dish. i made this twice already. once for christmas morning (along with red velvet waffles, um YUM) and again for a birthday brunch this morning. i made half the recipe in a smaller dish since it was just for four of us. i cooked the onions, mushrooms and orange pepper. this was a big hit, so simple and my friends loved it. this is one we will be making often. next time i'll take a photo since no one has submitted one!

Made this according to the recipe with only 2 big changes. We used potato crowns on the bottom and added bacon that we had fried and chopped.  It was amazing.  I liked being able to use the veggies I had in the fridge already.  Another person suggested using squash and I had a one I needed to use along with the last of some sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  My husband raved and says it is the best I've ever made.  Thanks so much for sharing .

I made this for a church brunch and everybody loved it. It was so easy to make and much different than most breakfast casseroles.  It looks beautiful, and the taste is fabulous. I made it exactly as the recipe was written except that I used a Mexican Blend of four cheeses, including Monterey Jack. Next time I make this I will not put it on the bottom rack as it almost burnt on the bottom. Raise it to mid-oven and you'll be wowed.

I liked this a lot, and so did my guests!  I varied it slightly, using Vienna bread, and I sauteed all the veggies before adding.  Also, added some sweet pork sausage, which I had browned.

This is very good. I'm eliminating the English muffins next time to save on carbs. Didn't have a red pepper or alternate so I kicked it up with some firecracker cheese from Aldi's, YUM!

I love making this for guests coming in the morning. I can make it the night before, and it's easy the next day! Plus, it looks and tastes fantastic. I cook the onion with the mushrooms first, and I just use mustard instead of mustard seed.

Pretty good, and easy to make. I like that it doesn't have meat in it. I've only made it once and it's not something I've been itching to eat again, but it is a nice thing to make for breakfast the next morning if you have guests.

Everyone loved this in my womens bible study class.  I made it italian by using mozerella and parmesian cheese.  I added a bit of italian seasoning and also chopped up some fresh italian parlsey for the egg mixture and then sprinkled it on top.  You could really make this mexican also.  It is a great base recipe that can be changed up to suit your tastes.

Loved it! Only thing different I did was that used 3 whole-wheat English muffins (instead of 5) because I didn't stuff any muffins in the empty spaces, used cheddar cheese and 2 different types of mushrooms. I was having a big brunch so I made 2 of these and everyone liked it (except the kids who thought there was too many veggies). I'm making this recipe again next weekend.

I have a group of ladies that I play cards with twice a month and it was my turn to host.  Saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Loved being able to refrigerate it overnight and cook it the next day.  It was a big hit.  I added the suggested 1 cup of diced ham to the ingredients.  Also added a bit of chopped red bell pepper. My husband who is a bit of a fussy eater ate the rest of the leftovers and asked me to make it again. Definite 5 star recipe!

My sister made this for Easter Brunch several years ago, I remembered how this casserole was such a hit with our family that I made it for Mother's Day Brunch this year ... and it was a hit again!  Everyone loved it!  I followed the advice of some reviewers and sautéed the onions and red pepper with the mushrooms.  I think that next time I would just give the onions and red pepper a quick saute.   I think that I sautéed them for a bit too long.  My sister didn't saute the onions or red pepper, and her casserole was delicious.

I made a second casserole without the veggies.  I just added sautéed onions and sweet Italian sausage.  My hungry nephews devoured this casserole!  

Both casseroles were delicious! I had just a little bit of leftovers which were perfect for breakfast and lunch for the next few days!

This was a great hit at our Christmas brunch with the family! I added minced onion and Ms. Dash in the egg mixture, and I prepped a little early  - so that gave the egg mixture extra seasoning time. 
I also forgot to toast the English Muffins, but the crowd seemed to prefer it as is! 
Great recipe!

It’s almost a quiche....eggs, cheese, veggies...! I LOVE quiche! But without all the  hassle of making the pastry! (Store bought pie shells are  compared to the real thing!) Now We Can race to the finale with English muffins ! Thank you!

My family loved it. 
I added onions to the mushrooms while  cooking them.
I used a Tex mex grated cheese  and the family were happy with the breakfast.
Yes, I will make this again.

I am not  a morning person so I really like make ahead breakfast dishes. This casserole is easy to assemble, with ingredients that are available in most kitchens or easily substituted.. This starta was delicious.I made one change, I sautéed all the veggies before adding them to the casserole.

I love this recipe for its ease of making - the make ahead works so well on this one - and for how beautiful and delicious the finished product is! Sometimes I make it with just the veggies and other times I cook Pork sausage links and slice them and scatter on with the vegetable mix. I make this for guests for brunch and it is gobbled up!

Spring Strata was in a Taste Of Home magazine many many years ago.  The only change to this recipe was that it used cubed french bread that was left out to dry a bit.  It is outstanding!  But anything with Asparagus and Eggs is tops with me!!  Just picked my first 10 "ditch" asparagus here in Waldo,Wisconsin, 12 miles west of Lake Michigan.  A good 20 or more nubbies I need to check on tomorrow to pick.  I omitted the peppers only due to my allergy to cooked bell pepper (acid).

I had some good whole wheat bread from the bakery to use up, so I tore it into pieces and used about 5-6 cups in place of the English muffins. As other reviewers suggested, I softened up the asparagus and peppers by tossing them in the saute pan with the onions in mushrooms for a few minutes before transferring the veggie mixture to the baking dish. Super tasty. I might experiment with a sharp Cheddar or a Gruyere next time in place of the co-jack cheese.

Did not like the English Muffins,  but the asparagus, red pepper and mushroom  combo was wonderful!  Will make again with  trying hashbrowns or go back to using croutons like I have in other breakfast stradas.

I made this for Easter brunch, and it was a hit.  I used gluten free bread (Canyon Bakeries) and it turned out perfectly!  1% milk worked fine, too, as did leaving out the onions ... still very tasty.

I have made this recipe several times - usually for Christmas breakfast - and it is delicious! I have made it as written and I have made minor changes when necessary (biscuits instead of English muffins; cheddar or Pepper Jack; green chilies instead of fresh green peppers) depending on what I have in my pantry. I usually add sausage or diced ham, but not always. I also like to add a dash of cayenne pepper. It is delicious as written, but versatile for alternative tastes/needs. Does not disappoint.

My son came home from college and brought five friends, 2 of whom were vegetarian. I made this for breakfast and it was a hit with everyone. I basically followed the recipe except I substituted broccoli for the asparagus and I sautéed all the veggies as recommended by others.  I will definitely makes this again.

Loved the versatility of this dish! The asparagus was a bit crunchy so I suggest cutting it smaller or taking out and adding green onions (really any vegetables will work). I made a version with added diced ham, chopped bacon and jalapeños - it was delicious!

Good! Next time I will use cheddar cheese and a spot of hot sauce. Otherwise, excellent.

I made this for Sunday brunch today.  Very easy to put together and tasty.  I followed reviews advice and microwaved the asparagus adding some garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I used 9 eggs instead of 8 and added a dash of hot sauce.  It baked up light and flavorful.  Would recommend this recipe.

I substituted broccoli for asparagus and added diced ham.  The family really liked this.  Easy to make.  I really liked the English Muffin base.

Do NOT saute the asparagus and pepper with the mushrooms and onion as I did. Made perfect sense when I did it but the strata had no crunch, just one texture - gooey.
I also found the mustard a little too strong so I'll cut back on that next time. Nice, simple recipe.

Very good recipe.  Added ham but changed nothing. I don't like my cheese hard so I covered my dish with foil when it was baking. Just don't make it tight as the cheese will stick to it. Thank you for sharing I enjoyed this very much.

Only a minor change (used Marie Calendar's Herb Dry Stuffing cubes as I had no  English muffins).  It was delicious and got great reviews from the breakfast crowd.  Made a double recipe and had a couple of squares left over so I had them heated in the microwave next morning and it was even better!  Great, easy, no fuss recipe to feed the hungry morning group.  Take some to work for a super treat.  Easy to change out cheese choice,  veggies or add ham or bacon, etc.  A keeper.

Excellent recipe. Half my family are mushroom haters, so I  used broccoli instead. And I didn't cook or toast anything ahead. REALLY easy and really really good. Like others have said, use what you have in your crisper. Three people asked for the recipe.

My husband made this for Mother's Day brunch with my family.  It presented beautifully and tasted delicious! He followed the recipe exactly as is except that we baked it for 1 hour at 350 degrees (had the sausage and hash brown casserole in the oven at the same time-also from All Recipes!)

Delicious! I used red bell pepper, mushrooms, asparagus, onion. I cooked the veggies before adding. I used more cheese because I love cheese. You could use any kind of cheese in this recipe. Very tasty.

This was delicious...made it for Easter brunch.  Only thing I did differently was cooked the onions with the mushrooms in the skillet...Everyone loved it, and there was only a piece left over, which was good--my 85-year-old Dad got to keep it for his lunch today!

The general consensus was that there were too many veggies to egg ratio. It DOES have a TON of veggies, which I actually don't mind. I added siracha to mine. I think more cheese would have helped, too.

Definitely a keeper. Family loved it for Easter morning. I did use 10 eggs instead of 8, which it needed. Used swiss cheese and added some hot sauce to the eggs. It was perfect with the suggested veggies - asparagus, mushrooms (I used baby bellas), onions and red sweet pepper. I did saute the onions and peppers with the mushrooms.  It doesnt need the addition of meat. I made this recipe instead of the standard sausage egg and cheddar breakfast casserole i have made for years. Family said they thought they preferred this one.

The only thing I did was sauté the vegetables, including the asparagus, with the onions.  The asparagus was a little soft so next time I won't sauté it.  Book club girls enjoyed it!

While I wasn't sure about using English muffins at first, this was surprisingly delicious! We enjoyed it on Christmas morning with coffee. The only change I would make next time is that I would also sauté the onions and red pepper (maybe at the halfway point of the mushrooms) to soften them a little. They were a bit raw and crunchy for my taste but would be perfect with a little pre-cooking. I will definitely make this again.

This dish is a classic meal that would be liked by many.
I made it with all the same ingredients, but what's great about this favorite breakfast dish is that if you want to leave something out and add something else...go for it.
It's just that good!

I didn't need so much, so I reduced the recipe and put it into a pie crust instead of over muffins and made a quiche. It turned out great.

Very good recipe - got several requests for it. I put a fourth teaspoon of cayenne pepper in it for a little heat. Might try half teaspoon next time but we like hotter food. Will definitely make again.
