8.4.16   Used vanilla almond milk and fresh strawberries.  Flavor was a little weak, so in the future, I'll add more strawberries (and they'll be frozen, not fresh), and either eliminate or cut back on the ice.

It is a little bland but if you add a couple more strawberries and a little more sugar it can taste a little bit more like a Starbucks frapp

The only change I made was to use Truvia instead of sugar. Next time, I will use frozen strawberries and no ice so that the frappuccino isn't watered down.
