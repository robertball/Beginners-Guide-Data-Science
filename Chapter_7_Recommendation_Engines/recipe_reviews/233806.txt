made it in a bundt cake pan and used orange peel instead of lemon peel. Turned out great! I greased and floured the pan before baking.

I made this as a 9" 2-layer cake for my mincemeat-loving mom's 81st birthday. She (and we) LOVED it. Instead of the topping, I made a cream cheese frosting for the layers. I cut back a little on the baking time since the layers were not as dense as a single cake.

Some people love mincemeat - some don't. But,  for those who do...this is a delightful - and inventively tasty new use for the centuries old Holiday treat.

Easy, delicious, well worth getting out a springform pan. I used an 8-inch which seemed the correct size. Pretty presentation.

This cake even pleased family members who aren't crazy about mincemeat. I used my own canned mincemeat instead of the brand suggested. The cake is moist and very flavorful. I wasn't sure of the size of springform pan required, and the only ones I had are very large or 6". I used a 12" round glass dish instead. Baking took about 15 minutes longer, probably because of this. Even a few days old, the cake is still tender and delicious.

I absolutely loved this cake! I made it as written the first time but the second time, I used less mincemeat in the cake and omitted the topping. I did not care too much for the topping, but it was still really good. Each time the cake did not last a day between my son and I :)
