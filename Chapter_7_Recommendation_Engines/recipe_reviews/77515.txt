The sauce in the recipe, when reduced down and thickened is a wonderful accompaniment to the salmon. I've made this twice, the first time I had no orange marmalade, but did have apricot preserves. Both worked out excellently.
My hubby prefers the apricot flavor over the orange. It seems to detract from the salmon flavor alot less than the orange.

Perfect! The only change I made was that I used a 2.5 pound peice of salmon on the grill instead of smaller fillets. I put the salmon on the bed of rice and drizzled a little leftover glaze on it. This made a beautiful, tasty and healthfull lunch. I will definately make this again!

Delicious! I confess that I made a lot of changes, just based on what I had on hand and my husband's preferences. I had no sesame anything, so just used grapeseed oil. I had no scallions, so did no after-cooking topping. Because of my husband's preferences, I omitted the ginger and garlic (which I thought might be a bit strong for salmon anyway). Also, I baked instead of grilled, for simplicity's sake. But all that said, I think the heart of the recipe is the marmalade-soy sauce-oil-vinegar glaze, which is delicous and keeps the salmon moist. A keeper recipe, good for 2 or company.

Fantastic recipe!  I have only recently decided to change my eating habits and adding salmon to my diet was one of the things I decided to do - even though I don't really like it!  This has sold me on salmon though, i never realised it could taste so great!  Can't wait to have this again!

My husband and I love this recipe. It is prepared in no time and tastes just delicious. I have been making this dish at least once a month for the last 1.5 years and we never get tired of it. Thanks for a great recipe.

excellent, it's like an orange-teriyaki sauce.  I had this on tuna steaks and it was wonderful.

I thought this was too orangy.  There wasn't a balance of flavors like in the Grilled Salmon with Ginger-Orange Glaze from this site.  Also, I didn't think the flavors complimented the fish very well.  Thanks anyway.

Excellent! Since it was only me tonight I had to scale the marinade down to suit 1 serving. I increased the grated ginger because I like the ginger taste and I also wanted to taste it with the orange marmalade. I marinated the salmon in the sauce for a while hoping it would soak up the sauce. I took a detour from the cooking method. Rather than grilling I chose to bake the salmon in the sauce wrapped in an aluminum foil. I baked the salmon at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, then uncovered the foil, turned off the oven and let it sit for few more minutes. The smell of orange and ginger was a nice fragrance emanating from the oven. I garnished the salmon with a little minced green onions and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. The salmon was moist, tender and flaky. The marmalade sauce, which baked with the salmon, thickened up nicely, leaving me just a heaping spoonful to pour over my salmon.  It has an orange-y slightly sweet taste but not a strong "sugary" sweet. I like the overall balance of flavors. The sweet orange marmalade marinated with the ginger, garlic and soy sauce all worked well. It gave this a nice Asian twist. I enjoyed this along with, "Simple Herb Rice," also from this website.

I loved this recipe!! My husband was late from work and he picked up a few ingredients (that I didn't have) on his way home. We were eating within 20 minutes! (I had been thawing the salmon for 3 hours). I used apricot preserves instead of orange marmalade (he couldn't find any) and just added a splash of orange juice. Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty close. We grilled it on tin foil sprayed lightly with canola spray, so the skin didn't stick, and I boiled the leftover sauce to drizzle on top of the salmon after. The skin wasn't crispy at all, but that was a cooking problem, not recipe. He also brought home some rotten asparagus :/ so I came up with a Plan B and threw together a ginger side salad that I will post to the site soon :) Served with 90 minute, Uncle Ben's Wild Rice that tasted great with the sauce. My husband LOVED it, and so did I :)

This is a great recipe! I made a foil tent and put extra sauce so the salmon really cooked in it. I also kept about half of the sauce and reduced it on the stove then spooned it over the salmon when it was done. Awesome and SUPER easy recipe!!

I made this for company and they raved over it.  I didn't have orange marmalade so substituted orange juice concentrate sweetened with equal amont of honey.  Turned out stellar!

Easy enough for every day; special enough for company.  I made the glaze (less than called for, as suggested in other reviews) several days prior to serving, and baked the salmon about 15 minutes at 375 degrees.

Best salmon ever! I marinated for 15 min. in the orange glaze and it was super! Very juicy & will be doing this again. We also used orange-cherry marmalade & it was amazingly good, thanks poster.

Made it with peach preserves and ginger powder. Was amazing. Left some sauce over after glazing and put it on the stove to cook down -- got this great thick caramelized flavor. We grilled it -- one of my new fav. recipes.

I really liked the glaze, and I made sure to save some to drizzle over the top of the finished fish. I made this with my Foreman grill and I think I overcooked the salmon, so I can't wait to try it this summer on a real grill. Thanks for the recipe.

Another salmon recipe from allrecipes to add to my repertoire. I used salmon steaks, brushed the glaze on both slides, and let them sit for 1/2 hour before cooking on the barbeque. The only adjustment I made to the glaze was to use 2 tbsp of white rice vinegar and 1 tbsp of orange juice. Good flavour.

I grill a LOT of salmon year round, usually on a plank. The result of this recipe was a complete surprise. My whole family enjoyed it and they don't ofen care much for dishes with orange marmalade due to the rind.  I did create a bit of a rub for the salmon which included a bit of kosher salt, paprika, cayenne to taste, and fresh ground black pepper. I put the orange glaze over this just before putting on the plank which was already smoking on the grill.  This is a keeper and one I'll make again soon.

My husband and I have salmon about once a week and I was looking for a different way of serving it from our usual.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I ran short of white vinegar and had to use about half cider vinegar) and it was SUPERB!!! I will make this again and again and will definitely serve it to company!

A delicious glaze for salmon. Everyone really liked it. I saved the leftover glaze and used it on chicken on the BBQ. Yum

Thought this was going to be better. Interesting to try, but doubt I would make it again. I had to reduce the sauce to get it to thicken up because it was a little on the thin side. I baked in a foil packet.

I used the glaze recipe, but plank grilled the salmon.  Was my first time plank grilling, but between the plank and the glaze, this was a major hit!  I went straight by the recipe for making the glaze, and put a couple coats on as it cooked.  Not overpowering, but enough flavor to make everyone end dinner with a smile.

I think this dish might have rated 5 stars if the fish had a chance to marinade in the orange glaze for several hours (to give the glaze a chance to penetrate the flesh a little bit).  I followed the recipe exactly, except I quadrupled the garlic.  I'll make this again, but allow the fish to rest in the glaze in the fridge overnight.

I made this salmon for dinner tonight and the end result was pretty good.  I made the recipe as it was written and we found the glaze to have a very light flavor.  A quick, easy way to use salmon, we liked it.

This was just ok, nothing special.  I have made tons of salmon recipes from this site and so I was expecting this one to be great also.  Sorry but it was disappointing.  Thanks anyways!

Very good, close to five stars. I used sugar-free marmalade with no problems. Nice and sweet, and couldn't really taste the vinegar. Not too tangy at all. Went surprisingly well with mashed potatoes.

Healthy, tasty and special.  Used powdered ginger which was still quite good.  We also used a fish grilling wire "basket" utensil brushed with oil to prevent sticking.  Boiled 1/4 cup reserved sauce 2 min in micro to thicken and served over fish.  Idea: double the sauce so you have some to spoon over rice, too.

These flavours are delicious with grilled salmon.  I used salmon steaks (not fillets) and I greased the grill first.  Have the grill fairly hot. A good indicator that the salmon is done is that the skin pulls away easily from the salmon.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and garden salad.  Yummy dinner!

I LOVED this.  Hubby thought it was good...but since I do the reviews....I win.  I didn't change anything.  Hubby thought there was a little too much orange and ginger...wanted to taste more of the salmon.  I thought it was perfect.  Thanks for the post....will make again.

Made this for my wife and mom.  Wife & I loved it as a change to grilling which I normally do.  My mom on the other hand thought it was too sweet.  She is the traditional type that's wants just lemon wedges to squeeze over the fish.

I made this for the first time a few years ago, my daughters who do not like fish at all and a friend and her children who don't like fish loved this. I really like it as well, and normally I can not eat salmon. I am trying this on my boyfriend this week to see how he likes it.

Delicious! I prepared the sauce as written but cooked it in the oven;it turned out just right! The only thing I would change is to marinade the fish in the sauce for at least 20mins before cooking just to infuse the flavor a little more.

great flavor, but should have reduced it down to thicken it a bit. would like to try this with apricot or peach preserves instead of the orange, which was a little bitter.

I added a cup of orange juice to this, and boiled it down a bit.  I removed about half a cup to use for the glazing, then served the rest to pour over the salmon and the rice I served it on.  I did not add the garlic.

Very good. Added a bit extra marmalade and vinegar, as I only had dark sesame oil and the strong flavor was a little overpowering. Otherwise, outstanding. Hubby and kids all loved it, no leftovers!!

Really loved this recipe - it complemented the taste of the salmon, rather than overpower it.  We used wild Coho salmon with skin on one side, grilled on a cedar plank.  Just before putting on the grill, we brushed the salmon (on the skinless side) with the glaze.  Didn't bother with the optional toppings.  Also, used ground ginger instead of fresh grated. All summer long we've been trying different glazes and rubs for cedar plank-grilled salmon and this one is definitely the best we've had.

I loved this recipe.  The orange flavor was very subtle and complimented the salmon instead of overwhelming it.

I grilled it on mats and when the sauce reduces down a little it is ready to serve.  Delicious

Absolutely delicious!! The sauce is outstanding!! I made this in a power outage for dinner and served it over brown rice with a side of steamed broccoli. My husband asked where did I order take out from, it was that good. Due to food allergies I substituted olive oil for the sesame oil and omitted the sesame seeds & followed the remaining portion of the recipe as written.  My salmon had the skin on so I grilled it skin side down for 5 minutes then flipped and grilled the other side for 2-3 minutes. Adding this to our summer dinner rotation.

I make salmon every week and have been looking for a new recipe to add to my collection.  This was perfect!
I used low sugar apricot jam instead of the orange glaze and omitted sesame seeds (not a fan). I used about 4 T. of chopped white onion.   I marinated 1-1/2 pounds of salmon in the sauce, setting aside some to spoon on top after.  I grilled the fish and spooned the sauce on after.  Great find - thanks!

It was OK, but I doubt we'll make this again. Flavors weren't harmonized and I agree with other comments that salmon isn't the best choice for these ingredients, at least to our palate.

Tasty orange and soy flavored salmon. Good and a bit different....could have used more garlic and a bit of shallots on top to add some taste!

I did not have any sesame oil but otherwise followed the recipe, using a reduced sugar orange marmalade. I made a full batch of sauce for use one two pieces of salmon with the leftovers used to drizzle over quinoa. This was decent and gave a much needed boost to the rather plain flavored quinoa (quinoa with Asian flavors from AR). I brushed on a healthy amount of the sauce on the salmon then refrigerated for about an hour and a half (dinner got delayed) which added to the flavor. I chose to bake the salmon at 400 for about 18 minutes instead of grilling.  If you do this, make sure to line your baking pan with foil for an easier cleanup.  A very easy recipe that looks like you spent a lot of time on it.

We made this exactly as written and Hubby and I agree with the last review. Just a little too bland for our tastes.  Overall, not bad- just missing that special something.  You know, that "smack". I think we might try this again, but if we do we're going to have to try to oil, salt and/or pepper the fillet first.

This was very delicious, very flavorful. 
When grilled everything stayed on, the little bits of ginger and marmalade didn't drip off. Only thing is, I'd omit the sesame oil next time, a bit to strong for my taste.
