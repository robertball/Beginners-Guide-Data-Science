The hubs and I are trying to eat healthier. I know we need more fish, but I am not crazy about it. This recipe, however, is good enough to make me look forward to having it again! It even looks pretty. I didn't have capers or jalapenos, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Hubs said "Keeper!"  I love black olives, but in this recipe, if you don't have any on hand, don't bother with a grocery run to get them.

I've made this salad three times and loved it each time. I did not tweak the recipe. . .just made it as-is the first two times. The third time I used Dover Sole instead which was just as good. I posted a photo which you may be able to see above. It is missing the tomato and celery unfortunately. My husband was on a diverticulitis diet at that moment so we omitted these two ingredients. It was still quite a lovely recipe even without them. Next time I will use cod just to have some variety in the fish we are consuming. My husband and family also love this new favorite. It is easy to prepare - the timing mixes well with preparations for other courses.

I made this once before and am making it again today.  It is way off the charts for sodium because of the capers but they were so good in the recipe I wouldn't leave them out, the recipe wouldn't be as good without them.  Also instead of celery & diced tomatoes I used Pico de Gallo.
