This had a wonderful appearance and taste. I used a little bit less Gorgonzola than it called for and it still had a strong taste. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese since that is what I had on hand. I think a little chicken, sausage or ground meat would work fine in this dish, not that it needs protein.

I don't like cottage cheese or ricotta, so I googled cheese substitutions.  I basically mixed mozzarella, parmesan, and gorgonzola together, making sure the ratio was about the same.  This is soooo flipping good.  I've made it twice in the past few months.  I also substituted almonds for walnuts because it's what I had, and panko breadcrumbs for regular breadcrumbs - again, because it's what I had.  I don't have an oven (woo weird NYC apartments), so did this in my toaster oven.  Played with time an temperature a bit, but still as good as I wanted it to be.  Have fun, experiment - this is a great starting recipe!

Made some minor adjustments:  pureed squash, sage, garlic & onion then mixed w/ cottage cheese.  Used NF ricotta, 1 egg & gorgonzola as another layer.  Skipped walnut topping & served with crispy sage leaves in brown butter . . . delish!

My kids didn't like this, but my husband and I thought it was pretty good. I think the gargonzola cheese was too much for them.

Delicious and easy to make (other than peeling the butternut squash).  Would definitely make again.

The product ended up being slightly soupier than I had expected, perhaps should have either drained the cottage cheese or less of the broth milk mixture.

I think this would be better with way less cottage cheese, and more gongonzola.

This was a great dish for a cool fall night with friends. Everyone, including the picky eaters, went back for seconds.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth so that the dish was vegetarian. I will probably halve the breadcrumb topping the next time I make it.

This was a very good recipe. I made it for Mothers' Day in conjunction with a meat lasagne. My only negative is that it didn't have as much bite as I thought it would from the gorgonzola cheese. I will definitely make it again.

Just seems like a lot of starch...pasta and butternut squash.  Flavors were good.

This was delicious! Beautiful, creamy, and with a subtle blue cheese tang. The squash I had was a bit small, so I chopped up a zucchini I had on hand and threw it into the roasting pan. I also omitted the honey (because I forgot to add it), but I didn't miss the sweetness. The leftovers are fantastic as well. Will definitely make this again!
