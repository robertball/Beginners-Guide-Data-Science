Very very good... but I have a couple of concerns with the recipe.  There was no way this amount of spinach and cheese would fit into a deep dish pie plate.  I figured that ahead of time (thank goodness).  I ended up making it in a 2q round casserole dish.  Fit perfectly.  Also, I had no idea how to use phyllo dough.  My bad... but all in all, I used the amount stated for each layer and still had more than half a package left.  Other than those concerns, no problems with recipe.  I did tweek it a little.  I added garlic to the spinach, mushroom, onion saute.  (used baby portabellos).  Then I added about 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the cheese filling.  I added a dash or two of garlic powder to the butter when I melted it.  This was a heavenly dish.  Husband raved and had two helpings, which he never does.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

We liked this recipe a lot - it was tasty and had a beautiful presentation. However, the nutmeg was a bit overpowering and we will omit it next time.

Definitely needs additional spices!  I also wish that it had been more mixed, instead of all the cheese and then all spinach, but that could just be me.  If you're looking for a baking dish - this was a little too much for an 8 x 12 x 2 Pyrex.

Very good. I used grape tomatoes b/c I couldn't find any good looking spinach, you could use any veggies you like and it would turn out fabulous. I only baked for 45 min and it was done.

MY HUSBAND LIKE THIS DISH VERY MUCH.  I THINK NEXT TIME I MAKE IT I WILL NOT USE THE FILLO PASTRY. I WOULD TRY SOME OTHER CRUST. IT HAD A VERY GOOD FILLING.

I used an 8x14 pan. The phyllo fit perfectly. I'll chop the onion and mushrooms fine next time. I'd also add more spices. It was still quite tasty. It also took only about half the time to bake.

We did not care for this pie.  It lacked flavor, it was very bland.  Looked like a good side dish but wasn't very good.  Will not make again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Definitely too much to fit in a deep dish pie plate. Used a 9 x 12 inch Pyrex baking dish. Baked it at 350 degrees in a convection oven and it was done in about 50 minutes. It was okay but not outstanding. The ricotta cheese mixture was a little bland and, I felt, a little dry. Still this could serve as a good base recipe. If I make this again, I'd change the proportions, using less ricotta and more feta. Also might add some garlic.

As others have said, it is “okay” if you make it exactly according to the recipe. However, we added chopped fresh garlic and more parmesan and salt.

This was great.... i had never baked with the Phillo paper but it turned out heat! I did not use fresh spinach, I used frozen spinach (thawed drained thoroughly). Next time I may add some shredded cheddar cheese just for more color! Tasted amazing too with a little salt and pepper. to prevent the crust from over cooking, I wrapped the edge with tin foil until the last 5 minutes.

Needed way more spices! I added mixed spices by way of Olive Garden Mixed Spice that includes SALT and other spices. Loved it with that additional perk.

Very good!  Was a family hit. I  Sautéed the spinach instead of steaming and drained it really well. I also seasoned it, and the onions and mushrooms to pull out the flavor. For the feta, I used the herbed “tomato and basil”.  Will definitely make again!

It needed fresh lemon juice ovoo and lots of Mediterranean Spices.  I added them minus the mushroom because I hate mushrooms.  It was pretty good though I might use a different crust next time. It was super bland without spices and lemon juice
