My whole family loved this, even my three picky kids!  My husband said it tasted like a restaurant quality meal.  The only thing I did differently was mixed the sour cream in with all the other ingredients rather than layer it.  I also added about a dozen quartered meatballs.  This is definitely a keeper!

I used only a 46 oz jar of Prego mushroom spaghetti sauce and an entire block of cream cheese.  This was easy, creamy, saucy, and delicious. I also made meat balls to go with it.  I will add this to my regular recipe list, but will probably try fat free cream cheese and sour cream next time since it's so high in fat.

Quick and very simple recipe for a night when you are short of time.  I followed the recipe exactly other than also adding a little pepperjack cheese.

This was delicious! Like another poster, I added the sour cream right into the sauce instead of layering it.  I also added cooked Morning Star Veggie Crumbles to the sauce for some texture and "meat." It was a hit!

I added Italian sausage to mine and I think it made a world of difference. I also just mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering and it worked just fine. My guests and family couldn't get enough! Creamy and delicious.

I doubled the recipe w/ my fingers crossed, so that we'd have leftovers. We weren't disappointed!! Super recipe, albeit not exactly super low fat, but awesome for meatless Mondays as well!!  We're not big mushroom fans, so I halved the amount & sauteed them first (dry saute) to eliminate the mushiness. However, they add just the right amount of flavor to this recipe.  I also added a large onion, finely chopped into saute mixture with garlic and used 2 c. of boullion (used cubes) rather than broth. Yum!

I made the recipe as per instructions. However,  I followed other reviewers suggestions and simply put the whole dish together instead of layering it. I was really tasty and it came out well. The only change I am going to make next time is that I am going to double the sauce and make it in a larger pan. There just wasn't enough sauce for all of the ziti. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

I have made this many times and a few variations of this. It is a very forgiving recipe if you mix it up a bit. I used yogurt instead of sour cream one time and it worked well. Same with using tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. It all works well.

This recipe was great! All five in my family ate it happily, which doesn't happen real often around here. The cream cheese and sour cream gave the sauce a smooth texture that tasted wonderful. I did add some Italian sausage just because my boys aren't big on vegetarian meals, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. The prep is nice because it was easy and quick, so this works well for a weeknight meal too.

I loved this.  Really good.  Almost better than my traditional baked ziti recipe.  I do use a full 8 oz cream cheese and a bit less sour cream than called for.  I've done this both with and without the tomatoes and I think I prefer without.  Great recipe though.

Made it for dinner party of six.  Well received. I added 12 oz sausage for a meaty sauce. Served it with a side dish of asparagus, Caesar salad and garlic toast. Nice and easy. Loved the creamy texture.

This was by far the best, creamiest, and cheesiest baked ziti recipe i have ever made! I absolutely LOVED it and it was so simple. I did not use as much sour cream in the middle layer, though. I did, however, use the entire 8 oz. package of cream cheese and added a bit of water to the sauce to clean it out. To also added small cut up pieces of soppresata to it. Might add ground beef or sausage next time. AWESOME!

My daughter said it was ok, but was much better with pepperonis thrown in.  Also, we are folks who don't like bland and a couple of reviews had mentioned it was bland.  So I added about a tsp of dried minced onion and about a tsp of garlic powder to the sauce.  Also mixed the sour cream into the sauce.  Will make again with pepperoni chunks incorporated.

I have made this recipe twice. First time I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was wonderful. Second time I added the sour cream directly to the sauce instead of layering it, used 12 oz of shredded mozzarella and also added 1.5 lbs of cooked chorizo, my family went crazy over it!! Will definitely put this recipe in our dinner rotation from now on. Thank you!

I made it just like the recipe except I took advice from some of the reviews and just added the sour cream to the mix instead of layering it. I think next time I will either add sausage or ground beef to it. Was very good tho.

Very easy and very good. The only changes I made was to add a pound of mild Italian sausage that I browned, drained and that is the pot I used to make the sauce in. I did not layer the dish but just added the grated cheese here and there as I spooned it into the dish reserving 1/3 of it for the top. Gently tomato flavor which did not upset my GERD. I can have my Italian and sleep at night too!

I’ve been making this for a few years exactly as written except I do add 1lb. of cooked Italian sausage and mix in the sour cream with the sauce. I layer in the mozzarella and sprinkle Parmesan on top. This is one of our favorite family meals.

I've made this quite a few times and the basic recipe is delicious.  We like things a little fancier in our house, so I added a pound of Italian sausage, a diced onion, and 8 ounces of baby bella mushrooms.  I also mix everything together and then top it with a bit more mozzarella instead of layering it.  This recipe is pretty much foolproof.

I made this exactly as written.  It was tasty but not enough sauce for the amount of pasta.  I wonder if it should be 4 cups COOKED pasta instead of uncooked.

I added shredded chicken to it for a hit of protein. I needed to add more chicken as this makes a lot for a 3 person family. One batch is enough for at least 3 meals for my family. Good to make and freeze.

It was delicious. I browned up some hamburger and added the cheese and sauces to this with some of the cheese. I missed it all together with the cooked noodles and then added cheese on top and baked it.

This is the best Baked Ziti that I’ve ever had!   Since it was for a Large Family Dinner I kind of added my spin by browning ground beef and mild Italian Sausage drained and added to sauce mixture. OMG GOOD!!

This is an excellent recipe; Don't skip adding the can of diced tomatoes (I used fire roasted) like I almost did.  Really lended a lot to this dish. 
 One change for our family - I substituted the same amount of ricotta cheese for the cream cheese.  More authentic!  We really loved this dish and will make again.  Thanks!

Awesome!  I added 1 lb of mild Italian sausage, 1 teaspoon each of dried basil, oregano, fennel seed, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder plus a few dashes of dried red pepper flakes to sauce before simmering.  Turned out great.  Everyone loved it

As-is, this is a 4-star but with some tweaks it could easily be 5.  I didn't find this to be bland at all.  I think it has to do with the sauce.  I used a tomato, onion, & garlic chunky pasta sauce, so I think that added flavor. I do feel like it was too much cream cheese though.  Mainly I would lower the cream cheese by 1-2 oz (for full recipe).  I'd also add in some more veggies, like diced bell pepper.  We liked this enough to make it again with tweaks.

Giving 4 stars because I tweaked it to make it closer to a recipe that I grew up on. Instead of marinara I used 26-30oz of tomato sauce/puree and I used 3 cups of shredded extra* sharp cheddar in place of the mozzarella and left out the parmesan along with the sour cream entirely. Dinner was a success

I used the whole brick of cream cheese.  That made the sauce too think.  It was still really good though.  I will make it again but I will follow the recipe next time with one exception.  I added about 2 cups of spinach to it.  I will do that again.

Amazing!!! I only leave a review for recipes that are simply mouth watering. You will not be disappointed with this one. Everyone ate seconds and loved this dish.  I read the reviews prior to making so like most, I added the sour cream in the sauce mixture. I used fresh Roma tomatoes because I had them on hand. I added some extra garlic to the sauce because I love it and can't get enough garlic in my life. Who can? It is almost 3am and I'm up with our baby. All I can think about is this dish calling my name from the fridge!

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. My husband liked it so well he ate seconds. I think he was very surprised by the creaminess. This will become a new regular in our family meals. The best part is that the recipe utilizes ingredients I normally have on hand.

I love this recipe and so has everyone that I've fed it to! I have made it quite a few times now and have altered it slightly.

I add a pound of cooked ground beef to the sauce, diced tomatoes, and cream cheese mixture. I season the beef with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Additionally by request of my boyfriend, I add a can (or whats left after eating a few) of sliced olives to the sauce. I enjoy it with and without olives, but either way it tastes delicious!! 

Very creamy and hearty. Very easy and delicious.

Great recipe. I used half the cream cheese and sour cream and NO tomatoes (forgot).  I too mixed all the ingredients before baking and added a pinch of salt and pepper. Family loved it!!!

We loved this!  I had some leftover pasta sauce from a previous dish that had a little beef meat in it, so I used that.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly besides that I mixed the sour cream into the sauce to make it easier.  Will definitely make again!
