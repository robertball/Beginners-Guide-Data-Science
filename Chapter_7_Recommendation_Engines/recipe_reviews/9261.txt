I made this punch for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Those who tried it liked it, it was a little "tangy" but that was the best part.  I did not add the food coloring and my color was still bright red.  The only thing I didn't like about this punch was that the lemonade concentrates I used had some lemon pulp in them and that floated to the top of the punch bowl and almost looked like dust had gotten in there. I used Minute Maid Pink Lemonade and also MM Raspberry Lemonade, which were great except for the pulp.  This is one of the tastiest punch recipes I've tried.

My guests enjoyed this punch. Even a 9-year old who first wanted something else decided he liked it enough to drink several cups full. The recipe isn't clear whether you add the water for the concentrates or not. I added it otherwise it is strong.

Not a keeper.  I made this for a party and was in a panic trying to fix it.  The punch bowl was left empty but not because everyone loved it, the glasses were just abandoned on the table full of punch.  It looks good but the taste was too sour no matter what I did.  I will not make this again.  I gave it three stars because the kids 6 and under loved it.

Very Kid Friendly!  All 30 of them at my son's school party enjoyed this punch.  The only thing the asked about was the "little floaties" and had a hard time convincing a few of the kids that it was the pulp from the lemonade.

I served this for my Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it! I didn't use the food coloring, though it was still plenty red. I will definately use this recipe for future dinners.

I made this for a Baby Shower and I guess the guests enjoyed it because the punch bowl was left empty.  I was told it was a bit tangy, so I added sugar before serving it.  I also did not care for the floating pulp but did not get any negative feedback regarding it.  I don't think you need the red food coloring because it seemed red enough, but if you want a darker punch, I'm sure it would be okay.

I didn't enjoy this recipe. It tasted like Hawaiian Punch with carbonation and pineapple juice added in.

I made this punch for a girls' night.  It was tasty, and most everyone complimented on it being good.  I used regular lemonade because that's what I had on hand.  I also used the Juicy Juice fruit punch (lighter in color than other fruit punch).  My punch wasn't red at all, and it could be because of the ingredients I used.  It looked like cider or cloudy apple juice.  I didn't add the red food coloring.  I might next time just to make it a little more visually appealing.

Update: Made again on 8/4/11. I added 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring and it was just the right color! A tablespoon of food coloring is too much!

Great punch.  A little tangy, but with ice it is delicious.  I didn't use the red food coloring.  I added frozen fruit for a festive look and a great finish.

Fantastic punch!  We added some lemon-lime soda to it to give it a little sweetness and some sparkle.  We adults also discovered it makes a nice adult beverage when you add a little vodka to your cup.  We particularly enjoyed the blueberry vodka with it, but also tried (and liked) citrus vodka with it and plain vodka.

I made this for a potluck lunch at work. I was worried it would be too sweet with the fruit punch so I substituted it with cranberry juice instead (and left out the red food coloring) and it was delicious. It was still sweet but also had some tartness. It was a real crowd pleaser!

I am not a punch person at all...until now. Our ice maker broke so we had to serve it room temp and it still was a hit. We did not use frozen lemonade/pink lemonade. We used one package of crystal light lemonade and pink lemonade per batch.

I would think there are better punch recipes than this one.  Made the punch for our Christmas holiday and 3/4 of it was still remaining the next day.
