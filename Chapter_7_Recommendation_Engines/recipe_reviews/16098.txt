Fabulous -- and this from a long-standing broccoli hater! :)  Instead of raisins, please use halved seedless red grapes.  Have tried both and the grapes are so much better (to us, at least)...in fact, I always add extra.  I recommend making this the night before in order for the flavors to meld.  You may want to add half the bacon when you make the salad and the rest just before serving so that the salad picks up the bacon flavor but you still get a bit of crunch from the other half of bacon.  I use Splenda for the dressing and you can't tell the difference.  We did not care for the sunflower seeds.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!  *UPDATE* Feb 2008 -- Wanted to pass along that I tried using FROZEN baby broccoli florets.  Worked great!  Bring a pot of water to boil and drop the florets in.  Remove as soon as water returns to a boil so the broccoli doesn't lose its crispy texture, then immediately submerge in ice water.  Simply just thawing or microwaving for a short time might work even better if you want to retain more crunch.  I prefer a little less crunch while hubby likes it very crunchy...I try to find a happy medium. :)  If you catch the frozen pkgs when they're buy one get one, could save a little money as well...fresh broccoli can be very expensive.  Just be sure to use a quality brand if you try frozen.  I used two 1 lb pkgs and made 2x times the dressing (also used extra grapes, onion and bacon).  We LOVE this recipe! :-)

What defines taste for this recipe? What can you substitute for what?
1. Keep red onion. Do not substitute it.
2. Keep bacon. You can use more bacon then requested, still be fine.
3. Raisins. I like Jumbo White raisins. Please do not use those little brown once. You need sweet-sour taste. So as previous reviewers said: you can use red grapes, halved; you can use craizins. Sweet-n-Sour!
4. Sunflower seeds or roasted almonds - doesn't matter. They both taste good in this salad. Add them before serving, so they retain cranchinnes.
5. And dressing.
For dressing you can substitute Real Mayo for Light or for extra Light or for Sour Cream+Mustard+LemonJuice+Salt. Really does not make any difference. You can substitute sugar for Splenda. You can use Red Wine Vinegar.
The taste should be sweet-salty and a little sour.
What important is the amount. If you use too little - it'll be too dry. If you use to much - it'll be soup. Add the dressing gradually. Remember that after a night in refrigirator it is going to absorb some fluid.

Now - if you do substitutions for Mayo, make sure this thing has salt in it, because if not and you use raisins... they will become grapes again :-), and sometime quite huge grapes.

I have been making this for years, using slightly different amounts of the ingredients.  (4 cups broccoli, 1 cup raisins, 1 cup sunflower seeds, 1/2 cup sweet red onion & 8 slices bacon for the salad.  For the dressing:  1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 T. vinegar) My suggestion to those who say the broccoli is too "crunchy": I always mix up all of the salad ingredients the night before I serve this.  The bacon "softens" the broccoli.  I mix up the dressing ingredients separately, in another bowl, and add a couple of hours before serving to let the flavors blend.  And I suggest using "real bacon", but I know we're all busy people.  Always delicious...have had so many requests for this salad people pay me to make it for graduations, weddings, etc.

This is a good recipe, but I don't think everyone made it right.  A few reviewers mentioned the bacon and the sunflower seeds getting soft.  The recipe states to put them in right before serving.  This leaves them nice and crunchy and gives the salad a nice balance.

You have to use red grapes instead of raisins.  Cut the grapes in half and add to the salad.  My mom has been  serving this recipe in her tea house for years and always get tons of requests for it.  Everywhere I bring it to I have to hand out the recipe.  Please use fresh grapes though it makes all the difference in the world.

This is good. I have taken this recipe to many functions. Everyone loves it! For variety, I eliminate the raisins and sunflower seeds and use red seedless grapes, halved and toasted almond slivers. Yummy!I get lots of requests for the recipe even from my husbands fishing buddies!

This has been one of my favorite salads for a couple of years.  I'm not a raisin fan, but in this salad, with the blend of the onion, the bacon, and the sweet-sour dressing, the taste is wonderful.  The only thing I do differently is use pine nuts.  I prefer the flavor of pine nuts, and they are larger and don't seem to stick to the bowl as much as the sunflower seeds do.  I have even used sliced almonds as well.

This stuff is awesome.  I didn't like raw broccoli before now, but now this is my favorite vegetable dish.  I made it with red seedless grapes, cut in half, instead of raisins (in the amount of 2X the raisins that the recipe calls for).  I also used prepared bacon crumbles, the kind that come in a plastic pouch, intended as a salad topping; and low-fat mayonnaise.  Be sure to use white wine vinegar--I think it makes a big difference.  I think you could add just about any fruit, or maybe some white chicken chunks for a complete meal.  I'm going to try it with chicken and diced apple next time.

Make this; I think you'll like it!

I have now made this twice and both times it was great! I made some for me at home the first time( I am 5 months pregnant and get cravings!), the second was for a potluck at work. Everyone loved it! I do recommend making the dressing 24 hours in advance and letting it all meld together, this definetly makes for a wonderful flavor. Also, letting everything (besides the seeds and bacon) refrigerate for a few hours once you DO stir in the dressing really lets the dressing soak into the broccoli. I just add the bacon and sunflower seeds right before serving and then mix it all up. This is definetly one of my favorite recipes from this site and I don't even like raw broccoli!!

I make this all the time for my friends and always go home with an empty bowl. I would say that three small heads would equal a large head of broccoli...now that I'm typing this I'm realizing that's not very helpful is it? This is what I do: I chop the broccoli and then add the mayonnaise sauce, telling myself I probably won't use it all. I personally like to use the leftover sauce on a sandwich (have to eat it right away though since the sauce is a bit runny and will soak through the bread). Also, about cutting the broccoli, are you cutting it into florets (the little individual heads) or chopping it fine? You just need to chop the little heads off and is pretty quick. For big florets you can chop them in half to make them bite sized. Hope this helps!

My kids devour this salad!  I used "craisins" instead of raisins.. they are a great alternative.  I also added a dash of garlic powder to the dressing.  Oh yah.. I don't think you need quite a cup of mayo (although I am not a huge mayo fan.. it is much better in this recipe than miracle whip..) I only use about a half cup and then add milk to thin it.  I used balsamic vinegar because it's all I had.  I hardly ever have left-overs when I make this.. and we have it at least once a week.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Every time I make this I print out a few copies because everyone that tries it asks for the recipe.  That way I can just hand it over.  I am always asked to make this for potluck bbqs.  I leave out the bacon for less fat and use red wine vinegar.  Love it

YUM!!! I had been looking for a recipe like the Deli Broccoli salad I enjoy. THIS IS IT, YAY! My husband said he could have used lighter on the red onions, but I LOVED IT JUST THE WAY IT WAS. I can see how you can change this to your own taste. THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE to start with. LIKE IT as is and LIKE it if you change per your favorite taste! GREAT RECIPE, DO TRY!

I usually just buy this from a grocery store but thought I'd try your recipe for the holiday weekend. I adjusted some of the amounts a bit and it came out great. I used 5 cups of bite size broccoli, 3 Tbl sugar, only 1 TBL vinegar and only 1/2 c. sunflower seeds. I also tried the already cooked bacon and heated it up to get a bit more crisp,worked out good. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Great recipe!  Huge hit with the family at Thanksgiving - both my aunt and mom asked for the recipe.  A few tips:  slice the bacon in narrow strips before cooking to avoid having to crumble the hot, greasy bacon.  Also, I lightly steamed the broccoli to take the raw 'edge' off.  Be sure not to overcook it - this recipe needs the broccoli crunch!

This recipe deserves all five stars and can be altered to fit your own tastes and dietary needs.  I used less bacon, less sugar and far less mayo and the salad was still quite delicious.  I always blanch broccoli with hot water before using in a salad; the color and flavor are both enhanced.

The amounts are off in this recipe.  Either double/triple the amount of broccoli or cut the other ingredients in half.  I substituted craisins and used a small handful of bacon bits so I could keep it vegetarian.  Definitely prepare the dressing the day before and mix the two together so it can sit for half a day before serving.  SO good!

Great Recipe.  I even got my husband to eat it.  He hates broccoli and I was nervous that he would not even try it.  He tried it and went back for seconds. Next time I think I will cut back on the Mayo about 1/4 cup.

This is something I make often because it's delicious and easy.  And here are a few tips to make it even easier: save yourself a bunch of time and mess by using already cooked bacon pieces, the kind you find in a little pouch.  You can microwave them on a paper plate for about 15 seconds and they're perfect in this.  They seem to stand up better to the moisture because there isn't any fat.  Secondly, if you're worried the broccoli will be too crunchy, you have to cut it really small and it softens up just right after a little while in the fridge.  Third: I much prefer this with coarsely chopped cashews to the sunflower seeds.  Really delicious and you can throw it together in 5 minutes when you don't have to cook bacon.

I was apprehensive about this recipe, but it was excellent! 
Like others, I did change it up a bit-- used 4 broccoli crowns, balsamic vinegar, craisins, and used 1/2c. mayo and 1/2c. sour cream.  I also blanched the broccoli for a minute to get a nice color.  
Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again soon!

Have made this recipe for years and everyone loves it.  We use cider vinegar (love it) and often make it with half cauliflower and half brocolli.  Roasted peanuts are great too.  I usually keep the dressing separate until I mix up the salad and then add enough dressing to taste to save a few calories.   We usually cut veggies no larger than small bite size pieces; smaller than primary photo.  When making it to eat at home, I often cheat with the precooked real bacon (not bacon bits) and it's good too.  For parties though, I do use freshly cooked bacon.

This was the first time I have ever made, let alone eaten, a broccoli salad. I made a few substitutions for my own tastes - craisins and pinenuts, and for the dressing I used a caramelized balsamic with the lemon and mayo. I couldn't leave any left in the bowl. This will definately become a regular. Yummmmmm.

I have made this for my diabetic mother, but the whole family also loved it! Made a couple changes, used golden raisins AND dried cranberries, Splenda instead of sugar, added halved red seedless grapes, 1/2 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese, and added some chopped green onion I needed to use up. Very colorful and this is a great recipe for the Holidays, a nice alternative from all the heavy casseroles my family makes!

I had trouble with this recipe.  It was way too juicy.  I used one head of broccoli first and then added another and it was still too juicy. I have had broccoli salad before and it was fantastic.  I didn't like this at all.

Great recipe.  I used cranraisins instead of raisins.  Try cutting the broccoli into small pieces and discard most of the stem/trunk.  It makes a huge difference.  I've recieved many, many compliments due to this simple tip.  It's surprising what a difference it makes.

Really good. Used red wine vinegar (what I had) and needed to increase the sugar a bit. Also used more broccoli. Maybe the heads of broccoli here are smaller, and increased the (used sweet) onion. Oh, and used dried cranberries.

If I could I would give this recipe 10 stars.  I have been making a version of this recipe for years.  Always a hit.  Requested often.  My recipe is pretty much the same.  One thing I do~and keep on hand~if I'm in a hurry is use the pre-cooked & crumbled bacon bits--Hormel is a good brand  (the real stuff NOT bacos) Simple, easy & oh so yummy. A FAVORITE!!!!

Loved this recipe!!!  I went to a work luncheon and this was served there.  When I got home I found this recipe, made it the next day and it was exactly the same!  Great flavor and stores well (keep the bacon and seeds out until before serving).  My only suggestion is using "thick cut" bacon, it added a little more of a crunch.  Great salad for parties, I've made it atleast 4 times since!

There was way too much dressing!  I would half it next time.  Thankfully I added it a little bit at a time so my salad wasn't ruined.  However, this is great!  I made a bunch of changes.  Used lite mayo, cranberries instead of raisins, omitted the sunflower seeds, added grated cheddar cheese and some artichoke hearts.  Fabulous!  I'll be making this again and again, because it really does work with whatever you have on hand.  I'm going to try feta next time.

Love it, love it! I never thought broccoli could taste so good!  This is a new family favorite. With this recipe you can add or take away any ingredient that you don't want. Coming from a raisin hater.. TRY it with the raisins, gives it a great unexpected flavor!!  

Great pantry salad...you can use cider vinegar, red wine, rice wine, white wine vinegar...you really can't hurt this salad. I ALWAYS double or triple recipe!

This is a great salad! One change I make is to use a flavored vinegar. I have an apple lime vinegar that is fabulous mixed with the mayo and sugar and gives it a nice sweet/tangy taste. I also like to use red or black grapes cut in half instead of the raisins. I also blanch the broccoli; Literally dump in boiling water, stir 10 sec, drain, rinse in cold water and pat dry. This gives the broccoli and very bright green color and just a slightly more tender bite.

it was good.  thought the dressing was a little too thick. used white balsmati vinegar, stevia and some grated organic lemon zest which added some tang and zing.  One frustration i have when reading a recipe is HOW BIG IS A HEAD OF BROCCOLI?  would be nice if it stated 3 cups of broccoli florets or another example a clove of garlic.....how big is a clove of garlic?  it comes in many sizes.  Just saying~  But good never the less.  would be good with some chopped carrots too.

I like this salad, this version is the closest to mine on ratios of mayo/sugar/vinegar.  I prefer cider vinegar and use golden raisins. Instead of sunflower seeds and bacon I used a cup of hickory smoked almonds, chopped. That's a great trick for substituting for bacon in salads that I learned from a PCC Natural Markets recipe.

This is the best broccoli salad there is. My grandma used to make this and I was so happy when I found the same exact recipe. I always double the dressing because I like to make this the day before I'm going to serve it and I noticed that the broccoli really absorbs the dressing so it is good to make extra for the next day.

Used Tarragon Vinegar instead of White Wine vinegar and came out superb. Used maple flavored bacon as well.  Substitute GOLDEN raisins rather than regular raisins. Due to the vinegar marinating on the broccoli...be aware of the strong odor of the lefovers....but very good!

Contrary to the vast majority of reviews, I did not have a good experience with this salad.  There was too much dressing and it looked almost like milk (which is what a couple of my guests asked).  I followed the recipe except for substituting red grapes for the raisins, and Bacos for real bacon.  I wonder what I did wrong, or if anyone else had a similar experience.

Quickly blanch the broccoli for a bright green color and then soak in cold water to stop cooking. Makes a difference! Also, pre-cut bags of broccoli "slaw" is a good substitute if you have it on hand. We love using white raisins and chopped pecans instead. Think I'll use craisins for color and sweetness this holiday. When making this for large groups (20+ people) do not add 4x the bacon. You don't need that much. Who wants to cook 40 slices of bacon anyway?

I have made this for several functions and get nothing but rave reviews! I began to experiment with other ingredients after reading reviews and wanting a more colorful salad.  I use golden raisins, they just taste better! Its excellent to add a diced yellow or orange bell pepper, this give extra crunch and looks pretty too. I also shred a carrot or two depending on salad size. I have found that apple cider vinegar makes it better compared to white vinegar. Even broccoli haters love this salad! It makes the perfect accompaniment to any bbq food!!

This is very similar to a broccoli salad that I make. This recipe is wonderful with shredded carrots and since I don't much care for raisins, I substitute dried cranberries. By far my favorite salad recipe!!! Cauliflower tastes good in it too.

This salad is great, even for a late night snack. It is the perfect mix of sweet and salty. I use golden raisins instead and blanch the broccoli so it's not so chewy.  I could eat this 2-3 x's a week easy!

I know I'm in the minority here, but I just thought this was so, so. It is quick and easy to prepare, and I followed a lot of reviewers advice to make a day ahead so the flavors meld. When I ate it though, there was nothing about this salad that made me want to make it again.

I was out of white wine vinegar so just used white distilled vinegar - it was still great.

This is excellent! I made for Thanksgiving and took readers advice and used equal amounts of sugar and vinegar and used craisins instead of raisins. I mixed the broccoli and onions the night before and mixed the dressing the night before as well - and tossed them together morning of. I will be making this A LOT! THANKS!

Everyone I've made this for just can't get enough!  The recipe is so versatile! My favorite is using pepitas and dried cranberries instead of sunflower seeds and raisins.  Also, put it in a blender or food processor for a bit and use as a dip!  Great!

 Now, years later I've made this dozens upon dozens of times.  It is requested at every SINGLE EVENT by everyone.  I like a bit of variety, but other people don't.  Please be aware that if you make this once, you will have to make it for the rest of your life.

Take my word for it (not that you know me, but trust me!!!!) the red seedless grapes make ALL the difference in the world!  I loved this salad with raisins, but it is SO MUCH BETTER with grapes!  I took it to our family Easter gathering and everyone RAVED!  Next time I am going to try the lowfat version with fat free mayo and turkey bacon.  VERY GOOD!

This has been a family favorite for a long time. Just recently I was at a resturant and they had added a little penne pasta to it. That made it even better.

Great recipe as is, been using it for years. For our preference I use less  mayo, apple cider vinegar, cranraisins, small cubes of cheese. Also a mixture of toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds. I like Costcos broccoli tops, blanch briefly, run in cold water and spin dry.  Always add turkey bacon at the end to maintain crunch.

Love this recipe! It is always a crowd pleasing dish wherever I take it. I do use slightly less sugar to cut down a bit on the sweetness. I have used raisins, grapes, and Craisins and all have turned out well in this salad. I mix this up the night before but don't add the bacon and sunflower seeds until serving. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Listen to the grapes--it is a "HOLY COW, Batman" of a recipe! I finally struck gold today.  Took this to a church lunch and it was gone in no time.  As the last spoonful was being ladled on her plate, the person looked up and said, "I hope you were not planning to take any of this home!"  I did make a change based on readers' comments, GRAPES!!! Grapes, man, grapes!  It is the deal cincher and it is fabulous.  Must have red onion and the sunflower seeds could be any nut, made the dressing just as it was written.  BUT it's the GRAPES! Did I say Grapes?  Yes, GRAPES!  Will be making this a lot!

I make a twist on this created by my aunt and it gets rave reviews everywhere I take it. In addition to broccoli, add a head of cauliflower; in place of raisins use craisins; and mix 2 tsp. curry powder into the dressing. Makes it even better!

Only change I made was substituted Craisins for the raisins. Turned out delicious. Some for dinner tonight and some for pot-luck tomorrow.

I got this from a friend years ago and it's been a big hit at potlucks since then!  The variation I got was slightly different.. cashews instead of sunflower seeds, craisins instead of regular raisins, and chopped dates.  Add the cashews just before serving and I only use probably a tablespoon of sugar w/the mayo dressing.  It's also good w/cider vinegar. Oh!!  and red seedless grapes!!  It would be a good idea to halve them for easier eating.

This broccli salad is awesome!  I was out of sunflower seeds (oops) so I used chopped pecans instead, I don't think the use of sunflower seeds versus pecans would change my review.  This salad is light, colorful, and flavorful.  I would recommend chilling the salad overnight prior to serving, but as some of the dressing heads toward the bottom of the bowl, be sure to toss just before serving.  I'm planning on making again in the future.

I love this combo! The bacon is a must... it really does make everything better! And I prefer using golden raisins. For the onion, I'd recommend dicing vs. chopping (smaller is better). Perfect side item for picnics!

This is a truly dynamite salad, but when I make it, I nix the onion (many people don't like it and it is served on a buffet).  I add the raisons, sunflower seeds, and bacon and chop the broccoli small so it is more like a cole slaw.  The last thing I do is use Cole Slaw Dression instead of a mayo combo, and it is fab and gets high 5s.  Amazing how a few simple ingredients can turn a veggie many do not like into something "everyone" will eat :)

This was awesome!  I made it for Thanksgiving and am just now getting around to reviewing.  I gave this recipe to many people who asked for it.  I made some notes about using red wine vinegar, and not all of the sugar.  Basically just followed the top 10 helpfuls.  Thanks!

I thought this was just OK. Not sure what I did wrong but it just didn't flow well.  It seemed like too much mayo for me and not enough raisins.  I will try again sometime but most of what I made went to waste so I'm not sure I want to go through the hassle again. May just purchase from the store next time.

This was SOOO good.  I always used to treat myself with the one from the deli counter.  This is WAY better, especially because I see what goes into it.  Even my husband loved it and he always gafaws at raisins.  This disappears at every BBQ.  FYI: Use your judgement as to the amount of broccoli.  Heads of broccoli vary in size.  I adjust all ingredients accordingly.  Trust your taste buds! That's what cooking is about.  ENJOY!

Absolutely what I was looking for.  I healthied it up by using fat-free mayo and didn't miss that part at all.  I did use the Hormel Bacon Bits that are 50% reduced fat.  I love the flavors of the red onion, raisins and bacon with that dressing.  I used on med bag of the broccoli/cauliflower mix by Dole that was BOGO free last week.  Perfect salad and it lasts days in the fridge.

I love easy and delicous recipes and this was one of them! Not that it needed it, but I did make some minor changes.  I did not have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead.  I also used splenda in place of sugar, "ready to serve" bacon, light mayo, unsalted sunflower seeds and a bag of pre chopped broccoli.  This was ready to go in a matter of minutes and a HUGE hit with the family!! I've never seen broccoli go so fast!

I've made this recipe several times now. Everyone I served it to just loved it. My mother in law even asked me for the recipe. Simply the best!! YUMMY!!! UPDATE... use fresh broccoli! Someone in here suggested using frozen broccoli and foolishly I made it that way ONCE. It was nasty!! It tasted like wilted salad that had been sitting in my fridge for a week. The best advice for any cook is always use the best, freshest ingredients and your dishes will be well received.

I made this last night with a couple of changes.  I added some small cheese chunks, not grated and instead of raisens, I used dried cranberries, I like the tartness with the broccoli and sunflower seeds.  Also, in order to make it a bit more healthy, I used a sugar substitute and low fat/low cal Miracle Whip, I doubt you would be able to tell the difference.

It is a great salad.  If you are concerned about fat/calories, try my variation.

For me it was missing something.  I will have to check other broccoli salads on this site to see if they differ.  I will probably not make this recipe again.

YUMMY!!!!  After reading other reviews, I omitted the raisins and added red, seedless grapes which was delicious!  This was a HUGE hit at a recent dinner party!!  However, next time I will be sure to make TWO batches!

Delicious!  My hubby doesn't like raw broccoli...but he enjoyed this salad!  I made it without the bacon and it was yummy. Best eaten the first day since the seeds get soft in the dressing.  Thanksgiving guests loved it!

My son's grandmother used to make this at holiday functions and it's really good!!! The bacon gives it that extra zing and it tastes really good if you let it chill in the fridge either overnight or a few hours before being served! Thanks Eleanor...this is fabulous!!!!

Make sure you use a very large head of brocolli or else you have too much dressing. Adding a little shredded carrot adds nice color to the salad too!

My whole family loved this salad.  It was a nice change from an ordinary tossed salad or cooked broccoli.  It's easy and can be made the night before, adding the seeds and bacon just before serving.  It also keeps well for several days.

This recipe is delicious. It has become one of my favorite potluck staples, because Everyone loves it. I use red grapes cut in half instead of raisins. Everything combined in this dish truly makes it a home run. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This was very good. I think I'll add more bacon next time simply because I'm a bacon lover. I used microwaveable bacon to save time but the whole thing was delicious

This salad was definitely good, very flavorful and makes raw broccoli taste great. But, given the reviews I expected a little more. I made very minor changes, mostly with quantities and not ingredients, which is why I think my review is still warranted. I used a 2lb bag of broccoli florets (trimmed the stems even more). I doubled the dressing since I had a lot of broccoli (2 cups mayo, 3 tbsp white wine vinegar, 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 3 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp Splenda-equal to 10 packets), then a 4 oz bag of precooked turkey bacon, roasted slivered almonds (about 20 min in 300 degree oven), and NO raisins but I added salt. I also didn't add the bacon and almonds until it was time to eat. Again, very good recipe, but for someone who loves sugar I found it too sweet. There was enough sweetness in the dressing so I'll probably use one less tbsp of sugar next time (so 3 tbsp instead of 4 for the quantity I made.) It's not needed to let the broccoli sit in the dressing for the flavors to meld, but it helps soften the broccoli. The salt I added balanced the sweetness a little, and it just needed salt. Regardless of my critique, I still recommend this recipe and I will make it again.

Absolutely love this salad! I have eaten it for years but my recipe has one difference. Add one small can of mandarin oranges. Put broccoli and onions in colander and pour juice and oranges over all then proceed with the recipe as written. The oranges add color and sweetness and is delicious. Yum!

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was GONE in no time! Now I'm making it again for a Christmas dinner this weekend. Instead of sunflower seeds I used shaved almonds, because that's what I had at the time, it was great! I used red wine vinegar instead of white, again, because that's what I had. I also added some shredded cheese for more color. Thanks for this GREAT recipe!

Addictively delicious!  I subbed Craisins for icky raisins which turned out great and used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Only had it set for about 45 minutes before serving and it was great - not too raw tasting and not soggy.  My husband LOVED it and said he'd be happy if I served this with every meal :)

What can I say that hasn't already been said? This salad is amazing and everyone here LOVED it, even my anti-veggie hubby! I used cranberries instead of the raisins and I love the little bit of color they provided. The bacon is what makes the salad, so don't omit it! Perfect all around, I wouldn't change a thing. A definite keeper!

4 stars as written, simply because I don't care for the sweetness the raisins provide. I make this using red wine vinegar instead of white and add shredded sharp cheddar cheese. My broccoli hating family loves this.

I used what I had on hand. I know this is not the exact recipe, but I used the bones of this recipe. I used the mayo, sugar, vinegar, broccoli, bacon, onion and I added cheddar cheese. It turned out great. I am not a fan of the raisens, so I left them out. I also blanched the broccolli just to take the raw edge off.

THE ONIONS WERE OVERPOWERING AND DIDN'T LIKE THE VINEGAR.  I would prefer using a prepared dressing like Marie's blue cheese or parmessan or ranch instead of the sugar vinegar mix. liked the raisins (or craisins) and bacon though.

Yummo! This recipe is absolutely delicious! I first had broccoli salad at a well known restaurant on their salad bar. That dish was the main reason I liked eating there. Now I can make it at home! I used craisins and almonds I had roasted myself instead of the raisins and sunflower seeds because that's what was in my cupboard. I did let this set in the refrigerator over night and then topped with the bacon and nuts before serving. It is best to let the flavors meld, as the author suggests, at least two hours before serving. I have made it before and ate it right away and didn't care for it. Definitely let it set awhile. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times and it is always delicious.  I make it with light mayo to reduce some of the fat.  When I want to make this as a main dish, I add cut up chicken.  Yummy!

We had this with our lasagna dinner last night and was I filled up just with the salad.  Minor changes which would help the waistline since this is calorie rich as it is.  Use already prepared honey dijon mustard salad dressing and not the mayonaise and sugar. What a whopping calorie cut it is.

I have made this several times Let it set overnight and the nuts were still crunchy ( I was concerned they would get sort) Added the bacon the morning of the party just in case. Use craisins which were wonderful in it. JUst made it for a work potluck and had many requests to make it again for the next pot luck. People were actaully disappointed that there were not leftovers the next day to munch on- and thats a first!

I blanched the broccoli, and I used light mayo.  Yumm!  Make sure to add the bacon and sunflower seeds just before serving.  No need for me to go to my favorite salad bar to get this goodness anymore :)

So good!  My family just loves this recipe!  I make it more calorie friendly I used light mayo, with splenda.  I also don't ever have white wine vinegar so I just used apple cider vinegar and you can't tell much of a difference. Also make sure you chill it properly before serving I go at least 2 hours, 4 is better. Gives the broccoli more time to soak up the flavor.  Makes a big difference!

I made this tonight for Father's Day dinner.  A HUGE hit..  I used precooked bacon and just heated and crumbled.. I think next time I will just use bacon bits and save the trouble.  I used red grapes instead of raisins - only because my sister doesnt like raisins.  It was awesome!  My sister is begging for the recipe and begged to take home all the leftovers.  Oh, and I did use Splenda instead of sugar.  This was so easy to make too.  I made the dressing the night before, added the broccoli and red onion..  Right before serving, I added the bacon, grapes and sunflower seeds..  Oh so good!

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent. I always make it the night before and toss in the bacon and sunflower seeds just before serving. The flavors blend and the bacon and seeds stay crisp.  Double the batch, there is never enough !nomatter how much I make!

11/19/07 I tried this recipe again with 1/2 the sauce and two broccoli crowns.  We enjoyed it much better.  This is a delicious recipe if you get the proportions right.
6/20/06 Please define a head of broccoli.  I bought a bunch of three and put in two and still had too much sauce which made it very strong. I will attempt this salad again because it tastes like the deli salad I love that is so expensive.

I hate raisins but thought I should put them in like the recipe says and it was really good.  After sitting in the fridge overnight, the raisins plumped up to a huge size!  I blanched the broccoli and left out the seeds.  I think I needed to add more mayo (only added 10 tlbs instead of 16) and some more red onion to give it that bitterness that the sugar needs to counteract.  Overall, a very nice warm weather salad.

Finally found the right recipe for Broccoli Salad. This one is my favorite. The only change I make is I add about 1/2 to 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to this. Very very good!

For a lower-fat version sold at one of our local Delis, omit the bacon and sugar and use reduced-fat mayo. A squeeze of lemon instead of vinegar is good, too.  Slivered almonds can substitute for sunflower seeds.  Also excellent using 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 cauliflower.  Keeps well for several days.  My family loves it.

Delicious! But, yes, do cut the sugar in half. Husband asks for it again and again. Excellent side dish or stand-alone meal!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. **************************
Based on the reviews I was shocked to find this more of a sunflower seed/mayo salad rather than a broccoli salad with a little too much vinegar. After making, I tasted it and decided to double the veggies (used cauliflower but more broccoli would have done the trick), double the raisins and leave everything else as is. With the slight changes I would give it 4 stars.

I have made this recipe countless times. I used cranberries instead of raisins since I don't like the taste of it. I have learned from multiple preparations no to over-whisk the dressing as it liquefies. Other than that, it's my family's favorite.

Delicious!  Didn't change a thing.  The perfect combination of ingredients with just the right amount of crunch and sweetness.  I could have served it immediately, but the recipe said to wait, so I did.  Frankly, I liked it both ways!

Finally rating this.  It is a delicious recipe that is a go-to for me.  Most recently had it with a steak dinner.  I use the packaged bacon that is already prepared.  Makes the salad go together in no time.

Made this yesterday for a family gathering and it was a big hit!  I used red grapes instead of the raisins (it's what I had on hand) and used onion powder in the dressing instead of red onion in the salad (a matter of personal preference).  The bacon and sunflower seeds added just before serving really made the dish.  Everyone loved it and I'm sure I'll be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing, JJOHN32!

This recipe is a great way to serve broccoli.  I love the combination of sweet/salty, and I love most things with bacon in them!  This is a great salad to make ahead.  I do everything except the bacon the day before I want to serve it.  On serving day, I cook the bacon, crumble it and stir it in.  Even with the bacon in it, leftovers are good in the lunch box!

I have been making this salad for 5 years now, from this exact recipe, and I am, like many others, constantly begged for the recipe! The only thing I do differently is I use dried cranberries instead of raisins. I love the tart flavor and bright color of the cranberries. People love love love this salad. Also sometimes I spoon a little of the bacon drippings into the salad :) It doesn't get any better than this!
Ok so I lied I do a couple things different... I only use the actual flower part of the broccoli chopped into very teeny tiny pieces...so I use about 4-6 heads of broccoli, which is fine for me because I feed the stems to my bunnies. The texture of it is so decadent this way. YUMMO!

I have been making this salad for 5 years now, from this exact recipe, and I am, like many others, constantly begged for the recipe! The only thing I do differently is I use dried cranberries instead of raisins. I love the tart flavor and bright color of the cranberries. People love love love this salad. Also sometimes I spoon a little of the bacon drippings into the salad :) It doesn't get any better than this!
Ok so I lied I do a couple things different... I only use the actual flower part of the broccoli chopped into very teeny tiny pieces...so I use about 4-6 heads of broccoli, which is fine for me because I feed the stems to my bunnies. The texture of it is so decadent this way. YUMMO!

It is a pity that I can only give this recipe five stars.  I took it to a pot luck at work today.  It got rave reviews and I had many, many requests for the recipe. This salad is wonderful!  I did not change a thing.

I am not a big raw broccoli fan but I did enjoy this salad very much and so did my family. Even my 13 year old son loved it. I ran out of sugar so had to use Splenda's sugar 'blend' and I used craisins instead of raisins and regular vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (store didn't have it) but it still tasted great. The hardest part (for me) was saving the bacon for the salad. I LOVE bacon!! Fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing it.

Super easy and a hit every time.  Adding between a 1/2-1 cup of cheese adds a little color and flavor.  I always do almond slices and dried cranberries to sub for raisins and sunflower seeds.  Can do whatever you please; the broccoli and sauce are yummy with any combo of "add ins" you desire!

This is DELICIOUS! It's sweet and nutty and very flavorfull! I made a double batch for a family party and it was the first thing to go. I will definitely be making this again. (I blanched the broccoli to take the edge off, and used craisins instead of raisins). Thanks for a GREAT salad recipe!

I love this salad! I do have to omit the onion as I have some picky eaters, but it is still wonderful! I use half mayo half miracle whip for the dressing...gives it a nice zing. VERY good!

Very easy to make. My entire family loved it. Including my 5 children. The raisins provided a sweet taste while the sunflower seed a little crunch. And it got the kids to eat more broccoli.  Even though my children do eat cook broccoli this was a great way for them to eat fresh broccoli.

Delicious!!!  This one was loved even by non-broccoli eaters!!  ALL of them!!  Just get them to try it.  I'm not at all fond of raw broccoli, so I always barely steam the broccoli about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes first.  I also used the real bacon in packages which saved so much time and mess.  I thought 1 c. of sunflower seeds was WAY too much.  Next time I'll cut those down to around 1/2 c.  I had a ton left at the bottom of the bowl...  This recipe is a big winner, though, and one I will definitely use often.

Fantastic, but upon some other reviewer's suggestions, and as I made this at Christmas, I used CRAISINS (not raisins), they are sweeter and brighter red.  I didn't think grape halves (as some recommended), would be good in a make-ahead salad. I loved the Craisins! I also added a 3rd tablespoon of sugar and reduced the mayo a bit.  Because I served this at Christmas with Honey-Baked Ham and potatoes au-gratin (with bacon), I left the bacon out.  With the craisins and sunflower seeds, it really didn't need more color or texture.  YUM...But gives you bad breathe :)

I love this recipe, and am making it to take to family gatherings at Thanksgiving.  It always goes over well with family and friends.  I use real bacon bits instead of bacon (for ease mostly) and omit the raisins.

I used turkey bacon, and 1/2 c mayo, 1/2 c light mayo. It was great, but I think next time I would blanch the broccoli so that it wasn't quite so hard.

I love this recipe.  It is always a hit at parties and everyone always ask for the recipe.  Its fast and easy.  Refrigerating is a must! I like to make mine with dried cranberries instead,  the red just pops adding a nice visual to the dish.   I also use crushed cashews instead of sunflower seeds and add about a 1/2 cup of diced cheddar cheese!  Soooooooo good!

I love this recipe, and so does everyone I have served it to! I have also used grapes or apples instead of raisins, depending what I have on hand. Always turns out great! I use honey in place of the sugar simply as my preference to avoid refined sugar and I use Apple Cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar. Delicious!

Excellent flavor - kids gobbled it up. The sauce got runny though - I let it sit in fridge for about 4 hours. No bacon, just toasted sunflower seeds and almonds. The toasted almonds have a bacony flavor without the saturated fat and cholesterol. Not sure how much 1 head of broccoli is supposed to be in this recipe, but I used 1 bunch, as sold rubberbanded together at the market - it looked like 3 heads to me, probably about a pound of broccoli. Perfect amount. And red grapes are definitely the way to go, especially if you let the salad sit - raisins get swollen and disgusting.

This is a great recipe, weather for parties, or just for dinner at home. I do have some HELPFUL HINTS for some.
1.) Don't have bacon/don't want to waste your time cooking & waiting for the bacon to be ready? You can use bacon bits. Although smaller, they are handy so you CAN say you've put bacon in. 
2.) If you don't have raisins, both raisins and grapes (grapes would need to be cut in half the shorter way) can work as well. 
3.) Apple cider vinegar can replace the white wine vinegar.

This is an excellent salad. The ONLY thing I did differently is chopped the broccoli. I like it better than the big chunks.

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves it.  I just use Miracle Whip instead of mayo and vinegar and I add chopped pecans instead of sunflower seeds.  Goes great with fish, too.  Another nice thing about it is that it is easily adaptable to the size group who are eating it--I make it for one or two as easily as a large group.

Loved this recipe!  Finally found one we like.  I am an avid reader of reviews because they give me the confidence to make slight changes.  And I love this site and the participants!  We are having a buffet for a crowd so am trying different salad recipes.  I omitted the raisins and onion and as a reader suggested, we used white vinegar since we did not have "white wine" It was still great.    My husband who is not a salad person said "this one is a keepr".  That says alot everybody!!!!

This is the second broccoli salad I've tried from this site and both are equally good.  I would say the dressing for this one is more on the simple side.  With this recipe, I had used red grapes instead of raisins and added a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese.

GREAT!
I fixed this the other night for my boyfriends family and they loved it. I did take the advice of Discobunny and used red seedless grapes. I also used lite mayonnaise and saltless sunflower seeds, for people with special diets. I also used the advice of putting some bacon in it the night before. (I used thick sliced bacon). Will make again. Thanks for a GREAT new dish 0(*@*)0

I gave this 3 stars because I changed the amounts.  It gets 4 stars because it is the recipe on here that has the best starting point.  I use only broccoli, red onion, shredded cheese, bacon (preferably pre-cooked bits because they are easier and somewhat healthier/less greasy) and sugar, mayo, and vinegar.  I reduce the sugar to a scant Tablespoon, and reduce the vinegar to 1 T.  We like ours a little mayonaise-ey and less sweet. I like sunflower seeds but seldom have them on hand, plus my husband would prefer this without them. Raisins I can live without in any food.  Thank you Alyson for helping me get the broccoli salad that I love!

Made it for Easter... cut Broccoli (small pieces),  onions and red grapes (i used 1 cup halved red grapes over raisins as others suggested and it was perfect) and combines them the night before.  I also combined in a seperate bowl the white wine vinegar/sugar/and mayo and set that in fridge overnight.  The next day right before I served I combined the veggies and dressing(which tastes a lot like slaw dressing), and the slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds.  I cooked bacon and crumbled it and set it on the side for people to add if they wanted, but I thought it was very good w/o it...will be making this again and again!!!!

WOW!  This was wonderful after it sat overnight!  Made a number of changes to make it healthier and based on what I had on hand.  Used real bacon bits, about 1/3 cup, instead of bacon.  Also used dried cranberries instead of raisins, two packets of Splenda instead of sugar and about 3/4 cup light mayonnaise and 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.  Was good without sitting but was way over the top the next night!

I made this for my family and my in-laws.  I made exactly as directed.  Everyone enjoyed it!!  The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe SLIGHTLY less sunflower seeds (maybe 3/4 c).  But, that is just MY taste preference!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!  =)

I love this salad. It's so versatile.  I added 1/2 head of cauliflower and about 1 cup of shredded cheese.  I only put in 6 LARGE slices of bacon and used a sweet yellow onion instead.  I left out the sunflower seeds and used Miracle Whip.  It is absolutely a family favorite...even my 15 month old loves the cauliflower and raisins in it!  Well done.  A lot can be done with this salad....the dressing is perfect!  Thanks!

We leave out the raisins and red onions since we're not fans. I also only had red wine vinegar on hand and used that. This was so yummy, a little bit sweet, and delicious! It was the only thing at the dinner party that we didn't have leftovers of!

Great way to get your broccoli!  I used grapes instead of raisins, and used 1:1 sour cream:mayo.  I also added green onion.  I bet some roasted slivered almonds would be great... or some tortellini!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used the broccoli in a bag you can buy at Costco.  I did not have white wine vinegar so I used white vinegar and added a little more sugar.  I also added sliced black olives and used real bacon bits you can find in a jar.  Definitely will be family favorite.

I made this recipe for our office Thanksgiving lunch this week and received several compliments.  Even the Chairman of the Board's wife loved it so much she asked for the recipe.  I did make one change by substituting the raisins to CranRaisins.  I will definitely make this recipe for my family Thanksgiving meal.

This was excellent! I didn't have mayo so I used light miracle whip, and then I added an extra TBSP 1 1/2 or so of the vinegar and sugar to mask a little more of the strong "miracle whip" flavor, and let it sit overnight.  It's delicious.  I did substitute halved grapes for the raisins per other reviews, and I used red wine vinegar cause that's all I had.  I got rave reviews from my "fancy" in-laws.  I will definitely make this again!

I had fresh broccoli in my fridge that had been sitting for a while.  I knew that I didn't want to make the usual broccoli and cheddar soup or casserole so on a whim I tried this recipe.  I cannot believe how much I enjoyed it.  I have NEVER liked fresh broccoli.  I don't think I've ever eaten more than a few pieces at once and I almost ate half of this salad!  I used thinly sliced almonds in place of the sunflower seeds, white onion instead of red onion and golden raisins.

Try smoke-house almonds instead of the sunflower seeds, even yummier!

This was great.  I made it twice.  I didn't like it with frozen broccoli.  Definitely fresh was better.  Also better when the broccoli was chopped to small pieces so you'd get the grapes and sunflower seeds more even proportioned.  I put 2 cups of quartered grapes and 1/2 c of sunflower seeds.  Used red wine vinegar.  Definitely mix the broccoli while slowly pouring in the dressing to get an even coating and prevent drowning of the broccoli.  If you do, I used a colander to strain out the extra dressing.

Incredible! Only thing I would change is the amount of mayonnaise. perhaps a little less next time.  EXTREMELY delicious though.

Good salad :)

I find 10 slices of bacon a bit much.  I prefer 6-8 slices.  I exchange the raisins for craisins and use low fat mayo.  I omitted the sunflower seeds but added 3 oz of diced cheddar cheese.  I also added 3/4 cup of halved cherry tomatoes.  Add the dressing gradually.  I find that this usually yields too much dressing.

this is a really great warm-weather salad! I also use seedless grapes cut in half instead of raisins, but have tried craisins, too. All good! and, yep...add the bacon and sunflower seeds last!

I've made this salad for years.  Many years ago when my mother was ill and I was trying to coax her to eat, I made this salad because it was sweet and had lots of flavor and she asked for it time and time again.  For a splash of color, I will sometime throw in craisins in place of or as well as the raisins.

This is a good recipe but just a little on a sweet side...  I think I'd make it with less sugar the next time.  I also boiled broccoli really quick since I"m not really a big fan of raw broccoli.

This is a perfect side for those summer barbecues!  I leave out the sunflower seeds, but love the combo of the broccoli, bacon, raisins and onion.  The dressing is excellent as is too!

I have made this salad for several family and work functions and it is a hit!  Even people who do not like broccoli love it! I add the chopped red onion to the mayo/vinegar/sugar mixture and then I put it over the broccoli about 15 min before serving, along with he raisins and sunflower seeds. I do not use bacon, changes the flavor to me.

Delicious! I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and reduced to 1 tbsp. I used fat free mayo and craisins instead of raisins.  This is a keeper! Thanks!

This is a great recipe that you can customize to meet your needs.  I leave out the bacon, because frankly it's not the healthiest thing to put in a salad.  A nice alternative would be to have the salad plain with grilled/baked chicken on the side. That alone makes a great meal.  I added shredded carrot for a dash of color and I use red seedless grapes instead of raisins.  Initially, I used half cup sour cream and half cup mayo for the dressing.  I may consider using plain yogurt instead next time to cut down the fat even further.  This is a great recipe for all occasions.  It's great for potlucks and picnics.  I personally like to make this so I have lunch/dinner premade for 2-3 days.

Wow, this was so good!  I made a large batch for teachers appreciation day and went back right after it was over hoping there would be some left for dinner.  Turns out, of all the wonderful delivered, mine was the first to go.  Making it now for my family.  I substitute dried blueberries for the raisins (YUM!) but, aside from that follow the recipe to a T.  Thank you for sharing this!

I made this last night and woke up wishing I had leftovers. I used grapes due to the fact that my husband hates rasins (he even had seconds). Thanks for the great recipe.

I got tired of buying this so often at my grocery store deli... It's wonderful Only thing I'd change is that I've found blanching the broccoli for just a min or 2 in solted water then putting it in ice water takes the slight bitterness away. It's wonderful!

The basic recipe is very flavorful, and lends itself well to experimentation with other ingredients.  Craisins are an especially good addition.

This was great!  I made this for several family members who had never had broccoli salad.  They were skeptical when I mentioned what I was serving, but then ate it up & loved it.  The leftovers were even better the next day . . . and there was not much leftover!  Next time I will add the bacon & sunflower seeds ahead of time & let the flavors blend.

I have made this for years with these proportions. If you don't have wine vinegar, use cider vinegar and reduce the amount to 2 Tablespoons. Many recipes use a larger amount of sugar...I have tasted them and, in my opinion, they are overly sweet and inappropriate for a salad. This is one of the best salads ever.

VERY GOOD!!! This was the first broccoli salad I've ever made and it tasted great. I'm not a big fan of broccoli salads so I'm so glad to have found this recipe. TMJ got in the way of all the chewing. :(

fab!i brought it for a dinner party and it was well loved, despite the fact that most of my family HATES fresh  veggies. you can just change/sub ingredients and it still tastes great. the changes i made were: i subbed grapes for raisins, basically the same thing, but juicier! instead of normal sunflower seeds i used honey roasted ones, which added a nice roasted flavor and went fab with the bacon. i didn't have onions so i omitted that, and added chopped potatoes and eggs. great recipe, thanks!

if you peel in the broccoli stalk, (getting down to the lighter green color)julienne this part and use it also. this adda a little different texture to the mix and not much waste. I also found if you soak the raisins before adding to the salad this makes them plumper and better.also japanese rice vinegar is a great substitute for white vinegar(less tart).  great recipe!

Wow, this really was yummy. Read other reviews before you make this for some tips.  Like others suggested, I added more broccoli but kept the amount of mayo the same so it didn't taste too mayo-heavy.  I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have the white wine vinegar.  I happen to love sunflower seeds so I added a little extra.  I also used red grapes instead of raisins and that added to the sweetness.  I'm not a big fan of onions but I must say that the red onion was great in this, I just added less.  I made a HUGE bowl of this for a luncheon at work and there were NO leftovers.

i omitted the raisins and used craisins instead- very good. next time i will use much less sunflower seeds, or maybe none at all- their nutty flavor was overpowering. overall a very delicious salad.

Thanks for a great recipe.  Even some of my guests who are not avid broccoli eaters loved this.  After reading many of the reviews I cut the dressing recipe in half and used half the amount of sugar.  How many heads of broccoli you use depends on their size.  At my local grocery store that would be about 4 heads.  I'm looking forward to making this again...

I really loved this salad.  What a great dish to bring to a summer bbq/potluck.  I am always looking to lighten things up so here is what I did differently.  This recipe makes a lot of dressing.  You need at least 2 heads of broccoli or just cut the amount of dressing in half.  I used 1/4 cup light mayo, 1/4 cup light sour cream, 1 Tbsp. vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. sugar.  This cuts a whole lot of the fat out of it and it was plenty of dressing for a large head of broccoli.  I would definitely double the amount of broccoli (at least) for a larger group.  I mixed everything (except bacon and seeds) together early in the day and then just before serving mixed in the bacon and sunflower seeds so they wouldn't get soggy.  I used craisins for the pretty color and their tartness compliments the dish well.  I will make again.  Thanks!

I've been making this salad for years, only difference, I use craisins (cranberrys) instead of raisins and rather than make the dressing, I use poppyseed salad dressing, OUTSTANDING, especially if your pressed for time.

Superb!  I only had rice wine vinegar, which is a mild and light type of vinegar.  It worked out just fine and yielded delicious results!  I don't like bacon, so I excluded that, and npw I can't wait to share this with friends.

I was very pleased with this salad.  I only had red wine vinegar on hand but it turned out just fine.  I had to take it to a dinner so I just put the seeds, a trail mix blend that included raisins, and crumbled bacon in separate baggies and dumped it in right before we ate.  Everyone seemed to really like it.  I don't know why everyone saves this for potlucks and holidays--what a great way to get some raw veggies!

This was very good. I used craisins rather than raisins and omitted the sunflower seeds. I thought it had a bit too much dressing, but the rest of the family didn't think so...a matter of personal taste. It is great as a leftover too, actually tasted better the next day. I wouldn't add the bacon until you are ready to eat the salad so the bacon doesn't get soggy. A definite keeper!

Very yummy!!!  I do add 20 oz of cheese filled tortellini and use three heads of fresh broccoli (instead of one).  I cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup sour cream.  Thought the dressing was too "mayoie" the first time.  Really liked it with my few changes...:)

I tried this recipe for the first time at Thanksgiving.  Per others' suggestions, I substituted red grapes for the raisins.  I loved it because I could prep the broccoli,onion and grapes ahead the night before and refrigerate.  I also mixed up the dressing early Thanksgiving morning and stashed it in the fridge.  A couple hours before we were to eat, I threw the dressing on, added the bacon and the sunflower seeds.  Everyone loved it!!!  I had to pass the recipe on to my aunt and sister before they left that day.  Considering the fact that my crew are a bunch of "traditionalists" ("what's that?  we've never had that at Thanksgiving before?"), their reactions were quite a relief.  I'll definitely make this recipe again and again.

I made this for a school function last year and then again for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it!  It was gone at both functions.  I used cranberries instead of raisins, red wine vinegar, and added cheese, salt & pepper.  WONDERFUL!  I am making it again this year for Christmas!!

I found this recipe last year, and have made it regularly since.  The flavors are wonderful together.  I also find the onion to be a little too much, so it chop it very fine, and put only half of what the recipe calls for.  I recommend this unless you really like raw onion flavor.  Great to bring to potluck dinners!

I really liked it.  I, personally, thought the combination of flavors was perfect.  But, I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. More than one person complained about the strong onion flavor.  Next time I will reduce the amount of onion when serving a large crowd.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe and has been a huge hit at all gatherings. Even my fussy younger ones love it. I follow the recipes exactly as it is with the only modification being to use halved seedless red grapes instead of the raisins, a change suggested by other reviewers.This is a family favorite. Thank you Alyson.

This broccoli salad is awesome.  We had it Christmas day and my family loved it.  My dad even said that it was possibly the best salad he had ever had. I ate leftovers the next day out of the fridge and it was just as yummy.

I'm not a big broccoli salad fan in general but I was looking for a change from the standard potato/pasta salad barbeque fare and this was perfect.  The only thing I did different was quickly blanch the broccoli to bring out its flavor and color. And definitely switch out the raisins for red seedless grapes.  I will definately make this again.

Delicious! This broccoli bacon salad's dressing is just right (some call for too much sugar in my opinion). I substitute dried sweetened cranberries for the raisins because my husband refuses to eat raisins. You can also add between 1/2 and 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese to the salad ingredients. We don't do raw onions so I leave those out and put about a teaspoon of dehydrated onion flakes in the dressing before putting it over the salad. I use cider vinegar because that's what I usually have in the cupboard. And finally, I just barely blanch the cut up broccoli, refresh it in ice water and dry thoroughly before using in the salad... I don't mind it raw but DH thinks it's better blanched.

My husband and I both enjoyed this and it's a good way to bring broccoli to the table. I don't really like raw broccoli, so I blanched it for about a minute to take the raw edge off. And I used turkey bacon. I will use this recipe when the idea of steamed broccoli doesn't thrill, which is often!.

Wonderful recipe.  The only change I made was to cut back by 1/2 on the mayonnaise.

Pretty good- very strong flavor.  I didn't use the bacon and I enjoyed that better.  Made it way more healthy, too!  The broccoli stayed crunchy for the two days we had it in the fridge.  I also used craisins, and it was delicious!

Excellent.  I made this for a birthday party, and everyone asked for the recipe.  I added 1c sharp cheddar, which added to the color variety.  ALso, I didn't use all of the dressing, and it didn't seem to need it.

This was excellent!  I made it exactly to the letter the first time and it was good (a little too "saucy" for my taste), but I adjusted it the second time and it was better.  I cut way down on the onion and made everything easier by using a whole package of bacon.  I also added another head of broccoli and 1 cup of cheese.  Just FABOO!  Thanks for sharing!  I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while!

You can't go wrong with this salad. It's the best and I don't think I've met anyone who doesn't like it! I use store bought crumbled bacon and skip the frying. Great recipe.

GREAT recipe!!  I made this for my school's faculty Christmas party and everyone LOVED it!  Not a bite was left.  Thanks for posting this awesome recipe!  The only thing I would do different next time is not add as much sunflower seeds.  Or maybe I'll almond slivers like someone else mentioned before.

I wanted something different to serve at my Christmas gathering.  This was definitely a hit.  I did not include the raisins out of personal preference, but everyone at my party raved and raved about this salad.  Several people asked for the recipe.

this is a great recipe.  I used the red seedless grapes instead of raisins.  omitted the sunflower seeds altogether. only used 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of dressing that was prepared.  used red wine vinegar instead of white.  its quite decadent, so a little goes a long way. next time I may look to replace the mayo with a sour cream/lime based mixture, as other reviewer mentioned.

I made this and it was quite delicious, though with 1 head of broccoli, I had a ton of the toppings and dressing left over. I will try with 2 heads next time.

Absolutely delicious. I add half of the bacon before refrigerating for flavor, and the other half before serving for crunch. I always get requests for this salad.

Loved this, even the family of veggie haters asked for seconds! Went with halved large red seedless grapes rather than raisins and have used both frozen or fresh broccoli with great results!

I had broccoli in the fridge and I thought I would make steam broccoli with bacon. I came across this recipe, and having everything on hand I thought I would give it a try.  After making it, I  decided to try a small bowl.  About 3 hours later I had dinner, and another bowl.  When husband came home from work, I had another bowl. Between the 3 of us, the bowl was gone.  This has great flavor and textures. I do agree with other reviewers, there is a lot of dressing, so I just adjusted the nuts, dressings, and used dried cranberries.  Thank you Alyson!!!

I used this as a starting point because the recipe does not start with a huge quantity of sugar (some recipes call for 1/2 to a full cup of sugar). I reduced the bacon, mayo and sunflower seeds by 50% to significantly reduce the number of calories and left the sugar out altogether. This takes the calories per serving down almost 250 each. And the salad still tastes great with sweetness from the raisins. There are plenty of sunflower seeds per serving--I definitely would not use a full cup. You can taste enough bacon and the dressing is still creamy but the salad isn't swimming in it.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is one of my favorite dishes for bbq's, picnics,etc.  We use the smaller jar or squeeze bottle of mayo. I can't recall, it's either slightly more or slightly less ounces than the recipe calls for, but it works great. Instead of raisins we use red grapes or sometimes dried cranberries.  We also use 2 heads of broccoli instead of 1.

Loved it as did everyone who has tasted it here. The only change that I made was using half vanilla yogurt and half mayo. I couldn't make up my mind between craisins and grapes, so used both!

I took this to a potluck this weekend and it was a HIT!  I used craisins instead of the raisins.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  Perfect sweet/tangy combo in the dressing.  I hadn't made this for years and it was fun to bring to our party.  Glad I found this recipe again.

Great recipe! Just made some minor adjustments, but I'm sure it would have been great the way it is written as well. We used less bacon (5 Slices) - and it still had that smokey salty flavor. Also used olive oil mayo to health it up a little! I had a mix of roasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds at home already - so just used that mix in recipe - seemed to work well in recipe. Recipe was devoured by family of 3 in two days - and even 10 year old asked for seconds. We consider that a success! Thanks for sharing!

I changed the dressing, I needed something as close to 0 calories as possible.  So I used 6 oz ready made Waldens Honey dijon dressing and added apple cider vinegar and stevia to taste! Amazing!! No one could tell the difference!

I made this salad for a birthday party for 40 people. I tripled the ingredients, used red grapes cut in half, instead of  the raisins. Everybody loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I will be making this salad again!

Whenever I take this salad, it gets gobbled up.
I use apple cider vinegar and cranberries instead of white vinegar and raisins.  I find too, that I use less sugar.
Still a fantastic salad, and easy to make!  Thanks!!!

I was looking for the classic creamy broccoli salad that you see at picnics and in the deli cases at the supermarkets...this is it.  It is very good!  I took the advise of other reviewers and used fresh grapes, otherwise I made the salad exactly as written...I think I like the fresh grapes better than the traditional raisins.  I will make this again and again.

I love this broccoli salad! I have made this many times trying to modify it to my tasting.  I added half a can of chickpeas.  Instead of regular bacon, I used turkey bacon.  Also, to cut back on the mayo, I use half a cup of low fat greek yogurt and half a cup of low fat mayonnaise.  Sometimes I add a cup of whole wheat penne pasta.  It tastes great !

LOVE this salad! I make it all the time - ensure you double the recipe, so you have leftovers as it's even better after two days. I use dried cranberries instead of raisins, and a touch less sugar. Delicious!

Yummy!! we loved this salad but I feel the key is to blache the broccoli for 30 secs then put into ice water. It takes the "raw" off and makes it taste somuch better. I also i like cashews in this for a change. I also keep tasting the dressing to see if I may need more vinegar or sugar or maybe less.

This is a recipe that I regularly find myself craving -- so yummy and great to make ahead for a party or gathering.  I don't like my salad dripping with dressing, so I use about 2 lbs. broccoli crowns  for this recipe.  Also, my kids won't eat onions if they can see them, so I blend the onions with the mayo/vinegar/sugar (in a blender) to make the dressing.  You get a little onion flavor without the raw onion chunks.

This broccoli salad was the best I've ever tasted! I did make one small alteration though. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used the red wine vinegar I've had in the cabinet for a few yrs. Don't know if maybe the "aged" taste did it or what but it was GREAT. A friend told me abt this receipe & she uses the sauce for coleslaw too.

Fantastic!  I doubled the whole recipe and went a little shy on the mayo and a little heavy on broccoli, everyone loved it!

Way too sweet for us. I may try it again but would have to alter it significantly. But if you like your salad sweet, it is a good recipe.

Awesome - everyone loved it !!
I substituted Craisins for raisins &
I substituted slivered Almonds for the sunflower seeds.  I toasted the almonds in a pan on the stove.
I will make this for any event in the future - I'd give it 10 Stars ! ! !

Delicious, tangy and refreshing...I had to omit the bacon for dietary reasons, used quartered Heritage red grapes and forgot the sunflower seeds. Just out of curiosity, I might make it again with the bacon and sunflower seeds, but I thought it was great without them!

Going to make this for the second time this week! We used craisins instead of raisins and Oscar Myer bacon crumbles and it turned out delicious! Tangy, salty, sweet and savory! Also good for people with tree nut allergies :) YummY!

This salad has become a staple in my family. We love it! I don't use a whole cup of sunflower seeds (more like 1/2 cup) and I usually tweak the white wine vinegar and sugar amounts until it tastes just right...not too sweet and not too tart.

Yum!  Loved substituting the red grapes for the raisins. Had to get creative getting onion flavor without adding onion pieces as this was a requested dish of a known onion-hater, but it worked out beautifully. Really good recipe.

Loved this recipe! I made it mine low fat but it turned out awesome! Just as good as the original! 

Since I'm a vegetarian, I substituted the bacon for soy bacon bits, and substituted the mayonaise for low-fat mayo. The rest I kept the same and it turned out delicious. I added a little bit of pumpkin seeds just to add more healthy proteins :)

Absolutely wonderful! The family loved it! Made as per recipe.
Low fat substitute, plain yogurt & bit of sour cream instead of mayo. This turns out nice also.

Broccoli is not my favorite veggie, but this was fantastic!  Had to modify it a little bit based on what I had on hand - even health-ified it with light mayo and turkey bacon - and it was still fantactic.  Almost like broccoli slaw, but with some added kick.  Brought it to work for lunch several days, and people were very interested in what I was eating and asked for the recipe.  A lovely summer salad!

I loved it! But of course I did make just a few changes. I am not a fan of raisins, so used some fresh black figs for sweetness, since that's what I had. I also added turkey bacon, which doesn't quite crumble..so I sliced it into small pieces. Next time I think that fresh grapes would be a perfect compliment to this!

I actually modified. I didn't have enough broccoli, so I added finely sliced celery, instead of a full cup of mayo, I used half w/ half low fat Greek yogurt. In place of raisins, I used finely chopped dates (w/a dash of cornstarch so they wouldn't stick) and I used the sesame seed dressing from Costco. Overall, amazing.

Great Recipe. Very simple to make. The only chsnge I made was to halve the amount of mayo (used low-fat mayo) and it still tasted great.

This was very tasty... I do think i put too much broccoli because mine came out a little dry.  Next time I will add a little more sauce.  I used craisins which gave a nice tart flavor.

I looked this up after my friend served it at a party.  She made it with white wine vinegar and golden raisins, I tried it with red wine vinegar and red grapes because that is what I had on hand.  Great both ways!

This is the best broccoli salad on this site!  I love all the ingredients, and it is a smashing hit whenever I make it.  Even on those cold winter days when I want something crunchy and healthy and I'm sick of broccoli that is steamed or stirfried, this is a homerun.  Thanks Alyson for sharing

This salad was amazing!  I'm not a big fan of broccoli alone, but this salad made eating broccoli great.  I love the flavor the dressing and the added crunch of the bacon and sunflower seeds.  I was even able to cut down on some of the preparation time by using pre-cooked bacon.

I think next time I'll drop the sugar to just 1 tbsp - it is very sweet!!

The caloric content of this is also pretty shocking.  I think there is way too much sauce in relation to the broccoli, and so I always cut all the other ingredients in half, but still use all the broccoli in the recipe.  I always cut the amount of back dramatically, or just use a few tablespoons of bacon bits.  I also don't think it needs as many sunflower seeds.  Obviously, it's the sunflower seeds, mayo, and bacon that really make the calorie content insane.  If you cut the amounts of all of those dramatically, it's not quite as delicious, but still delicious enough -- and more in line with a reasonable caloric content in my opinion!

I love this recipe, and have been making a lighter version of it for years.  This was the first time I used red grapes (as per other reviewers' suggestions), bacon, and white wine vinegar (in the past, I'd used lemon juice).  I did lighten it up a bit by using 3/4 cup plain yogurt and only 1/4 cup mayo.   It's true that there is a bit too much dressing in this recipe, so don't add it all at once to avoid drowning the indredients.

Outstanding! I made this with red grapes sliced in half instead of raisins and I'm sure that it improves the dish.  I also used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds which worked very well.  I used low fat organic mayonnaise.  Delicious, delicious, delicious.

This has a wonderful flavor and is easy to make.  Next time I'll cut way back on the sunflower seeds (good but 1 cup is too much) and I'll make less dressing (again good but too much).

I got this recipe years ago from my sister-in-law and it always gets rave reviews and disappears!  At times I substitute dried cranberries for the raisins (pretty at the holidays, too!) or used golden raisins.  Also, I've uses prosciutto in place of the bacon (crisp it in the frying pan) but I like the bacon best.

My family has been devouring this for years (very similar recipe). We are vegetarian so we omit the bacon and hubby detests raisins so I sub in dried cranberries or halved red grapes. TIPS: I go easy on the onion as well as I find it can overwhelm the tastebuds a bit, especially if made in advance. I also chop the broc into quite small chunks. A great holiday dish!

This recipe is excellent.  Everyone loved it at our Thanksgiving.  Definitely should make it the day before as the flavor does improve with time.  (Two days later it seemed to taste even better.)  I left out the raisins due to personal preference but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I don't see a need to modify anything else.

Very good.  I used slivered almonds in place of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries in place of raisins because that is what I had on hand.  I did make it sit overnight as reviewers had suggested.  A great recipe, I will definitely make this one again.

Awesome salad!  I used regular white vinegar and 3 T. sugar....about 3 smallish broccoli heads, red grapes (halved) instead of raisins (but I know raisins are delicious also, I just had the grapes on hand), and toasted walnuts instead of sunflower seeds.  So yummy!

Super tasty, and SO easy to make. Definitely is going to become a go-to salad in our house. The only changes I made were to add Pecans instead of Sunflower Seeds (had pecans handy) and craisins instead of raisins...again...had the craisins on hand. I also added some black pepper. DELICIOUS! Even the husband liked it, and that's saying a lot because he's not much of a salad guy.

Skipped the onions (didn't have any), used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (all I had), and actually made half the "dressing" because I wanted more broccoli and less dressing.  It was a hit. As my husband says, "Everything is good with bacon."

Thought this was good.  I didn't add the sunflower seeds because I didn't have them on hand.  Also, used frozen broccoli and just barely cooked it (basically defrosted it in micro).   Would use frozen again in a pinch but fresh is always better in this case.

I love this recipe so much that I add it to our menu twice a month.  Although this recipe is PERFECTION on it's own, I usually substitute a red onion and splenda, in addition I often add a dollop of greek or plain yogurt to the dressing.  My husband is a body builder, so he likes his meals hearty and usually salads are more of a side dish.  However, once you add some grilled chicken or breaded chicken strips this becomes a hearty meal for all the big eaters in the family. This is a huge hit with the whole family!!

I used low fat Hellmans mayo, and cut bacon in 1/2 to reduce fat, and it was still fabulous.  Thanks!

This is a great salad!  It has so many nutritious ingredients and is delicious.  I tried using half cauliflower with the broccoli the second time I made it, and was even better, we thought.  Added 1/4 tsp. salt, too, which seemed to make it even better. One of our favorite salads now.  Almost a meal in itself.

I loved this salad!!  I'm Messianic, so I used Turkey Bacon, instead of pork.  I also used purple grapes, instead of raisins.  This salad was sooo yummy!!  I will make is again and again! Thank you for sharing!

I was surprised at how much my guests enjoyed this salad.  One gentleman said, "I never thought I would love broccoli with grapes, but just leave me alone while I finish this up!"  I submerged the broccoli in boiling water, let the water come back to a rolling boil, and then removed the broccoli --- that left the veggies with just the right texture.  I think you should halve the salad dressing recipe because it made way too much.  My salad turned out soupy when I poured most of the dressing on it, so I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before taking it out, transferring it to a colander/sieve, and letting most of the dressing drain out.  The salad looked and tasted much better with most of the dressing removed.  I added the bacon bits (I used Bac-O's since we don't eat pork) and sunflower seeds in the end, eyeballing how much I wanted to add (since I think the recipe called for way too many sunflower seeds!).  Enjoy; this recipe is a keeper.

I was very impressed with this salad! I didn't use the onions, but used most everything else. I was skeptical about the mayo, sugar, and white wine vinegar, but the ingredients combined together to make a very tasty dressing. Both my husband and I loved it, even though I don't usually eat broccoli and he doesn't usually eat anything with dressing!

I've made this a few times for summer parties.  The sweet/salty combo is irresistable.  The bacon and sunflower seeds need to be added pretty close to serving time or the bacon will get soggy and the seeds lose their crunch.  I used light mayo and sour cream.

Excellent salad!   I get tons of compliments on this salad.  I make it with a few minor changes - I use 3 heads of broccoli instead of one, otherwise it's really runny, and I use dried cranberries instead of raisins.

I hate broccoli but LOVE this salad (actually I've only ever had broccoli cooked, never tried it raw because I disliked it so much cooked)!!  A neighbor of mine (who's a chef) made this salad over the summer and I've been looking for the recipe ever since and this one ROCKS!  I added more broccoli and onion than what it calls for (3 heads, chopped finely and 1/2 an onion), used Splenda instead of sugar, and red wine vinegar instead of white because I didn't have any.  I mixed everything together and let it sit overnight. AWESOME SALAD!!

I love Broccoli Salad and did a twist with this one.  I used two bags of broccoli slaw, replaced the sugar with Splenda, used SunMaid fruit bits, McCormick salad toppings instead of nuts, and bacon bits to save time. Kept to the amounts the same.  I also made it the night before.  We had soup and salad at my in-laws and there was hardly any left.

Yum-O!  I didn't grow up with broccoli salad, had only had it about twice in my life prior to making this.  It was delicious.  I made it for a family dinner and a 4th of July party. Each time I was asked for the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this for a shower and added spiral noodles, red grapes, and shredded cheese.  Used another reviewers advice of frozen broc and it turned out pretty good but next time I am going to try fresh broc.  It was a big hit at a recent baby shower I hosted.

I have been making this recipe for years...ever since someone brought it to a potluck...I have never met anyone who didnot like it...I amke it exactly as the recipe calls for, except I use plain white vinegar...

If you subsitute grapes, as some have done, it is not the same at all...it really needs the raisins...and sunflower seeds...that is what makes it so tasty...for non meat eaters, I don't think it would hurt it any to leave out the bacon.

I don't understand how people can change the recipe and then bash it...in my opinion, if you don't make the recipe as written, then you should not say the recipe is bad, cuz you haven't tried the recipe...you have concocted your own recipe...which didn't turn out...

Try this as written first...and then if you want to change it, do whatever you like...but if you do it exactly as written, I bet you are going to like it!!!

Let me say, I don't like broccoli. A few months ago my in-laws brought over some broccoli salad. I was soooo hungry one day I had some. I tolerated it. So I thought I'd test out my taste buds again with this recipe. LOVED IT! I'm a vegetarian, so I omitted the bacon. I thought about imitation bacon bits but haven't tried it yet. I also used red grapes instead of raisins, as suggested! YUM!

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  My mother in law makes this and it is fantastic!  I'm so happy you shared.  We also like to change out the raisins for dried cranberries for a bit of a twist.

Love this salad. I'm on a dried cranberry kick so I added those instead of raisins and also added some grated sharp cheddar. Was a big hit and will definitely make again.

Fabulous salad!  I omitted the raisins and blanched the broccoli before continuing with the recipe.  I also halved the dressing as suggested by others.   Amazingly good.

Really good - maybe my idea of a head of broccoli is not the same as everyone elses but I had to buy TWO bunches of broccoli because it was way too saucy. We add an extra spoon of vinegar for zing, fresh cracked pepper, and omit the raisins. Sometimes we add a bit of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

This recipe has become one of the most requested recipe's I make.  I follow the recipe to the "T" however, I use Craisins instead of raisins (due to the number of people who just detest raisins) and I use "light" mayo, splenda, and turkey bacon (bake the bacon in the oven to get nice and crisp) to cut down on the fat grams, and it still comes out just as good as the traditional version.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I also made it for Fathers Day and my picky inlaws loved it as did my husband.  I only used half of the mayo and substituted it with sour cream and it was excellent!!!  I am making again, but this time I will use an entire broccoli bunch to make sure there are PLENTY of leftovers!!

I have made broccoli salad before, and this seemed pretty close to my original recipe (which I lost) so gave it a try. As the recipe stands, the dressing is too mayonnaise-y. I prefer mine to be a nice sweet vinigarette. I just upped the vinegar and sugar a bit to taste.

Very popular side dish at family gatherings.  I made with Crasins instead of raisins for Christmas, and using red wine vinegar instead of white because I had the red on hand.  Many people asked for the recipe.  You do need to use your own judgement as to the proportions of dressing and broccoli.  I did not put all of the dressing in.  Try working in some, tasting, and stopping when it tastes good to you.

This recipe rocks my socks off!!!  I not only chopped up broccoli, but I also used cauliflower.  It added another nice crunch, and it's just as good.  This recipe is part of my top ten!

This was SO good. I've had it before from the Whole Foods deli and it is just as good. Used red wine vinegar and used all the sauce. I will probably go without the bacon next time.

This salad is so yummy and couldn't be easier. I have made this three times, and there is never any leftover. I think it could do without sunflower seeds and raisins.

This one is truly wonderful. I followed the recipe exact except I added a cup of shredded cheese. Delicious!  I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I served this with ham for my Easter dinner.  My father in law who is a wonderful cook asked ME for a recipe!  I could hardly believe it!  It was sure a hit! I didn't have white vinegar so used apple cider vinegar, and added about 1/3 cup of shreaded cheddar cheese.  Will definately be making this again and again.

Yum!  Can't say it enough.  We decided to use this recipe for my wedding, we made all the food ourselves.  This recipe was such a hit we hardly had any left overs.  It was easy to make 100 servings too.  Of course I cheated and bought Hormel real bacon bits.  But it went together amazingly!  I'm making it again for a pot luck, I'm sure it will be a hit again :)

I love this recipe.  I always make it for my brother who is doing the low-carb diet,  I just use splenda instead of sugar.  

I usually add some dried cranberries when I make it. YUM!

Someone had made this Salad at a Company potluck. I quickly visited AllRecipes looking for a close comparison. I was pleasantly surprised by just how great this one. It was even better than the one I had at the Potluck. Definitely a crowd favorite.. I leave out the Raisins based on personal preference.

I told my boyfriend I was making a broccoli salad for a picnic and he grimaced.  Until he tried it!  He loved the salad and so did everyone else.  I left the bacon on the side for my vegetarian friend.  I also didn't use all of the dressing...the recipe made too much.  Definitely a good way to eat broccoli.

go easy on the sunflower seeds, cut it back to 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  EASY,EASY,EASY to mix up and everyone seems to love this salad.  A winner for taste, texture, and convenience, and versatile.  (exchange dried cranberries or blueberries for raisens)

Excellent all around. Everyone commented how wonderful this salad was and asked for the recipe. I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  I thought 1 cup sunflowers seeds was too much so I used 1/2 cup and it was still plenty.  FYI - if you don't have white wine vinegar, regular distilled white vinegar is fine.

LOVE THIS!  I don't like raisens so I left them out, but I did add extra sauce and spiral pasta to make it more of a "pasta" salad--it was DELICIOUS!  Everybody loved it!  Great recipe!

I made this for a funeral dinner at church.  Was affraid the older women who bring the traditional standby's wouldn't like it. But, it turned out terrific!! It was the first salad finished and I got several calls for the recipe! Easy to make, was better after marinating overnight.  But didn't change anything on the recipe. Thanks!

This is such a great recipe!  My whole family loved the salad.  Thank you!  Delicious!

Note:  I had the recipe scaled to 8 servings, and I only put in 2/3 cup of sunflower seeds, not 1 1/3 cup.

Very good.  I made it with Miracle Whip by mistake, not realizing that there would be a kick to the taste, but it came out okay still, and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't add as much sugar, and added more vineger wine.

I really love this salad, and I make it often even if I dont have all the ingredients on hand.  It is adaptable.  I love the bacon in it, but I didnt feel like cooking any tonight and made this salad without it anyway, and its still delicious.

This was the best salad ever!  My 20 month old and my 5 year old had two helpings!  Of course my 5 year old made the salad (wink, wink) all by herself, so she felt proud to eat her creation.  But my little one is very fussy when it comes to her palate and I never thought she'd eat it.  It sat on her plate until all the rest of her food was gone, then she bravely put a small piece of the brocolli in her mouth and apparently it passed her taste test because she began to shovel all the rest in! We will definitely use again.

I was looking for a salad to make for an upcomming potluck and when I saw this recipe, I remembered I had made it years ago.  It was a hit back then and I know it will be a hit again.  I do recall the recipe I used previously had curry powder in the dressing.  It really added zip.

This was a big hit even with the kids!  I used regular white vinegar and only 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds.  It was perfect!

Fabulous!  Made this for an office party and it was a hit.  (Made a separate batch w/o bacon for the vegetarians, so everyone got to enjoy.)

We liked this very much, but I did steam the broccoli for a few minutes, so it wasn't quite so bitter tasting.  My husband loves cooked brocoli but he's not a great fan of fresh, so this worked perfectly!

I bring this to all my summer gatherings and everyone raves!  A real time saver is to buy the fully cooked bacon in the meat department at your grocery store.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  I left out the onion, because my family does not like it, and it still turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely make this again.

This receipe tastes so good when you just finish making it!  I wouldn't recommend making it ahead of time, though...I made it the night before a party and when I took the plastic wrap off, the brocolli had a pretty bad smell.  I will stick to making this the same day I'm serving it.  Thanks for an interesting receipe that everyone loved!

I used this recipe on a "girls" week-end away at a friend's cottage.  I forgot to bring the raisons and when preparing the recipe, forgot to add the sugar.  Everyone said it was delicious in any event!  I will definitely use it again.

This is SO good! I like to use halved red and/or green seedless grapes or craisins in it too, and sometimes I leave out the bacon and onion. It's pretty versatile.

I have been making this salad for years and everyone loves it!  Who ever thought raisins and brocolli would go so well together?
I have never added sesame seeds to mine, but when I followed your recipe, it was a hit as well.  I have always added some of the bacon in the salad and reserved some for the topping when I served.  It was a nice change and I am glad I checked your recipe out!  Thank you

FINALLY!!!  I've been trying (on and off) for YEARS to find out how to make this salad!  I first got it at a wonderful Amish deli in NJ, and I just don't get enough from my once-a-year trip out there!  This salad is the Amish recipe to a T!

Watch out!  It's addictive!

I made several batches of this salad for my son’s graduation party.  No leftovers, darn!  I substituted golden raisins for the regular raisins and added a little bit more sugar because the dressing tasted a little bitter.  The convenience was wonderful.  I made the dressing the night before and added it to the salad the day of the party.  Great salad, this is a recipe to keep.

Fantastic! I'd had something similar to this before and while this isn't exactly what I was looking for, it's pretty darn close! I've taken it to two potlucks this week and got rave reviews. I'll be taking copies of the recipe to work tomorrow to share with everyone in the office! I doubled the recipe because I wanted a good sized salad for a large group, and I used golden raisins because that's what I'd had before. Other than that, I followed the recipe as provided and loved the results. This will make an appearance in my kitchen again!

Great side dish!  I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone who tried it liked it.  Because it's a little unusual with such a variety of ingredients a lot of people hesitated to even try it.  Picky eaters need not apply!

This salad is SO good.  I made it in the afternoon and served it as a side dish for dinner.  My husband and eight-year old son loved it.  I do not like "raw" broccoli....too boring/bland, but this was crisp, tasty and and a nice presentation. I halved the recipe and still used a (small) "whole head" of broccoli.  I did not use stems, just florets.  This was just enough for four.  Thanks for sharing.

I used cider vinegar, fat free mayo, golden raisins, turkey bacon, and peanuts in this. Absolutely delish! Tastes just like a local cafe's wonderful recipe. Thanks Eleanor!

I tried this recipe for the first time for a graduation party and everyone loved it. I scaled it to serve 24, but used half the bacon and low-fat Hellmans, but noone noticed, not even my father who is anti-lowfat cooking. (The seeds and raisins made the difference.)

I've been making this salad for several years now but a little different.  Instead of white vinegar I use apple cider vinegar and instead of sunflowers seeds I use slivered almonds.  It's an excellent salad and a real crowd pleaser.

I'm eating sugar-free right now so substituted the real sugar with with"Just Like Sugar."  It was delicious (and so easy)!  My husband had 2 servings.  This is going to be a wonderful new addition to my side dishes.

Made it exactly as written and my broccoli-averse kids liked it a lot. Wondering if blanching the broccoli first would have help slightly. (Or perhaps making it a few hours before so that it could absorb the dressing and soften up.)

Delicious! I mixed the dressing in a bowl separately first so the sugar could dissolve.  Tastes best the day you make it. The next day the broccoli gets softer and I don't like that as much. It's best fresh.

Great broccoli salad but a bit on the fatty side.  If that’s not a concern for you - make just as it is written.  For me I wanted a bit healthier so I simply cut the mayo down to ½ cup and used a ½ cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt, I also only used 5 slices of bacon.  The longer this salad sits and marinates the better it tastes – make it a day ahead of time if you can.  Yummy!

Can I give it 10 stars? Every bite bursts with a different flavor in your mouth, and never gets boring. Even if you eat it three times a week! My son is the pickiest eater ever and this is the only vegetable-visible thing he'll eat without complaint. I've even added cauliflower if I've not had enough broccoli (heaven forbid!)

7 14 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16098/alysons-broccoli-salad/ ... Simple & delicious recipe for broccoli salad.  I like the broccoli, cauliflower & many more ingredient salads better; but this was very good & much faster to make.  I let marinate in the fridge overnight & sprinkled on the sunflower seeds right before serving.  Quite yummy.  I'm sure a cup would be overkill, but my bunch of broccoli may have been small.  I'd use a bit less sugar next time, since the raisins add sweetness; or maybe a splash of vinegar.  PS This submitter's Baked Pumpkin Bread is great!

amazing! first time I've made it and it was delicious. I used three smaller heads of broccoli and doubled the onion and used one cup crasins. I did half mayo half sour cream and did have some sauce left over...all just personal preferences, but it turned out great and everyone loved it!

My husband makes a special request everytime we have a BBQ. I use grapes instead of raisins as the latter tend to be much sweeter. I also add pecan or walnuts. It's just so good.

I don't like raw broccoli but I LOVE this recipe!  My suggestion is to separate the broccoli into TINY flowerets so the other ingredients blend in proper proportion.  My whole family thinks it is amazing!

This was really good!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because one part of the recipe says it is ready in 30 minutes, and the other says to put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  I went with the 30 minutes, and it was still quite good.

This is a good recipe although and the cider vinegar is better. I also put in mine cauliflower, celery and parmesan cheese about 1/4 cup and mix it with 2 cups mayo, the vinegar and sugar. try it. It's delicious, everyone loves when I make it!

Was very good. I used Oscar Meyer real bacon bits and eliminated the frying of the bacon and smelling up the house. Also thought I had sunflower seeds but didn't. But the cashews I had on hand were a wonderful substitute.

I've been making a recipe like this for 30 years and it IS addictive.  You can also use dried raisins (craisins) instead of regular raisins.  I don't use quite as much mayonnaise as it gets too goopy (and rich) or as many sunflower seeds, but really a wonderful salad.

This is one of the best picnic foods.  It's excellent with grilled chicken and lemonade.  I do think it's a little sweet so I usually cut the sugar in half.  I'm going to have to try it with fresh grapes some time!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have never liked broccoli salad until I was requested to do so for my sister's reception. Based on the reviews, I opted for this recipe over the rest. EXCELLENT CHOICE! I usually add a few more sunflower seeds and for leftovers, I add an additional cup or two of fresh broccoli to liven it up. My husband thinks it's even better the second day. YUM.

Delicious! Modified: omit raisins, half sugar, add half head of broccoli, replaced white wine with apple cider vinegar, used mayo with olive oil (green bottle, not blue), and precooked bacon. Done in ten minutes. A great recipe to use when craving broccoli and salad in one. I did find that the original recipe doesn't make broccoli the main ingredient. In fact, it's battling with sunflower kernels. When I stirred the ingredients together with original measurements, it looked like more clumps of unnecessary sunflower kernels. Adding that extra half head of broccoli really made the difference. Didn't want to call it Sunflower Salad. That's just wrong. Amazing dish!

This is a wonderful recipe!  A friend of mine made it for a get together and I had to have the recipe afterward.  I love it!  I definitely add more onion than called for, because I love red onion, and I definitely use halved red grapes instead of raisins. Everything else is spot on!

SO much better than the grocery deli case. I buy already cut up bagged broccoli and put in half the bacon and seeds the night before so the flavors will meld. I add the other half in before serving. A big hit with our vineyard workers and hubby!

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly.  the sauce was okay.  Although I love sunflower seeds, i thought there were way too many and overpowering.  I won't make it again.

I took this to a family cookout. I enjoyed it and my aunt enjoyed it but I think everyone else was very "meh" about it. There were a lot of leftovers. Maybe they just aren't fans of broccoli salad? I thought it was good though!

this is an EXCELLENT SALAD! I wouldn't get carried away with putting too much in it ..I'd stick to the basics...I just added chopped raw broccoli, diced Spanish onions(I think red onions a little too strong for this recipe)and bacon fried crispy (crumbled). I added everything at once and its PERFECT! P.S. I did add 2 tbls honey instead of sugar in mayo

Amazinggggg!!! Had 9 adults over for dinner and EVERYONE loved this! Best part is that is can (and should) be made the night before so the flavors mix and the broccoli can soften a bit... One less dish to make the day of the party! I cheated too... I bought 'real' bacon bits. I'll definitely be making this again!!!

My husband went back for THIRDS,and he does not like broccoli! So this one is a keeper.  I didn't have few ingredients.  I had to substitute green grapes for the red, the sunflower seeds for slivered almonds, and yellow onions for the red.  It was still wonderful!  I also recognized the dressing as my mother's coleslaw dressing that we have made for years.  This was a wonderful twist on that flavor that the family has always loved. I will definitely make it again with the proper ingredients.

This recipe is ridiculously delicious! This coming from someone who as a general rule does not put sweet fruits of any kind in her salad. My tips: Make the night before. Add cubed cheddar the day of. Add bacon(cheat and use the bagged bacon bits from Costco) before serving. Omit sunflower seeds. Double the recipe if you're a large group because it disappears fast.

This is a great salad recipe. I especially love that the dressing doesn't have a lot of added sugar, like most of these types of summer salads do. I took a shortcut and used real bacon bits and subbed a few of the raisins for dried cranberries, for a sweet/tart element. Also added in some shredded cheese. Not totally necessary adjustments, but all made it a bit more interesting.

This recipes was a hit. I'm not a raisin fan so I left those out. I also didn't have any bacon, so I sliced up a few pieces of salami instead. I also used sliced almonds (I toasted them for a few minutes in a frying pan before adding) instead of sunflower seeds.

too much vinegar and we prefer slivered almonds over sunflower seeds.  Also agree halved seedless red grapes in place of raisins.

This is very good, the only thing I changed was, I left out the raisins, and added chopped boiled eggs and shredded cheddar cheese.

I am asked to make this for several events throughout the year. I use two heads of broccoli and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Add the dressing SPARINGLY. If you add too much it will be soggy...But this is a great recipe!

This is a great recipe for a barbecue or party. I like to add a cup of matchstick carrots. Sometimes I decrease the amount of dressing or increase the broccoli, but the original ratio is great as-is. Also works with Splenda, although there's not a ton of sugar to start with.

I used half the amount of sunflower seeds called for in this.  I also used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (didn't have it) and it turned out just fine!  

This isn't exactly a 'healthy' option with all the bacon, but it was VERY good!

this was a good and easy recipe but instead of using raisins I used sun dried cranberries. also some aged cheddar cheese really adds a nice sharp taste, complements the cranberry.

I would give this more stars if possible - I sometimes use half broccoli and half cauliflower - I do use craisins - everywhere I've taken it - there are no leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe

When I make this salad, I use 1 cup mayo, 1/2 sugar, 1/4 vinegar, easily multiplied for larger batches of this incredible salad.  Little tip : Make the sauce a day early, and let it sit in the fridge overnight, gives it a lot more zip.  (I also use fat free mayo to cut the calories by quite a significant amount)

Fantastic!  I have made it diabetic friendly by substituting equal for sugar per the conversion chart.  I also use apple cider vinegar and the WHOLE package of bacon.  It's always a hit and never any leftovers.  Perfect for pot lucks at the office.

The very best salad....  I have been making this from a different recipe that I received from a family member.  Our recipe also calls for the golden raisins, which are much juicier and more plump.  We also add 1 c of shredded cheddar cheese!!!  Cheese makes anything taste better!  I tend to buy the precooked crumbled bacon near the salad dressings at the grocery store, works just as well and less messy.

I love this salad! Such a nice change for a broccoli side dish.  I forgot to add the raisins, but we didn't miss them.  I also subbed white balsamic vinegar and added a tsp of garlic salt.  Very yummy!

If you're like me (not the biggest fan of mayonnaise), this was a bit heavy on the mayo.  I would recommend toning that back a tad, as well as lowering the amount of sunflower seeds - it felt more like sunflower seed salad as opposed to broccoli salad.  I didn't use fresh grapes as opposed to raisins, but I'd bet that's an improvement.

This salad is so good my hubby thought I'd bought this salad from the deli.  Instead of cooking bacon, I used a bag of ready crisp bacon bits.  I did not have white wine vinegar so used plain white vinegar instead. Also didn't have the onion or sunflower seeds on hand and it still turned out fantastic!

YUMMY,,,just what I was looking for, and this from a long standing broccoli LOVER!  But seriously?  A whole cup of sunflower seeds?  Unless you eat from a bird feeder you can quarter that amount and still have plenty of crunch! Great recipe otherwise!

Very good!  I used pre-cut broccoli, left out the onions, 3 packets of splenda instead of sugar and fat free mayo.  I waited to mix in the bacon and sunflower seeds before serving so that they stayed crunchy.  It turned out great!

So easy and soooo good.  My good friend's mom always made a similar salad for us when we were young but she used cauliflower also.  I used fat free mayo which I cut down to 1/2 cup only.  i also made a batch using fat free plain yogurt- again only 1/2 cup.  Be sure to add the bacon last as it does get very soggy after a while and the crunch and flavor it adds when freshly added is the best!  I keep extra pieces of turkey bacon that I cooked in the microwave in the fridge to add to individual servings.

The salad is great although I think 1 cup of mayo & sunflower seeds is a lot.  We only used 1/4 cup sunflower seeds and 3/4 mayo...next time I will only use 1/2 cup mayo.  Also, we substituted red wine vinegar as some other reviewers suggested and we like it...I think you could use white, red or balsamic...more of a personal preference.  :-)

Awesome!  took to a 50th birthday party.  Was asked to make for next party.  My changes:  Used 1 lb bacon instead of 10 slices and cut them in pieces with a kitchen scissors before cooking.  This way we didn't have to crumble anything.  Used 4 florets instead of 1 head and added 1/2 cup of red seedless grapes, halved.  Every else the same.

I've made variations of this salad for years. I basically like the dressing but tune it to my own taste. I vary the vinegar. Today I used red wine and really don't measure out the mayo, wine or sugar, just to taste. Today I added red grapes, golden raisens and craisens. It is a great start to a salad recipe. One can add about anything you like to this and it would still taste great. Mandarin oranges would be good too. I also used green onions instead of red as I didn't have any.

Loved it, the dressing is perfect. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I took it to a family potluck and the only complaint was the raisins. Next time I will used grapes.

This is easy to make and pretty good. I couldn't help but think something was missing though. Maybe the dressing was too simple. I probably won't make this again.

Absolutely outstanding.    Nice alternative to the typical salads you see on a buffet or at a barbeque.

I've used this recipe, as well as one calling for red wine vinegar and red seedless grapes, with my family many times. The fresh grapes make a difference.

This really is a great! recipe. Loved it. My tweak: steam the broccoli for approx. 2 mins in the microwave (brocolli florets in a bowl, a little (enough to steam) water on the bottom, damp paper towel to cover bowl). mix the steamed broccoli with the onion and raisins. Let the broccoli COOL a bit (otherwise the mayonnaise dressing will curdle) and then pour the dressing over. The steaming opens the "pores" ;) of the broccoli which intensifies and quickens the marinating process it seems (and I'm no Cordon Bleu chef). Steaming the broccoli a little is good for those (like me) who don't like the taste or texture of raw broccoli. You can even stick the just-steamed broccoli in the freezer for a minute (literally 1 minute) to flash cool it so it doesn't over cook itself. I also put the whole mix (broccoli mix + dressing) in a large zip lock bag and toss, and then refrigerate like that. It's easy to portion out from the bag for a family on the go. :)

I am addicted to this salad.  I have made it several times and my husband and I always end up fighting over the last delicious bites.  I don't use at much bacon (maybe 6 strips) and I use peanuts instead of sunflower seeds, just because that is what's in my pantry.  Super good!!!

This was good. I used less bacon and half the sugar. It was still really sweet. Next time I'll cut back more on the sugar and raisins.

You DON'T have to use anything you don't want to use really. This recipe calls for R A I S I N S, for a reason. They belong in this recipe. I've made it both ways and raisins are the way to go. This is a wonderful salad I have been making for years. Always turns around those broccoli haters, even I was a raw broc hater til I found this recipe. 
Thanks John!

This recipe is excellent. Personally, my head of broccoli must have been a little small because there was too much dressing. However, the dressing was wonderful and I'm sure adding extra broccoli would fix this right up!

I have tweaked this recipe a little - using "Craisins" instead of raisins, and toasted pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds (and about half of what's called for). Also, I cut the dressing amounts in half (vinegar, sugar, and mayo) as I found I lost the flavor of the remaining ingredients otherwise...great "working" recipe!

Very rich.  Two heads of broccoli wasn't enough to balance out the other ingredience.  Next time I will use four and try one less tbsp of vinager.  Really good though.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I've read about all the modifications you can make but I'm sticking with the original.  I'm not a big fan of raisins in dishes but they work well in this salad.  I think the best texture/taste combination is after about 6-8 hours in the fridge.  Things start to get too soft after that point for my particular preference.

the flavors are all really good, but the dressing was WAY to much for the amount of broccoli. Next time (if there is one) I will cut the amount of dressing in half.

This was delicious! Due to my family's taste I used blanched broccoli instead of raw, craisins instead of raisins, and toasted almonds instead of sunflower seeds. Will definitely make again!

The only ingredient I have changed in this recipe is to used chopped walnuts instead of sunflower seeds. I have always gotten rave reviews when I take this salad to gatherings..and have memorized the recipe so I can share with others on the spot!

Not that you need another review but... I just got a call from DD asking for the recipe so she could make and take to an office luncheon Friday. We had it Sunday for Easter and there wasn't any left over.  Salad was delightful and a big, big hit.  Thank you!

I have made this recipe numerous times, as it's the dish my co-workers always demand I bring on Food Day.  It's also the only way I care to eat raw broccoli.  I substitute halved red grapes for the raisins, and I find most people like that better.  I also cut the dressing by about a 1/3, as I prefer it a little lighter.  Refrigerating it prior to serving is important, to allow the broccoli to soften.  I've also used bacon pieces from a jar, to eliminate the step of cooking the bacon.  Regardless of the tweaks, everyone always raves about it - you can't miss with this one.

Suggestion:  Add to all ingredients, a portion of bag of Broccoli Slaw that is in most supper markets.  Makes nice texture and also makes larger batch of salad.

Great salad. My 14 yo step-daughter raved "This stuff is awesome!", a REAL compliment. :) Have made several times now following the recipe pretty closely. I have also added hard boiled eggs and served as a main course for a cool, quick,no-cook summer meal. Yummy

Followed recipe as written.  Very good.  All enjoyed.  Did not use all of the dressing, probably just as well for less fat and calories.

Really good! Makes a LOT so make sure you don't have leftovers because it doesn't keep more than a day or so in the fridge.  We had so much I ended up wasting a ton of it :(.  Used craisins and I liked that a lot too :)

This is awesome!  My daughter and I love broccoli, but no one else in the family does.  Thankfully I was asked to bring a vegetabe dish to a holiday gathering, and this was it.  It received rave reviews and the host asked to keep the very little bit of left overs.  I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar.  That is the only change I made!

Perfectly delicious! Substituted apple cider vinegar for the white wine vinegar. Also, you can save some time by buying pre-cooked bacon.

wow!  I made this salad last night for my office potluck today; mixed the broccoli, onions, raisins and sauce last night, and threw in the bacon, sunflower seeds and some grated cheese just before the potluck - it was AWESOME! I thought I had made a huge amount, but the bowl was one of the first to be emptied.  I'll be making this again!

We really like this, but have made some minor changes.  Instead of raisins, we use Craisins (dried cranberries).  Also, after the second batch, we decided to omit the bacon.  Matbe its because we used turkey bacon, but we really prefer the flavor without.  Its very easy and yummy though, and great alongside a turkey burger recipe I found on this site (Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers).

This is one of my all time favourite salad recipes! The only thing I do differently is I add Craisins instead of Raisins as we are not a fan of Raisins in our house! I also add toasted Almonds! Love Love LOVE this salad!

Good recipe, I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe some. Cut the Mayo in half and added a 1/2 C of Sour Cream and a dash of Ranch. It also makes a huge difference if you blanch the veg 1st.

It was good.  Will maybe try fewer sunflower seeds next time, and maybe the real bacon bits in the package next time instead of making my own.

DELICIOUS!!!  Substituted halved grapes as other reviewers suggested (and doubled the amount as well).  Also used a packet of splenda instead of sugar.  A fabulous combo of sweet and savory and crunchy.  Loved this recipe!!!  Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I used golden raisins and it turned out GREAT!! The mix of sweet from the raisins and tangy from the vinegar was perfect. I will definitely make it again.

Yum, this is so good!  I used low fat mayo and Splenda.  Also used halved grapes instead of raisins just because we don't like raisins and omitted the sunflower seeds cuz I didn't have any.  It was so good!  A refreshing salad and nice change from potato or macaroni.  Thanks for sharing!

I only give this a  4 because the proportions are off a bit.  Made as is, it's quite bitter from the vinegar.  It needs more sugar, probably close to 1/2 cup, and less vinegar, probably 2 T.  The sunflower seeds are too high a dose, also.  It is best when left overnight to meld flavors and to let the broccoli soften up a bit.  Very good with these changes.

Made for a huge family party & every last bit of it was gobbled up!  Many asked for the recipe & I'm making it again tomorrow upon request for Easter.  Used craisins instead of raisins & sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds.

My mother in law has been making this for years and it's one of our favorites! We made this last week and there were no leftovers :o) Very tasty....and easy to throw together. We do our's the day before mixing everything but the bacon. It seems to taste better if you leave it a full night...then mix in the bacon right before serving.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made just a few changes. I replaced the red onion with green onion, replaced the raisins with craisins and replaced the sunflower seeds with Sugar Coated Pecans (from allrecipes). Yum!

The smell of this salad was not delightful. For that alone it should be docked a star.  This salad was pretty good, though it had a lot of dressing (probably to disguise the broccoli).  I ended up using a ham substitute type bacon and candied walnuts (to make up for the crunch missing from the non-real-bacon substitute).  It turned out pretty well, but the smell doesn't really make it very appetizing.

The combo of flavors in this recipe is just perfect!  The only minor change I would suggest would be to use golden raisins (instead of red).  They are a little sweeter and compliment this recipe very well.

This is so good!!! I never had this, no one ever told me about it..where have I been? I'm so glad I decided to make this. My husband raved about this salad more than I did! The only thing I left out were the sunflower seeds. Other than that this salad gets five stars! I made this salad 3 times already since Thanksgiving, and only three because I didn't want to wear it out before Christmas! lol Thank you!!

Oh, how I love this recipe. You can really speed it up by using bottled Coleslaw dressing (Newman's Own is the best) and bacon bits. I make this dish often for potlucks - overnight in the fridge is a MUST for flavor! If I am making it only for myself, however, I make an extremely light version using fat free mayo (10 calories per tbsp vs 100 in full-fat version and SAME TASTE) mixed with whatever fake sugar I have on hand in place of dressing. I go back and forth between raisins and split red grapes, but the one thing I ALWAYS leave out is the sunflower seeds! I sometimes will sprinkle on slivered almonds a few hours before serving (too soggy if chilled all night) but it's just as good without. Thanks, Alyson!

This is a great recipe.  I used less mayo, grapes instead of raisins & turkey bacon. DELICIOUS.  One tip:  slowly add the mayo/sugar/vinegar mixture.  You may not need as much as called for.  I think it depends on how big your broccoli head is.  So be careful.  Adding too much would make it a soggy mess.

I read all the reviews and was impressed so I made this for a potluck at work.  It was a SMASH and several asked for the recipe!  I made some for home and my son loved it and wants it again. He especially loved the dressing.  I made it exactly as the recipe...and it was great...I then added some grated cheddar cheese on some and it was sooo good too...I highly recommend this recipe!  Thank you!!

I couldn't believe it when I saw this recipe was rated 5 stars by 488 people, so I HAD to try it. It's great, the bacon really throws it over the top! I used frozen broccoli,and I over-cooked it, but the salad still tasted great. This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe with rice vinegar and splenda and red seedless grapes since some of my family members do not like the raisins.  I have also used pecans or walnuts. This recipe is the best for potlucks and bbqs.  Men, women and children love it! This is requested by my family many, many a time.  I have to take extra copies of the recipe with me when I make it, because people ask me for it. LOVE IT!!!

I make this recipe all the time. I used toasted sliced almonds, craisins, a little less sugar, and probably double the bacon. I also add black pepper to this recipe and use whatever vinegar I have on hand. They all work (well, I don't know about balsamic--never tried that one), but you might need to cut down the sugar if you are using a sweeter vinegar like rice wine.

Even with only 4 slices of bacon this salad is outstanding! Sometimes I use toasted pecans instead of sunflower seeds just to add variety. I also make it with Splenda and decrease the mayo and still get rave reviews. Even self-proclaimed non-broccoli eaters ask for seconds!

I had a co-worker a long time ago bring a dish similar to this to our potluck.  This is such a nice salad.  It has so many different elements that complement one another.  I didn't have any sunflower seeds so I toasted 1 pkg. of slivered almonds and it was great that way too.  This is a keeper!

This broccoli Salad was off the hook! I made it for my son's birthday party and even HE liked it. And he's 3 and hates broccoli. I put white golden raisins in it and everyone raved. It was sooo good I am making it again this weekend for myself!

Great recipe! But I only used half the bacon and sesame seeds to cut some of the fat in this recipe (apparently 48g per serving according to Allrecipes!) I also used light mayo and only used 2/3 of the dressing - maybe my head of brocoli was a bit small or just a matter of taste (some like it really creamy, I didn't want that much) Either way, it was really good and everyone enjoyed it. A nice way to eat brocoli at lunch!

Great salad! I doubled the broccoli, onion and grapes to basically reduce the amount of dressing and it was still awesome. I also left out the bacon (vegetarian) and the seeds (didn't have any).

I've made this for several occasions and everyone loves it, even those who don't have much love for regualar broccoli.  This makes a lot of dressing so I use more like three heads of broccoli.  I tried a shortcut by using store bought real bacon bits but they just did not have the flavor that freshly made bacon does, so it's worth it to take the time to cook the bacon yourself.

Good basic recipe.  I found it to be somewhat 'wet'.  I ended up adding extra broccoli.  Next time I would cut the dressing amount almost in half.  Other than that it was excellent.

I don't like my salads too creamy so I used half the amount of mayo (actually I didn't use mayo, I used salad dressing like Miracle Whip) and it tasted great!  Took it to a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.

I really enjoyed this salad. I did not change a thing, next time I will use half the red onions suggested. I found then a little overpowering. I agree with other rewiers best the next day or two. Hubby and kids werent crazy about it, but that just left more for me....

This recipe is yummy. It tasted too much like vinagar - but, it's probably because I used Miracle Whip because it was all I had. But, still.. very good!

This was so good!  I don't even really like broccoli, I kind of force my self to eat it. This time I went back for seconds!  I just used white vinegar because that's what I had and golden raisins.  I probably added only a 1/4 C of sunflower seeds.  Have leftovers in the fridge and I think I'm going to go eat some right now for breakfast!  (Next time I'm going to try making it with turkey bacon, I don't think it'll make much of a difference.)

Great recipe!  I threw in some shredded cheese and used craisins like many of the reviewers suggested. I like to let it sit overnight so that the broccoli soaks up the dressing.  If you do let it sit overnight, make sure you don't add the bacon, nuts, sunflower seeds, etc (basically anything with a crunch to it) until just before serving.

What a great way to get in those raw veggies! This is so good that it's wanted at all family gatherings. I don't know why, but, I've always used golden raisins instead of the dark ones. This recipe goes into the family favorites for sure. Thanks John!

excellent salad!  i did make a couple changes since i didnt have the exact ingredients on hand.  i added another head of broccoli because there was too much dressing.  so then i doubled the raisins and i shouldn't have - too many!  i added cashews and bacon bits as i ate the salad so they wouldnt get soggy sitting in the salad.  thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good. Didn't have any sunflower seeds on hand so I just left them out. I think next time, it will be even better with the seeds. It's a keeper.

Very nice recipe, excellent cold salad that you can spread out over a few days.     I used Miracle Whip in lieu of Mayo and  toasted almonds instead of sunflower seeds, but there's a lot of ways you could substitute and keep this recipe tasty.  Will definitely make again.  =Dave

Perfect! Only thing I did different was used red wine vinegar instead of white. This would be easy to make lo-carb, just use Splenda instead of sugar.

my mother in law 1st made this salad for my wedding shower & then again at my baby shower. i have now have the recipe and make it for my side of the family and work events. it is awesome! i always get asked for the recipe. try changing it up with golden raisins or low fat mayo, but don't touch the bacon. it really does make the salad.

I doubled the salad ingredients (kept the dressing portions as written and omitted the sunflower seeds) hoping to have leftovers after our casual Christmas Eve dinner for 6 adults + 2 kids.  No such luck... the bowl was licked clean!!

excellent!  I have made this recipe for years & even after all the years making it, I still get requests for the recipe....it is most definitely well liked.  So easy... I do change it up sometimes instead of raisins I'll use craisins or dried cherries....not a big taste difference but just a little tartiness.  I do like to use splenda for a sugar substitute. (FAVORITE SALAD!!)

My husband said this broccoli salad was to die for.  I agree!  But he inhaled most of it.  He hates onion so I substituted with 1/4 cup chopped Granny Smith Apple.  Try it. Yum!

This is a wonderful, tasty salad.  I have made this many times for my family and get rave reviews, and an empty bowl every time!  The only thing that I change is that I cut down on the onion.  I put only about half of what it calls for because raw onions tend to be a really strong flavor in this salad.  It is great for pot luck night!

Wow! This salad was surprisingly awesome. I was skeptical with the odd blend of ingredients, but it turned out great. Others were impressed as well and I had a couple recipe requests. I will add this to the keeper file for potlucks and other get-togethers.

I Love This Recipe!  
It's SO easy, fast, and delicious.  I make it even easier by cooking my bacon in the microwave.  It's great to have a dish that doesn't require any cooking, especially on a hot summer day.  Fantastic!

Simply Wonderful!  Just started doing Weight Watchers and made this with low fat mayonnaise and splenda. Only 3pts per serving with the sunflower seeds.  This is a keeper.

I'm normally not a fan of raw broccoli, but I found myself going back for seconds of this! Spectacular! I used 2 broccoli crowns, and it was perfect for the amount of dressing, onions, & raisins. I decreased the amount of sunflower seeds to 1/2 cup, and used a handful of Bacos instead of real bacon. Be sure to let the salad sit overnight - it makes a huge difference in the taste, and the salad absorbs the excess dressing. Great recipe!

I lowered the calories by using half light sour cream and half mayonaise - added 1/2 head cauliflower, used green onions, golden raisins, and red-wine vinegar.  Everyone wanted the recipe so thanks for sharing!!

I did add a little more broccoli, but this is the perfect recipe that I have been looking for. Just like my Aunt makes.

This is very good.  The only thing that I found was that it was too sweet for a salad.  I reduced the sugar to suit my taste the second time and it turned out great.  Thanks

Excellent blend of flavors,  I actually used maple flavored bacon only because it's what I had on hand, yummm!   Planning on making this again this weekend for a family get-together and will be specifically buying the maple flavored bacon again.

Very yummy! I added a few extra sunflower seeds and raisins to entice the kids more. IT WORKED! They loved it and so did the grown-ups.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet. It has been saved in my favorites here since 2003, and I have been using this recipe since then. It is delicious! When I make it I will not eat anything else until it is gone. I think I am addicted!

It was soooo good! I made some slight changes - golden raisins & honey-roasted sunflower seeds as well as really peppery bacon. I would reserve a little of the dressing because I didn't end up using all of it -- a little too soupy. Very good recipe I'll use again.

I am not normally a big fan of brocolli but I tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  I have brought it with me to several cookouts this summer and have never been able to bring home leftovers!  I make it with light mayo.

I have to add another comment to this wonderful recipe. My husband is the world's pickiest eater and he LOVED this! The shocker to me is, last night he said "you need to make that broccoli salad again"!!!! I couldn't believe it! He already eats broccoli, but the combination of all the ingredients makes a delicious salad that even my super picky husband loves! THANK YOU!!!

I have made this recipe many times. I am going to a BBQ and the host requested I bring my "famous broccoli salad".  I used red wine vinegar and golden raisins.  The only thing I do different is add mandarin oranges.  It is not necessary but I like fruit in salad

Simple, tastes great and I can make it ahead of time - I'm glad I found this recipe!  I used turkey bacon and made the dressing with a combination of mayonnaise, sour cream and whole-milk yogurt.  I added a small handful of sunflower seeds, probably only a third of a cup.  This disappeared from the buffet table, which is amazing when I consider how many people usually won't touch broccoli.

Terriffic!  It is definately a must to use golden raisins in this recipe, it makes a HUGE difference.  Also, I used red wine vinegar instead of white, just because of preference.  ALSO:  much much better if you make it a few days in advance.  Needs to "rest" and soak up flavors. WONDERFUL recipe, THANK YOU!

This was my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! I used a 16oz. bag of Broccoli-wokly, the pre-cut florets sold in the produce section, perfect amount to the amount of dressing.

This recipe is great! I made it for a barbeque and it went over really well, even with those pickier individuals who don't eat their veggies.  Next time I would probably cut the sunflower seeds in half, and there was a bit of excess dressing (which to me means add more broccoli!).  I would recommend making this the night before and letting it sit in the refridgerator a night because the leftovers the next day were even better than the orginial serving!

I used red grapes instead of raisins, red wine vinegar instead of white, green instead of red onions, toasted pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds.  I reduced the sugar to 1T and did blanch the broccoli per some reviewers.  I was surprised at how good this was!  I'm not one for mixing sweet and savoury, but this was popular even with my 10 month old son.

A new favorite that will be made again and again.  There were many compliments on this salad, and requests for the recipe! The only thing I would change is the amount of dressing.  I would would add less next time.

I took to a potluck at work and it was the first thing gone.  I didn't have any raisins so I substituted 'Craisins' (sweetened dried cranberries) and used dry roasted salted peanuts instead of sunflower seeds.  Everyone wanted the recipe - and it's so easy.

I am following a low carb diet (Atkins) so I just omitted the raisins, seeds and sugar and added splenda and a few splashes of light cream.  BOY was it good.  Can't wait to go home and have more tonight.

THANKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was my first broccoli salad recipe, and I loved it!  I brought it to a Christmas party, and it went over really well.  The only things  I changed were the amounts of bacon and sunflower seeds.  We use a really thick-cut bacon, so I made 6 pieces instead of 10.  Also, I cut down the sunflower seeds by half.  I will definitely make this again--it was SO easy!  Thanks for sharing!!

Absolutely delicious!  My kids weren't crazy about it but all of the adults (who were skeptical) loved it and even went back for more!  Leftovers were still good the next day although there was only about 1/2 cup leftover. :)  Personally I will cut the quantity of sunflower seeds used in half the next time.  I thought there were too many and I am counting calories so it will save a little on the calorie count.  I also used lite mayo and the taste was still excellent.  Next time I might experiment with using Equal or Splenda sweetener instead of the sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent salad! I cannot go to a function without making it. I have made this salad with raisins as well as dried cranberries. Both are very good. Confirmed broccoli haters really do like this salad! Thank you for such a great recipe!

I must admit when I saw the ingredients of this recipe I was hesitant.  How could this combination taste good?  It tastes better than good...it's AWESOME.  I have made it for a couple of potlucks now and there is never a drop left.  Thanks for the recipe Eleanor!

I must admit when I saw the ingredients of this recipe I was hesitant.  How could this combination taste good?  It tastes better than good...it's AWESOME.  I have made it for a couple of potlucks now and there is never a drop left.  Thanks for the recipe Eleanor!

This was a huge hit. And it's true, it's broccoli for broccoli haters. Well, my boyfriend dislikes it, not quite hate, but he loved the salad! Everyone else loved it too. The only thing I would say about it is that I found there was too much dressing, but I got the bottom of the bowl, so that might have been it. Anyway, great salad!

I had this dish at a meeting last week and then ran home to search for the recipe.  It's such a yummy change from traditional green salads.  All the ingredients provide fabulous layers of taste, cruch, saltiness AND sweetness.

A very good cold broccoli salad. It is very close to what I sampled at a party during the holidays. A definite keeper.I omitted the sunflower seeds (forgot to buy them). I tried another version- Broccoli Salad from Jennifer Stephens but prefer this one.

Honestly, I thought the ingredients a bit odd, but together the salad is great.  A big hit at potlucks. I did what the others suggested and used 3 T of sugar and 2 T of vinegar and it was perfect.

This was great.  My family loved it.  We added the extra sugar that other folks suggested and it tasted great.  The one thing we will do without next year is the raisins. They just did not seem to go as well as the other ingredients.

Love this recipe!!  The only thing I did differently was to omit the bacon, as my guests do not eat red meat.  I mixed the salad just before serving, it was fresh, crisp and wonderful!!

Great salad.  Before serving, I toss the coated broccoli into a bunch of fresh spinach that I 
have washed and dried well.  I also use dried cranberries instead of the raisins.
Everyone loves it!

This was very good and my twelve year old son couldn't get enough of it.  To make it even faster, I use "real bacon bits" when I don't feel like frying up bacon.

Ok! Me and my daughter don't dig on mayo ( believe it or not!)..But if this your case..try to substitute for half of a medium potato ( cooked/mashed) + half tbsp olive oil (you can also add parsley to mashed potato - just enough to taste good - and black pepper .)..Turned up delish! it's in our recipe list. Thanks!:)

I have used this recipe for over a year now and it is one of my family's favorites.  When I make it I have to at least quadruple it.  I do not add the bacon, but do add shredded carrots for color and added nutrients. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to make it without the dressing being watery.  I have tried to spin the broccoli in my salad spinner to remove excess water after washing it and that seems to help, but it still is too runny. Thanks, Glorytofaith

This is also very good when using shredded broccoli slaw found in the pre baged salad section of the store.  It cuts down on prep time, and makes a great cole slaw.

Made this for 4th of July and it disappeared.  Excellent salad.   Just about everone wanted the recipe.  I bought pre-cut broccoli flowerettes and got pre-cooked bacon so I had this salad ready in maybe 10 minutes - make twice what you think you need because it will disappear in a hurry.  Everone wanted the recipe.  This ones a keeper

I really had never heard of this recipe until my husband said something about it. So I looked it up and it turned out to be a big hit at our friends bbq. Were also bringing it along to the July 4th bbq! Great recipe.

I got this recipe passed down from my husband's family.  I use red-wine vinegar and peanuts, instead of sunflower seeds.  I use light miracle whip and no bacon to be some-what healthly.  Everyone loves it and I given out the recipe several times.

Used about 1/2-3/4 cup of canned bacon bits, didn't have the time to cook the bacon myself. It seemed to come out fine. Everyone at our family picnic was raving about this recipe and all wanted to know how to make it.

An unlikely combination-broccoli, raisins and nuts.  Sounds strange, but is's absolutely delicious!  I ate more raw broccoli in one sitting then I've eaten in my entire lifetime!!Delicious and easy to prepare.

Everyone enjoyed it, including the little ones.  I also made it using Kroger's Creamy Coleslaw Dressing for a milder flavor and received positive comments as well.

I have been making this dish as a salad for parties. It’s very popular and people love it. Sometimes if I run out of white wine vinegar, I use red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar. They are equally tasty! I also substitute sunflower seeds with sliced almonds or pecans if I don’t have it

I love this recipe. It’s great as is, but it’s also very versatile. I generally don’t need the bacon; the dressing is flavorful enough without it. I’ve made a variation of it using kale, slaw, and chopped broccoli (including the stems). You can easily substitute dried cranberries for the raisins, and nearly any seed or chopped/slivered nut will work instead of the sunflower seeds.

It was a little "sharp" tasting with the vinegar so I added an extra spoon of sugar. (Brown sugar this time).  Also added a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce for more depth of flavor. The family ate all of the salad. Will make this salad again. Thanks for sharing.

It's a lot like the broccoli salad from Souplantation. The longest and hardest part really is just cooking the bacon, which is WORTH IT, but more clean up.  Glad I found this recipe

Delicious recipe for Broccoli Salad! I've been making a similar broccoli salad from this site for years, but it's more of an eyeball and adjustment on the dressing. With this recipe, the ingredient amounts are perfect. Since we don't like raisins, I used dried cranberries. I'm also used to adding slivered almonds with the other recipe, but for this one I used a 50/50 split of slivered almonds and sunflower seeds and it was perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

Made this for a crowd of 40 & it got RAVE reviews from men & women. Used recommendations of red seedless grapes & adding most bacon before serving & think that made a big difference. The little that was left was being argued over by people who wanted to take some home, now that is success!

Pretty darn good! Substitutes- honey, apple cider vinegar, and all 3 heads of broccoli that come in the traditional bunch. however i eat all organic and i wonder if organic heads of broccoli are smaller? still saucy with all three heads and yet still devour-able. Tip if you do use honey make sure you mix it with the vinegar first, the acidity breaks down the viscosity and then makes for a nice thin blend to add to the mayo. Fabulous.

This was a huge hit for a Christmas dinner side dish.  I used craisins like someone else suggested, put half the bacon and dressing on the night before and added the other half with the sunflower seeds before serving.  Everyone loved it!!!

My Husband and Cousins LOVED this recipe. The only changes I made to it was that I added pre-cooked bacon, 2 cups of sunflower seeds, and a white onion instead of a red one. The recipe turned out amazing and I have been asked to make it again in the next few days.

Have made variations of this for years...
Unfortunately, I rarely measure so I can’t give exact substitutions...BUT...
Try using garlic dill pickle juice, instead of vinegar. Just adds flavor detentions.

I confess, I didn’t eat it. I don’t like broccolli, mayo or raisins! But we had some fresh broccoli to use, so  I made a small batch to try it out. My mom loved it though, and took a second helping, so I’ll try making it again when the rest of the family is here.

love these types of salad! I have tried this exactly as written and it was great! remade some time later and did not have raisins or white wine vinegar so I didn't add raisins and used apple cider vinegar instead and it was just as delicious! also on my remake I used the real bacon bits instead of cooked slices (once again because I did not have any on hand) it was just as good with extra bacon bits, not as balcon-y fresh bacon but is was still very good. I see lots of variations to this and I believe all would be great. But as written it is wonderful!

I made this dish for my club's potluck dinner on 8/31/18. I was at the end of the line and only got a tiny sample, but it was good. Next time, I will decrease the mayo, and only add 3/4c and use scallions instead of the red onion. I also used apple cider vinegar as the white wine vinegar was very pricey!

Loved this recipe - so good.
My changes were only to roast pine nuts and put in and also exchanging raisins for craisins.
Thank you

I didn't have any bacon so I made it without it.  I also used Red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  It was great-oh and I skipped the raisins.

I made 4 servings instead of 6, and the edits I made are so severe that this is technically an alternate recipe: only used 2 slices of bacon, and baked it in the oven instead of fried. Used Walnuts (wife's favorite) and the tiniest amount of red onion. Literally one slice, barely half an inch thick. Used red wine vinegar instead of white. Low-sugar craisins instead of raisins. Turned out fabulous. We are gonna make it again, for sure!

Great recipe! In place of the raisins, I used red seedless grapes cut in half, as suggested by a reviewer. I'm sure the raisins would be fine, but since I had the grapes on hand, I went with those. I halved the recipe, but doubled the grapes, and it was fine. I also skipped the sunflower seeds. This would be a nice, light summer lunch or side or something to bring to a cookout. Thanks!

Made this for food day at work with a green st Patrick's Day theme.
Made a few changes as I'm vegan-veganaise and bacos replaced mayonnaise and bacon. I used cranberries instead of raisins just because I don't like raisins.
No one knew I tweaked anything and raved about it. This will be a great go to summer salad.

Easy and yummy alternative to cole slaw. I left out the bacon and substituted dried cranberries. Really good. Keeps well. I've made it several times.

This is awesome! I used to buy this from Amish or Mennonite stand vendors at Lancaster County Central Market where I first tasted it. Their recipe is almost exactly the same except for sunflower seeds.

Doesn’t need so much mayo. Half a cup to 2Tbs is enough for one head of broccoli.

Just made this as a side for Thanksgiving dinner and it was GREAT! I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and had red wine vinegar on hand so used that instead of white. I doubled the recipe but still only used a cup of sunflower seeds, it was plenty. Will make this again for sure!

Great recipe and my family loved it.  I added my own twist by  omitting bacon (some don't like it), I used red wine vinegar and steamed the broccoli just for a minute to slightly soften it and make the color pop.  I sauteed red onion to take a little of the bite out if it.  Like many others, I used red grapes in place of raisins.

Delicious! Only made two changes... I'm not a huge fan of raisins, so I subbed with dried cranberries, and omitted the bacon.

If you're making this for people who don't like broccoli, I suggest cutting broccoli into the smallest pieces you can... with the dressing it doesn't give you that raw vegetable taste!

10/10 would recommend.

I have made this recipe many times over the years. Family loves it and requests it when ever they come home for visits. I have substituted dried cherries which, to me, give a good punch to the salad. I do cut them in half/quarters.

The proportions seemed off after chopping my normal-sized head(s)/stalks of broccoli.  Glad I caught it before following the recipe in its entirety.  I sized down from 6 to 4 servings for the remainder of the ingredients, and that seemed to do it.  I also dislike raisins, so I subbed dried cranberries and used slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds.  Also, we eat very little sugar and our tastebuds have adjusted accordingly, so I subbed 1 tsp of raw organic honey for the 1T + 1t of table sugar the sized down recipe called for.  It still had the mild sweet/sour flavor, and the cranberries add plenty of sweetness.

No, it's not the original recipe.  It was delicious and I have made it twice now with the changes I made.  I'm not sure I'd like it as written due to the amount of sugar and the large quantity of dressing that it would yield, but that might be what people like about this recipe.

We are not big vegetable fans so I am always looking for something different.  This was great.  Everyone loved it.  I even added an extra head of broccoli and it was perfect.  We did have some left over but the next day it was too soggy to eat.  Great fresh salad.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.

I didn't care for the vinegar to sugar ratio. Seemed to need to be a little sweeter.  Maybe I'll try apple cider vinegar next time also.

This was delicious except for one thing, the raisins. I picked them out though after tasting and replaced them with dried cranberries and that was much better and made this salad addictive.

06.05.17 ~ Quick, simple and delicious.  I scaled back the recipe as I didn't have the amount of broccoli called for.  It was enough for our supper and for my husband's lunch the next day.  The dressing amounts were spot on and added a lot of flavor to the salad.  I like that this version doesn't have shredded cheese added - just saves a few calories.  A great summer dish.

I made this last night and we loved it! The only change I made is that I blanched the broccoli for one minute and cooled it right away with ice water before adding to the salad. I will be making it again!

This was really good. I was uncertain how much broccoli to add for a large batch. I ended up with about 12 small bunches and 3 recipes worth of the dressing. I used craisins instead of raisins. Very nice mix between tangy, sweet and savory flavors.

I couldn't find white wine vinegar at the store so I purchased apple cider vinegar as a substitute... tasted fine to me, similar to my Aunt's recipe (which is why I made this). I didn't have time to make the bacon, but I threw in some grapes which were amazinggg!! I chopped my broccoli into bite sized pieces (pretty small) but still think I will chop them even more next time... will make again:) tastes very fresh

Great way to make raw broccoli taste amazing! I also used red grapes as many suggested as I am not a fan of raisins and probably used closer to two heads of broccoli with the same amount of dressing. It was delish.

I didn't use bacon and I substituted dried cranberries and pecans for the sunflower seeds.  It was great.  I've been buying a similar salad at a local deli but this is better.  It will be a staple in my house!

This had too much of a vinegary taste and the dressing was too rich despite letting it sit overnight. I had a similar salad  at a work brunch and really loved it so i thought  I could replicate it.  The ingredients were the same except the dressing didn't taste like the smooth creamy dressing of the brunch salad. Guess I'll still search.

The best broccoli salad I've ever had.  Absolutely perfect.  It's a bit of a chore, in my opinion, to make but is well worth the effort.  An excellent cold side for any picnic.

Cut the mayo and sugar in half, used balsamic vinegar and let it sit overnight - it was magic on my taste buds. Very easy to make, you can substitute ingredients and you can make it lighter on calories or even vegan if you want. This is definitely a keeper.

11.08.16 ~ DH had been asking for broccoli salad. He loved this recipe and told me so, three times during the meal! I made exactly as written. Served it with 'Roasted Pork Loin', 'Chef John's Baked Acorn Squash' from AR and Brussels Sprouts. (Election Night 2016)

I have made this recipe several times now, Very good recipe as is! It is important to make at least 2 hours ahead, as the acidity of the vinegar softens the broccoli which then doesn't seem as "raw". I have had to improvise on the timeline in the past, so I very quickly blanched the broccoli and drained well. This made up for the marinating time. I have also made it in a lighter version with half mayo and half light plain yogurt; equally delicious!

Used 2 (12 oz) bags of fresh broccoli florets. Perfect amount to soak up the dressing.  craisins instead of raisins, and only 1/2 c. of sunflower seeds. The first time I made it, I used 1 full cup and it was way too much. My guests always love this...even the non-broccoli folk.

Super and easy! I am a vegetarian, so I skipped the bacon. Also, you can use mixed seeds & nuts in place of sunflower seeds - adds interest.

I like others' suggestions about using craisins or halved grapes, although I didn't mind the raisins either. I used half the mayo and double the broccoli. The bacon and sesame seeds also seem excessive, so it's best to add them as needed before serving. Bagged bacon sounds like a good time saver. I may also try the frozen broccoli idea in a pinch.

It was good. Healthy and good. Especially if you are trying to no carb it or low carb it, I have made it before as is and made it the other day with no raisins and no sunflower seeds. I am in costarica right now and can't find either of those and is good without.

Delicious but very high in calories! Next time I make it I will use less sugar and less bacon.  Maybe 6-7 pieces of bacon.

I have several salad recipes that call for raisins and I prefer to use golden raisins.

Loved this recipe..    I cut down half the sunflower seeds and doubled the raisins.  I've also added grapes or strawberries when in season.

Made a few changes the second time I made it but still loved the original as well. My boyfriend loves mayo based dressings and requests this salad often!!!! If I take it to a pot luck my dish is always empty before it's over!!! I add way more brocoli than called for & add just a little more sugar because I like it sweet.

Used 3 crowns...was still plenty of dressing.  We prefer to add fresh grapes (1/4'd) and almond slices instead of  sunflower seeds.

This is a really nice recipe, as written. A favorite of mine for summer. Sometimes I just adjust the quantity of ingredients according to what I have on hand, or whether I am craving just a little more sweet, or tangy. I love this with smoked and grilled meats.

The best version in my humble opinion. For a change up I use pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower. Also if I'm in the mood for a salad with less bite, I substitute chopped Apple for the onion.

I love this salad.  I've made it so many times now.  SO easy to make and the only way I'll eat raw broccoli.  I usually don't put in sunflower seeds since I never have it on hand but otherwise I follow the recipe.  Def a keeper recipe

I made this for thanksgiving touts year and it came out great.  I tweaked the recipe with mixed berries(cherries, cranberries and blueberries) and everyone loved it!!  it was quick and easy.   I'll definitely be making this one again.  I'm going to try and tweak it even further to lower the calorie and fat content with done non fat yogurt to see what that tastes like.

My mother-in-law always asks me to bring this for family dinners. The only change I make to the recipe is to substitute craisins for the raisins. Don't forget to put the bacon and sunflower seeds in the salad just before serving. Love it!

Husband loved it! Skipped the raisins and added grapes as per the recommendation. Takes a long time to make for the cooking of the bacon and chopping of the broccoli. Use two heads, but otherwise same proportions.

Have made this for years.  It's my absolute favorite broccoli dish.  Get waaaay great compliments when I serve it.  It's a great way to get those veggies in your diet, and in a most pleasant way.  I have always used fresh, organic broccoli, so I can't speak to the frozen way.  One aside note:  I use a mild vinegar when making mine.  I do also, about half the onion called for.  You'll love it....

my husband love loves this, i literally make a huge batch, cant really go on a head of broccoli lol they are all different, I use a 9 x 10 glass dish as a measure of broccoli all cut up and ready , i like mine cut small, then a whole red onion also cut small, craisins rather than raisins , we like the tartness of them as well as the sweetness. and slivered almonds not sunflower seeds and then I literally double alysons sauce 2 cups mayo and 3/4 cup sugar and 7 tbls white wine vinegar ... and a lb of bacon .. its really only about 12 slices.. so with out actual measurements this is how I measure !! its delish..  always get requests for it .. sometimes I use splenda ( that measures just like sugar) this made exactly the 12 cup Tupperware container full to the brim. perfect picnic size !!funny thing is I hate when people change the recipe, but I feel like i kept the sauce/dressing the same !! enjoy !

I love this recipe, have made it for years. I use fresh red grapes sliced instead of raisins and omit the sunflower seeds.  The grapes give it a fresh not too sweet crunch.

Make sure the broccoli is dry before you add the dressing. Next time try less sugar.

Another 5 stars here. Of course I changed it to fit our preferences. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Also used 1/2 C Miracle Whip and 1/2 C real mayonnaise. And chopped cashews instead of the seeds. Sorry to review it with changes, but we have made it so many times and just basically love it. Great recipe.

Just made this recipe for a block party.  After reviewing the comments, I followed the suggestion of many others and substituted grapes for raisins.  I rarely use as much of any ingredient as the recipe states, but adjust according to taste.  The same holds true for the dressing.  I have tasted many a salad and/or side ruined by too much dressing.  Can't go wrong with this recipe, it was a hit.

Fabulous! I have made this recipe over 20 times and it's always well received. Even the broccoli haters enjoy it. It's perfect for a picnic outside on a warm day. I've tried both the raisins and the halved, red seedless grapes and much prefer the colour and taste of the grapes.

Great recipe - we had to make some alterations due to lack of ingredients in the house.  We left out vinegar, onion, and raisins.  We've had some with cheddar cheese, and so we added 1/2 c cheddar to the recipe.  We also reduced sunflower seeds to 1/2 c.  Someone mentioned grapes - I will definitely be trying that in the future.

I used craisins instead of raisins. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I made this a few hours in advance, yet it was just as crunchy and delicious days later. I accidentally added the sunflower seeds right away, it had no ill effect on their crunchiness. Waiting to add the bacon was a good idea. Will add this to my summer salad rotation!

Great base recipe.  I made this for a cookout, and I had to change a few things due to our guests preferences.  We had someone who won't eat raisins, so I had to leave them out (I personally think they would be a great addition.)  Instead, I added some shredded carrot and some shredded cheese.  I also switched out the seeds for sliced almonds.  Very good, and I really think you can switch this recipe up to cater to your tastes...very versatile!

Delightful! I might potentially double the dressing, but that might make it soggy (I like a lot of dressing - what might work is if you were making two batches of salad but made three batches of dressing and halved one between them). I used sunflower kernels instead of seeds with shells, and Oscar Mayer bacon pieces from the salad aisle instea of home-fried bacon. It's easy to overdo it on the kernels - 1 cup seeds would probably work out to far less in kernels. I sort of found it easy to overload the salad with those two ingredients. But it was a tremendous success for this novice broccoli salad maker - the whole family (five adults) loved it. :) Be sure and watch the awesome video - it's very helpful. :)

My hubby's not a mayo-lover so I just skipped it. We're fans of broccoli anyway so with just the vinegar and everything else, it tastes really nice! If it was just me, I might sub it with plain Greek yogurt.

I made this for a pot luck at work and everyone raved about it. The flavors came right together and even people who don't like broccoli wanted this recipe. I went the "healthier" route and used Splenda, low fat mayo and turkey bacon. I used the "Change Servings" calculator to make 18 servings and used three heads of broccoli, one head of cauliflower and added a tsp of ground pepper and a tablespoon of dried oregano to give the mayo dressing more flavor. I'll definitely make this again!

I broke the rules and made this salad for the first time for a pot luck. It was FANTASTIC. I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand, and I left out the onions because I didn't have any, but it was still absolutely delicious!!!  Highly recommend this--easy and terrific taste!

This recipe is delicious with adjustment to the dressing, there is way to much dressing made, the great part is you make the dressing separate and add it in, I recommend just adding enough to coat the salad allotting that you will also add bacon and sunflower seeds after chilling. My family loves this.

Excellent Recipe exactly as printed.  Compare broccoli size to a cauliflower head which is large and buy that much.

I ended buying extra broccoli based on the reviews and having to double or triple the sauce.  

I used cashews and golden raisins so delicious and even better the next day!  Great Easter buffet addition. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this many times, and love it!! I use dried cranberries in place of the raisins, yummy even though the color runs (If I make ahead, I just add te cranberries when I serve, to avoid this, but if it's just me eating it, I don't worry about it, still tastes good with pinkish dressing!) I use honey in place of the sugar, and always low-fat mayo....calorie conscious.  Also, sliced almonds in place of the sunflower seeds are great, too.

All of the ingredients in this salad taste so good together!  I use apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.

The great thing about this recipe is its versatility.  It is very good as written and it gives you a good base to start with and lends itself beautifully to your personal tastes.  Over the years we've made this a dozen different ways.  Any chopped nut can be substituted for the sunflower seeds.  Craisins, dried cherries, dried bleuberries for the raisins.  Flavored bacon, maple or hickory - or plain.  Green or yellow onion instead of red - or simply leave it out if you are anti-onion.  Cauliflower and broccoli.  Change the vinegar to suit your tastes - red or white wine, rice or cider.  A little less sugar, a bit more vinegar, thin the mayo a bit more with a little milk - you can easily make this your own. That makes it a great addition to your recipe box.

Very good!   Took some feedback from past reviewers: I blanched the broccoli, used grapes instead of raisins and it was delish!  I don't know why some people called the dressing "juicy"??? Maybe they're not measuring accurately?  Mine was on the thin side like cole slaw but by no means juicy.

I've been making this for at least 20 years. Minus the raisins (just because I don't like them). Add the sunflower nuts at the last minute. Dressing is 1 tbsp vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup mayonnaise. Never fails.

WOW!!! I made this salad for a BBQ this week...what a winner! I put some aside for us to have for later.  I realized that after marinading in the refrigerator for an extra day in its own juices, it was better.  I substituted Craisins(dried cranberries) for the regular raisins...that was great replacement. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!

Too much vinegar.  Grapes instead of raisins, and slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds make this recipe better.

I had two smaller crowns of broccoli, so I halved the ingredients and blanched the broccoli (as I always do when making broccoli salads). It was still too liquid-y for my tastes, but that can be remedied on the next batch. Subbed rice wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar and used pomegranate craisins, real bacon pieces, and unsalted sunflower seeds. I let it marinate for a couple hours in the fridge and practically made this my dinner tonight. Will attempt again by altering the dressing measurements.

This recipe is fantastic!!  I used stevia instead of sugar and it tasted great!  I also don't like raisins, especially when they get moist.  So, I used craisins instead and it was really tasty.  I doubled the recipe and thre was none left - signs of a great recipe :)

Love the sweet & sour taste of this salad.   I substitued craisins for the raisins.   I doubled the recipe to take to Thanksgiving dinner which worked out well.   A little wet for my liking so I may back off a little on the dressing next time.   I got lots of compliments!

My family enjoyed this version of eggplant parmesan
it's fairly easy to make.  Make sure to sweat the eggplant with some salt to take out excess moisture before frying.

Addictive! Recipe was perfect. I added chopped water chestnuts to the broccoli mixture so they had time to marinate. Also, reserved a little of the dressing and folded it in after adding bacon and sunflower seeds.

Delicious!  I tried this simply because  this recipe wasn't loaded with cheese (as most good broccoli salad recipes seem to be).  The cheese was not missed...very well received at family picnic. I followed other reviewers' suggestion and subbed in red grapes for raisins.

This is to die for! I only made a couple very minor changes.   Firstly, I didn't use quite as much bacon as it called for (I think 8 strips does the trick) and I used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds, but either would work for sure.  And since I am not a raw onion fan, I minced the red onion and only added about a tablespoon and a half.  I used golden raisins and for an extra treat I added a little shredded cheddar.   It was so divine!  I'll be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  My husband was apprehensive when I told him I was making broccoli salad.  He totally loved it!!  He has been having me make it every couple of days so that he can pack it in his lunch for the next day.

Really quick, easy and tasty. I didn't have any sunflower seeds, and I would have loved the additional crunch, but it was fine without them. A keeper. UPDATE: I have made this many more times and find I like it best when I blanch the broccoli, use red wine vinegar instead of white and add some sharp cheddar. If served to others, the recipe is usually requested.

Fantastic! I made this for our church's Fourth of July picnic and it was gone in no time--everyone wanted the recipe! I left out the onion and added only half of the sunflower seeds, and it still had plenty of flavor without one ingredient overpowering the other. The dressing is especially delicious!

Delicious broccoli salad. I didn't want it heavily dressed, so I used a little more broccoli than one head. Only 6 slices of bacon (4-5 would have been plenty). 3/4 C. lite mayo. 1 Tbsp. honey, 2 Tbsp. vinegar. Since I'm not a fan of raisins I used dried cranberries instead. WILL make again!

I have made this many times before and it is great!  Here are the changes I made to the recipe:
  Use 6 or less strips of bacon or none at all, use fresh squeezed lemon juice in place of the vinegar, and use chopped walnuts or pecans rather than sunflower seeds.

I love this recipe! As most other reviewers have said, use halved red grapes in place of raisins and use about double the amount called for. If you want leftovers, double the recipe. I get asked for the recipe every time I make this!

This is so good! Upped the amount of the red onion in the recipe according to my taste to 1/2 cup and it was really 'kicky' with that extra bit.
Instead of just garnishing the dish with sunflower seeds, added them into the salad. They did not get soggy at all.  Will be making this is double batches for summer picnics!

Love this salad.  Have eaten versions of it often, but this is the first time I made it. For swaps I used dried canberries in place of the raisins, and half the amount of bacon and sunflower seeds.  I was thinking the broccoli should be blanched ahead of time, but really that would have made everything soggy (glad i left it raw).  Cut the florets small, and make this at least four hours before serving.  The flavors will marry nicely.   Thanks for sharing the recipe.  DELISH!!

Fabulous!  Followed recipe to the letter, I made it the night before and only added the bacon and seeds as directed just before serving.  EVERYONE commented and I had NO leftovers.  I made a special dinner for my mother's 80th birthday, thank you all for your recipes the night was a total success!

This is the same recipe my husband has been making for years! We nix the sunflower seeds and raisins though - I personally don't think they would mix well in the salad together.

I used a little less mayo and sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This was delicious and very easy. It's also tasty with a little shredded cheddar mixed in, but it's definitely not necessary.

So yummy! I used crasins instead and I added more broccoli because there was to much dressing for me.

A favorite salad. I use red grapes instead of raisins and also added some shredded Swiss Cheese. The whole combination sounds weird, but it tastes really good!

really tasty. I cut way back on the mayo and used low cal/fat stuff to boot, used cranberries instead of raisins and less bacon and sunflower seeds. Was very good. Oh I also blanched the broccoli first..I love broccoli, but raw broccoli doesn't like me.

Awesome! (FYI - You may need more broccoli heads than listed.)  I make this recipe all of the time... any time a work function is being planned my co-workers come up and ask me to make this again. Then I always get asked for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect as is. Has the right sweetness and crunch of the best broccoli salads I have had at deli's. I made this for a Sunday family dinner and everybody loved it.

THIS is the recipe!  I followed the directions mostly... Using distilled white vinegar, golden raisins, shallot for my red onion and store bought cooked bacon (my deli cooks and packages theirs up).  Prep was a snap.  I didn't make the sauce separate, but mixed it up with the onion and raisins, added broccoli (next time I'm using 2 heads), stirred again and refrigerated -one bowl. Added the bacon and sunflower seeds just before dinner as directed in step 3.  It was really good.   HOWEVER, the next day... was the magic!   My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I'm no professional cook, but the taste of this salad made me look like a pro.  Didn't have sunflower seeds so I omitted and despite its absence, it was still delicious.  Didn't follow recipe to the T.  I cut back on mayo to cut down on cals. Still great nonetheless. Thanks

Okay this became such a hit last summer, I brought it to almost every bbq we went to! I follow the recipe almost to a "t" but like others, prefer halved red grapes to the raisins. Tastes much more fresh and summery. I try to make it early in the morning or the night before and just put the sunflower seeds and bacon in a baggie to bring with me and add right before serving. This definitely lets the flavors meld and broccoli keep its crunch but still soften a bit, and the added texture of the sunflower seeds and bacon is great. Wonderful recipe that I will be making for years to come!

Excellent.  I only change a couple things..my family doesn't like raisins so I added some shredded cheese instead (I've used both mozzarella and cheddar on separate occasions). Also, I used Balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I will definitely make this again and again.

I made this salad for an Easter grill out and it was fantastic! I only made a few minor tweaks, I used light Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, less fat &  cal, also I omitted the sugar all together b/c Miracle Whip is a little sweet anyway. Yum Yum Yum can't wait to make it again, it even gets better the next day.

This is a great recipe! We used to make this at a cafe as a daily special, and it sold out EVERY week! People would actually call a day ahead to reserve it. The only thing we did different is that we added shredded cheddar cheese and served it in a fresh baked pita. We tried it with grapes, and it was not well received (I agree, the raisins are better!) Makes a delicious, colorful salad.

Extremly good. However, I would reccomend more sugar to the White Wine Vinigar. It's way too Vinigary. Also, I would recommend White Raisons. Amazing! So, about 2 1/2 cup sugar, or even 3 cups. That's what I did and it's so good! Thank you(: Hope you try it, my way xD

Wish i discovered broccoli salad sooner! I added double the broccoli and still thought there was too much sauce. I guess most broccoli salads have a lot of sauce and I'm just different. Very delicious though!

Served this as part of a boxing day buffet and we all loved it.  Did make some minor changes, used red grapes (thanks discobunny!) omitted the onion as my daughterwon't touch onions and didn't use the seeds.   will make again, thanks for the recipe.

Excellent salad!  I love that you can change the ingredients to your liking.  I used slightly less dressing, sunflower seeds and have used both yellow raisins and dried cranberries depending on what was on hand and my mood.  Delish.

This broccoli salad was fantastic.  I made it for a Super Bowl party and fixed it the day before.  The salad was excellent and I got rave reviews.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to use low fat mayo and I added 1/2 a tsp more sugar as I like my broccoli salad sweeter.  It was excellent and I will fix again.

Wow -- this is REALLY GOOD!!!  I used walnuts instead of sesame seeds and a craisin/black and white raisin mix -- what's great is that this recipe is open to change and it still tastes wonderful.  This was a great addition to Thanksgiving dinner!

This was soooo good. I took it to the beach and everyone loved it. I used red grapes instead of raisins and remember to add the seeds and bacon right before you serve or it will get soggy.

BRILLIANT salad.  Now my fave way to eat broccoli.  I added slivered almonds, and lightly toasted them and the sesame seeds before adding.  Vegetarians can leave out the bacon and still have a beautiful salad.  This'll now be one of the dishes I make regularly not only at home but for potlucks and BBQs.

This is a must try. I have never had so many people ask me for a recipe! Only thing I did different was to put the chopped onion in cold water for 5-10 min so the onion wasn't to strong.

This was delicious! I subbed the white wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar and I omitted the bacon because I don't eat meat. Everything else was such a great combination. Who would've thought broccoli, raisins and sunflower seeds would add texture and taste to a broccoli salad. I bet it tastes even better using the white wine vinegar. I love how fast, easy and tasteful this recipe is. Thanks for posting.

Very tasty dish. I have to admit, it didn't sound like it would be very good, but it really is! I made it per the recipe, just substituting Splenda for sugar and using low fat mayo. It sure seemed like A LOT of sunflower seeds but I put them all in anyway and glad I did, as they added a nice crunch. I used golden raisins and some craisins. Very good and easy to prepare ahead.

Holy.MOLY! This is so so so yummy. I could probably eat it all day long. Huge fan. I think that will become my 'go-to' dish for potlucks and parties. It was so tasty, so easy, and definitely a nice change from the regular party/potluck favorites. It was so good-- I'm craving it now!  I followed one of the reviewer's advice and used fresh grapes instead of raisins. Glad that I did--- the grapes added a nice, fresh, juicy crunch.

My entire family loves this.  Ive made it several times just as the recipe is written and varied it a couple of times as well by adding just a handful of shredded old cheddar, grapes instead of raisins and almonds as well as the sunflower seeds.  I always make a double batch and we never have leftovers!

I'm not only impressed with this salad, I'm impressed with the great reviews it got!  Congratulations to JJohn32! I've also done a similar salad in the past that includes peanut butter!  Terrific as well!  And a real surprise to anyone who eats it for the first time!

This is so good, I've made it without the raisins, bacon, and sunflower seeds - just broccoli and onions and the dressing.  Honestly, I don't think toasting the sunflower seeds adds any flavor, just a little time to the prep, so I don't do that any more.

I read what a hit this salad was, but I was shocked at how fast it went! I cheated.  I used precooked bacon bits (in a bag in the salad dressing section of the store).  Didn't toast the sunflower seeds, either.  I added a handful of shredded cheese for color.  Mixed it all up the night before...YUMMY!  Will make again...and again...and again!!!!

Good broccoli salad, though a little sweet. I'll make this again, only omitting the sugar. I didn't have raisins but I did have craisins so I used that. The cranberries gave it just enough sweetness that the added sugar was unnecessary. I served this with Ruby Drive sloppy joes and cajun-spiced tater tots.

Yummy! I did not use the raisins or the sunflower seeds. I was skeptical of using the mayo thought maybe I should use ranch, but went ahead and followed the recipe and was happy that I did. Very good will make again. Thank you

I have been cooking from this website for several years and this is the first review I have done.  I went to a local restaurant for lunch and they had broccoli salad and I wanted to make this for my family for dinner and this is the recipe I used. my family told me that this is totally a remake.  We really enjoyed your recipe and thank you for posting.  The only thing we did different was we used currant instead of raisins.

Great recipe!  The flavors worked together very well and the longer it set together, the better it got!  I did leave out the raisins, which was just a personal preference.  Will definitely make again!

YUM!!!  There were a number of us that could not stop eating it!  I cooked my bacon in the microwave between two paper towels until crisp.  I also used red wine vinegar, because that's what I had.  I do think I could have used a bigger head of broccoli though as the sauce was pretty thick and could have spread a bit more.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  **Next time I also think I'll try baking the bacon.  My best friend does it all the time and says it's so easy for clean-up and your house smells way less.  Line a baking sheet with foil and bake at 425, flipping once, until desired crispness...10-15 minutes or so.  I'll also add some shredded cheddar and black pepper.

If you don't care about fat grams, this is a fantastic dish. I used low fat mayo and halved green grapes in place of the raisins. Used red wine vinigar as that is what i had on hand. Absolutely delicious! (just don't read the nutritional information and tell yourself that your eating brocolli so it must be good for you)!

Yum, yum, yum!  I used craisins b/c that is all I had on hand, and it turned out great.  I think letting it sit overnight really helps too.  My guests loved it!

This was really good, I substituted red seedless grapes (as suggested by viewers) for the raisens and I used pine nuts and grated carrots. I took it to a picnic and one person told me that she was skeptical at first to try this, because of the presentation, but, she told me that it was so good. Thanks so much for this recipe, I will use it repeatedly.

I got HUGE compliments on this dish. I originally got this recipe from a local grocery store and loved the samples.  I put in only 3 strips of bacon (turkey bacon worked just fine for those who don't eat pork).  I used toasted sunflower seeds with salt.  And for fun i added chopped almonds.  I found out that it is important to at least let the whole thing sit for half an hour minimum so that the vinegar isn't overwhelming.  Loved it!!

This was awesome!  Served this last night at a cookout and it was the perfect side dish.  I only used 3/4 cup low fat mayo, and instead of raisins used red seedless grapes (halved).  Everyone LOVED it!

I'd had this type of salad at pot-lucks but never made it myself.  I had a craving, so went looking for a recipe.  This is exactly what I wanted.  I used light mayo and precooked bacon crumbles.

This is SUPER good! And I don't usually like raw broccoli too much. I think it's best if you leave it overnight, but I've made it day of, a few hours early as written, and it's always good. I always use reduced fat mayo cause otherwise it negates the healthy-ness of the broccoli. This is a staple of my bbqs in the summer. Also, super easy to bring to gatherings, just put bacon and SF seeds in a small container or ziploc and toss in just before serving. LOVE this salad! THANKS ALYSON!!!

My family loves this salad. We make it for special occasions and it's gobbled up. I like using the red onion so that it is visible and easy to pick out. I like the flavor it gives the salad but onion hurts my tummy. Definately use real bacon; it's what makes the salad. I sometimes substitute craisins for the raisins (I prefer the craisins...depends on what I have in the house). I'm planning to make this again for our Christmas dinner this year.

I didn't think this combination of ingredients would taste good, but I was sure wrong. It was delicious and I got lots of compliments on this salad. A great way to incorporate broccoli into your meals.

This was AWESOME! Used 1 head fresh broccoli, boiled 1 min then rinsed in cold water. Let salad sit overnight leaving out 1/2 of bacon and sunflower seeds till ready to server. I did sunstitute halved grapes instead of raisens - other than that followed to a tee and it was delicious!!!

I have to triple this recipe when I take it to my daughter's youth group! EVERYONE loves it. I think the next small batch I make I'm going to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins, for a little more tang. I let you know if it works.

Reminds me of Ruby Tuesday's recipe. Yum. I used precooked bacon for ease and I only had apple cider vinegar when I made it. Still amazingly great recipe. It's a keeper!

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly as is.  I wasn't sure whether to use roasted salted sunflower seeds or unsalted, which I could not find.  I ended up buying raw shelled sunflower seeds and toasting them myself in the oven, and they were fabulous in the salad! 

Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Well I completely changed this recipe because I'm on a diet, but it was an awesome recipe for me to use as a go-by. One day when I'm done dieting I'll try the original because I'm sure it's way better! In case anyone's curious, the substitutions I used were turkey bacon, craisins, Splenda, and organic low-fat plain yogurt (in place of the mayo). I left in the broccoli, red onion, and vinegar and I skipped the sunflower seeds. Not bad at all and saved much fat and calories. Can't wait until I can try the real thing!

This is a great salad! I often make it for BBQs.  I've altered it slightly by using Apple Cidar vinegar instead of white wine.  A great short cut for the bacon is to use pre-packaged low sodium real bacon pieces.

Very tasty. I leave out the onions because the kids aren't much of a fan of those. I also add 1/4 C of cheddar cheese.

I skip the bacon and keep it vegetarian!  I have made this every summer for picnics and have served with and without bacon - but actually prefer it without.  I have substituted low fat mayo as well and it tastes just as good and of course is much lower in fat this way.

I really liked this. I only had green onions so used that instead of red onion. I may have used a little extra vinegar because I don't like to taste the mayo and thought the amount of sugar was just right. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful salad! I have made this recipe 3 times now but can't seem to get any leftovers out of it. My husband took that as a "dish to pass" to his office luncheon and still has people stopping by his desk asking for the recipe. It is very good! I left off the raisins and sunflower seeds.

Very Good!  I did change a couple of things.  I used 3 medium heads of broccoli and still had tons of dressing, too much in my opinion.  I used craisins instead of raisins.  Very tasty though.  I liked the white wine vinegar in there instead of plain vinegar.

Served this at a potluck and I wasn't able to have any because it was gone so quickly! I did use grapes instead of raisins as an earlier reviewer suggested, and omitted the sunflower seeds to adjust to a younger (preschool age) crowd. Also substituted miracle whip for the mayo and it turned out great- I did get to taste it before I brought it to the potluck. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

This turned out great!  In the past, I made a similar salad except used the red wine vinegar... but... I definitely think that the white wine vinegar is much better.  I mixed in broccoli, craisins, red onion, and the mayo mixture the night before... and then added the bacon this morning... I skipped the sunflower seeds, but didn't miss it.  The salad was great!!

this is a great party salad because it's very colorful. We made it at Thanksgiving (made it the night before and added the bacon at the last minute). We used Craisins instead of raising. yum.

I made this for Thanksgiving hoping it would be a nice cold vegetable dish to contrast all the hot dishes.  Let me tell you it was gone in a second!  Definately a new staple recipe.

I make this exactly as written and we love it! I don't like raisins, but my husband doesn't allow me to make this without them, so I just eat around them. Definiely a keeper!

For a lower in calorie version, substitute turkey bacon for bacon, splenda for sugar and lowfat mayo.  I also used cranberries instead of raisins and added a can of mandarin oranges.

Stating the amount of broccoli in cups of bite-size florets would be helpful.  (This is true of all recipes from any source.)  I purchased three 'crowns', one MUCH smaller than the other two, and used one regular-sized and also the small one.  I remember when this type of salad first came out and was very popular...this wasn't quite what I expected/remembered.  Will keep looking.  Maybe I just had too much dressing.  Not sure; can't put my finger on exactly what I didn't like, but will try others.

What a great salad, and incredibly fullfilling!  I actually made this as a side salad for our Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out marvelous!  I made the dressing the night before and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  Then I mixed the entire salad about 4 hours before serving.  I also did what a reviewer recommended and took out the raisins and sunflower seeds, and instead added  2 cups of halved red grapes and a cup of almonds.  There was quite a bit of dressing, so I ended up using only about half of what the recipe calls for.  Fantastic!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful salad!  A perfect blend of Salty, sweet, and crunchy.  I do not like my brocolli soft so I make my salad just a few hours ahead of time instead of the night before; just enough time to chill the ingredients and soften the raisins. Right before serving I add the bacon and sunflower seeds.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it. I was so excited to find this recipe because his grandma makes this for him when we have family get togethers and he always says that noone can make it like her and I finally did!! He thought I had called his grandma and got the recipe! I did use red wine vinegar because that was all that I had but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was great!

This is one of my favorite potluck sides. Can be altered for vegetarian or vegan diets by omitting bacon and using soy bacon & mayo.

This was a great recipe.  Since we made it for a family function, I did minus the raisons since some don't like.  I also didn't have any white wine vinegar so subbed Raspberry Blush vinegar, cut back the sugar and put the dressing in a dressing bottle and kept in fridge so the guest could add their own dressing. We also used roasted pine nuts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good salad.  My only change would be next time I will put equal amounts of sugar/vinegar.  The vinegar was overpowering.  Way too much dressing but I added it a little at a time so it was fine.

AWESOME.  I made this for work and made two versions. One following the directions exactly, except that I used one pouch of maple flavored bacon bits, and I made one healthy, vegetarian version.  For the veggie version I used low fat mayo,  morning star soy bacon (microwaved then crumbled), and 1/2 the sunflower seeds.  Although the original version is perfect, the healthy veggie version was a close second.   Either way, this salad Rocks.

For the veggie version I used low fat mayo,  morning star soy bacon (microwaved then crumbled), and 1/2 the sunflower seeds.  Although the original version is perfect, the healthy veggie version was a close second.   Either way, this salad Rocks.

I just made this and it was awesome. I added a few extra slices of bacon as I just wanted to have a lil' extra. I loved the red onions and sunflower seeds in this recipe. Everyone raved about this and went back for 2nds and 3rd helpings...Can't wait to make this again.

Excellent.  I had no sunflower seeds and was too lazy to stop at the store to buy some, but it was soooo good.  It was the first dish gone at our work potluck this morning!

Lordy, did I ever change this recipe... I omitted the bacon (didn't have any) although I used some fake bacon bits at the end, I used frozen broccoli (thawed) and white onion plus a couple green onions, I used Craisins instead of raisins, I used cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar, and I cut the amount of sugar down to about half (I made a half-batch, so I only used maybe 1½ tsp). I added some peanuts to my serving, and it was actually really good! I know I totally changed things but I wanted to use what I had on hand. And I was really surprised that it turned out as tasty as it did. Thanks, Eleanor, I imagine it's even more wonderful if you follow the recipe to a 'T'!

I only made a small portion because I thought my husband would refuse to eat it, but he loved it! We are both very excited about adding this side dish into my cooking repetoire! I would recommend adding the dressing mixture little by little, tossing the salad, then tasting it to prevent dressing overload. The first time I made it, I skipped the step of chilling it in the fridge first, but it still tasted great!

Excellent Recipe!  I'm incredibly picky about vegetables, and I love this.  I have made this twice already and both times were a huge success.  My fickle grandmother is still talking about it and I made it for her over three months ago. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good.  I'm usually not a big fan of raisins, but I didn't mind themat all in this.  I was surprised the raves I got from this because it was so simple.  My mother-in -law said that she was going to have me make the broccoli salad from now on.  (High praise indeed)

Awesome!! This recipe is delicious. I made it a couple times when I had people over and I never have leftovers. Even people who don't really care for broccoli or raisins somehow still love this salad. I've looked for quite some time for a recipe for this salad and this is definitely a keeper. Thanks!!

Very Yummy! To make it a little less fat and more healthy, instead of they mayo I used 1/4 cup low fat mayo and 3/4 cup non fat plain yogurt. I also used low ready-to-use bacon.

Very good.

My favorite recipe.  I use dried cranberries instead of raisins and add a pkg or tortolini pasta (I still use the same quantity or dressing) and it is an entire meal in itself.  Great combination of flavours.  I like it as soon as it is mixed slightly warm but tastes great after refridgerated too.

Absolutely delicious! Instead of fresh fried bacon I used packaged already cooked "real" bacon. When I told my bf I was making this he snubbed his nose but then once on the table he tasted it; he ate almost half the bowl.

Easy to make--always a hit--used rice vinegar and dried craqnberries instead of raisins--I have also used bottled poppyseed dressing instead of making the mayo sauce---that also turned out great :)

Very easy and tasty.  I hate cooking bacon so I decided to be lazy and use precooked bacon bits.  It worked well.

Quite Good.  The dressing turned out a bit runny for me.  I've tried better broccoli salads though.

I left out the raisins and didn't have any sunflower seeds. Used only 1 tbsp. sugar and 3/4 cup mayo. So, I guess at this point, the recipe was altered so much, I shouldn't be commenting but.....I loved it! Thanks!

This was so good!  I'm not wild about broccoli cooked unless it's lathered in cheese sauce so I don't know why I tried it raw but WOW this was so different. I made 1/2 the recipe and ate the whole thing in 2 days. Also added some dried cranberries and I'm sure it would be just as good with or without the bacon. Give this one a try.  Thanks Eleanor.

Love this easy recipe that is so good. Great for get-togethers. Since I'm from Fresno, I have to add the raisins. I use golden raisins and sometimes substitute pecans for the sunflower seeds. I will also try substituting Splenda for the sugar next time I make it.

This is a very good salad with a unique taste.  I omitted the raisins because I'm not a big fan and I don't think the taste was affected.  A great alternative to the usual broccoli salad.

I made this recipe for and all-girls get together and for our 2003 Thanksgiving dinner with 24 guests and the people at both parties LOVED this broccoli salad . . . even better was that the people who don't like broccoli (like my hubby) even liked it and went back for seconds!  This is a keeper.  

I made a couple of changes to the recipe -- I used Splenda instead of white sugar and I used regular distilled vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  I also omitted the sunflower seeds, and on Thanksgiving I didn't have time to cook bacon but noone seemed to notice.

Try using bacon bits from a jar or bag and omit the raisins.  It's just as good and faster to make.

This was tasty, but I made it side-by-side with "Bodacious Broccoli Salad" (here on Allrecipes) and liked that one better.  It has less mayo and adds a bit of lemon juice and some salt (too much, actually, but you'll have to look at that review) which make a difference.  I didn't like the seeds in it very much, the crunch of those doesn't seem to mesh with the crunch of the broccoli.  Anyway, I would make this again, but FWIW, I like the other one a little bit better.  Just a little, like a quarter of a star better!  :)

This is the very best!  I added sliced almonds and sliced green grapes and everyone raved about it.

We have loved this salad for years, but my recipe has a few differences.  I use apple cider vinegar, 1/4 c sugar, and toasted almonds (in the place of sunflower seeds).  It's great!

This recipe was fabulous!  I made it for a picnic at the lake, and everyone loved it.  Even my three year old son!  Using the aleady cooked, microwave bacon really sped things up.  Thanks Alyson!

Great! We enjoyed the mix of different flavors. Husband said it was a great way to each broccoli.  He loved the crunchiness, sweetness, saltiness etc.

There's no time for this salad to get soggy.  At my house it's usually inhaled in no time.  I like to use golden raisins and one pound of bacon. No counting calories!

I used low-fat, low-calorie mayo and no-calorie sweetener instead of sugar, and this recipe was still fabulous!  I didn't have any sunflower seeds on hand, but the recipe did not suffer without them.  I wouldn't have eaten this as a kid, but now that I love broccoli, it was wonderful!

Using freshly cooked bacon makes a much better salad than the bacon bits from a jar.  I also usually double the broccoli or add some chopped lettuce - made exactly as the recipe says is too heavy on the dressing for my taste.  This is always a hit at potlucks and parties.

I do think there should be more broccoli and less of the other ingredients in the ratio to enjoy it more.  It was hard to find the broccoli compared to raisins and sunflower seeds.  Otherwise, this is a great salad: easy, able to be prepared ahead of time and TASTY!!

Wow!  Super-Yummy.  I made it with soy-mayonnaise and I used red wine vinegar and left out the sunflower seeds.

It was very good.  The actual recipe doesn't make too much and I would at least double it for a potluck.  It will go fast!

This recipe has been a huge favorite at church gatherings.  Some people are skeptical of the raisins if they don't like them but end up loving it.  Even my daughters request this recipe.
