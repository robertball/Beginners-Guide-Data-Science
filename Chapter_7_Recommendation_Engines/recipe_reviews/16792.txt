I read the other reviews and decided to used 2 cups of uncooked INSTANT rice instead of raw white rice, reducing the chicken broth to 1 (16oz) can and adding 1 can of cream of celery soup (undiluted). I baked it for 45 minutes covered and let it stand 10 minutes, still covered, before serving. The rice was creamy and the chicken tender. Very tasty and extremely quick and easy to make.

This was the worst recipe I have ever attempted.  The cooking time was unbelievalbe.  It took two hours for the rice to cook at the temperature designated.  I would never try this again nor recommend it to a friend.  Whoever submitted this definitely needs cooking lessons.

Okay after reading the reviews i was kind of skeptical but one of the reviews i read talked about instant rice. So i altered the recipe alittle. I used 2 cans of chicken broth and i measured the instant rice with the chicken broth can. I used 1 1/2 Cans instant rice. Then i cooked it at 375 for 45 mins covered and let it sit for 10 mins covered. I loved it and my husband loves it and he is a very picky eater. The rice was perfect and the chicken was moist and great! I would recommend this recipe to everyone, with the changes made. Happy Cooking!

I loved the chiken but there was way to much rice for the recipe. I cut it down to 5 cups and still the rice did not cook all the way. The ratio for rice to water (according to Riceland) is 1 cup rice to 2 cups water. I used the cups becuase I had the big containers of Chiken broth instead of cans. I would try it again but with new measures.

This recipe must be wrong be cause the rice is to much and is taking to long to cook. TRY a 5 1/2 of cooked rice is what I say ,because uncooked rice didn't work.

I read the other reviews and didn't make as much rice.  I used about a cup and a half rice with 3 cups of chicken broth.  The rice came out very good and there was enough for my family of 3 with a little left over.  My husband really liked it, but my mother is unfamiliar with lemon pepper and wasn't thrilled about it.  I liked it, but didn't love it.  Will I make it again?  Probably.

I thought this was easy to make, but the chicken was a little dry, and there was too much paprika. Maybe switch the measurements for the lemon pepper and the paprika?  I don't think I would prepare this according to these instructions again.

This is a nice basic recipe, but a little bland. The 2nd time I used this recipe I made some changes. I added frozen peas to the rice mixture, and basted the chicken with a mixture of 3 tbsp olive oi, 1/2 tsp lemon flavor, 1/4 tsp garlic and onion powder, a pinch of cayenne, then broiled seperately till almost done, about 15 minutes. I put the chicken on top of rice mixture to finish cooking and flavor rice a little more when most of the liquid was gone. The chicken didn't dry out and the rice didn't turn to mush. Still made a quick and simple tasty dinner.

Rice didn't cook under the chicken. Chicken was tender and good but the rice was bland and hard.

The chicken was moist, however the rice turned out too mushy. It did however, have a good flavor especially if you like lemon.  I also added some fresh squeezed lemon juice as well.

Super easy dish but we thought the chicken was dry and the rice was mushy. Very blah taste.  Definately won't make again.

After reading reviews I was concerned, what I did was reduce broth by (1) can and kicked the temp to 425f for 60 minutes and turned out great... also you must pre-heat, give time for oven to get to temp !

I didn't have lemon pepper on hand so I substituted Montreal chicken seasoning and it came out great - I still used the paprika.  I would probably also decrease the amount of rice - I used brown instead of white, if only because it boiled over and left me a mess in the oven.  Otherwise, it was very good and I will be making it again.  I'll even try it with the lemon pepper.

This came out awful... very little flavor, the rice was dry and chalky. It also does NOT fit in a two-qt. casserole, so I had to dirty two pans just to make this and then no one ate it.

I made this dish three or four times and my wife and I thoroughly enjoy it. I particularly like the rice cooked this way. I don't understand the significant number of reviewers who seem to dislike this recipe. My only problem with this recipe is that if I make the whole recipe as written I do not have a casserole dish big enough to hold it. Made it last night with half the rice and one large chicken breast and it was perfect for the two of us.

I do love the recipe but will be adding to it next time.  I was nervous after reading reviews but I see the alteration worked.  I had to use a 3 QT casserole instead of 2 QT and would decrease the water a little because the rice was a little mushy and slightly bland so would increase seasonings but the chicken was tender and moist.

A 2 qt dish does not hold this recipe. The chicken stayed moist but it took extra time and a higher cooking temp to get it to the correct temp.  Not a great recipe.
