I LOVE wrap sandwiches because they're easy to put together and they taste great! Plus, it's like a meal all "rolled" together. I loved the concept, but changed this up a little. I seasoned a couple of chicken breasts with "Taco Seasoning II" from this site and grilled them. I also grilled the red pepper along with a vidalia onion. I used some homemade salsa I had on hand, sorry Pace...  And I added some shredded cheddar cheese. I left the sour cream on the side for dipping along with some extra salsa. These made for a really nice lunch! My husband and I enjoyed these and would definitely make them again.

Fantastic!  I made a few changes I seasoned the chicken with Cajun seasoning.  And grilled them.  I also cut the sour cream because I'm not a big fan.  I added about 1/2 a cup of not fat plain yogurt to the mix before rolling it in a tortilla.  Great recipe.

good flavor and easy, but really runny as stated - too much liquid in the salsa.

I made the following changes:  Sauteed the chicken in a skillet with a small amount of olive oil, then added 1/2 cup of the salsa verde, and two red peppers that I'd roasted and cut into strips. Instead of making wraps, I made a bed of lettuce and spooned the chicken/roasted red pepper filling on that, then surrounded it with some white corn tortilla chips. I squeezed the juice of a lime on the avocado, and used non-fat sour cream for the "dressing". I also sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese (grated) on each salad. It was a delicious and light meal. Thank you for the inspiration!

I did not use sour cream, and I added cheese. I grilled them in a pan to melt the cheese a bit. They were good, and pretty easy to make. I would probablly make again. I'm giving it three stars because I liked them, I didn't love them. It's always good to have options though so thank you for sharing the recipe.

I made these as a quick dinner one night and they were delicious! I didn't have salsa verde so I used pace salsa instead and they were still wonderful. The only thing I will do differently next time is use less avocado - my husband and I both enjoy the flavor, however it was a little overwhelming in this recipe... Thus the 4 star rating. Will be making this again for sure though!

I had Mexican cheese that added to it.  I made my own salsa verde and it was plenty thick.  It was not runny for me
