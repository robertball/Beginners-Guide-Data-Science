This is a really delicious salad that I served as a side dish at a picnic. I did make several changes as follows:
-Taco seasoning with the ground beef (following the directions on the seasoning package). 
-Romaine lettuce.
-1 bunch (~6) green onions.
-I diced about 1 1/2 cups (12 oz) of a block Cheddar and Monteray mixed cheese, and that was all of the cheese I used.
-I mixed Ranch and Salsa together for the dressing. 2oz. Ranch and 6oz Salsa to make the 8 oz the recipe calls for, or to your own taste.  
-I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans.

This is great.  I made a couple of changes, added taco seasoning mix to my meat and used ranch rather than Thousand Island dressing.

I have debated whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars. I rounded up from a 4.5. I did make a couple of changes. First of all, I sauteed the ground beef with the onion and a little taco seasoning. I then not only drained, but rinsed the beans (less gas producing this way). I added chopped green onions to the mixture and I really love it best with Catalina dressing and not 1000 Island. I play with the cheeses sometimes and use a Mexican blend. Very important to follow the directions and not add chips and dressing until right at time of serving. By the way, I just purchase the bags of shredded lettuce. Thank you.

This recipe is really good and has been a favorite at many a cookout.  The only modification I made was to season the ground beef with a package of taco seasoning.  It really gives it a nice "taco" flavor.

This is what we make with our left over taco meat...and it's delicious.  I used French dressing and Mexican blend cheese.  I also topped it off with chopped avacado and red onion.  Thanks Sara.

Tasty salad, Sara. I cut cheeses to 2/3cup each and set out guacamole, sour cream and sliced black olives for garnishing the individual servings.For a slightly tangier version try dressing the salad with Caesar dressing to which you add 1/2 envelope of Taco Seasoning and 1T cumin. Yummy variation. Thanks for your version Sara!

I agree with the other reviewers - the meat needs a packet of taco seasoning.  I usually don't eat Thousand Island dressing, but I thought I would try it in this recipe and I actually like it.  I only used one can of beans and felt it was the perfect amount.  I used I bunch of green onions (including tops) and a quarter of a red onion.  I also added a couple of TBSP of chopped cilantro.  Excellent.

Unless you want to feed an army, I strongly suggest cutting this recipe in half- all except the dressing. I can't imagine only using 8oz for this massive amount. However, it is very tasty- make sure your lettuce is dry before adding. I also cooked the onion with the meat & added some seasoned salt.

A very good salad.  I added taco seasoning to the hamburger as others suggested.  I only had cheddar cheese, and that was fine.  I will make this again.

This is the Taco Salad recipe I grew up on. I love it with the 1000 isle and Fritos. I brown the meat and then add the kidney beans. Hubby likes it with Catalina dressing and Tortilla chips, so I leave the meat separate and then we mix our own.

Great taste, look and got rave reviews. Gave it 4 stars because it makes a ton and doesent keep well, we ended up dumping the leftovers a day later...I will make again and not put the dressing on the entire portion, so that it will be good for longer.

I did not care for the sweetness of the thousand island dressing.  And didn't taste like mexican.  Like my old standard taco salad better with taco sauce in the meat and green goddess dressing and doritos instead of corn chips.

This recipe is very similar to an old family favorite.  We season the meat with taco seasoning, and we put the cornchips on our plates then pile the salad on top.  We also like to crush the corn chips in our hands before putting them on the plate and sometimes we serve the dressing on the side so that leftovers won't be soggy.  We also prefer to make our own thousand island dressing by mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.  Yum!

I really like this salad. Sometimes I make it without meat. It's good with sliced hard boiled egg added too. The Thousand Island dressing is key to the flavor in my opinion. My only advice would be that this makes a LOT so if you don't think you can eat it all immediately, don't add the corn chips to the whole bowl, they get soggy.

I served this at our 4th of July party, and all of our guests loved it. It's such a simple recipe, who would have thought it would be the talk of the side dishes? I did add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat mixture,and aggree that 8 oz of Thousand Island dressing is not near enough for our taste. I also used a blend of shredded mexican cheese instead of the cubed it called for. This is definately a recipe to take to a pot luck, as it makes a mountain of salad. You could cut the portions to serve a family though.

This recipe was a huge hit at our Memorial Day picnic.  I did add a little fajita seasoning to the meat while I browned it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good starting point. I made it lower in fat and calories by using ground turkey and used a batch and a half of Bill Echols taco seasoning. I garnished it with FF sour cream and served it with additional toppings. I used chili cheese Fritos.

We made this and it was great.  We did do two things differently though.  We seasoned the meat with Taco seasoning and just served the salad dressing on the side.  That way everyone could put in as much as they wanted.

This had to be the worst recipe I have ever tried on here. What a horrible waste of ingredients. Someone on here said that it looked terrible but tasted great. I will agree that it was very unappealing to look at but it was also unappealing....to the taste. No one in my family liked it at all. Sorry Sara but this one is not a winner.

So basically after reading the reviews and trying this myself, you MUST add seasoning to the meat and change the dressing - I use either plain yogurt or low/no fat sour cream.  The wonderful smell drives my  co-workers crazy when I bring in the left overs!!!

Iused a bottle of ranch dressing mixed with 8oz of salsa for the dressing. I also added the lettuce right before serving which helped to prevent it from getting soggy & wilted.

This was a really good cold salad for a hot summer day. The only thing I did different was to add some adobo seasoning to the meat and mixed the meat, onions, beans, cheese, and dressing and served over the chips and lettuce. I knew we were going to have leftovers and I did not want the chips and lettuce to get soggy. Worked like a charm and had the leftovers for lunch today!!

This was pretty good, but needed some salsa. I didn't care for the thousand island dressing (and I love 1000 ISL) but it just didn't go very well by itself. I added some salsa and it made all the difference in the world! The meat was bland on it's own and I really think adding green pepper and a bit or garlic in with the meat would help trememdously. I cooked the onion with the meat. I love the idea and this made a huge amount so it's great for a party and can be made up a little ahead. The lettuce got a little soggy and limp though after a couple of hours. That was without the dressing and I had drained the beans really well. Great idea, needs a little work, but a good base. Thanks!

This recipe is fabulous!  The flavor and everything about it!  It doesn't taste like a Mexican dish though.  My husband put Ortega Taco Sauce on his and loved it.  We didn't put the chips and dressing into the salad.  I knew we'd need to use leftovers and didn't want it soggy.  We just added the chips and dressing when we ate it!  Great salad!

The entire family liked this recipe, including grandma and our three-year-old.  The only suggestions I would have are:  1)  Plan to feed a large group, because the salad just isn't the same the next day, and 2) I would reduce the amount of salad dressing and the amount of corn chips, because it was a little too "wet" and slightly salty for our tastes... But definitely one that we will make again - great idea!

This dish was super...I would highly recommend it.  I make a similar dish that I call Taco Salad, using Taco-Flavored Doritos (if you can find them, if not, a spicy Dorito substitute) and Wishbone Deluxe French Dressing.  They are both excellent.

I had this salad at a Labor Day picnic this year and it was GRRRRREAT! The one I had was made with Doritos, everyone was raving about it.  I'm so happy to see the recipe because I want to try it at home.  Thanks!

Everyone in my family loves this recipe! I've made it with various substitutions, such as Doritos for the corn chips and Country French (Marzettis brand) for the Thousand Island dressing. Also, as other reviewers suggested, spicing the meat up a little with cumin, chili powder, or just some taco seasoning adds a little punch to the finished product. All in all, a fantastic salad. Thanks, Sara!

This is a recipe I had in the '70's and had lost.
We always used Fritos chips, and no extra taco seasoning just salt and pepper in the ground beef. It's a different taste than all the taco salads we eat now, but it's very good when made exactly as the recipe reads! If one wanted more dressing you could easily add more, but Thousand Island is what makes it unique.

I really love this recipe.  My Mom has been making this salad for the past 30yrs.  The differences are: she adds taco seasoning to the meat, omit's the tomatoes and dressing and adds a picante salsa to it.  A real hit with the kids because of the chips.  Same concept as a one pan meal.

I have to admit that I prefer my usual Taco Salad recipe, I found the Thousand Island dressing bland, and the salad didn't have enough of a spicy punch.

I used French Dressing instead of 1000 Island since I don't care for that much.  Very simple recipe, and one I think I'll make frequently in the summer.  Also, I didn't do the whole chilling in the fridge for an hour either.  We enjoyed it warm. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

A big winner!!  I doubled the recipe for a family party and everyone loved it.  I served it with Doritos and Fritos so people could choose whether or not to add the chips.  Serve guacamole, salsa, etc. as toppings if desired.

I made this to enjoy while we watched the football game and we had 'win-win'. The Gophers won over Northwestern and this recipe won rave reviews! This is nicely suited to adjust ingredients to personal taste. Like another reviewer, I added taco seasoning to the meat, cut the kidney beans in half, used half of the chips and used shredded cheese. I used a gourmet favorite thousand island dressing and I think that was key to the success. I heard: "When can we have this again?"

I have been making this for a while, with the follwoing changes: no onion, add 1/2 c salsa while browning the meat, plus a little taco seasoning (1-2 t), a small can sliced black olives, and catalina dressing.  Yes, it makes a lot.  No, it doesn't keep.  But this is one salad I prefer to toss with dressing and use or lose, it just tastes better that way!

This recipe is wonderful with these variations:
add taco seasoning to the ground beef, substitute nacho flavored doritos for plain corn chips and use ranch style beans instead of kidney. I also add a small can of sliced blk olives. Perfect. This is also makes for great cold leftovers. Enjoy.:)

THIS IS A VERY DELICIOUS SALADI LOVE IT. BUT INSTEAD OF USING TACO SEASONING, YOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN INGREDIENTS TO MAKE IT  TASTE EVEN BETTER.FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER THE MEAT IS BROWNED, I ADD 1 T. GARLIC POWDER, 1 TSP.GROUND  CUMIN, 1 TSP. DRIED OREGANO, AND 2TSP. DRIED PARSLEY, PLUS 1 T CHILI POWDERED. MIX WELL WITH BROWNED MEAT, AND ADD 3/4 CUP, CHICKIN BROTH OR WATER, COOK, FOR ABOUT 2 T 4 MINS LOW HEAT, AND YOU SEE HOW MUCH BETTER THE TASTE. THESE HERBS CAN BE USED TO SEASON YOUR BEEF FOR TACOS, ETC; AISO PINTO BEANS NOT KIDNEY,KIDNEY BEANS SKIN IS THICKER& TUFF.

This recipe resembles a famliy favorite. Been in my family for about 25 yrs. We layer Frito's, beans, meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoe, onion and more frito's and cheese, bake at 350 for 20 mins, till cheese is melted. And its great with Catalina dressing or salsa. Never tried Thousand Island. Just an idea for you all! This can be made in about 30mins total.

This is very good.  It reminds me of the one that my grandmother used to make for church gathering.  I have to admit that hers is a little better but it may be the grandmotherly touch that has this recipe beat.

This was pretty good.  I used black beans and different dressing, I also used 97% lean ground beef.  I used a bagged salad to make this easier.  Added a can of sliced olives and some chopped yellow peppers.

This is an often requested dish in my family. I make it a little different. I don't put the beans in (never actually thought of that!), I mix a packet of Taco Seasoning with the Thousand Island Dressing in a bowl first then add it to the salad. I also use Nacho Cheese Doritos crushed up and added just before serving. My 21 year old nephew requests this every single time we have a family gathering. Another family friend asked me to make it for his wedding reception!

Easy make ahead meal for a busy mom with lots of hungry mouths to feed. Appeals to all the kids with sides of avacado, salsa, olives and cilantro. Great way to get some veggies in the teenagers and cheap if you use tortilla chips instead of Fritos that are near $5 for 14oz.

My 9 year old son rated this. He absolutely LOVED it and gave it 5 stars. I really liked it too. My husband doesn't lie thousand island dressing, so he only ate about half of his, while we went back for seconds. I added taco seasoning to the meat, halfed the amount of onion, kidney beans, dressing, and corn chips and we had more than enough. This recipe is very forgiving if you don't have enough of something or another or if you want to add your own special twist.

Basically the same recipe I have used for over 35 years.  Used more hamburger and 3 cans of kidney beans and shredded cheddar cheese.  Always made with oil free Italian dressing and we put our own crunched up tortilla chips on, so they stayed crisp and didn't get soggy.  Always used the bread making Tupperware bowl and it was heaped.  Mixed it in a clean plastic liner bag.  I was feeding 5 children plus 2 adults and never a crumb left!  Easy way to crunch tortilla chips is puncture bag( to let the air out) then squeeze bag with your hands to break them up.

This is very close to what I have been making for years. I mix a package of taco seasoning with the meat and cook it the way I would if I were making tacos. I add crushed doritoes last so they don't get soft. It's served warm and has been a hit in our family for years. I will try your recipe also;it sure sounds like 5 stars.

We enjoyed this salad (but I used Catalina dressing and Fritos).  Light and filling at the same time.  I've made it with meat and without.  It's great either way.  You'd never think Catalina would go well with the different flavors but it goes great.
