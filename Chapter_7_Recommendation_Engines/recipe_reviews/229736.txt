This savory approach with squash is how I prefer it - I don't care for sugar, molasses, maple syrup, honey, or anything sweet. But while the recipe itself appealed to me, I found the baking time off. At just 25 minutes, the halved squash was already cooked more than it should have been.  I brushed it with some melted garlic butter, sprinkled it with paprika and freshly ground pepper, and returned it to the oven for a few more minutes just to brown the top a little.  The oven temperature either needs to be reduced to 350 degrees or the cooking time shortened.

I baked this at 350* since I had other dishes baking at the same time. I did cut the bottoms so they would stand flat. This was delicious and a wonderfully savory change from the sweet syrupy style. We both enjoyed this quite a bit. I left the garlic off of one piece and it was just as good that way too. Great recipe and an easy dish.

It was nice to have a savory version of this squash. I had leftovers and added rosemary to it... when I make this again, I will definitely season with rosemary and thyme too, in addition to the recipe as is.

This was simply wonderful! I zeroed in on this acorn squash recipe because it wasn't the sweet kind. I definitely like savory over sweet as other reviewers have mentioned. I have an awesome Garlic Pepper mix (McCormic brand) that I used in place of the separate additions of garlic and pepper and cooked according to time stated. We were still talking about this recipe the next morning.  I can't wait to make this again! Thanks for submitting, arich01

Rating this recipe with 5 stars. Cooking time was appropriate. Using common sense ~ you will need to cook longer for a larger squash.  If unsure, poke with a fork to test the softness. The only thing I did different was add a little extra butter. Will say that "all" was eaten and positive comments given from my husband and sons. Thank you dearly for sharing this recipe.

This is the best way to enjoy the flavor of this squash.  The squash is sweet enough by itself without adding some type of sugar that other recipes call for.

This is SO yummy and easy! I've grown up eating acorn squash with brown sugar and butter in it...and don't get me wrong, it's still one of my favorites but I didn't want to introduce it to my son with lots of sugar, since that would be the only way he would want it after that. And he LOVED it this way. He ended up eating almost an entire half of the squash!
I think I added a little more garlic (but I usually do, since I love garlic) but other than that I stayed true to the recipe. My squash was on the smaller side, and the times worked out just fine for it. Honestly, I could have cooked it a little longer even...or maybe just turned the oven up a little more (maybe like 415? 430?) when I flipped them over. I'll try it next time. 

This was also my first time cooking squash...so any screwy results (like the fact the squash was still a little undercooked) could be chalked up to that ;)

This was so very tasty and the same reheated.  We will definitely have this again.  I did reduce the butter to save fat calories and use  more garlic because we love garlic.  Inspired to experiment more with squash.

These were tasty although too much butter for my taste. If made again I'll reduce the butter to maybe 2 tsp. per half squash.

I baked the small squash at 375 degrees for 40 minutes and it was just getting soft.  I added another 20 minutes to cooking time with the butter and garlic.  Very nicely flavorful.

I had smaller squash, so I cut down on the cooking time.  I think next time I would use garlic powder instead of fresh so it can spread better.

Loved it.  The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle with granulated garlic, instead of using fresh garlic. Yum.  Baked to perfection!

This was so easy! I grated garlic and melted it in butter. Once the squash was done, I brushed the mixture on top and baked 20 minutes more. Delicious.

Garlic Butter Acorn Squash Haiku: "Like that it's not sweet, so many winter squash are. But didn't 'wow' us." There was both too much butter and garlic in these - the butter was just dribbling and squishing all around, and while we are garlic lovers, this was a bit much. I did prefer this squash recipe to be savory rather than so many that have sugars and sweeteners, and while the directions were simple and the end result was good, it just wasn't so great b/c it was garlic and butter overkill. On the other hand, that IS the title of the recipe so maybe I should give it another try and reduce those 2 ingredients more to our taste. =)

I don't cook squash very much, but this will be my go to recipe when I do. Easy and very tasty, the only change I made was I use vegan, lactose free margarine. Thank you arich01 for this recipe.

Great alternative to a sweet dish.  Did 3/4 tsp of garlic salt and only 1.5 tsp fresh garlic.  Seemed like a lot of butter, but that did t stop me from enjoying it!

I thought this recipe was wonderful .  The cooking time may depend on your oven, check them when you flip them and adjust accordingly.  As is this recipe was great.  I did make it into a vegetarian meal by mashing it into a bowl with some sage, rosemary and thyme from my garden and then a drained can of Great northern beans.  I put it in a casserole dish and baked it again for another 20 minutes or so.

This recipe is a good alternative to a sugary filled squash. The next time I make it I will reduce the garlic by one half.

Perfect in terms of cooking time, but the squash is quite plain. I'll probably find a recipe with more ideas on seasoning next time.
