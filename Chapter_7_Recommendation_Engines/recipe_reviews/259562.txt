This review is for the filling only. 

Taste - 5 stars
Texture- 3 stars. 

HOWEVER, this never really "set".I t was more like heavy pudding texture. The reason I gave it 4 starts was because I used it as a 2nd layer on top of a regular baked pumpkin pie. So the bottom regular baked pie gave it more substance & weight as a whole pie. This filling was like a heavy flavored whip cream layer.
Everyone loved it, definitely will be making this 2 layer pumpkin pie .

My review is for the filling only as I made a graham cracker crust instead of this crust.  I made it as written except that I used my usual pumpkin pie spices (1-1/2 t cinnamon, 3/4 t ginger, 3/4 t nutmeg,1/4 t cloves)instead of "pumpkin pie spice" and extra cinnamon. It needs more sugar. I might make again, but I will try 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the pumpkin mix in addition to the sugar in the whipped cream. Nicer flavor than the awful cool whip versions of this pie.

My husband loved it! I thought it could have been better. I think leaving the pumpkin spice out would have been a good idea. I will add orange peel and lemon peel next time.  The pumpkin spice is too strong a flavor.
