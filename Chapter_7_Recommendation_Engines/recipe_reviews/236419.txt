It is even better with diced (baked & chilled) chicken instead of bologna or 50x50! It is better to use ZerGut Russian style Dills Pickles and Hellmann's Real (not Light!) mayonnaise or Russian mayonnaise like "Chumak" etc.

This was okay but a bit on the bland side for me. Perhaps more mayonnaise would help, or including the balogna (I went without because it was labeled optional). For me the flavors also didn't harmonize great.

Delicious! A taste of Russian Christmas! A bit of dill goes a long way, if you're looking to augment this recipe.

It is delicious, my whole family enjoyed it. I switched rotisserie chicken for the bologna, because that is what I had and it turned out great. Also added a dash of cumin, just because. We've had it on its own, with bread as a sandwich, or with crackers and even with tortilla! Great snack!

Love this recipe!!! Per other reviews I added some dill to taste and subbed cubed ham for the bologna. I also don't care for canned peas so I subbed frozen sweet peas and omitted the boiled eggs. Eggs are hit and miss with me in potato salad. I'll try them next time though. My wife said it was the best potato salad she's ever had.

I used small cubes of saut√©ed chicken breast instead of bologna; also 1/2 sweet onion instead of whole onion to accommodate taste preference.

I have loved this salad since I was a child when my mom made it on special occasions.  I made it by following the recipe here and it is just as I remember it from when I was growing up.  I also had leftover turkey breast that I added to the salad instead of ham.  It is delicious!

Made this for family dinner night. We were honoring Russian food and also had beef stroganoff and shchi (cabbage soup). I made a few changes to the recipe. I precubed the potatoes (skin and all) and bought shredded carrots. I also substituted the bologna with cubed ham. To make it easier to mix, and not squash the canned peas, I drained them and put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes. My son ,who hates potato salad, loved it. He even had a second helping.

This was excellent!  I replaced the sour cream with plain, fat free yogurt because that's what was in my fridge, but otherwise made it per the recipe.  I'll be making this one again!

Our host made this for our bookclub gathering.  She left out the ham but it was amazing!  I will definately make this for my family, including ham!

Yum!  I didn't put the bologna in it because I forgot to get it while at the grocery store today, but this still turned out great!  I will definitely make this again.  Maybe next time I'll remember the bologna!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
