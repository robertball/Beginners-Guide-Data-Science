Quick, easy, and delicious - perfect for a weeknight meal! My husband loves grilled pork so this was perfect for us.  I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and added a little minced garlic and let this marinade for about three hours just because I had the time and because with marinades sometimes the longer the better.  I used fresh pineapple vs. canned (personal preference) also added some vidalia onion along with the red and green peppers and cherry tomatoes. Overall, very good!

SOOO GOOD!!!  I made this recipe without any changes.  Hubby liked the moistness the canned pineapple added; but, next time I may use fresh pineapple so it will stay on the kabob better.  These were absolutely delicious!   Thank you Kikkoman for the recipe!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe just as it said and the pork melted in our mouths. Husband loved it. The only thing I would add would be mushrooms. The grilled pineapple and vegetables were great with the marinade. Will definitely make this again . . . with the 'shrooms. ;)   -Sheryll

Made it for dinner tonight!!! Had it in the vacuum marinater for 36 hours and the pork was butter knife tender and the vegetable were crispy on the edges and nicely cooked nearer the skewers.  I am going to double the sugar the next time I make this because the marinade was a little thinner than I liked, but otherwise it was a very tasty dinner entr√©e.

We made this over the weekend and fell in love with it. The flavors were amazing and the addition of the pineapple just gave it that subtle sweetness. I will say however I did not marinade the pineapples with the meat and other vegetables after reading some of the comments. The pineapples definitely would have been too mushy. Additionally I added  cherry tomatoes and mushrooms to the vegetables and it was just so delicious!   I found after adding the liquid marinade to the meat and vegetables that there really wasn't enough for basting so I just made a little more marinade.

This was so delicious! I used reduced sodium Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade on chicken and marinated for 20 minutes. Extremely tender and flavorful!

We thought this recipe was great.  I marinated the meat, pineapple and vegetables overnight, but next time, I would add the pineapples to the marinade a little closer to cooking time.
