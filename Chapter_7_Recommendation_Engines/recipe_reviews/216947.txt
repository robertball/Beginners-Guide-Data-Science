Fixed as written, except used panko crumbs mixed with Italian seasonings instead of bread crumbs. Aslo used Old Bay Seasoning as I didn't have salmon seasoning. It had wonderful flavor. This recipe would take care of any "fishy" tasting fish.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. 
Used Tom Douglas Salmon Rub for seasoning and plain bread crumbs.  My husband loved it.  I will serve this again.

Ladybug - there is something wrong w/ your Ladybug Poppy Seed Chicken Casserole.  When you click on the recipe (it sounds sooo good).

JOHNSONVILLE Pizza by Johnsonville Sausage automatically comes up.  This has happened with another site as well.

THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG.....

Really good! I also used panko beadcrumbs with italian seasoning, which turned out great. I did not have any salmon seasoning, so I just put some italian seasoning on the fish. I enjoyed this dish, it was a hit with the whole family, and super easy to make!

This was pretty good.  I used a whole onion and sliced it so that it became part of the dish.  I also added some dill.  The cheddar I used was a white herbed cheddar...so good!  I did run out of mayonaise however, so I used some cream and yougurt instead.

Yum! This turned out better than I thought it would. The flavors really came out, but didn't overpower the salmon. The only change I made was added a hint of lime.

The salmon was tender but the topping was a little heavy for my taste.

I normally cook my salmon with an asian flair and wanted to try something different.  This was really good!  The dressing is yummy!  I would even use it as a dipping sauce.  I prepared exactly as the recipe stated, but, I doubled the sauce because we had big pieces of fish.  Our cooking time was different, but you will just need to watch the fish based on how thick your steaks are.   Next time I think I will use parmesan instead of cheddar.  The nutty taste of parmesan should pair well with the salmon.  Give it a try!  Thanks for the recipe Ladybug!

We thought this salmon was pretty good. The only thing we didn't like that much about it was the cheese on top. I thought that just the sauce and breadcrumbs on top would be fine, and not even put the cheese on it. Otherwise, it was great!  Flavor was good (minus the cheese), and it picked up quite a bit of tanginess from the mustard and mayonnaise, which made it different. Fairly quick and easy to make also. My 7 and 3 year old ate it right up, but my 2 year old was a little hesitant to eat it. Since most of us in my family liked it we will probably make it again sometime. Thank you for the recipe, Atlanta Ladybug!
