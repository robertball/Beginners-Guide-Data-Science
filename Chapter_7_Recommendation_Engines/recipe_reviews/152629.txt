This definitely makes dieting a whole lot easier. This tastes soo good and I love cheesecake. I use 3 tablespoons of graham cracker crumbs and and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I've made it with strawberry jello and tropical jello and those were good too!

My first comment on this recipe is that I was a little confused as to how much gram cracker I was supposed to use. After much debating and searching on the internet I discovered only one cracker was to be used. I crushed it using my food processor to get it nice and fine.  I sprinkled it over the bottom of the pan. It is just enough to coat it. In regards to the flavor, well, you can tell it is a diet cake but it was great to have a good tasting low calorie option for dessert. The orange flavor was nice but I donâ€™t see why other flavors could not be substituted. I am tempted to try it again but use cherry Jell-O next time.
