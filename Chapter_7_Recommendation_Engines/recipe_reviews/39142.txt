I loved these cupcakes. They turned out moist and delicious. My boyfriend doesn't particularly like cream cheese, so next time I will just leave the creamcheese and chocolate chip topping off half the cupcakes.

We loved these cupcakes!!  Great alternative to the usual holiday pumpkin deserts.  And so much easier too.

Everyone loved it but me. I had never eaten anything with pumpkin in it (other than pumpkin pie) and wasn't sure if I would like it. But they were a hit with everyone else. My dad ate most of them!

Whenever fall comes around I have many people asking me to make these.  They are so moist and yummy!  I don't like pumpkin and my husband is not a big fan of chocolate, so these satisfy us both!  I actually spoon the frosting in between the cupcakes.
