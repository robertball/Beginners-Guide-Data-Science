I used Las Palmas Mild canned Enchilada sauce and it was not very good!!  The recipe itself was good, but if you are using canned sauce, be careful which one you choose!

I modified the recipe using the following, which is what I had on hand.  These are definitely "Americanized", but that does not immediately equal bad.  * 1 package Rice-A-Roni Spanish Rice, cook as directed (ingredients listed below) * 14.5oz can diced tomatoes with green chilies (I used Del Monte diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chilies) * 2 cups water * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil ---- * 1 pound ground turkey * 1 small chopped onion * 1 tablespoon fresh minced garlic * 1 fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped * 10oz can enchilada sauce (I used Old El Paso green chile enchilada sauce) * 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese * 12 flour tortillas  Overall this recipe is good for what it is.

I thought these were good and easy to make. I used canned jalapenos instead of fresh. It makes a lot of filling so I froze 1/2 of it to use later and it made for a quick 2nd dinner.

A wee bit too hot for my taste. I would have tamed it a bit. I have tasted many different kinds of enchiladas as it is wide open to a variety of fillings. I am used to Arizona Sonoran style and one of their "authentic" enchiladas are Sonoran Flat Enchiladas, which is rarely seen outside Arizona! It's the sign of a good cook to be creative..

Absolutely delicious! I shredded some chicken breast because I do not like ground chicken. I also used the ten minute enchilada sauce from this website. (Make sure to add the chocolate with that recipe). Canned Enchilada sauce is not appealing to me. This is a fantastic recipe and will be used many times again. Thank you!

These were great!  At first, I was a little leery of the chicken and broccoli rice, but you couldn't taste anything distinctive in the finished product.  I only used half a fresh jalapeno and it had a pretty nice kick.  These definitely will become a staple in my house. Also, mine made more than enough filling for eight tortillas. I would suggest making sure you have plenty of tortillas when making this just in case.

Thank you for this recipe... It was amazing!! It was my first attempt at enchiladas and I had rave reviews... Better than the mexican restaurant is what I heard :),, The only thing different I did was used a box of zatarans spanish rice, and 2 cans of rotel tomatoes. Thanks again, this recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! I substituted turkey for chicken and followed the rest of the recipe exactly the first time. I had my granddaughter over the second time left out the jalapeno and add more onion, super both times. Yummy

I loved this recipe! We made this quick and super easy, with hardly needing anything from the store. We used Rice-A-Roni Chicken/Broccoli mix, exactly how its asked, used a 1/2 white onion, 2 jalapenos, and 3 garlic cloves. It was amazing! Simple and tasty! Thanks!

Everyone loved it, even the kid who like nothing. Used dried onions and canned jalapeno. I also used a lot more cheese,in the mixture and topping. Also used the 10min enchilada sauce on this site.

Very tasty.  I was unsure about the rice mix, but it turned out really well.  It was also good reheated.  The total recipes cost me $10.  What more could you ask for?

Tasty - but if I made it again, I'd use a different flavor rice (mexican or white) and less picante sauce. A little too "tomato-y" for my taste.

Ok, well, I don't know what size container of rice mix I used (I used a box of Spanish rice Rice-a-Roni) but overall I had enough filling for 10 standard enchilada shells (the ones marked enchilada sized, specifically). However my 9x13 only held 5, so that was actually rather irritating, but it might've been totally my fault. At any rate in the future I would definitely make this again with plain brown rice seasoned with a tablespoon or so of homemade (or storebought, whatever) taco seasoning because I don't feel like the rice seasoning mix brought anything to the recipe except salt and I'm pretty sure I can do that on my own. Thanks for the recipe, I'm going to make this plenty more times with rice adjustments as I really liked the convenience of ground chicken!

I loved it! This was my first time cooking a real meal, and no one who ate it was disappointed. I love spicy foods and this was perfect. My friend took some home with her. She told me later that day there was a fight over the last enchilada.... 'nough said :3

Great recipe!  Super easy to make and great flavor.  It is pretty spicy so be careful with that jalapeno.  The kids did not care for it because of the chunky items but I will still make it again for the adults.

Very solid recipe. Didn't have a can of Rotel so subbed in diced tomatos with cilantro and lime in them, the lime was a great addition sice it helped to cut the fattiness of the cheese and rice.

I used a different package of the dried rice. It was a 'Mexican blend', and used everything but the jalapeno, the tomatoes with the green chilies made it just the right spicy for everyone to enjoy. Very tasty, and very filling. It makes 6 of the medium flour tortillas. I was impressed on how great tasting they were. Thumbs up!

These were pretty good. I used shredded chicken instead of ground chicken and used the ten minute enchilada sauce from this site instead of canned. It made enough for 8 enchiladas, which fit nicely into two 8x8 pans. So I baked one and stuck one in the freezer for later. Although they were good as is, I think next time I would make my own mexican rice for the filling. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!!!  I enjoyed this quite a bit!  I made it as written.  I think next time I'll do a few things differently.  I'd either pick out the broccoli pieces in the rice, or just use a different kind.  I really liked that kind of rice, but not the broccoli pieces.  I also don't think I'd use onions next time.  With so much in it, I didn't think it really needed the onions - plus I am not the biggest fan.  But on the whole - I recommend this!

Awesome recipe!  I had to substitute 1 pound of ground chicken with 1 pound of shredded chicken boneless breasts cooked with lots of seasoning the day before in crock pot.  Had a hard time finding the rice mix in the 4.5 oz mine was 6.75 but still the recipe was an AWESOME recipe.  No way you can mess this one up.  A REPEAT FOR ME !

I thought this was just okay.  Easy to make which was a plus and my kids liked it..so did hubby but I didn't love it.  I probably won't make it again or I may try changing the diced tomatoes to salsa and using corn tortillas instead of flour.

These were absolutely delish! I made them on Monday evening for my boyfriend and myself & they were just wonderful! I made enough to be able to have leftovers the next day and they were just as good the next day and I am not a leftovers kinda person! I did make one small adjustment I didn't use the tomato's with the green chili for fear with the jalapeno already in the recipe that it would be too hot, but other than that I didn't change a thing! WONDERFUL!!!

This recipe is great.  I was unable to find any chipotle peppers so I augumented chipotle sauce with jelapenos (finely diced).  My boyfriend and I loved it.  We would definitely make this again.

I adjusted the recipe somewhat. Had leftover brown rice and fresh broccoli I used vs box. Added some taco seasoning to (light amount) meat mixture. Jalapeno(heat) is good but needed more flavor. Topped with fresh cilantro!

I switched the jalapeños for chipotle peppers.  Also, for ease I put in uncooked rice when I added the tomatoes an then covered and let it simmer 20 min.   Topped with sour cream and served with salsa.

Off the CHAIN! I boiled about 4 chicken breast and shredded them first, then seasoned the chicken and followed the instructions (minus the spicy stuff) and it came out WONDERFUL.  This will DEFINETELY be prepared in the future! I strongly recommend this recipe

My fiance loved this but I hated it.  I was hesitant to try chicken with red sauce but I had ground chicken that I needed to use up.  I definitely prefer a white sauce and shredded chicken.  I made the recipe exactly as written and I just didn't care for it.  At least I can count on my fiance to eat the leftovers because this made 10 large enchiladas.  Thanks anyway but I won't make this again

I used a spanish rice mix instead of the chicken w/broccoli and subbed ground turkey for ground chicken. Couldn't find a 14.5 oz can enchilada sauce. So I got 2 10 oz. cans. Used one to mix in with the filling and one to top the enchiladas. Very quick and easy way to make enchiladas. Tasted great. More than enough filling. I made 6 enchiladas which filled up a 13x9 inch pan, but had enough filling to make 2-3 more enchiladas if I wanted.

This is an awesome recipe! I use the "Ten Minute Enchilada" sauce recipe from this site, but I modify THAT recipe by adding 1/2 small can of tomato paste, 1 ounce of dark chocolate, and trading chicken broth for the water.  The modified enchilada sauce gives this recipe a really "authentic" flavor I enjoy.

These are simply fantastic.  I had to leave the jalepenos out (for my wife) but we love this recipe.  I don't know what ground chicken is but it sounds gross, so I boiled boneless chicken breasts until cooked then mashed up the meat using the handle of a large knife.

Very Yummy!  Def going to be making this one again!  Scaled down the recipe for me and my husband by boiling two chicken quarters that I had in my freeze instead of using the ground chicken.  Also used jarred jalapeno pepper (like 5 slices).  Good and easy recipes!  Will make again (soon)!!

These turned out great!  I used the Knorr rice and broccoli mix, dried minced onion, 2 cups of a Mexican blend cheese, added chili powder, salt and pepper.  I used the whole Jalapeno (without seeds) and it wasn't hot enough for me.  I also baked these during the day and reheated for dinner...flavors were great!  Be generous in stuffing your tortillas or you will certainly have leftover filling.  Thanks Dillybar!

These enchiladas were great. I went light on the sauce which kept the tortillas from getting to soft. I also left out the jalapenos, but when I cooked the chicken (which I shredded) I mixed in a 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin, oregano, and chili power to give the heat and flavor the chicken.

I thought these were great. I'm not a huge spice fan so I left out the extra jalapeno and I added a small can of sliced black olives, which I thought was a nice touch. Somewhat high in sodium though; I might just use plain rice next time.

These were great chicken enchiladas, they are spicy just as the name suggests so, I suggest omitting the jalapeno or substitute a poblano or some other mild pepper if you don't like spicy.  We love spicy so I might try chipotle peppers or habanaro peppers next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave these enchiladas a trial run for my cinco de mayo party.  I liked that they were made with ground chicken.  I wasn’t a fan of the broccoli rice addition, gave them a strange taste.  I’d use Spanish or Mexican rice if preparing this.  Also found the 10” tortillas too big, and gave the enchilada a doughy taste for me. Appreciate your submission.

Simplicity & ease of recipe = 5 stars
Flavors = 5 stars

Did not like using packaged rice/broccoli powdered bag so I substituted:
1 cup of jasmine rice + a packet of Goya Sazon
1 bunch of broccoli crowns, chopped medium fine
2 skinless boneless chicken breast, small cubed

I made the rice and broccoli together in one pot. While waiting for that, I browned the chicken on a skillet on both sides, not cooking it all the way through.

Then I followed the rest of the recipe as described, and I used 2 cans of  El Paso Red Enchilada sauce. It turned out SO delicious. Even better the days after.

i wasn't clear on the rice and box sauce so i just used rice a roni chicken flavored. The mixture was very good. Easy to prepare. i drained the meat before adding the rice to it. I used green enchilada sauce. I didn't have a jalapeño so i sprinkled red chili flakes in it. I improvised a bit! My family liked it very much! Thank you for the recipe idea!

My husband LOVED it! He actually said "I think these are the best chicken enchiladas I've EVER tasted!" which says a lot considering we are originally from California.

Here is what I had to improvise on due to availability issues:
I used Rice-a Roni Mexican style rice
Coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (key)
I used jalapenos form a jar to = one large, NO SEEDS
Ro-Tel original tomatoes and green chillies
19 0z. can Old El Passo Red enchilada sauce.  (mIn. 19oz if you make 10). 
Organic Valley Mexican blend cheese + more OV Italian blend mixed on top (extra cheese please)
10 soft taco size flour tortillas.

I made those bad boys pretty fat, so I used up all the filling. I put 7 in my lasagna dish and 3 extra in a small glass dish to freeze for my hub. when I go out of town. :-D

This was excellent!
I used chicken breast and browned both sides.  Then shredded the chicken and used the recipe as is.
I used the powdered packet of enchilada mix, with tomato paste, water and seasoning, simmer on the stove to thicken and it was superb!  I opted out on the can due to the can leaving "the can taste" on the product, so glad I did! I will be making this again tonight!

Very tasty and easy.  Next time I am going to try shredded chicken as the ground chicken got lost.

They're very good but VERY spicy!  I ate the left overs the next night and they weren't as hot then but the first night I could hardly eat them!  Other than that I loved them.

this is a good recipe, but didn't specify what seasons to us so used own to enhance taste which turned out great
