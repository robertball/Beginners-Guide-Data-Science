I added extra carrots, celery and kale!  Very tasty combination!  It was great as is, and also good with a touch of soy sauce!

Made half the recipe for two of us didn't use celery neither of us like it, otherwise followed the instructions. Both liked it very much and will make the full recipe next time, it looked like it would be good as leftovers. My first time eating cooked kale, yum!

Based on rater comments I doubled the kale and added about 3 T. soy sauce for more flavor.  I didn't put in all the rice as it was still so much.  Rating it a 4 because it would have been pretty plain without the changes.  However, it makes a beautiful dish with good taste and texture.  Next time I'll also add garlic.

Needed a little more flavor for me, so I added a little soy sauce and hot sesame oil.  Also used a lot of extra kale, but there was plenty of rice for it.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful side dish to steak or any other protein for that matter.  Cooking rice in vegetable broth makes it super flavorful and no meed to add any other seasonings. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this for a small family gathering, and it was quite the hit. I didn't have vegetable broth so I used 'No chicken'  Chicken Broth.  I will definitely make this again.

Didn't have celery maybe next time. I think I will add kale before adding the rice to cook it down a bit. Tastes delicious!!
