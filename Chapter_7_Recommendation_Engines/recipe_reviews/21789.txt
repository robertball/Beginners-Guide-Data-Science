Good way to use up that garden zucchini! The key to this recipe is to sqeeze the excess moisture from the zucchini and onion, before you mix with the rest of the ingredients. I used sour cream as a substitute for the buttermilk, and used Colby Jack cheese, because it is what I had on hand.  I made mine gluten -free by using the new Gluten-free Bisquick Mix.I  finished mine  off with slivered almonds before baking.  I like a little crunch. Delish!

WOW!! This recipes is a gooey mess, but a delicious one!  I added some Mrs. Dash & a little grated cheese.  Next time, I'll try adding a few more veggies & make it in a bigger dish.  Excellent taste!

Talk about Grandma's comfort food YUMMMY! The house smelled great and the taste rewarded us!! Ok I vary things according to what I have on hand so... I DICED the mix of yellow squash and zucchini and had to use the sour cream variation suggested by someone else. I had NO RUNNY-NESS but maybe because I diced the squash or cooked a few minutes longer. I also added ground cooked chicken to the mixture. I found I needed salt but would not add it until eating and I think next time, the addition of a 1/2 cup of SHARP cheddar would make this dish PURE HEAVEN!! Can ya tell I liked it???

My daughter made a similar recipe to this for Thanksgiving.  It was fabulous and she shared the secret with me. To keep it from getting mushy, squeeze all the fluid from the zucchini before baking.  It will be perfect every time.

Very easy and a little healthier than several do the zucchini casseroles on this site.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and one egg, and minced my onions instead of grating (personal preference). Also added crushed red pepper after reading the reviews about it being bland....be careful though, I almost made it too spicy for my kids to eat. Cooked it exactly one hour in a glass pie pan and it came out great, not mushy.  Will definitely make again.

I gave it four stars only because I did not follow it exactly as written.  I did squeeze out the grated zucchini to rid of the excess liquid.  I added some grated carrots.  And I beat in 1 egg with the buttermilk.  When done and still warm from the oven I sprinkled grated cheddar cheese on the top.  I took this for a funeral at church and everyone loved it!

This was great! I ran out of parmesan so I added in some chopped fresh mozzarella in tiny cubes. I also added 1 egg and a pinch of nutmeg.

I didn't like the flavor of the cheese and zucchini together.  the baking mix was clumpy.  I will not make it again.  There were others who did like it though.

This recipe sounded appetizing and simple, but I really liked some of the substitutions of other members. I also used sour cream in place of the buttermilk and added an egg. I included sweet onions and 1 orange pepper. I added a few dashes of Garlic and Pepper Mrs. Dash for some extra flavor with a cup of Italian blend cheeses instead of the Parmesan.The final product was excellent and not gooey like some of the other members mentioned. It actually set like a quiche. I didn't shred the Zucchini, but quartered it instead. Maybe that made a big difference.

Turned out great! I added some garlic powder and chili powder for more flavor. I also added bread crumbs and shredded cheese on top for a crispier crust, but that's just preference. Also would suggest squeezing water out of zucchini. Otherwise, great recipe.

It was... ok. The only variation I used in the recipe was using sour cream due to my lack of buttermilk in the house. The rest was according to the page. I dunno, it just lacked.... something. I'm not sure what it was. I served this with a turkey I had done in the slow cooker, so we had gravy to pour over it, and that seemed to add the savory factor it was just lacking. I can see this recipe excelling maybe with some sausage or something like that. Also some garlic wouldn't hurt either. I am not a fan of the raw onion. I think the next time I will finely chop and sautee the onions first to mellow them out and sweeten them.

I will repost when I try some variations.

Oh and I DIDN'T have any gooey issues, I had shredded zucchini after an over abundance and I was tired of making zucchini bread. So, I had it in a plastic bag, which I opened slightly and basically rolled and squeezed all the excess liquid out of it. Worked out great.

I liked this casserole.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and squeezed the excess liquid out of the zucchini before mixing it with with the other ingredients.  Yum.

Ok taste, but next time I won't shred the zucchini.  I think it would be better diced instead.  It was too runny to be considered a casserole.  It almost needed to be served with bread.  If made a little thicker, possibly with a different proportion of ingredients, it might be better.

Loved this recipe! I have to be honest that I took a lot of liberty with it because I didn't have many of the ingredients and I was making it for coworkers that don't like onions. But I think that's the most appealing part of this casserole--the fact that you CAN change it to fit your preferences and it still tastes great :) 

Here is what I did: 
1. Used both yellow and green squash and omitted the onions
2. Added spinach 
3. Used the following spices (replacing the cheese): turmeric, garam masala, coriander, indian chili powder, salt and pepper. 
4. Added cilantro and curry leaves
5. Made my own biscuit mix because I didn't have any prepackage stuff 
6. Squeezed all the liquid out of my vegetables 

Really, really good and my coworkers loved it! :)

This was tasty.. I used 1 pound 9 ounces of mixed summer squash and threw in a few shredded carrots. I think next time I might use a different cheese... good basic recipe with lots of room for modifications.. It did need lots of seasoning for my tastes though

I made this according to the recipe. This tasted good, although, I am not sure I would make this again. It seems like it is missing something. I do like the tangy taste, but I think the Bisquick mix makes it taste too much like processed food.

Sorry didn't like it.  Gave 2 stars for taste and texture.  While I love parmesean cheese with zucchini, there was too much here.  Recommend half the cheese be cheddar.  Definitely needs salt, maybe celery salt?  Texture was just odd, it was more sticky than melted cheese "gooey"; and runny.

I always read reviews before I make something. I squeezed the zucchini added egg, peppers and cheddar. I used sour cream. I would say it was pretty good.

I added some tomato, shredded potato, used cottage cheese in place of buttermilk, that's  what we had. Salt and pepper to taste and topped with shredded cheese.  Awesome!

Runny, gluey, mess.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I would think an egg would have helped to bind, also squeezing liquid out of zucchini.

I love this recipe. I probably make it once a week in the summer. To change it up a bit I add basil and oregano and about a 1/2 pound of sausage or chicken! Awesome!!!!

After reading some reviews I decided to make it with a few changes...added spicy sausage that was fried with onion and garlic, used sour cream in place of buttermilk, added about 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese, along with 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups biscuit baking mix and a dash of cayenne pepper. I sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs on top with a little extra cheddar cheese. Hubby and I both really enjoyed it!  I will make this again.

I made slight changes by adding some seasingings, salt, pepper and a tiny pinch of cayenne.  My 16 year-old son even liked it.  We will have it again as we try to incorporate more vegetables in our diet.

OK, so I followed this recipe except I added a little salt and pepper and I used a 9.5 inch pie pan instead of a 9 inch pan.  I squeezed out excess liquid from the grated zucchini and onion based on the other reviews. Baked it for one hour at 350 degrees. It was a soggy mess. Nothing like the picture. Most certainly did not hold its shape. I stuck it back in the oven for another half an hour and it firmed up a bit. After it cooled down, my teenaged son ate it. So there you go.

Followed some reviews and squeezed out  the  juices from the zucchini and onion. Also added 1 egg. We made it gluten free with new gluten free bisquick. It was delicious! we were fighting over the last piece.

So, I made a few changes. Diced the zucchini instead of grating (and got rid of excess moisture as per other commentators' suggestions), added italian blend cheese instead of parm, used sour cream instead of buttermilk, and added chopped fresh spinach. Wasn't sure what to expect, but it was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend said it tasted like a giant tater tot, despite the complete lack of potatoes anywhere in the recipe. Will definitely make this one again, and experiment with other variations. Excited to try it with ground sausage next time!

We fixed this for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit, not a bite left in the pan when dinner was finished.  Mom even had seconds and she never has second's :-) 

Don't change a thing in the recipe, it does not need any adjustments.

I feel like it was missing something. It was very gooey. I tried to bake it longer, but it was still a weird texture. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Made this for dinner tonight and with a few of the modifications suggested by others and my husband and I just loved it!  I did a large chop on the zucchini and a medium chop on the onion, used half parmesan and half  cheddar cheeses, added some seasonings to boost the flavor.  I think I may add some fresh spinach the next time I make this dish...

Definately making again! I didn't have Parmesan so I used Mozarella cheese. Didn't use onion, unfortunately I'm allergic to onion. I wasn't sure if the biscuit baking mix was suppose to be prepared or just the dry ingredient.So I put it in dry and I'm glad I did.

My husband and daughter say this recipe tastes like something grandma would have made. Creamy and mashed potato-y. I have to agree. This is a definite do again!
