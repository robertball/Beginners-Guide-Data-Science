These cookies were excellent--really soft and moist!  I made a few changes though:  I used margarine instead of the shortening, cinnamon in lieu of the cloves, and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the nuts.  I didn't do the icing either (I don't think they need it!).  I made these yesterday, and they're almost all gone!!  I will definietly make thse again when I have "leftover" bananas.  Thanks Robin!

These are very yummy cookies!! I knew they would be soft from the name obviously but I do wish I could find a crunchier banana cookie. Anyway, I did accidentally add an extra banana to this recipe and then read reviews to see most people did this and was relieved! Also, I added a tbs of banana extract and some allspice for good measure. Very good strong flavor and nice texture. I am absolutely amazed when I read anyone got flat cookies, they puffed up for me almost immediately and didnt spread too much so I had quite a few on my cookie sheet, which i used parchment paper on.
Great recipe, and by the way I didnt even bother with any icing. May be a nice extra but I didn't even feel they needed anything else. Might try for fun sometime though! :)
UPDATE: I mailed this to my husband in Iraq and took him 2 weeks to get them and he is obsessed with them and cant wait for me to send more. Just wanted to pass that along, be sure and vacuum seal them but that they keep well! Thanks again!

These are like cookie-shaped banana cakes - yummy!  I drizzled the icing on instead of dunking them, and used only 2 cups of icing sugar, reducing the other icing ingredients accordingly.... found this was still too much icing, so if you're really concerned about wasting your icing sugar, try cutting back even more than I did.  Light and healthy!

These were good the first day, but by the second day, the icing was melting into the cookies and they were becoming a mushy mess.  They do have a good banana flavor and are definitely a cakey cookie, but probably won't be making this one again.

This is a very quick cookie to make! My kids devoured them! I put the icing in a Ziploc bag and the end off to drizzle over the top-I am going to use this recipe for when it is my son's turn to bring a treat to preschool and write each childs name on the cookie with the icing! =-) Thanks for a great recipe!

Banana "Cake" Cookies, indeed!  Very moist.  I used whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar.  And following a few suggestions I substituted butter for shortening and cinnamon for clove.  I used 1/3 of the icing recipe and it was enough.  Taste so much like banana bread!  This is a keeper!

Next time I would double the amount of nuts.  I will make these again.  They were very moist.  I think I would like to "fiddle" with the icing a little bit.  I shared some with friends and they liked them more than I did.

Very good. Cakey texture.  The only sub I made was to use butter in place of shortening only because it's what I had on hand.  Good with or without frosting.

I took the suggestion of the photo and dipped these cookies in powdered sugar and drizzled them with chocolate. I am not much of a frosting fan, so I omitted the frosting.  They were wonderful. Cake cookies are fabulous and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

We made these tonight without the icing and my son loves them!  Will try them with some sort of icing next time, as they're quick and easy, and taste just like the tops of a banana muffin.  Thought:  If you've tried the Oreo Cakesters, wouldn't this be a good variation?  Might make a cream cheese frosting and make a sandwich cookie out of them...  Day old these cookies leave a LOT to be desired.  If someone has a hint on stopping them from getting so smushy please share!

This was a good recipe to use up my over-ripe bananas and shortening.  Instead of dipping half of the cookie in the icing, I drizzled it on.  That way, I could control the sweetness by using more or less.  This is a soft, cake-like cookie that is quite delicious.

It amuses me when someone rates a recipe then makes a laundry list of the things they changed. It does a disservice to the original submitter, IMO. I didn't change a thing about Robin's recipe, only that I drizzled the icing on top. And these are just as good without the icing, but it tends to fancy it up! These are very easy and tasty cookies. Not overly sweet. I am taking to a party tomorrow and I know they will get devoured! By the way, one cup of mashed bananas equaled three medium bananas. Thank you Robin!

Soft, good, nice flavored cookies. Be sure to remember and sift the confectioners sugar as stated in recipe.  I doubled the nuts and drizzled the icing onto the cookies as other reviewers suggested.

These are  very good.  I think that the cookie part needs a little more sweetness (even with VERY ripe bananas).  Other than that, they're oh-so-soft and delectable!  A cream cheese icing would be really good, too, on these.

These were very good. I made some adjustments...I added a little extra banana which seemed to be a good idea. I substituted toffee and chocolate chips instead of nuts. I decided to forgo the icing since they were sweet enough. They were very moist, almost like eating just the top of a banana muffin rather than a cookie. I added extra clove and even a little cinnamon too but still couldn’t taste either spice much, so if your objective is a spicier cookie I would play around with adding more spices. I like them softer but I left one batch in the oven a few minutes longer and got a little crunchier outside but they were still soft on the inside. Overall a big hit.

I made these cookies today so I could use up the last two bananas of the bunch. They are very good. Moist and tasty. Although, as another reviewer noted, these are more like banana cakes in cookie form. They aren't a firm cookie consistency at all. That being said, they are delicious and a wonderful way to use up bananas that are just about to be too ripe. I drizzled chocolate icing over them my husband declared them PERFECT! Also, make sure that when you drop them on the cookie sheet you aren't using too much. These spread quite a bit. I was only putting 6 per sheet and the first batch resulted in a couple running together. Smaller scoops fixed that right up and they were prefect.

Very good!  I took these to work & they were a hit with everyone.  Not too sweet, and very moist.
I kept them in the fridge in an airtight container because it's been very hot & humid here.
Only changes I made were cinnamon in place of the nutmeg & walnuts in place of pecans, simply because I didn't have the other ingredients on hand.

I made these cookies and found them to be extremely simple. I omitted pecans and substituted cinnamon for cloves as suggested. I toyed with the idea of adding peanut butter to the recipe (as I usually play around) but am glad I didn't. The recipe was a hit. the cookies are SO moist and fluffy and delicious. I also baked a few with chocolate chips and those were also great. Thanks for an awesome recipe. I am a banana lover and always looking for banana recipes that others will also enjoy if they aren't crazy about bananas.

easy to make - again great way to use up that old banana. I used butter - always use butter. Instead of pecans I put in chocolate chips. Did not make the frosting as I don't think it needed it with the choc. chips. Love the cake like texture - I added vanilla to the batter and instead of cloves i used nutmeg and cinnamon.

Made exactly as the recipe calls for except that one time I put homemade chocolate sauce over them and the other, instead of Vanilla to the frosting I added strawberry flavoring(I am a lover of strawberry/banana combination) and OMG they were FANTABULOUS!!!! :) Definitely like a cake cookie, and a keeper at that! :) Thanks for sharing!

I made these with my 2 year old in mind, always asking for a cookie. Here are the changes I made, I used half the butter and subd the other halft with applesauce, I used one cup oatmeal ground down to a flour, I used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, I only used one egg all I had, and added some spiced apples I made from the night before to use up and a little chopped chocolate.    I did have to add some flour at the end to come to the right consistancy.  Baked them for 9 minutes and they are delightful. They are cake like but we dont care. Perfect alternate way to use up bananas and plus a healthier cookie my girl loves..Thanks!

Oh my! These are yummy!  Made these exactly as written except used half white-whole wheat flour (from Trader Joe's) and added 1 tsp cinnamon. I didn't measure the banana, just used all I had. They were a little flat, but still very cake-like. Probably because I used shortening. Sometimes it's not interchangeable with butter.

Just had one out of the oven - mmmm!  I, too, made a few alterations: I omitted the cloves (not a fan), didn't add pecans but rather chocolate chips (we are chocoholics around here), and left off the icing this time.  I also found I needed to add additional flour as the dough was very runny.  I'm guessing I added about another 3/4 - 1 cup more.  They came out fluffy & cake-like.  I will make them again!

I modified this recipe slightly. I used ground cinnamon instead of cloves and walnuts instead of pecans (just what I had on hand). These cookies came out so fluffy and yummy. Also, for the icing, I cut the ingredients in half. Then I piped lines across the cookies after they had cooled. The result is a nice sweet topping that isn't too much to overpower the cookie. I got a lot of good feedback from people I gave these to, so this recipe is definitely a keeper.

These are not cookies.  They are muffin tops.  If you want *very* cakey cookies they're ok.  Definitely do the icing and add more spice to the batter- they're bland without.

Once again I found myself with way to many bananas so I came across this recipe and gave it a whirl with my 13 yr old. Not only were they easy to make they were good! I agree with others who have said that dipping them in icing would seem to be a pain and too sweet. We just used a zip lock bag to make a "piping bag" and zig zaged the icing like the picture shows. Cookies are very moist which for my family is a plus! I did some of the same substitutions that other reviews did and had no troubles. I will make these again.

Nice way to use up overripe bananas and not too sugary tasting.  Drizzling the icing over the cookie gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  Kept well and travelled without breaking or getting crumbly...Really was like a little cake!

I followed the recipe exactly and wound up with completely flat cookies with a weird texture--not cookie-like at all. The flavor was good. I will not make these cookies again, but may do a variation of it as an actual cake.

These were really good!  I used cinnamon instead of cloves but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Mine came out pretty big - like muffin tops - but soft and really yummy!  Next time I will probably use smaller spoonfuls, but there will definitely be many next times!  Thanks for a great alternative to banana bread!

I thought these were delicious!  They were soft and cakey.  I made the glaze less sweet by using more butter, less vanilla and a splash of rum extract. Some lemon juice would have worked, also but did not have it.

These cookies are easy to make, but I wish the banana flavor was a little stronger.  The next time I make these, I'm going to try adding a little more mashed banana than what the recipe calls for.  The icing recommended was a little too sweet for me, so I'm going to try a boiled caramen icing I use for pumpkin cookies.  These keep well in an airtight container for over a week.

These may be the most unique, delicious cookies I have ever had. They come out perfectly every time, and no one ever turns them down. I served them at a party, and within minutes, they disappeared. They seem to be especially popular among my three-year-old twins, who love their "Nana Cookies". Good job!!!

I only made a couple small changes. I substituted butter for the shortening and used 1/2 of cloves and 1/2 of cinnamon, instead of all cloves. I made one batch and decided that all they needed was a drizzle of the icing. They are good on their own. For the 2nd half of the batter, I added a spoonful of peanut butter. It only gave it a slight hint of peanut butter. Still very good.

These are easy and delicious. I didn’t have quite enough banana so I added a couple of tablespoons of cinnamon applesauce to make up the difference. I was out of confectioners sugar, so I melted some chocolate chips and used that to attach a whole pecan to the baked cookies (also added some chips to the batter because...chocolate). Yummy and pretty! Perfect for football brunch...I call them muffin top cookies which is a lot like what they are. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious!  A nice change from making banana bread with over ripe bananas.  I substituted chopped chocolate chips for the nuts, because I don't care for nuts in cookies.  Grandkids loved them. Soft and moist.  I did not frost them, figuring the chocolate added enough extrasweetness

These cookies are ok.  I had to make a few adjustments so that they weren't bland; I used 1.5 times the amount of ground cloves and double the pecans.  Also, don't make the mistake of using unripe bananas.  If there isn't another option, just add another green one.

These are ok, I think they are a little dry. They are more cake than cookie, I was expecting them moist. I made half the icing and drizzled it on top and had leftover. I used walnuts and chocolate chips instead of pecans

I did make some changes.  I used EnerG Egg Replacer and Earth Balance butter instead of eggs and shortening to make it cholesterol free.  I also used Cashew milk in the frosting to keep it cholesterol free.

The cookies were moist and delicious. I made half with icing and I couldn't tell which ones the family liked more, icing or no icing they all disappeared!

I made these with margarine also (didn't have shortening on hand). I also didn't make the icing, but simply sifted some powdered sugar over them. Frankly, I thought they were delicious without anything on them. I hate throwing over-ripe bananas away and this was a great way to use them.

These were ok. I accidentally mashed more bananas than I needed (an extra cup) so I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour to compensate. I used margarine instead of shortening as I don't like shortening. I also substituted chocolate chips for the nuts so my kids can take them to school. I found them very cakey as intended but lacking in flavour overall. Also, even with extra flour the cookie dough was way too sticky so I chilled the dough, even after chilling it for an hour it still didn't firm up. Not a bad idea for a cookie but I won't be making these again.

Decent use for leftover bananas. Perhaps more interesting than banana bread. My favorite recipe so far for old bananas is muffins with cinnamon sugar on top!

Delicious, cakey cookies! Never again will I throw out ripe bananas. I followed this recipe to the letter except I used mini chocolate chips instead of pecans. That's just what I had on hand. Next time I am looking forward to using the nuts. I also made three mini bunts with this dough just out of curiosity. Just like the cookies they tasted just like banana bread ??

Awesome recipe. Thank you for sharing! Very easy to make and doesn't really use that many ingredients. You can do cinnamon for cloves. And it's ok to mix in a tad bit of white sugar along with the brown as well as a little bit of butter with the shortening. Four smaller bananas are just fine. You will not miss the separate topping, but if you're not making it (and it's very much ok without it) you can drop a few drops of vanilla in the mix to bring up the flavor. All in all a great recipe.

i was looking for banana cookies and i picked this one because it told me how much banana (1cup) instead of how many bananas...i made it exactly how the recipe read and my family loved them, they liked without the icing better, so next time i'll skip it.

I have made ton of recipes with bananas, but I never a banana cookie. These are so good. I made the recipe as it is written, except I did add cinnamon chips. The interesting thing about these cookes is that they tasted even better the next day. Everybody loved them and asked me to make more.

Used 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Did not use nuts. Used 1 cup semi-sweet choc. chips instead.  Did not have brown bananas, mine were just starting to have brown spots, but still was great. 2 large bananas = 1 cut mashed.  Did not do icing don't like super sweet stuff. Do not over-mix when adding dry ingredients (I added the dry stuff in about 3 increments, not all at once). Baked 12 minutes at 350. Best cookies ever!  These are my favorites cookies now.

If you love banana bread, you will love these! They taste just like it. I used butter for shortening and cinnamon for cloves and choc chips because the kids don't like nuts. Everyone loved them. Very soft and cake like. You need to like a soft cookie to like these though. I drizzled the glaze on top, but they were great without it too. Will make again!

tastes like muffin tops.  they are a little sweet.  My husband thinks they are really good.  one of my kids refuses to try it because it is a banana cookie.  I added chocolate chips to some of them, and those are the ones that got eaten first.  Did not add nuts due to allergies, nor cloves/cinnamon due to preference.

I feel like it's probably a good base recipe, but is missing something. I thought the soft, cakey texture was the highlight of this cookie. The taste was bland. In fact, I reread the recipe after I prepared it, thinking I surely must have left something out. I did use cinnamon instead of the clove, and even a bit of nutmeg, but the taste of the cookie was still disappointing and unlively. I used chopped peanuts instead of the pecans. I feel as though the nuts helped to give some flavor to an otherwise unremarkable recipe. After I baked half of the batch, I threw some chocolate chips in the remaining batter (and this was, to me, a batter, not a dough). In my opinion this salvaged the recipe.

Excellent soft cookie. Great texture and taste. I didn't have a full cup of mashed bananas so I added about 1/4 cup applesauce to fill the cup. Also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Cookies were done in 8 minutes and I made them big! No need for icing, they are great without.

These cookies were a huge hit at our recent party. They tasted absolutely amazing!I did follow the suggestions of others & substituted butter in place of the shortening & cinnamon for cloves. Also because I was trying to visit with a friend & make these at the same time I completely forgot to add the eggs but to my surprise you would have never even known they were missing. Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

I am pretty obsessive about reading reviews of recipes for alterations before trying one. I didn't really alter much here. I did sub cinnamon for the cloves (as that is what I had) and I probably ended up with about 1 and 1/4 cup banana as I went ahead and just mashed three. I omitted the nuts and added dark chocolate chips. I did need extra milk for the icing as the recipe suggested (and I didn't measure here... but it was 3 "splashes") and I poured it into a bag, clipped the edge, and drizzled it over the cookies. They came out great and are really cute!

These cookies are so delicious!! My family loved them and I will be saving this recipe. I made a few changes for my own liking. To the cookie mix I added cinnamon, vanilla, another cup of bananas, a bit more flour and used walnuts instead of pecans. They don't really need the powdered sugar and frosting so made half the frosting and drizzled it on.

The cookie was good.  The cloves overpowered the banana flavor.  I will make these again bur will with eliminate the cloves or substitute cinnamon for it.

I was on the fence rating this recipe.  As others have said, they're cake-like, consistent with a muffin top.  Very light and airy.  I'm not quite sure what to make of them.  I was hoping for a more dense texture.  Switching out the shortening with butter would be a wise idea, as well as adding additional spices.  Hubs likes them, but I don't think I'll be rushing to make these again with my overripe bananas.

Yummy, just what I was looking for. I didn't have pecans, but I had dried dates, which are a nice treat. I dropped generous spoonfuls of dough and got about 30 cookies. I only used about half of the frosting. Not sure it's needed; they'd probably be good without, or with sprinkled powdered sugar instead. I'd probably make these again. My five year old head fun helping mash the bananas and measure the dry ingredients. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Perfect flavor! I followed recipe for the cookies exactly and omitted the icing. As some others mentioned, this is more like a muffin top. Sort of a spongy cakey consistency, in a good way. The name of the cookie is apt: "banana cake".

My three medium  bananas made one cup. The "dough" is the same consistency as for banana bread so I used a tablespoon and loaded the tray like a drop cookie. Mine yielded 24  3" cookies. I left trays in for 14 minutes at 350. 

I may substitute butter next time, as I am not a fan of shortening. That will yield a flatter cookie. And maybe add a smidge of vanilla. But this one is a keeper, thank you!

This was great I did it with my 4 year old niece it was simple and fun. The cookies are sooo tender. I added about 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of cloves as well as vanilla about a tsp as well. Amazing!!! Will do again!! Oh and 4 Banana s didn't bother measuring it just used them all up :)

These are wonderful! I made them with chocolate chips and didn't try the icing  because of laziness. They were very popular at my house and were eaten up quickly.

Incredible. I just made these and they were absolutely delicious. They are definitely more like a muffin top then an actual cookie. Very soft and cake like.  I made some changes. 1 c white & 1 c wheat flour. I didn't have any ground cloves so i used 1 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Used 2 large bananas and instead of 1 cup shortening i substituted with a mix of butter & applesauce.  Did not make the sauce on top as it's made for my 2yr old and i don't want it melting all over him. It tasted great just as is. Also used lots of pecans.  I have never really used wheat flour to bake before because i was afraid of the change in taste but these were just so good.  My 2 yr old loved them which is the whole point :)

These were good...  tasted like moist slices of banana bread.  I would rather make the bread as it is quicker and easier to store.  But the cookies were a fun try.

Really good!  I followed recipe other than used cinnamon instead of cloves, added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and did not use frosting.  Delicious.  Very light and fluffy, and super easy to make.

Moist, light and good banana flavor. I did back the ground cloves down to 1/4 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon.  I was unable to add nuts due to an allergy so I added 3/4 cup mini semi sweet chips. We also wanted a chocolate glaze and decided on the Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site. Everyone really enjoyed these and I would be happy to make them again. Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made to the recipe was adding a 1/2 cup more brown suger and a cup and a 1/2 of mashed banana (2 bananas: one medium sized, one small).MOST IMPORTANTL: I used cream cheese frosting AND OMG TOO DIE FOR!! everyone in my family LOVED THEM! (recipe for frosting: 4 ounces cream cheese, one cup powdered sugar, 1/4 butter, splash of milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla) BANGING'!

I made these cookies for the first time today. It won't be the last!!! 2 bananas made 1 cup mashed. I left out the cloves, as I was adding cinnamon chips. Also, my kids loved the cookies before I had a chace to glaze them. The cookies were soft and a little chewy at the edges. Another great use for overripe bananas. Thanks, Robin, for sharing.

I used this recipe as a base and made a lot of changes.  I use butter instead of shortening, only 2/3 c brown sugar, 3 ripe bananas, and substituted 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 cup of the all purpose.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon and no cloves.  I also added 1/2 c whole oats and 1/4 c ground flax.   I did not add icing.  My 2 year old loved them and I didn't feel too bad about him eating them as a snack.   Next time I'll sub some applesauce in for part of the butter.

My daughter made these (with a little help).  She didn't want the nuts so we left them out.  I missed them, she didn't.  Everyone enjoyed these cookies and they went quickly.  We did substitute half whole wheat flour and I addedd a bit of nutmeg, maybe 1/4 tsp, just because I really like it.  Will definately use this recipe again.  We used 3 bananas.

TOo sweet. Use less sugar. Other than getting a tooth ache these were scrumptous. I would recommend using more banana to get that great banana flavor.

This cookie was what I call "fine." It was eatable without being a WOW. Dipping in the frosting was way too much sweetness and it overwhelmed the mild flavor. I ended up drizzling frosting on instead and this was much better. A just okay cookie.

Great!  They are better the next day.  I didn't have nuts so I used 1/2 chic. Chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips. Next time I will add even more chips and add the nuts.  Also I didn't make the icing and just sprinkled them with powdered sugar due to lack of time.

Great recipe-I made them a few years ago and my sons loved them as kids-just made them yesterday and they still love them! In fact they inhaled nearly all.  I did use about 2/3 c brown sugar and the rest Splenda-I did not have the Splenda Brown sugar mix on hand-and could tell NO difference,  Otherwise did all the same but only made half the frosting which was plenty.  They are just so good and go down sooo easy!  I have a convection oven and did not bake quite as long-only 8-9 minutes. They were just right. Thanks for the recipe and glad it was still here as I couldn't find the copy I had printedn out.

These cookies were excellent. They are very moist and had no problem with them rising. I did add the extra banana and used margarine instead of shortening. I made a whoopie pie filling and turned the cookies into banana whoopie pies. My family loved them.

These cookies are wonderful!!! I cannot believe how good they are! My husband and Kids and I cannot stop eating them. I am making my husband take them to work tomorrow so that I do not eat them all! I made a few minor changes. butter flavor shortning instead of the regular shortning. and cinnamon instead of cloves. also- I added minichocolate chips and walnuts instead of pecans. I did not do the frosting-it did not need it at all! these are awesome!

Like muffin tops, great!  I drizzled with the glaze and some semisweet chocolate in order to keep them from being too sweet.  Very little of the glaze is needed.  I also bumped up the banana in it.  I will make them again.

I didn't anticipate loving these banana cake cookies, I made them primarily from older bananas and for the kids. They turned out SO great! I doubt there will be any left by tomorrow morning. The only changes I made were to change the nut to a walnut instead of pecan, and I doubled the nuts to 1 cup (pureed them in a high power blender so they wouldn't be too crunchy for the kids). Also, I used 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour. Edited to say: these did not save well overnight - became soft and VERY sticky, gooey. Better to consume them all the same day!!

Perfect cookies! They're SO easy to make & turn out moist & delicious. They're great w/ or w/o the confec. sugar ontop. However, I did take the advice of another reviewer & replaced the cloves w/ cinnamon, then added 2 large bananas: 1-browning banana, the other still had a good amount of green on the peeling (I think this helped the banana flavor really stand out).

These were very quick and easy.  I made from the recipe as written, except I used mini muffin pans and added 2 min. to the baking time.  The recipe made 36 muffins.  Very moist.  Because the muffin has slightly more bulk than a cookie, the frosting was just right and not too sweet.  I will definitely make them again but will probably add more spice for a fuller flavor.  Great recipe.

These cookies were good. I did everything the same except for the frosting. I just drizzled melted dark chocolate over the top after the cookies had cooled.

Gave this four stars because when put in muffin pan, tastes like ordinary banana muffins.  That said, what I really liked about this recipe was that it did make 24 regular sized muffins and they were very moist.  The frosting made it sweeter so as it became a dessert rather than a breakfast "bread/muffin".  Definitely will make again.

these were a hit the first day i made them, everyone said they tasted like banana bread. i drizzled the icing on them like it is in the picture and it looked nice. however, after a day or so these cookies didn't taste that great, so i recommend eating them all within the first day or two!

This cookie really lives up to its name. We loved this and I too added nutmeg and cin. I have not tried to icing yet but we usually dont do that part anyway. They are GREAT without it.

These were pretty good, but not out of this world.  I'd just as soon make mini banana muffins if I'm in the mood for banana.  Didn't care for the icing at all - way too sweet!  I just drizzled some on for decoration

These were great! They tasted like banana nut muffin tops.  I used a heaping tablespoonful of batter so that made them about the size of muffin tops.  I brought them to work and everyone loved them.  I made the frosting also but they really didn't need it, in my frosting I noticed I was out of vanilla so I used butter flavoring instead and it was just right.

Thanks for this recipe!

These cookies are really yummy!  I didn't add the cloves or pecans but they were still great!  I agree with other reviewers on cutting back on the icing.  We ended up with lots of extra.  Very soft and moist cookie!  Delicious!

Easy and good.  I left out the pecans, but they would have been a great addition.  My 3 1/2 year old loved them, but he wanted sprinkles on top.  This is a keeper for using those really ripe bananas.

These were pretty good. I'm the only one in the family who will nuts, so I made them without. I definitely think they'd be better with nuts. They were good straight from the oven even without the icing.
