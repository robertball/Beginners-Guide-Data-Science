I made a test batch with three kids (ages 5,4 and 3) Although they pronounced the individual spices "Icky", they gobbled up the finished product.  I made the following changes for subsequent batches: stir the spiced butter with the popcorn in a large bowl - much easier than keeping it in the pan; Don't add the cheese to the butter - sprinkle it on while stiring;  put the popcorn in a jelly roll pan (11x14), Do not bake longer than 15 minutes (parmesean cheese starts to burn); reduce or eliminate the 1/4 tsp salt, it is plenty salty. NOTE: 1/3 to 1/2 cup unpopped kernels makes 2 1/2 quarts popped  





Make more than one batch.  Oh - 1/3 -1/2 cup unpopped popcorn makes 2 1/2 quarts popped.

What a great idea!  This is a great recipe.  Since my kids (who have allergies to wheat/rye/barley/etc.),  cannot have pizza unless I make a special pizza dough (and who has time for that?), this is a PERFECT quick fix until I get around to making a homemade pizza.  My 10-year old son is crazy about this popcorn.  I mixed the seasonings up in a ziploc bag for ease, and used microwave popcorn and an olive-oil spray instead of butter (which I imagine will reduce the fat/calorie content even more) but I do intend to make it just as the recipe calls for, as I bet it's even better that way!  I overcooked the popcorn the first time, which resulted in the parmesan mixture burning, so I'll probably try to cook it much lower (i.e. 250 f) next time. Thanks so much for this great snack recipe!  My kids are already bugging me to make it again.

LOVED this popcorn.  A great way to jazz up boring corn from the air popper.  The baking process makes it nice and crunchy, and the party guests all commented that it "tastes exactly like pizza". I found that baking in a casserole dish left some soggy kernels on the bottom, so I spread it out in a single layer on a baking sheet and baked a little longer. Next time I will skip the casserole and use baking sheets instead.

This is awesome. I cut it down to just a medium mixing bowl full of air popped corn with just a one tbsp. of butter. (I'm trying to lose weight and popcorn is not only low in calories, but low in carbs as well, as is parmesan cheese!) Not only did I love it, but so did my kids. They were asking for seconds. This one's a keeper! I think I might pop the corn next time, dump it into a big ziplock bag (as another reviewer suggested), then add the butter and seasonings and shake it like mad. I think the person who had the suggestion to use tomato powder is a genius. Now....where to find it.......

I made it as directed except lowered the oven to 300 degrees as others suggested.  It still browned too quickly. I thought it was so-so.  I won't bother making it again.

I made this for my family to snack on during a football game.  I followed the recipe exactly and although I liked the flavor my husband and kids weren't wild about it.  I think my kid just weren't enticed by the appearance of it but once they tasted it all was good.  The whole bowl was gone by the end of the game. I probably would make it again.

Absolutely amazing! I sprayed with butter spray instead of using melted butter. You get better, even coverage of all the popcorn that way.

We really loved this recipe......I used Italian seasoning for the basil/oregano and used about 2 1/2 bags of buttered microwave popcorn.  Thanks for a keeper.

I thought this was great. My kids eat a lot of air-popped popcorn, and I'm always looking for new ways to spice it up. I was reading the ingredients on a package of organic pizza flavored puffs and thought- tomato powder!!! I googled it because I know manufacturers use it, but I didn't know if home cooks can buy it. You can! I'm kicking around the idea of buying some and trying this recipe again with tomato powder.

I tried this recipe becauce I was thinking of making some air-popped popcorn, but wanted something different than the normal salt-and-butter. In short, this recipe is fabulous!!!  The only thing I changed was instead of using the entire 1/3 c. of butter, I cut it down to 2T, and added about 3T of olive oil.  The spice blend really does mimic a pizza flavor, and the baking creates a dusty, golden flavor.  Try it!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Wasn't horrible, but I didn't think it tasted much like pizza.  Maybe better with tomato power? ... probably won't make again.

I've made this recipe for my daughter's snack day at school (1st grade) twice.  It sounds as if it has been well-received by the children, and I think it's pretty tasty, too.    The first time I made it I had a hard time mixing in the butter -- my largest bowl wasn't quite big enough.  The second time I used the lid from my Rubbermaid cake saver as a bowl.  It worked perfectly!  As someone else suggested, I used jelly roll pans for baking.  Fifteen minutes at 350 burned the cheese, so I changed it to ten minutes at 300 degrees.  We don't use a lot of salt, so instead of garlic salt, I used plain garlic powder; and I used a scant 1/4 tsp of salt.    Will make this again . . . thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, using 2-1/2 quarts popped popcorn and all ingredients. The only deviation was 300 degrees for 10 minutes. 1) The popcorn was too salty and greasy. 2) The herbs and spices were not over powering. I tasted more of the parmesan than the herbs/spices. 3) I will try this again using 5 qts popcorn, same recipe, and double the parmesan, and less salt. I gave this 3 stars because of its saltiness and it was mediocre to the taste buds.

A nice change from plain popcorn.  I actually thought it tasted better before it was cooked..... And 15 minutes is to long, mine burnt and I took it out of the oven at 12.5 minutes.  I did check and stir it at 6 minutes and probably should have given it only a few more minutes as I did notice the cheese was turning brown on the bottom of the pan.

Great recipe!  Highly addictive - this tastes just like pizza.  I followed other suggestions and used spray butter instead of the 1/3 c butter.  I ran out of parmesan cheese so I used mozzarella - and it still turned out great!  Will make again!

I don't like this as much as I thought I would.  Not sure why, actually--I like popcorn, and I like all the spices called for but it just wasn't my favorite.  It is easy and relatively quick.  I set the timer on 10 minutes instead of 15 minutes and I am glad I did--if I'd set for 15, it would have burned.  10 minutes was the perfect time.  I used two bags of buttered microwave popcorn.  Oh, and just one word to the wise--if you use a bag and shake it around, make sure your popcorn is cool enough.  I think it was the butter, but it melted holes in my bag.  Thanks for the recipe.

This does not have the pizza flavor I was expecting.  To me it tasted like Parmesan Cheese.  It was good but not a favorite.

I didn't have garlic salt so I just used garlic powder instead.  I also used half shaker Parmesan cheese and half fresh grated Romano cheese.  That being said I kept everything else the same.  I really liked the flavor, though I thought it was mild.  Most of my friends really enjoyed it though a few thought it was to herby.  Nothing survived the game night though so it was a hit.

My daughter asked if I was making pizza while this was baking LOL. It did taste like pizza. I sprinkled some ranch popcorn seasoning on top before eating. Very good.

I don't know that I'd say it had "pizza" flavor, per se, but it was a nice change of pace from regular buttered popcorn. The garlic powder was definitely essential in this recipe.

Made this as a snack for my daughter's 3rd grade class.  My daughter was not so keen on the flecks of spices "contaminating" her popcorn. :)  The kids seemed to like it, but I actually didn't think it had that much flavor to speak of.

Really did taste like a pizza! Not great, but a nice change.
