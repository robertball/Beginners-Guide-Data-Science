I cut a sweet potato into chunks, and then mixed everything in a plastic bag before spreading on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet.  I baked these at 375 for about 20 minutes!  Delicious!  We will have to make some more soon!

Salty, sweet, spicy, all in one bite! These are delicious! Such an interesting blend of flavors. I only cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 6 mins and they were starting to get mushy, so I think 10 mins would be much too long.  The only thing I noticed was that they seemed to be slightly dry, so next time I will make extra sauce so I can baste them more often. A keeper!

I thought this was such an interesting recipe I had to try it.  I'm glad I did because they were very tasty.  Be sure not to cook your sweet potatoes too long in the microwave or they will be mushy when you cut them and won't grill as well.  Cook just till just barely fork tender and then slice them up.  It didn't say to peel them first but I did.  If you are cooking something else on your grill it would be hard to make these for a large family, unless you have a huge grill.  I served with Kickin' Turkey Burgers with Carmelized Onions from this site and we dipped them into the sauce recipe for the burgers.

These had a very interesting flavour.  I used sweet and regular potatoes.  I found the microwave time for the sweeti potatoes to be way too long.

It's not a "Wow!!!" flavor statement, but it is nice. DH, who does not like his sweet potatoes messed with, actually reached for the second part of his serving. (He had opted for a tiny taste-and-see portion on the first round.) I adjusted serving size to 2 and used a farily large sweet potato. I ended up using about four minutes on high in our microwave for the pre-cook phase. Meanwhile, I mixed the spices, vinegar and oil in a zip lock bag; later placing the "fingers" of par-baked potato into the bag for a shake-to-coat application ahead of grilling the requisite time. This was easy and was a nice alternative to butter and cinnamon. We will do again. (This time we served with a spinach salad and grilled steaks.)

I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to try sweet potatoes and I was really hoping this would be it.  Unfortunately, we did not care this one that much.  It was just average....none of the flavors stuck out.  Maybe with some tweaking it would have reached the wow factor or I think if I found a good dipping sauce then we would have enjoyed it more.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I took Sueb's advice and cut the sweet potato up and baked it in the mix.  This is usually my preferred method for fries but I can guarantee that you will have soggy sweet potatoes at 375 degrees.  You have to bake them at a much hotter setting.  I liked it but there are other recipes on here with a more complex flavor of herbs and spices for sweet potatoes.  My oldest son did not like it at all.  The rest of us did but mostly because I made a chipotle/lemon dip to go with it.

I love spicy food, and in several magazines I kept seeing good things about sweet potatoes.  This recipe makes a great combination of both things!  Plus, my girlfriend avoids sugar, so this recipe was a winner on that count too.  A couple of suggestions: First, you could cut down the salt without hurting the outcome any.  Second, watch your grill temp -- if you don't pay attention you will burn one side of your fingerlings RIGHT NOW.

Really good.  I peeled the potatoes first, cut them in 1/2" slices on a diagonal and then par cooked them in boiling water and shocked them with ice water before putting them in the spices, etc.  This is a fun summer side dish!

Really enjoyed these potatoes.  I made this recipe using 2 sweet potatoes and 2 Yukon Gold potatoes.  The microwave time for the sweet potatoes was a little long.  The second time I made them I stopped at 8 minutes and I liked the texture of the potatoes better at 8 minutes.  The spices are very nice on both potatoes, and you can increase the 'heat' by upping the chipotle chile powder, if you like.  Loved the taste the grilling added.  I served this with "Doreen's Ham Slices on the Grill", another AR recipe.

I do not like sweet potatoes but I really enjoyed them cooked this way! Loved the different spices, a very interesting blend of flavors. Will definitely be cooking these again.

These sweet potatoes were just right...spicy but not hot. They were not too soft on the grill at all...however I suggest doubling the recipe for the marinade so that you have enough marinade left to brush your potatoes while they are grilling.

The best sweet potato fries/wedges recipe I've tried yet! Incredible flavour with the blend of spices and apple cider vinegar! Will definitely make again. The only change I made was using cayenne pepper instead of chipotle chili powder (didn't have any) and using half the amount called for.

If I were going to make these again, I'd leave out the apple vinegar and add more salt. These were definitely okay, but then, there's not much you can do to mess up sweet potatoes, besides undercooking them. To me, the most prominent taste was the apple vinegar, which I could've done without.

I made it exactly as the recipe specified, but thought it was just okay.  I would recommend basting the potatoes with the oil/spice mixture during cooking which may help.  As one reviewer said, they got a little dry and the cinnamon flavor overwhelmed the other spices, I felt.

We do lots of sweet potatoes in this house so I was looking forward to this on the grill.  It was just ok for us.  The flavoring was just average compared to other sweet pot fry recipes.  They didn't seem to cook to our liking on the grill either.  We'll stick to the oven.

Good, but I think these would have been better in the oven and with a bit more spice (obvously my preference).  Husband and kids didn`t like them.  We all usually love grilled veggies so thought this would win them all but not this time.

Super easy  and fast to make.  I peeled the potatoes and then cut them into halves before I microwaved them.  Even tho I overcooked them in the microwave, they still turned out crispy in the oven.

Good recipe.  I couldn't use the grill, so I did as reviewer suggested and cut into chunks and baked in the oven.  Next time I will try the grill.

These were really tasty and definitely brought a tasty spin to "healthy" sweet potatoes.  However I found pre-cooking in the microwave for 10 minutes to be way to long.  Suggest trying 5.  At 10, they came out too soft which make marinating and grilling difficult.  Still tasted great!

My hubby loves these. Excellent idea to microwave them first. I cut them into rounds instead of lengthwise but it all tastes the same.

These came out pretty good on the propane grill. I'd make them again for a quick side!

This sauce recipe is amazing. I changed it up a bit and a thinly sliced the sweet potatoes about 1/4" and covered / coated them in the sauce and baked in a 350' oven til tender.  It's a hit!  Did back off on the hot sauce but that is always subject to taste.

Keep an eye on your potatoes when you put them in the microwave. These had good flavor!

This was excellent! I only was making for myself so only used 1 sweet potato but halved the spices only as I like a lot of flavor. I was surprised by the way the cinnamon and Chipotle went together. This smelt amazing, and tasted even better. 
Will be making again!

I will make these again but 10 minutes in MY microwave was too long.  Potatoes got mushy and no amount of time on the grill could crisp them up.  It's got potential but I will definitely cut down on microwave time and let most of the cooking be done on the grill.  Unless I'm really hungry.  :-).

Very good.  My boys are not crazy about sweet potatoes.  I saw the youngest going for seconds.  Will definitely make again.

First, I love sweet potatoes but I didn't love these sweet potatoes.  I saw the recipe and had to try them.  I read various "helpful" reviews but I didn't get the flavor.  I think I would have done just as well to slice the sweet potatoes in wheels and grill them.  That would bring out the caramelized flavor and be just as interesting. I won't try this recipe again.

This is a nice recipe. A lot of flavor that works well with sweet potato. I roasted these instead of grilling them and they were nice with a little crunch.

pretty good. baked for 45 mins at 400 degrees instead of microwaving, but it came out great.
