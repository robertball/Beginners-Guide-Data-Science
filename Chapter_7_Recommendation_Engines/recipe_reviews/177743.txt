My 12 year old made this for supper the other night. She doesn't like tomato-anything, but liked this dish. She ate every bite and even took it to school for lunch, cold. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 3 stars because it was a little plain. I added vegetables and garlic with the meat as I stir fried it. The meal itself was super quick to make. The children liked it well enough. The adults wanted more flaovour in the sauce.

Pretty good. I added some minced garlic and onion and Worcestershire sauce and cheese for taste. I think I would add fresh basil in the future. Overall, easy and tasty!

I went by the basic recipe, but added a little steak sauce and pepper. Then I poured the hot mixture into a casserole, sprinkled a light layer of grated cheese, then covered the top with mashed potatoes. After baking in a 350 oven for 30 minutes, remove the cover and let the top brown for 10 to 15 minutes, then remove and let stand for 5 minutes. It's a complete meal, meat potatoes and veggies.
