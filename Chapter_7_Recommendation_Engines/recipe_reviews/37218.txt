I really liked this recipe, the molasses and mustard together gave it a really different flavor. My husband thought they were okay, but wasn't as impressed as I was.

Thought my family would love this because they all like molasses and mustard.  They said it was okay, but no one requested to have it again.

My husband loved these, I thought they were good.  After being in the marinade all day they were very moist and tender.  As the recipe is, the molasses flavor is a little strong and hides the mustard flavor.  I will make these again altering the amounts of molasses and mustard.
