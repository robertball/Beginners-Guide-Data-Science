I halved the recipe and made it in my small crockpot.   I subbed diced dried apricots instead of cherries and added a small handful of crystallized ginger.  I wish I had been able to stay close by when it was cooking because at 2 hours it was definitely done but the edges and bottom were on the verge of being burnt.  I think 90 minutes would be more reasonable at least for the smaller cake.  Overall the taste was good but it wasn't heavily ginger tasting which I would have liked more.  It tasted more like spice cake to me.  I will probably make this again but tweak it a bit to make it more moist and gingery.

The edges burned, even after cutting them off and trying to serve with ice cream, no one was impressed. Too much trouble to try again.
