This is the first review that I have written for AllRecipies and the reason that I am commenting now is that Chef John's recipes are practically perfect!

I made this for my Daughter who is gluten intolerant, and I was blown away by this decadent cake. I did exclude the cayenne simply because I was out, and made a granache for the top and served with homeade whipped cream. It is now a regular dessert well worth the effort which really is not much, I am just new to baking from scratch.

OMG!!! If you are not a chocolate fiend like me then this is definitely NOT for you!!! I cheated a little in preparing this because I do not have a double boiler (it is on my list of things to procure). I used a regular sauce pan and put the stove on its lowest setting to melt the choc/ butter sauce Hershey's special dark chocolate bars, they seemed to work just fine as opposed to the cacao chocolate bars, I suspect would be expensive. I wouldn't serve this without the raspberry sauce, as the cake is extremely rich and requires the sauce to cut the sweetness.  I tasted it without the sauce and almost wanted to ask for insulin to prevent high glucose coma...lol.  Overall, this is sweet, easy to prepare, has very few ingredients and is impressive by any cooks standards.  I can't believe I have paid up to $10.00 in restaurants for a desert I could have made myself.  Chef John, you've outdone yourself once again!!!

This reipe lives up to it's name. It is totally chocolate and toally decadent! A chocolate lover's dream cake! We absolutely LOVED it! It was easy to bake and didn't require a water bath. Followed the directions to the T. I served with just a bit more decadence; heavy whipping cream. (I used liquid coffee mate on mine as it is Lactose-free) If I could, I would give this a 10 Star rating.

I only had 16 oz of chocolate in my pantry but I did not even adjust any of the other ingredients at all and it came out like a dream from chocolate heaven.  I only had Ghirardelli chocolate which has always been a disappointment to me but it worked out wonderfully....it must have been the 10 Tablespoon butter-infusion....I mean, how can that fail?

Amazing dish. I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't get the 62% Cacao chocolate bars. I used some Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips and it was still one of the best desserts I've ever had. I also topped it with his raspberry sauce. This is a birthday dessert for sure.

This was AWESOME and simple to make! Will definitely make again.  Made exactly as written except melted chocolate and butter in pot over lowest heat since I don't have a double boiler.  I was out of cayenne so added a pinch of chili powder instead.  Dusted with powdered sugar before serving.  Very dense and sinfully rich!

Made as written. Directions were spot on. Used Ghirardelli Baking Bar Semi-Sweet Chocolate which is about 50% cocoa per their website. Using an electric mixer on high settings, it took about 8 minutes to bring the egg mixture to a pale and very thick state. Whisking this mixture would seemingly take quite a bit longer and be a workout. Perhaps not a guilt free indulgence but well worth every pleasurable bite. Made the "Fresh Raspberry Sauce" to compliment this dessert, and had vanilla frozen yogurt for anyone wanting to add a scoop. Thank you, Chef John.

My sister-in-law has celiac disease. She invited us to dinner, so I wanted to bring a dessert she could enjoy. This is one for the ages.  I would make this again and again.  We gobbled it up.
The four of us  had no trouble eating half the cake.  Yum!
Chocolatey, rich and delicious  with the raspberry sauce. Thanks for the tip.

Oh my goodness!!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it!!  I didn't make the sauce, just dusted it with a little powdered sugar.  It was just right for me (a chocolate lover).

I was looking for a chocolate cake for Mother's Day and saw this was the only on with 5 stars & many reviews.  I now understand why.  This cake was so delicious.  I followed the directions, and it came out so phenomenal.  Everyone was raving about it.  All I paired it with was Cool Whip, Breyers extra creamy vanilla ice cream & raspberries.

This was quick, easy and oh so delicious which is my idea of a great recipe. My only change based on my preference was using coconut palm sugar instead of white and it turned out perfectly.

I made it Gluten Free by replacing the regular flour with gluten free flour. I couldn’t wait to eat it so we cooled for 15 minutes, ran a knife around the pan and inverted it on a plate. Topped slices with real whipped cream. Fantastic recipe.

This cake is definitely rich,  but  since I love chocolate, I don't mind a bit.  It's wonderful.  If you're serving it as a post-dinner dessert, maybe lighten up on the dinner.

Very rich as described. I didn't have any raspberries on hand so I made a strawberry sauce just subbing strawberries for raspberries, but I blended it instead of straining and used very little sugar so it was quite acidic. You need acid to cut through this cake's richness. I completely forgot the salt in the cake but it still turned out fine, though I'm curious to know how it would've tasted with the salt. To those worried about the cayenne, it's undetectable once finished, not spicy at all so don't fret. I also suggest watching the video as I had never whipped eggs before and didn't know what texture they should be. You will definitely want an electric mixer for this. I used a stand one. Oh final thought- I used toll house semi sweet chocolate chips I had on hand. I do wonder how chopped semi sweet dark chocolate would differ.

Oh and a couple reviews have said they melted the chocolate and butter in a pot instead of user a double boiler. Watch the video- you don't need a real double boiler, just a pot of water and a heat proof bowl that can sit on top of it. It's a lot easier than melting directly because it won't burn if you forget to stir it.

I followed the directions except for the double boiler which I don't have. I melted the chocolate and butter over low heat instead. This cake came out fabulous! It's rich but somehow not way to heavy. I also made the raspberry sauce to go with it and that just took it over the edge to a restaurant level dessert. Thank you Chef John!

This was a really rich and decadent cake. You've got to be a chocolate lover to appreciate this one. I was planning to use ganache to glaze it, but all it really needed was a dusting of powdered sugar. This is perfect for a special Valentine's Day dessert.

All the chocoholics in my family LOVED this! The recipe is perfect as written, and goes together very quickly. The only difficult part is waiting for it to chill to the point of devouring it.

WOW!! This is so freakin' good!! I used milk chocolate in place of the semi-sweet/dark chocolate and it was still awesome!! Everyone LOVED it! I garnished with sliced strawberries. May make a raspberry glaze next time! My new Favorite dessert!!  Can't stop thinking about it when I'm trying to decide on what to make! Thank you, Chef John!!

I followed the directions exactly and the cake came out great!Very dense and wet could just barely taste the cayenne. I topped it with a ganache but made that very thin-more for looks than taste. My only issue was the eggs and sugar never got thick or pale (ribboned)but after 20 minutes I had to stop. Cake was a hit with my Husbands staff. Will make again and do something different for the frosting.

This was so delicious and surprisingly easy to make. The only thing I would add next time might be just a bit of vanilla extract, but really it's super yummy as is and satisfied this chocoholic's craving.

This was an absolute hit with my hubby and I. I accidentally bought milk chocolate chips and used those instead. The middle was gooey with chocolate and added a few fresh strawberries on the side to cut down the richness. Definitely will make again and again!!

It was a hit with my wife and her mother. I used half unsweetened chocolate and half semi sweetened. Served with vanilla ice cream, this was heaven.

I have made this a few times now for parties exactly as written and its gotten rave reviews from the chocoholics in the group.  Take your time and do it exactly as written, its worth it.  I've started topping it with INGRIDEVOGEL's chocolate ganache....KILLER

We added 1 TBS. Dutched Cocoa and 1/2 TBS. Instant Coffee to tone down the sweetness.  Next time plan on substituting flour with higher fiber option (Oat Flour+Graham Flour+Spelt Flour)

Tried this recipe for Christmas 2015! I used gluten free flour and fructose  (sugar from fruit ) turned out deliciously! Would probably bring it to room temperature before serving next time!

Creamy, rich, and wonderful! If you have a chocolate craving, make this!I didn't even whip the eggs until they were very thick (after 15 minutes I decided enough is enough), however the finished product still tasted divine.

I think I died and went to heaven!  This cake is fabulous.  I love it. Anyone who has made Chef John's recipes knows the value of cayenne :)

It is incredibly rich, but just as I remember from years past.
