Loved this recipe!! I just microwaved the chocolate because I dont have a double broiler. I used 10 candy canes and used dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate. I also used peppermint extract and put 1/4 tsp in dark chocolate and 3/4 tsp in white chocolate. I've never made this before and was a little nervous that it would separate when broken but I read to just put it in the freezer while you heat up white chocolate then carefully smooth over the dark chocolate and it turned out fantastic. I also put mostly candy cane dust in between the layers and pressed in some of the larger pieces. I will definitely be making this every year!

Thanks so much for recipe! It's so quick and easy to make and a great holiday treat! I made the recipe twice as the first time I had a problem with the chocolate and white layers separating when I cut it.  On the second batch, I did not add the layer of mints in between the two chocolates. I spread the melted white chocolate over the already spread (but still warm) milk chocolate layer, swirled the two together with a knife and sprinkled with the crushed mints. The second batch came out perfect!! Thanks again for sharing. This one is a keeper!

We used alcohol-based peppermint extract and it turned out fine (the chocolate didn't seize).  We melted the chocolate on the stove at a very low heat (warm).  It took about ten minutes, but it turned out perfectly.  I didn't have my double boiler since we are away from home.  Also, after we poured the white chocolate on top of the dark, we let it sit out for about 10 minutes hoping to give the warm white some time to melt the top layer of the dark to promote bonding.  It worked great!  I was nervous because of the other reviews of it not bonding together so we decided to let it sit out for that purpose.

Very easy to make, especially if you use chocolate chips for easier melting. I felt like the peppermint oil and three layers of candy cane bits was a little excessive, so I used the peppermint oil only in the white chocolate portion and sprinkled the candy cane bits only on the top. it looks perfect in little gift bags I found at Hobby Lobby, which I'll be giving my kids' teachers as gifts this year.

Just made this & it looks great! Was super easy & taste fantastic. I didn't use a double boiler, just a sauce pan & low heat, (gas stove) & stirred it constantly!! Also used dark chocolate chips & then white chocolate chips. Giving it as gifts for Christmas, Thanks Allrecipes!-Marla

Great simple recipe for a polished product! I used dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate. Higher contrast in colours is prettier and extra sweet is not needed. Very easy to do in double boiler, no need to worry about scorching, so you don't need to watch it so carefully. Definitely opt for the peppermint oil, it adds a punch of flavour.  I used candy canes and put them in the freezer so they crush up beautifully in a plastic bag using a hammer. Be sure to have a pan big enough so you can spread this out thinly. It's too had to break up (and eat) if it's too thick. Thank you, this goes into my Christmas repertoire. Great for gifts!

I am not sure why, but my layers did not bond together. I will also pulverize some of the candies into a dust for the next batch to give more of a variety of textures. Overall a great recipe and I will definitely keep it for reference. I had planned to gift much of the batch but the family got to it first. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Every thing was fine in the recipie but I dont understand why it called for a 9x13 pan when it should have been spread out way more than that. When I think of bark I think of thin delicious peices not huge chunks. Definatly will try tomorrow and thin this out. Oh and I left out the peppermint oil. Was just right with out it.

Very Good! Very Easy! Just to thick!  
This need to be spread out into a jelly roll pan or a large cookie sheet or maybe even just two sheets of wax paper.  it needs to be thinner so you don't break you teeth when biting into it.

I made this and it was a big hit! Following others advice I did not add peppermint, also I couldn't find peppermint oil. I used 2 bags each of Wilton light cocoa and white candy melts. Used a double boiler. I crushed 4 candy canes, spread out on cookie sheet w alum foil. Melted choc and spread on top of candy. Crushed, pulverized 4 more candy canes, spread ontop. Put in freezer for 30 minutes.  Melted white melts, spread ontop choc/candy.  Crushed 4 candy canes and sprinkled ontop. Probably should press them in a little.
Perfect! Only thing to do next time is to even out the chocolate layers on the sheet.
Will be making sgain. So easy.

I adore this recipe. I have made it several years in a row. The only thing I have to say is watch the white chocolate. It tends to clump up. Stir it often and scrape the bottom with the spatula.

I love this recipe.  And  a helpful tip is if the chocolate gets think and hard as you are melting it add a tsp of milk to bring it back. :) ;)

Fast, easy and delicious!  I used a 1/2 sheet pan and the final product was still a bit thick.  The only change I'll make is to spread it into a larger pan next time.

I'm giving the recipe a 5, but I'm giving me a 1.  Do *not* do what I did and use peppermint extract.... it's NOT the same as peppermint oil.   Peppermint extract is not nearly as strong as peppermint oil.  Guess I'll be making it again the correct way.

Made this 2 years in a row.... always turns out delicious. I make one batch with semi-sweet chocolate and 1 batch with milk chocolate. I made a couple changes. I use 12 oz ghiradelli chocolate chips and I put 1 tsp peppermint extract in both the white chocolate and milk/semi-sweet chocolate layers. I also only use 2 layers of peppermint candies -the small dusty pieces between the layers and then sprinkle the bigger chunks on the top.  Candy canes are easy to come by this time of year so I just unwrap and crush a box of 12 up and that seems to be enough for both batches.  Alcohol based peppermint extract works fine for me. Last year, I followed the recipe exactly and I had some trouble with the layers separating as I was cutting so this year, I'm putting the first layer in the fridge for only 15 minutes then adding the second layer of chocolate and letting it sit at room temp for 10 min so both layers mesh together. Then put in the fridge for 30 min. **Note: This method didn't even work, the layers still separated when I cut. The only method that works for me is not letting the first layer of chocolate set at all and carefully spooning the second layer of chocolate over the first layer and spreading very carefully so they don't mix.

Well it turned out ok but since normal chocolate is stupid expensive we used almond bark but it made it split apart and we should’ve used like a cookie pan but it might’ve overflowed. So it was meah could’ve been better. And the photo won’t upload but it’s fine lol.

Well I accidentally omitted the peppermint flavoring so I melted it all back down and added in extra extract.  It turned out to be delicious.  I used round peppermint candies and using a food processor to chop was very challenging.   Eventually I used a heavy hammer.  Of course I put the candy in a plastic bag a little at a time and covered with a towel prior to hammering. Took  more time but I finally got some chopped peppermints.   I actually liked the mixture with the chopped candies inside. My bark actually looked like tree bark with the dark chocolate mixed in with white chocolate etc.  Looked pretty with the layering but I had no choice in the matter after I messed up.

I made this with crushed up candy canes (small and large) instead of just regular peppermint round candies. It is delicious, makes a huge batch, and a small bite goes a long way. It tasted just like a peppermint patty to me. I have it out as gifts and kept some for the family. Great hit!

Tasty, but definitely NOT thin peppermint bark. It was so difficult to break apart that sometimes the layers split. Use a larger pan than recommended!

I have made this twice now and everybody loved it. They left the store-bought bark alone in favor it this bark. I used dark and white chocolate chips, and I crushed candy canes in a bag with a meat tenderizer. Very easy and it served a lot of people. A definite keeper.

I made it with only 1lb of chocolate each, and it still felt a bit thick. In the future I would make it on a baking sheet or in two batches in order to make it thinner.

The layers were far too thick in the 9x13 pan.  It would be much better to either cut the amounts in half, or use a much larger pan. Bark should be thin and easy to break.  This needed a chisel.  Other than the thick chunky texture, the taste was good.

I made as directed, except as others suggested, I used a large jelly roll pan.  I used  Ghirardelli chocolate chips. The white chocolate hardened nicely, but the milk chocolate melted on our fingers whenever we picked it up. I also think that 1 tsp. of peppermint oil was a bit strong,  Will try again with a different chocolate.

It tasted wonderful. The only problem I had was the chocolate separated when I cut it. I had to leave it out for about 30 minutes for it to thaw out a bit then when I cut the rest it stayed together.

I also microwaved the chocolate. It makes it very easy. I had no trouble with separation. I personally think it needed more candy canes but besides that I think it was delicious and everyone gobbles it up!

I used hershey kisses, crushed candy canes, and I tempered my chocolate. It turned out great, rich and creamy, but not too sweet. 
I will definitely make this Christmas candy again.

Easy and yummy! I used more peppermint dust because I don't like big pieces of peppermint. Excited to add it to the goodies for my kids' teachers.

Easy to make. I don't have a double boiler so I just melted the chocolate in a pan and it worked perfectly.

So good! Didn't have a double boiler so filled a pot halfway up with water and placed a pan on top. Worked great, the result is fantastic! Highly recommend! -Sophie

I made this and it was yummy!  I put layer of crushed candy on bottom and top, not in the middle.  Just seemed easier to have a smooth surface for the white chocolate layer.  I gave it, as gifts, along with homemade caramels, and everyone loved both of them.

Followed recipe as written.  Tasted great:) The white chocolate separated from the dark when I was cutting the bark up.

I make this every Christmas for a Christmas party. I use a layer of finely crushed candy canes between the layers and larger pieces on top. I haven’t had trouble with the chocolate getting lumpy even though I add a few drops of alcohol-based mint flavoring to both chocolate layers. I melt dark chocolate candy bars for the base layer. This year I switched from my makeshift double boiler (a saucepan set in a frying pan of water) to microwaving it 30 seconds at a time on 50% power and stirring in between. (Twice for the dark and once for the white chocolate) Much easier. The candy is very pretty- sweet and minty. They disappear quickly. [Note - I have found that the candy cane pieces will get sticky and soft if you wait too long before adding them.]

9x13 is too small a pan for the amount of chocolate. If you use 1.5 lb each, definitely opt for a full cookie sheet if you don't want bark >.5in thick. No need to put peppermint chunks down on paper first, will get swept up when smoothing out milk chocolate. When smoothing out white chocolate, make sure to not scrape milk chocolate with spatula.

It's a pretty easy recipe to work with and it turned out well. The only issue we had was similar to others that reported that the two layers of chocolate separated in spots when breaking apart. Other than that it tastes good.

I twisted the recipe a little bit, rather then using white chocolate I used the hersheys kisses candy cane. It came out really good. I put it in the freezer for faster way for chocolate to set.

Turned out great! Only thing I would say is to read the editors note before starting! My chocolate clumped up because I used a alcohol based extract. Still yummy though!

I used dark chocolate and used a few more mints on each layer. It is fantastic.  However some of the chocolate did separate but it was still really really good

I love this recipe. I halved the recipe using 1 bag of white chocolate chips and 1 bag of semisweet chocolate chips, 15 peppermint and 1/2 teaspoon mint flavoring. I added 5 drops of red food coloring to the white chocolate chips.

This recipe is easy and tasty but I did something wrong.  :(
I used 2 separate bowls to melt the white and dark chocolate. For some reason, my white chocolate turned brown!?? I don't know what happened and it's not as pretty as yours... but it tastes good.

This was pretty but the layers should have been much thinner than the recipe directs. The pieces would up almost too hard to bite through.
