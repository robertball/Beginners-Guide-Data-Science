This is outrageously good.  Like eating at my favorite restaurant, only a lot cheaper.

The spice ratios in this recipe are no good. The amount of turmeric and garam masala struck me as excessive but I made the recipe as stated anyway. The result was flavorful, to be sure, but the flavors were not balanced correctly. I ate it, nonetheless, and doused it with yogurt to mask the strong turmeric taste. I guess you could make this with 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric & garam masala and it MIGHT be OK, but there are so many other great Indian/Pakistani dishes out there that I wouldn't bother.

This recipe was great for a lot of reasons. 

It was incredibly flavorful, and the taste just improved as leftovers and after freezing. 

It's low-fat, low calorie, high fiber, and packed with vitamins.  

It's easy to make substitutions using what you have on hand.

It's cheap!

I made this for my book club when we met after reading "Three Cups of Tea," which takes place in Pakistan. Since there were 10 of us, I doubled the recipe and hoped it would be enough. It made a HUGE amount of food. What was supposed to be 8 servings turned out to be closer to 20--though it was served as a side dish. Even if I had only made a single recipe, it still wouldn't have fit in a medium saucepan!

I followed the recipe relatively closely, with probably a little extra on the spices. The next time, I plan to try yams instead of potatoes. 

I served this with Pakistani Spicy Chickpeas from this site, basmati rice (cooked in a rice cooker with 3 whole cardamon pods, some turmeric, and a pinch of saffron), and frozen naan (Indian bread) from Trader Joes. 

I love Indian food, and this was close, but a lot less greasy. Do check out the detailed nutrition information on this recipe. I am in awe that anything that tastes this good can be so good for you!

Too much tumeric and way too much water. Would have been tasty with much less of both and more spices. Disappointing.

Good--but WAY too much water. I used butternut squash instead of potatoes, and it seemed to work perfectly...but only add that 1st 1/4 cup of water, then see if you really need to add any more.

I used 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper for lack of peppercorns, and eliminated the salt.  This has great flavors!  I'll be making this again!

Of all the Pakistani recipes I have made, this is the only one that actually tastes Pakistani.  It was a lot of work to make it, but it made a lot.  It's very spicy, so I would lessen the spices if you don't want it that way.  I made this recipe exactly as written.

I played around with the spices a little, and I also decreased the amount of potato called for as Husband isn't a big fan. Turned out great, though I wish I had added some chicken. Served it with basmati rice and paratha. Not bad at all. Thanks!

This recipe had some really good flavors. I reduced the turmeric to only 1 tsp. because I find it to be a strong flavor which I don't usually like to predominant a dish. I added plain yogurt as some reviewers suggested and it was a really good taste. Thanks for sharing:)

This was spicy and delicious!  I used a pack of shredded cole-slaw mix and eyeballed the spices.  I used turkey stock instead of water.  I would definitely make it again.  YUM.

I almost always add pepper to food but this was hot and spicy just the way I like it. I look forward to making this again soon!

Definately need to add some salt and sugar, more so than what is called for. Also added chicken and it was very good.
