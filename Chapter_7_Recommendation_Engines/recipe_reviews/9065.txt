This recipe turned out great. However, the original directions were slightly confusing and way more time consuming than need be. I steamed my carrots and brussel sprouts for 10 minutes while the sauce ingredients were coming to a boil. I then placed the veggies into the sauce and stirred gently while boiling for a good 5 minutes. I let this simmer for maybe 10 minutes inorder for the glaze to set in. Turned out fantastic!

I made this with a few revisions. I only added about 1/2 of the chicken broth (to give it a more "glazed" consistency), less pepper and more brown sugar. I also added grated orange peel. Wow, it was fabulous! Made it for company and they raved about it - every ounce of it was eaten.

This is an outstanding recipe.  My kids will now eat brussel sprouts.  I will continue to make these veggies.  The only thing that is absolutely necessary to follow is the reducing of the sauce.  When putting the brussel sprouts and carrots into the sauce, the amount of liquid increases.  So be sure to wait until it is reduced enough.

This was an easy and great dish to make.  It's my favourite brussel sprout recipe ever!!! I just made it simpler by boiling baby carrots and frozen brussel sprouts together until the carrots were cooked (it helps to get most of the bitter taste out of the brussel sprouts if you like them but not love them), then i just added it to the sauce and put the mixture into a deep dished baking pan and let them glaze for a bit on low in the oven.

Delicious-served it with Roast Pork with Maple and Mustard Glaze and Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes.  My father-in-law couldn't get enough of these.

My guests loved this today, made to accompany Rita's Sweet Holiday Baked Ham (this site), another great find.  I like to prep ahead to avoid chaos at the 11th hour, and this was perfect.  I prepped then steamed the veggies until al dente the day before, plunged them in cold water, then put them in a ziplock bag.  In the early a.m., I made the glaze and was pleased with it reducing perfectly in about 10 minutes.  Later, I simply reheated the veggies in the glaze and they were great.  I only used a dusting of pepper.  The glaze is thin, but that's the way it should be ... flavorful, but leave the candy coating for desert!  A definite keeper.  Thanks!

Mmmm!  Sweet glaze with sweet vegetables!  I personally thought the glaze tasted better on the brussel sprouts since it naturally soaked it up. I also tweaked the recipe a little bit and used 1/2 cup chicken broth, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and pepper to taste. Thanks!

Tonight for Xmas eve dinner for 10 adults and small kids, I mades several side dishes from this site -- this recipe being one of them. This was the only 'blah' dish, and was disappointingly NOT glazed, and not special at all. I tried to follow other reader's suggestions to use less broth, and more sugar, and to ensure the mixture was reduced properly, and did all these things, however the veggies were NOT glazed. I do not suggest you try it. Sorry.

Am I the only one that thought that 1 tablespoon of pepper is WAY tooooo much?  It was so spicy that it was almost inedible.  I needed to add many things to tone down the pepper.  I was wondering whether it was a mistake in the ingredients.  Sorry, but I wouldn't make this again.

One word: DELICIOUS! I'm a novice at cooking but I know good food and this was it! It's simple, quick and yummy. I wish I could attach a picture because the expression on my husband's face said it all. Thanks for sharing!

First of all it takes longer than 6-7 min to reduce the glaze. It won't be thick so if u like it that way u will either need to add more brown sugar or some cornstarch.  This dish has a beautiful presentation with intense colors and looks great on the plate.  It has a mix of favors; carrots pick up the light sweetness while the Brussels sprouts have the peppery, hearty flavor. It's an interesting mix.  I made this for Xmas dinner side dish and we only had three ppl. I would recommend only making 1/4 of this recipe. It was way too much and can easily serve more than 8! Mine turned out tender with a lot of flavor, although I have tried other sprouts recipes on this site that I like better. If u like mixing flavors and want to try something different this might be the recipe for you.

Like others I also found the sauce to be a little too soupy and needed to add a bit more brown sugar. I let the sauce simmer which helped thicken it up. Otherwise, this was absolutely delicious and even my S.O. who's anti brussel sprout absolutely loved this side dish. Thank you Christine!

I made this for Thanksgiving two years ago. It was the first time I ever attempted it and it was awesome! I Would have done it again this year too but the glaze takes such a long time to make I didn't have the time.  I will make sure I have the time to make it for Christmas this year -- the one "drawback" was the time it took to make the glaze. That was my first time ever making one though so I'll probably get quicker with it each time.  It really is a fantastic dish. Possibly the best vegetable dish I've ever had.  Really, really good!

Very good recipe to try to spruce up, a not so fond vegetable of mine, brussel sprouts!  Even tho my husband didnt care for them, I did like this recipe on them and it made them more edible for me.  I just had to add extra sauce over the ones that I ate!  lol  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed this recipe almost exactly. My only addition was a bit of orange zest after reading the reviews.  (Added great flavor!)  I only gave it 3 stars, as the sauce just did not turn into a glaze...very thin and soupy.  Also, the pepper was extreme...and I cut it down!  Even my husband, who loves pepper, thought it was a bit much.  I wonder, is it 1 tsp. as opposed to 1 Tbsp?

I really liked the glaze created for the carrots and sprouts.  I cooked it to less than half since i knew the veggies would add a lot of water.  They did and I cooked that down some too.  It was really good

Followed the recipe but the veggies did not turn out with a true glaze and we found the flavor very disappointing.  I will not try making this again.

I just made this recipe and fear it will not make it till dinner time (I keep "testing" the sprouts!).  I did a couple of minor enhancements to adjust the flavor to my taste - used only a teaspoon pepper but added a "scoop" of dejon mustard and a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar when making the glaze.

I cut this recipe in half because I didn't need so many vegetables, but I forgot to halve the brown sugar.  It turned out great anyway.  It did take much longer to acheive the glaze consistency - about 30 minutes of simmering uncovered.  Judging by some of the other reviews, this might have been needed regardless of whether I had used 1/6 cup of brown sugar or not.  I did cut the Brussels sprouts in half, but that likely wasn't necessary given the cooking time.  I also heeded the other reviewers' ideas, and ran the vegetables through the microwave to soften them a little.  I used care not to dump any extra water in when I transferred them to the cooking pot.  Like the other reviewers, I found that signficantly less pepper was needed - for one pound of Brussels sprouts and one pound of baby carrots, I used only 1/2 teaspoon of finely ground black pepper, and it had just the right bite for us.  I think maybe the recipe needs a little more brown sugar than is called for if you are using the full four pounds of vegetables.  I plan to make this as a full recipe at Thanksgiving for a side dish, and I will definitely add 2/3 cup of brown sugar, not just 1/3.

The recipe was great. I made it to bring to Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't have any left overs to take home. Even people who claimed not to like brussel sprouts were complimenting me on this dish. I will definately make this again.

YUM. I forgot to add the pepper, which was probably a good idea. I was in a hurry to dress up a ton of carrots and brussel sprouts. This was perfect. I threw mine in the oven for about a 1/2 hour on warm as we were preparing other things, which made the sauce more of a glaze. Not too sweet.

I'm usually partial to roasting my brussels sprouts, but now this recipe is at the top of my list.  I followed the steam for 10/ saute for 15 suggestion, and I reduced the pepper by 1/3 and it was perfect!

Made a few hours beforehand for Christmas eve and kept warm on back of stove.  Looked fine at first, but it ended up being very liquidy after a few hours like it was swimming in butter so didn't look appetizing.  Had even added extra handful of brown sugar because it looked too buttery when making the sauce originally.  Tasted fine, but I thought the sauce would be much thicker.

My husaband could not stop telling me how awesome these were.  Both my 5 year old and 3 year old loved them.  The taste is so gourmet restaurant quality but so easy to do.  I used homemade veggie stock.

This recipe is simple and tastes wonderful.  I served it at a church function and even the kids would eat their sprouts.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a smashing success, the bowl was the first one gone. This recipe does a great job of enhancing the flavor of these veggies, without overpowering them. Mildly sweet and yet savory as well, these recipe I plan to make throughout the year.

This was really good.  I could have cooked the brussel sprouts longer.  The carrots turned out perfectly and were most delicious!  This dish looked very nice and colorful on the table.  Thanks for the recipe.  It was a winner at Thanksgiving and I will make again for Christmas.

Wonderful recipe.  I used frozen baby brussel sprouts and even my two year old liked them!  My husband likes really sweet carrots so next time I may add more brown sugar.  Enjoy!

Remember to ALWAYS TRY FIRST a new recipe before presenting it to anyone who will not appreciate your effort to try new things...My sister did not care for this at all, and she loves sprouts! I, on the other hand, only like them and I think this is a keeper!! To each his own ;)

I loved this dish! I did what another reviewer did and cooked the veggies in the microwave first, then transferred the carrots and sprouts to an oven proof bowl, poured the glaze over top, put the lid on and heated it in the oven while I prepared the rest of the meal. I'm not a huge fan of brussel sprouts but these are delicious.Very quick and easy.

I made this dish for several Christmas dinners.  This year I didn't, a few people were upset.  It appeals to even non-brussel sprout eaters.

Over all this was a great recipe. The only thing I change when I make it is the amount of pepper. There was just way too much pepper for me.

I have tried this recipe twice. The first time, I think I boiled the brussel sprouts for too long. The second time, I didn't do it long enough. The first time tasted better, but they were both super yummy each time. Tastes like candy vegetables.

I've made this recipe several times, with and without the Brussels Sprouts.  I just add extra carrots if I don't have the Sprouts. It's my favorite way to eat these veggies.  These are DELICIOUS & my family loves them, too!

I really liked this recipe although it was difficult to do. I would definetly use the smallest brussel sprouts you can find as others had suggested. The ones i already had were larger and they took a lot longer to cook. I will definetly try it again though with smaller sprouts.

Yummy!  A nice way to have brussel sprouts.  I agree that volume of chicken stock can be reduced.  The sauce takes much longer than 7 minutes to reduce.

I love brussel sprouts any way you cook them, but it was nice to find something a bit different. I opted not to add the baby carrots so really I am rating only  the sprouts.Some reviewers said there was too much pepper, obviously that is a personal opinion as I was tempted to add even more next time. It is important if you have cut the sprouts up to drain them well before adding to glaze. Leaving them whole reduces the amount of water that they collect, but they then would need a longer cooking time. I did not put them in a ice bath either since I was cooking them just before serving. 
I will be making these again.

This recipe is incredible. I don't have to ask what kind of green vegetable my husband would like with dinner anymore, the answer is always brussels sprouts. We will add the carrots when we serve it for Thanksgiving. This is a new family favorite.

It's not the recipe's fault; I just can't seem to like brussels sprouts!  Also, the glaze didn't thicken until I added corn starch.  The carrots were good tho.  Maybe I'll try it with more likable veggies

This side dish was a success.  I added fresh button mushrooms along with the sprouts and carrots.  Most of the guests said they would have preferred just the sprouts and mushrooms - so I'm going to try that next time.  The glaze was very nice - not too sweet or heavy.  I've been asked to make this for the next family event and I will happily - it's so easy and quick.

Made it twice to be fair, first time was as written and forgot to score the sprouts so they were hard in the middle. Not impressed with the way they glazed up. Second time I added brown sugar, cooked it for ten minutes and the results were much better. I also added some crushed fresh garlic (two cloves) and that I believe helped with the flavor. will make again.

Loved making this for Thanksgiving.  Just delicious with just the right amount of flavors so that the true taste of the veggies came through.  I really liked balancing the veggies the day before and having the glaze ready on the stove top for when the time was right. The veggies were cooked to perfection and everyone enjoyed them.  Thank you for this great recipe.

As is 3 stars,  with few changes 5 stars.  Up brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Use only 1 tsp black pepper.  Thicken sauce with a little mix of cornstarch and water.  If you like bacon add 1/2 a 2.5 oz bag of bacon pieces.  I couldn't stop eating this!

This had excellent flavour! I steamed the veggies first, made the glaze while they were steaming and then put In a crockpot to keep cooking and stay warm....yummy

I was looking for something different to do with common veggies that my family would like. This recipe is easy and tastes very good. The fam is not a huge fan of brussels sprouts, but I really like them and green beans and broccoli are getting so repetitive. I will put this in my regular rotation since I didn't hear any major complaints from the teenagers and they both did eat them.

This recipe is needlessly complicated, so I read the other reviews first and simplified the process.  Great flavor though.

Very good!  I didn't do it w/ brussel sprouts...didn't have any.  I turned the heat up to boil the liquid away and the carrots turned out perfect!  We will see what the kids think!

These were awesome!  I left out the brussels sprouts because I didn't have any on hand so there was extra glaze which I saved for later use.  Great recipe-friends loved it!

This is an excellent recipe.  My boyfriend is so picky and he even gobbled it up.  This was made for both Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  The only change I made was that the pepper was too strong so I lessened the amount.  Everything else was the same.

This wasn't anything special. I too halved the recipe. i kept adding more brown suagar to get a better glaze but it never did glaze. This recipe didn't go over very well for Christmas Dinner. Not enough flavor.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and I'm not sure if it's just my taste but I didn't like it.  And it didn't really glaze.  Not sure if it was something I did or not but I won't be making this again.

I reduced the pepper to 1 tsp and it was still too much.Overall it lacked flavour I found the sprouts to be undercooked. No one ate it at our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. I was quite embarassed that I brought it. I think it worked for some because they did so much tweaking to make it work.

The recipe is great. If you like a pinch of ginger gives it a little more flavor. My family loved it.

I made this a few times and it never thickened, the glaze was always an oily looking water I had to drain it. Tastet, maybe a bit sweet, but very easy to make. I sub'd. for veggie broth and it turned out the same, so vegetarians have found a safe side dish.

This was delicious!  We are pepper lovers, so we didn't think it was too strong, but it would be very good even if you reduced the pepper.

Made this last christmas, beautiful presentation so much color to add to the table. I am only giving it 3 stars because of the pepper, it was overwhelming. I must add though that I could taste the potential this recipe has and am so confident in it that I am making them again this Christmas of course with much less pepper. I believe it will be a five star.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't even know you could glaze brussel sprouts before, but they came out great!  So pretty too! We will definitely be having this again.

Very good Holiday side dish. Easy to prepare.  I actually used frozen baby brussel sprouts, and they worked fine.

We thought this was good.  I took the advice of one reviewer to save a little time.  I threw the carrots and brussel sprouts in the steamer while I started the sauce.  After about 10 minutes I added them into the sauce.  The brussel sprouts actually needed a little more time as they were a bit on the crunchy side, but still good.  Oh, and I added fresh sliced mushrooms just because I had some on hand that needed to be used.  They were great in this!  I put them in the steamer the last 3 to 5 minutes or so, then into the sauce with everything else.  Carol

I followed this recipe to the tee and somehow I messed it up.  They were very watery and never did get a glaze or a sauce on them.
