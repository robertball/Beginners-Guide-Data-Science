A big mess.  There isn't enough chocolate to cover the rice crispies.  Just like the last reviewer said, it didn't stay together.  Maybe there is a typo in the recipe???

Certainly a waste of good Rice Crispies and perfectly good chocolate!!!
It's not nasty, it just doesn't seem to work.
There must be some other "binding ingredient" that was omitted ...

This recipe did not turn out well.  The rice crispy pieces didn't stay together and didn't stick to the crust.  It was quite a mess and I didn't even serve it.  It was quick and easy but that's all!

This recipe is missing some butter. If you add the binder you will have a good recipe.

I am living in the UK this year, and Rice Krispie Cakes are a VERY popular treat.  The recipe calls for the addition of 1 or 2 oz butter and 2-3 Tbs golden syrup (which is similar to runny honey or perhaps Aunt Jemima).  The quantities vary somewhat in the recipes I've seen.  Corn flakes also work well in place of the Rice Krispies.  I've seen these topped with little candies.  It's really easy if you modify the recipe and usually a hit.

I used more chocolate based on the other comments and these turned out pretty well, but didn't want to stick together at first.  I think they'd be tastier with some peanut butter in them, or maybe some marshmallow fluff to bind them together a bit.  They'd be good crumbled over ice cream as they are though.

I have made this a couple times and loved it.  It is quick and I change the ice cream flavor in the middle to fit the event or time of year.  You just need to be sure and freeze the chocolate/cripy's in a pie pan or spring form for at least 10 minutes, then add the ice cream and freeze for a couple hours more. Also, I increase the chocolate to around 8 oz. of chocolate chips.

I just came across this recipe while looking for recipes for hamburger pie.I read the reviews on it and saw that the reviewers said that maybe there was an ingredient missing.Perhaps it's butter or marshmallows since that is what you put in original rice krispy treats.Who knows?It's worth a try.
