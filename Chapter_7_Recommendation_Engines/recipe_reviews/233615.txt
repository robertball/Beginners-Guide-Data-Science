The recipe came out great on the first try. I used the pickled jalapenio slices instead of fresh which worked great. Next time I will add some cumin and use only 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.

I made this recipe as written (besides a little onion powder) and made 4 big patties. It had a great crunch on the outside and great flavor. I could see making it again, because it wasn't hard to make & healthy.

Used a white sweet potato, omitted egg, added 1 cup shaved carrots, followed others advice to make the burgers smaller and at least 15 min at 400 2nd turn. Really good.
Ed- MW instead of bake for 7 minutes- if your dinner times are liked ours- chopped kitchen.

I made sweet potatoes and pinto bean burgers with chili powder. They were delicious.

They were awesome little burgers..I boiled the sweet potato because I wanted to make it faster, I was hungry :). I added bit of cumin, coriander,curry, marjoram, pepper.  And served with curry sauce. Yum Yum..

I doubled this recipe and made regular size burgers.  I will make 1/2 size burgers next time because it took way longer to cook.  We thought the taste was terrific even my 13 year old ate it!

I liked this.. with the addition of some spicy salt. It needed some seasoning for my tastes.. otherwise it was too sweet. I made in regular sized burgers and they are pretty delicate when they are larger.. so keeping them small is the best idea
