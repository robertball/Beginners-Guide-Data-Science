FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!! after using at least 4 different recipes for these squares, this one is the only one that worked!! I did make sure I read all reviews first for this any other same type recipe. 
After reading I did a couple different things, I didn't have almond so used same amount of extra flour, poked holes in base before baking, came out fine. I did use non stick paper with non stick spray so it would come out of pan. I let the base get stone cold before adding caramel. I did boil caramel center for the full 7 minutes and yes I got the brown flecks in it, but you couldn't notice on the end product. Still not sure it would take I poured it on the base, let it sit in fridge for 30 mins or so then went directly to freezer until stone cold. The top I used half semi chips and half milk chocolate and added tbsp of crisco to make top shiny. As caramel was very cold, chocolate started to harden almost immediatly..which was great, b/c I then was able to score the chocolate at that time. Put it back in fridge, couple hours later, it removed from pan, cut along score lines, no broken chocolate, base was fine and didn't fall apart....yummy....I love these aquares and have finally found a recipe that works.

I have made this recipe every year now for 3 years and each year I'm asked to share it.   I've made one change - I substitute brown sugar (lightly packed) for the white sugar, which I feel gives it more of a caramel flavor. I haven't had any problems with the caramel setting up, but I do  cook it for the full 7 minutes suggested.  I use light corn syrup in place of the golden syrup.

As is, the recipe is a 4-star, but I think it can be made into a 5-star.  Other reviewers didn't mention having any trouble with an excess pool of butter forming after the caramel was cooked, but I sure did; I drained at least 1/4c of butter from the caramel before spreading it on my shortbread crust; otherwise, I would have had a mushy crust, and the gooey caramel that some complained of.  I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the topping as I had no milk chocolate in the house; even though I'm a bigger fan of semi-sweet, I think milk chocolate may be better with this so it doesn't mask the flavor of the caramel so much; next time, I would definitely sub brown sugar for white in the caramel mixture to further bring out the flavor.  Also, I had to cook the caramel mixture much longer than 5-7 minutes; it was more like 20-25 minutes to get it to the nice golden color I was looking for. This may have been because I had to use light corn syrup as it was all I had. This recipe does take some time; to speed things along, I put the shortbread in the freezer for 20-30 minutes to help with the cooling process, and again to help cool and firm up the caramel, and again to harden the chocolate top. Love the combo of shortbread, caramel, and chocolate; it is somewhat like a Twix bar!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Mary!

I have two problems with this recipe: the shortbread crumbles when you try to cut it, and the carmel is waaay too sweet. It smelled great on the stove until I added the sweetend condensed milk and it just ruined it. I used brown sugar as other suggested which really gave it a carmel smell, but again the condensed milk just made the carmel mixture gross. If for some reason I tried this again I would find something other than the condensed milk and use another shortbread recipe. Great idea, and it set up well but just way too sweet. I'll stick to the Twix bar.

I've made this recipe several times over the past few years and have had tasty success each time :) 
Be sure to beat the crumb mixture for a long time before pressing into the pan and doing the fork-holes
I also use a larger pan, I htink it's a 9x13 (glass rectangle) and that's the best change I've done. It allows each layer to be thinner so everything is less prone to crumbling but still oh so delish ;) I also cut them into teeny tiny squares, use high quality milk chocolate bar for half the pan and dark or semi-sweet with coarse sea-salt sprinkled on top for the other half. Both variations get rave reviews and I always end up making another batch before the holidays are over. (Have one baking up this moment). Give 'er a try, it's great!

Fantastic!! My sister calls these "Fake Twix bars". I've made this recipe a couple of different ways including the original and every batch got rave reviews. If you do not have ground almonds, you can substitute 1/4 cup additional flour. It's not as tasty but it still turns out delicious. Also, here in the States it might be hard to find Lyle's Golden Syrup so you can substitute light corn syrup if need be. Again, not as good but most everyone won't notice a difference. On another batch I added 1/2 tsp. of salt to the caramel mixture so there's more of a sweet/salty taste to these and they came out terrific. Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!  YUM!  YUM!  I made these last night and they are WONDERFUL.  I'm having a hard time trying to save them for Christmas guests and not eat it all myself.  I have NO IDEA what golden syrup is, so I just decided to wing it and substitute light corn syrup . . . and the finished product is great!  Reminds me a lot of a Twix bar.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is a pleasant surprise to find that it doesn't end up sickly sweet. I made this for a function at work and everyone wanted the recipe. Needless to say there wasn't a crumb left. This is a keeper!

thanks to the person who suggested brown sugar instead of white.  i cooked the shortbread a little too long by accident, but it turned out great because instead of twix bars, they're like skor bars (the cookie part is crunchy, not the caramel).  didn't have corn or golden syrup, so i substituted honey for it. worked well. thanks for the recipe!

I agree with the other reviews that the shortbread was a bit too crumbly. If I were to make it again, I would use more butter. Also, the caramel sauce would be difficult for a beginning cook. When making it, be sure to use a heavy duty stainless steel pan, nothing non stick. Despite those issues, the bars did have good flavor.

these are really awesome.  to ensure a good crust USE REAL BUTTER.  trust me it helps and you dont need to butter your pan.  make sure when you put the dough in the pan you poke holes all over it with a fork. and make sure each layers is cooled completely before adding the next layer.  I didnt have light corn syup so I used golden syrup and its turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe

I grew up in Scotland where this is a staple in just about every small store, large stores, coffee shops, gas stations, really pretty much everywhere. This is very authentic. You have to refrigerate a little before cutting it into squares. Use cadbury's milk chocolate as the Scots do. Someone mentioned the golden syrup called for in the recipe. It is made by Tate and Lyle and comes in a can. You can buy it from a store that sells British foods and you can buy it from Amazon. In a pinch you can substitute corn syrup but to this Glasgow palate, there is a difference. Someone mentioned that they're too sweet. Bite your tongue! Nothing is too sweet in Scotland.

Really good.  I also have trouble with things like caramel, but the cooking time stated was perfect on medium heat.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and agree that milk chocolate would have allowed the caramel flavor to emerge more.  My only other piece of advice is that after chilling to set the chocolate and cutting into squares (not easy because the chocolate and caramel are VERY firm when chilled) you should let them sit at room temperature for a few hours to soften them up a little--in fact, next time I will probably also wait until then to even cut them into squares.

This was delish! I decided to make individual tarts. I pressed the dough into muffin tins and made a little rim up the side. It only took about 10 minutes to brown. Used dark brown sugar in the carmel. Spooned about a tablespoon slightly cooled carmel into each tart, then droozled melted semisweet chocolate over the tart with a pastry bag. In order to get a good consistency on the chocolate, I melted it in the microwave, then added a little butter, milk and powdered sugar.

I was recently craving coconut twix which I can't find in the stores anymore. So I thought I would try this recipe with a little bit of a twist. I put coconut in the shortbread instead of almonds. THen I also added coconut extract to the caramel after I removed it from the heat. Once it was completely cooled (used the freezer), I cut them in rectangular bars and coated them with chocolate. They were so delicious if you love coconut, which I do! A note on the caramel, i did get quite a bit of excess butter that I tried to take out of the caramel. Also, the bars were a bit thick for my tasted so I would probably used a 9x13 pan if I make this again.

WOW this is the best thing I have ever tasted!  I would give it more stars if I could!!!!!!  All my children LOVED it and so did my picky mother-in-law.  I did use kayro syrup as another reviewer said and I also omited the nuts.  But it was just  AMAZING even with the changes.    Thanks for the recipe.

was searching for something close to what i grew up with in scotland.  it was close but not exact.  this recipe is quite sweet but good! but the carmel didn't settle all the way, so it was quite gooey.  for those of you who don't know what GOLDEN SYRUP is, it's a sweet syrup used for cooking.  can be found in the international isle of your grocers if they carry items from the UK.  might also be available to order online?  you will need this to complete the recipe though.

It did taste similar to a Twix bar, but the caramel just didn't set like I had hoped.  It was delicious but very gooey...so gooey that it was messy.  The plus is that my friends raved when they tried it.

This recipe was far too sweet for my family's taste, and it took too long to finish  (waiting for the shortbread to cool, waiting for the "caramel" to condense).  Also, I was hoping for more of a caramel taste, but it really tasted too much like butterscotch.

Caramel is my nemesis, and it did crystallize a bit, but the bars still turned out excellently.  A great treat!

relly sinful but curiously comforting, it posts you back to the time when we were kids...the caramel didn't get thik enough but we did appreciate it just the same.
quite delicious indeed!

This is so rich and delicious. The recipe is easy to make, but watch the caramel because is can stick to the pan while cooking. I am going to put a heavier nut topping and powdered sugar on top to reduce the stickiness so I can cut and put in cupcake papers for guests and gifts.

To anyone complaining that this recipe is too sweet........ something must be wrong with your tastebuds.  Despite the fact that I am Scottish, these are far less sweet than factory made cookies. 
And if you're complaining about the recipe in general after you've altered it....... something is just plain wrong with you. 
This is absolutely perfect.  The cookie is fantastic, light, airy, buttery and crispy.  The caramel is great. The hint of almond and caramel together is heaven. 
If there is something wrong with your result..... then something is wrong with your process.

These are a devine wee sweet treat! I mixed it up a little and done a cookie base and topping and everyone loved it! I would consider putting a thin layer of chocolate on top, but otherwise amazing! Thumbs up !

The listing of ingredients is very confusing, fortunately I have made shortbread frequently. This is called millionaires shortbread, without all the nuts.

I keep this recipe a secret from everyone, and nobody understands why it is better than any they've ever had. I leave out the almonds on top, and sometimes just use a basic shortbread crust without ground almonds, but whichever way I make it, I have friends and relatives queuing at my door for a square!  Gorgeous.
