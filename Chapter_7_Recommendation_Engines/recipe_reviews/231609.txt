So these aren't too bad, but I didn't really taste much extra flavor--I used Nathan's hot dogs, which have a really distinctive flavor, so maybe that's my problem.  I also think I'd prefer a bit more beer--1 bottle didn't really cover the hot dogs--to flavor, so I think I might try these again in a smaller pan or in a slow cooker to allow for the flavors to meld longer.  Definitely an interesting idea, though.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a St Patrick's Day party last night and it was a huge hit with everyone! Nice flavour, smelled wonderful cooking, and overall fantastic! I will definitely make these again.
