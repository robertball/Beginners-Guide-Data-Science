This is very good and fairly quick.  I don't use the Cheddar cheese though.  Cook the pasta, drain and set aside. Chop the garlic and slice the zucchini.  Saute just until slightly tender but still has a little crunch.  Add the sauce and a toss to heat through.  Toss in a handful of chopped fresh basil and a grind or two of fresh black pepper.  Serve over pasta.

I made this today for lunch and my husband and I both really liked it.  I think it could be modified to be even better though, depending on your tastes.  I would add onions, mushrooms, and diced tomatoes.  We also made this using an alfredo sauce recipe from this website as well that was delicious.  I don't typically like store bought alfredo sauce, so I don't buy it.  Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as stated.  Some other things I would change is drain the zucchini before adding to the garlic and oil mixture.  Just small changes that would enhance this recipe, but really it is good as is.

This is great, I only changed one thing I added more garlic because we love that stuff. Wonderful recipe and so quick and easy. I made a double batch and served it to my neighbors while watching the NYG/Chicago game, they all loved it. With a nice glass of your favorite wine, wonderful.

This was yummy. Made as posted but added 3 more cloves of garlic. The only issue was that it needed more flavor. Had to add more pepper,  and parmesan was delicious addition.

very good I served with grilled chicken breast on top . Used homemade Alfredo sauce, and homemade pasta. Lill less cheddar only because after what goes into the alfredo sauce you feel like you are trying to kill your family.  Everyone raved about it !

This was good! I did add sauteed chicken breast to it and made my own alfredo sauce though. Everyone really liked it. Also added red pepper flakes for garnish.

This was super simple and easy.  The hardest part was shredding the zucchini.  This is wonderful for an easy, simple and fast dinner.  Thank You for sharing.

Wonderful way to use excess zucchini which I love!!
Made 1/2 as stated and the other 1/2 substituting homemade alfredo sauce and no cheddar. It was good as stated but delish with subs. I still gave it 5 stars because I would never have thought to add zucchini. Thanks for the recipe!

A quick and easy weeknight recipe. It tasted really good, my entire family of picky eaters ate it! I added mushrooms, and nobody guessed that it had zucchini in it!

I liked this recipe quite a lot, though it needed a generous amount of cracked peppercorn and grated parmesan cheese to avoid a certain blandness. Grating the zucchini is a great idea - it adds sweetness to the creamy sauce, and my toddler doesn't know it's there! I love any recipe that contains veggies and that my daughter loves, as it's a rarity. Thanks!

Made a few adjustments however I don't think that takes away from the stars. 
I added two chicken breasts to the sauce (fully cooked and cut bite size)
Mushrooms, parmesan cheese instead of cheddar, a whole jar 16 oz of Alfredo sauce. I think the 2 Lbs of zucchini is a lot, but it did taste fantastic. 

Next time I'll reduce the zucchini and add a cup of parmesan cheese. Really great dish, so easy and my picky eater loved it.

I love this recipe! I make it as is, but use rotini pasta. The only thing I can't figure out is how to get the zucchini to not clump together.

Made this in the morning, took it as first dinner for family camp out.  Thought I made it for just my family but everyone ate it!  It is DELICIOUS! So creamy! Garden fresh zucc's make it so tasty.
