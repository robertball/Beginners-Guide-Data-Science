These were very tasty. I don't know if I'd make them again, though. The middle is very doughy. I tried putting it back in the oven but it just got doughier! My family called it "ginger bread pudding"! It does have a great flavor though, perfect for this time of the year. :)

I've made these a few times, and they are a hit with everybody who has tried them. I do end up doubling the spices, but other than that, this recipe is great! Followed the directions exactly on mixing and baking, they turn out just fine.

My kids are big Wiggles fans and wanted to make "Crunchy Munchy Honeycakes," so we gave this recipe a try.  Of course, they were more like "chewy gooey honeycakes."  I just didn't enjoy the texture, which I felt was undercooked.  The flavor was just the right mix of honey and spices, but far too sweet.  Perhaps less granulated sugar and more cooking time?  I don't know if we'll try this recipe again, especially since it makes so much (tight fit in the mixing bowl!) and is difficult to halve.

Our family loved it!  I ended up cooking it in 1 large pan which took around 40-50 minutes.  It was done when nothing stuck to a toothpick placed in the center.  They were chewy.  Also, I decided to go ahead and frost the cakes while they were still in the pan and it turned out fine.

These were delicious!  After reading the reviews I knew I had to bake them a bit longer and they were firm except for a bit in the middle and it was sorta gooey but really good!!  Just bake a little longer and they turn out great!!  My hubby loved them and I made homemade cream cheese frsoting.  Will definately make again!

This was very gloppy and messy. No one in my family liked it. I will not make this again.
