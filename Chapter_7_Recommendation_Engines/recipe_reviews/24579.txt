Great for a Sunday breakfast! I didn't use 1/4 cup of olive oil though - about half of that as I use a non-stick pan. This combination of veggies is great, all I added was a little minced garlic. This was perfect with a side of bacon and whole grain toast!

Of course most of us know how to make scrambled eggs as one reviewer correctly pointed out BUT we often forget delicious veggie combinations that are yummy with scrambled eggs.  Recipes often jog our memories.  Thanks for jogging mine!

Old, I mean experienced, cooks like me don't need a recipe for something like this, but I'm sure they'll agree with me that when you're brain dead and don't know what to make a recipe like this is great for an "aha!" moment of inspiration.  Novice or beginner cooks will appreciate this recipe as it is so ideal and instructional.  Good for you and good tasting too, packed with healthy carbs, protein, dairy and a little fat, you know you're doing your body good.  I made only one real change to the recipe...I use olive oil for just about everything, but never with eggs so I used butter instead.   I added salt and pepper, didn't measure anything precisely, and used a colorful mix of orange, yellow, green and red bell peppers.  I served this with "Crispy Mashed Potato Pancake," also from this site.

Ooooh, what a great way to start the day.  I used butter instead of oil & served this wrapped in warm tortillas.  When I'm in a pinch for time, I use salsa (chunky works best), delicious!  Thanks Eiore!

I cut this down to two servings, used one full egg and one egg white, and increased the veggies. I used 2% sharp cheddar and added some fresh minced garlic. Very good.

I grew up on a similar recipe that my mom made for the family.  Tomatoes, onions, eggs, salt, pepper and browned ground beef.  She served it with pita bread. Today I am a grandma and continue to make this for my family just changing ingredients for their preferences or what I have on hand.  Although I am a seasoned cook (not chef) I continue to appreciate the basic recipe postings that others offer.  Not so much that I may need them but for the wonderful creativeness that reviewers offer to share with all of us.  Thanks to all of you amazing cooks (beginners to experts) out there and never think a recipe posted is too basic.

Very tasty.  I tried it out of curiosity, since it is similar to a recipe that I use for scrambled eggs.  However, next time, I will revert to my standard recipe, which does not include milk and differs in several other significant ways.  I know that many use milk in scrambled eggs, but I prefer mine less fluffy.  I also use avocado, which I feel makes a major contribution, and I often use more tomato, which makes it a bit more like one of the staple tomato and egg dishes served regularly in many parts of China.  I also replace roughly half of the eggs with tofu, which makes it much more healthful, both because of the health benefits of tofu and the reduction in cholesterol.  I also add spinach, which I buy fresh but freeze for later cooking when it starts to deteriorate.  Unlike others who have reviewed this dish, I prefer olive oil for cooking eggs (even for fried eggs), both for taste and health reasons.  I used to use butter (and even bacon drippings before that), but olive oil is far more healthful.  I usually use sharp cheddar cheese, but next time, I will try feta, as another reviewer suggested. Fresh cilantro is also a nice addition, and if you add cumin, it makes a tasty breakfast wrap (in a flour tortilla).  For wraps, you can add shrimp or sausage for extra flavor.

I agree with many of the comments here. What a wonderful memory jog to inspire me for this morning's breakfast. I had everything in my refrigerator; even made this type of breakfast before, just wasn't thinking about it. Thanks for the inspiration. By the way, I did use butter instead of olive oil, my preference for eggs.

These were great eggs!  The ONLY change I made was to leave out the tomato...tomato and eggs don't sit well with my family.  Other than that, AWESOME!

I made this for breakfast this morning along with a smoothie and boy what a start to my day.  I too wrapped this up in a warm tortilla. I left out the milk and mushrooms since I'm not a fungus person. I have some left over (since my hubby isn't a big breakfast fan) and I'm eating this again in the morning.

Yum!  I'm daunted by the idea of an omelet, so this is a great alternative.  I did add salt, as one person suggested.  It's great with salsa or this vietnamese chili sauce we have.

I haven't made this recipe, but I do make one very similar. Saute onions, garlic, tomatoes, celery, zuccini, mushrooms, bell pepper, (optional) add a sliced low-fat turkey hotdog... then mix in three egg whites, salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. No need for cheese or milk. Very healthy and filling.

I love weekends when I can take the time to make a breakfast like this. I first cook my veggies until my desired tenderness and then add my tomatoes and pour the egg mixture over it all. I put the lid on to let my eggs harden a bit before stirring, over med/low heat. Then gently use the spatula to gently fold over the eggs. Placing the lid back on to help hold the heat in and cook the eggs. This way you don't get a globby mess of eggs from too much stirring. Top with any cheese you like and serve once cheese melts. If no tomatoes, top with some salsa or hot sauce.

My family loves this.  We have found we prefer to saute the veggies in Smart Balance rather than oil.  We also like to crumble some pre-cooked bacon into the mix and always add some sea salt and black pepper.  We have found we like the tomatoes and cheese added in the last couple of minutes and leave them on top of the eggs rather than mixing them in.

Try it with spinach and feta instead of cheddar. I also used a cooking spray instead of the oil and removed three of the egg yolks for a lower cal version.

I make this all the time on the weekends. I always have those ingredients on hand. I wouldn't have thought to write a recipe out for it. I do though cook the vegetables on medium unless you want them brown keeping the temperature the same when adding the eggs. It doesn't need quite so much oil either. I learned years ago to add ice cold water instead of milk. It makes the eggs fluffy every time. It's a great way to use up small amounts of leftover vegetables.

I leave out the chopped tomatoes and add Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles or any left over ham or smoked sausage I may have and a bit of minced garlic. 1/4 cup of Olive oil does sound like a bit much though,I just add a drizzle to the pan!

This was a great way to incorporate all the fresh veggies I had in my refrigerator. I added in a little red and yellow bell pepper and 1 garlic clove, minced. I seasoned the eggs with hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. Very tasty and filled me up. This was a healthy way to start my morning. I ate this with, "Crispy Potato Pancakes," which can be found here on this website.

I havent made this recipe but I do one very similiar to this.  I use olive oil and also a couple pats of butter melted together.  I saute onion and green or yellow pepper together and add real bacon bits to it.  Sometimes if I have turkey breakfast sausage patties I will crumble them up and add to this. I  season with sea salt, cracked pepper and a little garlic powder.  When onions are translucent I add the eggs and cook until set.  Then top it with shredded cheddar cheese and allow to melt before serving.  My favorite way to eat eggs!

These were about the best scrambled eggs I have ever cooked.  I used butter in place of oil and omitted the green pepper, using red instead and I added some green onion I wanted to use up.  Along with a salad it made a nice light supper.  Thanks, Eiore!

I have done a similar recipe many times, but I do Mozzeralla cheese and I add it to the eggs and milk then add it to all the veggies.  It makes it nice and fluffy.  Great Sunday morning meal.

Well, I am an old quite experienced cook and I really loved this! I've made many an omellete, but other than adding cottage cheese I've never been very adventurous with scrambled eggs! Thank you for a wonderfully inspired idea. I loved the flavours, and had it for lunch :)

Great recipe. My own scrambled egg recipe(s) evolved over the years from a western omelette, when I was a newlywed. These days, I mostly use green pepper, onion, & Cheddar cheese; some times salsa & cheese, or even just chives. It's all good. Some folks need to lighten up. The dissed person probably is a chef, but I felt he was referring to himself, as much as other people.

Wow! This recipe brought back memories of my father teaching his 10 yr old daughter how to make this recipe 50 years ago. It has always been a favorite of mine. The only difference is he used butter instead of olive oil. Today, I use less butter and more than just mushrooms, bell peppers, onion, and tomato and just a hint of salt. My motto is "Whatever veggie is sitting in my fridge is likely to be tossed in this recipe." Avocado blends in very well.

Dad also made a Bacon, Tomato, Onion Scrambled Egg version.  It was another favorite of mine.

I have been making scrambled eggs like this for years. I do not use olive oil, but do use just enough Country Crock margarine to cook the veggies. I do not like tomatoes with eggs, so I don't use them. Don't skip the milk as it makes the eggs flufflier, and I add a sprinkling of Italian seasoning, minced garlic, and fresh ground pepper. Hubby uses hot sauce. I use 2 eggs per person. Shredded Mexican cheese is also a nice option.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, but it turned out great and I just thought I'd share :) I cut out the oil, using a couple sprays of nonstick cooking spray instead. I left the onions in rings instead of chopping them finely, and used red pepper instead of green, and broccoli instead of mushrooms. I didn't have any tomatoes, so I skipped them, and used water instead of milk. I also forgot to put the cheese on (dumb me!) They were so yummy; and the cheese would probably only make them even yummier! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This made a great breakfast with Wheat Germ Whole-Wheat Buttermilk Pancakes and Fresh Fruit with Poppy Seed Dressing (recipes from this site).  I tossed out a few egg yolks and add some Old Bay seasoning.  Very tasty!

YEAH! This was really good!  I did substitute salsa for the tomatoes since I happened to not have any.. otherwise, I followed the recipe just as it is..and it turned out great! I also used canned mushrooms not fresh ones. Worked fine. I did not have tortillas either as others suggested, but it was just wonderful eating it as regular scrambled eggs...served with buttered toast. Will make this again for sure. Oh - and my 22 month old loved them as well! She had two helpings! Impressive..

I always thought my scrambled eggs were missing something. Maybe it was the fluffy texture or even the taste of the vegetables.
This recipe changed all that. It's definitely something I would ask my sister to make again! Great for a family breakfast! Yum!

I always  peel and dice a small potato, saute that first, then add the veggies one at a time. At the end I add torn baby spinach or baby Kale, then my eggs which include about 1tbsp milk per egg, and finally melt in 1 slice of American or provolone cheese per egg. Creamy and delicious, and still full of veggies!

I make a twist on this at least once a week. I add more veggies. I put in chopped celery leaves and shredded zucchini and try to use different colored bell peppers, and I use green onion tops. Top with a little cheese and wrap in a warm tortilla or just pit on a plate. A good way to get a serving of vegetables. I also use cooking spray with just a wee bit of butter for flavor to cook the veggies.

This is just a basic recipe that is more common than unique.  If you make it once as written, you will most likely come up with your variation that suits your taste.

A great recipe for beginning cooks. Quick, easy and flavorful. No knocking off stars for such a simple recipe because these eggs are great. I sprayed a non-stick pan with olive oil and cooked as directed.

Mmmm. This is just a scrambled omelet :) I used a red bell pepper instead of green because it's what I had. It made a fabulous entree for breakfast for dinner night.

I have been experimenting with simplier versions of this and enjoyed the results. 
One omelet I do uses just fresh muchrooms plus smoked okra -- smoked the evening before over charcoal (in a dog-feeding pay with holes punched in the bottom). 
You didn't mention folding the omelet.
My system is to not mix the 'stuffing' into the egg but add it to one half of the top of a two- or three-egg (plus a little milk) mix when it's just starting to set up. This makes folding, after a couple of minutes over medium heat, very easy. I then cut the omelet in half to form two triangles, one for each of a couple of people.
BTW, like many other reviewers, I use olive oil for nearly everything. (I buy it by the gallon, then pour it into recycled quart- or litre-sized o. oil bottles.) Much as I like the taste of butter with omelets, I find it much easier to control the oil -- to keep it from getting too hot or burning, as butter tends to do if the heat's too high.
One other thing: Asthetically, I'd rather stay away from packaged shredded cheese, but the convenience it affords wins me over, as it does you.

This sounds wonderful.  I prefer green onions with eggs, and since I only have Almond Milk (awful with eggs) I have been using sour cream as my addition to make the eggs fluffier.

This recipe is what my parents brought back from California to the east coast in 1951.  It was called Western Omlete with just green peppers and onions and eggs. Believe me we had it quite often along with a new salad called Ceasar Salad. There was also Moscow (sp) Mules which must have falled by the wayside...........

This is one of my favorite breakfasts. I call mine leftover scramble because I use left over seasoned fried onions from dinner out the night before instead of sauted onions. I even like throwing in a bit of leftover steak.

I love this and make it often with different variations.  I like to use green peppers,  red peppers, red onions, spinach and a tad of slivered smoked almonds (the best) or pine nuts.  If I use spinach I put it in last and add maybe a TB of balsamic vineager.  I use egg beaters instead of the milk and eggs and use just enough just to ake everything stick together.  I sometimes just drop out the egg beaters all together, add shrimp or leftover grilled chicken and it makes a great wrap!

I make something similar.  1 or 2 person version uses about the same veggies (tomatoes are great if garden fresh).  Only 1-2 TBS oil, 1-2 TBS cheese, also can add favorite salsa (TBS-no more).  Serve with tortillas or mexican roll.

Thanks for sharing.  I LOVE lots of veggies in my scrambled eggs.  I make a very similar recipe with the following changes or additions: 
I use butter (instead of oil), red bell pepper, a little water tastes better to me as it seems to make the eggs fluffier -- milk makes them a bit too rubbery for my taste,  sliced green olives, salt and fresh minced garlic, and sometimes even a little fresh ground pepper.  I tend to just use whatever veggies around but the ones you used are often staples for me too!  Yummy!!!

A great simple recipe for a yummy breakfast. Next time I will probably vary the vegetables to keep it interesting.

Sounds great to wrap in soft warm tortillas!  I live in AZ, and believe me, anything you can stick inside one is appreciated!  Little ones, teens and adults alike love them.  I like the ingredients either way - might try this tomorrow and add some cooked/browned red potatoes.  You can add anything you want to your taste.  Great recipe.

I have been making this for years.  I call it a scrambled omlet.  So simple, just throw in whatever fresh veggies you have on hand.

This was so great-like other people said-it's so simple, but great to remember good flavor combinations. I added a small clove of garlic (minced) and omitted the milk and cheese (not part of the diet). So easy and tasty!

I made this while camping with my kids.  It worked beautifully in a non stick pan, over the campfire!  I've been making versions of this recipe for years, I just adjust the veggies to everyone's tastes!

This is definitely good. I like to add some fresh suated spinach as well. I also like to cook in Virgin Coconut oil and or extra virgin olive oil. As for the cheese you can switch it up to feta as well.

My husband named this Eggs Thornton, after a college roommate who made this for them for breakfasts .... 45 years ago.  You can literally clean out your refrigerator & put anything you like in it.  Great recipe!

I cooked bacon to go with these eggs so rather than using olive oil I used a bit of the bacon grease. I did not measure anything since I have been making eggs like this for as long as I can remember. The only difference is that I season my eggs with salt and pepper. You can add or subtract any veggies that you want and they will always taste great.

Nice Sunday morning treat! I only used one egg since it was just for myself, and eyeballed the additions. I used butter, green onion in place of the white, half&half for milk, skipped the green pepper, and added some minced garlic. If you're in the mood for more than just plain scrambled eggs, this is a very good way to go!

I made  recipe as  called for except for little less oil
by using   half grapeseed oil and  a tablespoon or
more butter for more flavor. I found now cooking with only stainless steel that the grapeseed oil sticks less than when I use olive oil. 
I cannot give my husband plain scrambled eggs for
a breakfast as he hates them;  but I fixed this for a dinner meal and he loved it with all the vegetables..

I liked the ratio of ingredients to the eggs. No matter what I replace the fresh tomato with (e.g. spinach, baby greens, or a mix of greens and tomatoes) as long as I keep the ratio it works out well.

About the mushrooms, with fresh mushrooms if I only quickly rinse them and paper towel blot them, the water content of the dish stays to a minimum.

I'm still new at cooking but with recipes like this one and it's scalability, I'm really enjoying it.
