If you want a super chocolate-y banana bread but you are out of cocoa powder but have chocolate pudding mix, this is the recipe for you. Personally, I was not a fan and I like chocolate, it was just too sweet and too much chocolate. My husband said it was just ok. I doubt I will be making this banana bread recipe again.
I made the recipe as written subbing applesauce for oil as suggested. I also used gluten free flour with no issues.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully. Iâ€™m not a banana fan but I had some that were going bad, so I figured I would give this a try! It is warm and gooey when it first comes out of the oven but I also have enjoyed it at room temp. Will make again!

Delicious, very chocolatey and I will make it again. I would give it five stars but as I changed it slighty because I had three bananas to use up, I don't feel I should. 
I upped the bananas, flour, salt and baking powder by 50%, I used applesauce, as suggested, instead of the oil (50% more), five large eggs, just 1 cup of dark chocolate morsels (what I had in the pantry), two packs of chocolate fudge pudding and the same amount of sugar as in the original recipe. Baked in a large loaf tin for about 90 minutes. Turned out great but next time I will try it using one pack of pudding.
