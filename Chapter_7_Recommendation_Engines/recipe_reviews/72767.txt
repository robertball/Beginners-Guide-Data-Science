wow. I cant believe I ate that. and even more, I cant believe I liked that. I think my choice of sugar free pb was helpful. it reminded me of dill pickle potato chips (which I dont know if they have in the US). next time I have a craving for chips, I will eat this freaky sandwich.

What can I say - I had to try it!  This combination worked really well.  I think the key is balance; too much of any one of the ingredients would have thrown it off, but if you don't go overboard on anything it all gets together and sings.  Reminded me a bit of bread-and-butter pickles; tangy, but sweet, and with a little bite from the onion.  I'll make this again!

I loved this recipe. I had to try it because it was so different and didn't really think I would like it all. The flavors really compliment each other.I used Claussen Sandwich Stackers and red onioin. It's standard lunch box fare now.

I had to try this because it reminded me of a sandwich that my grandfather eats all the time for breakfast which is... PB, mayo and raisens on ww toast. This was surprisingly good as is my grandpa's oldtime favorite. I think I'd like it better with no onion though.

One of my co-workers eats a peanut butter and pickle sandwich every day. He enjoys both the sandwich and grossing us out. Well, his fun is over, because I made this version (with the onion) and I love it. I used Light Miracle Whip because I don't use mayonnaise. I suggest toasting the whole wheat bread. Six pickle slices seems excessive to me; I used two "sandwich slice" pickle slices instead. The combination of flavors really is delicious!

This was a very interesting sandwich and it was a lot of fun to try.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  I like the flavor of raw onions as long as it is not very strong so I only used about half of the amount suggested.  I'll definitely make it again!

This sandwich (hold the onion) is my dad's and my favorite.  We thought we were weird for liking this concoction.  It's nice to know that we are not alone.

This sounded so weird I just had to try it.  It was amazing!  My husband thought I was crazy and asked if I was pregnant again, but after I assured him I wasn't, the curiosity got the best of him, too... and HE really liked it as well!  You just have to try it to believe it!

Thanks for this easy sandwich idea. My siblings loved them. Who would have ever thought that those five ingredients would work so well together? Anyways, this one will definitely be used often for a quick lunch. Thanks for sharing:)

Ok so - after reading the reviews I pretty much new I'd like it, as unusual as this sandwich tasted.   Husband, myself and kids all tasted it.  And as expected - it tasted good.  Flavours blend in and make a flavour of its own.  Probably won't be asked to make again though.  Fun to tell people you ate it though.

I really wanted this recipe to be great since it is such an unlikely combination.  It was surprisingly good but I doubt I'd make it again.

I gave this a three as I found it neither bad nor exciting just kinda boring. There was not a flavor in particular that stood out to me. My husband laughed when he looked inside the sandwich and gagged his way through eating it. He would have give it one star.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I read this recipe. This was a staple of mine in high school (minus the onion, though. Never have been a fan of the raw onion.) I have to admit that I loved telling my friends "what I was in the mood for" and watching their faces. Actually, I'm a mother of four and I still love telling my friends that I'm hungry for this sandwich and watching their faces. I'm a dill pickle fan. Heavy on the mayo, heavy on the peanut butter, heavy on the pickle...Delicious!!

I have made a variation of this for years.  Simply peanut butter onion and salad dressing.  I prefer the way salad dressing complaments the peanut butter over mayo. Another old favorite is peanut butter and salad dressing alone. Thanks for the recipe.

I used miracle whip instead of mayo. Bread and butter pickles instead of dill pickles. It was amazing though!

Wow, I was extremely skeptical at first but I decided to try it since I had all the ingredients on hand. AND BOY, was I pleasantly surprised!  It tastes great and I was sure afraid that the peanut butter would be overwhelming but that was not the case at all. (Yet I did keep the mayo at a minimal.) 
Every ingredient brings together a balanced taste as a whole and oddly enough, each ingredient can still be detected with every bite!  I highly recommend this!  Simple and delicious!

To me there wasn't any flavor that stood out.  I would much rather have peanut butter and jelly.

It was so strange I had to try it. It's better with no onion and substitute bread & butter pickle chips for dill ones. Still quite weird. I guess that's the point though.

WOW, I was so impressed with this.  It truly sounds awful, but I've always been a risk-taker, so I just had to try it.  It didn't taste great at first, but then I experimented with a little more onion, tiny bit more mayo, and then less peanut butter, at which point the true flavor suddenly came out.  If you didn't like it, try that. Absolutely delicious, craving another one already!

Oh man, I'm one of those weirdos who always has to try those foods that mix "abnormal" combinations of foods.  While some have fallen flat where all you taste are the two things separately and all you think is "this isn't bad...but it isn't something I want to do again", this sandwich really blends the flavors into something enjoyable.  I think they're onto something.  I make this whenever I'm feeling something random and have pickles on hand.

I enjoyed this strange sandwich and have made it quite a few times! Didn't measure anything and I used the claussen sliced refridgerated dill pickles which were nice and crunchy. Everyone looks at me like I'm crazy when I eat this, but I don't care - it's good!

Hmm.  The pickles and onions completely overpowered the peanut butter, and I couldn't even taste the mayonnaise.  Sorry, but thanks for the interesting recipe!  It makes for good conversation: "One time I tried this really weird sammich..."   :)

I saw this, read the reviews, and was intrigued. So I made it, and was blown away. How can something so economical taste so fabulous? I have made this three days in a row for lunch. Not only have I saved over $10 versus takeout, but watching the reactions of people after I tell them what's in it is absolutely priceless. As a college student, this fits the bill and satisfies my hunger. Thanks!

Dill picle and peanut butter!!! I haven't even tried this recipe, but I fully understand that amazingness that is the PB and pickle sandwich, and these other ingredients sound like they would only make it better. I'm so glad someone else out there loves these sammies!

OMG!  I thought my sister and I were the only people that ate a PB and pickle sandwich.  Never put mayo or onion on it though.  Just straight up Peanut Butter and pickle.  I think Mt. Olive pickles are the best!!!  I love me some PB and pickles!  Woot!  Woot!

It sounds disgusting, but it's not! This sandwich was so weird that I just had to try it out, and even though I don't like dill pickles or peanut butter that much, put all together in between the bread it was actually pretty good!

I used sweet pickle relish, toasted sourdough bread, and generous amount of light kraft mayo and trader's joes crunchy unsalted pb.  TASTY.  Next time I will try red onion and less pb (but with salt). I like it!

I never would have thought of trying this (although I do eat PB & onion sandwiches) however,  I used a sweet relish instead of the pickle and I'm happy and surprised to say that this was purty darn good.

Oddly enough, it was delicious! I toasted my bread and only used one slice cut in half to make a "half sandwich" because I really didn't expect to enjoy it but I found it to be quite tasty.

Well, my oldest son is into weird food combinations right now, so he wanted to try this. He loved it, of course! I wasn't a huge fan as is, but I have to confess--if you leave out the onion and pickle (and just have peanut butter and mayonnaise), it is surprisingly good.

Ok, curiosity got the best of me.  I just tried this and surprised myself.  It's actually good, though a bit odd at first!  I think the trick is to go lighter on the PB than you normally would and use a little more mayo.  Will make this again and try red onion and a sliced tomato from the garden next time.

Fairly tasty. I had to use dill relish because I'm out of dill pickle, and I had to cut the amounts down because I'm using a smallish loaf of bread, but it's pretty good, actually. I'm sure it'll leave me with fierce breath, though. :P

Also, to NENAH25: I think it's called "Poor Man's Sandwich" because it's meant to emulate a sandwich made with meat when it's actually made with less expensive peanut butter plus stuff most people have on hand.

Curiosity consumed me on this one and I had to try it.. I love all of the ingredients, but having them together in a sandwich? Even as I was making it, I was thinking, "No way". But to my surprise, it actually tasted quite good. This is probably one that kids would enjoy.

At first I was quite hesitant to make this sandwich, but decided to give it a try. After the first bite, I couldn't believe what a tasty sandwich this was. I absolutely enjoyed it!! I did use 100% whole wheat bread, and mine width-wise, was longer in length, so I used (about) 2-1/2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter, 3 Vlasic Stackers' Pickles, and instead of sliced onion, I used (about) 1 tablespoon of finely diced onion, and (about) 4 teaspoons of Hellmann's Mayonnaise. Don't skimp on the peanut butter and mayonnaise; especially the mayonnaise, as it really enhances the flavor of the sandwich. NENAH25, thank you for sharing this recipe. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I grew up on this sandwich (without onions)!!  Everybody looks at me like I'm crazy when I talk about, but when I make people try they are always presently surprised! I crave this tasty sandwich often!! Thanks for adding this, now I know that my family isn't the only one that love this!!

I made this today using egg bread.  Excellent.  The tanginess of the vinegar in the pickle and the crunch of the cucumber and onion were perfect against the peanut butter and mayo.  I will totally make this again and again.

rof lol - desperation brings forth amazing results! Just threw together 1/2 of a sandwich and  - imagine my surprise - am going back for another half.  My hats off to whoever created this little gem.  After years and years of PB&J, it's nice to find something new.

LOL  My BF watched me eat PB & Pickles for 4 yrs before he would try it... and now he can often be found at the counter spreading PB on a pickle for a snack! It does sound odd, but it is SO yummy!

Like most reviewers, I couldn't resist trying this strange combination (even though I do not particularly care for peanut butter, dill pickles or raw onion).  Holy Moly!  I loved it!  I sliced the onion super thin so it wouldn't overpower the sandwich.  It's a surprising and delightful mix of flavor.

This sandwich is amazing for what it's made out of. Like many who've reviewed it before, I tried it out of sheer curiosity and skepticism. It's both sweet and savory. I'm curious to try different versions of it in the future.

I made one of these, cut it in half, and made my husband close his eyes before he ate it.  I knew he wouldn't even try it if I told him what it was.  Of course he likes goober burgers so I knew he would like it :o)  I had to make us each another one for supper and I've been told that the recipe is a keeper.

I don't know what got into me today (I am not pregnant, so cannot blame the weird craving on that), but I decided to try this recipe.  Would you believe it is NOT gross like I thought it would be and that I actually really liked it???  I did use sourdough bread because that was what we had sitting around & omitted the onions because we didn't have any sitting around.  I will make this again, even when I am not hurting to go grocery shopping.  Who would have guessed...!  :P

I'm so glad I tried this recipe! By accident I added cinnamon to the sandwich. (Some cinnamon I was putting on apples ended up on the sandwich.) It really brought out the peanut butter! Great sandwhich! I'll admit I was skeptical despite other's good reviews. But what a great blend of all the flavors!

My husband told me about this sandwich when we were first married... I thought he was joking! But after 21 years of marriage he's got me liking them almost as much as he does. We always add lettuce to ours... makes a nice sandwich for those times when you didn't make it out to the grocery store (Hey, what happened to all the ham!) or you're having those "right before payday" blues :)

I too was skeptical about this sandwich, but it's really delicious. It's going in my recipe box.

Well my boyfriend loves peanut butter very, very much so we thought we would all try this sandwich.  I didn't like it.  It tasted like nothing to me except peanut butter.  He said it was pretty good and he could taste all of it but really I think he just said that cuz he wanted another sandwich & he really didn't need one!

This was better than it sounds, but nothing special.
