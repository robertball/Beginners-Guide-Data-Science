Saturei is summer savory (satureja hortensis). Savory is found in any supermarket along with thyme and other herbs and spices. If you cannot find it thyme is a close substitute, but dried savory is lighter than dried thyme and has a slight lemony smell. This would eliminate the unecessary hassle of drying rose petals!
I had a kitchen garden and grew many herbs including summer savory (annual) and winter savory(perennial).
Liquamen was a Roman salty fish sauce. You could probably use Thai fish sauce or anchovy paste as a substitute.
I have not made this yet but am looking forward to it.

Note:  Liquamen is a salty fish sauce, usually substituted by salt alone; Defritum is a very thick fig syrup (i.e. canned fig syrup boiled down to 1/3 volume); and Saturei is a white-flowered European plant used in spicy bean dishes.

For my own part, I made this dish for Valentine's Day.  The meal was good, and tasted very exotic/unique/classy.  However, the ingredients were expensive and the taste, in my opinion, didn't make up for the cost and the preparation time (drying the rose petals, chopping all the spices & veggies).  Also, I found the fig syrup totally unnecessary since it didn't even taste like fig, just like sugar.  Also, I have no idea what to do with the figs now.  The meal was fine and we both liked it, but I wouldn't make it again.  PS: I used Cornish game hens instead of a chicken, and the meat was succulent.

My daughter had to make this for her Latin class. I had no problem finding dried rose petals (very inexpensive) at the local health food store, and substituted fresh dill for 1.5 tbs. dried, and the leek with onion (only because I didn't have any leeks in the house at the time. Canned figs aren't that hard to find in the grocery store but instead I used honey with this, again b/c I had forgotten the figs. Figs however, are great on toast in the morning - I grew up eating them this way as my grandmother always had homemade fig preserves around the house (where the best fig syrup can be used).
