Wonderful dish with leftovers and additions in this recipe!!!!
I am Irish and German...so the corned beef and sauerkraut is PERFECTLY yummy.  My husband enjoyed it very much too.  Made the recipe as is with only a bit more swiss cheese to our tastes.
Will be making this often!

This was awsome!!!! it does not have a strong saurekraut taste which I was happy about. A good comfort food for those long winter nights
