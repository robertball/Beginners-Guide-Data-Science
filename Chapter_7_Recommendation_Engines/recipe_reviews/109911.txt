I didn't use any vinegar and I simply used skewers instead of trying to skewer them with rosemary. I put the rosemary in the marinade instead. The sauce was delicious.

Much to my surprise, this recipe was easy to make.  The combination of the fresh herbs and the yogurt sauce with the tender lamb meat was excellent.  Using Rosemary sprigs as skewers was a great idea as it gently permeated just the right amount of flavor into the meat. Throughout dinner we kept commenting on how wonderful it was.

Absolutely love it.  I'm making it again this weekend for Father's Day.  Always loved lamb, but this sauce is amazing.  I don't know if I'll ever have lamb without it again!

The lamb was good, but the "salsa verde" seemed like a weak attempt at tzatziki. Next time I'll just made real tzatziki.

I didn't use the vinegar because I was out of it.  I used sherry cooking wine instead.  I loved the sauce. It tasted great.  I will definitely make the sauce again.

Not real fond of this recipe. Way too many flavors rolled into one. I like the taste of lamb, but the sherry vinegar seemed to take over. I wouldn't make this one again.

My Husband thought this was 5 star AAA+++. I thought the Yoghurt Salsa Verde was too acidic with both the lemon juice and capers. Added a bit of sugar to balance it but would use lemon zest instead of juice next time to get the flavour without so much acid. Didn't thread the lamb on rosemary skewers as I used lamb cutlets so just added it to the marinade. Also used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry. Overall this was very enjoyable.

I made this recipe last year for some visiting friends.  We  loved the salsa verde!  The lamb was tender and flavorful and I will be making this again soon. I often buy ground lamb to make a nice ristotto.  But  this kabob recipe ROCKS!

Don't usually try a recipe for the first time with company but so glad that I did this time.  This recipe is awesome.  Cubed meat from  lamb loin chops into one inch cubes, and did use the rosemary skewers which gave an interesting and tasty twist.  At first, thought the yogurt mint sauce was too tart, but we all loved it with the lamb.  Will definitely make again and again.  Teamed this recipe with greek green beans which is very good too.
