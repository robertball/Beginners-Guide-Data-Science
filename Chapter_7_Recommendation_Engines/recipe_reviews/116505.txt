This was a great tasting cheesecake!  My husband, who doesn't normally like pumpkin desserts, really enjoyed this (although I did use about 3/4 can pumpkin w/ him in mind).  The only problem I had was with the spiderweb garnish.  I followed the directions, but the spiderwebs ended up with a consistency more like icing and kinda crumbled even when they cooled completely.  I was really disappointed, because it's such a creative idea.  But I'll try again next time and hopefully it'll work better.  I ended up just piping a spiderweb on the top of the finished cheesecake with melted chocolate.  Not as good a presentation as the garnish would've been but it worked.  Thanks for a fun Halloween recipe!

I made a web with warm carmel while the top layer wasn't set. Just spiral the carmel on the top and then run a knife from the center out in several different directions to link the web strands.

This is an excellent cheesecake recipe! It's a nice light cheesecake. Everyone loved it. Instead of using the chocolate wafer crumbs for the crust, I used one sleeve of chocolate graham crackers (crushed) mixed with 1/4 c. of sugar and used that only in the bottom of the pan, not up the sides. I omitted the spider web decoration things too.

This was a HIT!!! I took this cake to two different Thanksgiving parties, and everyone loved it.  I didn't do the spider webs though.  Instead I made fall leaves out of gumpaste, with a little gold shimmer. Not only does it taste great, but it looks great too.  I can't wait to make this again!!!

I have made this for several occasions and the results are wonderful!  People have stated that it is as good or better than the cheesecake factory!  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out great!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I want to make it for Halloweeen. I'm just a little confused as to how to make the spiderwebs. Can someone explain it to me?

Everyone loved this recipe, and it was very straightforward. It takes some time to bake, so just give yourself enough time to wait for it to get out of the oven. Best if made well in advance of when you want to serve it, to avoid stress. :-)

I didn't make this cheesecake, I actually made a lemon one instead but I have used the ingredients for the spiderwebs to decorate numerous cakes and I LOVE it! I love using different flavorings and designs. It adds a nice touch!

Made this for the first time right before Halloween and it was so good I'm making another one for Thanksgiving...minus the spider & web of course. Easy to make but does take a while, so you should plan accordingly if needed for an occasion. I didn't have much success in the spiderwebs, even after 3 attempts. But the cheesecake is fabulous & I loved the sour cream topping!

I made this cheesecake minus the Halloween decoration and it was a HIT!  Everyone absolutely loved it and I was told it was as good as if not better than the Cheesecake Factory.  I followed the recipe exactly with full-fat items and it was awesome!  I will try it next time with a lower fat version.  Thnaks!

It was a star on our Halloween table! I made some changes however. Instead of wafer crumbs I used the regular 9-inch Pillsbury pie crust and the spider web I drew with chocolate syrup. De-li-cios!!

Best. Pumpkin. Cheesecake. Ever! I've never liked anything pumpkin until this recipe! Love love love. I made this for Halloween AND Christmas, and both times, it was a hit. I made 2 simple changes. For the crust, I used graham crackers instead of chocolate wafer crumbs just because I love graham crackers. I omitted the spiderweb garnish and just put a plastic spider on top for the occasion. Other than that, I would not change a thing! The sour cream topping is to die for! Can't wait to make this again!

This cheesecake was delicious! The only thing I did differently was the crust.  I used 2 cups crushed Oreos and it was great!

I absolutely loved it!  The cheesecake itself was very good.  The candy webs were slightly difficult to make only because I had never done anything like it before.  I have a feeling practice makes perfect... or at least better. Really though, there were some not so hideous ones so I used those on the pieces I was giving people.  I sprayed my waxed paper with cooking spray so they wouldn't stick to the paper which worked pretty well.                    I didn't have a springform pan so I baked it in a chocolate crusted pie pan and 2 more in graham cracker crusts since it filled 3 pie pans.  I actually liked them better in graham crackers than in chocolate.                            One of the cakes got eaten before I even made the candy toppings.  Then I got tired making the spiders so I piped the remaining chocolate in a web on the top of one of the cakes and left the other one to have the webs and spiders. Everyone enjoyed the cheesecakes!  This recipe is definitely going to make another appearance. Hopefully, I will be able to make it in a springform pan next time!
