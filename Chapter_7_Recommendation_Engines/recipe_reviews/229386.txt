I used strawberry jello and only added a small amount of additional sugar.  I like the mandarin oranges whole so I ground up the pineapple instead.  This reminds me of a salad my mother used to make.  Thanks!

I loved the taste.  However, it did not make a jello mold as I thought it would.  I made it the day before Thanksgiving, followed the instructions and put it in a mold, but it never firmed up like a jello mold.  So, I spooned it into a dish and we ate it like a cranberry relish.  Any thoughts as to why?

Tried this as my contribution to our Thanksgiving feast. It was a hit--good combination of flavors. Only complaint is that it did not set up overnight. I had to put it in the freezer for a couple hours to soldify enough to serve. I'll make it again, but next time I will use less sugar (it was sweeter than I like) and either halve the add-ins or double the amount of jello.

this is a really good salad.  any flavor of jello works!  the only thing i will do next time is coarsly chop the pecans - just a personal preferance.

I messed up and used a total of 4 cups water (2 hot/2 cold) because I followed the recipe on the jello boxes.  The recipe only calls for 1 hot and 1 cold even though you used 2 boxes of jello.  It was still very tasty,  just not firm.  Can't wait to make this correctly!!!  YUM!

I have made this twice for my sister at Thanksgiving. It turns out great. It makes a lot for just a few people. The recipe could be halved for just a few people. I bring home the left overs to eat myself. What a treat! I should make this more often.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it so much they asked me to make it again for Christmas!  I could not find Cranberry Jello in the stores so I ordered it online.  Even people who do not like Cranberry Sauce liked it!

Followed the directions exactly but did not use cranberries and used cherry jello instead. Turned out great!
