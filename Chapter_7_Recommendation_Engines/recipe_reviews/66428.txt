Very Tasty! Here is how I made it: Used Jiffy mix for the cornbread and followed the directions on the box.  Added the cream corn to the jiffy mix.  Browned and drained the beef.  Added a taco seasoning packet to the beef. Put half the cornbread mixture on the bottom of the dish, then added a layer of cheese, then a layer the seasoned beef, then the rest of the cornbread.  Cook for 30 minutes, add cheese and cook for another 10.  My family loved it!

This recipe was excellent the first time I made it as is. The second time I made the cornbread as directed but added chopped onions, a bit of jalapeno, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and thyme to the ground beef as it cooked. I just spooned the ground beef on top of the cornbread mixture and topped with cheddar cheese before 5 minutes before removing from oven.  Heavenly!!!  Serve with a green veggie on the side and make this an entree'.

I like this a lot.  I fried the onion and pepper with the ground beef and used lots more cheese.  60 minutes did make it quite brown, so I can see why the other reviewer pulled it after 50, but I like it crispy.  I topped it with sour cream served it as a main dish.  I don't usually have fresh jalepenos on hand, so next time I'll probably use canned green chiles.  A winner!

I used 2 prepackaged cornmeal, mix them seperate and add one jalepeno to each.  Put one mix on the bottom of pan, add meat, corn and cheese, then put the other mix as top layer.  Makes a "stuffed" cornbread.  My whole family loves it.

This was a good idea, but I was running short on time and altered it somewhat. I browned the ground beef with onion and green pepper then added some Spanish Gardens taco sauce. I left this mixture in my ovenproof skillet and topped it with shredded mexican cheese. I mixed up a Jiffy corn muffin mix adding a can of cream corn to it then pouring it over all of the cheese and beef in the skillet. I baked it until the cornbread was done and served with baked sweet potato fries that had been shaken in a ziploc bag with a little veg oil, half a packet of taco seasoning and honey.

This was very good. Made this as is, except I took it out of the oven after 50 mins. Took it too a potluck at work, it reheated very well, and everbody loved it. I will make this again for home. I might omit the pepper, it had a little too much heat for me.

We really liked this recipe. I gave it four stars because I can see how it could be bland as written. I have to say though, it's a great starting place. I have a plan for easy dinners where I cook in bulk and then use as needed. I usually make a huge package of hamburger all as taco meat, with a diced onion and taco seasoning. This was a great way to use up a pound of that from the freezer. I just defrosted it and then followed the recipe as written, with the exception of using a pre-shredded mexican cheese blend, and evaporated milk instead. I also used two eggs, because I used whole can of milk, about 1 1/2 cups, and then threw in about an extra 1/2 cup of cornmeal as well.It was delicious and my whole family enjoyed it. We have a gluten intolerant family member as well, and they can eat it too!  Thanks for the yummy mexican cornbread recipe. Mucho Bueno!

I made this on New Year's Day and followed the recipe precisely. It was delicious and I got rave reviews from my friends!  They loved it! They were still stopping by 2 days later for more!!   I'm about to make another batch.  This time I'm using whole kernel yellow corn, more cheese and more jalapenos for a little extra heat. Delicious!!!!

Super recipe, very easy, with minimal ingredients. My husband loved this as well as the children. I also used two boxes of cornbread mix as another reviewer suggested, and layered first cornbread mixed with half the creamed corn on bottom, then cheese, ground beef mixture, top layer cornbread w/other half corn. 45 min turned out perfectly brown yet moist. The chopped jalapenos gave it a nice kick, a keeper!

This is fantastic!!  I also spice up the beef a little, whatever sounds good at the time.  Green peppers go well and I think since it cooks for an hour you don't really need to saute them first,  I put jalapenos on the side instead of cooking into the dish, for the lightweights. Also the jiffy cornbread makes this one the best good/easy recipes ever! Oh yeah, and the sour cream is a MUST.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This recipe is similar to one my Mom has been making for years and it is one of my favorites!  The only thing I do differently is I add a can on rotel to the ground beef after it's browned, and let the liquid cook out.  I also use dried minced onion instead of fresh, chopped, but this recipe is a winner, and freezes well!

This was a decent, filling meal.  I threw the onions, along with some cumin in with the ground beef while it cooked.  I also replaced the jalapenos with a can of green chiles.  50 minutes was plenty of time to cook the casserole.  Thanks!

We did enjoy this. I would have liked a little more bread in the mix to make it a little dryer, but overall good recipie. I am thinking of trying w/pork chorizo for a quick breakfast dish you could just re-heat.

Just ok. I think it would have been better if I'd used a sweeter mix like Jiffy or added a little sugar. I topped it with sour cream and that gave it a little extra dimension

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE. I DID MAKE SOME CHANGES THOUGH I OMITTED THE ONIONS AS I DO NOT LIKE THEM. AS ANOTHER REVIEWER SUGGESTED I ADDED  TACO SEASONING TO MY MEAT USED SHREDDED MEXICAN CHEESE AND USED CAN CHILIES. I ALSO USED WAY MORE CHEESE THAN THE RECIPE CALLED FOR AND A LITTLE MORE MEAT. AFTER ABOUT FORTY MINUTES MY CORNBREAD WAS RATHER DARK BUT NOT BURNT. IT WAS STILL VERY GOOD BUT ALSO WET. NEXT TIME WILL ADD MORE CORN MEAL TO MAKE DRIER BUT WILL BE A REGULAR MEAL AT MY HOUSE FROM NOW ON.

This was Delicious!  Instead of jalapeños, I added in 4 slices of pepper jack cheese (plus the cup of shredded cheddar cheese). I also added in a can of drained chili beans. When serving, I topped each piece with salsa and sour cream. YUM!

Instead of creamed corn, I used steamers southwest corn and did not add any additional onion as there was already onions and peppers in the southwest corn. Came out excellent!

I have made this so many times and we love it.  The only thing I have done differently was mix an envelope of Taco Season Mix with the ground beef when I cook it.  I usually cook it an hour or so ahead and let the meat soak up the seasonings.

My daughter and the dog (took the jalapenos out for him) liked it.  I used flour in my cornbread mix.  I also used cumin and chili powder in my ground turkey and I also used used stewed tomatoes in my bread.  I enjoyed it but I think I should not have used ground met it was king of heavy to me.

This is an authentic TexMex recipe, much like the one I grew up with. I changed it quite a bit and thought it was awesome.  I brown the gr.beef with onion, 1/4 - 1/2 red bell, chopped fine, 3-5 chopped jals., 1-4 oz. can green chilis, and a good sprinkle of Grill Mates Southwest dry seasoning; then thoroughly drain grease & liquid. All else is the same.  Also, my oven runs hot, so I checked in 45 mins, and appeared, in all tests, to be done.  After it cooled 30 mins. or so and I cut into serving pieces, it appeared to be a bit undercooked, so next time, I will cook an extra 5-7 mins.

Easy to make, but tastes fairly ordinary, even with the extra spicy jalapenos I used and corn kernels.

I just prepared the ingredients and added them to my normal cornbread recipe.  Turned out great!  I may add chili powder, cumin, or garlic powder, but it was fine as it is.

I just used the ready made cornbread mix for this recipe and it turned out great! My husband liked it and even had it for lunch the next day, which is rare. i will make this again and i cant wait to start experimenting with it, it's just one of those types of recipes!!

This is very tasty.  I added chopped onions, bell pepper, garlic, chopped jalapeno, cumin and chili powder to the ground beef as it cooked. Also added a bit more cheese to the top.  I got lots of compliments on it, even got compliments on the left overs :)

This is good and quite easy. We did not have any jalapenos or green chilis, but would use chilis next time.  We put our cheese on top for the last 5 minutes in the oven but mixed everything else together as written. Great main dish!

I thought this was pretty bland, I even put more cheese and jalapenos, and I added cumin.  Still bland, and definitely not worth making again. Also was VERY corn-y.

I made a Mexican meal, but several of the guests were not fond of rice so I made Mexican corn bread instead. It went over well, but a couole if peoole felt it was too spicy. I like it that way, but for company I might use just one jalapeño. I noticed some people said it didn't set in the middle. Mine did fine,  It makes me wonder if they used 16 oz of creamed corn instead of 8.

Made this several times and it always turns out well.  I do use bacon drippings instead of nonstick spray and drizzle some on top, just like I do when I make a skillet of cornbread. I also added more meat and cheese, and occasionally use a Mexican cheese blend. It is more of a casserole than cornbread, in my opinion, but it reheats well, a big plus because my husband takes leftovers to work for lunch.

II have used it as written. Also if I don't have jalapenos I substitute with green chili, green peppers or green onions if  you want it milder. It is a family favorite. I also substitute the ground beef with a tasty breakfast sausage sometimes.

Hey guys. You left out the flour in your recipe. I am hoping everyone noticed this before they baked this. My recipe calls for more cornmeal so mine calls for more flour. If I did this one, I would probably add 3/4 cup of flour.
Just a head's up to you bakers out there!!

Put in a 15 oz can of creamstyle corn and added an extra 1/2 cup cornmeal baked for 70 min. Still did not get done. Flavor was very good but consistency was like dressing. Next time 1/2 can corn. It was tasty bur needs some refinement.

This recipe I was delicious and different! I mostly followed this recipes, except I replaced the ground beef with ground mexican chorizo, which added some kick.

Made this many times and family loves it. Instead of jalapeños (too hot) substituted about 1/4 c of Pace picante sauce spooned over meat and chopped onion then remaining meat and cheese.

I have used this recipe for years, but never put it together like that. I use canned chopped green chili's. The meat and cheese are the middle. 1/2 the batter on bottom and top. Bake about the same, 50-55 minutes. Delicious served with homemade salsa.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I used Jiffy cornbread mix and "Rotel" drained. Turned out great and hands up with two high school seniors. The next time I followed the entire recipe except two things: I used not fresh but pickled jalapeno's as I always have them in fridge. I did layer part of it as someone suggested, for me the layering does not work, it does not mix well. I think this is a great recipe and will continue to use it. Thank you Snowy!

This is just how my Grandmother used to make Mexican Cornbread.  All the way down to the beans on the side. Ive adjusted to meet my husband's taste. I add a little cayenne to the cornbread mix and always extra peppers, but he likes spicy!  Thanks*
