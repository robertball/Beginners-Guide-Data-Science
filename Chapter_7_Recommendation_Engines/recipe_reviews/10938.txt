These are one of my favorite bars!  I do the topping a little differently though.  When I make them I double the butter and sugar mixture for the topping.  Another reviewer said there wasn't enough to cover the bars but this solves the problem and its the best part of the bars anyway.

I give this recipe a 5 star rating with the revisions I made. I took others advice and upped the flour to 2 cups and doubled the brown sugar/butter layer. I chopped up my pecan halves a bit and instead of 1 cup milk chocolate chips on top I did 1 cup semi sweet and 1 cup butterscotch swirled. HEAVEN! Oh my good ness these are so good, the butterscotch adds so much! I topped with the chips and put back on the oven to melt them completely so I could swirl them together. YUM!!!!!!!!

This is almost the exact same recipe my mother handed down to me (and it is always a crowd pleaser). Her quanties on some ingredients are a little different: 

2 cu. Flour
1½  cu. Pecan halves
1½ cu. milk chocolate chips

Since some reviews think the posted version comes out a little greasy, the extra half cu. of flour may help to absorb that. And you can't go wrong with extra pecans and chocolate!

I followed the others suggestions and used 2 c, flour and used 2 c. chocolate chips and slso lined the pan with foil.  After cooling, I cut the bars into 1"x1" pieces.  Making them bite size, they were neat & easy to eat.  You could have several and not feel so guilty.

These are great but make sure to use 2 c flour, 1 1/2-2 c pecans, and 2 c chocolate chips.

These are awesome!  A local deli/caterer sells bars just like these, and I am so glad to have the recipe at last.  I have a large family so double the recipe and cook it in a jelly roll pan.  The bars are more of a toffee crunch (which is what I was looking for) so I don't think they are meant to be chewy.  They turn out to be a rich, buttery, shortbread-type cookie bar topped with a crunchy praline pecan layer.  MMMMMMmmmmm!  Thanks for the recipe.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars based on how it is currently written.  It is almost identical to the other turtle bars recipe on this site.  I increased the flour to 2 cups total, and added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the caramel mixture.  I took these to a church potluck and they disappeared!  Got lots of compliments on them.  Would rate this one 5+ stars with the above changes.  :o)

I recently tried some of these bars that someone else made from a different recipe.  Since I didn't have that one, I checked out allrecipes and found this one.  The two had similar ingredients, but came out nothing alike.  These are very greasy, and not chewy like the ones I'd had.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of butter...but I will be trying again.

I did as suggested, and used 2 cups of flour and 1 1/2 cups of pecans.  I found the butter/sugar filling wasn't enough to cover the bottom crust.

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead, I think using milk chocolate chips would have made it too sweet, and it wouldn't have held it's shape as well while being cut into bars.

Read previous reviews.  First I sprayed the pain with a non stick spray then.. used 2C of flour, 1C of brown sugar and 1/2 C of butter in crust, 1 cup of butter with 1 cup of  brown sugar in caramel sauce.  Whole bag of pecan pieces and 2 C of semi sweet chocolate chips.  When I took them out of the oven, I slowly added the chips to the top and watched them melt into the caramel.  I thought "Oh no these will not make a nice chocolate topping to "swirl" but they did.  If I did not add 2 C of chips they would not have worked the way they should have, but that extra chocolate did the trick.  I put them back in the warm oven immediately and after 8 min, took them out and spread the chocolate around with my spatula.  I cut the squares while still soft and left in the pan to cool some more.   I had to tell the kids to stop eating them after half the pan was gone in an hour so I had some to take to work which is why I made them in the first place.  I think I will make this again and again.  Thanks for they recipe Marlyn!

These were very yummy. I do have some suggestions. I also upped the flour as suggested to 2 cups. I doubled the caramel middle layers as well and think that really is necessary. Some reviewers are complaining about a "buttery mess" or butter leaking out the top. If you are not combining the caramel layer well, I can see this would happen. I mixed the caramel with a silicone whisk to make sure it was totally blended. I would also melt the chocolate and pour it over rather than sprinkle on the chips and try to spread them. Much neater presentation that way and you assured the chocolate melts.

These tasted great and were easy to make, but the chocolate separated from the nut and caramel layer.

These are yummy, but incredibly rich.  I also increased the flour to 2 cups and used at least 1 1/2 cups of roughly chopped pecans.  Definitely double the butter/brown sugar mixture or there won't be enough to fill the pan.  I added about a tsp. of vanilla to the 'cookie' batter and used semi-sweet chips for the top (I'd never use milk choc, they are super sweet even with the semi-sweet).  I also melted some white chocolate and marbled it in with the choc chips for a prettier look.  They can definitely be cut into smaller than normal "bar" cookies because of the richness.  Very pretty for presentation too!

Read the bad reviews before making this recipe.  I almost threw this away, but my husband said they were pretty good (because he didn't know what they were supposed to be).  The cookie and toffee layer formed this mush that didn't harden up with time.  I ended up putting them in the freezer to help keep their shape.  If you don't grease your pan, good luck getting them out of there.  I used aluminum foil sprayed with non-stick, and it stuck major.  I even added 2 c of flour like suggested, and it was a buttery mess.  I did 1 1/2 the toffee layer instead of doubling it, added an extra 1/2 c pecans, and it def needed another cup of chips to give it a good layer on top.  Do not plan on making again.

These are one of the best bars I've made in the past few years. They don't take any time at all to make and they taste awesome. I used a scant 2 cups of flour in the shortbread crust, and only a half cup of butter for the toffee layer. Don't worry if it doesn't look like the toffee is going to cover the entire crust. It boils down to cover everything once you put it in the oven.

these were AMAZING. i actually substituted the pecans for walnuts and it was a HUGE hit. they disappeared in   a few hours. they are sweet, nutty, and so addicting: perfect for a sweet tooth. but definitely try walnuts.
AWESOME RECIPE :)

The ingredient quantity's are off. There should be more topping ,pecans and chips to cover the top..the recipe is a bit too sweet for me, if i make again i will reduce the amount of sugar by half, use dark chocolate chips too, still a decent bar with some tweeking...

Tonight is the 4th time I have made these ridiculously delicious bars this week.  My co-workers, friends, and family have gone a little off kilter eating these.  I will be filling tins with these for Christmas; since I have had so many requests.  I reduced the sugar in the flour mixture by ½ and I used dark semi sweet or bitter sweet chips.  Good job Marlyn; thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!  Used tips to increase the flour to 2 cups, doubled the caramel layer, used 2 cups chips on top.  I baked for 18 minutes, I guess I should have adjusted the time down a few minutes - the caramel layer was so molten that when I sprinkled on the chips they sank down and most could not be spread over the top.  This only affects the way it looks, no impact on the flavor!

These were really yummy - easy too!  As per other reviews, I used 2 cups flour, used about 2 cups nuts (ran out of pecans, put some walnuts in the food processor and chopped much more finely than the pecans were chopped - awesome), I also used 1 cup butter & 3/4 cup brown sugar for the sauce, and it was JUST enough.  I used a whole bag of chocolate chips and this is where I may have run into the issue I have had of the chocolate layer separating from the caramel layer, so I will try less next time.  Also, made the crust in the food processor - very easy.  I took these to a function and they were received with rave reviews. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was pretty generous with the 1 1/2 c serving of flour since most reviews mentioned increasing the flour to 2 cups. Also, My caramel sauce covered my entire pan... I drizzled it slowly and had no problems w/ there not being enough like some reviews have stated, but I do think these would be better w/ a bit more sauce, I'd use 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of sugar next time. I would definitly reccomend using 2 cups of flour though cause my crust came out pretty greasy even after being pretty generous w/ the measurments. I used whole pecan halves and I think I would have prefered it if they were chopped up a bit. I did enjoy these and id make them again for sure w/ the changes I mentioned.

Following other reviews, I used 2 c. of flour rather than 1 1/2 and that was good.  I also doubled the brown sugar mixture and the chocolate and used 1 1/2 c. pecan halves.  Next time, I won't double the chocolate and I will rough chop the pecans.  Sometimes the reviews are great and sometimes you just have to try the original recipe!

These bars are amazing.  Served them to 4 adults and 2/3 of the pan were gone!
I did use 2 cups of flour, doubled the caramel layer and used 2 cups milk chocolate chips. After baking it, I let it cool, then I melted the chocolate in the microwave and poured on top which made it much easier to spread.  This should be allowed to cool for a few hours in order to set properly, which made it easier to cut and less "oozy".
Would absolutely make it again, and again!

SO SO Simple and really really good... very rich and sweet though... an easy recipe to through together when you need a quick dessert.... I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added an additional half half of flour and I also added a half cup of semi-sweet chips to the milk chocolate mine turned out wonderful.... I can see how more of the caramel layer might be good but the way I made them turned out great....

these were pretty tasty, although not quite what i was expecting. the brown sugar crust sort of overwhelms the flavor i think, but its still yummy. 

i think next time i will halve the crust, quadruple the sugar/butter (caramel) mix and also the pecans, and then leave the chocolate as is. my favorite part of turtles is the pecan/caramel, with just enough chocolate to set off the taste, so i think just enough crust to hold it together would be perfection.

These were really good.  I followed the advise of others and doubled the sugar and butter mixture.  I also lined my 9 X 13 pan with foil after spraying or buttering.  I put the in the refrigerator and when they were firm, I lifted the bars out of the pan, removed the foil and was able to cut them in fairly small pieces.  They are rich, but everyone loved them.

I made these with the extra chocolate and pecans as suggested in previous reviews and they are truly outstanding. I am a professional baker and made these for an important catered event. They were so good my boss clapped me on the back and told me I had done an excellent job! Thanks for making me a baking superstar today!!

the butter pooled on top - the brown sugar, butter mixture needs to be heated to 250-300 degrees depending on different websites.  need to try again.  i would also add more pecans and chocolate.

Very easy but I would definitely cut down on the amount of butter used in the topping.  Mine looked greasy and I actually dabbed them with a paper towel not too successfully though!  Also, the pecan halves were basically covered up by the chocolate topping so next time I will just use chopped pecans.  These were delicious and I will make them again for sure.

The recipe needs to be reworked as suggested by a number of reviewers.  They were easy to make that is the only reason I gave them 2 stars!  I nearly tossed out the whole pan!  But it helped by putting them in the refrigerator.

I followed the recipe precisely, and mine seemed greasy and grainy (like the brown sugar didn't ever completely dissolve). Probably not my best use of good butter. . . Maybe if I had cooked them longer than the recipe said, but I don't know.

Also felt these were way too buttery (greasy) and that flavor over-powered the bars. Even with the added 1/2 cup flour that others suggested, it was too much butter.  I couldn't even tell that there were pecans or carmel flavors that were supposed to a part of these bars.
2 stars given purely for the simple and easy recipe. I will definately adapt the concept and revamp the. I think I will use the crust from the Lemon Pie Bars recipe from this site.

Followed to a T and used a 13x9 pan. My bars were so flat and looked nothing like the other recipe photos. Very buttery but has a good taste. Won't make again, though.

This recipe was so delicious!!!  Instead of using pecans I used halved almonds that were equally as good.  Also, I used different chocolate chip toppings for each of the batches that I made one dark chocolate, one milk chocolate, one white chocolate, and one peanut butter chocolate.  The white chocolate one was my favorite and I highly recommend using it!

Followed the suggestions, 2c flour, doubled the butter/sugar "filling" .  They were not gooey or all that good.  We were hoping for a more gooey and moist result.  Perhaps we cooked the caramel too long?  Also I think tripling the cooked brown sugar/butter mixture would be a good idea. Still good just not there yet

My husband loved these.  I thought they were too sweet.  I took other reviewers suggestion to used 2 Cups Flour.  Next time I do that but will also omit the brown sugar from the crust.  I doubled the brown sugar, butter, and Pecans and used butterscotch chips in addition to semisweet.

I didn't have good luck with this recipe.  They do taste great, but the chocolate wouldn't melt.  And they were a little greasy.  I followed others advice and added extra flour and used more chocolate chips.  I wanted to take them to work for a baby shower, but will not be able to do that now.  I will not make them again.

I have to say that this is the first recipe from AllRecipes that I just did not really like and will not bake again...I did as others suggested and added 2 cups of flour rather than 1 1/2 and doubled the caramel middle but it just never came together into a tasty dessert. The bottom layer was greasy and the caramel was nonexistant and the milk chocolate topping was far too sweet. Maybe I'll like them more after they have rested overnight but for now I will not make them again!

These are VERY good.  My husband loved them!  I think I may have cooked it a little too long because it tasted more like toffee than turtles but it was great that way too!

So this was yummy, but i had to make several changes many of which are mentioned in other reviews.  This included almost doubling the caramel mixture, and adding extra butter to the crust.  The chocolate chips do not melt correctly either - no matter what i tried.  I would re-do it with a double boiler to get them melted correctly.  They were yummy once i got them done, but it needed way to much adjustment.

I took the advice of others and increased the flour to 2 cups. I also doubled the caramel layer. These were awesome! Will definitely be making these again! My fiance couldn't stop eating them: )

These bars tasted good and I made them exactly like the recipe said.  I plan on making them to include in neighbors' cookie trays but I will make 2 changes:  I will bake them in an 8x8 pan.  In a 9x13 pan then came out very flat (not like the picture AT ALL!)  Also I will cut back on the butter in the crust - I love butter as much as the next guy, but they were saturated in butter.  I'll try 1/4 - 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2.  Very easy to make!

I have a recipe for these from Taste of Home (1996) thatt is almost the same. They are delicious!  For the crust I use 2c flour, 1 c brown sugar and 1/2c butter and press into 9x13 pan; top with 1c pecan halves. For caramel, boil 2/3c butter and 1/2c brown sugar, bring to boil and boil for 1 minute. Pour over crust and bake for 18-22 minutes @ 350*. Then just sprinkle on 1c semisweet choc chips and spread when melted.

These bars are to die for! It is almost impossible to eat just one; the combination of shortbread, homemade caramel, pecans, and chocolate is irresistable! Not only that, these bars are also pretty easy to make, and always turn out well! Thanks for a wonderful recipe; I will make these often!

These were very good.  I only used 1/2 c butter in the filling, rather than 2/3 c, and it turned out fine.  I've always preferred more crust than filling so the ratio was great for me, but I suspect most people would prefer twice as much filling.  I toasted the pecans and used milk chocolate chips.  Next time I may try granulated sugar in the crust instead of brown.

I took Erin's advice in an earlier review and increased the flour to 2 cups and used 1.5 cups each of pecan halves and chocolate chips.  WOW!  They are GREAT!  Thanks Maryln & Erin...this one's a keeper!

Nope. Too gritty when done. Carmel "sauce" didn't cover entire pan, made more. some pieces are just chocolate, a nut, and crust... no carmel.

I won Best Cookie with this recipe at a giant cookie swap for charity! It's insanely easy and sooooooo yummy. I actually messed up the directions and forgot to put the pecans in before baking. I ended up pressing them into the melted chocolate at the end. Still turned out great! My only regret is that I didn't make more of them! :)

I agree with the others, you do need to double the brown sugar and butter for the carmel filling.

These are indeed some yummy treats!  I think if it were my recipe though, I'd name it Pecan TOFFEE Bars.  I did make changes per reviews. I doubled middle filling, when doin' so, cut back butter by 1/4 cup...so only use 3/4 cup for double middle filling.  I did add extra 1/2 cup of flour to crust, it seems like it'll be too dry at first, but it'll soak up some butter from the filling...mine did.  I doubled the chocolate, BUT, next time I won't, it detracts the great flavor from the filling.  Also, I will wait until the pan is cooled from the oven and I will premelt and drizzle the chocolate over decoratively.  I also used almonds along with pecans, next time I will add extra, I'm nutty and love nutty  :P

Like a few other reviewers, I found this too greasy from the butter and the brown sugar mixture grainy.  Not sure how to fix these issues.  Cook the brown sugar mix longer? I was concerned that if I overcooked it then it would turn into brittle.

It is definitely a candy.  I followed the advice about doubling the flour.  I upped the butter/sugar layer too.  I also increased the choc chips but shoudln't have, it made that top choc layer too chick - for me.  I would also use milk chips next time.  I guess I kind of wish the bars were a little thicker.  If the pan were smaller then you might not need to increase everything.  I might experiment with that the next time.

I thought these were just ok... I didn't have any problems with the consistency, but they didn't have a lot of flavor in my opinion.  I did increase all of the ingredients by 1 1/2 times, and can't imagine there would be enough filling to cover a 13x9 bottom with any less.  And I did use a whole bag of semi sweet chips on top, and the chocolate layer still was kind of thin.  Someone else who tried them at the potluck loved them... so who knows?  Could be just me :)

Followed the recipe exactly and the bars were wonderful.  The chocolate will pop off a bit but that's just because of the butter etc. - not a huge problem.

the crust was too buttery, the carmel was too buttery, butter oozed on top of the choc layer. should have followed the advise of others rather than make as is.

I found that there was way to much butter it was 1/2 in thick on top of bar. and the choc. was not enough, and they stuck to bottom of pan. What I did get out and try after pouring off grease was good. Will tweek the recipe and see if that helps.

I must have done something wrong.  The bottom crust is very grainy.  The caramel is tasteless and the chocolate pieces were not enough.  I could not recommend this recipe to anyone.

I made this today after seeing the recipe on facebook.  It was a big hit.  Tastes just like a turtle.  I had to use semi sweet chocolate on the top because I didn't have milk chocolate but I like dark choc.  better.  Great recipe!

So simple, rich and delicious. I didn't mind the base being thin and a little crumby so that's why I was fine with not doubling the caramel (brown sugar/butter). I do suggest to double the pecans though. For the  chocolate topping, my husband didn't like this type of frosting form. He prefer the ones that will set hard (semi-sweet chocolate and adding unsalted butter).

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and ended up with less than desirable results.  It was going o.k. until the caramel mixture which did not cover the entire pan of bars.  I then did a half batch of the caramel mixture to make up for the deficit.  The bars still seemed o.k. I baked them only to have a greasy mess of butter (I did use real butter) on top of the caramel mixture.  The chips did not melt well even after putting them on immediatley following baking and did not spread well.  We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, let them cool, and tasted them.  They looked o.k. but were greasy and gritty.  It's a great concept but would not use this recipe again.

These were sensational! I increased the flour to 2 cups as others suggested and doubled the butter/brown sugar mixture. I also doubled the chocolate chips and used chopped pecans instead of the halves. They tasted like a pecan sandie with a melted heath bar on top. Delicious!

After reading all the RAVE reviews, I decided to make these....well the bottom was so hard! the "carmel" center melded with the crust and it became one candy mass. After a bite I thought I'd have to see my dentist.....I followed the directions and made the changes that everyone suggested, and so I'm extremely dissapointed. Excuse me now, I must pick out the hard crust out of my teeth.

This recipe was really good! I think it needs a tad more chocolate, (I was unable to swirl it) I also would have wanted a little more caramel... With those changes, though, I will make it again! Thanks!!!

I made these to take to a friend and, after trying them, decided they weren't good enough to take.  I followed other reviews and changed the flour to 2 cups and doubled the caramel mixture.  These were WAY too sweet--the crust layer was incredibly sweet and grainy.  I was so disappointed.  I usually try a recipe twice before writing it off, but I don't think I'll give this one a second chance.

Not sure what I did wrong-maybe didn't bake long enough, but my chocolate chips melted right into my caramel. Wound up like fudge consistency. I did as others suggested and doubled caramel mixture as well as using 2c. flour in shorbread layer.  ???

This was very good! I used 2 cups of flour as suggested by other members but I think it would of been better as written because this made the mixture a little dry. I crushed the pecans because it didn't seem to be enough to cover the entire pan if they were left whole. I would consider this to be a candy because of how sweet and rich the bars are.

Someone gave this recipe to my sister many years ago, and she shared it with me.  We both have been making these ever since.  They are SO good!!  I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe, no matter where I take them.  The best part is that they are so easy and they take very little time.  Try these.

These were pretty yummy. However they were quite greasy, butter was oozing up between the chocolate. The caramel mixture should be equal parts butter and brown sugar, 1/2 c butter instead of 2/3 c. And next time I will double the caramel:)  One other problem I has was I couldn't get the milk choc chips to melt enough to spread. Semisweet chips melt and spread much better, so I would recommend using those instead, and increase the amount to 1&1/2 c. I will make these again!

These were OK. They would taste better if the toffee layer were caramel-y like turtles. Also, I waited too long to cut into bars--the chocolate layer had firmed up and separated from the toffee layer on some of these.

I only read a couple reviews before attempting this, so I was unaware of it tasting like toffee. I am not a huge fan of toffee and was actually expecting the middle to resemble a pecan pie somewhat. Overall they were still tasty, the kids loved them. I also upped the flour to nearly 2 cups. I added about 2 extra tbsp to the butter mixture, I was scared to double it for fear of them being too greasy. I was careful poring it and it was more than enough to cover the whole thing. They did turn out a bit greasy but not too bad, napkins are a must though. I had no issues removing then from the pan, the middle was a little more soggy and the edges were crisp. I think I will try the crust with a no corn syrup pecan pie recipe for the filling next time. Oh one more thing I only had a little less than a cup of chocolate chips, I carefully spead them out, returned it to the oven and 4 mins later pulled it out. I managed to spread the chips evenly when melted. I really think more chips would have made it far too sweet. I used semi-sweet.

I recently tried these.  I followed other peoples' suggestions with regards to doubling the sugar and butter mixture for the middle layer, but found them WAY TOO SWEET and greasy.  I think next time I will either try a smaller pan, so that the mixture will cover it with the original amounts.  Also, I don't think these will look anything like the picture unless you melt the chocolate separately and pour it over top.  Will try again, though.

My son had these bars from a local bakery so I decided to make some at home, don't get me wrong these taste awesome, but as written the squares would not work. I halved the recipe for a 9x9 pan, used 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of butter for the base. I used my hands to make the base and pressed down hard with my potato masher. For the topping I used 1/2 cup ground pecans as that is what I had leftover from Christmas baking with 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter and 1 tsp vanilla added after boiling. I used semi sweet chips, didn't measure just sprinkled over the top, then swirled when melted. I wish the submitter or Allrecipes would add divided in the ingredients for the brown sugar and butter because if you don't read the recipe through properly you would not know you need it for the base and topping until it was too late. I also lined my pan with parchment paper for easy removal and clean up. Next time make the full recipe for the 9x9 pan to make them thicker.

I regret finding this recipe because they are so addictive! (And so easy) They are delicious and perfect as written - light, crisp, buttery, a salty sweet delight! Make sure you don't overcook the caramel - and I did mine in a non-stick saute pan rather than a sauce pan. I was very concerned when the crust was so crumbly - almost powdery - but once I poured on the caramel it mixed with the crust and nuts and created a wonderful treat.

I found this recipe around Thanksgiving...I have made about 4 batches now and it is not even Christmas yet!!  Needless to say that every time I have baked them they have disappeared quickly...The flavor improves the next day if you can keep them that long!!

My son actually swooned when he tasted them. They are really delicious and take no time at all to put together. I do have an observation, though. I'm sure I used a lot more than a cup of pecans. I had some very large halves and I just laid them all over the crust. There was space between, but not a lot. Second, I'm also certain that I used more than one cup of chocolate morsels. I just wasn't getting the coverage that I thought should happen, so I used more. I used semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate because that's what I had on hand. Third - I sprinkled a TINY amount of Fleur de Sel sea salt over the finished pan before cooling completely. The rage seems to be salted caramel, and it sounded good so I did it. DEE-licious!

I see I should've doubled the chocolate chips.  Mine don't look like the photo which shows thick fudgy chocolate.  Mine have just a thin layer of chocolate.

These were very tasty little cookie  bars, but next time I think some adjustments will be necessary. I made the recipe exactly as written. A few more pecans might be nice (that's personal taste, of course), and the bottom layer crumbles as you munch. If the cookie held together a little better, all would be well! :)

I had high hopes for this recipe. I followed the suggestion of previous reviewers and increased the flour to 2 cups, other than that and using dark chocolate chips rather than milk chocolate chips I followed the recipe exactly. They tasted like nothing but butter and sugar to me - even the dark chocolate flavor was lost in the sugar. I couldn't eat them.

Its super easy to make.... so I've tried it a few times; I'm not in love with the outcome of this recipe.  I up the ratio of the caramel layer by 1/3 c butter and 1/4 c brown sugar, keeping the same ratio but not wanting to go overboard with it.  It's OK with regards to taste and consistency, it's just not great overall.  At least it's full of sugar and my children are less critical as sugar increases.

I didn't care for the texture of the bottom layer.  I might try using more butter next time.  It was very crumbly, and almost resembled sand.  Also, I needed more chocolate chips than the recipe called for.  I'm going to play around with the measurements and try this again, because I love turles!

Hmmm...should have read the other reviews first. I found that the  caramel layer wasn't enough to cover the bars. I'll try to double it next time. Also, though I baked these the minimum amount of time, I found the caramel layer became hard and slightly burnt tasting. I was hoping for a gooey caramel layer like real turtles. I will try to reduce baking time if I ever bake these again. Certainly looked better in the picture than they turned out. Bummer.

I took these to a family dinner for dessert.  They were eaten up really quickly!!  I took the advice from some other and 1 1/2 timed the recipe for 72 servings rather than 48.  I still cooked it in a 13x9 pan because I wanted the thicker bar!!  They turned out great..you'll love them if your like a rich dessert!!

Made these for a party yesterday. They are really good, brought home a few leftovers (surprised at how few, as there were a LOT of cookies, etc. at the party) Cookies are even better the next day. I did take the suggestion of the extra 1/2 cup of flour. My personal taste would to be to make it in a larger pan next time, so that the crust would be thinner, and double the caramel part. However, made as the recipe stated I had rave reviews.

I have made these bars for years with the modified recipe.  I like to drizzle melted white chocolate on top before serving for a fancier look.  Lately I've had trouble with the chocolate falling off the tops of the "cookie" part of the bar. I've tried all different brands of milk chocolate chips. Any suggestions.  These bars are always raved over.  Just love them even when they don't look as pretty as I'd like!

I used 2 cups of pecan halves and toasted them first to bring out the flavors.... also, I used dark choclate chips...... 4 cups instead of 1.   The chips weren't melting, probably because I used so many, so I put it in the turned off oven (but still warm) for about 45 seconds to a minute.   YUMMY!

Based on other reviewers, I also upped the flour to 2 cupes and doubled the filling. Very good! I let the bars cool for about 5 minutes out of the oven and that seemed to help with the chocolate chips sinking into the filling.

This was delicious!  I took the recommendations from others and upped the flour to 2 cups and doubled the topping mixture.  I baked for 25 minutes b/c it wasn't quite "bubbly yet".  Will make again...my son and hubby LOVED it!

The concept is good, but if I make them again the filling (pecans and butter/sugar mixture) needs to be doubled. Very simple recipe though. Good for a quick fix.

These are delicious. I had some trouble with the bars sticking to the pan, and the chocolate didn't fully melt, so they're not extremely pretty. But YUMMY.

Very yummy recipe.  I took other's advice and increased flour and doubled filling.  Problem was I had to do another double batch.  I made this in a pampered chef bar pan 11 x 13 and the doubled filling batch just wasn't enough.  So I basically quadrupled it.  Next time maybe I'll do it in my 10x13 cake pan, maybe I won't need to do 2 double batches.  I used extra chocolate chips and used 1/3 cup semi and carmal swirls.  Sending them to work with hubby once they are set.  They are sure to love them!  Will make again.

I made these for my friend who doesn't eat eggs.  For a dessert without eggs, these are delicious.  As an all around dessert, these are ok.  Don't regret making them, but would make something else above these.

All I can say is "Really Good!!!"  I upped the flour to 2 c and used 1 1/2 c of dark chocolate since I like it better than milk.  Will definitely make this again!  :)

Super easy recipe. They were good but a little too sweet for my taste. Perhaps cutting back the sugar in the crust would help.

This was a great recipe, SO easy to make! I thought I'd pass along my major mistake so that others wouldn't make it. The recipe said to cool on a wire rack, which I was doing, but got impatient and put it in the fridge. Well, not having bakied much with chocolate before, little did I know that the chocolate on the top would separate from the rest of the bars! At any rate, people still raved about the flavors and ate them all up. Thanks for a great and easy recipe! I'll know better the next time :)

I  doubled THE BROWN SUGAR AND BUTTER FOR THE Carmel mixture, as others had recommended. I also added an extra 1/2 cup flour to the cookie crumb for the bottom layer as others recommended.  They were fabulous!!!!!!! Will become a tradition. I also used parchment paper in the bottom in the pan and cooked it longer than called for, not really sure how long, the 2nd layer was bubbling.

I added a little more pecans and a little more chocolate to cover the bottom.  Tasted very good and sweet!  I just don't have the right technique of swirling the chocolate.  Not that pretty but an excellent treat!

Too many adjustments because the recipe as written does not work.  I did all the adjustments even put the chocolate chips on 10 minutes before the recipe was done.  What a disaster.  The chocolate chips never melted.  Took over two hours and it is a complete mess.  And I tripled it for gifting.  Very disappointed.

I have a recipe for these that we love but It uses a 11 x 13 pan and I didn’t want to make so many so when I found this recipe I thought I’ll try it! Well I took them uncut to a party and when I cut them and tried to get them out of the pan they were all gooey and started sliding a part, oh oh! Well I did manage to cut them smaller and put the better ones on the plate. Very hard to eat but surprisingly they were eaten! Wish I would’ve read the reviews! I didn’t think there was a thick enough crust and the caramel does need to be increased just not sure why mine were so sloppy!

Not sure about this one. I doubled the butter and sugar as suggested by others. Big mistake! I used paper towels on the top trying to soak up all the butter. It still didn't remove enough. It was one giant puddle and the cookie part never did set until the next day. Turned out to be an expensive flop. 
If you cook it as written it might be okay.

Wow ! Just wow. Definitely do follow the improvements suggested to increase flour to 2 cups and double the brown sugar and butter topping. I omitted the nuts due to allergies and used milk chocolate chips and the bars taste like Heath bars, but better !  I will be making these from now on. Thanks !

I added 1/2 cup pecans in order to better cover the bottom layer.  Also could NOT get the chocolate chips to melt after taking them out of the oven and waiting a few minutes so I put them back in at warm (150 degrees) for another 20 minutes.   When the chips still didn't melt or spread, I went and bought another package of milk chocolate chips and melted in the microwave per the package instructions then spread the entire 11.5 ounces on top.  They tasted good (although a little dry after additional time in the oven) but if I make again, I will definitely use a whole bag of chocolate chips and melt in the microwave along with extra pecans.

I made it exactly as written.  It was ok, but don't think I'll make it again.  If I did, I'd make sure to line the pan with foil.  Even with spraying the pan, it was hard to get out.

Made exactly as written. Would recommend giving a temp to reach when making the caramel layer rather than a time frame to boil. Not at all like the picture.

I agree with the others that the caramel layer should be doubled, but one correction is that the butter and brown sugar should be equal, not more butter. My caramel turned out part caramel, part unincorporated butter. The chocolate chip layer should be also doubled to get a solid layer. Despite that, my sister devoured them! Toasting the pecans may also be a good idea along with a light sprinkling of chopped pecans on top of the chocolate! Mmm!

These were just ok. I also doubled the Carmel, added additional pecans and chocolate chips. The crust was delicious but the Carmel layer seemed very grainy. Wasn't sure if I should have doubled the cooking time for the Carmel so I didn't. Did anyone else have that problem?

I read the reviews and increased the flour to 2 cups for the crust. The butter/brown sugar filling tastes like more of a toffee. I also doubled the chocolate for the top. I did have some problem with chocolate separating from the crust on some pieces as I was cutting them into bars. Next time I make these I will double or triple the butter/brown sugar filling and see how that turns out. That's for the recipe :)

Best the second day. I thought they were far too greasy when I first tried to serve them but the next day they were delicious. Next time I will use at least a third less butter.

Love these! Every time I make them they get devoured. I double the caramel  part of the recipe & sprinkle flaked coconut on the crust before adding the caramel and baking. It tastes good with milk, semi-sweet & cinnamon chocolate chips.

I should have read reviews first.  My crust was like a thick cake batter.  Definitely more flour and maybe some ground oatmeal or ground pecans to give it some texture.  They are delicious, but I need to make a few changes.  I wish there was a way to make notes on the recipes that you save!

Oh baby. 
I read about 20 reviews before making these...  I doubled the "caramel" portion (also added vanilla) and added an additional cup of chocolate chips..  I have probably eaten a whole row myself. I have a new addiction.  I also tried these when they were warm.. oh man. 
Next time I make these, I will look for salted pecans.. and do a mixture of dark chocolate and milk chocolate for the topping. 
Thanks for the recipe :)

These were addictive! Followed others advice using 2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 cups of pecans and 2 cups of chocolate chips. The only thing I would do differently would be to use 1/2 cup of butter instead of 2/3 with brown sugar mixture. The butter oozed to the top after baking and made it difficult to spread the chocolate.

I won first prize in my office cookie/sweet holiday contest. Taste like real turtles. I double the caramel filling and ended up adding more chocolate, let melt and spread chocolate once it had cooled a bit, then stuck into the freezer for 10-15 min before cutting into bars.

The general makeup of these bars I love, but I will make some major tweaks when I make these again. The shortbread crust needs some adjustment, it has a good butter flavor but the texture is off. The caramel has too high of a butter:sugar ratio and was a little weak in flavor, I do think it needs to be doubled. For my tastes, I used bittersweet chocolate as these are super sweet to begin with. The first time I made this I used a full two cups flour, dark chocolate, and a double batch of the written caramel and if that was the recipe I would have given it four stars. Thanks for sharing.

Did as many here suggested and doubled the flour mixture and they came out great! I also did the Sweetened Condensed Milk caramel (a can of SCM in its can (with label off),covered in water and cooked in a crockpot for 8 hours)thinned out with some milk and it worked beautifully, though I may do 2 cans next time.

These are super rich so a small bar suffices :)

Doubled recipe, baked in jelly roll pan for 25minutes.  Did not have brown sugar so for doubled recipe used 3cups white sugar AND 1cup molasses (total). Lined pan with aluminum foil then lined that pan with parchmant paper; was very easy to remove and slice after they were cooled. Will make again! Thank you, Marlyn.

Very good, very rich and satisfying.  My family described it as "caramel pecan fudge with chocolate on top".  The only change I made was after I finished making the caramel sauce on the stove, I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of cream.

These taste phenomenal! I had intended to follow the recipe exactly; however, when I got to the step of sprinkling on the chocolate chips, I found that I did have to use 2 cups of chocolate chips rather than 1 in order to cover the entire surface area. I also baked these in a 9X9 square springform pan. This resulted in a thicker cookie crust which was crunchy and delicious. Also, with the springform pan, it was super easy to slide the entire finished product onto a cutting board!

I took these to work for the holidays and they were a hit. They are VERY rich so make sure you cut them small. I did use 2 c. of flour in the base instead of the 1 1/2 cups also. It is necessary. Make sure you use butter instead of margarine. It will be a richer yummy flavor and not a greasy blob. Very easy to assemble. I used my food processor for the base and it was a whiz to make.

So after reading all of the recommendations, I used 2 c. flour, 2 c. chocolate chips and 1 1/2 c. pecans per numerous recommendations. This is in addition to doubling the butter/brown sugar mix. As a result they were a total bust. Buy doubling the brown sugar/butter mix it just seeps into the crust making it way too sweet, its like eating straight sugar...yuck! And I LOVE anything sweet or chocolately. Also, by using 2 c. of chocolate chips its just way too much chocolate, it takes away from the rest of the dessert. Should have just followed the recipe and avoided the recommendations. Waste of money on my part.

I followed the advice of Katie JL and the squares did not turn out as she said.  The semisweet chocolate chips and the butterscotch chips did not spread as they were supposed to.  So I ended up with lumpy topping.

I just made this recipe after reading all the reviews, however I was a confused when reviewers said they doubled the caramel layer!  It calls for 2/3 cup of butter which is almost 11 tablespoons so you doubled that and used 22 tablespoons of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar? I decided to use my old standby caramel sauce of 1 cup brown sugar to 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter and whisked it together. I also used 2 cups flour, crushed my pecans with a rolling pin, and used almost a whole bag of milk chocolate chips. Still cooling but I can't stop picking at them.  Yummy!

I doubled the caramel recipe and still did not have enough.  I let the chocolate chips melt on top of the caramel and then spread them - big mistake.  The chocolate became grainy and ugly.  Next time I will premelt and avoid any spreading.

I had problems with the chocolate topping.  I had about 3/4 cup semi sweet and 3/4 cup white chocolate chips that I mixed, since that was all I had.  The white choc chips didn't melt--I don't know why not.  If anyone has comments, I'd appreciate it.  These were so easy to make and yummy despite the mess that I'll try again with milk choc chips and cross my fingers!

This is a good recipe and very easy to make.  I doubled the filling as others suggested and my husband can't stop eating them.  I hope I have some left for Christmas!

I had to try these!  I doubled the recipe as was suggested in earlier reviews, which worked well.  However, I am not the best at following directions, so I cooked the chocolate and poured it on before baking the crust.  Just letting others know out there drooling at this recipe that although it wasn't pretty to look at, my first attempt was still very edible!   Yes I will be using this recipe frequently!  Like when I hand the honey my "honey do" list.. Still drooling in WA.

Loved this cookie!!  So easy to make.  I doubled recipe and put in a jelly roll pan.  I added 3 cups choc chips on top and used 2 1/2 cups pecans. It made 70 squares, plenty to share and plenty for me!

Before I started these I lined my pan with foil. This made for a much easier removal and cutting process in the end ;). I just used a milk chocolate bar instead of chips and broke it into the individual squares, lined off the top with them and didn't bother to swirl the chocolate after it softened because it was already covering the whole pan. When it hardened up I decided to cut the "bars" into bite sized pieces using the chocolate squares as a guide. They came out so delicious! OMGosh! I will be making these very often. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This is delicious!  I altered the recipe according to reviews, by mistake, and to my own taste but I never would have made them in the first place if the recipe hadn't been here to start with.  So THANK YOU!  I used 2 c flour.  Because I read the recipe wrong, I added an extra 1/2 c sugar to the base.  (I wouldn't do this on purpose though because I doubt it would matter.)  I doubled the carmel layer plus I sprinkled on some toffee chips.  I sprinkled on the 1 c of pecans, then filled in the spaces with peanuts.  Then I subbed peanutbutter chips instead of using chocolate.  I am so in love with these!

This was really yummy. I didn't think it was all that greasy either. maybe a little less butter would have been ok, but it turned out just fine made as stated. I brougt these to my behavorial research lab and half the pan was gone......I only have like 12 people in my lab! I cut them into SMALL pieces (maybe 1.5 in. sq.) and they weren't too overwhelming. will make again and again!!!

I made these for Christmas and they couldn't have been easier.  Of all the cookies I made, this is the one my family goes for first--even my tried and true traditional family favorites.  Will definitely make these again and again.

All Recipes has come to my rescue once again!  I wanted to make a pecan pie but had run out of eggs. Still craving pecans, I searched for an eggless pecan dessert and found this recipe.  I followed the advise of previous reviewers and used 2 c. flour.  And not having any more than 1/2 c. remaining butter for the caramel mixture, I added about 4 tablespoons of a thick butterscotch caramel dessert topping while it was boiling.  Because I love white chocolate with caramel-pecan anything, I used it in place of the milk chocolate to spread over the bars. Note: Since white cocolate is sometimes difficult to melt, I put 1 1/2 c white chocolate chips in the microwave on half heat, stirring several times during the process to avoid seizing. I then drizzled the melted chocolate over the cookie bars.  I am now thankful that I ran out of eggs!  This recipe, with just a couple tweaks, is super yummy.

So yummy! I was short on a couple ingredients, so here is how I made do:
-short on butter, add some peanut butter (this only works in the brown sugar mixture)
-short on chocolate chips, add some white chocolate chips.

I am so confused! The butter and brown sugar mixture barely covered half of the crust and I had to hurry up and cook another batch so there would be enough. And yes, I realize that 2/3 cup of butter is more than one cube. They came out really good in the end though.
