We had to grill these indoors on the stove griddle due to rain. However, the flavor combination was excellent and both my husband and I enjoyed these!

Trying this for the first time at the Memorial Day picnic... sounds like a hit, sitting beside an arugula salad and chicken thighs.

6.27.18 They were good but didn’t knock my socks off.  Not totally enamored of the savory aspect, ended up adding just a little honey.  Enjoyed, but not sure I’d make again.

Nice taste with the sweet and savory flavours.  The only thing I didn't like was the texture of the skin.  I think these would be great served with pork.

EASY FAST Loved these. Can make ahead ,refrigerate ,
put  on BarBQ while eating and they are done. Have
made several times this summer and love them. Ice Cream
I am sure would be good but not necessary. I do sprinkle just a touch of brown sugar .

My husband likes peaches and did like these but he wasn't over the moon. Probably won't make again.

Love the peaches.  I alternate this recipe with another adding brown sugar or honey.

Both are excellent with chicken or pork, fish dishes.

Superb - only thing challenging was pitting them - they were a smash hit
