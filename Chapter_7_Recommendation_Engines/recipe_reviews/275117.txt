I love yeasted cakes, and this was no exception! I had to add quite a bit more flour to get the right consistency, so be aware of that. It was barely sweet, which was fine by me. Next time, though, I might be more generous with the sugar on top. I would love to try adding cinnamon or cardamom to the dough for more flavor next time. Those are my favorite spices to pair with peaches.

Had to add more flour and felt it was still too sticky and baked up too thick.  I should have spread it out in a jelly roll pan as the Peach Cake I grew up with in Baltimore was cut in approx. 6x8 inch  thin rectangles from a large flat pan.  I have tried several recipes sorta playing on the same theme and they are all too thick.  I am curious if anyone has really tried these recipes who knows how Baltimore Peach Cake is suppose to be. Next year I shall try again with my jelly roll pan. I did break my fear of baking with yeast.  Simons Bakery in Cockeysville is still selling their marvelous perfect authentic peach cake.  Chef John maybe you could treat yourself and try Simons.  The Best!!!!!  Thank you for the great video.  It helped me know what I was doing was correct with the sticky think dough resulting.
