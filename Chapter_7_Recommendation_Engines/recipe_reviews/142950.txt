I liked these....me and my hubby grill or even bake yellow onions all the time.  These were a nice change...could not even eat with dinner as we ate them before dinner was even ready. Just for those of you who have never grilled or baked onions, they loose there kick and become sweet. I did not grill these just baked at 350 in a foil pack. Also, if you want you can use olive oil instead of butter. oh yeah...make sure you trim half of the green part so they aren't chewy

A great side for our meal.  A tip for storing green onions, put a small amount of water in a glass, put the roots of the green onion into the water.  Cover with a plastic bag and place in the fridge.

This works very well!  We have been making this for a few years now, but it was nice to find the exact recipe so they turn out perfect every time. Of course we will be using this again, thank you!
