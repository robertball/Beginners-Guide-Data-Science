Pearl of any dinner :) Really delicious.
But be sure to leave just a little space free when you put in the stuffing, otherwise the chicken might burst while roasting.
Also, I removed the front bone of the ribcage and the front ribs before stuffing - this way it was easier to cut it later.

This was excellent! I made this precisely as per recipe directions with the exception that I used pecans because I didn't have any pistachios. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the stuffing was to die for! A hit with my dinner guests.

This was amazingly delicious and a huge hit at my recent dinner party!  I couldn't find duck pate so used a mixture of chicken liver with truffle & pork pate and it was still just as yummy. So moist and the stuffing is delicious and decadent!

Great recipe :) I made this dish when having my amazing chef of a mother over for dinner and she asked for the recipe for the number of dinner parties she throws! Instead of using chicken I made it with a Cornish game hen, since it was only a meal for two.  I forgot the paprika, but it was still very rich and delicious...looked like something that would be served at a high end restaurant when it came out of the over.  Thanks for sharing!
