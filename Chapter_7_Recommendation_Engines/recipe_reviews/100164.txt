These came out fantastic! I SOOO didn't want to fry potatoes tonite and I only had 30 minutes until I wanted to be serving my bbq pork sammies and cole slaw, but needed something else for a side dish. I used my apple corer to make some quick potato wedges, covered 'em in water and threw 'em in the microwave for 5 min. I sprayed the baking sheet with oil, dried the taters with a paper towel and sprayed again with oil after putting them on the sheet, then sprinkled on the season salt. 25 min at 400 deg made these nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I WILL NEVER FRY POTATOES AGAIN!! Thanks so much :-)

I use Johnny's Seasoning Salt in this recipe and add a little fresh ground pepper. This is one of our favorite ways (and my go-to recipe) for jo-jo potatoes. There's never any leftovers.

so easy and tasty -- I tried it with the small golden potatoes -- yummy
2nd review -- tonight I used russet potatoes and soaked the peeled and sliced potatoes in four cups of water and 3/4 cup sugar for about 15-20 minutes.  Dried them on a dish towel and then followed the rest of this recipe.  Crispier.  Very good.

These are pretty good despite the fact that I accidentally went overboard with the salt..woops! The kids went crazy for these 'hot chippies' as we call them here. They seemed to take forever to brown so don't make them if you're in a hurry. I left the skins on too which worked rather well.

I love potatoes, and this is an easy way to fix them!  I use olive oil instead of vegitable oil and I love how they turn out!

Hmm...Well, I've never had fries from a truck on the street, but these weren't half bad.  My husband said they were surprisingly good...and he is a potato connisseur.  I would probably make them again...but personally I prefer the bagged fries from the frozen foods department at the grocery store.

Simple way to make homemade French fries without frying them.  I very seldom make fries, so my family was thrilled to see these on the dinner table.  I cut them thin so they would be crispy (the way my family enjoys them) and used less oil.  I put the fries on the cookie sheet and lightly drizzled with oil until they were coated and then added the seasoned salt.  I did flip 2 times while baking to achieve the color and crispiness I wanted.  Family loved them, and that is all that mattered.  The fries were served with ‘BAR CHICKS – Blackened Chicken Sliders’ another AR recipe.  I would make fries with this recipe again.

Made these last night & followed the exact recipe. They were a hit! I will try them next time with EVOO. Thank you for such a simple recipe! Now I don't have feel bad serving my family the processed frozen fries from the grocery store.

I love making "fries" this way! I usually add garlic powder and they are so, so yummy!!! We call them steak fries because they are so thick and hearty! Play around with the seasonings you use on them. My hubby likes them spicy but my daughter and I love the garlic. Go with what you love!

45 minutes is way too long. The fries were black and too hard to eat when I took them out.

Everyone went back for seconds.  I'll make again, but think I overdid veg. oil (didn't measure) so they could've been crispier.

We only had 2 potatoes (2 servings calls for 3). Normally I'm not a big fan of fries like this, but I loved these, so did my husband!

Sounds allot like Dicks fries (a small awesome fast food restaurant where you park, walk up to the order window [that's outside] then go eat in your car; that is [unfourtionally] only in the Seattle area in WA, the North West US Washington, not Washington DC) (DICKS IS AWESOME!) So, anyways, the fries sound really good!!!

I made these today using Yukon Gold potatoes and used Seasoned salt and vegetable oil. They came out great. We cooked them for 20 minutes and then flipped them over and cooked them for another 20 minutes. I also sprayed the cookie sheet which ensured they did not stick. I think this is a great recipe. For the next time I will maybe use a different seasoning to try, something spicier, like Cajun seasoning.

Fast, easy and delicious!  Made them for supper tonight and they were a huge hit!  I added some cayenne to the seasoned salt just to spice it up a bit, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as is.

First, I would like to tell the "most critical" that different ovens may cook differently.  You are supposed to turn them once or twice if you like and WATCH them.  They were really good and I cooked only two. for myself .  So good that I will have them when I do a cook-out for my grands. No, there was no reason to tweek the recipe.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME fries.  I used enough EVOO to just lightly coat all the potatoes.  I single-layered them on a cookie sheet and LIGHTLY sprinkled them with seasoning salt.  I cooked them for about 50-60 minutes because I like them extra crispy.

I thought these were okay. They didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Also, I am not sure why, but most of mine wanted to stick. The insides were soft like mashed potatoes, while the outside was chewy instead of crispy.

Great idea! I cut mine a little smaller because I just used two potatoes, but this was a great way to avoid the hot boiling oil thing :-)

I don't know why but these turned out a lot better than any other baked fries I have tried before. Maybe I'm just getting better at it... I baked them for 20 mins and another 15  mins after flipping them over. Result nicely browned and crisp.

It was a bit salty but that was easily fixed, I microwaved it for 5 minutes in a bowl of water before I baked to speed up the process. For some reason it took a while to brown....

They tasted pretty good but some of them came out burn so they probably don't need to be in the oven for as long as the recipe says.

I cooked mine for 23 mins then flipped them over and cooked another 10 minutes so a total of 33 minutes and they were fine. Very good flavor. Used half vegetable oil and half olive oil. Also made half with skins and half without and both were yummy

I LOVE french fries but I HATE frying.  This is my solution now.  I cut them 1/4" as the recipe stated but they're done in 35 min.  Thank you for sharing!

I made these tonight and the family loved them. We added cheddar cheese, bacon, jalapeños and sour cream. Holy moly it was killer.  But we even enjoyed them plain.

This is a delicious and healthy alternative to frying your french fries.
Took anothers suggestion and soak before preparing for crispier fries.
