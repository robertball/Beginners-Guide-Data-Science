This soup is tasty!! I made on New Year's Eve to enjoy the next day. I used dried black eyed peas but followed directions on bag of peas with regards to soaking them by boiling and letting them sit. I always add time to soaking. I drained, washed the peas and picked through the soaked peas. This is an important process and step to do. I followed the directions except will add Kale upon reheating the soup today instead of cooking with spinach and used dried parsley (a smaller amount , few shakes from container of parsley)In addition added 2 cups more vegetable broth. While simmering for 2 hrs I put lid on Dutch oven. My daughter is a semi vegatarian so wanted to begin a new tradition with the luck of black eyed peas to accommodate her on New Years 2016! This is a keeper.

I made this tonight, and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I didn't have bay leaves or fresh parsley, so I threw in dried oregano, basil, and parsley.  I will definitely make this again!

I had all the ingredients except the black eyed peas & vegetable broth. Instead of the black eyed peas I used black beans and home made chicken broth. It came out tasty and hearty but with enouph liquid to enjoy the hearty vegetables. Kids LOVED it.

This was satisfying and tasty.  It pleased all of my picky eaters, vegetarians and meat eaters.  It had plenty of flavor without being spicy.  I subbed cabbage for the spinach for New Year's Day.  It  was easy to put together.  I did pre-soak the beans using the quick soak method on the bag, and cooked for the full time in the recipe; the beans were perfectly cooked.

Used parsnip instead of zucchini, but loved the heart warming flavors and  ease of preparation to make!  Great soup on a cold winter day, but I bet it would taste just as good at any other time!  Thanks for the recipe!
