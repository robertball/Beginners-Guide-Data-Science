I have made these cookies several times and they are EXCELLENT with chocolate chips. I also substituted half the butter with applesauce once and it seemed to make no difference.  Very moist, almost cakelike in texture.  Zucchini-haters devoured these!

These cookies have a delicious spicy taste, and smell great while they're baking.  Mine spread too much even after adding additional flour and refrigerating the dough, but next time I'll do a better job of squeezing the moisture out of the zucchini.  I won't add the milk next time either.

Cake-like cookies. Followed the recipe to the T, good cookies, next time I think I'll add more zucchini & maybe increase the spices.

GREAT cookies. I made them healthier by replacing half the butter with apple sauce, lowering the ammount of brown sugar, and using whole wheat flour. Taste great with chocolate chips/rasins, will definately make again!!!

Fantastic - cakelike, but that's exactly what I was looking for - I cut the sugar in half and added chocolate chips, they weren't runny at all (I didn't squeeze out the zucchini) & my household is gobbling them up!

These were good, a good way to use up extra zucchini.  I used half applesauce and half butter.  The dough was really thin, I left out the milk and added 1 cup oatmeal and a little more flour.  They ended up not spreading as much as I thought.  I recommend two teaspoons orange zest, the one teaspoon gets lost in the cookies.

They remind me of little zucchini breads. I didn't add anything but the cinnoman and zucchini too it and I thought they needed a little more cinnoman. Also, they were better cooked longer then 15 minutes..about 17. But still good.

These were delicious! I enjoyed the addition of the orange zest. It makes these stand out. These cookies ARE cakey. Any type of zucchini cookie will be. If you don't LIKE cakey cookies, move on. These were very moist. Don't remove water from your zucchini when making these, and be careful not to overbake. Both can lead to dryness. Thanks for sharing!

This may come as a shock - I didn't have any zucchini! What I did have was some cut off kernels (cream style) of  leftover corn-on-the-cob, so I substituted it and the cookies came out great! I don't often recommend substitutions of major ingredients, but it worked out just fine!

I tried this recipe because I had left over grated zucchini from making my zucchini bread.  The orange zest intrigued me so I tried it.  I read the reviews and this is what worked for me.  I omitted the milk and decreased the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp.  and also drained the zucchini as I had already done for the bread.  These cookies are delicious as is or would also taste great with a drizzle of icing.  Will make again:-)

Nice soft cookie. I added a bit more cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg as i like a lot of spice. Made 24 medium sized cookies.

Very good healthy cookie.  I also had to cook mine for closer to 20 minutes to get them the least bit brown on top.  I tried adding a handful of oats to one batch and that was yummy too.

These ARE VERY LIGHT, and they are flavorful. Just don't end up with a final product that temps your taste buds for more.  It's a simple cookie with good flavor.  I ended up baking them for more than the 10 minutes, but it could just be my oven. They need something to either make them a little heavier or something that will add another flavor level. Not sure that I'll make them again; however, I appreciate having another way to use up the zucchini from the garden.

Love 'em.  I substituted whole wheat flour, Sucanat (unrefined sugar), hemp milk, and I omitted the nuts & orange peel & these still turned out delicious!  I think the spices are the key- smells great cooking & very tasty.  They do spread a lot, but did not go completely flat, and they are very soft & cake like.  I used one medium zucchini to get 1 1/2 c. grated.

I followed this recipe exactly except I omitted the walnuts due to personal preference. The dough was more like a batter for me, so I just spread it in the pan and baked it, and they came out with a brownie type texture. I didn't hand grate the zucchini, I used my food processer. Rather then dry shreds, I ended up with a more watery puree so I'm sure that's why I ended up with a batter. I will try this recipe again because the flavor was delicious.

Not at all happy with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so runny I couldn't use it.  I added flour, but that just made them doughy.  It might work if you add oatmeal, but I just don't think it would help.

I have made these cookies twice now. I replaced the butter with Greek yogurt, used whole wheat flour, and doubled the spices. I added another 1/2 cup of zucchini and 2 shredded carrots. The cookies came out great. A little less sweet than I expected, but still great.

I loved your spice cookies even though I made one subsitution. Instead of brown sugar I used Splenda brown sugar. I made 4 batches, one for home and 3 for our church" fall festival and I did not have one left and every one was raving over them and had no idea they were good for them with the veggies.

I love this! I added up all the calories for this and it's high in calories so I would recommend replacing the butter for applesauce, use less or use splenda brown sugar, and use skim milk! It's almost a 1,000 difference over all and almost 20 calorie deference per cookie! Plus use a tablespoon to measure the cookies and make sure it exactly 1 tablespoon if you want 48 cookies. I did what it said in the directions and ended up with only about 36 cookies.

I left out the raisins and orange zest because of personal preference, and these were still delicious!
Moist, cake-like, and could barely tell the zucchini was in there.
YUM!
