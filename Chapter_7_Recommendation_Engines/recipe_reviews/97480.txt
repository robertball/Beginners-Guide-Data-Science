We loved this. We found the calabres cheese at the Spanish Table and, while we were there, picked up a couple bottles of Spanish red (a Rioja and a Ribera del Duero). They were both good matches. But we kept gravitating toward the Rioja, which had been too much wine the night before with the Pollo al Ajillo (also on Allrecipes) -- the Ribera was the better match with the chicken.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  The missing star is because the sauce was very runny but I will play around with it next time.  This is a great special occasion meal.

This meal was full of flavor and talk about tender meat! I love the idea of adding cheese to the sauce to give the sauce an additional layer of flavor. My kudos to the originator of this recipe.

This is possibly the best recipe I've ever taken from this website. I started making it about 5 months ago and my family absolutely loves it. It's a regular meal in our home. I think the sauce is a great unique taste which I love. I will definitely continue making this recipe and sharing it with our friends and family! Thanks Pippymoe!

Delicious! Sadly, wasn't able to find the cheese so, used regular blue cheese. Still yummy! Will do it again but, want to find that cheese. Thank you!

Love this recipe. I can't find Spanish blue cheese, but it works great with regular crumbled blue cheese that I get at the local grocery.

I needed a quick way to prepare some tenderloin and was thrilled to find  this to try.  The short ingredient list won me over, too.  We have the Rogue Creamery nearby, so we had lots of blue cheese to use up.  Since the flavor of the cheese is so intense, I used only about 2 oz., but found that enough to make the sauce very flavorful. I used some homemade dry Gewurztraminer, which worked beautifully. This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing it!

I wanted to make this sauce, but for beef cooked on the grill.  So, rather than starting with beef in the pan, I melted a little butter and beef base, then used that to cook the onions and start the sauce.  Other than that, followed recipe pretty much exactly as written here.  It was really very good!  
I should also mention that I did not have time to seek out special variety of blue cheese, I used grocery store variety and it worked well enough.  I would love to try again with even better cheese.

Made this last night and we all loved it, including my picky 12year old son. I made it without the blue cheese as we keep kosher and it was still fab! I was a bit worried about putting a whole tablespoon of paprika, but thats what the recipe calls for and it was perfect. P.S. It was my first time making a tenderloin so i was nervous!

I tried this recipe.  It was simply delicious.  The blue cheese added a burst of flavor.  I don't use wine in my cooking, so I added a bit more of the beef broth.  It was easy to make and tasted like it was prepared at a 5 star restaurant.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Thank you Pippiemoe.
