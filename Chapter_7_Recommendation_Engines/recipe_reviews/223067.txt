Really good, thick bread. Cooked it for exactly 80 min and it came out soft & moist. I left out the applesauce because i didn't have any on hand and used about 3 med sized bananas. Also used Rum extract since i didn't have any coconut. Bread had good flavor, and is not a very sweet bread at all. Would be really good for breakfast with a cup of coffee. I also agree on doubling  the topping because there could of been more to cover the loaf. Also i used powdered sugar instead of white sugar for the topping.

This cake was very moist and heavy.  For some reason the center did not cook very well and I left it in the oven longer than needed.
