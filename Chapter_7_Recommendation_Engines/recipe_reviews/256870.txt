I made a change and started with a small pan to sauté 2 garlic cloves minced , 2 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 2 teaspoon sriracha sauce, 2 teaspoon soy sauce and added a small amount of green onion finely chopped sauté 5 minutes.  Place 4 salmon filets in a 8x11 baking dish spray with cooking oil, pour half the honey mixture on salmon, baked 10 minutes...pour rest on honey mixture on salmon and baked 5 minutes longer.  After its out of the oven cover with foil and rest 5 minutes.  Enjoy.

The glaze wasn't as thick as I would like. I would try leaving out the water next time. I doubled the recipe and had some extra sauce to go on rice. Yum!

Delicious! I made this for my boyfriend and he said it was the best salmon he’s ever had. :) I would alter how you cook the salmon, though. Look up Gordon Ramsey's youtube video on cooking salmon and it'll be perfect.

Once the honey glaze cools off, it becomes very sticky, almost candy like. But the flavor waas amazing

This was really good! Left out the Siricha sauce and reduced the water by half, and it very tasty! Yes, I will make this again!

Yes I made it according to the recipe and it was great. I added some chopped onions and red peppers.  Truly awesome. I also tweaked the recipe a bit making it with chicken wings instead of salmon. Also fantastic.

This was a last-minute find.  Was going to make the Salmon with lemon dill.  This popped up, I had all the ingredients.  I'm not one for fish but tasted it and it was delicious.

This recipe was very simple and I loved that you didn’t have to marinate the salmon first.  We added more sriracha, but we are a very spicy family.  We also thought that the sauce would work for chicken as well.  We will definitely make this recipe again.
