Oh wow! Super tasty and I feel good about myself when eating this. I didn't have any cherries on hand so I used a small jar of cherry jam that wouldn't be missed and thus omitted the sugar. I also apparently thought that coffee creamer and half and half were the same thing...actually not so, but I used vanilla flavored creamer anyway and it turned out well. A little more icy in texture than if I had used more fat, but I feel better about eating it this way. I recommend adding some sort of vanilla flavor to this. The Greek yogurt I used made the texture creamy after the initial icy-ness. Thanks!

I don't really feel qualified to review since I screwed this recipe up royally. I’m going to have to call my version a granita. I didn’t realize what an ice cream attachment was so I just chopped up a couple of cups of frozen cherries in the food processor, added a can of sweetened condensed milk, ½ cup of milk, a tablespoon of sugar (or to taste), 2 cups of plain creek yogurt, and approx ½ cup Chambord. Mixed all that up and put it in a casserole dish. Every hour or so I scraped it up with a fork. It’s delicious and not too sweet. I’m looking forward to trying this basic recipe out with other combinations of fruits and liqueurs. I added the picture to this recipe. It’s so pretty.

Oh. My. Gosh.  This is beyond amazing!  I'm afraid that the two of us are going to finish the entire batch off before the day is over!  I used Chambord because it was the closest liquor to Creme de Cassis that my store had, and regular vanilla yogurt with 1T lemon juice to add the additional tartness that the Greek yogurt would have added.  I can imagine that the Creme de Cassis would provide an even stronger flavor that would be great, and will look for a bottle of that for my next batch.
