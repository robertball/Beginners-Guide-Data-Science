i kicked up the lime juice a bit and used chipolte pepper flakes instead of ancho because they are a bit smokier tasting and this was seriously amazing!

Fantastic!  Reminisent of corn served to us at a great Cuban restaurtant we found in Greenwich. Also made the recipe with no butter, served in a small bowl with dipping veggies, and it's wonderful as an appetizer.  Love this!

This was wonderful! We were skeptical, but it the flavor is perfection. We would possibly change the way we actually cook it the next time. I think we would cook it for just a few minutes on the grill for flavor, then add more butter and wrap it in foil to finish cooking it so as not to dry it out. We didn't have ancho chile so we used dried chipotle flakes instead.

This was okay. My kids would rather have just plain old corn on the cob. My boyfriend and I thought it was a good change. When the kids aren't around I'll probably make it again.
