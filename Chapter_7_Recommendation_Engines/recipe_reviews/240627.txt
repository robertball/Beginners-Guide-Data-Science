I cut this recipe in half, and although we liked it, I was expecting something that had more zing (its name is SPICY HOT Corn).  For us, there was too much of a mild/mellow cream cheese flavor.  I think it would have benefitted from the addition of a small can of green chiles or maybe more jalapeños.  It was just a little bland, but that may be a personal taste preference.  We did enjoy it!

I’m giving this 5 stars in hopes that others will give it a try. I read the other review (there’s only 1 at this time) that said it was bland and too cream-cheesy and that it needs more ‘zing’. I decided to add one more ingredient. I cooked up some real bacon until crispy, drained and crumbled it, and then mixed about 1/4 cup into the corn/onion/cheese mixture before baking it. My husband and son raved about it! I think the bacon give it the zing!
