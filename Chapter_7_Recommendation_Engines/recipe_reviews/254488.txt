Great idea. I used more apple cider and less water. Packed the turkey with cut up apples. Was moist and tender with a hint of apple.

Made as written except for the thyme. Fresh was sold out so I used dry. I let my turkey sit in the brine for a few days and it turned out super tender. This was a winner and one I will use again.

Turkey was moist, not too salty (rinsed) but browned great!

The apple cider brine was a huge hit for us this year. Everyone said this was my best Turkey dinner yet. I will definitely be using this again.

I added a about 10 garlic cloves and a large onion and a lil more pepper corns. I also used Himalayan pink salt. This is my go to brine every year and it’s always a hit. People always ask me if it’s chicken or turkey. Because it’s so moist.

this came out so delicious!  i scaled this back to 2 servings and used it on a whole chicken.. i upped the kosher salt to 3 tbsp.. i used dried herbs.. kept the amounts the same for the sage and rosemary.. but decreased the thyme to 1/8 tsp.. subbed coarse ground black pepper for the peppercorns.. and brined for a full 24 hours.. strained and had bf grill the bird.. bf hit it a couple of times with some pam to make the skin extra crispy.. it was awesome.. ty for the recipe
