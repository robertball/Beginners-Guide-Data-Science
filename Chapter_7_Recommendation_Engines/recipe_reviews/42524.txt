This was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

I thought this was pretty good but I wanted more flavor so I added an envelope of dry Italian seasoning and some pepperocini's.  I topped each sandwich with a slice of provelone cheese and grilled the buns under the broiler.  Everyone loved them.  Will definitely make this a regular item.

This was actually pretty good.  Very easy to make.  Both hubby and I gave it a 4 star review.  Knowing my hubby I thought that he would probably want some kind of sauce with it so I made a Marinara Sauce to go with it.  Put it over the top.  Without the marinara I made the recipe exactly as posted.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh BTW I used the Fabulous French Loaves recipe and made it into rolls.  Very good

This recipe was very tasty and very easy to prepare. My husband just loved it and so did I. I will be making this again.

Took Graden's advice & made as written with the exception of adding the dry Italian Seasoning & the Pepperocini's. I did add the Monterey Jack cheese & broiled for a few minutes until melted & lightly browned. Need to drain really well before putting on the bread. Messy, but very good.

Not horrible, not great.  I made some changes based on the reviews.  I used a little less sausage to cut down on the fat and added some tomato sauce to the meat mixture for flavor and some garlic.  I sprinkled the veggies with Italian seasoning.  I put it on high for 3 hours and low for 1 hour.

These were pretty good.  I would give it around a 3 star and my husband around a 5 star, so we are going middle ground with 4.  The only reason I would give it 3, is because I'm not a huge fan of Italian sausage to being with.  I made this with ground turkey and ground turkey hot Italian sausage and it wasn't greasy at all.  I also added some marinara sauce to the sandwiches before serving and that was really good.  Next time I make them, maybe I'll use more ground turkey and less sausage (just because of my personal preference).

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and have doubled it for company.  It's very yummy and so easy.  I make roasted potatoes with it and a salad.  Love it!!!

More than edible, but my boyfriend (who does most of the eating of the crock pot recipes I make) says it needs MORE of something.  He says it was really good and had potential, but it could have been better.  Next time, I'll add some more seasoning and see how he likes it.
