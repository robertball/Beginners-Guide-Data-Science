Because I've made these for over 40 years, I know that to try and form these into wreaths would be a lot of effort since these set up so fast. I just drop them into small, teaspoon size mounds. When my kids were young, they made the task of making these much easier--the extra set of hands to put the cinnamon candies on them were a real help! While I make these a bit differently, I write this review for those who are experiencing these stiffening up or hardening too fast. A little extra butter will take care of that. To 4 cups of corn flakes I use 1/3 c. butter and 32 marshmallows. For a brilliant green color, I use 1 tsp. of green food coloring, again for 4 cups of corn flakes.  Finally, I add 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and almond extracts for flavor. These have always been a family favorite and are a pretty and colorful addition to a Christmas cookie platter.

My aunt use to make these when I was little so I gave them a try.  They came together nicely.  I followed the recipe exactly and put the bowl in a larger bowl with a little hot water to keep the mixture soft.  They are very pretty on a cookie tray as they have a bright green color.  They do not freeze or last long as they get a little mushy (at least in my house) so I would make these just a few days before Christmas or the event you are taking them to.  Thanks for this recipe from my childhood!

My kids loved it.   They expanded on the Christmas idea by making Christmas trees from the mixture and sprinkling it with colored candy sprinkles, gold and silver candy balls etc.  Really added color to the Christas cookie platter.

Very festive looking but I found it difficult to form into wreaths not only because the marshmallow starts to stiffen but also because the Corn Flakes make for a much less dense mixture which doesn't hold together as nicely. They taste ok, but in the future I'll just be sticking with Rice Krispies.

I used these for a baby shower for twins.  I used pink and blue food coloring and shaped them into baby booties and pacifiers.  You can use molds and press the mixture into the mold as well.  They were a hit.

Great gobs of green glue! Okay, having made rice crispy treats, I should have known what I was in for. But forming it into circles and trying to get the red hots to stick cranked up the difficulty factor. The only thing that saved me was greasing my finger tips between spoonfuls. They are festive looking. Not a cookie for amateurs to make.

this is a great recipe!!! i add a tsp of vanilla to hide some of the food coloring taste as there is just a hint of it for the discerning palate. it's easy to work with and really i have no problem with it holding together or any of some of the other concerns i've read about here. i've been making holiday treat trays for family and friends for longer than i care to say and this is always a winner for young and old and what an eye catcher!!! my picture is lousy as for color as it was taken with my cell phone at the last minute and will be replaced so u can get a better idea of how outstanding this really looks. i also make these the size of the tray and then fill the middle with a tall round container filled with goodies and wrap that all to go for each guest on our family and friends nite at our house!! each guest leaves with a tray big enough to gain 20#'s or so!! lol!!! for most of them it's the hilight of the evening and they are usually sniffing around them all night to see what they recieved!!!

We actually did not eat most of these that we made.  They were cute but I think I left them out too long cuz they got really hard.  I made them with my 3 kids, ages 4-9, and really the mixture is too hot for them to handle straight out the pan so I had to form the wreaths.  They got to put the red hots on though.

These are great!  The way to avoid the hardening is to remove the mixture from the heat as soon as the marshmallows are almost completely melted and not a moment longer.  If you cook the mallows too long you are sure to have a beautiful, but very hard treat.

These were so easy and very holiday-y looking! I would use only 1/3 cup butter next time, they were pretty greasy (perhaps I sprayed too much pam on my cookie sheet to make them not stick). Great recipe though, thanks for sharing a great addition to my holiday baking!

I have never used a recipe for these, but my Mom did these with us every Christmas, starting about 1990!  The only difference we would make wreaths the full plate sized, and still use the Red Hots on them for the decorations, and give them as gifts!  I have been making them ever since... and every year instead of trying to figure out what to get everyone on my list, my family makes these wreaths and another plate with Fudge, Divinity, cookies, and other goodies!  They are a big hit every year, and every year I have more and more people that ask when we are going to make them... they can't wait for their goodie plates each year!

I was so glad to find this recipe!  My stepmother and I made these at Christmas time a year before she passed away, and the family loved them!  I didn't think I would ever find this recipe.

I didn't take the time to shape them into wreaths and they still looked nice. I just dropped them from a spoon on to waxed paper and put a few candies on each one.  Very easy, fast, and tasty!

I just made my first batch but changed it some.  I made one wreath on a cookie sheet, used Total Whole Grain Flakes added 1/2 tsp Almond Extract and decorated the top with M & M red and green candies, miniature edible decorative red and white candy canes and sprinkled green and clear large grains of sugar.  Next time I will not use the green food coloring since it stained my fingers and hands, will mix green sprinkles in the mixture and will mix 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract and decorate the top the same way.  Actually this recipe is a good idea except for the green food coloring which myself and others probably wouldn't want stained hands and fingers after eating.
