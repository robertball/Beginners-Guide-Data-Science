This was excellent a great meal for a big crowd. It made gallons of gravy which is a plus!! A couple of hints: I used a meat thermometer in the pork loin so it doesn't overcook and become dry. 170 degrees is perfectly done. I omitted the cloves (not to my taste) and when making the gravy I threw about 1/3 cup of flour in the blender with everything else and then cooked it all together on the stove for a few minutes to help it thicken. Delicious on mashed potatoes!

This recipe is fantastic and the gravy at the end is just well GRAVY! However we should be clear that the beer you use matters! Obviously you should try different kinds to see what you like best but for me this recipe was 10x better with a porter than with a Bud Lite. Also 4 cloves was too much for my taste. two was perfect! Overall great recipe that allows you the flexibility to make it your own! This will be a regular for my home when we entertain!

My kids loved this but they are not picky eaters. My gravy was thick when it came time to blend so I added some chicken stock to make more gravy and simmered it down to re-thicken. We served it over mashed potatoes and it was really good. Can't wait for my husband to eat it!

This was fabulous! I used a lodge Dutch oven. Two changes of note. I added an apple to the minced veggies as well as some garlic. The sauce at the end was fantastic when spooned over the thick slices of pork. Apples go well with pork.

Excellent meal! Came out much better than expected. The pork was particularly tender and moist. Used parsnips instead of carrots and the sauce was very sweet. Will use this recipe again.

An amazingly easy dish to cook and for a beginner who would benefit from the 'feel' of how to braise. I replaced carrots with butternut squash which had been lurking at the rear of the fridge rather than open a new bag of carrots which would lurk My only concern is the 'searing' process which does tend to leave the end sections a bit harder than they should be. Perhaps these sections should not be seared...or maybe I went OTT on it.

It came out quite bland and the meat was dry. I did use non-alcoholic beer and added an apple but I don't think that made the difference. I think that braising this very lean cut was the problem

This was delicious! My 3-1/2 lb pork loin only needed an hour to cook so I think suggestions to decrease cooking time in general are correct. The gravy was fabulous and I love how it sneaked some more veggies into my kids dinners. And I m really excited for ways to incorporate other vegetables I to it - I think any root vegetables would work easily to start.

Great dish extremely flavorful. Lots of gravy! I would caution to watch the time on your loin in the oven. 2 hours was a little long for mine. I added a cup of chopped celery to my veg mix and it was heavenly. Save a few of the vegetables to spoon over the plated dinner for an added texture.

The pork itself was very good -- moist as could be. The gravy though was rather sour (maybe I used the wrong beer?). Won't try it again.

Oh my gosh! We loved it. Very tasty and moist. Tender. We did not use cloves; however, just not a fovorite spice for us.
This is a must make dinner!

This was amazing. Both of our kids devoured it. I made it exactly as written but I cooked in a crockpot on high for 5 hours. Because of that I skipped the step of cooking the carrots and onions in the pan. Instead I placed them in the bottom of the crockpot and added the beer and other spices to them stirred it up and placed the pork loin right on top to cook. After that I followed the remaining directions that are written. Awesome meal. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again!

Amazing dish! I was a little bit concerned about the taste of the gravy but after adding a little bit of water it came out perfect. The meat was so tender and juicy. I'll definitely doing it again.

This was amazing! The gravy is the star, though, in my opinion. I reheated leftover gravy and ate it as soup. Delicious!
