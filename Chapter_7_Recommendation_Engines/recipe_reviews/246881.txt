These are great and addictive- unfortunately still really good out of the freezer, where I chose to hide them so I wouldn't eat too many! I like using the mini chocolate chips- easier to roll. Also have added other nuts instead- walnuts, almonds or pecans, as well as coconut and flax seed meal.

Made these for a football party and they were eaten up in no time. Several people asked for the recipe. Iâ€™d definitely make them again.

Awesome, easy to make. The second time I made them I added M&M's. Did not use chopped peanuts either time. Rave reviews from everyone

I loved these except for one thing- I'm not a huge honey fan. I may try to add slightly less next time, but not enough to change the recipe drastically. For anybody using honey, I always spray the cup/spoon with cooking spray to keep the honey from entirely sticking to it.

I was surprised how simple and tasty this recipe was. Both my husband and I found it to be very good!
