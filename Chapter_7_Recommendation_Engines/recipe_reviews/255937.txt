Add some chopped walnuts and maple syrup for a special treat.  Molasses (unsulphured) makes these pancakes a good for you treat and you won't need much syrup.  Cook on a lwer temperature for a little longer.  Cook about 4 minutes then  flip and cook for an about 3 more minutes.  Molassess is a good source of Potasium, Magnesium and Iron

Made it as directed. The default quantities are too much. The batter is too soupy for pancakes, more like a crepe batter. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature and congealed in the cold milk, leaving little lumps of oil to separate out in the pan. For the quantities involved they didn’t really leaven at all. If I were to make this again I would use butter or margarine, not coconut oil; halve the oil/butter, milk, molasses, and eggs, and use bout two cups of flour (by weight, not volume). Keep the spices, baking powder and soda about the same.

Well we should’ve read the reviews before moving forward - that way we would’ve known how many pancakes we were going to make. Yes, the recipe says it makes 10 pancakes and no, that’s not correct. We got THIRTY 4” pancakes, so I hope they freeze well. 
    Now for the taste review.... eh. They were good and cooked up fine, but if we make them again, we will double all the spices... and HALF the rest of the ingredients. Lol

Yum. I had gingerbread pancakes in a restaurant in Texas and waited forever to make them at home. Thank you so much for this recipe. It was simple and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen.

Yummy. Half a recipe made 13 medium-sized pancakes.  So... I feel servings(10) is a bit inflated-- I don't think 2-ish pancakes is a serving, or at least not at my house.  Anyway!  I substituted some buttermilk for the regular milk, tho I don't know if it made any difference.  These were nice and fluffy, and I will make this recipe again.

I used honey instead of molasses because my Mom and I don’t like molasses and it was good.

1st time. Mixed about 7:30pm and let sit on the sideboard until bedtime, then refrigerated overnight. I took the batter out at 6am next morning and let it come up to room temp, griddling at about 9:00am. Mr. Stanley said "Grammy, these are really good!"
I made 1/3 of the recipe and that is plenty for 3-4 servings of 3 or 4 3" pancakes.

Used Truvia vs sugar and 1/2  tsp salt. Batter was very thick so thinned to be able to pour from container. Served with apricot jam. Didn’t have pumpkin pie spice so used 1/4 tsp cloves and nutmeg.

Made these this morning and was very disappointed. The batter was soupy and for all the spices that were added, they didn’t even come close to tasting like gingerbread. They were flat and dense with very little flavor.

This makes a TON of batter.  It is way too much liquid to dry ratio.  It would have made 100 pancakes that were very thin. My kids didnt like them. Said it tasted like wet cookie.  However, the save was adding another cup of flour and cup of organic dark brown sugar and baked it in a bundt pan. ( I also didnt have coconut oil so just used veg oil which after reading other reviews sounds like a good move..wish I had read reviews!) Tastes like a very moist ginger sweet bread. Added a frosting glaze and my daughter and husband loved it. My son was still a no.
