I liked how the cake turned out, however, just to warn bakers like me the ingrediants list included milk but in the directions it does not say to add milk. I added it anyway and the cake turned out lovely. The icing did not turn out very well at all (it was like water so I am wondering if the recipe was right) and that's why I am only giving a 3 out of 5.

My family loved this cake!  I did make a couple of changes.  Instead of adding a 1/2 c milk, I used grapefruit juice. For the glaze, I used powdered sugar mixed with grapefruit juice.

This site introduced me to spice cake. It's an alternative to everyday, sugary cakes, so  I'm on the lookout for other spice cakes. This gave me memories of my mother's sugar cookies. The grapefruit was very subtle. Next time, I'll increase the grapefruit juice. While this was baking, my kitchen smelled good. The glaze was watery and it soaked right in, but that was fine with me. The glaze may not be needed anyway. Next time, I won't make it to see if it adds to the cake's flavor.

It was great. I loved the  grapefruit flavor and glaze. I made a few changes. I made it as  cupcakes. I also made it gluten free. I used almond flour and a gluten free all purpose flour. I  changed the ratio to  1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 milk to the batter, to give it more grapefruit flavor.  I used a Penzeyâ€™s Pie spice instead of cinnamon.  I cooked it a shorter time, 25-30 minutes for cupcakes. I  will definitely make it again.
