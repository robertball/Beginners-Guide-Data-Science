Very simple fruit salad that's very easy to prepare.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, red grapes instead of green, and mardarin oranges along with the apple and banana.  I toped off the glasses I served the fruit salad in with maraschino cherries.

I used this recipe for my daughter's graduation open house.  I made the salad several hours before serving and it kept well.  We decided it need a little more color so we added maraschino cherries to the mixture.  This added a nice red color and also sweetened the salad a bit.  I liked it either way.

this was so delicious and so very easy!! I had all the ingredients at home already and it makes it easy to use up fruit that may go bad soon. I also added mandarin oranges instead of regular and I also added strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. I didn't add the banana until right before I served it. Excellent way to get your kids to eat a variety of fruit! Thanks!

If you want a fruit salad that tastes purely fresh and fruity, this is a good one.  It's all about fruit, no fillers, no frills, just nice, juicy fruit.

This is a very juicy fruit salad! When I made this a second time, I did not add the banana because it became too mushy as time went on.

I didn't have any grapes and didn't seem to miss them. I cut up 2 small gala apples (skin on)and used a can of mandrian oranges. Chilled overnight for breakfast. The pineapple juice kept the bananas and apples from turning. Very juicy.

This is very good. The bananas soak up the juice nicely. I added strawberries too.

This is gooood! I make it with 3 apples, crushed pineappple (small can), 1 small can frozen OJ, a bit of shredded coconut and I throw in a few cut up maraschino cherries (your young'uns might appreciate a handful of mini-marshmallows, too). I add 1 cup water and let sit in the fridge overnight. Come Christmas morning, it's ready! Never leftovers.

Tasty and pretty!  Took this to a barbeque and it was gone before the meat was ready!  Kids especially liked this. I also added some fresh strawberries since they are so good now.

Very simple to prepare. One of my high school friend's mother used to make this whenever I would come over for dinner. She used a can of mandarin oranges and for a secret ingredient would sprinkle a little instant vanilla pudding on top of it. I went home and told my mother about it and this has become a staple whenever any of us makes a fruit salad.

Would have liked to give this 3-1/2 stars.  It was a good fruit combination, but it was also just a combination of fruit.  Used canned mandarin oranges and whole grapes for ease. Thank you. ***I wanted to edit this review because I made this fruit salad again (so easy!) and ate it over the course of two days.  On the second day (refrigerated for two full days), it was very, very delicious and flavorful!  I think it would make the perfect make-ahead fruit salad and deserves a higher rating than I gave it originally - somewhere around 4 and a half stars.  Thank you.

Sometimes it a real challenge to get my family to eat their "five a day". This recipe helps with that, and its quick and easy for me.To entice the little ones, I sliced up maraschinos in it. Thanks Bobbie.

VERY delicious, perfect balance of different fruit.  Everyone loved it!  I followed the advice of some readers and used a large can of mandarin oranges instead of a whole orange.  I also will use red grapes next time.  Great recipe!

Nice for the summer. I used watermelon in place of grapes and added mandarin oranges. I liked the addition of the apple to make it crunchy.  It's best to use a firm banana for this so it does not get mushy. My family did not care for the canned pineapple so I may try fresh next time.

I thought this was ok but nothing special. It's basically just a bunch of fruit in canned pineapple juice.

We love this recipe!  With three daughters (5, 4, 2), we go through a lot of fruit, and are always looking for new ways to serve it.  This receipe is so simple and versatile...we like to use a large can of mandarin oranges in place of the whole orange, and whatever grapes we happen to have on hand.  We also vary the amount of bananas and apples we use, and usually add home-canned pears and/or peaches.

Someone mentioned this tasted like fruit cocktail.  It kind of does but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing; it's refreshing.  I used a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks and used a clementine orange (2 would have been better) with the little sections cut in half.  I didn't bother to peel a granny smith apple as I think the skin is good & it adds color.  Speaking of color, I think red seedless grapes would be a good substitution and/or addition.  Finally I added a can of drained sliced peaches (that had been in unsweetened pear juice to minimize the added sugar) & cut the slices in half.

This was pretty good, but nothing special. I was unclear about what to do with the orange. Oranges don't give juice unless you squeeze them, and squeezed oranges don't typically go into fruit salads. I just ended up not squeezing the orange and chopping it up for the salad.

Being lazy, I just threw it all in the food processer for a few seconds, making it smaller pieces, but still yummy! My husband ate all the leftovers, so I'll definitely make it again to help him get his fruit content!

An easy pleaser!  We omit the bananas because of preference, but love the rest!  We also tried with a can of mandarin orange segments and it was delicious.

This was the best fruit salad ever. I had 2 work 4th of July and we all brought something. I made this and the guys went crazy over it. I added strawberries for color, but the taste was outstanding! I also threw the apple in food processor so it was slivers. Everyone commented on how much better it was that away. I also made this 12 hrs ahead, and it was not a soggy mess! It was just that much better.

This was okay right away but I thought it was a soggy mess the next day. Most of it went in the trash.  I won't make again. Thanks anyway.

I really liked this salad with its fresh and not overly sweet flavor.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I used red grapes instead of green to add a touch of color.  I, too, was a little confused about the reserved orange juice, so what I did was use two oranges...one for the segments in the salad and one just for the juice.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because by the second day the bananas had started to brown a little and get mushy.  It didn't affect the taste, but if I was making it for guests, I think I would skip the banana.  Either that or serve it immediately rather than letting it marinate over night.

I made several changes based upon what I had in my pantry. I used two cans of Dole's Tropical Fruit Salad (reserving the liquid to prevent the bananas and apple from browning), one granny smith apple, three small bananas, 1/4 c. frozen blueberries (I didn't have grapes), one 15 oz. can of drained mandarin oranges (I didn't have fresh), and one 10 oz. jar of maraschino cherries, drained and rinsed (if you don't rinse the cherries, it will make the syrup a yucky artificial color). I put the reserved liquid from the tropical fruit salad in a glass bowl adding the sliced bananas and diced apples and let them marinate while I assembled the salad. First I drained the tropical fruit in one bowl and put the tropical fruit in another bowl. I cut the bananas and apples and added to the juice I then added the rinsed, halved cherries, frozen blueberries, and drained mandarin oranges to the tropical fruit bowl. Mix together and let the fresh fruit mix rest in the juices for a while then add to the canned fruit mix.  Refrigerated for several hours. So simple and the fresh fruit really makes a difference. Everyone loved it and it keeps well so you can definitely make it a day ahead of your party or dinner which is what I did and will do in the future. Thanks for sharing a versatile recipe.

I used 20 oz canned pineapple, 2 apples, 2-3 oranges, 2 bananas, and strawberries in place of grapes. Refrigerated for a few hours before serving. Huge hit! Everyone went back for seconds.

Very good and refreshing.  I did add an extra orange.  For color, I used red grapes instead plus I like them better than the green ones. Thanks, Bobbie from Susie

I made this for a summer family party and it was a huge hit! I added a jar of maraschino cherries, which gave it a bit more sweetness that everyone seemed to enjoy - so much, that this was the one dish that was empty! It is a very simple recipe, but one you can add to as you wish. Thanks!

It is 'refreshing'  (pardon the pun) to find a recipe suggestion that does not contain added sugar or fat in some form such as pie filling, syrup, cream cheese, sour cream etc. We are fortunate in North America to have access to so many fresh products!  We should enjoy more of them au natural. Marianne

Great recipee! Lots of compliments. We used real orange juice along with the canned pineapple juice(natural fruit juice cans, no added sugar)and added sliced strawberries, sliced pears, and blueberries. Refrigerating the night before was the icing on the cake.

Great healthy salad!  We like it with a breakfast type meal of pancakes or french toast.  I have just used a can of pineapple juice when I don't have canned pineapple.  I also like it with strawberries too.

We love this any time, especially because it can be made with fresh or canned fruit. We do enjoy it especially in the winter when not so much fresh fruit is available. I do not add the banana until ready to serve to keep it from getting mushy! I make it with whatever is on hand!
