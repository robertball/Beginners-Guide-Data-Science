Tasty!! I enjoyed the flavor the cinnamon stick added to the overall dish! I would like a thicker, gravy-like base... this recipe was a little too watery. Next time! =)  I added a LOT of extra carrots and parsnips, which I love! Not something I will make regularly (which isn't saying much since I love trying new recipes too much to have things twice!) but something I could go to if I had beef chunks I want to use up!

My husband requests this all the time now! only changes: didn't have cheesecloth, so I just tossed in a little of each spice. I also added a package of onion soup mix instead of the whole white onions. Wonderful meal that tastes just as good if not better heated the next day!

The only thing I didn't care for about the recipe is that it needed salt badly... I did use lower sodium broth and also lower sodium V8 just because that is what I had bought at the store but it really lacked with no salt. As well, I did add some cornstarch to thicken the broth because it was watery... not gravy-like, like the picture seems to show. So next time, I'll try those two things. The cinnamon/cloves flavor adds something unique... just not the enhancement of salt.

This stew was really good and simple to make. I will make it again.
