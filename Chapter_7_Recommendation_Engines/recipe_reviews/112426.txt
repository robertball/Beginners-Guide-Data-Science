I'm afraid to look at the nutritional information... I think you undo all the benefits of eating parsnips by deep-frying them in oil... Still, these were heavenly!!!

I think that the recipe is a bit high in fat, but then again many recipes are that, and its not the fat that is the worry, its the trans fats! Having said that, you could bake, or griddle fry these instead of deep frying. The value is using an under-appreciated vegetable, that most people turn up their noses at. The nutritional information wasn't that bad for the recipe, and was only 1.5 grams higher in fat than the Moroccan Vegetable Soup( with parsnips) and .6 grams higher in total carbs than the same soup. For me its the carbs that make or brake a recipe, being diabetic.

The flavor is okay, but the texture was awful - just a soggy mess, with a crispy outer layer. On the second batch I tried adding more flour and bread crumbs, but still the same. And that was frying them for 20 minutes or so. Not gonna make these again. :-\

Very tasty. My only wish is that the poster of this recipe would have specified a NON-stick skillet is required in order to flip these patties. I switched skillets half way through and the difference was like night and day. Also, these patties, even when done, are a bit on the soft side when hot and you'll need to be careful when flipping and removing them from the skillet. They do stiffen up as they cool, however.
