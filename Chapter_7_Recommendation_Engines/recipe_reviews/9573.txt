Great for making cut outs!  Very good taste! Do not be afraid of how dough looks after mixing you have to make it into a ball.  I thought that I had done something wrong.

This recipe was super easy and turned out great.  The cookies were very chewy.  I found that putting the dough in to the freezer right before you're going to use it makes it easier to work with.  By far the best sugar cookie recipe i've come across.

I'm hunting for a perfect sugar cookie recipe. This recipe mixes and cuts out with cutters better than I've ever seen. It was a little hard to roll out, but not sticky at all. It tastes delicious with frosting, but is quite bland (like most sugar cookie recipes, unfortunately) alone. I think I will try using orange or lemon juice in place of the vanilla and adding some lemon peel.
Great recipe.

These cookies are fun to make and fun to eat.  My kids love to make them, cut them out, and gobble them down.  They are the best tasting sugar cookies I have ever encountered.  Generally, I do not like sugar cookies, but these are phenommenal. I highly recommend brushing the cookies with the egg white and water mixture that is listed as optional in the recipe.  They come a lovely golden brown.

I am not sure why so many people had trouble with this recipe. I followed it but mixed my shortening, & sugar then put in my eggs, mixed, and then the rest of the ingredients only adding flour a cup at a time. Because some said it was dry I added an extra tbsp of milk and this dough was perfect for a roll out cookie. I only left it in the fridge for 2 hours bec I was short on time. If you were mixing the dough and see it was getting crumbly why would you continue to add flour? I stopped at 3 cups. The taste for a plain sugar cookie is comparable to other recipes. I also used butter flavored crisco. I think you should give this recipe a second chance.

I'm not a very good cook, but this was the easiest cookie recipe I've ever used for sugar cookies.  Normally they fall apart when I try to cut them out.  These worked perfectly and they taste great.  I even added some nutmeg and cinnamon as decoration.  Thanks!!

These were so yummy and chewy! I only had one egg, so I used one egg and 1/4 cup of Egg Beaters egg substitute. They seemed to turn out fine, but they need to be spread apart further than 1/2"- I only put 6 to a cookie sheet. (I rolled mine out to about 1/4" maybe slightly thinner)
I brought them to a dinner for church and everyone complimented them.

I would definitely recommend this recipe. I cut the flour by 1/4 of a cup and added maple flavoring instead of vanilla and the texture is very nice. Rolled out beautifully. I have to admit when I first mixed it I thought it wouldn't work but after patting it into a ball and refrigerating for 2 hours it was very easy to handle.

I followed this recipe perfectly, and it was just crumbs..so what is the point?  After I added some milk and shortening I could get some cookies out of them but they didn't have any taste.  If you insist on making this recipe it might be better to use less flower..2.75 - 3 cups.

I gave this a 3 because I had to tweak it a bit. I highly recommend using Blue bonnet vegetable oil spread instead of shortening. It gives it a great flavor! I also recommend using 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. My cookies were so great! nice and fluffy. I cooked them a bit longer till the edges were golden brown when I made cookie houses.

I did NOT like this recipe.  The dough was very hard to work with, and it was difficult to cut out the cookies.  I don't think the dough was ever moist enough to 'come together'. They tasted ok, but not great.  I will not use this recipe again.

Not sure how 1 cup of egg whites would be optional! I made the recipe without the egg whites and it was impossible to mix together because there was not enough liquid ingredient. So i added half of the egg white that was supposedly optional and it was way to moist. I haven't baked them yet, but this recipe didn't make any sense!

Great sugar cookies possibly the best I've ever had. Instead of putting them in the fridge i put it in the freezer for about a 30 mins. I also creamed the sugar and crisco and gradually added the other ingredients flour last. I also added a couple drops of lemon juice and 2 to 3 tablespoons of orange juice.

Very easy. Kinda plain, would be perfect for frosting later because they aren't too sweet. I rolled these out right after mixing without refrigeration. No problems!

This is my second cookie recipe of the day. This, unfortunately, did not work for my cut outs. They spread and turned to thin pieces of cardboard. Not what I was looking for. I was however, able to make some beautiful drop cookies. I rounded a ball of dough, and flattened it against a plate of colored sugar. Then put on the sheet and baked for 10 mins. The result was a beautifully cracked color coating on top of the cookie.

They don't taste quite as sweet as the sugar cookies I'm used to. But they are simple and that's what I like about them. Be careful not to grease the sheet too much. Keep them thicker for softer cookies, and I only put them in for 7 minutes... 8min.... they get a bit too brown

I loved this recipe. It was super easy dough to work with and tasted and looked great when baked. To those of you who had trouble with the dough, all I can think of is that you either measured wrong or didn't mix the ingredients thoroughly. Shortening first, then sugar, egg, milk and dry ingred. If they baked too puffy, you rolled them out too thick! Put in freezer 30 min. These cookies were fantastic. I can't say enough good things.

i followed the recipe as it is. I made no changes. At first I was freaked out by how grainy it was but I rolled it up into a ball and wrapped it in wax paper. We didn't use it until the following day and we made excellent cookies out of this. This one is a keeper!!! the only thing is I baked my cooking for 6 minutes instead of 8. My oven was preheated therefore the cookies didn't need the entire 8 minutes. I love that my dough didn't stick to my cookie cutters. This a very simple and tasty recipe.   :)

I made these cookies and they were great for cut outs but i didnt think they had much of a taste my kids wont even eat them.  I used self rising flour and cut out the all-purpose, baking powder and salt so do you think that might have ne thing to do with it?

After seeing mentions of this being a bland cookie, I did 1c white sugar and 3/4c brown sugar (instead of the 1 1/2 white sugar). Easy to mix, fantastic to roll out/cut and really delicious! I didn't frost mine (did an egg paint and sparkling sugar before baking) and they weren't bland at all. Sweet and yummy!

9 minutes was the right cooking time, while the dough tastes good raw the cookies puffed up so much we were unable to tell what the original shapes were.  The dough was very sticky-used powdered sugar to roll them out. 1 batch made 32 medium cookies.

Not sure what went wrong, but the shortening taste overpowered the sweetness.  I think 2/3 c is way too much shortening!

I thought this was a very nice dough that resulted in a delicate flavored cookie. I followed other reviewer advice and used 3 cups of flour. Also, I mixed in the order of traditional cookie recipes. I used plain yogurt in place of milk and almond extract in place of vanilla. I also mixed in the zest of one lemon. Thanks for the recipe!

The dough was very easy to work with, especially considering that I rolled it paper thin as I like my sugar cookies crispy, and not soft. Just don't make the same mistake that I did by using a hand mixer (which I ruined) to mix the dough. What was I thinking? I used two teaspoons of vanilla flavoring rather than one, brushed the tops with egg white, and sprinkled colored sugar on them. They were delicious!

Followed exact recipe, but my dough came out quite crumbly even after being in the fridge for 24 hours.  I had to really work with it to get it to stay together for the cut outs.  Good taste though.

Made as indicated except used butter instead of shortening.  Very hard to mix, but easy to roll after refrigeration.  Flavor was good but I only got 5 dozen thin cookies and 8 minutes was way too long.  I ended up at a cook time of 5 minutes and the cookies are still fairly crunchy because I had to make them so thin.  The egg white is a great idea - really made the sprinkles stick.  Will keep looking for a great recipe.

This did not work for my cut outs. I was however, able to make some beautiful drop cookies. I rounded a ball of dough, and flattened it against a plate of colored sugar. Then put on the sheet and baked for 10 mins. The result was a beautifully cracked color coating on top of the cookie.

Wow, these were perfect! I had to use self-rising flour because that's what I had, so they were kind of puffy, but we really liked them. Easy to mix, easy to roll out, easy to cut, easy to bake! My 3-year-old LOVED making and eating them!

For those of you who have a hard time with this recipe and think it's too crumbly and just falls apart, it's not like that at all.   At first I thought I did something wrong but after refridgerating it you have to need it in your hands for a least 5 mins to make it so it doesn't crumble..needs to warm up a bit from the warmth of your hands and it is definetly rollable after that.   Makes great cut out cookies.  My children and I had fun decorating halloween cut-outs with this recipe.

This really is the BEST sugar cookie recipe!!!! I read all the reviews before I tried it and followed everyone's advice to cream the shortening, sugar, eggs and liquid first and then add the dry ingrediants. They turned out excellent!  Soft, sugary... it really is the perfect sugar cookie for cut-outs.  I will never use another recipe again. Oh, and the only thing I did different,besides the mixing order, was use butter-flavored shortening.  Excellent Recipe!!!!!

In my opinion, you have to follow the basic cookie technique with these cookies. Cream shorting and sugar, add eggs, milk then vanilla. Mix in dry ingredients. 
I cut out 1/4 C. of flour as per other reviews and added a little lemon zest. They are perfect to roll out and had a nice flavor! Perfect for decorating!

The dough with a little extra milk added was an easy dough to roll out. My daughter loved it. The taste however was quite bland. I put sprinkles etc on top of them and it helped a little but even smelling the dough the smell was to much like a pastry dough.

I loved this recipe. It was simple and delicious. I reccommend rolling the dough out at least 1/4" thick to make a nice soft cookie that taste store-bought (in this case, a good thing) They were a little bland without any frosting, but are excellent with.

These came out terrific.  We followed the suggestions of less flour and we kept the dough in the freezer between batches.  We iced them with the recipe here for Butter Icing for Cookies which also was great.

Turned out better than I expected. I used butter rather than shortning for a little more flavor + an extra teaspoon of vanilla. All in all this is a simple classic sugar cookie recipe.

Cookies came out great! I would modify the directions to be more specific in how you mix the ingredients: shortening,sugar, egg, vanilla, milk, then the dry products. i also used 3 cups instead of 3 and 1/4. but overall they came out great!

just made these for memorial day.  had to add a tad more liquid but they turned out great, easy to roll and cut.  they're a bit bland, but icing makes up for it.  i love that its chewy, not too crunchy.
UPDATE:  cookies were gone very quickly, everyone loved them!  i think they're better the next day if you like a softer, chewier cookie.

Followed recipe exactly and the "dough" was very crumbly. I couldn't even form a ball, it wouldn't stay together. There didn't seem to be enough wet ingredients. I wasn't feeling brave enough to start improvising with more milk, etc. so I just trashed it. definitely won't be trying again.

After I made these cookies, frosted them with DeDe's Almond Butter Icing, and helped my kids sprinkle decorations on top, I called everyone and bragged that I had just made THE BEST CHRISTMAS COOKIES EVER!  We gave them out with presents, and I have just copied this recipe for the 7th time!  Definitely the best cookies ever for rolling and decorating!  Absolute 5 star!!!!!

I made these NEVER making a cookie dough for my husband’s military function, last minute of course. I left them in the fridge for 2 hours and then set to rolling out the dough. Since I had no guidelines to tell me how thick my dough was I did 2 cutouts. The flower one burned because of how thin I rolled and cut. I baked those for 12 minutes. They were rock hard even after putting simple syrup on them.

I was freaking out after mixing because it was really crumbly but i added some milk and vanilla and it rolled into a ball just fine. If i ever made it again i would adjust the amount of flour and add extra milk. I would probably try this recipe again but with the adjustments listed above

Sorry, this did not work out well for me.  I put the dough in the refrigerator overnight, it was still too dry inside to roll out.  As suggested by another reviewer I made them into a ball and flattened with a glass.  The end result was an ok cookie but was not sweet enough for me, even with colored sugar on top.  I will continue on my quest for the perfect cut out cookie.

I always have a problem with sugar cookies: When I cut them and place them in the oven: They spread!!! It seems like if they're melting and loose the form! 
 What am I doing wrong?
 I love them, love their taste and love to make them. But I dont know why do they spread like that. 
 Please Help Me!!!!

Maybe I'm overestimating sugar cookies, but I found these to be strangely tasteless, even after using butter flavored Crisco, replacing milk with orange juice and adding almond and vanilla extract and nutmeg. However, they did roll out well and my 3 year old enjoyed decorating them. He thinks they're great, me, not so much. Frosting seems necessary.

This is a great rolled cookie-dough recipe. Very simple for the kids to be able to help with. Of course the cookie is a little bland - but the idea is usually to decorate them. The first step of the directions should be worded a little different for people who are new(er) at baking. You WILL end up with crumbs if you dump it all in and then mix it. You need to start with the shortening & sugar. Add everything else except the flour & mix, and then SLOWLY add the flour in while mixing. I thought the first step was a little weird and ended up with crumbs. I just added a little more milk and put it in the fridge for2 hours. It was a little sticky (but, only because I added extra milk) just pulling flour down, on the rolling pin, and sprinkle on the top until it was not sticky anymore. Overall, they were great cookies that we enjoyed decorating for Halloween with the kids!

Very nice basic sugar cookie recipe.  Perfect for decorating or kneading in some spices for flavor- I used cumin on some and cinnamon on the others.  I had to make some changes based on lack of ingredients- for about half the flour, I substituted bread flour and I used butter instead of shortening.

I'm pretty sure that the people who gave this recipe one star were at high altitudes.  I definitely did not have a problem with the recipe being too dry, even after the top of the dough got dried out from me forgetting to cover the dough in the fridge.

This one takes a long time to come together in higher elevations. At first I thought I had done something really wrong but it finally became a dough. It's a bit stiff to work with. I did add almond flavor as it is a big bland without some kind of flavor. I think orange would be yummy too.

I made this recipe and it worked well.  It was crumbly, but once rolled and cut out it the cookies kept their shape and looked great! Thanks for the recipe!

These are the BEST sugar cookies! They are easy to roll out and cut, they are soft on the inside and crunchy around the edges.  THE BEST!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

this is the best for frosting cookies.  I made them for a wrestling tournament and I ended up making two more batches since everyone ate them.  I was even asked for the recipe.
