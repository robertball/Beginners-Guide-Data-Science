Excellent recipe...the first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly.  Very good but the actual muffin was a little bland.  The second time, I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and then added the cinnamon mixture into the batter instead of on top.  Much more flavorful and the kids loved them!  Is now a staple in my recipe collection!

I made this recipe over the 4th for brunch and my family loved it. Since I didn't have muffin papers, I made it in a 12x7 baking dish as a coffee cake and I used canned peaches, came out great.....will make again

This was a pretty good recipe.  I used a generous 2 cups of peaches only (no blueberries) and added 2t or so of cinnamon to the recipe before baking. The batch made 20 muffins and they were wonderful warm out of the oven with a little bit of butter. It was almost like southern peach cobbler, but remember I used 2 heaping cups of peaches.  It really isn't too sweet, so keeping that in mind, you might consider adjusting the sugar a little if you like a sweet muffin, but I liked the sweet bites each time I found a peach bit, so it didn't bother me.  It is not your standard fluffy muffin recipe and it seems to be on the heavier side.  But I found it refreshingly different, which is why I came to the site. I think I am going to try it again in a couple of months with APPLES!  This is a great comfort food recipe and my roommate ate 4 in a row right out of the oven and raved about them.

Fabulous!! Light & fluffy too!
I did mix it together a little differently & used buttermilk instead, as well as added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar...this is what I did:
Beat together the eggs, sugars & buttermilk. Added the melted butter. Beat again. Added dry ingredients & beat well. 
Stirred in 1 & 1/2 cup blueberries & 1 1/2 cups fresh diced peaches.
Baked at 375 for 25 mins. They turned out perfect!

I used 2 overripe peaches, frozen blueberries, added 1 tsp cinnamin, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also made sure to cream up the butter and eggs with an electric mixer to make sure the mixture was fluffy.  YUMMY!

This is the best muffin recipe I have made.  So far I have made muffins with blueberry and peach, just blueberries, raspberry and nuts, and chocolate chips.  It makes 16 good size muffins or 8 by cutting the recipe in half.

My family thinks they are wonderful.  I used white georgia peaches that were perfectly ripe. I think next time I might try nectarines with blueberries.  Also I would probably add a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter to give it a little more taste and really bring out the taste of the fruit.

LOVE blueberries and peaches! These were really good muffins! I used good, tree-ripe Louisiana peaches and blueberries we picked ourselves. My only change was that I didn't use the topping, but mixed the spices in with the dry ingredients and omitted the extra sugar. I also made one batch in regular-size muffin pans and a batch of minis - made 24 minis. Just right for those folks who protest the goodies but eat them anyway. ;-)

These really are delicious!  They are a denser muffin than most and are also not incredibly sweet (which I think is a good thing).  I always substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour and they come out amazing! I have made them about 5 times for different get togethers and there are never any left.

I made these with fresh raspberries instead of blueberries and they were wonderful.  I either added too much fruit or something else because I had 24 muffins!  I wasn't as crazy about the topping (too cinnamony) and will use just plain sugar next time.

I used unsalted butter, 1 tsp salt, frozen blueberries, and two peaches; also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 c ground flaxseeds, and 2 tsp cinnamon to the batter, and omitted the topping. They ended up baking for 30 minutes - still batter-y at 20, and at 25. Tasty tasty though, and kid-approved! Next time I'll use a cup of whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose.

I doubled this recipe and used blackberries instead of blueberries. I added vanilla and a touch of almond extract, as well as substituted some plain yogurt for some of the milk called for in the recipe.  These were good, not great, but the family did like them.

Thought these were wonderful, although I did make a few changes for better nutrition.  Used 2 cups whole wheat flour + 1 cup white flour instead of all white; put a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter; used 1/4 cup plain yogurt + 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of 1/2 vegetable oil; and my 1 cup of peaches were overripe, cut small, and crammed into 1 cup.  Definitely a keeper!

Love these.  I think it's important to add a full tsp of salt instead of just a pinch.  I followed other reviews and added the cinnamon and nutmeg plus 1 tsp vanilla to the batter, and omitted the topping.  I also used half-whole wheat flour.  The result was perfect - not to sweet.  The nutmeg and vanilla really bring out the fruit.  Next time I'll add even more peaches.

These were delicious even without the cinnamon topping.  Just a good basic muffin recipe - I made some with the cinnamon on top, some without anything and some with the cinnamon mixed in and they're good all of those ways.  Thanks!

I added more sugar and used nectarines instead of peaches and I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  And I put it into a 13x9 pan instead of muffin tins.  It turned out great! Very healthy and delicious.  I did add the topping, which I think was very necessary.

I made this in an 11x7 pan as another reviewer did.  It came out kind of pasty like I didn't cook it long enough.  Next time I think I'll use 2 loaf pans, lower the heat and cook it 30 minutes.  Also, I used 2 cups peaches and no blueberries and the flavor was fine.

Excellent!  I made these many times during Aug and Sept.  Now I use the peaches and blueberries that I froze.  Fresh peaches are definitely better.  These muffins have been a huge hit with everybody that I have served them to!

These muffins were excellent! I did, however, make some adjustments that led to my 5-Star rating. I took the advice of other reviewers and added the cinnamon and nutmeg in with the other dry ingredients (omitting the extra sugar and butter altogether). I also added in 1 tsp. of vanilla. Some reviews mentioned that the muffins came out too heavy, so I also added in a couple dollops of sour cream. The result was a moist muffin, substantial but not too dry or dense.

These were awesome!  Used buttermilk, and increased the amount b/c the dough seemed a little dry and we live at altitude.  Just put blobs of the buttery/sugar mixture on top of the muffins before they baked, and they were so, so good.  Will absolutely make again.

I loved this recipe. It is so funny because I actually HATE peach cobbler, but when I made these they tasted just like peach cobbler and I loved them! I did leave the blueberries out and added some cinnamon & nutmeg (which are my staples). 

I wish I could say they froze well, but I didn't have any left to freeze! I hope to make them again next summer when peaches bloom again here in GA.

These muffins taste okay, but they are not at all what I like my muffins to be like.  I prefer a lighter muffin.  These are too heavy and cakey for my tastes.

Very moist, however I agree needs a bit more sugar and spice.

So I just made these, and they are awesome! Make sure you mix the liquids separately and well, and they will not be heavy. Not a real sweet muffin, which is nice; it brings out the flavor of the fruits. Will be making again soon! Oh, I added the vanilla like other reviews suggested, and an 1/8 of C more sugar.

This morning this muffin made headlines in the family. Sarah can actually bake without causing a toad to grow another head, I say that's a little harsh but you'll never catch admitting this to anyone true (my famous in a bad way rice flour muffins). But this muffin I chose as my first real muffin and it turned out wonderful and crisp on the edges kind of like an English muffin texture, just ask my dad how good they've turned out (he's eaten 3 already this morning). I've added walnuts and I baked them for 25 minutes instead of 20 and I feel like a proud mother right now. Can't wait to try the next adventure but first me and my parents (especially my dad) all have to go hiking to burn off some calories, looks like this has been a big hit!

Not sweet enough for me, I even added a strudel topping to try to make them a bit sweeter but in the end they were pretty bland.  The texture of the muffins were good, and I liked the combination of fruits.  I will use a different recipe next time.

These were pretty good; a basic recipe that could be made better with tweaking. I used fresh blueberries and some very ripe apricots which added to the texture. I took the advice of some other reviewers adding less sugar and putting the cinnamon mixture in the dough. Next time, I will add more sugar and probably use one less egg as I felt these were WAY too dense and not sweet enough. I would also reduce the oven temp and/or the cook time. Any suggestions as to what could make these fluffier?

Good, although a little heavier than how I like my muffins.  I really like the combination of peach and blueberries, especially since they're in season together her.

These were okay. I agree with other posts that say they have little flavor. Maybe the salt needs to be increased or add some cinnamon to the batter. I won't make this particular recipe again, but I do like the combination of peaches and blueberries.

These are very tasty.  I used all peaches, no blueberries.  My first batch I used all soy milk instead of regular milk and 2 cups of fresh peaches.  They were good.  The second batch I used half soy milk, half regular and double the peaches.  Much better with more peaches!   Highly recommend!

These muffins are absolutely delicious...I diced up one firm peach and two that were getting pretty soft (almost too soft to eat) and the mixture of firm and smooshy peaches was perfect! What a great combination of flavors...I'll definitely make these again.

Very Yummy! I had both peaches and fresh-picked blueberries on hand - what a great combination! The recipe made a full dozen and a half good sized muffins. Next time I'll try adding some vanilla. Quite delectable!

I had to con vert these to gluten free (I used gf flour) and dairy free...so I added 1 and 1/2 cups of applesauce for the milk and oil!  They worked ok.  I had added cinnamon, wish I had added the vanilla, but I rated this good as it stood up to the changes, they taste a little "healthy" the way I made them!

7.31.16  I thought these muffins were a little weak on flavor, considering the great combination of peaches and blueberries.  If I were to make again, I'd add  a little more sugar (and that's an odd thing for me to say because typically I'm heading in the other direction with sugar) as well as either almond or vanilla extract.  They'll be eaten, but I wouldn't say these are a favorite muffin.

Wow this recipe is great!  I forewent the last "topping" step and put a half teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg into the batter.  They baked up very well and smelled divine.  Definitely making these again.

I made these muffins, but substituted the flour with 1 cup whole wheat and the other 1 1/4 cup was white flour.  I added a tsp. of vanilla to the wet mixure and they are delicious! I adjusted the recipe to make 12 muffins and used 2 large eggs instead of 2 1/4 eggs.

SOOO Delicious! I halved the recipe and it made 10 muffins. I used 2 peaches and no blueberries. Before I put the nutmeg/cinnamon topping, I tried one and it was so yummy, but nothing compared to how delicious the finished product is!

These were great.  I used 1 1/2 cups white flour, 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup wheat bran, also used heaping cups of fruit, and used 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp vanila.  Nice and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness!

I was really looking forward to these but they were a disappointment.  I bake a lot of muffins but this recipe just confused me and only turned out okay.  I changed the number of servings to 25 so it called for 3/4 and 1 T of melted butter. But here's where it got tricky..... the actual recipe directions only have me mix in 1/2 cup!  What am I supposed to do with the rest of the butter??  At the bottom of the recipe it gives the ingreds for the topping but it is still not clear about what to do with the rest of all that butter?  So, I tried several different versions of the topping -- some using minimal butter and some using a lot of butter (muffins swam in butter).  There are better recipes out there.

Made these today and they are great. I did a couple things differently: I had only frozen fruit so I brought them to room temp w/ 1 TB brown sugar. While that was doing its thing I whipped up the egg whites till very foamy and then added the yolks one at a time (had XL eggs only as well so this was very voluminous), then I added 1 tsp vanilla and proceeded w/ the rest.   In the flour mixture I substituted 1/2 cup of AP flour with wheat germ and added in 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I didn't use a sprinkle topping because I used the extra sugar on the fruit.   They turned out slightly sweet and the nutty flavor of the wheat germ is present. The batch made 24 mini muffins and a half of a loaf pan.

Good fruit combination, fresh fruit is a must. I also added a streusel topping which made it just that much better.

These were great! I didn't make the topping.  Although I'm sure it's good, I didn't feel they needed it.

These were great.  They're a hearty muffin so next time I won't use the same topping.  The whole family ate them and ate them fast!

Delicious!! I used nectarines and strawberries and left out the salt (as I always do). Also I didn't use the topping (I've had too much cinnamon lately). Yum, yum!

This is a very nice muffin.  I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the mix.  Also I only used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg in the topping.  I used 2 cups of peaches and even so, they were hard to taste.  But we still enjoyed them.  They are not overly sweet and are a great breakfast muffin!

Pretty good but not fantastic.  I was looking for a recipe that combined the 2 fruits since they are in season together.  It is not a very sweet muffin and I really couldn't taste the peach, but my family still liked them and ate them up.

These were good. Not sweet enough for my taste, but a great breakfast muffin. I LOVE blueberry peach combination :)

Not that crazy about this recipe....too bland for my tastes.  Maybe needs more salt, or more spices. Putting blueberries and peaches together was a good idea, but I think it needs more of the fruit, too.

Sorry ~ my family just didn't think these were something worth repeating.  Not very sweet, too much nutmeg in the topping and drab in flavor.  Adjustments could be made, but I'll search for another recipe first!

Excellent less sweet muffin.  Great with cream cheese spread.  Makes 6+ giant Wilton pan muffins.  Also used bundt pan and small angel cake pan and both baked perfectly.  Need to adjust bake times to pan size.  Used tried and true toothpick test to determine when done.

Great recipe, we had lots of fresh peaches and was thrilled to find a good muffin recipe to use some of our peaches and fresh blueberries. Will make again.

YUMMIE! These were so good, my husband took some to work and people wanted to place orders! :)  The batter itself is so good, you can try any fruit combination you like.  Will definitely make again.
