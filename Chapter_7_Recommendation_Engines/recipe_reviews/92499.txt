An excellent bran muffin recipe! This recipe goes together fast, and calls for ingredients I always have on hand. My husband gobbled these up!  Be sure to include the raisins. Muffins took exactly 18 minutes in my oven. I sprayed muffin tins with PAM - instead of using liners. *Updated to add: this easy one-bowl recipe has become our standard bran muffin - I make these every week!!

Perfect as it is, really tasty

If youre on a health kick, a little less molasses could be used, and a little more bran if you need it.

But dead tasty as its described :)

I used oat bran instead of wheat and doubled the raisins. Moist and delicious. My 3 year old loved them!

Lately I have become quite addicted to the bran muffins my local bakery makes, and when I asked the owner about her recipe, she said it was nothing special, just a recipe from home. So, I've tried a few and this one seems closest to what I was looking for. The molasses taste is just a bit too strong for me, so I cut it back a bit. They raise up nicely, but aren't huge.

Great recipe.  Easy and exact.  Muffins are moist and the molasses is perfect.

A great basic bran muffin recipe.  The molasses makes them dark, just like the ones you buy at your favorite bakery or coffee shop.  I'm generous with the raisins because I like them.  Be careful not to overcook - nothing worse than a dry bran muffin!

Delicious! I love the dense, healthy bran taste of these. I used golden raisins (mmm! tastes like candy!)and can't stop eating these muffins. I didn't think the molasses was too strong at all. Great recipe.
