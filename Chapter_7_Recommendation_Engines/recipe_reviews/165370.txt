This recipe is devine!  I substituted mangos for the nectarines, due to the lack of flavor in the nectarines that I bought.  My husband and I both loved the result and thought it was beyond restaurant quality.  I would highly recommend!

Yummy!!! What a great summer fish recipe. I used cod; for the salsa, I left out the mint and jalapeno (I had neither, plus I didn't think I would miss the mint) and it was still super tasty. So glad I tried this recipe; I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was great!  Easy to do, and looks and tastes gourmet!  I used mangos instead of nectarines because I prefer their texture.  It was delicious!

The nectarines HAVE to be ripe & in season, otherwise the whole thing is unspectacular.  I've made this with salmon, halibut, tilapia, & cod. All very yummy.

The salsa is so good, it could be eaten on lettuce as a salad.
