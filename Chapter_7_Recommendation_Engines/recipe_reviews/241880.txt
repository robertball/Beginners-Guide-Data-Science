This is a quick and very flavorful flatbread.  This bread is crisp on the edges and moist inside.  I used it as a base for avocado salad and pizzas.  The topping for flatbread are endless.  If you are looking for a flatbread recipe, this one's a keeper.

Was good I had cooked up sausage, tomatoes and some red pepper and spread it over finished bread still in skillet.  Beat some eggs poured it over and through it back in oven.  Topped with some spinach and goats cheese when eggs almost done.  Great breakfast pizza as flat bread stayed crisp.

Decided to try this recipe since my boyfriend can't digest regular white flour very easily, but no problems with light spelt flour.  This was tasty (but greasy) flatbread.  The cooking time seems to be good, except it seemed a little doughy on the inside, so I took it out of the pan and put it directly on the rack in the oven for about 10 minutes longer with the oven turned off. Only minor changes I made was to use a bit of maple syrup instead of the refined sugar.  Next time, I will use less oil, maybe 1/8c or even less.  Reminded me of the batter on the deep-fried chicken balls in Chinese restaurants.  I will try this again, maybe as a pizza by adding the sauce & toppings after flipping it.  Thanks Carol!
