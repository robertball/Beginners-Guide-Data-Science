i was kind of confused when i finished this recipe. i was expecting a different flavour, but when it turned out to be a pork cutlet i was a tad disappointed. Don't get me wrong. These are delicious! I think i over-thought it a bit and was expecting something different. I re-read the title and it was an ah-ha moment, because it is just what it says it  is.  a crispy fried pork cutlet. The addition of soy sauce to the egg mixture is was also a little confusing to me, in that it didn't really impart any flavour, even though i double the soy sauce. All in all, this is a very tasty dish.
