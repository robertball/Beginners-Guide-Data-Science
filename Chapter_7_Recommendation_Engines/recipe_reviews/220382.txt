Loved it. It's not too high brow but its easy, inexpensive and delicious. The recipe was pretty much perfect, but I did have to add some more milk because it was too thick to spread. (Hence the four stars instead of five). Next time I think I'll play around a bit and replace the orange juice with cranberry and the orange jello with raspberry, then use white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.

This is absolutely wonderful. Its almost like eating a creamsicle without the brain freeze. I gave it only a 4 star rating because it was so messy getting out of the pan. That could be maker's error but it won't stop me from making it again. My husband and my In- Laws loved it!

This is so simple and so delicious. It's cheap too. I made this for a recent BBQ and everyone wanted my recipe. Next time I will have to make more than one, because I only got one tiny slice, and I swear I could eat the whole thing. Yummy!

I originally found this recipe on Kraft foods website. I cook for a youth camp. I make this during the summer a lot. I put them in the freezer and pull them out 10 mins before serving time. It's like eating an orange creamsicle. It's so refreshing.

I did not care for this recipe. Too dense, unappealing texture, not light and fluffy like the picture. Orange is over the top.
