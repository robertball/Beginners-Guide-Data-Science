Made as written and this turned out pretty good. It was super simple and I had fun making it. After you let it cool a bit it does have a bread like consistency. A dense wet bread but still bread. I will definitely make this again and even experiment with different cheese combinations. Thanks for sharing!

This is the first recipe I made in my new air fryer.  Awesome: easy and delicious!   I followed the recipe exactly as written. Fits beautifully with Keto and it is very bread like.  As suggested by another reviewer, I will experiment with other shredded cheeses.  Thank you very much for sharing.

Well, my parchment paper caught on fire so I'm not sure that was the greatest idea! I ended up cooking it without afterwards, had to bump it up to 15 minutes. Flavor was pretty good, but my rating was due to the danger of it.

I added italian seasoning and used garlic salt instead of powder. Only because we are keto and need our salt!!

Turned out great. Too much garlic for me so I'll use less next time. Other than that it was great.

Itâ€™s great and easy but really all you need is a pinch of garlic powder because that teaspoon was too much...a little to salty... next time will be perfect.

I wanted bread, but made this instead. Really good, filling too.  Had to cook longer and did flip it to get the bottom cooked.
