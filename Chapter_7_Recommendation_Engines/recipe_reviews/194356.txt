This pie is so easy to make yet so good! I make this quite often during the summer, I didn't even know the recipe was on here until today. If you love cool lemon desserts like me,  then try this. It's very refreshing and light. You could also use a store-bought pie crust, also. Just fill after the crust is baked and cooled. :)

This pie is okay.  I used sugar-free fat-free pudding, so I don't think mine set as well as it should have.  The top layer tasted great when first made, but not as great once it set.

This one is a inner. So easy. So good.

My wife is diabetic, so I used sugar-free pudding and lite Cool Whip. It did fine.

The kids made this pie(with a little help)and it's so easy to make. I don't think you could screw it up. Everyone loved it.

This is a nice and light lemon dessert! Great for taste with just a few ingrediants and no bake is perfect!  You can also make this a Chocolate Triple Layer Pie too by getting 2 packages of JELLO Chocolate Instant pudding and a OREO chocolate ready made crust instead. Following directions the exact same but with the chocolate pudding instead of the lemon with the chocolate pie crust! YUM either way 5 stars!

My husband loves this recipe!  I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, but I cut back on the milk by  2 tablespoon.

I made this for an office party. What a success!  My co-workers said they liked it because it’s light, airy, and not too tart. It’s really perfect for summer.

This was delicious and amazing.  It was so lite and refreshing after a heavy meal.  Can't wait to make this again this summer.

Fast & easy to prepare. Just the flavor I needed on a rainy Oregon spring day.
