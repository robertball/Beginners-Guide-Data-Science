This turned out great!!  It is time consuming to prepare, but is well worth it.  I would recommend cutting the baklava before baking it.  That way when pouring the syrup, it coats every piece.  Also, to save some time, once the baklava is baking make the syrup.

More like the ones I had in the Greek coffee house when I went downstairs to get my Dad's Greek  morning paper  in Greektown, Chicago Ill.  The orange juice gives it a more authentic taste and it was always made with walnuts I  prefer no nutmeg and more cinnamon

Awesome! Never made Baklava before but this was perfect! Made it for a church dinner (substituted 1/2 the walnuts for pistachios) and it was a hit!

Rave reviews every time! Another tip: line the pan with parchment paper so that it hangs out over the edges. When the baklava is cool, you can pick it up with the paper and transfer it right out of the pan to a cutting board. I used 1/2 Cup water and 1/2 orange juice for extra orange flavor.

Delicious recipe. I, too, used a mixture of Walnuts & Pistachios. Keeps well. Thank you for sharing. Used #4 Phyllo - Suggested by the local Greek market.

I have made this recipe several times now and it has always turned out very good. Rave reviews from all our friends and family. Would continue to make this one as the people we know from Europe sure devoured it! Thank you.

I made it as the recipes tells which is the best and closest when I was a kid but they used rose water and honey drizzled over the top. I also made it following these instructions but after the first 6 sheets I spread Nutella then 2 sheets then a thick layer of nuts then 2 sheets another thinner layer of nuts and so forth. Wow! I tried to hide it and they still found and devoured it.

Tip: Get a 12 oz bottle of "I can't believe it's not butter". Pour out the product to use on your toast, and fill the spray bottle with melted butter. Spread newspaper around the baking pan to catch overspray. Keep the spray bottle in hot water between uses. The result is that you will use less butter [you won't miss it!] and the butter will be more evenly distributed than using a brush.

Omg!! I was skeptical at first because it seems tedious. But  it turned out great! I had to use pecans though cause I didn't have walnuts. (I thought I had) but still it was delish!! Even my son who doesn't like sweets loved it.
