Made this for Recipe Group...We loved it! I did boil the potatoes whole before peeling/cubing b/c I don't like how they get when I do it the other way. I wasn't sure what to saute the onions and celery in, so I used some of the bacon grease and that added great flavor. I also reduced the salt a bit, but that was a personal preference. This came together very easily, and, in fact, I made it earlier in the day and just refrigerated it until I was ready to bake it. This was a nice twist on the usual German potato salad, and one that I will be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group Selection:  13, October 2012 ~ This is a different type of German Potato Salad than what I grew up on.  That being said, different is good.  I think I would have preferred to boil the potatoes first, and then cube them.  They got a little mushy by cubing then boiling. The sauce mixture was a nice amount for 4 cups of potatoes.  I used white cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I think this will be a recipe that the leftovers will be even better than the first time around.  My DH wishes I would have  saut√©ed the celery and onions a little longer as he didn't appreciate the crunch in the dish.  We both liked this dish and I would make it again.  Thanks LizgraEva for sharing your version of Hot German Potato Salad.

Made for Recipe Group 10/13/12. I would suggest cooking the celery mixture a little longer on low. I did not like the little crunch while eating the finished product. It made for a lot of dirty dishes. This did have alot of flavor because of the sauce.

Recipe Group selection of 10/14/12.  I used red potatoes, which I boiled and cubed with the skin on.  I sauteed my onion and celery in the bacon drippings for added flavor and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I am unsure what the problem is because I like German Potato Salad and I like all the ingredients, but it just didn't work for us.  I think we would have liked it better without the mayo, hot or without the cheese, cold.  It was interesting to try though, thanks Lizgra!

I halved the recipe but ended up using the full amt of the mayo mixture & mine was still on the dry side, not sure why. I did leave out the celery-not a fan. That being said, it was pretty good. I doubt I'll make it again but it was great to try once!

Made this for Recipe Group and followed directions exactly as written.  We all ate a small portion of this, no one wanted seconds.  The leftovers also did not re heat well the next day.  Thanks for posting something new for us to try; but don't think we will be making again.

I loved this recipe, it will become one of our new household favorites. I just wish it was a little less greasy.

Recipe Group. I scaled back to 1/2 recipe and made this for my lunch. I sauteed the onions & celery in some of the bacon grease as suggested by Christina, and I use Miracle Whip instead of mayo (less calories & fat), and only 1/4t salt. This was very easy to put together, and store in the fridge until I was ready to cook. This was a delicious change of pace from the usual sandwiches. Thanks!

I traded the bacon for German Bratwurst. It was great!, the flavors melded together very well.

Awesome fun! Family loved it. Will definitely make this again. Maybe I will try red potatoes! Hmmm,.....
