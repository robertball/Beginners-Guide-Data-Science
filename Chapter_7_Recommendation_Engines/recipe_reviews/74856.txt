made this 4 times with adjustments each time & finally this rocks!  guests loved it each time but now i finally got good ratios as original recipe is too dry. here is my way that everybody asks for...increase sour cream to 2 c., 2 cans of diced grn chilies, 1 large can of corn & 2 cans of drained/rinsed black beans. also needed a few good dashes of emeril's seasoning to bring it from bland to WOW! awesome potluck or group dish!

Quite a few reviewers made some comments about it was a little bland, so I spiced it up a bit.

I used my own chicken stock when I cooked the rice, as canned chicken broth can be a bit salty. I used a can of Mexi-Corn, a small can of petite diced tomatoes and I used a batch of the Taco Seasoning 1 from this site. (I cut back on the salt and chili powder to protect little mouths.) I whipped the taco seasoning in with the sour cream and a little worchestershire sauce, then added it in with the other ingredients.

This turned out really well. I'd make this again.

I was looking for a new side to tacos, and this was wonderful.  My kids took one bite and said it tasted like chicken enchiladas... So now we make it as a main dish, only I stir in chopped cooked chicken, some cumin and a can of black beans.  We LOVE it!  Thanks for a great recipe that is truly different.

Never made before, and it was fabulous!!There were not any left overs.  As recommended by another reviewer, I added 1 can of drained black beans, used 2 cups of sour cream, and 2 cans of the chiles.  I also added a dash of cumin, corriander, and crushed red peper. I will definitely make this again.

This turned out ok.  It had an interesting flavor, but my husband and I had hoped it would be creamier.  Next time I may add more sour cream or some salsa to it as well.

I served this with foil-pack taco chicken dinner, on the site too- see my comments.  I read all of the users comments and I ran from there. 

I use fideo (instead of rice), garlic chicken broth, rotel, green chiles, nacho cheese soup, sour cream,
and Mexican cheese blend.

Really creamy and makes you nose run!

Lord help me, this rice is to die for!!! I changed the recipe a bit to fit my taste, however: 

I cut back on the cheese; I didn't have any cilantro, so I omitted it. I just cooked the rice as stated in chicken stock, then added in some frozen corn kernels that I thawed out, dumped in 2 tablespoons of low fat sour cream, 1 tablespoon of lime juice, a little salt, a little pepper, and Â¼ cup shredded cheddar cheese. Delicious, seriously my most favorite rice.

This is so very yummy.  It's the only rice that my rice-hater likes, he actually got excited about it.  I add some garlic powder when I'm adding the salt and pepper, and I only have 7oz cans of green chiles.  Thanks for the yummy recipe, I made it twice last week.

i feel foolish for making this recipe.  at first look, i knew it needed more spice, so i added cumin, garlic, salt, one chopped green onion, and a little cayenne.  i also subbed black beans for the corn (personal preferance--don't care for canned corn too much), homemade tomatillo sauce for the green chile peppers, and subbed queso fresco for the jack cheese for a more authentic flavor.  i added two cups of sour cream and abt. a Tbs. of milk to thin the sauce.  i thought this recipe had good 'bones' and with my changes, it would be a sure-fire hit.  this belongs on the taco bell menu.  i'm hoping to pass this off to my family in tortillas with salsa and avacado slices...but i'm not makin' any bets either.  i know i can't handle another bite, no matter the presentation.

I just made/served this for the first time. It is a Winner. I followed the recipe as it was written and I would not change a thing. I served it with a Cuban Pork roast and fresh green beans from my garden. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was delicious!  I made quite a few changes based on what I had on hand and also based on many of the other reviews.  I used frozen corn instead of canned and also added a can of black beans, rinsed and drained, a can of petite diced tomatoes, drained, a can of nacho soup, diced scallions and 2 T chili powder, 1 T ground cumin, 1 t ground coriander and a dash of cayenne pepper and a Mexican blend cheese.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Yes please! Easy to assemble. Never any leftovers. 5 stars! Make sure you don't skimp on the sour cream though, as it can dry out a bit as others mentioned. Thinking about adding some jalapeÃ±os next time to spice it up, but it's great without too!

Everyone loved this dish, served it with grilled chicken that had been bathing in a fajita marinade and a salad.  Used full fat sour cream and next time will add more cheese to the rice mixture.  Great recipe.

Great rice dish! My daughter's favorite!! She's at that age where I can do nothing right anyway but this rice makes me a heroine. I might throw in some other ingredients from time to time if I don't have everything. I've used cheddar and gouda and pepper jack, too. I swear to god, I could lace this with strychnine and it would still be the favorite at every meal!!

I made this as a side dish last night to go with "tasty lentil tacos" from this site. I followed the recipe as written with 2 minor changes. Instead of the corn..I am allergic..I added some peas and carrots. And instead of the monterey jack cheese, I used pepper jack..because that's what I had at home. I liked the flavor but my husband thought that the sour cream kinda took over. I will probably make this again with just about a half cup of sour cream..or maybe even plain yogurt. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this as a side dish for taco night and it was very good. I used brown rice because thats all we eat. I was concerned about it being dry because of other reviews but, I just put 3/4 cup cheese in it and only 1/4 cup on top and it was fine. I also didn't cook the rice all of the way since it would cook more in the oven and there was still a little broth in the pan that I mixed in with everything so it was not dry at all.  Good flavor ~ will make again. The only reason it's not getting a 5 is that it seems a little something is missing...can't put my finger on it. Eating leftovers for breakfast now:-)

I was actually about submit a recipe like this before I saw this one. Very similar to my aunts. She uses 2 bags of Success Rice... can't go wrong with that! Instead of sour cream, she used mexican cream. Similar but mexican cream is the best! Instead of the can of green chiles, my aunt uses chile poblano. She grills it, peels it and slices it very thin and long. She sautees with butter the sliced chile poblano, chopped onion and garlic. Instead of Monterrey Jack Cheese, she uses Queso Oaxaca which is mexican cheese... it's string-like. Awesome for quesadillas. She doesn't use cilantro but I'm sure that will make it taste even better! And instead of seasoning it with salt or anything else, she only uses Knorr Suiza. This is the real deal! Extremely Mexican! ;)

a nice side, but lacks oomph.  based on the reviews i read, i doubled the sour cream and the chilies, and added salt and pepper, and they had a nice creamy consistency but still need more flavor.  may try this again, but add tomato sauce and/or fresh garlic.

Easy weeknight dish to accompany tacos or other Mexican foods. This was a little bland so I added some taco seasoning before putting it in the casserole dish, glad I did.

Add a little bit more flavor and this dish is perfect. I added 1 Tbsp of taco seasoning and used HOT diced green chilies. Also I heard that cilantro gets bitter when chopped so I tore the leaves. Time consuming but I think it makes a difference. Excellent side dish or main dish if you add chopped chicken!

I loved, loved, loved this rice! I subbed a can of black beans for the corn, we don't like corn with rice. The flavor was wonderful , cilantro is a must. It was a little dry,not cheesy saucy .....but we still devoured it!

Custom version - rice, sour cream, mexi-blend fine shredded cheese (or regular cheddar), sliced jalapenos (from jar) + juice.   Make some rice ( a few cups will do).  Blend in small amount of jalapeno juice + sour cream until moist.  Mix in chopped jalapenos to taste.  Mix in cheese to taste.  layer in glass baking tray mixture - layer of cheese - mixture - layer of cheese, top with cheese.  Bake at 375 until brown on top.   

I am vague on the amounts because it really doesn't matter.  This is an easy "eyeball" recipe.

This makes a GREAT side to your Mexican meal!  I left out the cilantro b/c I don't like it, and left out the corn.  It was still wonderful!  The second time I mad it I didn't have green chiles, so I used 1/2 cup of salsa. It was still great!

This is a great recipe. I did use 2 c. sour cream, added black beans and doubled the green chiles. I also added cumin, chili powder and other herbs to boost it up. Next time I will use pepper jack and add roasted red peppers. Chicken would be fabulous too in this!

I made this recipe for a tex-mex dinner party. I left out the chile peppers b/c my mother can't take the heat and cooked the rice according to package directions using vegetable stock. It was a HUGE hit and everyone wished I'd made a bigger batch. Next time, I will adjust the recipe for a larger casserole dish. Hubby suggested making a meal out of it by adding black beans and vegan chicken strips. We'll make it spicy next time, too.

I was skeptical about this one because the reviews are pretty mixed. Overall I thought it was good. Nothing extraordinary, but easy and a nice change from traditional spanish rice. I only used about 3/4 cup of rice and only about 2 tablespoons of cilantro, but kept everything else the same. I still got 6 large servings out of it. I served this with shredded chicken chimichangas and refried beans. I have added it to my recipes and will make again. Thanks!

I thought the dish was a little dry and could use more flavor...so I am making it again and will add 1 1/2 to 2 cups of sour cream, cheddar or Mexican 3 cheese blend, and finely chopped onion.

To make it spicier add a package of dry taco seasoning to the rice mixture when cooking. You will have an all around tastier more flavor filled side dish.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. It was a big hit with half the family. The second time I made it, but left out the sour cream and served it separately so they could put as much or as little of the sour cream as they wanted. It worked out better that way for us.

Yum!! A tip for recipes that call for chicken broth - keep packets of Goya chicken bouillon powder on hand to use in place of that plain ole broth in a can. One of those little powder packets makes 2 cups of flavorful broth - and you can kick up/reduce the flavor as you wish.

This recipe was easy and yummy! I was lazy and didn't put it in the oven though, just choosing to melt cheese on top in the pan it was cooked in. I think it would be good even if you didn't put the sour cream in it. The only thing I did different is add a can of Rotel instead of the can of chiles because I didn't have any. It had a nice little kick to it!

My husband loved this but I really changed the recipe. I used 4 cups diced cooked chicken, 2 cups sour cream, 2 cups Pace picante sauce,1 cup shredded mozzarella/cheddar cheese and 4 cups cooked long grain rice. Topped with another cup of the cheese and baked at 350 for 20 mins.

Easy to make. Just a tad on the bland side for me, but still good. I might try adding some jalapenos or taco seasoning to it next time. I'd like a little more spice. Made this to go with Salsa Chicken and the two were really good mixed together. Nice recipe!

I used brown rice, rotel tomatoes w/green chile peppers, black beans, sharp cheddar cheese and dried cilantro.  Made all on the stove top.  No need to heat the oven.  Great side dish.

Pretty good. I followed reviews & doubled the sour cream, but it was a bit too much. So I think next time I'll follow the recipe, but I will definitely make it again! Went great with our beef enchiladas & refried beans :)

I used a regular size can of corn, drained. I also added about 1/2 cup more of sour cream. I thought it couldve used more cheese, too. Overall, I enjoyed it. It didn't reheat too well the next day, which was a tad disappointing. My family didn't care for the cilantro, so if I made it again, I'd probably leave it out. A good recipe, but needs tweaking.

Good, easy, and bland. I added more sour cream, a can of drained and rinsed black beans, the juice of a lime to the rice, an extra 1/2 c of sour cream with a tsp of taco seasoning, and some Salsa Verde. Next time I'll leave the sour cream at one cup and bump the taco seasoning. Or add more Salsa Verde to the finished casserole. But I'll make it again for sure!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish and will be making it again! We definitely agreed with other reviewers that it needs more moisture, from sour cream or something else. One thing that we also thought was that it is a very versatile recipe and can be made with many other ingredients and flavors, not just a Mexican flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

What a simple, but delicious rice dish.  While making it I was so tempted to add other things like garlic, onions, maybe some herbs or spices.  But it is my first time making a recipe so I try to stay true to the directions and I did.  What came out was this delicious side dish.  I served it with some grilled Mexican rubbed pork steaks.  This is a keeper and will be fixed again.  Thank you Ms. Baker for posting this nice rice dish.

Good, but def needs more seasonings.  I started with Mexican Rice II from this site to get all theat great mexi flavor in there, then added the sour cream, chiles, corn and cilantro.  It needed more than 1 c sour cream and about double the cheese.  I served it with chile verde, so 1 can of green chiles was enuf, but if I was serving with a different mexican maindish, I'd double the chiles too.  You could easily add diced chicken, cream of chicken soup and some black beans for a 1-dish meal.

Very good. :-)  Left out the chile peppers since I don't like them, but sprinkled in some cayenne to give it a kick back.  And I used 1/3 the amount of dry cilantro.  (Unlike most people, I usually prefer dry spices.)  I didn't think it was dry, but I also didn't cook it 30 minutes - maybe more like 20 until it was heated through.  It does, however, have a slight bit of "crispness" to it.  I originally made this a long time ago and wrote a 4 on it, but couldn't remember it very well.  So I re-made it recently and decided it was a 5.  I remember that this was something I didn't think too much of the first couple of bites and then it kind of grew on me.  Or as someone else said, how can you go wrong with sour cream? :-)  (Actually, you can, but not usually.)  Sitting here staring at the recipes, I'm thinking I should make it again tomorrow while I've got sour cream on hand... (it's making me hungry)

Good but just a little dry. I'll add more sour cream next time. I also added some black beans to mine and used brown rice.

Family loved this -I thoght it was good. I added a few spices -cumin, cayenne, chili powder, onion, garlic and chipotle. Doubled the sour cream as suggested by others. With these changes it had a nice warm kick.

I feel bad giving it 4 stars b/c I changed so much, but eh.  I used beef broth, added half a can each of corn, black beans, and tomatoes.  I added a few teaspoons of diced jalapenos (the kind from the jar) and I used one cup of sour cream and half a bar of cream cheese.   Here's what I'll do next time: I'll cut the cream cheese in half and add a bit more sour cream. I'll add more jalapenos and perhaps some cayenne.    I had served this with some chicken that I pan cooked and then slathered with hot salsa. Next time I'll cut up the chicken and mix it directly in the rice, as they worked so well together. I think perhaps the dish was missing spice which is why I gave it a 4 stars. Yummy dish, easy to make substitutions..will keep it in rotation. Thanks!

Yummmy. I really liked this, not sure if the rest of my family did though! I didn't have cilantro so just left that out. I used instant white rice and that worked fine for me. I will make this again! Thanks.

This came out really well. I did add a few things to a double batch: sauted some red onion and green bell peppers a bit, added on can of corn and a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos (including the juice)and one can of diced green chilis. I used one 16 ounce container of fat free sour cream and the cheese I used was a lite mixture of cheddar, jack, asadero and queso blanco. I left out the cilantro since some people don't like it. I added chili powder and cumin as well. This came out wonderfully, wasn't dry at all. I made it the night before and reheated at the church potluck today.

Update to my previous review!  This is a yummy rice dish!  I doubled the amount of kernel corn but other than that, I followed the instructions as is and it turned out very good!  As the main dish, I cooked the Texas style chicken tequila and it turned out to be a great combination due to the Mexican flavor attached to both dishes!  

Previous review: Very good recipe!  I've prepared this dish on three different occasions - the last time being on December 29, 2007 - and it turned out great every time.  I've always included more kernel corn than required.  Since I didn't have green chili peppers, I replaced them with Turkish chili peppers. I'm sure you can replace the green chili peppers with chopped jalapeno peppers or the Muenster cheese with either pepperjack or Mexican / nacho blended cheese. I will definitely make this wonderful dish again.

Sooo good! Used half brown rice and half converted rice, chicken bouillon instead of broth and frozen corn. That's what I had on hand.  My family, including the small grandchildren loved it.  A definate keeper - thanks for sharing this recipe!

My family LOVED this rice, even my picky 5 year old!  I used chicken boullion instead of broth...and did add extra liquid, and used frozen corn instead of canned.  We decided this was definitely a keeper....a truly different, good and easy recipe!  We will make it again!

I would have rated this rice dish 4 stars but my DH liked it less than I did.  I added about 1/4 cup of diced red pepper to the rice, but apart from that we followed the recipe exactly.  I enjoyed it; it was a nice break from the traditional tomato based mexican rice.

'Liked, didn't love; but I may make again - adding additional ingredients like beans or tomatoes.  This is on the bland side like most mexican food is.  I added 1/2t cumin, subbed 1t dried cilantro for fresh.  'Only had 3/4c sour cream & 1/2c cheddar.  The dryness problem is only in the liquid amount used to cook the rice.  16oz is needed for 1c rice.  Simple as that.  I only cooked this stovetop, just stirring.  'Glad I tried it. :)

I LOVE this recipe!! I made a few minor changes based on other reviews. I add a can of diced tomatoes, double the amount of sour cream, use cheddar cheese, and add a chopped up rotisserie chicken to make it a complete meal. I usually don't like eating leftovers, but will eat this over and over again until it's gone. I highly recommend it!

Pretty good, I added a can of Rotel instead of the chiles and I added some taco seasoning to the rice as it was cooking, I think it still needs some more flavor, I love the creamyness  and texture of i just need to make again with some more changes. Thanks for the yummy recipe! :)

I think I judged this too quickly. It is putzy to make with the stovetop cooking and then the oven, but it is pretty good. I actually liked the leftovers better after the rice soaked up the flavors. I had half a jar of salsa leftover so I tossed that in too, similar to other reviewers. My usual method of making Mexican rice involves cooking rice in a rice cooker and then stirring in salsa and cheese while the rice is hot. Not sure this is worth the extra effort but it was fun to try.

I decided to try this recipe to go along with the Green Chili and Cheese Chicken I found on here. The rice was awesome. I did decide to use the frozen steamed in a bag sweet corn instead of canned corn. I think the sweet corn went with it perfectly. I was complimented on the rice several times and everyone went back for seconds and thirds. This is a keeper in my household.

I love rice and enjoyed this rice dish very much.  I tasted it before it went in the oven and it did need extra flavor since it was a little bland as other reviewers have suggested.  I added a few dashes of chili powder, cumin, coriander and garlic powder to the mixture.  I didn't add extra sour cream as others suggested and it was fine to me.  Thanks for a great rice dish!

Made this for an extended family "taco day" and it went very well, enjoyed by adults and kids alike.  I think it would go very well with anything spicy as the sour cream is a nice contrast.

This was good, and the leftovers were also good heated up later.  I wanted to add more substance to the recipe since this was my main dish for the meal, so like other reviewers, I added a can of black beans and a large can of corn.  I didn't have green chilis, so instead, I added a can of drained Rotel (hot) - it gave it some kick!!  This was very tasty, and the cilantro flavor really came through.

I made a double batch since my can of corn and chiles in the cupboard were twice as large as needed. Cook time was not affected. I thought this was delicious. Did not taste bland as other reviews have said. I used the Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles which added a nice amount of heat.

I bought cilantro at the farmers market especially for this recipe. Turns out that apparently I don't like the taste of cilantro, at least not this much in one place. Did not like this recipe at all!

I made this recipe and followed it to the tee.  I was very bland.  This needed some type of seasoning to give it a pop in taste.  Needs something more.

I made this scaling it down to two servings.  For that small amount I didnât want to open a can of green chile peppers, so I subbed a smaller amount of diced jalapenos from a jar.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I was hoping for something a little creamier, but was disappointed.  It looked sort of dry once it was completely mixed, so I baked this for half the time covered with foil.  But that didnât help.  This was also pretty bland.  If I try this one again I may add a little milk hoping to make this creamier and try to jazz up the flavor.

Very relish!  I did add extra sour cream and cheese. It was a big hit. I would say that this recipe, as a side dish, feeds several more than 6.  

Added shredded chicken to leftovers for a main dish later in the week.

Terrific side dish to mexican dishes.  This went perfectly with our burritos.  Unfortunately, I was out of cilantro when I made this, but it was still delicious.

Added: taco seasoning, some garlic, extra sour cream (regular not reduced fat), salsa, finely chopped onion (small amount), bacon bits & chopped chicken to mix. Covered it with extra colby/monterey jack cheese. I don't think it was bland after that.

I thought this was awesome!! I made it ahead to take to a party tomorrow so we'll see if it's dry then, but right now(an hour done), it's incredible. I added cumin to taste. I LOVE cumin. No other changes made. Thank you!!!

just wasn't impressed.....I added the chiles, black beans, doubled the sour cream, but I just felt it was bland.  I took this to a potluck and did have compliments, but for myself I probably won't make this again.

I agree that modifications are needed to make this recipe a 5 star one, however it was good enough to inspire me into writing my first review on this site!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sour cream and green chilis.  I also added black beans.  Next time I will try adding taco seasoning and more heat, because it was still pretty bland.  I served it alongside green enchiladas and it was a lovely complement to them!

Love it!  Simple to make as well.  I wonder if Plain Yogurt could be used instead of Sour Cream.  I'll try that next time.  I sneaked in the sour cream as my Wife and Mother-in-law don't like sour cream. But they gobbled it up anyway.

This is a good combo recipe, I have a hard time keeping fresh cilantro around as it spoils fast.. but I found cilantro in a tube.... this recipe was perfect to use that with... I did not have sour cream at the time so I sub-ed cottage cheese... it still turned out great.. This combo, is a keeper

This was fantastic ... I did, like most cooks, make some minor modifications.  I added a Knorr chipotle bouillon cube and a packet of Knorr Sazon seasoning packet (found in the international aisle) to the rice before cooking.  I sauteed 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves of garlic and added those to the rice mixture before baking.  I was out of cilantro, so that got left out.  This was some of the best Mexican style rice we've ever had.  I WILL be making this again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was very good and creamy, simple to make.  It had a nice mild spicy flavor.  I added about 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  This would really be good with some type of southwestern grilled chicken.  I would make this again.

This was a  fine meal. I made the rice more of a "Mexican" rice by adding hot sauce and tomato paste while cooking then followed the directions. It was really good and I can't wait to eat it again! This will for sure be one of my new side dishes on Mexican night!

This was decent.  But, I do agree with others, it was missing a little something.  I didn't have any green chilies, so I added a can of mexi-corn.  I also added a little garlic and some cumin.  Turned out pretty good and made a good side dish with our burritos.

I liked this recipe, but mine turned out a little dry even though I added more sour cream and salsa. The taste was good, and if not for the dryness, we would have liked it much better. Nice side dish for taco night.

This was good but I'll cut back on the cilantro by half.  It was a little strong.  Also could use just a little more liquid since it was just a little dry.  (Could be the reduced fat sour cream's fault too)

This dish is AWESOME!! I have NEVER had anything this good, not even at some of my favorite Mexican restaurants. We left out the cilantro since we're not big fans, and used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (drained)...FABULOUS!!!! The flavors just melt together perfectly, with just the right amount of heat. I could not get enough of this, and this is now a favorie side dish in our home!!!

A tasty side dish.  Nothing too fancy, but always well received. I recommend using pepper jack cheese on the top for a little extra kick.

I used this recipe as a side dish for an anniversary party of about 100 people.  It really got rave reviews!  I used instant rice and adjusted the chicken broth to compensate for that.  I also used regular sour cream and shredded chedder cheese just because they have those in the bulk sizes.  Very good and different recipe!  Thanks!

This really wasn't very good.  My wife wouldn't even eat it.  I added salsa and ate it as a chip dip.  My daughter (3 yrs) ate it, but she made us put peanut butter on it (??).  My 20 month old son ate it.  It gets two stars because I added the leftovers to some homemade chili and it tasted really good with the chili.

Great base recipe. Easy to change without messing it up.  As others suggested I made it a main dish with chicken in it. Quick and easy side or main dish, lots of room to play but it is perfectly good as is.  I sautÃ©ed some onions diced before adding rice and browned it a bit.  Yum!  I love that itâs creamy and no cream of whatever soup.  Thanks!

I made this tonight, and really liked it!   The only changes I made were , no cilantro (I didnât have any.  Plus, not a fan. ), extra sour cream and extra cheese.   Because, I love both.  ;)

Wonderful! Needed garlic. Use 2 cups of sour cream to make it nice and creamy. Added a jar of green chili salsa to perk up with onion and garlic flavors. Adding cumin as another reviewer suggested was spot on. I doubled the recipe as I have a large family. They ate it up!

I wish I didnât follow the advice of one reviewer that said to add more sour cream....it turned out mushy!  I recommend everyone follow the original recipe.    Even with the over-used sour cream, this rice casserole was pretty awesome.  My husband loved the flavor.  I will definitely make it again....next time following the recipe explicitly.

We made some vegetarian modifications to meet our families needs. I followed the first reviews suggestions, 2cans of black beans, 2cans of green chilies, and for the second c of sour cream I used Chobani Savor low fat plain yogurt. I added mushrooms and onions, and substituted a blend of white, red, brown, & wild rice. I served it with sliced avocado and siracha sauce drizzled on top. The hubby and I lived it, and the 8 yr old approved.

LOVED it! We made this vegan by using daiya cheese, vegetable broth, and vegan sour cream or vegan plain yogurt (almond or coconut yogurts have worked.) It's a hit, even with non-vegans. I've added beans to it sometimes for protein.

This recipe was a hit with my family, especially my 25-yo son! My only complaint was that I felt like the rice was still a little hard even though I partially precooked it based on another reviewer's recommendation. I think I'm going to have to completely pre-cook the rice.

Turned out great. Combined other reviews and added a personal twist. Used a can of black beans, 2 cups sour cream, small diced red pepper, cumin, cayenne pepper along with the other ingredients. Topped in with black olives, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of cilantro. YUMMO!!!!  Next time I'll add some chicken, too.

I almost always follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, but this time I read all the reviews and it seemed that most people thought two cups of sour cream instead of one was better, so I tried it that way. For me, this was way too much, as the taste was overwhelmingly sour cream-y.  I did add a can of black beans, rinsed and drained and liked that addition. I also used a can of Rotel instead of the peppers and I thought that worked well. So, even though I hate to be one of those people who changes the recipe and then reviews it, I think this would be a good dish made with one cup of sour cream as called for, and adding a can of black beans and subbing Rotel for peppers because I like the added tomato taste. One other thing in the original recipe that I did have a problem with was that the amount of chicken broth used to cook the rice was insufficient. The rice boiled dry long before it was cooked and I had to add quite a bit more broth to finish cooking it. No one else has mentioned this so I wonder if I did something wrong, but just be aware of this.  The broth did give the rice an excellent flavor though.  UPDATE: I did try this again with the revisions I thought would help and they did.  I used 16 ounces of chicken broth instead of 14, and it worked much better for me. I  added a can of rinsed black beans  and again subbed rotel for the peppers. I used about 1 1/4 c. of sour cream and doubled the cheese that you mix in. The family thought it was much better than

I would not criticize a recipe if I changed it; Here, I took a combination of others contributions and made my own version.  I didn't measure everything very precisely but here goes what I added:  a few Tbs. of salsa, chopped green onions, chopped snow peas (1/4 cup?) and chopped black olives.  I used all the other ingredients as directed except sharp cheddar instead of jack.  seasonings:  salt, garlic salt, pepper, cumin, turmeric.  Loved it totally.  I think sour cream is such a winner that I often use it in recipes where it isn't listed.  It really makes a difference in so many dishes.  I like that others add their 2 cents; makes it feel more natural...Thanks! sufina

I liked this. I added more broth, some black beans, and some diced jalapeÃ±os. I will definitely make it again!

I thought the rice was undercooked making it according to those directions.  I ended up covering it with foil to try and cook the rice a little more while it baked.  I also added a second cup of sour cream, a second 4 once can of green chillies, a cup of salsa, a can of black beans, a full cup of cheese and a second cup on the top, and 1.5 tablespoons of  ground cumin.  It was ok but still a little tasteless.  It wasn't dry at all like some other reviews said.  I would maybe use a can of cream of chicken soup next time instead of the second cup of sour cream?  Or add some taco seasoning?  It looked like it was going to be delicious.  It was just a little tastless :(

I added extra chopped chiles since I had an open can in the frig, which made it almost too hot for me.   My husband liked it though which was kind of a surprise since he's not that wild about rice dishes generally.

Thai was REALLY GOOD.  My husband ate almost all of it.  The only change I made was to use full fat sour cream, and to cook the rice according to package instructions.  I also used frozen corn as I did not have any canned.  I am always looking for new "starchy" food recipes, and this is the first one in a long time that I felt sounded good enough to try.  I am very glad I did and will definitely add  it to my standby list of favorites!

One of our favorite side dishes to go with chicken enchiladas.  I like to add some black beans as well.

I've made this several times and I really do like it but feel it needs something.  Tonight I made with with Enchiladas with Red Enchilada Sauce and, on my own plate, I poured some of the sauce over the rice - it was great.  I could see just adding some chicken on top and some red enchilada sauce and having this be a meal.  Oh some more cheese isn't bad either.  :)

I loves me some sour cream, but this was too "sour creamy" for my taste. Still, I appreciate and enjoyed the recipe so I will def use it again.

I made this for a birthday celebration for my mom, who loves mexican food, and it was a hit! I paired it with chicken enchiladas, and boy was it a filling meal.  My whole family loved it! Very tasty! 

I substituted sharp cheddar cheese for the Monterey Jack and left out the cilantro and it was still very good.

My husband and I both loved it! My personal tweaks were using a can of Rotel (tomatoes and chilis) instead of just chilis and adding black olives. This was a marvelous and easy side dish with enchiladas. We will definitely make this again!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I saw a few "tweaks" other users had made, so I increased sour cream to 2 cups.  I only used 1 can of chiles, because my husband doesn't like them, but next time I will use 2 because I love them!  it's delicious, a winner!

Yummy! Followed Stephanie's suggestions. Made my own emeril's seasoning mix which is just 1 part each thyme, oregano, cayenne, onion powder and black pepper, to two parts each salt and garlic powder and 2 1/2 parts paprika. Used only 3/4 can of chili's since that's spicy enough for me and leaves me enough left to make Rice Elena another recipe I love  just the way I like it. Instead of broth I used 2  cups water which is what works well for a cup of rice, and cooked 15 minutes then removed from heat and let sit covered 5 minutes more.I never use cilantro since I don't care for it. Might try with ground coriander when I have some which I read might be a good substitute.

As is, the recipe is ok...bland for sure, so would please those who don't like spice.  Good alternative side dish for Mexican food, but tweak per your liking.

Other than doubling this for a potluck, I also used a Mexican blend shredded cheese, instead of just Monterey Jack. It was AWESOME! Thank you.

tried this recipe twice. second time altered recipe by upping sour cream by 1/2 cup, adding another can of chilies and a teaspoon of emeril's seasoning. i am not a fan of cilantro so i crushed some coriander and a bit of celery seed and added that to the cooking rice.
also i think 30 min. baking is a bit too long. 25 min. with a couple of minutes under the broiler to brown the cheese is plenty. got rave reviews from family and friends.

I have made this twice. Being single I like one dish meals so the first one I was having checkin breast with it so I browned the checken and cut it in bite size and mixed with the rice. The 2nd time I was having fresh yellow tail tuna and sierd the fish then placed 1/2 of the rice in a pan then placed the fish and covered with the rest. Both were great.

Waaaaay too much sour cream. If I make this again, I'll cut it down to 3/4 or 1/2 cup. The other flavors were great though, the sour cream just overpowered them.

We enjoyed this very much. After tasting, I did add a bit more spice for our tastes. Also, I had about 1/2 cup of leftover Black Beans I threw in. Have already shared this recipe with my sisters

This was amazing!  I made it for company and it was a hit. The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 a can of jalapeÃ±os instead of green chiles. The dish had a ton of flavor, def a keeper for us!

I found this to be VERY bland so next time I will replace the green chile peppers with jalapeno or serrano peppers.  I also used frozen corn since I didn't have the canned.  My guests liked this, but they don't like spicy... :-)

I LOVE this recipe!! I leave out the Corn and use Black beans instead... (Personal preference/allergy) and I season it a little differently, but such a delicious recipe!! My husband and I both like it. He especially likes it as a side to Ham Steak. So tasty... Good as  meal on it's own or as a side.

I used brown rice, added enough liquid for it and did not use the veggies (just used cilantro) and I also used Cheddar cheese, as I wanted my kids to eat it and they did!  They are a 'not mixed in' crowd when it comes to veggies.  It was delicious.

We have 7 kids and EVERYONE liked this! I made it without cilantro because I had forgotten to pick it up - and it was still good.  I added a half of a pack of cream cheese as well. Very good!

This was excellent!  I gave it four stars because it was kind of boring to start with, but that's the way a recipe should start!  I followed the recipe, except that all I had was a jalapeno pepper (which I seeded and diced), dry cilantro and a bigger can of corn (15 oz. instead of 8.75).  It was a bit dry so I increased the sour cream by about 3/4 c. and pepped it up with some paprika (great color!), cumin, and chili powder for some kick.  The light sour cream was perfect flavor!  I garnished it with a lime and figured lime and cilantro go together, so I squeezed some on top and MAN... was it ever good.  Next time I may add lime juice from the get-go.  I'm not buying the boxed Mexican rice EVER again.

I have to say that this one of the best rice sides I have ever made!  The only changes I made were to use low fat yogurt instead of sour cream (didn't have any on hand) and I had no cilantro so I added dried chives.  These small changes were perfect and I will make this side again and agian and again!!!

Pretty good, I did not have any cilantro, used some cumin. I will make it again. I didn't think it was too dry as some of the other reviewers did. Chicken would definitely be a nice addition to make this a main dish.

My husband was very skeptical of this and wrinkled up his nose at it as I was mixing it all together.  Then he tasted it and a big smile just spread across his face.  It was great and I will definitely be making it again.

With some changes it was great.  Here is what I did: Diced 1/2 onion, 1 bell pepper, combined with one can blk beans and 2c frozen corn, and heated in skillet with oil, garlic and 1T cumin, 1T cayenne, 2T paprika.  I mixed the heated combo with rice cooked in chicken broth, 2 sm cans green chilis, tex mex cheese, 1 sm container reduced fat sour cream, and 3 lrg cans of chicken. Topped with a bit of the cheese, baked at 350 for 30 minutes and garnished with green onion.  Served with salsa and quacamole -- everyone loved adding to the flavors to make it their own.  Made this with the Margarita cake (though I made changes there too).  Great Tex Mex nite with stuff I usually already have on hand.

This was really good.  I combined it with Green Chili and Cheese Chicken on this site.  Used fat-free sour cream and pepper jack cheese.  Then I placed the chicken breasts on top, topped with more green chilies and more pepper jack cheese.  Yummy!  Next time I might use black beans instead of corn and add some onion and green pepper.  Will definitely make again.  Update:  Just made this again with about 1/2 cup diced onion, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and black beans instead of corn.  Omitted fresh cilanto because husband doesn't like it.  Put Green Chili and Cheese Chicken on top.  This is probably the best Mexican casserole I've ever made or eaten!  Absolutely wonderful!!

For our tastes, this needed a little kicking up, so I added in garlic and onion powders, a bit of cayenne and chili powder. Not a cilantro fan, so I left it out. All in all, a pretty good side you can certainly play around with. Thank you!

This was pretty good rice but kind of bland by itself (3 stars).  I added it with a recipe I found on here called "Lime Chicken Picante" and put it all in a tortilla with lettuce and black beans and then I sprayed lime over it and that was delicious!!!  5 stars for that one!!!

This recipe was just ok for us and kind of bland. We are not huge cilantro fans, so it needed some other seasonings in addition to the cilantro.

My husband and I both liked this. Per the other reviews, I added more sour cream and black beans. I also added a package of frozen southwestern corn with the peppers and onions. I used instant rice also. This was very good and I will make it again. I only added 1 can of green chilis but will add 2 next time. I think I will also use Pepper Jack cheese to give it a little more zip.

I think this recipe is fantastic. I used some other suggestions adding black beans!  I also used brown rice. Made a huge serving and have eaten for lunch for last 3 days! Thanks for great recipe!

This was good but not out of this world.  It could have used a little more flavor, maybe hot sauce and a can of jalapeno.  I did like it better reheated the second day.

This was awesome!  Since I eat a Ketogenic diet I replaced the rice with 3 cups of riced cauliflower an sautÃ©ed it with some olive oil, chicken broth, chicken and onion before adding to the other ingredients.  I doubled the sour cream and added the black beans as suggested by other reviewers.  I also added about 1/2 cup of salsa and a sprinkle of taco seasoning.  It turned out to be a delicious dinner and low carb!

I absolutely loved this rice recipe.  Had all items on hand except for the green chilis so I cut up some jalapenos from the jar.  It was really really good.

A great side dish with tacos or burritos.
Did take other reviewers advice and near doubled the sour cream and used frozen corn. Also used pepper jack cheese instead of chillies and added a little taco seasoning.

My family LOVED this. The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of chipotle pepper in adobo sauce to the sour cream. Gave it a lovely smoky flavor. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this last night and followed the recipe exactly.  Although the flavor was good we thought it was a little on the dry side.  The photo makes it look like there is something red in the ingredients - salsa perhaps?  Next time I will add about 1/2 cup of salsa and I bet it will be excellent.

Terrific recipe!  My whole family enjoyed it and we will definitely make this again!  We paired it with Mexican Style Shredded Pork recipe (from this website) and it was a huge hit! I used regular sour cream, that was the only revision I made to the recipe.

Thanks!!

Great side dish!  I originally made it to put something saucy over, but it stands alone with a nice creamy sauce of it's own.

I have to agree with the other viewers this was pretty bland.  It was good but just felt like it needed something more.  May try adding some more spice next time. Or maybe a pepperjack cheese.

LOL I'm one of those annoying reviewers that changed the recipe alot but will still review it.

We didn't have any plain rice so I used a Rice a Roni box of long grain and pilaf.  But then I added the green salsa, sour cream and cheese which was totally from the recipe.  It was delicious!!!

We really liked this recipe, I did use the other feedback to add to the original recipe though. I added extra sour cream and a 1/2 jar of salsa and then a thin layer of salsa on top of the mix before the cheese in the casserole dish. My boyfriend even added a little hot sause to his!

I thought this receipe was really good and a nice addition to our dinner last night. Based on the other reviews I just mixed in sour cream until it looked creamy but I have no idea how much it actually was and I had no problem with it being dried out. I followed everything else except for eliminating the chilies because I didn't have any and I just don't think the texture of the chilies and the texture of the rice would really work out for me.

Really great and creamy.  Easy as pie to make and the flavor is nice.  I omitted the corn as my husband is a big corn fan, and even without the staple ingredient, it came out lovely.

I had something similar to this a friend of mine had made and I was trying to re-create it.  I didn't have any cilantro on hand and I didn't want to use the green chilis but pretty much stuck to the other indgrediants.  I used sharp cheddar cheese because that's what I always have on hand and probably prefer it anyhow.  My friend had some roasted red peppers on the top of hers and that was nice too.  A good side dish to serve instead of plain white rice for a change.

A Hit! My fellow employees and myself are doing a diet together and so I shared this recipe with everyone. I added chicken to mine. I will add a little more cheese and sour cream, and will replace the green chiles with diced onions or peppers next time. Thanks for a new favorite!

This recipe sounded so good but the end result had a funny taste - probably from the canned veggies (we rarely use canned).  Next time I'll replace canned corn with frozen, and green chilies with some kind of fresh peppers.

This recipe was pretty good.  Not quite 5 star worthy though.  I left out cilantro because we are not big fans.  I added more cheese on top because around here we are CHEESE FREAKS!!  Other than that, I didn't change anything and I will definately make it again!  Thanks.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe.  It was really easy to make and tasty too.  The chile peppers really give it a nice kick.
