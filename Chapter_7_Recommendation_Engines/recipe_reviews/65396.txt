I made this stuffing part of this Turkey for Christmas 2010. It was my first Christmas married. We used Jerk Seasoning on the outside (on request of my husband.) and used this stuffing on the inside. I couldn't find Ground lamb for the life of me so we used ground beef instead.   I'm didnt rate it when I made it because of the two changes were a bit drastic. However, its 10 months later, and out of nowhere my husband requested the same turkey this year for thanksgiving. He looked hopeful and very excited. He enjoyed it enough to suggest we bring it to the 'big family event' to share with others.   so it was "Out of the blue remember and still love' good.    I am not a stuffing fan. Infact, usually i avoid it at all costs. I enjoyed this stuffing very much. And also look forward to trying it again.    looks like we have one of our first family traditions beginning with this recipe. Thank you.

This was okay.  It wasn't what I had expected, but it was still okay.  I added garlic because we just can't have anything without garlic.  The broth from the pan was outstanding!!  THE best I have ever tasted.  I will make this again just for the broth!!

I haven't cooked my turkey according to this recipe but I have made the stuffing, it is so good. I'll be making it again this year all my picky eaters gobbled it up. I had printed this recipe and wanted to make sure I had a digital copy I don't want to risk losing it.
