Very nice.  I wasn't sure whether the apples and pears needed peeled, but I did peel them.  Maybe next time I'll try without and see.  I can be an extremely lazy cook and while I wanted to make applesauce with pears to use up the pears I had, I really didn't feel like cooking it last night, so I put it in the crock pot overnight.  I eyeballed ingredients, mixed it up, and left it on low all night.  Woke up to a wonderful smelling house.  I chose not to puree this but just mashed it with a potato masher in the crock pot so I'd get a chunky applesauce.  It worked perfectly, and this is very tasty.  I used rather tart apples so was worried I'd need sugar immediately, but it is definitely sweet enough warm not to worry about it.  Very nice for breakfast with a side of toast!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe but instead of water I used pineapple juice. It turned out fantastic.  If you like it a little on the sweeter side this is the way to go. Oh, by the way,  the pineapple juice also acts as a preservative so the apples /pears don't turn brown.

The pears I used weren't quite sweet enough, so I ended up adding maybe a Tbsp of sugar, I also added about a 1/4 tsp of salt to accentuate the flavors.  Loved the buttery smooth texture of this sauce!

yummy  I love bananas, so I added one banana and the flavor really came through.  Homemade applesauce is much, much better than store purchased.

Super easy to make, and absolutely delicious.  I didn't process it though, just mashed it manually because we like a chunkier sauce.

Delicious and not too sugary. I ended up just mashing up the apples and pears instead of running through a processor and it worked out great.

Thanks for the recipe.  I didn't simmer it, but used my Blendtec to purée everything and added a little bit of honey and it was delicious.

Great recipe and so simple. Absolutely foolproof.  I opted for not using my blender and instead just used an Irish Potato masher as i like my apple sauce a bit chunky.  i added a wee bit more  cinnamon because, well, I really like cinnamon. ;-)

This tasted very good, though I agree with the other reviewers who stated it was a little thin. The next time I make this, I'll use half as much water since the fruit releases so much juice as it cooks. I wasn't sure whether to peel the fruit. Many other recipes recommend leaving the peel for better texture and nutrition, but I wasn't sure my food processor could handle the skins. I ended up peeling the apples only. There were some tiny pieces of pear skin after I pureed, but I probably wouldn't have noticed them if I wasn't looking for them. I'll probably try leaving all the skins in the future.

Made this recipe,  but quadrupled the amount since i had a surplus of ripe D'anjou pears & Granny Smiths.  Also,  halved the amount of vanilla extract,  because I had a vanilla bean that I cut in half and split open & let cook down into the sauce.  Removed the vanilla pod before I put into the processor though. Came out great! Ended up freezing some for later after I gave some to friends.

I needed an applesauce without added sugar for my detox & this recipe was a perfect fit. The only thing I did different was to use vanilla from the bean & threw in a cinnamon stick while it was boiling. Definitely will make again detox or not.

Best applesauce I've made. The vanilla is a great partner with the apples and pears. Made several batches when the pears came to me all at once. Put packets of sauce in the freezer. Great comfort food recipe.

Great recipe! The fam loved it! I simmered the pears & apples in apple juice, and added cinnamon.  I did peel everything, because the recipe was not clear and I didn't want the skins in the way.  I doubled the recipe, but only added a cup of apple juice (instead of water for sweetness) but still lots of liquid.  So I put through a strainer before mashing.  I love the flavor of this combo, will be making again for sure!

very easy to make! I live at a high elevation so i didn't have to cook it that long with lid off to get rid of most of the liquid. I also added a pinch of salt because, why not add flavor! I didn't have very ripe fruit as they were from a friends tree and hadn't fully ripened yet so I added about a tsp of sugar. When I blended it I added a few drops of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon sugar because my family loves the cinnamon flavor!

This was delicious!  I made it as directed. I chose to peel my fruit because that's how I like it.  I also just mashed it with a potato masher because we like it chunky and I didn't feel like dirtying my food processor (one less dish to clean)! It's true that you can alter the amount of water depending on how ripe your fruit is and how thick or liquidy you like your sauce. It doesn't call for any sugar which tastes fine but I added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar because we like it sweet but in retrospect it would have been amazing without it too.  It smelled great while cooking and came together quickly.  I'm definitely going to be making this more often this coming Fall!

I will definitely make it again and I made some Sweet changes. I did peel the fruit and chopped it  very finely as I don't have a food processor. Instead of a tsp of vanilla I used a quarter tsp vanilla and the same amount of white sugar.  I added only a little cinnamon at the end of the second simmer as I don't care for over seasoning with cinnamon.  It occurred to me that raisins would add a taste of natural sugar and stirred in a handful. Because I finely hand chopped the apples, the sauce had a  natural texture to it - not chunky and not like baby food. My grandchildren dove right in - and they won't eat applesauce  from the jar or those little plastic containers.

Very nice! I really liked this, it's a good healthy snack and works well for people like me whose stomachs cant handle fruit very well. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because mine turned out a bit too sweet, possibly because my pears were big and ripe. Next time I'll try cutting back on the pears and adding more apples.

We had a case of apples and pears to use that were quickly becoming overripe, so this recipe was a good solution to avoid spoilage. I multiplied the recipe by five and it turned out great. Plenty sweet without adding any sugar.

I made this recipe in wok. I think it turned pretty good not as sweet as I would like but I am type 2 . But less is better.
I added  1/8th of a cup of sugar and a pinch of salt along with a bit of nut meg.

Loved it. Add sugar to taste if your fruit isn't sweet enough, as is sadly sometimes the case with grocery store pears.

Wonderful! Best pear/ applesauce I've ever had. I drizzled about a teaspoon of honey into the food processor while making it and it's amazing!

Tasted great! I left it chunky because that's how I like it. It did look more runny than I had expected but it didn't taste runny/liquidy
