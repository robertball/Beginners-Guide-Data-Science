12.24.16 ~ I LOVED this dip. I made a spicy version and a non-spicy version. My jalapeños were very hot, so I made this awesomely delicious dip for those of us who can take the heat. I used mild green chili's for those that can't handle the heat. I made up the dip at home and baked it and then put it in two dip size crock-pots. I also think this would make a wonderful filling stuffed in a chicken breast. A dip I will MOST definitely be making again.

It was runny with the frozen cranberries.  I think you need to use frozen so they keep their shape.  I would partially thaw them out on a paper towel to get rid of the moisture.  I would mix mild cheddar with the American; I would be generous on the jalapenos.  It is a really interesting dip because the jalapeno builds in your mouth after you are finished with your bite.  I have a cranberry loving friend who is going to use it for Thanksgiving.  I will make this again.

I think I will be trying Velveeta instead of American cheese because of the better dipping qualities

I used fresh cranberries boiled in a little orange juice first then let it set up. Mixed cream cheese with some velveeta and cheddar added jalapeno then broiled it. Great, orange juice just added to it.

Came out better than I expected. I personally like a little more spice, but it was more than enough flavor.

This does sound delicious... I would think a mild cheddar cheese could sub for the American cheese if not available

I made it without Land O Lakes cheese and blended dried cranberries instead of fresh. It was amazing

I was really excited to find a recipe that I could use my cranberries in. It was a great dip. I thought it needed to be a little sweeter so I drizzled some maple syrup over the top and we all thought that was what it needed. My son said we have to make it a Thanksgiving tradition appetizer. I figure we can do both Christmas and Thanksgiving. We didn't have baguettes so we just ate it with crackers.

This was a huge hit. Served with garlic toasts, celery sticks, and naan. I had a lot of jalapeños in the garden so I sautéed 2 and used those.  Otherwise followed the recipe and it was awesome.  Will make often.  Thank you!

This was good.  I used cheddar and mozzarella because that's what I had.

To answer your question, I think it just means use real American cheese and not the cheap processed cheese that has more chemicals than dairy products.
