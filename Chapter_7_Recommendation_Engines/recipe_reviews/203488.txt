The original recipe that I submitted actually called for almond extract in both the cake and icing.  It also has toasted almonds, not pecans, in the icing. Not sure why they changed it.

My family really enjoyed this cake! We all love Texas Sheet Cake, so I had to try this recipe to see what the "opposite" cake would be like.  The batter is quite thin, but bakes to a moist, soft cake. The frosting went well with the cake---work quickly, because it firms in a short time. I lightly toasted the pecans before adding them to the frosting.  The cake itself is a near-match for a tea cake recipe I've been searching for, so I will also use this recipe for it and substitute a glaze for the frosting. I will definitely make Alaska Sheet Cake again---thanks, Kim!

I made this for a friend who requested it for his birthday cake. I have never heard of it before. It was a huge hit. I had to make a 2nd one for my husband who LOVED it. I left out the pecans because he doesn't care for them. I also baked it for 22 minutes.

This cake did not turn out as I hoped. My friends and I all thought it tasted off, but when we gave it to some other people we knew, they thought it tasted very moist. Nonetheless, I don't think I'll be making this again.

Excellent cake.  I skipped the nuts, and used vanilla instead of almond.  The cake is very sweet and moist.  It could stand on it's own without the frosting as well.  Quick and easy.

very good cake!  I will make again!  Like the others, I did need to cook it about 10 minutes longer but it was great.

A simple and delicious recipe, although it took my cake an extra nearly ten minutes to bake.  The icing does set up fairly quickly so must be spread quickly.  I put the toasted chopped nuts on the top rather than in the icing and pressed them in slightly.  I'll definitely make this again.  Next time I'll add a smig of almond extract to the icing.

So glad I did a sample of this before using for a big BBQ party. I wanted to use this recipe because it served a lot but it makes such a flat cake that the presentation is seriously lacking. I omitted the almond because I don't like almond extract.  I tried to use buttermilk in the frosting/icing and it got all lumpy on me. Really easy to do with good flavor. Would work for a little snack cake but not a party cake.

This was amazing. I'm usually a chocolate girl but this cake may have converted me. Just a few notes: Don't forget to add the baking powder and baking soda - I added it with the flour/salt. The batter is quite liquid-y. I had to bake more than the stated time (about 30 minutes). All in all, a tasty dessert that will certainly grace my table again in the near future.

The weirdest cake I've ever had, not really cake like at all. Kind of dense and really thin. Maybe that's how this cake is supposed to be, but none the less, I didn't like it.

Although I use this site often, this is my first rating but there is such a disparity or ratings, I am prompted to add mine.  I am a very experienced cook and often read the ratings realizing much depends on the skill and expectation of the person making the recipe.  I saved this recipe quite some time ago and today needed a quick dessert I could serve in a hurry.  I have to say, for what I expected, a very good moist cake with excellent flavor, I am not disappointed.  I made it exactly as written, which I always do the first time I make something, exept left out the nuts as I am serving it with rasperries and ice cream or lemon curd and whipped cream, whichever people want.  I added the almond to the icing as well as the cake, as the original submitter indicated.  I admit to being a white cake fan, so I love this.

Fairly good, but a wee bit rich...this recipe uses almost a pound of butter! (3 quarters). There are simpler and more tasty versions of white Texas Sheet Cake on this site.
