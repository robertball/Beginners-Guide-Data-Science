Yo Ho Ho and a pie full of YUM!
Seriously, everything's better with rum and this pie is no exception! I made as directed, except adding in a few extra peaches, I used 10 large in all. The spices were right on and the rum added a great flavor. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing, Chelipepper!

Yes, everything is better with rum. Even peach pie. Couldn't find any plain rum in the house, so I substituted some vanilla flavored rum, which went really well with the flavor of the peaches. I also substituted 1/3 cup of tapioca pudding for the 1/3 cup of flour. My great grandmother swore by tapioca to thicken pies and said you can substitute an equal amount in any recipe calling for flour. The filling thickened and the bottom crust did not get soggy. I will definitely make this again.

This is the best peach pie I have ever made.  I will use this peach pie recipe over and over again.  I find that you can also make peach cobbler out of this recipe.  The cinnamon, cardamon, and ground allspice adds so much flavor to this recipe, it makes this pie soooo --- delicious.  I did leave out the rum , and used 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  The next time I am going to use rum extact in place of the rum. This pie turned out so perfect. I would advise anyone that uses this recipe to use the fresh peaches has directed.  I would rate this recipe has a 5 star recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fabulous.  I have to admit that I think I like it more before it was cooked than after - the filling is to die for!!!  I am going to use the filling on icecream!!! Not to detract from how deliciouse the pie was once it was cooked.  Love it!

I didnt have allspice, cardamom, or rum. I did use walnut toffee bourbon and added a Tbl of honey. This recipe is amazing. It was gone in 2 days. I will definitely make it again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Best Peach Pie I’ve Ever Eaten!  Changed recipe a little.  I used a lg can of peach halves.  Omitted the rum & allspice.  Baked a total of 15 minutes at 400 and 45 minutes at 350.  It not only looked delicious but tasted so too.

6.24.18 The rum was lost in the pie, so I won’t bother to add that in the future.  I accidentally did an egg wash on the crust (just so used to doing that) instead of brushing with milk, otherwise, followed the recipe which turned out well.

This recipe makes a delicious & beautiful peach pie! I will make it again, but will probably use a little more sugar than the recipe calls for. My family likes it real sweet.

First time I made it. I didn't have enough peaches. Also dairy ready crust was too thick. 
Made it a second time with one extra peach and used two deep dish frozen crusts thawed. Used exactly the ingredients and didn't leave on 350 for full 30 minutes and it came out perfect. Not really a flaw in this recipe, I just had to redo it for my first mistakes. Very good. Love it.

We live aboard our boat in Baltimore and this recipe was easy to make and delish!  I used Pusser's Rum (and added a little extra) and fresh farm stand Freestone peaches which made it awesome!  I did not have any cardamom so I just added a little nutmeg and extra cinnamon and it worked well.  Definitely worth it!  YUM

Delicious! I used 2 bags of frozen peaches, un-thawed, so it did take longer to bake, but that was to be expected. Great flavor and just enough sweetness. Served this warm w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream and  a drizzle of caramel sauce~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Though this is a good recipe, I have found that when it comes to peach pies epescially; that 1/2 a cup white sugar & 1/2 a cup of brown sugar are very vital to the taste of the pie. I ommitted the allspice and the cardamom. I also added a 1/4 more teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. vanilla. Fresh peaches are a must. Some people don't like the taste of nutmeg, if you don't like it,sub with the cardamom, allspice or just omitt it. Hope this helps.

Not sure why, but it did not taste good at all.  Tart, weird spices, and did not look good.  A waste of some great peaches.
