This is awesome! I didn't have orange juice so I used some V8 Orange & Pineapple juice. Didn't have fresh ginger, but I did add some flax seed. Everything else was as is. It was actually quite good that way, and the right amount of sweet with nothing else added!
Lisa, Thanks for your idea.

I've been trying several smoothie recipes lately but this one is my favorite so far.  I did, however, add half an avocado for creaminess, but this one is super delicious!
