These cookies turned out delicious. I used honey instead of corn syrup with no ill effects. Quick tip-make sure you make them nice and long, extra pointy when you shape them, and keep them cold. =)

I made these on a whim for my sister for Christmas since she really wants a hedgehog. They turned out super cute, but the cookie itself is not good. I found it bland and tasted like I bit into a bunch of flour. I will maybe use another sugar cookie recipe as a base next time if I make these again.  I did add a bit of milk as another reviewer mentioned because the dough was too dry. I also used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and nose so I wouldn't have to mess with a piping bag. I just put them in a little bit after the cookies came out of the oven. Cute cookies, just not something I would like to actually eat. Since I put effort into these, I will still give them to my sister...but I suspect she will end up throwing them out after she tastes one. :(

I made these today, the cookie is delicious. I think I found my favorite sugar cookie recipe. I used butter instead of shortening, and honey instead of corn syrup. They can out just fine, I also halved the recipe. The only "con" was that the cookies spread a little, but I reshaped them before they cooled. They look great! I think next time I will add a touch of lemon zest, to give it a bit of a zing. I highly recommend these cookies, they're so cute!

Definitely very cute and delicious! My one complaint would be that decorating them is very time consuming and the eyes and nose are very hard to get right. Also the cookie dough is SUPER dry so I just added milk until it wasn't so crumbly and was more of a batter and not some damp crumbs. They turned out great though. I would just recommend adding some milk!

I made these with my 13-yo daughter and she brought them into school. The kids loved them, the only complaint was there were none left for me! Gotta make a double-batch for sure!

I would likely make it again, i would mention that the dough can seem very bulky/thick once it is shaped and baked and would try to skim down the cookie size without compromising the shape. A bit of nutmeg or orange zest as I tried also provided some relief for a very plain and somewhat dry cookie.

We made this recipe for Halloween but we shaped the dough into tiny mice. I always make homemade treats for the kids. Every year I make Carmel Popcorn Balls, cupcakes,  and then I make something different. This last Halloween we made the mice. The kids LOVED them and  went NUTS!  I highly recommend this recipe.??

We thought these would look fun to make.  Cute concept, but more effort than it's worth.  We used butter instead of butter flavored shortening (yuk), but even that didn't make the taste what I was hoping for.  The cookies tasted just OK but they are cute for decorations.

I'm sorry to say that we were not fans of these cookies. We felt like the cookie part tasted a little bit like play-doh. Maybe we used the wrong type of shortening, however it still didn't have much flavor. The cookie also didn't flatten out like it appeared to in the photos and video. 

We were going to include these with our Christmas cookies and give them out - especially to a friend who just bought a hedgehog as a pet. However, we decided they weren't good enough to give out. After trying a few, we decided just to get rid of them. If I were to try this again, I would add some flavor to the cookie - maybe orange zest as I think someone else mentioned.

These cookies are so yummy and so cute.  Plus they ship really well since they are sturdy.  I added a little pink heart shaped candy to the nose of each one which made them especially cute.

I made these EXACTLY as described, but then I needed to make a "quick batch" for a surprise party and didn't have time to make them from scratch.  I took Milanos, melted the chocolate and instead of just nuts I mixed in Heath toffee bits. Cookies were not as good as the homemade, but worked out and people loved them!

Super cute and were a hit, with a few adjustments...
1) they were VERY dry, I ended up adding milk so I could finish mixing the dry and wet ingredients. They turned out quite dry as well, so I’d recommend using another sugar cookie recipe and molding them into the hedgehogs. I also added lemon juice for some extra zing.
2) I shaped them like chocolate hedgehogs, not like in the video. They were almost spherical With a sharp point.
3) bc of this, I baked them at a lower temperature for longer, around 300degrees for 15-18min.

I added a bit of extra honey, shortening, extra flour, milk to make the dough. The original dough was so crumbly it wouldn't ball up hence the extras. I had to experiment to get it to work but they turned out great.

Very Happy with the results of this cookie. used margarine quarters rather than shortening. concerned that 1tbsp of real vanilla would be too strong so only used 1tsp. Good flavored cookie. Dough worked very well into balls and then teardrop shape. Didnt flatten the nose. one small  tbsp is more than enough dough for each cookie - they grow when cooked. used olive oil to thin chocolate as suggested by other reviews. Used roasted almonds rather than pecans.  so cute!

I like this cookie, it was cute and different. However, mine turned out a bit dry, which could have been my fault as I didn't want to buy the 3 pack-butter crisco, I don't use it that often, so  I added 3 T butter with regular crisco hoping for the same outcome.

This cookie is very tasty and cute! For the reviews that may have stated that the cookie dough was too crumbly or tasteless, do be aware that this calls for 1 Tablespoon of vanilla. It sounds like a lot, but I do want to point this out since I normally see 1 tsp of vanilla - not 1 Tbsp. You may be tempted to add more wetness to the dough because it is a little crumbly....don't. After I mixed with a fork, I kneaded the dough a little just to get all the crumbs to stick to the main dough ball. I whisked the wet ingredients and mixed the dry and wet together until just combined, withOUT an electric mixer (you can easily overmix with an electric mixer). I chilled the dough in the fridge for about 2hrs, used a Tbsp to scoop out the balls, 12 at a time (since my sheet pan will fit only 12 at a time), and put those balls in the freezer for just a few minutes to chill it again before I shaped them. One thing I think was missing from the recipe, is how thick the teardrop-shaped cookie should be. I didn't want it to be too thick otherwise it would be uncooked in the middle. What I found to work for me was to shape it to be 1/2" thick - all around - and to make sure the nose tip was a nice point. 11 minutes cooking time was about right. It just has to get slightly brown around the bottom edge, and it will firm up nicely. I did temper 2 cups of choco chips with about 1Tbsp of olive oil to make it thinner and easier to dip. (1.5 cups would have been enough). A tip to make the eyes and nos

these cookies are adorable!!! & extremely delicious! my only recommendation is to watch the size of your cookies, I tended to go a little over the 1TBSP per cookie,  & they were almost too big. i also used more pecans & more chocolate than it called for. i will definitely make these again - they're lots of fun!

These are very cute and taste great.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but the dough was too dry.  I doctored it, and it turned out ok looking.  Taste good though!
