This pie is awesome and very easy to make. I didn't want to make a regular crust so I made a graham cracker crust and cooked the filling on the stove for about 10 minutes to set the egg. I also made a 10 inch crust so I added about a 1/2 cup more pineapple (the rest of the can) and a handful more coconut. YUM!

I've made this pie several times and it always turns out perfectly. I make it for my 79 year old father and it's his favorite. He says it reminds him of the pie his mother made. I always make two one for my family and one just for him.

THis pie was so delicious!  I only had to bake it maybe 40 minutes, it was just beginning to get light golden brown on top.  I used a pie crust made from scratch, and served it warm after dinner.  You can't beat this one!!

Recipe must be doubled!!  A little too sweet for us.  We wanted pineapple flavor but it was soooo sugary!  Easy enough, though.

Easy, inexpensive and quick.  I used a whole can of crushed pineapple.  Instead of a deep dish crust, I used a graham cracker crust.  If you use a deep dish crust, you will want to double the recipe, because this recipe doesn't make enough for a deep dish crust.  Perfect for a standard crust though!  Will definetly make again!

I have only one problem with this pie.... I cannot give it more than 5 stars.    As I am typing I am waiting for my 4,5,6,&7th pineapple pies to come out of the oven.  This is within a week.  I had people stop me in church to ask if I was making anymore of these for our parish fish fry this week.
I did decrease the amount of coconut to 1/4 cup and added just a little more pineapple.

I liked the taste of the pie, but my family did not, I think the last pineapple pie they had was a cream pie so they were comparing it to that type. The only thing that bothered me was that it comes no where near filling up a deep dish pie crust, so no one touched it at Thanksgiving since it looked funny having so much crust and not enough filling. The most aggravating part is that I never make pie and I made a homemade crust and even made leaf cut outs around the edge and then it didnt fill up the pan, other than that the taste was good, but I think I would rather have pineapple cream pie instead.

Very very good, the pineapple and coconut are wonderful together. I used the full amt of sugar even though part of me wanted to reduce it and while it was a sweet dessert, I didn't think it was too much. I may try cutting back on sugar in the future for nutrition but the consistancy of the pie was perfect, and I don't want to mess that up. One tip, the strings of coconut and pineapple matter in the semi-firm matrix made this difficult to cut into clean pieces: it makes absolutely no difference to the taste/texture but if you're looking for a picture-perfect dessert for company pieces of this one do look more "rustic". A great pie to throw together from your pantry: thanks for sharing :)

Delicious just as written. Bakes up nicely. I sprinkled it with additional coconut at the minimum baking time and let it toast as the pie finished.

This is a great recipe, but my goodness it certainly was not enough filling for my deep dish pie plate. I had to double the recipe, and was still below the top line of the pie plate. I used a homemade crust and my company raved about this dessert.

No changes, it is Still in the oven. There was not near enough fillng for a 9 inch deep dish pie pan. It would have taken at least a double recipe for a deep dish pan.

I had some fresh pineapple and fresh coconut I needed to use up so I came on Allrecipes looking a good recipe . Well it didn`t fail me. This recipe is delicious and easy . Only change I made was add a about a tsp of vanilla and made small individual pies . Before this I didn`t even know pineapple pie existed .I need to find a way to make it sugar free so I can eat more of it .

Pretty good pie and easy.  Used fresh pineapple, chopped, & a  regular sized frozen pie shell, which worked fine. Little too sweet because I used sweetened coconut flakes, will use less sugar next time & add coconut flakes on top to toast.  Will use this recipe to use up fresh pineapple after making Chef John's pineapple-upside-down cake.

Very good pie! I don't even love pineapple but this was so good! Had leftovers for breakfast! This mixture didn't come up to the top of the deep-dish pie. So we increased the mix by 50% and if was perfect. Used homemade pie crust.

Delicious and adaptable recipe. I adjusted a few things, because of my diet. I used coconut sugar (which is brown and low glycemic) and coconut flour. I also increased the pineapple to 1.5 cups, and replaced the butter with a vegan buttery spread (it was all I had). I used a frozen gluten free pie crust as well. One hour later, pie! Because of the coconut sugar, it was a warm caramel brown color, with the pineapple chunks peeking through. Lovely pineapple coconut flavor. Definitely making this again.

I'm just learning to cook but I loved this recipe.  I had everything in the pantry so I got busy.  I followed the suggestion of some to use a graham cracker crust.  I increased the coconut by 1/4 cup, used the entire can of pineapples and cooked it on the stove for 10 minutes first, as suggested.
