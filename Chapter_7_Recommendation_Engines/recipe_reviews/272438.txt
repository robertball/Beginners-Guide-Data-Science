We really liked this.  It took on great flavor with the sauce.  I almost doubled the soy sauce because I used 7 pieces of chicken.

I donâ€™t own an Instant Pot but I needed a good recipe one night for dinner. I had all of the ingredients for this one. I cooked chicken thighs on the stove in a deep pan after marinading them with the sauce. This was a delicious recipe.

This was so delicious. Came out perfectly, so tender and the Teriyaki sauce is so good. So much better than bottled.
Move over Panda Express....
