This turned out really well. The cranberry jam kept the duck moist and had really good flavor. I mixed the zest from the oranges with the liquor as I used cognac instead of Grand Mariner as I forgot to buy it! I will definitely make this again.

A nice flavor and not very complicated. 

I made a few "additions" to the recipe.
1) Seasoning the cavity, I doubled the Chinese 5 Spice. It really needs some additional spice, and it is still there when you later boil the carcass for broth! I also added about 3 oz of dried Cranberries to the mix of Orange and Onion.
2) I used dried Cranberries ... whole cranberries are seasonal so you have to make due ... 6 oz plus 1 cup of water to re-hydrate and cook ... time to cook is increased to about 15 minutes for the glaze. I assumed the orange zest goes in the glaze ... it is not listed. I added a tablespoon of 5 spice to the glaze. 
3) I slit the skin (but not the meat) every inch or so to help with the glaze flavor getting into the meat. I also held back about 1/2 cup of the glaze mixture for garnish at the table. It is surprisingly  tasty as a side or with the meat.
4) I put about 2 cups of chicken broth in the bottom of the roasting pan to help humidify the oven and prevent the duck drippings from being a blackened char.

Although I prefer a stuffed bird (because I LOVE stuffing) this was a nice change of pace with all the wonderful flavors of duck and fruit coming together.
