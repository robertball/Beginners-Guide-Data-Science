very tender and YUMMY...I made some changes to make it EVEN EASIER!   1) I browned the thighs, then wrapped with bacon and placed in crock pot. 2) Then I (because I'm not a fan of that dressing) put BBQ sauce over the thighs   3) I cooked on high for 3 hours (was short on time)   TASTED GREAT!!! Thanks for the recipe! :)

This is a very good and easy recipe.  Rather than bottled Russian Dressing, I used a home made version from this website.  I wish the recipe specified whether to use boneless/skinless chicken thighs or not.  I used bone in skinless tighs; worried about bacon fat + chicken fat being too rich but think it would be better with skin on thighs.

Very good recipe for chicken. Hubby took one bite and said  "Yum". High praise from him! ;) I had made bacon for breakfast so I used the bacon grease to brown the chicken in. I did use bone in skin on thighs. Instead of wrapping the chicken I just placed bacon on top of the thighs. Also used homemade Russian dressing. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do with the green onions so I decided  to just top the chicken with them as garnish. Unfortunately it was a crazy night and I completely forgot to do it!! Ah well next time. Served with rice. I will definitely be making this again.*****Made this again and remembered the green onions. They really add and extra kick. I just sprinkled them on the finished chicken.

This was easy to prepare and was very very good. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. We couldn't find Russian dressing at the local grocery store (seriously, it was ridiculous!) so I had to make it from scratch. Sadly, the dressing separated during cooking and didn't look too appetizing in the crock but it still tasted amazing. Next time (and there will certainly be a next time, we loved this) I'll definitely make sure to use bottled dressing as that should help remedy the separation problem and make this even better. Also, I did microwave the bacon for a short time before wrapping the chicken. I'm not sure it was necessary but it turned out very nicely.

This is an easy and tasty recipe. I browned 2 additional strips of bacon and crumbled it into the salad dressing and then pour that over the chicken.  I served it over long grain rice and it was a hit with the entire family.

I really enjoyed the flavor. However the bacon in the crockpot remained soggy, and half the sauce was bacon grease. So I put the oven on 400 and baked for 20 min to make the bacon edible. The sauce although tastes, was too greasy, and not enough to pour over rice. Next time I will halfway cook the bacon getting rid of half the grease, and I wouldn't wrap it...double Russian dressing, and skip the crock pot all together. I would layer chicken on bottom garlic, ginger, green onions, dressing and bacon laid on top. Cover and bake at 400 for 30 min and uncovered for 20 with bacon on top to crisp.

This was ok. I think the bacon needs to be cooked a little first. 
I can't have tomatoes so I used a balsamic garlic one. I also used breast as I don't like bones. 
I don't know how that picture has such a brown look as if it was baked or grilled. Ours certainly did not look like that.
My teenage son really liked it but I probably will not make this one much.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but thought that I would share an idea I have for the recipe.  To get a sweet and sour taste, this would probably taste great on saurkraut.

Killer recipe.  Par-fry the bacon, pull the skin off the chicken and roll with it.  Three hours on high in the slow cooker, slid off the bone awesome!

This was AMAZING!  I browned the chicken and quickly pan fried the bacon.   Other than that no changes.  It fell apart when you put a fork to it.  I cooked the green onions right in the sauce and the flavor was great.  I could ramble on all day about it....looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

Meh. I was just looking for a recipe to use up some extra chicken thighs I had so I thought I try this. The chicken was tender and moist. It fell off the bone.  I just don't think the flavor popped. Maybe if I added more garlic cloves or ginger or added something else complimentary.  It wasn't bad, just not great.

My family of picky eaters loves this dish. The only suggestion is please cook your bacon a bit first so it crisps up nicely when the dish is done instead of being limp and fatty. The other thing I do different is use 8 thighs instead because there are more of us, and since we love the sauce it makes, I use a whole 16 ounce bottle of Wish Bone Russian dressing and of course increase the garlic and ginger to go along with that.  The sauce is WONDERFUL over rice, so you are going to want extra.

I liked this recipe a lot. It was easy to put together if you had all the ingredients. I had to make my own Russian dressing, but other than it tasted great. I was short on time so I prepared egg noodles instead of rice, but I'm 100% sure a white basmati or jasmine rice would go great with this recipe! Thanks...instant classic.

I found this OK the first time around as the bacon was unappetizing and the sauce very fatty.  Better the second time I made it whne I partially cooked the bacon, then seriously browned the seasoned skin-on bone-in thighs in the bacon grease on high heat until the skin was crisp, then followed the rest of the recipe.  Probably not the healthiest dish but the bacon was appetizing and sauce less greasy.

This was very good!  Everyone enjoyed it.  I liked it better a day later.  Very tasty, very easy.  I might use skinless/boneless thighs and skip the frying step next time.

This was a hit around the supper table. I took a fellow cookers advice on the substitute of BBQ sauce instead of the Russian dressing. I served it over Quinoa instead of rice. Even my fussy eater, ate it up and was disappointed that there wasn't seconds. Thanks for the recipe.

great recipe, but the bacon should be half-fried first. I will cook 4 hours next time instead of 5 to 6. I also skinned the thighs first.

Kids really liked this.  I didn't have Russian dressing so I found a recipe on the the site that I made instead.  Seemed to do the trick.  Good flavor but not my favorite chicken recipe.

It was extremely good! When taken out of the slow cooker, the bacon and the chicken skin had melted right into the meat. And that meat was falling right off the bone. It was just perfect with rice!

Made this last night using boneless skinless chicken breasts in lieu of chicken thighs.  I also made my own dressing seeing as I had no Russian dressing, but everything I needed to make my own.  I am not really familiar with Russian dressing, but Google told me there is a creamy/Thousand Island type and a darker red/more glazy type sold in stores.  I'm assuming the glazy type is the kind you should use here.  That being said, I made the creamy type.  *eyeroll*  The fat from the bacon separated and didn't make a pretty sauce for the rice.  I ended up panicking over the softness of the bacon and tossed them in the oven at 400 until the bacon crisped and everything got nice and caramelized and not clumpy, whisked the leftover crockpot sauce and drizzled it over the rice and called it a day.  It tasted a little bland, but the chicken was deliciously tender and just falling apart!  I will definitely use this cooking method with different spices/sauces, but will probably not ever make this recipe again as is.

Very easy & good tasting. I heeded other reviewers' warnings about the grease level & partially cooked the bacon in the microwave before wrapping it over the chicken.  I made the "Russian Salad Dressing" recipe from this site and used chopped white onion since I had no green onions. I used bone-in, skin on thighs which I quickly browned in hot oil, then drained on paper towels before placing in the crock pot. I cooked it for 5 hours. It was tender juicy and did not fall apart. The dressing did not separate as one reviewer experienced. They may have used a different recipe for the Russian dressing that included sour cream, causing it to separate.  Also, the folks whose chicken was done early may have over-browned it before putting it in the crock-pot. Overall, this is a great recipe.  I will be making it again.

I'm not sold on this recipe, but it's certainly not bad.  I liked the flavor of the dressing/chicken/bacon together.  I baked in oven at 400 per a reviewer.  The bacon still did not crisp the way I like, however.  I ended up putting it under the broiler for about ten minutes, which crisped the bacon some.  Eventually, I just took the bacon off and nuked it.  I won't try it in the crockpot because I've done things like this before and soggy bacon is what I'll get.  To sum up:  flavor is good enough to make again, I'll fry bacon to almost crisp, then add to top of chicken in the oven under broiler the last few minutes.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and served it over white rice, and the family gave it thumbs up!  My husband and son both wanted me to make it again soon, so we have had it twice so far.  I recommend adding onions (white, yellow, or sweet) to the slow cooker.  The only drawback to the meal was how greasy the sauce was, I tried to skim some of it off and it was still visibly very greasy.

In general followed the recipe other than cooking the bacon a little before wrapping it on the chicken.  I also cooked on HIGH for 3 hours instead of LOW for 6 due to some time constraints.  The result was good.  Family enjoyed it!

Really great dish, it smelled delicious! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and they turned out great. I cooked the bacon a bit (not fully) beforehand which was a good choice. I served this over basmati rice.

I used precooked bacon, which reduced the fat problem that others have mentioned. Chicken thighs come out luscious in a slow cooker, and this was no exception. My wife liked this, but I thought the Russian dressing sauce had an odd flavor.

I have to admit I wasn't sure I'd really like this dish, but I did.  The flavor is lovely, and the chicken just melts off the bone, with the bacon adding a nice pop of flavor.  Really nice dish over rice or served with a  potato side dish.

We really enjoyed the flavor and ease of this recipe.  My husband especially liked it.  Unfortunately, I agree with another reviewer who said the "sauce" was too greasy.  I even half cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken to reduce the fat.  Next time I will try to cook the bacon in the pan, then use the bacon grease to brown the chicken, then drain the fat before adding the remaining ingredients, and hope that will help.

Very tasty and easy. I microwaved the bacon for a few minutes, and used bone-in thighs and ground ginger.

Everyone loved to moist chicken and the sauce, Getting the bacon to  crisp was a problem but the broiler worked with the chicken on a jelly roll pan lined with non stick foil.  I addeed more than 2 green onions and about one more clove of garlic. The sauce will be great on other meats as well.  Love it and will make it again and again.

This was excellent and so easy - I did not brown the chicken I used frozen boneless skinless thighs, wrapped with bacon - and I couldn't find Russian dressing so I used Ken's Sun dried Tomato Vinaigrette (much like Russian dressing) and it was delicious.  My husband does not like fresh ginger but said it was some of the best chicken he'd ever had and asked for to become a regular.   I mixed the sauce in a bowl and poured it over the bacon wrapped thighs.

First time: Used Kraft Catalina dressing--which had a mild flavor, when I hoped to experience a shade more zing. Next time, I'll make a batch of the AR website version of Russian dressing.  I also slightly over browned the chicken; tough chewy surface--but tender good meat inside, so wasn't a disaster.  Will update this review by following per recipe instructions.

The recipe wasn't specific as to bone in or boneless/skinless, I used bone in. The only thing is I had to finish them under the broiler so they didn't look so pale and add some crispness to the bacon. Other than that we will be keeping this recipe.

I had to make the  dressing myself but next time I will add a little more horseraddish to the sauce. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs.
It was great taste.

Served it to the family they all liked it. I didn't know what flavor to expect but it was a good one. A little tangy and creamy with a touch of smoke.

It was pretty good, but not spectacular.
I made it with browned chicken breasts, par cooked the bacon and followed the directions the rest of the way.  I reserved the bacon fat before adding to the crockpot and found it to be WAY too greasy for my taste.  Even though I drained the chicken before putting it on the plate, the puddle of sauce was floating on grease. While the flavors were amazing, even the rice I served it with wasn't enough to soak up the grease.

I did not care for this recipe. The flavor wasn't strong and I think 5 hours was too long. The chicken was mushy.

This dish was well liked by my 4 sons and husband. I did make my own Russian dressing as suggested by someone else. I did not expect the bacon to come out crispy because it is covered in sauce and is not meant to be crispy. I made this the night before serving and baked it in the oven at 350 for an hour. Doubled the recipe and there were no left overs so that makes it a keeper recipe in our family

The chicken was cooked through and the bacon was a nice touch, but all in all the recipe was bland. I used a bottle of Russian dressing. I don't know if that made a difference.
