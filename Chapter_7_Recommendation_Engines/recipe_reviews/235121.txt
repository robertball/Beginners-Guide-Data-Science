This was a simple recipe with a big flavor. I used cherry tomatoes as they are sweeter and I like white corn tortillas. Cost was about $16 and it made enough for two people for lunch and supper.

These tacos were really tasty.  I did use flour tortillas (personal preference), using avocado oil for the frying (it has a high heat capability). I did use a little sour cream on the base except for the one vegan eater here tonight.  I even added a little chicken for two of the eaters.  I made up the salsa mix an hour before serving, using red onion (since the recipe didn't state a preference).  It was very tasty.  I would make this again in a heartbeat!  Thanks, WHIRLEDPEAS!

Great recipe that you can platform to diff varieties. Example: Instead of getting tomatoes, garlic, and onion, you can mix your fav salsa with the avocado & cilantro & then drizzle with the lime  juice. Also, you can crisp the tortillas in the oven (which then makes it a tostada) & to the black beans, add some white shredded cheese such as Monterrey Jack cheese.  It can be a bit messy if you are not use to tostadas but practice makes perfect. :)

I will definitely add this to my list of fav new recipes. The cilantro slaw was so fresh tasting!  Made avocado cream using plain nonfat Greek yogurt. Great recipe!

Good recipe but the onions are way too strong, they take over the dish. I recommend skipping the onions or use a tiny amount. And I perfer flour tortillas instead of corn.  Other then that its a good recipe.

allrecipes has great recipes and this one Cali Tacos is one great recipe! I made these a week or so ago and they were a huge hit for me and my husband. This is so easy to do, takes no time, and is delicious! I'll be making these a lot for sure. We highly recommend these tacos.

I made this with just a quarter of a sweet Vidalia Onion, minced, I omitted the rice and used up one large left over chicken breast, chopped (about a cup) everything else was the same as the recipe. I used corn tortillas, it was delish!

This is my new favorite food!!  So yummy and it feels healthy to eat it. Recommendation:  put a dash of salt on the tortillas when you cook them.  The picture does not really show, but they get a little crisp, which "a little crisp" is perfect in our opinion.

This is the PERFECT way to use up leftover rice!  Delicious!  Another perfect addition to this would be some slice black olives, that's what I'll add next time :)

I loved these. They were light, fresh, tasty, and easy to make. I skipped frying the tortillas and just toasted mine. I also used a Spanish rice mix instead of white rice which gave the tacos more flavor.
