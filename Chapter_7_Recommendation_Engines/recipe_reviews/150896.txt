This is phenomenal!  I served this to the girls in my book club and everyone who tried it asked for the recipe.  I couldn't find orgeat syrup (and almond-flavored syrup) in the stores and didn't have time to order online, so I used almond-flavored Torani syrup instead.  I will make these again and again!

I alterted this for a serving of 20 and the first batch did not turn out. I was told to use 5 cups of grenadine. That was WAY too much. It tasted like cough syrup. Next batch I tried 2 oz and it was plenty. After the adjustment they were delicious!!!
