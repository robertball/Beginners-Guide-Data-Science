This was good, but I made the following modifications: (1) I halved the streusel topping (and there was still some left over), (2) I used 3/4 cup milk because I thought the batter looked too dry - depends on how you like your coffee cake I suppose, (3) I used 1 1/2 cups blueberries and folded them into the batter before spreading into baking dish, (4) I spread half the batter in the dish and then sprinkled some streusel topping in the middle, then put the remaining batter on top and covered in streusel, (5) I used a 9x13 glass baking dish, baked it at 325 for about 25 mins (until golden brown)

I was comparing blueberry cake recipes and noticed that this recipe is exactly the same as a blueberry muffin recipe I received in a baking class I took at a culinary school. There were only 2 differences. One, this recipe is half the recipe we made. The second is that all the ingredients were cut in half except the flour. The class recipe called for 3 cups of flour. Here it calls for 2 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups. That is probably the reason people are saying it's dry--too much flour.

I followed others' suggestions and used 3/4 c. buttermilk instead of 1/2 c. milk and increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups. I also sprinkled some of the streusel over the blueberry layer and made it in a springform pan. It was delicious! I took it to a garden club event. Everyone gave it rave reviews, and a customer offered to buy half of it from me.

I followed the recipe as it was written and this coffee cake turned out only average. I don't think you should rate a recipe 5 stars if you had to make changes to get it there. That's just saying the original recipe wasn't worth 5 stars in the first place, and all those reviews about changing this or changing that were completely confusing. I think I would rather find a blueberry muffin or cake recipe that is worth 5 stars on its own.

This cake was a big hit with my picky husband and 9 year old son!!  I've also brought it to work and to church, and people always ask for the recipe. I followed previous suggestions: increased milk to 3/4 cup, used a 9" springform pan, and put half of the topping on top of the fruit layer. Instead of fresh berries, I used a 15 oz. can of Oregon blueberries (drained) which works really well.  Alternately, a can of drained peaches tossed with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and some sugar also tastes great.  I find that the cake tastes best when warm, so zapping it in the microwave the next day for a few seconds does the trick :-)

I read all the wonderful reviews about this recipe and tried it this morning to take to my son's little league game to share with the moms.  OH MY GOSH!  WONDERFUL!  I used canola oil in place of the butter in the recipe batter and it turned out wonderful and moist!  I also used 3/4 cup of milk like others had said, and put some streusel in the middle with the berries too.  My friends devoured it!  Thanks so much!

I made this using 1 cup of milk and I pressed the brown sugar mixture into the bottom of a tube pan and it made a nice topping when I flipped the pan over!  The cake was moist and delicious!  I will make this again!

AMAZING!!!!!!  Firstly I screwed up b/c I baked it in a 9 by 13 pan and misjudged the measurements - I thought 1.5 times the recipe woudl be sufficient but it wasn't - next time i'll try double the recipe.  Also I used canned peaches sliced thinnly instead of blueberries :) I did put half the streudel in the middle - so then there wasn't enough on top - so the top layer came out swirled with the cake batter.  My friend had some and said it is his FAVORITE out of everything I have ever baked including cheesecakes, cookies, cakes, pies!!!!!!! (I bake a lot - have made maybe 50 different things from this website :)  But keep in mind that's b/c he doesn't like overly sweet desserts, chocolate, and adores cinnamon and peaches :)  Also I made it low fat and low cholestrol by using "I can't believe it's not butter in place of butter, fat free milk and eggbeaters :) (b/c all my friends are complaining i'm making them fat with all my baking) and it turned out so well...i think it just gives it a lighter cake - not as dense and rich :)  A definitely must try if you love fruit desserts! :)

AMAZING!!!!!!!

I made some of the changes that other reviewers suggested....2 cups of blueberries (instead of 1 cup) and 3/4 cups of milk (instead of 1/2 cup). Dredge your blueberries in flour and fold into batter before adding to pan. 

I also drizzle a lemon glaze (mix together 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon water) on top of cake after it has cooled. I have made this twice in the last week and it turned out perfect both times. This is good for a breakfast or dessert cake.

As I was mixing the batter, my husband and son stole my fresh blueberries.  I didn't have the heart to take it back from them since fresh are better for you than cooked (and it's winter out), so I improvised and chopped up 2 granny smith apples and added a bit of cinnamon to the batter.  VERY good cake, even without the crumble on top!
UPDATE July4,2011 - I had made this cake several times before now, but had forgotten whether I followed the original directions the previous times, or whether I had increased the milk to 3/4 cup as suggested by most reviewers.  I decided to wing it and increase the milk.  Well, that made it clear to me that the previous times I followed the original directions, which provided a more dense and rich cake, which is what a crumb/coffee cake should be like (in my opinion).  While the lighter/fluffier texture is still delicious, it is more like a cake.  Delicious either way, but when making the crumb, I will make sure to use the 1/2 cup milk, and when omitting it, I will make sure to increase the milk for a lighter and more cakey consistency.

Boyfriend brought home 2 lbs of Concord grapes to juice yesterday, and we decided to make something out of the leftover juiceless grape mash. We baked them into this coffee cake (in place of the blueberries) and it was AMAZING! We used 2T of butter in the streusel topping (next time we'll use more, but still not 1/2 cup), used probably 2 cups of grape pulp in the middle, and used almond milk in the batter (that's all we had), and it turned out perfectly.

I loved this recipe!! It is very moist and delicious. I did make one change to it though. I doubled the batter ingredients to make a truly tall beautiful cake! I also did something else... After putting 1/2 the batter in the bundt pan, I sprinkled 1/2 the streusel topping over the blueberries.(there seemed to be too much to just put it all on top) after it was done it had this delicious streusel throughout the middle of the cake. Truly a magnificent cake!!!

This is a wonderful coffee cake. I used the 3/4 milk in the batter & 1 1/2 c berries in the middle. I baked it in an 8x11? small pyrex pan for 50 min. I made all the topping as directed & layered batter, blueberries, topping, batter (added a splash more of milk to thin a bit) and the rest of the topping. It is good when warm, but amazing after it sits a few hours! The cake gets moister & the topping softens. I would recommend baking it the night before if you want it for breakfast the next day. This is a keeper.

Seriously, this is one of the best things I have ever baked (and I bake A LOT!).  I made it in a pretty bundt pan and used 3/4 c. of milk.  I mixed the blueberries into the batter right before putting it into the pan.  I thought it was a perfect amount of streusel in the recipe - enough for a top layer and a middle layer.  The streusel seems to have a caramel taste to it - it's just awesome!  I can't wait to make this again to share with other people - me, my husband and kids ate this whole one ourselves!

I made this for the first time today and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I agree with the one reviewer who suggested not using more milk because doing so would make this too "cake-like".
Coffee cake is supposed to be dense in texture,and this is after all, a coffee cake.

My entire family loved this coffee cake (even my pickiest eater)!  I didn't have a bundt pan handy, so I used an 11"x7" glass dish.  Doing it that way allowed for the streusel to be on top of the cake.  This is a definite keeper for my family!  I also used frozen rather than fresh blueberries.

I love blueberry recipes and I made this last year for a 4th of July party we go to every year. The host remembered my cake all year long. They asked me to make this again.  I made it in a bundt pan and decorated it with strawberries & blueberries and little flowers of whipped cream. It was a huge hit.

Excellent Coffee Cake!   I just made it for my Mah Jong group this morning and everyone left with a piece to take home! 
I did as recommended by others - 1 1/2 C. flour in cake, 3/4 C. milk, 2 C. fresh blueberries.  I baked it in a 9" springform pan for 55 minutes - might have needed 60 as the very centre was a tiny bit mushy.   But the flavor was wonderful and as the blueberries are just great right now here in WI (I think they come from out east!) - they held up very well in the cake and the larger ones stayed whole.   
A few people mentioned difficulties with the strudel topping.  There is a lot of butter in it.  What I did was - did some of the crumbling last night, and it started to clump together, so I put it back in the fridge and left it overnight.   The butter got nice and hard again, and I used a pastry cutter and that broke up the clumps very nicely and the mix was crumbly.   I will make this again.

This was delicious!!!   Used a bit more milk- maybe about 3/4 c. total.   
Added chopped pecans to the streusel topping, and made a powdered sugar/ orange juice glaze to pour on top of the coffee cake after it came out of oven and cooled a bit.
Will definitely make this again!

I used 1 1/2 cups flour and 3/4 cup of milk and I halved the streusel topping as I read in the reviews. It was Very very good - next time I will put in more blueberries - also I made it in a casserole dish and baked it at 350.

I normally agree with the philosophy that if you have to makes changes to the recipe it shouldn't get 5 stars, but with some slight modifications this recipe turns out really well.  I followed the advice of others and decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups but instead of increasing the milk I simply added 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I also used wheat flour instead of all purpose and it turned out beautifully.  Everyone at work loved it.

WOW!!! A very moist and tasty cake, great for breakfast, snack, or dessert. I had never baked a coffee cake before, and this one came out perfect on thr first try. On the advice of other raters, I decreased the flour to 1 and 1/2 cups, and increased the milk to 3/4 cups, as well as making only half the crumble topping. Make sure to check that it's fully cooked in the center, as it took me slightly longer than 60 minutes to get the middle well-cooked. I used a springform pan and have received rave reviews... the more blueberries the better! I have since made it using a mixture of raspberries and blueberris and it is just divine.

YUMMY!  This recipe has quickly become a family favorite.  After reading other reviews, I increased the milk to 3/4 cup.  I've tried baking this in both a bundt pan and a spring pan, and both turned out great.  Thanks Debbie!

This cake was delicious. I used almond milk for the milk and used an entire pint of blueberries. My cake wasn't dry at all - no need to substitute oil, increase the milk, add eggs, etc. I find that oftentimes, when people have dry cakes, it's because they're using packed flour and not leveling off their ingredients. I always loosen up the flour before measuring to avoid getting too much in my recipes. Baking is a science, and you have to be precise with your measuring, so always level off. I will suggest that you put half of the streusel in the middle of the bake. This recipe makes A LOT of streusel, and I think that would be too much to handle on the bottom of a cake. Divided this way, this seems to come out better. If you're having trouble with the cake sticking, make sure you're using a BAKING spray with flour already in it and spray it liberally. I also folded the blueberries into my batter before putting it into the bundt pan. Next time, I might put some berry-less batter into the bundt pan before I fold the blueberries into the mixture to avoid the "bruised" appearance on the top of the cake. Toss your blueberries in some of the flour to avoid sinkage. Very good recipe; it's a keeper for sure! Thank you!

Yum! I followed suggestions and reduced the flour to 1 and a half cups and increased the milk to 3/4 cup. I baked the cake in a spring form pan and it was so delicious. The topping is caramel tasting and tastes great with half in the middle and half on top. We did add about a teaspoon of orange zest to the batter, which gave it a delicious taste and smell! I will definitely save this recipe and enjoy it again.

Great recipe Debbie! My daughter made this for our after dance recital party on Sunday. She used sour cream in lieu of milk and made it in a tube pan. My blueberry lovin' friend said that it was the BEST blueberry dessert he'd ever eaten!

This is a great coffee cake recipe.  For those of you that may not know, a coffee cake is suppose to be dense and a bit dry.  This turned out perfect for me. Nice texture and flavor.  I've been baking for years but I always follow a new recipe the first time and then if it comes out nicely, I'll tweak it to make it my own.  The only change I had to make was to use blackberries instead of blueberries because that's what I had on hand.  If you are on the fence about this one, try it.  Don't worry about the negative reviews or the modifications.  If you are looking for a *coffee cake* this is it!  I didn't get a chance to take a pic because my family got into it right away and had it while it was warm.  But I do plan to make it again and will try to post a pic.

I prepared the recipe exactly as written, with mixed results. First of all, there was so much streusel topping that the top of the cake was completely sealed into the pan. I used a butter knife to chisel it out. Also, the blueberries stuck to the side of the baking pan as well. I decided to remove the cake piece by piece. I brought the slices to our church coffee gathering this morning, where it received rave reviews. I recommend greasing your bundt pan with something more effective than spray, adding 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2, and halving the topping. It is a good tasting recipe, once you get it out of the pan!

This was EXCELLENT!! Followed the recipe exactly. I was a little concerned when the batter was more like dough than batter, but pressed on and it came out perfect. A keeper, thanks for sharing!

Very good, not fantastic. Didn't come out of the pan very well (out in pieces, which may be my fault), which is why I gave it only 4 stars, not 5. Delicious, however. I used two cups of fresh blueberries and glad I halved the brown sugar/flour mix - it was plenty.

Okay, I've made this coffee cake 3 times, and I think I have it just right now.  The streusel (as written in the recipe) seems to actually be the right amount, it's just that it works so much better to use half that streusel to cover the blueberry layer--that really brings out the flavor in your berries.  Also, I think increasing the milk in the batter makes it too cake-y.  Coffee cake shouldn't be moist.   Great recipe.

I made this for an Easter breakfast, and topped with an orange-lemon icing - received many compliments.  Remember to spray well - and rub it around all over (with your hand - not a paper towel, which will absorb the oil).

It's only 4 stars because I felt the need to make adjustments to the recipe.  I read most of the reviews and decided from those suggestions to: A) Use 1 1/2 cups of flour B) Use 3/4 cup of milk C) Halve the topping and use 1/3 cup flour and 1/3 a cup oats D) Bake in a 9" springform pan.  
After making these changes, which I don't normally do but the reviews were very convincing, it was GREAT!  Texture was super, quantity was good, taste was excellent!  A perfect coffee cake!  One note is that I was surprised it still had to bake for the full hour in the springform pan... worth the wait!

This recipe is definitely worth making!!! Granted there are changes, but most recipes on this website have some changes made to them.  
When I made these I added 3/4 cup of milk, 2 eggs,and 2 cups of frozen  blueberries(picked from the garden last year), which I thawed and added a touch of flour to. I also cut the topping in half, which was plenty.  I cooked this in a 9" springform pan, and it was gone within 24 hours! My husband and I were fighting over it!  Can't wait to make again!

I followed the sage advice of the previous bakers and increased the milk to 3/4 cup, used two eggs and put it all in a 9" springform pan.  I also halved the crumb mixture and added a little more flour (maybe around 1/4 cup) which seemed to make it nice and crumbly.  The half recipe was the perfect amount of topping for the top of the springform.  Nice cake (and pretty, too!)

I just made this this morning and it was DELICIOUS!  I did make one major change though.  I thought the streusel topping should be on the top of the cake, so I baked the cake as directed, minus the streusel.  I microwaved the streusel mixture and drizzled it on the top of the cake after removing the it from the bundt pan.  It was fabulous!  There was definately more than enough topping though, so I think next time I would double the cake batter mixture and then do the same thing.  My cake wasn't very high in the pan.  Flavor was great and I got many compliments at the office.

I made this per the directions but the batter was so thick I had to add an additional 1/4 cup of milk and even then it was thick. It is a bit heavier than I thought it would be with all the sugar. Way to much topping. If I make it again I"ll cut that in half and only use 3/4 cups of sugar in the recipe itself. Its a bit sweet for me.

I make this in a regular 9x13 pan and put half of the topping in the middle right after the blueberries. This is so so good. Works well with whole wheat flour, too.

This was really good. As other reviewers suggested I almost doubled the milk, used 2 cups blueberries, and I baked it in a 9x9 pan for about 50 minutes. It came out perfect. I reheated some in the microwave the next day and it was actually more moist than the first day. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a 5-star recipe only with the modifications recommended by the other reviewers. Even with increasing the milk to 3/4 cup, it's still hard to spread the second half of the batter over the blueberries. And it doesn't make sense to put a streusel topping (and goodness - not this much!) on something you bake in a Bundt pan, because you invert it before serving, and the topping would end up all over the plate.

So if you bake it in a springform pan, increase the milk to at least 3/4 cup, and put half of the streusel in the middle with the blueberries, it's a good coffee cake. I also increased the cinnamon in the topping to about 1 T. and  increased the vanilla to 1T.

Excellent recipe!  I have tried the recipe with fresh blueberries and another time with sliced peaches; both times it turned out great.  i usually divide the streusel recipe in half and add some oats in.

This is a good recipe. I read many reviews to get ideas how to make it better which is why I luv this site. I used 2 cups of flour, 3/4 cup milk, 2 eggs and 2 cups of blueberries. I poured 1/2 the batter in a 9" springform added 1/2 the topping and 1/2 cup blueberries. Poured the rest of the batter and topped with streusel. I folded 1 1/2 cups of blueberries in the batter as well. Baked for about 50-55 min. at 350. It looked very pretty when sliced. Thanks to all the input from others. Its a keeper.

This cake was excellent!  This was my first try using a bundt pan and I was a little nervous, but it turned out moist and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and I feel that it was much more moist than other coffee cakes I've made.  I'm not sure about the streusel topping, though.  Mine got very sticky and not crumbly at all.  But I will definitely make this again!

I followed some of the other reviews and decided to double the recipe for a 9x13 pan.  I also added some extra milk (about 1/2 cup more).  I did not double the struesel and still had some leftover.  I used frozen blueberries and sprinkled stuesel over them and then some on the top.  I received rave reviews.  This is a keeper!

I made this coffee cake today, I wish I would have read the reviews first, because it is way to much streusel and a lot of it got real hard. The cake is very good and not all the streusel got hard so the part that is soft is good with the cake. Next time I make it, I will use half the streusel mixture and put it on half way through cooking.

Being that I did also make some changes, I gave it four stars, but the cake is SUPER AWESOME.  I used a bit less flour and a touch more milk.  Mixed in the berries and only used half the streusel topping.  It's really moist and delicious and a great texture with that streusel kind of baked in! Thank you for this lovely cake!

Made this because I had a lot of fresh blueberries I wanted to use up before they went bad, making only a few changes. I added oatmeal (~1/4 cup) and walnuts (~ 1/4 cup) to the topping and upped the milk to 3/4 cup as others suggested. Baked it for 35 minutes in a 9 X 13 baking dish. Results?: AWESOME! Very much like the To Die for Blueberry Muffins on this site, the kids loved it which is a plus and great for breakfast or a snack. Reheating in the microwave is a must as this was best warm. Definitely adding this to the usual suspects.

Yum, Yum, Yum.
I did make a few changes, however.  I used a 9 inch springform pan instead of a bundt pan.  I used about an extra 1/4 cup of milk as I feel the batter is just too thick otherwise.  I used frozen blueberries both times I've made this and it works just fine.   I sprinkled half the struessel mix on the blueberries before topping with the second half of the batter and then the rest of the struessel mix.
I didn't use the confectioners' sugar at all.
We served this slightly warm with vanilla ice cream.  Made a delicious dessert.

Great Recipe! The cake turned out very moist and soft , (but not falling apart  soft). Made half of original recipe for streusel topping. Used buttermilk instead of milk. Made with frozen berries. ( add 5-7 min more to bake). Smells beautiful and tastes Great! Thank you very much Debbie!

very tasty except I made it in a 9x9 inch pan and slightly over cooked it. I think it would be much nicer and thicker in the proper pan.

Ok, I messed up making the cake part of this and completely skipped the whole creaming the butter & sugar part... I cut in the butter to the dry ingredients, added the beaten egg, milk & vanilla and mixed together. It seemed kinda dry (because of my mistake in the prep?) and so I added 1/4 cup sour cream. It turned out GREAT! Love it when a mistake works out. I also added a little of the streusel with the layer of berries.

make sure you follow the directions to a T. the first time I wasn't really paying attention and added dry to liquid and it didn't turn out. BTW I love this recipe, you could change it to any flavor you want! I've waited a long time to find THIS recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I give this one 5 stars, plus some. This is an excellent recipe, very moist. I did make a couple of changes though based on other reviews. I used a springform pan and decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups. I also used 2 tsp. of vanilla and folded in blueberries to all the batter. Then I spread half of the batter in the pan and topped it with the struesel mix, and spread the remaining batter on top then more struesel mix. This was sooo delicious, especially warm right out of the oven.

I followed the suggestion of adding 3/4 C milk and cutting down the amount of topping.  I also used nonfat milk and egg substitute, and I added the topping in between layers.  Baked in a bundt pan and it came out moist and delicious.  I didn't even need a dusting of sugar.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, half of the cake stuck to my bundt pan and the streusel topping got really hard and crumbly (not pleasant to eat).  This tasted okay but will probably not make again.

Can't give this recipe all 5 stars because I took the very much needed changes that everyone else has done. It turned out fabulou. I was very impressed. Its quite rewarding to create something better than what starbucks sells! There is quite a bit of topping so I do suggest taking half of it and putting it in the middle with the berries, and I dont like the idea of folding the berries into the batter as I was going for the starbucks look and they only have it in the middle and on the top under the struesel. Wonderful will make again!

I made this cake with a bundt pan and the presentation was beautiful. Because the icing was plentiful, I put about half on the bottom of the cake before cooking, and then heated up the rest and added it to the top of the cake after it had cooled.  i then placed blueberries in the cake center's hole and all around the cake on a beautiful cake dish.  I gave this to my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it!  The taste was excellent, the blueberries a great compliment to the cake, and presented beautifully!  THANK YOU!

Love, love, love, loved this!! Tastes amazing!!!
I followed other suggestions and did the 1 1/2 cups of flour, 2 eggs and 3/4c. of milk. Came out moist and perfect. 
I used all the of topping; I put half in the middle with the blueberries and the rest on top. I think it MADE this cake..having some of that yummy strusel in the middle!
The other poster was right..it tastes just like, maybe even better, than Starbucks Blueberry Coffee Cake!

Excellent.  I ended up making a few changes based on other reviews.  I made the entire amount of the topping but ended up needing to add more flour (probably 1 c. total) to get it to a more crumbly consistency.  Then I layered half the topping in the middle with the blueberries (I used 2 cups of blueberries) and sprinkled the other half of the topping on the top (which ends up being the bottom if you use a bundt pan).  I also used 3/4 c. milk.  I baked for 55 minutes, but covered w/ foil for the last 15 minutes to prevent the top from getting too dark.

Good cake. I used a 9" springform pan. Like others have said, I had to add milk until the batter seemed moist enough--almost a cup. I also had to 'flatten' the batter in the pan. As a preference, I folded in the berries instead of layering them.

This was so Delish. I just had 2 slices! I used 3/4 cup buttermilk & frozen mixed berries. Made it in small loaf pans. Didn't change anything else. Excellent!
12/20/08 Update: I made this again. This time I used 1/2 cup of half and half and a small container of vanilla yogurt. It was so moist! I also cut the crumble mixture in 1/2 and sprinkled half in the batter and half on top

This was very yummy!  I made some of the changes suggested by others - cut back on the flour a bit, added a little more milk, added more blueberries, and only made half the topping.  Even with half the topping, it was enough for the middle as well as the top.

I baked it in a 9 1/2 inch springform pan - worked out perfectly.  It baked in about 45-50 minutes.  Definitely will make again.

I followed this recipe except I added more blueberries and wish I would have read other people's reviews first.  I thought the topping was a little too sweet and should have only used half.   The batter was very dry so I would added more milk as suggested by a couple other reviewers and I would also suggest stirring the blueberries into the batter because it spreads them around instead of being on one layer.  Follows these suggestions and you will like it.

We really enjoyed this cake.  I cut down the fat by using 1/4 cup applesauce 1/4 cup butter for the cake.  I also used eggbeaters instead of an egg and 2% milk.  Will definately make again!

I love blueberries, and this recipe uses so many! The batter is also subtle, so the blueberry taste really comes through. I halved the streusel and put it in the bundt pan first and did everything else according to the recipe. It came out awesome! This recipe is a MUST if you love blueberries!!

I thought this was really yummy. I did make a few changes as other reviewers suggested. I used a little more than 1/2 cup milk, maybe 3/4, also an extra egg. I also halved the struesel and filled up the bottom of the pan with it. I still had a little struesel left over so I sprinkled it on top. I found the struesel to be moist not crumbly so I added a litle extra flour and it came out perfect. After I baked it and went to remove it from the pan, to my horror I remembered I forgot to grease it. It came out like a mess but the flavor made up for that.

Absolutely yummy! Moist and delicious. Doubled recipe for 9X13 pan. For doubling, increased milk to 1 1/2 cups and blueberries to 2 cups. Went 1 1/2 of recipe for streusel. Sprinkled 1/3 in middle layer with blueberries.

Delicious!  I used 1 cup of milk and 2 cups Blueberries.  Greased a 9 x 13 pan, poured in batter and topped with topping baked about 45 to 50 minutes.  This recipe is going with me to Canada where we enjoy fresh mountain Blueberries during the Summer months.

This recipe was soooo delicious! I made it two days in a row! All my nieces & nephews ate it until it was gone. It's blueberry season and this recipe is great for fresh blueberries. I made a few changes of my own; for example I sprinkled part of the topping in the middle of the cake after filling the bundt pan halfway with batter. Then added the blueberries and the rest of the batter. I also used vanilla soymilk in place of the regular, dairy milk. This cake was moist, sweet and down right DELICIOUS!!!

I was determined to not tinker with the recipe this time, and that was a mistake: as it's written, this batter is much too dry and the cooking time is too long. The result is a dry, overcooked cake. If I try this again I'll use a regular pan and put the struddle on top.

I agree with the other reviews, this is a great recipe.  I also layered half of the topping with the blueberries (the other half on top).  I used a small off set spatula to spread the 2nd batter layer which made it much easier.  My husband ate half of the coffee cake and he usually doesn't touch desserts.  He kept saying, "This stuff is really addictive!"  Thanks for a great recipe.

What an easy and fast, not to mention yummy, coffee cake!  I took the earlier suggestion and put 1/3 of the topping in the berry layer (I used fresh strawberries rather than blueberries) and then sprinkled 1/3 on top of the batter and sprinkled the remaining 1/3 in my garbage.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Everyone loved it.  Made it in the evening and it was gone by morning.  I added more blueberries than called for.  It was wonderful.  Will make again.

My husband loves blueberry muffins. He has thanked me three times already for making the cake. It is very good...moist and not too sweet! And I'm not the biggest fan of blueberries. I did see that the amount for the streusel seemed too much just to go on top. I cut it down by 1/3, and I think it was just right. Next time, I'll use the entire streusel recipe and put half of it in in with the blueberry layer and half on top. I see others tried that with success.

I ate half of this coffee cake before the night was over. The next day I gave the other half away because I couldn't have it the house out of fear I'd eat the rest. It was moist, delicious, and simply too good to keep. I thought my girlfriend was going to kill me when she got home and asked me where it was cause she had tasted it before going to work and loved it.haha! Luckily for me I'd set a piece aside for her before giving it away. She was relieved:) You can modify this recipe all you want. I didn't think it made enough dough and too much streusel yet when I told my girlfriend she said it was perfect and too much streusel was a good thing? Each to his own I guess:) FIVE STARS!!!!

I should have read the details of the other reviews which "improved" this recipe, and it does need it.  Made it without modifications and the cake was dry and tasteless, except for the streusel.

This is delicious!! I used an angel food cake pan, and it worked fine. I also used frozen blueberries that I thawed. I might add some chopped pecans to the topping next time.

Like many others, I had to use 1 cup of milk. Also, I layered the strudel in the middle of batter and on top. This was by far the best thing I've ever baked...It was moist and Delicious.

This cake was fantastic! I made it for work and one of the docs ate 4 pieces! I did make a few changes that were suggested by other uses. I used canola oil instead of butter in the batter, increased milk to 3/4c. and used 2 cups berries. I did not layer the berries I just folded them into the batter. This recipe is a keeper!

I have no idea what anybody is talking about.  This is essentially a converted muffin recipe.  Adding extra milk and blueberries just turns it into a mushy mess into which the streusel melts.

Delicious! I've made this several times and gotten rave reviews. I follow recipe exactly except I use half the crumble (that's plenty) and bake in a rectangular pan. It's a fabulous way to use fresh blueberries.

What a wonderful, easy to make treat.
I made the suggested changes. 
3/4 of milk &
I folded the blueberries in just before baking and I only made 1/2 the streusel topping (which was plenty)
I am really impressed at how easy it was.
Thanks for sharing

My fiance said that this was "my ultimate favorite dessert".  I made it in a 13x9 pan.  I want to make a few changes next time...fresh, not frozen blueberries, and I want to double the batter and put the blueberries all in a layer in between the batters.  May put half the streusel on between the layers and then drizzle with a vanilla glaze.  Definitely will make again!

Absolutely fantastic!  At first I thought it was "Disaster in a Bundt Pan" because the cake didn't rise as much as I'd expected, then I was kicking myself because I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a little more milk and a little less flour and used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.  I also put half the streusel mixture over the blueberries.  It looked like it was going to fall apart, but I turned it over and out popped a beautiful cake (a little flatter than the pictures, but beautiful).  It tastes FANTASTIC! (How can you go wrong with a pound of butter?)  Rave reviews all around.  Don't be discouraged if the cake looks a little sunken when you take it out of the oven.  This is a keeper!

Good coffee cake, but I'll try a different recipe next time.  There is a lot of struesel, so I put it in the middle of the cake as well as the bottom.  I think it could also use more blueberries.  It's still good though.

This was really awesome!  It is easy to make and really, really moist.  Based on reviews, I did the following: dredged fresh blueberries and folded in the batter, upped the milk to 3/4 c, added a good amount of the streusel into the middle, I also made a lemon/zest glaze and added immediately after turning the cake out.    I couldn't be happier with the outcome!

This was one of the best coffee cakes I have ever made.  It was so moist and delicious, my family ate the whole thing in one sitting.  The only thing I would change is the amount of streusel topping.  I would halve the amount of the ingredients called for.

I have made this recipe many times now and I love it.  I have cut down the butter in the topping to 1/3 cup and sometimes I do juice and zest of one lemon in place of vanilla.  It's in the oven now!  YUM!

Wow. I've made this about a dozen times now and I've had nothing but good reviews.  I did replace the milk with buttermilk though, and I was careful to dredge my frozen berries in some flour and then add to my batter, put it into the oven very quick.  No problems with purple cake.  As well, I never used the streusel, this cake turns out quite well without it.

I just made this cake and after reading reviews, came up with a quick fix for the topping sticking to the pan so that the streusel winds up on the top of the cake. I just ripped a 4 inch wide piece of parchment paper into about 3 inch strips and sprayed first the bundt pan, then layed the strips in; slightly overlapping, then sprayed the strips again. The cake didn't seep under the strips and the streusel carmelized beautifully. I also used a teaspoon of almond extract and a half teaspoon of vanilla and it tasted and smelled wonderful. Hope this helps!

Very good.  Only thing I changed was to add a tablespoon on lemon juice to the cake batter.  And I halves the streusel mixture, because that seemed like too much and it was perfect.

Very moist and delicious.  I wanted a lot of cake bars, so I cooked it in a 9x11.  I added half the batter on the bottom, sprinkled half of the crumble, sprinkled out the 1 cup of blueberries, covered with the rest of the dough, and then the remaining crumble.  I baked for about 40 minutes.  Moist, sweet, and the inner crumble layer added a gooey layer that on its own would be reminiscent of cinnamon buns.  The crumble was not your traditional crumble, but a soft dough that was hard to "sprinkle".  After about baking 15 minutes, I took a spoon and swirled the dough and the melted gooey "crumble."  Easy to make and would make again.

This bread was yummie!! First time baking a blueberry cake.. My bread took 1 hr & 15 mins to bake, I guess cuz I used a 9' round cake pan..since I wanted the streusel on top & didnt wanted to use a bundt pan..but Ill soon get a springform pan.. I followed the recipe as is, except for the streusel part of the brown sugar, I used 1/2 cup & also used the butter soften n I think cuz of tht I had to add more flour to it, so it can have a crumble texture, cuz it looked like cookie dough... but overall it turned out DELICIOUS!!  will keep this recipe n bake again diff!!

MUCH too sweet for coffee cake (it was more like dessert cake).  After making it with only 3/4 cup sugar in the batter and using no streusel, that version was actually quite good.  As written, though, I wouldn't recommend it as a coffee cake due to the super sweetness.

Made a lower fat, moist version:

I doubled everything except the flour (I used 3 cups) in the cake recipe.  I used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the butter in the cake.  I also used frozen, thawed blueberries instead of fresh and did not drain. I only onced the topping recipe.  I baked in a greased 9x13 for about 45 minutes. DELICIOUS

This was great.  My dad ate several pieces and he's not much of a sweet eater and i brought some into work and my boss said it was the best he ever ate (he loves blueberry coffee cake) and this is from the pickiest person i know.  I did make modifications: 3/4 c milk, 2 eggs and half the strusel in the middle.  I also noticed the blueberries sunk a little bit in mine probally because of extra liquid.

Good.  I should have used more blueberries.  I used a bundt pan and it did not make a full bundt pan.  I followed other suggestions and put blueberries in middle with 1/2 topping.

I made this in a non stick black bundt pan.  The topping got a little burnt, but it looked and tasted yummy.  I got lots of compliments from the people at the gathering where I brought it.  This is very similar to the Irish tea cake recipe also from this site, so I am going to add blueberries to the irish tea cake recipe and see how that goes.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I used a bundt pan and layered the cake mix, blueberries, topping.  The mix was hard to spread so I would definately decrease the flour to 1 1/2 cups. I did increase milk to 3/4 and added an additional egg. I used canned blueberries and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Baked for 55 min. It turned out great..just a little dry.

Came out AWESOME but I'm not sure how it would've turned out without making the changes so many have suggested.  Used a springform pan.  Did the full 2 cups flour but upped the milk to 3/4 cup and added an additional egg. Used all of the topping (cuz that's the best part IMO) and about a cup and a half of frozen blueberries.  The batter is really thick so the blueberries didn't sink. Professional looking and tasting results.

This recipe is great, I have used fresh and frozen blueberries as well as apples. It has come out great everytime. I believe the streusel topping is the best part of this, so I don't half it as suggested by others.

Good recipe. Tastes very good. Could do with a little less sugar according to my family. I used the modifications according to previous reviews - used 1.5 cups flour and increased the milk to 3/4 cup. Do not use spray! It sticks. Well greased pan should work better.

I did as other reviewers suggested and reduced the flour to 1 1/2 c. and increased the milk to 3/4 c. I made half the streusel topping and put it in the bottom of the bundt pan and then put the cake batter on top. The cake looked and tasted great. I will definitely make it again.

First I need to caution you to NOT use a spray (Pam) on your pan, as mine stuck, use shortening instead. I did cut back on the flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased the milk to 3/4 cups. This was excellent and I will be making this again! When my DH was eating this all I could hear was YUMMMMMMMMMMM!!!

This cake was pretty good.  I did have to add more milk (wish I woulda read the reviews first) and even then I had to spoon the batter in with the fruit.  didnt want a bundt (upside down) cake so I made it in an 8x8 pan which made it really thick but then there was way too much topping.  It has a good texture and a nice flavor but wasn't quite what we'd expected for our easter coffee cake.  I'd almost make this like a cakey cobbler instead, just triple the amount of fruit (or cut down on the dough) and make it in a 9x13.  In any case, I made the recipe as directed and it isn't one I would say is "the best!" so I gotta give it 4 stars.  It certainly is a good dessert and I will be making it again, but as a cobbler next time with less dough.

i have made this for a few brunches now and it is always a hit.  i have shared the recipe and people love it.  I took others advice and spead half of the topping in the middle.  I tried this with canned cherries - not good.  I use canned blueberries and it is really great.

I always love to "tweak" recipes to make them my own...however, I made this exactly as written & it was the most delicious coffee cake I've ever had! Leave the blueberry layer in the middle & go for the whole amount of streusel topping - delicious! My only modification was the baking time - my oven only needed 50 minutes, so don't overbake it.

One word: FANTASTIC!!  I've been asked several times for this recipe.  I love it and so does my family.  It's very simple to make and has the best flavor.  A great way to use up those extra blueberries.

This cake was easy to make but it was a little bland in taste.  I modified the topping by substituting 1/2 the topping flour for quick cooking oats.  I also sprinkled half the topping on the cake batter before adding the blueberries.

I didn't measure the blueberries, I just distributed them evenly and I'm pretty sure I used more than 1 cup. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter and used a tube pan. We had this on Christmas morning with Mimosa!  It is definitely a special occasion treat with all of that butter, but totally worth it! YUM!

Followed the advice: halved the streusel topping, increased milk to 3/4, decreased sugar to 2/3 cup (don't llike it too sweet), added 2 eggs instead of 1, increased blueberries to 1.5 cup. Still thought the batter was a bit dry. But it turn out alrite. It's not dry nor is it buttery moist. I thought it's just nice but don't seem to keep well cos by next day, it was getting hard.

Incredible! I absolutely love this cake, and I live at high altitude (5600) and have lived at normal altitudes, and it works everywhere I've tried it. I use half wheat and half white flour or 3/4 white wheat flour (white spring wheat) and 1/4 white flour, and it still tastes marvelous. I definitely use 3/4 cup of milk and 1 1/2 cups blueberries as others have suggested. I've used buttermilk in place of the milk and it makes for a tender crumb in the cake. There is a lot of topping, but I've tried halfing it and that's too little so maybe somewhere in between would be perfect and a little more healthy.

We have a bumper crop of blueberries this year, so I've been baking for 2 weeks!  This is one of the best cakes--I didn't change a thing.  But, next time I'll add MORE berries.

This was super good, just like all the reviews said. After making it once, I can't wait to make it again!  I followed the other reviews advice: (1) 9" springform pan, (2) increase milk to 3/4 cup, (3) I decreased white sugar to 3/4 cup since there was already the streusel topping, and (4) another layer of streusel after the fruit.  I had a 6 oz container of fresh blueberries, and it was delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Ok well I made this ‘cake’, following the direction carefully, and it’s somewhere between….like some people have said… one big jelly, and a disgusting energizer bar! I seriously thought that it had a life of its own in the oven!

This was so yummy.  I sprinkled half of the topping over the batter before I added the blueberries, and then used the rest on top and that was enough.  Mine cooked for 65 minutes.  I loved this cake, I thought it was better the next day.

This was really good, I didn't have a bundt cake pan on hand so I just used a regular circular pan. I also used cranberries instead of blueberries because that is what my family likes. It was SUPERB! yummmmm

I had very good luck with this recipe. It was a big hit with the grandkids and with the my elderly parents. I used finely chopped apples and layered them with the streusel. I used a 9X9 pan and it worked out very well. I did not find it all dry but very moist. oh yes I used buttermilk (one cup instead of half cup of milk) and added extra flour to the streusel. thanks

I've made this twice in the past 2 weeks--it's awesome! I took some of the advice posted here... used 3/4 c. milk and cut the streusal topping in half (trust us, there's plenty!). I also used an entire pint of blueberries and layered half of the topping in the middle with the blueberries. I used an 8" x 8" square pan and baked for the full 50-60 minutes. Rave reviews both times:)

This was excellent, the topping turned out nice and crunchy. I did add extra milk to the batter like other suggested and I added a little bit of ground cloves, ground ginger, and nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon to add a little more depth to the flavor.

This was pretty good, although it was a little sweet for my taste.  I would cut down on the brown sugar next time, to about 3/4 of a cup.  I made them in muffin tins and baked them for 28 minutes to make "personal" sized coffee cakes :)

Pretty good, everyone at work loved it. Cake reminded me of angelfood cake. Next time would stir fresh blueberries in with mix rather than layer, made the middle kinda mushy. Used a bundt pan, but makes it impossible to get topping ON the top.

This is a delicious cake except the cake part seemed a little to thin. The second time I made it I increased the cake by 1 1/2, and left the topping as is and it came out perfect and was enjoyed by all.

This is a good coffee cake, and easy to put together.  I used freshly ground soft wheat flour and sucanat for brown sugar and sucanat with honey for white sugar.  I substitued oil for the butter, but I don't think I'll do that again.  I think sticking with butter makes the coffee cake better tasting.  I had no problem substituting frozen blueberries for fresh.

A nice moist cake that is tasty.  Only half of the topping is needed unless you like your coffee cake quite sweet.  The original recipe makes a smaller cake - Try making one and a half times the original recipe if you want a larger cake for presentation.  I also added 1 tsp. of Watkins butter extract and it turned out well.  Thanks for the lovely recipe!

Delicious!  I served this for a first communion brunch for my son, and everyone raved about it.  Not a crumb left over.  I gave the recipe to a friend, and she made it with raspberries, and said it was fantastic!  Thanks for sharing.

Really good, especially warm!  But if you use all of the streusel, it is very sweet.  I used the bundt pan and layered the ingredients.  This would be good with peaches or cherries too.

I tried this recipe with fresh raspberries instead of blueberries. Be sure to eat it warm, since it's less tasty after it cools.

This was a great recipe. My 7-year-old loved helping me make this and it turned out SO yummy! I took some of the other reviewers' advice and when I did the blueberry layer, I also threw in some of the crumb topping. There's plenty of it and would have been TOO much for just the top. I also made this in a bread pan and it took the same amount of time to bake and it turned out awsome! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great recipe! Everyone at work loved it. I added more blueberries (1 1/2c) and covered them w/ some of the streusel. Also, I used 3/4 c of buttermilk instead of milk which made it moister. Definitely will make this again and again.

This cake recieved rave reviews from my coffeeklatsch! It was SUPER easy and quick to make.  The only down side...I found the batter a little dry, so added a touch more milk than the recipe called for.  The end result was a super moist, delicious cake! Definitely one to try.

I love this recipe. I did follow the others and add just a little more milk. It was a really big hit! Tonight I am going to make it my own and mix some rasberries, blueberries and macadamia crushed nuts. I am going to play with this recipe. Thank you! I will add a photo later, if nobody snags it before I do!

This coffee cake turned out amazing!!  My 11-year old daughter made this recipe entirely on her own.  I helped a little with blending the streusel topping but she measured, mixed, and assembled this cake.  Her comment was "it's a little dry" but I pointed out that coffee cake is supposed to be a little crumbly, more than a regular cake.

Not too sweet, perfect buttery-ness, and I would have added JUST a few more blueberries, poking some into the batter versus just a layer in the middle.

If I rate a recipe, I've made it once, exactly as written.  As written this coffee cake is much to dry.  You must increase the milk to 3/4 of a cup.  After I increased the milk it was a very good recipe.

Made this recipe for a family brunch and it was delicious. Very moist, easy to make and turns out beautifully in a bundt pan. There WAS a lot of streusel and probably could have used less but it was lucious with all that crisp topping

Easy to prepare, but after reading other suggestions.....adding a second egg and adding more milk, came out dry. Nice taste/flavor, but dry. Won't make again.

Cake was dry, even though I cooked it for less time.  "Streusel topping" was too hard, probably would have benefited from omitting the flour.  Love this website, though, and will keep trying other recipes.  Thanks! Carmen

added the zest of a lemon to the batter and replaced the streusel with a lemon glaze made from lemon juice & powdered sugar, upped the blueberries to 1.5 C. &  Followed some of the modifications of others and used an extra egg yolk (had them in the fridge) and then reduced the flour to 1.5 cups.  I also subbed soy milk because we no longer drink dairy.  Good cake!

Made this for my sister's birthday. Both her and our mother agreed that this recipe should be chiseled into metal to protect it for the ages.

Would give this recipte 4 1/2 stars, but don't know how to click on half star.  Also used 3/4 cup of milk and added 1 tsp. almond extract.  Used frozed blueberries, (rolled on paper towel to absorb frost) then tossed with 1 tbsp. flour before adding mixture to Bundt pan.  Lovely flavour.  Served to company and they raved about recipe too.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

Based on the original recipe, I gave it 3 stars.  Good flavor but no wow factor.  Bundt pan seems too big for volume of cake.  All streusel (which was way too much) on the bottom of a bundt seems odd.

The taste was great.  However, the topping sunk and made the cake weak in the center.  Therefore, the cake crumbled as I tried to get it out of the pan.  I bake all the time, and haven't had this happen before.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Very good. Like other reviewers suggested, I increased the milk to 3/4 cup and put half of the topping mix with the blueberry layer. I also added a glaze made with conf. sugar and lemon juice.

I made this for a group of adults at a childs party - it was delicious and received rave reviews.  I added some extra milk to avoid dryness, and mixed in frozen bluberries.  I baked in a bundt pan and when I turned it over to serve, the bottom crumble remained cruchy.  Yum!

I followed someones advise to put the cumb on the bottome of the pan, it stuck and it wouldnt let go when I tried to flip it out.  It was very good, but next time I will put it on the top.

AMAZING!!!  I used 3/4c milk, 2.5 tsp cinnamon and about 1 1/4c blueberries.  It came out perfectly moist and delicious!!!  I also put half the streusel in the middle with the blueberries and the rest on top.  Be careful not to overcook as the topping will harden.  Side note, I tried making it without the blueberries and it seemed a bit on the dry side.  It's definitely not the same without the fruit, but still tasty.

It wasn't the greatest, but wasn't bad either.   The batter didn't seem like enough to make this coffee cake. The cake came out about 2 inches high in the bundt pan. Something wasn't right, but everyone in my family loved it.

I'm not sure how good this recipe is because I made all the suggested changes, used 3/4 c. buttermilk, extra 1/2 c. blueberries and only half the topping which really was enough. I also used a springform pan which makes way more sense then putting topping on top of the cake in a bundt pan and then flipping it upside down. So the recipe was good, it just needs some fine tuning.

This recipe gets better each time I make it. I made it for a party this weekend. There were tons of other desserts and this one vanished before I even got a piece. I made it in a silicone pan that was a flower design and just looking at it made your mouth water not to mention the smell when I removed the lid. It is so good now that blueberries are in season. I did use 3/4 cup milk and put the blueberries in the batter and layered the batter and topping. Five stars does not give it the credit it deserves. This one is a keeper.

This was VERY good. My only complaint was that it SHOULD NOT be baked in a bundt pan. It was very hard to get out and when I finally did get it out, some was still left in the pan. Very pleasing to the mouth but not the eyes considering the top half was missing!

This was just OK for me. The crumb topping (which was really the bottom) made it way too sweet. I will try a different blueberry cake next time.

This is one of the best cakes that I have ever made, especially on the simple side. I have been married for 44 yrs and raised 3 sons and 9 GC so that is a lot of cakes to cook. I think any way that you choose to make it look it is still the wonderful cake that the recipe calls for. Thank you for a great addition to my baking.

This is a pretty good coffee cake recipe. Made this w/ my nieces Sat. morning. When my sister & her family come to town (usually a few times a yr.), my 2 nieces stay w/ me 1 night. We try to make breakfast if we have time (and I can get them out of bed b4 noon - lol!). While I think this is good, it needs a bit of tweaking to make it great IMHO. First, as many reviewers warned, there is WAAAY too much streusel topping. I suggest quartering the amt. (I still think 1/2 would be overkill...). And, as many others did, we used a 9 in. springform pan greased w/ Crisco baking spray (i.e. the kind w/ flour in it). We also folded fresh blueberries (1 1/2 c.) into our batter rather than making a layer of them & used 1 1/2 c. flour / 3/4 c. milk.  We layered 1/2 of the batter, followed by 1/2 of the streusel mix., the rest of the batter & the remaining topping. I think the batter could use some fresh lemon zest (it complements blueberry quick breads nicely) and I will be sure to add it if I make this again. I was surprised that my cake didn't rise like DetectiveL's did (her pic looks so nice... and yummy!)... oh well :) I am anxious to try To Die For Blueberry Muffins by Colleen b4 giving this another go. My bf did mention that both girls really liked this (I was taking a shower while they ate it), so it wasn't THAT bad, I guess.... Thx. for sharing!

I made the recipe exactly as written. The cake was good, the crumb topping was not so good. Too hard/crunchy. Might try again but will tweak crumb topping.

I brought this to a mother/daughter tea today, and it received rave reviews!  I was concerned that I didn't have enough batter to fill my bunt pan, but it turned out perfect.  I also followed the previous advice to use 3/4 buttermilk and 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.  This worked well for me.  The cake was moist and yummy.  I also used frozen blueberries, as that was what was available to me, and they worked just fine.

I'm not sure what happened, but this did not turn out very good. It broke apart in chunks and the taste was not that great. It stuck to my bundt pan on the bottom. I would not make this again.

Fantastic recipe. I made as directed except substituted half and half for the milk (just needed to use it up) and used frozen blueberries. I baked in a 10" round pan for approximately 50 minutes and it turned out perfect. Very moist and delicious. I liked the idea of putting some streusel in the middle and will do that next time.

Scrumptious! I loved this coffee cake recipe. The cake was moist and the crunchy topping was great. I followed other reviewers advice and added the crumb topping after it baked for a few minutes.

I LOVED this light and delicious coffee cake!  I used frozen bluberries, which I had slightly thawed and it came out great.  I also used a springform pan, and it popped out beautifully!  I only used half of the topping, that was plenty.  I also added slightly more milk, because it seemed a little too thick.  Overall, excellent recipe!  I will use this again and again!

I baked them in muffin tins and let me tell you, they turned out amazing. I also used plums instead of peaches. The end result, a fluffy fluffy moist cake. No one called it a muffin, because a muffin can't compare to this.

I really didn't like this cake at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that there was way too much of the topping and it turned out very dry.  My entire family didn't like it at all.  Wouldn't reccommend this to anyone.

Good cake.Followed others' advice and increased the milk,egg. Used  9" springform pan. Put part of struesel in the middle with blueberries and raspberries. Next time will add some citrus zest and cinnamon to the batter. NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH STRUESEL!!!

I thought this was super!  The only thing I changed was that I cut the topping in half because I used an 8" springform pan and the original amount of topping was way too much.  Everyone loves it!

Very yummy... I replaced the topping in this recipe with my own streusel, which uses much less sugar... Also used more milk since the batter was rather dry.

This was really good. I cut the recipe in half, didn't do the layers, and just baked it in a bread pan. Rolled the blueberries in flour before adding to the batter, and it turned out very nicely. Would definately make this again!

Absolutely FANTASTIC! Tried with blueberries then with strawberries. The more berries the better - fresh or frozen. Make sure to add struesel over berries then more batter then berries and the rest of the struesel. DYNAMITE!!

This cake is moist and wonderful.  I increased the ingredients by 1 1/2 and made it in a 9 x 13 inch pan since I don't have a bundt pan.  It turned out great.  Instead of sprinkling with powdered sugar, I made a glaze from 1 cup powdered sugar and 2T water, which I poured over the cooled cake.  Made it look beautiful.  This is a great recipe and a definite keeper.

This was good, but not exceptional.  As I passed it out to my colleagues, I advertised it as an ugly cake. I prepared it in a bundt pan as directed, however, the crumb topping made it incredibly difficult to invert.  It crumbled into countless pieces.  I did not read the reviews before preparing, and I would agree that it needs a. more liquid, b. more blueberries, c. less "crumb" topping.

I made this for breakfast yesterday. I thought maybe I messed up the recipe because it would not get done. I went over the recipe again and realized that I had put 1cup of milk insted of 1/2 cup. It came out wonderful. I ended up cooking it about 11/2 hrs. sooo good!!

I really wasn't impressed with this recipe-sorry.  The cake was bland and the blueberries sank to the bottom.  I didn't realize that the crumb topping would sink into the batter as it cooked so I put hardly any on and ended up with no topping.  I'll look for other recipes.

Like everyone else, I'm rating on the changed recipe but it came out so moist I had to write about it.  I used 1.5 cups flour, 3/4 cup milk, 2 eggs, and halved the topping.  I also baked in a springform pan.  It came out really dark and a little ugly but once I put the powdered sugar on it, it looked fine.

Very good! I follwed the recipe exactly, but used Egg Beaters, Splenda and Soy Milk. I think the picture shows it in a springform pan, not a bundt pan. I used a bundt and the topping ends up on the bottom. Oh well! It didn't affect the taste one bit.

This was a wonderful recipe. I was afraid that it wasn't going to bake up properly but I was pleasently surprised when it came out of the oven. I made this for a potluck at work and it was gone within minutes. I had a few requests for the recipe. I will be making this again

This is excellent... My 9 year old actually requested this for his birthday cake this year!  I did follow suggestions of other reviewers and increased the milk to 3/4 cup and used 2 eggs.  I also sprinkle some of the topping over the berries before adding the second half of the batter.

Excellent recipe!  People were begging me to bring the cake again next week! Made 1/2 topping, reduced flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased milk to 3/4 cup. Baked in spring form pan and will do the same again.  Cake good at room temp. but even better warm.  Definitely going into my recipe file.  Thanks!

This was OK. It took longer than I planned to bake. It was also too sweet for my taste. I made it for guests and was not OTT about it. I like the recipe for fabulous pecan coffee cake on this site, next time I would just add berries to that. Sorry, I wanted to LOVE it.

I wanted fewer servings so I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9 X 9 in pan.  I should have used a smaller pan - there wasn't enough batter to cover all the blueberries.  Even so, it was wonderful for Easter brunch.  I used about 1 cup of frozen blueberries, thawed slightly and rinsed.  I did not change the milk or the flour ratio as suggested by other reviewers and the batter did come out quite thick (almost like a cookie dough).  However, I did not find the cake to be dry.  I will make this again and again.  Next time I will try a smaller pan - maybe a loaf pan.

Very good and easy recipe!! I substituted 1 cup of chopped apple for the bluberries. I didn't have brown sugar so I scrapped the struesel and just mixed in a little bit of cinnamon and white sugar in the middle with the apples. I also made a glaze of maple extract, icing sugar, and bit of milk and poured it on while the cake was warm. Tasted delicious!!!

I wish I had read all of the reviews on this recipe before I tried it. Obviously this recipe requires more milk and less flour. Mine is in the oven right now as written and it is hideous. I'm sure the recipe is yummy after the alterations are made but I am going to keep looking for a coffee cake recipe that I don't have to tweak.

hmm.. this recipe seems to have flawed information. A bundt pan is a tube pan, and is therefore an upside-down kind of cake.. yet the instructions tell you to put the extra streusel at the top after all of the batter has been poured in (which would be the bottom of the cake since it's in a bundt pan!!). I put all the streusal as the middle layer w/ the fruit. Also, there is not nearly enough batter for a bundt pan (I use a 9" one).. I had to double the cake recipe and I used extra milk as well as less flour as previous users suggested.
After around 75 minutes the cake was ready. The look? Not a very pretty looking cake. The taste? Nothing spectacular. The flavor is farely plain. This doesn't have that rich and fluffy 'cake' type texture that I associate with most cakes. There were too many recipe flaws and I had to take suggestions from other reviewers, and even then I didn't get a super great cake.. so this gets 3 stars. Very average.

This was excellent!  I only used 1-3/4 cups of flour based on some of the other reviews.  I think it worked because it was super moist!  Also, I only used 1/2 of the crunch topping.  This seemed to be plenty.

This was very good - very yummy!  I also liked the candy crunch of the topping - which ends up in the middle rather than the top.  Will do this again.

This was good. The batter for some reason was really thick. It was a good recipe besides the fact that I'd have used about half the blueberries. The cake was pretty dense, but the flavor was great.

This cake was delicious, although a little sweet to my taste.  The topping could have easily been cut in half.  Overall, great recipe!

This tastes pretty good...but I made this in a bundt pan, because I was too chicken to not follow the directions, and that was a big mistake.  Well, actually IDK what happened, but the topping turned into like caramel.  And so it was really hard to get out of the pan.  I'm just cutting slices out of it.  I may make this again in a diff pan.  Bundt pans are scary to me, lol.  Anyone have any thoughts about why my topping didn't turn out right?

I rarely use my bundt pan, but this bakes well in a 9 X 13 pan as well as makes one dozen muffins.  To cut back on the fat, I do not use the streusel topping.  Instead I add 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture and sprinkle a little sugar over the top before baking.  Depending on the pan used, times do have to be varied.  Cake is done when it is golden brown.

These were wonderful!  I have made them several times for myself and my husband and we love them.  I also took them to a church breakfast and I got raves there as well.  I do add a little more blueberries and a little more confectioner's sugar because we like it really sweet.  Thanks for the post.

What a great coffe cake.  This is certainly universal, and I look forward to playing around with different fruits and maybe even a cream cheese swirl version.  I added a little almond extract to the batter to give it a little extra kick.  Use a tube pan, not a bundt pan  and it comes out perfect.

I thought this was just OK. I did as other suggested and put the topping in the pan first so it's on top.  Also, it needed more blueberries.  I've never made coffee cake before but mine was pretty dry as well.

Very good and rich. The strudel had more of a frosting texture to it but it was no biggie. Followed other people's suggestion of more milk (3/4 cup) and some of the strudel on top of the blueberries. Next time I think I will try strawberries, I think any kind of berry would be good in this.

Made it today for a brunch and my friends absolutely loved it.  I made some changes though:buttered AND floured cake pan. Made only half streusel and used half of that on the tin and half in the middle of the cake. Used 2 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar. Combined 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup sour cream and added it to egg mixture alternately with flour. Added 2 cups blueberries to the batter. Added a pinch of freshly ground cardamom.  Cooked in tube pan for 45 mins.

I used a bundt pan for this and was a little confused -- shouldn't the topping go in first, so that way it is on the top of the bundt cake when finished?  I chose to add the "topping" in the center of the cake instead of where the recipe suggested.  I still had a lot of topping leftover, so I sprinkled it onto what was the bottom of the finished coffee cake.  Also I used about 2 cups of frozen blueberries.  It turned out very nicely and I will be making this again.

I made this for Easter brunch - my first coffee cake!  Everyone LOVED it and my cousins told me I've inherited my mother's baking genes (Mom is known for her cooking).  I'm not a fan of coffee cake, so that's the main reason I only gave it 4 stars.  The only other thing keeping it from 5 stars is the streusel topping.  When you make this recipe in a bundt pan, the topping ends up as the bottom when it's inverted.  I thought this was a little strange, and it made the cake slide around on the plate a bit (my husband thought it was a sweet little surprise, though!).  Changes I made: increased the milk and nearly doubled the bluberries as other reviewers suggested; mixed 1/2 of the topping into the berries ;I also increased the whole recipe by 1.5 to make a full bundt (SO glad I did that!!) which increased the cooking time to about 70-75 minutes.  Mom was impressed which made me proud.  I'd make it again, maybe with a springform next time...

This was just ok for me.  The taste was allright.  I used the recommended amount of blueberries but maybe it would be better if I used more.  Also I would stick to just putting strusel in the bottom of the bundt pan so it comes out on top when inverted.  Like other reviewers, I did have to add about 1 1/2 cups more milk and another egg to get it to a more batter-like consistency.  Probably won't make this again unfortunately.

Based on other reviews, I used 2 eggs (they were smallish) and 200 ml milk. I baked it in a 9x9 pan, which only took 45 minutes. It was perfect - the cake's texture just after it came out of the oven was heavenly. (I would have given this recipe 5 stars but the amount of additional liquid called for is a major adjustment.) Also, the reason I found this recipe in the first place is because I had sugar-free blueberry jam which we didn't care for because it was too sour, so I used that instead. I'm sure fresh berries of any kind would be great, but the jam (I guess as long as it's not watery or too syrupy) was good too - it allowed me to spread it around for even distribution. If doing the jam substitution, put more than half of the batter on the bottom so that the dollops of batter on top don't close, sandwiching the blueberry layer. Having some of the blueberry layer show on top makes for prettier presentation.  I also just used as much streusel as I thought I wanted in the middle and and on top, and I had plenty left over. Next time I want to try this with some lemon rind in the batter to give it a refreshing, tangy flavor, because I think lemon complements blueberries.

I don't know about you but I didn't have much batter to go around in the bundt pan. It's alot better if you just go with a square pan. Theres to much streusel topping... made it to sweet.

This is a great recipe, and can be modified as desired!  I used the following recipe (the original with my modifications in parenthesis):
streusel:
1 cup packed brown sugar 
2/3 cup all-purpose flour 
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/2 cup butter 
(I added about 3/4 c. of pecans and pulsed all together in a food processor)

Cake batter: 
2 cups all-purpose flour 
2 teaspoons baking powder 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 cup butter 
1 cup white sugar (decreased to 3/4 cup)
1 egg 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (also put 1/2 t. almond extract)
1/2 cup milk (increased to 1 c. milk until it was a good spreadable consistency)
1 cup fresh blueberries (used dried, plus 1/2 c. dried raspberries)
added 1/3 c. sour cream to batter)
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting (omitted)

I added 1/2 of berries to batter, and layered the other half of berries with 1/2 of streusel topping in between batter layers.  On top, I put half the remaining streusel.
(I'll use leftover streusel on muffins another day- this recipe made so much, partly b/c I added nuts!)
It's delicious, and even my husband liked it who usually isn't into blueberries!

I made this receipe New Year's Day, and it was fabulous, it was very moist and had great texture!  I used 6 oz. of milk instead of the 1/2 c. and used 2 cups of thawed, frozen mixed berries that I keep on hand from Costco. I also reduced the crumb topping by half and was glad I did as there was plenty of topping to cover the square baking dish that I used.  I found that it was done in about 45 minutes, since I used a glass dish.  I will definitely make this again, and probably try using a 13" baking dish and doubling the recipe for company.  This will become one of my new favorite brunch recipes!

With a few adjustments, this could be a really yummy crumb cake.  The topping is too hard - less brown sugar, maybe add oats.  The cake is a little dry - bake shorter time and maybe add some sour cream?  Has definite potential.

I followed the recipe exactly and my cake was dry and crumbly. The 'topping' was hard to cut and difficult to chew. I am throwing it out. Very dissapointed.

This is a nice basic recipe.  I glanced at the other reviews and followed their suggestions, including: 1) halve the topping ingredients 2)use 2 cups blueberries (I folded these into the batter rather than sprinkling them on top) 3) I used about 1-1/2 cups buttermilk rather than 1/2 milk, to make it spreadable 4)baked it in 13x9 pan.

this is a good basic cake recipe. i used strawberries instead and layered the streusel in with the batter instead of putting it on top.

I followed the recipe and it came out very very dry. Also the streusel was almost too hard to chew. Will not make again.

I thought the streusal topping was very chewy. Next time I will swirl it into the cake. I will also swirl the blueberries throughout the cake too.

This was yummy!  I did increase the milk to 3/4 cup and make sure you add more blueberries (1 whole pint) and decrease the topping by at least a third.

I doubled this recipe in hopes of making the bundt cake and some muffins, but no deal - it only made the cake! WHich makes me wonder how small this would be at the normal amount?  I baked it for the min. time and found it came out dry.  This was not a favorite, and it wasn't gobbled up.

This recipe was "to die for."  It was gone in 2 hours!  I did exactly what the recipe said and it came out fantastic.  I think next time I will make it in a square pan, so I can cut it into squares.  I would add some more blueberries and decrease the amount of topping (there is alot!).  But it is something that I have been dreaming about since I made it and can't wait to make another!

This is my first review, and I am delighted with this recipe! I took advice of other cooks and increased blueberries to 1 1/2 c. and milk to 3/4 cup. It is very moist and came out perfect from my bundt pan after using cooking spray, only 45 min to bake. My son and I put a little whipped cream on it for desert after dinner...we couldn't wait for breakfast to try it! I will make this again! Thank you Debbie.

Excellent recipe! I did follow the advice of other users and added more blueberries (1 1/2C) More milk (3/4C)and adding the yummy cinnamon mixture to the middle too. I Put the crumblys on top and when I flipped the cake over to cool it. It worked beautifully. My boyfriend ate almost the whole thing in 2 days!!!!

This is not something that I'll be making again -at least not the doubled recipe. Hubby and I stayed up late waiting for this to be done.  The house smelled AMAZING.  All flavors were very mild - not what I was expecting with all of the rave reviews.  We had to cook it for about 1 hour and 20 minutes as the center wouldn't set.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 x 13.  The extra cooking time made the bottom and sides very chewy which was very unappealing.

I am giving this four stars because I found the cake a bit dry.  I made it in a bundt pan, and I think the pan may have been too large (although I thought the pan was an average size).  Next time I would double the batter recipe for a bundt pan, or just use a square pan.  The taste of the cake was good, but there just was not enough to the cake portion.

I thought this was absolutely delicious!!  I followed the directions exactly and even used a fluted tube pan and it came out perfect.  I lot of reviewers said that it sticks to the pan and comes out messy but if you flour the pan after you grease it...it comes out very clean....!!

the actual cake was yummy, but don't overlook how you're going to get the struessel on. one reviewer said he melted the struessel and drizzled it on top after he flipped it over. it might have worked for him, but it made my cake look like poo. also, be generous with your cooking spray or part of your cake will stick to the pan and it will be a big mess. budnt pans are prettier, but if you want a coffee cake with a good struessel on top, USE A REGULAR PAN! my cake looks like poo :( but tastes great

This was really good.  I went the other viewers and doubled the recipe for  9x11 pan. I will probably only make 1 & 1/2 times the recipe the next time.  Doubling is a little much.  Very good cake!  Very easy to make!

We are eating this fresh out of the oven and it
is excellent!  I have made it with vanilla soy milk and also buttermilk, using 3/4 cup, and used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.  I removed some of the butter as I was cutting it into the topping because it seemed to be too much.  Layered batter, berries, streusel, then repeated that and it makes a very moist, flavorful bundt cake.  Tested done with a toothpick in 45 min. so watch it carefully!

Awesome cake! I followed some suggestions of others: I needed to add some fluid so I used approx 3/4 cup of milk mixed with sour cream (and a touch more baking powder). Recipe as is makes for a small bundt, but still tastes great....maybe 1 1/2 recipe for next time.

Great recipe...I baked it in a 9x9 square pan and used half cup more blueberries and 2/3 cup buttermilk (powdered kind).
It was MOIST, buttery tasting cake with delicate crumb and sensational cinna-buttery topping.  Hubby loved it. I think next time I'll bake it in muffin cups so I can freeze easily.

I took the advise from the reviews and I used   1 1/2 Cups of blueberries, and a cup of milk.  My family loved it for Easter dessert with coffee.  Next time I will not use all of the struesel because I thought it was a little too sweet.  Great recipe!

I might be tempted to say this is the best coffee cake I have ever eaten! Light cake, not dry like coffee cake can be. I put frozen defrosted blackberries in the middle and the family went wild! Next time I think I will bake it in a regular pan instead of a bundt. The topping ended up on the bottom when you invert the pan.

I usually limit my baking to cookies, but I tried out this recipe and it was absolutely delicious. (Let's just say noone believed I made it)! Hint: sprinkle some of the streusel topping on your batter as a middle layer. Very yummy!!!

My 20 month old eats nothing, but he ate this.  i  made this for a baby group get together and it was a last minute thing and so easy to make.  It was a huge hit!  I thank you for this splendid recipe and welcome any others you have.  I especially liked the amount of struesel topping it made.  Wonderful!!

I’m not much of a baker, more a cook so I found the instructions a little confusing, but the end results were delicious. Definitely making this again.

I wish I had read some of the comments before making this cake. I would have use only half for the top layer. 
I was a little confused when I took it out if the pan
 should I turn it over or leave it as the bun. 
so I turn it over and it started to fall a part. Then I turn it back into the bun cake. I wish you had mentioned this is your video or direction. 
Overall it was ok but a little too sweet.

This was a hit at a coffee morning for my walking group.
I followed suggestions and doubled the blueberries, put chopped nuts in topping, used half topping on berries and made it in a springform pan. Delicious!

This was very good!  I used a can of Oregon brand canned blueberries 15oz because it’s what I had on hand.  The batter was crazy thick and I was worried about it but it cooked well.  I checked it at 35 minutes and it was done.  Any longer and it would it would be dry and burned.  Next time I would put the topping in the middle layer with the blueberries.  I thought it was weird and a little crunchy on the bottom but still very good!

DELICIOUS.  Put in a 9x9 heavy ceramic baking dish.  Put closer to 2/3 of the heavy batter (added 1-2 tablespoons more of milk).,

I made this according to the recipe except for  adding two teaspoons of lemon juice and using 2 cups of blueberries. I didn't understand why everyone else was thinning the batter out until I tried to pour it into the pan--it's impossible! I ended up smearing it all over the place. I have no regrets, because I don't think it would be nearly as heavy and delicious if I'd thinned it out, but it didn't exactly look like the picture. Also, it took 90 minutes to bake! But it's so delicious, who cares?

I have made a few modifications and it comes out excellent this way as well...3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup. Plus I fold in two cups fresh blueberries into the cake mix. Make the streusel topping as in recipe but place it all on the top and bake in springform pan. Everyone always loves it and Be prepares for friends to ask for the recipe!

I cut granulated sugar to 3/4 cup and used buttermilk instead of whole milk. I increased blueberries to 1 pint. I also used a 9” round free form cake pan that made it easier to layer batter, blueberries & streusel. Coffee cake is luscious with these changes!

This was very decadent.  I didn’t have a bundt pan so used an oval ceramic dish.  If you use a ceramic dish, it takes a little longer.  But if you just keep checking with a tooth pick every 5 minutes after the called for time you won’t have an issue.  The cake was so moist and flavorful, I almost didn’t want to share it.  With the blueberries it evened out the sweet.  The topping was flavorful and not too sweet.  Be sure when making the crumble to work with cold butter so it doesn’t melt into a blob.  That has happened before.  The crust then gets really hard.  This will definitely be my go to coffee cake recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly just to see and it was way too dry.  Would try it again by adding another egg and a little more milk.  Way too much strudel for just the bottom.  I can see why some individuals altered this recipe.

It stuck so bad in the bundt cake pan. If I make it again I won’t put it in that pan. The topping stuck so no way to get it out. We will eat it as a crumb cake with ice cream.

I made it exactly as the recipe was written and it is very good.  Next time I will shorten my baking time by 10 minutes as it
was slightly dry, albeit tasty.  My oven may be running a little hotter, so I'll adjust.  VERY tasty.

This is sooooooo good! I made it exactly how the recipe calls for. It is very sweet but the blueberries balance it out, I used a pint of blueberries. This is my go to recipe for something sweet and quick! Next time I will half the  strudel topping Bc it was way to much.

So we all really liked this and it was super easy to make!

Following some suggestions by other reviewers I used 3/4 cups milk and put the streusel topping in the middle. The streusel did make a LOT, so I put the extra in the freezer since I'll probably make this again. I also, as a personal preference, tossed the blueberries with some of the flour mixture and mixed them into the batter instead of just the middle layer.

I made this with the extra milk and berries and it made the cake nice and moist which is how I prefer my cakes. You definitely don’t need all the topping and I recommend halving it. If you fold in the blueberries before putting the batter in the pan the berries spread out more. Overall a very good cake.

It was very good. Everyone loved it and was gone in one day.  I did add an extra egg yolk and 2 cups of blueberries and didn't use all the crumb topping.

Pretty darn tasty, but messed up the streusel topping so the bottom was hard to cut, and made a crumbly mess. Probably needed to NOT soften the butter

I put a little of the topping in the middle of the coffee cake, which made it a lot of fun.  I have made this twice now and both times I got rave reviews.  Just make sure to flour your bundt pan well!  This was truly delicious!  A real party pleaser!

This turned out well, I enjoyed it. The recipe is straightforward and I made no changes except to reduce the streusel topping a little, as other reviews suggested.

I followed this recipe without any modifications.  The coffee cake is dense, as I would expect for a coffee cake, but it is moist and flavorful.  I think adding more milk as others did will result in a lighter cake texture.  I guess it's an individual preference.
I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that there was too much streusel for the size of the cake and not enough blueberries.   I'll adjust next time.  
Also next time, I think I'd use something other than a Bundt pan because I didn't like the streusel on the bottom of the cake when it's unmolded.  Or maybe add the streusel in the middle with the blueberries. 
Overall this is a nice recipe for coffee cake.

The coffeecake was very good. I think regular sized berries would have been better than the jumbos I used because there would have been more of them.  My husband loved the struesel.

I made a few little changes. Since my daughter has Celiac, a wheat allergy, I used all purpose gluten free flour (Pillsbury). I doubled the recipe so I could use a 13x9 pan. I didn't have enough apples so I used some crushed up pineapple.  I let the batter sit in the fridge for an hour to help get rid of the horrible gritty taste from using gluten free flours. *a great tip when baking GF.   Adjusted cook time until done.   Very good!

Made this today and after reading other reviews, changed to buttermilk and since I was adding lemon juice to regular milk to make it, I went ahead and used a full cup to the batter. Worked great!  Very moist

I'd give it 5 stars with a few adjustments.  It can definitely use 2 cups of blueberries. I used 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of 1/2 cup milk for a protein boost. Recipe for crumbs makes too much.  I'll use about 3/4 of that next time.

We have 24 blueberry bushes, so lots of blueberries! I’m always looking for more blueberry recipes. This one was really good.. I did change a couple of things.
3/4 c. Buttermilk instead of 1/2 c milk
2 cups of blueberries sprinkled with a little flour  and mix with batter. (Instead of 1 cup of blueberries)
Also I divided the streusel in half & put 1/2 on 1/2 of the batter, add rest of batter and remaining streusel on top

This was outstanding.  My expert taster says it’s the best cake he’s ever had. I accidentally used baking soda instead of  powder, then added the powde too.  Still turned out great. The only intentional change i  made was reducing the sugar by about 25%. Wonderful!!

It was very tasty, but the streusel 'topping' (which inexplicably ended up on the bottom) was too hard and crunchy.

This is simple and yummy.  The topping ends up underneath unless you flip it over. I used frozen blueberries, and they stayed in the middle like filling. I liked it, good flavour. Kept well, the whole family loved it.

I read the reviews and adjusted to what everyone said: I cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups and put some streusel in the center.  What I got was a very dense, small bundt coffee cake and it wasn't very appetizing-looking.  The flavor was just ok.  I make coffee cakes every weekend and so I'm always looking for the winners.  There are much better recipes out there.  Won't make again.

Made this tonight ,following some other reviewers, added more blueberries which I folded into the batter, and added chopped pecans, only because I had them.  I did put some of the topping in the bottom of the bundt pan, ( that will be the top when You pop it out) duh. I did add some Greek yogurt 1/4 cup since it still looked dry, even when I added 3/4 cup of milk. 
Came out very moist.  Will definitely be making this again, over n over

It was very good and very easy to make. I may add slightly more blueberries next time I make it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. As other reviewers suggested, I increased the milk to 3/4 cup, and added a streusel layer on top of the blueberries as well as on the top of the cake. The cake is so moist and the topping adds a nice chewy crunch!  Will be adding this to our family brunches in the future!

I unfortunately didn't make any changes, though I thought I should through the whole process.  I followed it to the letter and it ended up in the trash dry and over brown from the overload of sugar, also stuck to the pan.  So I went to my cook's book and made one that came out perfectly.  It wasn't the baker, it was the recipe

I gave it 4 stars because I made minor changes...1) I lightly greased my bundt pan with butter and dusted it with flour. I saw some say that it stuck to their pan. After some cooling and a gentle loosening of the sides using the dull side of the knife, it popped right out!

It is good - as other cooks say it needs adjustments to be 5 star.  1st time baked per recipe. Next time will double blueberries, increase milk (it was crumbly and would not hold together), increase cinnamon. Will decrease topping and add Oats & a tiny bit of molasses or honey drizzle in middle. Still - it is good place to start & smells great!

I really love this recipe. I have made it 4 times in the last 2 weeks. Like others who have reviewed the recipe, I think there is too much streusel  topping. I add some to the middle layer, and still have leftover. I also add extra milk/cream to the recipe to make it easier to work with. I have been using huckleberries that I picked this summer and they make the cake amazing!!!

The cake tastes really nice, but I would make some changes next time.  I used all the streusel topping (against my instinct) and it was way too much - it turned into a crunchy hard layer that was near impossible to cut through. Also, the batter was a little dry so I will add some extra milk and fold the blueberries into the batter as others suggested. Tastes really great, just some basic changes to make it better.

Made it twice both times delicious  HOWEVER... both times (using 2 different bundt pans) it stuck terribly to the sides and I practically had to dig it out of the pan.  I sprayed one pan and the other I used vegetable oil and dusted with flour.
HELP any suggestions??

I am goiing to wish I added 3/4 of milk instead of 1/2 as the recipe calls for. I had hardly any batter (it looked more like dough) to spread over my berries. Also, It was very small in my bundt pan... I have just got it in the oven now; I am going to halve the cooking time and see how it turns out.

Used gluten free flour and a spring form pan. Didn't skimp on the topping, and I feel I could have added even more blueberries (used frozen) the rest of the family didn't want me to change a thing!

I used gluten free all purpose flour, Earth Balance spread and coconut sugar. Made it in a bunt pan. Came out yummy. When you put the topping on the top part of the bunt pan after flipping it onto a plate the bottom is crusty but good. I will definitely make this again. Had it for Christmas breakfast!

wow, this is good!!  and, a super-tolerant recipe too!  tolerant of all the changes I made because I was missing so many ingredients.  It tolerated brown sugar instead of white,  salted butter instead of unsalted (in the cake part), frozen blueberries instead of fresh, and STILL turned out beautifully.  I'm looking forward to trying it with the right ingredients :) Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this pretty much exactly the way it was stated.  I accidentally dumped about 1/2 a cup too many blueberries along with about 1/4 cup of the blueberry juice in there and just left it because the batter felt pretty thick with 1/2 a cup of milk - (I used half and half cuz that's what I had.) 
It felt like I had a TON of topping to put on the bundt cake, but when I took it out of the oven after 40 minutes it was fine.
I did have a difficult time getting the cake out of the bundt pan without it breaking up.  However, the cake was really very good, moist and delicious.
I will make this again but will butter and flour the pan, and will mix in half the crumble mixture along with the blueberries in the middle of the cake, then the rest on top of the cake and swirl it in.  I will try it in a 9x13 pan as well. 
My son said it was a little too "blueberryish", however he is currently on his third big piece and just asked if he could take  a piece to work tomorrow, so......I think that is a thumbs up!

This came out very well. Very moist and dense. I followed some of the reviewers advice and upped the milk to 1 cup because the batter was very thick and folded in the blueberries. The batter needs to be somewhat thick to support the berry juice but one cup of milk worked ok for me. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome coffee cake. I added 1 cup of  blueberries to the batter, in addition to the cup between layers. Added 1/2 cup rolled oats to streusel topping. Increased milk amount to 1 cup, I used whole milk. Note to self, lightly press streusel topping down into batter so cake holds it better when flipped over and cut into pieces.

Loved this recipe!  My topping kind of caramelized which made it hard and crunchy.  I will be adding peaches to the next iteration.

I made my first coffee cake using this recipe and it was great.  I I followed the exact recipe and felt it needed a little more moisture.  For the second time, I used a bit of canola oil and 1 1/2 cups of blueberries. Yum, yum.

Very good, but I've made a few changes to suit our family. 1) I use Buttermilk in place of regular milk. You need a little more of it, but it adds needed moistness. 2) I halve the topping amounts and still have more than enough. 3) I use frozen blueberries.

I made this for our church's card party - I made it in a 9x13" disposable pan - the batter was a little thick so the changes that I made were to increase the milk and added another egg - when the baking was finished the topping was a little bit hard - but everyone loved it - would make again

It was good.  I didn't have fresh blueberries on hand so I used frozen.  I think it would have been better if I had used fresh.  It wasn't as sweet as I had hoped it would be, but my boys liked it!

This was pretty easy to bake and everyone at work loved it!  I did add a little more milk because the dough was dry.  Next time I will add another cup of blueberries because I didn't feel there was enough, but the cake itself and texture, all delicious!!

Wonderful!  I substituted the milk with 2/3 C buttermilk and took the suggestion of another reader who divided the topping mixture into two and then pressed half in the bottom of the bunt pan.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.  I sprinkled the entire cake with powdered sugar.

Delicious cake and not difficult to make. I did as the reviewers suggested and added more milk. Also, the topping could easily be halved. I plan to make this cake again, but will use a loaf pan as it didn't fill my bundt pan.

No need to modify.  I made this recipe recently exactly as written, and it turned out very well.  Received many compliments, and it was devoured.  The batter was very thick so I wasn't sure how it would turn out, especially since I'm new to baking.  It couldn't have been better in the end.

Like many, I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions, increasing the milk to 3/4 cup from 1/2 and the blueberries (frozen) to 1 and a half from 1. The cake turned out just dense enough to be enjoyable, but I would add more blueberries next time.

This recipe is so delcious that my family has asked me to bake another one for the second night in a row!  
Since I didn't have any fresh strawberries on hand, I just used a cup of FROZEN wild blueberries (Wyamn's of Maine from Costco).  Turns out wonderful!

I made this for the first time last night and we really like the results.  I did alter the baking instructions because I wanted to use my mini bundt cake pan (6 minis, rather than 1 large).  I spooned some topping into the bottom of the mold, then layered the batter, the blueberies (I used frozen), then more batter and topping (to use it all up).  I baked the smaller sized bundts for 30 minutes and I think that might have been 5 minutes too long, but not bad for a first attempt at bundt cakes.  Having 1 now with my morning coffee ;)

This was a very good coffee cake.  I personally like lots of berries and a very moist cake so I double the berries and increased the milk to 3/4.  Since there was a lot of topping I added some to the middle to add more color.  Yum yum.  The people at work greatly enjoyed it.

I substituted sour cream instead of milk, and ended up adding about another 1/3 c of milk to make the batter a cake-like consistency.  I also added another half of a cup of blueberries.  next time i will def half the amount of topping, i think it was overpowering.  Overall a pretty good coffee cake.

Great recipe.  Like others, I increased the milk to 3/4 cup, baked in a springform pan, and sprinkled half of the topping over the berries before covering with the remaining batter.  Delicious and beautiful.

I tried this one and it's very delicious!! I had to make some more the next day. I doubled the recipe and used the regular pyrex cake pan 10"X15"for the double recipe, but I only use one recipe for the topping though. I took some to church and it was a hit.

Wow - This cake is just so good :D  I made this for my husband to take to work, but glad that I pinched a slice...  I am not a big fan of blueberries but even I enjoyed this, the cake was so light and fluffy, just loved the crunch of the streusel topping, added a great contrast.  I did make an extra half measure of the streusel which I sprinkled over the blueberries before adding the next layer of batter.  Will certainly use this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing Debbie.

Loved it.  Made a number of substitutions - mostly for organic alternatives.  Flour for whole-grain organic spelt, sugar for Sucanat (using 3/4 of original amount).  Butter and egg organic too.  Used 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries, mixing some in the mix, and using the rest as a middle layer.  Agree there's too much crumbly topping.  And agree that the topping is lovely halfway through.  Next time I'll make a third of it, and will again layer it.  Even with whole-grain spelt substituted, in one-for-one ratio to white flour, it was still amazingly moist and delicious.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

I thought the topping was too much for this cake. I would halve it next time. I folded the blueberries into the batter, and would do the same next time. Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated. I liked the taste of the cake, but the topping made it too sweet for my taste overall.

I was pretty pleased with the way this turned out. I used the blueberries that I had in the fridge that were about to go bad - I wanted to put them to use. I did what someone else suggested and put the struesel topping in the bottom of the bundt pan so it would show when I turned the cake out. I also added walnuts to the struesel mix and didn't make as much of the struesel as the recipe called for. My husband actually made the wonderful suggestion to add a cream cheese layer in the middle - smart man! I will do that next time I make it. Also, this cake tastes a lot better the next day after it has sat out covered on a cake plate.

You must double this recipe if you are using a bundt pan, or you won't have enough batter.  We substituted 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour.  Turned out really well.

I have made this cake a couple of different times.  It is great, my family loves it.  However the last time I didn't have blueberries, but I did have a can of peach pie filling.  Wow!  It was super, I put it in the middle just like you do the blueberries. The cake was gone in one day along with lots of request to make it again.  It wasn't as pretty as the blueberries, but it was great!

I made this for Mother's Day and all the moms loved it. I used 3/4cup of milk and I mixed some berries into the mixture and then but the rest in the middle with the stressel. I will continue to use this and may even try cherries and blackberries.

This was amazing!  I took some previous suggestions and raised the amount of milk to 3/4 cup.  It did need it.  Other than that, I made it as is and was very happy with it.  I think next time I might add more blueberries to the mix because I really liked the way they baked into it.  I didn't think this was too sweet at all.  It tasted just how I personally remember coffee cakes that my mother and grandmother made growing up.  Yum!

Yummy!!!  Was a huge hit for Mother's Day brunch. Followed recipe exactly except for increasing milk to 3/4 cup and added some streusel to middle with blueberries. Came out very moist and perfectly sweet! Definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

I tried this recipe this past weekend & followed it exactly. It's good, but most everyone that tried it agreed that there is way too much sugar. I would suggest 1/2 cup of brown sugar & only 1/2 a cup white sugar because it bakes through the batter & the brown sugar can be very overpowering, 3/4 cup of blueberries is enough if using a Bundt pan because the blueberries bake and fall through to the bottom & kind of make a mess anyways. Also for the topping 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour is enough & you'll still may have some topping left over. Other than that this is really delicious all nice and warmed for breakfast.

This was really good!  Made a slightly healthier version.  Halved the sugar, used 1/4c butter, 1/4c lowfat sour cream, skim milk (about 1 cup). Half of topping recipe. Time came to add the blueberries and mine were too old.  So I put 1/2 batter, 1/2 topping, rest of batter, rest of topping.  Delightful non-blueberry coffee cake!  You won't miss the extra sugar or fat!  (you might miss the blueberries! -I didn't)

I love this cake.  I followed a couple other reviewers by increasing the milk to 1 cup and by adding the blueberries in the batter.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It is very light and tasty.

I thought this turned out pretty good, considering my modifications. In an effort to reduce the calories a wee bit, I halved the sugar (to 1/2 c), the salt (to 1/4 tsp) and the butter (to 1/4 c). I added 1/4 c nonfat plain yogurt to the batter to make up for the butter. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I also halved the streusel ingredients, used 3/4 c milk, 1.5 c flour, and 1.5 c blueberries. I layered the streusel as suggested, but for some reason, the middle layer completely disappeared! I could not taste it at all. I think next time, I'll make more streusel to have more for the middle and top. Overall, the cake tasted great and my bf had no idea that I basically cut the calories in half. The blueberries had a nice strong flavor and the cake was soft and moist. I baked this in an 8x8 pan for a little over 50 minutes. Thanks!

The topping on this coffee take makes it absolutely wonderful!! I would not change a thing! If you don't have fresh blueberries, frozen work great...just make sure they are thawed out. I increased the amount of blueberries to 1 1/2 cups. I think I will take the advice of other reviewers and increase the milk to 3/4 cup next time just for little bit of a thinner batte. Very good and definitely best when warm!

Much like blueberry muffins, only in a cake.  It's very, very good.  It's so good that my brunch guests actually asked if they could take home the leftovers AND have a copy of the recipe.  I'll happily serve this again.  Like some other reviewers, I decreased the flour to 1 1/2 C and used 2 C of blueberries.  But, the best part was adding half of the topping  on top of the blueberries in the middle of the cake.  I served it warm, and the topping in the middle tasted almost like caramel.

easy recipe but i always some difficulty with the streussel topping, maybe i do something wrong, a part of it sank a little bit. Hope to get it right next time. The flavor of the cake was amazing, a little similar to muffin dough.

FANTASTIC!!!
I thought I had blueberries, but didn't so I used chopped pecans. I put some of the strudel in the middle.

I think this is the best coffee cake recipe I've ever tried.

This was very good! I didn't want to make a huge cake, so I halved the recipe and it still turned out wonderfully.  I followed others' advice though and added more milk (1/4 + 1/8 c. total for half recipe) and used less flour (3/4 cup for half recipe).  I baked the cake in an 8x8 pan at 350 for about 40 minutes. yum!

Instead of using a bundt pan, I opted for a 9 inch spring foam pan. And as other reviewers suggested, halfed the streusel recipe and used 3/4 cups of milk. My streusel didn't turn out "crumbly" initially (despite the fact I used stick butter), so I added a little more flour and brown sugar till it was. The streusel was a little crunchy but worked great with the softness of the cake.  Also, used frozen blackberries instead and it turned out wonderful. Will make again!

I even fudged this a bit, reducing the sugar (and I only had ~1/2 cup of brown so I substituted) and used thawed peaches but it turned out delicious.  I'd do less topping next time and add poppy seeds for fun.  Tasty and wonderfully moist!

This was a moist and yummy coffee cake. However I did use blackberries instead since I have two blackberry loving pickers who can' stop. The top of this cake was by far the best part. The brown sugar mix was great. I will keep this recipe.

I made this coffee cake and brought it to a dinner party, and everyone really enjoyed it.  I had some problems with the butter because i used whipped instead of stick butter so i just ended up using a lot more butter than planned.  I also think i cooked it a little too long because the topping got pretty hard and it was kinda of hard to eat, but still it was delicious none the less.  Would definitely make this again but cut the cooking time from an hour to about 50-45 minutes.

This was yummy - but I did make the modifications suggested in the other reviews.  I used two eggs, 3/4 cup buttermilk & halved the streusel topping.  I baked it in a 9" springform pan for 55 minutes on 350 and probably would go a little less next time as the outer later was a little harder than I expected.

OK, this was good but not pretty!  Maybe I did something wrong, but the topping all sank to the bottom (which I expected) and was just goo.  It was certainly not crumbly.  So I had to scrape it out of the bottom of the pan and "paste" it to the top of the cake, which did not really have a real top.  It tasted good, but is not something I'd make on a regular basis.  I followed the advice of others and used 2 eggs, 3/4 cups of milk, only 1 1/2 cups of flour and an extra cup of blueberries, folded into the batter.

Fantastic--only changes were to add a little more milk into the batter and double up the strudel.

This was really good. I used cream instead of milk (since it was all I had) and increased it to 3/4 cup. I also used 2 eggs instead of 1, and baked for 50 minutes. I found it to be moist this way. My only complaint is that I didn't really like the topping on the bottom of the cake because it was kind of messy and loose and I lost a lot of it on the serving platter. It might be better to make this in a different pan so that the topping can be on "top".

I love this cake. Instead of baking it in a bundt pan, I bake it in a baking dish for the same amount of time. Also, I mix the blueberries into the batter, then spread in pan.

I have never made a cake from scratch. I  am a box cake junkie. This cake was fun and easy to make. I did use just over 1 cup milk, about 1 1/4 and also some sour cream about 1/2 cup. I used a bunt pan it was perfect. I forgot to pyt the streusel on the bottom it was still pretty. Topped with powdered sugar. My family was leary of the blueberry as they are very picky. I can only say that this was a hit!!!

Wow this was terrific!  I don't usually purchase fresh blueberries as I don't care for them but I had  to find something to do with all of those that my daughters picked at the Blueberry Patch and this was definitely the route to go.  I took it to a potluck brunch and received so many requests for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this recipe exactly as written; it was wonderful!  The only thing I may do differently next time is to put half of the streusel on the bottom of the bundt so that when I invert it, there will be topping for the cake.  One of these days, I'm going to make this using a raspberry filling and a chocolate streusel.  Drizzled with chocolate syrup, I bet it'll be one terrific dessert!  Thanks for an outstanding recipe.

I made this for a bake sale and it sold out!  Everyone loved it.  I didn't measure the blueberries so I probably used more than 1 cup and I ended up not using all of the topping.  It might be better if you layer some of the topping with the batter and blueberries.  It was definitely a big hit!

Great recipe. I just had a piece hot out of the oven.  I took advice from others and used 9" springform pan and added an extra 1/4 cup of heavy cream for some more liquid. Very moist.  For the topping I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and it's delicious.  If you don't have a sweet tooth lessen the sugar in both the cake and topping. Def add more berries as well!  Can't wait to have more for breakfast.

I used some previously fresh/now frozen peaches that I had in the freezer instead of the blueberries.  I also altered the recipe as per a few of the reviews that I read by decreasing the sugar and increasing the milk in the batter and by putting 1/2 of the streusel on top of the peaches and the other half on the top of the batter. My family enjoyed this recipe.

Good recipe. I made the following adjustments. Used 3/4 cup buttermilk instead of 1/2 cup milk, mixed 1 cup blueberries into batter, but next time will use 1-1/2 or two cups!!!, put 3/4 of the "topping" into the middle, then added the remaining batter. Will make again!!

I made this coffee cake thinking that it would be like all the others I made previously.  However, with the addition of sour cream into this recipe, there was a difference in the  taste as it was a bit more decadent when the finished product came out of the oven.  I added a bit more blueberries to the mixture.  It was a hit at my husban'd office!  I'm making it for the fourth of July!

This is delicious!  I made it in a 13x9 glass dish because I don't have a bundt pan. I got nervous because it seemed like I didn't have enough batter to fill the pan on the bottem layer (we kinda "glopped" it in) but when it baked, it puffed up beautifully and filled the pan.  Like others, I used 3/4 c whole milk and about 1 1/4 c blueberries (would've used more had I had them).  The streusel didn't come out crumbly, it stuck together so may use a different streusel recipe next time.  Also put that in the middle "over" the blueberries.  

A note to those in HIGH ALTITUDES (as I am): the cake filled the pan during baking so don't panic when it looks scant during assembly.  I baked it for approximately 35 min's at 350 and then reduced the temp to 325 so that it wouldn't burn for the remaining bake time.  Would probably bake at 325 for the full bake time next time.  

All in all, a great recipe to have on hand!

I got quite a chuckle over the lady who submitted a review on June 5/05.   I have this cake in the oven now so am not sure how it will turn out.  I think you need to add 2 eggs instead of one because the batter is too dry when putting it in the pan.  Way too much brown sugar mixture for the top of the cake so I added half over the blueberries in the middle of the cake.  I sure hope it turns out. It smells good anyway!!!

Great recipe. For my oven 60 minutes was a little to long. It was easy to follow, and turned out great exept it was a little to dark, but it's my fault.

Absolute decadence! I used 3/4 c buttermilk in lieu of 1/2c  milk. I also used an apple instead of blueberries. Unbelievable!

My cake did not turn out as moist as I expected, but I still received many, many compliements on it. I have this in my recipe book, but I'm not sure if it will remain a family favorite. The batter was devine, though...

This was very delicious.  I followed a couple of other people's ideas and added some of the streusel topping into the mixture as it was a bit much to put all on top.  I also used a circluar cake pan as I didn't have a bundt pan.  It turned out wonderfully!  This is one to keep!

This was good, but much like a blueberry muffin (maybe that's the point?)  My butter was too soft when I made the streusel, so it ended up coming out like a grainy paste (didn't matter after cooking, though.)  I also was too excited when this was finished and attempted to remove it from the bundt pan before it completely cooled and I ended up with a blueberry "crumble" - oops!  Would  make it again.

Pretty good.  The topping mostly fell to the sides leaving a big, hard chunk.  Next time I'll try placing half the topping with the blueberry layer.

I subbed buttermilk for the milk. 3/4c (The cake part is soooooooo moist and yummy. I think I'll use it as a base for many things!
I baked it in a 9" square. Put about 2/3 of the batter down. Then 1 1/2 c of fresh blueberries, then half the streusel, then the rest of the batter and may a 1/4 of the streusel. (The last 1/4 I popped into the freezer for using on something else later.)After it came out, I drizzled it with a milk, powdered sugar and Almond Extract glaze.
It was a hit!

This recipe is AMAZING! I made this recipe twice and my dad even loved it and he is usually SO picky. I made one especially for my mom to bring to work and her coworkers called me just to tell me how much they loved it and requested for another one. I used 3/4 a cup of milk also like the others.

I have tried many recipes from this site with great results but this has been my favorite so far!  I substituted 1 1/2 cups fresh chopped strawberries instead of the blueberries. It was a big hit with vanilla ice cream on top. Yum.

This was a super-easy recipe! I scaled the recipe to make enough coffee cake for over 250 people and it worked out perfectly! This will be one recipe we add to our recipe box at work. Whenever Coffee Cake is on the menu this will be the recipe I turn to, the blueberries are what does it!

This is a great recipe!  Everyone at the office loved it.  Thanks to suggestions of others, I made the following changes:  doubled cake recipe for Bundt pan, used buttermilk instead of regular milk used more milk (used 1.5 cups for doubled recipe).  I put 1/3 of the streusel on top of cake but would use more next time.  I used 1/3 with the fresh blueberries and saved the other 1/3 for muffins.  Will make this one again!

Wonderful!!  I doubled the recipe as suggested in other reviews to make a higher coffee cake and put some of the streusel topping in with the fruit layer.  Can't tell u how yummy this one was.  Will be making this many times in the future!

I made this for my boyfriend and served it to him as a morning birthday cake.  We both agreed it was delicious!!  I made it the night before serving it, and it was still very moist, and the topping was very sweet and crisp.

This is fantastic!  At first I thought there wasn't enough batter, but it puffed up beautifully and was oh soooo yummy!!!

I made this for my coworkers and it was gone in minutes. I recieved several compliments as well as several requests for the recipe. I did add about a 1/2 cup more milk than the recipe called for and it was perfectly moist and delicious.

Very good recipe.  My family liked it and they usually are not crazy about blueberries.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the batter tastes a little too much like flour.  The thick crumb topping was good.

I made this coffee cake last night and it was fabulous.  My husband and I loved it.  It was so moist and the blueberries tasted so good.  I will definitely hold onto this recipe and make it again.  Thanks!!

This cake has a wonderful texture, and the streusel is just the right finishing touch.

In the words of my 15 year old cousin, "That's the best cake I've ever had!" "Even better than Grandmother's."
Trust me... quite a compliment. :-)
