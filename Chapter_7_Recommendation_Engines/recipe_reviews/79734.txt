i did some major tweaking based on past comments and here's what my family loved:  1 box chicken flavored stuffing mix instead of plain, 1 can cream of chicken and herb soup, 1 can broth and 1 container sour cream, instead of cream of celery.  i deleted garlic and salt since stuffing mix was seasoned. rest stayed the same.  i also served with a gravy and broth sauce on the side for adults.  kids loved them plain.  wil definitely make this combination again.

This dish went together so quickly and neatly when I grabbed my cookie scoop (like a small ice cream scoop...like a healping Tbls. worth) to fill the cooked pasta shells! I did try adding white wine in place of some of the broth as a reader suggested but it simply didn't help us like the flavor of the canned soup 'gravy'...next time I'll use 1 can of condensed soup and 2 cups of prepared chicken/turkey gravy to. I used 1 large can of chicken from Costco and a large can of turkey meat from Trader Joe's in place of the whole chicken called for. This recipe made so much that I've frozen one casserole (18 stuffed shells) prepped up to the point of baking it. ::crossing fingers:: that it will thaw/bake up nicely when I pull it out for a future meal.

I didn't make this recipe but I wanted to add what I do with mine that are very similar.  I add 1 cup Miracle Whip and a couple handfuls cheddar cheese to the stuffing and chicken mixture.  And I don't make that mixture of soups on the stove.  I just spread 1 can condensed cream of chicken on top and 1 can on top of the shells once you line the pan with them.  You may need to add a couple tbsp. water.  The Miracle Whip gives it a delicious tang.

These shells are awesome!!  The only thing negative I can say is that it took me a lot longer than 20 minutes to prepare.  But once they are made - YUM!!  I used a can of cream of celery, a can of cream of chicken, a can of broth and a can of Campbells prepared chicken gravy.  This would be a great way to use Thanksgiving or Christmas left overs.

I halved this recipe for 18 shells, used only cream of celery soup with the chicken broth, added garlic powder & pepper.  I also added a small can of mushrooms to the "sauce".  There's only one thing I think this needs to make it really great ... replace 1/2 cup of broth with a dry white wine.  These came out excellent and I was delighted with the (mushroom) gravy texture after cooking.  Oh, and I used boneless, skinless chicken breast meat diced small.  Thanks Jooney!  Great idea.  Finally!  A great way to stuff shells without a ton of cheese (for a nice change).

I made this recipe for dinner tonight.  Going by the VERY mixed reviews, I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, because I accidentally bought the wrong one when I went to the grocery store. Duh!  We really liked it!  I served the shells with steamed broccoli.  Everyone went back for seconds.  I used Stove Top whole wheat stuffing mix for chicken.  It added a nice sage taste to the filling.  I had a family pack of chicken thighs, so that is what I used. I put them in the oven, covered, while I went to the grocery store and they were done when I returned.  I chopped up the all meat after it cooled, then I put the filling together.  If I had been thinking, I would have used the broth from the chicken pan for the gravy, but I had already used the Swanson's that I bought before I thought of it.  I added 1 t. garlic powder but no additional salt and pepper. The soups, broth and stuffing mix all have PLENTY of salt.  I will definitely make this again.

The soup did not do anything for this besides make it bad.  This was a big waste of my time and money.  Only way I'd make this again....well actually I would not make it again.

I loved this recipe, was something very different for my family. I used a rotisserie chicken to cut down on prep and used jared Alfredo sauce. In reading some of the reviews I think I would use some Parmesan or Mozarella Cheese in the stuffing next time and two jars of Alfredo to give it a lot of sauce.

This recipe was absolutely awesome!  I "tweaked" it just a lil by adding an Italian Seasoning and some 4-blend type cheese and no Cream/Celery soup.  There is another VERY SIMILAR recipe listed that I sort of combined them both to make a "sauce" wanting to make a creamy tomato sauce, which it honestly did NOT even NEED!!  It was just a wee bit salty, but easily fixed with less Chic stock and NO ADDED seasonings (which I ALWAYS do)...also added FRESH garlic too.  The "sauce" was VERY PRETTY on the bottom of the plate and hubby even said it looked and tasted like Restaurant/Food TV style food!!  A+++++++++ in my book!  Was looking for something DIFFERENT to do with the larger pasta shells and WILL definitely make again!  Thank you :)  GREAT RECIPE!

The presentation was nice. It looked like something you spent hours on. The taste was not so good. I could not eat it but my 7 year old daughter ate all of hers and said it was good. I will not be making this again.

I don't really understand the bad reviews on this recipe. We thought it was fantastic and tasted like a quick version of Thanksgiving dinner. Paired well with other Thanksgiving like dishes too. It was a nice change from our usual. Did as another reviewer suggested and used only 1 can broth and replaced cream of celery for sour cream. Will be keeping this recipe! Thanks!

It was okay. Of course I had to add cheese and some other spices because it seemed bland to me. Just seemed like alot of effort for something that was just okay.

This turned out pretty good! I sauted chicken tenders in olive oil with herbs and shredded it. Also used cornbread dressing which was yummy. The soup was alittle overpowering over it all but next time I just won't add as much.

made my stuffing from scratch with torn bread, sauteed celery and onion fresh sage time and oregano and salt and pepper then baked 30min greased dish in foil. The rest was made as stated and turned out great. Will make again (making the stuffing made it not as salty but great flavour)

I made this recipe.  It was mediocre at best.   Being  from New Orleans, known for its "tasty cusine" this dish left a lot to be desired.  Very bland.  Very disappointed.

These tasted good, but seemed to be missing something - cheese, maybe? Still, they were very rich and filling. They weren't all that pretty to look at. I served them with sauteed green beans.

A friend brought this to our family in the midst of a family crisis.  What an AMAZING dish...NEVER would have put these ingredients together but wowza!!  She served it with a alfredo/rosa like sauce in place of the "cream" soups (not her favorite) but how splendid no less!!!!!!!!!

This dish was a HUGE HIT in my house.  I had to slightly modify the recipe based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I did not have cream of celery soup, so I used cream of mushroom instead. This paired well with the cream of chicken soup.  Also, I prefer to make my own chicken broth, so I boiled my chicken (chicken legs and chicken breasts) and used about two cups of homemade chicken broth.  I was scared the dish would be too salty, but it actually was not too salty.  I used store brand corn bread dressing mix and I think this was an excellent choice.  For the end product, the sauce was extremely creamy and attractive.  This dish was a lot of work like other reviewers stated, but in my case, it was WELL worth the effort.

I have prepared this dish twice already.  My husband really likes it for breakfast instead of dinner because of the protein and carbs.  I can’t seem to find the big shells, so I use manicotti—which is a bit difficult to stuff!   When I bought the ingredients, I bought two cans of the chicken broth but ended up using only one can.  I thought that the soup mixture would have been too runny and I wanted the mixture to be more of a gravy.  I also added a bit of the gravy to the stuffing and chicken before I stuffed the manicotti.  I put the rest of the gravy on top before it goes in the oven.

 I also did not add salt or garlic powder.

This recipe reheats fine.

This recipe is unbelievably bland.  Although the prep was easy, the results didn't warrant the time it took to make it.  My husband and toddler only ate 2 shells each; the rest went down cheerful chewy (garbage disposal).

Yum!I did use chicken breast instead of whole chicken. A little messy to fill shells, but well worth it. Family loved it!

I made a few changes. I used Savory Herb Stuffing and added chopped onion to the stuffing; other than that I followed the recipie.   I did not like the canned soups in this at all. I will try making this dish one more time but will use an alfredo sauce on top and see if that makes this dish good.   I probably won't make this dish again unless the alfredo topping makes a huge difference. It's not bad as is but I thought it was on the boring side.

Giving this 4 stars because I had to make some changes due to some bland flavors in here.  Once I made the changes it was a HUGE hit and we all loved it.  I added mozzarella cheese to the chicken and stuffing mix and instead of the canned soups I poured alfredo sauce over it all.  This recipe made so much though that I was able to put half in the freezer for another night.  Only downside to that was I guess it needed to thaw before putting back in the oven because I had to cook it long enough to warm it all and so some of the bottom of the shells got hard the second time, but other than that, it was excellent the second time as well.

This was a good recipe but was more work than it was worth.  A lot of preparation for a very simplistic "chicken pot pie" tasting dish.

my husband gave this five stars before I even asked him what he thought of dinner. I filled one soup can with milk and the other with water as I did not have broth. I added a chicken b cube and some onion powder. This was a time consuming meal, but a very tasty one.

My filling turned out dry and the sauce seemed to taste pretty bland, but I love the idea and am looking for ways I could improve on this recipe.  Thanks for a great start.

These were good.  A few reviewers mentioned too much sauce, but I disagree.  I thought it had just enough.  Add a sprig of parsley to the top of the shells to make it look more presentable.  Not the quicket recipe, but it made a lot and we had it as leftovers.

This was ok.  My husband said that it tasted like a regular chicken casserole and I agree.  I liked it, but he said that it was only a step above Hamburger Helper (which I am banned from cooking).

Finally, a stuffed shells recipe WITHOUT cheese!
Excellent recipe. I only had one can of chicken broth and that was fine. I used a can of tyson chicken (12oz) instead of a whole chicken and it was fine. Loved in and will definately make again. Thanks!
