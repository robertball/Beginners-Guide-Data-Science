I submitted this recipe.  Please do not let the pie cool after cooking the rhubarb for 15 minutes. Add the cream cheese filling to hot rhubarb mixture and return to the reduced temperature oven and finish cooking. Enjoy!

Delicious! Very easy to make, 3 cups of chopped rhubarb seemed to be too much for my 9" deep dish pie shell, though -- so I made 2 pies using about 5 cups. Took it to a family get-together and everyone loved it. Even Grandma thought it was "very good", which is a tough compliment to come by! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this yesterday. It was alright but I made the mistake of using a premade graham cracker crust & with just the rhubarb in it at 400* it burnt the top edge...not a pretty sight! Will try again a homemade pastry crust.

FANTASTIC!!! I couldn't imagine rhubarb with cheesecake but I was feeling adventurous and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did! I've never cooked with rhubarb before and didn't buy enough so I ended up with 2 cups rather than 3, but since I used a frozen pie crust it seemed to be a perfect amount. I left all of the rest of the ingredient amounts the same. It turned out great.. the sugar mixed with the rhubarb creates a nice layer on the crust for an extra sweet touch. I've since made this using frozen blackberries and it was equally good. In fact, my bf said to try it with frozen peach slices next time. It's a versatile recipe that I'll use over and over.. thank you!

Even people that do not like rhubarb LOVE this pie! Thank you for posting this great recipe, I found it in Woman's Day in 1964, lost the recipe after trying it. I'm so happy to locate this flavorful pie recipe again. Everyone should try it!

I thought this was very unusual tasting. I don't like rhubarb, but I liked this. Much better the longer it was refrigerated.  I'm not 100% crazy about the sour cream topping, but still thoroughly enjoyed it and my husband and kids liked it too.

What an unexpected surprise!  Just one hint: cover outside edges of pie crust with foil before baking to prevent darkened / burst crust.  This was very, very good.  I followed the directions exactly with the addendum of pouring cream cheese mixture over the baked rhubarb while still hot.

This was a great cheesecake, althought we needed to add more rhubarb. I will make it again, this time I will add more rhubarb. Delicious!

What a nice combination of flavors, the tartness of the rhubarb, the smoothness of the cheesecake.  I added strawberries to the rhubarb too, and it just disappeared at my house in no time.  Big hit!

This is absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again. I did have one issue though ... when I baked the crust with just the rhubarb in it, the sides of the crust started to cave in / slide down. I was able to push them back up (very gently) before adding the cream cheese layer but next time I will probably par-bake the crust first using the "blind-bake" method.

WOW! this is wonderful. I'm surprised theres no picture because it looks absolutely beautiful. My sister claims to dislike rhubarb AND cheesecake and she LOVES this pie! I used neufchatel instead of cream cheese and whipped it at high speed for 2 min. I would liken it to custard rather than cheesecake.YUM!

This is really good.  I had a bumper crop of rhubarb and was searching for something new to use it with.  I used 4 cups of rhubarb in a 9" plate with same amount of sugar.  Everyone loved it -

I made this one and the "rhubarb cheesecake" on this site with a shortbread crust, and the other was MUCH better. Be sure to add some chopped pecans or walnuts when making the crust.

If you love rhubarb this is for you.  But I would cook the rhubarb a bit longer, even before adding it to the crust if necessary.  It was a little bit crunchy.

I followed the recipe as published, but used a graham cracker ready made crust. Reading some of the other comments, I decided to wrap the exposed part of the crust with aluminum foil for the first step. It didn't burn the crust at all. Rhubarb still had a slight crunch to it in the end, but it still was very delicious.

I love this Rhubarb Cheesecake.  I have made over twenty of these cakes in the the past two years.  All of our friends request that I bring one for dessert.  They freeze extremely well too.  I'd give this recipe 10 stars if that was possible.  Thank you so very much for sharing it.

I followed the recipe without modifications, and  we were all underwhelmed. It's a solid 3 recipe, not really worth the calories. I was unhappy that I'd served it to company. I'm not sure if it can be improved.... I certainly won't try. I'll be using my tried and true recipes, as this one don't be joining their ranks.

I have prepared this cheesecake twice now to rave reviews!  I doubled the recipe once for a picnic and put it a 9x13" pan for ease of travel and serving.  It came out just as good as the single recipe.  I did add some vanilla to the cream cheese layer also. I use an olive oil crust which is a little lighter than a traditional crust made with Crisco.

Have made this many times due to requests for it. A favorite among friends and family.  I do not cool the rhubarb layer prior to adding the cream cheese mixture. I normally double the filling ingredients to make it in a 9 x 13 pan.

It was a hit! I like mine a bit more tart, so I will try cutting the first 1/2 cup of sugar back to 1/3.  Maybe it won't be as big of a hit and I will be having more than one piece!

I always make rhubarb custard pie and was looking for something different.  My family just loved it.  This is a keeper.

This is wonderful, everyone loved it! I do have a question, can it be made then frozen? I'd love to make it for an event coming up & didn't think frozen rhubarb would work...any suggestions? Thank you!
