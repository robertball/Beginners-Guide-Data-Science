This is a delicious recipe. I have had a slightly more complex version that is also layered with pignoli nuts and sun-dried tomatoes, along with the pesto layers. It is then topped with thinly sliced provolone. It produces a red white and green layer effect like the Italian flag! When you turn the torte out of whatever receptacle you've molded it in (I've had it in a small round cake shape) stick herbs such as fresh minced chives, and basil to the sides (it will stick to the cream cheese). 
This has been served at our company functions several times...it is very elegant if done right. And it is seriously good!

To make it even simpler, I used one block of cream cheese, cutting a zig zag pattern through the middle, reversed the two pieces to create a Christmas tree.  Topped with pesto, and smaller pieces of the red peppers in rows looking like lights.  Then a friend broke a Triscuit cracker in half to make the trunk.  Looked great and tasted even better.

Prepared this and numerous other recipes from this site  for a 50th wedding anniversary party. Everyone asked who catered the party!!! Very easy to make and can be prepared a cday or two ahead of time, whioch is awsome, I added 2 pieces of provolone cheese to the top then added the peppers, chopped fine, pretty presentation! Thanks for sharing.
I have a suggestion: when reviewing or even sending in a recipe please state how far in advance it can be made, or if it can be frozen, when you are having a large party this information is SO HELPFUL!!!!!

Excellent Italian spread! Amazing flavor! I made this for a friend's Italian-themed birthday party and made these minor adjustments: I put the drained peppers in a small food chopper and chopped them finely. Then after flattening each slice of cream cheese, I layered first the cream cheese, then pesto, then cream cheese, then peppers, until all were used up, ending with peppers on top. 
(You will also want to drain the pesto on a paper towel first because otherwise the oil comes out after sitting for a while)

Five stars for an easy, impressive appetizer. I halved the recipe for a group of 6 - I did have other appetizers also, and it was plenty. I cut my cream cheese in half and shaped each square into a flat round shape. Chopped & dried my red peppers on a paper towel. On the finished product, I pressed chopped green onions around the sides. Lovely. Next time I may try seasoning the cream cheese with some garlic? Served with water crackers.

Good flavor but very oily so when I took it out of the form it just fell into a big lump.  I may try it again but I will have to think of a different way

I made this as a app. for an Itilian dinner at my home. I doubled the cream cheese and added extra layers of the chopped drained red peppers. You must drain your pesto or you will end up with an oily mess!!!  I used a bread loaf pan as my mold, it came out perfect.  I served 20 people and had plenty, plus several request for the recipe. Thanks for a great, easy idea!

This was a wonderful appetizer.  After slicing the cream cheese, I just smashed the slices to the correct size w/my hands and that worked better than the plastic wrap.  Next time I would also slize the peppers rather than laying them whole on the cream cheese.  But this was a hit.

I must say....this was a HUGE hit at bunco tonight.  I used a round bowl rather than loaf pan as my mold and included the roasted bell peppers in the layering process.  The presentation was beautiful and the taste was exceptional.

Made this for a holiday party yesterday.  I did drain the pesto which I purchased in the refrigerated deli section of the store.  Also drained the Sun Dried tomatoes I diced and put on top.  There was a lot of food at the party but everyone who tried this loved it.  I would probably be a bit more careful layering it next time and maybe try it with the roasted peppers as well.

Fantastic... I changed a main ingredient though - I prefer to use diced sun dried tomatoes (in oil, drained) in place of the red peppers.  I also top with shredded parmesan cheese.

Wow! This was so good. I am practicing recipes in preperation of throwing a baby shower so I tested the Pesto Torta on my friends last weekend. I can't explain how addicting it is. We used crostini, sesame crackers, and when we ran out of those resorted to using pieces of corn tortilla to dip into it. I actually finished off the last few tablespoons of it by just eating it by itself. It's excellent. I used a jar of sliced red and yellow roasted bell peppers from Trader Joes but next time I'll buy 2 jars because the pesto took over all of the flavors (which I'm not complaining about at all :)

I've made this recipe for two groups, and it was a great success.  I cut up the red peppers, and put some in each layer, and a heavy layer right on top.  It makes a very nice presentation, surrounded by sliced Italian bread.  I used my own homemade pesto, which I think adds a great deal.

I have made this several times for parties and I NEVER have any left over! People always ask for the recipe and are amazed at how easy it is. I tell them, "If you can stack things, you can make this recipe." I use a 5" diameter springform pan and (as suggested by another reviewer) I slice the cream cheese and form it into a patty shape to fit the pan.

This was so easy and so delicious!  I used a smaller au gratin pan and put one package of cream cheesethen spread the pesto, then spread the chopped roasted peppers (I used Trader Joe's prepared pesto and their yellow and red roasted peppers).  Then one more package of creamcheese.  I didn't drain the pesto and probably could have let the peppers drain a little more but it was fine.  The oil from both definitely seeped into the torta but it wasn't runny.  It actually added to the spread.  Will definitely make again.

This is soooo good and easy to make.  I do substitute sun dried tomato paste for the red bell pepper paste.  

I like serving it with the miniature bread slices as pictured.  My 2 stepkids, myself and my husband can eat this whole thing in about 10 minutes.

Super easy and quick!  I took this to a lunch at work and it ended up being the most talked about item there.  I also diced the peppers to make them easier to eat.  Will absolutely make again.

Took this to a baby shower and received many compliments. Used fresh pesto and roasted my own peppers. I molded it into a mini-bunt pan, which produced a beautiful finished product. If I do make this again, I'll definately dice the peppers to make for easier scooping onto the crackers! Thanks :-)

This was great!!! And so easy!! I've made it several times and have gotten many compliments. In fact, just the other night, an Italian friend raved and raved about it and wanted the recipe! I did try the layer thing and I wasn't very successful so I've just been using one layer. It's work just fine. Also I agree "Thanks for the tip about cutting up the peppers"

This was very good.  I served it at a small gathering and it went over very well.  I chopped the peppers to make it easier to serve.  I think that sun dried tomatoes (as someone else suggested) would be a great addition.  I will definitely make again.

I made this for a dinner party and my friends were so impressed.  It looks like it came from a gourmet food market and tastes even better than it looked.  This was the first thing to go at the table.
