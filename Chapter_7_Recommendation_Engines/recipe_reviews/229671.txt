I loved this recipe! The vinegar balances out a bit of the sweetness and vanilla really compliments the carrots. I have made this 2 times and the 4 of us who tried this thought they were great tasting carrots!

I really enjoyed this.  I ended up using regular carrots instead of baby since that is what I had on hand.  I am not a huge fan of cooked carrots so I didn't steam them very long.  Overall it was a very easy, delicious recipe.

Simple to make with ingredients that are usually on-hand. Even my daughter who is not a big fan of carrots enjoyed it.

It was alright, but didn't end up as good as I would've liked. Could be due to my cooking skills, but it's not quite my taste for carrots. Still was worth trying.

I just made these for my job, and they were a HIT! Everybody loved them. The only thing I did different was I used whole carrots and cut them into pieces, and boiled them in water for about 15 mins, appose to steaming them (my carrots seemed a little hard). Great, quick recipe for any meal addition. Highly recommend.

I made this recipe because I had planned to have candied carrots for dinner but we were out of brown sugar. The only change I made was used regular carrots.  These were good however, my family prefers my other 2 carrot recipes(1 w/brown sugar, 1 with apple juice) more. My 7 yr old that likes everything didn't eat these, but my picky 12 yr old did. This is a good backup recipe but I think I will stick to my other recipes.

Came across this recipe after returnng home after a trip to only a bag of baby carrots in the produce drawer! Otherwise, I might not have looked for a carrot recipe but glad I did. Easy and we both thought they were good. Used the steamer insert but took 15-20 min til tender. Thanks for sharing this.

This is a great recipe. Next time I make it, I'll cut down on the vanilla a bit, to suit my taste. Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor was surprisingly light and not too sweet. The vinegar really makes a difference. I omitted the black pepper.

We loved this recipe! I used sweet potatoes instead of carrots because we grow our own and have lots of them. So glad to find another way to use them up! Thanks V. Renee Lord!

Very good recipe.  Needed an extra side for Christmas and had a large bag of baby carrots so I quadrupled the recipe.  I made no changes and it was delightful!

This  recipe is so good and very easy.  It brings out the flavors without being over powering or sweet. I steamed my carrots in the microwave, and made the sauce on the stove and mixed the sauce and carrots once they were steamed.  Super easy and fast.  I was a little concerned with the ingredients, however I was presently surprised of how much we liked the flavor.  I will keep this recipe on my list and will make again.

I've made this recipe several times to rave reviews. It's become my "potluck" dish. I recently was called upon to make a Vegan version. I used soy free Earth Balance butter replacement (I'm allergic to soy) and 100% maple syrup measure for measure as the honey replacement. Many Vegans don't eat honey. You can get small 1.7oz. bottles of the maple syrup at World Mkt.(Cost Plus). It turned out SOOO good!!

Absolutely delicious! I'm a fan of glazed carrots with maple syrup but to do honey and vanilla...YUMMY! My 1 year old gobbled them up too! 5 stars for sure for taste and how easy it was to make them.

I really liked them this way but they were a little too sweet for my boyfriend.  Will make again in the future, maybe I will try a little less honey.

I doubled the recipe and it took the carrots 15-20 min. to get tender.  I may try a bit less vanilla next time.

Very tasty! I'll be making my own glazed carrots from now on. Great as-is or with a splash of rum instead of the vinegar.

I really enjoyed this glaze.  I used regular carrots since that's what I had (I was steaming them to make baby food and had more than I need) and had this as a snack while I was working on the baby food.  It's sweet and I could definitely see it as a side dish for dinner.  I halved the recipe and it was a little runny so my only concern was whether this would be an issue in larger volume.  I tried it on my friend and husband and got luke warm responses but they are both bad about veggies in any form.
