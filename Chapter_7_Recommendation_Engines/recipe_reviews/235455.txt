Simple and good.  I did the "and more" -- used 2 c turkey, 2 c potatoes, 1 c carrots and added 1 c celery.  Cooked on low for 7 hours and turned up to high for last hour when I added biscuits.

This is so good. No need to cook the turkey though. Just buy turkey tenderloin strips and they will cook in 3 hours on high. This way they easily shred and fall apart.

This was simple & delicious! You can bump up the potatoes & carrots if you’d like. Saucy enough not to dry out w more potatoes & carrots if you desire.

Very easy to make and delicious. My husband and daughter requested I make it again, which rarely happens.  Didn't use potatoes, added celery and doubled turkey but same basic recipe.

Made this several times and enjoy it. We add the vegetables later to keep them crisper, and I add some celery seed to give it a bit more vegetable taste. We use chicken thighs as well which was just as easy... put them in raw, and in 4 hours it's done.

It was the perfect comfort food for an easy night. It also is a one and done dish, which I love. My kids are two and six. They all liked it. I added a cup of frozen peas and had to substitute one of the cans of cream of chicken with condensed cheddar cheese soup (because I forgot to buy two). To compensate for the chicken, I added some boullion flavor.

This was so very good; all my family loved it, but one child, and he HATES his vegtables.  His vegetables have to be ground to pulp before he will eat them.  I made it as the recipe was written.  I will be making this many times in the future.

Yummy! I made it as written except I used celery instead of potatoes. I used 4 Pillsbury Frozen Grands biscuits instead of canned. Certainly interchangeable with chicken!

Made this on a cold Easter  day for lunch. Hit the spot! I did follow another reviewer's suggestion, and doubled the meat, carrots, etc. I added peas, and celery. I ommitted potatoes. I forgot to cut the busciuts up and left them whole, which resulted in  a soggy texture. Overall a great recipe. Next time I will double the broth as well, not sure if my busciuts soaked up a lot of the broth.  Thought I might try croissant dough next time....

I liked the recipe but didn’t have turkey!  I used chicken and it turned out great!  I used salt and pepper to taste as well as the poultry seasoning to taste. My family enjoyed it. I will be making this comfort recipe again.

This turned out better than I expected.  I chopped up turkey left from thanksgiving.  Added 2 cans of yams, 1 can of drained carrots, poultry seasoning and salt.  I added 2 cups of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken.  I cut up canned biscuits and dropped them in an hour before eating.  Wow!  A hint of sweetness and savory.  I would definitely make it again.

This had a great flavor.  It had a little too much sauce.  Next time I would add some peas and celery and maybe mix in some flour to thicken the sauce.  The whole family loved it!

I sauteed 10 chicken tenderloins with salt, pepper and chicken seasoning, then chunked the pieces before adding to mixture.  Added more of everything and the crockpot was full, especially when the dumplings cooked up.  The broth was perfect, like a gravy.  Incredibly delicious.  Only thing I'll add next time is celery too.

Will be making this again with a lot of modifications. Needs more texture variance and spices. Probably gonna be adding celery, bacon, and French fried onions on top.

Hold back on some of the chicken broth a little. This was just a tad too thin coming out of the crockpot, but very flavorful and delicious!

Obsessed. I used raw chicken instead of turkey, and added more than a pinch of the spices (to me that would've been too bland). Next time I'll try adding celery as well.

This was pretty good.  I used corn, peas and potatoes instead of the carrots and onion.  I found the broth too watery so I added some tumeric and cornstarch, it turned out pretty good.

Delicious and easy to make! I added a little bit of corn starch to it to get it to thicken up and made biscuits with Bisquick. My family loved it!

We enjoyed this I started out with 4 raw chicken breasts. When the food was done I broke meat up with the spoon. The meat made enough liquid I was able to add a whole can of biscuits.  I made this in my pressure cooker in slow cooker mode. I also added defrosted corn and peas when I added the biscuits. Thanks for posting.

Perfect leftover turkey recipe.  Extremely easy & delicious!!  Made it as per the recipe with minor adjustments.  Did 2 cups turkey & substituted half cup of carrots for celery.  Family LOVED it!!

Very good recipe. I tossed in green onion in to give it a wider color range. Even my 4 year really enjoyed it.

This was super easy and delicious.  I left out the poultry seasoning as I didn't have any and added fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Way better than eating left over turkey sandwiches after Thanksgiving!
