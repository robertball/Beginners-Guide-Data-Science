Fantastic!  I've made this a few times and it is always a big hit.  I use baby spinach and I don't bother cooking it.  I just toss it in.  When the spinach is mixed in the salad, the dressing  naturally wilts as if it were cooked.  I would highly recommend doing it this way.

Simple and classy - a "gourmet deli" pasta salad.  Refreshingly different from the typical mayonnaise based pasta salads. I used  refrigerated tortellini, fresh baby spinach, chopped Roma tomatoes and my own vinegar and olive oil dressing.  Beautiful colors of the Italian flag! Nicely done.

Fabulous pasta salad! It's simple and delicious! It's so easy to put together, yet tastes like something you'd find at a gourmet deli. I used fresh tortellini and fresh spinch vs. frozen. I also threw in some roasted red peppers along with the cherry tomatoes and olives. I  used shredded Parmesan and for the dressing I chose "Nonna's Tuscan Salad Dressing" from this site. This recipe is a definite keeper!

This was a hit at our ladies luncheon!  Very colorful; nice light, Italian taste.  I used about 4-5 ounces of finely chopped fresh spinach, uncooked, a little more parmesan cheese than called for, a little more tortellini, and not nearly as much salad dressing (less than half of the 16 oz bottle).  I used those little sweet 'grape' tomatoes and didn't cut them in half.  It sat for a little bit (about an hour and a half) which I think was good.  Let the tortellini soak up all the flavors.  Thanks so much for this recipe - it's a keeper!

This is definitely a keeper!  I took the advice of other reviewers...used 8 oz. Wishbone Robusto Italian, added chopped roasted red peppers, diced red onion, fresh spinach and some Italian seasoning.

Beautiful and delicious!

This was a huge hit.  I used fresh baby spinach as other reviewers suggested.  I am not sure it would be any good with frozen.  I also used two seeded and diced Roma tomatoes and about a cup of sliced mushrooms.  I also use a honey garlic vinegrette that I also got off this site.  The sweet taste of the vinegrette went really well with the spinach.

I used fresh baby spinach (uncooked) more tortellini and Wishbone's Robusto Italian salad dressing. 

Husband was leery at first but ended up getting seconds and saying he would like to have this again. 

PLEASE NOTE!! The recipes states "use enough salad dressing to coat". It DOES NOT SAY use the whole bottle. Please read the recipe before giving it a bad review.

I love this recipe! I added some grilled chicken to it, and used fresh spinach instead. I absolutely love the fact that it's so easy to make and doesn't make a big mess to clean up afterwards.

I've made this recipe (doubled) for potlucks twice now and there were no leftovers!  Other than cooking torts, it's just a matter of tossing things together so I appreciate the quick prep.  I do cook tortellini the day before, strain, add a splash of the oily dressing to keep pasta separated.  Put in storage bowl with everything EXCEPT the spinach and cheese.  I stir in about a cup of Italian dressing.  Refrigerate, stirring to mix occasionally.  I use pre-package of baby spinach.  Remove stems, place in the bowl you will serve from, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve or take somewhere.  Before combining, if tort mixture needs more liquid, add a little more (1/4 cup dressing.  I like the whole salad lightly coated, not swimming in the dressing. Combine in serving bowl, stir, add shredded parmesan cheese to the top.  Yummy.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner and it was the biggest hit of the evening.....Guests were taking second and third helpings.  I used the frozen spinach, which I didn't like using (too messy), so I will use the fresh spinach and red onion today.  Very colorful and very tasty.....Highly recommended...

Delish!  I brought it to our annual neighborhood "Blocktober Fest" and it was well recieved.  I tripled the recipe, used one 16 oz. bottle of Wishbone Robusto Italian dressing, grape tomatoes (so there was no need to cut them) & added chunked salami.  I also used only 5 oz. of fresh spinich just barely cooked, yum.  Thanks Linda!

This was a nice salad. I added a red onion, used fresh baby spinach leaves and made my own dressing using olive oil, balsamic vinegar and seasonings. A grating of fresh parm topped it beautifully.

This is a very easy and versatile recipe that can be modified to suit your taste.  I used a 19 oz. bag of frozen cheese tortellini but kept other measurements about the same.  I added some chopped mozzarella.  I mixed together everything except the spinach and tossed it with about 1/2 bottle Italian dressing.  I let that marinate in tupperware in the fridge during the day.  About an hour before serving I mixed with fresh baby spinach leaves and added a bit more dressing.  The fresh spinach will wilt down a bit as it sits before serving.  If you don't have a large group you can use just what you need and save some of the tortellini mix in the tupperware to make more the next day (or days later) with more fresh spinach.

Easy, attractive and healthy! I used fresh baby spinach, like many others, chopped and not cooked. I doubled the recipe and used tri-colored tortellini. Taking it to a picnic tonight - it will probably be even better after a couple of hours in the fridge. Thanks for posting this one, it's a keeper!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and used fresh spinach and added some chopped salami, mozarella, sliced kalamata olives and used grape tomatoes so there was no need to slice.  I also used Newman's Own Light Italian, about 3/4 bottle which was perfect.  I used boxed cheese and spinach tortellini but wish I would have used the fresh.  Just my preference.  Excellent pasta salad that I plan on making again in the very near future!  Thanks for the post!

Wonderful pasta salad.  I took it to a BBQ recently (along with copies of the recipe), everyone loved it.  I used a fresh spinach, coarsely chopped, grape tomatoes, a small red onion, and I added salad shrimp.  I used Italian Salad Dressing from Hidden Valley...my new favorite Italian Dressing.  This recipe is quick, and delicious...what more could you ask for!!

I didn't care for this so much, and maybe it was the type of bbq & italian I used. I used Jack Daniels spicy bbq & Kraft Italian. Maybe I'll try it again with different kinds. Tortellini is refreshing in pasta salad, rather than traditional rotini or such. The spinach would be better I think if doused with a little balsamic vinegar before adding it.

Wow was this ever amazing!  I made it a month ago and forgot to comment, but I will now!  I was in Italy when I made this, and there is no cheese-filled tortellini there- in fact my boyfriend laughed and said "Cheese filled tortellini?! What is that!" So we used Prosciutto filled tortellini, skipped the spinach completely because the store's spinach supply looked really bad and dead...also I wasn't into frozen spinach and didn't want to use lettuce!  We used also sliced black and green olives, and as for the Italian Style Dressing- i don't know about you but REAL Italian style dressing is just Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar, maybe some lemon juice!  So I put on the parmesan, tomatoes, olives, olive oil, and OH MY GOD was this ever AMAZING!!!!  Now I'm home and I want to make this for my parents and brothers!!!

I thought this was more along the lines of 'cowgirl food' as Pioneer Woman would say...but my man complimented me on it extensively. I subbed fresh spinach, added a bunch of fresh parsley, and omitted the olives because we don't like them. Easy to make, thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a TEN star recipe! I quadrupled it to feed a crowd, and everyone loved it. I added chopped red onion for flavor and texture. I also placed a bowl of crumbled feta cheese (YUM) next to the salad so that anyone who wanted could sprinkle it over their salad. That gave it an extra special touch and a great boost to the flavor. I will be making this over and over again...Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a version of one of the most well-received dishes I make for get-togethers. It's also extremely versatile. We have learned that we much prefer to add the dressing to the tortellini the night before (or at least several hours). Sometimes it requires a little more dressing on the final mix (because it soaks up), but it really boosts the blending of the flavors. I also (like others) use fresh baby spinach. It's also great with cucumber. I like to add cooked chicken pre-marinated in the dressing or this amazing NY Italian Sausage from a local meat shop. I usually use Ken's Lite Northern Italian or Ken's Lite Caesar. We do much prefer shredded Parmesan to the grated, but that's just personal taste. I also add pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to taste. I love the cherry or grape tomatoes in it - the color is beautiful and they add a lot to the taste. I do leave them whole, partly because they look better to me and are still easy to eat, and partly because my husband doesn't care for them and they are easy to pick out that way. I ALWAYS double this recipe, even for small groups, because there is never enough. With the exception of the spinach, it all holds really well as leftovers, so if I leave some at home for later, I don't put the spinach in it then. All in all, this is a fantastic dish - easy, versatile, pretty, and a little different.

Excellent, easy, delecious.  But of cours I always tweek it a little bit.  Instead of sliced olives I used chopped olives, they stick to the pasta in a really nice way, also added some green onions to it.  Make sure you go easy on the salad dressing, and of course I used fresh baby spinach.

This is a nice, light salad.  I used fresh spinach.  Probably only used about 4oz of dressing, which was plenty.  People could add more if they wanted it.

First of all,  I really hate it when people change the recipe and then bash it because they didn't like the changes they made.  That being said.... I changed everything in this recipe because I had nothing on hand and was desperate for something to take to work for lunch the next day.  Necessity being the mother of invention, I used borsetti (little pasta pockets with chicken and bacon) from the Kroger deli for the tortellini, shredded cabbage for the spinach, 1 well-drained can of fire roasted tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes, 2 cukes for the olives, no cheese at all and half a bottle of wishbone italian bruschetta dressing (which is awesome, by the way).  And it was great!  Didn't look too pretty, but tasted just fine.  Thank you Ivich for the IDEA of the recipe and I'm really looking forward to making it as written.  I'm sure it will be even better than my cobbled together effort.

This was very good..  I doubled the recipe to bring to a family party.  I added about 3-4 roasted sweet red peppers and used 1 bag of baby spinach.  I cooked the pasta and then added it to all the other ingredients (already mixed) and that wilted the uncooked spinach perfectly.

This was a very good recipe.  I did not add the black olives, as I wanted to serve it the next day and I noticed a few people who said the salad looked gross the following day.  I'm sure that is due to the fact that black olives break down easily onto other ingredients.  I added lots of feta cheese, as we like a stronger tasting cheese and I put in a yellow bell pepper, julienned into thin strips as well as some finely sliced red onion.  It looked impressive and tasted even better...I might suggest coating the pasta in the Italian dressing while the pasta is still hot.  It soaks up all the wonderful spices while it cools. Then add the veggies once cool and refrigerate.  It looks great the next day!

Tasty and filling!  I halved this recipe, and used fresh torn spinach, chopped celery and some asiago cheese.  Next time I will cut back on the dressing cause it is strong, or I may try an italian dressing recipe from the site to use.

Yummy!  I used fresh baby spinach.  I cannot imagine using frozen.  The fresh spinach will wilt when you add the dressing.  I also added cucumber and mozzarella crumbles.  I probably used more tortellini and just used enough salad dressing to coat the salad; a whole jar lasted several salads.  Try adding artichokes too.  My Bunco group loved it and asked for the recipe.  This is an easy and is a fantastic salad to use as a side or main dish.  Bravo.

I used fresh spinach (didn't cook) a "low fat" salad dressing (about 1/2 what the recipe called for), and just a little bit more parmesan cheese. I also added the pine nuts. This was a huge hit and a perfect side dish for a summer grilled chicken dinner.

My neighbor had surgery, I was looking for something her husband wouldn't have to go through a lot of trouble to make for her, and I came across this. I omitted the black olives, used 19 oz. of tortellini, fresh grated parmesan, fresh baby spinach, fresh basil from my garden, and only 4 oz. of Italian dressing. I have to say your recipe was a hit. The wife wanted to know every detail on how to make it. Thanks for a great idea!!! I'm going to start using this on a regular basis. I've even been kicking around the idea of adding some marinated balsamic chicken next time.

Excellent with fresh spinach.  Added green onion.  Will add cubed salami next time to make a heartier entree.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Cook torts in advance & marinate overnight in dressing.

Very tasty and pretty darn easy too. I made if for our 4th of July BBQ and it was a hit.  I think next time I will try adding some additional veggies - I think artichoke hearts would be amazing in this.

This was fantastic and super easy.  Make ahead and let sit over night, or at least a few hours. Made it for a bridal shower luncheon as a side dish.  Added bacon and also used the fresh spinach.  Didn't quite need the entire bottle of dressing, but used Ken's Steakhouse Lite Northern Italian with cheeses in it, so no need to add additional parm. Delish!

This salad is delicious, and keeps well for a few days (the flavor just gets better.)  I mixed too kinds of salad dressing-Newman's own light italian with Lemon, and Kraft's zesty italian dressing, threw in 1/2 of a small red onion, minced finely, and used 10 fresh kalamata olives, also minced.  I followed the suggestions to use fresh spinach, because I was turned of by the suggestion of frozen spinach, and threw in some thinly sliced genoa salami.  My boyfriend and I can't get enough of this salad!

I made this for a family cook out and it was a big hit.  I took adice of others and used fresh baby spinach and even though I doubled the recipe I still didn't use a whole 16 oz. bottle of dressing.  I also omitted the olives since we don't like olives.  It was fabulous.

In my opinion this recipe would be better if prepared with fresh spinach rather than frozen.

Squeezing the water out of the thawed spinach turns it into an unmanagable clump.  The fresh would be easier to handle.

To answer "ILOVECARL", I think you could do it either way.  If you wanted to treat this like a regular salad, then I'd let the pasta cool somewhat and add fresh, uncooked spinach. Personally, I would treat this as a warm entree because the cheese tortellini would seem to make it too heavy for a side dish.  So if I was using fresh spinach instead of frozen, I would just cook it till it wilts, in a little olive oil and garlic.

I noticed that many people used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Did you cook the fresh spinach or just chop it up and add it uncooked?
If the spinach was cooked, how long did you cook it?

Very very tasty!  It was nice to find a good, non mayonaise or oil based pasta salad!  I ended up using a larger can of whole olives that I halved, since it was already in the pantry.  The only issue that I ran into was that the thawed frozen spiniach tended to clump.  Might use fresh next time, but there will definitely be a next time!

It was great...served at a supper club dinner and only had a small amount left plus everyone gave it rave reviews AND hubby had second helping when we got home.  I used bottled Olive Garden Italian dressing and Kraft parmesan shreds in a bag...was very, very good!

Great recipe as is, especially with fresh spinach.  With an addition of crumbled feta cheese & slivered almonds this was a better textured dish.  I found that my family enjoyed it more after it sat in the fridge for a few hours.

This recipe gets 5 stars for versatility and easiness!!  I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of olives and chopped baby spinach instead of frozen. Mixed the packet Italian dressing in the blender and poured over salad and let marinate overnight.  It was the first thing to go at the Easter picnic!

This is excellent! Made as stated but had to pull spinach out so I think next time I will only used fresh spinach. Did not care for the olives so definitely wont add those again. But this was my first time to ever have tortellini and since I had cooked spaghetti sauce the night before I tried it with it first and wasn't impressed. The italian dressing was perfect with it!! Will definitely experiment with it in the future!

I made this for a weekend trip, and many asked for the recipe. Everyone loved it so much, that we were debating who was going to bring it to July 4th. Even the teens asked about it and loved it. This is a keeper.

This salad is really good. I have made it three times since I discovered it last week and everyone loves it even my picky kids. I used fresh spinach, half the bottle of dressing , and once added some left over chicken. So yummy and great for the summer time when it's too hot to cook.  I think I might try adding salami next time.

I have made this salad several times now, and it seems that the results really depend on the type of Italian dressing used.  When I use my favorite good-quality dressing, this salad is absolutely fantastic!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is PHENOMENAL! One of my favorite salads to make in summer. I must have made it half a dozen times. I did omit the olives because I don't care for them but I didn't miss a thing. To make it look even prettier I would use multi-colored tortellini. YUMMY!!!

We enjoyed this as a main dish, but it became very filling, so it would be better suited as a side dish. Also, make sure you prepare this the day before serving. It is best the second day!

This is an excellent recipe. I'm giving it 5 stars although I did do some substitutions. I know I would like the recipe as stated but I wasn't sure if the amount of tortellini called for was dried or fresh. I used the dried. I also used a 9 oz bag of fresh baby spinach. I mistakenly bought an 8 oz bottle of Italian dressing but found it to be more than enough. I think this was because I rinsed the tortellini with cold water to stop the cooking process and then refrigerated it before combining with the other ingredients. It kept the tortellini from absorbing so much of the dressing. I had a 6 oz can of sliced olives so I went ahead and added the extra. Got several requests for the recipe.

Great pasta salad!  The only thing I changed was using fresh baby spinach.  I lightly browned some garlic in olive oil, and then added some chicken broth and simmered the fresh spinach.  The dressing that I used was the Italian Dressing Mix that I also got from this site.  Definitely needs to sit overnight for great results.

Tastes good and easy to make. Going forward, I'll be sure to thaw the spinach ahead of time... that was a bit of a pain!  ;-)

This recipe is a delight to the tastebuds! I have made this for several recent occasions and it is always the first salad to go. I also add thinly sliced fresh mushrooms and a few red onion rings (sliced thinly). The best Italian dressing? Good Seasons Italian. Delicious!

Great recipe for a party.  I make it the day before and all the flavors mesh together nicely. Get good quality fresh or frozen tortellini -- the tri-color kind makes for a nicer-looking salad. I've used Paul Newman's Italian dressing with great results -- I would never add a whole 16 oz bottle of dressing though!  I think I use about half a bottle.

I've been making a dish similar to this for potlucks all summer and it's a huge hit.  I love the idea of adding fresh spinach.  For a heavier salad, I add some chunks of Genoa salami.

Very easy to make!  Used more tortellini, less spinach, more cheese, and less dressing.  Great thing about this recipe is that you can adjust it to your taste and it still turns out looking and tasting wonderful.

Delicious but too much spinach. Next time I'll halve the spinach.  I also added extra parm cheese and used Robusto Italian dressing for extra kick.  It was great.  Can't wait to make again.  Husband loved it & he hates cold pasta

Loved this salad and it is so easy--not a lot of chopping.  Used baby spinach and mixed it in while the tortellini was hot and it wilted nicely.

Used all the ingredients listen plus or minus a few ounces.  I threw in what looked like enough.  I definitely bought too much spinach.  Used baby spinach and chopped it just a bit.  FANTASTIC!  Bet it would be good with some cheese and pepperoni thrown in as well.

FABULOUS!  Even my kids thought it was great (which is quite a testament!)  I may mix it up a bit the next time I make it.  I like the suggetion of the artichoke hearts and fresh spinich as opposed to the frozen, but all in all, this was one of the best and easiest recipes I have used from this site.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicous crowd pleaser!!  I used 7 cheese tortellini from Costco, fresh baby spinach (didn't cook it), Robusto Italian dressing and left out the olives and parmesan cheese and it was STILL delicious. I've made this 3 times in the last month. One time I marinated chicken breast in italian dressing overnight, grilled it and added it to the salad. It was a meal in itself.  I will be making this forever!

I've made it twice now and got rave reviews each time.  The first time I used fresh basil instead of spinach, and the second time I used watercress instead of the spinach.  The dressing was a little strong, so the second time I used half creamy Italian and half lemon basil marinade.  That was smooth and very tasty.  Also used kalamata olives instead of black olives.  It's a great recipe!

add more seasoning.  Great start for a fantastic pasta salad.  Even the kids ate it.  I used fresh baby spinach.  Add some fresh basil. Just toss it together don't think too much about it.  Have fun.

This was a good recipe. I made it for the 4th and a couple of people even asked me for the recipe. I thought it was good, but not a "show-stopper" - I would probably make it again if asked.  I too used fresh spinach. I also used fat free italian dressing. I let it sit for a few hours. Helpful hint, add the dressing as you go, you may not need it all, but remember that the pasta will absorb some of the dressing, so, you might need to add more right before serving. Oh, cheese is a "must" to complete the dish (I ran out of parmesean and had to use italian blend with it, too)!

This pasta salad is great! I took it to a 4-family get together where, oddly, everyone brought pasta salad and this got great reviews. Its good to let the flavors sit together for awhile before serving, I prefer to eat it room temperature or even a little warm, but my husband liked it cold.

I used fresh spinach and grape tomatoes, which I left whole. I also served the dressing separately, since my kids don't like it and my husband likes way more than I do. Five star fresh recipe. However, the leftovers weren't that great, and since I had enough for my husband and I to have it for lunch, it was disappointing.

Delicious, and I don't even like spinach!  I omitted the black olives because my husband does not care for them.  Also, fresh spinach is healthier than frozen, so I used that.  It is best to make it a couple of hours ahead of time so the spinach soaks up some of the dressing!

I thought this was very good. Don't add the dressing until just before serving or the spinach will become soggy. It can't keep once the dressing is added so make enough to eat  at one sitting. Substituions I made were: 1/2 cup Italian dressing,whole black olives, Asiago cheese, grape cherries, and chopped red onion. I used fresh spinach. I can't imagine using frozen in this dish. I will make it again.

So simple and easy, but fresh and DELICIOUS!  I pretty much followed the recipe except that I halved black olives instead of using sliced.  Also, the frozen chopped spinach was fine-- the flavor blended right in with the rest.  I'll definitely make this again soon.  Oh, as the directions state: add enough dressing to COAT the salad-- not the whole bottle.

This was tasty.  I too added fresh baby spinach, chopped up genoa salami and it def needed more grated cheese and salt and pepper.  I used good seasons made with balsamic vinegar and just eyed the dressing as I added it in.  Wish I had some fresh mozz cheese to add in.  I still felt like it was missing a little something but it was a good side dish at our bbq and there wasn't much left at days end.

Husband said to give this a 5; I would come in at 4*. Next time, I will use fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen, thawed stuff. I think that will make a major difference. Used Walmart's brand of Italian dressing.

As it is written, I would hesitate making it because of the high calorie and fat content.  There must be a way to "slim" it up because it does sound like a great tasting recipe.

I used fresh uncooked spinach,(which is what I like in salads) but this salad was just fair to me.  It sounded wonderful but didn't have what I was looking for.  Maybe I just needed a better brand of tortellini.

Excellent!! I did it the first time around with frozen spinach -- likely less flavor, but easier when putting together a picnic spread. Next time I'll try the fresh leaves and throw in the suggested pine nuts. Kids love it!

I have made this recipies several times, and each time, people rave about it.  The only thing that I have found to improve upon it is the addition of Pine Nuts - very satisfying dish.

This was an easy yummy dish.  I used fresh spinach and made my own salad dressing.  Didn't have any olives but still tasted great.

This recipe was good. Although next time I think I will make it with the fresh spinach. I wasn't crazy about the frozen spinach, also would add more balsamic vinegar. Will make again.

Delicious! I made this for my Super Bowl party, and my guests really enjoyed it. I cut the amount of dressing in half, and it was still great. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks so much for posting it!

I tried it with meat and with cheese tortelline.  Almost any variation is good, however I used baby spinach and learned to add it just prior to serving or it gets soggy.  ( It still tastes good)

I loved it! I did use a larger box of tortellini and less salad dressing than instructed. So my advice is don't just dump all the salad dressing in. I did that the first time I made it, and the bottom of the bowl was soggy.

This is an easy and fabulous pasta salad.  I used slicedorganic baby spinach with cherry tomatoes.  Instead of the black olives, I used Kalamata.  Love it!  Pretty and colorful.

I thought it was a little bland. BUT I decided that I wanted to still eat it so I added some pepperoni, red onion, feta, and some balsamic. OMG I can't stop eating it it's delicious!! I just do not think the italian dressing had enough flavor. I love a flavor that just pops and wakes up the taste buds!

makes people think i know how to cook! didn't have cherry tomatoes, so we diced some big ones. fresh spinach because that's what we had. 50/50 parm and romano for the same reason. this was a treat for my wife because i don't think much of spinach, but i loved it just as much as her—i mean as much as she did. this goes into the "keeper" file. thanks, allrecipes!

This is a great filling summer pasta salad. I used fresh baby spinach which many reviewers preferred and I agree 100%. I also used Italian salad dressing mix from this site just subbed the thyme and basil in the dressing, I used fresh.

I read all the reviews before making this salad. I went with fresh spinach shredded into small pieces and the zesty Italian dressing lightly coating the tortellini as instructed in the instructions. I can see where to much would be too much! It was delicious. My husband gave it two thumbs up. I can't wait to make it for my girlfriends. I know they will love it too.

I too used fresh spinach. Great way to use it up when I get a lot in my CSA from the farmer's market. I used a larger package of tortellini because that's what I had and used Olive Garden Italian. I eat this all summer long.

I added fresh red peppers and used fresh spinach (about half of a big bag.. no measuring though). I also used grape tomatoes halved and my dressing was "Italian Dressing Mix" from this site. It was so delicious!! Will absolutely be making this again!

It definitely was a quick dish. I'm always a little modest with my rating. So three stars to me means good, not great or awesome, but definitely good. And it is very quick and easy to make. Nice on a hot day.

I thought I would 5 this one for sure before I made it, but for some reason it didn't WOW me enough for 5, (and I'm even preggo and craving olives).  Simply very good... my husband enjoyed it as well, but I will not add this to my frequent list.

I actually served it warm and preferred it that way, with a very quick saute, but tasted quite good. And yes, I didn't have tortellinis, so I just used shell pasta filled with cheese.

Very good. I usually don't change a recipe the first time I try it however; I did use fresh spinach because I knew several of the people who would be eating it only like fresh. Made Good Seasons Italian salad dressing ~ was a good choice.

This was a hit in my house! I used shaved parmesan instead of grated.  In the future, I might try shredded parm instead.  Not a bite of this was left!

Made this last night! I love it! I doubled the tortellini, and since I didn't have any parmesan cheese like I thought I did, I used shredded cheddar. I also omitted the olives and tomatoes since I don't like either. I microwaved the chese and spinach together to melt it, then mixed in the tortellini and added the italian dressing. It was delicious and I'm enjoying the leftovers for lunch today! I'm sure it would be even better with a little chopped onion and/or garlic!

A winner!  I followed the advice of others and used fresh baby spinach which worked out perfectly.  Instead of a vinaigrette I used a good quality creamy Italian dressing that I had just bought but only used half the amount called for in the recipe and I found it was "wet" enough.  I've made it three times since making it the first time on August 20.

I made this salad for dinner the other night and it got rave reviews from the family - even my kids liked it.  Like previous reviewers, i used fresh spinach in place of frozen.  I used about 1/4 cup of italian dressing (Girards) to coat and that was plenty. I also added fresh chopped basil and parsley and a minced clove of garlic.  I used kalamata olives in place of black because that's what we had on hand. Excellent salad. Would definitely make it again just the same way.

We love this salad.  The only changes I made were using fresh chopped spinach and Good Seasons Italian salad dressing.  I have also added kidney beans which were a flavor booster.

Fantastic!  Perfect for summer.  Much better for you than an ordinary pasta salad, and more filling.  Works great with canned tomatoes too, if you don't have any fresh on hand.

This was a perfect, light, summer meal!  I used fresh spinach but only about 1/2 a bag and only about 1/2 the amount of italian dressing.  Added salt and ground pepper.  Will def be making this again!  Thanks!

This salad was absolutely yummy!  I did use fresh baby spinach per other reviewers, added some red onion and carrots sticks.  I also used Asiago cheese and did not halve the cherry tomatoes.  This dish was a hit.

Okay-ish dish. The tortellini were to heavy for all of the remaining ingredients-the dressing was tasty. I followed the suggestion of some reviewers and used fresh spinach--good idea. Did NOT look any bit appetizing the next day--It actually looked bad enough I had to shut my eyes to eat each bite.

pretty good. I followed the directions pretty closely. I used Ken's steakhouse light italian dressing.. just a splash. As per other reviewers, I used fresh spinach. I used grape tomatoes, which got unappetizingly squishy after a few hours.. Next time they will be a last minute addition. I used a 16oz bag of 3 cheese tortellini cooked for 7 minutes. A handful of reduced fat feta topped it off nicely. will make again!

Very easy to prepare and YUMMY!  I only used 1/2 bottle of light italian dressing, used pitted kalamata olives, and added a few shrimp to make it great.  Would like to use feta cheese and steamed aspargus tips next time instead of the spinach and parmesan cheese.

I trusted the rating on this and it was just awful!  I only put half of the dressing on and it was still too much.

My older sister makes a delicious tortellini salad that I wanted to recreate using spinach to get rid of it before it went bad and this is the AMAZINGLY HUGE hit  that I came up with.  I added 1 can artichoke hearts, salami (but sausage would've worked great too), I used I can canned tomatoes (would've preferred sund-dried tomatoes, but they're wayy too expensive), and I made sure to use a good chunky italien dressing.  The taste of this is SO flavorful and refreshingly light and delicious. This was such a huge hit with my finace who has been raised on high fat, high sugar meals his entire life.  Keeps well--excellent for picnics or make a big batch and use for a fresher lunch option throughout the week.

Awesome recipe! Everyone at my party loved it. I made a few changes. I bought the dry tortellini. I also put fresh spinach in the food processor chopped it up very small. I also added chunks of salami. I bought an italian dressing and just used half the bottle. It was perfect!

I offered to make a pasta salad for a soccer party I was going to attend. The next day I found myself out of time and ingredients. This recipe was perfect, because all of these ingredients were in my freezer or pantry. I didn't measure a thing, and used whole chopped tomatoes as opposed to cherry. I also used less frozen spinach and WAY less dressing. My team ate it all up and raved- even the spinach haters loved it! The mild, unoffensive flavor was perfect for teenagers. Thanks!

With a few changes, this was a delicious tortellini pasta salad.  Like other reviewers, I opted to use fresh baby spinach and it was great, though I would certainly try using frozen if fresh weren’t available.  I also left out the olives (I’m not a fan) and used just over ½ a bottle of a great basalmic vinaigrette dressing, which was plenty of dressing – any more and it would have been soggy.  I used a 14 oz.  bag of frozen tortellini and it was enough for a tasty picnic side dish for 6.

This recipe is easily adapted to your own personal tastes.  Very simple to make and tastes very fresh.  I think I'd prefer with fresh, wilted spinach.

Delicious. I used garlic cheese tortellini, fresh spinach that I microwaved for one minute, and chopped a large tomato. I omitted the olives since I didn't have any, and used a caesar viniagrette dressing instead of the italian. I found I only needed approximately 8 oz of dressing, and since the dressing I was using already had parmesean in it, I just sprinkled a little parmeasean on top. Great, easy side dish, and attractive to look at!

I made this recipe for a BBQ and got several compliments on this salad.  I don't like olives, so I omitted the olives and substituted mushrooms instead.  I sauteed the mushrooms in some olive oil and garlic and then threw them in the salad.  I think they really gave the salad a good flavor!  I also substituted fresh spinach for the frozen.  I forgot to add the parmesean cheese, but it didn't taste like it was missing anything without it.  I'm sure I will make this recipe again!

It certainly doesn't get any easier than this.  This took only minutes to throw together with fresh baby spinach in place of frozen and Italian dressing mix (one of our favorites) from this site.  I marinated the tortellini, olives and tomatoes for a bit in the dressing, but added the spinach before serving.  It wilted very quickly.

This salad was so good!!  I omitted the olives and used sun dried tomatoes instead.  You also don't need 16 ounces of dressing.  I used half of that.  I did use frozen spinach which was good but fresh spinach would be so much better!!!

Every time I make this it's a hit. I follow the recipe, but I use grape tomatoes cut in half length wise and I use Paul Newman's salad dressing. I also use the fresh refridgerated, tri-colored tortellini. It's even great the next day.

This was easy to make, pretty, and great tasting! Using tricolor pasta adds color. Great for pot-luck dinners, cookouts, or picnics. Made nice leftovers, too, as the flavors had a longer time to mingle.

Very tasty and healthy!!  I added 2 diced slices of honey glazed chicken slices, mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach.  It tastes better cool then warm. Next time I will add more turkey pieces and plain croutons to give it some crunchiness.

I made this as a side dish, and everyone really liked it.  I served it at room temperature.  A couple people thought it might be better if served warm.  I think either way the flavor was great.  I only used 1/2 the amount of spinach though...it looked like too much to me to use the amount given.  Thanks for the delicious idea!!

Delicious. I'm trying to eat more veg, so I added in 1 chopped red bell pepper, a stalk of celery,  and like others, just used fresh baby spinach as it wilts nicely in.  I added some black olives and a full container of baby bocconcini and about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. I used Renee's Creamy Italian as the dressing. This will be a lovely lunch each day for my work week.

WOW! absolutely fantastic. My husband said Olive Garden any one? 
i used fresh spinach and put chopped up zucchini in it.
I think a splash of lemon, a little onion and garnish with a salad pepper would be awesome.
i mixed in parmesan and sprinkled it on top. thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This was so good. My husband loved it. As others, I put fresh baby spinach uncooked and it was perfect. I added sliced red onion and small pieces of pepperoni. I used some Kraft roasted red pepper italian dressing with a little olive oil. Quick and easy recipe.

- When you need a potluck dish in a hurry!  Use chopped fresh spinach - the dressing will wilt it.  I used Kraft's new pesto/olive oil Italian dressing - great flavour!

Very colorful, easy, and tasty salad. The only change I made this time around was my use of fresh spinach, to me cooked is too slimy unless is the creamed variety. I would recommend starting with less dressing and then adjusting it to taste. I tend to go much lighter on my salad dressings than many people do

I make this salad a lot in the summer and I make it a main dish by adding shrimp. We don't like olives and tomatoes so I add diced onion and radishes, quartered. 8oz Italian dressing is way too much! I use 1/4-1/2c. dressing. Also I use fresh spinach and some fresh garlic too. Light easy summer meal with no need to heat up the kitchen!

My daughter made this (after I cooked and drained the pasta) and we all enjoyed it.  She taste-tested a few different dressings and decided to use Newman's Own Greek dressing.  She also used fresh baby spinach versus frozen.  Using tortellini made for a heartier pasta salad, which was perfect, as this was our main course.

I've made this recipe exactly as written several times over the years. It has been quite popular at potlucks and cookouts. I love to make it and have for lunch over the week since the cheese ravioli make it a good meal as well as side dish. The main change that I make now is adding slightly less spinach because it gets stuck in my teeth. Otherwise, delicious!

Good salad. Based on some other reviews, I used fresh tortellini, fresh spinach, and "Nonna's Tuscan Salad Dressing" recipe from this site.

I used tortellini with fresh baby spinach, mushrooms, olives, chicken breast, tomatoes, parmesan, and zesty Italian dressing, Quick, easy, delicious, and very filling as a meal by itself.

Excellent salad!  As being one to hardly ever make something just as the recipe says, I really appreciated this one.  I did add some yellow bell peppers and Italian zucchini primarily for additional color.  Did not have parmesan on hand so substituted tomato/basil feta - did a nice job adding a bit different flavor profile - and used less than called for dressing.  Thanks - very yum!

Excellent recipe! I made it as written, except I used fresh, chopped up spinach, and the dressing . I made the Tuscan dressing on this site, as another reviewer had done. Perfect! Took it to a birthday dinner yesterday and everyone raved about it! I can see where you can put your own touches on this salad also, but I like to make a recipe as is first, if possible. Definitely will be making this a lot!

Very tasty pasta salad! Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I substituted fresh baby spinach for the frozen. I also used "Nona's Tuscan Salad Dressing", which I highly recommend. I am not a fan of raw tomatoes, so I opted to use less cherry tomatoes and added sliced sun-dried tomatoes plus chopped roasted red pepper. I will be making this again!

This was a very easy and tasty salad. I used Buitoni three cheese Tortellini.  I made up a pouch of good seasons Italian all natural salad dressing. I forgot to buy spinach. So I used romaine lettuce. It turned out great. Everyone liked it. I will use baby spinach next time.

This is a nice and refreshing salad.  My husband normally hates olives but ate every last one of them in the salad...lol.  That shows just how good this was!  The only changes I made were to use fresh baby spinach like another reviewer recommended and my tortallini was whole wheat.  Will make again as is but this is easy to tweak as well.

I cannot say enough about how great this salad is! It is incredibly easy and quick to put together but the flavors are complex and it looks like a work of art. Absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS! I made it for the first time a few days ago and it was an instant favorite with my family. I made it again tonight due to popular request.

OK your all gonna laugh. I made this but, when I purchased the tortellini I didn't have my glasses with me & bought the chicken instead of the cheese tortellini.  I also added some roasted red pepper & chopped red onion & it was delicious.  I suggest using the Wishbone Robust Italian dressing & fresh spinach.......wonderful, thanks

This was easy to prepare and very tasty!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach and cooked it ever-so-slightly (added the spinach to the tortellini in the last minute that it was cooking and drained spinach + pasta together).  I must not have rinsed it with cold enough water or for long enough, because the cheese melted slightly when combining the ingredients.  It wasn't bad, but I think I might add the parmesan last or sprinkle it onto the finished plate next time.

For our Christmas dinner, I prepared this salad using tri-colored tortellini pasta for the festive holiday appeal, and frozen spinach. (I will try fresh spinach next time.) I also doubled the recipe for a larger group.  This dish was awesome and it was a big hit among my family & relatives, everyone went back for seconds.  I will definitely make this again.

This salad was a hit at our last BBQ, and I think it will become a favourite this summer.   The only modifications I made were that I used fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen chopped, I used plum tomatoes (chopped) and I omitted the olives. This is a really yummy salad!

Had this yesterday for Mom's Day. We also used fresh spinachwhich was perfect. I think it also needed a little ground pepper; touch of seasoning salt.  Awesome recipe for a side dish with steak or chicken.  Thanks!

I omitted the spinach and the olives, used 1/3c  of Newmans Italian and 1/4c of the parmesan and the salad got rave reviews! Excellent recipe thank you!

Quick and easy -- I also used a bag of fresh baby spinach and it wilted perfectly with the salad dressing.  Great recipe!

This was fabulous at a party I gave.  Only thing I did differently was used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.  The next day I heated the leftovers in the microwave and it was outstanding as a hot dish - very versatile!!

I used the packaged spinach and instead of fresh tomates, used drained, diced canned tomatoes. I also made Italian dressing using Zesty Italian dressing mix.  I think it would be better with fresh spinach so if I make it again will follow other reviewers suggestions and add fresh, uncooked spinach.  I would also use fresh tomatoes and probably add a bit of onion.

Delicicous! I used fresh spinach, added some corn, made my own dressing and had left overs for lunch. My favorite part is that the time it took was less than 10 minutes from start to finish. Definitly something we will have again soon. Thanks   for the recipe!

Very quick and easy recipe. Because the colors are red and green, it's perfect to serve for the Christmas holidays. The next time I make it, I'm going to try using fresh baby spinach instead of frozen as others have suggested.

Excellent salad!  I thought I'd grabbed an Italian dressing, but realized when I got home that it was Newman's Own Caesar dressing.  What a delicious mistake!  I wanted to make this a meal so cubed about 4 ounces of ham steak in place of the spinach, which I found I didn't have on hand.  Very, very good as a lunch or light dinner.  Two forks up!

It was a very much needed "different" take on pasta salad.  I sub'd tri- colored tortellini and instead of using italian dressing(boreing!) I used McCormick bottled scampi sauce (next to fresh seafood in grocery store)- needless to say it was a hugh it to all of the garlic lovers out there

This is my new favorite pasta salad. I have brought it to a few potlucks and am always asked for the recipe. I prefer to use fresh baby spinach and I've thrown in some chopped genoa salami a couple of times. This is a great recipe!

This was a hit with the whole family.  I used fresh spinach and more olives than were called for, but then my family loves them. I also added salami for my picky son.  By the time I'd tossed all the ingredients except for the dressing, it looked like it didn't even need more, so I chose instead to add a couple tablespoons of a ranch vinaigrette I had on hand.  Was just enough to push it over the top, and my son devoured it, even the spinach which I can never get him to eat.  The kids have asked me to put some in lunch boxes for school now!

I made this salad for the first time the night before a Jimmy Buffett concert. I doubled the recipe and it was so easy and made so much. I used the fresh baby spinach as well, about 5 or 6 seeded roma tomatoes (2-3 if you're only making one package of tortelli), sliced black olives, and feta cheese. It was definitely a hit!

Really good for a side or main dish - I substituted feta for the parmesan, just because I like it better. This makes a lot & will last several days in the fridge. I kept adding more cut-up tomatoes to it each day so that they'd be fresher.

Yummy! As suggested by some other reviewers I added chopped red onion and torn fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also added grilled chicken strips to make it more of a meal than a side.

Used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and tossed in a handful of toasted pine nuts to add a bit of crunch. 16 oz of dressing would have been too much. I used about 12 ounces and that was plenty. I've made this recipe many times and everyone enjoys it a lot. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and very good. I have made this twice and have liked it more the second time around! I made it once with cheese and once with sausage totellini and prefer the sausage. Great recipe thanks for sharing

I made this for my husbands family for memorial day weekend...his Dad is italian (and big on italian food) and he loved this recipe.  I used fresh tortellini.  It was very good and I'd definitely make it again!  I added extra parm. cheese too!

This was very good served as a side dish. I used fresh spinach and added chopped broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and green onions for more vegies and crunch! Yum!

I almost feel guilty serving this to guests because it is SO easy! Needs tinkering for our tastes... more parmesan cheese less dressing and I add bacon! (I use robusto italian dressing)

I sadly realized that I really don't care for tortellini while eating this (maybe it was just the brand?) but otherwise the flavor was unique and delicious. My husband ate the second half of the salad the next day for lunch and loved it!

This was very easy to make and pretty tasty, too.  I think it might be even better with fresh spinach (which I plan to try the next time I make it).

FANTASTIC!  I used frozen spinach but just pressed it down in my strainer with a paper plate and if it tastes this good with frozen, I cant even imagine how wonderful it will be with fresh baby spinach.  One of the best spinach salads I have ever tasted.  I can hardly wait for lunch tomorrow.

this salad is super! like others, i used fresh spinach (the entire 10 oz, since it will wilt), grape tomatoes (so i didn't have to cut them) and omitted the olives. i also added cubed cheese for more color. what a great salad. i usually don't like leftover salads, but i ate every last bit of it and it was amazing!

I was turned off by the spinach at first but I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  And my husband even loves it!  I use chopped roma tomatoes instead of cherry and low-fat dressing.

This was a great summer dish. Instead of using Italian dressing, I used Ken's Greek Salad dressing. (Low Carb) It added a different flavor from the usual Italian pasta salads.  I will definately make this again for picnics and parties.

I made this a couple days ago and my husband LOVED IT! He said it was definately a KEEPER! I love that it is SO EASY to make! Perfect after a long day at work when you want something yummy, but don't want to spend much time in the kitchen! I added some cucumbers and sliced little grape tomatoes in it! YUM!

This salad was excellent.  I changed it a little based on some other reviews I read.  I substituted mushrooms for the black olives and used fresh spinach.  I used the Newman's Own vinegarette also.  It was so easy to make and is really great!  I will be making this again.

Once I looked over the changes I made, it really isn't the same recipe.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Added fresh mushrooms and eliminated the olives.  I used Good Seasons dressing as other reviewers had suggested and made it the day before.  It is very good...but not as flavorful as I'd like.  However, it is a very pretty salad.

Very good. However, I used a 19 ounce package of tortellini instead of a 9 ounce one that the recipe calls for. I just thought it wouldn't be enough. Worked out great, but it really doesn't need the parmesan cheese. I will probably use fresh baby spinach next time like previous reviewers have suggested.

Yum.  Have made this quite a bit in the summer. Just hadn't gotten a chance to review it.  Our favorite dressing to make it with is Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette.  I also have used ravioletti rather than tortellini and of course it tastes just as good.

What an absolutely easy and delicious salad. Can even be a perfect light meal for a hot summer night. And for people who don't like spinach, they hardly know it is there. I used Barilla tortellini 4 cheese and spinach and cheese. Awesome recipe!

This recipe is so easy and I've already made it for several pot lucks - everybody always loves it.  It was great at Christmas because the green and red in the salad are so vibrant.
