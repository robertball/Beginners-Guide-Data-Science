I have made twice bake for years but usually with sour cream.  This was my first cream cheese recipe.  First don't use foil in baking.  the skins are not crisp.  I use a garlic oil that I rub on outside of potatoes before I begin.  Skins are then crisp but not over dried and taste yummy.  I added pepper, bacon and shreddred cheese (wished I had some green onion but wasn't one in the house.) I left out the paprika because of cheese topping and milk because I was refrigerating overnight and then heating.  The extra milk was not necessary after condensation.  I also top with a bit more shredded cheddar cheese for taste and appearance.  Everyone loved the change to cream cheese.  In reheating a bit slower from refrigerator, I had a low 325 temp and then raised it up to 375 for last 10 minutes.  Did 30 minutes then 10 to melt cheese.  Also with a big dinner group I use one potatoe per every 2 people.  I split them in half.  A whole potatoe is just too much with a huge meal.

Twice baked potatoes are something that I've always loved and find to be really helpful to me when cooking on the run.  I prepared this recipe on the weekend, tripling it, so that I could freeze 2/3 of my potatoes to use along side other throw together dinners.  For additional flavor, I use chive and onion cream cheese.  Update (2 days after cooking)Let the record state these taste great microwaved as well.

As if the cream cheese and sour cream weren't enough, I added cheddar to the mix, along with more seasonings and green onion. Just had to use up the rest of that cheese, so, during the last ten minutes of baking, I topped the taters off with some more. Soooooooo good. Thanks a bunch!

My partner and I absolutely loved these!  I used low fat cream cheese,fat free sour cream and topped them off with some fake bacon bits.  I had pretty big potatoes, so I used a little more sour cream and milk than called for.  Usually I put cheese on my twice baked potatoes, but these were so delicious, the extra flavor was unnecessary!

LATER DATE: I made them again by microwaving them for 18 minutes and then scooping out to make the mix.  When I put the mix back in, I baked them for 15 minutes at 375 to heat through.  They were still very delicious, but the skin wasn't as crisp.  Easier to scoop the insides, though.

UPDATE: In an attempt to save time, I tried these with a food processor. I just threw it all in there and let 'er rip for a few minutes. Most of you more experienced cooks probably already know this, but for the newbies out there, DON'T DO IT! They were just gross, like a glue consistency. Luckily, my partner will eat anything! Made the usual way, though, still the best potatoes I've ever had after my mom's!

Oh my stars....I thought these were great! Everyone loved them. I certainly didn't follow the recipe when it came to salt and pepper - I added these to suit our tastes. I made six large potatoes. I like these better than traditional twice-baked! I didn't add chives, or scallions, or bacon, or cheese, etc. - I felt they were just great as is!

This was the first time I've ever made twice baked potatoes and I know I picked the right recipe!  YUM! YUM! YUM!  I did add the cheddar cheese and chives--normally I prefer to make a recipe as is the first time out and experiment later, but these are classic potato additions.  You won't regret adding them!  ...Update: Having made these a few times, I now save a step by just placing the mashed mixture into a casserole dish and baking that way.  Sure, not quaint in appearance, but for busy cook's it's a tip worth using without losing the awesome taste!

Delicious.  Of course you could add the chives (or scallions) and bacon to top it off.  Thanks for the post.

REALLY good! Fairly simple, but delicious. I didn't do anything differently, except I had three medium-ish potatoes but I didn't really increase the measurements of the other ingredients, and it came out wonderful! I could eat a big vat of the filling all by itself! I'm not sure the paprika added anything to it, but it added some colour. I did cheat and did the first 'bake' in the microwave as I didn't have an extra hour to do them in the oven, and I did all the 'beating' in of ingredients just with a potato masher.

I made these for a bbq a couple months ago and since then, everyone has been asking for them for every bbq. its summertime and i've been avoiding the oven but i baked them the night before, fridged them as is and then cut and stuffed them the next day.  They were still fantastic and my cousin-in-law ate 7!!!  I sub shredded cheese for paprika and i also toss a layer of the cheese in the empty shell before i stuff it for a cheesy surprise.  Keep it simple!

Sorry mom!  The twice-baked potatoes I ate for all those years can't begin to compare to these!  My kids devoured them (even licked the beaters!) and my husband just raved.  Thank you for sharing this perfect recipe.

The sour cream was slightly overwhelming, so I would use less.  Other than that, very good.

I followed this recipe exactly except that I didn't put the filling back in the shells - I actually put it in a casserole dish and baked it that way. I also threw in some shredded Mozzarella cause I had some, and it sure didn't hurt it! I got rave reviews from the family.

The last few twice-baked potatoes I have tried have been dry and fairly tasteless, so my expectations were fairly low.  However, this recipe raised the bar for all other twice-baked potatoes.  We ate a few at dinner one night and had left overs the next day which we heated in the microwave.  Both were delicious.  The potatoes were creamy, smooth, and completely worth the calories :)

Good and creamy.  I added cheddar cheese and green onions.  I do have problems keeping the shells intact, so will bake the stuffing in a casserole next time. Thanks for the recipe.

These were really good, but they seemed to be missing "something".  I think they would benefit from a little bit of bacon and green onion mixed into the filling.  The cream cheese was a nice change from the normal sour cream and cheddar cheese mixture I usually use.  I made them as-written, except I tripled the recipe and only used 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of 9 ounces.  Also, prior to baking the potatoes, I rubbed them with olive oil and kosher salt to give the skins a little extra flavor.  We enjoyed these alongside Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs (from this site) and ice-cold watermelon.

a new favorite in our house. we had twice baked potatoes at a fancy restaurant in savannah and this recipe matches them perfectly. the only thing i did was add 1/2 cheddar and a few chives to the potato mixture, then when they were almost done i added some to the top. i also used a little leftover bacon and sprinkled some on the cheese. delicious.

Yes, these are terrific! It is also basically the same recipe as make ahead mashed potatoes. Just quadruple the recipe and forget putting it back in the skins.....just put it in a casserole. When you are ready to make dinner pop it (covered) in a 350 oven until heated thru.

What a great recipe! My only changes were to microwave the potatoes (made this recipe at the last minute), omit the paprika (family doesn't like it) and add about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to the filling.  I sprinkled some more on top before baking them.  Yum!

I made these for Easter dinner along with the ham. They were definitely a hit with everyone. I followed the recipe pretty much but added chopped green onions and cheddar cheese and topped with bacon bits. Was delicious.

Made these for Easter dinner. Great! I added some bacon, chopped green onions, shredded sharp cheese & a bit of homemade horseradish. Very good & creamy - unlike other recipes the cream cheese made this one stand-out!

Absolutely delicious. I had to substitute the milk for half and half because that was all I had. I also added a little cheddar cheese.  Made as directed otherwise and these were fabulous. I got a lot of compliments and will definitely make them again.

Twice-baked potatoes always seemed like a difficult recipe, so I never made them until now, and this recipe couldn't have been easier or more delicious.  I made these exactly as written and they were devoured.  Next time I will add bacon bits and cheese.  My only suggestion would be not to wrap the potatoes in foil when cooking, that can result in a slimey skin that is harder to refill with the potato mixture.

Added about 4-5 chopped green onions to mix; also added a handful of sharp cheddar cheese.   Topped with more cheddar about 10 mins before they were done.  Outstanding.

Surprisingly easy to do.  I found that using an avocado peeler to empty out the potatoes works perfectly.  I also rubbed olive oil and kosher salt on the potatoes before baking them directly on the rack.  A wonderful dish others were very impressed.

Very nice! I was very skeptical after I tasted a little of the filling before they were baked. It just didnt taste that great and I figured it was a failure..but after cooking- they were amazing!!! I will be making these for special dinners. I love that these can be made and stuffed ahead of time, and then just pop them in the oven when you are preparing the rest if the meal.

I chose this recipe specifically because it did not call for bacon or cheddar.  To me, that's a loaded potato.  I was skeptical about the cream cheese (not the cream cheese itself, but the amount.)  When I added it to my potatoes, I actually took some of it back out again, and then after realizing that there was nothing that I could do with it besides throw it away, I put it back in.  I even tasted it before I baked it and thought the cream cheese was overwhelming.  Well, to my surprise, these puppies came out of the oven tasting nothing like cream cheese!  It added great texture without adding a funky flavor!  Nicely done, Linda!  Five stars for you!

I didn't have Sour Cream so I substituted Ranch in place of it. Still very yummy! My husband liked it..which is very unusual! I also put raw bacon on top of the potato's and cooked it when it was time to twice bake it..25 minutes. Next time I will use sour cream, but the ranch was tasty too. Thanks for the recipe! Very yummy!

These were very yummy!  My 16 year old son made them to go with A Good Easy Garlic Chicken.  He added crumbled bacon and chives, omitted the sour cream and sprinkled the top with cheddar.  It was a huge hit with the whole family!  Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes are amazing!  I doubled the recipe when I had company over, and they loved them.  I didn't make any changes except that I was out of paprika, so I just melted a little shredded cheddar over the top near the end of the baking time instead.  I will definitely make these again, but likely always double or triple the recipe to make the work worth it.

I made these for a family dinner, along with the asparagus in balsamic butter sauce from this site.  Both were a huge hit!  I added chives and real bacon bits to the potatoes, and just a little bit more sour cream and about one more tablespoon of cream cheese.  I had 5 people for dinner but fixed 6 potatoes, my husband had the left over last night.  He said that he's never enjoyed a baked potato in his life (twice baked or otherwise) as much as he enjoyed these.  I've been told I'll be making these again!

DELICIOUS!  These were a hit at Christmas dinner!  Everyone loved them.  I never made twice-baked potatoes before, and these were pretty easy - I made 15!  Be careful not to spoon out the potato too close to the skin or the shell collapse.  Paprika was a lovely touch.  I think fresh chives would also be a nice touch of color.

Potatoes are a favorite in our house, and my husband RAVED about these.  He called it a keeper before I even asked him.  And he doesn't even eat cream cheese!!!!  I tried one other recipe and he could taste the sour cream too much (which he also doesn't eat).  This one the cream cheese lends a lot to the creaminess without overpowering the taste.

We added nothing to these in terms of salt, pepper, butter, sour cream, etc. once they were done.  They're perfect on their own.  They look beautiful as well so they are perfect to serve for guests.

I used fat free sour cream because that's all I had.  I also microwaved the potatoes instead of baking them in the oven in the interest of time.  It worked just fine - they were a little less firm but i could still scoop them out just fine.  I didn't use a mixer (yes I'm that lazy and didn't want to dirty more dishes) but just used a fork to "mash" them.  Worked perfect.  I'd recommend these to everyone and serve them at any dinner party!

Absolutely delicious!! I microwaved the potatoes for 15 minutes, then baked them the rest of the way and they still turned out wonderful and crispy with way less time in the oven.  I also split my potatoes in half to gut them (they were rather large) which made it possible to throw more toppings on there, including bacon bits and green onions.  Also added cheddar cheese throughout which gives it the perfect extra bite.  Thanks for such a simplistic yet delicious recipe!

I upped the butter and cream cheese a little because I used large potatoes, and added a little cheddar.  FABULOUS, though gluttonous and sinful.

I whipped these bad boys up and when I tasted the filling, prior to twice baking them, I was like OMG!!  YUMMY stuff.  I popped back in the oven to bake, sat down to eat, tasted the supreme goodness........and I was so disappointed..."where did the flavor go??"  I WILL make these again but I will NOT bake them the second time.

Very yummy & creamy! Perfect. Because I baked potatoes in foil, I just had to be careful when scooping out the insides. They turned out fine. I would like to try it again with chives & green onions for added flavor.

So Good!  I made these exactly to the recipe except I added cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon to the mix, and instead of paprika on top I sprinkled more cheddar.  I also found it easier to just cut the potatoes in half and scoop out the pulp that way...I had a hard time keeping the potato together with just the slit in the top.  I highly recommend this one.

Very good! Liked using cream cheese much better than the loads of butter, sour cream and milk I use in my other baked potato recipes...same creamy results but with the use of flavored cream cheese (i used onion and chive) it really added another level...delicious

Excellent!  I quadrupled the recipe for company and used a combo of whipped chive & onion cream cheese and plain whipped cream cheese.  I also used garlic salt and topped the potatoes w/ shredded cheddar before sprinkling with paprika.  I had so much filling that I put the extra in a bowl and baked it with the prepared potatoes.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Very good and definately easy.  I made 7 whole potatoes which resulted in 13 halves because the skin on one potato wasn't very nice. Because of that the remaining halves were nicely heaped.  I followed some other suggestions of rubbing the outside of the potato skin with olive oil before baking.  Also, I grated about one cup of cheddar cheese and added a little to the mixture and put the rest on top for the last 5 minutes.  I omitted the paprika.  These turned out really nicely and I'm looking forward to having the leftovers tonight for dinner again!  My husband loved them.

absolutly amazing as it is, my family also likes them made with onions, bacon, caramelized onions and/or different kinds of cheese mixed in there either one at a time or all together. if you make them out of baby potatoes they're great appitizers or finger foods.

I make this dish often because it sooo freaking good! I season my potatoes with lawrys season salt, garlic powder and black pepper. Then to the mixture I add some shredded cheese as well as the cream cheese. And I omit the paprika. YUMMMY!

These were good. I just think I expected better from the ratings it got. The only changes I made were to coat the potato in olive oil and sea salt before baking. I also added the extra shredded cheese like others suggested. May make again.

This recipe is so simple and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  I always get compliments when I make this for company- the recipe is easy to double.  I usually top with shredded cheese and sprinkle paprika on before serving.  Fantastic recipe!

This is a delicious recipe.  I added minced garlic & fresh chives to the mixture.  I topped the potatoes with paprika & a bit of shredded cheddar cheese.  I broiled the potatoes for a final few minutes to give them a nice crunchy top.

These potatoes had a wonderful tangy, creamy flavor; however, to really deserve 5 stars you need to do what I did. After stuffing the potatoes add some snipped chives (but just a little; they are strong) and shredded cheddar cheese on top before sticking them back in the oven.  Hey, after all the butter, cream cheese and sour cream you may as well go for broke, right?

I changed this up a little, I added bacon and a little bit of shredded cheddar, they were the best!  My neighbor and my guests really enjoyed them.  I also used cream instead of milk, very yummy!

These were absolutely delicious, and a huge hit for Christmas dinner.  They were very filling because of all the cream cheese, but overall very tasty!

Very good, very creamy...but if you add enough butter, sour cream or cream cheese to anything, you have creamy.  It could have had chives or green onion, maybe even bacon bits, but a delicous recipe!

I actually forgot the sour cream and they were still amazing! My boyfriend is kind of a picky eater and I saw him walking around the apartment after dinner eating one of the potatoes like hand food after we had already eaten a huge dinner!

I added a cup of broccoli and shredded cheddar to the filling and more shredded cheddar to the top of the potatoes before baking..........turned out wonderful! Needed additional baking time though...about 15 more minutes.

Perfect - simple ingredients, easy to make and delicious.  I added a bit more cream cheese (maybe an ounce or half ounce more) out of measuring laziness, and will probably continue to do so on the theory that more cream cheese = better.

This was awesome!  I brushed the potato with a small amount of oil and garlic powder (which I think really helped with texture and flavor).  The potato was so easy to carve after an hour of cooking.  It was then done perfectly after 20 mins.  I will make again.

These are so great! They might take a while, but if you're pressed for time you can always start them before hand and then throw them in the oven later on. That's usually how i do it anyways since i only have one oven and i usually need it for the main dish.

Made these tonight and followed it to the T.  They were EXCELLENT!  My family of picky eaters (yes, I even have some who don't like potatoes) loved them.  I was tempted to melt some shredded cheese over them, but didn't & just sprinkled the paprika.  Perfect!

Great flavor and you can add your own personality to these to suite your taste buds. What I love most about these you can prep in advance and than bake later. Thank You for Sharing

These were superb! Perfect recipe as written, but flexible enough to add your own variation. I chose to follow this exactly as written and I am so glad that I did. As much as I love cheese toppings, these potatoes offer a subtle cheese flavor which would go well with any main dish. Easy, delicious, versatile, beautiful presentation, suitable for all taste buds, economic, ......What more could you ask for? This recipe is now one of my household favorites which will be made again and again. Thank you so much for posting this ten star delight!

I made this last night & it was really good, a nice change from plain baked potatoes.  I used lowfat sour crean & lowfat cream cheese, and added some cheddar as some have suggested.  I also added more salt, some pepper & garlic powder.  I will definitely make again.

These were easy to make, and freeze very well. I just threw the frozen ones in the oven for about 45 minutes on 350 and they came out great! Thanks

these were ok. i had a very difficult time scooping out the centers withoug the skin breaking. i used the microwave to bake them but i had to keep putting them back in becuase they wernt done enough. kind of a hassle. i will try baking them in the oven next time, hopefully that will be eaiser. flavor was pretty good

Very delicious!  I was looking for a recipe for baked potatoes that tasted like the ones at some restaurants, and this is it!  I've made them with and without green onion as well, both are yummy.

I made these for the superbowl and got rave reviews. Everyone wanted to know how they were so creamy and flavorful. I cute them in half and did the half skin thing because of the setting. I added one package of hidden valley ranch seasoning and omitted any salt because of how salty the seasoning is. I also added a little white pepper.  I topped with mexican cheese blend shredded cheese and some chopped green onion.  They were amazingly good.  I will deffinately use the recipe again!

These were PHENOMENAL! I didn't add cheddar cheese as some reviewers did (and I really don't think they needed it). The only thing I think I'll do differently next time is that instead of only cutting a sliver off, I'll got them in half. I followed the portions and ended up with a TON of filling - I didn't want to waste it so it ended up spilling all over the top. I think if I'd cut the skins in half, I'd have a bit more wiggle room with the filling.

So creamy!!!  I pretty much followed exactly, but made this for an 8 person dinner party, so my proportions may have been a little off.  Everyone gobbled them up.  I added gouda cheese to the mix and sprinkled a bit on top.  I also mixed some garlic powder and sea salt with olive oil and brushed the potatoes before I put them in the oven.  Delish!!

Okay....YUM! I have tried other recipes on this site and this was BY FAR THE BEST ONE! I followed the recipe mostly. The only things I did differently were: *I cooked the potatoes in the microwave first because I was short on time - worked out great! *I added some scallions/green onions, but only a few, that was very yummy. *I topped them with some shredded cheddar cheese.   Everyone was absolutely in love with them at Christmas dinner, as was I. They were so creaming and sooooo tasty! Definitely give this recipe a try!

I made these tonight and they were supreme! Nice and crispy on the outside, and really creamy and delicious centers. I added chives to the recipe and they were so good, Not difficult at all to prepare. Will be making them again very soon.

Made this for a weekend get-together.  It was a definate hit.  I'm not one to follow a recipe real close.  I doubled this recipe, added 8oz cream cheese instead of 6, and also topped it with cheese.  I think next time I might include some bacon bits, or a cheesy surprise inside.  But all in all, very good basic recipe with alot of room to manipulate for personality.

My boyfriend absolutely goes nuts for these!!! I usually double the recipe and add a little shredded cheese to the mixture.  I usually have more mixture than potato shells so I just bake the mixture in a glass dish for the same amount of time recommended. I recently served at a family dinner and every drop was gone.

Very yummy!  Even my picky kid (one of them, anyway) loved it, once I told her it was just mashed potatoes in a new package!  It's worth taking the time to bake them in the oven rather than microwaving them - the skin is soooo much better!

Simple, creamy and delicious.  Yum!  I baked my two large potatoes in the microwave for 10 minutes and the let them rest for five before cutting them open.  Followed the recipe as provided from that point on.

We loved these. I also added shredded cheddar cheese but you could probably add anything you like on your baked potatoe.  More work but worth the effort.

I have nothing to add to the other reviews (I also added shredded cheddar and chopped green onions) except that my dad, who is a baked potato man, absolutely ADORED these. So did my brother and I, and we do not usually like baked potatoes much.

Easy to make, and taste great. My kids loved them and wanted seconds. Needs some kind of seasoning, but I can't figure out what yet.

I have a house full of teen age boys so I needed something that would go far and re-heat nicely.  I cooked many potatoes, amending the recipe to fit the number of potatoes, and it was a huge hit.  I did add cheddar cheese.  I cooked enough that they were stored in the fridge and re-heated as the boys wanted more. (just throw them in the microwave to re-heat) Perfect!  They are asked for over and over.

much better than plain twice baked potatoes! I also added garlic.  You could add cheddar,bacon or chives but I thought it was great without.

I made these to go with the Potato Salmon Patties recipe from this site. This was my first time making twice baked potatoes and I will definitely be making them again for how easy they were. Less time consuming than mashed potatoes but a similar effect. I baked the potatoes in the microwave which worked just fine. Added garlic, salt and black pepper but still felt these could be improved with more seasoning. I will probably add some chive or green onion next time.

This is an excellent basic twice-baked potato recipe. For my taste, in the future, I will add cheddar, green onions and/or bacon for zest.

My boyfriend and I thought these were delicious.  My pickey eater kids said they were ok but that is normal for them unless it is pizza or something like that.  I mixed in some leftover bacn and cheddar cheese but I am sure ikt would be just as delicious without those add ins.

These were a real treat.  A little time consuming but always a crowd pleaser.  I always double this recipe, as I am typically not cooking for 2, and the recipe is easy to increase to accommodate however many you are cooking for.  Excellent with steak and some type of green.

This is the first time I made twice-baked potatoes. I like the bite from the sour cream.  Mine were a little on the dry side, maybe because I did not use a mixer?  Still very good.  Thanks!

I needed to let these cook a tad bit longer than suggested, but the recipe was great and the potatoes turned out wonderfully. I'm going to try them with a chive cream cheese next time.

Another labor-intensive side, but this was completely worth it!!! Followed northlake-kat's suggestion of no foil, and rubbing in olive oil and garlic - this made for perfectly crispy skins! Instead of paprika, I used Penzey's Black & Red.  Added some garlic.  Topped with Low-Fat Cheddar and green onions.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  We used Jalapeno cream cheese (Einstein Bagels) and it jazzed up the flavor.  I will be using this again to freeze and eat for snacks or lunches by experimenting with different cream cheese flavors.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

My family enjoyed these. I made the filling just as stated, but did add green onions and cheese on top. I felt it was a good base filling, but I would probably add more fillers next time - maybe green onions and cheese inside the filling, and maybe even some herbs. But this is a great place to start and was very easy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very YUMMY!! I liked the change from sour cream to cream cheese. I did mix some of the shredded cheddar into potato mixture and then sprinkled the rest on the top and sprinkled bacon bits and baked for another 5-10 minutes until cheese was melted

Yum Yum Yum Yum! Made with a filet mignon and we had a restaurant worthy meal. Only things I did differently- I added a little cheddar and fresh chives from my garden. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but not amazing, I added some garlic powder to give the filling some pop but next time i'm going to have to put something more into it because it still was a little on the bland side.

I served these with the Bacon Roasted chicken from this site. After the potatoes were baked, I added cheddar cheese and the bacon from the chicken on top, then baked a few minutes more. I noticed my dinner guests finished their potato FIRST so I knew it was good!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe to a tee, with the exception that I used lite cream cheese, lite sour cream, and skim milk.  I also set the cream cheese out while I baked the potatoes so that it would blend in easier.

Before cooking potato, grease potato and roll in sea salt/kosher salt.
I skipped the milk doubled the salt and added fresh cracked pepper, sharp cheddar cheese and green onions. Mmmmmmmm

These were amazing.  I think one of the main thing is to actually bake it, not cook it in the microwave.  I added cheese, chives and bacon.  Fabulous!

I tried this recipe and was really impressed on how easy it was to prepare. I omitted the sour cream in the recipe , my husband doesn't like it but supplemented it by adding more milk. I also put in some crumbled real bacon bits into the mix. I used about 6 slices of cooked bacon for a recipe of 5 servings.( A hint on the bacon- cook it extra crispy, cool down and put it into a gallon size ziploc bag and crumble it that way , it saves your hands and clothes from all the grease.)

Wonderful recipe!!!  I used cream cheese with chives and topped with cheddar cheese.  I served this for Mother's Day Brunch, so I made a large portion and placed in a baking dish rather than in the skins.  Prepared the night before and brought to room temp before baking.  They turned out perfect and everyone raved over how delicious they were.

Very yummy.  Did 5 potatoes and only used 2T butter but 6oz. cream cheese and used garlic salt.  put american cheese on top during last 10 minutes in the oven.  
Be careful not to pierce the bottom of the potato skin when scooping out the flesh.

I served these alongside the Baked Chicken Nuggets from this site and they were very well received. With only 3 people in our family, I need ways to use up a 10 lb. bag of potatoes! This recipe fits the bill. It's not hard to make and the filling has a nice, creamy texture with great flavor. My husband especially loved them. We will be making these again! Thanks for the recipe.

Phenomenal!  Made these to go with Valentine's Day dinner and they were just awesome.  Had some leftovers and my husband brought one into work and shared it with some co-workers, had to give them the recipe.  Aside from handling hot baked potatoes, these were perfect, everyone loved them.  I used light cream cheese and lite sour cream.

I was looking for something other than mashed or reg. baked potatoe; this was perfect! Very Yummy!  Whole family loved.  I was unsure of the paprika seasoning but it was delicious. Last 15 minutes of baking I added grated med. cheddar cheese on top.

Made it for Christmas dinner according to directions.  I did rub EVOO and kosher salt on the skins for baking the first time.  Added extra tastiness to the skins.  Excellent and easy to do.  Allocate enough time to gently scoop out the potatoes - it does take a little patience!

Delicious!  This is a very easy recipe but yet it looks like it took alot of effort to make.  Very creamy and tasty!  My family truly enjoyed them.

Perfect!  The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes before I put them back in the oven.

This was really yummy. Next time I am going to use only 2 ounces of cream cheese and add Parmesan cheese.

These baked potatoes were awesome! Did everything the recipe called for with the exception of adding chives and cheddar cheese when mixed everything together to put back into the potato skins. Garnished with a few extra chives.

Great baked potatoes! I doubled the recipe, and added shredded cheddar cheese to them; both in the potatoes and on the top. This is seriously the best I've ever had, and my guests were melting!
