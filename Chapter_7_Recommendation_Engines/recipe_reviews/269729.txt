I didn't have fresh broccoli so I used frozen. I think it would have been better with fresh because the frozen was a bit mushy. I'd make it again but I'd double the pesto & add more bacon. Thank you for the recipe.

As I didnâ€™t have Cavatelli y used Orzo and it was also great. Very easy and so tasty.
