Absolutely love the flavor of this sauce!  I served it over my baked chicken chimichangas and it was amazing.  All adults and kids at the table loved it!  This will be a staple in my house (and freezer).  I did use a whole jalape√±o because I like it spicier but that was my only change.

This was a hit!   I add choizo  and served it during brunch with floor torillas and there was scrambled eggs people eat it as a breakfast tacos.  Loved it!  I bet its great on Chicken.  Will make it again for sure.

This was great on chicken. Can't wait to try it on beef.
