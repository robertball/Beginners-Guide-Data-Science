Very good!  I added some garlic when I sauteed the onions.  I also used probably another cup or so of broth b/c it was too crunchy after recipe's amount was added.  I seasoned it with some extra thyme.  I cooked the asparagus IN the chicken broth and added some lemon juice after cooking for a little freshness.  I also added some chopped parsley right before serving.  YUMMY!  Would recommend and will make again!

This will probably be my "go-to" risotto recipe from now on. It was very good and is just a simple basic flavorful recipe. I did add some garlic, as another reviewer mentioned, to the onion. The only other variation was that I roasted my asparagus with a little olive oil and lemon and then added it to the risotto at the end. I find that roasting really brings out the flavor of asparagus. Thanks for the recipe, Stephanie!

I've made this twice and although it tastes a little bland, I'm giving it 4 stars because I like that it is not as rich and high in calories as some risotto recipes that use heavy creams. The consistency is nice. I like to add a bit more parmesan when it is served. I saw a similar recipe on another web site where they add fresh rosemary, and I'll try that next time. I'll also add more asparagus than is called for, as I'd like a bit more in the mix. This recipe makes quite a large amouunt! Mmmm leftovers.

This dish was very good! Tasted richer than I expected given the reasonable amount of oil. I recommend using small, tender asparagus for best texture. It served 4 people comfportably with bread and salad.

Best risotto I've made to date. The asparagus added such a great flavor. I did everything according to the recipe, except I added some baby bella mushrooms and a few minced peperocini peppers for a kick. ...but the asparagus remained the star of the dish. Thank you!

My first time making risotto and a few observations: It took a long time. I had to add 2+ additional cups of broth because the rice still had a crunch after the original amount. Stop when it's a little more liquidy than you want because it sets up as you are getting everything on the table (so mine was a little thick). I added the garlic and rosemary as others suggested. Everyone really liked it! But it is WAY to salty even though I used low-soduim broth. Too salty in taste and the next morning my fingers were swollen. If anyone has any suggestions, because I would love to make this again... Is there a no-salt broth? Can you use water for some of the broth?

This was my first time making risotto and I loved it!  Super simple.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of rice but it took a quart and a half of chicken stock to do the trick.  Also added portabella mushrooms and garlic with the onion in the beginning for extra flavor.

I made this recipe on Easter Sunday to go with lamb and it was a big hit.  HOWEVER, I cooked it longer than the recipe called for by 20-30 minutes AND added an additional cup of broth and an additional cup of wine.  It was YUMMMY!!
This one's a keeper and nice enought for company.  Thanks good cook.

This is a great risotto recipe! My husband and I made this tonight and paired with some herb crusted swai and it made a great dinner.  

I made just a couple of changes.  First, I broiled the asparagus in the oven for about 10 minutes with some olive oil, salt and pepper because I like the flavor broiling creates. 

Second, I thought I had enough arborio rice, but I only had two cups.  I still used the same amount of asparagus, onion, and olive oil. I actually increased the amount of chicken broth to 9.5 cups, the white wine to 1.5 cups, the butter to 2 tablespoons, and the parmesan cheese to 1 cups.  Except for the chicken broth, these changes were all based on personal preference.

The 9.5 cups of chicken broth was a necssity because my risotto was not ready after adding all 7.5 cups. I have found when making risotto that the amount of liquid used can vary based on the maker so I wasn't really surprised that the recipe and my experience did not match.

Lastly, I added about 1.5 tablespoons of herbs de provenc to mine so it would blend with the fish.

I plan to roast some mushrooms to add to the leftover risotto tomorrow night.  I love mushrooms but my husband hates them so I have to wait until he goes out of town and then I can eat the risotto based on my preference.   They will fit in perfectly!

Good but I've had more flavorful risottos.  Added mushrooms for flavor, probably could have used some thyme as well.  Also I tried to cook the asparagus in the risotto at the end which didn't work so great.  Next time I'll cook the asparagus ahead of time like the recipe states.

A great, simple risotto! Be aware, have extra broth ready to go! I needed about 50% more broth than it called for and it took me about 45 min to cook it. I served scallops over top that had been seared over butter. A Valentine's Day hit for the hubby!

This was an awesome recipe! I added sun-dried tomatoes (dried variety, not the oil-packed ones) along with cubed, cooked (bbq'd) chicken, the sundried tomato flavour was outstanding!

This is a good low-fat  risotto recipe.  I like that you can substitute different vegetables or broth depending on what you have available.  I added a bit of rosemary to the onions as well as 2 minced garlic cloves.

Great recipe. I added an extra cup of chicken broth as the rice was a bit hard. I also mixed in a bag of fresh spinach which cooked right in the risotto. It was delicious. This is going to be a frequent dish in our house!

This was the first time I ever made risotto. I found that it took a lot longer than 20 minutes to get the risotto fully cooked & also had to add more broth than the recipe calls for. The consistency was a little too thick and the risotto a little too crunchy for my liking.  Also I think the Parmesan cheese ruined the taste. I loved the asparagus in the risotto however & will definitely try again, leaving out the cheese.

I cut the serving size down to 9 and followed the exact quantities for that service. It did the calculations accurately! I served 5 with plenty left over. A bit more parmesan cheese, but thats based on personal preference. Great flavor and consistency! Thanks for posting!

I followed the recipe to a "T"!  To me, it tasted like bad rice pudding.  Look at my other reviews, I very rarely post a negative review.

This is just what I was looking for.  I added chicken, garlic and precooked carrots.The carrota gave it some color along with the aparagus.  Served it with garlic bread.  Was a hit.

I can't believe I've never tried to make risotto before this! Very good recipe. I was surprised how much flavor came out of such limited ingredients. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1 extra cup of broth and a clove of garlic to the sautéing onions. So delicious, even my rice-hating husband cleaned his plate! Thanks!

This is a delicious dish!  Like many, I had to add a little extra liquid, about 1 cup.  I sauteed garlic with the onion and added chicken, mushrooms and capers at the end with the asparagus.  It made a great one-dish meal, and I will make it again!  Looking forward to leftovers for lunch!

Hey, Sunny! I did it! This recipe was pretty straightforward, which I was thankful for. I used the broth from my ham that I boiled up and froze earlier that week and ham bits that I strained out of the broth. I followed the instructions completely, only omitting any extra salt because I knew my ham broth would be salty enough on it's own. I had no issues, this turned out wonderfully. I was SO proud because this was my first ever risotto. And the combo of the ham and the asparagus was out of sight. This one's a keeper. (And the husband ate grilled cheese last night. He dosen't like asparagus, so this was all mine. *evil laugh*) I DID IT. Thank you for this recipe.

This was great, but I think putting pieces of asparagus in risotto was a little strange mixture of flavors.  I steamed my asparagus in my vegetable steamer, until crisp-tender.  I added a tsp. of minced garlic when sauteeing the onions (needed it!).  I ended up using another can of chicken broth because the rice was still crunchy (the trick is to cook it slowly!).  I omitted the butter at the end (just didn't think it needed it), and added 1/2 tsp. salt + 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  It is the third risotto I have made in the last week and this one was the best.  As with most recipes, I followed it exactly as listed, but added a little more Romano cheese.  I didn't read the reviews until after I made, but may roast the asparagus next time.

This was a good recipe. Both my wife and I enjoyed it. I have had better but my opinion is a little biased since the first time I had Risotto with Asparagus was in Florence, Italy.

I think with practice this will be really good. My rice wasn't as creamy as I've had before but that was execution, not recipe. I sauteed garlic with the onion and then added a little thyme, rosemary, and garlic powder (garlic lover!) and doubled the amount of asparagus. Next time I will roast the asparagus for a richer flavor. I think it definitely needs a lot of spice/seasoning--if not it was really bland. LOTS of salt was needed also.

It was a little time consuming, but good.  I roasted the asparagus (along with white mushrooms) with some olive oil, s&p, and herbs de provence.  I also added some porcini mushroom and shredded chicken.  The flavored porcini broth I also added to the risotto during the cooking process.  I finished the recipe with a touch of truffle oil.  I did not use any butter.  This recipe was served with some chicken breast.  Definitely a winner.

I prefer more creamy risotto so added 1/2 cup more cheese. I sauteed the asparagus (cut in bite-size) in olive oil & lemon juice. Still wish it was cheesier/creamier but still very yummy. I didn't use the white wine but did add 8 1/2 cups chicken broth.

Very good, used long grain rice but needed to cook it maybe 10-15 min longer for it to soften, plus used 1/2 cup more water

I thought this was very good. Unlike other reviews, I did not need to add extra chicken broth. 7 1/2 cups was the perfect amount. Added garlic and crimini mushrooms to the onions.

Great Recipe!  Followed the recipe to a tee.  I might add more parmesan next time (but I'm a bit of a cheese-head).

This was very good.  I had risotto for the first time the other night at a resturant.  I came home and immediatley hit Allrecipes.com to find a recipe.  This was very good.  I added a small amout of sauted spinach with the asparagus and it was yummy.  Will be making again and again.  One thing I did find though. I reduced the recipe size from 12 servings to 2.  The new recipe then called for 1 1/4 of chicken broth.  This did not work for us.  I continued to add chicken broth until the dish was cooked through and I would image that the amount of chicken broth actually used was closer to 3-4 cups.  But, I had plenty of chicken broth and just continued to heat in a seperate pot and add some as it was absorbed until the dish was done.  We ate it all and now a little disappointed that I didn't make more so we would have left overs.  I see this dish as being a regular on our dinner table. Also, I see this as a fantastic way to incorporate more veggies into our diets.  Next time I will be adding more veggies to this dish.

I have made this many times and find it to be an excellent recipe. I have never had an issue with running out of broth. I sometimes substitute 1 cup of broth for an additional cup of wine as I enjoy the wine flavour in the dish. I also add some garlic to the onions.

I added mushrooms and a little tomato sauce to mirror the flavor in the grilled marinated shrimp that we topped the risotto off with, and it was perfect. Wouldn't change anything, thanks!

This is a good basic risotto recipe.  I left out the asparagus and added garlic to the onions while cooking.  I also added another 1/2 cup white wine and 1 cup of broth.  It took about 20 extra minutes to cook until the rice wasn't too hard.

Terrific recipe.  In the past I have not been a big asparagus fan, but this changed everything!  Very rich and filling, and could be a main dish rather than a side.  The Abrorio rice and white wine are must haves to make this recipe special. I added extra parmesan too!

I had never worked with Arborio rice before, let alone made risotto before and I found this recipe relatively easy to follow.  I added chopped broccoli and spinach to it and everything was perfect, but I feel like the rice was slightly undercooked.  Next time I will cook the rice longer (this will require more broth) and I'll probably add a couple spices/herbs just to cut the relatively bland flavor slightly.  Very easy (although it does require constant attention) and relatively quick for a fancy-looking meal that is sure to impress.

This was my first attempt at risotto, and it was amazing. Thank you! I made a third of the original recipe, and it did require more liquid- probably about 4 cups for 1 cup of Arborio. I did not boil the asparagus but sauteed it. I also sauteed some bay scallops to add to this and also added a clove of garlic to the onions. I even forgot the parmesan cheese at the end and hubby still said it was the best thing I've made- and he loves my cooking! Delicious and will definitely use again and again. Thanks!

I think the rice required more time and broth.  After twenty minutes, my rice was still very hard.  Unfortunately, I had used all of my broth supply and could add no more.  I added water for about ten to fifteen more minutes and it still was not al dente.  I just may be bad at making risotto - I think I needed more patience.  The flavor was very good, even if the texture was crunchy.

Very good!  I sauteed asparagus and some sliced mushrooms in the saucepan  (separately and then set them aside) and used extra white wine to deglaze before starting the rice.  I think this really infused a lot of great flavor.  I thought I would end up needing more broth when I was almost out at 20 minutes the rice was still not fully cooked but I it turned out perfectly (took almost 30 min. total).  And of course...I had to add garlic!  Huge thumbs up from the boyfriend- will definitely make again.

This was SO good!  My husband loved it, and he usually things risotto is too cheesy.  Per previous suggestions, I roasted the asparagus with olive oil and rosemary instead of boiling it, and I also added mushrooms and turkey bacon.  We're definitely adding this to the regular list, and it's worthy of serving company, also.

This was my first attempt at making risotto at home, and it turned out very nicely (if I may say so myself).  Just before adding the first cup of broth I set the timer for 20 minutes - this kept me on track and made for perfectly cooked rice.  I'll try using mushrooms next time.

This was excellent. My family raved and raved about it. I did not add the asparagus into the risotto as my family doesn't like asparagus, so I roasted it and served it as a side to the asparagus.

WAY, WAY too much wine for my tastebuds in this. I think even 1/2 cup would be too much. Despite cooking it enough to evaporate all of the alcohol, I think the wine flavor dominated everything else in the dish and it spoiled the risotto for me. Also, I think it needs more than 1/4 cup of parmesan.

This was my first attempt at risotto. I gave it 4 stars because it was a little bland, however it was still nice and ease my fears on making risotto. I will make this again I just need to tweak the seasoning to my family's taste. Also, I halved the recipe and still had quite a bit left.

This was delicious and far easier than I imagined "risotto" would be for a first attempt. I added some fresh mushrooms with the onions and minced garlic right before the wine. I didn't pay attention to the quantity when following the recipe so my husband and I had plenty for leftovers the next couple days and it was just as good as the first day! Next time I have to cut the recipe down to serve 2.

This was a good recipe. Though, I think personally, I was not very good at making risotto, or perhaps used the wrong kind of rice. It didn't get too creamy like risotto should be. That being said, it was still quite delicious. I would say most of the fault probably lied with me. Would definitely try it again.

I'd never made Risotto before and this recipe was great! I ended up halving the recipe since I was only making it for 3 people and there were still plenty of leftovers (and it was just as good the next day).  I took the advice of several other reviews and added a couple of cloves of garlic and I used more broth than the recipe called for to make it a bit creamier.  Overall I was impressed - I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

i halved this recipe and used canned asparagus instead of fresh and added some additional spices (garlic in the saute phase and black pepper to season at the end).  it turned out absolutely delicious!  next time will make the whole recipe for more leftovers!  ;)

This was wonderful.  I made it the first time on Sunday when I had guests over for dinner.  Everyone loved it!  I did add 3 cloves of garlic to it just because we love garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was super easy and really good!  I needed more liquid though, then what was called for, to get it the texture I like.

This is very easy and satisfying.  I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.

I made minimal changes to this recipe other than adding chopped sun dried tomatos along with the asparagus.  It was creamy and flavourful, and made a nice accompaniment to the swordfish I grilled.  I served it with additional parmesan cheese to sprinkle over the top, and I think it benefited from the extra bit of flavor.
