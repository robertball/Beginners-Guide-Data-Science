Great recipe! I took the advice of other raters and cooked it 30 mins covered and 15 mins uncovered to make sure it was done--it came out just right! I added a little extra milk (which I substituted for wine) for a little bit of a thinner sauce which worked out well. Preperation takes about 20 mins, but after that it is easy enough and tastes great! Thanks for the recipe Lois!

This was a FANTASTIC version of Cordon Bleu! We love curry, so this dinner was enjoyed by the whole gang. I always double the sauce, no matter what I'm cooking, but I used Golden Mushroom and roasted garlic soups, omitted the salt (soup has enough) added garlic and onion powders and used more curry then called for. I double breaded the chicken and placed them in the fridge for about thirty minutes so the crumbs would adhere better while frying. I also used my Fry Daddy to save on time. I too sauteed my mushrooms and then placed them on top of the casserole. Thanks so much Lois; I only wish there were leftovers!

This recipe was OK but I found the Chicken Cordon Bleu II found on this site to be much much better.

Don't pass this one by! After 15 yrs. of marriage & countless chicken recipes, my husband just declared this the "best thing checken he's ever had."  Here's what I did: DOUBLE the sauce.   Beforehand, saute fresh, chopped mushrooms & onions in butter. Add this and extra garlic salt, curry, and white pepper to taste.  After rolling & frying the chicken in the cheese & proscuittio, place it over cooked angel hair in a 9x13, then cover with sauce.  Cook at 300 for 45 minutes. Perfection!!!  Trust me!!!!

Very good! I read through the reviews before making, & made some changes. Didn't have any paprika or curry on hand, so I just left out. Used Italian style bread crumbs, roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, & milk instead of wine. I let the chicken sit for about 1 hours after breading, made for much easier time browning. I added enough sauce to the bottom of the pan to cover, then baked for 1 hour (chicken was on the larger side). Last 5 mins, uncovered and added 1 slice of cheese to each chicken. I tossed egg noodles with remaining sauced and then topped with the chicken. Will make again, everyone enjoyed!

I really like this - fancy/easy with simple ingredients.  I thought it would be too much with the cream of mushroom soup - I removed this from the sauce ingredients completely - and other modifications included using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and red wine (all I had on hand) instead of white.  I browned the chicken on all sides before putting in the oven, and increased the cooking time to 30 minutes.  Turned out really good!  Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe for the family, and my son said "I have to know how to make this!".  The one most important trick is to prepare the chicken with bread crumbs at least 1 hour before browning the chicken.  Just make ahead and wrap in plastic, put it in the fridge and let the bread crumbs have time to settle.  This makes them stick when browning before baking.  Delicious!

Extremely tasty and fairly simple! The whole family loved it.
For a better presentation I baked the chicken in a small amount of sauce in a dish sprayed with cooking oil. Then heated the sauce on the stove top and poured over the chicken before serving it and garnished with fresh parsley. Just a simple but cleaner "presentation".

Husband says this is the best thing I've ever made! Must say I did do some modifying. Used smoke Gouda cheese, which was amazing. Just be sure your ham is not smoked. I think that may be too much smoke. I also used cream of chicken soup and milk and no mushrooms, as this is what I had on hand. Also, I did bake this for 30 mins. covered and 15 mins. uncovered.

I just realized that I had previously rated the wrong Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe. This is the one I normally use, with a few changes. I leave out the mushrooms and curry powder, and use cream of chicken soup to make the sauce. This is one of my husband's favorite meals.

This was awesome!! The chicken was so tastey and the saucey was excellent. I only did two chicken breast since it was just my husband and I but did the same amount of sauce. It was perfect. Had a little bit of sauce left over and saving it to add to some cooked rice......excellent taste and true explosion of great flavors. Thanks!!

This was tasty.  I followed most of the directions as stated but I doubled the sauce. In reading the reviews I changed up the cooking time. I cooked the chicken covered in the oven for 30 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes and it came out great.  I will definitely use this one again.

I don't care too much for curry, and my husband doesn't like mushrooms... But we both thought this dish was REALLY good. It was a change of pace from regular chicken cordon bleu- a keeper for us!

Pretty good and easy to make.  I didn't realize how fattening this dish is until I prepared it myself.  Not sure if I'll make it again.

Instead of the rolled effect, I fried turkey cutlets,layed them on top of the sauce and then layered the ham and cheese. Covered with foil and baked until cheese was melted and everything was heated through. I used 2 cutlets with ham and provolone, and 2 with ham and cheddar. Used reduced fat mushroom soup, omitted the curry. Family enjoyed this.

Great!  I just didn't have the time to do all the steps for the chicken. I just took 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper on both sides, browned in 1/2 Tbl. butter, transferred to a baking dish sprayed with Pam, added the ham and cheese slices on top of each breast, then covered with the sauce (I used fat-free half-and-half instead of sour cream, and added 1/4 tsp. salt to the sauce). I baked it (covered) at 350 for 25 minutes, then baked it (uncovered) an additional 10 minutes. Much, much easier, and very good! Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter was close to tears, after proudly trying to prepare her first meal for her boyfriend.  The recipe did not state  the chicken was to be fully COOKED in the skillet until done, only browned.  She removed it from the oven, and it was raw.  Not everyone is an expert chef.

This is an excellent dish!    The flavors were great throughout the chicken and sauce.  I did saute my mushrooms before adding them to the sauce in a little margarine and garlic salt.  I made breadcrumbs out of herb stuffing instead of my usual Italian crumbs- turned out perfect.  Since my chicken breasts were on the larger side, I did have to cook it for 30 minutes to get the whole breast cooked.  This chicken went well with a small side of wide egg noodles with the sauce and green beans.

After following the directions and serving the meal to my family we all took bites of half raw chicken.  Another 40 minutes at 350 and the ckicken was no longer pink.  The sauce calls for far too many mushrooms and I would suggest half the amount of wine.  Not sure why there is any call for curry as it didn't seem to contribute to the flavor at all.  I'd look elsewhere for a nice Chicken cordon bleu recipe.

Really enjoyed this dish and was quite easy to make. Didn't have any curry or wine but it didn't seem to matter.  My husband doesn't particularly like mushrooms so I think the next time I might omit the mushrooms and use cream of chicken soup.

This was pretty good, but next time I make it I will tweak it a little. I wasn't that fond of the cornflake coating, so will just breadcrumb it next time, and will also use chicken soup in the sauce instead of mushroom. Will also saute the mushrooms in a little wine before adding. Apart from that I love it the way it is, and serve this with a lite salad for a meal.

FANTASTIC!  I'm super paranoid about underdone chicken, so I baked it for 30 min with the cover on, and another 15 min with cover off.  Not a bite left and I've been begged to make more!!!  (I used stove top dried stuffing instead of breadcrumbs too)

Me & my husband loved this recipe!  I only made a few changes because of what I had in my fridge at the time.  I used portabello mushrooms instead of regular mushrooms, I added onions and fresh minced garlic to the inside of the chicken as well as the sauce and used mozerella cheese instead of swiss since I'm not a big swiss fan.  My husband raved about it.  We normally wrap chicken up with various things, but the sauce for this recipe was out of this world and definately made the recipe!  Thank you.

I made this recipe as directed except instead of using breast halves I used thin sliced breasts (bought by accident). I made them by folding the breast in half, stuffing it and closing it with toothpicks. They turned out wonderfully and I plan to make these often. I read a few reviews about the chicken not being cooked enough on the stove, maybe it was because I used the thin sliced meat, but this was not an issue at all for me. They fried up beautifully and the sauce was really great over egg noodles. Being new to cooking I'd like to let you know that I didn't find this recipe hard and it tastes good enough to give you a real sense of accomplishment when you set it on the table! :) Happy cooking all!

LOW CARB VARIATIONS: I cut the flour down to a bare minimum and substituted wheat germ for the bread crumbs... it gives the crunch without the carbs.  (I also added some dried parsley in the wheat germ for flavor/color.)  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk which made a big difference in the flavor without the added carbs.  I had no swiss cheese, so I used provolone, which was perfect.  A radical departure in the sauce to reduce carbs still yielded excellent results: I completely omitted the cream of mushroom soup, but rather sauteed the mushrooms in butter and then wine and poured over the chicken to bake.  Delicious!

The only changes I made was to use the shake and bake parmesian crusting (was easier for me) and 1/4 cup sour cream.  The first time I used 1/2 cup and that was a bit much for me.  The sour cream taste was too strong.

This was good.  I suggest you saute the mushrooms lightly with some sliced onion.  To keep your chicken crispy, don't pour the sauce over it while baking.  Just set the chicken on top of the sauce,which is like a stroganoff and goes well with wide egg-noodles.

I used this recipe for a business dinner and it turned out great.  The boss loved it so thats all that mattered.  If your a novice cook like some of the reveiws I've seen than it might be wiser to start out with something a little bit more simple.  I would loveeeeee to cook this more ofen just for me and hubby but he needs to watch his sodium intake.  Thanks for a great dish, I could not have thought if it on my own, but thats why we go to allrecipes.

We thought this was pretty good.  I had to change the sauce quite a bit since mine turned out really thick initially, I added more wine and a little milk.  (I ended up adding too much, and added flour to the sauce at the end to thicken it up a tad).  The sauce was okay, but we both felt maybe it was unnecessary calories (wasn't incredible enough to warrant adding it).  We both thought it was great, though, and I will probably make it again without the sauce for a more crispy traditional cordon bleu.  Thanks for an interesting twist! :)

I liked the recipe overall. I substituted finely ground Townhouse crackers for the bread crumbs. However, I did not care of the sauce much. Next time I am going to omit the wine and add the mushroom soup to a roux and add everything else listed for the sauce. Cooking sherry might work better... Also, if you roll up the chicken, ham and cheese and place them in the refrigerator the day before you need to cook them, you will not have to seal them with toothpicks.

This dish was a HUGE success at my dinner party last night.  In the confusion during preparation of all the courses I accidently forgot to add the sour cream and sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  By the time I noticed this the sauce was already spread over the chicken so I just added the sliced mushrooms over the top and dropped the sour cream all together.  The result was still wonderful and having the mushrooms on top made a really nice presentation.

For those who may care what I served this with: I started with the Roasted and Curried Butternut Squash Soup.  The main course was served with rice pilaf, steamed broccoli and the Almond Mandarin Salad on the side.

I made this dish last night for my boyfriend and he raved about it as do I.  I used low fat sour cream, milk and cream of mushroom soup and didn't notice a difference in the taste or consistency of the sauce.  Also, instead of regular American ham, I used proscuitto which added more flavor.  This was very similar to a dish I used to make long ago and have since lost the recipe, so I was very excited to try this.  Thanks so much!

I noticed that some folks are doublng the sauce. They may not be covering the dish and the extra sauce may be making up for the oven evaporating the juices. This recipe seems to work best if the dish is covered prior to be placed in the oven. I timed it for 45 minuets for the juices to run clear and the covered pyrex lid kept the dish from drying out. The sauce was sufficient.

This was an amazing recipe.  The sauce was so perfect.  I had trouble rolling the ham and swiss in the chicken, but it wasn't anything a few toothpicks wouldn't take care of.  My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about how great this was, especially since I told him I don't cook.

This was GREAT!  My husband doesn't really like mushrooms but he LOVED this recipe.  The chicken was very tender!  I will make it again!  The only thing was I had only a 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.  So, I added crumbled saltines and mashed potato flakes ...... it worked great! Next time I will saute the mushrooms and add onions.

This recipe was delicious!  Even my picky two-year-old daughter was saying hmmm! while eating it!  One suggestion, for those of us not experts at cooking is to stick a toothpick into the chicken once wrapped, and break off the end, so you can turn it in the pan to brown on all sides evenly.  Don't forget to take the toothpick out before eating it!!

WOW This was an excellent recipe!!! Much better than any restaurant or caterer I have ever tried...the breading was yummy, but it's the SAUCE that really makes this recipe!! I tried using a bit more oil (1/4 cup olive, 1/4 cup canola) to fry the chicken, and used a dutch oven to reduce splattering. I will make this recipe again and again for special days and birthdays!! Oh yeah...i also used 2 slices ham and a long slice of swiss...made it harder to roll, but it was worth it. Toothpicks come in very handy : )

cream of mushroom soup mix is okay but try to stick to more fresh mushrooms like porobello.  30 min is perfect baking time, but do not exceed.

The chicken was GREAT, however, my family did not like the sauce.  I did put the sauce on the bottom with the chicken on top like other reviewers suggested and I'm glad I did, that way the sauce wasn't on top of the chicken.  I will make this recipe again without the sauce.

Great way to use up left-over ham and mashed potatoes after Easter.  I took alot of previous suggestions and doubled the sauce, made sure the chicken was thin enough to cook properly and didn't pour sauce OVER the chicken, rather placing the browned meat ontop of sauce to bake.  Didn't have mushrooms or parsley, but the dish was a success never-the-less. I used one can of Cream of Chicken soup and one can of Mushroom gravy along with the sour cream for the sauce.  All I had on hand in the pantry, but in worked.  Great with mashed Potatoes and steamed Broccoli on the side.  My husband really liked this one,,and he can be rather fussy @ times, as he is a good cook himself.

Round #2..........Still yummy. My son loves this without the sauce.....so I bake the chicken in the oven, after browning, and do the sauce on the stovetop...that my hubby and I totally enjoy as a topping.  Very good flavor.

Simple and impressive!  It's now one of my husband's favorite dishes.  The sauce is an excellent addition.  I made twice the amount and served it over mashed potatoes.  Will be part of my family's meals for years to come.  Thank you for sharing Lois!

Excellent!! I didn't have bread crumbs so I subbed crushed Ritz. I also used cream of mushroom garlic because we are garlic fans. And I didn't add curry. It was the best, I will make this often!

Absolutely Fantastic! This was sooo YUMMY!!!!  I am so glad I picked this recipe.  I made it with red mashed potatoes and they were perfect together.  This tasted even better as left overs the next day.  I wasn't sure about the curry powder, but man, it really added a lot of flavor. I will make this again soon!

The sauce was not saucy at all but globby and dry.  Enjoyed the chicken but would add about a cup of milk next time.

This was pretty good, better than the last chicken cordon bleu I made.  The only thing I changed was to sub. chicken broth for the wine and added no fresh mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand.  I served with this mashed potatoes and it was a decent meal.

The sauce is delicious. It added to the richness and had great flavor, especially with the wine added.  The chicken itself was pretty good and I used italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.  I also used 1/2 chicken cream of soup and 1/2 chicken cream with herbs.  Very Good!

This was the best meal I ever made with chicken. My husband was thrilled cause he's not a real chicken eater. I added double the sour cream by mistake and it still came out excellent. I cannot tell you how good this is!!!!!!!!!!

I love this recipe!  My husband loves it!  I have made it three times so far and it has never failed to impress our dinner guests.  I usually thin the sauce out a bit by adding more wine.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the best chicken recipe i have got from the internet. It was delicious.

The only thing i did that was not mentioned was i wrapped a cooking twine around middle of chicken after i rolled it. May not have been necessary but  thought this would keep it nice and round when i cooked it in skillet.

Hands down one of the best cordon bleu recipes!  the sauce is so easy and so delicious.  I will definitely make this again and maybe try it with prociutto instead of ham.  Excellent - will definitely make for company.

This was VERY tasty and a breeze to make. I will make it again. Why it's called "saucy" is a bit of a mystery to me as mine didn't get nearly as saucy as its "saucy" title implied it would (to me anyway). However, quite yummy nonetheless!

Wonderful!  I've prepared it 3 times in the last 2 months.  Love the sauce!  I did have to adjust the baking time a lit, but I think my chicken breasts were a little thick, so they required more cooking time.  Even my 2 year old loves this!

I really loved this chicken.  I have served for dinner party's and get tons of compliments on this dish, but it is very hard to get the chicken to stick together with the stuff inside.  Enjoy!

Amazing dish! I've made it twice already - once as a "practice round" and the other I was entertaining my family. The first time I followed the recipe exactly (only omitting the mushrooms, my husband and I aren't too crazy about them.) Everything was wonderful that time around, but the next time I still opted to change it up a bit and use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. Still delicious!!
The sauce has such a wonderful consistancy and taste. I actually even caught my dad when he was finished eating in the kitchen scraping sauce out of the cooking dish!!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I had made a simple Chicken Cordon Bleu before and it was good but even then I thought it was a little dry. The mushroom/wine/soup sauce was to die for and it went well with a ranch/white wine salad dressing I made for a baby spinach salad perfectly! Thanks so much for the recipe, this will definately be a repeat make!

I could not get this to work, because I could not get the chicken pounded flat enough and had to bake for an extra hour or so.  By that time I was so fed up I did not want to eat it.

This recipe overall is fairly difficult to prepare- not something for a busy mom on a busy weeknight. However- it is extremely tasty when done. The addition of sour cream to the sauce was an excellant move- and i used cream of chicken instead of mushroom for those who don't like mushrooms. You will also need toothpicks to secure the meats and cheese together to fry them before baking. I also noticed that if you don't use the wine in the sauce i would recommend substituting half a cup of milk to give the chicken a little more sauce to bake in.

While the chicken itself turned out great, the sauce needs a bit of fixing up.  I thought it needed to be "saucier".

Pounding meat is such a hassle.  It's messy and gross.  For an easy, family-style (less mess) version. I cut large boneless breasts into 3-4 cutlets, use the paprika/salt/pepper flour to coat (no milk, eggs, breading, etc.) and brown. Then I make a casserole with shredded ham slices, and top with swiss cheese, then sauce.  Bake 20 minutes.  Not as impressive a presentation, but tastes great and much easier.

I made this one with vegetarian "chicken" and "bacon" and it was fantastic. Very delicious sauce! Try it with Pinot Noir.

This recipe is DELICIOUS with a few minor changes.  First, after rolling the ham and the cheese into the chicken breasts, I used toothpicks to hold everything together while frying it in the pan and while cooking it in the oven.  Second, the sauce comes out delicious without the sour cream (which is way thick and rich, not to mention the calories....) just add a little water and wine to the cream of mushroom soup instead of the sour cream.  Enjoy!

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating because it makes an absolutely beautiful presentation, it's easy, and the breading rocks.  The sauce I wasn't overly impressed with, however.  After all the raves and standing ovations other reviewers wrote about, I was a tad disappointed.  The flavor is okay, but not overly savory, and it's so rich we could hardly finish our servings.  I will absolutely use the breading again, but the sauce I won't make again.  I'm glad I tried the recipe though, thanks for sharing!

This was a very easy cordon blue. We did not have curry, but did not notice it missing at all. Loved this recipe and will make again.
