The dough was so much easier to make than I expected. It was actually fun to make and it turned into a really hilarious family event to see who could make the worst shaped bun! We are FAR from professionals in this house so it was really entertaining for us to try and make these look even remotely normal. After we let them sit and after steaming though, they really did look like it was done by someone who knew what they were doing. I changed up the filling and used ground pork with sauteed onions and cabbage, sesame oil and hoisin sauce and it came out great! I will definitely make these again!

Havenâ€™t made it yet ... so to make the 12 dumplings , you would need 2 steamers? Or do you cold proof the other six in an alternate container ? How does that work ?

REALLY READ THE RECIPE! I planned on making this for dinner and didnt notice the 2hr then 45-60minute waiting steps. So i was cooking until 10pm and had to scramble a dinner for the wife and kid together. Other than that it tasted great and was pretty easy to put together. The only change ill make next time is to do a pulled or shredded pig instead of diced.

Super recipe, very easy to follow. Just be sure you follow the steps regarding the cooking/steaming process. Let the buns prove in the cold steamer, and allow them to sit for 15 minutes after steaming with the heat off. You can really personalize these by making your own filling.

Very pleased with how this recipe turned out. Soft chewy buns just like the shops in Chinatown do and a great hack making the filling with pulled pork. The cooking times were spot on and the left over dough cooked up well the next day too.

Easy to make, harder to fold the wrap but I bet that just takes practice :)

As recommended the buns were very bready on one side and very thin on the other.
