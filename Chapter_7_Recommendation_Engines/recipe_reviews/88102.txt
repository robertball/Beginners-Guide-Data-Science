Followed with suggestions made by emerald - added onions, skipped the green onions, used fresh garlic.  I used already cooked shrimp that I thawed and removed the tails, I just added long enough for the shrimp to get warmed before I added the fresh parm.  We loved this recipe.  It smelled awesome, looked tasty and TASTED TERRIFIC!!!  Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who loves seafood and pasta!

Made this for an "Under the Sea" potluck at work today.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I just eyeballed the ingredients.  Rave reviews, and have given out the recipe several times.

Pretty good- a little bland. I added more garlic, fresh basil, and more salt.

This is my recipe -  it is one of our favorites.  Using the freshest ingredients is the best!  I use only fresh grated Parmesan or Asiago cheese to stir in at the end!  Feel free to mix it up with different veggies and/or use bowtie pasta (or your favorite pasta).

I followed the recommendations of others and left out the green onions and added chopped onions.  I also used bowtie pasta and grated some mozzarella on top before serving. I can see why others might say that it is bland.  Next time I make it, I will add more spices and probably extra garlic.  Delicious!  Between 4 adults and 3 kids, there were no leftovers.

This recipe was amazing.  My family and I really enjoyed it.  I used Italian Seasoning instead of the dried oregano and basil.  I also used some sweet onion sauteed before the squash and the juice of a lime instead of lemon.  We love olive oil so I drizzled some over the cooked pasta before mixing in the shrimp and squash.  It was delicious!

This was good, but it was a little bland.  I think adding cheese would brighten it right up.  We have dairy allergies in my house so we couldn't try it.

Great recipe. Leftovers were even better. I didn't have chives or scallions so I used a few chopped onions when cooking sqash. Thi will beome a go-to recipe.

Very nice light summery meal!  I added 1/4 c white wine because i wanted a little more liquid for the pasta...also used a chopped yellow onion instead of chives, just personal preference (threw it in with the squash).  It gets 5 stars because it is SUPER easy and quick, and tasty and healthy!  (And a dash of red pepper flakes do give a nice kick!)

This is amazing!  I loved how light and fresh this tasted. The lemon, herbs and garlic all blended so wonderfully together.  I added red pepper flakes to create some heat.  This was so so good!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is a GREAT base recipe! For those who thought it was bland, try adding a whole onion, a few cloves of garlic, double the spices and some black pepper. We did this and it was restaurant quality. I also stirred in chunks of mozzarella cheese at the end and the way it melts gave a delicious texture to the dish. So with these adjustments, its a 5-star! Thanks Grumpy's!

This was great!  I only had yellow squash, and I also had no lemon so I increased the white wine and added extra garlic.  It's a great recipe to play with depending on what ingredients you have on hand.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.  Thanks.

This isn't bad.  Needs more salt, but is a decent choice if you are trying to watch your diet.  I will make it again, but not all the time.

Good base recipe.  I added white wine and chicken broth to make a sauce for the pasta.  Next time I will increase the spices and maybe add some red pepper flakes for some heat.  Great way to get my kids to eat zucchini and squash!

I have a 2-yr old so most of my cooking is done in the middle of the day during nap time so I've learned to partially make things so they can be thrown together last minute for dinner.  I added onion to the squash (which I cut back on) and sautéed it ahead of time.  When it was time to eat I sautéed the shrimp for 3 min then set them aside.  I put the squash mixture, fresh basil & parsley, some grape tomatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes in the same pan I cooked the shrimp in and deglazed it with the lemon juice and some white wine.  I threw in the pasta and shrimp and tossed it to make sure everything was heated through.  I will definitely make this again.

Healthy and quick to prepare.  But the flavor is very subtle.  We added cajun seasoning to our plates - that would increase our rating to 4*.

It was very good. Make sure you don't overcook the veggies and follow the times as given.
I added a bit of wine and it was fantastic. 
A quick delicious meal! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent light tasting pasta dish. Added 2 tsp. minced garlic to oil before adding zucchini. Also added diced onion and mushrooms. Very fresh tasting but not a whole lot of depth of flavor, so added some crushed red pepper for a little kick. Would experiment with adding a little white wine or additional herbs next time.

I followed this recipe exactly and I think it was excellent. Maybe not a whole box of noodles because it was a lot of pasta, but the flavor was very light and good!

When my husband saw I was cooking this he thought I was sick because I don't cook food like this.  Then with his first bite he said yummm.  If he likes it, it's a hit.  I used real lemon squeezed juice not out of a bottle.  My son also loved it.

Great, light and satisfying summer meal! I thought it needed a bit more flavor so doubled the salt and added a bit more spices.

I added cherry tomatoes - they are in the photo but not listed in the ingredients.  I also added some corn and mushrooms and increased the shrimp to 1 1/2 lbs.   In the end it looked like it was going to be too dry so I added some pats of butter.  I made it for company and everyone liked it.   Don’t be afraid to modify the Veges - next time I may try adding some broccoli as well.

Made a few modifications: used the yellow squash it calls for, but replaced the zucchini with broccoli (which I sauteed before the other stuff because it's so much firmer).  I also used the chewier al dente Gemelli pasta instead of the Penne.  And finished the dish with both Parmesan and Gorgonzola.  I also think I'd use more dried herbs next time for more pronounced flavor.  Would definitely make it again.

I  thought this was really good. I was out of onions and had no chives , so I added a little sliced bell pepper .  Next time I'll add a bit of smoked paprika. Maybe a little Italian sausage too!

Yummy.  My husband catches lots of shrimp here in Charleston so I'm always looking for different ways to serve those little critters.  This was very, very good and not heavy with cream.  Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. I have to cook the squash and zucchini longer as my family likes it that way, but other than that I follow the recipe.  So light and fresh and healthy - great summer meal!

This is delicious! I usually add at least 3/4 cup of lemon juice and about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese in order to create more sauce for the pasta.

We have been making this for a while and the whole family loves it, even my 3 year old.  I don't add the onions and I don't keep fressh Parmesan so we just use the pre-grated stuff in a jar.  This is always a great quick meal!

I started off with sauteing some sweet onions with the squash and zucchini.  The dish ended up very good and the b/f loved it.  Although I found it to have a very strong lemon flavor, especially in the veggies.  Maybe it was because I used fresh squeezed lemon juice...not sure.  Next time I might try using white wine instead of the lemon juice.  Still tasty though!

I was surprised by how good this was--the flavors are subtle yet interesting.  Hubby liked it even though it didn't have a heavy sauce.  Of course, I couldn't just make it as written.  Per others, I added an onion (actually started with sauteeing the onion), a nice addition.  I stacked the deck by using a lemon-infused olive oil, and I only had zucchini on hand.  Loved it!  It's on my replay list.

This was good! I used whole wheat noodles to make it healthier and it turned out well!

My husband and I loved this. I used pre-cooked shrimp and put it in just long enough to get warm. I also added asparagus and snap peas, but left out the chives. I will be adding this into the regular rotation.

This was really yummy. I, too, added a little diced onion and instead of penne I used bowtie pasta (what I had on hand) The only other addition was some red pepper flakes. Thank you for a "keeper" recipe. Next time I think I'll try this with chicken and add some mushrooms!

For a lighter recipe this was surprisingly flavorful.  I used whole wheat penne and fresh herbs.  I also added the onion in with the herbs instead of putting them on top as I prefer my onions cooked.  I will be making this one again.

Made this for hubby's birthday last night and it was great AND light!! The prep time took longer than 20 minutes however. (Took closer to 35 minutes!) Changed up just a few things.  Put in 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp instead of just a pound.  Also I used fresh basil, left out the salt completely and used 1/2 cup of lemon instead of 1/4. (I freshly squeezed the lemons - makes a huge difference!!)  It was wonderful!! - oh and I cut back on the zucchini and squash!   We both loved it and I'll make it again for sure!!  Thanks for sharing!!!
