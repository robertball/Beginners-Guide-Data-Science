Lasts several weeks in the fridge. Could not find White Balsamic Vinegar, had to use dark, tasted fine, maybe not as pretty though.

I really liked this recipe.  I made 1/4 of recipe as i did not need too much.  Still had left overs from side dish. I served with grilled chicken but would be great with tilapia or fish tacos.  I am from texas so added more jalapenos but only because they are mild now in winter.  Also added another tomatoe (4 if it was full recipe).   Might have been size of romas though.   I think the fine dicing is critically important.  Am thinking of adding cabbage to this recipe and serving as slaw with some additional tweaks.  Very good and a bit different than the norm

Excellent recipe - thank you!  It was so nice to be able to find a good salsa recipe that you can freeze.  Our garden produced tons of Roma tomatoes this season so we were looking for a recipe to be able to use them.

This was really good, I did not use the amount of salt  indicated, in act I used very little, that may have been a result o my not having found Jicama in our two grocery stores in town, I used granny smith apple in place of the Jicama and it added the right amount of tang. I would make this again, with or without Jicama.

Really tasty, a little bit sweeter than typical pico. Watch out, it makes a ton...enough for a VERY LARGE party! I cut the ingredients in half second-time-around for a better amount-result. Subbing Anaheim's for the poblano chiles was good, too. Jicama and the balsamic are the 2 keys to this fantastic recipe!

Awesome pico....have been making this for several months.  I sized it down to 8 servings which makes about a quart.  It keeps well in the frig for at least 3 weeks (the longest we have been able to keep it).  We absolutely LOVE it and put it on absolutely everything!  I have a 'nicer dicer'' which cuts all the ingredients into tiny little squares.   So sorry I didn't rate this earlier because it is the best!
I make a quart every 2 or 3 weeks!!
Thank you jeffandrobyn.............we find white balsamic here in south Texas at our HEB grocery store!!!

This is a fantastic pico de gallo!  The Jicama stays crunchy forever, and absorbs the flavors of the other ingredients. I make half the recipe, for my family of 10, and serve it up in place of "jar salsa" when we have "make your own taco" night. Everyone loves it, and I hardly ever have leftovers. Everyone consumes the rest by scooping tortilla chips in the bowl! Although there is a lot of chopping, the final product is worth every bit of it.
