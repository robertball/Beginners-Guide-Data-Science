If you are looking for something different, that is going to be a real crowd pleaser....look no further!!!

This is an excellent recipe and a great one for BBQ's (where the food sits out) or if you have to make something and travel with it.  No mayo- no worries.

I stuck with the base recipe but would suggest 2 things:
1.  Plunge the green beans into ice water after you steam them so they retain their beautiful color.
2.  I added chopped, wonderfully ripe, tomatoes, and black olives.  Really added great color and flavor!

The dressing recipe has a terrfic flavor to it----best served after several hours of marinating or even overnight!

After reading everyone's reviews, I think I perfected the recipe. The trick is to use the same dressing amounts (although I did increase the garlic by 2 cloves) but to double the potatoes and basil. I only increased the green beans up to 1 lb, but I also added 1 lb. halved cherry tomatoes. I used a medium red onion instead of small. It turned out wonderful and I received many compliments. It is better after sitting a long time. I hope this helps!

This was excellent!  I used more of the beans from my garden, along with three red potatoes, green onions (because I didn't have a red one), and rather than all basil, I used an even mix of fresh basil and dill.  I also added about 1/2 C chopped red pepper for color and more sweetness.  The flavors combined with the dressing were wonderful.  I took the advice of one reviewer and I made this about an hour before dinner, and then after mixing everything, I let it sit at room temp. for that hour.  The flavors melded perfectly.  SO GOOD- I will be making this again soon!

I served this for a family gathering and it was a huge hit.    My only comment is that potatoes will not get tender in 15 minutes.   Plan on 25 to 30 minutes and cook the beans separately in the microwave.

I just loved this and enjoyed every bite of it! I boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes, added the beans, then let it boil another 5 minutes - both the potatoes and the beans were perfectly cooked and retained their vibrant colors.  I don't much care for balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar in its place. I also used green onion rather than red as I like its mild, fresh flavor. I added the dressing while the potatoes were still warm and they just soaked it right up.   And, reminiscent of a dish I enjoy in Rome, I added sauteed shrimp (there they also add calamari and tomatoes).  I served this at room temperature along with "Stuffed Mushrooms with Spinach," also from this site, to accompany our Stone Crab Claws feast.

My guests like this salad a lot and ask for the recipe.  I make it ahead of time so the flavors can meld and sprinkle freshly made crisp bacon bits on it just before serving--I love the results.  This is an especially nice salad for a an outdoor meal since we don't have to worry about it sitting out too long.  Thanks!

Good way to get a potato salad without the chance of getting sick from it sitting out for long.  It has good flavour and definitely needs to sit overnight for the flavours to blend.  The only change was to add a little extra garlic.  I gave it only four stars because I did find one better potato salad recipe here, but this one still is nice.

Excellent change to the traditional potato salad - My culinary students and I added 3/4 cup of Miracle Whip to fill the missing flavor gap. Everyone really liked this recipe.

If my husband loved it, it rates a five star.  Period.  ("Food snob.")  My kids and I really liked it, too.  A few changes that I don't think really made a difference on my rating: served cold rather than warm/hot ("potato salad" should be cold!); used raw beans instead of steamed (for no reason other than it seemed like it would work just as well).  The main change: I ran out of balsamic and substituted red wine vinegar.  It was great this way - I'm convinced it will be even better with balsamic.  Definitely will make again and again.  Served with "Crispy Fried Fish" and "Wisconsin Native's Beer Cheese Soup" - both from this site.  (Although, I give the soup a lower rating.)

I have made this potato salad before, years ago, but since my family doesn't care for potato salad without mayo, I added some to this recipe and let it sit over nite.  YUM  
Both tangy and a little creamy, and you control the creamy!

best served warm or room temperature the dressing ( for me) tends to get too gloppy after its been in the fridge. if I made this for a party I would use white wine vinegar and it wouldn't  turn the potatoes brown.

This is a killer salad!  Readers who thought this was bland need to remember that you need to heavily salt the potatoes and green beans separately when they cook.  Also, salt the ice bath for the beans.  I used the baby potatoes and steamed them as well as the beans.  Flavor is not lost in the water.  I added the cherry tomatoes and black olives which made a pretty presentation.  As far as the dressing, I did cut back on the oil and only added a little at a time so it's not swimming in the dressing.  Make a day ahead, refrigerate and when ready to serve remove from frig and let it come to room temp. for several hours.  Delicious!

Potatoes and pasta are the two things that when I make them I do heavily salt.

LOVED this!  The only major change I made was to cut the olive oil in half (seemed to solve the "too much sauce" problem other users had), and it was delightfully acidic.  Subbed yellow onion (didn't have red) and soy sauce for the worcestershire sauce... perfect summertime salad!  Best overnight!

This is a great salad for a summer meal.  In a pinch, you can use frozen green beans and add them to the boiling potatoes for just a minute to thaw them out, then drain both veggies and continue on with the recipe.

Fairly tasty; gets points for healthy ingredients.  However, 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar is way too much.  Cut back to 2 Tbsp. or even less.

We really like this non-mayo potato salad just the way it was first posted. The flavors are right on. I've made it for a couple of parties and it was very well received. I do like the suggestions of a cold water bath for the green beans to retain bright green color and the addition of bacon once in a while.

Sorry but I was kinda disappointed in this one... Followed the recipe exactly and although it came out "okay", it was far from great. Something in the dressing ingredients is off. I think it was way too much olive oil and the balsamic was a bit over powering as well. We liked the idea of mixing the green beans in with potatoes and onions, but the dressing needs work. Maybe someone could "tweak" this into a five star recipe and post their findings here for the rest of us???

I don't think it's particularly fair to review recipes having made changes related to personal preference so I'm giving the basic recipe a 5. I doubled the potatoes and green beans, but used a single recipe of the vinaigrette based on the recommendations of other reviewers. It was perfect. Doubling the vinaigrette recipe would have added way too much liquid.  I sautéed sweet onion with a few slices of chopped bacon and added to the potato/green bean mixture because I'm not a fan of raw onions. The salad is delicious and I'm excited to take it to our Labor Day picnic tomorrow!

Delicious! Used dried basil since I didn't have fresh on hand and added a Tablespoon of sugar to the sauce since my balsamic was too tart but that's not the fault of the recipe.. 15 minutes was not quite long enough on the potatoes so will cook longer and will substitute red wine vinegar for the balsamic. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!

We LOVE this salad.  Like others have said, definitely needs to sit overnight after you make it.  Also: Either halve the dressing or double the veggies.  Prettier with white balsamic.

I used potatoes, green beans, and basil from my garden.  The lemon juice was from my tree's lemons and the olive oil was from a neighbor farm.  I did cut the balsamic vinegar down by  half per other reader's suggestions and refrigerated overnight.  It was perfect!

My husband liked it, but I was not really impressed with it. Didn't like flavor so much and my potatoes were not firm. Will try it again though, because it still looks appetizing.

I really enjoyed this salad; it's nice to have a potato salad without all the mayo.  The flavors are really great and it tastes even better after sitting overnight, but I have to agree with others that there is too much of the dressing.  I'll probably cut the dressing in half and use the same amount of potatoes/green beans next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe many, many times and haven't changed the recipe at all. It is one of our favorites to bring to picnics, potlucks and dinner parties. It is also a geat way to use up the avalanche of green beans from our garden in the summer.

I liked it! It definitely needs to sit in the fridge and probably could use a little less dressing as others have mentioned. I think we put a little extra mustard and worchestershire sauce and a little less vinegar. Served with feta, yum!

I just wasn't that crazy over this salad. Love the combination but thought maybe the white balsamic vinegar would make it more eye appealing, almost too much dressing. I think I could almost double the recipe but keep the dressing the original amount. I was disappointed. A little too tart for me. (I wish I would have read the more current reviews. For sure, I would have doubled the veggies or maybe not made it).

My daughter and I didn't care for this. I made it exactly as listed and it may just be our taste, which is why I hate giving it a low rating, but I need to be honest. There was too much dressing, which is the part we liked the least. Potatoes soaked (which is how it tasted and what happened as it sat for a bit) in vinegar is not tasty. It might have been better if I roasted the potatoes, but it's not something we'll be trying again.

Pretty cool, subtle flavors, but I feel like there was something missing...maybe more worcestershire, maybe some Italian seasonings?  Would love to try this again, but remember to taste the dressing and play around with it before adding to the potatoes.

Excellent autumn dish - a little less dijon mustard (it sort of overtook the flavor of the basil and garlic).  I definitely recommend either using less of the dressing mix or more potatoes and beans.  I threw some chopped spinach in to make it a little healthier and add a bit of color.  Otherwise a good, quick, recipe.  Oh, and second time around I would add sungold cherry tomatoes.

My family asked that I never make potato salad with mayo again!  This was sooooo good.  I did cut back on the amount of olive oil, but that was the only change. No need to fear taking on a picnic or to a BBQ, excellent hot, cold or room temp.

Other than over-cooking my potatoes :( this is fabulous!!  I think the dressing alone would be a great recipe!  Like some other reviews, I added FRESH halved cherry tomatoes (had hundreds to use up).  If I had to give one negative critique, it would be that I think there was a TAD too much dressing (I even had more potatoes and beans than recipe called for).  So if you're a little short on oil or Balsamic - still go for it!!

This is a terrific & healthy potato salad. I added sliced carrots to steam with the beans, a drizzle of molasses to the dressing, and threw in a can of rinsed kidney beans to the finished salad to make it a complete meal. Delicious!

The flavor of the mustard seems out of character.  The next time I make this I will delete it.  It might be better prepared with a german potato salad dressing and served warm.

I wasn't sure about this one, but the result was absolutely phenomenal! On the advice of a friend who made a similar recipe, I modified the sauce a bit. I used extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic from a jar, fresh lemon juice, fresh basil, and just a splash of balsamic vinegar (I added this to taste). The garlic and basil really make this, I think. This is the only way we eat potatoes now!

Very good.  I scaled back to four servings. Even so, I felt it might be too much oil and vinger for my tastes.  I just used a drizzle of both.  I also added salt and pepper.  They go a long way in this recipe, in my opinon.  Ingredient like tomatoes, olives and red peppers might be a nice addition.

A wonderful potato salad alternative for picky family members that don't like mayonnaise.  It's very close to an old Bon Appetit recipe that I used to make years ago and can no longer find.  It's great for summer parties and healthier than regular potato salad.

I will definitely make this recipe again. Only change would be to cut the potatoes a bit smaller so the dressing absorbs into the warm potato. Two helpings for my husband who declared it "a keeper".

I made this as written with a couple of exceptions: 1) not liking the taste of balsamic vinegar, I used red wine vinegar instead. Same quantity. 2) I used fresh green beans which I blanched  quickly beforehand, leaving them slightly crunchy because I hate mushy canned vegetables.  The salad came out very well, perfect for a hot summer side dish. The dressing wash perfect. Thanks for sharing.

My apologies. This review was placed by mistake. IT was for a different recipe.

The combination of green beans and potatoes was one I never thought of for a salad.  This was great for me.  I'm not a fan of the leafy stuff.  Yes, I did change it up.  I used dressing for a German potato salad. 1/4 cup white vinegar,1/4 cup olive oil,2 tablespoons sugar,1 tablespoon dijon  mustard,1 teaspoon salt,1/2 teaspoon pepper,
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley.
Then I threw some bacon pieces on top.  Left overnight in the fridge it was just what hubby and I wanted on a hot summer day with a side of ribs.

People, if it’s too “tangy/sour,” for you, add some honey like I did. Taste the dressing before mixing it in.  Also, if you have a rice cooker with a steamer basket, cook chopped potatoes in an inch of water and steam the green beans & onion in the basket. Done in 15 min. when recipe is cut in half.

I followed some of the reviews and doubled the potatoes  to 3 lbs.  . Per suggestions I  did not increase the amount of dressing and didn't even put it all on. Good thing because I thought the flavors were very strong- I did use an excellent Fustini  balsamic but perhaps too rich of flavor.  The next day I actually rinsed off the left overs and used as a base for a skillet meal with bratwurst slices and that was fantastic!

The ingredients seamed to be a good combination of flavors.  I doubled all ingredients for a group, including the dressing.  Unfortunately the dressing completely overpowered the vegetables.  I had to rinse off a portion of the dressing to make it work.  If I were to remake this, I would not double the dressing and just add it to taste.

I used only 1/8 C of white wine vinegar  so the potatoes wouldn't turn brown nwhich  I found in someone reviews and it was plenty. I use 1/2 of a medium size onion and the next time i will use only 1/4 of a medium onion which would probably be only 1/8 of a cup. The mustard, olive oil, and basil amounts were fine. I had to cook the potaoes a full 15 minutes and some of them could have cook more. Next time I will cokd them 20 minutes. I must be using larger red skin potatoes than the original recipe which would account for the time discrepency. The salad was delicious just the same. But I do not like raw onions so for me less is more.

I made this for dinner and it was wonderful.   I did have to make a few  substitutions based on what I had in the pantry - frozen green beans for fresh, white balsamic for regular, 1/4 tsp mustard powder for the Dijon, and Penzey's Sunny Paris seasoning because I was out of basil and I had used that seasoning on the chicken I grilled to go with the salad. I added thinly sliced baby yellow peppers and tossed them in with the dressing for some color.  Due to time constraints, I microwaved the potatoes until barely tender and chunked them up straight into the dressing while the beans cooked in the microwave and then chilled in ice water, and I was only able to let it sit for about an hour and a half at room temperature but even without the time for the flavors to meld it was fantastic.  I don't usually rate a recipe if I made any changes to it, but in this case I have enough experience to know that the original recipe would be fantastic as written!  And ignore those who think there's too much dressing, if you put the potatoes in hot it soaks right into them, the dressing is perfect!

If you're smarter than me, you'll not obey these directions and cut up the potatoes before cooking them. I don't understand why you would direct people to cut up boiling hot potatoes, and why I'm a sucker to fall for it.

This recipe had great flavor.  I poured the vinaigrette over the warm potatoes, so, the sauce soaked in and was so tasty!   I think I would reduce the olive oil a little in the future because the green beans had a slight oily texture.  Overall, a very good dish.

Great alternative to mayo.  I used about 1 lb. of mixed potatoes that came in a bag of purple, red and white.  I used farm fresh yellow and green beans.  I even measured the ingredients.  Yummy!

This wasn't very good at all. Too oily, too much vinegar. I let mine sit in the fridge a few hours hoping the flavors would blend, but it was still very disappointing. After reading reviews, I decided to add some Miracle Whip as a last resort. It helped a bit. I'll stick to a mayo based salad from here on out.

I added yellow and orange sweet peppers. I only had a netted bag of gold potatoes and didn't add all the sauce. Next time add all the sauce. Also used basil paste and it stayed on the bottom of the reserved dressing. A little too oily. Cut back on the olive oil. I also steamed green beans in the microwave for 3.5 mins and put them in cold ice water. Poured dressing over potatoes while the were still warm. Hubby said next time not so many  veggies or more potatoes. Darn. I love my veggies.  I had to add more salt after marinating overnight. Great idea for a pot luck or BBQ. UPDATE. Added leftover grilled Italian sausage and it was yummy. It could be a one bowl summertime meal.

I was anxious to try this recipe since I'd just picked some green beans in the garden. After making it, I thought it had too much of a balsamic taste for my liking. I'll try making something like this again, but with a different dressing.

It's a stand alone meal if you stick to the recipe on it's own, however, I decided to bump it up a bit.
I fried up the red onion with some Italian pancetta bacon, and after everything was combined, I crumbled a bit of feta cheese on top for a bit of salty flavour.

My husband and I really thought this was good.  It was a little too tangy for us so next time I'm going to try using half the vinegar and lemon juice but otherwise it was really tasty.

It makes too much dressing for the designated veggies. Also, the dressing was sour. The red potatoes were still raw after ten additional minutes.

Here's my prelimonary rating...4 stars I want to see how it is after the flavors blend... However, before I forget... here's how I made it. I doubled the potatoes and green beans, used only 1/4 of the raw onion (because we can't eat too much raw onion in my family), added 1/4 of a red pepper (that's all I had), and added some onion powder to compensate for using less raw onion. It looks like it will be good... I hope so, because I'm bringing it to a party tonight! :) Changing it to 5 stars.... excellent and I had a lot of people asking for the recipe!

Like other reviewers, I found that there was simply too much dressing and my veggies drowned.  :(  However, I am planning on using that dressing as a chicken marinade overnight tonight.  Loved the flavor - seems very versatile!

I made this whole recipe for just me and my boyfriend so that we could eat it throughout the week with other meals since its a reasonable side. He loved it and I had doubled the sauce and potatoes because my boyfriend likes those the most and thought the sauce was delicious but a bit heavy. When I make it again I'll just do 1x sauce. Thanks for the recipe though.

I just made this and it looks like the dog's breakfast and tastes like heaven! I made it pretty much according to the directions. I cut down the olive oil a little, increased the basil, and added some crumbled bacon. Finally, a recipe that uses green beans that I like! I hope I can leave it alone long enough to let it get cool and steep in the flavors. YUM!!

Delicious side dish!! I didn't have Worcestershire sauce on hand but the dressing was fine without it.  I strongly recommend using FRESH green beans for this recipe.  I used frozen (which was my own mistake) and they were mushy. I will be making this again often.

Great way to prepare a potato salad without the traditional mayo. It is a keeper.  My Next time, I'll try a little less olive oil just to cut down calories.

I made this as directed and it was pretty good! A nice change from regular potato salad with mayo. I liked the taste better when it was warm, so I think I'd serve it that way next time.

This turned out really well, but i'm giving it 4 stars because i did make adjustments.  As suggested, i doubled the amount of non-dressing ingredients, and it ended up being a good ratio of dressing to salad.  It still seemed a little strong at first, but after i put it in the fridge for a bit, it was really good.  It was a hit at the bbq, and a great alternative since i try not to do mayo based foods!

Changes I made: used purple potatoes, shredded carrots, red onion, cherry tomatoes, green beans.  I drizzled with olive oil, s,p, garlic, onion powder, and oregeno.  I will make again and will try it with the dressing provided.  Thank you.

A nice combination and I really liked the dressing. I was just a little hesitant to use to much as I didnt want it to be overpowering so I didnt use it all but I wish I had. The potatoes absorbe alot of it but not to where its to much. I also added extra garlic as I love that with beans and potatoes.

We really liked this healthier alternative to traditional, mayo based potato salad.

This recipe was great!  I was looking for a potato salad w/ no mayo and this was right on target.  Great flavor!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. A nice summer sweetness to a heavy roast that I made. It was a delicious meal that would also pair well with ham or proscuitto to add a meat to make a complete meal.

Really good, a nice twist to an ordinary potato salad.  Next time I will use the other reviewers recommendation and add olives and cherry tomatoes.
