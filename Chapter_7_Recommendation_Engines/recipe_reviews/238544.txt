This was great with a fish taco wrap that I constructed. Spread on bottom of a tortilla, then layered shredded cabbage, salsa, chopped onion, pieces of cooked battered cod and more fish taco sauce.  Easy and versatile recipe. Thanks kaylee88!

Made it the first time as the recipe stated, great single-sauce for fish tacos, 4 stars. The second time I made it I used half the amounts of lime juice & sriracha because I usually serve fish tacos with lime slices as we like to squeeze some directly onto the fish & I also serve a medium-hot homemade salsa on the side - so halving the lime & sriracha made this the perfect sauce for those fish tacos (much better than the typical 50/50 mayo/yogurt fish taco sauce). Though I will make it again per this recipe if I don't have fresh lime or salsa ingredients on hand (I always have lime juice in a bottle & sriracha & the other ingredients on hand).

OMG! This recipe was by far my favorite on this on site! Made my family generic fish tacos (with fish sticks) and the sauce made them super deelish! I used the Costco raw flour tortillas (cut in half), Gordon's fish sticks, this sauce, shredded cheese, guacamole and a healthy spring mix (in that order). First bite of them my husband was in awe!!! The sauce reminds me of legit fish tacos at a mexican restaurant in ensanada! Only difference is I had to use lemon juice (no lime juice in the house). Bravo to this recipe! Bravo!!!

I added this to 2 cups cole slaw mix along with 1/2 tsp. of sugar to tone down the lime juice a bit for my husband's taste buds.  It's excellent served on grilled fish tacos.

Very easy to make. When I tasted it without the fish taco I thought it would be too mayonnaise-like, but on the tacos it really brought out the flavor of the dish.

This was great! Instead of using sour cream, I used plain nonfat yogurt, Despite the substitution, this sauce was really delicious. This recipe will definitely become a staple in future fish taco dishes.

Didn't have enough sour cream so I added a tablespoon of mayonnaise too. I also added smoked paprika.

I have made this multiple times.  Sometimes substituting yogurt for the mayo, using bottled lime juice, or using liquid hot sauce.  It all works. Best results for me is to stay true to the recipe and use mayo, fresh squeezed lime juice, and sriacha sauce.  I usually bump up the amount of sriacha to 1 tsp.  In addition to fish taco's this sauce is great for making homemade coleslaw.

This recipe made me fearless about making fish tacos. I was initially nervous about how tart it might be, but after we made this recipe, it has become a staple. We've made it multiple times, and sometimes with low fat sour cream or Greek yogurt, and the result is the perfect balance for slaw, tacos, or even dipping sauce for fish sticks.

My kids are super picky so I was pleasantly surprised that this was right for them. I didn't use sriracha sauce, but did add sugar to balance out the flavors so it tasted delicious!

Simple quick and easy, it really took my fish tacos out of their “cilantro lime aioli” rut. I’ll definitely make this again. And again. And again...

This is tastey and goes well with shrimp tacos. I used light sour cream and put about 3 times the amount of hot sauce.

I did a mix of Cholula hot sauce with the Siracha just for our family preference, but this is perfect as is.

Very good. I substituted low-fat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and used a bit less mayo to make it healthier.  I also added a bit of cilantro, which I consider a necessity for any kind of taco.

Absolutely delectable! So tasty and simple. It’s a great addition to any fish. Everyone loved it. I added just a little more Sriracha and garlic powder. I’ll make it again and again.

This sauce was fantastic!  I tried pan fried fish tacos for the first time and used this sauce for the "slaw" and then drizzled on top to finish the taco. Wow! So good!

I followed the recipe exactly and used homemade mayo, which really helped seal the deal for taste and creaminess.

I love this sauce. I added chili pepper and regular hot sauce because I didn’t have Sriracha. I spread it on the bottom of my tortillas and it was perfect. I keep a jar in the fridge for when I’m in the mood.

This sauce completely made the fish tacos... so good!!  I subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream and only used 2 teaspoons of lime juice because I serve lime wedges with the tacos.   The Sriracha added the perfect touch... not spicy at all but wonderful flavor.  Thanks to this recipe, fish tacos made at home now taste exactly like my favorite fish tacos at a local restaurant.

Sauce was great on fish tacos but I did have to make a few changes.  I decreased the lime juice to taste (threw out first batch because 1 tbsp was TOO much!).  I used Frank's hot sauce to taste (1tsp) as I like the flavor better.  I added onion powder and garlic powder.  Fish tacos were made with white corn tortillas, fried cod, and a variety of toppings (cole slaw, lettuce, tomatoes, jack cheese, queso fresco, onions, jalapenos).  They were a huge hit and the sauce is a great compliment.  I actually had to make more!

Use this recipe every time we make fish tacos. Only change I make is adding cilantro to taste and doubling so we have leftover sauce.

We really liked this sauce on our fish tacos. I used fresh garlic for the garlic powder and adobo sauce for the sirracha.

Great sauce as written.  After tasting it, I added a little bit of cumin, and some hot sauce just to kick up the heat a little bit.  I made the fish tacos for a Mexican style marina party.  I did the cod Sous Vide style at 131 degrees for an 1 1/2 hours.  salt & peppered the cod and added slices of lime before I vacuum packed them.  This sauce was amazing on them.

Great base to add your own touches!  While it was good as written I honestly needed more sauce so ended up just putting more of each ingredient in a bowl (didn't measure) and added cumin and some salt.  Amazing!  We even dipped tortilla chips into the sauce.

This is an awesome sauce! I always sub plain Greek yogurt for sour cream and it's delicious that way too. It's a shame to call it "fish taco" sauce because it's excellent as a sweet potato fries dip and on burgers too! Yum! Thanks for a great recipe.

The only thing I didn't add was the cilantro and that was only because I loaded my cabbage up with cilantro. This sauce was the freaking bomb! Now I want shrimp tacos this week so I can try this sauce on them.

I made up my own sauce using just mayo and lime juice and it was ok. I decided to look for a "real" recipe and found this one. I liked it, especially the kick the siracha gave it. My husband  said he wasn't too fond of it though. I will probably make it again.

I omitted the hot sauce b/c my hubs doesn't like anything spicy. It was still delicious. Very simple & adds a lot. I add chopped cilantro & I estimate all the measurements, it consistently comes out great!

It was adequate.  Next time I will use a Mexican hot sauce or Louisiana-style.  For me, siracha doesn't work for Mexican food..

I doubled this so we would have for our 'fish on Friday' meals.  I did add some cilantro and that was a good addition.
Great dipping sauce for fried catfish!

Delicious.  Not spicy, using the amount of sriracha listed.  Very easy to add more, to taste.  Adding some smoked paprika like another Reviewer suggested added a nice smoky dimension.

Salsa por uno!
I cut the recipe in thirds:
Added cumin and ghost pepper powder.
Perfect amount for two fish tacos!
Now to perfect the breading process.

Just made this sauce for tonight's fish tacos (leftover cod, shredded and warmed).  Family is not a fan of sirachi sauce so used a medium salsa (2 teaspoons) instead.  This is quite yummy and good accent for the fish.

Didn't change a thing. Delicious and just the right mix of  everything and siracha. We used this on fish tacos and it was the right amount for about 6 tacos, give or take. ????

I have made this several times and it's very good.  I didn't have any limes and/or lemons so I used  juice from a jar of deli sliced jalapenos.  I always double the recipe and I always use more sriracha sauce than called for.  (We like it hot.)   This is fantastic as a dip for french fries and hamburgers too.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly as written (I did double it though).  Thought it was really tasty. Personally, next time I make it I will cut back just a little on the garlic powder but overall we loved it. I mixed a little in with the slaw mix (just a touch!) and served the rest on the side. Delicious!

I made exactly as is but did add two more things.  First, I doubled the recipe and added about 10 cilantro leaves and 5 pickled jalapenos and blended it all together with the sour cream, mayo, lime and hot sauce .  Yummy!  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

I was in a hurry to make some kind of sauce for my fish tacos and found this recipe. It was profoundly simple, and I already had everything I needed. This is a good basic sauce that can be steered any number of ways. As is, it is a sauce that will probably please most tastebuds in the family. I like my sauce a bit spicier, so I added extra hot sauce.

Used it again for shrimp tacos!

This is a good sauce for fish tacos, but I was wanting something with a little more oomph.  Maybe all it needs is a little more sriracha, a little more onion,  and a little more lime.  I would definitely make this again!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I really enjoyed this sauce. It's a great compliment to the fish taco and goes better with the fish than salsa or taco sauce. I think that next time I will sprinkle in a little Old Bay just to see what happens.

I added more siracha like another reviewer did, spicy is good!!
I made this for shrimp tacos.  I bet this would be a good sandwich spread also.

Thanks for sharing.  I stick to the recipe changing out lemons for limes.  Tonight used lemon as we needed the last lime for gin and tonic.  I don't like real hot spicy food but my husband does.  I add a touch of extra Sriracha to his.  My son likes to put this on sandwiches, eggs just about anything.

My family loves this sauce. I've made it often in the past six months since I've found this recipe. It provides the perfect tang for fish tacos.

Not bad. I added some more hot sauce and lime juice and it was really good. I also used Lawry's garlic salt in the sauce instead of the garlic powder and it was really good. I would make it again. I spread this on the bottom of a flour tortilla and then layered shredded lettuce, fresh avocado slices, fried tilapia (seasoned with panko crispy bread crumbs and Lawry's mediterranean herb seasoned salt) and then topped my taco with a mango papaya salsa and slices of lime.

Made some awesome fish tacos with this sauce. I don't have sriracha on hand - I just don't care for the flavor. Instead, I used Taco Bell fire sauce, added a bit extra for kick, and tasted amazing. 

I fry my tortillas (corn or flour) in peanut oil for 10-15 secs and pat dry. Once the battered fish is done baking in the oven, I fry it in the leftover peanut oil to make them nice and crispy. Served with shredded cheese and shredded cabbage. Next time I need to remember to pick up cilantro at the store. Perfection!

It was a good base but needed a little jazzing up for us. I added a tablespoon of Nando's peri-peri sauce and doubled the amount of Sriracha. We will use it on tilapia for the tacos. Now it's perfect.

We used tartar sauce since time began and it is real old hat.This recipe has plenty of room to change up whenever we want to. It's a great change from the same old stuff.

Really excellent, easy sauce. It's easily as good as or better than other recipes on this site that are far more complicated.  Sriracha really is the best hot sauce to use with this recipe, however. I tried it with tapatio hot sauce and it didn't turn out nearly as good: Too salty and without the hint of sweet to balance out the lime. This is our new go-to fish taco sauce.
