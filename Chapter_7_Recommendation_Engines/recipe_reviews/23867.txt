AWESOME! I've been searching for years for a vegetarian-friendly version of French Onion Soup. I've been improvising and doing all right, but this is much better! Can't say whether the kids would like it - I don't have any, but my hubby is a very good critic & he LOVED it!

I used red onions, red wine (instead of white wine) beef broth (since I did not have chicken broth) and added 2 bay leaves along with the salt and pepper, and it turned out terrific.  My boyfriend, who is very wary of my cooking since some of my concoctions are not super appealing, even really enjoyed it.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Mmmmm..... [12-29-2001]
Update:
I make this soup once or twice a year (whenever I have an extra bottle of wine lying around) and it always turns out perfect.  This is *sooo* good!  SOOO v*e*r*y good!  And there are no fancy ingredients.  And yet it's delicious!  Why don't I make it more often?  
Anyways, whoever said this has too many onions...  
Did I mention this soup is good?

This is the BEST EVER onion soup, slowly sauting the onions is brilliant as it sweetens and tenderizes the onions for a  delicious result. I think the reviewer who said there was to much onion did not fully cook down their onions or used the giant sized onions, at any rate it is onion soup after all and their rating isn't fair just based on that, it is what it is!
My changes to this recipe was that I used a beef stock that I had bought to use for another recipe that I didn't make.
I also used a Gruyère Cheese instead of mozzarella as I wanted the creamy, nutty flavor that Gruyère gives and for my company I thought it would make this soup that much more special.  I also used a quality white wine that I already had for a quality flavor.  Everyone commented on it's deep flavor and said it was the best 
they have ever had. I so recommend that anyone who wants a 5 star flavored onion soup give this one a try...I know they won't be disappointed.

Pretty darn good vegetarian French Onion. But the flavor obviously depends based on the wine you use. I used very watered down vegetable stock, so I added in 4 bay leaves and 3 shakes of Worcestershire sauce. And I sauted the onions for probably 30 minutes, so they browned nicely. I didn't have baguette or mozzarella, so I subbed a toasted half slice of plain bagel & a slice of provolone.

I have been craving a good vegetarian onion soup for a long time & think I finally found it.  I made my own veggie broth & used a lot of mushrooms & onion skins so the broth would be bold. My husband, who eats meat & always orders onion soup out, said this is as good as any he orders.  I think I would double the recipe next time.  I cooked the onions for 35 minutes.

Delicious - rich and flavorful.  We sauteed the onions for over twenty minutes and they were not deep brown, but definitely sauteed enough for the soup.  We served this as an appetizer at a dinner party and served the beef tenderloin with roasted shallots (on this site) as the main dish.

Simple to make and delicious. I used mild red wine instead of white and liked that taste as well.

Just made it.  It took a while to cook all of those onions.  Plus, since I'm a rookie, what kind of onions are best for this recipe?  I used yellow, which I use for everything.  It still tasted great, though.  My wife loved it and wants to make it a keeper.

Tastes strongly of wine-- use significantly less if you don't want this as the main flavor.  Be sure to cook your onions well, so that they are completely soft, before adding to the broth.  I left out the salt and pepper, since our veggie broth contained salt.  My husband and I both enjoyed this soup a lot.

My fiance orders French Onion soup every time its on a menu. I surprised him and made this one night and it was better than a lot of restaurants!  I used a few less onions, chicken broth instead of veg. and added a little red wine (in addition to the white!) so the broth would taste more "beefy", because most F.O. soups call for beef stock. With all these changes it still tasted amazing!  It was so easy too.

I have just made this, and I agree with others that it tastes restaurant quality or better.  I used half white and half red wine and added a dash of Worcestershire as others suggested, and it is yummy! I'd purchased a vegan beef flavored broth base (I was feeling cheap that day and didn't feel like shelling out for veggie broth), and it really does taste like it was made with beef broth as I usually do. We are required to eat vegetarian on Fridays, and I bet my hubby won't believe it is vegetarian when he tries it. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for a couple friends around the holidays and they loved it.  They are not vegetarian but I am so I had to find a recipe for this soup that didn't use beef broth. It was easy to make and very tasty.

I substituted beef broth instead of veggie and it was way to strong/salty?.  Also, almost every other recipe includes thyme, may have helped.

I like the simplicity!  Did not have wine so added 1/4 cup brown rice vinegar, agave, garlic, WHITE PEPPER, & extra veggie broth.  Tastes fabulous!

Delicious, quick, and easy! What more could you ask for?  I toasted the bread first and also added a couple pinches of flour to the simmering soup.

My family loves this soup!  They cry while I'm making it, and beg me to make more later.

Thank you for this! My husband is a "semi-veg" and I am not, so this was a perfect recipe for us.  Very yummy!

I haven't found a better tasting vegetarian version of French Onion soup anywhere! Per other reviews, I did add some thyme, and a little less wine than called for. It's even better the next day.

I used red wine instead of white, as per suggestion. It turned out very good! I piled on the cheese, too, mmm mmm. The next day my boyfriend, upset that I'd used all the onions, used the onions from the leftover soup to make eggs. They were very good too.

Way too much wine.  Need to reduce to one cup.  It actually overpowered the onions.  The next day, I recooked the mixture to let the wine boil off some.  Also, I added a little dry mustard and thyme... this made it a lot better.  The mozzarella cheese and baguette are excellent.  Overall, probably a good vegetarian dish, but since I'm not one, I'll be on the lookout for another recipe.

I made this recipe with 6 onions and it seems like more than enough. The base was a little too strong, had to off set with a salad or something. Too strong by itself. Probably won't make this one again.
