What a great recipe idea! Saw this and had to modify it to my taste. First, didnt want to make a big one so only used one can of crescent roll dough, then did the ham layer, a couple scrambled eggs (with cheese mixed in) layer and a layer of thawed frozen spinach. Sprinkled some blue cheese along the top and closed it up as directed. Brushed with butter and baked. Wow! What a great breakfast treat, Hubby and I ate all but two slices. I am thinking of several options for the filling that I will try (diced tomatos, olives, mushrooms)-the possibilities are endless. I also am thinking maybe some cream cheese filling with blueberries mixed in to make it into a type of danish. Thanks for posting this great recipe.

This turned out great! I used the two crescent rolls to make two variations, one with sausage and cheddar and one with spinach, mushrooms and onions with goat cheese. Both came out excellent! I don't think I did a good job with the criss crossing and it still turned out looking professionally made. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I made this for a brunch for 8 ladies and they adored it. It was beautiful and delicious.
p.s. I could have sworn that I read reviews on the recipe before making it, but they all seem to have disappeared! There were even pictures of the finished result and they are gone too...and no, I'm not talking about the very similar "Ham Breakfast Braid" - the pictures there aren't even close to the ones I saw. I printed the recipe, and it is attributed to someone else. Whatever, the end result is FABULOUS and I highly recommend.

Long ago introduced to this delicious breakfast served at one of our favorite waterway cafes on its Sunday brunch menu. In spite of halving this recipe since making for two, used about 1/3 cup of peppers (blend of red bell, sweet, and jalapeno peppers). Very versatile dish where other popular breakfast meats can be subbed for the ham (we sometimes use a spicy sausage), and other veggies can be added. The reason for cutting the dough into strips is to eliminate overlapping dough since any underlying layer(s) will have a more doughy texture than the golden brown top layer. Knowing that, you can fold or cut the dough in any number of ways and still get excellent results. We serve this with a homemade finishing sauce. Served alongside some fruit, this makes for an elegant brunch. We would give this more than 5*, if possible. Thank you tiberlady for sharing this fantastic recipe.

This turned out to be far more appealing to the eye than the palate.  It was beautiful.  The exterior was a lovely golden brown and shiny with the egg wash.  The interior ingredients were perfectly cooked texturally.   The bottom line is ... the taste of the Cresent dough (at least the Pilsbury brand) is far too sweet to complement this savory dish in a pleasingly balanced way.  The recipe is worth developing as a sweet dish or suggesting a different crust type (maybe pie dough).  Also... a word to the wise...DO NOT prepare this on a 9x13 baking sheet.  Two crescent sheets won't fit.  Keep the dough fairly chilled, work on parchment paper and transfer to baking sheet on parchment paper for baking.

Not bad.  Incredibly easy; I've done breads like this before.  If you're hesitating because you think it's complicated and hard, don't.  It really isn't.  You can do an uneven number of slices so they don't match and it will still come out gorgeous.  Since I've made very similar recipes before, I didn't worry too much about adjusting the ingredients because I didn't have everything called for.  I brushed pesto on the bread first, then used a Laughing Cow cheese (2 wedges) as the cream cheese layer, used vegetarian sausage, and scrambled three eggs, put on top, then closed the loaf and baked.  Tasted good, looked pretty, and was mostly eaten at a work breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

My partner and I needed something for a group of friends stopping by. Searched things we had on hand, and was surprised to find this.  First glance, we thought it would be heavy like a Calzone. Boy were we all surprised.  Since it was more brunch time than breakfast; next time will have crab-meat or salad shrimp in the scramble.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe only looks complicated, I found it very easy to do once I had got everything together.  I would only add that if you are reducing the servings (I did from 6 to 3), that you not reduce the amount of butter needed for the skillet, and that you reduce the cooking time to 18-20 minutes depending on your oven, my bread was golden and ready around the 19 minute mark.

Great recipe. I tweak it a it to fit my family's taste. No pepers or cream cheese and it still comes out great. You can use this and add what ever you want to fill it with and it still comes out great.

This was an immediate hit!  Requested at family gatherings for brunch, especially Christmas morning.  I made the day before and baked the next morning.

I made this twice over the holidays for guests and they loved it. The only change I made was to prep the dough on parchment paper instead of on the baking sheet. I used a pizza cutter to make nice even cuts in the dough.

Recipe Group Selection:  28, March 2015 ~ This was my first attempt at making something that was braided.  It turned out great and the taste was delicious.  I made using 3/4 c. egg whites and 2 whole eggs and served it with diced tomatoes and we had fresh fruit, also.  A nice recipe to make for company as the presentation is very pretty.  Thank you tiberlady, for sharing your recipe.  I will be using this one again.

Good! I used an entire red pepper, an entire bunch of green onions and a lot of Black Forest ham, cut small. I used 2
Pillsbruy Dough Sheets, made it much easier than  cresscent rolls. Braiding it was super easy. I did use 8 eggs. Separated the 8th one for the egg white brush. Cooked it 25 minutes on parchment paper.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used leftover chopped up smoked ham, and I only had 7 eggs, instead of 8. I ended up baking it Friday night, then sliced it up and put it into the freezer. It reheats great in the toaster oven. The egg wash made it such a beautiful dish. I plan on making this for Christmas breakfast for my family. Thanks for posting it!

Due to time constraints, I put it all together the night before and baked it in the morning.  That worked well!  It may have taken just a few extra minutes in the oven to compensate for the refrigerator cold.  It was received very well by my ladies' group.  It was super easy to do as well.

I made this as part of the RECIPE GROUP and this was so yummy. I loved the creamy egg filling and the pretty presentation. I will definitely serve this to company in the future. I didn't change a thing but I can certainly see alot of possibilities to change up the flavors. Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe, at first look my 4 year old was not impressed, but gave it a try anyway and he loved it. The only change I made was I added tomatoes, spinach and green onion and instead of ham I used turkey (because that’s what I had on hand). This recipe can be versatile for any occasion, just by changing the veggies and meat inside. We just enjoyed it on a bitter cold Wisconsin Sunday morning. Thanks for the recipe!

Great presentation... can do ahead, except for baking, day before.  Followed recipe exactly. My husband especially liked it. Me -I guess I just don't like the bread flavor, I have made it with puff pastry like that flavor better. But over all easy, taste good & impressive presentation. Can't go wrong.

This looked beautiful but I was disappointed with the crescent roll dough.  I wouldn't recommend making this unless you are a fan of crescent rolls.  I was not impressed with the flavor overall.  I will not make this again.

Made this for Dinner while my grandkids were here  - we all loved it!! Followed the recipe with exception to no peppers. I used leftover ham from Christmas chopped up. I don't believe I've ever used cream cheese in eggs before - I think it made the eggs delightful. It reminded me of a breakfast sandwich from a fast food place that I only get while we travel - because it's so fattening - except much better! I will probably only make this when there are others hear to help eat it.....or I'll do a major Pork-out!!! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a keeper gluten free recipe because everyone likes it, too!  However, it MUST be spiced up.  I used half hot sausage and we still wanted to add Cholula sauce on top, which is very good! I also added extra salt and pepper to the casserole, with a little onion powder, and garlic powder.

Found this while looking for something to make for all of us girls to eat while we got ready for my sister's wedding. It was an AMAZING hit!! My mom said I should make it for Christmas morning this year. I eliminated the cream cheese and milk, and used turkey sausage instead of ham slices (I wanted to keep it a little healthier and avoid any potential gassy issues on such a big day) and I used sweet roasted red peppers instead of regular bell...it still turned out phenomenal!  I couldn't figure out how to braid it well, and it certainly didn't look pretty going in the oven, but no one cared when it came out.  Trying it again this morning at home since my hubby didn't get any, but I'm using the cream cheese and milk this time. I'm still going to stick to the sausage and sweet roasted red peppers, though...I think I'll like that combo best.

I think refrigerated biscuit dough is disgusting tasting, so when ever I see a recipe that  I think I would like to try, that uses it, I always replace the dough with frozen puff pastry dough.  I use the Aussie brand. No hydrogenated oils.  The recipes always turn out fantastic and are not overpowered with the nasty taste of refrigerated biscuit dough. I have tried frozen pie dough as well.  It works well and has a nice taste but sometimes  a little too heavy for the recipe.  I haven't tried filo dough but I bet it would work well also, especially if you layered it in a baking dish like a lasagne. Happy kitchen experiemnting.

It was a great change from our regular breakfast routine. Not too difficult but definitely not "easier than it looks" as others said. Take heed that two crescent rolls side by side will not fit on your cookie sheet, use parchment paper and transfer it onto the sheet. ??

Loved it, I used sausage and ham, and half cheddar and half Parmesan cheese, was delicious.

Yum.  No ingredient overpowered the other.  Sprinkled a little kosher salt on egg wash before baking.  We are carnivores so served with a side of sausage patties.

I'm always looking for new brunch options. This was great and might be used for next NYD brunch. I really like the consistency of the egg mixture and only used a total of six eggs.

This was easy to make and my wife liked it. I swapped Canadian bacon for the ham. The dough did not fit long ways on my baking sheet, so I did it sideways. That worked out. 
Next time I may do this on some parchment paper and then put it on the baking sheet. 
Will definitely be making this again.

Nice recipe. After struggling to cut and fold the dough, I realized it would be much easier if I refrigerated the dough until the rest of the components were ready to put together. Gee, guess I'll just have to make another one tomorrow!

I made one just like the recipe with the addition of some bacon and shallots and without the peppers (I’ve made a ton of breakfast casseroles lately with peppers and my family was kinda tired of them). Amazing. The hit, though, was the one I made with only veggies. I thawed and dried frozen spinach (I would have wilted fresh if I’d had any) and blended that with the egg mixture to cook. I put a very thin layer of cheddar cheese on the pastry dough and spooned the eggs over the top. I sautéed some mushrooms and onions and sprinkled them on the eggs, and I finished with a layer of white sharp cheddar. It. Was. Amazing! The doctors at work at

I halved the recipe as it was for just the two of us.  The changes I made were not using onions andI used sausage instead of ham, thinking it would be more flavourful.  As some writers suggested, I halved the amount of milk.  I found it to be quite dry, as did my husband.  He suggested it needed ketchup!  Looking really good but I will not make it again.

We had a group of friends over for the weekend and usually do some kind of breakfast for everyone. I had seen this recipe so decided to give it a try on Saturday morning. Made it pretty much according to the recipe except did not add the milk to the eggs. Glad I didn't because I liked that they were firm enough after baking to slice the loaf and eat without a fork. The recipe was such a hit that while my husband was out for other stuff, I had him pick up 3 more rolls of crescents & more cream cheese. Sunday morning I made 3 loaves, one the original way, 1 with sausage, & 1 with bacon. All were great, but those with sausage and bacon were much bigger hits even than the ham! Will definitely be making this on a regular basis for our camping friends! Almost forgot to include that after the egg wash, I sprinkled a little Lawry's Garlic Salt with Parsley over the top. And this addition really did take it "over the top".

Great recipe!  I used chunky bits of ham not thinly sliced: good idea.  I forgot the cream cheese: mistake.  Used up some leftover veggies: broccoli, a nice Mexican onion and fresh spinach, adding the last just for a minute or two: great idea.  Just cooked the eggs gently to keep them from drying out: good.  I had a huge pile of veggies and the pastry strips barely covered them, but that didn't matter.  It came out just beautifully and was yummy and healthy though I agree with someone else that the crescent roll dough is too sweet; will try the puff pastry next time.  Thanks so much!

The problem that I saw was that there was too much bread.  So, instead of using 2 packages, I used one package and rolled it out to the same size (i.e., it covered the bottom of the half sheet pat).  It turned out great and there wasn't too much bread.  I used bacon (crumbled and cooked almost done), then the eggs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I will make this again soon.

Although I was concerned, from the ingredients list, that the dish was going to be bland, it turned out to be delicious. It's a keeper. I followed the recipe as written, but have a couple of suggestions regarding the mechanics of  assembly;: My guess is that few folks have a baking sheet large enough to accommodate the unfolded dough. I don't. My solution was to build the bread on the counter top on parchment paper sprinkled with flour.  The benefit of experience  strongly suggests that the dough should be centered on a long strip of the paper, with two other strips of paper on either side of the center one to take care of the extra width of the dough. Once the ingredients have been piled down the center of the dough, and the dough on the sides has been cut into strips and folded over the ingredients in the middle, everything should fit on the center piece of parchment paper. Transferring the unbaked bread assembly to the baking sheet was easy by leaving everything on the paper. And baking the bread on the paper on the baking sheet worked just fine, too. The finished product was easy to move off the paper for the best part: eating it.

I made this with Aldi brand crescent rolls which aren't as nice to work with as the stiffer, Pillsbury brand.  I was sure it was going to spring a leak or cook up bad.. but NOPE.  Came out PERFECT!  I'm not a pepper fan, but my husband LOVED it.  I cooked my eggs till I saw no goo.. gooey eggs gross me out.  Wrapped it to the best of my ability (accidentally cut the strips all the way to the filling),  patched holes where I could see them, brushed it with egg white and shoved it in the oven for 28 mins.  The outside was crisp, the inside was perfect.  My husband and  I were very impressed with the look and overall taste.  Next time I am going to try the Pillsbury brand crescents and omit the peppers and green onions.  Going to add some crumbled, cooked bacon and sauteed onions to the egg mixture and see how that comes out!  Ty for this awesome recipe!

Simple, but good presentation. Gives you half an hour to get the rest of brunch set up while it's in the oven.

Freakin incredible. Followed the recipe exact except one thing. Instead of blending the egg/cheese/milk mixture, I put the concoction in the nutribullet and they came out super fluffy. Absolutely delicious. Presents very well. Served my guests with a red fruit salad and mamosas. To die for. Thanks.

This recipe was very good. I made it  for overnight guests -  it can be dangerous to make a recipe the first time for guests but this one turned out very good. The only change I made was that I used a puff pastry for the crust because I do not care for Cresent Rolls.

Very good as is. I gave it a 4 star rating as it is just a little bland other wise it would have been 5 star. Will make it agen and add something for a tad more flavor.

My husband and I enjoyed this breakfast/brunch egg dish so much I decided to make it again with the help of my  14 year old granddaughter. She had a great time and did most of the work. That family brunch was a huge hit. We followed the recipe with only one minor exception - we used green pepper because that's what I had. Will absolutely make this again.

I have made this brunch item many times over the years for many different audiences and it is always a hit.  I have never had anyone say they did not like it.  Plus, it makes for a wonderful presentation on your table and people think you worked harder on it than you did.

The only change I made is to substitutue the slice ham for chicken sausages, since I don't eat any red meats.  My husband loved it, and me too!

Lesson learned: do not attempt braiding crescent roll dough in a super hot kitchen! Mine did not look pretty but tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again, but will probably wait until winter!
