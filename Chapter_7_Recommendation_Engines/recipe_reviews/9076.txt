I sprang for the walnut oil but substituted 2 tbsp. ground ginger for the fresh, and 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp. ground alspice for the cardamom. Potatoes stayed moist and were a nice compliment to the turkey. Everybody liked them.

This was a great recipe that I made for a dinner party, word of caution: cut the ginger in half at least!  The ginger is potent and too strong, but if you cut back on it, it works! I would make this again.

Great recipe! Really simple and easy to make. I substitute vegetable oil for the walnut oil since I never have any on hand and it turns out scrumptious.

Using honey is a great idea for sweet potatoes and we liked that. The only problem was the cardimon and ginger were a little overwhelming. The kids did not like it. In the future we would omit the cardimon and go easier on the ginger.

I think the key to this recipe is knowing your own tastes. (After reading the reviews) I used maybe 1 T. ginger and 1/2 t cardamom. It was very tasty but I expected there to be a bit more caramelization. Everyone liked it and it was not sickly sweet like marshmallow versions of this recipe.

This recipe got my attention last Thanksgiving, and will be definitely be served again this year.  Even my parents, who generally avoid any unusual dish, raved about these sweet potatoes.  I would advise anyone thinking of making this dish to gauge their own tolerance for ginger and cardamom and adjust the recipe amounts to taste - this recipe allows for quite a bit of personalization. I also agree with other reviewers: nutmeg is essential, as is fresh grated (not ground) ginger.

Exactly what I wanted! Not too sweet like the marshmallow ones and not mashed. It was all gone.  I actually sliced and baked in a casserole dish.

I was looking for a low fat way to serve sweet potatoes and I found this recipe.  WOW!  You won't believe the delicious flavor.  Just one thing - it took much longer to cook than it says in the recipe - about an hour (but worth the wait).

I did modify the recipe somewhat - sliced, instead of cubing, the potatoes (1/4" - 1/2"); used ground ginger and omitted the cardamom (none on hand) - and they still came out TERRIFIC!  Easiest "candied sweet potato" recipe I've ever made!   "Mama Mary"

Am I missing something? Eight other cooks said this was a five star recipe. I agree that the flavor was excellent, but they were extremely dry. I will make again, but perhaps add a bit of chicken broth or sherry.

I used nutmeg instead of cardamom, still tasted great!  I added lots of honey as well, for sweetness.  Great recipe!

This recipe calls for WAY too many sweet potatoes. I used 6 and still found it to be a lot.
The potatoes should be boiled first to remove the skins and help with the cooking time.
I did this and THEN baked for the allotted time and they were JUST cooked.

Tasty dish though. The honey makes the dish.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE hit! I cut rounds and baked it in a casserole dish, which required cooking it about 15 min longer than stated for the sweet potatoes to be really tender the the juices to caramelize. I cut back the ginger and the cardamom by 1/3 because of other reviews, but when I make it again, and I will, I'll put the full amount in. A wonderful recipe and a great way to get away from that awful pile of goo that we were all raised on. Thanks Christine!

Excellent! Don't cheat on the ginger. If you appreciate this powerful aromatic herb,use as the recipe states. I was out of Walnut oil so i used Grapeseed oil and pieces of walnuts. Wonderful addition to my collection.

Loved this recipe.  I used olive oil for the walnut oil, and cinnamon and nutmeg for the cardamom.  Soooo good with the ginger.

With sugar conscious people at the table I reduced the honey to about 3 Tbsp.  The result was a much more savory dish.  Agree about fresh ginger- makes a huge difference.  We did not find the cardamom to be too strong.  With no walnut oil on hand (is it just me?) I used veggie oil and a little water.  Also used a baking dash to bake it, and covered for the second 20 min.  It really steamed and softened the potatoes.  Great recipe! Will make this over and over!

These are not bad.  I got mine to caramelize, but I had to leave them in the oven a lot longer than stated in order to do that.  I also only used 4 sweet potatoes--it's just the two of us, so 9 is a bit of overkill.  Very good, though, nice flavor.  I agree wtih others--use the amounts you think you can handle of the spices adn you'll be fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really tasty side dish. I did substitute canola for walnut oil & ground ginger for the fresh. Just because that's what I had on-hand.

These were excellent! I sliced them instead of cubing them to cut down on the bake time. They took about 25 minutes total. Some other reviewers said there was too much ginger, but I thought they were great. It does have a strong ginger flavor, so if you aren't a huge fan,you should probably cut back.

Awesome recipe! I will make these often! I did cut the ginger a little and it turned out perfect. I did have to stir these around quite a bit to keep them from drying out, though, but it was worth the extra effort.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it, even my In-laws. The only thing I did different was to use olive oil instead of walnut oil.

This time, since I didn't want to make a casserole, I customized this recipe to 2 servings.  I baked two whole sweet potatoes, until tender.  In the meantime I had combined the sauce ingredients, and poured over the split baked potatoes when serving.  I also plan to try the recipe using the slow cooker, as well as the casserole.

I've made this recipe several times, and now I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.  If your in a hurry try par-boiling the potatoes, draining, and then mixing in the spices and honey.  I tried this and it works out great.  Also, I substituted veggie oil for the walnut oil because I don’t usually have it.  Thanks!!

How Yummy! One of the times I made this dish, I realized I ran out of cardamom, so I used coriander, which worked just as well. Sprinkle with some chopped roasted almonds for an added texture.

I made these for thanksgiving this year, and while they were ok, the ginger really overpowered the delicate flavor of the sweet potatoes and cardamon.  I will try them again, but will cut the ginger  at least in half, and maybe up the cardamon a little.  Something to start with, and much healthier than the standard candied sweet potatoes.

Great recipe for sweet potatoe and very easy also. I just subsituted the walnut oil for canola oil and the cardamon for ground nutmeg. I also cut the ginger in half. All my family loved it.

this was delicious even after I substituted the fresh ginger with the bottled. I didn't have any walnut oil, so I used regular oil but sauteed some walnuts in the oil until they were brown. I then added the honey and the powdered spices (plus the pepper) and poured that all over the cut up sweet potatoes. The time in the oven as stated by the recipe was perfect. LOVED IT.

Wow.  I finally got up the courage to bring a dish to my in-laws Easter dinner, and this was the best choice I could have made.  It was such a surprising recipe: sweet, tangy, aromatic.  At my husband's request, I cut back on the cardamom, but I think I would have been happy with the full amount.  I didn't have walnut oil, but canola ended up working just fine.  After baking, I mashed up the potatoes and transfered to a nice casserol dish.  As a final touch, I spooned a generous amount of the left-over honey mixture (from the bottom of the baking pan) over the potatoes.  It looked, smelled, and tasted divine. This is now a family favorite!

this was very good and a nice way to do sweet potatoes, when one does not like those sickening dessert type casseroles. I am glad I read the reviews first regarding the ginger. Perhaps it was supposed to be 3 TEASPOONS? I added 3 tsp. of fresh ginger and it was nicely balanced with the cardamom; not overpowering at all. Used olive oil instead of walnut oil.

This was very tasty served as a side along with 'Maple Roast Turkey'.  But 3 TBSP of fresh ginger seemed a bit much for only 3lbs of sweet potatoes, so I cut waaay back.  The cardamom instead of the usual cinnamon was a nice surprise, tho.  Thanks!

Well...My mom loves ginger in this recipe and I don't like it so much.  It was a little over powering for my taste. So if you enjoy ginger you will enjoy this recipe.

I made this for Christmas and to go with the Roast Duck with Apple Dressing recipe that I also found here at allrecipes.com. Not only was this recipe excellent but it complimented the duck very nicely. I used peanut oil instead of walnut oil and ground ginger instead of the fresh and still found it was delicious.

This is the best sweet potato recipe on the planet! Everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving, even the people who said they did not like sweet potatoes. Easy enough to make as part of an everyday meal. Easily scaled up or down to feed a crowd or just 2 or three.

Pretty good dish, and I found the cooking times to be pretty accurate.  I did cover the dish for the first 20 min. and had just the right caramelized, syrupy consistency in the bottom of the dish (I used a 9x13 glass baking dish) when it was finished.  Definitely way too much ginger for me.  I cut it down to 1 1/2 T. and that was still too much, so next time I will try just 1 T.  I would also add some salt, as I felt it could have used some.  Otherwise pretty good, thanks!

Waaay too spicy, and I like spicy in general.  Will find a milder recipe that doesn't cover the taste of the sweet potatoes so much.

I loved these. I think the flavours worked really well together. The only change I made was replacing the walnut oil with coconut oil. At lot of others commented that there was too much ginger, but I didn't find this to be the case at all. Mine were done after exactly 40 minutes. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making these again for sure.

Substitute ground coriander for the cardamom if you like a more subtle flavor. A shot of lemon juice right before serving is awesome!

I actually didn't follow the recipe perfectly because I messed up. But hey, thats okay, because it turned out great! I sliced my sweet potatoes, used golden instead of ruby (or actual sweet potatoes instead of yams). Eyeballed the ginger and used only 1/4 tsp cardamom and as per other user suggestion 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also used olive oil instead of walnut as that's what I had. Added about 1 tsp each of lemon juice and white wine. I boiled the potato rounds for about 7 minutes then coated them in the glaze mixture and broiled until browned. Tasted good enough to make again.  Served with roasted boneless leg of lamb and a salad of organic baby greens with herbs, gorgonzola, craisins, apple dices and a garlic vinegarette.

I like this recipe.  It's not as sweet as the typical brown sugar sweet potatoe recipes out there.  I did end up using less ginger and cardamom, since I was serving the dish to some less adventerous eaters for Thanksgiving.  I could not get this to camelize, but I did not use a cast iron skillet.  I had them in a glass baking dish.  I think 9 sweet potatoes would have been too many.  I had very large sweet potatoes and 5 of those yielded 9 cups cut up, so I stuck to that quantity.  I am going to try this again, but perhaps use a larger baking dish to see if I can get the carmelization to happen.  I was very pleased with the flavors though.  I would recommend this recipe.

I did end up using less ginger and cardamom, since I was serving the dish to some less adventerous eaters for Thanksgiving.  I could not get this to camelize, but I did not use a cast iron skillet.  I had them in a glass baking dish.  I think 9 sweet potatoes would have been too many.  I had very large sweet potatoes and 5 of those yielded 9 cups cut up, so I stuck to that quantity.  I am going to try this again, but perhaps use a larger baking dish to see if I can get the carmelization to happen.  I was very pleased with the flavors though.  I would recommend this recipe.

I loved it.  I made a double order and doubled everything except the ginger and it was perfect.  So tasty and moist at 350 degrees. I cut in 1 inch cubes and it took 2 hours for the double recipe.  Definitely making again!!

I couldn't get this to caramelize.  Could've been my technique, as I'm a genuine novice to cooking from scratch.  However, I may adapt the recipe and instead mash the potatoes, baking it as a casserole, perhaps with some brown sugar and crushed pecans on top.  I do so love the cardamom, though.

Ooooooooooohhhhh! If it has cardamom in it, chances are I'll be a fan, but these were fantastic! Definitely not your typical marshmallowy-cinnamony sweet potatoes, but not so over-the-top exotic that they can't be served at Thanksgiving or Christmas. They have a little bit of a kick, and while my dad and I can't get enough ginger, I usually cut it in half for the people in my family with more conservative palates. I make these for every big holiday get-together, and they're always a hit. It does take longer than 40 minutes to cook, though. Sometimes—if I can find them—I'll toss in some Okinawan sweet potatoes along with the regular ones (they're deep purple and have a mild chestnut flavor).

I really loved the flavours of these sweet potatoes...for one thing they were not overly sweet!  Not sure why but they did not carmelize for me?!  I did parboil 1st to cut down on cooking time in the oven.  While my turkey rested on the counter these cooked in the oven!  I will make them again and see if I can get them to carmelize!!

These were really good.  I cut the recipe in half because there were only three of us.  I used extra light olive oil and ground ginger because that is what I had on hand.  I thought these were very tasty.

Oh, my goodness, this is the best sweet potato recipe ever! I'm not a big yam fan, but these just melt in your mouth with the warm flavor of honey and fresh ginger and a little bit of cardamon. Even picky eaters like this one.

Just what I was looking for! What a great way to serve sweet potatoes--all the nutrition without all the added sugar and cream many sweet recipes call for. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to break from the marshmallow or straight from the can mold.

Great recipe! I would cut the ginger back a bit. I did a thick julienne cut, added some orange peel and Grand Monarch (brandy & orange liqueur) for a delicious result! I also used sesame oil instead, since my husband is allergic to walnuts.

I give this recipe 5 stars. All my family liked it. And I have 4 kids to please. I wanted to make the recipe as was written but I didn't have all the ingredients.  Swapped the walnut oil for veg oil and the cadamom for nutmeg.  Was fantastic!

I used this as a base for my Christmas dinner sweet potatoes, but was limited by what I had on hand. So I used coconut oil instead of walnut oil, and garam masala in place of cardamom. Otherwise, I prepared the potatoes as directed (though, in a deep dish pie plate for lack of a cast iron skillet). The result was delicious and a hit with the whole family. Thank you!

Love it exactly as written. Sweet, tangy, healthy, and pretty on the plate. I cut the potatoes small so the ginger slightly overwhelms the potato taste, but as a ginger fan, I don't mind. This dish gets raves every year. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as an 11th hour addition to my Thanksgiving menu.  I wanted a not-too-sweet recipe that could be baked while I was stuffing the turkey and reheated after the turkey came out.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I substituted a generous dash each of cinnamon and cloves instead of cardamom and olive oil instead of walnut oil.  I used 3 tsps. of grated fresh ginger as some other reviewers suggested - it gave it a surprising (but delicious!) hot taste when I first made it.  The hotness disappeared upon reheating and I will try adding more ginger next time.  Everyone loved it!  My husband and daughter both asked if we could make some more to go with the leftover turkey.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This seems to be a fairly flexible recipe.  We made adjustments because we didn't have everything we needed and it was excellent.  We used vegetable oil instead of walnut oil and cinnamon instead of cardamom.  We also baked it on a cookie sheet instead of in a skillet.  We all loved it including those of us who usually don't like sweet potatoes.

This was an absolutely phenomenal side dish! I substituted the walnut oil with coconut oil and didn't have any cardamom on hand so I used a blend of cinnamon, allspice and ground cloves. I served it with the Cornish game hens with garlic and rosemary from this site. I didn’t find it to be dry at all as another reviewer said, but cooked it only at 350 for 45 minutes. I think you may need to adjust the temperature for the size of the cubes you’re cooking. I also did not find the ginger overpowering, but I use quite a bit of fresh ginger.

I was looking for a new twist on sweet potatoes for our Thanksgiving dinner. I think it's best not to stray too far from the classics. I put in a small amount of ginger, as suggested by other reviews. But then the cardamom was the focus of the dish, rather than the sweet potatoes. My daughter, who loves sweet potatoes, rejected this with one bite. It was a big disappointment.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. My dad and I can't get enough ginger, so this recipe is perfect for us as is. The rest of my family, however, is a little overwhelmed by its intensity, so I usually cut the ginger in half to make it a bit more universally palatable.

Served this at Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. The ginger gives it some zip and the cardamom makes it interesting. The kids said this dish tasted "sophisticated" but they enjoyed it, too ~ so I was delighted! I'll definitely make this again, am thinking of adding orange zest or juice next time...

Really fantastic taste! The combination of Sweet potatoes and cardamom was very tasty. I used a litte less honey.
This is a recipe I will always use.

This was pretty good, I did sub olive oil for walnut oil and I didn't have a cast iron pan so I used a regular one. I sort of expected this to have a glaze but it didn't. taste was very pleasant though.

Easy and tasty--but takes closer to 40 or so minutes to bake, not 20. I added a little extra honey as well.

These were good, but a little too sweet for me. The spices and honey masked the sweetness of sweet potatoes. Also, they stuck to the pan. I'd put foil down if I made them again.

I don't know WHAT I did wrong, but this didn't turn out quite the way I thought it would. The only change I made was I put in 1 tbsp ground ginger instead of the fresh ginger. I baked it according to directions, and they came out pretty burnt (I mean, the burnt carmellized version). My oven might be not working correctly. It tasted just OK even though it was burnt, but all I tasted was the ginger. Next time (and my suggestion for y'all) is LESS ginger is better! I'll be belchin' ginger for days now. (((smiling)))

This was a wonderful side dish with all the ginger (I had a bunch of fresh ginger I was trying to find a recipe for) and it was refreshingly different than your standard sweet potato casserole.  Delicious!

This was delicious!  I used peanut oil, since I didn't have walnut (and couldn't imagine using the rest if I bought it.)  Got the same general taste as candied, but with way less butter/oil. And the honey gave it a sticky/sweet/yummy taste.

A smash hit with the family at this year's Thanksgiving feast. I actually followed the advice of others and cut the ginger down to 1 tbs. In place of the walnut oil, I had grapeseed oil on hand and that seemed to work just as well. Other tweaks include a touch of maple syrup with the honey and a dash of cinnamon.

This was an excellent replacement for the overly sweet marshmallow and brown sugar laden standard.

Excellent recipe. Very flavorful but not too sweet. Healthy! A great alternative to candied yams with marshmallows for the health conscious and this with a sophisticated palate.

This is a very good side dish, unfortunatley I didn't have a cast iron pan, so I made sure they were carmelized  in a pan on the stove.  
Still great, but I will get some cast iron!

Not what I was expecting.  I think that it has too much ginger, which over powers the end product.  Don't plan on using this recipe again.

LOVED THIS! I made as directed except cut the ginger amount in half and used ground ginger (all I had). I used garam marsala instead of cardamom bc again, it's all I had. Putting this on the list! It's sweet but works so well with sweet potatoes. My 1 year old daughter loved it (not surprising considering the honey!)

Awesome flavor, but will reduce ginger next time. I found that it took longer than recipe stated to get potatoes tender. I also stirred potatoes during baking.

The family enjoyed it but I made a few changes. I added cinnamon and 2 apples.  The apples really complimented the sweet potatoes. Next time, I plan to add pecans or walnuts and maybe raisins or coconut flakes.

After reading the other reviews, I reduced the ginger to 1 tablespoon, omitted the cardamom and pepper, and substituted with 1 teaspoon of roasted cinnamon.  They were a big hit at my health conscious Christmas party.!

You must like ginger if you make them.  They were good and easy to make.  Personally I found the ginger a little overwhelming but others at the table said they were good.  Too bad Dad is around anymore.  He used to love ginger!

I love this recipe, as does my whole family. It has become a frequent request for family gatherings. I do substitute hazelnut oil in place of walnut oil, as my dad does not like walnut, and it is absolutely delicious! I also use half sweet potato, half yams to give it a little color.

I thought this was good. Subbed for walnut oil and cardamom as others did.  Tasty and will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the first time I have ever made sweet potatoes. My family loved this recipe. After reading prior reviews, I only used 1 tablespoon of ginger. Next time I will probably use only 1/2 tablespoon of ginger, as it was still pretty strong for me. Per prior reviews, I also used 1/4 nutmeg & 1/4 cinnamon instead of the cardamom.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I baked my potatoes in a glass, pyrex dish instead of an iron skillet. This took a little longer, but I did keep stirring for an even bake. Great Recipe!!!!

The Ginger gave it a super good flavor.  I didn't have cardamom, but it was good even without it.  I added some brown sugar during the last 15 minutes of baking, and it tastes almost like baked apples only not so tart.

Delicious light flavor is great option for Thanksgiving, but allow for longer bake time. My sweet potatoes were1-1/4" cubes and needed 50 minutes total bake time.  Regretting my choice to reduce the cardamom per another reviewer advice--next time I'll use full amount.

Delicious recipe! My new favorite way to make sweet potatoes. I substituted organic unrefined coconut oil for the walnut oil which gave it a subtle coconut flavor.  I did not have cardamon so I used 1/4 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.

Followed directions, substituting ground ginger for fresh (ran out), but realized it was way too gingery - ginger is one of those spices that does not follow the 1 fresh Tbsp = 1 dried tsp. Added some garlic powder and salt and it evened out the taste. Yummy.

This tasted decent. It was somewhat difficult too because unless the pieces were all the same size, they did not cook evenly. I might give it another change. I also did 1 tsp of fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp of cardamom and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.

Good flavor, but the ginger was too strong. I may try again with less ginger next time.

Won't make again, just not my cup of tea. I like sweet potatoes/yams, but not like this. Even cut the ginger in half and it was too much.
