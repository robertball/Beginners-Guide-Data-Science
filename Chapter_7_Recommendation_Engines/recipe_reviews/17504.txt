A tasty yet not-so-sweet pound cake. This cake is especially made for those who do not like things too sweet. Taste better after refrigerated. I made this cake for my hubby on his birthday and he loves it. Worth to make it again.

We really love this recipe.  I make a couple changes- Instead of using an unsweetened chocolate bar, I use the cocoa powder/shortening substitution that appears on the cocoa box.  I also skipped the coffee altogether.  It's a very dense, moist cake that gets rave reviews.

I HAD JUST TAKEN THE CAKE OUT OF THE OVEN,WHEN MY DAUGHTER CALLED THAT SHE WENT INTO LABOR. I QUICKLY WRAPPED THE CAKE IN FOIL AND HEADED FOR THE HOSPITAL,THINKING FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD BE HUNGRY AS WE WAITED FOR NEWS.WELL NO ONE SHOWED UP EXCEPT MY SON AND MYSELF. I TOOK THE CAKE TO THE NURSES STATION .BY THE TIME THEY ROLLED MY DAUGHTER TO THE O.R. ,THE CAKE WAS NEARLY GONE AND THEY ALL DECLARED IT FABULOUS.

Wonderfully moist and elegant cake. Very attractive in both presentation and taste. The glaze is awesome and would work well with other cakes or cookies. If you are a chocolate lover you MUST try this recipe. I guarantee you will be glad you did. Thanks for the recipe Nestle.

This was the first bundt cake I ever made, and it turned out fabulous!  Everyone enjoyed it, and it was fun to make.  I did *not* find it to be dry like one reviewer suggested.  (Not any dryer than other pound cakes... I always need a glass of milk nearby w/ a pound cake!)

Excellent! Made one last night and we got up in the middle of the night to have more. Made another today to take to a party and everyone asked for the recipe. The only things I did differently were to use Nescafe Classic Decaf and  a little less vanilla in the glaze (1/2 tsp). Superb!

This was a fine cake, but not wonderful.  It was a little dry (I baked it for the minimum time) though after a night wrapped in plastic in the fridge seemed to give it a little better texture.  I think we like cakes with a bit stronger flavor. I'd thought with a half pound of chocolate and a cup and a half of coffee that it wouldn't be so bland.  The glaze helped and maybe a handful of chocolate chips stirred into the batter would be nice, but just the same, I think I'll stick with the very dense "chocolate lovers favorite cake" on this site.

This wasn't very quick or easy to make... but the cake was absolutely delicious!!!  It was worth every minute of preparation and I'd do it again.  This has hooked me onto this cakerecipe.com site :)

This was so yummy!  I loved using my Taster's Choice to give a nice mocha flavor.

it came out moist enough for us; it's a basic, simple chocolate cake; I agree with one of the other reviewers, some choc morsels in the batter coul be a good idea

Just okay.  I only had to bake for 30 minutes and it was done and I also thought it was dry.  You definetly need a glass of milk for this one.  Liked the glaze on top but would probably not make again.

This recipe yielded a lovely, dark, dense pound cake. The cake and glaze are easy to make, yet they look (and taste) impressive. 

I took this cake to a party and it disappeared in no time flat! People kept asking me, incredulously: "You MADE this!??!"  I love it when that happens.

This is a wonderful recipe if you like bittersweet chocolate-my boys didn't like it as well as the adults because it's not as sweet.  I made it for Father's Day and we really enjoyed it.  It has a very "expensive" taste to it.

This is my husband's all-time favorite cake! He especially likes it frozen or at least cold, but I think it's equally amazing fresh out of the oven.  The flavor of this cake is perfect! (I never make it with the glaze though)
