Great and quick recipe! Makes a wonder lunch. I ran out of rosemary so I substituted Italian seasoning, a bit of cracked pepper, sea salt. I then topped with some mozzarella cheese for the last few minutes of baking

So simple, yet so delicious! This is very easy and makes a great side dish or light snack. If you love fresh ripe tomatoes, you'll love'em baked! These smelled wonderful and tasted even better. Once they came out of the oven I topped them off with a little shredded Parmesan cheese. And, while these are perfect on their own they went great with warm crusty bread and a nice glass of wine!

Sometimes the best recipes are the simplest ones, and this one certainly is worthy of 5 stars.  Right now, the large tomatoes in my area still aren't tasty, so I used the smaller Campari tomatoes. I just sprinkled the garlic and rosemary over the sliced tomatoes, drizzled the olive oil, gave them a sprinkle of freshly-ground pepper and salt, and into the oven.  The tomatoes just get sweeter as they bake, and they have nice presentation as well.  This was enjoyed as a side dish, and I see this one on our table often!

Baked Tomato Slice Haiku: "Easy to prepare, but prefer broil to bake, not bad, just not great." Made AR's "Italian Nutthouse Broiled Tomatoes" last week and found those far superior to these, and I can only assume it was b/c it was a broil, rather than bake. These tomatoes, which tasty, were just a little too mooshy for me. I'd be glad to make them again, make cutting the slices even thicker, baking a shorter time, or even broiling. Oh, and only thing I added was a sprinkle of Parmesan.

Rarely do I follow the exact directions. This time I did and it was awesome. Yellow and red Heirlooms fresh out of the garden plus homegrown garlic put this dish over the top. Perfect as another poster stated; even as a snack. Simple on ingredients. Just the right side dish to adorn a meal on a busy day.

I love to use this recipe as a side for baked fish.  It's easy and delicious!  However, it always takes 10-15 minutes for the tomatoes to bake in my oven.

Very yummie over pasta.  

Here's what I did:

After cooking the tomatoes as per the recipe, I tossed pasta (cooked al dente and still warm) with tomatoes, a generous handful of spinach (raw -- it will wilt), some crumbled italian sausage and a handful of mozzarella chunks.

O. . . . M. . . . G. . . . YUM

So good and so many uses. I use this to top toasted baguette slices with feta and diced olives for a Greek flare. Makes a good appetizer, or topping for a steak or salad.

All in all, quite unremarkable. Forget the fresh rosemary and use fresh basil instead. Would be improved by a slight dusting with grated Italian cheese.

I used Campari tomatoes that I had on hand. Although these were good, they were on the mushy side. I saw another review that also mentioned that. Broiling was suggested. I will try that the next time, for hopefully, a better result. This will also probably be better with the good, garden-type tomatoes when I get a hold of some. UPDATE 7/30/17:  I tried broiling (for 5 min) both a few sliced Roma and Campari tomatoes. The Roma held up much better; the Campari were still mushy.

My husband is the least fussy eater you could find.  I made this the other night and he told me I didn't need to make this again for him.  Complained it was too bitter.  Maybe my garlic was just too strong because our tomatoes from the garden are extremely sweet.

I liked it because for once I got a recipe that wasn't "cheesed" to death (I have a dairy sensitivity, and often recipes depend on the cheese for flavor, so I really have to remake the whole thing which isn't fun.). My only omission was the garlic because I'm allergic. So instead, I added basil to the Rosemary and a little thyme. It was delicious.

This made for a great snack - fresh, easy, and had all of the ingredients on hand!
