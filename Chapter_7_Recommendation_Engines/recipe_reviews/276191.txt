As written, I felt this drink was a touch flavorless. The pumpkin syrup didn't really come through at all--mostly you just taste the half & half and whiskey. So, to up the pumpkin flavor, I added 2 tbsps of pumpkin puree to the half & half mixture and shook it really well to combine. The result was a much more pumpkin-y flavored drink that both hubby and I enjoyed. I also placed a cinnamon-sugar mixture around the rim of the glass that I served it in, and that really added a nice touch. It also only filled a small glass about 2/3 of the way full--and wouldn't come anywhere near to filling one of my highball glasses. Just keep that in mind for serving.
