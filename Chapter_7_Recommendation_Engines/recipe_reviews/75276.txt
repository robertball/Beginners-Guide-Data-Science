I had never made risotto before and found this an easy recipe.  I put celery and bell peppers in it, but left out the olives.  I used the olives as a side dish.  "This is excellent!" was repeated several times.  I will certainly make this again.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe - my guests claimed it was the best risotto they have every tasted! The sun-dried tomato really picks the dish up (I used semi-dried). I omitted the olives, but put in 1/4 cup chopped basil instead - the green gives the dish a terrific colour, juxtaposed with the red from the tomato.

I made this for a costume/halloween party-to rave reviews! everyone just loved it. I used brown rice instead of "white" so it took longer to cook, but the results were still great-imparting a slightly nutty flavor. I used brown because it looked more "fallish" plus it's a healthier carb than white! I will definitely make again. I received compliments on it all night and it was gone by evening's end. People were dipping chips into it! thanks for the recipe..
