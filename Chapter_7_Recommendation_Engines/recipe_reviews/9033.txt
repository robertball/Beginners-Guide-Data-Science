I like having some sauce on my enchies, so I took a can of cream of mushroom soup and mixed it with some of the cheese and 1/2 envelope of taco seasoning.  After I cooked the chicken/potatoes separate from the Zatarains, I dumped it all together to make the whole thing go faster in assembling.

Hmm, a good idea and I fought with myself between a 3 and 4 rating.  I like beans & rice, so thought this was a good idea.  (And I only made half the recipe so had some rice stuff left over for later.)  I thought it needed more chicken, though it was already a little on the dry side.  I dunno - I'd have to work with it.  (I just have to wonder what is the big deal about it "only" taking 3 pans??)

I made this recipe tonight. I liked the potatoes and chicken mixture, but thought the red beans and rice was not a good addition. I would use a different type of rice, perhaps spanish style. Also, enchiladas need sauce, they were too dry.

This is an american version of a "flamingo". All a flamingo is ....is a flour tortilla filled and rolled with shredded beef amd potatos. Then put the flamingos in oven just like enchiladas with out sauce just to toast the tortilla (make it crispy) take it out of oven then serve with a salsa/pico de gallo and sour cream....if you like cheese then add that too!

This was very tasty. I tried to follow the recipe to a T, but the potatoes weren't cooking and the chicken was buring, so that was annoying. I didn't really feel like the potatoes added anything special, so next time I make I will add some more beans. I also put enchilada sauce on the enchiladas before baking, because what is an enchilada without the sauce? Yum yum yum!

Both me and my husband liked this recipe.  You think it will be too many different flavors but the work nicely with each other.  I did ground turkey for him and veggie crumbles for me and assembled separately.  I also used the tip about the cream of mushroom sauce from one poster which was good too.  For sure we will be making this again.

First I used Mexican Rice and it was good. It was rather dry so serving with  salsa was necessary. The second time I used red beans and rice and added salsa to the filling. After baking it was still dry so I added taco sauce and it was yummy. Maybe the third time I'll skip the salsa in the filling and just pour it on top and then sprinkle with cheese.

Prep time: 30 minutes, cook time: 3 hours, eating time: 5 minutes lol was delicious, used red kidney beans from scratch instead of bean/rice mix. Will try switching out beans for celery next time, also add salsa, so more for a Mexican flavour.
