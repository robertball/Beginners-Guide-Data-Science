I know this recipe is meant to be sliced into little appetizer ring servings, but it just seemed like a great lunch idea to me. So I used only 1 T. fat-free cream cheese on my tortilla, lettuce, ham, ribbons of cucumber, and a small sprinkling of 2% cheese and rolled it as directed. I wrapped it in plastic wrap until lunchtime and then just cut it in half and enjoyed. Delicious!

I made these for a quick summer dinner tonight.  I didn't have bacon or Emeril's seasoning, but substituted by sprinkling them liberally with some smoked Spanish paprika I had on hand.  I made them with the smaller flour tortillas so we could eat them as roll-up sandwiches.  I also added some chopped up green onions.  Delicious!

These are so easy and everyone I've made the for loves them. I make my own bacon bits with turkey bacon and use colby cheese. I have found that going light on the cheese is good, too much overwhelms all the other flavors.

Super quick and easy. Always the first to go at a party. Kids love them too. I add my own seasonings,  ancho chili powder, cumin and a few drops of southwest salad dressing.

This was my first try at pinwheels, but not my last.  These were so easy and so delicious.  Everyone loved them.  I am ready to try  different kinds, but like your first born...never mind.  Better not go there.

We make this for days when we are boating. Great as is, or as a wrap without slicing. We sometimes add a bit of pesto to jazz up the flavor. I always make a lot as they disappear quickly!

Made this to take to a wake-big hit.  Just the right amount of food for everyone coming from work.  Made the night before which saved much time!

I made for a Christmas party appetizer so I used thinly sliced cheese and varied cheese type (cheddar, provolone, cheddar jack) and meat variety (ham, turkey, chicken) one of the first plates emptied. Will make again.

I love this recipe. It has quickly become a staple that I bring to parties and family gatherings. It's easy to make and everyone likes them. I have some picky eaters in the family and they can't get enough. They're usually the first ones to dig in when I bring them out. I didn't change a thing about the recipe and I will continue to make this over and over!

Love it!  I just chopped up some leftover Christmas ham and  added smoked  chipotle powder.   Followed the recipe exactly as written and it was so yummy. Even better the next day.
