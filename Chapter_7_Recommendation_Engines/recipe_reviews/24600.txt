This is a great recipe!  You can also use Mexican style processed cheese loaf and forego the tomatoes and onions, but either way my family loved this recipe.  We served with Tostitos.

good dip!  pretty easy to make--it all depends on the kind of sausage you use!   i recommend using ground chorizo.

Made this for a football play-off party and it was a smash hit! People were just standing at the crockpot scooping away.
The host demanded the recipe( and I already had given it to his wife!) Only comment was maybe use more sausage next time to give it a heartier texture. Also, I used a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes w/chilies in lieu of the 10 oz.

the men at parties LOVE this one.  I have taken to using spicy turkey sausage, and always add chopped black olives.  this is one of those dips you can dump the kitchen sink into, and it just gets better.  recipe makes a lot - and that's good, because they will EAT IT!  (I use frito's to dip, but good with tortilla chips too)

This is delicious!  The first time I made it, it was for 6 adults and 5 children, and it was devoured.  Makes a lot.  Two adults asked for the recipe.  It has a little kick to it, but not too much for kids.  Even leftover dip reheated well and tasted great the next day.  Wonderful!!

This was very easy and good. Great for the game. Read a few reviews and added some additional salsa rather than just chilis.

This makes a huge amount. I don't think my sausage was spicy enough. I had to add a good amount of Tobasco to give this some heat. I didn't notice any benefit to adding the sour cream. I tried it with and without and there was no difference to me. I think I will just stick with the cheese and a can of chili like I have always done. The extra ingredients were no big deal to me.

Wonderful!  I made this for our superbowl get-together and everyone loved it.  I didn't have very much time so I did cheat and used salsa instead of the actual veggies, but I don't think it made too much of a difference.

I used San Marzano tomatoes and some oregano to make it more Italian and less Mexican for one of our football parties. One friend made the same dip (we didn't plan very well!) but she followed the recipe exactly.  Both were really good, and you really couldn't tell much of a difference between the two.

yummy!  I love what the sour cream does for this!  I couldn't find hot Rotel (which is what I wanted) so I used medium and just threw some chopped jalapenos in to get that spiciness.  Thanks for the fantastic cheese dip!

My family & I love this dip with tortilla chips. I substitued the processed cheese with cream cheese; which for us was even tastier.

I have made this dip for years, but without the sour cream. I really couldn't believe the difference made it. Dip was  much creamier and has excellent taste. Thanks for sharing!

Made it exactly like it called for. Will thin it out with a little milk next time BUT very creamy and tasty. Definitely a keeper. Btw, I used Kraft sour cream (it's creamier than Daisy).

Very good...but it needs either more sausage or less cheese.  And next time I want to try it with "real" cheese!
