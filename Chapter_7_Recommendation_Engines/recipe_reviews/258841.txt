It was descent for ice cream in a bag, I mean I didn't expect much. We all liked it. I used 1/2 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream. It satisfied when I didn't want to run to the store. The kids loved making it.

Worked great for my high-school students!! The ingredients are simple and inexpensive, and because of the short amount of time required, some kids had time to make another batch if they made a mistake or theirs didn't turn out right.  I will definitely do it again, and I may try adding mint or strawberry flavoring.  I offered sprinkles, chocolate chips, and Oreos for toppings, and they were big hits as well.  Have fun!

Fun activity for a group! It does take a lot of work to shake and freeze. I also needed to use double the ice cream salt for it to freeze well. The end result was a delicious creamy all natural ice cream.
