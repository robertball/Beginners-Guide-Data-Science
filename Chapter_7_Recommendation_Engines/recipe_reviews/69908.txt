I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and did add some homemade taco seasoning to the ground meat. I made bowls of chopped tomatoes shredded lettuce shredded sharp cheddar cheese reduced fat sour cream homemade salsa and additional Doritoes for the family to top their portions with. The boys thought this was great. I'm glad I added the taco seasoning--I think it would have been bland without it. GREAT quick boy-pleasing clean-out-the-pantry meal.

Makes for a quick meal. I made following directions exact. My family was not impressed at all. Could be good if a few changes were made.

This month, the Allrecipes Ambassadors program challenged us to make a 6-ingredient recipe and substitute the protein with sausage.  I read all the reviews, and there were comments about being bland and dry.  I substituted Johnsonville® Italian Hot Ground Sausage for the ground beef which really elevated the flavor and brought some life to this recipe (it was not bland).  For a 9" pie plate, I felt 4 cups of crushed tortilla chips was too much, so I cut that amount WAY back, just enough on the bottom to form a nice crust and hold the filling (I used crushed corn chips, it's what I had on hand).  I browned the sausage and the onions, and then stirred in the beans and tomato sauce.  Recipe doesn't say whether or not to drain the beans, but DON'T because you will need that bean liquid for moisture.  By doing it this way, I could see whether or not the pie filling would be moist enough.  Layering the beans on top of the sausage mixture, then pouring on the tomato sauce will not allow you to do that.  Baked for 17 minutes, it was full of flavor, moist enough, and had the right consistency.  One reviewer said "…not very pretty," but it will be if you garnish it with ingredients such as sour cream, salsa, chopped parsley/cilantro, etc.  Granted, I didn't make the ground beef version of this recipe, but was pleased with the Johnsonville® Hot Italian Ground Sausage version.  And WOW, this is a fast dinner for a weeknight meal with a single skillet to clean up.  Thumbs up from me!!

As the dish was baking we all looked forward to having "Nacho Pie" for dinner because it smelled so delicious! BUT... To our dismay our pie was to dry. The recipe sounded good and seemed appropriate regarding wet vs. dry ingredients and the only thing I did different (according to the recipe) was use a casserole rather than a pie plate. I enjoyed the flavor of the dish and will try it again making a few alterations. Hopefully I can get it right on the next try possibly using a few less chips increasing the sauce or using a can of diced tomatoes instead. I didn't read the reviews prior to preparing this recipe. I wonder if anyone else had similar results? Next time I prepare this recipe (with a tweak here and there) I'll post a new review.

This was good but needs spiced up! This is a very nice simple and basic recipe that gets better with whatever you add to it. I think it would be very good with picante sauce in place of the tomato sauce or maybe add a can of rotel tomatoes to the tomato sauce. I topped with lettuce tomatoes onion sour cream and salsa. No complaints (not very pretty looking though) by the eaters lol.

Yummy!  I made some modifications by adding some more spices - dash of taco seasoning, chili powder, dry mustard and a can of chili seasoned diced tomatoes.  I then added a 6 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also added a layer of cheese on top of chips.  Delicious
