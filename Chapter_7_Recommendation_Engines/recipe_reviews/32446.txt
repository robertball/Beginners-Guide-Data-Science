Fabulous Punch! I made this for our annual July 4th party and it was a big hit! I doubled it and used a liter of vodka (these people like to party)....  I mixed everything in a 5 Liter Igloo beverage dispenser and served it with orange slices and skewered pinapple and maraschino cherries. Very refreshing, but be careful because this stuff goes down way to easy...

Made this punch for NYE 2014. Everyone loved it, said it tasted like Skittles. I used Smirnoff Vanilla Vodka. Be careful, the teens will sneak and drink it too!

Great Punch! Doubled the alcohol and also had to makeshift a second Batch since it disappeared so quick. 2nd Batch I used Mango-Orange Juice Concentrate and Pink Lemonade Concentrate and actually thought it was better because it wasn't so sweet.

I made this for a party this weekend - turned out wonderfully!  I had to keep reminding the ladies at the party that it had alcohol in it - no one could even tell.  I received a bunch of compliments on it.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

Made this punch for a Summer BBQ/Birthday party on a very hot day!!  Used a large can of Dole Pineapple Juice, a bottle of O.J., doubled the amount of vodka and used one 2 liter of sprite and some grenadine syrup, to give it some color.  It was delicious and a major hit with my guests!  Will make again!

This was awesome! This is gonna be my favorite go to punch of all time! Compared to other punches this so easy and economical as well for a big crowd. Made it for a party we threw and my husband who drinks mostly beer loved this. You cannot even tast the alcohol. We did get tipsy on this but I think it's cause we were drinking it sooo fast! Thanks so much for this recipe! Will definitely make this for Super bowl for the girls. =0)

This punch was the hit of our holiday party. We are social drinkers, though, and felt there wasn't nearly enough Vodka so the bottle was left out with a shot glass near the punch bowl for guests to add their more to their own. Another friend made this a few weeks later, omitting the Vodka completely from the punch bowl but also left out the bottle of Vodka and the shot glass for those who wanted that extra kick.

Good quick easy punch. I didn't have frozen concentrated pineapple juice and just used a 46oz can of pineapple juice instead. Also I ended up only using 1 1/2 (2 liter bottles) bottles of 7-up instead of 2. (because we like it sweet)  Went great with Christmas dinner! Will make again.

Love this! I used this recipe for my Bunco party. The girls loved it. It was delicious and not too strong so we were able to finish the game...No "Drunko" here!  It will be used often!

This punch is always a huge hit.  I add way more vodka because you cannot taste it, and instead of oranges and cherries, I add frozen berries to the punch.  Costco sells a bag of mixed frozen berries, or other times I add a couple of bags of frozen raspberries.  This punch is so good and you will get many compliments !!

I followed the recipe exactly and found that I had to add a bit more vodka for my guests.  Still, it was MUCH easier than having to set up a bar with different tequila, bourbon, gin, rum, etc. + the mixers.  Also, my punch container has a separate compartment for ice so it didn't get diluted.

Alcohol content not enough, I wanted my crowd to get slightly buzzed, but it did not happen bacause it was diluted so much from the other juices in the recipe.

Made this for a "filler" drink at a martini party, just in case anyone didn't like martinis. Well, this entire this was downed and people were turning the punch bowl on it's side trying to get every last drop out. Can't wait to make again!!!

I made this delicious punch for a Baby Shower a few weeks ago, it was gone within 30 mins.  Everyone kept asking what exactly I put it in and when will I make another batch.  I have added this recipe to my list of MUST HAVE beverages  for entertainment parties I host- which are weekly.

We hosted a murder mystery party and the guests LOVED this. We added some blackberry brandy to give it a little extra kick. We had no punch left over (and we made a double batch) and everyone said that you could not hardly taste the alcohol...which in turn made everyone really tipsy, however that was the intension =)

Couldn't find pineapple juice concentrate so for both cans of frozen juice I substituted a pineapple-orange juice blend concentrate; used Sprite but no fresh fruit; recipe called for 12 oz. vodka but I used approx. 16-20 oz. My friends mostly liked it (although a little on the sweet side) but everyone agreed that it still didn't pack much of a punch. The high rating is for a simple yet decent punch that can be thrown together in a pinch w/a few inexpensive ingredients. Lots of potential for it to be doctored up w/different fun ingredients.

Great for summer parties. If you like strong drinks I would suggest using 2.5 cups of vodka. One orange cut into rounds will suffice. If you have left over oranges and cherries after the party, pour a little vodka and let them soak and you have jungle juice.

Made this for a party and this went really fast! I couldn't find frozen pineapple juice so I used bottled and worked just the same. This sneaks up on ya bc it is so good and can't tast the vodka. Oranges and cherries made it great for presentation. Everyone at my luau party loved it!

Yummy!  Only draw back is you can't really leave it out for long because the soda goes flat.  I made the juice part and added the soda to each glass instead of mixing it all together.  I also added at least twice as much alcohol and you still could barely taste it.  Thanks!

I've made this simple but delicious punch for every Christmas party I've hosted over the past 6 years since finding it here, and it's always a hit.  It's now a standard at my bar set-up, along with other pop & mixers, beer and wine.  I split it into two batches -- one spiked and one virgin, and don't bother with the punch bowl, I just use large pitchers.  My only warning is to pour the pop in small batches and don't stir it too much, as the carbonation seems to react with the juice concentrate and really fizzes up a lot.  I had a sticky mess to clean up the first time -- learned my lesson after that.  Great punch - definitely recommend!

This was very good at my party this past weekend. I used a bottle of golden grain I think it's called. But its 190 proof. And mixed in with this punch you couldnt tell at as we were drinking. But afterwards is a different story!! :) I will be making this again and again.

I have used this recipe many, many times now for parties, and it's always a great hit. If you're a college student or twentysomething like me (or just like to drink), I suggest doubling the amount of vodka. The flavor is still great!
