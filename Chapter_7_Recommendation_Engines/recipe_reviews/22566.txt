I'd make this again in a heartbeat! I did as the other suggested and used a quarter of the amount of allspice and cloves and half the amount of cinnamon. I made two batches (both tripled) and found the first batch to have way to much liquid so I added more apples the second time around. I still had to drain some of the liquid before pouring into my jars. I'd cut back a bit on the cider next time OR use more apples. I used a combination of Gala and Fuji apples and this recipe has a delicious flavor. My family and neighbors thank you!!! The honey is the perfect ingredient, so yummy!

Double the apples and cut the spices in half. Cook with the lid ajar to allow some of the steam off. Excellent flavor.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used Golden Delicious because I had them left over and I used more than the recipe said, because of the reviews.  I also used a little less liquid and should probably have cut it down by more (a cup instead of half a cup).  I still had to strain it a little.  I also used only half the spices and only 1/4 of a cup of honey and it is still very good, not overly spiced.  I also simply used my hand mixer to blend the apples, which worked great.

I picked this recipe because I wanted to make a sugar-free apple butter.  I used pancake syrup made with "Splenda" instead of honey.  It worked great except it was a little too spicy.  Next time I will cut down on the spices.

Everyone at my home loved this recipe and I plan to make it for Holiday gifts this year.  It took a while to cook, but not long to cool in fridge. The review prior to mine is correct: I'd cut down on the spices next time around.

This is delicious!!! I followed other suggestions and used twice the apples and less spices. This is the best apple butter honey I have ever had and will taste great in other recipes.

I like the flavor of the apple butter and I really like the fact that it doesn't use sugar. My only issue and the reason i gave four stars instead of five was that it is a little to thin. I think next time I make this I will use 2 cups of cider instead of three. Has a great flavor though and you would never know there isn't any sugar in it.

This recipe is overall a good recipe, however the spices about blew me away. WAY too much cloves and allspice, I would suggest, as others have, to reduce to about 1/4 of the recommended amount. (Even less if you grind your own spices like I do.) I wish I had read those comments before I made it! It's edible, but a in small amounts, LOL!
I agree that the honey gives a it great flavor, though, and I will make this again with less cloves and allspice, of course.

First time I made Apple Butter and it was delicious!~ I had some honey apple cider (some taiwanese brand), only added the apples and cinnamon (no extra honey needed because it was sweet enough already) and it's great and feels healthy as well!

This was my first time making or eating apple butter so I don't know how it is supposed to taste or look.  But this recipe tastes very good!  I cut all the spices in half and thought that it was plenty.

Very first batch of apple butter, and the recipe was just perfect (no white sugar), and so very easy to make.  Apples fresh off our tree were used.  Peeled and cored enough apples, then pressed enough juice to make the butter.  This recipe made slightly more than 1 quart.  The tree is done for the year so I'm eagerly waiting to use some locally-grown apples this Autumn and make more of this delicious apple butter for homemade gifts this Christmas season.  Better than storebought and very simple!  This is a keeper for sure and for certain.

First time I made apple butter.  Very easy to make.  Will definetly make this recipe again.  Per other comments, I reduced the amount of apple cider and spices.  I used 2 cups of apple cider for 2lbs of apples.  While the apples were cooking I put in 2 cloves.  The apples only took about an hour to cook and soften.  I put the cooked apples/cider in my food processer and added about 1/4 cup honey.  I only put a pinch of cinnamon and allspice (I don't like it too spicey).  Then I cooked the mixture on the stove about another 15 minutes.  It looked like applesause on the stove.  But after the batch had cooled overnight in the frig it had a very nice apple butter consistency, it wasn't like applesauce at all.

This recipe is a keeper! I doubled everything except the cloves and allspice, but I added 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.  I also used locally grown Winesap apples that are not overly sweet and a bit tart.

I can't give this recipe enough stars! It was so easy to make, and tastes great! I added a bit more spice to mine, along with a little bit of sugar. I don't like mine lumpy, so I added it to a blender to make it smoother. This got RAVE reviews from everyone who tried it. I made this as my wedding favor, and after the wedding, people are calling asking if I had leftover jars!

This was terrific!  I love that it doesn't have all the sugar that most the other recipes have.  My whole family enjoyed it.  My daughter would probably eat it all of it if I'd let her.

My family loves it as the original recipe describes. I find it takes longer to reduce to the thickness that we like than described. Wonderful flavor-our new favorite apple butter!

I followed this recipe pretty exact prepared to make changes after I let it all set for a day. But it was perfect!! I was so surprised that the spices were as I liked them! I will definately make it again perhaps without the honey since I juiced the red delicious apples myself to make the cider and it naturally is sweet.

I did a half-batch, so I used 1-1/4 cups apple cider, 2 large Jonagold apples, 2 TBS honey, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, and a couple pinches of cloves, nutmeg, and allspice. After only 15 minutes of simmering, the apples were getting pretty mushy, so I mashed them a bit with a spoon, and cooked them for another 20 minutes before adding the other ingredients. One piece of advice if you notice there's too much liquid: Take the lid off the pot! Step 2 says to cover and simmer, yes, but if you uncover it, some of the liquid will evaporate. :) I left the lid off for 15 minutes and it was nice and thick. Also, I wanted my apple butter to be smooth, so I used an emersion blender to get rid of lumps. A regular blender or a food processor would work well too! Thanks for sharing, Jeania! It was a little too sweet, but it may have been my choice of apples. :)

Very good.  I used Gala apples which are my favorite!  This is a great sugar free recipe.  I added a little less spice than it called for, and it was just right.  I tend to like things on the spicy side too.  Will give this as hostess gifts and make every year.  Thanks

Not a true apple butter but I expected that from the recipe. More halfway between apple sauce and apple butter. Good flavor though I did cut down on the spices as recommended. I made it because I didn't have time for apple butter and it was good enough. Would potentially make again for the short cook time.

I will probably make this more often than not.  I do use the recipe for apple cider in allrecipe also. So, it does take a little more time than if I bought the cider.   But, I really love this recipe and will be using it over again and again.

After reading other reviews of this recipe, I decided to use 2.5 cups apple cider instead of 3 as well as used about 3.5 lbs apples. I was out of allspice so I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground ginger instead. I also added 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar to the first step and a dash of kosher salt as well as 1/2 tsp lemon juice to the third step.

Overall the spices are a little more intense than I was expecting but I place on using this to spice up my oatmeal so it should be perfect for that.
