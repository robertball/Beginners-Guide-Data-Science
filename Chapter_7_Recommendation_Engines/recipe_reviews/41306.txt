This was a very good punch; however it was VERY sweet.  I'll use less sugar next time.  I also added mulling spices and fresh cranberries for extra flavor.

This drink is awesome!!! My 4 yr. old daughter loved it also. In my cheesecloth pouch i used a mulling spice that had orange peel, clove, and cinnamon sticks.

I really like this punch.  I can't drink a lot of the hot drinks in the winter because they are made with apple juice. The punch makes the house smell good-it gives a warm and cozy feel. It's really good because I can leave it in the crockpot on warm and it continues to steep.  The flavor is even better a few hours later.  I never use cranberry juice cocktail because it has sugar added to the juice.  Take the time to look for 100% cranberry juice.  You will need a lot less sugar if you use cranberry juice cocktail.

We prepared this punch for a Christmas party.  People who normally did not care to drink punch tried this drink and really liked it.
