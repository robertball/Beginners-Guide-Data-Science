This recipe was a big hit, my children love blackberries and we put away quarts and quarts of them in the freezer. I loved the spices and the little touch of orange juice made a really nice taste difference.  This one is a keeper!

I did not think this was a very good receipe. It was way to runny and had to much fruit and not enough crust.

This recipe made a really great filling. It was not too sweet and not too tart, and the spices added just a complement of flavor. I used ready-made pie crust (2) and placed the filling in a 9x13 pan before covering with the crust. I thought it could have cooked just a few minutes longer, but otherwise a success. Thanks.

I used 1.5x the ingredients and put it in an 8x11 pan -- it was beautiful and tasted delicious!  I agree with some of the other reviews that a bit more crust would be enjoyable, but I would recommend this recipe either way.

Wonderful, wonderful!  This was what I had been looking for.  I used a ready made crust and used half blackberries and half blueberries.

Very skimpy on the crust.  The flavor of the spices and orange was pleasant, but made the filling too juicy.

This was the perfect blackberry cobbler. I cooked it for the exact ammount of time given and it tasted soooo good!  Instead of all spice, I added extra cinnamon, and instead of orange juice, I used cranberry juice.  I was also opposed to shaping the top and puting it in the fridge etc., so I stopped at the "until dry ingredients are moistened" stage and just dumped it on top of the berries.  The crust was slightly chewey, which we love!  My husband said it could have used more crust, but all that would require is an increase in ingredient portions.  I really recommend this recipe!

I definitely think this recipe could stand less orange juice, or more flour, to decrease the runny-ness.  But overall very tasty, just not the normal cobbler consistancy.

This was absolutely wonderful! Just the "cobbler" I was looking for. Used up a bunch of my hand picked berries too.

very good, would've been better if I could've found better berries....but that has nothing to do with the recipe, lol.  I will definitely make it again.
