I used fresh asparagus, cooked for about 5 minutes.  I used cooked shrimp.  Cream of mushroom soup.  Olive oil rather than butter.  Closer to 1.5 teaspoons of soy sauce.  I ommited the crutons.  I added garlic, thyme, oregano, and basil.  Since the asparagus was partially cooked, and the shrimp was cooked as well, I baked at 350, just until it was warm, 15 min. maybe.  I ate this plain, the hubby had it over noodles.  Either way, we both loved it.  I think this would be equally delish with chicken instead of shrimp.  Repeat recipe here.

Used cream of mushroom that I had on hand, and threw in some spices--little bit of garlic, parsley, oregano, thyme, and a bare dash of cinnamon.  Used fresh asparagus and basmati rice.  The nuttiness of the basmati paired with the dish really well, and with the spice additions and the cream of mushroom, none of us found this bland at all.  No leftovers, and my husband wants to add this to our rotation.

This was ok.  I liked it but my family didn't like it so much.  You can really taste the shrimp and asparagus.  I only had canned asparagus which became to mushy.  I wouldn't use canned at all.  Didn't work.

I wasn't in the mood for shrimp when I made this recipe but to my surprise it was great!  I added mixed frozen veggies because that is all I had in my freezer and it turned out perfect.  My husband ate all the leftovers in the same night.  Easy Easy Easy.  Will be good any time of the year.

I have made this recipe many times, and it has been both Mother-Approved and College-Roommates-Approved. The recipe is a little bland, so I use yellow rice instead of white rice and it comes out perfectly.

Really salty and mushy my first time, but I think it has potential. I used fresh asparagus and added mushrooms, but it needed a starch or something to cut the salt of the condensed soup and soy sauce. I served it with fresh bread, but maybe next time I'll mix in rice...

I followed the 3/22 reviewers additions - I think that without the added spices the dish would have been a bit bland.

A good, solid recipe - handy for last minute dinners. I used some of the suggestions in other reviews and added some garlic, parsley, and thyme. Fresh asparagus and fresh mushrooms both had a good texture. I used precooked shrimp because I needed to use it up, and it worked surprisingly well. For those who think it is a bit bland, play with some spices to give it your kind of kick.

I used fresh asparagus and cooked shrimp.  I cooked it on the stove rather than the oven and omitted the margarine.  It was pretty good but nothing special.

I made the recipe as stated, and it was very bland. As per the other reviews, you must add spices to it.

Added: garlic and black pepper to the mixture before cooking.  Other than that a great recipe idea!  Thanks so much!

I read the reviews and used the suggestions about adding garlic, thyme, oregano, and basil but then added a couple of dashes of white pepper and served with buttered noodles -  this is a no leftover meal

Not enough flavour and the thought of it as left overs was gross.

Not bad, but nothing to write home about. The best part was that it was so quick and easy, and I'll make it again if only for that reason. I used fresh asparagus, which cooked up just fine with the shrimp, and I added oregano and basil. (As others have mentioned, it DEFINITELY needs more flavor than the recipe calls for.) It still seemed a little lacking, though. Next time I think I'll try soy sauce and garlic. It would probably also work to add leftover cooked rice instead of making rice separately to serve it over.
