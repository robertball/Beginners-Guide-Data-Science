This was a great base recipe. A friend of mine made something very similar with ground italian sausage instead of ground beef. The spiciness was great. I also add in some salsa and more chillies and spices to add flavor. I think i used cayanne pepper and chili powder. 
After it's baked the the corn bread topping is slightly golden brown, top with sour cream!

I changed an awful lot--late and I didn't have everything. It's a long way to the store. So, after that - it was great, and fast!

I used refried beans in place of both cans of beans having neither.  No peppers in the tomatoes either - I'm deathly allergic to them (hubby puts his in on the side). I upped the cheese layer and made a standard batch of cornbread instead of mix (don't use mixes). Cut down to four servings (for two) had enough for a rerun for lunch.

We really like it and hubby said "save it!"

This is a great recipe. It's really versatile. You can use tons of add ins, even in the cornbread mix. I definitely recommend adding in the cheese!

I often forget that it calls for pinto beans so we get it with extra black beans (I love that part, family hates it). Really good either way. SUPER EASY recipe!

This is a great recipe. Fire roasted diced tomatoes are great in it as well.
