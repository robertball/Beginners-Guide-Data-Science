Very good recipe especially now that the weather is getting nice. I did however omit the shrimp since i've never grilled shrimp before. I also added some worshtershire sauce to the marinade. turned out great and even the kids ate it.

I used yellow squash instead of zucchini. Great recipe for a quick, satisfying meal.
