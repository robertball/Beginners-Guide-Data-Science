This was ok but I think the dressing needs some more acidy.  It was two watery to be considered a good cream dressing.

My roommate really liked it and I thought it was ok. It has a really nice flavor, but the dressing is a little runny. If I were to make this again I wouldn't use as much milk.

Really good.  Used feta instead of gorgonzola and used a tad less milk, though interestingly added more milk to make it less thick the next day.  Used red leaf lettuce.  A nice salad to serve with guests.

Excellent flavor!  The dressing was a little thin but I think a little less milk would help but it coated the lettuce very nicely.  I put a few craisins in just to use them up and it added a bit more flavor but would be equally as good without them.

If you love Gorgonzola you will love this dressing.  I used an immersion blender to make this and it was really thick.  The walnuts would be good toasted with a bit of white sugar.  Next time I will add dried cherries and maybe some red onion.  The dressing is a keeper for sure.
