What a wonderful dish!! I made this for dinner instead of breakfast, it turned out delicious, but I did make a few changes. First, I used a 9x13 glass dish, and used 1 1/2 lbs. hash browns that had diced pepper & onion in them, which added wonderful flavor, I highly recommend doing this. Second, I used 10 eggs instead of 5, which was perfect and doubled the milk. This was perfectly baked at one hour also. I used 8 ounces of Morningstar Farms vegetarian breakfast sausage sliced, and meat eaters could barely tell the difference! I will use this recipe often, and definitely make it again using regular sausage. Another tip, the last 3-4 minutes of baking, remove the foil and turn the broiler on, this really made the cheese nice. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I love it!

My whole family really loved this dish.  I made it on the spur of the moment, and changed a few things to use what I had on hand.  First, after reading the reviews here I decided to use a 9X13 inch baking dish.  It turned out to be the perfect size.  Since I only had 4 eggs, I just used those.  I added about 4 ounces of ricotta cheese to the eggs as well, and used a bit less milk than the recipe called for.  Also, I didn't have any sausage but did have a lot of leftover ham as well as a few slices of cooked bacon.  I sauteed the onions first, added some minced garlic, and finally tossed in the chopped ham and crumbled bacon to heat it through.  I then assembled the casserole as directed.  I only baked it for about 50 minutes total, and it was perfect.  A dollop of sour cream on top of each serving, and we loved it!  The leftovers heated up nicely for lunch the next day.

I had this for breakfast today and it was great! I put it together the night before and just had to bake it this morning. I used shedded hash browns and cooked them before I put them in the dish. I also used fresh mushrooms and green pepper with onion that I sauted. My husband and son loved it. Thanks for the great recipe, I will make this again.

I toss the frozen hashbrowns with 3 tablespoons melted butter and bake in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  This eliminates the bland potato taste and improves the texture.  I don't add the onion or garlic powder at all because it makes it a little to savory for 8 am.  I even make the night before and bake the following morning with excellent results.  Delicious!!!

MAKE THIS!!  I made it today for brunch for 7, using 6 eggs. I used cooked, crumbled bacon instead of sausage, and added sauteed onion, garlic and red & orange bell pepper.  I made a crust with the potatoes in a greased 9 x 13" pan, drizzled them lightly with oil, and baked at 400 for 15 minutes before adding the egg mixture and finishing as directed.
Served with fresh fruit salad and fresh blueberry muffins. Everyone loved it!  No leftovers!

I make this recipe exactly as written and it comes out perfect every time and it's delicious! Sometimes I forget to even thaw the potatoes, I just let them thaw in the pan as the oven preheats. I think the problem many are having is that they are using the diced potatoes. Maybe it's a regional thing, but around here hash brown potatoes are shredded, diced potatoes will definitely be too dry and 2 pounds way too much for this! 2 pounds of shredded potatoes though compacts nicely on the bottom of the pan. I bet making this into a couple of quiches would be delicious too!

Just made this, but it is still in the oven cooking so can't attest to the taste.   However, I never could have fit this all into a 8 x 8 pan.  Had to use 2 8 x 8 pans for everything to fit in.

Delicious! I liked the idea of combining the potatoes and eggs into one dish. After reading some of the reviews I doubled all of the ingredients, except for the hash browns and cheese. Since it was Easter, I substituted the sausage for ham and bacon. Added minced onions, 3 T melted butter, 3 T bacon grease, and seasonings to hash browns and baked for 30 minutes before adding the eggs and cheese. I added the the top layer of cheese the last 10 minutes of baking time to avoid it from becoming too overdone. I am sure this dish is just as wonderful with sausage. Great addition to my recipe collection!

What an awesome recipe made even better by so many reviews with suggestions! First of all, I KNEW that I had to make this in a 13x9" pan. No way does this fit in a 2-qt or 8x8 pan. I chose a stoneware-type so it would retain heat as long as possible as I needed to transport it. Using so many of your recommendations, I assembled it the night before, I pre-cooked the froz.potatoes w/3 Tbsp melted butter (Brummel&Brown in my case) for 30 mins.@400F, and cooled completely before layering.I used 4 eggs equiv. (i.e. 1 cup) of EggBeaters, 1/2C fat-free half&half, reduced-fat bulk pork sausage,a little leftover chopped ham (if I'd had some bacon I'd have added that, too), chopped peppers w/the onions, minced garlic, a splash of Frank's Red Hot Wings sauce, finely shredded reduced-fat Mexican style 4-cheese blend (I used a bit less than 12 oz. and it was fine), freshly ground peppercorns, salt, and kept everything else the same per original recipe. I put the refrigerated dish into the cold oven, then turned it on so it could gradually heat up, and started the 1 hr. from there. Plus just under the 10 mins. uncovered, it was cooked to perfection. NO leftovers. It was a hit. LOVE a recipe that can be tweaked in so many ways and come out great!

Great tasting, however, I cut the recipe in half and it filled an entire casserole dish. We thought it could've used more sausage, so next time when we make this and cut the recipe in half we will use a full lb of sausage.

I spread the hash browns into a 9x13" pan sprayed with PAM the day before I plan to use. Then I bake those potatoes in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile I brown the sausage and onion.  Once the pan comes out of the oven I top the potatoes with the sausage and cheese. When cooled I cover and refrigerate until the morning. Set the pan out to warm a little before I pour on the egg mixture - then bake as recipe directs.  Sometimes to take this recipe over the top I add crisp,crumbled bacon,too. It's a 2 meat treat! You have an almost make ahead brunch casserole that is super delicious.

I made this recipe for brunch today and it was really good. The recipe is a keeper. I took out about a cup of shredded potatoes because I thought the pan would overflow and made up another small second pan by adding another 3 egg/milk/seasoning mixture. Reduced the cheese from 12 oz to 8 oz and still perfect. Next time, I might experiment with adding cajun seasoning to the potatoes or pre-cook, as previous rating suggests.

I fixed this for our annual Easter morning breakfast at church.  It was a hit with everyone.  It calls for few ingredients and is quite easy to put together.  It is surely a KEEPER!!!

I'm giving 5 stars for the idea, however, I thought ingredient measures a little off. Too much potato ratio to eggs. I used the Obrien style hash browns (2/3 of bag). I pre-cooked the hash browns & maple flavored sausage night b4. I pressed grease out of sausage between paper towels. Layered only those 2 items in a 7X11 stoneware baking dish, covered & stored in fridge. In the morning all I had to do was add the cheese (I used a mex blend) and beaten eggs (I used 8). It didn't appear to be cooking at all after 30 minutes so I increased temp to 375 and left uncovered. Could be type of bakeware I used? Other changes: I did season up the potatoes and the eggs more than written but not with garlic. Also used 1/3C milk & 1/4 sour cream with the 8 eggs.  I know it kind of defeats the purpose but precooking the hash browns will lend better texture and eliminate any excess moisture problems some reviewers had. If you precook the hashbrowns, use more eggs and seasoning....it turns out pretty tasty! Pretty versatile if you want to go Mexican or Tex-Mex. Or use Ham or cooked bacon in place of sausage. Lots of possibilities here.

After reading some reviews, I made a few changes. I started with sauteing the onion in some olive oil. | added the shredded hashbowns (about 1 lb) to the onion and browned almost done. While browning I added a little salt, some garlic salt and black pepper. I oiled my casserole dish and let it heat in the 350 oven before adding the hashbrown mixture,. I whipped 6 eggs with 1/2 cup of buttermilk, salt, pepper, and garic powder.I added  1/2 cup of mont jack cheese and a little sharp cheddar. After adding the egg mixture over the hashbrowns, i covered with alum foil and baked for 30 min. Removed alum foil, added cheese on top and baked for another 20 minutes (just until browned). This definately did not have bland potatoes!  And since we are not breakfast meat people, the cheese, onions and spices helped with adding flavor that would have come from the protien choice. Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic! My favorite breakfast casserole so far! Simple ingredients, easy to make, and very tasty.
I stuck to the recipe except for a few things...
i used a 1 pound bag of hash browns (shredded, not obrien) instead of 2 pounds (because thats what i had) and that was just the right amount.(i wonder if 2 pounds was a typo?)  I used a 9x12 pan and it cooked nice and even.  Next time, i may bake the hash browns for a while, while im browning the sausage, but it was great without pre-baking too.  i sauteed the onions w the sausage and added the spices required as well as some emerile essence (or seas. salt).  also used a mixed bag of mexi blend cheese as well as some pepper jack(again, thats what i had in the house), and i think that helped flavor of the dish.  Then serve w country gravy or green chili :)  Yummo!  My family is excited to munch on the leftovers before school and work tomorrow too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Will definitely be making again. Halved the recipe, all fit in 8x8 pan perfectly, added add. sausage and used less cheese. Purchased hashbrowns that had green peppers and onions in it. Thinking about adding feta cheese the next time to add a little extra creaminess to texture.

I'm giving this 4 stars with some changes.  I made it first following the recipe except for doubling the eggs. The crust ended up really bland.  Second time around, I tossed the hashbrowns with 1/4 c margarine and 1/2 cup minced onion and 1/2 tsp seasoned salt and pre- baked for 20 minutes.  Then I whisked together 10 eggs and reduced the milk to 1/4 cup. Whisked with Salt. Poured that over the hashbrown crust.  Topped with sharp cheddar cheese and Jimmy Dean turkey sausage crumbles (whole package).  This was much better the second time around.  We enjoyed it with biscuits and gravy.  Mashed up together it's heavenly!

We thought this was excellent.  I don't usually make breakfast casseroles, but this sounded good & easy!  I cut the hash browns in half and used a bag (20 0z)of Simply Potatoes Southwestern Hasbrowns, which was enough to cover the bottom of the dish.  Increased the eggs to 9 (or 10) and doubled the milk.  I like lots of flavor, but didn't think it was necessary to add onion & garlic powder, especially since the recipe calls for (real) onion.  I did however use salt & pepper and our spicy pork sausage.  I didn't layer the cheese, I just poured it all on top to cover the casserole.  So yummy and can't wait for the convenience of having it as leftovers during the week.  Anything to make the morinings easier while I'm trying to get the kiddies off to school!

Not what I expected. Flavor was OK and my kids ate a few bites then turned away. Final casserole looked "sloopy" and uninviting. Don't think I will be making this again.

This recipe is a good start, but had to be adapted to actually work. The recipe calls for way too much potato (I don't think it would even fit in a 2 quart dish). Half of the amount is sufficient. I used only a one 1 lb package of the potatoes with bell peppers and onions, and that was plenty. Using the 1 lb package was perfect for my dish, a 9 x 13 pan. Also, 5 eggs was not nearly enough. I used 9, but that was all I had. 10 would have been better. The milk, onion powder, and garlic amounts seemed fine, but there is also too much cheese on the recipe. 8 ounces was plenty. I can't give an opinion on the amount of sausage because I used ham instead, which was a great decision for my group's appetite. With those changes, my casserole was delish, and a big hit with the family.

This turned out well.  I knew this would be far too thick for us in an 8x8 pan, though, so I used a 9x13 pan and added one extra egg.  I didn't have frozen hash browns and used refrigerated ones.  I kept everything else the same.  Our favorite part was the crispy edges, so next time, I'll bake in muffin cups or mini loaf pans for more edges.  I had more potatoes than I needed, so I made a small pan with the leftover hash browns and used bacon in that one.   But we liked the sausage one much better.  I'll definitely make this again, but I think I'll add more to the mixture...peppers, mushrooms, broccoli and/or greens would all make great additions for us.  And next time I'll mix a little of the cheese with the hash browns before I pat them in the pan...maybe a little of the sausage, too.  The potatoes got a little lost flavor-wise with the thick layer of cheese and sausage on the top.  But this is definitely a keeper for us, and it will probably be our Christmas morning breakfast!

Really good, but WAY off on the ingredients. Not sure how 5 eggs would ever work for this or a 2 quart baking dish. Recommend 9x13 inch casserole dish, 12-15 eggs, double the seasoning, 1/2 the sausage, and add diced red bell pepper, mushrooms, spinach or other veggies. I also preferred the country style hash browns as opposed to the shredded.

I made this the night before and cooked it the next morning.  Easy and good, but I think that I will cook the hashbrowns a little before baking to give them a little more texture.  I think I will add some veggies next time too.  Definitely makes a 13x9 pan and not a 2qt dish of casserole.  We will make again.

I used ground turkey that I added spices to to "fake" pork sausage. I did add a few more eggs, some real bacon bits (I was cleaning out the fridge) and one can of diced mild green chilies. MAN, this was DELICIOUS. I topped my portion with sour cream and homemade salsa.......then went back for seconds. I didn't even mess with my toast. NOTE: Mine took almost two hours to bake. One hour covered and almost another full hour uncovered. Keep this in mind when you make this so you don't almost die of hunger by the time this casserole's done.

Made this for family Easter brunch. Everyone loved it! I used spicy sausage & baked in a 9x13 pan. I did mix everything together instead of layering. Absolutely will make again.

Freeze individual servings for widower living alone. Cooking for one senior is difficult, so I made this dish and then divided the results into six freezer Tuperwares.It's much better than frozen TV dinners.

This recipe is OK but overall it is missing something.  The top layer of sausage and cheese was tasty, but the eggs and hash browns were dry and flavorless.  I even used only about 1 1/2 lb of hash browns and I used 2 more eggs because I felt that a 2 pound package was way too much and it didn't seem that there were enough eggs to even notice.  If I was going to make this again, I would add a can of cream soup and some green peppers or green chilies to the potatoes to make it more interesting.  Also, I would suggest to not use fine shredded cheese and be sure to drain the sausage on paper towels before adding to the mix.

I love this recipe. The only thing I would change is the amount of hash browns to 1lbs, add 1 to 3 more eggsand used Jimmy Dean sausage (it really brings out the flavor). This has really brought back memories of my husband's grandmother. THANKS AGAIN!!!

A decent starting point for a breakfast casserole but I think it needs a bit of a tweak ( for me anyway ).  I came together super fast, but was somewhat dry, overwhelmed by the amount of potatoes.   I think next time, I will add at least two to three more eggs and increase the cheese and include a 1/2 cup of sour cream. Also, use actual onion instead of the powdered variety.

Delicious flavors all around.  I used egg beaters and only six ounces of sharp cheddar and it was plenty.  I also seasoned the potatoes with salt and a lot of pepper before putting them in the casserole dish.  Be sure to thoroughly drain the sausage before you layer it in the casserole.  If you don't do it before, trust me, you'll have to do it afterwards and it's much more difficult to sop up the hot grease with paper towels after it comes out of the oven.  One thing that occurred to me as I was enjoying this breakfast strata was that it would be well paired with a vegetable.  Maybe a tomato and cucumber salad?  Something with a bright flavor to offset all of the warm flavors of the casserole.  Thanks for a great recipe, Melissa!

I wast looking for a great egg dish as we had company coming in. This was the perfect dish. I did double everything except the potatoes. I put them in the bottom of a 9x13 glass baking dish and baked for about 20 minutes. Everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great breakfast casserole. I didn't have the frozen hasbrown potatoes, but I did have a bag of the refridgerated Simply Potatoes, I actually prefer those over the frozen hashbrowns when making breakfast casseroles with potatoes in them!!!

This is my go-to recipe for church meals... I usually make it to serve 150 and it's always loved. I especially like the one comment about precooking the potatoes w/ butter before assembling. That adds texture and another layer of flavor to this dish.  YUM!!

This was so good, we are having it more often.  I did change the recipe like others by adding a total of 9 eggs and added green chile to the sausage and onions.  The chile was hot, so a little went a long way and added a lot of wonderful flavor to this great recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Other reviewers are right, it will not fit in a 2 quart dish.  I put mine in a 9X11 pan, it was the perfect size.  I made it exactly as it was written.  I will add two or three more eggs next time.  Five eggs was not enough, you could probably even double the eggs.  It was very delicious, my kids 11 and 15 and picky about breakfast food really liked it.  Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I did make a few changes based on what my family enjoys to eat. I always use maple pork sausage links and just slice them up. I also add 1 or 2 eggs because it can seem dry with only 5. Definitely use a 9x13 inch pan!!!! I also add a about 2 tablespoons of maple syrup to the egg mixture. My husband hates onions, so I only use the onion powder.  We LOVE it!

Made this for breakfast this morning and it was a home run! The changes I made was to pre bake the hashbrowns for 30 minutes in a greased 9 by 12 baking dish and added 8 eggs and heavy cream instead of milk but the rest of the recipe was the same. The only thing I would add is Cream gravy because it was a little dry in the middle but everyone was very happy with this dish

I made this dish for an Easter brunch and got a lot of compliments on it.  I didn't have any leftovers.  I did use two more eggs and the full amount of sausage and hash browns.  It was delicious.  I will definately make this dish again.

This was DELICIOUS. Next time I need to do a better job of thoroughly squeezing the grease out of the sausage. We also cooked it a bit longer for that crunch on top. Next time we are going to dust the top with panko!

It was a good base, but a few things just threw it off for me: 1) The ratio of hashbrown to egg was too much hashbrown, not enough egg. I would cut the hb in half and add another egg.  2)I used white onion and I would reccomend a 1/2 of some sort of sweet onion, like vidalia or such.   HOWEVER, I would like to state that overall it was good, and with a few changes I would definately make it again.

I'm not one to alter recipes and then give negative reviews. I followed this as written. If you are using Simply Potatoes, they are packaged in 1lb-4oz bags, this recipe calling for 2lbs so I used 2 bags. Don't use 2 bags unless you want more potatoes than anything else, and it definitely does not fit in a 2qt dish. Other than that, it would have been great!

Good recipe but listen to the others....I used 7 eggs and used a 9 x 13 dish. I wish I had added more seasonings to the hash browns and browned them first because they came out rather bland. Other than a few minor adjustments it is worth making this...it will feed a small gathering.

It's a yummy recipe. The modifications I made were: tossed 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter with 1 1/2 lb chopped hash browns and baked in 9x13 at 400F for 30 min before adding the rest. Used turkey sausage instead of pork and 10 eggs. Baked all at 400F for 40 min. Next time I will take out the salt completely, there is already plenty of salt in the butter, cheese and turkey sausage.

I was shocked when 4 adults and 2 toddlers managed to eat the entire casserole this morning for brunch! Everyone loved it and it was filling without being a foodbomb that sends everyone into a foodcoma. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loves this! They love all the ingredients and think that the combination is great. Easy to cook and even more fun to eat with all the smiles around the table. Add more eggs and you will be even happier. I upped the eggs to 11 the second time around and was satisfied with the results.

I made this for Easter for 12 people by doubling the recipe.  It was delicious!  My first All Recipes masterpiece.  It is in my recipe box.

Just made this and really liked it. We made some changes: used 7 eggs, 3/4 c milk, and added some crumbled bacon in addition to the sausage. Cooked the hash browns first with some season salt to add some additional flavor.

Like other reviewers suggested, I used a 9x13 pan, 10 eggs and cooked the frozen hashbrowns in the 9x13 pan for 30 minutes instead of thawing them first.

Ohhhh Sooo Good - Doubled it because of the size of my guests, but didn't change anything else!  By doubling, I still baked it in the same dish, and it was thick, cheesey, yummy!!!  Great left over lunch as well! Will make this again and again!

Really good!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to it.  Other than that kept it all the same.  Easy Smeasy :)

MMMMmmm! This is excellent! I didn't make it exactly as the recipe states, as I had no onion on hand and I had tater tots that I thawed and crumbled instead of frozen hashbrowns... but.. it is sooo tasty! Even my husband thinks it is excellent!

My 16 year old said "This is AMAZING"! Definitely a keeper - we've been fighting over the leftovers. The only change I made was to use 2 extra eggs than called for.

Love this! I made it Christmas morning and everyone enjoyed it. The only change we've made, when making it several times since then, is to cut back on the amount of onion used. Although the kids didn't dislike it too much at Christmas, they now go crazy for it. I must admit that like it better, too. :)

I made this for a friend just home from the hospital from having her first baby. She and her husband RAVED about it! They said it was a nice break from all of the lasagna meals they had been receiving. (I thought 5 eggs didn't seem like much, so I put in 6. And I put it in a deeper 9x13in. pan.)

I give it 4 stars only because you really do have to follow the other suggestions and increase the eggs and milk.    I used 1.5 pounds of hash browns, 10 eggs,  a little more than a half cup of milk and an entire 4 cup package of shredded cheese.  Next time I will also add more sausage. Great recipe and was true hit.  Also super if you can not eat gluten - it's a nice alternative.

This was really good.  I only had hash brown frozen patties on hand but 8 of them fit perfectly on the bottom of my 9x13 glass dish.  After reading the reviews I added a couple more eggs.  We also used hot sausage and ate it with salsa on top, very good!

I use cubed ham or turkey instead of sausage.

I altered the recipe a bit based on previous reviews and it turned out tasty.  I used a 9x13 glass pan, 11 medium eggs,1 two pound bag of hash browns,1 small pack of pre-cooked & diced ham,1 small onion,1 cup milk, doubled the garlic and onion powder, and used a total of 3 cups of cheddar.  I sautéed the hash browns and onion before putting them in the casserole.  I burnt the top a bit. Next time I will cook on 350, covered for 45 minutes and then broil uncovered for 5 minutes.

Put this recipe together last night and had a few friends over for brunch today as my guinea pigs, since it was my first time making this. I loved reading all the different ideas for this casserole so thank you!! Used the 9x13 pan and added 10 eggs (instead of the 5) then I added sauteed bell peppers with the onion. I didn't add any of the other seasonings since I used South-Western style(not frozen) hashbrowns. My guinea pigs loved it and said to make it again! Next time I might try adding a small can of green chilies to the sausage and cumin to the eggs. Love how versatile this recipe can be!

I made this recipe yesterday and my family thought it was tasty.  I made a few changes after reading some of the reviews.  First I only used half of a bag of hash browns as I had read that a whole bag was too much when using an 8x8 casserole dish.  I also browned up the hash browns a bit first adding salt, pepper and garlic while it was cooking.  I also used about 7 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk.  It took longer to bake, probably due to our altitude, but when it was ready it turned out good.  I will make it again and I was happy with the basic recipe and the fact it allowed me the ability to tinker with it.

If you plan on making this, please note that you will definitely need a 9 x 11 baking pan, plus you'll probably want to use at least 8 eggs. In addition to the sausage, I also threw in a couple of large diced tomatoes and a diced green bell pepper from the garden. Also made it with a combination of extra-sharp and Swiss cheeses. Turned out really well, and my toddlers couldn't get enough. Looking forward to trying it with bacon. Thanks!

Prepared this yesterday & it was ready to bake & eat after mass today.
It was a keeper- But a little dry.  I read the comments & took notes & next time I will use 10 eggs & double the milk & probably use the hash browns that have green peppers & onions in them.  Otherwise I loved it & will make it for Easter Brunch.  Biscuits on the side!  Thank you for not requiring bread cubes in the recipe!

I made two pans of this recipe last night. One I baked right away for my family and the other I baked this morning for a baby shower. The one I baked last night I made just as the recipe stated. It was good but I needed to salt and pepper the hash browns a bit more than I had. This morning I decided to add more salt and pepper, while mixing up everything (instead of keeping it in layers) and added more cheese to the top. That really made it great. This is a very versatile recipe. Try using whatever you have on hand, ham or bacon instead of or in addition to the sausage, more onion, bell peppers, mushrooms, added seasonings... Next I may try sausage, onion, bell peppers, taco seasoning and serve with salsa and sour cream.  Definitely going to use this recipe again.

I made this for Christmas morning and really enjoyed it. I used Simply Shreds potatoes in a 1 pound 10 oz bag and used the entire bag. I mixed a little oil and salt and pepper with the potatoes and pre baked them for 25 minutes to crisp them up before i added the egg mixture. I also used 12 eggs instead of 5 and it worked perfectly. I will definitely make it again- would be good with bacon and ham too...

We really liked this dish. I did brown the hash browns in the pan for about 1/2 hour before adding filling. I also used chopped, sauted garlic and onions. Used a mixture of cheeses I had on hand and it was eaten almost before I could take a picture.

Made exactly as written. The potato part was pretty bland and I didn't like how the flavorful part (the meat and the cheese) was only on the top of the casserole. It was much better the next day though...once the favors could marinate some. Next time I will try mixing it all together before baking and maybe add in some real garlic and maybe red and green peppers.

This recipe was easy and my family loved it for breakfast. I used whole hash browns and found it gave the casserole a good crust on the bottom. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yummy!  My 2 and 5 year old kids enjoyed eating this dish.  We added green peppers instead of onions.  I also added 16oz of cottage cheese and used 6 eggs instead of 5.  There is definitely more potatoes in this dish than eggs.  The dish did not taste dry at all - it was perfect.  If you want a more eggy casserole this isn't it or at least you may have to try adding 8 to 10 eggs.  Made again twice.  This time without the cottage cheese which made the dish a bit dry.  Still yummy, but I would recommend using a 1 lb of potatoes and 8 eggs - possibly adding cottage cheese.

I loved this recipe. I added a few extra eggs to make sure there was enough to go around and leftovers for my husband to take to work as I made it for dinner. It was very filling and I don't say that much about meals. I will definitely be making this again.

For me, this was just O.K. Next time, I will add more eggs and add less hash brown potatoes. I will also add much more seasonings since it was a little bland for my taste.

It is easy and tastes awesome! I had to use a 9x13 baking dish, I added green chili's and used fresh garlic. I also used 6 eggs instead of 5. :)

A winner.  Made it the night before.  I did add a dash of Worcestershire Sauce to the eggs and doubled the recipe using 1lb regular sausage and 1lb hot sausage, then cooked at 325 for 90 minutes while at church, then added the cheese when we came home.  Great recipe for a large crowd.

My family loved it!  I would use hot sausage next time and only 1 pound of hash browns.    However, this is an excellent recipe for a cozy Sunday breakfast.

I made this exactly as written except used maybe 3/4 bag of hashbrowns.  I also used a covered casserole dish.  Served it with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits and my kids were in heaven.  Thanks!

At first glance at this recipe, it was apparent that the proportions of ingredients are completely off!!! (I.e. 5 eggs + 2lbs of potatoes= a solid rock of a casserole) I looked at reviews and noticed that people gave this recipe top marks but then proceeded to completely change the recipe.  Increasing the eggs & milk by double and decreasing the hash brown potatoes by 1/2 a pound. Obviously, generous ratings from experienced egg casserole cooks that made the necessary adjustments as I did... But, I was introducing my husband to All recipes to find a breakfast casserole that he would prepare. His first! He will follow a recipe on this site down to the exact measurement of salt. Being a new to baking, he has very little experience to make obvious adjustments that I (and obviously other people ) would make. Hence, the 1 star for a recipe that if made exact would simply be terrible. 
*** We did use this recipe as a loose example. Increased the eggs to 7, milk 1 cup and decreased the potatoes to 1lb. My husband reported this morning that his casserole was still to densely hash brown potatoes. ***

Super yummy!  The only change I made was I thought onion powder and onions might be redundant so I used dried mustard instead of the powder.   Turned out great, whole family loved it, even the picky one.  Next time I might try adding some diced green bell pepper.

Made this for a brunch with friends and everyone enjoyed greatly. A couple small mods: we did two pie pans instead of one larger pan, and after reading a few reviews, broiled the hash browns for about 15 minutes with light olive oil drizzled on top and a bit of salt. We used six eggs total between the two pie pans and kept the other ingredients the same. We ended up using about 1/2 lb of sausage and onion in one pie pan. The other pan I added mushrooms, red peppers, green peppers, and onions as a meat free option. Next time I might try with a different meat or add some peppers to the sausage. I did notice that I used less than 1 lb of hash browns. This is a great base breakfast casserole dish that has lots of room for experimentation. Will definitely make again.

I did like this dish, but gave it 4 starts because if I hadn't followed the recommendations of some of the reviewers I don't think it wouldn't have been all that great.  
The most important recommendation was to double the amount of eggs used (10). I can't imagine making it with only 5 eggs - it would have been very, very dry. 
I used a 9x13 glass dish and tossed the hash browns (only 1 1/2 lbs instead of 2) with some butter and baked them in the dish at 400 degrees for 30 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients (thank you Cat Lady Cyndi!). They don't brown up but do firm up enough to not end up as mush when the dish is done. Only used 1/2 a small onion but that is a matter of taste.  
The dish turned out great and was very popular - but as I said before,  it wouldn't have been all that great without the changes.

Made for Christmas breakfast, easily fed 10 adults.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.  I took the suggestions of a few posters and made the following changes: browned the potatoes for half an hour first, used ten eggs and half the milk. suggested.  Done in one hour. Served with fresh berries and sweet rolls. Will definitely become a part of our holidays due  the fact everyone enjoyed it so much,  the incredible ease of preparing a delicious meal, as well as a super easy clean up.

Love this recipe, with a few changes!  Used 10 eggs, browned /cooked the hash browns / onions / peppers in the oven @ 400 degrees for 25 minutes (used 1/2 the potatoes it called for).  I let them cool and then added them (didn't layer) to the egg/cheese/sausage mixture.  Mixed well and then put into a 9x13 inch pan.  Let it sit overnight in the fridge.  Didn't preheat the oven, just let it start baking immediately.  YUMMY!

I just made this tonight. Of course I tweaked it. I have been wanting to make for a few years but always hesitated. First I used refrigerated hashbrowns. I cooked those in a couple tablespoons of bacon fat. I used 10 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk. I cooked the sausage with 1 bellpepper and 1 onion. Layered cheese on the hashbrowns, then my sausage mixture  and poured egg mixture and then added cheese on top. I did use more cheese then recipe called for but I typically do with casseroles. I cooked on 350 covered for 1 hour. Then uncovered on 375 for 5 minutes. Served with biscuits. My family of 5 loved it. Even my 6 yr old daughter who hates everything loved it. I will definitely keep this in my rotation.

My family liked this casserole and it was easy to make but I gave it 3 stars because the clean up just wasn't worth it. I liberally sprayed with Pam but the egg was so baked on to the dish that after soaking the pan overnight and scrubbing repeatedly, I seriously thought about just throwing the baking dish in the garbage. It may sound dumb but for that reason I probably won't make it again. Sausage & cheese omelets with hash browns on the side tastes very similar, is quicker to make, and is much easier to clean up.

Thank you to all the reviewers!  Using some of your tips, I precooked the hash browns with 4 tbs melted butter for 25 minutes. I sautéed a half chopped onion, half red and half green bell pepper, fresh button mushrooms in a little bit of olive oil. I put the cooked mixture in a small colander to drain the liquid.  Into the skillet I added about 2 cups diced baked ham till heated through. After removing the hash browns from the oven I let it cool just a bit then added the egg mixture (10 eggs, one cup milk and garlic salt and black  pepper. ).  I sprinkled cheddar cheese then added the ham/veggie mixture and added a little more cheddar cheese on the top. Cooked it for 50 minutes covered and last 10 minutes uncovered. This is a great breakfast casserole for a crowd.  I made it tonight so that my husband can have it for breakfast tomorrow as I wouldn't have time to bake it in the morning.  Great basic recipe to start with. Use your imagination!   Will be making next time we have out of town guests.

I just put this in the oven. I used fresh, sliced Yukon Gold potatoes. I used the 9x13 pan and increased the eggs to 8. Didn't change anything else...I'll post the results after breakfast. Go Griz!

I made this recipe exactly as directed, using bulk Italian sausage. It was easy to prepare the entire family loved it. The recipe made much more than I needed, so I made it in two pans and froze one. The second dish was frozen for 4 months, but when thawed and cooked, it equally as tasty.

After reading everyones reviews added 3 extra eggs, milk, and sour cream. Also added some rotel, and used the 1 lb bag of has browns out of the refrigerator section. Used a 9x13 dish 8x8 was impossible even before the extra stuff. It was still kind of bland I suggest maybe some bell pepper and if you do rotel...do hash brown rotel cheese sausage eggs then cheese. I will be garnishing with a little salsa or hot sauce for some flare. Over all great base recipe. Thanks!

EXCELLENT! Instead of frozen I used already thawed hash browns. I did double the recipe and found that in a 9x13 pan it was perfectly done after 50 minutes. Next time I think I will add green pepper just for a variety. Will definitely make this many times in the future! YUMMY!

I made this exactly as the recipe describes, and it just did not taste good to me. My husband, who isn't picky at all, didn't even eat the left overs and I ended up tossing them which is a rare occasion in our house.

Great recipe! We add in extra vegetables (green pepper, mushrooms, whatever we have around!) but otherwise make it exactly as the recipe states.  Delicious hot out of the over or reheated the next day.

Too sausagy and eggy. Next time I'll make potato au-gratin stile, and use chicken (bbq will probably be better) and less or no eggs at all.

Since I can not cook hash browns to save my life, I microwaved baking potatoes, let them cool, then sliced them and put them in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish.  I left the sausage out, and cooked the Jimmy Dean precooked sausage links so we could have turkey and pork sausage.  I added green peppers and mushrooms and served it with salsa.  This was our Christmas morning breakfast.  As much as my 10 year old grandson wanted to rip into his gifts, he didn't want to stop eating this!  It was so good, and my daugter has pretty much demanded that this dish become a new Christmas tradition for us.  We ate it for breakfast and lunch the next day until it was gone and still wanted more.  I'm sure we will have it many, many more times before next Christmas!

I followed others advice and decreased the eggs to 3 and the milk to 1/4 cup.  I also halved the amount of hash browns to 2 cups.  I threw on some real bacon bits and red and yellow peppers for color.  Also using others suggestion, I pre-baked the hash browns for 15 minutes.  It turned out great using the directions on bake time and pan size after the changes were made.

Thanks for sharing!

I made this for an office potluck. It was like by most all my co-workers. A couple of the ladies asked for the recipe. I made this with half a 30oz bag of shredded hash brown potatoes, 8 very large eggs, half and half, colby jack cheese. This dish had a very good taste. I didn't add the onion or garlic powder. It seemed too much with the sausage and diced onion already in the dish. I'll definitely make this again. I think I'll try Italian sausage and some Italian cheeses..yummy

Great recipe! I halved the recipe except I used 1 lb Jimmy Dean sausage, 1 lb Ore Ida hash browns with onions and peppers, and extra cheddar cheese. I put it in an 8x8 and baked for 50 minutes with the foil on, 10 minutes without it. The husband loved it, and even my 2-year-old ate it!! Will definitely make it again!

I made this when it was my turn to supply breakfast for our staff meeting at work. I was called a show off, but honestly this was just as easy as stopping to buy a dozen bagels or doughnuts and oh, so much better. The dish was scraped clean by the end of the meeting. I did leave out the onion for one very picky co-worker and it was fine. He's also the reason I picked this casserole as it has very simple ingredients. If making again, in different circumstances, I would add onion for sure and also some diced peppers. Great recipe!

After reading the reviews I also made some adjustments.   I doubled everything except the potatoes.  I used potatoes o'brien as suggested (the ones with peppers and onions mixed in)  And I used a spicy chorizo style sausage for 1lb of the sausage.  I added some chopped garlic in with the onions and sausage while cooking as well.  My experience was that a 13x9 pan was a little small if you double the recipe because it was pretty tightly packed in there.   Might want to use a slightly larger pan if you've got one!

This was a really simple recipe. I used a hash brown blend that had onions and peppers in it. The only thing I might do different next time is lightly salt and pepper the hash browns before I spread them in the pan.

This is a good base, something you can play around with. I actually had a lot of people to feed and I used 12 eggs. It worked GREAT! Oh and I used potato's o'brien to add some extra flavor.

I made this as the recipe stated. I used maple sausage thinking that would help with the flavor.  I thought the hash browns needed some more flavor to them. Next time I will use another egg and add a half of can of cream of celery or cream of broccoli soup to it and add some Bay Seasoning to the eggs for more zing. I agree with some members this is missing something.

This recipe is great just the way it is.  I notice alot of folks changed things to suit their needs.  i too had to make a change.  I had no sausage available, so I substituted Cubed ham which I purchased at my local Deli counter.  Just ask the clerk to cut a slab about a 1/4" think of your favorite ham.  The casserole came out great.

I added more eggs and tried to use less potatoes but will use even less next time.  I just think I don't like egg casseroles very well.  With the left overs I am going to fry an egg and place on top of a piece of casserole as was suggested by another reviewer.

I made this for Easter morning.  The hash browns were a bit bland and I seasoned them a bit.  I think I will try the hash browns with onions and peppers next time.  I did use 8 eggs as there was so much hash browns and 5 did not seem enough.  My kids did like the casserole.

Made this in short notice, only had whole hash brown patties and beef sausage. Also was out of onion powder, I just added more salt and pepper. I have made this recipe twice now and it is great. Added lots of sharp cheddar cheese to the top. Once it comes out of the oven I blot it with some paper towels due to the grease. Very yummy and reheats well for left over meals.

I made this when my family came to visit us on New Years and they absolutely loved it.  My grandmother and daughter are very picky eaters and they ate it!!!  My grandmother even asked for the recipe.

As other reviews recommended, I doubled the eggs to 10, increased the milk, put in a 9 x 13 pan and reduced the amount of cheese. Used 1.5 lb bag of frozen hash brown potatoes with onion & peppers - still way too many potatoes.  Will use half a bag next time. Flavor is very good.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written.  My family all liked it well enough.  I thought it was terribly dry.  I think if I make it again, I'll add more eggs and more milk.  Possibly less potatoes as well.

I made this in 9x13 pan using 1 lb 10 oz of shredded hash browns. I think putting into a 2 qt baking dish would have been too much. Due to the larger pan size, I think more eggs would work better as 5 seemed too little. It was a little bland, particularly at the bottom where the potatoes were. I think adding in some diced peppers would be a good addition, possibly cooking the hash browns first in a pan would help a bit too. The top where the cheese and sausage was was yummy!

I made this using tater tots and doubled the recipe for a neighborhood breakfast. Was worried it wouldn't all fit into the big aluminum server, but did. Because I live in a hot state and made it in the summer, I cooked it outside  in the BBQ grill, keeping the temp at 350. I had three burners on lowest, and two burners off. It sat above one of the burners, so the bottom got overcooked. As a couple of others, I also thought it was dry, but my daughter thought it was just right. Could have been my method of cooking, using tater tots, or the recipe. If I make again (in the summer), I would make sure I don't put it over any active burners in the grill, and my own preference would have me put more eggs in it to make it eggier. :) I would also season more, and probably add bell peppers and more to give it more flavor. It's hard to know how much salt and pepper to use when you can't test it before it is cooked. I could have added more salt to my own serving, but it was an outdoor breakfast with few condiments available. In any case, my daughter and I are still eating the leftovers and liking them fine. :)

Very good recipe when you need a new take on breakfast or brunch. I made the following changes- I shredded a large Russet potato, rinsed until the water ran clear and patted dry with paper towels. I mixed some diced red onion, and a small can (4 oz) of dried green chilis, drained. (I used mild, but hot chilis would work as well) with 2 cloves of minced garlic, with salt and pepper. I then layered per the recipe and baked as directed. You may want to check your egg mix to compensate for the salt and pepper in the potatoes.

This recipe has a lot of potential. I decided to follow other reviewer’s suggestions, along with my own revisions. I used 1/2 the hash browns (1 lb), doubled the milk (1 c.) and used 7 eggs. In a 9x13, I tossed the hash browns with a 2 T oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Baked that for 20 min in a 350° oven. Meanwhile, I caramelized the diced onion, then added minced garlic until fragrant, and then browned the sausage. Once the potatoes cooled, I layered the cheese and sausage mixture as originally instructed, then refrigerated overnight. I also prepared the egg mixture in a separate bowl, ready to pour over the casserole in the morning. In the morning, just preheat the oven and cook as directed. The last 10 minutes were shortened to 5 or so under the broiler to brown the cheese. Served with fresh fruit salad. My daughter’s sleepover guests had clean plates!

I figured this would be a good basic casserole for breakfast.  Since I didn't have any regular hash browns, I used the hash brown patties I had in the freezer.  Layered the bottom of an 8"x8" dish, added some green, red and yellow peppers to the onions.  Also added some cooked bacon bits to the top before I put it in the oven.  Otherwise, I followed the basic recipe.  My son and I both say it's a keeper.  My wife?  Eh.  She's not a sausage fan, but said it was still good.
Yep, I'll do it again!
12/26/17......
Just did this for my mother and son/dau-in-law and rest of family.... 1/2 bacon and 1/2 sausage in a 13x9 dish. Incorporated another review and baked the hash browns first with some butter at 400 degrees for an hour. Then added the rest of the ingredients. What a HIT!  My 86 year old mother just raved about it!

I made this with Turkey Sausage in a glass baking dish sprayed with Olive Oil Cooking Spray and it was a big hit with my family and easy to clean the pan.  The only other thing I did differently is I mixed the same seasonings used in the eggs and some dried onions into the hash browns before putting the eggs over it.

I really liked it, an easy to make Sunday breakfast . I might try and add an extra egg and a touch more milk next time in hopes of making it a little more moist.

I read the other reviews,I used a 9x13 dish,I used 10 eggs and 1 cup of milk,  added red bell pepper and onion, 1/2 each to potatoes and 1/2 to sausage. I prepared it the night before and baked it the next morning. I took it to a meeting and everyone enjoyed it. There was a wee bit left. Great recipe, I will be making it again.

I made this for an evening meal when we didn't have many groceries in the house.  I used instant hash browns from Costco(they are dehydrated and you add hot water to the carton and let it sit for a few minutes).  I used Italian sausage that I had in the fridge and shredded Tex-Mex cheese.  We enjoyed it- definitely a hearty meal .  We had leftovers and my adult sons took  some for their lunch.  It's  a versatile recipe that you can modify AND it's gluten free!

We enjoy this for brunch, or a quick supper on week nights.  I use precooked sausage crumbles, saves time and messy frying pan.  We like a hint of garlic, a dash of sage and a pinch of crushed red peppers.  We add salt and pepper to taste at the table.

I used the O'Brien hash browns and 7 eggs because the potatoes made a thick layer.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was MUSH!  I think the potatoes need browning first to form more of a crust. It was also kind of bland.  I will be reading suggestions and looking for other recipes.  This was a waste of ingredients.  I'll be using lots of hot sauce!

I have made this for years but I use 8 eggs and 1.5 cups milk, pepper jack cheese and green onions.  I have used various types of frozen or fresh potatoes. I really like the o'brien with peppers and onions already added. I just pre-bake with butter @400 for 15 mins before adding eggs. 
I  don't add garlic powder if it's for breakfast. 

This is also really good in muffin cups for breakfast on the go. Put them in ziplock bags in the fridge.  
I cut up the casserole into squares and put them in a ziplock bag or plastic square containers. Takes up much less room in the fridge and it seems to be easier for the lazy people who reside here to find and use. 
Either of these  forms are great for making breakfast burritos with tortillas for those of us who would skip breakfast otherwise. 
I'm making it right now with leftover cubed ham, pre-cooked bacon and leftover sausage crumbles. Meat-lovers dream! :)

You can also use several cut-up corn tortillas instead of potatoes.  I toast them with melted butter in the oven for 8 minutes before adding egg mix. Add black beans and you have a Migas Casserole. Ole!

I adjusted this recipe due to lack of ingredients and it still was a hit with my sons. I browned ground beef, instead of pork, with garlic salt, pepper, sage, basil and oregano. I also used hash brown patties.

I made no changes to this recipe or it would not be a review of the recipe. It was very bland as well as lacking several needed spices. Next time I think I will fry the hash browns first and add salt and pepper directly to the potatoes. I believe it needs more eggs and milk also.

Delicious - our new favorite breakfast casserole! Used 2 lbs pork sausage and doubled the eggs and milk, cooked it in a 9x13 baking dish. Perfect for our family of 9 with plenty of leftovers.

This is my second time making this. That said first time ok,I tweaked it up a little.OMG. Delicious I used defrosted Alexis hash browns, 7-8 eggs, mixed whatever cheese I had. Then I browned hash browns first then put into aluminum square pan,then followed recipe,served with real maple syrup. Sweet and savory.??

I've made this again today, BUT this time instead of pork sausage I used Jimmy Dean Turkey Sausage Crumbles and it was great and the calories significantly lower.  Be careful with the salt, turkey sausage has more.

Awesome hit!  Used a 9 x 13 pan, bacon and ham, and put the seaonings on the potatoes before adding the other ingredients.   I also added 2 more eggs and two types of cheese - sharp cheddar and mozz.  Everyone LOVED it so I made it a second time during the Thanksgiving weekend.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I Added an extra egg to make 6, substituted turkey sausage, reduced fat cheddar and fat free milk. Used corningware  and greased with olive oil. Came out nice and browned. I also freshly grated potatoes then blotted excess moisture with paper towels.  I pulled mine at 65 minutes because it was done. Yay! Great for company !!!!

I make this every couple of months and it turns out great. I make the following changes: egg beaters instead of real eggs, fat free half & half  instead of milk, cook/brown the hash browns before putting them in the casserole dish, and I also add a dash of basil and red pepper flakes. You can add or subtract just about any ingredients and it will turn out great.

I loved this recipe.  Following the advice of tipsters, I modified the recipe a bit to work with the ingredients I had on hand. Since my ingredients were limited, I used a small casserole dish.   First,  I shredded my fresh potato, which was a large russet.  Then, I tossed it in some canola oil.  I placed the oiled shredded potato in my prepared dish and cooked for about 12 minutes.  Then, I added in three (3)  Italian Sausage links...I simply cooked, drained and sliced, and layered over the potatos.  Then, I  poured four beaten eggs with milk on top with some ricotta dollops along with parmesan cheese.  Voila,...a delicious breakfast. I did not add garlic or onion salt.  I will be making this again and again.  It's easy, tasty and truly a great way to use up your leftover ingredients.

This recipe is simple and delicious. The whole family loves it. I use cashew milk instead of regular milk. I also switch up the meat. I've used sausage, chorizo, and thick slabs of ham chopped into bite size pieces. I prepare it at night when I'm cooking dinner and put it in the fridge so it's ready to put in the oven the next morning. Delicious!

First off, let me say, this dish is delicious! However, after some trial and error, I altered the recipe slightly. 1.): I changed the amount of eggs to 7, because it made it more flavorful. 2.): I used shredded hash browns, not whole ones. Each time I make this, I get so many compliments! Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved it!  I didn't have sausage so I just used 1 lb bacon
crumbled and used 1 c  fresh mushrooms sliced. I used a 8 1/2 x 11 dish and used 8 eggs and 2/3 c milk .
I was out of onion powder so I used
part of a pkg of liptons onion soup seasoning.   It worked out great!

I agree with those who feel that there is too much potato and not enough egg in this recipe. Next time I'll cut back on the potato and add a few more eggs and a little more milk. I also suggest adding a little dry mustard - maybe 1/2 tsp - and browning the potatoes before baking. A nice change from the sausage, egg and cheese casserole with the cubed bread that I usually make for breakfast on Christmas morning.

Was a little disappointed. Tasted good but was on the dry side.  I would either cut the hashbrowns in half OR keep the amount of hashbrowns and double everything else. Would like it to have more egg to it. Overall, not a bad recipe. My family enjoyed it enough to finish it off in one sitting.

Made this for dinner tonight, and while all my children ate it readily enough, I thought it a tad bland.  It's a very good base however, and I plan to spice it up a bit next time.  A good utility recipe for sure.

Great texture, lacking in flavor though. Decreased cheese, used a whole onion and added some mushroom and spinach, mixed ham and sausage for meat. Very good with ketchup, though! Will try red peppers with the potatoes next time.

Everybody loved this Easter brunch casserole.  I used 2 8x8 glass casserole dishes and increased to a dozen eggs.  I only used about 3/4 of the bag of hash browns and it took a total of 20 minutes after I uncovered it.  I will be making this again because it was great. Oh, and I added diced tomatoes to the egg mixture

I followed the recipe as given, and as given -I'd rate it 3.5 stars. I used shredded dehydrated potatoes, that I re-hydrated and fried them. As others have noted, this was too much to fit comfortably into an 8x8 pan.  So I put it in a 9x13.  Since I changed the pan, it was spread "thinner" so I did a layer of cheese and sausage and topped with cheese again (vs trying to split the sausage in half" and I baked for about 45 minute instead.  If left it uncovered a little longer, since I like a crispy topping :) It was moist and I enjoyed it.  That said, it was a little bland for my taste buds. I would definitely make again but add a little "something" for my own personal taste :)  Thanks for sharing.

My family is rating this recipe a 5.  I, however, give this recipe a 3 rating.  The casserole bursts with flavor on the top layer, but the bottom, filled with unseasoned potatoes, is bland.  I recommend adding a can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of diced green bell peppers, and 1/8 cup of green onions to the egg mixture.  To balance the flavor, for our next brunch, I will layer the potatoes with the egg mixture and the sausage and cheese.

The first time I made it (exactly per the recipe) the hash browns overpowered.  Made it again, but this time I put in 10 eggs, 3/4 c milk, doubled the onion powder/garlic powder, added another 8oz shredded cheese, added a small can of green chiles, and a few fresh diced tomatoes. (and yeah, you'll need a BIGGER casserole dish!) It was much better, but still 'needs something'..  (e.g. gravy, picante, spinach, mushrooms, bell pepper, scallions, butter, sour cream, other herb/spice??).  It's pretty filling and hearty with some decent ingredients, so I will be making it again -and continue the experimentation.  :)

My husband and I love this recipe.  I use some cubed ham with the sausage, and use only 1 bag of hash browns. I also precook the hash browns for 30 mins in 3 T butter.  It turns out excellent.  Reheats well too!

I had to use double the eggs. But my result was delicious. What I ended up with after adding the eggs was 5 star worthy. Very good.

Recipe was a good start.  After reading a lot of the reviews and using the items I had on hand I made some changes and it came out delish! I cut the potatoes in half (and prebaked them w/a bit of butter the night before), used smashed up pork sausage patties precooked w/onions, increased the eggs to 8. I also added a 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup of Sour cream to the egg mixture.  I then put a few shakes of Sriracha sauce in for a little kick! I substituted a blend of Mexican cheeses for the Cheddar too.  I baked these as individual squares in my Pampered Chef Brownie pan and they came out awesome; nice and crispy on all sides!  Packaged the leftovers in snack size baggies (2 squares per baggie) for quick on the go breakfast during the week.  Will definitely make again!

This turned out great for me when I brought it to a church brunch.  The combination of egg, cheese, potatoes and sausage are always great.

Delicious but when I make it again I will use a 13x9" pan. I only used a 1lb14oz bag of hash browns and it seemed like a lot of potatoes. Maybe it will be better if they are spread out more. I would also use a mix of shredded and potatoes o'brien.  Having said all that, my guests loved it!

This recipe is great.I've made it twice and my hubby and I love it.The only addition I made was to cover it until the last 15 minutes and I added just one egg extra.Other than that it is great.Definitely a keeper.

WoW!! I made this recipe this morning with ingredients on hand (no onion, substituted pepper jack cheese) and it was incredible. My husband had three servings! I made a few changes, but HATE when people write their own version if the recipe, so I won't!! Definitely worth the ingredients and the time invested and will make this again for Christmas Brunch.

Made a version of this for brunch today.  Cut every thing by half (4 lg.eggs) and made it in a 9" Cast Iron skillet. Just right for two. I substituted Creole Seasoning for all the other spices & used a combo of Smoked Monterey Jack and mild Cheddar.  Mmm, Mmm GOOD!!!

My family really liked this - I used plain sausage and not quite so much milk.  It would be good for dinner as well as breakfast.

This was pretty good! Will be great for a pot-luck, brunch or family get-together.  I used dehydrated hashbrowns, freeze-dried whole eggs,
Italian sausage and it turned out great. This WILL be a keeper.  Three and 1/2 stars.

My guys loved it, but said it needed some kick.  I did use O'Brien potatoes (the frozen potatoes with added onions and peppers) just because it's my favorite.  I had a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  Used a 9x13 inch dish; it needed the 60 minutes, not less than that.  Not sure what to add for the kick.  They would be happy with salsa on the side, I guess.  But definitely a keeper for breakfast if not for dinner.... I don't need a lot of kick to get me going in the morning....

I made a smaller version with changes to make it healthier.  Omitted garlic powder as dont like for breakfast. 5 eggs still but double the milk which I poured over the top like a quiche. 100g cheddar and some crumbled feta.  5 hashbrowns crisped up then crumbled. Added bacon (on top under the cheese  so it browned)  mushrooms, tomatoes, rosemary and spinach, had some caramelised onions so threw them in, it was really good.  Next time Im going to use 1 sliced chorizo instead of the sausage which will give it more bite and a drained can of cannellini beans.

Very tasty.  However, I used one pound of hash browns and 8 eggs.  I also put it in a large lasagna pan.  I don't know how it would fit in an 8x8.  It was delicious and we may have this as our New Year's breakfast tradition from now on.

The potatoes were blend and too soft, and the eggs were blend.  The dish definitely needed more salt.  I would try preparing the hashbrowns first so they are crispy.  I used bacon instead of sausage.  The bacon/onion/cheese part was excellent!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it didn't work out for me.  The only problem with it were the potatoes. After reading the reviews, I cut the amount of potatoes in half.  I also browned the potatoes a bit before baking.  It was like eating mashed potatoes and cheese, which is OK if you like that (I don't!).  The only thing I can think of to maybe make it better is to use potato slices instead of hash browns.

Reduce the hash browns by half and you'll have a balanced casserole.

Breakfast is my favorite meal and this dish is my new all time favorite thing to eat. My husband strongly dislikes breakfast food, but he LOVED this! I will be making this a lot more, that's for sure. The only change I made was I added 1 extra egg. However, I am sure it would have been great prepared following the original recipe exactly.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe once I realized I was using too big of a baking dish.  I used a pound of sausage and 6 strips of crispy bacon in pieces.  I used one can of cream of potato soup as well as milk that I whisked into over a dozen eggs.  I used hash brown squares that I prebaked for about 15 minutes.

I thought this dish was delicious, but I made a couple of minor changes.  First, I could see that an 
8 x 8 pan would be too small, so I used a 9 x 13 baking dish. I followed the advice of one poster here who put butter on the potatoes and let them crisp in the oven before adding the other ingredients.  Great suggestion. I had only Italian hot links on hand, so I used those.  One thing I added was a pinch of nutmeg. Nutmeg and eggs are a great combination, but you have to use a light touch. My husband gilded the lily a bit by sprinkling French's crispy fried onions on top, but I passed on that.  I put a small dollop of plain Greek yogurt (tastes just like sour cream) on mine. Will make this again.

This is a great recipe for Christmas morning. It has become a tradition in our family. I double the recipe in a 9x13 pan. I do not double the sausage 1 lb is plenty. I make it the night before so I can spend more time with the family on Christmas morning. Thanks!

Made this as written except that I used fresh potatoes cut into bite size pieces. I had to cook for an additional 25-30 minutes, (Removing the foil the last 10 as directed.) The family about licked the casserole dish clean. Great recipe!

This was excellent! I did make a few adjustments based on a few reviews, but I suspect even without them I would have been happy.  I made this in a 7x9 casserole pan with about 1.5 pounds frozen shredded hashbrowns and used 6 eggs.  I also omitted the onion (personal preference).  Otherwise followed it as is and it was a hit with my husband and I.  We divided it into 8 portions - they looked small but they were dense & filling.  Took them to work for breakfast each day for the week.  Just right!

This was sooo delicious! My picky husband loved it (he had seconds-that's how I know). I used kielbasa instead of pork sausage since that is all I had in the fridge. Highly recommend this dish!

I made this for my co-workers and everyone raved, so then I made this for my family and everyone was happy again. I used turkey sausage instead and skipped the diced onion. I will continue to make this yummy dish. I loved it too!

With only the slight derivation of using cooked chopped bacon along with the sausage, I followed this recipe with so-so results. The potato layer was indeed bland, as another reviewer mentioned, and the eggs seemed to disappear into the potatoes. I may tweak this with a little seasoning and more eggs.

Holy cow, this is amazing! I make a similar casserole all the time, but this one tasted much better and has become our new family favorite! I did use half and half, but otherwise followed the recipe. YUM!

I doubled this recipe, but only used one bag of the shredded hash browns.  I also added diced garlic.  This casserole was easy to make and tasted awesome!

This was a big hit at our Christmas brunch. I used a 9x13 pan, bacon in place of sausage, and doubled the eggs. There are NO leftovers!

I changed the recipe a little bit and it turned out pretty good. I used 1lb of sage sausage, hash rounds instead of shredded, omitted the onion, 8 eggs instead of 5 3/4 cup of milk, onion powder,, garlic powder, ground red pepper, salt and pepper, and a bag and a half of mexican shredded cheese. Pretty much followed the assembling directions except I cooked the hash rounds first. I used a metal pan so I only cooked it for 45 min, 15 of that with the foil off. It tastes really good. Could possibly stand to be just a tad less dry, so next time I will try cooking it just a little less.

My family found this casserole to be just okay. Salt should be added to the potatoes and I think it would help to fry them before putting them in the casserole dish. Once baked, there was a lot of "water" in the bottom of the dish. We had to soak it up with paper towels. We tried baking it longer, but it just produced more water. The top layer of cheese, sausage and a little of the potatoes was very good, so we ate the top and left about 1 inch of the potatoes on the bottom of the pan.

This was pretty good.  It was a little greasy and was missing a little "oomph".  I've only made it once though so next time I will tweak it a little.  Oh and I had to use a larger pan too.  However, my dad loved it just the way it is!

This is a good base recipe.  However, I found the hash brown bottom to be bland.  I think seasoning the hash browns with salt and pepper would be a start.  The only other thing I did was to add an extra egg and a little more milk, as I found that there wasn't enough of the egg mixture to go around.

I don't usually like breakfast casserole because I'm not a big egg fan, but this is one I have made several times and really enjoy. It's very filling and everyone I have made it for has enjoyed it.

I made this recipe on Christmas morning and although it wasn't the "hit" I was hoping for, it wasn't that bad.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be kind of dry.  The next morning we heated up the leftovers and put a fried egg on top for a little moisture - much better!

I really love this dish. It wasn't dry for me, but I did make a few changes. I used Jimmy Dean sausage (4 patties)since that is what I had, 1 extra cup of cheddar cheese (divided)- my kids love extra cheese - and 1 extra egg. Maybe the cheese gave it extra moistness. Great for leftovers.

I agree that when this recipe is made as written, it is too dry.  I prepared the casserole the night before.  Next time I will only use half of the amount of potatoes, and will use seven eggs instead of five.  Use a well greased or cooking sprayed 12 x 13" pan.  Otherwise it is very good.

I was looking for an egg casserole to feed the finicky eaters in my family for Easter brunch.  This recipe worked perfectly. Everyone loved it, even the non-finicky eaters.  Several asked for the left-overs.  I will print this one out and add it to my cookbook.  Thanks!

I loved the idea of using hash browns, but the quantity was too much.  I'd leave out at least one cup of the potatoes.  Next time I may fry the potatoes in a little oil with salt/pepper for better flavor and texture.  Add a few more eggs and milk for more yummy filling.  The cheese and sausage was delicious.  Basically a good recipe that I'd like to tweak for our tastes.  Thank you!

I made this for Easter brunch.  It was a big hit! I made everything the night before and popped it in the oven after church.  I followed the recipe completely, except that I didn't use 2 pounds of hash browns.  They wouldn't fit in the 8x8 glass pan I was using.  I probably used 3/4 of the 2 pound bag.

This turned out great, I used the frozen O’Brien hash browns (slightly less than 2 lb bag) and omitted the onion. Also only cooked for 1 hr covered in convection oven. Next time I may add another egg or two.

Have made this MULTIPLE times! I sometimes use bacon instead. And I typically leave out the milk and add an extra egg or two. Seems to set better. So easy and always a hit!

The combination of foods is a winner in taste, but this was my second time in making it and I just don't like how the eggs and potatoes get all gunky together. I think I would possibly make it again without the hash browns and just make them in the skillet to serve on the side. Maybe I'll just stick with making a frittata?

Wonderful! I used less hash browns and sausage as that was all I had, and I used 8 oz of cheddar and about 4 oz of mozzarella. Oh, and my husband controlled the onion, so there was less of that too. Still, it was very good!

I made this two years ago for Christmas using sage flavored sausage; it overpowered it.  This year, I used half regular and half Italian sausage, and it was wonderful!  I also par-baked the hash browns for 12 minutes to keep the texture.  This is a wonderful recipe, and I hope to enjoy it for years to come!

I made this for a second time today. The first time I didn’t like the the layers of ingredients so this time I mixed the potatoes, sausage and cheese together and then added the egg on top. Much better. Great recipe.

I am usually encouraged by recipes with a lot reviews and a lot of stars. First of all, this recipe needs to be made in a larger dish. I used the 2 qt dish as directed, but  couldn't fit in all of the potatoes (if it's the first time I'm making a dish I always follow the recipe). Second, I will use the potatoes with peppers and onions because there was not a lot of flavor. Last, I will add some cheese to the potato layer prior to putting on the sausage and onions.

So good and very few changes made. I used a bag of shredded hash browns which I mixed with 3 TB of melted butter and some salt and pepper. Pressed into the bottom of a 13 by 9 pan and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes before adding the eggs and sausage mixture. Because I only had hot sausage I didn’t add any other spices. It was perfectly done after 50 minutes, took off the foil and baked an additional 10 minutes. A keeper!

Excellent! Easy recipe and is very good with substitutions. I had no sausage or ham, but had eggs and hash browns and a pound of ground sirloin that had to be used. I did add chopped onion, garlic and green pepper to the recipe as others had recommended. I made this for dinner for my family of four and only 3 pieces remained. I will make this again!

I followed the directions exactly, as I tend to do the first time I make a new dish.  It turned out very nice and even with all the reviews with alterations, this dish was great and was enjoyed by all who were here.

This can be made gluten free dairy free by using non-dairy cheese just on the top. I added mushrooms.  My teens loved it.

EASY PEASY!  We used venison sausage and it was delicious! I used a 9x13 pan instead of 2 qt. dish. Since i used 2 lbs of venison sausage which is very lean  i added an extra egg and a little more milk.  Cooked for an hour covered and then about 15 more minutes uncovered to brown the cheese.

My whole family loved this!! I swapped 1 bell pepper (chopped fine) for the yellow onion. I also added a container of Frenchs crispy fried onions to the top after I took off the foil. After the final 5-10 minutes in the oven it’s a beautiful golden brown. I served it with chunky salsa for a little kick. I hope this is helpful to everyone. Enjoy!!!

Proportionally it seemed to need some changes. Here are some changes and it was great: 2x eggs, 3x milk, 1/2 hashbrowns, added sauteed sliced mushrooms once and then sauteed chopped red bell pepper and green onion for color another time. Upped the seasonings proportionally. Sprinkled cheese on top only. Prepped night before, baked as directed.

Made it for our house guests and they loved it!  Doubled the egg mixture for a 9 x 13 pan.  Added chopped green chillies and turkey sausage.  Definitely advise baking the shredded potatoes beforehand about 30 minutes,cooled, then topped with sausage, chillies and shredded cheese.  Put that in the fridge overnight.  Added the egg mixture in the morning and baked it at 350 for 1 hour.  Delicious!

Awesome! Will definitely make this again! When I go out to eat, my favorite thing to get is eggs, hashbrowns and bacon... and then mix it all together on my plate.  This casserole does that delicious combination for me (I did bacon instead of sausage because our other dish already had sausage). Thank you for posting this recipe... definitely a keeper!

Was super easy. However, i doubled the sausage, egg, and seasonings (not the milk). I also used a pound of shredded colby jack.  Really kicked the flavor up a notch.

I used turkey sausage.  Everyone at the brunch liked it.  Next time I think I will add some cream of mushroom soup to the potatoes (as one reviewer suggested), as I found the potatoes a little dry.

I added more sauteed veggies, including portabella mushrooms and spinach, used Johnsonville maple flavored breakfast sausage, doubled the eggs and used half and half for milk.  I used salt, pepper, and Penzey's Greek seasoning in the egg mix, and baked the casserole uncovered for an hour total.  Big hit with the family.  Great for feeding a night crowd!

I added some fennel seeds to the sausage...that part was good, but it was too dry, needs more moisture...maybe more egg and milk or a sauce of some kind. I used ketchup.

Very good - I used 1 1/2 cups home fries sautéed in onion and seasoning salt, a 9x13 dish and 11 eggs but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I'll use less potatoes and even more eggs.

**updated review**

First time I made this recipe I gave it a 4 and really it was a 3.5 because the potatoes were too bland and the texture didn’t help the dish. 
Just made it again with the following changes and it is now a 5! Exactly what I had been hoping for!
9by 13 dish
13 eggs with milk and seasonings doubled
1 approx 1lb bag of breakfast potatoes
Maple flavoured sausage 
Used mix of white and orange cheddar plus some mozzarella 
Baked the potatoes in 3 tbsps melted butter and some seasoning salt for 30 minutes
Added garlic and onion to the sausage 
Cooked some yellow pepper and more onion and the added it to the potatoes once they were done

The additional seasonings, cooking the potatoes ahead of time and the different cheeses made this dish so flavourful and tasty!

The flavor was bland for my taste, and a little dry. If I choose to make it again-I'd probably add a little more milk to it. But on the otherhand, I did use refridgerated hash browns, rather than frozen so that might be why. But all in all - good and easy. I'll probably try it again w/some modifications.

It gets 4   because my family liked it. I added some diced red pepper for color.  It think it was a bit dry so next time I’ll bake it fewer minutes. And I don’t think the hash browns need to be thawed first.

This was a crowd pleaser. I did pre-cook the potatoes while browning the sausage. I added a bit of leftover bacon I had on hand. Used 10 eggs instead of only 5–seemed kind of skimpy in the pan. Served this Easter brunch and ended up with an empty pan!

Very good with some tweaks. Baked in 9 x 13 pan. Used 12 eggs, more cheese and more milk (maybe double? Can't remember!)

This recipe doesn't work.  As everyone said, the dish is too small, you really need more like 10 eggs.  So read all the reviews to be able to make it edible or find another recipe.

It’s unanimous, my wife, daughter and I all give this 5 stars! I used a chug of Owens Natural Sausage and made it in 2 square pans. Just the perfect proportion of hash browns, egg, & seasonings. This is a keeper!

Two pounds of hash browns overfilled a 2.5 quart crock pot, and there were so few eggs called for that this seemed like a broken recipe to me.  I diverged from the recipe to make something edible.  If you look at the high ratings, people generally changed a LOT of stuff to make something edible. They should really create recipes that work as-written.

I added red  bell pepper, and I used sausage links cut thinly.  It needs a little bit of a kick so I'm still deciding how with that idea.  However, it was delicious and enjoyed it !!!

This recipe needed much tweaking. I used 9 eggs instead of 5 and 1-1pound package hash browns. This did the trick, it was easy and delicious. Another great option is throw in a small can of green chiles!

So yummy! I kept it in the oven for the full hour, however I think I should have taken it out at 45minutes. The sausage got really hard. Other than that, its wonderful!

This was simple and yummy.  Whole family enjoyed the casserole.  I used the shredded hash browns and think I will try the diced next time just to compare.  I doubled the eggs, milk, onion powder, and garlic powder as some suggested.  I used 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  I will increase both salt and pepper next time because we felt it could use some more.  Cooked perfect in pyrex 9x13 pan for 1 hour and broiled from middle rack last 10 minutes.  I will definitely do this again.

Super delicious! I used 1/2 pound of mild and 1/2 pound of spicy Italian sausage. It's has a nice spicy bite, but not too much. I also used Mexican cheese blend for variety.

Simplified this recipe by using a bag of Trader Joe's Roasted Potatoes with Peppers and Onions and a handful of shredded hash browns.  I was added the shredded bc the TJ's bag is only 20 oz.   I cooked the two types of potatoes in the grease from the bacon I used instead of the sausage.  Once cooked, I added in the crumbled bacon to the potatoes and used 7 eggs vs 5.  I did not need to add any seasoning or onions/peppers since they are already in the bag from Trader Joe's.  We loved to big chunky pieces of potato!!  I cooked mine for 50 min covered and 10 min uncovered and it was perfectly done.

I doubled the eggs, milk, and seasonings.  I also used ham instead of sausage.  It was pretty bland with that change (not as much fat/flavor) so next time I will make sure to season it better.  I also think it would be better if you sauteed the hashbrowns in some butter with the onions and spices before throwing it in the dish.  It took a little over 1.5 hours to cook.

I make this all the time and usually for Holiday mornings.  Family loves it and I feel better eating potatoes instead of the white bread that some recipes use. I buy the Trader Joe’s package of hash browns which are 1 lb. 4 oz. and it’s just perfect.  Sometimes I add an extra egg. I have also cut the cheese down to 8 Oz. Before  and it’s still good. Next I want to try adding a little more sausage. Versatile recipe.

I doubled the eggs, milk, and spices. It would have beeen too dry, otherwise. I also added 1/2 tsp mustard powder like I do with most every cheesy dish. Instead of layering it, I mixed it together. My family loves this for dinner!

Unfortunately I did not pay attention to the title of recipe,. It really was a "hash brown" and egg casserole. Based on other reviews I did add butter and bake potatoes first. I used twice as many eggs and still thought it had too much potatoes but as I said I should have looked closer at the title.  Overall taste was ok.

I used fresh hash browns with green pepper and onions. I think I should’ve added more eggs as it was a little dry. Now it is finished and it looks so  delicious!  I’m sure the cheese and sausage added moisture.  I did use a 9 x 13 pan as it seemed the smaller pan wouldn’t work. I’ll have to let you know how it tastes  tomorrow.

I've made this many times and have made some adjustments.  I add a seeded jalapeno to the onion and sausage while it is cooking.  I also add a can of green chilies for flavor.  This time I used cooked turkey sausage crumbles.  I softened the onion and jalapeno in olive oil over medium heat, then added the cooked sausage.  I make it the night before and then cook according to the specified time the next morning.  It is a delicious breakfast casserole and my family loves it!

Terrific! Used refrigerated shredded potatoes, leftover Easter ham, and half and half since I had no milk. 

I sautéed the diced onion with some bell pepper. 

I like a very crispy hash brown/Crust so I browned those in a frying pan for a few minutes - not to fully browned - before adding to the casserole dish.

Thank you for making Easter breakfast so easy and delish!  My changes were, cooked hashbrowns for 30 mins at 400 and then browned on broil for 3 mins.  Added spinach and a bit of heavy cream instead of milk.  This was a big hit and so easy!

Took some other suggestions. Used 8 eggs and added 1/2 cup sour cream, used less cheese and pre-baked the hash browns in 9x13 pan. Was done in 45 minutes.Next time may add some mushrooms, peppers or spinach. Will try again. Pretty easy and delish.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit!! I have also changed it up by using diced ham and shredded Swiss cheese in place of the sausage and and cheddar cheese.

Highly recommend!  I did not have frozen hash browns, so I shredded my own and prebaked them in the 9x12 pan in the oven for about ten minutes.  Then proceeded with the recipe adding some green peppers.  Will make again.   Thank You for posting your recipe.

The hash browns were a little bland. Definitely needed to be salted and much better with ketchup drizzled over the top when served. Overall, really good.

I think this recipe has potential but needs to be tweaked. The hash browns are dry and don't have much flavor. The eggs get lost in the dry potatoey blandness. I'm going to make this again but with maybe half the potato and a couple more eggs. I might even fry the hash browns a bit before adding them to the dish. Over all? Edible but disappointing

I liked it, my wife loved it more than I did, I thought it could use more flavor, probably would be better with spicy sausage, but wife doesn't like spicy stuff

It did taste better reheated than when it was fresh for some reason, I can see myself tweaking this.  Hoping to add some peppers, and a little more seasoning.  I only used 1/2 tsp of pepper and salt at first, bacon and green onion on top after it cooks.  Also replace half the cheese with smoked gouda

Well, that was a big fat dish of YUM! I recommend using thawed shredded potatoes mixed with a little melted butter and seasoning and pressing them down into a buttered dish and pre-baking them at 350 for 35 minutes. When you remove the potatoes from the oven, add thick layers of sliced cheese directly on top of the hot potatoes. I think shredded cheese can get lost when you mix it in with other ingredients, so I frequently choose to add layers of cheese instead because my palate likes to treat cheese like the diva that it is. Pour the whipped eggs and milk on top of the cheese slices. Spread your meat and veggies of  choice on top of the eggs (I used turkey bacon cooked with fresh spinach) and bake it (covered with foil) at 350 for about 35 minutes. When the eggs are nearly set, bake the dish uncovered for another 10 minutes, and you will be good to go! It would be very easy to build an entire brunch around this dish. Blueberry muffins, fruit, mimosas, whatever appeals to you! This dish can make you a stay-at-home brunch superstar!

Did cut down recipe from 6 to 4 servings. Was okay. Followed recipe. Boring.  Needs acid. Was better when I topped with a dab of sour cream. Used O'Brien hash browns, texture of everything was fine, not mush.  May make again because was so easy and filling.

I doubled this and made two casseroles for Christmas brunch.  Everybody loved it and had seconds and thirds.  I added a lot more eggs, like 10 per 9x13 dish.  It took a bit longer to cook, about another 30 minutes, since I added the additional eggs.  I did as another suggested and cooked the hash browns in a hot oven 400 for 15 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  A definite hit with my family.

This was delicious! I made for a Christmas Eve party, and my family loved it!!  I used 1/2 a bag of shredded hashbrowns and diced 2 onions up. I fried the hash browns and onions in a skillet until slightly crispy. I seasoned the eggs with salt and pepper *eye balled this,* doubled the milk and eggs for the sausage mixture, and left out the garlic and onion powder. I spread the hashbrows out in the bottom of a casserole dish, poured the sausage mixture over, and spread cheese ontop. Cooked for 45 minutes in the oven on 350 with foil ontop, per receipe. Turned out perfect

I've made this quite a few times for when it's my turn to bring in "goodies" for work at Christmas.  I really like this recipe.  I followed it pretty much, except I upped the eggs to a dozen and 1 cup of milk.  I also fried up sweet peppers and green onion to add to the sausage mixture, then I threw all of it one big bowl.  Stirred it together and put it in the baking dish that way instead of layering it.  It's a hit and everyone wants the recipe :)  Kudos to the submitter!  two thumbs up!

I agree with the other reviewers - needs revision. It's way too dry. I'd decrease the hash browns (seems like they're not given chance to crisp with so much) and increase the eggs. Maybe use southwest seasoned hash browns for more flavor because it's a bit bland.

Ok I tried this recipe as is, and as is it's not so great. I used shredded hash browns and substituted a seasoning mix for the garlic and onion. Anyway the problem was it came out dry and I couldn't even taste or see the eggs. IMO 5 eggs isn't nearly enough.  So I currently have batch #2 in the oven, and took another review's suggestion to double the eggs and milk. Also this time I'm using diced hash browns, just to try something different. When I added the eggs this time it looks like a much better egg to potato ratio. If I can I'll update when it's done.

It was really good but I would make some minor changes. Less potatoes and use the shredded kind. More cheese and some peppers and onions. Will be making this the day after Thanksgiving!!

Wish I would have read some of the reviews before making it. definitely needs help with flavors, spices or whatever your taste is because for me it was bland. Now my wife thought it was just right for a breakfast or brunch as I said all in your taste.

The only thing I changed was I just used 1 lb bag of frozen hash browns, otherwise followed recipe as written. I melted butter in 2 qt casserolle dish as oven preheated, then took out and put hash browns in. I patted them down pretty good, poured egg mixture and layered sausage and cheese. Oh, I also didn't put back in oven for 10 min uncovered as mine was done at 1 hour and the extra 10 would have made it too dry.

This is very easy and delicious. I don't add the salt or pepper as my boyfriend doesn't like salted foods, so I just add my salt and pepper after I put it on my plate. I use sharp cheddar instead of regular cheddar. This is going in my recipe book! Definitely will make again!

The flavor of this was delicious! I made it for an extended-family brunch and almost everyone had seconds. I doubled the recipe and used an 11x17" casserole dish. I had to omit the onion, onion powder and garlic powder due to family allergies and was a little apprehensive it would be bland. I didn't even miss the exclusions, so I imagine it will taste fabulous when I include them when I make it for just my immediate family. The only other changes I made were purely for bulk reasons since there were so many people. I tripled the eggs (15 total) and the milk (1-1/2 cups). It still baked beautifully without extra time and did not change the flavors. There was quite a bit of grease on the top (from the cheese) when I pulled into from the oven, which I easily mopped up with paper towels. This recipe has already been added to the family-recipe cookbook.

This is a great recipe. A friend from work gave it to me several years ago. It is great around the holidays for me. My family travels to Gramma's house. I usually brown the sausage the day before. My only change is I add sautéed mushrooms which my family likes.

Non-stick foil lined load pan. Butter cooking sprayed. Baked 3 frozen hashbrown rectangles 350 20m uncovered. Poured over egg mixture (4 eggs, a handful of sausage, a bit of grn onions, 1/2 cup milk, pepper), baked uncovered 20m. 3 slices provolone, baked 10m uncovered. Didn't use garlic or onion powder- not for breakfast, and already had a bit of green onion in egg mix. Hash brown flavor really came through, crispy and not soggy or bland! Made 3 servings.

This dish is so good! I added a couple extra eggs, cheese and only got rid of some of the grease. We ended up putting a lily pace picante sauce! My husband and I ate 1/2 the pan.

Like other reviews, I was concerned about it being to dry, BUT I actually liked the end result. The potato/egg bottom half was light and fluffy, which made this casserole a stand-out in its category.

Great recipe!!! Made it exactly as written for the guys painting my house. They loved it! One bragged so much to his wife that she called for the recipe.  I would add more salt and pepper to the egg mixture the next time. But great overall!

I made this for Easter brunch and it was delicious! In fact, my husband finished it off as leftovers for several days after. Similar to another post, I made it the day before with cooked hash browns. Turned out perfect the next day, no problems.

This was really good and my fiancé who LOVES EGGS, sausages, potatoes and cheese was thrilled to have them all in one. I tried adding the cheddar soup to the hash browns as recommended by another review but I will not add that the next time. Perfect make ahead meal for a breakfast on a holiday weekend when you are expecting company.

I added 8 eggs instead of the 5 it calls for and a little more milk. This made it more moist and more to my liking. Next time I'm going to make it with the southwest style hash browns to spice it up.

Of all the egg casserole recipes I have tried, this one is my favorite.  I don't usually change a recipe before I make it the first time, but all of the suggestions made perfect sense to me so I adapted as needed.  I cooked one package of Simply Potato hash brown potatoes in the pan first, left out the onion powder, and increased the number of eggs to 10.  Cooked it in a 9x13 non-stick metal pan.  It came out perfect!

Fantastic dish!  I followed a few of the suggestions posted by others and this turned out wonderfully.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and minced onions to the potatoes and baked the shredded hash browns in a greased  9x13 glass  pan at 400 for about 15 minutes.  This made a nice bottom crust.  I doubled the eggs and the milk and this was a perfect amount for us.  I always mix my own sausage patties by using ground pork, dried sage & thyme, mace or ground cloves, salt, pepper, dehydrated garlic and onions, and maple syrup.  I mixed this all together and fried it until the pork was done in large crumbles.  After adding the pork and cheese, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfectly done in 1 hour at the stated 350 degrees.  A  giant hit with the family!  Thanks for this yummy recipe.

Followed the reviewer who doubled the eggs and milk in a 9x13 glass pan and I used half a bag of shredded potatoes that I cooked in the oven at 400!with a bit of coconut oil for 20 minutes before adding the egg mixture. Also sautéed 1 medium onion, red and yellow peppers, and mushrooms instead of sausage. It's a complete meal and filling but light too, not wet like some other eggs casseroles I've made. Definitely recommend this recipe and will be putting it into rotation.

This is a basic recipe that you can make your own and change  with your mood and ingredients on hand. I didn't have sausage so I used bacon and added frozen chopped peppers.
Next time I may even add some cooked broccoli. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make this again and again.

I changed the milk to Almond milk unsweetened. I used O'Briens hash brown potatoes with peppers and onions but everything else was from the original recipe. It turned out delicious. Since I live alone,I cut it into Single servingsquares put it in the freezer.  I take out wanted to time microwave it for one minute and it's ready for a breakfast. I eat it with hot sauce sometimes and sometimes I pour maple syrup over it. The sweetness of the maple syrup makes outstanding   I will definitely make this recipe again thank you for sharing it

I make this all the time.  I am not a fan of sausage so I usually use ham.  This is one egg recipe that actually tastes better re-heated.  I did as one person said and put the hash browns in the pan and dot with butter and bake first.  I also toss on the sausage (or ham) with this.  No need to dirty another pan heating. I add fresh onions and garlic and put on top of hash browns too.  One time I did not have hash browns, but had hash rounds.  I layered the pan with these and other ingredients and baked first .  Worked great.  Add the eggs and finish baking.  So easy.

If I made it the way it's listed, I would give it three stars. As most people said, it's far too dry. I only used one pound of hashbrowns with six eggs and it was still too dry. I thought one pound of hashbrowns was more than enough. And I would use 9 eggs next time. I also used Italian sausage.

I cut the recipe in half because there is only 3 of us.  I used 3 eggs and 1/2 c of milk because these dishes are always dry.  Instead of measuring out the spices I put in 1/2 tsp of Tony's because potatoes need a lot of salt.  I also cooked it for 45 min since it wasn't as thick as the full recipe.  It turned out perfect!

Finally, a breakfast casserole my husband likes! I will definitely make this again. I had regular sausage, and it was still flavorful. I also added black beans that were leftover in the refrigerator; a nice addition.

It's okay, way too many potatoes for our taste.  If I made it again, I'd use half as many hash browns.  Homemade salsa topped it off really well.

This is delicious.  I made it in a 9X13 pan and it fit nicely but I would prefer more eggs.  Will definitely make again but will try 7 eggs next time.

I made this for my family Christmas morning. I prepared it the day prior and put it in the oven Christmas morning.  I doubled the amount of eggs and milk, left out the onions, and used Ore Ida shredded potatoes. This was delicious. It served 8 adults.

I made a smaller meal, 3 eggs and a little egg beaters. Bacon instead of sausage, and baked for about 45 mins. Came out great!

I made this Christmas morning for my family of eight. It was delicious and everyone loved it!! I read the reviews and since there was eight adults I doubled the recipe and put it in a large glass dish (9 x 12). It was perfect and yummy.

I used 8 eggs and only about 3/4 of the amount of milk required. Also I lightened up on the cheese. No need for all that cheese.

After reading some of the reviews, I also doubled the eggs and milk.  I made it the day before so it was ready for our Christmas morning brunch. I took it out of the fridge 30 minutes before baking and baked for 1 hour covered and an additional 10 minutes uncovered. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas breakfast for my wife and I and made one adjustment.  I used only 1 lb. of hash browns and the rest of the recipe I followed.  Of course I didn't measure out anything and just did an 'eyeball look, that's enough' on the dry ingredients and it all came out great.  I like spicier foods but didn't put anything else in so all who ate would enjoy.  I would definitely make this again.  Simple, easy, and not a lot of effort.

This casserole was tasty but not what I imagined. I was looking for a hearty, homemade feeling egg casserole. This ended up having processed, out of a box taste. My kids, who liked it, called it the " McDonald's breakfast casserole". I think it was the hasbrowns. If I was to make it again, I would probably use some russet potatoes.  
So overall, tasty but not wholesome.

I didn't even use the full amount of potatoes and I thought it was WAY too much. Very dry. And yes, I used the shredded kind. My family said they loved it... Next time I would do maybe half the potatoes, add some bacon, green pepper, probably some mushroom.

Have made this several times & will make again. Always a hit with company. sometimes I do use "Maple Breakfast Sausage" (the recipe is on this site) in place of the plain pork sausage.

I didn't really make any changes, used a few more eggs just because I like eggs and kind of measured it all by hand. This was great! I also didn't cook for the extra 10 minutes.

I didn't use sausage, I used ham because that's what I had. Maple-flavored sausage would have been better. Also, I had to use a 3qt glass casserole dish because all of the ingredients wouldn't fit in the 2qt. Even then, I couldn't get all the hashbrowns in. The amount of eggs was then not enough to fill the 3qt.... So I adjusted amounts of things and, in the end, I had to use ketchup. The flavor just wasn't there. But it definitely fills you up and reminds me of simple food my non-cooking parents made me.

Very good recipe!  I made this for  a ladies brunch and received many compliments.  I used the 2 lb. pkg of  hash browns and added 1 more egg .  Baked in a 13 x 9 inch glass pan .  I think next time I will double the amount of eggs.  This is a very versatile dish.     It was almost like a frittata.  Next time I may add different veggies, mushrooms or sun dried tomatoes.    I will definitely be keeping this one in my recipe file.  Thank you!

I loved this, but I made a few changes.  I changed the frozen hash browns to one 4.2 ounce box of dried hash browns.  I let them soak in water while I cooked the sausage.  I also changed the 12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese to 6 ounces of Cheddar and 6 ounces of Pepper Jack cheese.   Perfect for our family!

It really is great.  I added in one more egg and a little bit of chopped green pepper.  I used 9x13 Pyrex dish.  I will spray inside of aluminum foil before cooking next time and use 1-1/2# potatoes and 8 eggs.  I live by myself, so I divided it up into portions and froze in reusable microwavable containers for easy future breakfasts.

Baked it in a 13 x 19 Pyrex dish and everything fit well.  Used 8 eggs instead of 5 and 1 cup of 2% milk and used 1# of diced ham.  It was good but next time I will pre-cook the potatoes.  4 rating instead of 5 as it was a little bland (read more salt, pepper or something to spice it up a bit.  I will definitely make it again though.

First the good.  It's very easy to make and has a wonderful flavor.  Now the bad.  It was very dry.  My original thought when I added the egg mixture was that it needed more eggs but I decided to follow the recipe as written and see how it turned out.  Also the baking time was too long.  I checked it after it had baked for 45 minutes and it was done.  I'll make it again but make the following modifications - increase the eggs used to 8 and shorten the bake time to 45 minutes and add more time if needed.

It's not bad, but unlikely I will make again. I used a 13x9 glass pyrex container to bake it in. If I had used all the shredded hashbrowns, it would have completely filled the container to the top. I had to remove some to leave room for the sausage mixture, eggs and cheese. 5 eggs was not enough. When I added the egg mixture, it did not evenly cover bottom of pan. It was as if the hasbrowns sucked up the egg mixture and it didn't seem to get spread throughout. Once prepared it was quite bland.

I will add another egg or two next time and some parsley for color.  Other than that, it was very good.  I did use shredded has browns, not the "southern style" cubed ones.

This was delicious! The first time I made it exactly to the directions. 5 eggs is nowhere near enough. This time I used 12 eggs, 1 -1/2 pounds of  sausage, and 1-1/4 cups milk, and everything else stayed the same. I did cook the shredded hashbrowns in the oven for 20 minutes first. Next time I'll have to find a better way to drain all the excess oil out of the sausage. I ended up having to take it out of the oven halfway through cooking to pour off the oil that was collecting at the top. Other than than that, perfect. This will be go-to casserole from now on.

I made this today and followed the recipe except I did use a 9x13 pan which it totally needed. The cook times worked perfect for our oven. It was pretty good and enjoyed by all, though I'll be making some adjustments. Next time I'll saute a red bell pepper with the onion, maybe even add some mushrooms and green onion, add more garlic powder, and probably use 7 or 8 eggs instead of 5. I'll also cook the hash browns per package recommendation prior to placing in the baking pan for more flavor. I'm glad I tried this and will be using it again.

Very good!  I made a few changes because my hubby & I do not eat pork.  I used smoked turkey saugage (i shredded with chesse shredder), I used about half of the hasbrowns and added 2 more eggs. Turned out wonderful.

This has a good flavor (I used a spicy turkey sausage) but the potatoes are just mush on the bottom. I used about a cup less than called for because it was too much for the pan.  You could certainly substitute mashed potatoes and achieve the same texture.  I doubt I will make this again.

I made a vegetarian version of this so I didn't include the meat. I also reduced the amount of cheese  (using just over half of what it called for). I added a few slivers of butter on top of the potatoes for flavor. Turned out great!!

Everyone loved it.  I didn't make changes but I did follow one reviewers advice and cooked the hash browns tossed w 3 tbs melted butter for 30 minutes in the oven at 350, which browned them nicely on the bottom and gave the casserole a nice texture.  I prepped it the night before, then cooked it the next morning.

This was a very good breakfast casserole. I did increase the eggs to eight so the potatoes would be covered. I think if I make it again I will mix the hash browns, sausage and cheese before spreading in the pan to avoid a solid layer of potato. You could also substitute chorizo for the sausage to give it a spicy Mexican flavor.

Let begin with this is a great recipe but some of the ingredients I did not have. This is why I wanted to give it a 4 1/2 stars but you can't.    Like many I had to make an modification to this recipe.  I placed mine into two 8x10 metal (roughly in size) pans.  To modify the recipe I pre cooked in the oven, the hashbrowns with Adobo seasoning for 20 min.  I did not have green peppers or garlic.  While that was cooking I sautéd my packaged,  pre-cubed ham, in butter.  I added a 1/4 cup of minced onions .  I layered as per directions.  Then gave it a gentle mix/fold to combine all the ingetdents.  I refridgerated over night  and covered with aluminum foil. When I woke I placed in the oven for about 45 min since I have a convection oven and food cooks really fast in it! Between the ham, cheese and onions this is a very rich tasting breakfast. No salt is required after baking.  In my pan it raised to about an inch in height.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again! Like most others, I made some changes. I used a 9x13 glass dish, and only used 1 lb. shredded hash browns, which was plenty. I used ten eggs and only half a pound of sausage. Next time, I will probably pour some melted butter on the hash browns before pouring the eggs in, as the potatoes were a little bland. I just guesstimated the amount of cheese. Also, I might double the spices next time since I doubled the eggs. Used the same amount of milk as the recipe called for, though, and was very pleased with the consistency! Great recipe!!

I followed the recipe to the letter. Turn out very good. How ever, the recipe call for a 2 qt baking dish. No way this recipe will fit in that size dish. I used a 3 qt (9x13) dish. Worked very well.

I made  several suggested changes; pre-cooked the hash browns and dotted the top with 1/2 a stick of butter,  increased the eggs to 10 as well as the milk to 1 cup.  I put it together the night before I needed it, baked the next morning and it turned out delicious.

Turned out good. Think I'll use Two more eggs next time. I did add spinach and used ham because family doesn't care for sausage. Also, I will definitely use nonstick foil in bottom of pan next time. Definitely a keeper. Used 9x13 pan, was thin but good.

This was delicious!! I will definitely save and make again... My guests ate the entire 9x13 pan!

The recipe calls for 2 pounds of hash browns. My 2.5 quart dish would only hold 1 pound. 
I followed the recipe with that exception. It was a hit with my company.

Made in a 9x13, based on reviews, and still had to remove some of the shredded potatoes. I didn't thaw, so put them in the casserole dish and put in oven as it was preheating. Again, based on reviews, doubled the egg and milk, but used mostly egg whites and turkey sausage. It was just too dry for our taste - perhaps from the preheating...? Had to serve w a lot of sour cream.

I made this for Sunday brunch. It was very good. I used 7 eggs and I pressed the hash brown into a crust (up the sides and on the bottom of the casserole) and cooked the potatoes for about 15 minutes before pouring in the other ingredients and cooking. I didn't have any onion powder but thought it was great with just the sauteed onion. I also added a red bell pepper.

Using an 11x15 metal pan, I used 1.5 lbs shredded hash browns on the bottom,  and sprinkled  3/4 cup chopped roasted red pepper on top of potatoes before adding 10 eggs & 1 cup milk egg mixture.  Following the recipe,  otherwise doubled.  I used 1 lb  cooked pork sausage,  but in the end sprinkled bacon crumbles over the top. Baked 375* for one hour. Was great!  Very versatile. Gluten free!

I put it together the night before and then baked it in the morning.  Cut the potatoes in half, used 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk. Next time I want to use maple sausage and Swiss cheese. Maybe add peppers or mushrooms.

Really yummy comfort food!  We made it for dinner.  I recommend a few changes. No way 2 pounds of hash browns will fit in a 2-quart; I used my giant Corningware dish (16x10?).  The next time I make it, I will mix the sausage and half the cheese into the hash browns and then pour the egg mixture over all, topping with cheese.  If you just put the sausage on top, you end up with a solid mass of hash browns on the bottom.  I may even cut back on the hash browns a bit too.

Second rating is a 5 Star. I corrected my mistake and used seasoned breakfast sausage (Jimmy Dean Maple) I added chopped bell pepper with the onion and it is a hit. Delicious all the way around. Thank you  Malissakovacs07. You truly inspire.




I won't rate this one yet since I used ground pork instead of ground breakfast sausage. My mistake. I did not read the labell carefully at the meat section. That being said.... it is very important that you use ground breakfast sausage for this recipe. Because of my oversight with the meat, it was bland and uninteresting. However, the texture and look was lovely. I will definitely be making this again WITH breakfast sausage and un updated rating.

Used 12 eggs and a 13X9 pan.  Diced up some red and yellow peppers, zucchini, and jenny-0 cooked turkey sausage and it was terrific.  It cooked for about 40 mins.  Big help was to cook all the veggies and do all the dicing Fri night and then just add eggs Sat morn.

Made this today and everyone loved it! I changed it to our tastes...a layer of cooked tater tots, 7 eggs with half and half , sausage, & cheese. I mixed it halfway through the cook time...just to check on the process and it actually scrambled the tater tots nicely. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe as long as the eggs are cooked. We will make this again...and again...and again!!

I've made this three times over the past month - with the holidays and out of town guests. I made it day of and ahead of time and both times it turned out great.  The potatoes make it filing.  I used hash brown patties twice and that worked really well and tasted great.  Easy to change up ingredients and impossible to ruin.

We took this to a church dinner where everybody brought a breakfast casserole! What amazing variety we found! We followed a suggestion and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, used only one pound of shredded hash browns, and used 7 eggs. It was great! One of the best there, IMHO. Will try it next exactly as Melissa does it. MIght try it with cornflakes on top, a very common practice we saw.

Made it twice now, using amounts available. The time I used only 3 eggs, I lined 2 cups of shredded hash browns on the bottom of a greased 8 X 8 glass dish. I seasoned the potatoes with about 1 TB. Lawry's Seasoned Salt (my favorite) and 1/2 tsp. freshly-ground pepper before adding egg/milk mixture. I then layered 1/2 pound crumbled sausage/onion/mushroom (pizza fixins leftover from night before). Forgot to layer the cheese, so I added 1 cup of cheddar/jack cheese on top before covering with foil. I checked for doneness at 30 mins. (it was firm) and removed foil for final 5 mins. of baking. The hash browns formed a brown crust around the edges. Served on small plates with a few wedges of tangelos from our backyard tree.

Very good! Family loved it. I added three more eggs to the recipe as others  suggested. I precooked the 1 lb. of shredded potatoes in a skillet with oil and butter and then put the potatoes in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then layered the egg mixture, cheese and sausage.  My family likes spicy foods so they added salsa on the side.

I just have to say..this was the bomb! My family loved it! Even my daughter was able to have some and she's not fond of eggs!!! I used ham instead of sausage and didn't saute' the onions. This is going to be our traditional Christmas breakfast from now on. My hubby said I could actually make it for a dinner sometime! Thank you for sharing!

This was really good. I didn't have any onion powder so I added a few more onions to the egg mix. I will definitely take some suggestions and precook the hashbrowns and use a larger pan. Definitely use the aluminum foil or the sausage and cheese will overcook. I will also add peppers and perhaps some salsa.

Made this casserole as written except for using pork chorizo for the sausage & adding frozen mixed sweet peppers. Delicious, especially with a splash of pepper sauce!! This was for the office Christmas potluck. I wanted to bring something to start our day with, it was well received. Will definitely be making this again for home & potlucks. Love that this recipe lends itself to a lot of creativity.  Thanks Melissa!

This is my go-to dish for tailgating. My only adjustments are adding fresh garlic and some fresh jalapeños to give it a kick. I assemble it the night before and pop it in the oven in the morning as I gather my things for the game. It's still nice and hot when I take it out the parking lot. Yum!

We had this for Sunday breakfast and my kids and I liked it.  We liked it enough to make it more.  However, after reading the reviews and finding consistent comments about the amount of potatoes and eggs, I modified the recipe a bit.  I only used 1 pound of potatoes (which I browned, salted, and peppered first)and I doubled the eggs and milk.  It came out great.

I'm giving this 4 stars due to the ratio being quite off. There needs to be more eggs to potato ratio. This is an easy fix. I've also read the reviews and heeded the advice of another and poured 1/2 cup melted butter over the frozen hash browns in the baking dish, cooked uncovered for 30 minutes. Then I add the other ingredients but I use 7 eggs and 3/4 c milk. I also mix season all salt into the potatoes, the egg mixture, and when I only have ground beef I use that too. This recipe can be played with in every which way. Change up the cheese to a Mexican blend, change the spices here and there, add or remove the inion. It's all very yummy!!

I added one more egg and 1/4 more milk. It was a little dry the first time. I also add green peppers. My husband loves this and we now make it often.

Really good!!  But instead of frozen hashbrowns I used fresh potatoes to make my own hashbrowns. Sauteed fresh mushrooms and red bell pepper with the sausage.  I also used fresh sausage and skipped the salt.  Next time I make it I am going to try it with bacon.

I made this dish on Christmas morning 2013 with the expectation it would be quick and simple, I was very wrong.I will never use the frozen hash browns again without par cooking it.I will try this again maybe with diced potatoes or some other form of potato. The overall taste was good but the potatoes took FOREVER to crisp up.I also added bacon on the top. Thanks!

I made this for a morning event, it was gone in no time! I think the next time I cook this I may brown the hash browns a bit more before adding the eggs for a bit more crunch.

As others mention, this recipe is too big to fit in a 2 qt casserole. Use larger baking dish or cut down recipe. Good breakfast for seeral.

The whole family loved it... To save dishes I made in a cast iron skillet!  I also skipped the onion and garlic powder and sautéed fresh garlic with the onion and sausage.  Next time I will use 1/2 the potatoes and double the sausage.

Most people tweak recipes, and based on most of the "not so favorable" comments, here are my suggestions for a much more savory dish...Use REAL potatoes, certainly not frozen hash browns. Use both red potatoes with skin on, AND a combination of sweet potatoes in whatever ratio you prefer 80/20. Par boil them, then brown them real well.   2. Sharp cheddar as the cheese choice.

This is a really good basic recipe.  We made without sausage the first time (didn't have any).   We used it as a potato base for some sloppy joe meat that I made.  I will be making again with sausage.  Planning on adding chopped celery and carrots for flavor when cooking the sausage and onion.  Going to add creme fraiche instead of milk to the eggs for extra creaminess and some zing.    Will add some more spicing.

Changes a few things....made 1lb of bacon for the meat, 8 eggs, only half the hash browns. Seasoned the hash browns with salt & pepper and mixed with half the bacon crumbled. I then layered with half the cheese; mixed the rest of the bacon (crumbled) with egg and poured on top. Cooked at 350 for 45 min then removed foil and cook 20 min at 375

I will add something to the potatoes before baking next time. They needed a little something extra. Maybe I didn't drain the sausage as well as I should have, or maybe it was the shredded cheddar, or both - but I had to drain off A LOT of oil before serving.    I like the recipe for the simplicity however.

My son and I liked this recipe but both agreed that we would like a little more flavor.  I used Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar because I was out of cheddar.  Next time I may try adding some sauteed green peppers.

This recipe was terribly bland. At the very least, the hash browns needed salt, but after it was cooked, no amount of seasoning, salsa or jalapenos could make it good. I won't make this one again.

Great recipe. I used Southwest style hash browns for a little kick - perfect. I love bland food, so the hash browns were just enough to add favor without numbing my taste buds. Otherwise, made exactly shown here - so simple and easy. I cook/bake a lot and some think this is the best thing I've made. Definitely keeping this one!
