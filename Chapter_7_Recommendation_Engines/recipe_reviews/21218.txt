I made this recipe with fresh crab and it was absolutely phenomenal! Don't be intimidated by the word 'souffle' in the title -- this is the first souffle I have ever made and it turned out beautifully.

Loved it! I cut the recipe in half & I wasn't sure I had enough crab so I added a can of medium shrimp (rinsed). I also used lime juice instead of lemon. With the exception of the salt, I doubled the spices & increased the coconut a bit. Put it all in a 4 cup souffle & baked for 24 minutes. Hubby suggested that, next time, I bake it in individual dishes for a prettier presentation. I served it w/ baked pineapple slices w/ a brown sugar/butter glaze & a romaine salad w/ walnuts & raspberry vinaigrette. I had a bottle of sauvignon blanc open so that's what we had but because of the spiciness of the dish, I think a gewurztraminer would make a better pairing. Thansk Claire...this was very good!

I made this with imitation crabmeat, used curry sauce instead of powder.  No matter - it was absolutely AMAZING and I cannot recommend trying this recipe enough!  This was my first souffle, so I was a bit intimidated, but it raised perfectly and was stunning to see and taste.  The best recipe I've come across on this site, hands down.

The coconut brings out the sweetness of the crab meat, very tasty.  It was gone as soon as it hit the table.

From a skeptic point of view,I'd have to say that this recipe was phenomenal. It was a bit messy combining all the ingredients together, but at the end all was forgotten once I savoured the delicious meal.  So good that I didn't have to wash the dishes afterwards(LOL)

Absolutely divine!  I made this for DH for Valentine's day, along with a wonderful ribeye for a little surf and turf, and it was exceptional!  I may add some Old Bay next time, but it was good without it!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This was an amazing dish! I was very afraid at first because I was unsure of how it would turn out, but it ended up WAY above expectations! I did change a little bit by adding almost twice the amount of spices, so the flavor was great! My first souffle and I was very pleased with it

Good, but I expected more. With these expensive (crabmeat) and "exotic" (coconut) ingredients, and a fair share of spices, I supposed it would have quite a kick. Nevertheless, it tasted a little too bland for me. Interesting flavour, but seemed to lack something. Also, it was not very "filling". We ended up almost hungry, and a bit disappointed. The souffle part didn't rise very much, but this was because of a rookie mistake of mine - the recipe was not to blame.

I messed up the souffle part.  But no need to fear, I used it as a dip with tortilla chips...still yummy.

I omitted coconut flakes, celery tops, red pepper flakes, garlic and substituted dry basil for the oregano. I also sauteed chives with the butter...it turned out delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  Coconut was a very good counterbalance to the savory crab - and enhanced the sweetness of the souffle in a good way.

This is a fantastic concept!    I made some alterations to adhere to my special diet.  I used 1/3 cup of rice milk (I made the recipe for 2), and I used Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour, a dash of Xanthan Gum (Gluten substitute). I used fresh thyme instead of dried, and used much more curry and garlic.  I also added white pepper and garlic pepper.  I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used chili powder.  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter, and unsweetened coconut flakes instead of sweetened.   I topped the dish off with some fresh grated pecorino cheese (an Italian cheese made from ewe's milk).  It was fantastic!  Because I used a smaller dish, it only took about 10 minutes in the oven.    I will definitely try this dish again!   Thanks!

This was a quick and easy souffle. I ended up cooking mine about 40 minutes, but other than that made no changes.  Next time I make it I think I will increase the coconut and the spices to give it a more powerful flavor.

I am a caterer and I planned a function with a Caribbean theme. I served this with a spicy peanut sauce. Outstanding - the line never stopped for this item.

This was the first souffle I've attempted and I was quite pleased with the results. It wasn't nearly as difficult as I anticipated and my dinner guests thought it was delicious. :) I'd definitely make it again.

This would have been a great recipe if it weren't for the coconut-- to me it did not belong-- the souffle itself was exceptional - next time I would add scalliion with the celery and maybe a littleshredded gouda instead of the hard coconut. Thanks.

This was wonderful.  I used a little chive and scallion instead of celery.  I added 1/2 tsp. Of old bay.  Used ( I pre-cooked it) shrimp and surimi instead of $$crab.  Wound up with savory meets a lil sweet.  Oh,  and I used 1 tsp. Of cream of tartar with the lemon and the egg whites.  
If you never made a souffle... Must have an immersion blender.  If you think you're done,  give them a bit more.

This turned out better than I expected. For my first round I followed the recipe to the letter. I would be curious to hear from other folks that added cheese. Did that improve your experience? Everyone really enjoyed this recipe, and it was easy to make. Next time I might vary the ingredients a little bit to make it slightly spicier.

The recipe was easy to follow and this turned out good. My family still didn't like it however. I thought that the curry would be subtle since there is only a little bit, but it was all I could taste.
