Whatever this is, "Pasta con le Sarde" it ain't. Noodles with anchovies, perhaps, but the real Pasta con le Sarde is a dish with centuries of Sicilian heritage and deserves better.

I don't know whether this is authentic or not but what I do know is that we loved it!  For those who said the dish tasted fishy, make sure you buy a good brand of sardines like "Season." I found I didn't need nearly as much olive oil as called for and to brighten the flavor, I squeezed in the juice of a half of a lemon. So delish and thank you!!

Sorry - I could not eat this and I like sardines. This was way too fishy and wierd. Could not find any way to blend the flavors to my liking. Luckily, the ingredients were cheap, so it wasn't too big a loss.   My boyfriend said, "I think there's a reason why sardines are not used more widely..." I'm sticking to the sardine as low-mercury tuna subsititute for dips and spreads. High in omega 3's, but not an especially versatile ingredient.

If your not a true Sicilian you really can't appreciate this recipe.This is my favorite Italian dish. In my opinion my Mother made the best Pasta Con Sardine! And I'm sure your Mother made the best as well, the point is, its our Mother's recipe that throuh out the years carry the recipe from generation to generation>

Wow- I can't believe I just turned a plain old can of sardines into this blissful fishy extravaganza. I did eliminate the extra oil however and just sauteed the garlic in some oil from the can before adding the sardines. It's still plenty oily and flavorful and will save on a monster amount of fat and calories. Thank you for this!

wow i just made this tonight because i needed something quick, easy, and healthy. i have been trying to include more sardines in my diet since they're a good source of omega 3's and vitamin D - two things that Americans are normally very deficient in. i used homemade italian seasoned bread crumbs (that were very heavily seasoned) and didn't drain the sardines. delicious!!!!!

Just excellent.  Light and healthy -- we just tossed the pasta into the sauce, giving it a quick turn - so the extra oil wasn't needed.  Added the parsley and parmesean as a sprinkle on top.  Recommended!

I made this with a couple of changes...I used 1/2 cup of Parmesan and 1/2 cup of seasoned bread crumbs. I used sardines packed in tomato & wheat pasta shells (because that was what I had in my pantry).  It came out great!!! Yes, it is sauce less, but still it is a yummy & inexpensive dish. TY for the recipe.

This was the very first time we ate sardines!  We loved it.  No fishy tast at all.  Maybe because I bought a name brand sardine in water.  We will be making this again!

Really good! I added a little bit of onion and held off on the pepper for my 4-year-old, but this is a really good dish. Be sure to use *seasoned* bread crumbs -- I almost switched to some panko I had in the cupboard but I can tell that would have been a mistake. A squeeze of lemon at the very end might not be bad either.

I thought it wise to add onions with the garlic and some wine and capers a few minutes before your supposed to add the sardines, just to give the dish a little more complexity. I don't know if it holds up as well without those additions but it turned out great for me. It's definitely crucial you use decent boneless sardines if you can't abide fishiness. 

We ended up eating all the pasta and had some sardine mix leftover. The next day, I mixed the leftovers with mayo to make the best sardine salad sandwich I've ever had in my life. I had to come on here and review the recipe just so everyone knew: cold sardine mixture + mayo = great sandwich filling.

Made my own seasoned panko breadcrumbs and added more sardines.  Need to use more oil as the sardines were water pack.  A big hit at my house!

Love how quick, simple, and delicious this is! I only use 1/4 c bread crumbs to make it a bit healthier.  All 4 kids eat this (2 year old LOVES it) and it's just such a simple way to get some DHA inexpensively.  Husband doesn't like the thought of sardines, but is happy to eat this with red pepper flakes and sriracha.  (We have used a variety of sardines and found it good whether they are in oil/water/hot sauce.)

Very simple and tasty! I like sardines, but their flavor is a little too strong. This recipe toned them down perfectly. I put quite a bit more fresh parsley in just trying to use it up out of my fridge and it was wonderful. The only criticism I have is that the pasta is a little dry and could do with some cream sauce. Overall, I loved the simplicity and taste!

Absolutely amazing. Used garlic in jar, added one tsp of capers, I just smashed up some crackers I had on hand, and I only used 1/2 cup olive oil total, but only lightly drained fish. Try it, I dare you!

Many years ago I was in Sicily and was served this dish. I didn't know what it was but I loved it. Now I have found it in Allrecipes! They added chopped fennel leaves and pine nuts is what I remember. Anyway, I am so glad I now can make it! I reduced the bread crumbs by half, as well as the olive oil by even more. I also used brown rice fettucini which I much prefer over whole wheat pasta. I used Chicken of the Sea sardines. So delicious!

I’ve made this a few times. I think the problem where people say it needs more sauce -well when you drain your pasta save that water and add a few ladles to your pan.

No oil outside of sardines in oil, added can of stewed tomatoes & omitted breadcrumbs. Salt & pepper to taste, squirt of lemon. Didn’t measure garlic or parsley but used a lot. Also added 1/4 shallot b/c had it in fridge. Easy, fast & tasty.

My child and I loved it!  I used Barilla gluten free penne and a soy based Parmesan cheese (a little only at the end). I also used dried parsley and added a little oregano at the end. It tasted really good and to say my 4 year old ate it says a lot. 
I also used Crown Prince Boneless & Skinless Sardines so it wasn't too fishy for us.

I guess I just don,t like canned sardines. Added a diced roma tomato and 2 tbsp of tomato powder. Added a sauce of 1 c. skim milk and 8 oz neufchatel cheese and made it palitable. Still, the flavor of canned sardines is fishy and no recipe I have ever found negates that.

This dish was delicious! I sometimes purchase Portuguese sardines and put it on bread and eat it just like that, but only because I don't know what else to do with the sardines. So, I was excited when I saw this recipe. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so used the dried stuff. I also didn't have seasoned crumbs on hand, so used seasoned croutons instead. I thought the croutons would break down into crumbs during the cooking process, but they didn't. Next time, I will put the croutons in a blender before using. Even with my changes, it tasted great!! Will definitely make again.

I had already chopped onion and garlic for a pasta sauce when I saw the can of sardines in my cupboard.  I always buy Planet Earth sardines and (non-albacore) tuna.  I have to be in the mood to eat sardines, though.  I looked up the recipe "pasta and sardines" and found this one.  Had Panko breadcrumbs on hand, but no parmesan cheese.  So that was my change to the recipe.  I thought it was very good, and made the sardines actually taste less sardiney.  Four stars instead of five because, after all, they are sardines.

I probably screwed this up but i thought I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was not a sauce at all. it was basically sardine flavored breadcrumbs over pasta. Tasted okay, but it was just really weird. Is that how its supposed to be? Seems to me WAY to much breadcrumbs and parmesan that soaks up all the olive oil
