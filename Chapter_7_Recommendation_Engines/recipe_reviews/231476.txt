This worked out just as I hoped.  I had frozen silken tofu on hand and used that.  It worked perfectly for me.  My husband was craving lasagna and since I have sensitivities to dairy, we just don't eat it anymore.  I used this substitute for ricotta and though he "hates" tofu, he didn't taste any difference and we both were so happy to enjoy our lasagna!

This worked really well! I used 2-3 T of extra virgin olive oil and my tofu package was 14 oz., but about 10-15 pulses and it looked like ricotta. Smells great, too.

I thought this "Vegan Ricotta" tasted great and wouldn't hesitate to make it again (5 stars); however, my husband refused to eat it stating it was "flavorless" (1 star). Thank you chyena for sharing your recipe.

Are use this in place of ricotta to make vegan lasagna. It was so delicious! Even some of my meat eaters liked my vegan lasagna better!

Very good! I made this as an ingredient to make a dairy free lasagne and it turned out great.
