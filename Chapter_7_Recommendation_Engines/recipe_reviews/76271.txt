Fantastic!!!! I couldn't find the reduced-fat chocolate wafers anywhere, so I used a full pack of the chocolate graham crackers instead. Tasted great! It really doesn't taste like anything was reduced fat or lower sugar. I also used decaf instant coffee, and it tasted great.

Great cheesecake-awsome flavor.  I used 3 whole eggs and regular gram cracker crumbs for the base.  Beautiful design and flavor.

I didn't really care for this too much. The instant coffee and hot chocolate mix made it taste too artificial. That said, the texture was decent, and it was a pretty easy recipe. Next time, I might just try it plain and serve it with fruit.
