This was excellent. The chicken turned out tender and moist. The lemon pepper flavor was lacking (compared to the lemon pepper chicken I get at my local grocery store) but who knows what kind of fake chemicals they are using, so I prefer to make my own. I put bell peppers, onion, peppers and carrots in the cooker underneath the chicken to make a complete meal.

This was the most amazing chicken I have ever made...I did change a few ing. I substituted basil for the thyme and a half an orange for the lemon and it was out of this world!!!

I doubled the lemon pepper for stronger flavour, added 1/2 cup water and used boneless skinless chicken breasts. Served with rice and asparagus. The family loved it. Simple and delicious.

I have made this in a slow cooker so many times.  Try adding rosemary with the lemon slices and salt and pepper and a little garlic.  Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!I never add any liquid to my chicken and it comes out so moist every time.  Good recipe.  Everyone I have told to fix it this way was never disappointed.

This is a good start to something delicious.  Use a good half of large lemon, sprig of fresh rosemary and a sprig of fresh sage along with other ingredients.  I brown my chicken first before putting into crock pot.  Looks much more tempting and gives more flavor!

This was outstanding. I used a 4 to 5 pound chicken so I added 4 tbs more of butter and about half tbs more of lemon pepper. I also seasoned it with basil and some slap ya mama cajun seasoning instead of seasoned salt.  I used about half a large lemon. I squeezed a little on the chicken and cut the rest and put inside the cavity. I did add 2 garlic cloves (smashed) under the skin of the chicken. I also added a sprig of fresh Rosemary.  Cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 2 hours.

I used a little more of everything as recommended by some of the reviewers. I cooked it on low. I was asked to make THIS for Easter dinner instead of a ham or turkey. It was a HUGE hit with family members.

This was good, better for us had I not overcooked it which happened because I used two Cornish hens, not a whole chicken.  I cooked on high for an hour then on low for 4 hours or so.  I also added 1/4 cup white wine to the hens at the beginning.  I will try this again, but with a chicken!

Easy and moist.  Will probably add more lemon next time because I didn't have a strong enough lemon taste but that could just be a preference thing.

I cooked this one on the BBQ like a roast and it came out absolutely delicious! We added some lemon rind into the paste that goes under the skin which resulted in a more intense lemon flavour.

I used 2 large split chicken breasts but otherwise kept everything the same. I just placed a few lemon slices around the chicken, also needed less olive oil. It was perfect on high for 4 hours, as I got a late start. It turned out moist, very good mild flavor but not bland.

This is good! I know the amount of salt seems like a lot, but it's necessary. Also, I always double the other seasonings, as the chicken can be a little bland otherwise. It comes out very moist, though.

I confess I prefer a roasted chicken, but having said that, I love the ease in preparing this delicious whole chicken.  We thought it was very good.

I followed the recipe but put potatoes in the crock as well.  It was just not good.  The breast meat was dry, the potatoes I put at the bottom of the pot were nasty tasting, and the chicken itself had no flavor other than chicken.  My kids hated it, and even I couldn't finish it.  Very unappealing appearance, too.

Very good; I ran my chicken under the broiler a bit to brown the skin, just for appearance sake on the platter....excellent flavor.

The chicken was very bland and tasted a lot like boiled chicken with some lemon pepper.  I guess I just prefer a rotisserie or baked style so that there is a little crispness to it and then moist chicken.  At any rate, it was very easy to prepare and I was able to use the leftovers (which I had a lot of) in 2 other yummy dishes.  So, all in all, I would make it again just as a way to cook my chicken for other meals that require shredded  chicken or small bits of chicken like soup - just not as a main meal.

Pretty good, however I think 5hrs is too long. The chicken temp was over 200 when I checked it at 5 hrs. So it was a bit dry.  Will make again, but check temp much earlier.

Tasty and simple.  We found whole chickens for .99 per pound which also made this more economical than the rotisserie chicken from the grocery.  The meat was falling off the bone.  I used the leftovers to make a soup.

Awesome Recipe.  I added chicken broth about 1/4 cup and vegetables. Added couple garlic and  more Thyme. You can prevent the dryness or lack of taste: after it is cooked just use the sauce or juice of chicken and pour with a large spoon onto the chicken.  It even taste better the next day especially when it soaked into the juices of the chicken!!! We ate with rice. Taste really great!!!

Great recipe!  It's perfect without having to make any changes to the original recipe.  It is super moist and had a very unique, distinct flavor that is strong enough for you to taste it and be delicious without overpowering you taste-wise.  Plus, it falls off the bones when it's done cooking - so you know it's good!  ;)   All-in-all, wonderful, excellent recipe!!!

Since others said it wasn't Lemony enough I used 2 large lemons plus sprinkled lemon pepper on the outside and the flavor of the chicken was the bomb!!!  The problem was I cooked the chicken for 3 hrs on high (actually less than directions and many reviewers) and the meat was mushy / falling off the bones  and impossible to separate FROM the bones.  I ended up with chicken mush & bones.  I would love to make this again b/c of the flavor.......any suggestion

I've made this before, except I add about 1/2 cup of lemon juice, lay lemons over the chicken.  I also added rosemary and did not use the butter.  It was super moist and very yummy!

Very nice, but browned it first and put a whole lemon inside the chicken, skin and everything which I punctured with a fork first.

I  have made a few different recipes, this one I always come back to.  It is really good and I made it for dinner when my daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter were here.  They enjoyed it a lot too.

I prefer to use poultry seasoning along w/the lemon pepper, it gives it the extra flavour you might be missing!

Three hours on high!? Then another 2 - 3 hours on low.  Is this not too long!?  Especially 3 hours on high!   What do you qualify as high and low temperatures?

A few changes, I used herbs de provence rather than thyme. Also, the cooking time seems off. After 3 hours on high, I checked and the chicken was well done. Any longer and it would have been over done.  Also, 2 tablespoons of oil is way too much, you only need about a teaspoon. Other than that, it was very good, probably the most tender and tasty chicken I have ever made.

Easy and tasty. I would use more seasoning next time. Also, this created a LOT of liquid. While my slow cooker will kick over to warm after it's done, it might be better to get the chicken out sooner rather than later or get some of the liquid out so that it can brown up a bit more.

I have made this recipe several times now, exactly as written, and it never disappoints!! The chicken has just enough flavor, is incredibly tender, and juicy. The ease of preparation combined with the end result makes this a top 10 recipe for me!

Added 1/2 lemon in cavity. Sat on top of crumpled foil to keep out of grease in crock pot.  Pretty good, fairly moist. Flavorful on the outside

Got 5 thumbs up and my hubby never says great dinner!! It made awesome gravy too after , I just added some flour and water to thicken. I had a 6lb chicken so doubled the recipe. Used a 1/2 lemon inside and squeezed the rest on top. It was sooo moist!!  I cooked mine 6 hours on low.  I also put carrots and onion underneath while it cooked and stuck it under the broiler to crunch it up a bit before serving.Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make it again!

I'm one of those people who rarely uses her slow cooker, but I really was in the mood for a simple and easy meal.  When I saw this recipe I thought it was exactly what I was looking for and I was so right!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just delicious!  So tender and very flavorful! Definitely a keeper!

i followed recipe exactly,  but  I also stuffed chicken with lemon, garlic, and celery.  Laid it on a thick bed of onions (future gravy) and layered it with a few stems of lemon thyme, sage.  I pre-heated my oven while taking chicken out of slowcooker, and let it cool. Then i popped it in the oven to crisp up. I added a bit more work, but, it had to be done!

Really good and easy to make!! I didn’t have a lemon so I squirted lemon juice into the cavity. I also didn’t have any cloves of garlic so I sprinkled garlic powder into the cavity. It worked perfectly!! My chicken was 6 lbs so I had it on high for 6 hours then turned it down to low for another 3. An hour before serving I sliced potatoes and put layered them in the juice around the chicken. OMG!! Soooooo good!!!

I followed the suggestion to double the lemon pepper seasoning and I used half of a lemon.  It looks wonderful and smells amazing!  I’m trying it out for a family dinner, so the taste testers aren’t here yet.  I’m sure it will be a new favorite!

Very good! I kept saying 'yum' with every bite I took. This chicken melts in your mouth, very tender! I used the exact ingredients except I used minced garlic from a jar I keep in fridge instead of fresh garlic. I had a 5lb whole chicken and started it at 12:30pm and was wondering if it would be ready in time for dinner and it was! It reached the proper temp by 4 hours on high..I turned down to low since we weren't ready to eat yet. No need to add any liquids, when it was finished, there were several cups of liquid around the chicken. The chicken will completely fall apart from the bone so getting it out of crockpot took a little effort but the taste was worth it! This recipe would be great to make a chicken salad (ckn mixed with mayo) for sandwiches or atop salads since the meat was easily separated already from the bones. The only change I would make is possibly adding more lemon slices and lemon pepper seasoning since I prefer a lot of that flavor. Will definitely make again!!

Only had skin on chicken thighs. Great concept but not crazy about flavour. Made sauce out of drippings thickened with cornstarch. Nice addition. Will try again with different seasoning...perhaps fresh garlic and ? tarragon ? perhaps. Easy. Sauce, last minute decision,  took longest! Would try again.

Chicken was moist but no flavor.  I had 3 lemons plus lemon pepper seasoning and extra cracked pepper and it still tasted like just chicken.  I plan on making it  again tomorrow with extra lemon pepper seasoning per some of the suggestions.

This recipe reminds me of the lemon chicken I use to get at a Greek restaurant in  All.  on the on theulde of the city.  It was known observe Bob Hope   when he can to town to play golf with a very popular blind golf player.  My mind does not let me remeberhis name but older people in Birmingham will know who I am writing about.  The owner raid hat Mr. Hope this life monchicken and log r it.  marob hat is why I am giving it five stars.  marob t comes very close to their recipe.  It just in Birminghamds a love ttle more  lemon.  But that s a great recipe.

My chicken was closer to 6 pounds so I doubled all the spices. I skipped the salt since lemon pepper has a ton and used a garlic herb mix. I used margarine instead of butter.  And I used a clementine instead of a lemon because I didn't have one. I cooked my larger bird the same, 3 hours on high and 3 on low. First, It was way over cooked. The breast was so dry and chewy I couldn't eat it, even with bbq sauce. The dark meat was mushy. Second, it lacked flavor. I am giving this recipie three stars simply because I like the method of a crock pot. If I ever do it again I will definitely cook it on low for less time and add more flavor.

We liked this, but it was not quite lemony or peppery enough and I even doubled the seasonings.  I added carrots, onion and potatoes to the pot and halfway thru I added some chicken broth.  I think I will add lemon juice next time and more pepper.  But, it was a healthy and hearty meal.

Definitely use a lot of butter and lemon pepper to have a flavorful chicken. If you have leftovers, make some chicken alfredo futtuccini.

I loved this. The chicken was a bit dry in some places, but overall very tender and flavorful. There was a lot of juice/gravy left over as well. I added basil and rosemary to the chicken and chopped up two bell peppers and a few small potatoes and added them to the bottom. Everyone really liked this recipe and I definitely will be making it again!

Easy to make and very tasty. I did add a few ounces of chardonnay to make it a bit juicier.

Absolutely lovely flavor. The 3rd time I made it I forgot to turn temperature to low after one hour and it turned out perfect

This recipe was delicious and easy. It was not lemony enough even though I had added extra lemon and lemon pepper. Next time I'll add allot more for flavour.

Incredibly moist and flavorful.  I didn't have lemon pepper on hand so used groud pepper and I put a little more lemon and garlic in the cavity.  Other than that, exactly as the recipe calls.  Delicious!  New favorite!

followed recipe basically as is. added a couple slices or orange and had fresh rosemary that needed using. I used a 7.5 lb bird with a temp popper. I put it on high for one hour. then set the slow cooker to 8 hours on low. I came back with 2 hours left and the bird was done.  it wasn't supper time so I put the legs and chicken beat (it came apart when I tried to fish it out with tongs) on a platter, put foil over and popped it in the oven at 170.  delicious! it did have an odd smell after 7 hours but tasted divine. my first whole chicken in a slow cooker. give it a try!  also, use a larger crock pot...mine was half full of liquid...

I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with mush.
It would have worked the same to boil the chicken for 2 days.

I used a whole lemon sliced up instead of just a slice and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I also used fresh ground peppercorns and not lemon pepper seasoning(to reduce the amount of salt). I will probably make it again everyone liked it.

This was a very good and easy chicken recipe. I used a whole lemon and did not melt the butter, but rather just put pads of butter under the skin. I will season it more thoroughly next time, as it was a little bland.

Loved this recipe. ...you can also omit the lemonpepper and season salt . Instead use fajita seasoning and omit the lemon piece. We even made chicken fajita quesadillas the next day.....delicious.

I made this for a family dinner and my family is comprised of a lot of picky eaters. I can't tell you how delicious it is because by the time I filled my plate it was all gone. My family, however, said I can make this dish anytime I want so I will provide an update after I finally taste it. :)
