I DECREASED FLOUR BY ONE CUP, CND ADDED 1/2 TSP OF ALMOND EXTRACT.  INSTEAD OF USING BAKING POWDER, I USED 1 TSP. OF BAKING SODA.  THEY WERE MOIST AND CHEWY THIS WAY.  MY FAMILY GOBBLED THEM UP.  THIS WAS A NICE VARIATION OF A BASIC CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.

These are great cookies!  They aren't the prettiest since they do have a green coloring, but they sure are tasty!!  This is a great recipe if you don't want an ordinary chocolate chip cookie.

These are such a nice addition to my Christmas Goodies list.  They look so different from all the traditional stuff I make.  I've made them half a dozen times. They are more cakelike than cookie. I think you could easily reduce the flour by 1/2 cup, or, add more milk to the batch.  I also doubled the pistachio pudding amount and they were much more green. I like that better than adding coloring, although that would work also.  I always add nuts so there's more texture to them.

A great find! This was a nice twist to the usual choc chip cookies.  Reading the other reviews I decided to make half the batch with white chips and 1/2 with the usual choc chips. I didn't find them dry at all.  For a more festive Christmas color I added a bit of greed food coloring. Definitely a keeper!

Very good and unique cookies! I substitued choc. chips with white chocolate chips which looked good with the green-tinted dough.  These would be good for a St. Patrick's Day or Christmas party.

The flavor was good, but I should have trusted my instincts when measuring out the flour and baking powder thinking it was an awful lot. These came out the consistency of cake/muffins rather than a chewy or crunchy cookie, and were just so dry that you needed milk with them. I may try again but changing the leavening/dry ingredients for a better texture for me. Otherwise, the pistachio pudding was a great flavor twist.

The proportions of most of the ingredients are off.  Not enough pudding mix (with respect to the rest of the ingredients), leaving the cookies barely coloured.  Too much flour, nuts and chocolate chips.

I reduced the flour as others suggested and I could see why the dough would barely mix.  Even doing this these cookies turned out terrible.  I will not be making these again!

These cookies are my fiance's favorite. He will not share with anyone. When I make these I reduce the flour to 2 1/2 cups & substitute french vanilla coffee mate for the milk. The added vanilla gives the cookies a richer flavor.

These seemed pretty tasteless.  I made several different batches of cookies for a high school group and these were the last to go.  They didn't have an appetizing look either.  Slight green tint.  might have been better to add green food color so they would look like they are supposed to be green....but it wouldn't help the taste.

I love this recipe! The only problem I had was that it spread a little too much for me. That could have been the altitude. Who knows? Either way they tasted wonderful.

Great cookies! A nice change from the usual. FYI - these cookies will look light when done, so don't keep baking them until they darken.  I drizzled melted chocolate over them and a touch of powdered sugar.  Definitely a keeper!!

I love this recipe, I've used it before. I just add a little extra milk (I use vanilla almond milk) a little extra vanilla, 2 packages of pistachio instead of one, pistachios instead of walnuts, and dark chocolate chips. Cook for 11 min, absolutely perfect!

My favourite cookie recipe.  I use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, and chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  I also change the pudding mix to chocolate and use 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1 cup skor bits.

These cookies were awesome!  I made a couple of changes.  I substituted in 3/4 cup white whole wheat  and 1/4 cup pistachio nut meal for a cup of the regular flour.  I also used dark chocolate chips and cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and they were still plenty sweet, and a little bit healthier.  Will certainly make again.

This recipe is phenomenal. Everyone who's tried it loves it. I made half with white chocolate, and half with semisweet chocolate. The white chocolate complements the pistachio flavor much better in my opinion. Next time I'll be making it with white chocolate chips only.

This recipe is almost the exact same as the Chocolate Chip Pistachio Cookies on here, although there is a variation with white chocolate chips and a topping for the other recipe.  Other than that, pretty much the same.  I tried that recipe recently using white chocolate chips and eliminating the topping and thought it was dry, so in trying this recipe, I added more milk than called for (1/4 cup) and I feel it turned out well.  They don't spread much and it's certainly a different contrast with chocolate chips v. white chocolate chips in the cookies.  I think I like the white chocolate chips better, but that's an easy fix to any recipe.  I flattened the cookies with my fingers because I didn't want little round balls, and that worked well.  I must not've mixed the pudding mix in all that well, because some of the cookies were streaked green, but I thought it was kind of fun that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this cookies! I also reduced the amount of flour (it was just too much) to 2 1/2 cups. I also used white chocolate chips rather than chocolate (personal preference). They came out great! I put them on my tray of holiday cookies and they were a huge hit! I will make these often!

Excellant! I varied the recipe by using vanallia pudding instead and added a cup of fresh ground pistacios.....
