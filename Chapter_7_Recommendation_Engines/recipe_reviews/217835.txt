This is one of my favorite Christmas treats to make for cookie trays or parties. I got the recipe for this years ago from a friend of a friend and have been making it ever since. This can be varied so many different way using whichever grahams are your favorite and rolling it in other toppings (chopped nuts, sprinkles, chopped candy canes) and it's always the first to get eaten. I like it best with chocolate or cinnamon grahams.

Fantastic for a quick, chocolatey snack. Not gourmet, but TASTY. I figured out the ratio so that it could be adapted into all sizes (which is 4:1:3:3 of cookie crumbs, butter, chocolate, and topping respectively, by the way) because I wasn't quite sure that it would turn out nicely and wanted to downsize it, but now I see that it would have been fine to keep it in its original, larger form! All gone, within one afternoon. I froze them for a little while after making, as they were quite gooey, and then they turned out heavenly. We used all sorts of things as topping, not just coconut - ground haselnuts, chopped pecans, sprinkles, chopped butterscotch chips... be creative. Lovely recipe.

Added extra chocolate for more flavor but still wouldn't hold the coconut.  Ended up mixing it all together.

My 7 year old daughter & I just tried to make this for a holiday party.  We used the exact amounts the recipe called for but it was too dry to form balls.  So, we added more butter & chocolate to try to moisten it up, but still could not get balls to hold.  The coconut would not  stick to what balls I could form.  They not only looked bad but tasted bad. It all ended up in the trash & we made a different dessert.  Do not waste your time or ingredients on this.
