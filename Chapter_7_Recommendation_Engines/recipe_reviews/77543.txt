Great pork chops! Only i have one suggestion... reason i only gave 4 instead of 5 stars. I would put the seasonings into the cracker crumbs instead of the egg so the flavor sticks better. Also add italian seasoning and a pinch of salt and pepper. Yummm!!!

This recipe is pretty impressive.  I used really thick pork chops which always seem to be tough and dry no matter how you cook them, but they were awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

Oh yum! These were the perfect amount of crunch and moist. I only baked them for about 15 minutes as advised by one of the reviews (my chops are cut really thin). Serve with some scalloped potatoes...this recipe is so easy & so good!

This is a super dish and I have been making it for years.  I let the chops soak in the egg (added the seasonings to egg; suggest oregano and garlic salt) for about 15-30 minutes then bread in crushed saltines.  Other readers have suggested Ritz but I feel it hides the taste.  After breading let the chops rest on wax paper so the breading hardens.  This keeps the breading on the chops during frying. 

I know that rating this recipe then saying I changed it really doesn't count but the concept is a keeper and I just wanted to add another thought to the same concept. This has always been a winner in my family.

I've been making pork chops like this for years BUT . . . (just a few tips): put your spices in with the crumbs, instead of in the egg (more spice gets on the chops!)  I use Ritz crackers, but that's just personal preference -- I like Ritz's buttery taste!  And, NO NEED TO FRY the chops before baking!!  (No more grease splatters/no wasted time/not another dirty dish!)  Just dip/batter & place chops in a rectangular glass baking dish (sprayed with Pam) ~ AND top with thin pats of butter!! (Don't scrimp on the butter -- use 1/2 a stick for both sides of 6 chops!)  Bake at 400 for 15 minutes.  Flip chops over & top with more pats of butter.  Bake 10 minutes longer & Voila!  Crispy-coated, moist delicious!   Couldn't be easier!  Delish!

I "clean the frying pan" with 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 cup white wine: bring it to a boil, let it cook down for 2 minutes; then add it to the chops. Very good recipe: my Mom used to make it too!

Perfect!!  I used club crackers and would suggest thick pork chops for about 35 minutes.

Very very good tender pork chops.  Used ritz crackers.  Didn't have onion salt, so used flaked onion.  The seasonings were perfect.  Lined shallow pan with aluminimun foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  Used a convection oven at 350 for 40 minutes.  Didn't even need to use a knife; they were so tender.  Will definitely make again.

I stink at making pork chops, as I can never get the breading to stick. However, I did with this recipe, and the pork chops look and taste wonderful! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I tried this a couple months ago when I didnt have regular breadcrumbs - I didnt like the saltines at all. They get soggy real fast and don't turn out well. I like to season the chops first with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then flour lightly, dip in beaten egg, then in seasoned (or not)breadcrumbs. Fry in hot oil till browned on one side, flip and do the same. If chops are real thick, transfer to cookie sheet and finish in oven for 20-30 minutes. Oh and this works equally well on chicken. I do it all the time.

Fantastic!  I had very thin boneless chops, so I put them in the oven just long enough to cook some vegetables, maybe 12 minutes total.  Big hit with the family!

These have a pretty good flavor, and were crisp and juicy. I put the spices in the cracker mix, for a better coating and added pepper and thyme for more taste. If you find the recipe a bit greasy (oil does come out during the baking process), I suggest draining the chops on paper towels before serving.

If there was a choice for more stars I would have rated it higher. I read all the reveiws and combined much of the advise. I have cooked them 2 different ways and i found it is best to use the ritz crackers. i put all of my seasoning in the cracker mix. i also added seasoning salt and steak seasoning. after i fried them i did drain them on a plate with paper towels. my chops were almost an inch thick and i baked them at 375 for 28 min. I did put a little strip of butter on them before i baked them. These have quickly become our favorite new meal. they are really tender and juicy and have great flavor. I would recommend these to anyone that likes fried food. you also need to use more oil than the recipe says.

I make a similar recipe, using crushed cornflakes instead of crackers, baking @ 375 only instead of frying first. I sprinkle seasonings over chops after they've been coated w/ the flakes. Simply delicious, and a family favorite!

I have been doing this for years, but I don't fry them first. I just bread them and put them in the oven at 350 for 55 minutes (60 is just a little bit too long.   Five minutes does make a difference.

I never seem to get pork chops right but these turned out really well!  They were tender and had great flavor.  This recipe is going into my "favorite" collection of recipes!  I will definitely make these again.

This is great!  I've been using the crackers on cube steak to make chicken fried steak for years. Crackers are much more crunchy & keep the meat more moist, than flour. Also, if you season the meat first, then into the egg, then pat the crackers crumbs into the meat, the seasoning and the crackers stay on better.  YUM!!

This is an excellent recipe. I have been making this for years. But other than vegetable oil. Try frying them in bacon grease......so much more flavor! MMMM......

I've been doing this recipe for years, but I do have a suggestion especially for the person that gave it 4 stars.  Dip the chop in flour, then the egg, then the crumbs.  This works for almost all breading recipes.

I've tried countless recipes for tender and tasty pork chops but none of them ever turned out the way I'd hoped...until I made them like this. By looking over the recipe you wouldn't think they'd be anything special, but they are!! Crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. I made a few adjustments, because I didn't have crackers on hand, so I used (my own seasoned) panko breadcrumbs instead. Per another reviewer, I also soaked the chops in the egg mixture for about 10 minutes before I coated them with panko. The key is not over cooking these. 30 minutes in the oven and they were perfect! No pink...just moist and flavorful chops. Be sure to add salt and pepper to the the egg and crumb mixture. And it's okay to be liberal with the seasonings, ie, season salt, italian seasoning, etc.... My husband RAVED all night after eating these chops and said, "we're not making em' any other way from now on!!" And I concur...they're out of this world!! Fast, easy and delicious!

Want the breading to stay on ? Toss or press the chops in flour, shake off excess, then put in egg wash, then into the crackers. Once coated, refrigerate for about 30 mins before frying.

You who are shortening the time to as little as 12 min., know that you need to use a thermometer to test the pork to well done temp (165F).  If you don't, you may well set up your family for a parasite that can eat into your brain or eye or both.  Not good!  Btw-this recipe rocks AREJAY!  Thanks!  The chops come out juicy and tender.

Always read reviews.  Fixed this recipe using panko bread crumbs and egg substitute.  Added Italian bread crumbs, salt, and pepper as advised by other reviews.  Also had bought thicker chops on sale, but the time was still almost on target.  A thin chop would have been way overcooked, as noted by others.  These were tender and juicy.  Good recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe...I cook pork chop just fine but I really enjoyed this. Made them so tender to bake after. I used Hi Ho crackers and add seasonings to crackers because the seasoning doesn't stick with the egg wash. Also press crackers down into meat good so it sticks to meat well.

I've been making these for years just as this recipe states and everyone loves them. You do have to adjust your cooking time depending on how thick the chops are, but we tend to like them thin and a bake time of 30 minutes is usually about right. I always have to make extra because they are even better cold the next day! They do take a little time, but are well worth the effort!

Second time around I didn't bake these. My chops were thin enough that I could just fry them for a few minutes on each side and that didn't dry them out too much. These were really nice. I had to add extra seasoning to the breading and egg mixtures. Nice with gravy on top!

Excellent recipe! I ran out of onion powder so I substituted some onion soup mix instead. I did mix the seasonings with my eggs like the recipe says and I could taste them in the end. Definitely a keeper. So moist and the saltine crackers just have this nice touch for the breading! I did follow another reviewers advice and drained on a paper towel covered plate before serving, took a lot of the oil out of them. Also only cooked for about 15 minutes as my chops were very thin, but an excellent recipe none the less!

I made these pork chops tonight for dinner and they were fabulous!  I used five boneless center cut pork chops that were about an inch thick and followed the recipe exactly.  I used a rolling pin to crush the saltines finely and I added a little salt, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper to the crushed saltines.  I also added the garlic powder and onion powder to the beaten eggs as well.  I ended up having to use a little more than 3 tbsp of oil when browning them and I only baked them in the oven for 20 minutes.  They were perfectly juicy, moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  This will be my fried pork chop recipe from now on.  I had them with the balsamic glazed carrots (also from this site), lima beans and fettucinne pasta.

These came out so tender yet crunchy. I used crushed butter crackers mixed with a little leftover pork Shake N' Bake I had as the breading because it's all I had on hand, and I prefer butter crackers anyway. I seasoned the butter cracker crumbs with garlic powder, chili powder, parsley, italian seasoning, salt and pepper. I soaked the pork chops in soy sauce overnight, dipped in the eggs (Next time I will only use 1 egg, I hardly used any at all) and pressed the butter cracker mixture into the egg coating. I refrigerated the battered chops for a couple of hours. I put thin pats of butter on top of the patties and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. I flipped the patties, put thin pats of butter on the other side, and baked at 400 for another 10 to 12 minutes. Served with golden mushroom gravy (1 can golden mushroom soup, 1 can water, 1 can milk, bring to a boil until thickens), cheesy twice-baked mashed potatoes, carrots, and homemade rosemary garlic butter toasted bread. Delicious! My husband loved it and licked his plate clean. I will definitely make this again and again.

This turned out okay for me.  Not delicious, but nothing bad, either.  The chops stuck to the pan after I flipped them over- I think not turning them would have been better.  They also seemed crispier before I turned them.  Overall, the flavor was rather bland and the finished product was a little too greasy for my tastes.  Family seemed to like it a little better than me. I don't think I will make this again.

Tasty chops!  Others had commented about seasoning not providing enough flavor, so I first coated my chops in flour with garlic salt, onion powder and white pepper, then dipped in egg and lastly crackers.  After pan frying, I baked for only about 15 minutes then checked with my meat thermometer and the chops were moist and cooked perfectly.  Hubby requested honey mustard to dip and that tasted pretty good with the chops.  Will make these again!

My mom always baked her pork chops in the oven and that seemed to make them very tender.  Other recipes I see only have you bake on the stove top until cooked through and I find the meat isn't tender.  Cracker crumbs are good to use, as well as bread crumbs.  Use whatever spices you have around that you like.

My Mom made breaded Pork Chops when I was a kid. I couldn't remember how she did this until I read the recipe.  I use home made Panko instead of cracker crumbs as the panko absorbs less oil.

My chops came out WAY overdone, so I think I have to adjust either my timing or my oven.  Overall good taste.  Will make again with a shorter cooking time.

Excellent. I also put the seasonings in with the bread crumbs.  Served with a packet of country gravy and some veggies, you'd swear you were at Cracker Barrel or something! My husband makes chops with the standard mushroom soup. I think that is so bland, this is our new way to do pork chops at our house!

I always brine pork chops for at least an hour - makes them tender and juicy.  Also, for a much easier version, use Oven Fry for Pork (in a box).  Great flavor and only takes 20 min. in the oven.  I turn them over after 10 min.

Perhaps I missed something but I used thick porkchops and went by the time and temp recommended and they were way over cooked. Flavor was ok. If I'd used thin chops they would have been rubber cooking them for the recommended time and temp. Either shorten the time or reduce the temp if you don't want unmoist and over cooked chops.

These were great for an easy weeknight meal.  I sliced through the chops horizontally for a really thin cut of meat, so I only baked for about 20 mins.  They turned out moist and tender and quite delicious.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and used Ritz crackers instead of Saltines and also increased the seasonings. This worked well for me because we have one family member who is fatally allergic to dairy and one who won't eat pork. It is difficult to find breadcrumbs that are dairy-free, but easy to crush crackers.  I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts for the non-pork person and it was a great success. The chicken worked out even better than the pork. One other point, both meats looked better before I turned them.  I think they really didn't need to be turned.

These were okay.  Granted, I made some changes, so I know it's not entirely fair to review the recipe, but I wanted to anyway.  I replaced the saltine crackers with a mixture of flour and bread crumbs and added salt, pepper, and extra garlic and onion powder, but the pork chops ended up being a little bland.  I think this recipe would be improved with additional seasoning.

I made this exactly as stated except my pork chops were very thick cut. I loved the flavors, but even after taking the chops out at about 35minutes, they were overcooked and a little dry. Not sure how that would work if the chops were thin. I will try it again, for sure.

Brined the porkchops which added some salt for flavor.  Was pleasantly shocked at how good this came out.  Some pieces - the bottom crust stuck to the baking sheet.  I'll use Reynold's Release next time or spray cooking spray, but my boyfriend was scraping at that delicious crust to get it all.  Might add some dijon to the egg wash next time for more flavoring.  This is awesome!

BLESS YOU! This is the first pork chop I could get my 7-year old to eat, and he even finished a whole one!  The only thing I changed was how long I finished them in the oven; only needed about 20 minutes for thin chops.  Thanks for sharing!

Great ! My husband said this is the way to do pork chops everytime.  I used thick cut boneless chops.  Baked them for about 40 minutes.  Didn't have onion powder, but used seasoning salt and black pepper.  Definitely a wonderful recipe

I made this for dinner tonight, it was just what I was looking for, easy to prepare and very tender and tasty.  I took other peoples advice and added 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning and I also added 1/4 cup Italian Bread Crumbs along with the Saltine Crackers.  Very good - I will make this again.

Nice recipe - but how do you keep the coating on the chops - when I flip them,the coating sticks(using foil on a cookie sheet)DON'T want to use too much oil.

YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly, except just seasoning the porkchops themselves before breading with the cracker mixture. They turned out so good- my fiance who is so picky raved about them! I baked them for 40 mins, flipping once, and they turned out fine & not dry. This recipe is definitely a keeper, thanks!

Finally, a great go to recipe using ingredients you already have in the pantry! Crunchy outside, juicy and flavorful inside. Even my picky kids liked these! I used slightly thicker pork sirloin chops (that's what I had in the freezer) and, after browing them as directed, baked approximately 35 minutes. My husband, who prefers grilled pork chops, said he really liked these and I had to agree. For those who haven't tried putting the seasonings into the egg wash, I have to say you are missing out. The meat is more flavorful by seasoning the eggs as directed. Otherwise, you get an overseasoned crust with flavorless meat.  Thanks, again, for such a wonderful & SIMPLE recipe.

I will only rate a recipe five stars if I have made NO changes (DUH), and this one was perfect.  We've served it for our church soup kitchen using pork loin and served over 200 people without a single complaint, my family loves it, and it's great AS IS.  Not to be a hypocrite but we ran out of saltines and had to use some Ritz Crackers, and YUM!!!

Been using this exact recipe for decades. Developed it from a recipe my aunt used for fried rabbit decades before that. Always thought it was MY recipe. LOL 
Everyone who eats it loves it. We take the leftover egg wash and mix it with the left over saltine crumbs plus one tablespoon of self rising flour and drop by teaspoonfuls into the hot fat for a type of hushpuppy or spoon bread. Everyone loves those too.

I have to say I didn't love these. I added the spices (and some additional ones not called for in the recipe like paprika/weber grill seasoning/and coriander) to the crackers instead of the egg mixture to make the flavors stick a little better (per other reviewers suggestions) but the taste was not outstanding, and still sort of bland in my opinion. I got the pan and oil super hot before frying, but when they came out of the oven they were still soggy. I dont love pork to begin with, so maybe this isn't a valid review, but I wouldn't make this again.

I made these twice and both times my family loved them. I used butterfly chops cut in half. The baking time could be slightly less because the first time they were a tiny bit dry.

I've always been scared of making anything pork (other than ham and bacon). I have in the past and it always comes out too dry because I'm afraid I'll undercook it. We JUST found a really good deal on pork chops at the store yesterday so I figured it was time to get over my fear. I bought 2 packs and came to surf for recipes, and this seemed nice and simple. WOW! SO impressed with how these came out!!! Thank you so much. I'll definitely be making these again!

These were very very good. I added quite a bit of different seasoning just sort of whatever I could get my hands on at the time lol. The breading was very good and we will make these again for sure. Thanks for a great recipe!

My DD picked out this recipe tonight and she picked a winner! I had a 1/2 a pack of panco to use up and added them to my crumbs along with a few shakes of Mrs.dash.  I put them on a rack and sprayed with Pam. Baked and they were wonderfully crunchy and crispy.My chops were thin and I only needed about 30 mins for them to be perfect. Thank You Arejay59!! I will be using this recipe again and again!

wonderful recipe. Did add seasoning to the crushed crackers though b/c it didnt make much sense to waste seasoing on an egg mixture which only serves the purpose on "glue" basically to keep the crumb coating on. Plus the seasoning is what gives flavor and you want the flavor on the meat

I had given up on ever cooking pork chops again but decided to try these based on the rave reviews.  The reviewers were right; these are delicious!  I followed others' suggestions and put seasoning in with cracker crumbs (also added fresh ground black pepper.  I have already made these twice and both times. . . YUM!

I used panko bread crumbs(on hand) and shaved aged parm, cheddar, and provolone on them for the last 10 minutes.  It works for me!  Thanks.

I used a wrought iron skillet. After browning the chops, I placed the skillet with the chops directly in the oven. Baked at 325 for 20 minutes.

This was delish. Decided to try it as I had all the ingredients and didn't want to do the old shake'n'bake. Did do as some others did and added the seasonings to the crumbs. And also added some cajun seasoning as I love a little kick. That's why it didn't get 5stars, I had altered from the original. Took a pic of my daughters plate. She is 3 and everything (even her edamame) gets dipped in ketchup. She ate with no argument though! Mommy and daughter were happy campers. :)

Made this recipe for dinner tonight and we loved it.  I've always had problems with tough, dry pork chops, but that won't be a problem anymore.  These were so moist and tender, you could literally cut them with your fork.  This will be my go to recipe for pork chops from now on.  Thanks so much for sharing this reacipe AREJAY59.

Added italian seasoning,and put all seasonigs in with the crackers like others suggested. My chops were about 1/2 in thick i cooked them for 15 min on each side and they came out perfect. Family loved them but wished i would have made some gravy to drizzle on them.

Pretty darn good. I seasoned my pork chops with fresh ground pepper, garlic powder & a little "Tony Chachere's Seasoning" and put them in fridge for about an hour. Fired them in bacon grease from the morning bacon...  used saltines & seasoned Italian bread crumbs with added pepper & garlic powder. Put them on a pam sprayed cookie sheet @ 375 and baked for roughly 23-25 mins. They were tender and flavorful. I used thin chops for mine. I will make again. Thanks for recipe & helpful tips.

DeWayne thought they were good.....used more oil....did 9 boneless porkchops...used panko breadcrumbs which stuck really well....needed more seasoning...added  to the crumbs instead of egg which was good but was lacking something and I even used salt and pepper, next time maybe some tony's.....2 eggs was plenty.

I made this tonight and we enjoyed the flavor. I followed some of the reviews and added seasoning to the crushed crackers rather than with the egg. My chops were a little thicker than the "thin cut" that I usually get so I cooked them in the oven for 30 min. and they still came out a bit dry. Next time I'll check them after about 20 min.

This was a very easy, very yummy recipe. I gave it 4 stars only because I adapted the recipe to add more flavor and I think the original version would be a bit bland.

Like another reviewer, I threw in some garlic salt & other seasonings into some flour, did the flour step first, then the egg dip. After the egg dip, I sprinkled on some seasoning on both sides of the chop before doing the cracker dip, again to add more flavor. Finally, instead of using Saltines (some reviewers said it was too salty) I opted for Trader Joe's "social crackers" which are a basic butter cracker.

The result was awesome & I will definitely be using this recipe again. They were light in texture, juicy and moist. I baked them for 20 minutes on each side & they came out perfect.

Pretty freaking tasty and easy.  The only thing I would do differently is to season the crumbs more, with garlic powder and cayenne, and more black pepper.  It was good, but a tiny bit bland.

This was very easy to make and really good. I was hesitant @ first bc of the saltine crackers but I am glad that I did. Had this for dinner last night.  I added the s/p with the crackers, and rubbed a little on the meat b4 dipping in the eggs. This is great recipe. TY 4 sharing.

Made this for my anniversary dinner.  I got mixed reviews - some liked it, some didn't, no one raved. I followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe, but instead of crushed crackers I use crushed cornflakes (Post Toasties, Kelloggs, whatever, brand doesn't matter).  I use the cornflakes in a lot of recipes that bcall for breadcrumbs or crushed crackers.

I used the round butter crackers, I had no saltines, also added salt, pepper, and italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs.  I also cut the cooking time, because my pork chops were on the thinner side.  Turned out great!  The best breaded pork chops I ever made!

My family was tired of shake and bake so I tried this recipe. Absolutely delicious-I used very thin pork chops so next time I will bake only 15-25 min as mine were way overdone. My family wants this on the menu once a week!!!! P.S.--I used ritz crackers and some bread crumbs and they stuck perfectly to chops.
Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very good recipe.  Four stars because I too added a little more spice and put it directly in the cracker crumbs.  I also used Ritz (1 sleeve for 6 boneless chops) and they were very good.  28 minutes in the oven was perfect.

This was great,my family really enjoyed it. My husband was a little skeptic but after trying it requested an extra serving. Made a little change by blending 1/2 onion and 3 cloves of garlic instead of using the powder.

I always buy pork chops but my family never likes the way I make them - typically Shake and Bake.  So I tried this recipe and we were all pretty pleased.  Even my hubby who after hearing that I made pork chops opted to have a bowl cereal, changed his mind once I showed them to him - he ate 2!  My only thing was that they were a bit salty - I guess from the Saltines -so next time I will use the unsalted ones.

I couldn't get the crackers to stay on the pork chops. so i used regular bread crumbs instead. (as i was coating them)   But the pork chops were very tender! I would recommend this to everyone.

This makes some very tasty tender pork chops with a nice crunchy coating. I added season salt and topped my chops with sauted onions. This was good.

I thought this was delicious! The pork chops were so moist. I double dipped them in the cracker mix. I also put the seasonings in the crackers, rather than the eggs as some suggested. I added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning also. My family was very happy with the result! Oh and I didn't cook them for the full time in the oven. Per recommendations by other users, I cooked them about 22 minutes, to the internal temp of 160. Try it!

My husbands favorite! I use thicker chops and add more seasoning. I adjusted cooking temp to 350 to one hour, the chops are nice and tender! I make homemade mushroom gravy with fresh sage and roasted garlic mashed potatoes and peas on the side. Definately a meal when there is a special occasion!

These tasted good. I made 9 chops, so I used 3 eggs, 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 3/4 tsp onion powder, and 5 T oil. I didn't have any crackers so I used Italian bread crumbs. I also added about 3/4 tsp salt, a little more than 1/4 tsp black pepper, 3/4 tsp thyme, and 3/4 tsp extra Italian seasoning. I am only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I think there is an issues with the baking time. I baked my chops for about 12 minutes and they were perfect. Not dry at all, and just enough crunch on the crust. I served this with long grain and wild rice with mushrooms and green beans. The whole family enjoyed them.

I loved the idea of breading these with saltine crackers.  I put the spices in the cracker crumbs instead of the eggs based on other peoples suggestions.  I thought these were fantastic.  Definitely will make again.

Delicious! The only thing I changed was to season the chops with black pepper before breading. These had great flavor throughout. The outside had a perfect crunch to it, while the meat was juicy and tender. We loved these, thank you! :)

WOW!  These are the best pork chops.  My family and I were bored with my dry pork chops.  In fact, my youngest wouldn't even eat them any more.  He enjoyed these as much as everyone else.   Thanks for sharing.  I made these exactly as listed.  I did pat them between paper towels before serving.  They were so moist.

This was a great recipe! I did tweak the dry ingredients and added the spices to that. I added some Panko and Italian bread crumbs to the crunched up saltines. Kept my 1 inch thick chops nice and moist! After frying them up, I baked them on a rack so they would not be soggy on one side. I baked them for 22 mins on each side and they were perfect! Even my young kids liked them! Yup ... this one is going into the regular rotation! :-)

The pork chops did not come out dry, however they had no flavor. I made the recipe exactly as indicated, I'm not sure what I could have done to give the chops more flavor.

I was skeptical about this recipe due to the lack of ingredients.  But with a bit of pepper thrown in with the other spices it was surprisingly VERY GOOD!  Hubby loved it with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Will make again.  ;0)

This is a good base recipe. You can really add any spices you want to the crackers (not the eggs) to suit your taste. I used garlic, salt & pepper and I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top during the last half of baking.  Chops were medium thick and I baked them for 35 minutes after cooking them in the oil as suggested.  They were delicious and juicy.  Even my three year old who doesn't eat much meat loved it. I'll cook this again.

This was very good, but the next time I make it I want to spice it up a little differently.  Pork chops were beautifully browned.  I served it with some mac and cheese and stewed tomatoes.  Perfect comfort food on a cool, fall evening!  Thanks for sharing!

I have to say this is a regular dinner at our house.  We have it maybe twice a month.  I have made it with all different thicknesses of pork chops and I must say, if I am going to go way thick (2" or so) I like to soak mine in buttermilk over night.  This recipe is relatively simple to make, instead of saltines I like buttery Ritz crackers.  Serve along side "Roasted Potatoes with Greens" and you have a wonderful meal!

Whoaaaaaa! This is wonderful!!! I just fixed this for my family and it was absolutely delicious! I was afraid it would stick to the pan like one reviewer said, so I lined the pan in aluminum foil and sprayed it with Pam. It didn't stick and my family and I simply loved it! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I haven't had great luck with pork chops, but these came out REALLY good!  I used italian bread crumb.  I try not to alter recipes the first time I make them, but this was a "desparation dinner" of sorts and I had to use what was on hand.  I also shortened the cooking time to about 20 minutes and they were done perfectly.  THANKS for the recipe!

I liked this a lot.  I didn't have saltine and didn't want buy them for one dish so instead I used (for two of us) 1/2 packet Stove Top Stuffing crumbs, put them in the processor until they were fine crumbs, dipped the cutlet in egg, then crumbs, browned them and put in the 375 oven for 25 minutes, which was plenty of time.  I think 45 minutes was for years ago when meat wasn't processed like it is today.  I'm 75 and I remember when my mother would bake or fry pork until it would break if dropped.

This IS mom's recipe. It smells like mom, it brings back so many great memories of pork chops and apple sauce.

 HOWEVER,

45 minutes in the oven is way too long. It turns out like shoe leather.

25-30 is best, if that. 

I now we are weird about pork, but it's not the 1800's nor Biblical times. Pork is safe without overcooking it.

Wow..these were DELICIOUS!! Cut back on the crackers. I used 1 sleeve for 6 chops and double-dipped them in the egg wash and crumbs and still had lots left over. Followed other reviewers and added the seasonings to the crackers. Also baked in Pyrex 9x13 because it was easier to clean. They were crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside.

Super good! My kiddos were so quiet at the table tonight (a sure sign that is was delish). I only baked for 15 minutes because my pork chops were very thin. They came out beautifully golden and crusty on the outside and moist on the inside.  I will be doing this much more often.

We never cook pork chops so this was new for us. Easy recipe, came out delicious. We used all organic ingredients. I didn't cover the meat in the oven, so I guess that was correct. It didn't mention in the recipe. I did add flavor in both the egg and crumb mix.

This is the best breaded pork chop recipe I have ever made.    Crispy and tender.   I followed the recipe except I added the spices to the crumbs and they came out perfect.    Will use this recipe from now on.

My family loved this! I dipped in flour, egg, and then  Ritz crackers that I seasoned. I didn't fry, but put the chops straight into the oven at 375F for 12 min on each side, and sprayed with butter flavored spray. I've never had a pork chop that I could cut with a fork .  Amazing!

This is my new favorite pork chop recipe. My chops always seem to come out dry and tough no matter what i do to them. But with this recipe, for the first time, they were moist, juicy, tender and flavorful.

Tip: let the chops sit in the egg for 30 minutes or so, I think someone else mentioned this and they came out extra juicy when I took the time to do it.

Whoever posted this recipe: thanks a million, they are AWESOME!

Awesome! Big hit with.  I used Panko instead of saltines. Very crunchy on outside, juicy on inside. I used thicker cut, bone in chops. Only baked for 20 minutes after the pan frying and they were perfect.

Very good.  I used crushed Town House crackers and just seasoned them with garlic and onion powders to my liking.  I even added a little seasoned salt.  I put 2 T butter in a skillet and melted it before I put the breaded pork chops in it for a few minutes on each side.  Baked on small cookie sheet and they were yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I increased the onion/garlic powder and used Ritz crackers instead of saltines because that was all I had. One and a half sleeves of crackers was plenty. I served this as I would chicken fried steak, with a homemade white peppered gravy, mashed potatoes and vegetables. The boys really enjoyed this. I would make this again but I would season the cracker mixture with more spices.

I tried the recipe as it was originally posted. First, let me tell you that I am really not a good cook and any kind of meat I've cooked tends to come out dry and bland. This recipe was AMAZING! My family absolutely loved it and asked me to make this again. I did use a bit more oil than is listed and the cook time for me was 35 minutes. I cooked 6 chops of medium thickness. It went perfectly with french cut green beans. Thank you so much for sharing. I will look for more of your recipes to duplicate!

I'm not sure what i did wrong, but my coating kept pulling away when I flipped while browning and when i turned while baking.  After reading other comments, I added seasoning to the crackers as well as the eggs but still felt like the MEAT needed seasoning -will definitely season meat as well next time.

These were very tasty!  Made exactly like the recipe with one exception:  I sprinkled the seasonings onto the chops, not in the eggs.  I used Boneless Pork Loin thin cut chops.  My hubby said they were 'fantastic'.  They were crunchy and, for pork chops, tender.  I will definitely make these again.  Next time, I may try them with Panko.

This was an amazing recipe! I did add some salt, pepper and peperika as well. I split the amount in half for all the seasonings, and added it to both the crackers and the eggs. It was very good. My family loved it and even requested that I make it again. This is definately a keeper!

Absolutely yummy! Thanks soooo much for sharing! The only change I made was using Italian bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers!

Really good chops!  I rubbed the pork chop with  seasoning and put some in with the bread crumbs.  I didn't need to cook them for 45 minutes due to the thin cut.  Good recipe!

Tastey with added spices. I added Old Bay to the seasoning and quite a bit of pepper.
I also coated some chicken thighs and a breast with the coating.

Great recipe! Quick and easy to make.  I also add some red pepper and cajin seasoning  to my breading .  I only left my chops in the oven for 15 min, and they turned out perfect.

Excellent recipe! My sons couldn't help raving about the recipe. I made it as a lower sodium version by using plain bread crumbs, adding no salt seasoning and adding a few drops of tabasco to the egg mix before dipping. Will keep as a family favorite!

Easy to make and delicious. I made extra pork chops then sliced the leftovers and put them in a stir fry two nights later. I've never used saltines for a crust. It was fun letting everyone guess what it was.

this is a great recipe and very easy even for non-cooks. 
However, i did tweak the recipe a little with the spices and salt and pepper in the saltine mix.
It was fantastic!!

I was very impressed with this recipe. The only thing I changed was adding a bit of seasoning. I added italian seasoning to the cracker mix and it gave it a nice kick of flavor. Next time I think I might marinade them in italian dressing before I coat them.

My picky boyfriend LOVED these!  I added just a pinch of bacon salt to them and used thick pork chops and they were tender and juicy on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside.  I paired them with red potato's and a green salad.

I've been making pork chops this way for years!  I also make chicken nuggets with saltines (no baking though). I use Paul Prudhomme's pork or chicken seasoning.  You can add whatever spices you like to the coating. I highly recommend this recipe!

I didn't brown first.  Just baked in a toaster oven on pan lined with foil, turned over after 20 minutes, baked 15 minutes more and they were beautiful, moist and delicious.

These were pretty good. I added extra seasoning to the crackers and may have pan fried a bit too long. I had potatoes in at 425 so the pork chops cooked in 15 mins and were perfectly done. I am not sure how I would have corrected but the underside was not really crispy just the top and the surrounds.

Yummy!  I used Ritz crackers because that was all I had.  The only thing  I will do differently the next time I make these is to season the cracker crumbs with some garlic and onion powder and maybe some seasoned salt.  They came out moist and delicious.

this recipe was amazing...we added italian bread crumbes and cayeene pepper spice, which gave it a little kick. The pork chops were so tender the knife glided through the meat. also i used egg to keep the bread crumbes on.

I changed a few details, used ritz cracker crumbs instead of saltines, added a pinch of paprika and only used about a 1/4 of the oil it calls for with olive oil instead of veg oil. Browned them in the pan and baked for 35 minutes, very tender and tasty!

9/10- Used Panko and Pampered Chef Steak Seasoning.  Crumbs are crispy and delicious!  Had very thick pork chops and cut them in half. Next time, track the cooking time and temp.  (this time I varied it.)

This was really good, the only thing I changed was before I put it in the oven, I put a little piece of butter on top of each chop. And I also used bread crumbs instead of crackers because I didn't have any on hand.

Great recipe - I used Cheezit crackers - the Duos that had cheddar and Parmesan mixed - ohh did they turn out delish!  I find the key is to get the crackers as fine as possible.  I used two eggs for 6 thin pork chops.  I added garlic powder, a little garlic salt and paprika.  I did flash fry them in a mix of olive oil and butter and baked them 15 min per side on a baking sheet lined with tin foil and lightly sprayed with cooking spray.

These were very good. I used club crackers and panko bread crumbs (I was short on crackers). I did mix the seasonings into the crumb mixture instead of the egg, also I put salt and pepper on the chops before dipping and breading. I baked them at 325 for 20 minutes for 1 inch chops. They came out perfectly moist and delicious. I will make these again but I don't recommend cooking for the time stated. Thanks!

This was really lacking in flavor for me, though it may have been due to the thickness of the chop I used (1inch). In addition, I found using 3 whole tubes of saltines was a big waste - I even went ahead and did a double coating and there was still at least a tube of cracker crumbs being thrown away.    The only pro was the crunchy coating.  Will try another recipe next time.

Everyone LOVED these chops!  I did like others suggested and put the seasonings in the cracker crumbs, and it was wonderful!  The crackers added the "crunch" that I crave out of breaded pork chops, and I will be using this next month for a big family gathering!  Easy and delicious!!!:)

This recipe was great!  The pork chops came out so tender, my husband was very happy!  I had French's Fried Onions on hand so I crushed them up for the breading and added garlic powder & italian seasoning directly to the breading.  I also inserted a meat thermometer to make sure they were not over cooked.  I took them out after about 20 minutes and an internal temp of 165.  I will be making this again!

Very yummy.  I don't paticularly even like meat, but my friend made this recipe and I had three!  I am making them right now and am excited to share them with my hubby.  I give it four stars simply because it's so high in calories.  However, very high in flavor as well!  I added a little herbs de provence to my recipe.  Sweet and simple.

This recipe was really tasty and very simple. Instead of saltines I used part plain panko bread crumbs and part Italian flavored panko bread crumbs. My family couldn't get enough!

How yummy!. I pounded out the pork chops, just a little and I fried them, only takes about 15 minutes. They turned out tender, crispy, and perfect. Seemed they needed a bit of sauce, like a bit of BBQ. Will make them again, and figure out what to serve over them.

Awesome recipe that can make usually bland pork chops taste as good as chicken.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and added a bit of Parmesan to the egg mixture.  Plus I put tomato sauce on mine and I could hardly tell the difference between it and Chicken Parmigiana. My roommate had it plain and was so glad I didn't just shake and bake them.  Will definitely make again.

These are amazing! Very easy to make, and they come out fork tender. I'm usually terrible with chops; mine always come out dry and chewy. My new favorite way to make pork chops!

Quite tasty. I opted not to use a lot of salt since my crackers are salted. I added some parsley flakes to the seasoning mix just for a little color. My chops are thin cut so 45 mins in the oven would turn them into jerky. I browned on the stove then popped them in the oven for 15 mins. Yummy. Nice alternative for chops.

This was really good, although I used Ritz crackers. My husband likes anything crispy and it was!  I fried the chops then let them sit on paper towel before transferring to baking sheet.  I also fried them in advance and them put them in the over a couple of hours later (needed the oven space) and they were still delicious!!  Thanks! 4.5

These were very tasty and easy to make. The only problem I ran into was there were way to many crackers left over after I coated the chops. I also had eight instead if the six the recipe calls for. Cut down the amount of crackers so there is less waste. Thanks for this recipe, I will make it again for sure!!

This recipe was VERY good! But I like to modify all my recipes a bit. I used two butterfly cut pork chops. For the breading I used canned bread crumbs and crumbled up Ritz crackers, and added all my spices to the crumb mixture. Rubbed Italian dressing on them, fryed em in some oil in a pan and baked them. Will def. be making this again! Thanks!!

These were very good!  I used crushed ritz crackers and they were really good.  I followed others advice and put the onion powder and garlic powder in with the crushed crackers.  I used thick chops so baked for 1 hour at 375, they were perfect.  My husband claims he doesn't like pork chops as they are too dry, he ate his whole chop with no complaints!

The pork chops are a big hit at my house. To be honest I got sidetracked while they were baking and I never did turn them and the were still great! Nice to have a new recipe to add to the day-to-day menu.

These turned out great! I pounded centre cut loin chops to a 1/2 inch (after I brined them for 2 hours), dipped them in flour, the egg and milk (I only used 1 egg for two large chops) and I ground up two bread heals in my processer with two tsp of Mrs Dash instead of the crackers. I served it with rice and a sauce made from a can of cream of mushroom soup, a couple of dollops of sour cream and a 1/3 cup of sherry. Delicious! Thanks for the idea!

Was very flavorful.  Added some Pork seasoning to the Ritz club crackers and eggs.  Cooked it in an every day pan so it went right into the oven.  I think I used too much oil because it was a little greasy, I'll cut back on the oil next time.  My hubby really liked it.

You could cut down on the saltines by at least half.  The recipe also seemed a bit greasy to me.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was delish.....I added garlic and onion powder to my crackers and also added them to my eggs...I have never made pork chops before so I wasn't sure if I was supposed to cover them once in the over...I chose not to...I think next time I will cover them for half of the baking time and when I turn them in the oven take off the cover....they were awesome though...thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good recipe! Simple enough, however, for me it was not my favorite pork chop recipe. The breading on one side stuck to the pan while baking. Not bad at all, but not great. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :]

Yum!  These turned out very good.  I substituted egg substitute (1/2 c.) and used reduced fat Ritz crackers, thicker chops and olive oil.  Will definitely make these again.

These were good pork chops.  My husband made them for me and I first thought that I was eating fried chicken.  It has that similar taste.

Good recipe, to save time, I pound the pork chops with a meat tenderizer, then frying is sufficient enough to cook without baking.  Sometimes I add some corn flake crumbs to the saltine mixture for color but not too much or it will taste too plain.  I have used this on chicken breasts (also pounded thin) and this is my family's favorite meal.

Yummy! My family loved this recipe. I was a little hesitant about making this beacuse it uses very few spices. I like alot of flavor! But the salt from the crackers complimented the onion and garlic powder perfectly. My husband and kids loved this. Even my 1 year old ate it and he's such a picky eater.

I  dredged the pork chops in flour before dipping them in egg - as any trained chef would do. The idea of saltines sounded absolutely bland, so I used the fine Italian bread crumbs. I mixed my garlic and onion powders plus salt and pepper, and oregano (recommended by another commentator on this site) with the egg. Next time I'd probably double those.  The frying on the stove should be no more than a minute on each side until lightly browned. Baking in the oven no more than 15 minutes. Even that might be too much.

This is a good recipe.  I added the seasoning in to the dry ingredients / saltines.  You really only need two sleeves of saltines.  And I would suggest medium thick pork chops.  Thin pork chops cook way too fast and 45 min is way too long.  I reduced my temp to 350 and still only needed 15 minutes for the thin pork chops.

I didn't have saltines so I used Ritz. A little too bland for me  Next time I'll double the spices and see if I can get this to a 4*. Maybe add some salt too.

I don't normally like pork chops because they usually come out dry and bland, but this recipe was wonderful! It was surprisingly easy too. I didn't have the time to crush so many saltine crackers, so I used breadcrumbs that I had laying around, and it worked great. The breading on the porkchops cooked quite quickly in the hot pan, but perhaps my heat was too high. Will make this the next time pork chops comes around on the menu rotation!

This recipe has become a staple in our house!  I used other suggestions such as always use ritz instead of saltines, add a pad of butter on each chop and only bake for 15 minutes.  Also add the spices to the crackers not the eggs.  Delicious!!

Great tasting chops. Definitely add the seasonings to the crackers. Frying in the pan isn't necessary, place in oven and cook to 145. Simple!

Good but not all that flavorful.  Could use a white gravy of some sort.

It was good.  I think next time I'll try another reviewer's idea to just cook it in the oven with butter, eliminating the pan frying.  Too much clean up for only one part of a meal.

This is almost exactly like Mom made, and I always do my chops this way, though I use an oven safe skillet and cover it in the oven. The spices are of little concern, everyone likes something different.  Thanks for knowing that the old way is still the good way!

The pork chops turned out somewhat tough and a bit dry.  Very disappointing.  This recipe needs some adjustment to keep them moist and not dry out.

This receipt is just OK. I want to pass on a little changes that I feel it will help a lot.  First, I want to mention that seasoning the bread crumbs is OK but not needed if you use "Progresso Italian Style Bread Crumbs "  Second, pat the pork chops dry with paper towel to remove the moisture from the outside of the chops. Next, season the chops with your favorite seasons, Tony Chachere's Creole Seasonings, if you can find it. is my choice. Sprinkle like salt.  After the chops have been seasoned, dip them in egg mixture, and then coat with the bread crumbs.
Finally fry chops in large frying pan with 1/4" of vegetable oil for 5 minutes on each side pending how thick your chops are. But 5 minutes is a good start. At this point you need not put them in a oven to dry them out, the chops should be crunchy and juice ready to eat. Enjoy!

Love these pork chops. Just two hints (NOT changes!) First add about one tsp of sugar to the cracker crumbs. The sugar does not add sweetness but the sugar will melt and helps 'glue' the breading onto the chop. Secondly, press the chops into the crumbs first then in the egg then into the crumbs again. This gives you a good solid coating and will not drop off the chops when cooking.

I liked the crunchy coating on these chops. I seasoned the chops first, dipped them in egg wash, then pressed them into crushed "bacon flavored" Ritz Crackers. My chops were a bit thin so I didn't bake them as long. I will make these again.

I added finely chopped pecans to the breading and only cooked the chops for 30 minutes.  They were thin and 45 minutes would have been too long.  Everybody liked them and I will make them again.

I substituted bread crumbs for the saltines. Also I added sage to the recipe. I also would put the seasoning in the crumbs. I also salt and peppered the chops as the first step.

We didn't have any saltines, so used finely crushed snack-style crackers (triscuit/wheat thins/etc).  These pork chops tasted amazing!  Exactly what I was looking for in a breaded chop.  We did season the chops with pepper and the garlic and onion before breading.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was a wise decision!  I wasn't  a real fan of pork chops until now.  I didn't have saltines, but did have Ritz crackers.  It was absolutely delicious and just fabulous!  My family just loved the dinner.  I'll be making this recipe all the time.

A staple in our house! I do like others have suggested by adding the seasoning the cracker crumbs instead of the eggs. I also like to use Ritz crackers for this. SO good!

Probably will make it again.  Was a little blah still for me, so I would 'spice it up' a bit more.  That said, although a bit overdone on the outside, the chops were moist and pretty tasty.  If you do use thin-cut pork chops,  I would check at 30 minutes and use a thermometer.

I did as one reviewer suggested and put all seasonings in with the crumbs. I also double breaded them. They came out so moist and flavourful. I will definitely be making this one again. It's a keeper. 
Thanks for the great recipe.

My boyfriend said 'This is the best thing I have ever eaten.' The only changes I made were to repeat the egg and cracker step for extra crunchiness and to fry in olive oil. We served with hot pepper jelly and potatoes au gratin and these were so good!

Next time I'll bake it in glass Pyrex because the cookie sheet browns too efficiently. I'll also use Ritz crackers instead. Also need to add additional seasoning to meat.

I don't usually cook, but I decided to try pork chops for a Valentine's dinner because it's his favorite. This recipe seemed easy, and I read quite a few reviews before attempting.  I followed for the most part, but added a few things after checking the reviews. My husband likes center cut, bone-in, so that's what I bought instead of thin cut. I also sprinkled salt, pepper, and a little Tastefully Simple steak seasoning on the pork chops, lightly coated them with flour, then dipped in the egg and continued on as directed. Before frying, I let the meat sit in the saltines for 30 minutes to help it stick as someone suggested. I also added a little vegetable oil to the pan every time before cooking, even when flipping over. It seemed to help give it that golden brown look instead of cooked crackers. Finally I spread a little butter over the golden brown coating before baking, and on the other side when I flipped them. My pork chops cooked for twenty-one minutes on one side and twenty-one on the other in an electric stove. I did take the suggestion of letting the chops sit on paper towels before serving. The recipe came out absolutely delicious and I will make it again! =D

The family loved it. I burnt the crackers crisping them though so I wasn't impressed. My first pork chop was the best, whereas I used 1/4 cup of veg oil for just that one! It turned out flawless. I recommend pouring veg oil after every pork chop, maybe not 1/4 cup but enough to brown them just right. Good recipe!

Sorry, I can't give it 5 stars because I altered it a little...I used "HOT AND SPICY" CHEEZ-ITS instead of saltines, but kept everything else the same. They came out AWESOME!!!... All 5 of my kids loved them too, which is a miracle because my one son only ever eats PB&J (breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and even at school... Always PB&J!)! So if he likes them they must be good!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Really good!  I had tenderized pork chops so they were super thin, was worried about the cooking time 30 minutes was perfect.

When I make this again, I think I'll probably brine them for a few hours before breading them.  And I'll probably add more seasoning, it seemed kind of bland.  I'll add minced garlic and double up on the onion powder and maybe add some red pepper.

This is a good basic recipe. Next I will try Worchester sauce instead of onion powder. I only had onion salt and that did not seem to add much flavor.

These were great! I usually kill pork chops, but this made a tasty recipe. I never thought of using Saltines for breading!
 Beware of cooking time though. I used an instant read thermometer before putting them in the oven - they were already 100 degrees after frying, so only needed to bake about 5-6 minutes on each side in the oven.

This recipe is so good!  I used Ritz crackers instead and only baked the chops for 15 mins because they were so thin.  Very tender, I might have used to much oil but so tasty!  I also mixed the spices with the crackers instead of the eggs.  Will definitely make this again.

This is the best baked pork chop recipe that I have seen. I make it at least once every couple of weeks. I use Progresso Italian bread crumbs and also spread melted butter on the baked pork chops before they go into the oven. My family loves them.

My picky 5 yr old loved it.  Used center cut chops but pounded them out a little.  Baked 27 minutes total. Maybe could have been a few min less.  Put seasoning in cracker crumbs - added paprika.  Used 2 sleeves of crackers for 4 chops and still used same amount of seasonings.  If you use 3 or more sleeves of crackers, may want to add additional amount of seasoning to have a lot of flavor.

I was in a huge hurry when I made these, and I'm just now realizing they were supposed to be fried, then baked, so I'm rolling my eyes at myself.  I fried them completely on the stove top, but I'd have preferred to just bake them.  That being said, these were okay as fried pork chops, but not my favorite.  Perhaps because of the crackers I used (no Saltines in the house but plenty of Ritz), they were okay flavor wise but not that impressive.  I did taste more of the Ritz than anything else on the breading, and they were a tad too oily for my taste.  The breading also comes off pretty easily in the pan as well. Not bad, but I'd prefer to completely bake next time.  Next time I'll try to remember to read the recipe more closely!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good.  I used thick cut chops and baked for only 30 minutes and even that was too much.

Simplicity. I apprecaite that. I am not a well seasoned cook and althought I changed things, the general idea was still present. I didnt have all the the seasoning that was instructed, so I used a generic catch-all seasoning. I also used Club Crackers instead. It got good reviews so it will be something I do in future.

YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS! Made this many times now and the only thing I do differently is add a little extra salt to the egg mix and double dip the chops in the egg mix/crackers for a thicker crunch on the chops! So moist! So crunchy! Everyone in my family loves them and loves when I make them! Added it to my favorite recipes book! TY!!!!

I love how crispy these pork chops turned out.  Almost like chicken-fried pork chops.  Baked them alone once, second time, I added some cream of mushroom soup to the pan.  Liked it both ways.  I think I'll try the cracker crust on other meats.

Used Penzeys' pork chop seasoning and black pepper directly on chops, delicious!  For 10 chops (1/2") needed 3 eggs and 1.5 sleeves saltines.

OMG!!!! This the best "Pork Chop" !!!  It's juicy and crunchy like fried chicken !  LOVED IT !  It's a keeper for me.  I use cornflakes and Ritz cracker together.  Next time I cut down the salt in half.  A bit salty for me.  Thank you for sharing and everyone else for your input on this receipe.

This was tasteless.  The recipe was very wasteful and the flavor was extremely bland.  I could have used 1 egg and half a sleeve of crackers.  I tried to pack on the egg batter and cracker topping, but it wouldn't stick.  We ate it because we were hungry, but what a waste of food and calorie intake.

This is the best pork chop recipe I've ever tried. I added a small amount of italian bread crumbs to the cracker crumbs and added some spices to that mixture rather than in the egg mixture as previously suggested. I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

Finally a simple way to fix pork chops that come out tender and moist instead of too dry, etc.  This is a delicious and very easy recipe that my husband and I just loved.  I'll definitely be fixing it again!

Pretty good. I do the same thing by cooking them thoroughly in my frying pan, but if the chops are really thick, the oven for me every time! I generally season in the pan as I'm frying to control seasoning amounts on each chop.

Yummy and very tender.  I used 1/2 Ritz crackers and 1/2 roasted garlic bread crumbs and seasoned with pepper.  I used the seasoned bread crumbs in lieu of the garlic and onion powder.

Yum!  I also added the seasonings to the crackers based on what others said.  The only thing I would change is adding about triple the garlic and onion powder.  But that's only because I prefer the "umph".  Will make again!

These are pretty good. It would seem like saltines would make for a quite salty pork chop but, they aren't and they turn out nice. Be careful about cook time though. I left mine in a little bit too long. Should probably check them every ten to fifteen minutes.

Super easy and tasty! I used bread crumbs because I had them on hand and also added a bit of thyme. Also added the spices to the bread crumbs instead of the egg since so many recommended to do it that way.

These are surprisingly tasty for how quick they are! Not my favorite pork chops in the world, but the effort/taste ratio is great. Do blot them on paper towels before serving, the olive oil stays around a little too much.

These are absolutely fabulous!  I do suggest marinading the pork chops for an hour before for an extra flavor boost.  Also, it only takes 15 minutes for mine to cook all the way.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was great!! I would add a little more garlic and other favorite spices next time but my family thouroughly enjoyed it, even my daughter who hasn't really been fond of meat.

These are awesome.  I used bone in, thicker chops, so I cooked for the entire 45 mins.  These came out tender and juicy!  I did put some extra seasoning on them just befoer I put them in the oven.

This dish didnt have much flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. It has great potential...Next time I will add more seasoning, and possibly fresh garlic.

These pork chops were seriously delicious.I salt and peppered the pork chops before I dipped them in the eggs and they actually turned out a little on the salty side.So, I think if you just follow the recipe you'll be good to go!

This was GREAT! good crunch nice flavor. I did was other reccomended and added the "spices" to the crackers instead of the egg. I love flavor so I add 1 tsp of both garlic and onion powder, also 1 tsp of pepper and salt. *my saltines were unsalted* I recommend it for sure! My hubby gobbled it down and so did my 6 yr old!

It is a good basic recipe. I just cooked it on top of the stove because I'm so paranoid about getting my meat REALLY done. It seemed a bit dry that way, so next time I put some cream of mushroom soup over it and it was really good! I think you can do just about anything to this to mix it up a little.

I was skeptical that adding the onion and garlic powders to the egg whites would impart much flavor, so I sprinkled them in with the cracker crumbs instead. I made this with really thick pork chops so I upped the cooking time by about 10 minutes - turned out perfect. Thanks!

Excellent, added Italian bread crumbs to crackers and also some pepper and Italian seasoning to the egg mix. Maybe over kill with the italian seasoning but it came out great! Will definitely be making again.

We made a big improvement by coating the chops in flavored Triscuit bits instead of plain saltines. We happened to have the cracked pepper flavor in the cupboard- added an awesome kick. We used thick pork chops but this still came out fine with a little extra time in the oven.

My almost 70 yr old picky eater Dad says this was the best pork chop he had ever eaten---I didn't have saltines--so I used cornflakes and a little salt.  I'm sure the saltines woul dhave been even better if possible!

This pork chop recipe was ok.  I used thin pork chops, baked on sheet with aluminum foil, but forgot to use a rack.  It wasn't too soggy underneath.  Just not the recipe I'm looking for.

Did not have any saltine crackers so I used club crackers instead.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and seasoned the egg and crackers.  Oh this is so yummy!  My cat also ate an entire pork chop:)  Thanks for sharing:)

This recipe is so easy to make and absolutely delicious!! The night before I made this, I made fried chicken with gravy, and I used the leftover gravy to top the pork chops. Though they absolutely didn't need it, the gravy was wonderful with them.

This recipe was a hit with my family! Definitely a keeper. Make sure to use adaquete oil, so that the crackers create a uniform crust! Very yummy!

There wasn't anything unusually special about this recipe for us -- agreed it tasted like typical breaded chops.

These are great when you are in the mood for a little comfort food.  I used thicker pork chops and followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out perfectly.

Delicious! My hubby and I don't eat a lot of pork because we never can find a recipe that works with them but this hit the spot! The only alterations I made was I used pork sirloin steaks instead of chops and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My husband also doesn't care for saltines much but he raved about the "batter" on this pork! Will definitely add this to the recipe box! Thanks for sharing.

I made this on a really hot day and did not want to turn on the oven, so I cooked them longer in the skillet.  Also, like some other reviewers, I used Ritz crackers because that is what I had on hand.  I thought it was an excellent coating for pork, but I think next time I will use it on pork tenderloin I have pounded thin, and that way, it will be easy to cook through in the skillet.
