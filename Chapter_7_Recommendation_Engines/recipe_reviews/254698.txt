I changed up a little and added mushrooms instead of onions as we don't like onions of any sort.  Very bland and the ramen were absorbed to the point that you didn't even see them.  I followed exactly how to make them and they vanished. Weird.  That probably took away from taste as well.  Would make my way again minus the ramen and I would not blend eggs in blender with cheese (I used Borsin), I would just whip eggs by fork and add in dollops of the Borsin.

This was a perfectly acceptable dinner for our family, but one that I will not be remaking.  It just lacked something to bring it to the next level.

I think this recipe has some serious potential. As it is made it is bland in flavor but has soooo  many possibilities. We ate ours with salsa and loved it. Next time I am going to add more of the cheese spread and maybe a little cheddar cheese. I am also going to precook some sausage or ham and toss it in. I mean you can do anything to this recipe. Make it once as is and then experiment with it. I do recommend more garlic cheese spread and I used real ramen Noodles not the kind that come with flavor packets. I didn’t break up the noodles because it was too messy. My family ate spinach. So it’s a winner for me.

This recipe was really easy to make and it was a hit with my family. However, we did all agree that it's missing something. We're just leery of adding sausage or bacon due to the grease. We don't want to lose the fluffiness. We may just serve it with a side of sausage or bacon.
