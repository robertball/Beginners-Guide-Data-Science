It was amazing. It tasted just like apple pie. You HAVE to make sure when you shoot it that you get the whipcream. I served it a bachelorette party and everyone loved it.

I did not like this drink! It sounded good, so I made some for my friends, but they were as disgusted as I was! Maybe I did something wrong...?

Loved it!  No Vodka aftertaste either.  Didn't think it was really gonna taste that much like apple pie, but it does!  Definitely my new favorite shot.

Made these at a party and got mixed reviews. Most loved them, it was very unique and looks great with the whipped cream and cinnamon. Some said it was too strong, but I thought it was awesome.

We used to do these in college where you sit someone in a chair, they put their head back and you pour the ingredients in their mouth.  When it's done they close their mouth, shake their head and swallow it down...mmmmmmm just like an apple pie!

Use a flavored vodka called "Whipped" - It's a blue bottle, I believe from France - Fantastic. I'm not a big drinker (thus the 4 stars).

made these for new years and everyone liked the appearance. the vodka was a bit overwhelming and most only talked about that. easy and cute but less vodka in the mix or using apple flavored vodka would help.

I expected this to be much sweeter than it was and it may have gone down better if it had. Perhaps adding a little Apple Pucker to it.

Great drink. I had Cinnabon vodka on hand so I used that and this turned out tasty. Tasted just like apple pie. And it's easy to make.

This really does taste like apple pie with a touch of alcohol! I would have rated this 5 star if it weren't the fact that there is only so many of this one can have.

I didn't have apple cider so I used a quality apple juice instead. These were very strong & difficult to get the whipped cream down w/ the shot. It was fun to try on an autumn Friday night but I don't think I will repeat...sorry.
