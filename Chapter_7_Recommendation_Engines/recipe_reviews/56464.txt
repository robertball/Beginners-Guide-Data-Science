In an effort to make these more healthful, I tossed the sliced parsnips with 1T olive oil, sprinkled them with salt, pepper, cayenne, and chile powder, and baked them at 375 for about 10 minutes. Delicious, and a nice change from potatoes and yams which I also do this way.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and simply peeled and sliced the parsnips, tossed them in about 1 tbsp of olive oil, and sprinkled with cayenne, salt, and pepper. I baked them at 375 approximately 10-15 minutes (turning once). They are FABULOUS. The sweet taste of the parsnip melds beautifully with the cayenne and salt. I will definitely buy a larger amount of parsnips next time and make a big batch to keep around for snacks. Much better than potato chips!

The healthier version Kirsten2006 mentioned in her review was just delicious. It's like eating guilt-free chips! I experimented with one batch, using some tandoori seasoning and a bit of sugar instead of the cayenne and it added another nice layer of flavour. I'm going to keep experimenting with different seasonings with this one. A definite keeper!

I have always wanted to try this vegetable and this is a great, easy beginner recipe.  The whole family loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Like some other reviewers, I used olive oil and baked them. I also put on chili powder and they had a great kick! The chili goes great with the sweetness of the parsnips.

The best!  We loved it, loved it, loved it.  We only used salt to season it because my kids do not like spicy.  Plus, we looked up parsnips on the computer and the health benefits excellent.

I don't think that the flour in this recipe added anything to the taste of the parsnips.  I think that I would prefer the version that does not use flour and are baked in the oven.  Thanks for posting.

I followed Leeney's more healthy version (baked, not fried).  They turned out great.  The mix of spices (cayenne, chili powder, s&p) really gives it a nice kick without being too spicy.

Love At First Bite!!!!  This is my first time eating parsnips.  I tried the recipe using the feedback of other reviewers and I'm hooked!  These are great.  I tried with the cayenne, chili powder and pepper and omitted the salt and they just taste like more!

very yummy. I added my pepper and Cajun seasoning in with flour also, and sprinkle a bit more on after.

These were a nice, tasty alternative to chips or fries.  I'll definitely do it again.

Of course, very strong flavor.  Second time, I mixed with potatoes, for a bit of variety and lighter flavor contrast.
