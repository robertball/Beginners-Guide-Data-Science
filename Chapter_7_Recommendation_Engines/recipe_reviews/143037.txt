This is great chicken.  So tasty.  I used boneless skinless breasts and they were moist and delicious.  I didn't make the sauce with Spenda as I don't care for it but for a person used to that taste I am sure it would be fine.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.  BTW - if you don't have fish sauce use soy sauce.

This was good. Used No Sin Sugar instead of Splenda.  I think you need the fish sauce for this one. Subbed crushed red pepper for the chile and it was SPICY.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Stevia instead of Splenda and a chile pepper out of my garden instead of the Bird's Eye and had to broil the chicken because I ran out of propane for the grill during preheat.  I was out of rice, but will definitely serve this over Jasmine rice when I make it again.  Thank you for sharing!  This is a keeper.

i totally forgot the chile dipping sauce so that's why i'm going to give this the benefit of the doubt.. otherwise the marinade was quite bland.. i used light soy sauce instead of fish sauce and halved the turmeric.. used black instead of white pepper.. used this on chicken breasts.. squeezed some lemon on it.. maybe if it would have had lemon and a bit of salt or maybe if i used the fish sauce it wouldn't need the dipping sauce.. either way the chicken was enjoyed.. more so by my bf than me.. but either way.. ty for the recipe.. would like to see if the dipping sauce makes that much of a difference
