This is good, but my mom really doctors up the sauerkraut to make it super tasty.  She cooks up some bacon, removes bacon and sautes an onion in the bacon fat and then lays the sauerkraut on top of the onions to let them brown about 10-15 minutes (stirring a few times) and  next adds about 3/4th cup of dry white wine and lets it simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour, stirring every 15 minutes (just so it doesn't burn).

Wow! All of my life I've made pork and sauerkraut or kielbasa and sauerkraut by dumping a bag or two of sauerkraut in the pot, some water, then the meat. I never added fresh cabbage or used the fatback (salt pork). This is the best recipe I've ever tried -- and our whole family loved it! I was afraid that there wouldn't be enough liquid after draining the kraut, but the cabbage and kraut made their own liquid. The result is flavors that are much more intense than with boiling in water alone. One other comment -- this is salty! I love it that way, but some people may prefer it a bit less salty. Perhaps rinsing one of the bags of sauerkraut may tone it down. This is a keeper in our family cookbook!

Just like my mom and grandma used to make, right down to the Jewish rye bread! I never got their recipe so I was glad to find this.  Rinse the sauerkraut a few times in fresh water to cut down the salt.

This was great. Like another reviewer, I cooked a few slices of bacon first. Then I added some chopped onion and sauteed that. After that was tender, I chopped up the crisp bacon, tossed all that with sauerkraut (rinsed) and then added about half a bottle of beer. I put the sliced kielbasa on top and simmered it for about 5 minutes.  Mixed it all together, and then covered it and simmered it for about 40 minutes more.  I served it with spicy brown mustard and rye bread.  Yum.

I use an all beef polish sausage instead of the kielbasa and the spices from the kraut more than make up for the different selection of sausage.   This will also tone down some of the saltiness without losing any of the spicy flavor.

I made the following changes:
I used thick cut bacon instead of fat back
I added onion to the rendered fat and cooked until translucent then added cabbage and sauerkraut.  I added about 1 tsp Montreal steak seasoning.  
I served with mashed potatoes to which I added 2 T cream, 3 tsp butter and sour cream.  
condiments:  mustard and horseradish.

This recipe is a winner all the way around.  I live "up north" and couldn't find fat back in my market.  I used salt pork that I blanched to reduce the salt.  It still turned out a great meal.  I've made it for a crowd of people who all raved about it.
