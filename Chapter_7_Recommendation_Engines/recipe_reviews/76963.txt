A great soup base.  I omitted the proscuitto--expensive and not needed for flavor with the sausage.  cut the chicken stock in 1/2 and added 1/2 & 1/2, chopped kale and 2 garlic cloves.  Received rave reviews from my clients, they asked me to put it on my "keeper list" P.s. Canned beans are the only way to go and taste just as good or better in my opinion with the little time we have on our hands at night.  Just be sure to rinse well.

WOW!  Fantastic!  This is the white bean soup recipe I've been looking for.  I made a few alterations, but it turned out to be just as good as the Tuscan White Bean and Pancetta soup at my local gourmet market.  I used only 1/2 lb. fresh sausage which I crumbled and browned in the first step, I chopped the veggies finely and I used a turkey stock I made after Thanksgiving using lots of fresh rosemary.  I highly recommend adding in a fresh sprig or two when you simmer the soup- the flavor is great with the beans.  Also, I pureed all 3 cans of beans in my processor until they were just chunky- this made the soup very rich and thick.  If you want to be really decadent I think you could also stir a 1/2 - 1 cup cream or half and half at the end.  Great soup, and very easy!

I modified this by taking out the prociutto and using turkey sausage and green beans instead of carrots to make it South-Beach friendly. It was delicious and very easy to make!

I made this one snowy afternoon. Very easy to make and oh so good!
My husband and I ate on this for 3 days and loved every bite! Great with French bread or cornbread. I could eat it without any bread.

Great Soup.  Left out the ham and instead of meat sausage i took vegetarian sausage( available in grocery store vegetarian section)and browned it in oil and added this to the soup. Also added 2 bay leaves to the pot.  Topped it off in bowl with salt and black pepper.  Delish!!! Thanks.

We've made this soup several times since it first appeared last October.  Tried it with regular ham and with country ham, but the prosciutto is best.  Everyone we have introduced this soup to has raved about it.

The flavor of the soup was great and easy to make.  Next time I'll add a second can of mashed beans to thicken the soup.

Loved this soup!  I didn't add the prosciutto, and I may try it, but I'm not sure it needed it.

All the sausage I had was hot country sausage, but Italian probably would have worked a little better.

The soup and broth after simmering was quite delicious.

Had to substitute butterbeans for great Northern, but otherwise made it exactly as per recipe using the hot Italian sausage. It was unbelievably good - would never have thought that a soup so quick and simple could have such depth of flavour. Thanks for the recipe with compliments of Mr P!

I usually make a soup every weekend. It lets us eat off it for several days, and as a working mom (with two jobs) I need all the pre-fabbed meals I can.  I dont mind letting is simmer all day, so I used a one-pound bag of dried beans and turkey sausage.  I soaked the beans overnight in the fridge (bag of dried beans saved $4). Browned the sausage and then took out of the pot and set aside. Since the turkey is so lean, I added a tablespoon of bacon fat to the juice and sauteed the vegies in that till they were soft. Then put in the DRAINED beans, chicken stock, seasonings, some extra pepper, a couple slices of smoked ham (because I had it in the fridge) and Garlic.  Simmered on low for about 3 hours. Stirring every hour or so.  Then used my stick blender to purree it a bit and tossed the sausage in and let the whole thing meld for another hour or so. Every time I came in from the pool to give it a stir, the house smelled better.  My daughter had a REALLY fussy friend over and she actuallly ate a bowl at dinner (the teen who eats only PBJ) and raved.  It was really good, hearty and satisfying. Served it with a crusty loaf for dipping.  I will definately add this to my regular soup rotation.  Next time, I may use a link of hot sausage along with the sweet that I used this time.  My Sunflower market sells 14 flavors by the link in the deli, so experimentation is easy.  Definately needs Garlic and maybe some potatoes next Time.

This really does have a slow cooked taste and is incredibly fast and easy!  I mashed all of the beans and it had the perfect consistency. I hate sausage casings, so I removed them, then browned the sausage before adding it.

Very delicious!  I made a mistake of putting salt while sauteing vegetables.  It turned out a bit salty but I added more water.  It was very good with crusty baguette bread.  I also added some oyster and cremini mushrooms that were in the fridge.  Yum!

This was freakin AWESOME! I omitted the prosciutto and celery and just used chicken broth and bok choy, I also added half of a rutabaga and some fresh spinach that I always have around, this really added some color and brought the soup to life. I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe if is a keeper and everyone needs to try this one!!! I also added a couple of pieces of bacon..... TIP: bok choy can be used in place of celery in recipes, PLUS, bok choy keeps much longer in the fridge!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I used fresh thyme and the house filled with aroma.  I also added some zucchini.  I served this with parm coated bread sticks. YUM.  Thank you for the recipe!

Delist dish. Make in Dutch oven soup pot. Add a splash of white wine when done browning veg. I used chopster to purée half the beans instead of fork mask (I think this eliminates the need for 1/2&1/2 some ppl added). Was delish.  Don't skip the prosciutto, it's the perfect salty seasoning.  Tasted like a grown up pea soup.

This is pretty much a keeper, though I made a couple of modifications. Like many suggested, I left out the prosciutto. Though I'm a big fan, I did not think the extra sodium and calories were called for when there's already (a LOT of) sausage in there. My other changes: 1. After browning the sausage (for a bit more than 5 minutes), I deglazed the pan with a little white wine. Then rather than using the same pan for the veggies (soup's got to go in a pot, no?) I did them in my dutch oven, and added the wine with good stuff from sausage pan with the oil. (I didn't use oil to heat the sausage...but did use it for the veggies). 2. I added a zucchini because I like lots of veggies in my soups. 3. I ended up using two cans of garbanzo beans and one can of cannellini (another name for the Northern whites) because that's what I had on hand. I didn't like the consistency of the beans when mashed with a fork, so I threw them into a food processor. I also felt there were already enough beans in the soup after adding one un-mashed can, so I pureed a second can as well. Finally, I used my immersion blender when the soup was all ready because I still felt it was too "chunky." I didn't blend a lot, just a tad, and ended up really liking the consistency. On the whole though, an excellent recipe with really good flavors that is light enough for a not-very-cold night but still very satisfying.

This was wonderful!! My whole family enjoyed it--even my 10 and 11 year olds. I altered just a couple items-- I rinsed the beans, only used one onion, and used bulk sausage. Otherwise it was the same--- and we loved it!! Thanks for submitting it!!

Maybe I have just been eating healthy, low fat soups too long, because I could practically feel the cholesterol accumulating in my arteries as I ate this.  The amount of sausage in this dish (as well as the half and half I added at the very end to 'finish' it - my one recipe alteration) makes it a very hearty, rich soup - I was thoroughly full after eating a rather modest sized bowl.  Still I wasn't as wild about this soup as I was expecting to be.  It turned out incredibly oily and (to my palate) almost unbearably salty.  I did make an error at the grocery store, and picked up 'Mild' italian Sausage rather than the 'sweet' or 'hot' versions specified in the recipe and this may account somewhat for the problem I had with salt and general lack of spice.  I was also in a hurry when I made this and was not at all careful about draining the grease from the sausage.   So I personally had some minor (and easily correctable) taste issues, but I will say that EVERYONE I served this to went nuts over it and told me repeatedly how delicious it was.  The next time I make it though, I think I will completely cook and drain the sausage and remove as much of the grease I can before reintroducing it back into the pot.

Ok, my soup turned out awesome. Just made it! However I did make some additions and changes.  I doubled the recipe so I would have left over’s for lunches throughout the week. Crumbled the sausage in the beginning and added about four cloves of garlic minced to the veggie mixture.  Also used both fresh rosemary and thyme and did not add until I was ready to simmer with the chicken broth.  Per a previous review I rinsed all the beans, and only used low sodium chicken broth.  At the end I added several handfuls of fresh spinach and about 3/4 cup of cream.  Yummy!!!! Top it off with fresh grated parmesan!

I am giving this recipe a five even with all the additions because I think I would love it even with the simpler version.

My husband LOVED this soup and he never likes soup!  I added garlic and mushrooms.  I also cut the onion in half and added shallots.  Overdid it on the prosciutto because my hubby loves it and on the chicken broth since I like brothy soups.   It was WONDERFUL!

This was awesome! I didn't have prosciutto, so I used 3 slices of bacon (chopped) instead. I also used some spicy chicken sausage, and since I only had one can of beans, I added some diced potatoes for the 'bulk'. Threw in some minced garlic to the broth. This is really, really, good - and it takes like it took 3 hours to make.

Finally, a recipe for prosciutto that doesn't involve cream or asparagus!  I actually didn't have any sausage either but it was still really good; should have made more though.  Think I'll make it again tomorrow!

This was a delicious soup!  I made a few modifications:  Used half of a maple smoked ham as the meat; added about 1/2 cup chopped green beans and about 1/4 cup 5% cream; added rosemary, garlic powder, and turmeric (for health benefits - doesn't change the taste, only the colour). I also used only a single onion, and it was more than enough - 2 onions would be a lot, unless you love the taste of onions.  The family loved it; will definitely make this again!

Delicious and super fast!  I used Turkey Sausage (hot) and added garlic and spinach. I also pureed a can of garbanzo beans.   Will make this again in the winter :)

I just made this was missing the celery and Proscuitto so I skipped the celery and added 6 strips of lean bacon in its place. I also pureed one can of beans with the chicken broth instead of mashing for a smoother texture.  It was awesome, I used sweet sausage but wanted a little heat so added a couple dashes of crushed red pepper flakes to the soup for the final 5 min. of simmering.  One tip, use fresh Thyme if you can the aromatic value boosts the flavor well, dried works, but the fresh is soooo much better!

Pretty good soup.  I crumbled and browned sweet Italian sausage rather than cooking it whole.  I also added garlic with the other vegetables.  I let it simmer for about an hour and then added a few handfuls of kale.

Very nice - used chicken sausage (not as much fat) and left out the prosciutto - added some fresh herbs and some salt and it was delicioso...would definitely make again.

I've had this soup simmering for a while now. It smelled so good I couldn't resist sneaking a taste. It is amazing! I think the thyme really makes this soup go from good to great. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think 2 onions would have been way too much. I only used 1/2 of a large onion and it was plenty. I ended up with about equal parts of onion, celery and carrots. I also added extra chicken stock, because it seemed like three can of beans was just too much.. I drained all of the beans then just refilled the cans of whole beans with water (I didn't add any water to the mashed beans). I didn't want that extra salt from the bean liquid. It is definitely salty enough from the sausage and the chicken broth. I also added some spinach at the end for some color. This is now one of my favorite soup recipes. Definitely not lacking flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this recipe! Thanks to the comments, I made some changes as well. I mash two cans of the beans using a pastry blender instead of one, I used ground hot italian sausage, I add a few splashes of half and half. At least 3 stalks of kale are shredded to ribbons and added with the other veggies, as well as 2 minced garlic cloves and a bay leaf (maybe a few shakes of hot pepper flakes if I am stuffed up as well). I omit the ham.  

When tasting before the simmering it appears bland, but do not be fooled! The flavors really come together.

I  started with Gianelli Sweet sausage patties which I broke up as they cooked, drained the fat off and set aside. Course cut sweet onion and celery along with red bell pepper  were sauteed in olive oil and were cooked seperately. I added the sausage and veg to a 32 ounce box of Swanson chicken broth and 2 cans of drained and rinsed cannellini beans and 1 can of chick peas. I made a roux and stirred that into my base along with 1/4 cup of light cream just because it was a snowy ,miserable November day in upstate New York and we needed comfort food. Oh, and to finish 4 small sliced garden tomatoes, tons of garlic and fresh cracked pepper.OMG it did the trick and I will make it again.

I didn't have Prosciutto so I used about 2 oz Panchetta.  Using suggestions from other reviewers I also added 1 tsp rosemary and one can of petite diced tomatoes.  We chose Hot Italian Sausage so no pepper needed.  Also didn't add salt as there was sufficient in the canned beans and chicken broth.  This was a lot of sausage so I added a 4th can of beans.  The spices leaching from the sliced, browned Italian Sausage really added a lot of flavor to this soup.  This was amazingly delicious. My husband rated this as our #1 soup but that was in the midst of polishing off his 2nd huge bowlful. Do remember to remove the excess grease after browning the Italian Sausage.

I made a few changes to make it healthier.  Instead of 1 1/2 lbs of sausage. I cut 2 spicy links out of the casings. Browned and then drained the excess fat. With what little grease was left I sauteed onions and thin slices of chicken breast. added carrots, one baked potato diced and only 2 cans of beans.  Added some fat free half and half for a richer color to the soup.. It turned out delicious.

Good, fast and easy. I would make sure not to use sausage with fennel in it next time (since i don't like fennel and didn't notice it was in the sausage!) and I think I would rinse the beans next time since I found it a bit salty. But very good.

Nice healthy hearty soup - used turkey sausage and added a small bunch of spinach.  Mine needed a lot longer to simmer to get the carrots and celery tender.

This was good enough that my children forgot to eat their fresh pineapple!  The few other times I'd served beans, they refused to eat them, so I was amazed that they plowed through these.  Outstanding!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I used a tube of sausage - the kind you would cut up to make sausage patties at breakfast.  I also used three different kinds of beans: navy, great northern, and small white.  I left out the thyme since I didn't manage to pick any up and I do miss the flavor of it.  Other than that minor detail this is a really good soup.  Nice textures and really great flavors.

This soup was very good with a few additions.  Like some others, I used smoked turkey kielbasa, omitted the ham,added three cloves of minced garlic, cayenne pepper and cracked black pepper.  No salt is needed as the kielbasa is salty enough.  This soup tastes a lot like pea soup, but cooks up quickly and tastes great.  I also drained, but didn't rinse the canned beans and it was just the right consistency! yummy!

Very good recipe! Worked well in my slow cooker. I ended up using about 1 1/2 pounds of pork loin I had leftover from dinner the night before. Diced it up and added carrots, celery, onions, garlic and potatos. Lumpy pureed two cans of garbanzo beans and added with the broth. Also added two cans of black eyed peas. Cooked everything with some thyme, sage and rosemary in my slow cooker on low for 4 hours. It came out perfect and creamy. Everyone loved it and it was so nutrious and easy! Now a staple recipe in my house!

YUM! YUM! YUM!  This soup was delicious.  It coculd have been a little thicker.  Maybe less chicken stock, more beans.  I used Chipotle Sausage instead of Italian because my grocery store didn't have italian and it was fabulous.  Definitely add the rosemary...perfect.

My husband loves this soup and requests it often!  I add a couple of potatoes, peeled and diced, to the carrots, and omit the celery.  Oh, and a couple cloves of minced garlic too.  I also add a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach at the end, and grate fresh parmigiano reggiano cheese on top of each bowl before serving. Yummy with a good loaf of bread!!

This recipe is an absolute keeper!  I did not have the proscuitto to hand, so I used 3 pieces of cooked crumbled bacon instead.  My husband is not a big fan of white beans, but he was willing to try it, and he loved it! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

It is 10:45 pm, and I just made another batch of this soup. I've made it a few times and it is so darn good I have to rate it. I make it  mostly as written, except for the following - I substitute turkey sausage (no flavor change from pork as I have made it that way too.  Note - do not use sweet sausage. It has to be Hot). I add 1 teaspoon basil, and instead of undrained beans, I add drained beans and substitute one extra can of chicken broth to replace the liquid. I also take two large handfuls of baby spinich, chop it up and throw it in during the final 20 minutes of cooking. I can't stop gushing about how good this soup is, and I made it lighter by using the turkey sausage.   OMG so good. See - I can't stop....

However I buy hot italian sausage and crumble it. 
I also skip the celery and the prosciutto.
This freezes great!
So easy!

Good. I used Hot Italian sausage. The consistency was plenty thick for me. Just make sure you really mash up the one can of beans, and put all the liquid from the cans of beans in the soup. I seasoned a little after. But definitely taste it first.

This recipe reminds me of what my grandma used to make when I was growing up. I like to put all my veggies in the food processor and chop them nice and fine so that way the beans are the more prominent thing you bite into.

Excellent comfort soup!  I substituted black beans and it was a huge hit.  Definitely a keeper.

Family & friends LOVE this soup! It's so simple to make and the flavor is just incredible. Ate a similar soup when vacationing in Italy and have been searching for a recipe for it ever since. This is the closest I've been able to get.

Only modifications made is omit the prosciutto, Crumble the sausage and brown, add a teaspoon of fresh rosemary, and mash up 2nd can of beans for thicker soup.

This is yummy!  I used Chicken Sausage to save calories and added one box of frozen chopped spinach at the end.  Will make again, again and again.

I really liked this soup...I replaced the prosciutto ham with some diced up lunch meat ham and threw in a couple of peeled, diced red potatoes.  Left out the celery and used a little less sausage.  It was very good and makes a lot.  I think it should freeze well too.

I have big eaters in my family of 6, so I use 4 cans of white beans (whatever is on sale).  I use turkey kielbasa instead of sausage as we usually eat a pretty lean diet. This is a great base recipe and I season and add vegetables as I see fit based on what I have in the fridge and what we prefer. Overall, very satisfying.

This soup was great! Tasted creamy...but still healthy...and had such a rich flavor! I didn't plain Thyme, so I added "Herbs de Provence" which were delicious in it! I would recommend it. It has some Thyme in it, but you also get this delicious added hits of basil, marjoram, basil, bay leaf, and LAVENDER! I really enjoyed it. I used only 1 lb of sausage (and it was still a lot. I can't believe the recipe suggests 1 1/2) Anyways, I recommend this highly. And it was so easy!

This is a very good recipe for a warm comforting soup.  I wanted to have a heartier main meal with this soup, so I added some diced chicken breast to the basic recipe and I used bacon instead of prosciutto as that's what I had on hand.  I didn't drain the white beans which helped thicken up the stock and right before serving I added a handful of chopped fresh spinach which wilted slightly as soup was brought to the table.  Hubby loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good! I made it as per the recipe, except I used ground thyme because I didn't have any fresh. I'll make this again, but I think next time I'll cut the sausage up into smaller pieces. It just seemed like slicing it made for really BIG pieces in the soup. I might take the sausage out of it's casing and cook it that way. I'll also add another can of beans. This soup was filling, and tasty.

My husband loved this soup.  I removed the casing from the sausage(bratwurst), crumbled the sausage and browned it.  I omitted the prosciutto, but in addition to the thyme added some dried rosemary and herbs de provence.  This soup has become my husband's number one favorite!

Great recipe.  I just found it to be a little salty (probably with the sausage, etc.) and will use low-sodium stock next time.

I absolutely love this!  Creamy base acheived without a flour roux or added dairy by mashing the beans.  I blended 2 cans in the blender, the other I left whole. A good chicken stock makes all the difference. This is my new all time favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

I am surprised at how awesome this soup was!! I LOVED it!!! I used a few of the tips from the other reviews - I used turkey sausage and also added some rosemary for seasoning. I only used 2 cans of beans (only because I did not want to run to the store to get another one). I thought that the flavor was wonderful - and was a great meal!!

Great soup!  liked the idea of mashing up the white beans to thicken the soup.  This recipe makes plenty - we even frozen enough for another meal - We are a family of 4!  Nice flavoring - great served with garlic bread!

For South Beach modifications: Used turkey sausage instead, no prosciutto. Deglazed with white wine and added a bay leaf. Just used two total cans of white beans. Swapped out carrots for green beans. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Definitely should have taken sausage out of casings, turned into a mess once my casings exploded while heating up. I tried it with turkey sausage - that might have been a mistake. Also tried to add kale but the texture didnt fit. And personally, I wouldn't mash the beans next time, I didn't like the consistency that it created.

I'm a big fan of this recipe and have made it several times. I use sweet sausage instead of hot. I used less onion because I'm not a huge fan of onions, and I used more carrots and celery. It can be made with vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth.  Also, I have substituted regular bacon for the prosciutto.

Loved this soup! I added a big hunk of Parmesan cheese (with rind) in with the beans and broth. The cheese kind of melted, giving the broth an almost creamy delicious depth! It also left some gooey delicious cheese on your spoon to nibble on when eating the soup, yum! I also added 1 cup of small elbow macaroni pasta in the last ten minutes. My whole family loved it, will definitely be in my rotation now. Very warm and filling soup.

Easy and delicious!  Picky kids loved it.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic, a couple bay leaves and doubled the celery & carrots.  Also used turkey kielbasa instead of sausage as that's all I had.  A keeper which is now in the meal rotation!

My family loved it. Probably would have been even better if I'd followed the recipe more precisely. Instead of 2 oz of prosciutto, I added 3 oz (because I bought a 3 oz package). I think the 2 oz called for in the recipe would have been sufficient. Then, noticing that the recipe doesn't mention salt, I added salt. Mistake! The prosciutto and the sausage had plenty of salt already. Wasn't fatal and I added some extra water to dilute the salt a bit. Served not as a soup but over rice and it was delicious; had salad and cornbread on the side. I will make it again and follow the recipe precisely and serve it as a soup.

This was a good soup. I stayed fairly close to the recipe--the major change being I used leftover baked ham in place of the sausage and prosciutto and used ham stock in place of chicken broth. I drained one can of beans and cooked longer than stated in order for it to get thicker. I ended up adding some garlic too. Using sausage probably gives it more flavor and doesn't need the added garlic. I thought it came out really well, and I think my husband is going to really like it too.

Changed a few things but overall this is a great base recipe, thanks. Used veggie stock (by accident, I didn't read the label til after I bought it) and Turkey kielbasa. I added a sprinkle of jerk seasoning, ginger powder and cumin. I also used dried white kidney beans which I soaked overnight but found the soup had to simmer for a good 3 hrs as the kidney beans take forever to soften up to my liking. Anyway it was delicious!

Love it. I used turkey Italian sausage browned and in large crumbles rather than sliced. Didn't use any oil. Sauteed the veggies in the tiny bit of sausage grease that was left in the pan. Did not use prosciutto but did add about 1/2 red bell pepper finely chopped. Used food processor rather than fork on one can of beans. Also, I threw in some Kale for the last 5 or 10 minutes. This soup is so good!

This turned out very well, despite my having issues with the sausage.  I found it difficult to slice the sausage 1/4 inch when it was not cooked all the way through.  I will probably make this again, but I will likely remove the casings from the sausage and brown it first that way.

This was a quick recipe! I made some changes. I used smoked polish sausage, 4 cans of beans and 1/2c of chopped flat parsley. I did not need to add any salt either. This was a wonderful supper on a rainy day.

This soup was amazing! I omitted the proscuitto and used chicken apple sausages I already had on hand. I also added an extra carton of stock, and also added some minced garlic. I used fresh thyme sprigs from my garden. I invited my neighbors over for dinner and everyone loved it. It was even more delicious in the days that followed, as leftovers. I would definitely make again. I served with 'bread machine rolls' from allrecipes.

Excellent flavor!  Used low sodium chicken broth and low sodium beans to reduce the sodium but still was a little salty for me.  Not really any other way to reduce the salt since they don't make prosciutto or sausage with reduced sodium.  Gave the leftovers to my mom and she LOVED it!

Excellent soup - just what my husband was looking for.  I did add a couple of spices.  A pinch of crushed red pepper, black pepper, a bay leaf, 2 garlic cloves and a splash of white wine. My husband had this soup while vacationing in Maine and this just about duplicates it.

Great recipe!  I eliminated the prosciutto ham and in its place, I added Cajun Andue sausage and regular smoked sausage.  Also, I started with a full bag of dry navy beans and soaked them overnight the old fashioned way.  The soup was great and the andue sausage gave it a wonderful little kick.  Thanks.

Incredible recipe. I've made it close to 10 times already.  I use hot italian sausage and take it out of the casings - browning it in small chuncks.  If I have no procuitto on hand, I usa salami and it works fine.  I mash two of the cans of white beans by hand and the 3rd I add whole.  I slice the vegies extra thin. Incredible flavor.  My picky family asks for this soup constantly.

Fantastic! The prosciutto and the mashed beans give this soup the flavor and texture of a soup made from scratch and simmered day.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using fresh thyme instead of dried because I happened to have some on hand.

Great start but I added another can of smashed white beans, garlic, potatoes and some fresh spinach. I thought it was better thicker...next time I'll add even another can of smashed beans - totally 3 cans.  I served it with shredded mozz and crusty bread - yum.  Thanks

Delicious!  Don't change a thing!  Would be great with cornbread or with rice.  My husband and 5 year old loved it.  Just remember to mash or blend one of the cans of beans.  I probably should have drained that can before mashing to make it easier...

Tried italian turkey sausage and didn't care for it, but the overall flavor, ease and method deserve 5 stars! Can't wait to try it with cabbage and smoked sausage as others have suggested.
