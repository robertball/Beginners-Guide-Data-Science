They edited the recipe. It's actually easier than they say... You don't have to remove the chicken from the pan after you've browned it. Just leave it in, add the onions, etc and go from there.

My Filipino family's chicken adobo recipe is very similar.  We use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 cup water, 2 bay leaves, and omit pepper. A generous seasoning of granulated garlic can also be used in place of garlic cloves.  A nice variation is also adding a little ground ginger.  Delicious over steamed white rice!

I have been making this recipe for a while and I make it with some slight variations.  I have never added the garlic powder or pepper.  I just brown the chicken, add the garlic and onion and then put in equal parts white vinegar, low sodium soy sauce, and water (start with 1 c each...use enough to cover the chicken in the pot).  Then I let it simmer for an hour.  It is AWESOME!  If you haven't tried chicken adobo, it is a must and this recipe won't steer you wrong!

If you don't like tangy, don't make this. It's very tangy, and yes, authentic Filipino adobo doesn't have sugar in it, but Chinese-Filippino versions do - usually rock sugar, 1-2 star anise and coconut milk is sometimes added. These additions definitely soften out the strong vinegar flavor. I always use equal parts vinegar/soy sauce and add about 4-5 tablespoons brown sugar and appx. 1/3 cup coconut unsweetened coconut milk. Or else it's fine without the coconut too. I would definitely use only dark meat for this dish, since chicken breasts dry out too quickly and make even worse left overs.

My mother-in-law (a filipina) likes to make her Adobo slightly sweet.  This recipe is nice and saucy unlike my MIL's.  So, I added about 1 tsp. of sugar.  It was perfect!  I'm going to make it again tonight!

There's no meet to put onions. Adobo is supposed to be salty, peppery and garlic-y. adobo also taste better with crunchy fried garlic bits and toasted (crushed) peanuts on top. And guys, I always make sure that 1/4 of the meat has fat or else it'll go super dry. If the vinegar and soy sauce started to boil, DON'T stir, or else the liquids won't thicken up. The sauce is supposed to be shiny. If it's too salty for you're taste, try adding brown sugar.

This was delicious.  The only things I changed in the recipe is I added 1 tsp of sugar and used bone-in chicken thighs.  My family absolutely loved the chicken.

If you like soy sauce, this is the dish for you. That was pretty much all my husband and I tasted. As one reviewer commented, it's pretty salty even with low-sodium soy sauce. It's not a terrible dish, but the flavor is one dimensional.

Oh.My.God!! This was absolutely delicious!! I've never left a review on here before, but after eating the leftovers today & being reminded of how yummy this was, I had to!   I tried to make it as close to the recipe as possible--but after reading the reviews, I had to make a few little changes :-) And I loved that I had ALL the ingredients on-hand! I cooked the onion/garlic til very brown (so onions would be sweet instead of too strong). I used chicken thighs, since that's what I had here.  Then *I also added about 1-1.5 C WATER so that the chicken was soaking more in liquid (and the sauce DEFINITELY didn't have a watered down taste!) *I only added about 1/4 t pep & 1/2 t gar pwdr.  1T sounded like WAY too much pepper, and with the garlic already in there, I didn't see the need for that much extra gar powder--and I LOVE garlic!. I wanted it extra saucy, so *I used 1/2C vinegar, and about 1/2C + 2T soy sauce. and finally at the end, after tasting it & feeling like it was a bit on the vinegary side, *I added about 1T brown sugar. This was a BIG hit!  My husband, Mom & I LOVED it, 8yr old said it was 'really good' & VERY picky 3yr old actually liked it (said "mmmm mommy this is yummy"!) (ironically my other 8yr old who eats everything I cook, didn't like all the sauce I put on his rice, and I had to give him plain rice. although he liked the chicken taste without all the sauce) Thanks Angela for such a yummy way for me to try making Filipino food!

Very easy recipe and the family enjoyed it! The only thing I would change next time is a little more onion and a little less soy sauce.

Delicious and easy. It seemed kind of silly to put in fresh garlic and then add garlic powder, so I just used about 8 cloves of garlic and added it with the onion. I used almost 5 lbs of chicken I think (leg quarters) and there was plenty of sauce to go around. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Adobo is easy to make and delicious with rice. Believe it or not, I throw everything and simmer (about 35 minutes). I usually use whole chicken cut up (or use legs), use the same amount of vinegar as soy sauce, whole peppercorn, pounded garlic, (it's okay to not add onions), bay leaf, and enough water to cover about half the meat. After simmering, increase the heat to "fry" the chicken from the chicken fat and have just a thickened sauce, do not dry it. I love using pork ribs or even baby back ribs instead of chicken.

I made this today but did it in a slow cooker and it was wonderful.  I used some boneless chicken breast that I had cleaned and previously frozen in individual freezer bags.  I put 5 frozen halved breasts in the cooker, added all the ingredients the recipe called for, but added some frozen roasted red peppers I had in the freezer to add a little color.  Set the cooker to low and 4 hours later added some frozen chopped spinach and continued to slow cook.  An hour later, I made some quick cooking white rice, boiling it in a chicken stock I had and served the chicken over the rice.  The chicken browned from the color of the juice and just fell apart with a fork, so very tender.  My husband and I just loved it, as did another male guest we had over tonight and there was very little remaining.  I know I will make this recipe often in our home.  Thanks angelaBBf

I made this for my husband who grew up in the Philippines.  He LOVED this dish.  He said it smelled and tasted just like home.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but used white wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  We thought it was too peppery so next time I will decrease the pepper to 1/3 tbsp or so.  For the other reviewers that thought this dish was too salty, my husband explained that traditional adobo is supposed to be salty.  But that can always be adjusted to your taste.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  This will be a regular at our house.  :)

I made this for the first time this week. We both enjoyed it. I followed a couple of different suggestions from other reviewers (lowered amt. of vinegar, added coconut milk to the sauce and cooked the jasmine rice with a combination of coconut milk and water). The next time I make it I think I will finish it with a few chopped peanuts or cashews. This might not be traditional but I think I would have enjoyed the texture of some nuts. I've filed it away in my "Quick and Easy Dinner" folder. Those are the best recipes: quick, easy and delicious.

I used skinless chicken thighs, and just skipped the browning step. I put in 1 cup of the low-sodium soy, and used only 1/2 cup red wine vinegar. Used 5-6 smashed garlic cloves, onion, 2 TBSP black pepper, 2 bay leaves, as well as garlic powder and onion powder (Jacques Pepin always advises to use both the powders as well as the actual onion & garlic for maximum flavor). I would have given this 5 stars, but I decreased the vinegar as I was concerned there would be too much vinegar, as other reviewers stated. I don't think there was enough! Next time, I'll use a full cup of white vinegar. Then I think it'll be perfect! Cooked in the crockpot on high for 4-5 hrs, & added in some matchstick carrots for the last 2 hours.

To lighten this up a bit to fit my weight loss program, I used skinned chicken leg quarters and did not brown them first in any oil.  I only used 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 2/3, and increased the bay leaves to 4.  This smelled wonderful while it was cooking, and the sauce cooked down to a thick glaze.  I served the chicken with braised baby bok choy and a cucumber mango salad.  Dinner was absolutely delicious!  Thank you so much for the post!

This is the world's most simple and satisfying recipe, and I make it even simpler. First, there's no need to brown the chicken. I've done it and not done it, and it doesn't make a marked difference in the flavor - you would think it would because "brown food tastes good" - but it doesn't change a lot. Second, I use whole peppercorns and just toss in anywhere from a tsp to a tbsp, depending on how much chicken I'm cooking, they cook down and soften and add a nice bite. Instead of mincing the garlic, I just hack the ends off of a whole head (yes, a whole head) or two (yes, two!) of garlic, peel them, and toss them into the pot whole, completely omitting the garlic powder because it just never tastes fresh. I like a lot of extra sauce because I eat this over rice, but I use less soy sauce than I do vinegar, at a very imprecise 3 glugs of soy sauce, to 5 glugs of vinegar, and then toss in a tbsp or so of white or brown sugar to temper the acidity. Everything else gets tossed into the pot at the same time, too, no browning, no precooking, nothing, for around 40 minutes, and it comes out perfect every time. If using bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, which I always do, the longer you let this simmer, the better it tastes, and the more tender the chicken gets. It's a pretty amazing dish - hard to mess up, easy to improvise and play with ratios, and yet always tasty.

I had never tried chicken adobo before, but decided to give it a chance. DELICIOUS! It doesn't get much easier than this. I used 5 lbs of chicken thighs with skin removed. I used 1 cup of regular soy sauce & 1 cup vinegar. I omitted the sliced onion since most of my kids don't care for it and used onion powder instead. I only  used about 1 tsp of pepper. This was one of those dishes where I couldn't stop saying "Mmmm" while I was eating it! Even though I didn't use reduced sodium soy sauce, I didn't find the finished dish to be too salty at all. I did add about 2 TBSP brown sugar. This was fabulous served over rice with steamed broccoli on the side. YUMMY! Oh yah, most of my kids really liked it, especially my pickiest one!

I was really excited to try these as they had great reviews and looks super easy.  I made this recipe according to the recipe with no changes. They were spicy, salty, and nothing extraordinary.  Just average.  I'll be deleting the recipe from my box.

I'm not sure what went wrong here, but despite using low sodium soy sauce, all we could taste was salt. It was so overpowering I couldn't finish my portion. I'll pass on this one.

Yum!  I made a slightly different version of this recipe, and it was sooooo good!  I used1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 2 bay leaves (as JC Perez listed in his version), 2/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup coconut milk, 3/4 cup water, and all fresh garlic.  I used chicken tenders, browned them first, then added the garlic and onion, sauteed them for a few minutes, then added the other ingredients.  I then added a can of baby corn, and  I simmered all the ingredients together for 10-15 minutes.  I served it over jasmine rice which I cooked in 1 cup coconut milk and 3 cups water.  Adding the coconut milk to the rice and to the adobe cut the saltiness just the right amount.  This was simple, filling, and fantastic!  I will make this again and again!

Another person said that chicken breasts dry out too quickly and make awful leftovers. All I had was chicken breasts and decided to try it anyway because it sounded so delicious. It turned out to be a marvelous dish just using breasts! I used 2/3c soy sauce, 2/3c white vinegar, and 1/3c water, and added fresh green peppers, fresh musrooms, sundried tomatoes, and fresh green beans. Served over brown rice with warm sourdough bread and salad. It was nice and saucy, and a perfect meal. I also thought the flavors blended nicely together, no overwhelming taste of vinegar or soy sauce. Thank you for this wonderful submission!

This was outstanding! I added 1 tsp of sugar as per another reviewer suggested. I too like a smidgen sweeter. You MUST use low sodium soy sauce and even then it is salty but oh so good. Don't skimp on the onions! I used a half an onion cause we normally don't like too many onions. BUT we WISH we used at least one big onion that would have been perfect. This dish has incredible flavor! I never had this dish before and I made the mistake of making spicy potatoes with it. You need mild sides with this one. Like Mashed potatoes or white rice. And if your nat a fan of HOT, I would cut the pepper down to a teaspoon. Definatly a keeper!

This comes out perfect every time. I make dream rice or Mexican rice. I also add corn starch to the adobo so that we can spoon the thickened sauce  over the rice. A+

I made this for dinner last night and everybody LOVED it. I did make a few changes to make it South Beach Diet friendly (I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and used boneless skinless chicken breasts) and it was still fantastic. We had it served over brown rice w/ a ride of sugar snap peas. YUM!!!

It was a little too salty for me, and I even put less soy sauce than it called for.  I also stir fried some veggies and added it to it.  It was very easy to make, just a little salty. My husband however loved it..So  I guess it just depends on the person.

This was really good.  I used 1/2 cup of soy and 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar because it's what I had and what I thought would suit my family's taste.  Skipped the garlic powder and used a ton of fresh garlic.  The four chicken thighs I used were so tender they fell off the bone after about 6 hours in the crock pot.  I added some red bell pepper and green cabbage for color and veggies, it was a really good combination. Served over jasmine rice-yum. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy recipe!  Used wings and bonless chicken breasts (personal preference).  I used 1 cup apple cider vinegar and 2/3 cup low sodium soy sauce.  LOTS of garlic - probably about 10 cloves worth, 1 tsp. of black pepper corns and about 3 bay leaves.  Browned the onions and garlic in the pan then added chicken.  Placed the browned chicken in my old roasting pan.  Deglazed the frying pan with the vinegar, soy, and 1 cup of water.  Cooked at 325* for about 2 hours (1.5 hours with the lid on, the last 30 min. w/lid off) and it was divine!  Great flavor!  Thanks for the inspiration angelaBBf!

I found the vinegar in this recipe to be extremely overpowering.  I had to add water and sugar to cut it.  After the additions, it was much better and my husband liked it a lot but I'm not sure if I will make it again.

This is delicious.  I used redwine vinigar and added some ginger (1T) and used chicken breasts.  Out of this world.  :) Next time I think I'll add just a little less pepper though, and thought I might put a little green pepper in it.  I can't wait to try it again!

This is a really simple and good adobo recipe. My husband's family is Filipino so he was raised on this. This passed his taste test. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it is too hot for my kids to eat. I think next time I will omit the pepper.

It has only a soy sauce taste. It asks for a whole Tablespoon of pepper and garlic powde and there is already 2 Tablespoons of garlic. And a Tablespoon of pepper is WAY too much. It says to "season" it so I think the tablespoon measurement might be a typo. I didn't have 3 lbs of chicken.

Yum! I originally made this recipe exactly following instructions, using thighs because that's what I had in the fridge.  We liked it but found the soy a little overpowering.  I altered it to use 1/2 cup soy and 1/2 cup vinegar - and with that small adjustment it is superb.  I usually serve it with fried rice and egg rolls.  My whole family devours it!

This recipe was a winner in my household! The only con is too much pepper. Next time I will use 1/2 tblspn of pepper. I see why low sodium soy sauce is recommended. If you use the original soy sauce the outcome could be too salty. Thanks for sharing!

This was great! My husband loved it! I added a cup of water and a teaspoon of sugar because I was afraid it would be too salty (as mentioned in some reviews) but it was really good.  He deemed it "Make againable".  This was a nice change to boring chicken. And it was so easy! Thanks for sharing!

My variations include adding a shot of sherry, a tablespoon or two of sugar and a piece of star anise along with the soya sauce and water. Cook that up and the flavour is far from bland, plain or just salty. For colour my dad used to add chunks of carrot and let that cook along. If you want to thicken it, add a bit of cornstarch (1 tsp or so) disolved in water, and bring to a final boil.

Very easy and good. For the person who says it was "bitter" tasting; my advise is to check the date on the vinegar.  Old vinegar will taste bitter.  My mom made this all the time and since she passed away I missed having this.  It tasted very much like what she used to make us. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I don't get it...I followed the recipe exactly, but mine didn't come out "saucy" at all.  Also, there was WAY too much pepper in this.  I'm going to keep looking for a good adobo recipe.

Delicious Adobo recipe! I added 1/3 cup of water in fear that it would be too salty, and it came out perfect. Next time I will add some more onion. I piled the sauteed onion on top of my chicken, I wish I had more for the left over pieces. Thank you angelaBBF!

What a disappointment!  We thought we were selecting something with Latin American influences that would knock our socks off but found we had an Asian salt lick instead.  If you like soy, this recipe is for you, but save yourself the time and the chicken and drink it straight from the bottle.  Not sure what is so famous about it except that none of us at the party will ever forget how much we disliked it.

I love chicken adobo and it's so easy to make!! My mother in law is Filippino so when she first made it, I fell in love. It's ridiculously easy to make and it smells divine! Would happily suggest for any busy parents (like myself) to make this, its ridiculously quick to cook and works great in a slow cooker x

I've lived in Asia for over 16 years so I am quite familiar with Adobo;-)  So my kids were quite excited when I was going to try and make it myself.

Used recipe as a guideline for ingredients and made the below changes:

Put fresh garlic and ginger into the cooking oil before frying the chicken.  I used 2 large chicken breast for 1 adult and 2 kids.  There is 1.5 portion as leftover.

Besides all the seasoning required we added a teaspoon of sugar, a .5 tsp of pepper, .25 c of water, 2 large potatoes.

Fry chicken first and then add all ingredients and bring it to a boil.  Once boiling, let it simmer.  Once potatoes are soft then its ready to serve.  If you prefer thicker gravy (like we do), take a 2tsp of corn starch and mix with 2tsp of room temp water and add to the mixture.  Let simmer and thicken to your liking.

Chop spring onions and garnish the dish.

Kids loved it!

My mother made this with equal parts soy sauce and vinegar, and no onions. The chicken was first cooked in the marinade and after it was fully cooked and tender (about 45 min), pan fried briefly in coconut oil, before adding back the sauce and heating through. I imagine many non-Filipinos would find this too salty, but remember that traditionally adobo is eaten with bland steamed rice, so the taste evens out. If preferred it would be easy enough to reduce the soy sauce/vinegar mixture and increase the water.

Made this recipe for 100+ people (just used the recipe calculator to increase the measurements to serve 108!). I followed the suggestions in the reviews to not take out the chicken after browning and to just add everything to the chicken in the pot. I don't really like cooking or eating chicken, but this came out PHENOMENAL!! It wasn't vinegary at all, and it was a really simple recipe! My house is blazing hot from the stove going all day, but it smells AMAZING in here. Thanks so much, will definitely use this for family dinners!

This is SOOOOOO GOOD! My roommate in college was Filipino and this tastes like the adobo her mother would make. I'm so glad you posted this one. The only change I made was to use Bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce to cut the sodium, and it was wonderful.

I have made this exactly as written many times.  My family loves it.  It is quick and simple.  I do prefer to use boneless skinless thighs and it takes no time at all to make.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Was a bit salty for my liking but once I mixed it with the rice it wasn't as bad. Good flavor once you get past the salty. Will try it again.

Great flavor!  I followed the recipe as instructed, with one small change.  My daughter does not like chicken bones, so I used boneless chicken breasts cut up into small pieces.  Adjusted the cooking time down a little to compensate for no bones, and it's fabulous!  Thinking of making this at our next family get-together.

Delicious!  Close to my dad's recipe who is Filipino.  We add the juice of 1/2 lemon, sometimes pork on the bone, or some firm chopped up bean curd (tofu).  You can also use apple cider vinegar in place of white.  Savory and soothing over fresh cooked white rice.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

wasn't a huge fan--there seemed to be way too much soy sauce. I also feel the recipe name should have some type of reference to the Filipino adobo vs. the traditional Spanish adobo. Very misleading.

We did NOT like this a bit - kids wouldn't even eat it and I barely got it down.  VERY salty (and I love salty foods normally) and no flavor other than soy sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly (something I rarely do) and tasted the sauce as it cooked - tasted too salty, so I added a few tablespoons of sugar to help balance it out (according to the reviews)and served it - ICK!!  Won't be making again!

Smells like Filipino Adobo as it was simmering in the pot. Taste great too. It needed Whole Peppercorns in there to make it more authentic

I dislike the chicken skin, so I made this with boneless, skinless chicken thighs that I cut into bite sized pieces. I also used rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. It was delicious!   There is definitely a very strong vinegary taste to it, but I loved it. I would probably add more black pepper next time.  I also added a cup of water and 5 peeled, hard-boiled eggs to the pot as it simmers (I think this is a Chinese or Vietnamese variant). The eggs soak up the color and flavor of the sauce and they are so delicious!

This is so good! omitted the bay leaf, you just don't need it.  Don't add other things like the others as then it's not adobo...it's something else.  Stick with the recipe.

This chicken was very good! I doubled this recipe. My entire family enjoyed it. I did modify a bit though. I changed the amount of pepper. I put about 3 tsp because, as i was adding it, it seemed like the whole 2 tbsp would be far too much. Even still I found it was just slightly too peppery. Had I added the 2 tbsp it would have been death by pepper. I also added about half a cup of water to create a little more liquid for the chicken to simmer in. All in all, this was a delicious & tangy dinner. Will make again & again.

This has been my go to adobo recipe for years. I started making it for my husband who is filipino. I've made it for several Filipino coworkers that loooooved it. My Filipino coworker actually asked for the recipe and inspired to cook his own adobo after having this recipe. It is sooooo easy and a really simple ingredient list. I haven't changed a thing from this recipe other than maybe doing heavier pours on the vinegar and soy sauce, but the recipe is perfect as is!

I've made this many times. I've both cooked it as written and made various tweaks. It's a great basic recipe to follow. I know a lot of people have used chicken breasts as a substitute and I have to say that is not ideal. The chicken can be quite dry in doing so. The only real recommendation I have (which I believe was an accidental omission in the recipe) is rather than using regular black pepper I've always known it to be whole peppercorns.  It's a simple recipe with a lot of flavor perfectly served with plain white rice.

This is a true Filipino recipe.  It was easy and turned out fantastic.  Very tasty.  If you are sensitive to salty foods don’t add the sauce to your rice.  Personally I loved the saltiness.   Very flavourful.  Will definitely make this again

AMAZING!!!!
Seriously guys, so so good.  Based on some other reviews I added 1.5 cups of water and a tablespoon of brown sugar the last 8 minutes of cooking.  I only used chicken legs (it’s all I had in the house).  I left the chicken in the pan when adding the onions and garlic.  Served the chicken over a bed of Thai style jasmine rice, and ladled some of the sauce over the chicken and rice.  My 9 year old twins scarfed it down.  Will definitely make again!

OK. I've tried this recipe several times. It really is good. I have several Filipino friends who marinate the chicken for several hours before cooking so I do that. Tonight I made a large batch.I don't know if it is because of increasing the ingredients but it was coming out very strong with all the vinegar and soy sauce. I decided to try adding some coconut milk as mentioned in a earlier review. Yum. I happen to love Thai so adding the coconut milk took this recipe to a completely different level.I tripled the recipe so I added a whole can of coconut milk. Amazing.

Was in a hurry and had frozen thighs so followed recipe to the letter except I made it in my electric pressure cooker and cooked it for 60 minuted on 80 pressure with some chopped onion and 1/3C brown sugar.  Was a hit with the kiddos and the hubby.

I used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of the vinegar. I love the tanginess. I also added potatoes and carrots for sweetness.

This recipe is pretty good base because it has the perfect measurements for the soy sauce and vinegar. I just don't cook the chicken first. I do saute the onions and garlic with cooking spray and then add the chicken without skin and then add then add the soy sauce, vinegar and water and season with black pepper. No need for add'l garlic powder because the soy sauce is enough for my taste.

This was pretty spicy, and we like spicy.  I would have enjoyed it more had it been toned down a bit, but that is just personal opinion.  I used chicken tenders.

2 Things, you don't need onion with the garlic, and you left out the fresh (sliced into thin pieces) Ginger Root.
Also take out Bay leaf and strain broth of Ginger before adding to Chicken and rice.
Other than that very good.

Great hit at our house! I didn't have a whole chicken so I cut up 4 chicken breasts, used 5 minced garlic cloves, 1/4 large onion sliced, a little less than 2/3 cup soy sauce (because I did not have low-sodium) and added chicken broth to dilute the soy sauce and to make more of a sauce and I served it over white rice. My husband loved it, it's' his favorite thing that I make!

I used lite soy sauce, but it came out too salty for my tastes, and I really like salty things, so long as they're not overly salty. I think the balance could have been better. I tried to correct this by adding sugar, and that kind-of helped, but the salty flavor was too much really. Even my guests who tasted it thought it was too salty, no one really even wanted any. I understand a lot of people really don't mind salty soy saucy asian foods, but I really do. I don't like that. I'm going to attempt this again, but this time I'm going to put more onion and garlic and less soy. I'm going to add water too. The vinegar was nice. Also, I used boneless thighs, so in the end the meat shredded apart, I will use full thighs with bones next time. I think this would be good if the balance can be found. I would have liked it to be less salty and more tangy. I suggest you make up the vinegar/water/soy liquid and taste it before adding it to the pot, to make sure it tastes good before it's too late. Also would have been better with some lime or lemon added I think. Cracked Peppercorns are better than regular pepper too. Good luck, don't make the mistake of doing this recipe without first tasting the sauce first.

This was good, but a little heavy onn the pepper. i think I will reduce it a little next time. My Filippina sister in law makes her adobo without vinegar and reduces the sauce until it is quite thick and sticky (we actually call it sticky chicken). This caramelization makes it quite sweet without having to add any sugar.  Serve this with chopped tomato, onion and soy sauce as a salad. Yum!

Hard to tell why this dish is so good, but it is! Used equal parts red wine vinegar, water and soy sauce, and about 6 cloves garlic plus 1 tsp garlic powder.

When I first sampled this while I was cooking, I thought it was good; but after sitting down to eat it the pepper just became overpowering. Surprisingly I did not have a problem with the vinegar or soy sauce even though I used lite version. Deciding whether I should make again w/modifications recommended by others. My husband politely told me to remove it from the (remake) list, while my picky 5 y.o. actually liked it.

I minced so many garlic cloves, I did not use the garlic powder (seemed redundant).  I added 1 tsp of sugar, like other reviewers suggested.  Worked out great!

This was very good.   I put in a few generous grinds of freshly cracked pepper then also added 1/4 tablespoon whole peppercorns because I've been told that it's traditional.  I misread the recipe and put even amounts of vinegar and soy and it was fine, although I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar to balance the acid.   I've noticed that some chicken adobo recipes call for straining the reduced liquid before dressing the chicken and rice with it, but why discard all that yummy garlic and onion?  This is not a spicy dish but I wonder what it would taste like with some heat...

It was a great easy recipe, but the pepper was a little too much for us.  I'm going to cut it down to 1 teaspoon next time I make this.  Also, my son wanted more sauce, so I will probably double the sauce ingredients next time as well.

I loved this recipe!  Couldn't believe how simple it was to make.  I thought it might be too spicy with so much pepper and garlic--but was tasty-not hot at all!  Husband and granddaughter loved it also! I made it with thighs because that was what I had on hand.  (I skinned them)

Very similar ot the way my Philippino wife makes it.  I still prefer her method though which uses 1-2 TBS whole peppercorns that are cracked and she throws in a hot banana pepper or two to give it a little bit of a hot kick along with the spice.  As for the onion and fat debates, I prefer having them in there to accent the flavor and add richness to the dish.  But I give it a 4 star at written. Pretty good.

I have never made this before myself, but my husband loves it when his aunt use to make it for him. And let me tell you for a first time make, he was very happy! i didnt have the bay leaf and instead of using regular vinegar i used apple cidar vinegar instead and i think it gave it more flavor. Oh and i used chicken wings which i found out the hard way is better to have "party" wings if your going to use wings..

This is the best adobo ever!  I have Philipino friends who have shared their recipe and I haven't found a better one than this one.  I always double it because it is great as leftovers.  I use all dark meat chicken as it is the juicest and it doesn't matter if it is bone-in or boneless, it's always terrific.

Followed directions exactly and it came out WAY too salty. Think next time I would add more water to dilute it, or broth or something.

This was delicious at first, but after a while the flavor was kind of overwhelming. I really liked it though. If you love soy sauce, then you will love this recipe.

I've made this many,many times.. it's a family favorite. I add a couple of spoons of honey to it and use red wine vinegar instead of white. Also I like the onion so I add an extra onion and I use low sodium soy sauce. Thanks allot for the recipe! It's awesome!!

definitely a keeper! I made this dish using skin-on chicken thighs and used readers' suggestions - used fresh garlic cloves, eliminated the pepper, added 2 bay leaves, substituted red wine vinegar for white, and added couple teaspoons of sugar to taste.  I also added carrots and extra onions. I made a double batch and served it for company. They loved it! I simmered it for an hour over the stovetop, and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender.  Great taste and easy to prepare. I'm making it again this week!

I've been making Chicken Adobo for years and this is, by far, the best Adobo recipe ever!!  The only change that I made was omitting the garlic powder since it already called for the cloves in the recipe.  I used more garlic cloves than what was called for.

This is an excellent recipe! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 cup water, 1 cup soy sauce, and I changed the vinegar to apple cider vinegar or red wine vinegar, depending on my mood. I also add some Splenda towards the end to counter the sourness. I use full skin-on, bone-in thighs and drumsticks and they get SO juicy and yummy! Serve it over brown rice and YUM!

Really good. A little salty for my taste, but I did add 1c chicken broth so it might have been my fault. I will add water next time to keep the sauce thin while the chicken cooks. I also added about 1 Tbsp brown sugar, it gave it a nice contrast. Don't skimp on the onions! Next time I'll probably double the onions, my husband (not an onion addict) was eating them out of the pan! Certainly one to try again.

I have been a fan of this recipe for years and was excited to read all the reviews for chicken adobo. I was not disappointed. I am not the best cook in the world, but you couldn't tell by the way my family ate it up.  The was none left.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used little party wings, easier for 2 and 4 year olds to manage. This is definitely a keeper!!!

This is a very easy dish. You don't even really have to brown the chicken if you don't want to. It just looks better with a little browning the taste is the same either way. I used a package of chicken pieces with bones. I used 10 garlic cloves smashed, chopped potatoes, and all the rest of the ingredients in the pot all at once. Then cook as the recipe states. It is even better the next day. My husband who has never had this before loved it!

I marinated approximately 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs for about 6 hours in the followIng:  1/2 cup each red wine vinegar and soy sauce, 1 cup water, 3 bay leaves, about 1 tablespoon brown sugar, a pinch of chilli flakes, generous fresh ground black peppercorns, about 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, and 3 sliced garlic cloves.  Served with sliced scallions and chopped cilantro over rice.  i did add a little chicken stock before simmering cooked chicken with marinade. Was pleased with the result.

Recipe doesn't state how long to brown the chicken for.. I ended up browning it until it was cooked on both sides, and the chicken came out to be very dry.

I liked the dish the only change I made was added a tbsp of white sugar (I didn't have brown). I will make this dish again, however, I will take the other users advice and marinate the meat for about 24 hours. I also wouldn't brown the meat first. And I would cook the dish in the slow cooker.

I followed the recipe to the T. I was a little nervous about the pepper because it seemed like too much but I figured I'd try it and decrease it next time if it was too spicy for us. It was amazing! Thank you so much for the recipe. My son ate 2 helpings and said it was his favorite chicken dish!

This came out grrrrreat! My fiancé loved it so much he was upset that i didnt make a ton of it.
I followed the recipe but I only did 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 of soy sauce, and a lil less garlic powder. I also put a 1/2 tsp of honey.  I think next time i'll only use 1.5 tsp of pepper too.
It was sooooooo good. Thank you to all reviewers for all the tips the left on this recipe!

Excellent! I have made a lot of adobo chicken recipes and this one ranks up there. It really can't be much easier than this and you can use any type of bone-in chicken. I used only 2 chicken leg quarters and did not change the amounts of any of the sauce ingredients and thought the amount of sauce was perfect. If cooking 4 chicken pieces, I would double the sauce and onions, because I like a good amount of sauce over my rice and whatever veggie I am serving. Thanks for sharing angelaBBf!

Was very disappointed!  Vinegar was way too much and also very salty - even with low sodium soy sauce.

Used boneless chicken breasts & added a touch of olive oil. Really tasty & tender. Easy to make. Next time I may try apple cider vinegar & a little less soy  sauce.

I make this in the Instant pot,  my picky grandson usually has two servings.  IP 8 minutes, quick release.  We do use 1/4  cup of sugar,  and a bay leave, since the recipe I use call for them.

Delicious needed to add sugar to balance the salty flavor.  Used low sodium soy sauce still salty but the sugar helped.

simmered on high to let it reduce, then added chicken stock.  It helps lower the soy sauce and vinegar taste.  I also substitute apple vinegar instead of white vinegar.  You can even add a half a jalapeno if you like it spicy.  Tastes great!

My mother-in-law, who is very picky, loves this recipe. I use coconut amigos and 1 tsp pepper.  We like the vinegar flavor and that it is sugar free. Very simple to make with things that I always have around so it is a great go to recipe when I need a quick supper.

ummm yummm!! I added sliced bell peppers to the onion and garlic combo. This was such a good recipe. Served with a side of rice and bok choy!! The vinegar and water measurements worked out perfectly. After it boiled i let it simmer , with the top on for an hour. Soooooo good!!

I have made chicken adobo before and couldn't find that recipe; this one looks very close except that I use boneless breast and  then cut it up. I think it was okay, but the problem is that one tablespoon of pepper is WAY too much pepper. About all I could taste was the pepper. My husband and son said it was fine, but the next time I make this, I am cutting the pepper in half.

This was a very good dish. Cut up a whole bird and browned with olive oil. Then sautéed 2 sweet onions with entire head of fresh chopped garlic. Mixed 1/2 c each white wine vinegar, reg soy sauce and  and coconut milk (and table spoon of sambal oelek as I like it spicy) into sauté pan and brought to boil. Place chicken in glass roasting pan and baked ~ 25 mon on 360. Liquid almost covered chicken. At the end, broiled on high for less than 5 min. I only wish I would of used a little flour to thicken sauce but it still tasted great. Served with rice and green beans!

This was very good. I took what another reviewer said and used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce, 1 cup water, and a bit of ginger. My only complaint (preference wise) is it was way too spicy for us. Next time I'll use 1/2 tsp black pepper. Otherwise we liked it a lot

I followed the recipe exactly and, unfortunately, it came out way too 'spicy' because of the black pepper. My husband couldn't even finish his plate. I would cut the black pepper by at least half next time.

I've been trying to make adobo for a while finally came across this recipe and it turned out amazing. I tweeked it a little bit to my liking. 
I used 1/3 C (Duta pum) vinegar and 1/2C (kikoman) soy sauce. After the chicken has fully cooked I took it out of the pot and reduced the sauce till it thicken. I added extra garlic and a dash of (Aji Ni moto) "MSG" for extra garlicy umami goodness. I seasoned it a 2nd time with freshly cracked peppercorns and turned off the heat. 
My family dont like adobo, they licked the pot clean and wanted more. This has been added to my favorite dish menu.

Only change I made was to cut the black pepper and garlic powder down by half.  Too lazy to break down a whole chicken so I used 1/2  boneless, skinless breasts and 1/2 skin on, bone-in thighs.  We all really liked it and was easy to make.  Will make again.

I made this today it's really close to what my step-mom used to make in Philippines, probably would have been exact had I used bay leaves.  Still good and will make it again but with less soy sauce since I did use what I had on hand (regular not light soy), a little salty.  We used to just put everything in the pot and cook until chicken was tender, skipping the browning step.  Also for another flavor boost my grandmother used to remove the chicken ( or whatever protein) from the sauce once cooked and pan fry it, man was that good with a bowl of rice and some sauce on top.

Delish!  Easy and quick for a weeknight.  Highly recommend.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used chicken thighs because they were on hand. A keeper for sure

Wow. This was SOOOO good. We all loved it, even picky teenage son who ate it down to the bone for the first time ever. I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar as suggested by others and did not bother measuring the garlic powder but most likely put in less than the recipe calls for.

This is a good adobo recipe that is easy and simple. I also tried adding a little white sugar and it was tasty also that way too.

Truly has good flavor, but definitely too salty.   I added additional sugar to offset the salt and a dundicutt pepper to add some spice.  I will definitely make it again.

Oh yes I made this dish! I will make it more often to say the least!  My husband is Filipino and was sick so I made it for him. Great to restore his spirit! He did say that it should be a little sweeter but, I'll work on that!

This chicken adobo didn't taste authentic but I gave it 4 stars because the sauce is a really great stirfry sauce. Mix cooked white rice with whatever veggies you have, broccoli, spinach, whatever and add some olive oil and some of this sauce. Don't have to use the whole thing so you control the amount of sodium you put it. But it was awesome and we had it two nights in a row as stirfry(without any chicken). My husband told me to keep the recipe.  Tofu or fried egg can be thrown into the mix, too.

This was pretty good. Next time, I would replace some of the soy sauce with water.  A little salty.  I also added ginger for my own twist.

OH.my.goodness. First time making adobo EVER and it tastes alot like my mom's. I just kept the chicken in the pot instead of removing it.  I may have put more garlic and garlic powder[spilled over], used 2 tsp of pepper and used around 1/3cup less [eyeball] of soy sauce. My reasons were that I could always add more, but it still turned out AMAZING. Thank you for this recipe.

I added three tablespoons of brown sugar into the soy sauce, and used crushed garlic instead of powdered garlic. It was awesome.

I am on an Adobo kick right now and this is great. I took the suggestion of a user and marinated the chicken in the soy and vinegar over night. So much flavor, and so easy to do. I also have used this recipe for tilapia and THAT is amazing too.

This is great, only changes: use  Filipino vinegar, and leave chicken in pan after browning it, just add the other stuff.  Make sure to add enough water to almost cover it for the simmer phase.  And don't rush it.

One person recamended using red wine vinegar 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce. Garlic, 2 bay leaves and I added 1 onion. Off of other recamendations, I also added a bit of ginger and at the end I felt it needed brown sugar. It was "okay". I am quite sure I would not have like the original recipe after making these changes. Not my thing.

I've cooked chicken adobo atleast 3 dozen times. Some with recipes I've found on this site and other times with my own recipe..
This is, IMO, the perfect and simplest recipe I've come  across. The vinegar and soy sauce ratio is perfect.
 I've found that the balance between the two if you're off by a tablespoon can throw the flavor completely off. 
Follow the directions to a tee and you will have yourself a perfect chicken adobo dish. 
My lettuce only eating girlfriend had a bowl and was blown away.

Loved it! I substituted white vinegar for rice vinegar to cut some of the tang. My friend who makes this suggested adding  12 oz of  7-up which also cuts through the acidity of vinegar. It also gives extra juice. Turned out so good

My family really enjoyed this dish. The only change I made was instead of white vinegar and the suggested brown sugar by other reviews, I used organic apple cider vinegar and reduced sodium soy sauce, 1/2 and 1/2. Oven Steamed rice, pour on chicken and topped it off with Rice seasoning. Delish!

This is a pretty good recipe and it has been a while since I found one online that includes vinegar! (I haven't had the need to look up this recipe online as I've been making this since I was a kid.) Try adding potatoes! It absorbs all the flavors and all of its wonderful goodness explodes in your mouth in one bite! Yum! 
*Side note: I was born in the US so I can't really say what's "authentic" and what's not...but from what I learned from my mom, who's from Manilla, and my dad, who's from Sto. Tomas, each region has their own way of making it. I don't think there's a wrong or right, authentic or not. It's all a matter of preference...until it gets mass produced and Panda Express makes a Filipino version. That would suck. Lol.

Easy enough to make, but it needs a bit of tweaking. The taste of soy sauce and vinegar are overpowering even after adding the 5 tablespoons of brown sugar suggested by other reviews. I used chicken breast cut into tenders and cut the time down to 30 minutes. They came out very tender and flavorfull, just not an enjoyable flavor. If I try again I will cut the soy sauce down and see if that helps, not sure what else to do.

I mixed all the ingreadients in a large bowl and marinated the (skinless) chicken for several hours first.  I also upped the liquids by double as I like to thicken the sauce later, making a rich gravy. After the chicken has marinated I put it dry - flash fry it in oil (to brown it) then add back all the liquids and cook as normal. Additionally I add 3-4 Tablespoons of whole green peppercorns.  So delicious.

This is a little different than the way my lola used to make it but it was still good. It was a little salty even with the low sodium soy sauce as some reviews have stated. I just added a little more vinegar to it and it was good. All in all a good dish :) If you don't like it as tangy my lola would add a can of sprite to sweeten it up much better than sugar in my opinion lol

Yum...this dish makes me so happy, feels like I'm eating my mom's homecooking.  I just added equal parts (1/4c each) of low sodium soy sauce, white vinegar, and water to the browned chicken/onion/garlic. SO GOOD!!!  Will definitely add this to the regular dish list!!!

I used this recipe for my niece's potluck for work and it was a HIT!  I followed the recipe and just added hard boiled eggs and thicken the sauce a little wit cornstarch because thats how my dad cooks his adobo.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

This was absolutely delicious! I have never had or heard of Adobo chicken, and when I saw vinegar and soy I was kind of worried. I followed it exactly as written, over white rice, and my boyfriend and I just loved it!! Will be making this again for sure!

This was wonderful!  It seemed easy enough...I even used precooked chicken (normally not all that tasty...) in order to save time and it was still delicious!  Follow the recipe exactly and it turns out wonderfully!

I tried this recipe because I only had chicken legs in the freezer and had no idea what to do with them. This recipe did not dissappoint!!! Not being familiar with Filipino adobo, I didn't know what to expect but the flavor was full, robust, and delightful! It was really easy to make, which is important for a beginner like me! I would definitely make this again. Based on some of the reviews, I did make a few changes: I used 1c each of vinegar, soy sauce and water so that I would have more liquid to create more of a stew. I also used 2 bay leaves. It was delicious!

I LOVE chicken adobo! This is pretty much the exact recipe my MIL makes. The only difference in the way she makes her adobo is that she uses whole peppercorns. This does have a unique taste but I don't think you have to have an aquired taste for this to enjoy it. The first time I tried chicken adobo, I was in love.  For as good as it taste, it's not too heavy on the calories, which is a plus for me.

Excellent recipe!  Added more garlic (we like garlic) and @ 1 T of brown sugar (to make more of a teriyaki twist), omitted the pepper (add it at the table if you want it!) and used only 1/3 cup of regular soy sauce because I didn't have any lite.  I just needed a basic recipe to get me started.  After living in the Philipines, this made the cut!  Thanks angelaBBf

This was so good.  It reminded me of living in Guam when I was a child.  I browned the chicken first in a deep dutch oven, then removed the chicken and sauteed onions, minced shallots, and garlic (4 large cloves).  The serious browning made it delicious.  I also included fish sauce (1 1/2 tbsp) and some honey to make it sweet.  Then I served it with persimmon and cilantro and green onion.

Really like this recipe, used a whole chicken that I cut up and removed skin.  Turned out really good, although think I should have simmered for longer, next time might let simmer for an hour or so.

My husband is a picky eater - and he loved this dish! He actually "offered" to eat the leftovers for lunch.

Simple ingrediants.  Deglaze the pan with a liquid of choice with the onions & garlic for softening after browning the chicken. Less black pepper, add to taste. Add frozen or fresh veggies. Very good. Thanks.

This is absolute perfection!   I only made one change, & that was because I didnt have the vinegar called for in the recipe.  I added garlic wine vinegar & it was great.  Even my kids love it & ask for it about once a week.

This recipe didn't taste "famous" at all. It was a mediocre stir-fry recipe. I used all white meat. Maybe that was part of the problem but the sauce wasn't particularly good. I added a tsp. sugar as suggested by a reviewer. The vinegar taste was a bit strong for me, and I usually like vinegar flavor. It wasn't a bad-tasting dish but I wouldn't make it again. I would rather stick to my usual stir-fry recipes.

I've made this twice now and it's absolutly wonderful! So much flavor. I make it just as is, besides adding about a tablespoon of sugar. Serve over white rice.

When I make this again for my family, I will cut the pepper in half and use just over half of the soy sauce, adding water to equal the 2/3 cup. My kids really love this dish!

WOW WOW WOW! I was a little skeptical about th recipe at first. But I must say that I am so glad this turned out amazing! The flavor is just right...not too much of anything! JUST AMAZING! The only differences that I made was that I added about a 3/4 teaspoon of sugar, i added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch (to thicken the sauce), and instead of browning the meat prior to seasoning, I just seasoned the meat and let it marinade for about half an hour and just cooked it! Again...nothing but AMAZING!

The only thing I did differently was use apple cider vinegar. I didnt' think it would be so vinegary if I used that instead of the white vinegar. And it came out delicious and tender. You could do this recipe in the slow cooker too.

Wow this was hot!!!  I might make it again but with a few alterations.  I definitely won't put a whole tablespoon of black pepper in.  And if you're not a big garlic fan, this recipe isn't for you.  My husband thought it was good but I couldn't handle the heat.

Pretty good.  Last time I made Adobo, I used my crock pot and the chicken was more tender than with this method- but this was pretty quick to prepare, so I can't complain.

This was a great meal to throw together at the last minute. I substituted half of the soy for water as suggested. I would make it again in a pinch, but this was not one of my favorite chicken dishes.

Very tasty although the vinegar is very strong smelling when cooking.  I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce and served with brown rice.  Needs some veggies though, I will try adding steamed broccoli at the end.  Will make again.

As the other recipes state I add the garlic and onions after I have started to brown the chicken, but I also add a few jalepeno peppers to give it a nice kick. Still an excellent and very easy recipe that EVERYONE loves. you can also try taken the chicken out when done and making a gravy to go over the rice and chicken..YUM

I made this for dinner but we found the lack of main ingredients other than chicken a bit lacking. The next day however we used the leftovers for wraps just adding rice, lettuce and tomatoes and it was DELICIOUS!!

I don't know, I wasn't crazy about this.  Mine turned out pretty salty (and I used the low-sodium soy sauce, too) and I felt like it didn't have much flavor, even with the garlic and pepper.  Just seemed like it needed something else, although I don't know what.  Turned out well enough that I will eat the leftovers, but I won't make it again.
