I LOVE these!  I substituted Coconut Sugar for Brown sugar, Seed butter for Peanut butter, and Flax seeds for sunflower seeds.  I have made plenty of granola bars for the kids; these are by far their favourite!

Fantastic! Now, this is the part where I say I love the recipe but radically changed it...I added an egg (instead of protein powder), dark chocolate chips (instead of chocolate bar), honey (instead of brown sugar), butterscotch chips, raisins, a cup of shredded carrot and flax seed meal. Baked for about 20 minutes. They are a little crumbly -- but delicious. I've eaten 7 little bars already. You know, to test them.

They're actually in the oven crisping now. We added chia and flax seeds, broken up banana chips, craisins, honey rather than maple syrup, subbed one cup granola to the oatmeal, and added a dash of nutmeg. I didn't use the chocolate or protein powder. They were pretty thick, I cut one and it pretty much fell apart but the kids loved the taste. They definitely want more of these!

These taste so much better than store-bought protein bars (no fake taste) and are super easy. I skipped the brown sugar and chocolate and used butter instead of coconut oil. I hand-calculated and that puts 16 bars at 210 calories each, less fat than the original, and 15 gr protein (using the vanilla soy protein powder from Trader Joe's.) They also are MUCH cheaper (under 50 cents each) from regular protein bars.

We did not really like this. But I'm still giving it a 3star simply because I think this recipe has merit, and I can understand why others loved it. The downside of this recipe for me was the protein powder... I could taste it at every bite and I absolutely hate the taste of protein powder. This is a good recipe for those who are used to this type of low sugar snack. But we like the good ol'fashioned homemade granola bars.... a little bit healthy but also a little bit not.

Yum.. made these per recipe. Great tasting. I did crisp them up a bit after the initial baking.. they would have been very soft without it.

I donâ€™t like sweet bars so I omitted all the brown sugar, and used agave syrup in place of the maple syrup. These turned out great. I baked them for the minimum time as I like them softer rather than crispy. They held together well and kept well. Next time I will add more coconut

This is a great recipe, one that allows you to add extra nuts, etc., if you wish.   I didn't have any protein powder so I substituted some milled flax and about a 1/4 cup flour.   I also added an egg as someone suggested.   I also cut them and baked them again as the editor's note suggests.   I will definitely make them again.

My hubby loved these!   I used regular chocolate chips and my vanilla protien + daily veggie powerd ~ Which turn the bars greenish.

I thought they were more "Good" than "Great" they were a pain to mix by hand. Break out a stand mixer. Not made for a hand held. I baked mine 5minutes more, to get a crisper top. They are quite dense.

These "protein bars" are delicious!  I've made them twice -- one with chocolate chunks, and one with dried currants, and they were both pretty tasty.  I didn't put the protein powder in the mix, but I did use high-protein plain Greek yogurt (Fage brand).  I also baked the bars for 30 to 40 minutes, mainly because they didn't seem "cooked" after 15 minutes.  They crumbled to the touch when trying to eat them warm, so it helped to let them cool completely before cutting and storing them.  They hold up well for a week if stored in an airtight container -- but they didn't last that long around my place.  Yummy and very filling!  I'll definitely keep making them.
