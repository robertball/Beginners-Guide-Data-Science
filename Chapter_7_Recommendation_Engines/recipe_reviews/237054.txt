Have been making quesadillas with these fillings for quite awhile but I LOVE your idea of buttering the grill sides of the tortillas and adding crushed tortilla chips! Am giving this recipe a four star but only because it's much more complicated than need be. You can simply place all the internal ingredients on one entire tortilla, top with the other tortilla (butter side up) then when time to turn just slide on to the plate you already planned to slice the quesadillas on, turn the skillet upside down over the plate and flip the plate and pan over to slide it back in the skillet and continue cooking the other side. Oh, and using sliced jalapenos from a jar saves the step of broiling the fresh jalapenos should you like to choose ;-)

This was delicious.  I used two whole tortillas stacked on top of each other and cooked it on a baking sheet at 425 for about 7 minutes per side and it was perfectly browned and melty.  Added salsa and sliced avocado on top - the whole roasted jalapenos are quite spicy with the membranes and seeds left in, but so worth the extra effort of roasting and peeling.  Had leftover wedge the next morning with a fried egg on top and more salsa.  I almost think I prefer the breakfast version!

I didn't make any changes and the recipe was wonderful.  However I bought some jalapeno peppers from the fresh market near our home and they were the hottest jalapenos I have ever eaten.  I love them because when removing the membranes and seeds they are always great on flavor and kick.  But these were so hot the quesadillas were too hot to eat and burned your mouth, lips, and throat for 20 minutes after.  Now, I'm not a sissy when it comes to hot stuff.   We use Siracha on almost everything.  But, these were hotter than habaneros or any other chili I have ever used.  I will try the recipe again and I know the heat of the peppers has nothing to do with the recipe;  I just wanted to share our hot pepper experience.  Thank you for the recipe.  Debbie

These were just okay for me, although I love the idea.  I doubled all of the other ingredients but used three tortillas. Even then I felt that the cream cheese was barely enough to cover. I might try again with some modifications.  I think I expected ooey-gooey and you just don't get that with one tablespoon cream cheese and one-fourth cup shredded cheese on one ten-inch tortilla.

My husband is now officially OBSESSED with these. He asks for them at least once a week. And they are so fast!  The usual changes I make are that I use jarred pre sliced jalapenos, because it's faster and I don't have to bake any that way. And instead of using the crushed regular tortilla chips, I'll use Doritos, when and if I have them on hand. Otherwise I'll just skip that (optional) step. As a filling I've also added chicken and mushrooms, and they were delicious that way as well! Oh I've also added sliced yellow, red and orange mini bell peppers that I previously sauteed in a frying pan :) The options are endless!!

I absolutely loved these and so did my husband, we have found that as you age you lose some of your taste buds and spicier foods are often a welcome treat.  These aren't too spicy that they burn the roof of your mouth, just right!  After making the first small recipe to sample and after reading the reviews, next time I make them I will broil a big batch of jalapeno peppers, skin them and dry freeze till needed  for appitisers especially for outdoor dinner parties.  I loved the idea that someone offered about using these for breakfast with an egg or two, all the more reason to freeze dry a big batch of jalape√±o peppers and just grab a handful as needed.

Made these as an appetizer tonight for a clam bake.  Made the recipe for 10.  Cooked them on my le creuset grill pan.  Learned a few things: I started with whole wheat tortilla and a non stick pan, but it didn't work well.  Switched to flour tortilla and the grill pan and it worked brilliantly.  Because of the size of my grill pan, Deeli's suggestion of using two stacked tortillas instead of one folded one did not work quite as well. I split the jalapenos and scraped out the seeds and membrane with my fingertip.   I had a little eczema or something between a couple of my fingers on both hands.  And then they started burning.... burning.... burning.....  I tried a few tricks and they worked - in this order:  washed hands with oil-dissolving dish detergent - that didn't work too well, then I did a thick paste of water and baking soda which I left on to let dry - may be a bit better.  Then I rubbed a tablespoon of olive oil between my fingers for about 3 minutes - this really seemed to do the trick.  I know, it was stupid - next time, I'm heeding the warning  and wearing gloves.   

This is a great recipe easily tailored to individual tastes.

I varied the recipe a bit. Instead of covering the outside with butter, I used mayonnaise (NOT the light variety or Miracle Whip). I use mayonnaise on my grilled cheese sandwiches, too. They come out so much crisper. I also did not use the tortilla chips. And instead of cooking on a stovetop, I put them in the oven for 10 minutes @ 400. I did not need to flip them as the mayo does a wonderful job of "frying" both sides. I did put them on the stick-free aluminum foil because of the cheese. They were crunchy, creamy and DELICIOUS. Easy to make and the filling could be changed up to add chicken or beef.

I made these however I found that the cream cheese made the quesadilla too rich.  Next time I will omit the cream cheese and only use the Mexican blend cheddar.

I made these and they were great. All I had was a jar of hot pickled jalape√±o peppers that I diced and didn't have any tortilla chips. I also used whole wheat tortillas. I will make these over and over. Super simple!

I absolutely love this recipe.  Super simple and you can adapt it very easily.  I was eating for one, so I used 4 small fajita tortillas and about 4 jalapenos.  My oven only has a high or low broiler setting, I did high and nearly scorched my peppers.  Next time I'll probably do low for a bit longer time.  Everything else was as is and it was great!  Leftovers were even yummy.  Just nuked for about 30 seconds.

Very yummy! The jalape√±os didn't take as long as the directions noted, but I had the broiler on high. Then I just put them in a glass container with a lid to steam. I also added BACON and green onions. Delicious!!

Delicious!  All the goodness of jalapeno poppers in a quesadilla.  I stuck to the recipe to a T, and don't see a need to alter it.  The recipe called for 10 inch tortillas, and I think the ones i used were a little smaller (for soft tacos/fajitas according to the package label).  I saw other reviews that there wasn't enough filling for 10 in tortillas.  There was plenty for the tortillas I used.  Broiling the jalapenos and steaming them to remove the skin is a bit time consuming (I didn't mind), but there are quicker ways to make this recipe I saw in some of the other reviews.

These were really good. The more cream cheese you use the hotter the flavor. We made some just as the recipe said and some with some ground beef and taco seasoning. It was delicious both ways.

These were okay.  I didn‚Äôt measure anything, just spread cream cheese to desired thickness and added however much shredded cheese I wanted.  Even seeded, these were pretty spicy.  I wouldn‚Äôt make these again, just not enough WOW factor for the time it took to broil and steam the peppers.  I couldn‚Äôt taste or even tell that tortilla chips were in them, either.  I‚Äôd suggest adding some cumin or other Mexican spices to make them a little more interesting.

These came out excellent! I assembled by topping one tortilla with the ingredients and added the second tortilla. I admit I wasn't paying attention where it mentioned folding! I used sweet and hot jarred jalapenos (time saver, too) and used a paper towel to squeeze out excess moisture. I took the suggestions from others, and they worked great! Along with the jalapenos, I added chopped rotisserie chicken and roasted sweet peppers (had both on hand). I added extra cream cheese as I saw some mentioned there was not enough. I did have to cook several minutes longer per side. I cut into four wedges with a pizza cutter. I like the idea of having with an egg as was mentioned. Good idea for the leftovers! Thanks for this great and versatile recipe!

I live in Mexico & cook a lot mostly Mexican, Indian & Italian. You DO NOT need to peel most peppers including Jalapenos & Serranos esp. if you are cooking them first.  I simply chop the peppers into small pieces and either add them to something already cooking or just put them inside a tortilla.  Sometimes these recipes have way too many steps & thus makes it more difficult  to try a new recipe.  If you cook vegetarian/vegan as I do and like spicy then add some of the pepper seeds.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed, minus the tortilla chips.  We LOVED it!  My husband gobbled his so fast I was amazed, and asked me to make it again soon.  My only complaint was that the jalapenos were not hot enough, but we've had trouble finding truly hot ones lately.

Solid quesadilla recipe (definitely add bacon).  I think I was expecting something outrageous and this turned out to be just "good" - I think I always expect jalapeno popper recipes to be amazing and they just turn out good.  Overall, this is a good quesadilla recipe.

From all the high reviews, I was excited to try this recipe, but disappointed with the results.  It was very bland. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used other reviewer's advice, and I baked it in the oven.  I realize jalapeno peppers vary in spice level, so won't give up on this yet.  I'll try it again, hoping for spicier peppers.  I'll also pan fry.

I normally choose recipe I'd like to make according to reviews given, that being said... my grandson loves Quesadillas so I choose this recipe to accompany my Mexican dinner. To say the least we were both disappointed. I made them exactly as directed and found them to be terribly, terribly bland.

Instead of blackening the skin off the peppers, I chopped small and sauted in a little olive oil before adding to  the cream cheese.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I just added very thin sliced cooked chicken breast.  I have an extremely picky 15 year old and he ate his entire quesadilla and even commented how good it was.  The butter on the outside of the tortilla gave it a nice buttery crisp coating that made you think you were getting served from a fine restaurant.  We dipped our quesadilla in sour cream and yum yum sauce... I will definitely be adding this recipe to the frequent dinner list.  Thanks so much!

Needed more cheese & I brush the pan with grapeseed oil & brush the top with more oil.  Was crisper and less calories.  Calories saved used more cheese. ;-)

Very good recipe!  The roasted jalapenos make this recipe great! The first time I made it per the recipe, and it was a great success. The second time I spiced it up by adding caramelized onions to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with the cooking community!
Note: Once I tried using  jarred jalapenos , they don't work in the recipe at all.

These were very tasty.  The only change that I made was that  I chopped jalapenos from a jar. Buttering the tortillas made them golden brown and slightly crunchy. I will make these again.

What a wonderful recipe! I roasted the jalapeno's, then wrapped them loosely in the foil. Did not have to peel them. Skins were so nicely blistered, that I just chopped them up a bit. Did use small jalapeno's, skin was not tough at all. The crushed chips are a fantastic idea! Will make this again and again. I did use Beecher's Flagship Reserve cheddar. An amazing cheddar.

As suggested by others, I added more of the inside ingredients - really didn't actually measure anything.  As one suggested, I added some chicken. Also had to use bottled jalipeno cuz didn't have any fresh ones. Will for sure make again. Made for a fast, easy, change of pace lunch.

My husband loved this dish! Added saut√©ed chicken breast and served with fresh guacamole and salsa. Will definitely make again.

Followed exactly as written, and it was just ok! If I make them again, I will need to give it my own spin to make them taste more like a fried popper!

It's a matter of preference. Easy to make. Good to eat, but not my favorite. There are no problems with recipe.
