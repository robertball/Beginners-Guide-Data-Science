These were a tender and yummy biscuit. Next time I will cut them and bake like a typical biscuit instead of the muffin tin though. Thanks for sharing.

I have been challenged on how to make a good biscuit from scratch and without self-rising flour. I have read many biscuits recipes in this site and searching the web and still couldn't find one that would make a decent biscuit. I decided to not give up and keep trying on the search of the correct biscuit recipe. Well finally I discovered what the problem was. If you read this recipe it doesn't call for the ingredient that will make it happen. EGGS!!!!!!!!!!! You need to put an egg into your mixture. Without the egg this will turn into a bad biscuit. Egg will bring the cohesiveness of a real biscuit. Try it and you will be see you will be much happier.

These biscuits are very good. I added a tablespoon of sugar and half a tablespoon of salt. They were perfect the first time I made them. They are simple and delicious. They rise a lot so don't roll them out too thick. The recipe made more than what it stated. I cut the recipe in half so it should only have made eight biscuits but I got 12 and I made them fairly big. I didn't put them in muffin tins I used to regular pan and buttered the bottom.

I made these, added about 1/2 a teaspoon of salt.
They have the flavor.
They just did not rise much at all.
I rated it a 4.  Just for the taste.

Delicious. Just needs to be a little saltier for my taste. Amazing, flakey, and easy to pull apart! Definitely beats biscuits in a can!

Great recipe! I did cut a half cup of butter out, you couldn’t tell. Also I baked them at 400 degrees for 15-18 minutes, they doubled in size. These are, light, buttery, and tender. We had eggs, biscuits & gravy! This is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe. I halved the recipe because I didn't need so many biscuits. These came with one problem. There was wayyyyy too much butter. Enough to make my stomach hurt after one biscuit. I'll add a half a cup of butter, at the most. Probably a third, actually. Other than that, the biscuits came out fluffy and tasted great with grape jam :)

Instead of bacon I used aged cheese scraps and added a little salt. I cut them in with the butter along with the addition of black pepper. These cheesy pepper biscuits were amazing when brushed with maple butter.

These biscuits are simple to make with ingredients that you already have! I don’t usually keep buttermilk on hand so I added 1 cup milk with 1 Tbsp lemon juice, let it sit for 5 minutes while I put together my other ingredients. This made 24 biscuits. Nice and soft/flaky on the inside and golden brown on the outside. I made biscuits and gravy with them and they were a hit! My husband thinks we should make them every week!!

Simple yet delicious! I made them without the bacon and they puffed up nicely in the oven. Nice and crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.

In the last minute, I decided to make biscuits for thanksgiving.  I have never made them, so I looked for a simple recipe and picked this one. I made it without the bacon. It came out great. I had extra dough so I made some pancakes without a muffin tin, and those came out better. I gave this recipe a 4 because the use of the muffin tin isn't the best. The ones on the cookie sheet were softer and more moist. Otherwise, great recipe.

These biscuits are moist, fluffy, and flakey.  While my family does not use much salt and enjoyed this recipe as written, other than omitting the bacon, I can understand why some reviewers chose to add salt.

This is the best biscuit I have made. I think the trick is folding over rolling out and folding over. Made the recipe as is except  no bacon. They were light and flaky.

Excellent!  These biscuits are light and flaky and so easy to make.  I added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of finely grated Balderson's 2 year old white cheddar.  Yum!! I will be making these biscuits again soon!!
