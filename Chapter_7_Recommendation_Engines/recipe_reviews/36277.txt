The first time I prepared this recipe it turned out very dry. 
I used a bit of garlic powder along with the Lemon Pepper Seasoning Blend to add a bit more flavorto the chicken, but other than the garlic powder, the reciped was followed as posted.

The second time I made this recipe, I used Marinated Artichoke Hearts and mixed the marinade with the juice of 1/2 lemon, then poured a portion over the Grilled Chicken, Pasta and Lemon Pepper Seasoning Blend. 
The added liquid or dressing made all the difference in the world ...
The results were much better, in my book, than the orginal posted recipe.

Nice dish, though I did make some big additions. First, I made up a creamy dressing with a combination of Mayo, Italian Dressing, a little lemon juice, and lots of minced garlic. I also diced up some red onion, and yellow and red bell peppers. I also added some celery for a nice crunch, and a little green onion. This made for a really nice refreshing salad. Perfect for a hot summer time dinner, when something heavy just won't do! :)

I searched the grocery store everywhere and could not find the Mccormick's Lemon pepper seasoning blend. I substituted Laury's lemon pepper marinade and this did not suffice. It was rather flavorless.
