I liked this. I was taking this to a church potluck so I baked into mini muffins so it would be less mess and easier to handle. This recipe is not sweet. not at all. I personally liked it but I thought it would go over better with a little orange glaze on top. That added a little more sweetness . I liked the texture with the cornmeal  but I think some nuts would be awesome in this
