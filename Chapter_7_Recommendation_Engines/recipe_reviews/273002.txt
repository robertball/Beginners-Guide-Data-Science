fantastic! my first time  making macarons and they were relish and perfect tasting. I need to work on my piping technique because some were not perfectly round, but otherwise very tasty. I also waited the 24 hours to taste, it truly does make a difference.

I added 1 1/2 t. of baking powder, 1 more egg white, 1/3 C. of flour more. They turned out perfect. They were crisp on the outside and cake like inside. made 25 cookies.

Video/recipe easy to follow and gave confidence to try it out. I don't know what went wrong...I wacked the pants, turned the oven down to 280 when I saw a hint of browning, followed directions EXACTLY. So sad...
