I have never eaten a brussel sprout before at 31 years old.  I tried this out because I already had all the ingredients.  It was quick and easy and I even used frozen ones.  Good recipe, it made it to the recipe box.

This was good. A good recipe to us up Brussels sprouts as an Asian side.

I cut the recipe in half, using semi-frozen sprouts.  Added 1/2 package plain Stir-fry noodles w/out seasoning.  Very tasty dish.

Easy, quick and quite tasty! Iâ€™ll be making this again. Over rice or egg noodles.

Fine, not stellar
Sauce was good, but honestly, we like the taste of Brussels Sprouts, and the sauce drowned it out a bit

I made it, it was so good. Next time though I'm adding either pork or chicken and white rice. then it'll be even better.
