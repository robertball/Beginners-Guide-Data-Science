This was really good.  I wasn't sure about it because its so simple, but the sweet onions are the key.  We loved it.  No changes necessary.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

This one did not turn out for me.  I followed the recipe, using Duke's mayonnaise, a vidalia onion, and mild cheddar cheese - baked for 17 minutes.  Brought it out and let it cool for about 10 minutes. It was greasy and the onion and cheese separated.

Very surprisingly great, especially given simplicity and that we just happened to have those 3 ingredients.  Used sharp cheddar.  Great with veggies

Yes, but I would use 1 cup each and sprinkle a bit of Paprika on top before baking.

Made this dip yesterday for an outdoor party and it held up nicely as long as it lasted.  Everyone loved it and rquested recipe.  I was very pleased and will make it over and over, considering how quick and easy it is.
