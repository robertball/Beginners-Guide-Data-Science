I'm making this now and it looks amazing! But no idea what type or size of fish. I'm working with what I have on hand so using snapper fillets but I'm wondering if 4 is enough. That depends on the size of fish this recipe calls for..... 3 stars for that but will definitely come and update!

This hit the spot. NY was 4 degrees today and my husband works outside doing deliveries. He was definitely in need of this. He said it warmed up his soul. Added some shrimp to it and a couple of other seasonings. Added yam instead of regular potatoes and no green banana.

I didn't have all the ingredients, so my rating isn't fair. No thyme or dried pepper or lemon. Used perch. So added 1/2 lime, dashes of ole bay seasoning, cayenne, and red pepper flakes. Canned /frozen vegetables instead of fresh.
