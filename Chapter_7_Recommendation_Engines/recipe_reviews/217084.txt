OMG!  I was in a pinch because i usually buy dry peas that have a good recipe on the bag.  Well funny thing...not this time, so i looked at all the recipes for pea soup with ham bones....and WAHOOO  that Dave posted this....because this is sooo close to how i have made this off the packages over the years, i have to say this is the BEST recipe, because i love the thyme and marjoram and garlic...
i like to add carrots and sometimes diced potatoes...just to vary it up...i also use ham boullion instead of salt (to taste) cuz that is awesome.....
THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME .....WITH OR WHITHOUT THE MEAT...
do try...(i like to cook mine longer, cuz i like a thicker soup...) but this could be vegetariain easy!
Dave...excellent recipe!!!!

This soup was a delicious alternative to my mom's more basic split pea soup.  The herbs and garlic gave it great flavor.  I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted oregano.  I was also out of celery, so I added chopped carrots and a chopped baking potato instead.  I'm sure it changed the flavor, but it was still quite good (and I'll try the celery another time).  I also added some extra water, but I still ended up with a hearty, satisfying soup.

We really enjoyed this soup.  Peas don't need to be soaked so I skipped that step.  It needed a bit more pepper for us & I did add carrots - but that is just personal taste. I would prefer to cook the ham bone separately and then skim the fat off the broth.   Thanks for a good recipe.

I looked at every split pea soup recipe on this site.  This one was not very highly rated, but appeared to be just what I was looking for.  Absolutely delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except added some chopped carrots for color.  My husband, who said he doesn't really care for pea soup, ate 3 bowls.

I don't know what it was exactly, but we really didn't like this and we love pea soup.  I actually threw it out.  I can only guess it was the combination of spices.  I did use a pork hock rather than a ham bone, so maybe that had an off taste.  Don't know, but it wasn't good.  Sorry.

This was our second time making this. We just love it. I add a finely chopped carrot, for a little color, when I add the celery.

I like this recipe. The soup is hearty but for me needs a bit more flavor. I did forgo the pea boiling/soaking but did make sure to put them in a colander rinsing well and picking through like you would any dried bean etc. Used a very meaty ham bone and went heavy with the S&P to taste. Decided to swap the celery for chopped carrots. Good Soup.

I really wanted to try my hand at making a Split Pea Soup and with so many yummy looking recipes I chose this one because it seemed the simplest and worked into my time frame.  With so many reviews, I am so glad the first one raved about it with not too many modifications so I read it and ran with it.  Oh my gosh, this is soup is AMAZING!!!!!  I couldn't keep telling my husband how wonderful it was and he too enjoyed it emencly.  Really over the top taste.  I added two cups of chicken broth, 2 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups of water (for 6 servings).  I used all the spices for the the adjusted servings,.  Unfortunately my ham bone didn't have a lot of meat left on the bone, but it was enough for the servings.  However I added some cooked bacon to give it some more meat. The veggies I added in the last 45 min cooking was chopped carrots, celery, a small russet potato and a small sweet potato (next time I will only use sweet potatoes as they are better for your health).  Make sure to check the texture of the potatoes as the last 45 min cooks the veggies quickly especially if they are cut bite size (which I did because I don't like big chunks of veggies or potatoes).  We complimented this soup with sourdough breach spread with butter and a glass of wine.  Perfect meal to have after decorating the Christmas tree.

This recipe is amazing. Like others I substituted broth (chicken or vegetable) for the water and added carrots. I use a mix of green and yellow peas. Also I'm a slacker and just cube a pre cooked ham steak and throw it in. I have also varied with spices and it always comes out delicious!!! Honestly I have never had a better split pea soup.

I made this with a leftover mesquite smoked ham bone with a lot of meat. It turned out fantastic. I did add carrots, fresh garlic and half of the liquid was homemade stock. It was really very good. My only issue was that some of the gristly bits came off the bone into the soup. That is kind of icky. One of the recipes I looked, at prior to choosing this one, suggested making a stock with the ham prior to cooking. That is my game plan next time. I think that should be easier to pick out the unwanted bits. Great recipe, thanks David!

Great hearty split pea soup. Only change made was I did an 8 hour cold water soak and rinse. The spices add a nice touch of savory.

My grandmother made split pea soup when I was a kid, but I refused to even try  it because of the color. . . I grew up. When  I make split pea soup, I usually wing it, but I had a ham bone this time and wanted some hints. I soaked my peas overnight  and also added carrots and potatoes.  Good, basic recipe. Keeper!

I have tried lots of pea soups and this is the best! I used yellow split peas (not green) and did not add salt - I think there is enough salt in ham.

I made this with chicken broth and mistakenly put the celery in with the onion etc. but otherwise went with the exact recipe... excellent, rave reviews. Will do this again, it was terrific with sour dough bread on a rainy afternoon...

This recipe always turns out great! The guys love it! (Especially with extra chunks of meat!) I like using fresh Thyme and fresh minced garlic. This time I didn’t include carrots, but still turned out good.

Great soup.  I added in thinly sliced celery with the onions because my husband doesn't really like them. I was able to hide them that way. I added in 1.5 cups of carrots, additional 1 cup ham, 1/2 teaspoon garlic, salt, and pepper.  (this is just preference). I think I need more salt and pepper next time.

Made this last night for me and my hubby as an appetizer before the main and we loved it.  I followed the recipe to a T, except for the celery as I didn't have any at the cottage and I didn't have garlic powder so I used garlic salt instead and omitted the salt portion. I wouldn't change a thing this was so good nothing else is needed. It was rich in flavour and body. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good soup, David!  I boiled the ham bone in water for several hours, then went from there.  Only other changes were to add some chopped carrots and about a half pound of diced ham.  Two hours was more than enough time for the peas to cook down.
