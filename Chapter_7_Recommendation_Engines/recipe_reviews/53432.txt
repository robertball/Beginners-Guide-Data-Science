This is an excellent and fast layer cake. I whipped in up in no time - and it didn't last long on the table either! The cinnamon really gives it a great taste and with cake mix as an ingredient, you can't go wrong! I used vanilla frosting instead of the chocolate as I thought it would be too much chocolate. It was scrumptious!

I had some sour cream to use up, so I decided to try this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used a box of German Chocolate cake mix and a box of chocolate cake mix because that's what I had on hand.  Instead of two-layered round cakes, I made two 9" x 13" cakes with my two boxes of cake mix.  One can of chocolate frosting was sufficient to frost both cakes.  This tasted like a good basic chocolate cake, but I didn't feel that the sour cream, cinnamon, and vanilla extract did much to enhance the flavor of the cake.  For tastier and lower fat ways to doctor up cake mixes, I recommend "Wonderful Banana Cake" and "Apple Cake III" from this website.

This was the absolute BEST chocolate cake my family and I had ever had!  The sour cream made it nice and moist, though it was very, very rich.  If you don't like richness, I would suggest using a regular chocolate cake mix instead of the devil's food cake mix.  I will definitely make this again!

I really liked this cake. I used cooled coffee from my morning joe in place of the water and it really perked up the chocolate taste. Frosted with a cream cheese frosting, which I think paired well with it. A chocolate icing would have been to much chocolate (is there such a thing?) for me.

Although very easy, this cake was delicious!  the extra ingredients did help perk up the plain cake mix.  I used fat-free sour cream to save calories, and it was still great.

Excellent recipe! For a little variation I tried adding 1 (3.5 oz) melted chili chocolate bar and 1/2 tsp of red chili powder. It gives this already delicious cake a little heat after each bite. You may need to add a little more water if the chocolate bar thickens your batter too much. Thanks for the recipe, surely a keeper.

Yum!  I was looking for something that gave the taste of Mexican Hot Chocolate in the form of a cupcake, this worked perfectly.  I made the recipe as listed and the batter made 24 cupcakes.  I topped them with betty Crocker whipped milk chocolate frosting, got rave reviews.  I will make this recipe again as cupcakes and as a layer cake.
