I was really excited to see this recipe since I have problems with gluten/dairy/eggs, too, but I was very disappointed in the result, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  The finished brownies look good on the outside and have the right kind top "crust" to them, but the inside was almost like jelly and they oozed oil.  I think there isn't enough starch in the recipe, or too much oil or too much yam.  I'I don't think I'll try this recipe again given all the changes that will have to be made.
