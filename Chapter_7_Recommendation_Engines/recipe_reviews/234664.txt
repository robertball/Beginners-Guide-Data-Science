Tried this yesterday. Very good. I had 4 med boneless, skinless chicken breasts already marinated overnight in frig. Used 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 3 teas. crushed garlic. I used 2 cans, undrained crushed tomatoes w/basil, oregano and thyme. Added 1/2 teas fresh finely chopped rosemary. 1 large sweet onion sliced. 2 hrs at low and 2 hrs at high. Came out extremely tender and tasty. Served in large bowl w/Grands biscuits. Very easy.

I used 4 very large chicken breasts - 10 to 11 oz each, and they started frozen. 4 hours at high left them just a tad dry so I think if you had more normal sized chicken and it was only refrigerator cold 4 hours would be too long, I'd start checking for doneness at about  2 1/2 hours, or cook on low if you aren't going to be available to check. I was only cooking for two so I ladled some of the juice/onion mixture into a saucepan and added enough penne for two and let it simmer until the pasta was done and shredded one of the breasts and added it to the pasta - was a yummy supper for two and I have enough leftovers to do that again, plus cooked chicken for other uses.

I had to sub thighs for the breasts and whole tomatoes for the crushed, just because that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious!  My hubby loved it and raved about how good it was.

Cooked this for dinner tonight. I used diced tomatoes, flavored with rosemary and oregano instead of crushed tomatoes. I also used 1 teaspoon of thyme by mistake. I served it over linguine noodles with a wedge salad. My husband loved it! It was simple to make. I will make this again for sure.

I did not have just canned tomatoes so I used the Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  WOW.  Great taste.  My kitchen smells delicious. There is a warmth that might not have been present if the chilies were not used, but the taste it great.  I also used chicken tenders so only cooked it for 3 hours and it was plenty of time.

Made a few changes based on what I had in the kitchen: I used balsamic vinaigrette dressing, added two teaspoon of brown sugar, and a good shake of worchestershire sauce. The result was a sauce so delicious, my daughter and I couldn't stop mopping it up with slices of rustic bread. Highly recommended, would eat every day if I could.

What I actually do is take a bottle of Ken's Light balsamic vinaigrette dressing, half a jar of course grain mustard and mix the two together.  In a pyrex baking dish,  I pour the mixture over 4 skinless / boneless chicken breasts and top the breasts with Sargento blended provolone - mozzarella mix cheese slices (I recommend the provolone slices if you can't find the blend) and bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  You can sprinkle freshly grated parmesan cheese over the breasts for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  The breasts cook to a beautiful golden color and the parm adds a great finishing flavor.  The breasts remain extremely moist and it will become a favorite with family and friends!  I serve with rice and pour the remaining sauce mixture over the rice. Broccoli also goes well as a side veggie.  YUM!!!

What a nice easy way to make chicken.  The balsamic is a great touch.  Used 1 can crushed, 1 can diced and 6 breasts.  Shredded the chicken when done and put it over brown rice.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

My picky family loved this, I will absolutely make it again. Served it over rice, might add a bit of sugar next time to cut the acid a bit.

Wasn't a huge fan. I liked how easy it was, and that I had all of the ingredients on hand. It was the texture of the chicken that I wasn't a fan of. I think I'd prefer to make this on the stove and not in the crockpot.

I halved the ingredients as my chicken breasts were small & cooked for 8 hrs on low (using frozen chicken). Turned out perfect. I used the "watery" sauce to coat the noodles & added a bit of pre-made pasta sauce with the chicken to serve. It was quite good. I would recommend this recipe to a friend. Thanks!

Didn't love this.  I think it was too much tomato for me.  I did use one can of diced and one can of crushed.  Served over spaghetti.

I love the taste! I used 5 chicken tenders instead of breasts and only one can of tomatoes, but I used tomatoes with chilies in it and added tomato paste. I had it on high it was done by 3:48 which is sooner then I needed so I have it on keep warm now. So if u choose smaller chicken expect it to only take about 2 1/2 hrs to cook. I plan on serving it over spaghetti which is what my hubby picked, but I snuck a taste & it's amazing!! :-).

I am in love with this recipe!  I just made it for the first time and just finished eating it.  What a complex taste the ingredients create!  I only made one change and that was out of necessity.  I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  The mixture of flavors was divine.  I was surprised that much of the balsamic vinegar flavor ended up in the onion.  The recipe could almost be made without the chicken.  We put ours over rice and used corn starch to thicken the juice.

Pretty good.  Yes, a tad dry even on low for 4 hours and starting with frozen chicken breasts.  Still rather tasty.  I wasn't a fan of how little the sauce covered when I put it in (although I did use canned chopped tomatoes--don't have crushed) so I added a full can of paste, some olives and mushrooms.  I think the olives jacked up the flavor--which if you like olives is a good thing.  If you don't like olives, not so much.  My husband complained it tasted like olive brine--he's not an olive fan, so I guess I have to add those just to my portion if I make this again.  I did cut down the balsamic vinegar a bit since there were complaints it was sweet.  However, I don't think it was very sweet, just tangy.  It was rather liquidy so I added about 1/2 a package of dry pasta when the chicken was cooked and mixed it in.  It was cooked and ready to serve within an hour and soaked up all of the juices.  All in all, not bad, but maybe a few more adjustments would make some people happier, and unfortunately I don't think this is a good recipe if you are away from home more than a couple of hours at a time, as it does appear to need someone to keep watch on it.  Thanks for the recipe!

4.5 stars! Moist, tangy chicken with a lovely thin gravy just perfect for noodles or rice.  I prepped this dish in my slow cooker liner the night before and refrigerated. In the a.m. I used a whole chicken instead of 4 breasts and put  some lemon halves in the cavity along with the garlic. I poured tomatoes on before turning on slow cooker. As other reviewers have noted, the tomatoes that stayed on top of the chicken retained a strong tomato flavor as opposed to mixing in with the other ingredients. Next time around I would mix tomatoes with the other ingredients and then would top with the onions. I cooked for 8 hours on low and it was perfect - very forgiving of time differences.

I cooked this for my family and thought it turned out quite nicely. I took another reviewer's advice and mixed everything together before pouring it over the chicken. I cooked split boneless breasts on low and they were done in 2-1/2 hours. It's an easy recipe to follow and everyone had high compliments for it.

This is Great!  For those of us who don't like the acidity of tomatoes, but LOVE their flavor, the secret lies NOT in sugar, but in carrots*!* If you'll put in a few handfuls of diced carrots in the bottom, then onward w/rest of recipe, you'll have delicious nonpucker power tom toms! This is what the Italians due, daily and if anyone knows tomato gravys, as they call it, THEY DO**

I also used seasoned diced tomatoes,  bit still added thyme, rosemary,  garlic, shallots, onions. The smell in my kitchen right now is AMAZING!  My chicken breast were partially frozen,  added extra olive oil to keep them moist. Family is in love with this recipe!  It's on our regular list!

I made this last night for dinner and my not-at-all-picky husband said it was "edible" but "not worth trying again." 
The only tweak I did was to cook on low, I was hoping it would not be done for a while since I had other things going on last night, but it was done in 4 hours. 
Definitely won't be trying this one again.

I made this earlier this week & it was a complete hit with my hubby! I substituted one can of diced tomatoes & one can of stewed tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes, and I added a can of tomato paste at the end to thicken the sauce. Other than that, I stayed pretty true to the recipe...although I used some combination spices that I had available instead of the specific quantities & individual spices recommended. I served it over white rice one night & yellow rice another night. This will definitely be added to our regular line-up!

We loved it. Better than expected. We only use thighs as our store had them on sale at 69c! 
Will make again for company next time!

Please do not suggest using frozen chicken in a slow cooker as you are inviting bacteria into your dish.  Defrost chicken first.

Really good. 4 hours on low for 6 thawed chicken  breasts was perfect, didn't get too tough. Sauce had great flavor. I only cut a chunk  of onion into super thin slices, used some fat free  cranberry balsamic  salad dressing that added sweetness. Served with noodles.

Not terrible, but I probably won't make this again. It turned out kind of dry and not very flavorful.

I used frozen, stewed tomatoes from my garden.  The sauce was  thin and used some of the sauce to cook riced cauliflower and served with chicken on top.  I sprinkled Parmesan/Italian bread crumbs over all.  Half  grated Parmesan cheese and half Italian bread crumbs is also my favorite breading for fish or chicken.

Sorry, did not like the flavor of this. I'm Italian, and I love Italian flavors, but this was too sweet and just not enjoyable. I like all of the ingredients, but I don't want to spend the time tweaking the recipe.

I love basic "chop-n-dump" crock pot recipes and this one is even easier in that the only chopping is the slicing of the onion.  I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes, 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato paste and the sauce came out great.  Everyone here that eats chicken loved it and the one who doesn't eat chicken had sauce over noodles and loved it.  This appears very adaptable and I might try adding diced bell pepper and/or sliced mushrooms next time.  Since the chicken is cooked under the sauce, it came out very moist and one piece was even falling apart when scooped out of the crock pot.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight - what a great dish!  It is certainly on my list to make again. I cooked two chicken breasts and used two cans of whole tomatoes  (cut up) in place of the crushed tomatoes - cooked two hours on high and two hours on low. The chicken was tender and juicy!  My husband went back for seconds!!  Vickie

This is now a favorite in our home. I did add a can of tomato paste at the end to thicken the sauce. I added this in about an hour before I served it. My family has requested I make this every week now because we also had a lot of leftovers. You can't go wrong with this recipe!!

I did not use all the rosemary and thyme that the recipe called for because my family doesn't love those spices, but I did add extra balsamic vinegar.   So I think the recipe didn't have as much flavor as it normally would.  It was okay, but my family said I didn't have to make it again.

I made this recipe this evening for my wife and friends.  It was well received and had many compliments.  I read through the reviews and decided to put my own spin on it.  I wanted a thicker sauce than what the recipe created so I added a 28 oz can of tomato sauce and 1 can of tomato paste in addition to all the ingredients listed in the recipe.  I also added a tsp of Italian seasoning and instead of dried rosemary, added a spring of fresh rosemary from our garden.  The sauce was the right consistency to spoon over penne pasta.  The chicken shredded easily after 4 hours of slow cooking.  The flavor was outstanding.  Definitely a hit and a recipe I will use again when we have company over for dinner.

I really liked this! My husband did too, and he's fairly picky. I used tomato paste instead of crushed tomatoes and added about half a cup of chicken broth (I made two boneless chicken breasts) I also sliced a tomato and placed it on top along with the onions. Cooked on low for 7 hours and turned out great. I tossed pasta in the remaining sauce

Not bad.  It isn't my favorite meal, but it was certainly easy.  I liked the additional flavor the balsamic gave the sauce.  I cooked it for about 3 hours in my slow cooker.  I paired it with whole wheat penne pasta and added some fresh spinach when eating. Only had stewed tomatoes with basil and Italian seasoning, and no salt added diced tomatoes.  No onions.  Overall, still pretty good.  I enjoyed the variety of spices.

I made this this morning. It was delicious! I enlarged the recipe in order to feed more people and to have leftovers! I believe my ratio of chicken to all the other ingredients was pretty high though. (Turned out to be more like a balsamic shredded chicken recipe). Also I had to do some substitutions due to what I had on hand. I used lots of bunching onion with some light green parts included (instead of regular onion). Used diced and stewed tomatoes instead of crushed, also I didn't have thyme so I used an Italian seasoning along with the basil and oregano. And due to the lack of onion I added 2 anehiem (garden fresh and not that hot) to bulk it up. Had it on for 8 hours but on high (I thought it was on low!) But thankfully the chicken was still moist and render enough Tk be easily shredded with a ladle...will definitely try again but with the exact ingredients as instructed. Should be even better with lots of onion!

I made this last night and it was the most rich tasting  dish exploding with flavor. The only things I changed was I did use stewed tomatoes instead of crushed, added the tomato paste, used thighs instead of breast, added some diced sweet peppers, and at the end thickened with veggie broth and cornstarch. It was AMAZING and I will definitely be making this again...

The first time I made this, I made it with canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have any crushed tomatoes on hand.  I loved it!  I tried the recipe again using crushed tomatoes, and I actually enjoyed the dish much less than I had the first time around.  So, I'll stick to the diced tomatoes.  Other than that, the recipe is a definite keeper for those of who work long days and want dinner ready when we get home.

I used frozen chicken and mixed two large breasts and 8 thighs. Used 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 2 cans diced tomatoes with basil and oregano and 3 tablespoons of Herbs de Providence, and 3 tablespoons of minced garlic from a jar. Everyone loved it. Drained the liquid from the chicken and cooked the pasta in a large skillet. Sprinkled mozzarella cheese over the top to serve. If your chicken is not frozen do not cook on high for 4 hours. Chicken will be dry. Mine turned out perfect because it was frozen.

Great flavor and the slow cooker made the chicken to perfection.  Instead of using the spices listed, I made this with curry, tumeric and cumin changing the plain balsamic to a coconut balsamic and serving with Saffron Jasmine rice.  A great meditarrean flare!  Will definitely try again with other spices.

This was delicious to have for dinner last night. I've used only one can of crushed tomatoes and it worked perfectly. I've used minced garlic instead of garlic slices and tweaked it to use 3 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar which was more than enough. I would love to make this again for sure since it was delicious.

I did 1 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and half of a red onion, along with coconut oil on the bottom instead of olive oil (all substitutions were based on things I had/didn’t have).  Still came out good!  The sauce was fairly watery but the flavor was good.

The balsamic is very prominent in the dish so you must like that flavor.  It is excellent for those who do.  I make a few changes:
1) Used boneless skinless thighs which is what I had on hand
2) Threw in broken fettucine pasta for the last hour of cooking
3) Cooked on low for longer time

Will not make again. Too much balsamic vinegar and sauce was too watery. Flavor was nothing to write home about.

Made this for the first time today, so I followed the recipe. The sauce was taste, but the chicken was way over cooked. After 3.5 hours on high the instant read thermometer showed 200+ degrees. The onions (sliced as suggested) virtually disappeared.   Next time I'll cook on low and check the temp at 3 hours. I'll slice the onions a bit thicker and I'll used diced tomatoes. The flavor of the sauce makes it worth experimenting some more.

This was pretty amazing! I put in 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can rotel tomatoes. The sauce is soupy so I removed the chicken and added 1 can of tomato paste, thickens it perfectly. Instead of the individual herbs I put in a tablespoon or so of Italian Seasoning. Put the chicken back it to reheat. I served it over spagetti noodles. The grandkids even loved it! Will definitely make again. Tastes even better the next day!

The flavor of the sauce was good, however it was very thin and liquid. The chicken was also terribly dry even with the sauce in it. It may have been better cooked on low for 4 hours. I may make the sauce again but add some tomato paste to thicken it up and cook the chicken for a shorter period of time. I liked the addition of rosemary which reminded me of some spaghetti sauce my grandmother used to make with rosemary. This was not too overpowering.

Won’t make again. It was just okay. I cooked my chicken breasts for 3-1/2 hours and they were dry. Between the  inconvenience of a shorter cooking time (which apparently should have been even shorter) and the “meh” flavor it just wasn’t a good slow cooker meal.

Well I liked it a lot. My husband didn't care for it -- he didn't like the sauce with the pasta. I will try again without the pasta and shred the chicken and serve with corn tortillas.

It was missing something. It helped to add a ton of asiago cheese on top, but I wish there were a vegetable that went really well with this because it felt unfinished.

Convenient and easy. While it cooked in the crock pot, I used the time to prep for the next day's meal. I made this according to the recipe and it was well-received, even by my eight year old. But a little sauce goes a long way-- it's very tangy! If you don't particularly like the taste of vinegar, sub some of the vinegar for chicken broth to cut the acidity.

I was a bid disappointed with this one. It was so easy, I really thought it was going to be good. It was a bit on the sweet/tangy side. I added a little apple cider vinegar and lemon juice to tone it down a little, which I think helped. I also added a bit of cayenne and red pepper flakes to give it a little kick, which also helped. I think the problem was in my thinking on how I approached the dish. I kept thinking it was more of an Italian pasta sauce, but that's not what I was tasting. I served it on penne pasta, and I don't think that was the best vessel for it. It had more of a bbq pulled chicken taste and I think might be better served with a slice of cheddar cheese over Texas toast. Going to give that a try with the leftovers.

No, I will not make it again. The white meat was actually powdery, and the sauce couldn't really extrapolate to dark meat. I cooked it the minimal amount of time and started with frozen chicken.

We liked this recipe, but next time, I will use a little less balsamic vinegar or put it on the tomatoes instead of on the chicken.  The flavour was quite nice though.  The chicken was very moist.   I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and the sauce was not so runny.  Once everything is cooked,  mix everything in the slow cooker and then put it over your pasta.  Otherwise, the balsamic vinegar may taste a little strong.  I will make this recipe again.

Since some had mentioned that the tomatoes make it too ascitic I added sliced carrots to add some sweetness to the sauce. Also, I mixed all the ingredients together and poured it over the chicken. I drained one cup of the tomatoes and next time I will drain both cans. Much too runny. I cooked fettuccine and put chicken and sauce on top.

I started with frozen chicken breasts and cooked it for about 5 hours.  I also used tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  My husband loved the flavor and asked me to save the recipe.

It was OK 
Couldn't tell flavor wise that I added balsamic vinegar.
I think it would have been just as good with jared spaghetti sauce

Delicious! We loved the tanginess of the vinegar. I ran out of balsamic so I used half balsamic and half red wine vinegar.

I made half a recipe in my mini-crockpot without making any changes. When I tasted the sauce toward the end of cooking I thought it was a bit too sweet as other reviewers noted.  Good balsamic vinegar is sweet and there was also a bit of sugar in the canned tomatoes so I added a couple teaspoons of cider vinegar and that really helped tame the sweetness. After 3 1/2 hrs. on low the chicken was so tender it fell apart.  And the tomatoes and onions were yummy. We loved it. Something a little different. Thank you.

I used less basil and less rosemary.  Turned out wonderfully.  The whole amount that was called for would have been and bit over powdering.  Keep them coming All Recipes.  Would love to see more old time recipes.  I enjoy cooking from scratch and love finding older recipes.

My husband and I really liked this meal.  It was tasty, very healthy and didn't feel heavy on the stomach.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes so used tomato sauce instead.  The sauce was thinner but  it didn't detract from the dish.  I served the chicken and sauce over rice, didn't add the Parmesan and had a delicious meal.

Only change to recipe was adding one green bell pepper and a couple of bay leaves.   I also cooked it on low for about 6 hours instead of high for 4.  The chicken was very moist and tore apart with a serving spoon.  I served it over pasta.

Made this as written and we loved it. The chicken breasts were plump and moist. The "sauce" is a thin consistency and we were fine with that; spooned it over our tri-color bow-tie pasta and served with a tomato/cucumber/red onion salad. It was a big hit. Be sure to use a good balsamic vinegar. The only thing I'll do differently is to cook on high for about an hour and then reduce to low for another 5 hours or so. I will definitely make this often.

Looking for a little something different.  My wife and I get into a food rut and make the same things over and over.  Thought maybe this would be that something.  It was OK but nothing  special.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was slightly overdone and dry.  If I were to make it again I would shorten the cooking time by about a 1/2 hour.

Made this yesterday but admit to substitutions. I liked it very much but not sure husband was overly impressed, or just bummed when he ate it since his football team had lost... again. Anyway. I only had one can of tomatoes (diced fire-roasted kind), but did have a jar of Cento bruschetta so those were my two tomato additions. Since the bruschetta  had all the oil and spices, I didn't add any other than S&P on the breasts when I put them in the crock pot. Covered chicken with thinly sliced onion, added bruschetta, the can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of the balsamic vinegar. Crockpot on high for 2 hours, low for 1 1/2 hr and the meat was just starting to fall apart. I really liked the taste but think it might be a touch too much balsamic unless you love balsamic (that's why I gave it just 4 stars). The bruschetta wound up being perfect for it taste wise, but it's a lot of oil. I think I might strain some of the oil out if I use it next time. Although, next time I will follow the recipe as written and see if my results are any different. But, I liked it!

I made this for dinner last week.  I got running behind and did not get home early enough to cook it in the crock pot.  I lightly browned the chicken breasts and added the remaining ingredients, except the rosemary, which I hate.  I brought it to a boil, reduced the heat as low as it would go and let it simmer, covered for three hours.  Served it over linguini with a green salad and garlic bread.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  The chicken was tender and juicy.  The "sauce was thin, but the flavor was gourmet!  Easy, easy, easy!

It came out alright but the balsamic flavor was a bit overpowering. I think replacing the vinegar with red wine might be a good idea.

I made this according to the magazine directions: two  hours on low was not enough to cook down the onions (and carrots that I added to the bottom of the pot).  The flavors are amazing (and smell delicious, too) so I will make this again but will cook the "sauce" on high for four hours and then turn it down to low and add the chicken breasts for two more hours (or until cooked through.)  I do agree that having the chicken meat in the cooker  for the full time would cook them too much.  Great served over rigatoni!

Made this exactly as stated and served over orecchiette pasta with parmesan sprinkled on top.  I was worried my kids wouldn't like it because it's not as sweet as jarred spaghetti sauce, but they both asked for seconds.  Definitely will make again!!!

This is great! The second time having it I added some mini sweet peppers (delicious), and when I had the leftovers I added black olives (which gave it a bit more Mediterranean flair!). This is such a great recipe, and I love how easy it is! A great weeknight meal. I will be experimenting with more vegetables. I love healthy one-dish meals (one-dish clean up)!

Sooooo delicious!  I only used one can of tomatoes (with basil and garlic) because that's what I had.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  It turned out watery but that was okay- I poured the sauce over fettuccini and served with green beans. A lot of flavor for very little work.  I'll definitely make again (and will stick with just the one can of tomatoes.)

I made this while snowed in and it turned out amazing! I read many of the reviews that complained that there were a lot of tomatoes...I thought that was amusing as I don't know what they thought it would taste like with 28 oz of tomatoes! The broth was a bit runny and I removed the chicken and reduced it a bit!

Substituted one can diced tomatoes instead of the two cans and didn't add rosemary.  When finished, put on top of some cooked pasta and it was very yummy.

Good and easy! Might use slightly less vinegar and crush my Rosemary next time, but it was good as is. I had to use boneless thighs, but my hubby liked it as is also!

Used cut tomatoes with green chilis, other than that made as directed, it was a little spicy but tasted wonderful, served over rice.

More than doubled the recipe (5x the original recipe to feed 35-40 people) and baked it in covered pans in the oven since that amount wouldn't fit in my crockpot.  Rather than measuring out all the dried ingredients I just used an Italian seasoning blend which I sprinkled generously over each breast before adding the other ingredients. I baked it in the oven at 350 for 90 minutes. Just before serving I topped the dish with fresh basil for color.  Everyone loved how moist it was (more than one person: "This chicken is so moist!") and it smelled absolutely amazing! It was very saucy and we spooned the sauce over plain pasta- perfect. Very yummy, simple and easy.  I won't hesitate to make it again.

We made this in the slow cooker, and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  Not very good.  But then I shredded the chicken added the sauce to the pasta, put it in a baking dish with a bit of cheese on it and my family LOVED it.  So shred the chicken if it's dry and try my baking idea...then it was so good my family said it was a keeper.

I thought this was great. I followed everything exactly except used diced tomatoes because that's what I had and only used 1 can. I also slightly cut down on the balsamic. It had a great flavor. Could eat the sauce it made even without the chicken! Served it over asparagus. Will make again.

Amazing flavor!  Served over cauliflower "rice" so whole meal was healthy.  Cooked quickly, I set my crock pot on medium and it was still done in four hours, so it would have been overcooked if I had set it on high.  Will definitely fix again.

This is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I served it with quinoa and my family loved it.  The chicken was so tender and moist.  I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for my mom and 8 yr old niece. It was such a big hit with my niece she's been talking about it to her mom at home! I'm making it again when the family comes to visit. It was super easy and yummy.  The only changes made is eliminating the onions and used minced garlic instead of cloves.

Easy to make, but I guess I really didn't like the vinegar taste as much as I thought I would.  Won't make again as there are soon many other chicken options out there.  Glad I tried it though

Great recipe - made it with pomegranate basalmic vinegar and served it originally over spaghetti squash and then for leftovers served with Farro - will make this again.  I did add tomato paste  to the sauce as one reviewer suggested and it worked out well

Perfect...It is also nice to have something done a bit quicker in the slow cooker (4 hrs on high) to just get it out and in the frig for next day...

Yummy!!  I started with two breasts thawed, and two frozen.  They all cooked perfectly together!  I served over cauliflower rice.  Fits our paleo lifestyle.  This one is a keeper, especially for summer months in Southern Nevada where it is smoldering hot at 112 degrees!   Slow cooked meals are the only way to go.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was okay, but my family didn't like it at all. The "sauce" was VERY runny, and the taste was a bit odd. I definitely won't make this again.

I made this recipe, but used chicken drumsticks instead because I didn't have chicken breasts on hand. I thought it was very good, it just had a little too much tomato taste. Next time I will use less tomatoes. I also added cayenne pepper because we like everything spicy. I served it over pasta.

This is my first ever review so bear with me.  I am a novice cook so I almost always follow directions carefully the first time.  However, because of the many other comments, I also used Rotel (actually WalMart's brand which cost 33% less, has less sugar, fewer calories, and more fiber and more Vitamin A).  The green chilies added just a touch of heat so don't be afraid.  I used chicken thighs because they are much more flavorful and only 2g of saturated fat.  I had fresh basil and fresh rosemary so that was a no-brainer.  I also added mushrooms and two kinds of olives because of the photo and the comments and the fact that I had both.  It cooked in 2.5 hours.  My wife, who can be very critical, made sure I saved the recipe.

I made this for dinner last Sunday and thought it was very good - we would have this again.  We did have some leftovers, so the next day for lunch I shredded the chicken with two forks and added it back to the sauce and heated it up. My husband made an open faced sandwich using a hogie roll, cheese, pico de gallo, and chicken.  I rolled chicken, cheese, and pico in a corn tortilla.  Both were delicious and I will definitely make this again!

Love, Love, Love it!!!!  I used 6 very large, boneless, skinless, thawed chicken breasts and cooked them for 4 hours on high. They came out fork tender and delicious! Strangely enough I didn"t have any fresh garlic so I used garlic powder and diced tomatoes since I didn't have crushed and, only added an 1/8 cup of balsalmic vinegar since some of the reviewers scared me about the sweet factor. I added 3 small cans of sliced mushrooms and it came out so yummy! Making this again on a larger scale...it was that good! -Teresa

This was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it from teens to my husband.  I did use chicken thighs as I did not have any chicken breasts.  That was the only change I made.  I don't think I would make any changes/additions when I make this again, and that's saying something as I always have to "tweak" recipes when cooking.

This is an excellent dish!  Quick to throw together with commonly used ingredients, and very forgiving on the time.  Only change I made was to add some sliced mushrooms.  I used the tomato paste, and diced tomatoes.  It was plenty thick, and really good.  I'm going to use the sauce recipe as a starter for other pasta dishes.  Next time I'll add some green pepper slices.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I make this from time to time now cause it's soo easy...esp. when nothing's defrosted... and I always have this stuff on hand.  It is a good weeknight dinner.  Not my favorite meal ever, but decent and worth a try.  I DO use frozen chicken breasts (yay).

We used chicken legs (bc that's what I had & dark meat tends to to better in the crock).  I also used fresh basil & rosemary, plus an Italian spice mix.  Also used Italian stewed tomatoes.  Came out delish! Will be making again.

4 medium boneless skinless breasts, 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can diced.  Done after 3 hours on high.

Not quit sure what went wrong. I followed one review that recommend cooking on low for 4 to 5 hours but the chicken was still tough and the sauce was just O.K.   Neither my husband or I could eat more than a couple of bites.

I used two cans of diced tomatoes and added one small can of tomato paste at the end. My husband, who is a very picky eater, devoured it. Enjoyed leftovers the next day. Did use rice instead of egg noodles.

This chicken dish had excellent flavor and we enjoyed it very much with some crusty bread. Used low setting on the slow cooker and the chicken was cooked perfectly (about 5 hrs). I didn't have crushed tomatoes but diced worked fine. Will absolutely make again!

Very good. Will make it again. Used the leftovers sliced on a salad. Made it just like it says.
