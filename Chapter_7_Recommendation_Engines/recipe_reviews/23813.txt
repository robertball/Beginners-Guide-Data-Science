I'm the originator of this recipe - glad people like it!

Just a note - I *NEVER* use "maple-flavored syrup" - the folks at AllRecipes must have changed the original recipe I sent them.  Always, always, ALWAYS use real maple syrup.

Wonderful recipe. The only issue I had with the recipe as written is the glaze needs to be reduced after the chicken is done. I took out the chicken and brought the sauce back up to a boil for about 4-5 minutes until it was a true glaze, then simply spooned it over the chicken.

After I read all the other reviews I made a small change to the recipe. For a serving for four it calls for 1 cup of orange juice I cut this down to 3/4 cup and I held back 1/4 cup of the 3/4 cup of juice to be added later to which I added 1 1/2 Tbsp corn starch. Keeping the sauce at a medium boil for at least 5 mins before you start to cook the chicken and keeping it there until you flip the chicken then add the 1/4 cup of juice with the corn starch and boil another 5 mins. Then add to chicken. It thickens very nicely and is very good even my fussy 10 year old who hates everything liked it.

I made this SO MUCH faster & easier & it was SPECTACULAR. Instead of cooking whole chicken breasts (which take longer) I cut two large chicken breasts into bite sized pieces. I sprayed a saute pan with Pam & put the chicken in (completely omitted the butter and oil step -- you don't need it). I sprinkled the chicken w/ about 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary and only 1/4 tsp salt & pepper since I had only half the chicken. I sauteed the chicken for about 5 to 7 minutes. I mixed the full amount of sauce ingredients (1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/2 cup white wine, one cup OJ). I did bring the sauce to a boil only to immediately realized that step did NOTHING for the sauce and was a waste of time & unnecessarily dirtied another pan. So I stopped right away and just poured the uncooked sauce over the chicken. I quickly scraped/deglazed the bottom of the pan to get up all the bits of rosemary & chicken (where all the good flavor settles). I simmered it for about 7 minutes before adding a tablespoon of butter to give the sauce a silky quality. I also grated about a half teaspoon orange zest into the sauce. Finally, I used about 1/8 cup orange juice to 1/2 teaspoon corn starch to thicken the sauce. Simmered 1 more minute then served it over mashed potatoes. YUM. Could put over brown rice too. This is right up there with the best of the recipe inspirations I've gotten from this site over the years.

I forgot the wine, but made the sauce with just the oj and maple syrup. Wonderful, wonderful.
Even the kids liked it!

HELPFUL TIP IF YOU WORK: I always make the chicken ahead of time then stick in my lock&lock container in the fridge, so that all I have to do is make the sauce when I come home, so the meal is ready in 10 min!  I never use the rosemary since husband doesn't like it, but I do add lots of mrs. dash on each side while frying.  Cutting the chicken to 1/2" thickness also makes this tastes better b/c it cooks faster w/o drying.  That way you don't have to worry about the sauce cooking in raw chicken.  I always add 1.5T of cornstarch (to part of the orange juice until it dissolves THEN add to saucepan) as soon as I add the syrup, and this thickened up REAL good.  It's perfect when you're not in the mood to cook, but want something that looks like you did a lot.  I've used all kinds of syrup, and it's all turned out fine!

This is by far one of the most tastiest dishes I've ever tried.  It is an AWSOME dish and we plan to use it as one of our main dishes on our gourmet banquet menu.  This dish will be used for weddings and other events.  I would have rated it a 4 star only because of the glaze that I found took a bit to long, but the flavor is truly there and I feel it deserves a 5 star, so, there you go! By the way, I used organic fresh rosemary and this picture does this recipe justice and mine came out looking pretty just like in the photo. Ok everyone, ENJOY!

Absolutely delicious and quite easy to prepare.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, no substitutions, and it was a winner.  My husband loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again.  I served it over couscous with steamed vegetables on the side-- quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal, but with lots of flavor and a nice presentation.

Oooh I liked this recipe!  I took reviewers' advice and used half the amount of maple syrup, and I added some cornstarch to reserved orange juice to put in at the end to thicken the glaze.  My husband loved it and thinks I'm an amazing cook...this recipe is easy, too.

This was a great recipe! I used blood oranges instead of regular oranges.. and I also used 100% maple syrup from a jar.I also added a bit of orange zest for a extra kick. I served it over herbed coucous.. and my husband just loved it. 
I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to help thicken.. and it worked out great.
Thanks! we'll make this again for sure.

I came across this recipe quite a while back and have made it many times. Skinless chicken thighs are by far my favorite part of the chicken so I use them instead of breasts and allow 2 thighs per serving. To the recipe I add 1 Tb of balsamic vinegar and one large clove of garlic minced. This dish is simple, loaded with flavor and impressive.

Really good.  Only change I made was to substitute Marsala since we are not white wine drinkers but I always have Marsala on hand.  Good, quick recipe.  The kids loved it.

What a wondeful 5 star recipe!  It was quick and easy and the taste was like you spent hours making the delcious sauce/glaze.  I was amazed at how well the orange, rosemary and maple went together, it was the perfect marry of flavors.  I'm so glad I finally gave this recipe a try.  A definite keeper and repeat in this house!

This is a good standard recipe and I have used it many times, albeit with one change. I use boneless and skinless chicken thighs which I consider to be the most flavourful part of the chicken.

I am in love with this glaze! I was tempted to lick my plate. I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. I like to sear my chicken and get it nice & brown, then add the liquid to deglaze the pan, picking up all the tasty bits! Maybe try this with pork!

This was a really nice recipe. After browning, I finished the chicken in the slow cooker, and it turned out just great. I wanted a little more flavor, so I added soy sauce and some seasonings to suit our taste. And I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end. Thanks for a great recipe that our family and guests really enjoyed.

EXCELLENT & DIFFERENT:  This was a hit with the family.  I used all ingredients indicated with the following modifications:  5 whole chicken breast halves (separated and filleted, making a total of 20 filets, of which I used about 10!), 1.5 cups of Tropicana OJ – no pulp - (reserved ½ cup for end with cornstarch to thicken sauce), ½ cup 100% pure maple syrup, and ½ cup California Chardonnay Wine (with aroma of Peach & Pineapple).  I seasoned the chicken with:, season salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, & Italian Seasoning.  I also finely chopped in a food processor: ½ chopped white onion, 4 whole scallion sprigs, and 2 shredded twigs of rosemary and spread these on the chicken pieces after applying the powdered seasonings.  I fried the chicken in batches and placed them in a baking pan.  I poured the final sauce over the chicken and baked in the oven for 8 minutes at 425 degrees.  Served with Chicken & Garlic flavored rice-a-roni, corn & carrots.  Very Good.

Tasty, but the sauce wasn't much of a glaze. Should boil longer to reduce.

All recipes come down to a matter of personal taste in the end, but I had my doubts about maple syrup...with OJ?... and then rosemary??    The whole kitchen smelled like pancakes while I was cooking it.   It was easy to prepare and the chicken was nice and moist, but in this case, not really my cup of tea.   I only save recipes that "wow" me.   This one was tasty enough to finish it up, but it wasn't something I would bother to make again.

YUMMMMM!  this was amazing, and a definite addition to my family's favorite file.  We wished there was more when dinner was over.  Served with baked potatoes and asparagus, and this would make an excellent meal if serving company.  Definitely use real maple syrup!  Thanks for sharing!

The chicken came out a bit dry, so next time I'll saute it for a shorter length of time so it doesn't overcook when simmering, but the sauce was very good.  I used dried rosemary but softened it in water so it wasn't too crunchy.  I also added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken the glaze after simmering with the chicken.

I picked this to use up fresh rosemary and was not disappointed.  The taste was unusual but very very good.  However, I simmered the liquid for a good 20 minutes and it never really thickened but still tasted great, so it didn't seem to matter.

WOW.  Outstanding.  The only thing that I did differently was I kept the sauce on a rolling boil for the 10 minutes with the chicken- and I cracked the lid so the steam could escape.  By that time I had a gorgeous glaze.

This was sooooo yummy and smelled so good.  I will definitely be making it again.  I didn't have the wine so I skipped that, the sausce never thickened (not sure if missing the wine had anything to do with it)  But even with the sauce liquidy it was awesome or as my son would say EPIC!

I made this exactally as dirrected, using all large chicken breasts. I found no need to use any 'thickener' or to cut down on some ingredients. Patience is the key to the perfect sauce this makes and, when served over rice, is just the right amount.
My friend used Turkey breasts, halved and slightly pounded, and said it was great!

This recipe was incredibly easy, which makes the end result even more unbelievable. I couldn't believe how delicious the glaze turned out. And the chicken was very moist. Plus...this went together fairly quickly. I had found this recipe because I had some oranges and exactly four chicken breasts...and what a perfect fit! I didn't have any fresh rosemary, but I substituted a teaspoon and a half of dried.

After reading the reviews, I decided to cut back on the maple syrup to 1/4 cup instead and I think because of that, my sauce did not thicken up. But like most others, I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce after it was simmered with the chicken for a short while. The taste was fantastic! It wasn't too sweet and the rosemary definitely enhanced the taste of the sauce. Great recipe and something that I would make again!

This recipe is absolutely divine.  Followed another reviewer's advice to initially use only 3/4 cup of OJ; 5 mins after adding the maple syrup, added the remaining 1/4 cup of OJ with 1.5 Tbs of cornstarch.  Thickened right up!

I literally licked the glaze right off the plate because I couldn't get enough.  Delicious!

Tasty, but a few changes made it better. I made slits into my chicken breast and added a mixture of diced up dried apricots, cranberries, and raisins. Same spices but reduced the maple syrup to 1/4 cup. When I removed the chicken from the pan I added 1 tbs flour dissolved in some water into the dripping. Brought to a quick boil and let cool. Formed a wonderful glaze sauce! Watch cook time to prevent dryness. I only fried 3 min each side.

This recipe was so easy to follow and came out great. I made it for a luncheon with simple changes. I cut up the chicken breast into chunks and then prepared as directed. During the last 10 minutes I added a 5 oz bag of frozen sliced tri-color bell peppers. It made for a beautiful presentation when served over brown rice. Would definitely make again. Thanks.

Loved this :) first thing I've cooked for my boyfriend. First time making it. I cut the chicken into bites size peices so it would cook faster. Turned out beautifully, I thought it was good but i couldn't eat much. My boyfriend doesn't eat anyone's food but her mom's until i made this. He asks for it all the time.

Loved it! Very simple two-pan dish.  It wasn't a very thick glaze, but the flavor was perfect the way it was.  If it were a thicker glaze I'm afraid it would be overpowering and cloying.  I made it exactly as written and our dinner guests were very impressed.  Even my picky 2-year-old ate an entire adult-sized portion, which says A LOT!  This is going to the front of my cookbook binder.

This was such a nice change from regular old chicken. I used the ingredients exactly as they were listed. I did however make the glaze in a skillet and used that same pan to cook the chicken.  I also removed the chicken from the pan after cooking to let the sauce reduce more. My one year old loved it!

Cooking the chicken this way kept it very moist.  I used rosa maria (rosemary and garlic) along with the salt and peper and the herb blend was excellent.  The sauce was nice, and lightly sweet.  My only complaint was the messy dishes, but my husband liked the meal enough to clean up the kitchen!

REALLY did NOT like this!!  (sorry Linda W.)  was WAY TOO SWEET for our taste, with an underlying bitterness from the OJ!  Had to practically "burn" the sauce in order to get it to low boil enough to thicken up! (even made the house smell awful!)   We threw out the leftovers!   Won't make again!

This dish brings about a strange fusion of flavors that, frankly, isn't at all appealing. I saw what other reviewers said about the flavors not going together, but tried it myself to see. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. 

The glaze has a very strong Asian flavor that I didn't expect, but the sweet orange/teriyaki-esque flavor paired with rosemary was not pleasant whatsoever. It was also a bit too sweet; perhaps using oranges instead of just orange juice might be better? I also discovered that the chicken came out pretty dry, which I noticed a few other people have mentioned, but that might have been my own cooking error; who knows. Dinner was ok, but the leftovers were unpalatable. I will continue searching for a good chicken stable; this doesn't fit the bill at all.

Very good.  Followed exactly. All the family loved it.  Sauce needs to cook longer than five minutes (I'd guess 10-15 min) to thicken.  Ours was too thin but still delicious.  Rosemary flavor - perfect.

Loved this recipe. I used TJ's orange peach mango juice and stevia-maple syrup blend, and had no problems getting the thick consistency. I ate it over brown rice with garlic green beans, and next time I am going to have it over sweet potatoes.  the sauce is so good! This is a recipe I'll make next time I want to impress someone :)

The sauce didn't thicken well, but the flavor was excellent. To prevent the chicken from drying out I added the sauce after letting it brown for just a few minutes on each side.

I thought this recipe was great. Its easy to put together, uses ingredients everyone has on hand, and doesn't take much time from start to finish. the chicken has a pleasant (but not overpowering like i was afraid it would be) orange and maple flavor. however, you DO have to keep a close eye on it, I accidentally burned the sauce while attending to other dishes. I assume it was probably because of the sugar in the juice and the syrup, which sometimes has a propensity to burn quickly...although since other reviewers don't seem to have had this problem, maybe it was just me with my stove turned up to high!! The chicken itself wasn't damaged, but it was unfortunately coated in a thick black slime that just wasn't appealing. I learned my lesson for next time though, and will be more careful! I look forward to an opportunity to try this recipe again, and I'm sure it will come out fabulous!

My family loves this.  I make it often just as written.  Much much better with real maple syrup- I have tried it with the kids' syrup in a pinch and was dissappointed.  Company loves it to- I serve with rice and broccoli.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and it was wonderful! I doubled the recipe which meant longer reducing time but other than that it perfect. I also used chicken tenders instead of the chicken breasts. The rosemary really gives it a great flavor.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband! I had to change a few things because I was out of a lot of stuff. heres all I did differently. I didnt have white wine so I used an apple juice and cider vingigar mixure, and I didnt have maple syrup so i used the random pankake syrup i had on hand, not sure if it was even maple flavored but it all turned out great!

I'm a single dude who usually cooks shake and bake chicken every week, eating it from Sun > Thurs.    Tonight, I tried your recipe and was very happy. I had to goto the store for everything but the chicken (I used boneless/ skinless thighs) and the syrup (always got maple on hand living in NE).    It came out really good.  Yes, I forgot the cornstarch/ arrowroot at the store that y'all bloggers recommended, but the flavor of the chix and sauce was nice.  I like that I didnt have to marinate ANYTHING.     I can deal with the thin sauce. From my little knowledge of cooking, the ingredients you listed didnt really conjure up dreams of a thick roux anyway.  I don't understand the folk who  thought the sauce tasted like maple syrup w/ orange juice added together -- it didnt. I probably it boilin longer than you recommended but it was all good.  I did squeeze real oranges (3 fat naranjas  = 1 cup).    I also dont understand the folk who think this was the best recipe ever...it was good but only 15 minutes of prep and nothing else...cant this really be the best on this site? Hope not...(nothing against it)!   What I do understand is that you made a simple, very flavorful, chicken recipe available --- and I thank you for that. I will do it again.    I used more rosemary and a little less syrup, and I think there was maybe too much oil/ butter --- but overall -- it was very well done.  Thank you...and please, for us neophytes...definitely keep these type of recipes coming.

This was very good.  Due to the high cost of maple syrup, I substituted about half with honey.  I also added a little cornstarch/water to thicken it.

As stated by the other reviews..you need to reduce the orange sauce by 1/2. I placed orange zest and rosemary in the orange sauce to simmer, and wow what a wonderful flavor. After you grill the chicken, remove, and deglaze the pan with the thickened orange sauce. Once done, place the chicken in the sauce and simmer. Do not overcook or chicken is tough. Loved the flavor! Will definately use again.

When I first starting heating the sauce, the smell made me think I wouldn't like this in the end, but thankfully that's not how it turned out.  It was SO good, and the sauce deglazing the pan with the chicken made it nice and dark and tasty.  The one thing I altered was instead of the salt/pepper/rosemary, I coated the breasts with poultry seasoning.  And I did thicken it in the end with some flour (I was out of corn starch), which made a perfect sauce/gravy.  I served it over couscous but it would be good with rice or potatoes too.

This was a sinfully great dish! made some small changes however. I used Marsala (it's what I had on hand). I also added a little raw honey, just to thicken and sweeten, because I used real maple syrup. Also once the chicken was completly cooked through I removed it from the pan and scliced it in thin strips then placed it back in the pan to soak up the juices, and toped it on some white rice. I will say that I have made this recipe more than once and have made it just as the breast with other sides, and my whole family agrees, it's better on white rice. I'm also willing to bet some cashews would be nice with it! Over all a fantastic recipe! Will eat over and over!

I made this 3 times.  First time followed the recipe and it was too much maple flavor, second time I used honey instead of maple syrup and it didn't have enough flavor. Third time I used equal parts maple syrup and honey and it was perfect!  I also put orange zest in the sauce and thickened with a little cornstarch.  Family loves it, I serve with angel hair pasta instead of rice.

Not as good as I had hoped. Chicken takes on a boiled texture.  Cooking chicken in the maple glaze(??) gives the chicken a funny and unnatural color. I could not get sauce to thicken so ended up making a quick slurry with corn starch to help it along. Prepared the dish for myself, would have been really disappointed if I was preparing this for company. Besides the poor visual presentation the taste was noting special.
If you love maple as I do and feel you must give it a try I would make the following suggestions. Keep in mind I have not tried this but based on my experience preparing this once, I would try this if I was to make it again.  First reduce the amount of fat you saute the chicken in initially so you get a good brown burn on it and I would not cover it while you cooked it either. Consider cooking the chicken all the way then remove the chicken from the pan and try reducing the orange-maple concoction. Pour over chicken just before serving.

Rated "the best dinner ever" by my family. Combined with baked potatoe and roasted vegetables. I used drumsticks (bone in/skin on) and simply doubled the seasoning mix. No changes to sauce required. Took a little longer to cook but the chicken was a huge hit. Thank you!!

I made this recipe and followed the instructions line by line and I did not care for it. Even though I am a fan of rosemary and orange flavors the chicken this recipe did not do it justice. The most annoying thing about this recipe is that the glaze never reduces and becomes glaze. After combining all the ingredients at the end I cooked it per the instructions and the sauce never thickened up. After simmering for 45 minutes it was still just as runny as the orange juice and white wine mixture when I originally brought it to a boil. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. There are so many other great recipes on this site.

I made this with pork chops instead of chicken. The flavor was really great, but I had a LOT of trouble getting my sauce to reduce. Probably will make ONE MORE time just to see if i can redeem myself. If not, won't make again.

Freakin wonderful - I was a little short on maple syrup so at the very end I just added a little corn starch and it thickened up very nicely.  It was tangy sweet, and the flavor worked very well when paired with brown rice!

Very good recipe but it doesn't cook up as fast as it says.  The glaze takes longer to reduce and I have needed to use corn starch.  This is so good we made it two days in a row.  The second day we diced up the chicken before cooking it and did more of a sauce than a glaze.

good (3/5). I did not cover the skillet to saute (I tend to keep the lid off at that point). I did cook the sauce up, but I agree with others, not sure if it was needed. 

I wish it was more of a glaze, I think next time I will not think of that as an afterthought but keep it in mind by reserving some of the liquid. 

I prefer to cook with vermouth instead of white wine so maybe that was the good and not great feeling?

Made this as written except that I sauteed half an onion cut into thin strips and then added the chicken to that.  Used combination of BLSL chicken breasts and thighs (about 2.5 lbs total).  Did thicken with cornstarch near the end.  Served with couscous cooked in chicken stock with pine nuts and parmesan.  Delicious!!

This recipe is AMAZING.  Wonderful flavors, tastes and looks beautiful and it isn't difficult to prepare.  It's absolutely perfect as written, I wouldn't change a thing.  My only tip to first time makers of this recipe is to give yourself a little more time to reduce the glaze, it took me quite awhile.

Thanks so much for the recipe!  This is definitely a keeper.

This was good and easy prep. It took me longer to make than the suggested time...maybe because it was the first time. After 10 minutes, the sauce still wasn't very thick. We were hungry so didn't wait. The runny version was still very good over rice w/ asparagus. Will make again.

Following other comments, I used 3/4 cup orange juice and 1/4 cup real maple syrup.  The sauce didn't reduce, but overall came out great.  Thanks for posting!

This was a big hit with the meat-eating boyfriend. I say this because I am a non-meat eater, so I will just have to take his word for it. 

It was easy to prepared and I followed the recipe almost as written, however cut the chicken into bite sized pieces so I could figure out (to the best of my vegetarian ability) when they were cooked. This substitution was welcomed by the boyfriend, as he didn't really know otherwise. 

I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed sugar snap peas. 

I got a request to make more for tomorrow's lunch with the leftover smashed potatoes, and of course, I obliged :)

I thought this was really good and easy enough to make as an every day dish.  I made rice as well and put a little of the sauce on top.  The only thing I did differently was thicken it a bit at the end with a little cornstarch mixed in hot water.  Very tasty.

delish! Kids loved it, too! I did as previous reviewers suggested and added a bit of cornstarch to a couple tablespoons of reserved OJ. I also used thyme and sage (not a rosemary fan) Will def. make this one again!

I made this tonight & WOW! My picky eater went back for seconds! First I started the juice & wine mixture. Next I put on a pot of Jasmine rice for my side. Then I began cooking the chicken per the recipe. The recipe does take a few more minutes to thicken, but I would not cut the liquids. Everything turned out fine. Will definitely be a mainstay at our house!

Great flavor!  I messed up and cooked the chicken all the way through and left the sauce boiling away in the sauce pot.  It never thickened (not sure why) but we were all hungry so I just served it up.  Still so delicious and tons of flavor.  A keeper and I will do it right next time!

This had a good flavor to it but the chicken turned out kind of dry and the sauce never reduced, I had to add cornstarch to it to thicken it. So it never really glazed the chicken.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Because I had some freshly dried Thyme, I mostly used Thyme in place of the Rosemary. The lemony aroma added to the experience and complemented the orange juice/maple syrup sauce. Next time I will cut the sauce in half (there was plenty) or cook twice as long, as I wasn’t able to thicken the sauce to my liking because everything else was ready. Delicious none the less and no one even knew that a thicker sauce was desired.

Wow! I have to say I was worried when it was cooking because it didn't smell appetizing, but when it was done it tasted amazing!
My grandfather, who complains about everything, actually asked for the recipe.  My aunt tried some leftover and said it was spectacular and has also asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper, and super easy.

This recipe caught my attention because of the "Maple" in it. It is alright- I glazed it over and over and didn't get much flavor... Didn't taste much more then rosemary.

Just personal preference, but this was a little too orange-y for me.  I wanted to like it... and plan to try it again, with some adjustments (maybe half the OJ and add chicken broth, and a little butter?).  The chicken was great and I had no problem at all with my glaze thickening, the key is med-high heat after the maple goes in, it bubbled and thickened right up for me, be careful though or it will reduce too much.  My fussy boyfriend really liked this though, so it was 3 stars for me and 4 for him.  I kept a few pieces of chicken out of the glaze and tried those with just a little glaze drizzled on it and the rice, that was better for me.

Excellent!  And easy and pretty healthy to boot!  Can't ask for anything more then that.  I keep orange juice concentrate in the freezer for recipes like this that call for a little bit of juice, that way I always have it on hand.

Wow! Even though this recipe already had some great reviews, I have to say that it was even better than I expected. I followed the recipe as directed, only substituting the chicken for meatless chicken breasts. The sauce seemed to be taking a while to thicken, so I ended up adding a tsp of corn starch to speed the process. Absolutely delicious!

I made double the amount of sauce, which is well worth it. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs b/c I'm more of a dark meat fan. But the real key is to ADD TOASTED ALMONDS!!! When the dish is done,  toast about a half cup of slivered almonds and mix it in before you serve. It adds an incredible flavor AND texture. Without the almonds, I'd give the recipe a 3.5ish

The only substitution I made was to use dried rosemary instead of fresh. On that note, you must really like the taste of rosemary to even find this edible... I thought the sauce might save it, as it sounded really good however this was not so. It was a little too sweet, never thickened and the rosemary on the chicken mixed all together made this dish unedible to me. My fiance liked this, though. The recipe is simple, with easily accessible ingredients however the rosemary overpowers it. Maybe Italian seasoning instead? I don't know, but I will not be making this again.

This was good but not great.  I cut back on the amount of syrup after reading the reviews and it was still too sweet for us.  This is a good starter recipe for something great.  I may use brown sugar instead of the syrup and add some garlic and ginger next time.

Much easier to make than I expected.  I only added cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but other than that I followed the recipe but added a little garlic too.  Served with rice and a broccoli-pepper stir fry and it was great! Oh, I also followed another review to put a little flour on the chicken before searing.  I would suggest to do that only if you want to -- I don't think it made much of a difference.

The final result was fantastic! The whole family gave this a 5 plus rating. I used real maple syrup, I did have a problem with the sauce thickening. After the chicken cooked in it for 10 minutes, I removed the chicken from the pan, took out a couple of tablespoons of the sauce added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to that mixed it together (to avoid lumps) and poured it into the frying pan, I cooked it on med/high with a good boil going for another 10 minutes, it thickened up nicely and I added the chicken back to coat it. Will definetely make again!

This is a great recipe, but needs a little work. As many others said, the sauce didn't thicken. I think it needs some corn starch (which I didn't have.)I loved the flavors though! I will make this again.

So yummy! The flavors blended really well, but I couldn't get the glaze to thicken up at all, even after 10 more minutes before I put it over the chicken. Not a big deal, just what happened. Will definitely make this again.

This was a really easy chicken dish to make.  I used dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh.  Like several other reviewers, I found the glaze was pretty thin, but I took the chicken out of the pan then turned up the heat to thicken the glaze.  I turned out great and everyone loved this dish.  I made a rice pilaf to go with it and the glaze was good on the rice too.  I'll make this again.

I loved loved this recipe i used fresh oranges about 3 and a half of a grapefruit juiced it, pour it into a sauce pot didn't have any white wine so i used 1/2 soy sauce and 1/4 cup red wine viegar boiled it.Add some zest of the orange in the pot about 2 tsp add the pure maple syrup but only 1/4 cup and 2 Tsb of brown sugar a dash of lemon juice.Let it simmer.Season my chicken breast halves with garlic and complete sesoning and rosemary.Sauteed in butter for 4 minutes on both sides .When the glazed wouldn't thicken up i add 2 Tsp of corn starch whisking it frequently.When it thicken somewhat i poured it unto my chicken breast in let it cook probably 5 minutes more.It's so wonderful i cooked the chicken noodles stir fry with this .This was so yummy a must try

I followed this recipe to the "T" and I wouldn't change a thing.  The sauce thickens up beautifully if you follow the exact directions.  There is no need for flour or cornstarch to thicken it.  Just be patient and it turns out perfectly.  I served it over rice and we loved it.

I made this last night, and it was amazing! My boyfriend said that he could eat this once a month at least. I did have to cook the glaze longer than it said once I added it to the chicken pan, but you will know when it becomes glaze-like. It's really good! We will make again.

I didn't have any rosemary handy, but I otherwise made this recipe to the letter. It comes out very good, but it takes a bit longer than specified for the sauce to really make a glaze.

This recipe is yummy! I modified it slightly by using boneless, skinless thighs. I also used 1/4 C of grade B maple syrup, and about 1.5 T olive oil and a sliver of unsalted butter. Since I used thighs, I covered and cooked them for about 3-4 minutes each side, then took the cover off and cooked five minutes more per side. I took the chicken out and raised the heat to reduce the sauce and it reduced to a wonderful glaze to top the chicken once plated. Thanks for this recipe, I'll definitely be making it again!

We really enjoyed this one! We cut the maple syrup down to 1/4 cup and it was still so flavorful. The sauce wasn't as thick but was still thick enough to coat and not runny. We also omitted the butter. We really loved this recipe!

This recipe is pretty good. Very easy to make, and the flavor is very light/subtle, not overpowering, but good. The chicken breasts turned out very moist, but that was probably due to the very liquid-ey sauce. I added some cornstarch like some of the other reviewers suggested but it didn't work to thicken it. Even though I would have liked to have some thick sauce to put on the chicken it was okay without it. I let the chicken bask in the rosemary, salt and pepper for an hour or so and that turned out great, since I like rossemary on chicken. Served it with some brown rice pilaf and broccoli. Yum.

This was a very nice chicken dish. The presentation was very nice. I did make some changes. I used only 1/4 C maple syrup, 1/2 lime, 1 tsp. dried rosemary and no olive oil or butter. I just used spray oil for the chicken. I also had to use about 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch mixed with a few tbl. of water to thicken the sauce before serving.

I was really in the mood for a rosemary chicken recipe.  This really hit the spot.  I enjoyed the marinade quite a bit.  It wasn't overpowering and it really meshed well with rosemary. If you are a citris and rosemary lover, this recipe is a sure thing to try.

The sauce was way too thin and there was too much of it.  The taste was only so-so.  Would have been much better if it had actually been a "glaze".  Maybe you have to let it boil longer, I don't know.  Probably won't make again.

Great meal for entertaining- served over white rice with green bean almondine.  Chicken and sauce were excellent however we could not get it to thicken into rich glaze-  had to eat as a sauce.  Make sure to give time for sauce to thicken.  Otherwise-  fab!!

My significant other loves breakfast, so he really enjoyed this.  To me, it tasted just like a full breakfast - the rosemary added a sausage taste, the syrup and OJ are breakfast staples.  It was a little strange to me, but still tasty.  I'll be making it again soon, I'm sure!

Well, I thought it was kind of strange.  I made it as written, except to add a little bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce.  It seemed to be too sweet.  I also thought the rosemary didn't blend too well with the orange-maple taste.  My kids kind of liked it, but my husband didn't at all.  I just thought it was sort of meh.  I won't be making it again.

I just finished making this and please if you do this recipe make sure you use real maple syrup. I omitted the salt but it was very good. When I make it again I will definitely use real maple syrup and freshly squeezed oranges. Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious!!!  I used probably four times more fresh rosemary than the recipe called for because I just sprinkled and pressed it on instead of making a rub, but made no other changes.  It was SO good.  I'll make this regularly.

Pretty tasty. Make sure you don't overcook your chicken; the cook time in the recipe is a little long. And the sauce/glaze takes much longer to reduce than the recipe states. But other than that, good recipe and easy to make.

Excellant recipe!!The only thing I did difference was that I used Pam instead of the oils. I also tried it without the wine; suggested by some users. Next time, I will try it with white wine. I do like to cook with wine. Any suggestions on the type of white wine. By the way, real maple-syrup is the only way to go.

Had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken. Used orange juice from concentrate and real maple syrup. Maybe that's what went wrong. Regardless, it was so easy and delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe, but it could definitely use less liquid next time. My sauce never thickened into that nice glaze I was waiting for.

Everything was delicious, the sauce did take longer than the recipe called for but that is often the case when cooking.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Just made this for dinner...very good. I am always looking for ways to use maple syrup. My sister & family make their own...it's wonderful. I paired it with acorn squash & a simple salad w/balsamic vinaigrette.   Will definitely make again. My family raved over it.

This is super quick to make, yet sophisticated enough for adult guests. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch mixed with some of the reserved, cooled orange juice mixture.

I LOVED this dish!  However, I had to double the rosemary ingredient, as my chicken breasts were not small.  The sauce came out perfect and the chicken was SO moist!!  I served the chicken on a bed of long grain rice w/ a side of broccoli w/ cheese from steamers.  Awesome, quick & easy dish for a weeknight!  I will most definitely be making this dish againa and again and again!!!!

This recipe was so simple and really tastey. My daughter is really picky and she loved it. I added some corn starch at the end to thicken up the glaze. (my daughter has just informed me that I should make this again)

*** I enjoyed the sauce, however, even after adding the cornstarch I wasn't able to get the rich, thick glaze consistancy.  My big disappointment was the chicken.  I should have either pounded it or sliced it before it was sauted.  I will try this receipe again and hopefully it will turn out just right.  Thank you, Barbara in Naples, FL

The sauce was very thin and needs to be thickened.
Overall, the only great comment I have, is the wonderful flavor of the rosemary. Sorry, but Thank You for Sharing

I'm a decent cook, but my glaze was too watery and the flavor of the "sauce" was not appealing. I won't make this again. Not sure I understand all the great reviews.

I made this exactly as written, however when it came time to add the glaze to the pan, it was still very runny so I needed to add some cornstarch. Otherwise it was excellent. I sliced the breasts for my guests just prior to serving, and spooned some extra glaze over top. Served it with some basmati rice (used chicken broth) and steamed asparagus. Everyone enjoyed it.

I made this for the first time, my family loved it even my picky son loved.  I did find that I had to make more of the chicken rub there was enough to cover all the chicken.  I also took the chicken out when done cooking because the glaze wasn't thick enough, needed to be boiled down more to make thicker, then it was great.  Would use this glaze on pork too.  I will be making is again my family said it was amazing chicken.  We loved the favor

Excellent  - I will definitely add this one to the recipe binder. I dredged the chicken very lightly in flour and swapped a small amount of poultry seasoning for the rosemary, along with salt and pepper.  I also used clementines because that's what I had on hand.  As suggested before me, I lowered the quantity of orange juice to 3/4 cup; divided.  I used 1/2 cup of juice at the start of recipe, continued to boil the whole time I browned chicken and then, afte maple syrup step, I  finished with another 1/4 cup of juice mixed with 1 T of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce and continue to boil for an extra few mnutes before combining with chicken.  I served with herb couscous and sweet corn.

The flavor was a little odd to me...not bad, just different.  I used "kid syrup" and maybe I should have used real maple syrup.  The kids like it for the sweetness, but I was undecided.  Thanks for the recipe...I am glad we tried it.

Dunno if it's because I used fake syrup but the flavor just didn't appeal to me. Kind of felt like my pancakes creeped into my chicken dinner. My girlfriend loved it though. So maybe just a different in taste preference...

Fantastic recipe!  I followed one of the other reviewers suggestion and let the sauce reduce a little more.  I served with rice and brussel sprouts.  It made for a great meal.

Amazing recipe! I used up all my maple syrup and white wine on my first glaze attempt--which I botched.  At that point, I figured I had already invested enough time in the recipe that I had to finish.  I substituted plain ol' applie juice for the white wine, and substituted standard Mrs. Butterworths syrup for the maple syrup...the result was amazing.  I can't even imagine how delicious this will be when I make it the way it was intended. :) Thanks!!

I enjoyed this quite a bit, the fresh rosemary is a great compliment to the orange sauce. Ultimately I thought that it was a tad too sweet, so I ended up adding a chicken bullion cube to the sauce at the end. In the future I will cut the maple syrup in half to get a little more savory sauce.

Very tasty.  Would make again.  I made as directed except I scaled down the recipe to serve 2.  Was not a problem except when it came down to the simmering time at the end.  Don't let it simmer for more than a few minutes otherwise you will end up with a burnt syprup!!

this is absolutely perfect, simple, and delicious. all i changed was to add some corn starch mixed with oj at the end to thicken up the sauce, but i just wanted a thicker sauce for the rice we served it on. we'll be making this often!

For some reason I couldn't get the sauce to 'glaze'. I didn't try to doctor it up, and just served as it was - it was delicious and so simple. The chicken was perfectly cooked with the cooking times given. However, next time I will cut the butter and oil by at least half.

So good and healthy recipe, I also have used with pork tenderloin.  If I am out of wine I use chicken broth but the wine tenderizes more I think.

This was wonderful. I was worried about using my light orange juice and sugar free syrup....but it worked out great. I used pre-cooked refrigerated chicken chunks which made this super easy to prepare. I tossed the chicken in bit of olive oil and the spices and then heated it in the microwave for 30 seconds before I added it to the sauce. I liked this method also because it didnt require the extra butter and olive oil. I served this over angel hair pasta. Of course it was accompanied by the wine that needed to be opened to prepare this ;)

This tasted fantastic! I used chicken breast cut into strips because I wanted to serve over rice and thats how we like to eat it. It worked out fine, I just cut down on the initial cooking time. I also reduced the amount of butter and olive oil by about half to cut down on the fat. My sauce didn't really thicken, so I just added about a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with some OJ and added that to the sauce before I added it to the chicken. Turned out to be a perfect consistancy and created a beautiful glaze on the chicken. Thanks for the recipe, Linda.

This was excellent! I used chicken broth instead of the wine and it came out great. I also thickened sauce in the end with a little butter. So delicious! Served with mashed potatoes. Kids loved it too!

Wonderful!  I added garlic to the rosemary, salt & pepper (used morter & pestle) to coat chicken tenders.  Although I boiled the sauce separately, I ended up adding 1 1/2 T. arrowroot with 1 1/2 T. water to thicken it.  The sauce actually would be good with chicken chunks, broccoli, etc. over rice.

Yummy! My family (toddler included) loved this.  I think next time I may cut back a bit on the OJ, it seemed to mask some of the yummy maple flavor (and thats a lot of syrup to use and then mask over the flavor).  Definitely use real maple syrup, the flavor with the fake stuff is just not the same plus its a lot more healthy.   This is a yummy recipe that will not disappoint.

I loved this glaze. The caramelization around the edges is exactly what I was hoping for and the taste was fantastic. My breasts were a little thick so the centers were dry. I'd recommend using thinner breasts or soaking them in buttermilk. Also, definitely use fresh rosemary like it calls for! I used dry rosemary and the flavor was great but the leaves are hard and stay that way. Served with couscous and it was great!

This is absolutely divine. The glaze is the star of the show....the flavor is SO good, and the consistency once cooled is absolutely positively perfect. This dish is so versatile...it tastes a lot more complex than it is to make, which makes it perfect for weeknight dinners OR for formal meals with company. Don't worry if your glaze looks too thin while it's cooking....it will thicken when you're done and it's had time to cool. I served this over jasmine rice with broccoli and yeast rolls....my fiance went crazy for this. I used a roll to sweep the extra glaze off my plate and it was delish. :) Thanks for the recipe; this is a favorite at my house.

Even though I had to use dried rosemary, I *really* enjoyed this recipe.  The sauce is really tangy and fresh and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  Did definitely add cornstarch to thicken, however.  Poured extra sauce over quinoa that was served on the side.  Yum :)

FABULOUS!!!!  I didn't have oj so I used syrup from some manderine oranges and pure Vermont Maple Syrup is amust in this recipe.  I used grade B. B is best for cooking.  I added about 2 tsp grated orange peel.  We have this at least once a month. thanks for sharing!  d1rhett

Agreed that this is an excellent recipe when you want something a little different.  For those who are having trouble getting the glaze to thicken, I think perhaps your cooking temperature may be too low.  You have to get a really good boil going for the sauce to reduce (similar to making candy).  I did not have to add anything to thickent - although it did take somewhat longer than indicated.

If you want to get out of your chicken rut Try this quick and easy recipe! Very flavorful. It has ingredients that are staples in many homes. I don't really like cooking with wine so I just used chicken broth instead. Served with quionia and broccoli. yummy!

I found this recipe about a year ago, and have made it many times since.  Often, I'll tweak recipes I find, but this one is perfect.  My vegetarian friend now uses the glaze recipe for rice or tofu.

This was deeeeeelicious and what I classify as a "guest quality meal," meaning I will serve it to my dinner guests because it will surely impress them.  This is a keeper and highly recommended!  I didn't make any changes to the original recipe but may thicken the sauce next time.

Probably the easiest gourmet entree I have put on my table.  Chicken comes out gloriously moist, and the glaze just makes it even better.  I paired it with roasted potatoes and green beans so as not to steal the spotlight.  Even though maple syrup prices are through the roof, it was worth the real flavor in buying, and I found other recipes to use the rest of the syrup so it doesn't sit in my cabinet forever.

I thought I would try this out because of all the great reviews, but honestly it just wasn't that great.  It was edible, but the sauce was too weird tasting for me.  It literally tasted like orange juice and maple syrup, which combined with chicken isn't appealing to me.  We ate it, but I won't be making it again :(

This is a great recipie, the best part of it was that not only did my husband love it so did my 2 and 4 year olds.  My oldest said the whole house smelled like pancakes while it was cooking due to the syrup so she was won over from the start.    I had the same problem many others did with the sauce thickening.  I did not have anything on had to add to thicken is and it was still tasty, next time I will add corn starch.

I absolutely, completely loved this recipe. I had a hard time getting the glaze to thicken (I did use cheaper orange juice and substituted dilluted apple cider vinegar for the dry white wine) so I just added some corn syrup after removing chicken at the end. Everything ended up delicious, served over rice and the rice/glaze combination was wonderful!!! Will cook again!

WOW! this recipe sounded a bit odd when i read it but i took everyone's advice and gave it a try.i have an 8 year old and a very picky 10 year old,not to mention my picky husband.they ALL LOVED IT!they all want me to make it again soon and i will. it was great, not to hear "dinner is gross"!the only thing i did different was to exchange the wine for chicken broth and at the end remove chicken; add about a tablespoon of cornstarch into about 3 tablespoons of cold water and then added it to the boiling orange-maple sauce to thinken it. then put the chicken back in to serve.THIS IS GREAT!THANK YOU for the recipe!

Awesome, easy--and looks great, too.  I made it as written, but with real maple syrup because that's what the submitter of the recipe intended.  The only thing I did was to add cooking time to the sauce after the chicken was done.  I raised the temperature and reduced the sauce, without the lid, to a nice glaze.  This concentrates the flavor and makes a huge difference.  I loved it as written, but I might even try adding Asian chili paste for some heat if I'm in the mood for that.

I have to admit I was very sceptical about the combination of flavors in this recipe, but decided to trust the reviews. It's amazing! I used chicken stock instead of the wine (we don't drink) and thought it was just fine. Served with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable - very yummy and easy!

Excellent! Didn't add rosemary because I forgot but it didn't seem to matter.  Used turkey cutlets instead of chicken. Added sauce ingredients to saute pan to do the reduction instead of putting in another sauce pan.
Update 9/21/10:  Make sure the sauce has reduced and is syrupy before adding meat back to pan.  This time I put the meat in while the sauce was reducing and it made the meat too tough.

This is so good. The only sub I had to do was to not use real maple syrup. It was still great. Oh, and I used chicken tenders instead of breast. I can't wait to make this again.

I made this for my girlfriend and we both thoroughly enjoyed.  I followed the directions and even let the glaze cook longer in hopes it would reduce and become a little more glaze like.  It did not but it was still very good; made it with rice and used it as a sauce for the rice as well.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  This sauce was really tasty.  I followed another reviewer's advice to reserve a bit of orange juice to mix with cornstarch and add to the sauce halfway through, but I didn't need nearly as much as suggested and it still thickened up nicely.  My only suggestion is to use less butter & oil when cooking the chicken as it seemed a bit excessive.

I used the basic guidelines of this recipe to make my own version and my husband and I LOVE it! I make it ALL the time. I boil in a sauce pan the orange juice and white wine for 5 minutes then add the maple syrup and boil for another 5 minutes. Then I add the chicken cut up into bite size pieces and cook the chicken (stir-fry style). I add a tbsp. of soy sauce and more wine, maple and orange juice as needed! This is awesome!

Honestly, this was not what we were hoping for. I'm not very picky at all, but the sauce tasted really strong and had a peculiar flavor that was not pleasant, and we ended up just throwing it out.

Excellent recipe, very easy with surprising results. I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will double the glaze and soak it up with rice. This works well with dried rosemary, but fresh is the best.

If you don't have orange juice or oranges, try lemonade (or lemons), it works just as well

I just started cooking so I go on here to get ideas of things to cook. I must say this is one of my most favorite chicken recipes. I followed everything to the T and it came out great!

This was yummy!!! My hubby, 6yo and 2yo gobbled it all up!  I substituted chicken broth for the white wine as I didn't have that, and used thighs instead if breasts (we love thighs).  I served it with wild rice and green beans. We will have this again and again and

Absolutely outstanding!  I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I used dried rosemary from last summer's garden that I ground up into a powder with a mortar and pestle.  One suggestion is that you may need to adjust the cooking time based on the size of the chicken breasts.  The frozen, individually packed one's probably don't need to be cooked as long as this recipe calls for - you risk making them dry and rubbery.

The food was outstanding, thank you.  I am a cook in the US Army and were going to cook this on our valentine,s day meal.  If your glaze is to thin then use real maple syrup.  Not just flavored.Thank you its great!!

Oh my gosh this is SO GOOD! I found that I should have made double the amount of chicken, because my family couldn't get enough of it. It has been requested from my 2 kids who are opposite on everything they love. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers. I reduced the orange juice to 3/4 Cup, divided. I went ahead and added 1 Tblsp cornstarch to 1/4 C orange juice, and added that mixture to the glaze sauce simmering on the stove once I flipped the chicken over. I boiled it for about 3-5 minutes more, and the glaze thickened up beautifully. :D The glaze could actually work with 4-6  chicken breasts with this reduction depending on the size of the breasts. Lastly, I served this with white rice, green peas, and finished it off with a Chocolate Pudding Cake (served with vanilla ice cream) from this website. Enjoy!

This was good.  A little on the sweet side, but that's what I was in the mood for!  I added the cornstarch like others said to, let the sauce get nice and thick and sticky.  Will make again.

Very good! My husband and I loved it. Definitely add the cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. Try with Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes since you have the fresh rosemary on hand. It makes a great side dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very easy and fun to cook.  I would caution you to not use as much maple syrup as is required in the recipe instead of complimenting the chicken it ended up overpowering it.

Fantastic! Just finished it and it is a very good dish. The maple syrup adds a nice sweet subtle flavor that is very unique and very welcome. Would be very good with rice (sticky rice) and steamed green beans. This will be made again and again!

I decided to try something different for dinner, and I'm glad I did! Eveyone loved how sweet and savory it was, and it was so easy! If the souce got too runny I just added a bit of cornstarch and it turned out perfect.

Definitely a keeper! This recipe is fantastic. I followed to to the letter and it was wonderful. Very easy to make and delicious. I did not add cornstarch to the sauce and it still came out nice and thick. Maybe it was the cooking time. In any case, a wonderful blend of flavors. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last nite and did everything it said and the sauce was abit runny. The taste overall was good. I had to use abit more rosemary for the chicken.  My fiance liked the taste.I think next time I will let the sauce get thicker before adding to the chicken.

I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried.  I liked the way the rosemary flavored the chicken, but the chicken was pretty dry.  Also, even after adding cornstarch, the sauce was very thin.  If you make it, don't cover the dish while cooking as it adds moisture.  The sauce was ok.  Not a keeper.

Very moist and tender.  The orange flavor wasn't as noticeable as I first expected.  I also pounded the chicken thinner and used a little cornstarch in cold water to thicken the sauce.  Next time, I'm going to add ginger and lime for a little more variety.  I served this over rice with steamed carrots and asparagus.  It was very pretty and was a big hit for my dinner party.

No complaints. This was really easy to make and tasted really good. I did get a mallet and thin out the chicken breasts before cooking. I also added constarch as other cooks advised to thicken it up. I did not have fresh rosemary and used bottled rosemary. Tasted Great. Have fun cooking!

After reading other reviews I think I see what's wrong with directions. Simmer the chicken and sauce uncovered, it will reduce to a lovely glaze that both looks good and tastes wonderful. I also used dry rosemary and it worked fine. I'll do this again.

I am not a fan of maple syrup but I gave this recipe a try because of the great reviews. I am so glad I did! It was awesome.  I used parsley with just a touch of rosemary because rosemary upsets my stomach.  
I had one chicken breast left over and made chicken salad out of it with a little mayonnaise and mustard. No other spices were needed because it was so tasty by itself .
Thank you so much for this recipe!

the sauce was delish!I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used what i had on hand which was 4 thighs.  I squeezed 2 Cara cara oranges and 1/2 a lime, because I didn't have a carton of  OJ around. It made close to 1 cup, so I added a tiny bit of water until it made it to the 1 cup line.LOL  ( Well ya got to do what ya gotta do!)  It was so good, next time I'll  use 8 pieces of chicken so we can have leftovers.

Wow this is delicious! I didn’t have white wine on hand so I swapped for 1/4C chicken broth and a tablespoon of white vinegar to add some acid. Added a little more broth because the liquid burnt off a bit faster than my very thick breast halves cooked on the stovetop but otherwise made exactly as written. Can’t wait to try it with the wine. Thanks for the recipe!

It was good but not great. I will make it again. Used the other review using bite-sized chicken pieces. Added some pineapple that I had. Tasted kind of like my honey-mustard chix, even w/o the mustard.

Followed the recipe for making the Orange/wine Reduction and it didn't thicken as expected. Not sure if I didn't boil the sauce at intense enough heat long enough.  The sauce didn't really start thickening until after 20 minutes of simmering with the chicken. The chicken was still tender and overall tasted good.

I found this very tasty and  fairly easy to make but I felt the  20 minute s total cook time  for the breasts caused them to be dry and tough. The second issue was that the sauce mixture was double the amount needed for the 4 breasts I cooked . If I make this again I would cut the sauce ingredients in half (or if making the full amount, refrigerate half of it for another meal).

This was absolutely wonderful! The whole family enjoyed it. I used fresh juice from 2 navel oranges and the rest was Florida's Natural some pulp OJ. Used a chardonnay as the white wine, because we like to drink it alone! Used some chicken breasts and some chicken thighs (the meat was devoured!) Doubled the sauce and served over Uncle Ben's long grain original rice with broccoli as a vegetable! Yum!

This was great over jasmine rice!  The liquid did not reduce as much as I though it would, but it tasted great soaked up by the rice.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and did a light breading on them before cooking in skillet.  Also followed advice and added corn starch to 1/4 cup orange juice to add towards end.  Wasn't too sweet but wish I added a little spice for my personal taste.  Overall great, easy dish!  Made some mashed cauliflower to go with it.  Even better as leftovers!

Fantastic Dish, having a hard time getting the glaze. However, I let it boil a bit longer this time. This will be my third time making it.

I will probably make this again and use cornstarch as some have suggested.  The taste was great, but I didn't reduce the glaze enough, it was still a bit thin. Like another reviewer, I served with couscous and it was a hit.

We loved this!  I didn't have fresh Rosemary so I used a half Tbsp of dried.  All other items were as called for.  I did use  cornstarch as several other reviewers recommended and the sauce was perfect.  This made the chicken melt in your mouth delicious.   I can't wait to share this with my daughter.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a great recipe! It tastes absolutely delicious. The only thing I would change is add some more rosemary and after the 10 minutes of simmering the chicken I then remove the chicken and boil the glaze down so it is thicker and more flavorful. The boiling time in the recipe for the glaze just doesn't make it thicken it enough. Great recipe!

My wife and I were very surprised by how wonderful this dish tasted.  The only complaint was that the sauce didn't thicken into a glaze (I'm sure I just didn't reduce it enough initially).  I'll try again next time.  Helpful hint...instead of basting the chicken, I found it easier to just flip the chicken from time to time during its sauteeing process.  It worked quite well.

I followed the directions for cooking the chicken exactly and loved it!  I ended up boiling the sauce for an extra few minutes after taking the chicken out of the pan to allow the sauce to really thicken.  The end result was fabulous!

Surprisingly tasty! Was super nervous as the orange juice and maple syrup boiled. Did it without the the white wine and it still glazed over nicely and tasted great! Boyfriend and I were pleased.

It's probably my fault, but I made this and it came out smelling and tasting like breakfast food.  I prepared the recipe as is and wasn't particularly impressed.  Regardless, I will give it another shot.

This was a pleasant surprise for dinner last night.  I cooked the chicken in the glaze for longer than directed, which added both to the flavor & the tenderness of the meat.  While I have never used fresh rosemary in the past & was a little concerned about how STRONG the smell was, it was not at all overwhelming.  Rather, the rosemary & the maple/orange flavoring blended quite nicely.  Everyone loved it, even my picky eaters who balk at sweet mixed with savory.

This is one of the quickest and best recipes I have made.  It was a hit with everyone - from my 76 y/o father to my 16 y/o son.  Served with green beans and tiny potatoes sauteed in olive oil and seasoned with seasoned salt and roasted butternut squash.  Will make again and again.  Total time to table - 45 minutes!

Didn't have wine but it was oh so good. I served it with the skin-on mashed potatoes( this site) and pasta salad a la hubby. I gave my husband his plate and went to bring mine telling him not to wait on me. As soon as I returned he said it was delicious. It was very good.

The taste was great. Since I changed the serving size to 10 I don't think it came out the same as it would if I left it at 4.

It was pretty good, my wife liked it but I guess I'm just not a big rosemary fan. A little too overpowering taste for me. The overall idea of the orange juice and maple syrup is great, I should have just left out the rosemary.

I wondered about the maple flavor if it would be too sweet.  It was VERY sweet.  I think this would have been excellent without the maple at all.  But...then you'd have to change the name.  The orange and rosemary flavors worked well together.  If you don't like sweet, you won't like the maple.  I might try this again without it.

I made this tonight for my family had to double the recipe since its a big family but everyone loved it! Even my extremely picky husband! Only thing I will do differently next time is cut breasts into smaller slices to get the awesome flavor throughout the chicken and so it won't be as dry in center. I did have to simmer a little longer to get the glaze as thick as I wanted but I went by the recipe comlpetely without any alterations. Thanks for posting this!

WOW that is about the only thing that can describe this dish. My family eats a lot of chicken so I am always looking for a new recipe to try. This is one I am adding to my book. Amazing complex flavors and rich. Just amazing. If you like citrus you will just love this recipe.

Tried this dish for the first time and it was very tasty!  I would add corn starch to make the orange glaze thicker but this is a great dish...will make it again for guest now that I tried it with the family first!

Two things:  next time I'll make more of the rosemary coating; it was a bit scimpy.  Also,  the chicken couldn't brown properly with the pan covered...it steamed instead, so I left the cover off.  
With cornstarch to thicken the sauce, it was a really good recipe.  The chicken was very moist.

I liked it and it was a hit with my husband and one of my sons.....the other one is kinda overly picky. I served it with brown rice and garlic green beans from this site. I pounded the chicken out a little before seasoning cause the breasts were a little thick

DELICIOUS!!  Oh my, we were impressed with this one!!  I made half the recipe.  I boiled my orange juice/wine/maple syrup mixture in the afternoon and just let it sit on the stovetop until dinner.  Since my chicken breasts were small, I cooked them completely in the pan and removed them to a warm oven (no fear of over cooking them that way).  I then deglazed my pan with the orange juice mixture and let it reduce for a few minutes.  I did add just a small amount of cornstarch mixed with a little more orange juice to finish it off.  I was concerned that if I continued to reduce it, there wouldn’t be enough glaze remaining.  It was perfect!  Just the right amount of glaze to drizzle over the chicken breasts and some jasmine rice!  We’ll be making this one again!!!

We loved this!! The first two times I made it I left out the white wine and the rosemary as I didn't have any in the house. I made a bunch of brown rice and some mixed veggies and called it dinner. The entire family - including my super picky husband loved it! He has asked me to put it into the permanent recipe rotation - so it must have been super delicious to him! The second time I did double the sauce as I made extra rice and extra chicken... the next day we ate sandwiches made with the chicken and mixed the sauce with some mayonaise and good golly was it fantastic!! YUM!

My husband and I did not care for this dish very much, the flavor combination was a little odd for us. It tasted too much like eating plain syrup on chicken. I didn't splurge for the real maple syrup, so that was probably the problem, but it didn't show enough promise for me to try again, even with the real syrup.

My boyfriend can't stop talking about this chicken.  He loved it.  I made almost as the directions said and the only problem I had was getting it to glaze.  This could be because I had to use pancake syrup instead of maple syrup.  I am a very picky eater and the only problem I had with it was tasting the syrup with my chicken.  It weirded me out a bit.

Best. Chicken recipe. Ever. I'm a poor grad student, so I used just about every cringe-worthy substitution you can imagine (cheap cooking wine, dried rosemary, fake syrup, margarine...), and this still turned out better than almost any other chicken recipe I've tried, and it's easy to boot. The glaze IS very thin--I've tried thickening it with corn starch with limited success--but the flavor is phenomenal.

I used fresh thyme from my herb garden instead of rosemary and thighs instead of breasts.  While the thyme was a nice substitution the thighs were a bad idea - all the fat cooked out into the sauce, and although I tried to thicken the sauce with some cornstarch, I don't think it was the same result as if I had used breasts, will definitely stick with the breasts next time

Doubled all sauce ingredients and substituted chicken broth for wine.  Used good quality Grade B maple syrup from Vermont.  I also had to mix some cornstarch with orange juice to thicken sauce, adding near the end of cooking. Like another reviewer, cut chicken into thick lengthwise pieces so rosemary permeated all.

My son calls this the amazing chicken.  I double the sauce to use over rice and thicken it with corn starch. Like the originator of the recipe says, use real maple syrup. One of the best recipes on this site!

Fantastic recipe! I used skinless chicken drummers and thighs instead of breasts with amazing results. I also used a combination of real maple syrup and 15% real variety of fake maple syrup.

I'm disappointed by how this turned out. The sauce never thickened, even after simmering/boiling for quite some time. The orange masked the maple flavor (I had gone out to buy a bottle of real maple syrup, too). The chicken was dry after being on the stove for so long. I will not be making this again.

My husband loved it, but I was expecting more of a maple flavor. I served it Chinese-restaurant orange-chicken style, with steamed white rice and broccoli.

Totally loved this recipe! Only thing I changed was using dried rosemary instead of fresh, since that's what I had. Didn't have any problems getting the glaze to reduce and thicken, although I probably cooked it longer than stated before adding to the chicken. Also tasted great over the rice I served with it. I'll be making this one again!

Like everyone else, I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken and turn into a glaze and was out of cornstarch, but I will try it again using cornstarch as I liked the unique flavor.

Excellent recipe!  I actually used salmon instead of chicken.  Just because we were in the mood for salmon.  We only used 1 tablespoon of light margarine and that was it.  It came out great!!!  Thank you...

I prepared as written, using Chateau St. Michelle Erioca Reisling for the wine. The sauce would not thicken, so I added a cornstarch slurry. I served the chicken over pasta, and had carrots and peas for the veggies. This made plenty of sauce for the pasta and chicken. It was very tasty.

I made this last night and my husband couldn't get enough of it. It was very easy to make and really quick. The only changes I made were I did as another reviewer did and divided the orange juice to 3/4 and 1/4 cups so I could add 1-1/2 tab. cornstarch to the 1/4 cup to add at the end. This made the sauce a perfect thickness. I also added 2 Tab. honey to the 3/4 cup orange juice when it was being reduced down and 1/4 cup maple syrup. We're not that crazy about rosemary, so I only used 1 teas. Will definitely make this again.

I used 1/4c real Vermont Maple syrup and the sauce was perfect. It does not need any more maple syrup it would make it taste too sweet. Also I did not have any fresh rosemary so I used about 1tsp of dried rosemary. I recommend doubling the rosemary, salt and pepper rub.

We didn't care for this.  I made as written which I always do the first time to be fair to the author.  The juice never did reduce after a long time of simmering.  The orange juice flavor was too overpowering.

This was an outstanding dish!  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I followed some other suggestions and used pure maple syrup and a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I added a touch of flour to the chicken coating which really made the sauce stick, and I added a tablespoon of honey to the sauce to sweeten it.  Served with rice and some steamed veggies, this was awesome!

This recipe was very good, however there were some changes that I think would have made it better. I think if the chicken was pounded thin or sliced thin the flavors from the rosemary and the glaze would be more consistent through the chicken. Other than that the glaze was very tasty and worked very well with the rosemary. I followed the recipe exactly and had relatively good results. Thank you!

this dish is tasty and easy! i added more maple syrup though because i prefer my sauce a bit sweeter. i used dry rosemary because i didn't have fresh rosemary on hand and it was fine. i didn't have corn starch to thicken the sauce so i used flour instead. corn starch would have definitely been better but nonetheless a great easy dish that will impress your guests.

Simply amazing.  I took to heart the suggestion to serve it with white rice and asparagus, because it just so happened that they had asparagus on sale that week.  The only change I made was to replace the white wine with an equal amount of white grape juice and a dash of red wine vinegar.  But I would definitely make this recipe again.

I added a few things from another recipe that sounded great with this one as well. I added a couple tablespoons of honey to make the glaze a bit thicker and I added some garlic and crushed red pepper because I have to have everything spicier of course.

Wow, this one is a keeper. Make sure to use real maple syrup..the sauce boiled down nice and thick because of it.  Very sweet and sticky, yet has a tangy zip to it too. The perfect blend of flavors. Yum, yum, yum.

Tastes very good. I never really got a glaze, though. The sauce remained very liquid, no matter how long I boiled it. Could it be b/c I used fresh OJ?

This was fabulous!  I had a friend over for dinner and he said he felt like he was at a good restaurent.  What a compliment!  I did add some orange zest to the OJ like some other people mentioned.  It was all good.

Delicious! I didn't have white wine on hand so I omitted it. Sauce did stay a little thin, but it was great over rice.

Very good recipe and the taste is fantastic.  I give 4 stars because my sauce never thickened up, so it looked like I poured juice all over my plate (but was delicious when drizzled over cooked asparagus, which I served on the side) AND because I dirtied up almost every pan in my kitchen.  Be prepared to ask for help with the dishes!

Yummy, Yum, Yum!  This was soo good!  The only thing I did was add 1.5 tbsp of corn starch to thicken sauce.  Had extra sauce left over & jarred it for sweet & sour sauce.  Served it with steamed sugar snap peas & orzo. Perfect! & Fast!

I had friends over for dinner and everyone loved this recipie.  We just served it over plain white rice, it was a good mix.  None of us are wine drinkers, so I just left it out.  It still worked out great!

This was really good, very pretty dish too might I add!  Fairly simple...I had OJ in the fridge from breakfast the other day and all the other ingridients on hand.  I did not however use white wine (didn't have any open)...used chicken broth instead.  Yummy, will make again!

This was so, so good!  I fought my man for the leftovers and am so glad I won! I agree with others who have said that if you are patient, the sauce will thicken as I saw that happenening with mine but my chicken was done so I thickened it with oj and cornstarch...finger-licking good sauce... I literally swiped my finger across the pan and licked it before cleaning it!

I loved this recipe!  It was simple, quick, and the taste was roll your eyes into the back of your head good!!  I halved the recipe and cooked it uncovered for a bit longer then stated, and it glazed with just a bit of sauce to spoon over the chicken.  Mmmmm Mmmmmm Good!!!

My husband and I both really liked this delicious and easy-to-prepare chicken dish. I used 'real' maple syrup, halved the ingredients for the sauce, and removed the cover for the last few minutes of cooking. The sauce did turn out to be thicker than other reviewers have indicated (more syrupy than thickened, I'd say), and there was still lots to pour over the chicken.

This was so good!  I'm giving it a 5-star rating with a single problem, though.  The glaze didn't appear.  I even boiled it for 5 minutes more than instructed, and it was still more of a soup.  Oh well, it was still good :D

Best Chicken Dish EVER!!
Seriously, my husband asks for this dish at least once a month, and the best part is that it's so easy to make.  I always make it when we have guests because the chicken tastes so juicy and makes me look like a more amazing cook then I actually am.

Great Recipe. I didn't follow it exactly, due to what I had on hand. I substituted apple juice for the wine, and basil for the rosemary and it still came out delicious. Can't wait to try it again with the correct ingredients.

Like other reviewers, the "glaze" was not a glaze at all - more like a broth. I followed the directions exactly, using real maple syrup, and even tried adding a tablespoon of cornstarch during the sauce reduction time - to no avail.

This was just "ok."

Maybe it's that I need to use fresh-squeezed orange juice? It works well enough as an occasional dinner, but more acid and less sweet would help this dish out a bit.

Actually a 3.5 as is. It was too mapley!  I would make again and cut back on the maple syrup, maybe add orange zest to cut it?  Basically good, but need to cut the sweetness.  Grilled the chicken rather than fried, don't know if that made a difference, but added a small amount of rosemary, pepper and salt as it would have mixed in if fried.

This recipe had great flavors, but I was disappointed with the glaze. I felt like i kept it on the stove forever and it just wasnt thickening. I got so anxious to eat it that i pulled it off the stove before it got glaze-like. Still good, but next time will add some cornstarch or flour to help the process along.

this is really great! i really didn't know what to expect, since one, i am not a really experienced cook and 2, i had never tried to make this before. but my husband and i really enjoyed the chicken and especially the glaze. the glaze was a little hard to thicken, imo, and i didn't have any flour or anything to thicken it.....oh i know, what's a kitchen without flour lol.....but i added some cream cheese i had, used a whisk, and it thickened enough to add to the chicken. easy to make, and really great taste. thanks!

I wasn't able to get the glaze as thick as I would like, but it still tasted great.  I recommend the chicken to be served with buttery wild rice and asparagus.  Overall a simple yet delicious recipe!

Very good. The further you reduce the sauce, the more the maple flavor comes out. I used real maple syrup, rather than "fake" syrup with maple flavoring.

This sauce is fantastic! I used it on Pork chops and it was delicious. I actually used whatever syrup I had in the fridge for pancakes, and it still turned out really yummy! I left the sauce to simmer for a bit even after the chicken was done, and it thickened up very nicely. Makes for great leftovers too!

This recipe was easy to do! Although it feels like it took forever to turn into a glaze. I had to add a little flour and water mix to get it to thicken up faster. My dinner guests were so delighted with the taste I had to give the recipe as a parting gift!

We just finished this delectable dish and when I said I was going to come rate this recipe, the boyfriend yelled in the background "A+! A++++++++++++ GREAT FIRE!"

I guess that's a sign that this dish is pretty good, considering we're pretty picky people ;)

I used real maple syrup as well and had to reduce the glaze just a tad in the end. I was slightly turned off by the strong wine smell (I used Chinese Cooking Wine) but the flavor was rich and good. Will be making this again, though, as the boyfriend is saying he wants this again next weekend. 

Oh well! :)

This was an AMAZING recipe!! My husband and I cooked this together and enjoyed the outcome. We paired this with sauteed garlic asparagus. (even though he burned those)  This has become our favorite "romantic dinner" to make after the kids have gone to bed. We give this a 5 star.      The only complant is deciding who is going to get to eat the left overs......

This was good....  I think I expected "more" flavor and perhaps will test more rosemary or some alternate seasoning on the chicken.  I did add cornstarch to the last 1/4 cup of orange juice and added it to the orange/maple mixture when I turned the chicken over. My husband referred to it as almost a Hawaiian taste. I'm going to experiment more - maybe pineapple juice & bits (would be nice in the summer) or adding some ginger.  I served with rice and green peas.  My two children liked it. I'll try couscous next time.

Very tasty recipe! It was quick, easy and tasty...what more could you ask for! 
The only change I would recommend is putting the chicken seasonings Rosemary, salt and pepper) on a plate instead of a bowl. That was the seasonings can be spread out and get more evenly distributed on each chicken breast, instead of ending up on the fist one, lol. I'll definitely be keeping this one on had for when I need a quick, flavorful dinner...even the kids liked it! :)

tastes great and so easy to make! i just find it easier to sprinkle the spices a little more generously on the chicken itself in the pan. i also like to cook the chicken a little longer and hotter in the orange-maple syrup so it soaks into the meat better.

This recipe was well received by my husband and son as well as myself.  I did thicken the glaze near the end of the cooking so the glaze covered the finished chicken.   Next time I make this, I plan to increase the sauce and drizzle it over certain vegetables.  Yum yum       Pam E.

MY family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was sweet and the glaze really turned out well, although it was a little thin (my bad). Make sure that you save some of the orange juice for the corn starch or it will clump up in the glaze and you will need to strain it out later (a pain in the back). All in alll a great recipe and not as complicated as it looks.

This was a pretty tasty change of pace. We will most likely never make it again, as orange juice and maple syrup aren't typically things I have on hand, but it was worth going out to buy those ingredients to make it. I couldn't get the sauce to quite the consistency I wanted, so I added some cornstarch until it had more a jelly-like consistency. I liked it that way, since it stayed on the chicken a lot better than a thinner sauce would have.

Oh my goodness... this was wonderful!  I have been in a recipe rut lately, and was digging around this site for something different to serve at a girlfriend's dinner to celebrate a birthday. Not only did this sound yummy, but also simple, which would not have me stuck in the kitchen. I made it with sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts,and it was a HUGE hit. The girls loved it,as did my husband. It made for a beautiful and elegant dinner without hours in the kitchen. This one definitely goes to the front of my cookbook and will be made again and again. Thanks for sharing!

just great!  Like others, I would highly recommend using a corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce. I added orange zest, and it was a little bitter, so be cautious on that, if you're going to add.

Fed to a family/group of seven from teenagers down to a seven-yr-old, and everyone enjoyed this chicken,and this is not an easy-to-please bunch! The glaze was more like a marinade and was not too strong or too sweet.

This was wonderful and very easy to make. I used fresh orange for the glaze and light syrup. I actually used frozen chicken breast (I will let thaw completely next time) I used a low fat butter I also did not use oil I simply spayed the pan with a cooking spray. I served it with mashed potatoes. Even with these few changes to make it even healthier this was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever made!!!!!!! Wonderfully delicious! Husband loved it, I will make again.

This recipe was fantastic!  I followed the recipe to the letter and I have no complaints whatsoever.  As to the sauce consistancy, I have a child and maybe since I wasn't as attentive to cooking dinner, the sauce thickened!  This recipe is definately a keeper.

The flavor wasn't bad but we were a little dissapointed is the thickening of the glaze or lack there of, even adding cornstarch it still didn't thicken very well..Rachel

For chicken lovers this is quick and easy diversion from the average chicken dish. Great sweet, refreshing flavor.

I added a tablespoon more maple syurp and this turned out great! My boyfriend loved it, and he's the pickiest eater ever!

This was delicious!  Didn't have any wine, but I did add about 1/4 cup sweet orange marmalade after the chicken had been in the sauce for a bit.  The sauce was great on rice, though I do think I'll add a bit of cornstarch next time to really make it into more of a glaze.  But everyone loved it and I'll definitely make it again!

Tasty and easy to make.  Ran out of white wine so I used vermouth instead.  The family agreed it was "a keeper".

I gave this only three stars as half liked it, the other half didn't. I was on the side that didn't care for it much. I found it cloyingly sweet. Those with a sweet tooth will love it. The sauce was definitely too thin, so I used the other reviewer's cornstarch suggestion. Worked well.  I may not repeat this dish--only if requested by those who liked it.

I liked but my husband felt it was just too sweet.  I used less OJ and thickened to a nice sauce. I'd make again, but it isn't guest worthy.  It is good, but not sensational.
