Yum! I didn't have sweet relish on hand so I used dill relish and doubled it to 4 tbsp. Didn't have green onion so I used 1/4-1/2 tsp onion powder. Because I can't help myself, I also added a dash of lemon juice and 1.5 tbsp minced garlic, a pinch of kosher salt, and a few small dashes of cayenne. I think the red wine vinegar makes this recipe. The fat free mayo was so sugary, but with this recipe it's transformed. I highly recommend it!

Great recipe. I made at the last minute and did a bunch of alterations and it still tasted great! I had fat-free mayo, added 1 baby dill pickle diced with juice, onion powder, a dash of lemon juice, cayaenne pepper and vinegar and ate it right then. Yum!

This was excellent!  I used a teaspoon of onion flakes instead of the green onion.  Went great with my blackened tilapia.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  The only change I made was to use no sugar added relish to cut a few more calories and it was still great.  Does not taste low calorie at all.  In fact, it tastes like it would have tons of calories.  Pair it with grilled or broiled fish and you have an extremely low cal dinner.

All I can say was it was not that good for us...the red wine vinegar got lost in the mayo. I really can say, I won't make this again. Too sweet. Tasted of sweet mayo, with a crunch. Sorry. I followed it like a T.

This is really delicious -- a little sweet and a little tangy -- and so easy. A dash of salt made it even better. I'm a huge fan of tartar sauce but never seem to have it on hand when I want it. What's extra great about this is it uses ingredients I usually have on hand, so I can whip up a batch whenever needed. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I know the recipe is fab as written; but I had to make adjustments based on what I had.  I used dill reslish, some onion powder and a little sugar to soften the blow of the dill relish.  I was actually shocked at how good it tasted.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is very similar to my own recipe only I use 1/2 low-fat mayo and 1/2 low-fat sour cream and also add some old bay seasoning to taste.  The vinegar is great and has lots of health benefits!

Very nice, very easy.  I didn't have green onions so I just subbed a little dried minced onion and onion powder.  Worked well enough!  I didn't refrigerate it and it was still good with fish sticks.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

This was surprisingly good!  I normally dislike certain condiments that are fat free, they need to be at least lite for me to like.  This with the fat free mayo was great!  I did like the taste better using lite mayo in this.  But it still tasted good with the fat free as well.  I did add just a touch more relish and a dash of dill seasoning.  This has the zip and tang that I like out of my tartar sauces.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I was looking for a quick tartar sauce recipe since ours had expired (oops!) and we had leftover fish. I didn't have green onion on hand, and I didn't measure the mayo, relish, and red wine vinegar, but this was still so tasty! I look forward to actually measuring my ingredients. Thanks! You saved my leftovers.

Nice alternative to store bought tartar sauce and without the guilt indeed. Tasted it and felt it needed something. Added fresh dill and 2 cloves minced garlic to perk up the flavour . This made it a 5 star with us.

I use this recipe all the time with a few minor changes. I use low-fat mayo and omit the red wine vinegar, adding 1 tsp. lemon juice and a dash or two of dill seed (slightly pulverized with a mortar and pestle).  If I am out of green onions, I finally chop a yellow or white onion.  Never tried dill relish - I always use sweet - but that does sound good.

I used Miracle Whip instead of fat free mayo, substituted lime juice for the pickle relish and left out the onion. Didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I put in 1/2 tsp distilled white cane vinegar and 1/4 tsp pepper. My family loved it!

Even better with dill pickle relish.  I also used 4T instead of 2 because my family really loves relish.
