There is something called "Dalia" available in Indian stores which is basically roasted split chickpeas. Adds a lot to taste and also some curry leaves.

I used 1 dried red chili pepper instead of the fresh kind, and loved this!  Next time I will definitely try to get the fresh peppers!

I like blending the coconut with a little water, grated ginger, minced green chilis and salt. Then in a pan I roast some urad dal, dry whole red chili, curry leaves, and black mustard seeds. I mix t g is in as tempering before serving with some dosas and sambhar.
