I made as written except that I took a shortcut by using real bacon bits instead. I would have preferred the turkey bacon but I didn't have any on hand and decided to make this last minute. I LOVED the additional of the dry ranch and I loved the fact that no milk was needed. Swanson broth has such a rich flavor that I didn't even miss the butter either. Thanks for a great recipe Missy!

These potatoes were so rich and flavorful!  If you've made loaded mashed potatoes in the past and have been left flat.  Try these!

This was so yummy!  It was just my husband and I so I halved the amount of potatoes and ranch dressing mix.  Definitely going to make this again when company comes over!

Great recipe! Cooked my potatoes in pressure cooker to be done in 16 minutes rather than boiling for a long time. Also added more bacon, more cheese and sour cream, but it was awesome

My husband isn't huge on the bacon bits or turkey bacon in his spuds so I did skip the bacon but I made it like the rest said the first time and everyone loved it. On my second go I decided to make it similar to one of my other favorites with not peeling the potatoes and it was perfect either way. I think my kids liked the skins in it version a little more but both are perfect and are now a family favorite. Even my most picky eater loves the potatoes and wants them all the time. We prefer with Salisbury steaks or our Brown sugar meatloaf. Enjoy!

So I made these Loaded Potatoes but only used about 5 medium/large potatoes. I added half that ranch seasoning and thought it tasted amazing! So I mistakenly added the rest.... overwhelming! Whoops! Haha but besides my mistake these potatoes were great and flavorful. My favorite part was probably the boiling in the chicken broth.

So flavorful! I didn't use the low sodium options, but followed the rest to a Train, and was very impressed.
