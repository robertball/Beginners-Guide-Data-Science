I would give this more stars if I could!  It's absolutely delicious!  I went ahead and used two pkgs. of cream cheese since other reviewers said it wasn't enough of a cream cheese layer.  To this I added the called-for amounts of eggs and vanilla, and I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of the remaining 1/2 cup and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe I'll be making often!

A quick and easy recipe. I also used 2 packages of cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar in the batter. I increased baking time to 30 minutes. Chopped pecans on top makes for a nice presentation and adds extra crunch. Oh, and did I mention this won first place in my husband's company's contest? LOL Thanks for a great recipe!

this is an easy, but very delicious dessert.  i used the blueberry pie filling, but you could use any tiype of pie filling you like or even mix pie fillings to make the recipe different every time you make it.

I followed the double cream cheese recommendations but didn't have a blueberry pie filling.  I used a pint of fresh blueberries - just spread them evenly on the cooled cream cheese layer, then added the cool whip.  It was DELICIOUS! I'm planning to do the same with fresh strawberries.

This dessert is so yummy.  I made it for the first time last night and brought it to a church luncheon today.  I made it as others suggested, using two 8-oz. pkgs. of cream cheese and 3/4 cup of sugar.  I would make it this way again!  It went so fast that I almost didn't even get a chance to taste it.  I'll have to make it again just to get a decent size servicing. :)  Everyone loved it and a visitor even asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!!!

I made this after my mother-in-law made one similar, this was what I could find. My husband loves it, said it was better than his mom's! I did use two boxes of cream chesse and 3/4 c sugar also, it helped! I also think that next time I will use two cans of pie filling for a thicker layer. Good stuff!!

Yummy!  I brought this to a potluck, and everyone loved it.  I had to pass out the recipe afterwards.  The only suggestion I would make, is that I might add more cream cheese next time.  The layer of cream cheese was very thin, but it was still yummy.

This was a hit with my husband and in-laws.  I used strawberry pie filling instead (personal preference) and it was still really good.  I doubled the cream cheese per some of the other reviews and I think it took a little longer to cook, but it was worth it to have the extra creaminess.  Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely fantastic.  I followed other recommendations and doubled cream cheese and used 3/4 cup sugar.  Can't wait to get another chance to WOW people with this easy, delicious dessert!  Everyone asked for the recipe, too!

I had this recipe several years ago, from a Taste of Home magazine and lost it! I am so glad to have it back! It has always been a hit, the cinnamon makes it special.  I had never tried 2 bricks of cream cheese, but now will never go back to one! And I did add the extra sugar as well.  Even if you are not a blueberry fan, do not be afraid to try this recipe.  I have heard many times, "I don't even like blueberries, but that is AWESOME"!!!

Awesome, I also did 2 cream cheese with the 3/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs and 1 t. vanilla like suggested and everyone loved it. It was on a dessert buffet and the first pan to be emptied. I needed to bake it a little longer due to the extra cream cheese.

I've been making this one for quite a while. Found essentially the same recipe in an old "band boosters" cookbook of my mothers and first made it for a bridal shower. Misplaced it somewhere over the years and was thrilled to find this one. Based on other reviews, I used 2 8-oz. pgks of cream cheese, then doubled the eggs and used only about 3/4 of the "doubled" sugar.  (also used a "Splenda clone" in the crust -- worked well.)  With the pie-filling, it was still plenty sweet. Over-all, very satisfying.  Made it most-recently for a SuperBowl party and it seems to go over well.  Thanks for reuniting me with this recipe!

Loved it! It's so delicious and you can easily switch up the blueberries for other berries. Instead of pie filling I used fresh blueberries (because they were on sale) and mixed them with blackberry syrup.

I made a couple changes but I would still give it five without. I also did like everyone else with the 3/4 sugar and extra cream cheese. I crushed up vanilla wafers for the crust and then also sliced up strawberries and laid them on top of the blueberry. then i used heavy whipping cream and made my own whipped cream instead of cool whip. it is sooo yummy
