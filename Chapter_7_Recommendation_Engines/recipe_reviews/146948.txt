This was excellent! I didn't have enough green onions so I substituted red onion. Wouldn't change a thing!

Very nice salad, but I halved the dressing/sauce and felt there was plenty. I also used brown sugar (to taste) rather than Splenda. I added carrots and snow peas for some extra colour and flavours.
It was really enjoyed.

I've have a recipe very similar to this and let me tell you -- the secret ingredient (that's missing from here) is shallots. One time I forgot the shallots and decided to go on and make the dish, and it totally fell short of what it usually taste like. So yes, one heaping cup of shallots goes in with the mix. And use regular sugar...
