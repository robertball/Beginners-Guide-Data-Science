I made this recipe and it's not bad, but it's not quite to my liking so I'll play with the ingredients a bit.  It was nice to try a simple recipe for one person.

I love the balance between the sweet sugar and soy sauce. In other recipes i find there's too much of either one and it throws off the recipe. Ling ling approved
