I thought these were great cookies! I used a bag of dried mango/pineapple/papaya that i had left over from something else, in place of just the mango and i did not use dried cranberries. They were really good. I needed to cook them more about 16 min than 10 min but not a big deal. It takes time to wait for them to cool before you can take them off, so make sure you have time to finish them before an event.

Not bad at all.  I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the shortening -- texture was perfect -- and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup (next time, I might reduce the brown sugar instead, to 1/2 cup, since I feel like a mango cookie should be a little lighter-colored than these turned out).  Also doubled the mango, and left out the nuts and cranberries; next time I might add even more mango, since the bites that didn't have any were not terribly interesting.  Finally, like other reviewers, I had to bake for 15-16 minutes, even though my cookies were small enough that I got about 4.5 dozen out of the batch.

I read here that somebody exchanged the shortening for applesauce - so, I decided to try exchanging it for pureed mango. I added a little bit of coconut oil, as well. BEAUTIFUL!

I needed to cook a little bit longer, & would probably add more mango the next time but other wise a GREAT cookie! Different & easy to make!

Delicious! I left out the cranberries and doubled the mango though.  So good!

The base for the cookie is pretty good, although I don't know that I would use Crisco again.  I thought the macademia nuts kinda tasted like peanuts, which made them seem a little wasted to me, since eating them plain tastes very little like peanuts.  I couldn't really taste the mango.  I think these cookies are a lot like the chewy coconut cookies, only with more work.  As I said, the base to the cookie is very good, but I would tend to leave out everything but the coconut.

Not worth the work!  Unfortunately, these were a lot of work and nobody enjoyed them.  They were very cakey and the mango flavor just didn't come through.  We will not be making these again.

These were wonderful. Like many, I skipped the cranberries and replaced with more chopped mangoes instead. Try to keep the mango pieces on the bigger side...otherwise they will get lost. Do not skip on macadamian nuts, as they really add a great taste to the cookie.

Used 3 ripe mangos and should have left out the OJ and probably the lard as well. The mangos added so much moisture they never came close to firming up properly.  Will try it again making these changes. Also omitted the nuts. Macadamias are to good on their own and to expensive to put in cookies.

Super good. Better the next day. Good with either natural shaved or sweetened cooking coconut.

This was a pretty good recipe besides the fact that you left out the vanilla. But I think the orange was a little faint. I am going to try adding in pineapple juice with the mango and see how that tastes.

If I could give it more stars, I would. These are AMAZING. I made some adjustments too. I ommitted the  cranberries, I used dried mango, dried pineapple, and some trail mix bag 
I found that contains papaya, bananas, mango, raisins and
 shaved coconut.....mixing all of these together in the orange juice. I changed the oven setting to 350 and baked for 12 minutes (gas stove). West coast of Florida elevation.
