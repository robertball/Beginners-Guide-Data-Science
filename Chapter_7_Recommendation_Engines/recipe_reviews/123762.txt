Ok, being the first to review this recipe, I don't want to give any wrong ideas of these beans, so I'll do my best!  They definitely  are different than the beans I usually eat, as they are barbecued beans, not baked beans.  I had to keep reminding myself to not compare the two, because if you do that, you'll be very disappointed!  That being said, although I don't want to make them taste just like baked beans, I think the flavor could be a little more-something.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but maybe something to make it taste MORE bbq flavored.  I did enjoy these beans, they just weren't 'party in my mouth' good, although I think there is that potential!  I will try these again, and now that I've reviewed the original recipe, I will try different ways to make them five stars.
