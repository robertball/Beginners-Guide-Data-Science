Very tasty and perfect for low-carbers or keto-dieters! I halved the recipe and used a 8 x 8 dish, which worked out perfectly. I highly recommend at least doubling the salt as it's a bit on the bland side without. I used my own thickener, as suggested in the cook's notes since I don't like the results from using almond flour - it tends to make things gritty.  Instead, I sprinkled about 1/2 tsp of konjac flour over top of the meat mixture in the pan, then stirred it all together. I also highly recommend cooking the vegetables first, then placing into a bowl, then cooking the meat mixture on its own, and combining everything back into the pan. Otherwise, the pan will be overcrowded and the meat will just steam. To save time, you could buy premade frozen mashed cauliflower, thaw it, then spread over top of the zucchini. You could also just steam your own cauliflower florets, then mash it yourself. Just make sure that no matter what cauliflower you use, it is well drained. I'll be making this again, as it makes the perfect leftovers for my work lunches!

We really liked this dish. The only thing I did differently, was added some shredded Gouda cheese, since I had a dish very similar to this, in Amsterdam. It sort of tasted like lasagna, except no noodles. :)

This was better than I thought it could be. I didn't have zuccini, but I had okra and used that. I will make this again.

To speed up the prep, I used pre-made mashed cauliflower and frozen mixture of carrots, onions, and celery. Recipe turned out pretty well...even the picky kids liked it.

A bit low on flavor, I added carrots, but next time would also add some spices. would make it again.

Iâ€™ve never been a fan of shepherds pie but loved this one with cauliflower mash on top.  I will definitely make it again.
