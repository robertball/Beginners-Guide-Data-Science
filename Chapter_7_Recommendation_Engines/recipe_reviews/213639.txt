Husband absolutely loved it! Apart from using fresh dill instead of dried, I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. Next time I'll add more Parmesan - 1/4 cup wasn't cheesy enough for us!

exelent recipe!!!! only I added more garlic and regular black pepper. Even though the garlic turned blue (because of the lemon juice) and the salmon broke up when I turned it.. but who cares!!!.it all goes doen the same way!!! Next time I will cook the garlic a little before adding the lemon! and maybe cook at a higher heat, less time so the salmon won't break up!!! It was great nevertheless

The flavors in this recipe were good but the proportions and cooking time are off. My salmon fillet was thicker than typical but was almost done when I flipped it and was certainly done less than three minutes later and by then the asparagus was over cooked. I would suggest not adding the asparagus until flipping the salmon - and do that much sooner than called for. Also 1/4 cup olive oil is way too much. I used it but next time would use closer to 1 Tablespoon. And 1 1/2 cups cream yields way too much sauce for the salmon and pasta. I used about 3/4 cup and that was more than enough. As written, the recipe yields an overcooked heavy dish. With some tweaks to make it lighter and fresher it could be great.

Dreamy sauce! I doubled for 4 servings, but found that I did not need to double the oil and cream and still had plenty of  sauce. I used light cream instead of heavy. (as in the title of the recipe!) Don't skimp on the garlic and lemon--you'll love it.

I had some leftover baked salmon that I wanted to use.  I shredded it up and used it in place of the new, fresh salmon.  It was fast, turned out delicious, and I didn't have to throw out my salmon.  Great recipe!

We loved this! I was low on ingredients so I typed in what little I did have in the house, and this popped up.  I didn't have the cream, though, so I used some jarred Bertolli alfredo sauce instead, and it was still delicious! The salmon and asparagus had wonderful flavor.

I used chicken instead of salmon and parsley instead of dill.  This dish is amazing!! Making these changes makes it my favorite meal and is great for guests.

OMG 5+ stars! This is the best recipe! Mouth popping flavors.  I had fresh salmon, asparagus and wanted to make a pasta dish.  I am so glad this recipe was here.  The sauce was great! I wanted a thicker sauce, so I added a little flour.  This is a keeper.  Thank you to twroush02!

I did this a little differently because of what I had on hand. I used zucchini instead of asparagus and I used about 3/4 whole milk with about 1/4 cup light mayo in place of the cream. I also used about 1/3 cup shredded cheddar instead.

This was amazing!  I didn't have lemons or lemon juice on hand, so I substituted lemonade, and it turned out beautifully!  I also added half a package of cream cheese to the sauce to give it a better consistency.  I will be making this again!

Great flavor and nice dinner. We did have to play with the sauce a bit, as we didn't have heavy cream, only half & half.  Following the recipe, the half & half didn't make a very nice-looking sauce, so made another batch of sauce with the half & half, starting off with a butter/flour roux.  Mixed the sauces together and it was a great dinner.  We were able to cook two 1/2lb salmon fillets in a 12" skillet with one bunch of asparagus.

Great recipe, though I adjusted here and there to reduce the calorie amount, and to work around the recipes I have in hand at home. 
1) I didn't have heavy cream nor do I want to use one, I use the reduced fat milk I had in the fridge.

When cooking salmon and asparagus, I left out the garlic to make gravy for later use. After I scooped up salmon and asparagus to a warm plate, I added garlic and lightly browned them. Once browned, I added a tablespoon of flour, let it soak up the juice, and when done, I added some white wine, milk and water to thicken the sauce. And when the sauce got thicken, is when I mixed all the rest of the ingredients. 

Though, I didn't use up the rest of the recipes like cheese, dried dill, or heavy cream, this came out delicious and with whole lots of less calories than what original recipe calls for. Parsley did just fine in replace of dill! 

I will make this again and again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

awesome recipe!!! My boyfriend has been begging me to make a salmon dinner but I'm not a huge fan generally.  We both loved this dish.  The salmon tasted great, and the sauce was fantastic!!!  Will definitly be making this again.

This was really tasty! I didn't have cream, so I used whole milk and a dollop of cream cheese instead. I've only baked salmon in the oven before, but I think I'm going to start cooking on the stovetop more frequently because it took half the time and tasted just as good. I also liked that it was a one-pan dish, using the left-over salmon oil to make the sauce.

I made this tonight and it was really good.  I read the reviews to see if anyone had tried to reduce the fat and substituted anything for the heavy cream.  The one cook made it with lowfat evap. milk but I didn't think that would taste as well.  So I used a jar of Ragu Creamy roasted garlic and Parmesan sauce which only has 10 grams of fat per serving.  I used about 1/3 of a jar and it was delicious.  My hubby loved it, he is still raving over it and said I need to make it when we have company!

so the story goes that I had had  a successful sushi night the previous weekend.  As always, I had some Salmon left over, and to hell with letting good fish go to the way side.  I found this recipe and tried it on a whim, as I had most of the supplies on hand.  WOW!!!  now I did make a few changes, I turned the cream sauce into a cheese sauce adding a little velvetta subb'd in for the milk, as well as the addition of diced onion and Chopped Carrot.  I mean, WOWOWOW!!!  the Onions and the carrots gave the recipe a beautiful color and did add to the overall flavor.  really a Great Fish recipe!  Highly recommend it

I followed the recipe, but did add extra cheese. My husband, who does not like fish, absolutely loved it.  A definite keeper and it would be something I would love to serve to company.  The colors and taste were remarkable.

I love a rich cream sauce, but holy Heavy Cream! I had to double the recipe for my family, which meant.....3 cups of heavy cream! And 1/2 cup of olive oil. 

I might play with the recipe next time, baking the salmon and asparagus in a little oo , salt and pepper, and lemon slices, and then try the sauce with 1/2 the cream. (I know. I will miss the taste, but the other missus and I need to watch our calories.) 

Does anyone have a good suggestion to make this recipe a little lighter on the calories?

I substituted half and half for the caloric cream, and used  leftover salmon, which worked well. But next time I’d add lemon zest, and use/ top with fresh dill to give it more flavor.

Exceptionally bland. My only substitution was using fresh dill instead of the dried dill that the recipe called for, and I can't imagine that that would have made a big difference. My husband and I agreed that the salmon itself was cooked perfectly, and the asparagus and garlic too. Our conclusion was that it would have been good without the pasta and without the cream sauce. It would have made a nice, simple, not heavy dish if we had done it that way. So cut out step one and step three, and you'll be glad you did.
