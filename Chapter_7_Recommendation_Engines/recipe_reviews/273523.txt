I needed to add an additional 5 minutes of cooking time for my cauliflower to be crisp-tender. Other than that, I made this as directed. I really liked how the browned butter added a nutty flavor to this. We usually just use olive oil when roasting veggies, but I might need to re-think that in the future. Not sold on the mint in here, but we enjoyed it. I think if I was to make it again, I'd skip the mint, and maybe add some basil instead.

The mint and red onion with lemon added a wonderful twist to the roasted Cauliflower.
