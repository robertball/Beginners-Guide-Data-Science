I am one of the creators of this recipe. I made it again tonight with a couple of adjustments and it was better than the original. Here is what I did:  Line your sheet pan with parchment to avoid sticking. Brush both sides of the potato slice with oil and season with salt & pepper. Cook as directed. 
First, brown your sausage in a skillet (I used spicy pork sausage, so I omitted the chipotles). Drain sausage on paper towels & remove most of the grease from the skillet. To the skillet, add one clove of minced garlic along with onion, bell peppers and mushrooms. Saut√© until cooked to your liking.
Tip cooked potato slices with sausage, onion mixture and sprinkle with cheese. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. 
This was a complete meal & definitely not just for breakfast!

02.03.17 ~ Loved this meal. Made this on a chilly Friday night and it really hit the spot. I skipped the mushrooms and added some yellow bell pepper in its place. My DH thought this meal was great and filling. I only added fresh sliced cucumbers to round out our meal. Really happy we tried this meal.
