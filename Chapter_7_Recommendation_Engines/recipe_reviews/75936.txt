This was fantastic with a few additions! Like another reviewer, I added the puree from an acorn squash. I also doubled the spices with the exception of the cayenne pepper.  It seemed still to be lacking something, so I tried a small amount with some finely ground rosemary. What a finish!! One word about the ingredient list.  Even I, a seasoned (no pun intended)cook was momentarily confused by the listing--2 (49.5 oz) cans of chicken stock; and further interested in how the 49.5 oz. was arrived at since no combination of the popular can/box sizes (14, 28, 32 oz.) would total that amount.  I settled for a 14 oz. can and a 32 oz. box of vegetable stock to good results.  Who's going to quibble over 3.5 oz. anyway?

This is a delicious soup, but I used two apples instead of the potatoes for even more flavor.

I've been using this recipe for over a year now, about time I rated!  This is the most wonderful soup in the universe.  It makes so much, but I never have to throw a bit away, it always gets eaten.  The only thing I do differently is use sweet potatoes in lieu of the white potatoes.  Thanks so much for this wonderful comfort soup.

Delicious!  Took to a party, and everyone raved!  I think using milk would lower the fat and be just as yummy.

***By the way, I did not use as much broth as the recipe calls for...I probably used half as much!  Start with maybe 4 cups broth then add to your desired taste and consistency.

Excellent flavor and texture!  I halved the recipe and it worked just fine, although I'm not a stickler for measuring.  Because my squash was large, I cooked it longer than recommended so it would be really soft.  The blender puree is a necessary step - don't just mash it you'll miss out on the smooth texture of the soup.  Also, the sherry and cream really add a depth of flavor. For seasonings, I skipped the cayenne pepper and added a bit of cinnamon instead. Also, I used course ground black pepper, but found it distracting with the pure texture/color of the soup. Next time I'll use fine white pepper instead.

Wow!!!  Definitely cook the squash long enough and puree it long enough.  You need to make sure the little bumps are all out...SO creamy.  I even pureed it again after adding the half & half and sherry.  I didn't change a thing (all 50 oz of chicken stock) and the sour cream added to the bowl was a great idea!  I tried making another recipe once and it was average at best.  THIS is FABULOUS!  My husband was very impressed with the "Now this is GOOD" grunt upon devouring.  One kid ate it...the other didn't.  Who knows?  Couldn't stop eating it.  Thank you!

Very good! I omitted the allspice and topped mine with parmesan, fresh basil and roasted hazelnuts. Will also try the sour cream garnish with the leftover soup (of which there is very little). Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is fabulous!  I have made it for several large groups and everyone always goes back for seconds.  To save time and effort I recommend buying pre-cut Butternut Squash, as those things are a pain to cut.  Trader Joe's sells one pound bags in the produce section.

A nice savory soup.  I doubled the spices to suit my taste.  The flavor doesn't scream squash at you, just a nice mild taste.  Makes a whole lot!

I love getting spiced butternut at restaurants so when I decided to make some this ended up being a good base. I took some advice from previous reviews and made these changes:

1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon all other spices
No russet potatoes--- instead 1 yam and 1 apple
Silk brand of Almond milk instead of half and half and 2 cups
Only 4 cups of chicken broth

I like a lot of spice to my food so upping the spices was just a hands-down-must. Going with the yam and apple just seemed to be a favorite of people on here and I went that way. I used almond milk since I'm lactose intolerant and it is still fairly thick (Silk brand that is) and taking that to two cups smoothed it very nicely while only four cups of chicken brother helped bring down the liquid.

I baked the squash, but then cut everything and put it in my slow cooker for ten hours while stirring it occasionally and using my hand blender at the final hour mark. For this size of the recipe using a 6+ quart slow cooker would be ideal.

With these variations I LOVE it!

With the spices doubled, this is a lovely and flavorful recipe that really warms you up. I substituted orange juice for the sherry, and the sweetness rounded off the nutmeg and allspice flavors well. Delicious with garlic croutons.

Love Love Love it.  I made this three times this summer and that is unusual for me.  My daughter started making it too.  Thanks LuvMyFamily.  I couldn't believe I forgot to rate this earlier this summer.  I had some extra cooked carrots and threw them in with the soup too.  I swear I can see better every time I eat this soup!

Just made this soup and honestly is the best I have ever tasted!  A couple of changes to the original recipe:  I skipped the sherry; used 1/2 homemade chicken broth and 1/2 homemade veggie broth; doubled the spices, and used only 4 ounces of half & half.  The result was absolutely delicious.  I made enough to freeze for use in the coming weeks.  This will be a nice soup to have on a rainy day!  I plan to serve this with crusty wheat french bread, and a side dish of sliced pears with a light balsamic vinagrette and topped with candied walnuts and freshly shaved parmesan.  THE BEST!

Lovely!  I took several of the suggestions by others here.  Used a large yam instead of potatoes, and doubled the spices.  In addition, I skipped the oven step for the squash and cut up the squash with the yam and added them all to the pot at the correct time, but used a Pressure Cooker.  Set the timer for 20 mins when I started it, and then took it off heat.  Perfect!

The soup has a wonderful taste, but it turned out rather thin.  I would add less liquid next time.

Can't say enough about how great this is.  Everyone loves it.  No mods needed but did cheat by being a bit heavy on the spices.  Have made twice on popular demand.  Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!

This was quite good.  I did substitute 2 golden delicious apples for the potatoes, tripled the spices (except the cayenne) and used a dry white wine instead of sherry since that was what I had.  and I used fat free half and half.

WARNING: I did not make this as listed.  Don't freak out.  I left out the butter and steamed the onions/leeks to softness, then left out the half-and-half altogether.  This was healthy and hearty, and I am looking forward to making it much more often.  With a heavy whole-grain slice of toast.  Delish!

Double the spices and don't skip the sherry. That really gives it a punch. I omitted one potato and put in 1/2 cup each of celery and carrot. One daughter asked if she could not finish her serving. But she doesn't like sweet potatoes either and this is pretty close. The others liked this and I've made it twice. I have used canned (2 cans) pureed squash to save time.

I've made this soup twice in the last month, it's become my new favorite! I like it with more kick, so I use extra ginger and cayenne, so easily adaptable. It's super tasty when served with a dollop of nonfat greek yogurt.

Absolutley Amazing! I have never had butternut squash soup but wanted to try it. It is the most delicious soup I have ever eaten. It is very filling as well. I like my soups a bit thick so I used 32oz of chx broth, which was a bit too much as it was too thin after I pureed it. Therefore I used only half of the sherry and half-and-half. I would have liked to use the full amount because I love the flavor that they fave it but I did not want to thin out the soup any more. I also put LOTS of cayenne pepper since I like it spicy, brown sugar and cinnamon as other people had suggested. Next time I will add and apple and a sweet potato, I wish I had listened to other reviews and done it this time. Either way it was super yummy! The basic recipe is great and tweaking it to your taste will just vamp it up! I cant wait to make this again.

Excellent soup! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used 1 potato and 1 apple, next time I think I will probably use 2 apples and no potato. I didn't have any allspice so I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for all the spices. I also used milk instead. It wasn't as thick or creamy as I thought it would be but it was still really good. I will definitely make this one again!

this was fantastic!!!  i followed the suggestion to use apples instead of potatoes and i have to say, it was genius.  i don't think it would have tasted quite so flavorful if i had used the potatoes.  a+++ for that.  i halfed the recipe (because i used half of the squash to make baby food) and used a 32 oz carton of chicken broth.  i still used the full amount of spices and it tasted wonderful!  highly suggest if you like it spicier.  overall this was an awesome soup!  i will make it again over and over.

My key addition to this soup was about 1/2 of peanut butter. It definitely needed something and since I add PB to my carrot soup I thought it would help this and it did. My husband and I really like this soup, but it is the most labor intensive soup I've ever made. I don't know if it's worth all the dirty dishes and work to us when I can get a comparable one at the deli.

I loved this recipe.  It tastes wonderful and is perfect comfort food for a chilly winter day.  It does make a lot.  I imagine that this one would be good to make through step 2 and then freeze.  When you are ready to eat it, thaw the veggie puree, add the spices, sherry and half and half and it would be a super quick supper.

My family loved this recipe with some minor changes... I more than doubled the pepper, allspice, nutmeg and ginger and added some cloves and cinnamon just because they're great spices. had some extra sweet potatoes, so I added them along with the russets.

Flavor was pretty good, but did not care for the texture, very thin and watery.

after roasting the squash, and sauteeing the onions, leek and garlic, i put all ingredients in the crock pot for the entire day. The result was a deep, rich flavor.  The only thing i would change is i would omit the cayenne pepper or at least limit it to a sprinkle. The bite of the cayenned detracted from the rich, deep flavor of the soup.  definetly would make this again without the cayenne. tx for sharing!

Excellent soup!!  Followed the recipe according to what was in my pantry, subbed canned evaporated milk for 1/2 n 1/2, did not have a leek but all other ingredients made this an over the top flavorful soup.  Also, did take another reviewer's recommendation to use a bit of fresh rosemary, and that added alot to the mix of flavors.  Will be using this again with all ingredients listed, so thanks for the post LuvMyFamily!!!

I used low-fat greek yogurt instead of cream for a healthier version :)

Also, make your own chicken stock! Boil a chicken in just enough water to cover it (add some slices of ginger and spring onions for flavor).  Let it boil for around 10 minutes, then switch off the heat, and leave the lid on for 40 minutes.  The chicken will be juicy and tender, and the stock is a million times better than the stuff out of the can.

This was my first attempt to make butternut squash soup. I was very pleased. I cut the recipe in half, used a sweet potato instead of the russet and added a tablespoon of brown sugar.

I made this for the first time last night.  Oh my gosh.  It was fantastic!  I actually couldn't believe that I made something that tasted this good!  I'm a bit of a novice in the kitchen but am trying to cook more.  This made me feel much more confident!  I made it exactly as prescribed, except I couldn't figure out the chicken broth quantity either so I used 1 box and 1 can.  I also omitted the sherry (being a non-drinker and not generally having alcohol on hand) and it was still just about perfect.  Reading the recipe, the amount of spice looked a little light but it was perfect.  Very subtle but I didn't want to overpower the flavor of the squash.  Oh, I did forget to put in the salt and pepper but I didn't miss them at all.  I pureed the heck out of it with my immersible handheld blender and made sure there were no lumps.  Divine.  My husband was also amazed at how great it was.  We ate it as an appetizer before filet mignon, but it would be great standing on its own, too.  I'm so glad I took a chance on this recipe!  It's definitely a keeper.

Double the spices!  With Ethan though, keep the cayenne at 1/8tsp.  Extra leeks.

The flavor of this soup was amazing.. My husband said it was the best he had ever had... loved the little bite that the cayanne pepper gave the  soup.  Rich, hearty and delicious... this is a keeper and we love it.  Can't wait to make if for a family gathering..

Very good and super easy to make.  I cooked the squash a bit longer, used small red potatoes, added an apple, and doubled + all the spices plus added curry powder.  I didn't add any cream or sour cream...it didn't need it so it seemed like unneeded fat.  I also put everything through the blender together. Looking forward to making again.

Delicious!! I have to admit (I know some people hate it when people change the recipe, but whatever) that I changed the recipe some. I had a leftover butternut squash/leek/tofu gratin that I needed to use up. But basically I stuck to the original recipe EXCEPT for using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. It was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. The spices are spot on.

This soup is amazing.  I also took a couple other user's advice and used cider vinegar instead of the wine.  I also used a sweet potato in place of the russet potato - great idea! I added a dash of cumin and ground ginger as well -what a nice touch.  My husband and friends loved it! I will definitely be making this again, especially since winter is right around the corner.  Thank you for such an outstanding recipe.

Delicious!  I eyeballed the amounts, especially for the spices.  I really like the taste and texture.  I also baked the potatoes with the squash, then cooked the potatoes as directed.  In my experience, potatoes take forever, so I figured I'd come at them both ways.  I used already cut and peeled squash, but it still took about 40-50 minutes to bake it.  I also used milk instead of half and half--don't have any.  Topped with a bit of parsley and chives.  Great soup for a chilly autumn night.  Thank you!

I just made this soup for dinner party tonight and WOW!  I can't stop eating it!  I did use 1/3 vegetable stock instead of all chicken stock (just because that was what I had).  I also added a cup of apple sauce.  YUM!  I plan on garnishing with sour cream, chopped green onions and chopped pecans.

I was inspired by Jeff's picture today to make this. It needed a lot more of the spices (approx 1/2 tsp or more of each one) but it was heavenly otherwise. I used reduced fat half & half but would probably use evaporated milk or regular low fat milk next time. I'd make this again!

Perfect. Don't leave out the sherry!!!  This freezes well if you leave out the cream and add it only when you reheat.

excellent soup!  not a huge fan of squash, but it doesn't have a strong flavor.  I used green onion instead of leeks and it worked just fine.  great in a bread bowl or with fresh bread!

This was a fantastic soup! Rich and creamy. My husband and I ate it all up in a weekend. I omitted the sherry red wine, not a big fan of it. I also used summer squash from my garden (instead of butternut) extra garlic, and stirred an entire container of sour cream right into the soup. I think next time I am going to puree crab into it. This is an easy recip!!! Well worth it.

This soup is soooo good. It's replaced my formerly favorite butternut squash soup recipe. The recipe is great as written; however, I use slightly less broth because I prefer it to be thicker, and I double all the spices except the cayenne because we like spicy food.

Wonderful soup. I cooked the squash with the potatoes adding them to the sauted leeks, onions and garlic. I also added two stalks of celery. I covered the mixture with 32 oz of chicken broth, as another reviewer mentioned the thinness of the final product,  brought to a boil, covered and simmered for about 20 minutes.  This cuts the cooking time in half (especially if you buy the peeled and cut up squash at the grocery store). I pureed with an immersion blender. I used 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of half and half. The potatoes give it the thicker texture even though I'm sure the apples provide another level of sweetness. I make a mushroom and bacon soup by Ann Burrel using a similar process. I will definitely make again!!! Maybe next time I'll add some spicy sausage!

Disappointing. My husband liked it a lot, but I thought with the sherry and potatoes, you lost the flavor of the butternut squash (which I happen to like). And I agree with those who said it was too thin. I won't make this one again.

Great soup. I made a bunch of minor changes. First of all, I increased it to 14 servings. (2 squashes). For spices: I substituted curry and chili powder (about 1/2 tsp each) instead of the cayenne. I used red wine (cab) instead of the sherry and sweet potatoes (already cooked and soft) instead of russet. Yummy and savory.

This is pretty good although I think I preferred it before I added the sherry wine.  I had tasted it and liked it and have never added sherry before to this kind of soup so I thought I would try it and I prefer it without.  I did not add the cayenne pepper due to personal taste and I didn't have a leek so just used the onion and garlic.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was FABULOUS!  I had heavy whipping cream in the house so I used half that and half skim milk instead of "half and half".  We froze the leftovers and it's still great!

definitely a yummy soup.  I made a few substitutions, added spicy olive oil instead of butter, instead of one full cup of half and half i lowered it to 1/2 cup and used low fat sour cream.  added more for the spices.

I just finished making this a second time in as many months, following the recipe exactly and I love it! Try garnishing with spiced pepitas, there are recipes to your liking all over the internet. For those of you who tripled the spices or like a little kick to your food, I think you will enjoy this!

I admit it, I used a "sunshine" winter squash because that is what is what I had.  Absolutely wonderful.  Is on menu again and I have a butternut.  I expect the same excellence.  (I use only organice ingredients)Thank you.

Liked it a lot and spouse did too!  My squash was a bit small, so I will be sure to grab a bigger squash next time for more butternut flavor.  All the flavors meld together nicely with a pleasant spicy background.  Excellent cold night recipe.  Thank you.

I doubled this recipe since I had an 8lb squash. Instead of the potatoes added 2 red apples and 1 sweet potato. I added cinnamon to the spices. This soup was amazing!! I will definitely make again

I used 1/2 the broth for thicker soup, used about 1/2c heavy cream (vs. half & half) and much more cayenne pepper.  I kept the other spices about the same to keep the sweetness down.  I also used real sherry vs sherry wine...just a splash but it really helped bring out the creamy flavors.  This is a great base recipe to spice up to your liking.

I used this recipe as a base, then went out on a limb a little with my own ideas. I added a couple large baked potatoes for texture. I pureed them just until somewhat whipped. Then I thought I would add carrots--so I cooked about a cup of baby carrots in the microwave, and pureed them as well. I also added a few dried cranberries to the blender when I was pureeing, then when the soup was all together, I threw in a handful just for good measure. I did not add milk or cream. I didn't add any oil to the squash when it was baking, so the soup was essentially fat-free. If using vegetable stock, it would also be vegetarian. I didn't use as much stock as it calls for in the recipe. I added more of the spices listed until it suited my taste, with the exception of the cayenne. The soup was so flavorful, it didn't need it. I took it to a gathering--there was a huge pot, and about 10 people to share it. It was all gone by the end of the evening with the exception of about two cupfuls and people were arguing over who was going to get to take it home to have for lunch the next day. Many people called to ask for the recipe because they heard about it. It is absolutely awesome. BTW I used hubbard squash and it tasted just fine. I acquired a huge one from a friend, now she says she'll never give me another one so she can make the squash soup herself!

We really like this recipe, especially as a jumping off point for our own take.  We generally never completely follow a recipe, so I'm not going to hold that against it.  The soup is a mellow, savory one that can stand up to a bit more spice, if that's your cup of tea.  Best of all, my husband, who does not like squash LOVES this soup.  This is one for the recipe box.

I read many times that something is missing and I have to agree.  It tasted like liquid pumpkin pie to me.  I think it needs more spice.  I chopped up a jalapeno and threw in and I think it helped alot.

This was so declicious and so easy to make.  I did what a couple of others suggested, used sweet potato and doubled the spices (except the cayenne). I forgot the salt and pepper, but didn't really need it since there was so many other flavors going on.    Awesome recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Really good squash soup... I followed some of the other suggestions and used apples instead of potatoes, 2% milk instead of cream, doubled the spices except for cayenne, and added a touch of rosemary. Final result was delicious!

I've done this soup for Thanksgiving for several years now, and it's always a hit. I always add some apple so that there's a certain sweetness to the soup that rounds it out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I thought it would be good after reading the reviews, but it was even better. I did not have any sherry, so substituted in some red wine.  I did not add the allspice or nutmeg as I did not have any. I did double up on the cayenne, as we like a bit more bite.  I also added some shredded carrots along with the squash.  I didn't add the optional sour cream, as it just did not need it.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.  It is my new favourite soup.

Loved this soup SO much, but I'm giving it four because of the time it took.  Maybe it was because I never made it before.  But honestly I will never be satisfied with another Butternut Squash Soup again.

Tasty soup! I made a couple changes. I added another couple sprinkles of each of the spices, which was very much needed. I also added a little cinnamon, omitted the sherry, and added about 1.5 tbsp of brown sugar. To puree, I used a potato masher first and then a hand mixer. The squash could have been cooked a little more-- maybe adding it to the boiling water for the last 5 minutes would have made it a bit softer. When I make this again, I plan to cut down on the amount of chicken broth to make it a bit thicker and strain the finished product through a sieve to make it smoother and more restaurant-quality. As a note, this makes a huge quantity-- I froze about half of it and still have leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

Good choice of spices, the cayenne kicks it up just a bit.  Sometimes I don't have leek, sometimes I use 1% milk, but it's all good!

Loved this recipe.  Substituted the potatoes for a Lrg. white sweet potato, as well as no Cayenne but Chipotle, which added a bit of smokiness to the sweetness of the other spices.  the soup was so rich that there was no need for half and half...  DELISH!!!

Yum!  Love the flavors!  HINT:  Costco has organic cubed butternut squash already to go.  Added a couple of carrots.  Used 8 cups of low sodium broth.  Doubled the spices to 1/4 tsp except the cayenne.  Used 1/2 cup half-n-half and a 1/3 cup of cooking sherry.  Delicious!  Will make again!

Instead of chicken broth, I used fresh duck broth.  Added Fresh Rosemary and a bit more garlic than they wanted!  I used a little bit of smoked paprika also, along with fresh parmesan cheese!  Served it with garlic croutons and of course the dollop of sour cream!
I made this with left over butternut squash, turnip, parsnip and garlic that I had previously roasted!

This recipe was good. Based on reviews, I subbed apples for potatoes and tripled the spices. Unfortunately I had no sherry and I will make sure to add it next time as something was definitely missing. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the leftovers and it definitely enhanced the flavor, so add cinnamon! If you all are looking for a more flavor in your BNS soup, check out the "Butternut Squash Soup with a Kick" recipe on this website.

Soup was fantastic!  I used sweet potato instead of idaho and I didn't have any sherry so I used Shiraz.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and my dad and teenage son absolutely loved it. Thank you.

I have been wanting to make my own butternut squash soup for a long time now, and I think this is the best recipe I could have tried! It is absolutely amazing! I didn't even screw it up :)  I wanted to do a double batch but I was short chicken broth so I added apple cider. I wish I had done what another reviewer said and added an apple in place of one of the potatos too. Next time! I will be making this again! I also added more spice than it called for and I would recommend it.

Very good soup. 
Out of necessity, I used one medium butternut squash, 2 TB bacon grease, 2 leeks, 3 cloves garlic, 6 cups chicken broth, no potatoes, no onions, and white wine instead of sherry. It was still delicious.

Probably my least favorite butternut squash soup ever.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really thin.  I think there is way too much broth + the other liquid from the sherry and half-n-half didn't help.  The onion/leek/sherry overpowered the taste of the squash and the spices just seemed weird.  I'm not sure if there was a typo in the amount of broth, but if I was ever to make this again (probably won't) I would halve the amount of liquid and skip the sherry.  The reason I gave it 2 stars was because the rest of my family actually really liked it.  My 3yo kids ate 3 bowls of it in one sitting and my 16mo kept asking for more.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The changes I implemented were:  used homemade chicken stock;
only used 1/4 cup of sherry (very dry);  I felt the half & half cream would be too heavy, I used 2tblsp butter, 3 tblsp flour and 2 cups of skim milk, cook, thicken and puree with squash mixture.
I used the spices as noted.  Wow -- great with home baked bread.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit!  I added sugar pumpkin, cheese squash and acorn squash to mix it up a little.  I also substituted shallots for the onion and added two apples.  Just gave it a few more flavor layers.  And to really impress people, serve it in a pumpkin or big squash.

This soup is wonderful.  Very tasty and easy to make.  It freezes well.  Go easy on the Cayenne, you can always add more.

I LOVE butternut squash soup. I tried this recipe and was thoroughly disappointed! It tastes just like a bisque base because of the sherry and the cream. If that is what you want (and not a sweet nutty squash soup) then this recipe is PERFECT for you. What I might do next time is omit the sherry. That is all you can taste. It is too bad I wasted a lot of my winter harvest making this one...

The sherry really makes this pop.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  My squash was a bit under done when I took it out of the oven but I just cooked it a bit longer in the stock before I pureed it.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was delicious!!  I also increased the spices--used scant 1/4 tsps for allspice, ginger and nutmeg.  Left out the sherry b/c we don't usually have that, and I only used 1/2 cup of half-and-half--to me that was just right.

I loved this receipe with some minor variations... I only had 32 oz of broth and I also used a small acroen squash and thrrew in some beets I had in the fridge.  I did not puree, but mashed and left the chunks.  The key to this recipe is the spice combo.  LOVED it! and ate it all myself over about 4 days.

For what it is worth, I thought this soup was great, until I added the spices!  It would have been perfect without the spices and wine.  I do a lot of cooking and this would be near the top of my dislike list.  I may try it sometime w/o the nutmeg, ginger and allspice (I hate going to the work of making something like this only to not like it!)  I can usually doctor up what I make if I don't like the flavor, but I couldn't find a fix for this one!

Made this soup for Halloween.  :)  We had both acorn & butternut squash so I used combo and made double batch.  Children seemed put off by the taste of the sherry -- maybe they would have liked it better if I'd remembered to offer sour cream to top it off.  But the 3 adults enjoyed it.  I am happy to read another reviewer say that the spices were even more satisfying after freezing, as I will freeze some of this soup!

This was absolutely delicious. I made this soup on a hot summer day with a 95F temperature outside. I peeled the squash by hand and then diced it into one inch cubes. I also substituted purple potatoes for russets. The diced squash and potatoes tasted great and I didn't bother running them through a blender. Although spicy, this was a refreshing soup for a hot summer day.

This was great!  I modified the recipe slightly.  I doubled the allspice, nuteg, and ginger.  I also used one sweet potato and one granny smith apple instead of the two russet potatoes.

This is soup is absolutely amazing!! My boyfriend even loved it and he doesn't do veggies.  I did make a few alterations after reading other reviews, recipes, and what items I had in my house. I used a butternut squash and an acorn squash. Then I replaced one of the potatoes with a sweet potato. I used all of the broth the recipe called for and I think next time I will add another 3/4 cup because of the extra squash I added. I doubled the spices including the cayenne pepper and then added a dash of curry powder (we like a little zing).  I love lots of flavor and this is restaurant quality flavor!!!

I made this for my toddler and he loved it - but everyone else I let try it loved it too. I used sweet potato instead of regular ones, just because thats's what I had and my son likes them. I also used much less cream and only used sour cream. All of our family love spices (baby very much included!)so I put a lot more of these than the recipe - maybe a teaspoon of each, except the cayenne which was more like 1/4 - 1/3 teaspoon. I highly recommend this and there's plenty of scope for variation.

Way too much onion taste! I think it really overpowered the soup. I would make it again but only use just a leek rather than both leek and onion.

Great recipe! I adapted my own butternut squash soup recipe to this one, which means I also have (small) diced red bell pepper which I add with the onions, etc the saute stage. The sherry & 1/2 and 1/2 make this especially delicious.

Thanks for this one!

Needed way more spice! To cut the fat and keep the soup thick, I reduced the broth by the amount of cream and used non-fat milk.  I doubled the spices and added a couple dashes more of cayenne to give it a nice kick.  Yum!

This was pretty good.  I like the fact that  it is made with a healthy vegetable that doesn't often make its way to my table.  I'm sure this is blasphemous but I didn't include the half and half or milk.  When I got to that stage I just didn't think it needed it.  The consistency is really pleasant without it. I served it for lunch on a "waiting for snow day."  I served with a crusty bread, good hard cheese and sliced apple.

This is an awesome recipe! I have been searching for the longest time for a recipe that tastes like the Roasted Butternut Squash soup that is served in the Wolfgang Puck's cafes. The restaurant that was near us is gone now, so I haven't had that soup in a few years. I made a few changes to the recipe to try and replicate it.  I used 12c water + 4ts of kosher salt in place of the chicken broth. I omitted the leeks and the sherry, added 1tb sugar, and I replaced the nutmeg with cinnamon. Although it has been several years since I had the soup at Pucks, this one sure is as good as I can remember it!

I very hearty fall soup. I had to change just a couple of things. I omitted the leeks and sherry because I didn't have them. I also only used 32 fl oz of broth because I like my soups thick. I added 2 apples and used just 1 potato plus I added a dash of cinnamon just because I felt it needed something and I love cinnamon. 

I used about 1/4 cup of heavy cream instead of half and half. I think if I had followed the recipe as stated it wouldn't have been as thick as what I ended up with so if you like it thick I would lessen the cream and broth for sure!

Thanks for the yummy recipe for my garden squash! The spices are wonderful.

Wow..and again, WOW!  Beautiful, warm, full-flavored soup my family LOVED.  I have made other butternut squash soups that were good but the leeks and potatoes in this one just sent those other recipes packing.  This would make a wonderful addition to a Thanksgiving meal.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great starting point recipe.  Everyone should play with the basic ingredients to suit their tastes.  My soup came out absolutely delicious.  I used a little more squash, and I added in acorn squash along with the butternut to deepen the flavor. I also cooked the squash ten minutes longer so it was really soft.  I reduced the amount of chicken broth and half and half, added a little extra cayenne and ginger, and added a little brown sugar. Yum!

Excellent recipe!  I make this soup at least once every year.  I use skim milk rather than half and half and it is still great.  Don't skip the sherry, it adds a great flavor.  

Just fyi, I alter the recipe each time depending on what I have on hand, and I don't think you can mess it up.  One time I used vegetable broth instead of chicken for a vegetarian friend, and it was not as good, but still fine.

This is a favorite fall/winter meal at my house.  I double the allspice, ginger and nutmeg.  I also substitute the half and half with raw cashews that I puree with some of the broth  to add protein.  Delicious with crusty bread!

Delicious!  I used sweet potatoes rather than russets and no cream at all.  Healthier and still very creamy texture. I may have put a bit too much allspice and my sister said it takes like pumpkin pie, but I love it.

I doubled all the spices, halved the cream and omitted the leek and sherry, but this recipe was both delicious and easy to make! I will definitely make it again and play around a bit next time with the spices.

LOVED this soup! Very flavorful and filling. Great way to welcome fall, with seasonal butternut squash and a perfect combination of spices. 
My changes: 
Used 2 celery stalks instead of leeks (I rarely have those)
Added 2 carrots with potatoes
Doubled the amount of spices (except Allspice - did not have it)
Used fresh grated ginger instead of powder (added it with potatoes and Squash)
Did not have cooking sherry, but I  will definitely have it when I make this again! It was missed!
Husband enjoyed it, and will likely take leftovers to work! Kids liked the smell of it, but wouldn't try it. Maybe next time....

I left out the sherry (because I didn't have any on hand) and the leek. I added some cinnamon. This recipe is the closest to the wonderful soup served by the Weathervane restaurant in Chapel Hill, NC that I have found. I will definitely make it again using more squash from my garden.

Very tasty and filling soup.  Will definitely make it again.  My four star rating is based solely on the fact that anytime butternut squash is used it is time consuming however the dish itself is delicious.

Fantastic - spices blended well and gave a wonderful fall flavor. Still making this well into winter with no leftovers!  Didn't have leeks on hand so I used onions instead - I'm sure leeks would yield the same result.

This was a very nice squash soup, however, it did have a little too much onion flavor. Still very edible with good consistency. I made a few adjustments. I used more squash than the recipe called for (1.5 large squashes). I doubled the spices, I used 4 sweet potatoes, 3 garlic cloves, 1 leek, 1 vidalia onion, 1 32 oz container chic broth, 1 cup half and half, and no sherry.

I roasted two Fuji apples along with the squash and added to the soup. I used some cream cheese in place of cream because that's what I had. Hubby insisted adding some Italian sausage...gotta admit it was delicious!

Made a vegan version - delish!  For chicken broth I used Not Chick'n. For cream used Silk coconut creamer.  Doubled all spices except cayenne. Used 3x more ginger.  Used 4 cups broth. After cooking potatoes and carrots in broth for 20 min, added squash (oven roasted), 1 cup sherry, and spices and cooked covered for an additional 15 - 20 min to get the flavors well blended. Then added 1 cup coconut creamer and blended with stick blender.  Added fresh thyme, parsley and rosemary.  Incredible. Will definitely be making again and again.

This soup is going to be a favorite this fall and Winter! I do think the liquid ratio is off for my taste, and probably because I only used one med squash and 2 small potatoes. It's something you'll probably need to make once and then alter to suit your preference. 
I also think there is some confusion with the chicken broth amount as written. I used 49.5oz total, and I can't imagine doubling that! I think that is supposed to be the total, not 'per can' amount, but is confusing the way the recipe states it.
Instead of roasting the squash and boiling the potatoes, I cooked the squash the day before in the crock pot (wash, toss it in whole on LOW for 4 hours) and it literally fell apart. Just had to scrape it out of the skin. Also crocked the potatoes in the am before making the soup. Otherwise followed the directions as written. Will make this again and again, and probably start adding little things like shrimp, crab, bacon...  - thanks for the recipe!
EDIT: This makes a ton, so I froze some of it, and it defrosts beautifully. Just made it for a second time :-)

Boiled the squash with the potatoes to eliminate the need for the oven. Doubled the spices -  prob should have left the cayenne the same because it was extra spicy.  Also added a carrot for a bit if sweetness.  Delicious!!!

Yes, I did change this recipe a little.  I'm sure it would also be good as written, but I did not have all of the ingredients.  I omitted the Sherry and leeks since I did not have them. For the potatoes, I used red instead of russets. And I also did up the amounts on the spices just a bit to suit my taste.   It came out delicious, and I had two bowls of it.  My husband took one bite and said "Good soup".  He's picky about butternut squash soup and I have tried several other recipes.  This one's a keeper. I like the combination of flavors.  I added some diced walnuts  as garnish for a little crunch.  This is a hearty, and very flexible recipe.  I will make it again.  Thank you for posting.

Modified "skinny version": skip butter (substitute 2 T olive oil), half and half, cream. Add a pinch of chili for extra "kick". Absolutely delicious

Very good recipe.  I think next time I might leave out the sherry.  I tasted it before I added it and thought the flavor was better.I also did not use as much chicken broth (homemade) to avoid the runny-ness others have talked about. I used one apple and one potato.  I might use two apples next time. I think this recipe could be modified to include other spices; it seems like it would be very versatile.  I did add more cayenne pepper for some extra spiciness.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Entire family including young children loved the soup.  I doubled the spices because it tasted a little bland to me.  I used 1% milk thickened with Wondra flour instead of 1/2 and 1/2 to lower the fat content and I think I got almost as good of a "creamy" taste as if I had used 1/2 and 1/2.  To make it easier for me, I just roasted the squash whole.  It's so hard to cut those in half raw.

My wife loved it. I did not. It was expensive to make, took a long time and made a big mess. I scooped the mixture into a food processor from the hot pot on the stove and blended each batch. I suppose it was my fault, but while I did this, it often spilled onto the stove top. Then I had to use a second pot to receive the blended mixture. I had to wash two large pots and the food processor. I did use milk instead of half & half and apples instead of potatoes. It tasted okay, but not worth the bother.

I made this for the first time using Boston Marrow Squash instead of Butternut, and it worked just fine.  My husband really liked it.  I would like to substitute the 1/2 n 1/2 for something non-dairy like unsweetened almond milk, but I'm not sure what I will lose in depth or flavor.

I have tried this soup following the original recipe and with others suggestions, and it is fantastic the only thing I added on my own was creme friache which just made it even more special.  My husband and family love it and request it often.    Delicious!!!!

This was wonderful and very filling on it's own. I took suggestions and combined another recipe on this site and added 1 carrot, 1 celery and only 1 potato-I also used a leek and 1/2 of a white onion. I didn't have chicken stock on hand so I used vegetable broth-32 oz. It was superb. The spices really add flavor to this comfort soup. Definitely  one for the recipe box!

Wonderful taste ~ tho I couldn't get the texture right.  I don't have a immersible blender or a counter top blender, so that was no one's fault but my own.  I didn't use half and half ~ I used skim milk to cut down on the cals and I didn't have cooking sherry so I used a bit of red wine that I keep on hand.  Was out of nutmeg.  Good and filling :)

I chose this recipe because butternut squash soup can sometimes be too sweet for me...and this ended up being perfect! The only major change I made was to triple the four spices, which I would recommend. I also used coconut oil instead of butter, vegetable broth (36 oz) instead of chicken, wine instead of sherry, and only used 1/2 cup of cream.

LOVE IT!  I made this twice in 2 days.  My boyfriend, who claims to hate squash and kept saying "I can't promise to like it" can't get enough.  I couldn't find sherry at the store so I just went with a half cup of Chardonnay.  I also added fresh rosemary.  YUM!

It is hard for me to fairly rate this soup because I didn't have sherry so it was too blande for us.  I did add maple syrup instead and this help. I would love to try it again with the sherry.

Loved it with a few changes: Per other suggestions, I used apples (and one small white potato), doubled the spices (except the cayenne pepper), added finely chopped sage and rosemary to build the flavor.  I used a non-dairy milk (soy milk) instead.  I didn't even need to use all the broth the recipe suggested.  This will definitely be a staple in my home.

I did not enjoy the soup.  The onion and the sherry completely overpowers the sweet delicate taste of the butternut squash.  I also don't think the allspice complements the squash either.  I will not make this again.

My daughter and I were looking for a rich, creamy soup on a cold winter night in Nova Scotia and this filled the bill- but we did make a few adjustments- some out of necessity. We could not find 3 lbs of butternut squash in our grocery store in January so we used acorn too. We used sweet potato instead of regular and doubled the allspice and nutmeg and added some cinnamon and a bit more sherry. We tasted and tasted until I was afraid it would all be gone then she suggested a tablespoon of Maple Syrup. Perfect. We saved some for my husband (3 days in the fridge) and it was even better as the flavours had a chance to absorb. A dollop of sour cream with a pinch of dill made it beautiful to look at as well. Would like to try it with all butternut squash as it has a nicer colour than acorn.

I must be doing something wrong. I wanted to like this soup so much that I tried it twice.  The first time I made it as written and it came out blah, so the second time I used sweet potato instead of russet, doubled the spices, added cinnamon, and used curry instead of cayenne. Came out grainy and tasted ... strange.  Can soup be both bland and overspiced?  It tasted like my spice rack smells.  I blame myself since everyone else seems pretty happy with the result.  But I won't be trying again.

Great flavor.  I made a few modifications.  I used a parsnip instead of the second potato, curry powder instead of cayenne (1-2 teaspoons), 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, double the other spices, plus the juice of 1/4 of a lime.  When serving, I drizzled some lime juice, a swirl of table cream and grated Parmesan cheese on top.  Amazing.

I have also been using this recipe for over a year and use sweet potatoes in lieu of the white potatoes.  I love this soup.  It tastes great even if I have no leeks or sherry on hand.  I also only use a splash of cream or none at all and never sour cream.  Because it is so good for you it tastes better.

This is a great recipe. I did add an apple (granny smith), as another reviewer did, just out of curiosity. It was great and I'm sure the soup is just as good prepared as listed. I was skeptical of the taste as it was cooking - it just tasted ok, but after I added the sherry and cream, the soup just took off! This recipe is a keeper!

excellent - did add more spices. Sometimes I also add a can of pureed northern beans and/or some chicken to make a complete meal. Excellent!

This was the best butternut squash soup I've ever tasted! I didn't use large russet potatoes though, I used a few small potatoes, in case you're carb concious. And I didn't use as much cream. I highly recommend this soup.

My picky family even ate this!  I made mine in a crockpot and didn't saute the vegtables.  I just put everything in the crockpot except for the sherry and half and half, which I added at the end.  I doubled all the seasonings except the cayenne pepper.  I did use 2 potatoes and an apple.  I will make again, and probably take Kimkitchen3 and use sweet potatoes.

Like other posters, I suggest you start with less chicken broth because you can always add more to dilute it.  Also, it's amazing how potent 1/8 tsp of cayenne is, so be careful!  Seemed a little bland for my taste, so in the future I'd use apples rather than or in addition to potatoes, as the squash needs to sugar for the flavor to come out.  I added more garlic to enhance the flavor as well.

This soup was delicious!  I made two minor changes.  I used red potatoes instead of russets and I cut them smaller.  I didn't have any allspice, so I used some jerk seasoning.  This soup may be "spiced", but it's certainly not spicy.  It just leaves a hint of heat behind.  I'll probably add a bit more cayenne next time.  Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent soup!  I omitted the onion and doubled the leeks (because I had them) and left out the sherry (because I didn't have any) but it was still marvelous!  I made mine with 6 cups of chicken broth and it was the perfect consistency.  Very pretty served with a swirl of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh snipped chives.  Will definitely make again and again...

This was my first attempt at using a butternut squash to do anything and this soup was awesome! I was so happy with it all and the sherry/cayenne pepper really stepped it up a notch.  Thank you so much!

This was a good cold day soup.  It is filling as well.  I think the sherry overpowered some of the flavor so next time I make this dish I would lightened the sherry .  Overall it has a nice subtle flavor.

I enjoyed this soup. Simple to make and put together (once I figured out how to peel a cooked butternut squash, that is). The spices were just right. May also taste good with pumpkin. I was also impressed with how creamy it actually got. I tried it both plain and with a dollop of light sour cream, and the sour cream truly adds to the richness, I liked it best with it. My husband didn't care for this soup, he said it was "too sweet", but he refuses to eat any vegetables, so I don't count his opinion. I'm not giving up on this soup despite his input, I liked it and will continue to play with it.

very nice - didnt bother with the food processor - was able to mash it in the pot and the sherry was absolutely the key ingredient.  Didnt know what type of sherry to buy (had no idea there were different types so I went for the dry sherry - it tasted good but I got to wondering if the sweet sherry in the store was what I was meant to use?)

This recipe is just okay.  It's not as rich and creamy as having it in a restarant.  I would cut back on the broth and instead use half and half.  I added liquid whipping cream to the recipe at the end for a richer and creamier soup which ended up more like the restaurants.

This was DELICIOUS! My husband had just come home from a business trip and was raving about a butternut squash soup he had in a restaurant.  They had added a dollop of crabmeat in the middle of the soup just prior to serving it.  I didn't think that sounded very appetizing, but when I made this soup and added the crabmeat (and used the optional sour cream)it was very very good.  My husband said it was very close the the restaurant soup.  We loved it and I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't love this soup, but it wasn't bad.  I used about half of the amount of chicken broth, ommitted the sherry, and added a dash of cinnamon.  It was a little to thin I think.  Next time even less chicken broth.
