I was just in the mood for this type of smoothie and it hit the spot. My two year old wasn't too impressed though. I read the other reviews and knew it wouldn't be the traditional smoothie and was prepared for a difference. I was worried about the apple juice but it worked together and tasted good to me.

This smoothie is so strange! I would probably rate it between a 3-4, because I have not made anyone like it and don't even know how to describe it. I only made a couple of changes. I made 1/2 recipe to cut the calories in half and that was plenty for 1 person. The other thing was I used a banana that was frozen, which I recommended. Then, at the end I added 2 ice cubes (for 1/2 recipe) that were definitely needed so this did not taste room temperature. The smoothie is almost a mint green color and I thought it tasted like oatmeal and fruit. The other person I let try it, that didn't see me make it, said oh this is a peanut butter flavored smoothie. :-)

I really liked this smoothie. At first I was skeptical about the ingredients and thought it was going to be very thick. Its not. I did add some ice as I like my drinks cold. Very yummy!!
