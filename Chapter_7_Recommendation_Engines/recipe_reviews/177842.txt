This is the best new soup recipe my husband and I have tried.  We  had never eaten fennel or parsnips before, but we loved this and have sent it to our kids.  We used leftover chicken from frajitas, and threw in the peppers and onions as well. Really good!

I omitted the chicken because I wanted a light first course for a dinner party.  It was surprisingly sweet and flavorful considering there are no herbs or spices added.  The flavor of the fennel and parsnips combine to give a rich complex taste. My two small children also loved it - and I am grinning because I got my 2 year old to eat parsnips and fennel!!  GREAT recipe  and I will be making this again.

Good!  Not overly complex, I really liked the fennel.  I also added a bay leaf while cooking.

This was great! My husband is very picky about his veggies and really picky about onions in anything and he loved it! I asked him and the kids if this was a keeper and they all said yes at the same time! I was not able to get fennel anywhere local so I just added some cumin.

I enjoyed this soup tremendously.  I did add 1 Tbs. of minced garlic with the vegetables.  Maybe a little fresh thyme would give it a flavor boost.  It really was delicious though.

I followed the recipe to a T; however I thought that the soup was a little bland.  I will not make again.

This soup was great.  It's hard to find good vegetable soup that's not tomato based and this is the best I've found so far.  It's hearty but not heavy!
