I followed the Barefoot Contessa's suggestion and filled these with homemade applesauce and baked for about an hour. The pumpkin flesh was tender and delicious with all the flavor of the applesauce. My guests got such a kick out of them - they are perfect for a beautiful fall table!

Such a treasure. I purchased quite a few little pumkins from the farmers market and followed the directions. Then i made mashed Yams ad added a bit of brown sugar, buter, milk and spices. I filled the pumpkins with this and topped it with marshmellows. I placed in back in the oven under the broiler (to brown and melt marshmellows) and served them with the lids half-on.

A real hit, i will make this again anytime!

Interesting and fun. I couldn't find the pumpkins shown in the picture. When I saw mini's and asked if they were "sugar" pumpkins, everyone said no, they're only for decoration and not good for eating. So I used a lg sugar pumpkin and used this recipe as a filling. 

1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 medium tart apple, thinly sliced 
1 tablespoon raisins 
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
2 tablespoons brown sugar 
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

tasty and easy...Everyone loved them-even my mother who doesn't like pumpkin.  The only problem was I wasn't sure how big or how small of the sugar pumpkin to pick.

I really loved this dish.  Everyone thought it was a lovely decoration until I told them that they are to be eaten.  They turned out lovely!  The kids thought it was a hoot to eat them too.

These were SO GOOD and my guests loved them.  I didn't quite know what to expect but they were delicious and the look on everyone's face when I came out with a pumpkin on a plate was priceless.  It is a really nice fall recipe.

This is an easy, beautiful way to serve sugar pumpkins! However, I would add more sugar, and salt for flavor-- otherwise the pumpkin can be a bit bland. Also, cook time needs to be at least 45 minutes, or the flesh is too crunchy. I will definitely serve these at Thanksgiving insetad of our traditional butternut squash!

Mine were a undercooked so next time I'll leave them in the oven longer.  It wasn't very flavorful so we cooked some cinnimon apples and put them inside the pumpkin, it was so much better!

Made these for my sister's birthday in October.  Everyone LOVED them and they made great centerpieces.  I used slightly bigger pumpkins - just had to cut the tops to fit the oven. Put them in a pretty bowl to keep the sauce from oozing out.

Very yummy! this was a side dish tonight. Everyone loved it. I cut the pumpkins open with a pumpkin carving tool (halloween). I use it for most of my squash, easy to use. I used less cinnamon (eyed it) and a pinch of nutmeg. I will make this again soon. This will be a family fall favorite. Thanks for posting. I left the pumpkins in the oven over an hour just because I wasn't ready for them....they turned out perfect.

I made five of these, stuffed them with apple-chicken curry and served them on a bed of rice with a long sprig of flat parsley around the stem. They were a huge hit. No one missed my next dinner party!

We have always called these "jack-be-littles".  Anyway, they make a great side dish when stuffed with creamed spinach.  Cook them about an hour.

I just used butter and salt inside my pumpkins, so it's kind of unfair for me to rate this one, but it turned out great anyway!  The pumpkins were cooked just right and were delicious.

I LOVED this idea. I love everything pumpkin, so baking pumpkins was really exciting. I don't know if I had the wrong kind of pumpkin or not, though, because it took me forever to finally saw the top off and, when I took them out of the oven, there was a puddle of cinnamon sugary butterwater in the center of the pumpkin. But I just mixed that in when I was eating it. Is that normal? I thought they were tasty and, after baking for an hour/hour and a half, perfectly tender. Thank you so much for this idea!
