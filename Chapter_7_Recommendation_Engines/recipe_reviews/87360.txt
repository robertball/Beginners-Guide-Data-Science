I found the pudding to be a little bit thin, actually, but still very good. I thought a little bit less sugur might be needed and a little more cornstarch.

Lots of potential! the instructions are a little confusing. It took 15 minutes to cook the rhubarb and I simmered for almost an hour once everything was in and it still did not thicken. The flavor is really good so I can use this as a sauce on ice cream on something. Next time I'll use 3 1/2 cups water and 1/2 Tablespoon more of cornstarch. Will try again.
