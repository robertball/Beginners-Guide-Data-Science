Pretty good.  I tasted too much egg, though.

This is my husband's favorite after many trials of lemon meringue pie.  I add a bit more lemon juice - probably about a 1/4 of a cup.  I also use Splenda instead of equal - we think Splenda tastes better.

What a wonderful dish for diabetics!  I cannot believe how much it tasted like it had been made with sugar.  My fiance (who is diabetic) just loved it! I will definetely make this again!

If I could rate in halves I would give this 3 and a half stars.  Overall it had a great taste, but the consistency was a little weird.  The custard part was firmer than I like, and the meringue was just....weird.  Not sure if I'll make it again, but if I do I think I'll try it with a little less cornstarch in the custard, and I KNOW that I'll use real sugar for the meringue.
