I used this recipe for a company lunch. Good thing I read the review first or it would have been a disaster!  Changing the vinegar makes all the difference.  This was good stuff and I will definately use the recipe again!

I used 1 1/4 tbsp of vinegar and they turned out pretty good...  And they were excellent warmed up the next day!  I'll try again with even less vinegar next time!

I wish I would have read the reviews before wasting ribs on this recipe. They tasted way too much like vinegar. Horrible. I will not try this again.

I made this recipe on New Years Eve.. needless to say my New Years Day meal was ruined. I also wish I had read the reviews first, and I also had to throw out the whole thing. Isn't there some way you can change the recipe to call for only 1 1/4 tablespoons of vinegar?? o

Didn't like this until I added more than a few things from the fridge and they still didn't turn out all that good.

Easy, but a little too tangy for my taste.  Everyone said there was too much vinegar.  Next time I would use less vinegar and add some ketchup for body.

Great Rib recipe.  I used my roaster to cook these all day.  I doubled the recipe because I had so many ribs.  I put them in the roaster after it was heated to 400.  Then I turned the roaster down to 250 for 3 hours and the remaining 1 1/2 hours 200.  I spooned the sauce over the ribs periodically.  It was great.
