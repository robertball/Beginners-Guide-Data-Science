this was exceptional!  I added pineapple to the mango salsa mix and used powdered ginger that I had laying around.  I also just used half a can of diced tomatoes rather than cutting up roma tomatoes.  The presentation was virtually identical to the picture but I laid down a bed of fluffy instant rice, then a layer of mango salsa, then th e tilapia, then a topping of mango salsa with avocados and steamed broccoli rounding up the corners.  A mango margarita makes a perfect accompaniment.  It was fantastic!

I love this recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because I think the fish is better if it marinades for at least an hour and I also like to give it an additional spritz of fresh orange right before serving.  The salsa is wonderful and would be good on anything.  I purchased frozen mango chunks when I made this recipe the second time, it saved me a lot of time.  When I have leftover salsa I like to add a can of drained and rinsed black beans and take that as my lunch.  Overall excellent recipe, I will definitely make this one again and again!

Wonderful dish! my kids loved it and they usually won't eat fish. i added a little bit of honey to the salsa. a little bit of sweet to off-set the heat from the pepper. Definately will do this one again!

Fabulous taste!  My one quibble:  if using all fresh ingredients, all the chopping, mincing and dicing makes the prep time far longer than 10 minutes.  Otherwise, this recipe is darn near perfect.  My adjustments:  We prefer cod to tilapia.  I did NOT peel the tomatoes, and I added an extra pinch of salt to the salsa.  Served with toasted couscous and a green salad, this was beyond delicious.  And it's a beautiful dish.  We'll definitely have this again.  In fact, this salsa recipe has just become my party salsa.

Very delicious and satisfying. I pan seared my Tilapia and served it with the mango salsa on top. I also added extra avocado per my taste.

I have made this recipe maybe 5-6 times so far and love it every time.  I have small children so I leave out the jalapeno and red pepper.  We usually use the fish and salsa as a filling for fish tacos/fajitas and my husband adds heat to his liking.  I do use only about 1/3 cup red onion in the salsa and as much cilantro as I feel like chopping - usually less than called for.  And I have tried all kinds of tomatoes and even simple dried, ground ginger.  As expected, the flavor varies with the ingredients, but it's always delicious.

I have to admit that I don't like fish, but I keep trying.  However, I was really looking forward to the salsa, so I was disappointed that I ended up throwing most of it away.  It had too much avacado, WAY too much salt, and the mango got lost. My husband did love the tilapia and ate all four fillets, so I gave this recipe two stars anyway.  This was also a lot of work with all the chopping and prep.  And not an inexpensive dish either!

An excellent way to serve a mild fish.  I have used a simular chutney for years - it is also very good on poultry or as a dip for bagle chips. I didn't have an orange on hand so used a TX Rio Star grapefruit for the zest and juice, and was very pleased with the results. Will definately use this one again.

Wow, this is fantastic! I like to make fish for my lunch (I work from home) and the rest of my family aren't big fish eaters. I didn't have any orange juice so I gave the fish a few splashes of fresh lime. I also didn't have an onion, so I used a bit of cucumber & red bell pepper. Delish & healthy. I have enough of the salsa left so I'll make it again tomorrow. Thanks!

This was very good! I left out the salt, added a diced red bell pepper and about a clove of minced garlic and used a bit less of the mango and red onion. I prepared the salsa early in the day so the flavors had a chance to blend, adding the diced avocado about 30 minutes before serving. Marinated the Tilapia for a couple of hours in the OJ and Zest. Served with Refried Beans, Sweet Corn Cake and some rice I had leftover from the night before. Family truly enjoyed, and thanks!

Five star recipe all the way - salsa was wonderful and the fish came out great (and I'm not a big fish eater) only tiny change I made was to not peel the tomatoes -- YUM!

Did not like at all.  Orange zest on the fish tasted awful.  Fish was bland unless you eat with the salsa.  Did not like the avocado in salsa - made it too mushy.  The salsa was fresh but seemed to be missing something.  Too much onion. I would make the salsa again, with some changes, but not the fish.  I would add cucumber to salsa, delete the avocado and add more lime and some sweetener like brown sugar.  The tomatoes were a toss up.  They didn't seem to add anything other than color to the dish.

Loved this! Used cod and cooked in a skillet for 3-4 minutes on each side. I also marinated with the orange mixture while I made the scrumptious salsa. I added a little jicama for a little crunch. It would have been great rolled up in a corn tortilla. YUMMY!

Excellent combo with great potential, but a couple tweeks could make it even better.  Like one of the reviewers, I thought the mango got lost.  I would add quite a bit more, and I might even add a tsp. or two of sugar or Splenda to play up the sweet, fruity flavor. The amount of ginger was overpowering, as was the amount of red onion, so I would dial those both back by half. This recipe doesn't keep well (refrigerated tomatoes = yuk) so only make enough to eat immediately.  It would also be good over a chicken taco salad or spinach salad.

I will be making this again and again... :) I really enjoyed how the flavors came together. I added pineapple to make it sweeter. I did not have avocado so I'm looking forward to trying the original recipe next time. I served the fish over white rice. I added 1/4 c orange juice, orange zest and a pinch of kosher salt to the rice in order to give it some flavor and tie the dish together. Also, I will let the fish marinate for at least 30 minutes next time.

This was my first time making fish. The salsa was excellent. My husband refuses to eat seafood and he ate the salsa and most of the fish. I gave it 4 stars because I felt there should have been a little more flavor in the fish. I marinated it for a couple hours per another reviewer's suggestion and followed the recipe but it still seemed a little bland. But then again, it was my first time making fish...

Loved this recipe! Did not have ginger root, so I used ginger powder and left out the jalapenos. Very tasty! The mango salsa definitly overpowers the tipalpia, didn't really taste the fish too much. Though, that may be because I loaded on the salsa because it was so good! I also marinated my fish for about an hour in individual tin foil packets, then just tossed them on a baking sheet into the oven!

I love fish - especially tilapia - but I have to say, I've had better tilapia. I let the fish marinate in the orange juice concoction for about 20 minutes and still, the fish by itself didn't have much flavor. 

The salsa on the other hand - oh my! AMAZING. I'll definitely be making it again and again and serve it with everything. 

I served the tilapia over brown basmati rice (and discovered that we don't like basmati rice!) and covered it with the salsa. I enjoyed it - can't say I loved it. Next time, I'll probably do the salsa with chicken and regular white rice and see how that goes!

Overall, a good recipe.

One of the best recipes on this site!  I made it with rockfish (caught by my boyfriend) and it was out of this world.  I recommend adding an extra mango to the salsa.  One of the best meals I've ever made.  Seriously.

My son made this for dinner, baked and served over rice with the salsa on top.  I must say that it was so good that I had two helping of this.  What a great cook that he is.  Very good recipe. Thanks.

Really Good with a Lot of Flavor. Prep took a very long time though, and the flavor got too strong for me near the end of the meal that I couldn't finish. But my Dad really loved the whole thing. It also looked Beautiful! I would make it again, but mostly for Dad.

YUM! I have made this recipe several times now, and it has become a family staple. The main change I do is puree some of the ingredients to make a marinade, and put it in a ziploc with the fish for an hour or so while I prep the rest of the meal. It is versatile to various citrus you have on hand. I have used a combination of orange, lime, and lemon, adding honey to sweeten if it comes out too sour. No red pepper. Pureed the onion, ginger (1 tsp dried ginger since I didn't have fresh on hand), cilantro, and 3 cloves fresh garlic with the juices and olive oil, added salt, and marinated all that together with fish for 30-60 min in a ziploc bag. Put diced mango, cilantro, tomato, and red bell pepper on top of fish and broiled in oven until done. SOOO good!

My whole family loved this salsa. I cut back on the onion and served the minced chili pepper on the side. This salsa has so much flavor it really doesn't need the heat. The gingerroot is a great addition. Make sure you include it.

This dish is delicious and perfect as is.  I make it according to the recipe and it comes out perfect every time.  I recently made it for a family dinner party of 8.  I doubled the recipe and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Made with Halibut steaks and served as fish tacos.  Excellent combination of flavors.  Made a hot tartar sauce to go with it using cayenne, hot sauce, relish & mayo.  Thanks for the keeper!

FANTASTIC!!!!  We really were looking for something that was not too heavy, but had a lot of flavor and this was perfect.  That salsa was great.  I let my fish sit in the dish with the orange juice mixture before putting it into the oven.  The fish really soaked up the orange flavor.  I served it with roasted sweet potatoes and cauliflower.  So healthy...so delicious!!!

I wasn't sure about this recipe but I had the tilapia and all of the ingredients so I decided to give it a try. I won't use red pepper flakes again because my husband said it was too hot. I hardly used any but he could still taste the heat. I have salsa left-ver and will use as a topping for my omlete tomorrow.

This makes a lot of salsa which is even great with tortilla chips. My husband who doesn't like salsa or veggies loved it and said "this is like one of those dinners you would get at a fancy restraunt."

Fantastic salsa. The fish tasted fine to me as well. I added a little extra orange juice and some garlic powder. No jalapeno to my salsa but did add red pepper flakes to taste. Will make again. And will also try the salsa with pork and chicken.

The fish was fairly plain. Nothing wrong with that but it has to be a pretty great recipe for me to like pairing my protein with fruit.
The salsa on the other hand -- amazing. My husband loves it and I'm certain I will be making it again real soon.

The Tilapia was delicious. But a note of caution for the uninformed (like myself). If you decide, against all reasoned judgement, to include jalapeño in this recipe, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU TOUCH YOUR FACE AFTER HANDLING THE PEPPER. Unless you want to kneel crying in the bathroom under a cold faucet for half an hour feeling as if your flesh is melting from your face, mind racing as your eyelids swell shut wondering if you'll ever see daylight again, PLEASE, learn from my mistakes.

I made this tonight with my daughter, She loved helping and I love introducing her to new ingredients, it makes her more open to try new things if she helps prepare the dish. This was one of the best salsas I have ever made/tasted! So many wonderful flavors. I doubled the recipe so it took almost an hour of prep but well worth it, Oh and the tilapia was just as awesome! We all loved it!!!

Very flavorful, super easy, waistband friendly, what else can you ask for? The recipe for cooking the fish is great as is and also a good starting point to experiment; I've added garlic, oregano, cilantro, all with great results. Definitely a winner every time. I never prepared the salsa as written, there is something offputting to me about having mangos & tomatoes in one dish, just seems odd, so I always sub red bell pepper for the tomatoes; I like it :) I make this combo often; it tastes great and looks fantastic - it's like summer on a plate.

I thought this dish was okay.  The best part was the salsa which I used today over some grilled chicken for lunch.  I sliced the orange and a peach and added to the fish a few minutes before being done and also added some coconut flakes.  It really helped to enhance the fish.

OMG! This is terrific! I didn't have any mangos, so I used mango chutney and also added some pineapple chunks.  I didn't have tomatoes, cilantro, or chilis, so I substituted a can of drained Rotel tomatoes and added some dried cumin.  Still turned out great!  This is now in my monthly menu.

WOW! The first bite I took of this all I thought of was that this would be perfect for CEVICHE.  I do not like mango at all, however I have tried it on food and loved it so I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  I made zero changes and it was to die for.  The mango salad is what does it, its perfect, you can toss in some seafood that you marinate in lime for a few hours and have this ceviche, or you can eat this with chips.  And of course you can use it like this recipe.  Next time I want to try it with chips and ceviche, but I will absolutely always cook this dish.  Perfect!

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband, who normally doesn't like fish, loved it and wanted more!  It would also be good with other white fish, such as cod, halibut, etc.

I had to come back and change my review from 4 to 5 stars.  I make this all the time! I'd say we eat this 1-2 times per month and never tire of it- even my husband, who never gets too excited about fruit in his dinner, looks forward to this meal!

This was very delicious. Followed the previous recommendation to add pineapple. I used salmon instead of tilapia. The prep took forever though, took me at least an hr just to get everything chopped. Ready in 22 minutes? Yeah right, maybe if you’re splitting all the peeling, chopping, zesting, etc between 2-3 people. So you might as well marinate the fish in the mixture while you chop up everything for the salsa. Very delicious, but very labor intensive in my onion.

This was delicious ! We marinaded the fish in orange juice and fresh basil for one hour. Substituted parsley for the cilantro. we added fresh basil at the end. Next time I will cut back on the lime and let it sit together for a awhile longer to let the flavors really blend. We grilled the fish using a grill mat and used a bit of smoke. was really a great dish!

I did not have an avocado or fresh tomatoes, so I made the mango salsa without them. It was great! The fish poaches and does not have a strong flavor, but with the salsa it is great.

Usually I modify recipes a bit for my liking or the family's preferences. HOWEVER, this was quite possibly the best dish I've made from AllRecipes community. I rarely cook fish because I'm not a fan of most fish dishes.

Loved this recipe! The flavors were very eclectic, but really made the tilapia taste great. I grilled the tilapia on an infrared grill, placing the tilapia on a boat made of foil after pouring the orange sauce over it. Instead of the cilantro, onion, jalepeño and tomato I opened a can of store brand tomatoes with chilies (similar to Rotel). Made short work of the chopping.  It made a great, light meal with snow pea pods.

My husband usually complains when I make fish but he practically licked his plate clean when I made this recipe. I omitted the tomato since he is alergic and I used frozen mango instead if fresh.
Will definitely make this again.

I saved this recipe in 2011 and I really wish I had made it before now.  This is delicious and so easy!  I did the fish on the grill in a disposable aluminum pan.  The fish sort of poached in the orange juice mixture.  Served over coconut rice with edamame (from Cooking Light) with the salsa on top.  I am making again this week!

This was great! My son, who hates fish, gave it 10 stars! I used 2 tomatoes instead of 3 and added a diced radish just because I had it. I also only have 1/2 of an avocado. Very quick and delicious meal. Highly recommend!

When it comes to fish I tend to have lots of ingredients in the cupboard for a last minute recipe. This was the winner tonight! Trying to keep my husband eating clean and still enjoying dinner. Especially when it comes to fish. SUCCESSFUL!! Definitely will make this again.

Excellent recipe! Flavorful and healthy. I agree with other reviewers on prep time. If you are prepping the salsa from fresh ingredients give yourself at least 40 minutes to chop! I made double the recipe am I'm very glad I did.

We enjoyed this very much.  
I found the fish a little bland and wonder if I had marinated for a few hours if the flesh would be more infused with the citrus flavours. I will try that next time. 
The cooking time was perfection.  
The salsa delicious.
Many thanks

Didn't have any ginger or cilantro and this was still the bomb. The jalapeño & mango really play off of each other well alongside the light orangey tilapia. So good

5 stars for good combo of flavors - even though I had to make adjustments for what I had in the house. Just made the salsa, not the marinade - and due to food sensitivities couldn't use the jalapeño - used diced cucumbers and a bit of sweet red pepper instead of avocado - the salsa might have been a bit too squishy without these crunchy vegetables. Would make again, very light and refreshing - could use with all kinds of seafood or chicken.

I will say I was slightly skeptical when making this dish but as I began I realized it was practically fool proof! Unfortunately I didn't get to experience the dish in its entirety seeing how my boyfriend doesn't like avocados & some other ingredients so I made due with what was left & improvised. It still came out amazing however! Down to the beautiful colorful presentation, and the exasperating aroma I will surely be making this again. Five stars for a recipe of simplicity with big flavor! (I.e. One tip, definitely only use two peppers, it's more than enough, marinade fish for @ least an hour if you can & I incorporated pineapples into my salsa as well)

This was fantastic! I omitted the Red Onion, Jalapeno, and ginger root (wife has sensitive stomach and store was out of ginger root) and the dish was fantastic. Fish would have been just fine with the orange zest/juice and red pepper, but the mango salsa was a great touch. We had it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob

This recipe was great. Although, I was quite upset after the delicious ripe avocado I used turned super sour after making the Salsa. It may only be me, but I would suggest to others to watch the amount of lime juice you add as it can hurt the avocado.

Again, great dish.

Not bad, but definitely not worth the cost or time.  I love onions, but even this was way too much for me.  The blend of flavors was nice, though.  I did marinate the fish all day in the sauce instead of just cooking in it... that way it would bring out the flavor more.  I probably wouldn't make this again.

Used marinade from Grilled Talipia recipe....  liked the jalapeno pepper from this salsa recipe -- used avocado and it was pretty good, but it made the salsa a little "slimy".  Didn't use tomatoes.

The fish came out perfect, but the salsa definitely needs some tweaks. We felt there wasn't enough mango in this salsa to define this dish as "mangolicious". We will try the following changes to the salsa next time we make this (it's worthy of a second try for sure!): two mangoes, one tomato finely diced, half a jalapeno finely diced (the heat overpowered the other flavours except the lime) and omit the ginger. We didn't use cilantro as we could not find any and it was fine without it. Served with rice.

The mango salsa was fantastic!  I'm not a fan of most salsas but this one definately took the cake.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and added a tsp of honey, about a quarter cup of crushed pineapple and only added half an avocado instead of a full one.  I didn't find the fish all that great however.  I thought the taste was rather plain and needed some more kick but, being one that doesn't like tilapia, my opinion on the fish doesn't say much.  The salsa did, however, taste wonderfully with the fish.  I served it on top of a bed of rice with a side dish of salad.  This was definately one of the best meals I've had in quite some time.  I love the recipe a lot and I'll definately be making it again in the future.

YUMMO! Only recommendation is to make the salsa a day in advance so the flavors can meld together. With that being said, it was delicious just as written. Thanks for a new keeper!

Tasted good. It was the first time I tasted Tilapia. Next time, I think I will use Cod. Husband said the cilantro could of been put on the side rather than in the salsa.

This is an amazing recipe! Delicious! My husband told me to fix this again.  I added pineapple and I used an orange for the zest then cut it up in the salsa.  Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli with lemon-pepper spice and served with white wine.  I let the fish marinate while I made the salsa, then baked fish for 10-15 minutes while the salsa remained at room tempature.  This is a dish that you can entertain with!

I followed this loosely, and used what I had. I mixed the orange juice with thai chili sauce (the sweetish kind that you dip spring rolls in.) I salt and peppered the fish and marinated it in the juice mixture for an hour, flipping intermittently.  For the salsa, I just used finely (confetti) diced mango, pickled jalapeno, cilantro, half a clove of garlic, and some lime juice, and salt.  I baked the fish right in the marinade, for a bit longer than you said. About 20 min. We like it well done, and it thickened the sauce. It was awesome. I wish I'd had some avocado to dice into the salsa.

Awesome dish! The only thing we did different is prepare the salsa ahead of time and cooled in the fridge for 1 hour. Just because all the chopping is time consuming. We also made plenty of the salsa for dipping! :) Thank you for this one!

Fabulous recipe for Tilapia!  We liked the salsa so much that I made it for church one night (served it with chips) and I got wonderful compliments!  I used heirloom tomatoes instead of romas, it gave the salsa a wonderful refreshing flavor.  I also added some peper to taste.   I would highly recommend this recipe!

Great fresh flavor. My boyfriend was very impressed with the presentation and flavor of this recipe. I used cherry tomatoes sliced quartered. This was so good we ate it as a side dish with the next meal.

I didn't make the mango salsa myself, used a jar of mango ginger chutney from Trader Joe's instead. Saves a lot of time cuz I didn't have too prep much. It turned out alright. It was a little too fishy still for my taste, but I liked the orange juice and chili flakes combination. The premade salsa went well with the fish too. Next time, when I have all the ingredients, I'll try to make the salsa.

This was good.  I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I didn't make the mango part, as I had Mango Chutney I wanted to use.  I did use the base of olive oil & orange juice to pour on top of the fish, then added in garlic, ground ginger, red pepper flakes, lemon juice.  My husband and guests really enjoyed it.

I'll give this a 4 star because I edited the recipe. I used two mangoes, two jalapenos, and two tomatoes in the salsa.  Using that basic change this turned out spectacular. I put down a bed of jasmine rice then laid some mango salsa down then the fish and topped it with the mango salsa again. Around the edge of the plate I put tostones (plantains) and a spicy Thai dipping sauce. My guests were in awe of the platter and all but licked their plates. I used the leftover salsa to compliment fish tacos the next night.

This dish is restaurant quality yum yum yum.  No kidding.  All that chopping is what makes it so darn good.  The flavors all are important and add so much.  I will make this regularly.  I love it! Thanks for sharing it here.

Wow, What an awesome and refreshing fish dish. We put it over a bed of Jasmine Rice, which was an outstanding base. My kids loved it. I made it with my cucumber and shrimp salad and the meal was complete. Everyone agreed we would need to make that next time we had company over.

This mango salsa and tilapia is delicious! I always have tilapia at my house but not mangoes. But they were on sale this week at the grocery store so I got a few and when I saw this recipe, I just had to try it. Both me and my hubby like sweet/spicy recipes. The salsa was perfect. It was fresh, light, sweet, hot from the jalapeño, and most importantly healthy! The only thing I changed was, pepper flakes and ginger which I left out. I paired it with brown rice and it was a complete meal! Thanks!!

Surprised me! It was very good and replaced one I had used before. I only changed one thing; I'm not big on avocados so I ommited them and  it was so delicious. Once in a while I'll add a small touch of honey, like when fruit isn't in season anymore or as sweet and it's wonderful.

This got rave reviews - everyone loved it! The presentation and wonderful color make this a winner. I omited the jalepeno in the salsa and think that was ok -- the ginger gives it enough depth of flavor. I followed an earlier suggestion to add the salt to the salsa bit by bit, as 1tsp likely really is too much. Subbed Pam for the oil to cut down on the fat. Used dried orange zest instead of fresh, which I think made it more bitter and which I wouldn't suggest others do.

This was seriously the best thing I've ever made in my life! The chopping takes some time, but the results are well worth it. If you are a beginner level cook don't be intimidated! If I could do it, so can you!  Whole Foods didn't have any Tilapia when I went there so I used Halibut and it came out great. I used some mango juice in place of the fresh orange juice also. One thing I would not switch out is the ginger in the salsa. It definitely gives it a certain depth of flavor. I did use half of the requested amount though because I just used the ground ginger I had on hand. I fashion myself a full fledged foodie, but unfortunately I haven't quite worked up to being a successful gourmet cook. But as a foodie, I know great food! And this one is AWESOME!!!

I love this recipe. The salsa is amazing! I added lime to the tilapia and I also topped the tilapia with a few pieces of shrimp. My friends loved it. I served it with fresh green beans and a side of pasta.

I spread the salsa onto the fillets and baked for about 20 minutes instead of serving it alongside after the fish were cooked.  It was DELICIOUS!!  My family loved it.  My sister even commented that it "tastes like something she would eat at a resort on the beach."

Love it!  The mixtures of all the flavors in a single bite is wonderful. Try to plan so you don't have left-overs. All the flavors in salsa blend together and is not as great as when it's fresh.

This was a very refreshing recipe on days when it's too hot for anything heavy. I added a little garlic and sesame oil to the fish (goes well with the ginger), and I cheat and buy prepared mango salsa at the grocery store. I let the fish sit in the mixture for about half an hour before baking. Served over whipped parmesan cauliflower, and I'm set for dinner and tomorrow's lunch.

Yum!  This is awesome.  Only thing I did differently was to cut back on the red onion cause it's so strong.  I may double the mango next time too.  Thanks for the recipe!

this is probably the best salsa i have ever had in my life!  i didn't put it on the tilapia b/c i knew my family wouldn't eat it that way and instead make it for chips/dipping.  i think i am a connosseur (sp?) of mexican food b/c i grew up on the border and have travelled mexico extensively since my father was an importer.  trust me when i say this stuff is *divine*.  great share...thanx!

Holy Cow!  This is great fish!  Love it, love it, love it!  I am not a fish fan, but a Catholic.  Made this on Friday during lent.  My family of five gobbled it up and said it was the best fish they've ever had.  They compared it to 240 Union (Denver nice restaurant).  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make it again, and again, and again!

What a great recipe!  Sweet, tangy, and very fresh-tasing, with a little kick.  I had to leave out the avocado but I didn't miss it. I added pineapple chunks to the salsa and covered the fish with slivered almonds before cooking, which really rounded out the flavor.  The fish came out great, but the salsa can definitely stand alone.  Next time I'll add a little less of the onion and more mango.  Otherwise it was perfect!

Awesome salsa recipe.  My advice though is to add half of the  salt, then taste, and add the rest if you like.  I found it WAY too salty and had to add another avocado and some pineapple to cut the saltiness.  But in the end it really did taste like something you could order at a  restaurant.
The fish was awesome too, I loved the orange flavor.  We will be making this again for sure!

I served this at a large family gathering. Even the children, who don't "like" fish ate it! Marinate the fish as another reviewer suggested for about an hour. Tastes great. The salsa is great with/without the fish. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this tonight for a friend and myself. I adjusted the recipe a bit for my personal preference, but it was essentially the same. It was delicious. A huge hit!! And easy to make - I'm new to the kitchen:)  Definitely try this - my friend described it as an explosion of flavor!!

Loved this recipe!  I made it just as written, but added just a bit more mango.  Great flavors, everyone at my house things it's great.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it always turns out great.  The mango salsa can even be had by itself.  Thanks for the recipe.

delicious!! i used 2 tsp dried cilantro and  1 tsp ground ginger, along with only a dash of salt,  in the salsa, and it was awesome! the fish would be ok by itself as a dish, but the salsa raises   it above restaurant quality! thanks again, allrecipes cooks!

The salsa I made was a little too heavy on the onion and cilantro. Next time I make it I will use more mango and less of the cilantro. I let the fish marinade for about an hour before I cooked it. Came out great! Lots of flavor. I had to cook it for about 6 min longer to get it cooked all the way.

It was fussy to make but it was delicious. The salsa was a great condiment.

This was unbelievable!  The fish was great even without the salsa.  We needed to cook it an extra 10 minutes to achieve the flakiness we like.  We love it!!

I made this the other night. I prepped the salsa the night before. It was fabulous! It is very hard to get my other half to eat fish. But evan he enjoyed this so much that he ate it all. Will definately make again. I want to try with other fish.

The salsa is the best part!  Unfortunately didn't have avocados or tomatoes, but still wonderful!  My first attempt at a fruit salsa.

This recipe was mentioned in USA Weekend - so I thought I'd try it!  I HATE fish but this recipe was great!  I couldn't taste the Tilapia at all (I assume by design).  I thought the cilantro was a bit overpowering - but other than that, this is a great, quick, healthy, light recipe!  My husband who hates all fruits and veggies loved it too!!!

Wow, what great salsa!! I tried it hoping my taste buds would finally accept talapia...but, no. I will definitely make this salsa for all kinds of dishes!!! Maybe, with a different fish, too. Tortilla chips, here I come!!
