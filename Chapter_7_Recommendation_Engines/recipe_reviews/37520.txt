I used chicken frank, so this turned out OK. Would be better with beef. Was missing something though... Will spread mayo or ranch dressing on the tortilla next time to give it a little bit more flavor.

I used to clean rooms at a motel.  Everyday all of the maids would bring in various lunch items and eat together.  One maid brought in this exact same thing a few times.  I love it!  I rarely get to eat it because I never have hot dogs in my house.  But this is a simple, yummy recipe that I would eat all of the time if it weren't for my diet.  I personally like it the way it is and don't think it needs anything else (I tend to like foods on the plain side though).

It's a chilly morning here, so I wanted to make Husband something hot before he goes off out of town for the day. I used 3 medium eggs - 2 didn't look enough - and 2/3 of a hotdog. This was a very quick, easy and inexpensive breakfast. I served it with salsa, as suggested. Husband certainly enjoyed it but admitted he would have liked it even more with bacon instead.

This recipe was delicous. I cooked the hot dogs before adding them, and I added salsa to the combination before putting then in the microwave. Over all it was fantastic, you don't need to use the things kraft suggests it was delicous!- i have to go make some more.

Eh - basic line is how much are you addicted to salt.  I used vegan products with no salt and added it - and it was fantastic!!  But if you think you're getting great flavor from "beef" franks or dairy cheese, you just need salt.  You can make this recipe great without Kraft products SO easily.
