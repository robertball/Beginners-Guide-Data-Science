Everybody loved it! It reminds me of Reese's peanut buttery taste, but with a kick of fudge! However, as I was scooping up the ingredients, I realize I didn't want to add ALL that sugar and salt.. so I altered it. I also used Hershey's Cocoa Powder. 10 minutes later, I  decided to stupidly cut myself a piece to sneak. It started to fall apart, oops. Turns out that it needed 15-20 minutes to cool, not 10. After they cooled enough for me to hold them, I put them in the fridge and freezer (2 separate batches).  Freezer ones were a little too hard to bite down later. Fridge was perfect.

I liked the idea of these brownies, but, unfortunately the recipe did not work for me.  The brownie was very crumbly and grainy from the sugar.  It tasted similar to a peanut butter bar and less like a brownie.   The taste was ok, but, we just weren't fans of the texture.
