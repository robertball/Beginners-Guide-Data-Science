I seasoned the chicken thighs  with the salt, pepper and garlic powder before I fried it, I used sherry to deglaze the pan, I used more honey, fresh lemons and lots of rosemary and I also added a little fish oil and a tbs or so of soy sauce to the sauce.  In spite of everything, the dish still was bland and tasteless.   But it is not the fault of the sauce or seasonings.  Modern, factory farmed chicken is basically tasteless.  The chicken are slaughtered when only about 6 weeks old so the meat is very tender-(the chickens are still basically chicks) and the meat does not have time to develop flavor.  Those of us old enough, or who were raised on a farm with outdoor, free foraging poultry know there is a tremendous flavor difference between most of the chicken on the market today and the chicken of yesteryear, when you could prepare them without any seasoning except salt and pepper and they would still come out delicious, even though the cooking time would be longer.

Not sure I will make this again.  Considering the amount of spices, I felt this didn't have much flavor.  I used pine nuts and dried cranberries, and that had the most flavor of the whole dish.  If I make again, I would add water/cornstarch to thicken the sauce to more of a glaze.

This was delicious!  I doubled the sauce and spices to make more sauce for drizzling over the quinoa.  Highly recommend adding the pomegranate seeds and pine nuts to the dish.

This is a choice for a weeknight meal at home.  Had hoped it would be a good, simple recipe for guests.  The sauce needs something more to make it tastier.
