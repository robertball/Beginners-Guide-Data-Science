This was fantastic, I substituted two pork tenderloins I needed to use and since they were thawed they were done in about 5 hrs on low. Something with the orange juice really produces a nice modes flavor and very tender meat. I tried this with boneless chicken breast, just as good.

The orange juice makes this recipe.  You can't really taste the orange if just adds a nice bright touch which is nice for use with so many other flavors.

I have been making pulled pork in a slow-cooker for years using apple cider vinegar.  This orange juice recipe is so much better!

Not a fan of bbq sauce so this recipe was perfect.  I used a pork sirloin roast- the meat was moist and delicious!!

No changes, i like to make it the first time exactly like the recipe calls for.  This is certainly easy to put together with staples usually already on hand ....except the pork, maybe

I had leftover orange juice from weekend guests, so I made this recipe.  The pork was far from ready after 6 hours on low, so I switched to high for another 1 1/2 hours.  It was okay, but overall,  it tasted bland.

Made it just as called for. Just so-so. Pretty bland, but very tender and moist.

This recipe was great. I did cut three mandarins into forths and let those cook with it. I will use this recipe again.

It was a good, just lacking some pizza.
