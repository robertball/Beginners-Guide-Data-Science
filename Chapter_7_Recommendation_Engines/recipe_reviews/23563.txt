This was a delicious recipe!  I did make some changes to the original, however. I used canned enchilada sauce and Mexican cheese (instead of the cheddar.)  Also, I layered the corn tortillas, rather than roll each one.  I decided to do this because the tortillas kept cracking.  This was a wonderful dish that I will make again and again!

Wow! Delish! These enchiladas scored a touchdown on my Super Bowl Sunday Buffet table! I left out one can of chilis and used Sara's Red Enchilada Sauce from this site in place of tomato sauce. Heat the tortillas in a non-stick pan for a half minute or so, this will make them pliable without the oil or sauce on them. I also served the sour cream on the side for garnish rather than in with the sauce. Thanks Sara.

Delicious!  I used flour tortillas, and these enchiladas turned out great . I must admit they take awhile to prepare, and alot of steps are involved but tehy are well worth the work.  My boyfriend loved them.  It's the first dish he's requested that I make over & over again.

A good basic enchilda recipe.  I modified mine slightly due to what ingredients I had on hand.  I used canned enchilada sause instead of the tomato/chili powder combo. I also used ground beef.   I imagine it would be fine either way.

Very good enchiladas! I used "Red Enchilada Sauce" submitted by Sara instead of the tomato sauce, more cheese, flour tortillas (we like them better than the corn ones), and only one can of green chiles. I served over a bed of shredded lettuce and used the sour cream as a garnish instead of putting it in the dish.  Next time, I might add some bell peppers. I could see ground beef working equally as good. Thanks Sara!

Simply AWESOME! I cooked my beef in a crockpot so that it would be nice and tender and easy to shred. I added all the ingredients to the crock pot: sauted onions, garlic, peppers, tomato sauce, chili powder. I also added enchilada seasoning, enchilada sauce, and 1/4 cup of chicken stock. Cooked in crockpot for 5 hours on high. I didn't have black olives, but did add refried beans to my tortilla rolls. This came out wonderful and was full of flavor. My family loved it!

This dish turned out really well.  I forgot to separate the tomato sauce, so I didn't have any left to pour over the top, but it still turned out OK.  I think it would have had more moisture if I had done it right, though!  I think I will use ground beef instead of sirloin steak next time I make this recipe.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and each time i did it differently trying to make it better.  This is what you do:  Use steak-ums instead of beef.  Don't put tomato sauce on top.  I used flour tortillas.  Who likes cooked sour cream?  eww.  Basically, follow the recipe for the meat and then roll up in flour tortillas.  Then only put cheese on top (i used monterey jack/colby) and bake.  Then on each person's serving, add sour cream, chopped green onions, chi chi's salsa...  This tastes really good!

These were so good!  I served them for company and two people told me that it was the best mexican meal that they had ever had.  Served it with the Spanish Rice II recipe from this site, refried beans and guacamole.  I did use two cups tomato sauce and two cups canned enchilada sauce rather than 4 cups tomato sauce.  Would definately do that again.  Thanks for a really good recipe!

Did a little changing after reading reviews. I seasoned my sirloin with blackened seasoning and grilled it, then sliced it THIN and added taco seasoning and cumin. THEN Added some salsa, a can of green enchilada sauce, onion chips (because I grilled meat and did not cook in pan) and some chilis.I combined that with some cheese in FLOUR tortillas and topped it off with canned red enchilada sauce and cheese. It ROCKED THE HOUSE.  I should probably submit as separate recipe since I really did my own thing...lol But the steak made it really special. I did get a lot of rave comments.

I increased the servings to 8, and they were wonderful.  The topping is creamy and cheesy.  I used another suggestion and used red enchilada sauce instead of the packet of taco mix.  Also, I microwaved the corn tortillas (5 at a time between paper towels) for 20 seconds...they were pliable and rolled easily.  Excellent!

WOW!!!  These enchilada's were the best!  I made them for a dinner party, and everyone LOVED them!  I didn't change a thing!  My next batch, I might make them a bit "hotter" by adding fresh jalapeno!  EXCELLENT!!!!

Ive cooked this recipe twice now, once by the book which was good but I felt the prep time took to long.  The second time I changed a couple things.   First get rid of the salsa....the recipe already has tomato sauce and chili peppers.  The salsa is unnecessary so save your time and money.   I also seasoned the beef,onions, and garlic while they sauteed.  Thirdly dont waste your time rolling each individual enchilada (too messy and time consuming)  Just layer the casserole like lasagna.  Meat mix,tortilla,cheese green onion olives,tortilla,meat mix,tortilla,sourcream,cheese green onion olives.    Cover with foil and bake for 30min, remove foil and broil for 3-4 min till cheese has that nice caramelized bubble.

I fixed this recipe for the super bowl and it was great.  But my one problem with it was it took 3 hours of prep time instead of the stated 15 minutes, and the cook time was 1 hour unstead of the 30 minutes. The 4 cups of tomatoe sauce also made it a little soggy, the 2 teaspoons made it a little to spicy.  The next time I cook this I will change some of the ingredients and let you know how it turns out.

I used flour b/c of previous comments, I used 1 1/2 c of onions, handful of chopped cilantro and some black beans. I agree w/ previous comment about liquid, next time I will use 1 cup of tomato sauce divided and 2 cups salsa divided....maybe even just salsa.  We also didn't do chili's (kids not fans) and only topped it w/ olives (kids not fans).  It was good, but I think it was b/c of the addition of the cilantro and salsa, otherwise I think it wouldve been a bit bland

This could be an excellent recipe.  I'm not sure if it was the brand I bought or what, but my corn tortillas just fell apart during baking and it turned out to be more of an enchilada mush.  However, next time I'd use flour tortillas and I think we'd be ok.  The flavors are all there, but for some reason it all got lost in the mushy tortillas.

Good!  I used Boca crumbles instead of steak; scratched the chile peppers and tomato sauce; used 1 can enchilada sauce and one jar salsa; used flour tortillas.  To prevent tortillas from getting gummy DO NOT put any sauce on the bottom of the pan.

Good flavor but way too much liquid. I even left out a full cup and a half of tomato sauce and it was still to runny. Will try another recipe for my next enchiladas.

Given that i used turkey instead of beef, i think they turned out very well. However, i thought it lacked a little flavor. Next time I will add some fresh cilantro to the meat mixture and garnish them with it as well.

For my  1st Enchiladas, I must say it was pretty darn good. I used the "Red Enchiladas Sauce" recipe instead and it turned out good. Yes I twirked it a little, but not too much.

Okay, I can already tell this will be a family favorite. I would however substitute enchilada sauce for the tomato.

I made these with ground beef and ommited the salsa and sour cream. I also used a pre-made red enchilada sauce as well as a pre-made green enchilada sauce which added great flavor. My boyfriend loved them!  They made great leftovers also!  Thanks!

Excellent enchiladas! A bit spicy if you use too many cans of the green chile peppers.  I used ground meat and flour tortillas but other than that I followed the recipe.

Great recipe.  I did make a few changes, used hamburger vs. steak and put a bit more onion and garlic in that recipe called for. They were YUMMY!  I'll use this recipe over and over again.

This recipe was good. It is not the best enchilada recipe I have ever had but I will definitely make it again. If you want authentic mexican enchiladas, these are not for you. There is a lack of spice I am guessing from not using enchilada sauce. These have a sweeter taste to them due to the tomato sauce. The only thing I changed was I used shredded beef instead of the recommended meat. These are great reheated. I will add more cheese on top next time. I love sour cream so I used it as recommended and had no issue with it. Oh and I had an obscene amount of beef left over. It couldn't all fit in the corn tortillas. I would definitely not recommend flour tortillas as some have mentioned. They will soak up too much of the moisture.

OK but for best results fry the tortillas lightly in hot oil for about a second on each side to make them softer, then dip the tortillas into the warm sauce and pour remaining sauce on top,use authentic mexican cheese instead (cotija or queso quesadilla)

Oh my!  These were delicious.  I confess, I used ground beef and tweaked a few small things, but none of my changes were significant.  My old enchilada recipe is going in the trash.

Very good flavor! It took a lot more prep time than I expected. The meat was also rather tough and chewy. I think the next time I make these, I will throw the sauce ingredients and a chuck roast in my slow cooker and shred the beef when it's nice and tender. But I will definitely be making it again!

I sauteed leftover new york strip steaks for the filling, chopped up into bite-size pieces. I also made homemade salsa (didn't have any on hand) which made the recipe more time consuming but probably added a lot, flavorwise. I suggest heating some additional tomato sauce and sour cream and using that to help soften the tortillas - otherwise, they do break when you try to roll them up.

Seemed like a LOT of tomato sauce, and I couldn't find the canned green chilis, so I used 2 7-oz. cans of green chili/tomatillo sauce instead and added just a little of the tomato sauce (maybe a few tablespoons) in the filling. Used ground beef instead of steak.  Dipped the corn tortillas in the filling mixture before stuffing to make them easier to roll. They were delicious! The green chili sauce gave it a LOT of flavor—and they were not too spicy for my 3 year old.

WE thought this was a really tasty recipe, thanks Sara.  I did substitute my home mixed seasoning mix instead of the chili powder.  ( 3 T chili powder, 2 T ground cumin, 1 T ground black pepper, 1 T garlic powder and 1-1/2 t. ground red pepper mixed together) I keep this in a spice jar as a substitute for chili powder and I think that added some spice to an already good recipe.

5 stars I say because it's the perfect enchilada recipe BASE at least. I would go by this recipe every time, but I add green and red bell peppers, more chili powder (giving great flavor), maybe a little ground cumin, add garlic powder, and I use flour tortillas because I dislike corn ones. ...next time I might try marinating the beef (in chili powder, garlic, and beef broth (with red wine maybe)..?) first because I don't like that "beefy" taste. Oh also I didn't use olives, and I don't really think they belong in real mexican enchiladas, but each to their own! ;)

I made this using this recipe as my "springboard". We don't care for black olives so I elimated those and used ground beef instead of steak. I also used canned enchilada sauce instead of tomato. I kept the chiles and for seasoning, I added a packet of powdered enchilada sauce.. it was marvelous! Thank you again for the idea!

I, too, used ground beef and enchilada sauce instead of the sirloin steak and tomato sauce.  These taste great!  They do not take any longer to put together than any other enchilada recipe.  I will keep this as my favorite Beef Enchilada recipe!

This was a very tasty dish.  I made a casserole instead of the rolled enchiladas as my tortillas wouldn't hold up.  I also added a bit of cumin and salt to the tomato sauce.  Will definitely make again.

Simply wonderful! I used lean ground beef instead of the steak and added taco seasoning to it. I also used enchilada sauce from a can instead of tomato sauce.The only other change I made was I sprinkled the olives on top instead with the cheese. 
Easy, and delicious! They were even better the next day!
I will look no further for a great enchilada recipe! This one rocks!

This is now one of my favorite recipes.  It had a lot more flavor than most dishes and tasted like something from a restaurant.  The only things I did differently were to leave out the olives (don't like them) and to use rotel instead of the green chiles (didn't have any chiles).  They were very good, but filling, so I didn't get to eat as many as I would have liked to

Delicious...I made these enchiladas for a friend's birthday and he really loved them, and he is usually pretty indifferent about food. I am vegetarian, so I substituted meatless burger-style crumbles for the steak. I also used homemade enchilada sauce instead of tomato paste, which gave them an extra kick. It's a great recipe! Thanks!

The 4 cans of tomato sauce is a little too tomato tasting. If I ever try this one again I will take the suggestion of another reviewer and substitute 2 cans (or maybe all cans?)of tomato sauce for red enchilada sauce. Also, the meat mixture was a bit bland. We added extra chili powder, and lots of salt & pepper. I think this is a good recipe to make for kids because the flavors are very simple. I will keep trying to find the perfect enchilada recipe.

I also layered flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas like in another review..i also used can of enchilada sauce, and I seasoned my beef with a taco seasoning packet, which gave it a great flavor..when i was layering it like a casserole i crunch up some cool ranch doritos for a little extra flavor which was really good..family all said it was very good..will make again for sure..

This is really good.  Next time I'll use McCormick, in the little packet, enchilada sauce.  It's a better flavor then a can.

I make enchiladas many ways and this looked interesting. I used the food processor to ground the sirloin to a chunky texture. All went well until I attempted to fold/wrap the enchiladas with the corn tortilla's. They cracked and  fell apart before I even baked them. I would fry the tortillas before filling IF I make this again. Also, use enchilada sauce!!!! Did not use sour cream or green onion. I felt the onion in the enchiladas were enough.....

This was an ok recipe.  It seemed to be missing something.  A spice, an ingredient, I'm not sure what exactly.  It was good, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.  I put too much sauce over the top of the enchiladas.

This was awesome. I used ground chicken instead of beef and I don't think it could have been better. I also spreaded some black beans and rice in the wraps with the chicken. We had left overs and they didn't last long! That says a lot in my house!

I followed some of the advice from a few of the reviewers.  The corn tortillas were a pain to use so our Enchiladas ended up being more of an Enchilada Lasagna. I also used canned Enchilada sauce, it was still good.  We saved the sour cream to add at the end.

These were pretty good.  I did add some spices though and thought it probably would have been pretty bland without them.  Did not put the sour cream in prior to baking, but did put some on top before serving.

An excellent recipe, and very flexible for changes.  I used ground beef instead of steak, which is my personal preference for this kind of dish.  I left out the green onion because I didn't have any on hand.  Finally, I used Hunt's tomato sauce--which I found in another enchilada recipe--and it was the bomb.  The meat mixture was superb, something that could be used for many other recipes.  Making it with Hunt's sauce does make it seem more like an Italian dish than Mexican.  I look forward to trying enchilada sauce next time, as other reviewers have suggested.  Do note:  Corn tortillas break easily, especially if they are small or overfilled.  Because the ingredients in this recipe mesh together, this comes out like an enchilada casserole, which is fine.  It was wonderful.

I cut the recipe in half, it worked out to about 8 tortillas in a 7x11 pan.  Used round steak, mixed 1 cup of hot enchilada sauce with 1 cup of tomato sauce.  didn't use the salsa, it was saucy enough without it. Less sauce would still be good.  Served the sour cream on the side.

I took the advice of the other people - I used jalapenos instead of regular green chiles - I mixed the beef with salsa and cheese and I covered the prepared enchiladas with enchilada sauce - very good and leftovers were even better.

This was a very good recipe. First of all I thought 2 cans of chiles were too much used 1-1/2 as they did not seem to add any heat to the recipe. Instead of the tomato sauce, I used jar of Enchilada sauce and 1-cup of Salsa. Instead of Cheddar cheese I used Mexican cheese and 6" flour tortillas. I let one of my friends from Mexico taste them and he thought they were good but stated Enchiladas should be spicier and suggested adding jalapena peppers.

I thought the meal was really good-but got confused on the tomato sauce (only use half at a time).  It would probably be better with ground beef because the steak didn't seem to fill the tortillas very well, a little runny!  Also, tried the corn tortillas and they kept falling apart, had to use flour - also added a little cumin!

This was delicious!  I used a bean and corn salsa as well as the tomato sauce and put in some oregano, parsley, cumin and chili powder.  I served it with chopped cilantro, more chopped ripe olives and a side of chopped iceberg lettuce.  Will make this again for sure.

Turned our pretty well! We used sirloin steaks cut into small bite sized cubes instead of strips but did everything else as directed. I didn’t add sour cream to the dish but I FORGOT to put salsa inside the tortillas and I didn’t feel like the tomato sauce and cheese were enough of a topping so of course the top was crispy and dried out a little bit. But the inside was wonderful and everything tasted just fine once we topped it with salsa and sour cream. A good meal that my family seemed to enjoy so I will be keeping it on my list :)

These were good. My family isn't a huge fan of enchiladas, but my husband liked the chunks of steak.

My daughter & I were looking for a quick dinner to whip up without too much effort. We used left over roast beef, which we chopped up in  the food processor and left out the olives. After cooking the onion until translucent, We added the roast beef with the rest of the ingredients. Other than that we made as is.  The recipe was easy, tasty and used up leftovers, what more could I ask for?

The proportions of items on this seemed way off. I even added half of some once I noticed how off it was. The recipe was ok after I made the changes, but I'm sure glad I didn't use the tomato sauce or as much as it called for. I also didn't use as much green chilies as called for. The two small cans of sauce I added were even a little much. I don't see myself making it again.

I made this last night for the man in my life. I admit I'm no Martha Stewart but I'm not horrendous when it comes to the oven either. This was really easy, but I changed it entirely because it just wasn't working for me. Corn tortilla's fall apart, they would not role for me so I just layered it like lasagna. Also I left the sour cream and salsa out of the lasagna and let them on the side and put it in the oven for tops 10 minutes to melt the cheese. Everything was already cooked. My husband and his best friend ate it all. The whole pan with a little hot sauce of course.

Yummy! with a capital Y! Super easy. Made it exactly as written, except I heated up some oil in a pan and dipped the corn tortillas in it, to make them pliable. My 2 boys and DH are going back for seconds as I type this. Thank you!

This was very good. The only variations I made was using whole wheat tortillas, lean ground beef (browned it with the onions),and I served the sour cream on the side. Left off the green onions, too, as I did not have any on hand. Great recipe.

Yummy! I didn't use all the green chilis and I added in some Monterrey Jack cheese with the cheddar. We like our enchiladas saucy so I also added a can of regular enchilada sauce to the mix. Will definietly fix again!

This recipe really did not turn out that well. First of all it did not state to save any sauce or split it. Second it baked into a pile of mush. Next time I would cut the sauce in half and not mix any into the meat mixture.

While it was certainly edible, this just didn't turn out to be a hit. I can't put my finger on the problem, but I think it was the tomato sauce. It was bland and soupy. If I spent enough time thinking about it or reading the other reviews I could probably tweak this until it worked, but I'd rather just hunt around for another enchilada recipe.

Good concept except the tomato sauce makes the dish sweet.  Why not just continue with the red chile powder and make a sauce? I think tortillas need to either be fried or sprayed so they don't get mushy during the cooking process. It's a hassle, but in New Mexico, red chile is a serious business and enchiladas are a big topic.

Awsome. Easy to prepare and the family loved it. I did have to use some corn tortillias and flour ones to keep everyone happy. I'll be doing this one again soon. Thank you.

This was very tasty.  I ended up with too much tomato sauce.  The mixture ended up being to soupy.  I used flour tortillas.  They were soggy.  It had great flavor.  Delicious. I will probably make it again.

My family loved this recipe, and some of them are pretty picky! It was also very easy and any left over filling can be used to make nachos the next day, so be sure to buy some tortilla chips and extra cheese when you go shopping.
Tip: instead of just smothering the enchiladas in the tomato sauce, spread the sauce on the tortillas BEFORE you put them in the pan--it makes them easier to squeeze into the pan and fold.

Used ground turkey with this recipe; omitted the olives and made a homemade enchilada sauce. The sauce in this recipe needed some work. Found the filling to be a bit boring so I added a can of bean and bacon soup to the mix. Everything needed more seasonings.

Was good. We used a package of fahitta mix to the tomato sauce. Gave it a good kick. Also added a minced jelepeno to half for the adults.

I used fresh jalapenos(6) instead of canned chiles for extra "kick".  My wife had the left overs for lunch the next day and said they were even better the next day.  I think my kids could "take it or leave it" on this one but my wife and I both liked it alot. The kids can eat PBnJ next time I make it :)

Great recipe, went over very well with my Tex-Mex boyfriend. Could only find pickled chilies, and next time will use fresh instead. Make sure to only add HALF the tomato sauce to the stir-fry (I didn't read ahead.) I also used about double the chili powder, and added some cumin.

This was okay. I used flour tortillas, as we like those better. It seemed like a little too much cheese, to have it in the filling as well as on top. The sauce didn't taste very much like what I am used to in enchilada sauce. I might make these again, but they weren't super.

This is a fast and delicious dish.  I substituted ground beef for the steak with no problems at all.  It was so delicious that my husband told our friends about it !!!  This is definitely a "must try" recipe..You won't be disappointed.

Served these at my Cinco De Mayo party and they were a hit!  Gone in minutes!  Substituted chicken instead and they were still great!
