YUM! I used a little less than 1/2 bag of fries, so the bacon and cheese was perfect, but if I were to use a whole bag, I would most likely use more bacon and cheese. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really enjoyed this because it was so easy to make. I added jalapeno peppers though because I like a little kick.

This recipe is similar to the one at Outback Steakhouse.  The only difference is that my husband and I had them add fresh chopped garlic to the fries.  Now we always add fresh chopped garlic to the fries whenever we make this recipe.  So delicious!!!!

The only thing I did differently is that I always bake my bacon in the oven instead of frying it in a skillet on the stove. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you use the full 28 ounces of fries then you would need more than a cup of cheese and three slices of bacon in my opinion. To each their own though so add as little or as much to suit your tastes. Next time I plan on adding some green onions to the top and dipping in buffalo sauce. Great recipe and easy to adapt to suit your style.

Okay, there's this one restaurant near me and it sells cheese fries. Their's is sooo good. So I wanted to try something that will be similar to it. And I came across this one. I made it with a change, instead of bacon I did ham. I wish there was a rating one million stars. It was so delicious! Definatly try it out. This is one of those fail-proof food. :)

for a vegetarian version I sprinkled on crispy onions, brown sugar and smoked paprika in place of the bacon -- the cheese went on last -- yum yum -- not guiltless, but meatless!

So easy when you just need some direction! My husband was hungry and so was I and neither of us felt like a big dinner. So, I made it and viewed it like a large appetizer that you would pay $15 for at a restaurant. It was that good! What I did differently: I didn’t have bacon but I had a bratwurst from grilling a couple of days earlier. So, I put half a brat in my salad shooter and added it instead of bacon. I used 3/4 bag of crinkle cut seasoned fries and before adding cheese and meat, I piled them like you’d see served in a restaurant. Then I broiled. Also instead of foil lining the tray, I used parchment paper; it won’t stick and when you see the corners turning light brown you know they’re ready. Finally, I slid it off the tray and parchment paper onto a preheated stone platter to keep it warm while eating. Perfect! If you don’t have a double oven for heating a plate, use your dishwasher heat dry system... you will eat it slower and really enjoy the experience.

A simple, tasty-delicious recipe.  Came across it at lunchtime and had to make it right away!   I agree with other raters that more cheese and bacon would be needed for a whole bag of fries.  I used potato wedges and white cheddar cheese, and chopped green onion.  My husband is a vegetarian so I used real bacon for mine and vegetarian "facon bits" on his.  Both worked well and I'll make it again, adding garlic next time.

I used a half bag of fries and just winged-it on the cheese and bacon. We enjoyed them with 'Spicy Fry Sauce' from AR, rather than Ranch dressing.  Served them with 'Waffle Sandwich with Cheese, Spinach and Spicy Mustard' from AR and a tossed salad.
