This is a really good recipe for those of us who love the taste of apples in our stuffing, and I have made it for my holiday dinners for two years now.  However, I make it with several changes without which I don't think it would be that good, hence the four stars.  

First off, instead of using two cups of apple juice, I use one cup of apple juice and one cup of broth.  It is still very apple-y with only one cup, so I imagine that it is way too sweet with two (some people may even prefer 1/2 cup of juice and and 1 1/2 cups broth).  

Next, I use tart Granny Smith apples instead of red delicious.  The tartness of the apples is much more suitable for a main dish and works better with the flavors.  

Lastly, I also add a sauteed onion and some poultry seasoning (sage and thyme) to the stuffing.  

With these changes, it is an excellent dish!  Thanks for the recipe.  It was a great starting point for one of my favorite main dishes.

This was SO yummy! I modified it a bit, as per other reviews, so I did 1/2 apple juice, 1/2 water. I also used Italian breadcrumbs which added nice flavor to the chicken, and I added some sauted onion and some chopped celery, because I had it on hand. Definitely a keeper.

I was looking for a way to prepare chicken breasts with "Thanksgiving" style and this hit the spot! I replaced the apple juice with chicken stock and added celery and onions to the stuffing. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was 'OK;' I agree that the chicken was a bit tasteless and needed something on it.   I don't know what, though.   Also, I prefer my stuffing a bit 'crispier' too, so I followed an earlier reviewer's suggestion of leaving the foil off for part of the baking time.

This chicken dish was very good, and easy to prepare!  I cut the apple juice down by 1/2 and replaced the rest with water.  The apples cook up perfectly and go great with the chicken.  Can hardly wait to make it again!

This recipe was SO easy!  It came out delicious!  The stuffing was a bit soggier than I like it so I think I'll remove the foil for that last five minutes or so of cooking.  Also, the chicken as a tad blander than I prefer.  I'm not sure what seasonings would go with this if I were to add some.  Maybe just salt and pepper would do the trick.  The chicken tasted great though when eaten in the same bite as the stuffing.  This really was easy though and it can be made ahead of time and popped in the oven when the time is right.

Not sure how this recipe made it into the health recipe section w/over 700 calories and over 1200 mg of sodium. It's pretty bland. I'd recommend substituting a sharper apple than red delicious, maybe use ww bread crumbs, and definitely spice it up. I don't mind that many calories in a tasty recipe but this is more like a 200 calorie diet meal.

This was pretty good but a little sweet.  I will put 1/2 water, 1/2 apple juice next time.  The breading on the chicken was also a little goopy.  I think next time I will bake uncovered for the last half, or not bread the chicken.  Maybe a crumb topping instead of breading would work better.

This was ok.  I used 1/2 cranapple juice and 1/2 chicken stock and a granny smith apple.  I think next time I'll use just the chicken stock - the apple really would've added enough sweetness on it's own.  I didn't bread the chicken, but added poultry seasoning, salt & pepper and removed the foil half way through baking.  The stuffing came out well, but while chicken was tender, but I agree with the other reviews that it lacked flavor.  I'm not sure what I'll try differently next time... maybe marinating the chicken or adding a sauce to the chicken before baking.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I skipped the egg though and it turned out just fine.  We also used our leftover cranberry sauce to garnish the chicken with when we served it.  YUM!!

This dish is okay...but I agree w/other rvws that it def. needs something else, just can't put my finger on it I'm a diabetic so I modified this recipe to what I can eat (no breading on the chicken, added protein to the stuffing and used less apples).

My family liked this a lot. I used one cup apple juice and one cup water, as recommended by others. My family said it was plenty sweet like that.

I liked this recipes. Since earlier reviews said chicken was a little bland I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the bread crumbs to add a little something. I figured it would complement the apples. Chicken was very tender though.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but the apple taste was a little overwhelming. The chicken came out really tender though, so I'm modifying this recipe for further use; sadly, without the apple flavor.

Great recipe, only, as others had said before, chicken was slightly bland. Second time I made it, I added 1 teaspoon each of sage, thyme, and a pinch of both of salt and pepper to the chicken, with great success.
