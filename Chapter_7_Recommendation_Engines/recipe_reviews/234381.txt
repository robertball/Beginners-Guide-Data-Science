Great wing recipe! I've cooked wings a lot of different ways, but this was the best I think. They were a hit (although the kitchen was a mess!).

Way too much work. Smoke then fry then grill.

This recipe is awesome! We use Old Bay seasoning and skip the deep frying. We go from the smoker, dip the wings in the sauce and straight to the grill.
