This pie is fabulous and so simple to make!  I actually made it for Thanksgiving last year thinking a few people might try it.  I had to fight to get a half piece!  I do recommend using real whipped cream, but otherwise the pie is perfect.

This has been a requested family favorite since I found this recipe in a magazine many years ago. The mix of flavors is just YUM-O

This pie is great!! So easy. My problem was that I could not find it in the allrecipes search. I had to copy all the info from the bottom of the page I had. Do recipes get removed after awhile? It was only November when I first printed it....

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house.  All of the other left over dessert was sent home with guests, but not this one!  My friend's husband wanted to keep it!  The raspberry and lemon flavors compliment each other perfectly! It was a cinch to make and I definately will again - thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe looked different than I imagined, but it was the most requested pie at Thanksgiving out of a large selection.  The tart raspberries were wonderful with the custard lemon.  The only change I would make is to add some fresh raspberries on the top for plating.

The lemon custard is outstanding (and oh-so-simple)!!!  We first tried the pie without any whipped topping, but my husband and I both felt that the raspberries were too tart.  I made my own extra-sweet whipped cream (1 c. heavy whipping cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, 3 tbsp. confectioners' sugar) to balance the tartness from the raspberries.  It's great like that.  But be forewarned, it is too tart if you try to eat it without the whipped topping.  If you want a pie without whipped topping, you could use the sweetened frozen raspberries instead of plain.

This was fantastic.  I'm not a fan of whipped topping but I knew the raspberries would be sour so while they were on the saucepan, I added sugar so that they were still tart, but not bitter. That way, when combined with the sweet pie, I ended up with a perfect combination. I would definitely make this again, especially because it's so easy!

I made this for a pie contest, and It took second place.  I felt very guilty considering all the other pies were more complex (homemade apple, etc) and this was sooooooo easy.  The only change I would make is to use a shortbread crust.

Love this pie! It's been a favorite of mine since I was a teenager.  I normally make the pie exactly as the recipe calls for.  However, when raspberries are in season, I use two pints of fresh raspberries instead of the frozen.  YUMMY either way
