Very tasty and filling. I did not have the fried onions on hand and the dish seemed to not need the added flavor. There is alot going on here! My husband raved and had 2 helpings. For a meat and potatose guy, he left the table full and satisfied. I enjoyed all the texture and flavors. We will be making this again.

I made this for Mother's Day when my brother and his vegetarian girlfriend were coming over. Everyone loved it, including my mom and husband. Very flavorful. I especially loved the crunch the fried onions supplied. I would probably cut down on pest a little next time to reduce the oil level.

Great flavor- my husband and I loved it!  We actually only used about a 1/2 cup of pesto to cut down the fat a bit, and it didn't taste like it was missing it at all.

This was delicious. Both my wife and I liked it.  I fried the mushrooms at low heat first to get that carmelized mushroom flavor.  I substituted scallions for the canned onions and kalamata olives for black olives and added a half a sweet red pepper cut into slices for color and a little sweetness and sauteed these veggies with the celery. I used fresh chopped sage and added it when I fried the gnocchi.  Frying the gnocchi, on one side only, adds a very pleasant texture to the gnocchi - crispy and chewy at the same time.  I made the beans from scratch and added some fresh sage at the end of cooking the beans.  This gave the beans some sage flavor as well.

Way too many flavors coming together in one bowl... definitely needs to be scaled down. I suggest leaving out the celery + black olives for starters.. maybe do sauteed onions instead of the fried... that might help this out a bit.

I love the way the textures mingle in this dish - i reduced the amount of pesto slightly, but otherwise prepared to the letter. Great vegetarian option, will make again.

Very good recipe. I substituted a diced sauteed onion for the canned fried onions and omitted the olives.

Tastes as good as it looks and was fairly easy to make.  I made it for Easter dinner tonight and I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I made this dish tonight for supper. The only thing I didn't have on hand were the onions, but I don't feel it affected the flavor at all.  It is very easy to make and my husband had 2 helpings! I will be making this when we have get togethers this summer.
