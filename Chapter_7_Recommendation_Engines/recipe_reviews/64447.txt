I've been making this dish for several months now and swear by it! It's better with lamb than beef and ranges from good to great. I substitute marinara with spaghetti sauce and the elaborate white sauce with cheese sauce. My friends and i love it!

This was ok, but I think it would work better with ground beef. I am not able to get hold of ground lamb very often, and thought this was a bit of a waste. Thanks anyway.

This was good, but a little bland. We added some shredded parmesan on top to give it an extra little something. My husband and daughter say they would eat it again.

This is a favorite recipe of our family!  Even my children love it.  I usually don't add mushrooms, because I rarely have them on hand and it still turns out perfect :)

This was okay, but I really felt that it needed some more spice - some more flavoring.

I got ground lamb at an amazing price and wanted something kid-friendly so I could introduce my children in a comfort-food kind of way. This recipe did a great job. My kids have asked me to make it again.
