Pretty great.  My first-time-through modifications (based on everyone else's reviews) are also my recommendations:
- go a little light on the flour (either sift it or fluff the flour as you scoop out your cupfuls) 
- go a little heavy on the pureed pumpkin
- DOUBLE the pumpkin pie spice
- add 1 tsp. cinnamon
- before putting in oven, sprinkle top of loaves with chopped pecans (or other nuts) and a blend of cinnamon & sugar

I used four mini-loaf pans and baked them for 50 minutes at the recommended temp - they came out perfect.  A lovely color, texture and flavor - pecans perfectly roasted.  Recipe seems like it would accommodate even more moisture.  For a denser bread, perhaps add another egg, more pumpkin, or a little applesauce next time?

If I would have reviewed this recipe the day I made it, I would only have given it three stars.  It didn't immediately have the strong spice and pumpkin flavor I was looking for.

However, the next day I tried it again and I changed my mind.  This is a moist bread that keeps well and improves in flavor.

Next time I think I will top with a cinnamon-sugar mixture as mentioned in a previous review (just to see if it makes a difference on that first day).

Very good. I added 1-1/2 cups of raisins that had been plumped in boiling water, cloves, nutmeg and a touch of ginger along with a lots of cinnamon

Yummy, definitely a 5 star recipe from the whole gang, I mixed this by hand with a wire whisk and a spatula so easy too, always a bonus

When I made this bread my family and friends inhailed the bread.  A change of pace you could add nuts to the bread to make it more interesting.  (use 1 cup of chopped nuts in the mixture, place it in last)  ENJOY

It wasn't very moist, although the flavor was fine.  But, I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

I won't make it again.  The last word I would use for this recipe is "awesome."  It was dry, salty, and below average.  I made it 3 times.  The first time, it was dry and salty.  The second time, I added raisins and walnuts.  It tasted dry and salty but with raisins and walnuts.  The third time, I added extra sugar, extra oil and one additional egg (along with the raisins and walnuts; this third time, it was a completely different recipe and tasted pretty good...but still not "awesome."  Bottom line, don't bother.

I used applesauce instead of oil and put pumkin seeds on top of one loaf.  Very moist bread.  Very easy to make, will definately make again.  Next time I might put a little more pumpkin pie spice in.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out perfect!  BIG hit with the whole family, and I'm getting ready to make more (2nd batch of the day).  It is so simple to make and a big payoff!  I used one regular loaf pan and two small ones.  Baking time was 50 minutes

This turned out really delicious. I made one loaf and put the rest of the batter in muffin tins. I baked the muffins about 30 minutes and the bread as directed. My housemates gobbled it up in no time!

This is a wonderful bread. I live in Mexico so i can't buy pumpkin pie spice so I mix my own and keep it in a plastic bag. I also keep ground cloves in a plastic bag and one night mistakenly used 2 teaspoons of cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice. Everone raved about the taste!

mmmmm.... good! Thanks! I also added cinnamon sugar on top and added a bit of cinnamon into the batter and a little splash of apple cider because the batter seemed thick.

Absolutely amazing.  I did double the pie spice and add a few dashes of cinnamon.  I also used freshly pureed pumpkin - and WOW.  Just wow.  Moist.  Delicious.  Exactly what we were hoping for.

This was absolutely delicious!! I did add to it though just because I like what I added. I added another egg, 2 tsp. cinnamon and half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips. My family LOVED it! We thought it was better then Great Harvest, a local bakery. YUMMY!! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  Make it a couple of days ahead though as this bread definitely improves with age!  I added honey roasted sunflower seeds to the batter and also sprinkled more seeds on the top of the loaf before baking.  The crunch of the sweetened seeds was excellent!

This came out AMAZING!!  I used rice flour instead of wheat flour because my son has a gluten allergy, and you would NEVER know the difference.  I did use 1 full tsp of baking powder, I substituted 1/4 c. brown sugar for regular sugar, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon (per other suggestions), and I did 1/3 c. applesauce and 1/3 c. oil.  The consistency was PERFECT.  Very moist and held together well.  My whole family gobbled it up!!  This one is going down in the family cookbook...

I made this bread with my husband a few days ago and it was delicious and very moist! I did the recipe just like it stated, except I used one can of canned pumpkin because I figured it was the same as pumpkin puree but I could be wrong? And I also added a bit more of the pumpkin spice and then sprinkled cinnamon on top before putting it in the oven. I will probably just add the cinnamon to the mix next time. I baked mine for 50 minutes and it was perfect and moist. Will definitely be making again!

This is a decent pumpkin bread, I like that it was simple to make. To make it even easier I used the sweetened and spiced pumpkin, halved the sugar. I added 1/2 cup of pecans and replaced 1/2 the regular flour with whole wheat and it still turned out fine.

I halved the recipe to make 1 loaf, and made the following modifications: added 1 tsp cinnamon (needed spices), Used 1 egg (less than half of 3 eggs), 1/3 cup oil (less than half of 2/3 cup) and a whole can of pumpkin (more than 1 cup pumpkin).  VERY moist and delicious!!! A keeper.

This was moist, delicious and flavorful.  I did make a couple of substitions: subbed in 1 cup of whole wheat flour plus added an extra 1/3 cup of pumpkin puree.  Also, as some other reviewers had done, I sprinkled a cinnamon-sugar mixture prior to baking.  While it's good fresh out of the oven, it really does taste better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and I love it! It's great as-is, but you can try adding nuts, cinnamon-sugar on top,  or even substituting half cup  brown sugar plus one cup white, for the two cups white sugar to reduce the total amount without losing any sweetness.  Thanks for a go-to never- fail recipe!

I was looking for an easy pumpkin bread since I have never tried making it before. This really fit the bill. It's really easy to follow and seems to be very tolerant of changes by what you have on hand. For example, I changed pumpkin spice to 2tsp cinnamon, 2tsp nutmeg, 1tsp ground clove. I also modified the sugar from 3 cups white to 2 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, since I ran out of white sugar. I also used baking powder instead of soda because I miss read the recipe and it still turned out great! Tastes great either alone or with honey nut cheese if you like the nut flavor without having nuts in the bread as I do. Great recipe and very easy to follow if your new to making breads.

It is absolutely great. I did add a box of coconut instant pudding and one more egg. I also simmered some raisins in water with cinnamon, and cloves and nutmeg. I added the raisins as well as a little of the raisin water.  I didn't have to bake it as long either. We really like it as do my friends.

I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour for the 1/2 cup all purpose flour and added soaked, dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of flax seed flour and my family loved it!  This recipe also makes great muffins so it would be great at a fall potluck.  Great recipe!

Wanted to add a fix for those who mentioned this bread was a little dry.  Just make as directed but add a box of dry vanilla pudding mix!  It will be super moist and yummy.  I did have to cook this bread for quite a bit longer than mentioned and had to cover it for the last 1/2 hr or it would have burned.  I think I'll cook it at 325 for about 75 min. next time.  THANKS!

I have been making this bread for awhile. I make it in individual loaf pans and bake for about 30-35 minutes. I took it to a bake sale at work. I couldn't even set the bread on the table before it was sold. Everyone I know loves this bread and beg for the recipe.

I changed a couple of things, 1/2 cup of plumped raisins and used 12x9 pyrex pan as I was short 1 bread pan - added 1 lg tbspn of sour cream and 1/4 cup more pumpkin, baked for 45 minutes and covered with foil promptly after removing from oven - this is a great recipe as it forgave the changes I made -The kids love it and lots of fiber too.

Let me tell you, this was my first bread making experience and it turned out awesome! I used allspice instead of pumpkin spice, added nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, ground cloves. I also topped it with cinnamon sugar as suggested above. Also, I used four mini loaf tins and had extra so I used it to fill four cupcake cups. I will see how the moisture retains within the bread tomorrow.  Thanks Sara!

This is really good. I made 1/2 of it as muffins and the other 1/2 as a loaf. Nuts would be fabulous in this recipe!

This recipe was ok. My main complaint is that by the time the inside finished cooking, the outside was burned. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder, so it did rise decently. In the end, the inside is pretty good, but since the outside was pretty dark brown, it's just so-so.

I make it every fall. Just came back to get the recipe to make it for the first time fall 2018. My family loves this recipe. 

The only change I make is with all purpose gluten free flour. This recipe is great with fresh pumpkin.

This recipe is AWESOME! I've been using this recipe for the past 4 years and my family loves it! It's moist and yummy! It's one of my  no-fail recipe that I also use for gift-giving (on the rare occasions that I'm able to get a loaf wrapped before my family tears into it ).

I used fresh puréed pumpkin for my bead. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used half brown half white sugar and also added a pinch more spice mix. I used the Pumpkin Pie Spice I from this website. The bread is great! It's a bit drier than I imagined it would be, but it is a great recipe.

Great! I cut the recipe in half (two eggs) mixed both white and brown sugar. Used coconut oil to grease the bread pan. My boyfriend loved it!
