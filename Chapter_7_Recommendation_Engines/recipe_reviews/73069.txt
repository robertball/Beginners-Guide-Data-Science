Terrific! I made this exactly as written with one exception - used Stevia (fake sugar) in place of sugar. It's hard to tell how much juice a lime will provide so these will taste a tad bit limey-differently each time. ENJOY!

This one is worth all the effort, I used 4 key limes and 2 tsp. of Splenda sweetner, all that I need now is some beach sand to sink my toes into! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great!  I used limeade instead of sweetened lime juice.
