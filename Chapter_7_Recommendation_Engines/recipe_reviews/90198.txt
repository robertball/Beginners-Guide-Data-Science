This is similar to a family recipe I make every year, but here are a few tips: the combination of peaches and oranges should not exceed 4 cups or it won't set, as someone already found out (their peaches were too big, i bet). Also, add some grated orange zest and 1/4 slivered almonds and you get more of a marmalade that can't be beat.

Too syrupy?  Once fruit is transparent (ready), transfer it with a slotted spoon to another bowl. Simmer on LOW, the syrup until thickened to your preference.  Place fruit back in, stir and bring to proper heat and then place in jars. This goes for any jam/preserve recipe.

The bad news is that the mixture never thickened like jam usually does. It just stayed runny. The good news is that now I have some delicious peach syrup for pancakes,waffles,and ice cream. I guess every disaster has a silver lining.

Followed the recipe but added 3 very tart apples and simmered gently for 2 1/2 hours.  Peeled the oranges though as I didn't want marmelade.  Tested the jam by taking a spoonful on a cold plate and found it felt and tasted like like jam.

Nice fresh-tasting jam.  Really easy to make and not too overpoweringly like marmalade.  My family really liked it.

Though others have raved about it mine did not come out well.  It tastes completely orange with no hint of peach at all.  I made sure that it was 4 cups worth of peaches like a previous poster said.  And I would highly recommend using pectin because mine still was syrupy.

The Jam set well, no issues there. I read somewhere that if you cook it too long, it will not turn out well. I cooked it for about 45 mins to 1 hour. Set perfectly. What I wasn't crazy about was the orange peel. It made it a little bitter and it tasted so much like orange not enough peach. I even cut the oranges down to 3. That is why it has 3 stars. Next time I might try it along with a teaspoon of Lemon juice and one apple for the pectin.

I make this all the time, I also add one lemon.  I put all the fruit through a meat grinder and it comes out wonderful.
One of my favorite jams.

This turned out not to my liking! The orange peel leaves a bitter aftertaste.  After reading the reviews those who had success modified the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out runny and bitter.  My recommendation: search for a better recipe.  The only reason I have a single star is because the review requires a star selection--I would give this recipe negative stars.

I was disappointed because I was looking for a peach jam and I ended up with marmalade. It'll be a good gift and I put 2 @ 1.75oz powdered pectin in mine and that helped it set more.

Was delicious but next time I will make the orange peel much smaller - as it took longer to cook because of the size. We enjoyed this alot!
