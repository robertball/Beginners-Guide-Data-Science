Great flavor, hubby gives it a big thumbs up.  Since I used the large portabella caps, I used 2 shrimp on each.  I also added just a bit of Italian bread crumbs on top.  :)

This recipe KICKS A$$! I added some chopped flat-leaf to the garlic butter and broiled the cheese to get it brown. We LOVED them and each ate 4 huge ones! Thanks,ambi - you got a hit! ;)

Great idea with shrimps.  I did the same as the last person, added breadcrumbs and also added chopped mushroom stem into butter & a little bit of oregano.  Serve with Pinot Grigio and BAM!

I made these for an appetizer party, and everyone loved them. I increased the recipe to make 24.  I precooked the mini-portabellas for five minutes upside down, mixed Italian breadcrumbs with the garlic butter in which I cooked the shrimp, placed a teaspoon of the crumb mixture on each mushroom cap, curled a shrimp on top and then added the cheese.  There weren't any left by the end of the night.

This is SO  DELICIOUS! I have now made these at least once a month since May 2009. I now always make 1-2 dozen with the 1/4 cup butter (sometimes up to 1/2 olive oil). As 'ambibambi' herself told me, definitely saute the mushrooms in the butter (with a crushed clove of garlic) before then sauteing the shrimp & minced garlic. I slightly undercook the shrimp so that it won't become overcooked in the baking. I have used both baby bellas (cremini) & regular white button mushrooms ~ equally delicious! I've also used many different cheese combinations:  only mozz.(which I find rather bland by itself, but still good); Kasseri cheese, which is a tangy, sharp cheese that tastes like a combination of Parmesan, Swiss, & mellow Monterey Jack; mozz. mixed with the assertive Kasseri; mozz. with sharp cheddar;  mozz. with Parmesan; Monterey jack. Every combination -  except all-cheddar - was nearly as delicious as my favorite: baby bellas + Kasseri cheese (with or without the mozz.). For serving, I strongly suggest to separate the mushrooms either after topping with cheese or after baking (the latter is harder because it's hot & you want to serve it quickly while hot) ~ so that guests won't have the cooling cheese pull off the cheese from other mushrooms. I put only a speck of garlic butter on the filled mushrooms, so that the appetizer does not drip while being eaten. Or else bake & serve this in individual ramekins, so guests can drip onto their own plate. A serving is 2? I think not!

I have to admit I was a little skeptical as I was making these that they would be flavorful enough; I kept thinking I could add a little X or a little Y, but I stayed true to the recipe and they are great!  I only used at most 2 TBSP butter and a dash of EVOO just to lighten it up a little, but other than that the ingredients remained the same.  After consulting w/ambi, I put the shroom caps (large Portabellas) in the oven for about 10 min first, then proceeded to fill and bake them.  Following the advice of prior reviewers, I broiled for about 2 min to get the tops golden brown.  My only *complain*, if you will, w/these is they're not real easy to eat (and get a bite of everything).   When I make them again (notice, I said "when"), I may chop the shrimp for eating ease.  Oh yeah, don't be an idiot like me and forget to take the tails of the shrimp....THANKS for a keeper, ambi!

this was so good! to make it a dinner i doubled it and served it with pesto pasta. i did follow the suggestions of some of the reviews and chopped the shrimp before i cooked it, baked 10 mins before filling with the shrimp mixture, used half butter and half olive oil. i also added some parsley, crushed red pepper, and some lemon juice, not that it needed it, just felt like doing it though. will definately make these for appetizers in the future. so easy and looked really impressive.

Not that you need ANOTHER 5 stars to convince yourself to try this, but I'm giving it,anyway! :) This is wonderful. I used small shrimp and topped with Italian blend cheese and broiled in the oven in my cast iron.  A huge hit and a great appetizer to our steak dinner. Thanks, ambi!

Thank you for looking at my recipe!  I have seen many people write in their reviews to precook the mushrooms.  I always do this!  I like my mushrooms soft, so I definitely recommend this step too.  Also, many people have stated that they didn't like it with portabellas, but the recipe doesn't call for portabellas.  I use regular old button mushrooms.  When I am feeling extra decadent I add bacon!  I have also replaced the shrimp with crab meat to mix it up, and it is FABULOUS!  I hope you all enjoy my favorite treat!

Let me start off by saying I HATE shrimp. This was my first time cooking them and the recipe turned out good. I even ate some of this....and liked it. Next time i'm gonna dice up the shrimp before stuffing the shrooms (since its the texture of shrimp im not a fan of). Also, as suggested by the sumitter, I sauteed the mushrooms in the butter/garlic sauce for about 10 min.

Wow, Ambibambi! These are out of this world! I ate two and DH ate the rest before I could bat an eye. I had to bake them a little longer and finally broiled them to brown the cheese. I put some of the sauteed garlic into the mushroom caps before placing the shrimp inside. MMMMMMMM! Thanks for a keeper!

I made these for company and instead of using 1 large shrimp, I used about 3 small salad shrimp per mushroom.  The end result was ok - but we found them a bit bland; the flavor of the mushroom overpowered both the garlic butter and the shrimp.

A nice idea, and really quite easily done. It just wasn't as good as I was expecting somehow. I will have to experiment some more, I guess. My guests liked them, but there was no WOW! factor.

I made this exactly as the submitter suggested, even though I was tempted to tweak.  My mushrooms were not done enough for our liking.  Next time I will doctor up a bit  and pre-cook the mushrooms a bit first as others suggested.  I love garlic butter, shrimp and mushrooms (what's not to love?)but will add a little white wine and lemon juice to it next time. Definitely don't skimp on the garlic butter!

I love mushrooms and I loved this appetizer! I prepared this a little differently.  I brushed some butter on my mushrooms and then baked them at 375  while I was preparing the shrimp.  Once the mushrooms were stuffed, I only needed to broil them for a couple minutes.

I made this for my card club's annual Christmas potluck and the ladies loved it!  As other reviewers suggested, I pre-cooked the mushrooms.  I also chopped the shrimp a bit, put mozzarella on the bottom and on the top of the shrimp and garlic butter; minced the mushroom stems in my food processor and sauted them with a little white wine and put them under the shrimp.  I topped them off with a light sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesano Reggiano and toasted panko crumbs, then poured all the rest of the garlic butter over the whole thing and broiled it.  One lady said it was like a bite of shrimp scampi heaven.  Thanks for the recipe, ambibambi!

I made this for lunch over the weekend, and it was fabulous.  The only problem I had was that I only made the 6 for myself and I wanted more!  Thanks for the recipe Ambi, this is a keeper.

This is a weak four stars. I'm a beginner cook so I read the reviews carefully. I did cook the mushrooms first as a poster recommended but didn't know to put it cap down. Learn from my mistake because otherwise you have a cap full of water. Also..... how come no one mentioned that the mushrooms then shrink? Almost in half! I could barely put any of the mix in! Thank goodness this wasn't for a crowd. I ended up crowding them together to put cheese on top. No way could they be an appetizer, they were the size of a quarter!

Made these this evening~~fantastic.  I tweaked just a bit, though.  I sauteed baby bellas in the garlic butter for five minutes, turning halfway through.  I roughly chopped the shrimp, and added about two tablespoons of bread crumbs to shrimp/garlic butter mixture.  We loved every bite.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Size does matter.  Best result came from smaller mushrooms because you can pop them into your mouth whole.  Used baby bellas, cooked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  Get the finest graded cheese you can and don't fret if it all falls off.  Use parchment paper in pan to keep all of the juices close.  Trying with scallops next.

For me it is important to cook the mushrooms first to prevent these from being too messy to eat as a 'finger food', it will release a lot of the water from the mushrooms.  These were very good.  Next time I will try Jarlsberg cheese for more flavor and top with Panko bread crumbs tossed with a slight amount of olive oil so it will brown nicely.  Since I will be cooking the mushrooms first I will broil for 2 to 3 minutes instead of baking as not to over cook the shrimp.

Great recipe! Since I'm always looking for shortcuts and healthier ways to cook food I used olive oil, didn't sautee shrimp - just put thawed precooked shrimp ( 3 large ones for 1 mushroom cap ), omitted garlic ( didn't have it ). Turned out well! Next time I'll use more salt and some chopped herbs ( rosemary? sage?) and gruyere cheese ( I love anything with gruyere ).

I loved these!  I didnt have whole mushrooms, so I used the sliced ones I did have.  I layered the sliced mushrooms on the bottom of the dish, then layered the shrimp on top and the garlic butter and cheese to follow.  Worked out perfectly!

This was delish!!  I used baby bella shrooms.  I used cooked shrimp (what I had) and diced it up.  Some of my shroom were smallish.  Only thing I added was some croutons spun through the food processor.  I did pre-bake the shrooms for about 10 min. to extract some of the moisture.  Thanks, Ambi, for the post.  These were the star of the party!

I was looking for a different appetizer to use some shrimp I had in the freezer to serve at a cocktail party.  These were a big hit.

They were good, but eat them quickly - if you leave them out on a plate for more than 5 minutes they'll be swimming in a puddle of water.

too much butter for me for only six mushrooms. I made it again and made 15 mushrooms with 15 shrimp and found the butter to be balanced to serve as an appetizer.

My guests loved this appetizer! Looks very sophisticated though very easy to put together. The only thing I would do when I make this again is use a baking tray that has holes in it so the mushroom liquid can drain away. I had to keep taking the tray out to siphon off the liquid that accumulated during baking.

This recipe is so easy, and it tastes awesome. Have made it twice. Didn't have fresh garlic the last time so I made it with granulated or garlic powder. I really don't measure because I make this 6 of them for each family member, with a salad and nice toasted French stick to soak up all the juices. It is our whole meal. Thanks for the recipe ambibambi.

MUST pre-cook the mushrooms. I'm not a fan of raw mushrooms and thats pretty much how they turned out. If I make again, there will be alot of tweeking this recipe.

Pretty tasteless, all in all. The shrimp was bland,even with extra garlic, the mushrooms (precooked) had little flavor to add, and the cheese didn't even help. Very let down by this recipe and won't make again.

I used baby bellas and they seemed really fresh and hard... so I chose to cook for about 5 minutes in the garlic butter to soften some *and* to release some of the moisture:(they colored the garlic butter a brown color, which to me was fine). I needed to let set in a warm oven for awhile, and they were still perfect with an extra 10 or so minutes, even with cooking the mushrooms first. Great presentation with the tails *up* and adding a sprinkling of chopped parsley (even though it was a little hard putting the cheese on that way). This is a recipe that I will use again and again. But... never will I make only 6! Thanks, Ambiambi for an outstanding recipe.

EXCELLENT!  So easy to make too!  I took Sunny's suggestion and added flat leaf parsley for color and freshness.  I would highly recommend NOT cooking the mushrooms ahead of time as someone suggested as they cook up nicely just the way the recipe is.  My girlfriends gobbled them up then broke out a loaf of crusty bread and sopped up the leftover scampi juices.  Thanks Ambibambi!

The first time I tried this was great!!  I had, in my stash of "kitchen stuff", some Coquille Shells, so when I wanted an impressive appetizer for a special dinner...I just soaked the large shells in water for awhile. Instead of just putting the filled mushrooms in a pan to bake, and then transfer to plate, I transferred the beautiful filled shells.  The soaked shells didn't break and it was truly spectacular to serve!!  A different kind of 'Rockefella'!! PS.  I also used "I can't believe it's not Butter", because at 65, I want us to be able to say "I can't believe we lived this Long", especially since I just have always loved to cook hearty!! LOL

What a wonderful recipe! I'm so glad that I tried this at super bowl! They were gone in a flash! I'm also thankful I was able to get to  Ambibambi on a post just hours before the SB and she told me to bake the mushrooms first to cook the water out before adding the shrimp and cheese. They turned out perfect. Also, because I made 30 of them and put them in a regular casserole dish they transported well, they were so crowded that they didn't move one bit. I want to try these next time as a side with steak. XOXO :)

I followed the recipe exactly and I can't imagine that it could be any better.  I placed three each on individual, long narrow plates, poured over the jus and served with a slice of rough torn french bread from the oven. It was simple perfection.

It was excellent I made a dinner out of them just bread and shrimcargot!! Yummy!!!! I think the mushrooms should be cooked a little bit more though... so they are more crispy so next time I think I will cook the mushrooms for about 5-10 mins before then add the shrimp and garlic and butter and cheese then let it cook ... so it will be crispy and the water from the mushrooms will be evaporated... but still yummy!!!

I def. tweaked this recipie.  Added twice the garlic, sprinkled on bread crumbs, salt, pepper and lemon juice.  For the reviews that said the mushrooms weren't done enough, here's a trick from my mother:  Bring 6 cups water, 2 tbs lemon juice & mushroom caps to boil, reduce heat and simmer 6 minutes.  Drain on paper towels while you're making the filling.  You can even store the boiled & drained caps for 24 hours.  Proceed as recipie directs for filling.  Please note!  Mushroom caps will shrink by HALF when you boil them, so make sure you're using extra large caps.

These are wonderful as the recipe reads.  I added a bit of horseradish to the garlic for a bit of zip.  I may try some wasabi as an alternative to the horseradish.

This was wonderful.  If you like mushrooms, shrimp and cheese, you'll like this recipe.  I used frozen, raw shrimp.  Thawed them out but did not pre cooked.  Baked them on top of the mushrooms just until they were pink. Very tender.

My family of meat eating lovers, devoured these in minutes!  Really really good.  I bought a pound of shrimp, and did not have enough mushrooms.  So I just put those on the baking sheet (always line with parchment paper) and drizzled the butter over them.

I followed recipe as is, along with adding some bread crumbs before filling.  EXCELLENT.  I did not pre-cook mushrooms either.

DH kept raving about this!  He brought home small portabellas, so we chopped the shrimp so they would fit - next time I'll chop it finer and use more cheese.  Maybe a pinch of bread crumbs on top to?

These were good. The shrimp I had were to big so i had to cut them. But they were tasty.

These were highly recommended by many on the AR recipe exchange, but I had a little trouble with the texture. I'm not normally texturally-challenged, but I agree with another reviewer that they'd be better if the shrimp was chopped. Thanks for the post.

This was fantastic.  I can't believe I waited this long to try it.  I only changed a little.  While melting the butter I added just a little garlic salt.  Then sauteed the shrimp in it.  After cleaning the mushroom caps out I added a little Mozerella cheese about 1 tsp of the butter mixture and then topped with the shrimp.  I then mixed af few tablespoons of bread crumbs to the butter mixture.  I then placed a little of the bread crumbs mixture on top of the shripm and added a little more mozerella cheese.  Baked until melted and heated through.  YUMMY... We love Escargot but to me this tops it by far and will become one of my regular recipes for special events!!!  Thank you!!!!

This is so delicious and so incredibly easy to make.  I stuffed the cheese into the mushroom caps first rather than sprinkling it on top because I thought that would mean less clean up later, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  I have spent a not insignificant amount of money on similar appetizers while dining out, and this is FAR superior.  Thanks, Ambi!

I followed the recommendations of others for this recipe--cut shrimp, added more cheese and pre-baked the bellas.  I also added Old Bay...being from the Bay area that's a given with shrimp!  I thought they were good but not great, however, the party I took them too people raved.  Lot of work involved for these fussy little things.  Next time, and yes I will make again I would add even more Old Bay and not pre-bake bellas as long.  Thanks for a good one!

Made this as an entree using Portobellos.  I baked the caps at 375 while I was preparing the rest of the recipe.  I added some seasoned breadcrumbs, grated pecorino romano cheese to the sauteed chopped mushroom stems and shrimp with garlic butter. Stuffed caps and returned to oven for about 15 minutes - delicious.

This is an excellent spin on Charleston's Shrimp Cargot!  I used havarti cheese, however, as this is what Charleston's uses.  Love the mushroom cap idea.  Kudos!

A hit for the holidays…  I tried this recipe out for Christmas this year as a appetizer (the goal this year was to try something different in the menu department) and everyone loved it. It’s a simple yet unique recipe that makes me wonder how I never came up with it. Lol. All in all I have a new dish that I’ll be bringing to all the family functions.  My only note is that because it has such a subtle yet intense flavor (oxymoron, I know) you feel like you need something to offset it. A dip on sauce (aside from the butter garlic mixture that you make) What I did was create a simple soy and sugar sauce (see recipe for BATWINGS) the sweetness of this adds a flare of fun to the elegant mushroom dish…

YUMM!! Used the correct amount of butter, added 3 minced cloves, used about 12 shrooms, and a bag of shrimp. Stuffed the shrooms with the shrimp, then just stuck in the extra shrimp in between. After drizzling with the garlic butter, I sprinkled a cheese mix (asiago, parm, mozza) and then sprinkled with a bit of dried basil. Beautiful! Our guests were impressed! Thanks!!

I doubled the mushroom, kept the amount of garlic butter the same, chopped the shrimp and added a lot more cheese. Also broiled for a few mins to brown the top. I plan to make again and cut down on some of the fat and try out different cheeses.

this recipe was great as i was able to prepare the mushrooms and the shrimp ahead of time.covered with saran wrap and popped them into the oven when the guests arrived.Made 2 packages of regular white musrooms with the stems removed.  Cooked in olive oil and butter , seasoned with salt, draiined them. then cooked the shrimpas the recipe says, removed and added breadcrumbs to the garlic butter as some other reviewers suggested and spooned the crumbs into the caps,covered with the shrimp and placed in the oven. sooo good.

Yum! We pulled off the shell on the tail, so these could be more easily eaten. For the cheese we used cheddar that had some crumbled bacon mixed in. We will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe as stated  and liked it but had some problems. My mushrooms didn't cook through. The amount of butter/garlic was perfect and gave a good flavor without being greasy.  My guests and I had trouble eating them. I'm not sure if it was because the shrimp were as big as my mushroom caps or not. Next time, I would chop the shrimp.  While these had a nice flavor, I kept thinking something was missing. I think maybe some bread crumbs and either bacon or a splash of lemon.  I enjoyed them and they were all eaten but I just think it needs an extra tweak to take it to 5 stars for me.  Thanks for the recipe and I'm glad I finally got to try them!

I don't know why I procrastinated so much to make this recipe. I can't believe what I've been missing all this time. We absolutely loved it! At first I thought it called for too much butter, but we sopped up all that golden goodness with a crusty baguette until the plate was licked clean. Amber, you're a smart cookie. We are hooked!

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy to prepare.  I didn't have the parmesan cheese on hand so used grated mozza, and they were still delicious.  This is definitely an appetizer that will impress your company.

This appetizer is a big hit with my family, and I get requests to make it often.  If you have mushroom lovers in your family, you may want to make multiple of this recipe, because it gets devoured quickly!  Thanks for the great recipe, ambibambi!

Good, but not great. I didn't have any real problems with this, but 21-25 is a medium... not a large. Adjust the mushroom size accordingly. It has a lot of potential. It's just that as-is, it didn't do much for me. It *IS* a great idea though...

OMG, Yummy!!  This is phenomenal.  I did as someone else suggested and chopped up the shrimp so it was easier to handle.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I did not care for this, but my husband liked it alot. The only thing I did different from the recipe was add bread crumbs as others suggested, I would leave off if I ever tried again. Also, if I try again I will use portabellas because regular mushrooms are just too small.

This was the best, delicious a new appetizer for my house.  I sprinkled a little bread crumbs just underneath the cheese and added a little white wine in the bottom of the pan.  Mixed mozzarella with a four cheese blend.  Thanks for the great easy recipe.

Ok so my fiance gave it a 4.5, but I did not see the point in ruining ur average.  Why 4.5 who knows!! I don't eat mushrooms so I am baseing my review on him.  I did however, eat some of the shrimp w/out the mushroom and I thought it was delicious.  THe only thing I did differently was use White Mushrooms because it was all I had.  When I make them again I will use the bigger mushrooms that the recipe calls for.  Mine were too small.  Great Recipe! GO Amber, Go Amber!
ADDITIONAL REVIEW. I made these again last night for company.  Following the recipe exactly.  I suggest you must use the larger portabello mushrooms.  He said it was twice as good as the first time I made it!

These are extraordinarily delicious.   I have been making them for a while, originally just the way written. The only thing I do is modify the method a bit so they are more like stuffed mushrooms.   I barely cook the shrimp in the garlic butter (which I brown slightly) then remove and chop small when it is cool enough to handle.  (This step can be done ahead).  The shrimp are still a bit raw but they will cook more in oven.  I then pour the garlic butter over the shrimp stuffed mushrooms, trying to get as much into the mushroom (rather than the pan).  Top with finely grated Jack or mozzarella.  Bake for 15-20 mins then broil til cheese is golden.  My guests can never get enough.  Thanks Ambibambi for a wonderful recipe.  Yum yum.  I would give it ten stars if I could.

We loved this recipe completely and made it exactly as is!  I may think about dicing the shrimp after cooking them and stuffing the mushrooms that way next time around.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a hit at my dinner party. I did tweak it a bit after reading the reviews. I baked the mushrooms first for like 10 minutes while I cooked the shrimp. I also added some Goya Adobo seasoning over the shrimp and mushrooms, as I thought it needed more flavor. I also broiled it towards the end to brown the cheese.

This was a real hit at my thanksgiving this year. Made about 25 and they were all gone within minutes. I'd suggest adding a bit of garlic and lemon juice to the shrimp when cooking them. Perfect size appetizer and delicious as well.

It looks pretty, but the taste is just okay. Maybe it's my fault as I had previously frozen mushroom caps to save them for this and they did come out very mushy. Also, make sure you check your bag of shrimp to see whether or not it is already peeled! I just rinsed and cooked without realizing until it was too late; so we had to pick apart the little creation. I also used garlic powder instead of fresh to save on time and mess.  Despite my mishaps, I still thought it would be spectacular. I think maybe some kind of seasoning would pep these up. Won't make again though. Sorry!

This was amazing - I'm sorry I didn't make more, but I will soon!  Because it's not full of cream cheese - like most stuffed mushrooms - you can really enjoy the mushroom and shrimp flavors.  I did brine the shrimp for about 20 minutes, but other than that, I followed the recipe (oh, and a rough chop to the shrimp).  I had great success making these ahead.  I par cooked the shrimp in the garlic butter, roasted the mushrooms (upside down) for 10 minutes, assembled, and refrigerated until party time.  I baked for about 20 minutes and broiled to brown the cheese.  Thanks ambibambi, for a winner!

I thought these were pretty good.  They had really good flavor.   I used baby bellas and made the recipe exactly as written.  I had to put two shrimps in some that were a little bigger.  I wasnt sure if I should leave the tails on or off but I ended up taking them off.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was great, I'm glad I finally remembered to buy shrimp. I wish that I would have followed others advice and chopped the shrimp, but I will do that next time. I used portabellas but am going to try it with different mushrooms to see which ones we like the best with this. My husband said that that the bellas may have been a bit too much. I served this as dinner with garlic pasta and it was fantastic. I will definetly be making this regularly. Thanks Amber!

These were good, but I don't think 5 star good... maybe if you added some chopped basil and bread crumbs it would enhance the flavor.

Matt loved these!  I too cut up the shrimp because they didn't fit my mushrooms.  Also prebaked the shrooms plain for about 10 min. before filling.  Can't wait to make them for company.

Excellent and very easy.  I tripled the recipe for a get-together (with 5 "shrimp eaters") and by the end of the night, all 18 were gone.  I made up ahead of time, stuck in the fridge, and prepared as the guests arrived.  Took a little extra time because the butter was cold and congealed ... but SUPER easy and worth the little effort it takes to make them.  Highly recommended!

I wanted to say that it was the most awesome....what can go wrong, cheese + mushrooms + shrimp. We used the large mushrooms and would definitely use the smaller next time. It was just too large for an appetizer and messy too!

This is an amazing appetizer. Everyone just gobbled it up. After reading other reviews, I chopped up the mushroom stems and the prawns. And yes, there was way too much butter. I probably halve the quantity of butter and double the quantity of garlic (we love our garlic here). I added a pinch or oregano and chilli flakes to the butter too. I heated the mushroom caps for 10 mins before filling it and then another 15 mins. Will definitely be making this again :) Just have to find button mushrooms again.. they are not easily available in my corner of the world.

Very good! I sauteed chopped shrimp with garlic, onion, bell pepper, halved cherry tomatoes, and parsley before filling pre-baked portabello caps and broiling. So meaty and good atop rissoto!

This is great!!  Served at a party and everyone loved it.  Made it X 4, and all I did different was to only use 3/4 cups butter and I chopped the shrimp up a little.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These are the best. I made a triple batch but cut down on the fat and used half olive oil. I also chopped the shrimp up and baked the mushrooms a bit before filling them. I will be making these on a regular basis. Thanks!!

Excellent!  I love the flavors together.  I did as another reviewer and cooked the mushrooms for a bit, to get some of the water out of them and then baked.  The kid did try them, but sorry Ambi.. he is not a fan.  He said would have liked it without the mushroom, or if you would deep from the whole combination.... ummmmm now there is an idea.  He loves fried mushrooms. Thanks Ambi.. I loved it!

I wish there had been even more butter and garlic, but that is my only suggestion. Also I used it with baby bella mushrooms and I made 20 for 4 people - they were gone! I got 1.

Excellent!! Used 2 shrimp per mushroom, sprinkled with some Italian bread crumbs, then drizzled the extra garlic butter, used a 4 cheese pizza blend, and added some white wine to the bottom of the pan. They were so very good, got rave comments from the family. I also used half butter half olive oil. Will defiantely make again. Thanks Ambibambi!!

What a great alternative to Escargot which is made with snails. This was just excellent and will be a nice option when I think people might not like Escargot. I served this with fresh baugette bread and topped our bread with this. Of course then we could mop all that wonderful garlic butter with the bread also. I will serve this many times over when I want to impress my guest and yet not be afraid if they will eat it.

This was wonderful. As other reviewers suggested, I also added Italian Bread crumbs to the mix along with the mushroom stems...(used regular white mushrooms). I am a Realtor and served these at my sunset OPEN HOUSE   for potential buyers.  What HUGE HIT.  People seemed to stay much longer than other opens I have had and several asked for the recipe! Thanks Amby...maybe I owe you part of my commission!  This will be a staple open house treat!

Wonderful! I "dried" out my mushrooms prior to filling due to other comments.  I also chopped up my shrimp finely and at the end put the dish under the broiler for a few minutes. I made 12 since I wasn't sure if we would like them and my daughter ate 6, yes, 6 and she was asking for more. I have been asked to make them again soon, like tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good.  Took other's suggestions. Baked shitake mushroom caps for 7 mins after salting. Used Italian breadcrumbs & added chopped mushroom stems and broiled for about 2 minutes. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Not much too add from other reviews, except they are filling.  Especially if you have the french baguette.

HUGE HIT!! Added a sprinkling of bread crumbs as others did and used 3 Tbl butter, 1 Tbl olive oil, added S&P. Baked for 10 mins then a minute under the broiler. My sister loved them so much she asked me to make them again before her visit at my home ends in a couple days.  So simple and easy, but with impressive looking and tasting results.  Thanks Amber!

I really liked this, 2 of my fav foods combined, shrimp and mushrooms! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 evoo, chopped the mushroom stems and added to the sautee mix. I thought the mushrooms themselves could have had a bit more flavor (maybe sprinkle with salt?) but this a great base recipe, and other seasonings could easily be added to liven it up. Thanks, really enjoyed this one! Oh, extra note, next time I make this I will have a good crusty French bread to mop up the sauce! I did sprinkle with a bit of Italian bread crumbs as other reviewers suggested.

Husband said it was a three , I'm giving it a four.
It was good but the flavors weren't melding as I thought they would.

Yummy in my tummy!  Actually, I only had 2 of the 6 that I made as I thought I'd be nice and surprise my mother with the remainder (as well as the toffee caramel squares from this site)for a light "lunch"/snack.  She ate all of them in one sitting!  LOL...  I think I would do the same as others have posted as far as adding some italian style bread crumbs or  maybe add some oregano to the garlic butter.  Either way, this is a fast, easy, delicious recipe! Thanks for posting!

Great! Very tasty, but you have to eat them right away or the cheese gets cold and doesn’t look as appetizing as when they first come out of the oven.

These were even good cold, as a dish taken to a wine tasting.  Next time I will look for grated mozzarella, as it was challenging placing large shreds on the mushroom caps.

Sorry but these just didn't work for us. Shrooms needed cooked more but I didn't want rubber shrimp. Seems like shrimp was overpowered by shrooms. Won't make again.

This recipe is simple and always a hit!  At least the shrimp and mushrooms & garlic are healthy. :)  I added more garlic than called for, but then, I always add more garlic to everything :).

These were good.  Like many reviewers, I briefly sauteed the mushrooms in garlic butter, added bread crumbs to the garlic butter and then chopped up the shrimp.  I used Gouda cheese on top.

Ended up having to buy a much larger shrimp (last minute, couldn't find appropriate size) and therefore muuuch larger mushrooms.  Turned less into a bite-sized treat and more into OMIGOD, HOW DO I EAT THAT?

S.O. definitely gave two thumbs up.

Another in a long list of 5 stars!! I broke my tradition by modifying it the first time I made it .... but several reviews just made sense. Like others I cut up the shrimp once they were cooked ....... I also added a bit of Italian bread crumbs to the butter / garlic mixture. They were awesome!! Next time I think I will add a dash of Tony's cajun seasoning or crushed red pepper ...... but this could EASILY be a full meal by itself.

This is very good.  However, I agree with another reviewer in that the mushrooms need a bit of precooking.  I cut our shrimps in half after cooking but might cut them in 1/3rds next time before cooking - my shrimp were quite large.  I would also give the caps a sprinkle of salt and after filling them, I will also add a shake of crumbs and a shake of Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella .

I took some shortcuts and used pre-cooked shrimp but made garlic butter to pour over. I also sliced up some string cheese instead of grating mozzarella. They needed 20 minutes rather than 10-15, and the finished product wasn't anything special.

These were just OK.  I made per recipe, but thought that it lacked flavour.  Perhaps Pernod would kick this up.

This is an amazing appetizer.  I have made it as written, but have also used smaller mushrooms and shrimp to serve for large groups as finger food.  Both versions have been received with rave reviews.

Yum, I thought these were delicious! I did find them a bit hard to eat/bite through, so next time I make them I'll either use smaller shrimp or chop the shrimp. I also discovered that while I normally love portobello mushrooms, I didn't care for the taste of them in this recipe. I topped mine with colby-jack cheese, and thought the garlic butter shrimp was awesome. Cannot wait to have these again, thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

I finally made this after waiting a while. I cheated and used precooked shrimp just because thats what i had. I also found some HUGE mushrooms at the grocery store that cost a little more but made the shrimp fit better. I did cook the mushrooms for 10 minutes before stuffing them. This was DELISH and easy and so good. It was my dinner :)

Husband loved them and kept stealing kidlet's shrimpcargots. :) ***UPDATE*** Served as an appy for Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved them. I did add 1/2 with seasoning salt/paprika blend and the other half with Chef Paul's Magic Salmon Seasoning. The Salmon Seasong tasted the best.

I recently tried this recipe and LOVED it!!! I used more cheese and spiced it up a bit more with a sprinkle of tony's cajun spice. We served these as a side dish with steak and salad and it was a bit hit. We will definately be making them again and again! Thank you Ambi! A Winner for sure!!

If I could give this more stars, I would!  I made this for Valentine's day at hubby's request.  I had told him all about it and he thought it was time I got with it.  I cannot tell you how unbelievably simple and good this recipe is!  We adored it!  Hubby had the wonderful idea of draping a slice of bacon over the top (like it needs anything else, right?)...and it was even better!  Thank you, thank you, thank you, AMBI!!!!!!!!  My husband "hearts" you!!!

Delicious AND Simple - my two favorite requirements for a great recipe!  I didn't need as much margarine as the recipe called for, and I didn't have garlic cloves so I used garlic salt.  It was still PERFECT!

This was an outstanding appetizer to serve on New Years because it is elegant and it was very simple to make! I also chopped up the shrimp and mixed them with the mushroom stems.  I made these ahead of time and then put them in the over when my company arrived.  Excellent flavor and great presentation.  The chopped up mixture worked well since my mushrooms were a variety of sizes and I could use all of them. I will make this again and again.

These were good.  Like many reviewers I changed it a bit.  I sauteed the shrimp in galir butter, then out it in a processer with some of the stem, parm cheese, and green onion.  After processing I put into the caps and spooned the garlic butter on top and then topped with mozz cheese.  These are good looking too, they look like you spent a lot of time on them.  They tasted good but seem to be lacking a little something.  I'll make them again for sure.

Very easy and yummy appetizer. I chopped up the shrimp instead of serving it whole and instead of mozzeralla cheese I shredded fresh parmesan cheese, this was a big hit at my holiday party!

I am torn here.  I had really high expectations and thought that this recipe would make me like mushrooms.  However, I am the ONLY person at this party who wasn't completely taken by this recipe.  So, I have to give good reviews because it was a definite crowd-pleaser. I know now that I will never "learn to like it" (mushrooms, that is), as my Mom always told me!!

I agree with the others. This was a HUGE hit at a Christmas party I threw for 30 people. Simple to make, I added the breadcrumbs, some white wine, some celery salt, and a splash of lemon to the garlic butter. Be certain that if you are making these for a crowd you space the mushrooms before broiling as they are difficult to separate once they are melted together (especially when hot!) I worried that a few moments under the broiler would not cook the mushrooms enough, but I turned my broiler down to 450 and "broiled" for about 10 minutes. Perfect. Would DEFINITELY make again.

These were so good. I made them for an appetizer and everyone just went crazy. I used baby portabellas. These are going to be on my table for every party.

I sauteed my mushrooms for about 10 minutes first and I diced the shrimp.  I LOVED THESE!!!  Quick and easy snack or lunch.  Thanks Ambi

Absolutely the BEST!  Made this for a get together last night and they were gone in no time.  My only complaint is I did not make enough.  Makes a nice presentation.  Thanks for the recipe....

These are so good! I, too, used large portobella mushrooms and added 2 shrimp to each cap. I topped mine with a little panko crumbs to give it an extra inital crunch. Very tasty!

Great recipe, thanks ambibambi!  I made about 20-25 and they were gone in about 5 minutes between 3 people.  So good.
