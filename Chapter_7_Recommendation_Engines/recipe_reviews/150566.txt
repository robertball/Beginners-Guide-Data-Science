This was very tasty...light, rich and decadent. I tweaked the recipe by using Fat Free Condensed milk, using sugar-free chocolate pudding mix, and sugar-free Cool Whip in place of the whipping cream. It was perfect!

This works great as a basic mousse recipe. I've made it a couple of times using different flavored puddings. I think my favorite so far is using white chocolate pudding. This also makes a GREAT filling for cakes!

This was super easy and very yummy!  Use actual whipping cream (only takes a few minutes to whip) and not CoolWhip or it will be VERY sweet.  The whipped cream gave it a very nice mousse texture too.  A nice quick chocolate dessert!

I use this recipe quite often.  It is so easy and very good. As someone else suggested, I used all low fat ingredients, and my family loves it.  Also, I calculated the Weight Watchers points, and it is 1 point.  My favorite number.

The whole family loved this, and the teenager ate up all the leftovers quickly.  I tried to lighten it up a little by using fat free condensed milk & sugar free pudding mix.  You wouldn't even noticed the reduced calories, it was delicious!

This was extremely easy to make and turned out great.  It did have a pudding flavor to it, which made it more of a sweet tasting mousse than I am used to.  My husband thought it was a little too rich for him, my father thought it tasted too much like pudding, I thought it was great!

Absolutely delicious. Made it for my parent's anniversary dinner tonight, and it turned out perfectly. I tried it out on my boyfriend last night, and it was really good, but also pretty rich. I figured I'd like it a bit fluffier since it was following an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms and a main course of Linguine with clam sauce. What I did was, when I was making my 1 cup whipping cream, whipped, I made an extra 1/4 cup. It turned out just light enough to be the perfect addition to my meal.

Very quick and easy.  It is a little sweeter than I would expect a chocolate mousse to be, but I liked the extra sweetness.  I used it for a cake filling and it worked perfectly.

This was the BEST tasting mousse i've ever had and it was VERY easy... I used butterscotch instant pudding. I just poured the dry mixture into the bowl then continued with the rest of the directions. I also used 1 cup and a 1/2 of heavy whipping cream. I am topping this mousse with Extra Creamy Cool Whip. YUMMY! You would think butterscotch would be too sweet but with heavy whipping cream it tones down the sweetness and it taste like whipped creme brulee with a great a great custard like flavor. SO GOOD!!! I can't wait to try other instant pudding flavors :)

I used sugar free pudding and no matter how long I beat it it was lumpy.  Good answer to those who found this too sweet. Maybe my box was old?

I made a mistake by using whipped topping, which is already sweetened--This made the mousse sickeningly sweet.  So use real whipping cream that the recipe calls for, and I'm sure it'll be delicious.

This is so easy and very tasty. My only complaint is that it's so sweet. I made it for an office bday party and they all loved it though. Definitley a good quick dessert.

I made this last week and am planning on making it for the inlaws tonight!  I made sure to use real whipped cream (as suggested in other reviews) to prevent the mousse from being too sweet.  I used the leftover cream and made the Whipped Cream recipe from this site and used that and chocolate syrup to top the mousse....so good!

This is a good recipe because it is so quick and the result is delicious. As others have stated, use the whipped topping mix because using the already made whipped cream makes the mousse too sweet.

While this was easy and I just wanted something quick, I don't think I'll be making it again. It's not as smooth. It has more of a sickly sweetness to it as opposed to a smooth richness.

I was hoping to find a quick recipe for mousse, but this was disappointing.  It was too sweet and as another review mentioned, it had the consistency of pudding, not mousse.  I won't be making this again, unfortunately.

Wow!  We're lucky we were able to get some into the serving dishes, considering how much we ate right out of the bowl.  It's delicious!  And so easy, my kids were able to do most of it.
