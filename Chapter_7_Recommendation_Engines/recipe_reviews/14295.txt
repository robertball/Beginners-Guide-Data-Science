This is an awesome recipe.  Comments were made about the dressing being to thick.  My aunt gave me this same recipe but the dressing uses 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream and of course the parmesan cheese and sugar.  It makes a creamy dressing and is easier to spread and is soooo good.  My family just loves it.

I made this for a party recently and it was a big hit.  The only change I would make is to layer the dressing in the salad instead of just adding it to the top.

Rave reviews from everyone at the family reunion this weekend!  The full pound of bacon and the red onions really make the salad.  I also loved the addition of parmesan cheese to the mayo dressing--used the fancy shred, rather than the powdered canned stuff, and it worked out very well.  I also increased the mayo to 2 cups.  My dad, who'd never had this kind of salad before, asked if it was my own recipe, because, "this is a real award winner, if you ask me!"  Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

I was looking for new ways to get veggies into my husband.  He likes a lot of raw, but not cooked vegetables.  I made this recipe yesterday and my husband & I loved it!  Changes I would make next time:  *use 1 C mayo & 1 C sourcream instead of 1 1/4 C mayo
*add 3 chopped, boiled eggs *add a tablespoon of white vinegar to mayo & sourcream mixture *as a finishing touch, add extra crumbled bacon and shredded (not grated) parmesean cheese & 1/2 C of toasted, chopped pecans.  Changes I made yesterday: *I used 1/2 of a large, sweet onion instead of a red onion (it was too strong) *I used shredded Parmesean cheese to the mayo

This is an excellent recipe. Because the dressing is rather thick when first prepared, it should read "spread" the dressing instead of "drizzle" it over the salad. It thins after sitting and then being tossed with the vegetable mixture. This salad can be prepared and refrigerated 8-12 hours before serving. I substituted Swiss cheese instead of Cheddar, and added 3 chopped hard boiled eggs and 1 cup of chopped celery. I love recipes that can be made-up ahead of time!

My sister requested I make a seven layer salad for Easter this year.  I looked up some on-line and decided to try this recipe.  It was wonderful.  I made it last weekend to test and brought it to an Easter dinner this weekend.  I did change a few things.  Instead of just iceburg lettuce I mixed in a package of spring greens to make it more colorful.  I also used half mayonnaise and half miracle whip and added two tbsp milk to thin the dressing.  I made the salad the night before and tossed it to just prior to serving.  It still looked pretty and everyone got a good mixture of the salad.

This is a great salad. At first I thought the dressing was a bit too thick, but it wasn't once the salad was served. Actually, the thickness of the dressing served as a preservative, keeping the salad fresh for several days in the fridge. Yummy!!!

My sister in law always made layered salad, but I was never impressed.  The glob of mayo on top turned me off & it always felt like it needed mixed up to avoid a bite of one ingredient.  Then my friend came over for a cook out & I watched her mix up a salad, lettuce, mozzerella cheese, eggs bacon, peas & optional onions.  She then tossed it all with the mayo/sugar dressing.  OMG it was amazing.  I started making it this way & my inlaws & parents declared it their favorite salad & request at all get togethers.  Just throwing this out as an alternative to a great salad.  BTW mayo goes on right before serving & make sure lettuce is dry to avoid being runny.  I rinse lettuce the day before & dry in fridge with paper towels.

Delicious!  I used mushrooms instead of cauliflower and added chopped, hard boiled eggs.  I also added some ranch dressing to the mayonaise to jazz up the dressing.  I took it to a pot-luck and everyone raved.

This is really good! I brought it as my dish to pass at a family gathering and got big raves - they went back for thirds! I'm not a big red onion fan so I used green onions instead, I like the taste of freshness they give a salad. And to make it easier, I used the already cooked and crumbled bacon from the salad dressing aisle - goes together super fast that way! And I think next time I won't use as much parmesan in the dressing, it was a little chunky for me.

Absolutely wonderful.  Have passed this recipe on to others, by request!!  I always have to make a second batch of the mayonaise and sugar mixture, but other than that, it is a hit at our house!!

My husband's grandma makes this EVERY year as part of Christmas dinner. I took me awhile to get used to, because come on, it just sounds weird! Now I love the stuff!  I loosely followed the recipe, but did change a few things based on personal preference and the way his granny makes it. For the lettuce, I did a mix of romaine, butter/tango and spinach. Then the layer of diced red onions and water chestnuts. Then diced tomatoes, then frozen peas, then the cheese. For the dressing I mixed 1 cup of may with 1 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan, added the sugar and about 1 1/2 tbsp. of Uncle Dan's southern ranch dressing mix. Spread that over the top of everything and topped that layer with the chopped bacon, diced hard boiled eggs and a light smattering of sunflower seeds. Left out the cauliflower but will definitely try it next time. It was a hit and looked SO great in my big glass trifle!

I made this 7 layer salad yesterday for my sisters 42nd birthday, family get 2gether. It was off the chain!! I'm still getting calls about how great this salad was. My sisters boyfriend did the Seven Layer Salad dance & he doesn't even like cauliflower LOL!!!. I did take heed to some others comments & made a few changes of my own I used the spring mix salad ,a bag of shredded cheddar cheese mixed with other cheeses, 1 cup of mayo 1 cup of sour cream, about 1/2 a cup of ranch dressing & I also used a bag of the Italian fancy shredded parmesan cheese & doubled the dressing & spread it on top & everything else just as the recipe said & it was a HIT with my family & friends I will be making this one again 2 big thumbs up. ;-)

This has always been a big hit with my family.  I believe the order of layering matters.  I use a 9x13 glass dish and layer lettuce, tomato, green onion, celery, green pepper, sprinkle on chopped boiled egg, cheddar cheese, peas, mayo/sugar mixture spread over top, sprinkle with parmesan and then add crumbled bacon (I use the bacon pieces in pkg). I don't even mix it all up, as people dip it out, you really get a bit of everything because of it being in a shallow baking dish.  (I think I may sprinkle a bit of garlic salt over the top next time!) TASTY!

I also used a whole bottle of hidden valley ranch white cheddar dressing which I put half of in the middle of the salad and half on top. People loved this! Will make again!

LOVE this!  I didn't add the parm, I used the bacon pieces because I was in a time crunch and I added broc because I love it.  I could eat this every single day...maybe I will make some tonight!  Helpful hint:  I find it easiest to spread the dressing over the peas and then put the bacon and cheese on top.

I've made a version of this recipe for the last 25 years. It's an apsolute favorite with our families. Instead of cauliflower I use sliced hard boiled eggs and chopped tomatoes. I layer with lettuce, sliced thin red onion, peas, dressing, eggs, tomatoes, bacon and mixed mozzarella and cheddar cheese.

It has all the right incredients BUT it's important to have the correct layering AND you don't need sugar if you use Miracle Whip (instead of mayonaise).  It should be lettuce on the bottow, then peas, mayo (having the mayo in the middle helps mix it all together when you scoop it out), we use chopped carrot and celery instead of cauliflower sometimes, onion, cheddar cheese and bacon on top.

VERY GOOD!  I have made this recipe MANY times and it's always a hit.  The only thing I recommend is that you make the dressing the night before, that way all the flavors of the mayo, cheese and sugar combine really well. Other than that, perfect!

I think you all might be missing the point about this salad.  Mixing the dressing in defeats the purpose - that being that this is a long lasting salad.  We once had one last - shockingly, because the entire family loves it - for 6 days.  Try having a tossed salad last that long.  Once it is dressed, you have 4 hours, tops.  (And that's stretching it.)  We have been making this salad for over 30 years, and often have it at Christmas and Thanksgiving.  The only difference in the recipe that we use  and this one is we use green onions instead of red, we make it in a 13x9 glass pan and leave out the parmesan.  And you must make sure the greens (we use Romaine, subtle difference) is bone dry and so are the peas.  Moisture in the bottom of the pan definitely shortens it's life.    Please don't mix everything in and miss the best plus of making this.  How hard is it for each person to give the items a little stir on the plate with a fork?  Bon appetit!

Made this Christmas day with Lasagna, and everyone loved it.  Added crumbled bacon bits on the side and sent this recipe over the top.  Will be making this again, and again.
June 2012: For those that say the dressing is too thick, it really is recommended to be a heavy dressing. I added some sour cream to lighten it a little bit. I love this recipe and am making it again this weekend for an outdoor wedding.  HINT make the night before you serve. Gives the dressing time to set up.

Traditional family dishes give you an opportunity to share wonderful family stories associated with the foods.  For Seven Layer Salad, I'll just say that the instructions should include the phrase "Toss before serving."  One time my sister-in-law prepared this in advance so that my brother would serve it to the family gathering (she was going to be arrive late).  Well, my brother served the children a "spoonful" such than one got the bacon, one cheese, one lettuce, and my son (who will never forget it) got only mayo!!  This story is ALWAYS retold when the salad appears and we laugh again and again. 

Regarding the recipe, I agree that 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream tastes better.... but be sure to toss the salad!!

I used to make a very similiar salad years ago.  I used romaine instead of ice-berg.  I would use a glass salad bowl and stand the romaine from the bottom to the top, with the top of the romaine going slightly over the edge.  Then, the cheddar cheese would be the last ingredient.  This way, it ended up looking like a flower!  The pedals are the green romaine and the flower center is the cheddar cheese--very nice presentation.

Wonderful Recipe!! I made it to serve for guests and it was a hit! Every one was asking me what I used for the dressing. I was so afraid if it would be a good one or not. But this is definitly a keeper.  Alterations: I used  cup mayonaise +  cup of sour cream + the sugar and the parmesan like the recipe says.  How I did the Layors: lettuce, red onios, cauliflower, peas, dressing, cheese, then the bacon.  I assembled the salad a DAY AHEAD. The bacon, I did it on the microwave, broke them and putted in a ziploc bag and putted in the refrigerator. I putted over the salad just before serving, to keep it crunch.

I've made this salad a few times.  Just made it again last night to bring in to work today.  Would have given it 5 stars but as always I like shortcuts in the kitchen so I modify mine a little.  This made a HUGE 9x13 dish.  ****It is very important that you let this sit overnight in the fridge and layer in the following order as listed below.****
I used the following ingredients....
1 head of lettuce (chopped), 1 package of frozen peas (thawed), 1 can of water chesnuts (chopped), 1 bunch of green onion (green portion only - chopped), 2 cups fat free mayo, 1/4 c sugar (mix mayo and sugar together and spread over green layers), 3/4 - 1 cup chopped nuts (i used a small bag of dessert nut topping), 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese, and 1 package of real bacon pieces (you can find in the salad dressing isle). Time at work so far - 1.5 hours.  Half the dish is gone already.  :D

Made this salad for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. I took another reviewer's suggestion and made the dressing with 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream to make the dressing lighter and smoother. Also added the dressing layer in the middle of the salad rather than on top. Will make again-wonderful salad!!

Very good! I took it to a party and it was a hit.  I added sour cream to the dressing to cut the heaviness of the mayo.  Next time I'm going to split the ingredients in half and do two sets of layers.  Everyone was scraping from the top and only getting "the good stuff", so I was left with lots of lettuce and some peas.

I always rate based on the recipe as originally posted.  Only seems fair to me. Making this ahead of time actually REQUIRES the dressing to be spread on top so it acts as an airtight seal, keeping everything layered below crisp and fresh. Serve it from the bottom up & each serving gets something of everything. It's rich & crisp and leftovers are actually excellent, even thought it's a lettuce salad. It's amazing. Thanks for posting, Leah Mae.

Made this for Easter.  It was delicious!  I will make changes next time though.  I will use Hellmans as someone suggested.  All I had was Kraft and I think that will make a big difference.  Also, I didn't get lucky on the red onion.  It was sour and bitter.  So, I think next time I'll add green onions instead.   I will also do a layer of baby spinach.   Oh, I added chopped eggs and will do again.  I also took the advice of others and used 3/4 c mayo and 3/4 cup sour cream and will do this again.   The recipe is excellent as is, but these are just my personal preferences.

This was great at today's holiday party.  I read some of the other reviews and did substitute the mayo for 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream and the sugar. I also subsitituted the red onion for green onion, and added 3 boiled eggs and carrots.

An excellent salad.  I've been making this for many years with many variations.  My favorite is to add chopped hard-cooked eggs and baby spinach, and refrigerate overnight.  Green onions are also a good substitute for red onion.  Garnish with chopped pimento and fresh chopped parsley for a pretty Christmas salad.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe. I think I have made it 5-6 times since the Christmas season for various gatherings and the container is always almost scraped clean! I prefer making this in a 9x13 so that the dressing is more equally distributed. Sometimes I only put dressing over half and put out another type of dressing for the other half.

I used another reviewer's suggestion of thinning the dressing. I mixed 2/3 cup of Greek plain yogurt with 2/3 cup of mayo, 1 tb. of white sugar and 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese. It came out so tasty I started eating a few spoonfuls before adding to the salad! I spooned out the dressing in the center of the salad and barely had to spread it to the sides. I then refrigerated and let the dressing slowly percolate through the top layers. This is the second time I made this and definitely plan on a third.

Very good!  I forgot the parm cheese in the dressing, but it didn't matter.
I didn't have some of the salad ingred., so I changed it up some.  Layer of iceburg, red onion, peas, red pepper, bacon, and chopped boiled eggs.  I have now made this 3 times and every place I have taken it has RAVED about how good it is!

The salad tastes great and is easy to assemble. The parmesan in the dressing made it a little to thick for my tastes. Next time I'll try it with a little more mayo and little less parmesan. This filled a heaping 9" x 13" pan.

I love this salad. I use 1 c mayo/ 1 c LF sour cream and sometimes a little nf greek yogurt.  I am not a huge fan of cauliflower and hate peas but they are a must in this salad. The peas and cauliflower add a crunch. This is a "cannot stop eating" salad. I make it for bible study every time our group serves and it is ALWAYS gone. For those who are "fat" conscious there are ways to cut the fat. Turkey bacon, lite/nf sour cream or light mayo (although I made it 1 time w lite mayo and did not like the dressing)lite cheese/nf cheese...but if you make these changes and don't like the salad do not low rate it!!!

I have been making this salad for years and while I usually do the same ingredients every time, sometimes I change it up a bit. It really doesn't matter, the key to me is that the "dressing" be simple, just mayo with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. For somne reason, most people think the dressing is more involved than it actually is.  One thing I have done is made a "Southwestern" version layering ingredients like romain lettuce, black beans, corn, tomatoes, purple onion, sliced black olives and shredded Mexican Blend cheese.  Then I top it off with mayo mixed with salsa (be careful to not make it too runny. A good substitute version for certain occasions.

Huge hit with EVERYONE at BBQ of 15. TIP: Next time I think I'll try adding another thin layer of dressing on top of the lettuce(as the poor guests at the back of the line were asking if I had more dressing since all the stuff kinda falls to the bottom [minus dressing] as more & more heplings are taken .  Either way, it was awesome! Thanks!

This was a really good version of the basic seven layer salad.  I received compliments on it from family members that have been making it for years.  Be sure to use Hellman's Real (full fat) mayonnaise.  It does make a difference! I also add slice of hard-boiled eggs.

This is such a good salad. I leave out the peas and replace with broccoli since we're not a *pea* kinda family. I also add several tsp. of lemon juice and white vinegar to the dressing mix. In my opinion, if you make the dressing early in the day and let it chill all day, it's WAY better! Thanks, Leah Mae, for a great recipe! :o)

Yummy! However, I'm slower than most; it took me closer to 25 minutes to prep. I also added broccoli and corn. Took it to a potluck; it turned out beautifully.

Great salad, good for large groups. The narrow bowl ued to show off this salad is great. It keeps the salad from having too much mayo/sour cream mix over the salad. I have found that frozen peas as the top layer make a great base for spreading the dressing. Other things are either too lumpy or not stable enough for good "spreading" consistency. We'll have this at Thanksgiving.... again!

We've made this salad for many years, but without the peas - not needed at all!  We layer the lettuce at the bottom, then add chopped onions, then add the chopped cauliflower. Next, "frost" the cauliflower with the mayo (no need to really measure) like you would a cake. Sprinkle sugar on top of that.  Then add  bacon bits and parmesan cheese.    You don't need to really measure anything at all for this salad.  One head of lettuce (or we add abt 2 lbs of bagged chopped salad mix), one head of cauliflower, and the rest is just a layer done by hand.  It is so easy. We call it OVERNIGHT SALAD, because you need to let it sit overnight. The sugar and mayo break down the cauliflower to make it soft.  You need to stir it before serving to get that goodness mixed throughout. The liquid does "pool" a little bit and is both normal and what you want. Just stir.  We never have any leftovers of this one.   I know this isn't "my" exact recipe, but the cheddar cheese and peas are not only overkill, but if anyone else noticed, makes it NINE layer salad, not 7.   Still, a great salad all year round, but we make it a couple times a month in the summer.

I make this AS IS!  Do not change a thing- it is so perfect as written.  I love this recipe compared to others due to one layer- the cauliflower.  I chop it real small- and everyone goes nuts over it.  ("What's that one layer- it's so good?") The dressing is so tasty- I admit to one minor change after making it numerous times- a little milk in the dressing to thin it out- so it's a tad creamier rather than frosting like-but it doesnt alter the taste.

For years, I've seen these "layered" salad recipes.  Why did I wait until the age of 45, to prepare one?  Maybe I was waiting for the "right" recipe.  The hint of sweetness in the dressing, coupled with me using Regiano parmesan, made this salad exceptional. It's rave-able, and will be a mainstay, in my repetoire.  Much thanks to you, Leah Mae for sharing.
Warmly,
Jeff

Very good. One of my husband's favorites. I used green onion and yellow pepper in place of the red onion and cauliflower. I added 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip as I like the twang it adds.

This is a hit!   I love that I can make it the day before, so it is great to take to an event or add to a complicated menu, because it's already done!  I found the onions a bit overpowering, so personally I will do less next time.   Otherwise, it was great as-is!

Haven't ever made this, but your sauce made me remember my chicken pasta salad  recipe that I lost.  I just added a little milk to thin and fresh ground pepper to it as well.  So I'm glad I read this recipe and have now printed it off, so I don't lose my chicken pasta salad sauce again.  My recipe boil chicken breasts and chop, 1 red onion finely chopped, frozen peas, chopped red and green bell pepper, pasta your choice and this sauce but with milk added to thin with a little salt and fresh ground black pepper.  Great on a bed of iceberg lettuce with roma tomato wedges on the side or use to stuff an avocado.  Sometimes I would add a little fresh lemon juice to kick it up a notch with a little more parmesan or romano or asiago cheese mix.  Thank you!

I make this all the time. Suggest that you "layer" each ingredient a couple times, even three times if your dish is deep enough. Looks prettier and mixes everything better. I use ranch dressing & mayo evenly. I play with all the different ranch flavors on the market. I've used a variety of lettuce types: romaine, red & green leaf... adds a dimension to the colors. I haven't tried the cauliflower, used boiled eggs instead. But will try that. Great summer dish to take to parties!

This salad was a definite hit.  I used the 1 c. mayonnaise, 1 c. sour cream with parmesan cheese and sugar and it made it a perfect topping.

I'll admit, when I was assigned a Seven Layer Salad for Christmas dinner with the family, I thought it seemed a bit strange - it tasted great!  Made it early in the morning to be served that night. I did change the dressing a bit - 3/4 c sour cream, 3/4 c mayo and 3/4 miracle whip. I also added spinach to the iceberg lettuce, omitted the cauliflower and added a layer with sliced hard-boiled eggs.  Delicious, and looked really beautiful in the trifle dish!  Thank you!

This has got to be one of the BEST Seven Layer Salad recipes I've ever found.  I'm always being asked for the recipe, and always asked to make when going to outings.   The one thing I like to do before serving is toss all together.  YUMMY!!

This is probably my favorite salad in the world.  We make it all the time.  The veggie combo is pretty flexible, I have added tomato, radishes, and green onions and sliced hard boiled eggs (which are really good in this) before and had never tried the cauliflower in it before.  Yum yum yum!

This salad was very tasty! My husband was wowed by it and thought it was much better than other salads that we have previously given 5 stars to.  I reduced the amount of peas to 2/3 C. since we are low carbing and used 2 packets of splenda instead of the sugar.  To give the dressing a 'kick' we added a splash of red wine vinegar and it was fantastic! A definite keeper!

I tried this recipe for Thankgiving Dinner and was somewhat disappointed.  It tasted okay, but the texture of the dressing was terrible.  I made it the day before in order to cut down on the preparation work on Thanksgiving day.  I substituted broccoli for the peas since my family doesn't care for peas.  I also used a mixture of romaine and leaf lettuce.  I layered the salad just as the recipe says and then I mixed the dressing ( thinning it with buttermilk) and put it on top.  The next day when  I went to toss the salad for dinner, the dressing, bacon, cheese and the veggies all stuck together in big clumps.

A few days later, I tried again.  This time I thinned the dressing with milk and did not add it until I was ready to serve.  It tasted much better.  

I would also suggest adding a little garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper to the dressing.

I used a glass trifle bowl to present this salad.  It looks wonderful!  It tastes just as wonderful!  I vary the lettuces that I use.  The greener leaves look so elegant.  I buy the pre-chopped lettuce (saves time) and I thin the dressing with milk. I'm always proud to serve this salad.

As written with the addition of sour cream (found in other reviews) to make the dressing more spreadable, I give the recipe a 5. A friend brought it to a BBQ I had and not a single person failed to ask about this salad. I made it a week later and received the same reaction. For my family, I did add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and fresh ground pepper to the dressing, as we really like it's tanginess. Also, instead of dolloping the dressing and trying to spread it, I put it in a sandwich bag, cut the tip off the end, and drizzled lines of dressing evenly on the salad. Very forgiving recipe. Add what you like and take away what you don't. Yummy!

I have had this salad a lot! I have always had it with sliced hard boiled eggs and not cauliflower. Gonna try the cauliflower version this weekend but always use 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayo for dressing as a previous reviewer suggested.

We love this salad!  I added  red cabbage to the lettuce, added colour.  For the dressing I use 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayonaise, 1tsp prepared mustard & garlic powder.  Friends & family love it, requesting it often for get togethers.

I followed the recipe without any changes and its really good. Next time I think I will add dsg then top with the cheddar cheese because of appearance of it. Its appearance just wasnt as appealing  to me with the salad dressing on top.

This salad is soooo good.  It looks beautiful and the recipe is so flexible....just add what you like and omit what you don't.  My salad ended up with 9 layers and was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make again.  Drawbacks:  It makes a ton of salad, and it is not good left over.  It gets too soggy to eat later.  So, adjust amout of salad or invite a few more people over to help eat it, but definitely try it.....so, so good!

Great recipe...however, a few changes...

1. Grate your own cheddar cheese. 
2. Added sour cream to the dressing with a splash of milk and vinegar to make the dressing less "mayonaisey". 
3. Half a head of iceburg lettuce.  
4. Used 16 oz. of thawed petite peas. 
5. I used half of a red onion since they can be somewhat pungent for those who normally don't like onions. 
6. Used only one tablespoon of sugar.

Very good, only difference for me is we do green peppers instead of the cauliflower and leave out the sugar. Not usually picky about mayo but after using a couple of different ones, Hellmans seems to add the best flavor.

I tried this with the mayo but my family did not care for it. My husband's grandmother told me I was supposed to use Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the mayo. I hope this change will work for me the next time.

Although my husband said he didnt really care for, I thought it was wonderful. I used another viewers advise and went half and half with mayo and mircle whip. Its flavor was excellent. It was nice on this hot summer day. My 11 year old ate 4 bowls.. I will make this for summer time get togethers.. Excellent!

This salad was great. We don't like overly sweet dressings, so I cut the sugar drastically and added a little garlic salt.  It also saved well and didn't get soggy.

Yum. I used 9x13 and just layered. I didnt use cauliflower but used celery and added eggs which i think is a must in seven layer salad. Very good next time i would layer the dressing throughout the layers instead of just on top. But with my changes I would rate it a 10!!!

Very easy recipe and you don't have to be exact on the ingredients. I put this in a 9x13 glass dish and just adapt to the amounts I want. My hubby absolutely loves this! I think he ate the majority of the last dish!

I added layers of hardboiled egg and diced tomato, and excluded the cauliflower & red onion. This is a very versatile recipe because you can tailor the veggies to your taste. This is a really old-school type of salad that you don't see around much but boy is it tasty! Everyone really enjoyed it when I made it for father's day.

Very yummy!  I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and used 3/4 a head of lettuce.  I made it up the night before and let it sit in the fridge until the next night - still tasted fresh.  I tossed just before serving to make sure the dressing was spread evenly.  My husband, who isn't the biggest salad fan, told his dad, "If you want a good salad, try this."  That's all I needed to hear to add this to my recipe box.  This recipe will feed a crowd.  I had well over 12 and only used half the dish.  We did have a lot of other sides, though.  I'm going to try adding grilled chicken to the leftovers and make a meal... yum!

I gave it a medium review because I never made this before, had no bacon, and no one ate it besides me. I guess bacon is what makes this salad good.

BIG hints!
*Make sure you put it together the night before with the peas frozen still
*Busy cook? It is much faster and easier to use pre-done bacon bits, pre-grated cheese and even preshredded lettuce and veggies of your choice! Red bell peppers are very pretty!
This salad is a big winner. My Aunt Julie started making this 20 years ago. We have never used the onions, cauliflower, parm cheese or water chesnuts, but it is a very versatile recipe. It is a tradition in our family!
We do it in an english Trifle bowl and it is so pretty!

Very good and just the traditional recipe I was looking for.  I have made this for Easters a few times and it is always a hit.  Just make sure to defrost peas or they make the whole thing runny.

I made this salad for the small group we meet with weekly and they all loved it.  I doubled the recipe and all of it was gone.  I used pre-cooked bacon and green onions instead of red.

I can make this salad and eat it for a day or two afterward - it's so yummy!  I usually make it with fake bacon (morning star) and use green beans and broccoli instead of peas and cauliflower (my husband doesn't like peas and cauliflower).  This is a hit with everyone I've served.

Have made this salad alot since I came across the recipe. My family loves it. And it makes a great summer salad. If I need to take it to a large gathering I put it in my glass punch bowl. All the layers show. The top of my bowl widens out so I double the dressing so I have enough to spread over the top. Thanks Leah!

Loved the salad itself, but no one was too crazy about the dressing- I think it was a bit heavy on the parmesan. Also very thick- I liked it better when I thinned it with milk.

This recipe was wonderful! Thank you!! I was looking for a salad I could bring to a dinner party, this one was perfect, and people were even having seconds. I ignored the measurements and simply made sure there was ample amount of each ingredient to make a layer to suit the bowl I used, it worked out well.

I love this wonderful salad, and have made it many times. One reviewer suggested putting the dressing at different layers, if you do this iyou will have to much dresing.My recipe calls also for chopped ham, or turkey that you layer after the lettuce peas, onino etc: then another small layer of lettuce and then the ham or turkey. I top mine by spreading the dressing on top and then sprinkle shredded mild chedder cheese. and it looks really  pretty. this salad with some crusty bread makes a wonderful lunch, or as a side to a full meal.The bacon gives such a wonderful flavor.

We've had this same recipe in my family for years, but without the peas or cheddar cheese. Also, for the dressing we use 1 cup of mayo, 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. Definitely a glass bowl is a must to see the layers. Lettuce, cauliflower, bacon, repeat and put dressing on just before serving and toss to coat.  YUMMY!!!!

I wanted a 7 layer salad recipe, so I chose this one for my base and made changes.  I use pre-cooked bacon pieces (1 pkg), and substitute diced salad cucumbers for the cauliflower as a personal preference.  My biggest change is the dressing, as I tried the one with the recipe and just didn't like it.  I use fat-free sour cream and 1 pkg of ranch dressing mix instead.  Many people have told me they like it much better than the mayo dressing.

I read the reviews of some others and decided to add some packaged dry dressing mix to the mayo.  I'm glad I did or it would have been a little bland.  I also added some sunflower seeds and dried cranberries.

It was a big hit at our dinner table. My boyfriend loved it. I altered with substituting the cauliflower with broccoli and added chopped green peppers.

Took this to an office party and it was a huge hit.  It was completely gone long before the party was over.  I will have to double it for next year.

We made this salad for Christmas.  I used celery instead of the cauliflower.  I also used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream instead of the 1-1/4 cups mayo.  Excellent recipe.

I have made this recipe many times with lots of praise from everyone, I only substitute water chestnuts for the cauliflower. After I layer the peas I layer 2 cans of drained sliced water chestnuts then top with the mayo, cheese and bacon. It is delicious, and I didnt think I would like the mayo on my salad but the flavor combination works great together!

I made this for a reunion, and it was almost gone at the end.  I would say this was good, but you HAVE to love mayo b/c it is very strong in the recipe.

I brought this salad to a family gathering. It was a hit. I did change the red onions with green onions and the cauliflower with chopped tomatoes. I looked every appealing in a glass bowl. Everyone loved it. I will be making this salad again and again

Wow, this was great, and looked beautiful on the table too!. My family isn't fond of cauliflower so I chopped it very small and they never seemed to notice it was there. I did mix in sour cream with the mayo to thin it a bit. I will certainly make this again!

I love when people make this salad for potlucks, but I made a few minor alterations to save calories.  I cut the shredded cheddar in half and omitted the Parmesan.  I also substituted Light Miracle Whip in place of the mayo and sugar.  I realize that my alterations did make it a "different" salad, but I know that the original version is great, and my low fat version isn't half bad, either.

This is one of my husband's favorite salads.  I made it tonight and it was fantastic.  I added cucumber, eggs, carrots, bacon bits, and green onion (no red onion or cauliflower).  This is a salad that gets better every day that it sits.  One difference from most pictures or ways that I've seen this presented, is to layer it in a 9X13 casserole dish instead of a tall dish.  This lets the dressing really be a part of the salad, rather than on the very top.  Much easier to serve, too.  Enjoy!

I have made this salad for two potlucks this summer. I took a shortcut & used bagged iceberg lettuce salad (includes carrot and red cabbage) rather than clean and shred a head of lettuce. No other changes are necessary as this is great just as written. Try using a clean plastic bowl with snap on lid to make it easy for carry-ins. Love it!

I love it because I can make it the day before!  The dressing top serves as a seal and then when covered in the frig everything stays fresh.  I brought this to a function at the school I work at and everyone loved it.  I make it a 10 layer - note: salt and pepper between layers lightly - 1. lettuce, 2. peas, 3. green onion, 4. bacon (at least 1 lb or more) 5. mushrooms, 6. shredded cheddar, 7.  green/yellow/red pepper diced medley, 8. chopped celery 9. hard boiled eggs, sliced  10. dressing: mix mayo w/parmesan, sugar, and 1 tbs of juice from a jar of sweet pickles.

I have made this salad over and over the past few months for family reunions, church functions, and family get togethers. Everyone loves it! I mix 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream for the dressing and a little extra on the bacon, otherwise it great just like it is!!

Yum! I used fat free mayo and splenda (trying to watch those calories) and grilled chicken breast instead of bacon. I also added a little spinach dip seasoning and lemon to the dressing, it gave it an extra zing!

this was good. it went over well for thanksgiving.  the only thing i would recommend is to be sparing with the red onion. i used an entire smallish onion and it really overpowered the salad. i would make this again, but i would cut down the amount of red onion.

THIS RECIPE IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, A REAL CROWD PLEASER!  THE ONLY ALTERATION I MADE WAS THAT INSTEAD OF MAKING THE DRESSING, I CHEATED (TIME CONSTRAINTS)AND USED MARZETTI'S COLE SLAW DRESSING. I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN.

Very nice salad. I love tomatoes and this recipe didn't call for any so I added some being sure to remove seedy centers first. Delicious. The dressing didn't come out the way I expected but it seemed like it would've been good.

Loved the taste of this salad! We used about half the onions (we're not big onion fans) and ranch dressing instead. Tried the mayo mixture and must have done something wrong, as it just didn't taste good. Great salad for a potluck! Next time I am going to add the mushrooms like another reviewer suggested - yummy!

I just found this recipe and it sounds very much like one I tried at a function which was delicious!  I just do not recall bacon in it, but why not- I love bacon!  The other recipe I think also had a layer of celery, but I look forward to trying it as it is otherwise very similar!  Lisa

Great! I used half mayo and sour cream and added a splash of cider vinegar to the dressing. I subbed garbanzos for the peas and hard boiled egg for the cauliflower. I really liked the parm cheese in the dressing. I sprinkled salt and pepper in the salad layers. Next time I will add salt and pepper to dressing as well. Served with mini ham and cheese rolls.

Delicious! Even my kids, who don't eat the individual ingredients, loved them combined together. I added ranch dip mix which elevated the flavor palate even higher.

Made for a potluck for 10 people.  Read reviews and only made slight changes based on recommendations to the dressing (3/4 c. light mayo, 3/4-1 c. of 5% sour cream, and 1/3 c. of ranch dressing.  Kept the parmesan cheese and sugar in the recipe - though used maybe 1 tbsp. of sugar).  Used a prewashed bag of iceberg lettuce (with other veggies in it).  Layered 1/2 of dressing on bottom of bowl, then salad, then onion, bacon, shredded cheese, and peas(didn't use cauliflower).  Put another layer of dressing on, followed by salad and lighter amounts of onion, bacon, peas and cheese on top.  Because this was a salad that was going to be eaten by different staff over the course of two breaks and refrigerated in between the breaks, I decided to put dressing on the bottom of the bowl, hoping that there would be enough dressing left on the salad for those coming in for it second break.  Thanks for the recipe--they devoured it!

My husband is not a big seven-layer salad fan, but as soon as he tasted this he commented immediately about how good it was.  He raved and raved...and so did several others when I brought this to them as part of a meal.  They asked for the recipe!  This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for our 4th of July BBQ and I was surprised how many people had never tried it before! It was a picnic/potluck staple for me growing up. First, I would tell everyone to plan on it taking more than 15 minutes to make! It takes time for everything to cool. It's also very important to let your lettuce dry on a towel for a good 15 - 20 minutes. We added extra onion, used less mayo (don't use reduced fat, you'll be sorry), about 2 cups of cauliflower, and probably about half the bacon (because we ate it before it made it into the salad!). Great salad.

My mom made 7-layer as a child, but I always stuck my nose up to things without trying them.  I LOVE this salad!  My husband found the recipe and used it for work.  It was my special request for Mother's Day.

My mother in law made a salad so good that i had to look it up. It was just like this one cept instead of califlower she used chopped celery. So I substite the califlower with celery and added some raisins as well. Tasted even better than my Moms! Ive made this 3 times now and tempted to make it again just writing this review!

I was searching for the 7 layer salad from the past but wanted a new spin to it too when I ran across this one.  I added zest by adding bleu cheese crumbles along with the shredded cheese.  I also added broccoli chopped in small pieces along with the cauiflower and thinly sliced radishes.  I also added granulated garlic along with mayonnaise dressing.  My husband said it was the most perfect salad he has ever had. I will also add some chopped red pepper and boiled eggs sliced thinly the next time.  It makes a very pretty salad to serve as well.

You need to know that after a night in the frig this salad compresses quite a bit and looks NOTHING like the picture!! I panicked initially but after I tasted it, all was good. This salad lends it self to using various ingredients but do not expect the end product to look like the picture!!!  I took the advice of previous suggestions and made the dressing with 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of light sour cream. That was a good choice. The next time I will use perhaps 3/4 cup of each as it was a bit too much dressing for me. A bit too soggy for my taste.  I added the parmesan and sugar as well. The dressing seemed a bit plain so I added a good bit of ground pepper. I'm wondering what other herbs might be nice in this dressing.  As far as ingredients I choose to use a combo of some fresh salad greens from the farmers market with chopped romaine, a layer of sunflower shoots (again from the farmers marked) the chopped red onions, defrosted peas (a good addition), the cheese,  some thinly sliced cucumbers, some orange and purple cauliflower (the colors make the salad pop), the bacon (a must) then the dressing. Whatever you have on hand use it. This is a yummy salad. Got lots of complements. I will try again using less dressing and "kicking it up" with more herbs. Great for a make the day ahead potluck!!

This is my favorite salad. The only difference is that I always use sliced hardboiled eggs and chopped tomatoes (or halved cherry tomatoes) instead of the chopped cauliflower. Everyone loves it!

This was a good recipe. The dressing was thick and I think I would add broccoli instead of cauliflower next time so there was more flavor. The veggie combo was bland.

Great Salad, when I make it I add 1 cup chopped celery, 6 chopped, hard-boiled eggs, plus I add a scant tsp of garlic powder to dressing.  When my vegetarian niece is dining with us I use Baco's instead of bacon, still tastes great.

This was ok.  The blend of flavors was good.  I omitted the "dressing" because it did not emulsify when mixed.  It was fine leaving it off (as it was too fattening anyway) and everyone could choose their own dressing to top it with.

I used lite mayo,  Splenda instead of sugar and added 1 1/2 Tbls of Cider Vinegar to thin the dressing out a little bit. I also added a few layers, I used carrots and broccoli and next time will put the onions on the side and let those who like them add them to thier own plate. Two of the four sitting around my dinner table are very picky eaters and they both ate two helpings of this salad.

This is so cute.  I took this idea & just ran with it.  I used lettuce, broccoli, mushrooms, hard boiled egg slices, tomatoes, chicken slices, dried cranberries.  Then I allowed my guests to add sliverd almonds, shredded cheese & their own dressing.  I didn't want to ruin the leftovers with the cheese & dressing.  Thanks for this cute idea!

This is one of the best versions of this recipe I have ever seen I think I will use green onions,a layer of tomatoes and black olives also.   I really like the addition of cauliflower.   Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  ACE

This tastes even better than it looks!  I left out the onion and instead, put onion powder in the dressing, as well as a splash of balsamic vinegar. I think tomatoes are essential in it and used avocado and mushroom and sliced eggs also.  Use anything you like in salad or think looks colorful. And the best addition I think was raisins on top of the dressing!  But those are the things I like in salad.

Have eaten this salad for years, but never made it myself. This recipe is good. The dressing is a little too thick to easily spread. I put the dressing in a baggie & cut off the corner and piped it on then spread it so my top layer didn't get all mixed in the dressing. Just for the sake of looks I guess! I used tomato instead of the cauliflower and green onion instead of regular. I also used light mayo to attempt to make it a bit healthier! A tasty salad anytime!

Delicious, and beautiful too. 1 cup each mayo, sour cream, and parm with 2 tablespoons sugar still tastes good, and provides ample and spreadable dressing. Also, added layers of baby spinach, red pepper, shredded carrots, and broc - very pretty color. Clear bowl a must. For those who hate frying bacon in pan like I do... place bacon, in single layer, on lipped cookie pan on top of parchment paper, and bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes or so until desired texture/doneness; cool and crumble for recipe.

I am always asked to make this recipe for family gatherings! The dressing, though simple, is really very delicious! The sugar added to it takes that "Mayonnaise" taste out of the dressing, so it doesn't taste like you are just eating vegetables with Mayo on them! Thanks for this great recipe! I don't like peas, and wanted to add broccoli, diced tomatoes, green and red peppers, so mine ends up being more like a 9-layer salad! The only thing you should never vary with this recipe is the dressing! It really makes the salad! It is mild and delicious!(Oh, I use Lite Mayo, and Turkey Bacon to make it a little more healthy!)

I made this for a friend's birthday party and let me tell you, it was a hit to the max! I layered chopped iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes and cukes, peas, crumbled bacon, sliced hard boiled eggs and sharp cheddar cheese. I doubled the dressing recipe, added about 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 c. parmesean and 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika to the mayo mixture. There were no leftovers and everyone wanted the recipe! I had extra dressing which I served on the side. My recommendation is to just make it ahead and serve the salad chilled...I made it about an hour before the party and it was a little warm, but still everyone gobbled it up. The smoked paprika in the dressing really added a nice flavor to the already tasty dressing. Also, I thinned the dressing with milk because I thought it was a little gloopy and I wanted to really drizzle the dressing. I will also add chopped green onions next time. Very tasty and super easy! Try this recipe with any of your favorite veggies...it's so foolproof! You won't be disappointed.

For Christmas use diced red and green peppers on one layer.  You could really use just about any veggies in this one - celery slices, shredded carrots, diced cucumbers, broccoli, black olives...

This is a favorite in our family.  I "thin" the mayo (1/2 mayo, 1/2 Miracle Whip) with milk as it's a bit thick if the recipe is followed. I also use an iceberg mix with darker greens for better nutritional value as others have stated. Fresh shredded parmesan really stands out in the dressing.  Wonderful !

This is a very nice, versatile salad.  I wasn't sure about the dressing.  But I added sour cream and a pinch of curry - just a very small pinch and it was quite tasty and not too sweet.

Thank you!  M~

I just love this salad.  I've had many other salads like it that end up too sweet.  I think this one is perfect.  However, I always omit the peas and increase some of the other ingredients.  It's pretty easy to just throw in whatever veggies you like.

This was good. the best parts were the bacon, peas and dressing-but I love green peas. For the dressing not to be too thick, I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup regular mayo, added the parm and sugar and let it sit out an hour before ladling over individual servings. This worked better than topping the entire dish as people could portion out the dressing (there is plenty trust me) and allowed it too loosen up.

Fabulous!! I did alter a bit by using Smart Balance instead of mayo and I sliced the red onion thinly rather than chopped as some do not care for red onion in my family. There was absolutely no difference in taste with the maSmart Balance and half the calories. I also use bagged Hearts of Romaine instead of iceberg which was more flavorful. All of my guests raved!!

Awesome recipe. Although I made some changes. I substituted bacon with sliverd almonds, and sugar with dried cranberries. I thinned my dressing by adding Ranch. It was gone in a flash.
I'll make this again. And Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I think the dressing for this salad is what makes it so good! I followed a viewers suggestion and added a bit of vinegar (to thin it out) and cut back on the amount of parmesan cheese. I substituted broccoli in place of the cauliflower. Be sure to make this is a clear glass pan or bowl to show off all the colorful veggies! We'll definetly be making this again.  Thanks, Leah!

This salad is a wonderful stand-by for summer birthdays, barbeques and all of the different get togethers!  It is one of my husbands favorites and he requests it often during this time of the year!  I usually make it the day ahead so there is time for the flavors to blend.

I absolutely love this recipe and so does not family.  I agree with another poster, that apparently a number of you have missed the concept, with all the stirring and thinning of the dressing.  The thick dressing keeps everything crisp.  With what little bit of salad I may have remaining for later, none of it has been soggy because of the dressing.  

If you make a lot of changes before trying the original recipe, it seems kind of odd, that one would then complain that they recipe was not good.  Give it a try exactly as it is and then see.    Oh yeah, and save the stirring for what is on your plate.   Enjoy.

I make a slightly different version, using chopped bell pepper instead of the cauliflower and adding 5 to 6 chopped hard boiled eggs.  We love it and I always receive compliments from friends and family

The dressing (mayo) is supposed to be thick--the layers are thick. The original (around 1975)-no cauliflower) called for a layer of Hellman's on top of the layers with Parmesan, crumbled bacon and chopped boiled egg (salt and pepper) on the mayo. I've never tasted a version that was as good as the original.

Made this last weekend for a BBQ and heard nothing but rave reviews. As with any layered salad presentation is important, but when it's finally on your plate and all mixed up, this one was still a winner.

I made the recipe twice, both times with Morningstar Farms "fake" bacon.  The first time I made it I used lettuce and the second time I used arugula.  Both times it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  The cauliflower and parm give it a special something.  Will use this recipe for 7 layer salad from now on.

Delicious. It's great for parties because it is best when made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight (covered tightly with saran wrap) then tossed right before serving. It's a real crowd pleaser!!

I made this for my son’s HS Graduation Hog Roast party, along with The Pioneer Woman’s Fresh Corn Casserole with Red Bell Peppers and Jalapenos & her Perfectly Baked Beans.  Everything was a huge hit.  I had to quadruple the recipes to accommodate 150 guests.  Will definitely make these recipes again.

I thought a pound of bacon seemed way too much, so I used a 12-ounce pack. It shrunk down a lot though when cooked crispy for crumbling, and a pound would have been better. As suggested by another reviewer, I used  a cup each of mayo and sour cream (both reduced fat) to make the dressing easier to spread. It was still a bit too thick, so next time I'll add a couple tablespoons of milk. I'll also omit the sugar. Don't know if the low-fat mayo I used (Duke's) was sweeter than regular, but my dressing came out way too sweet. I'll make this again because it's a great salad for the buffet table, but I'll tinker some more with the dressing.

Great recipe, it is very similar to the one I make.  This is the perfect side dish for any family gathering it goes well with any entrée.  We even order pizza and have this as a side dish for a quick meal with the in-laws and everyone loves it!  I make this in a glass 13 x 9 pan so I make a little bit more dressing:  2 cups mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons lemon juice.  Don't worry about the dressing being too thick-just spread it on with a spatula and it will be fine.  It holds together better when you serve it this way and doesn't drip all over the plate!  I layer this differently in a 13 x 9:  Iceberg lettuce, then the other chopped vegetables ending with the onion, so that it touches the dressing (The flavors meld well together if these are touching).  Then I layer on half the cheese, the bacon and the rest of the cheese.

This is my favorite salad recipe!  I usually make extra dressing, and use half the lettuce.  I just buy a big bag of pre-washed lettuce from the store.  I also cook the bacon on a cookie sheet in the oven and then crumble it when it cools down.  I have streamlined this a lot.  There is a restaurant in our town that uses the recipe and it tastes exactly the same as mine!  Great pick!

I have update this recipe using spinach with a mix of lettuces instead of just the iceberg.  I also have varied the dressing.  I add garlic, dill, sour cream, white wine, and pepper.  I also mix the red onion to the dressing.  SOoo much better than the original.

The dressing makes this. I left out the peas as I don't like them but otherwise it's very good.  It only lasts a day or so and the lettuce gets really soggy.

Love all combinations of this salad.  I used what we had from a veggie standpoint...broccoli, carrots, celery, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, shelled edamame, red onion and cheese with the dressing as written.  Very refreshing side to lobster tails and roasted red potatoes.  Thanks Leah for your base recipe which is also wonderful!

Very easy and simple to make. I make the dressing using light mayo, and make it 24hrs in advance, to let the flavors blend. I've even used a mixture of light mayo and light sour cream, to kind of lessen the thickness of it and it always tastes great. I always put a layer of dressing in the middle of the salad as well as on top.

I'm not sure, but I think this may be the best salad I've ever eaten.  We had it last night for dinner, and I had it again for breakfast this morning.  My wife made a couple of substitutions.  Leaf or bib lettuce vs iceberg, Green onions vs red, and she used my grilled and home smoked bacon in it. This is really a great recipe!!!

My mother has been making a version of this salad every single Christmas of my life. Instead of a sweet dressing (we aren't sweet dressing kind of people) she does salt, pepper, and quite a bit of lemon juice. It is fantastic and I recommend that to people who look for a tangier dressing.

This is a family favorite that I've been making for about 5 years.  Nice to be able to make in advance of the dinner and not be burdened with that additional work on "the" day.  Enjoyed by all ages in my family, even the kids.  Wonderful recipe and the only changes I make is to layer the ingredients, even the dressing.  Makes for a lovely looking salad in addition to being tasty.

I make a salad like this, but a lighter, vegetarian version.  Use low-fat mayo and cheese.  Substitute "bacon" chips for the bacon.  It is delicious and no one knows it is "light."

Used this recipe, substituting honey for the white sugar. Also added a squirt of lemon juice. Premixed the salad an hour before event for quick serving. Everyone raved!

I make this salad with a slight variation -- instead of drizzling the salad dressing over the top, I layer 1 pint of mayonaise in with the vegetable layers, topped by 1 pkg of dry Italian dressing mix.  I also use freshly grated parmesian as the top layer instead of mixing it with the mayonaise.  Just before serving, I thoroughly mix the layers together.  It is just perfect, and there is no problem with the dressing being too thick to evenly coat each serving.  I layer in this order (bottom to top) and refrigerate until mixing and serving: shredded lettuce cauliflower bacon mayonaise dry Italian dressing mix frozen peas freshly grated Parmesan cheese

This was deeeelish.. took it to a Memorial day cookout last night; big hit! I started with bib lettuce, then cauliflower florets, green onion, diced tomatos, bacon, cheddar cheese, and just before serving, I topped it with diced advocado. We used a bottled dressing...we were running late. It was really sooo good. Thanks!

Salad was okay. My husband who typically likes salad, wasn't a big fan of this one. I think the ingredients are a bit bland and the dressing is way too thick for our liking. I won't be making this one again!

This is my favorite 7 layer salad by far.  I usually double the dressing and make a slightly larger salad to take to pot lucks or other parties.  The salad is beautiful and the dressing really tastes wonderful.

Very good! I leave out the cauliflower but leave everything else the same. If you use a bag and a half of pre chopped lettuce mix, it makes the prep even easier. Last time I made this I was out of parmesan cheese so I just omitted it - big mistake - it is way too sweet without it!

I made this for my salad contribution to a potluck yesterday, and it was a HUGE hit! I had several requests for the recipe by the end.  I didn't have cauliflower on hand so left that out. I used green onion instead of white. This was delicious and pretty easy.

This is an excellent salad that I've made for years, but the secret is that this should never be made with anything but Hellman's salad dressing NOT mayonnaise or sour cream!

The best! My mom made this when we were growing up all the time and I loved it then and I was glad to rediscover the recipe now! I did make a few changes as the recipe was written...instead of 1 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, I did 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of mayonnaise. I didn't use any onion...we're not too fond of onion in our salad. Next time I think I'm going to add some hard boiled egg slices and some carrot slices. Otherwise this was by far a 5 star recipe that I am so glad to have rediscovered!

I give this five stars. You can add or take from this salad as you like. I added cucumbers and celery. I took the advice of another commenter and layered my dressing as I made the salad, rather than put the dressing on top. However, the first commenter was correct in that the dressing does get all through the salad after awhile. It was delicious, and a meal in itself. I think it would be good with little squares of ham, or pepperoni, or chicken, or turkey. Or any combination of meat. I will definitely make this again. My family loved it. I took it to a birthday party. Katherine

I love this salad.  I also put sliced hard boiled eggs in it.  Turkey bacon and fat free mayonaise made it a great salad for dieters.  Wonderful the next day.

This was very good.  I suggest making it in an oblong pan just as the recipe calls for.  I used a glass pedestal bowl like in the picture but when dishing it out you don't get even amounts. 
 My husband requests this often.

Use extra bacon - twice the sugar - and instead of red onions use green onions.  This is super fantastic and one of my favorite recipes!

Fabulous!!!  I used real bacon bits from a bag..one pouch was perfect.  I will use scallions instead of red onions next time....it will make it a bit milder, since many people were picking through the onions.  I'm an onion fan, but it was still a little too much for me.  But what amazing flavor!!  :)

Just tried this and it was a HIT! The only problem I noticed was the recipe said to drizzle dressing on top of salad and mine was too thick to do anything but spoon and spread. Still was great!

Hubby loves this salad and asks for it - but it makes so much that it's only made when we're having ALOT of people over.  I make it the night before then toss it in a giant bowl for the big day.

I was impressed by the rating and so we had this as our Thanksgiving salad.  It was a generous "ok".  WAY too many onions (and I like onions). The bacon gave it great flavor which sort of saved it.  I won't be making it again.

Definitely a crowd pleaser!  I spent much of my childhood growing up in Kentucky and this type of salad is very common at family get-togethers and church potluck dinners.  I was excited to find this recipe because it reminded me of my grandmother's cooking.  I made a few changes to this recipe for health reasons and to make it more like Granny's :-) I used romaine instead of iceberg lettuce for added nutrition, used a white onion because I didn't have a red one on hand, added chopped celery and cucumbers, and left out the chedder cheese (not a big cheese fan), and left out the bacon because I've cut pork from my diet.  I added diced eggs for the protein replacement and texture.  I decreased the sugar to 1 Tbsp. and ommitted the parm. cheese.  It still tasted fantastic.  It's the fact that the salad sits in the refridgerator for so long that makes taste the way it does.  I usually let mine sit for a day and then stir it up a few hours before eating.  I would like to try adding some turkey bacon next time as well as trying a little parm sprinkled on top.  The bacon definitely adds a nice salty diversity that I'm missing right now.  Either way, it's great....goes good topped on some sesame rye crackers and paired with some melon for a healthy lunch.  Thanks a bunch!

YUM!!!  With my picky-eaters at my house, this ends up being a 4 layer salad, but it is great!!!  The salad dressing is delicious, I usually add a little lemon juice to it.  I cook  my bacon in the oven at 400, so it cooks up nice and crisp. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I've made several different versions of this salad and it's ALWAYS a hit at my dinner parties. I love it and it's one of my staples for company. It saves time, too, because you make a day ahead of your dinner. Most recently, one guest told me he didn't need anything else..he could make a whole meal of this salad alone! It's  a great recipe.

I love this recipe!  I didn't have bacon so instead I added cubed ham and it was deilicious.  I take it to every summer function we go to.  Everybody raves and asks for the recipe!  I wasn't too sure about the cauliflower but it added great texture and tasted great, too.

I have made this numerous times since my first review.  I have substituted the meat with cubed ham, honey turkey and even lunchmeat turkey and ham.  I have since tried it with bacon (which I'm not a fan of) and it was delicious!  I think I like it best with the bacon.  Go figure!  Also, I've used any kind of shredded cheese I had on hand and they were all very good but a cheddar mix was the tastiest.  And I've used red onion and yellow onion.  Red is better for presentation but they both taste great.  My daughter is on a sychro skating team and they've asked me to make this for everyone of our get-togethers!

My family has been making this recipe for years!!!! If you try sprinkling dry ranch dressing and added frozen corn it makes it even more scrumptious. To keep it from being a little dry throughout the layers I mix a little dressing in while layering it. But I use canned corn and peas instead. Wonderful recipe!

Very fresh and crunchy salad.  Everyone had seconds.  I also added white vinegar to the dressing and used real bacon.  Also good the next day, as the dressing doesn't make the lettuce soggy.

Served this at work and at home. Was well recieved in both places. Took the advise of others and added some red wine vinegar, lemon juice and salt to the dressing. If you don't mix the dressing in and scoop out the salad it will keep for leftovers. It is a keeper!

We loved this dish, my husband said it was better than the pork chops, which he loves. I added a little milk to thin down the dressing. 
***** Excellent

Excellent recipe. The dressing is forgiving, so you can use more or less of any ingredients -- I didn't have Parmesan on hand, so I added a bit of garlic powder and salt instead.  I recommend using a wide, flat dish, such as a casserole dish, so that it's easier to scoop and serve.  (It does look "prettier" in a trifle dish, but it makes it far more difficult to scoop out and get all of the ingredients onto your plate.)
I highly recommend layering it in the following order, especially if you're making this recipe more than a few hours in advance:  
Lettuce (I used Romaine),
Peas,
Cauliflower,
Onion (I omitted this),
Dressing,
Cheddar Cheese,
Tomato,
Bacon.  
Layering in this order ensures the bacon stays dry and crispy on top, the salad sticks together better when you're scooping it, and the dressing settles in closer to the veggies--where you need it!  :-)

I made it exactly a written. No changes. None. This is an amazing salad and perfectly delicious as offered. My guests devoured it and begged for the recipe. I will make this for every holiday and special occasion. And yes it's a lot of bacon which means the perfect amount.

I used green onions instead.. I used 1 cup of mayo n 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt with 2 Tbsp of ranch dressing . I also used only 1/2lb of bacon on top in 8 x 8 glass casserole dish n 8 oz of reduced fat shredded cheese. Oh n canned peas drained is all I had..Put 1/2 dressing in middle rest on top. Yummy. Work associates loved it..

I used 1/3 of an onion chopped fairly finely and it was still too strong for the salad. I would not use a red onion again. I chopped cherry tomatoes and made an additional layer of those. Overall the salad was good but not the desired effect I was going for. The bacon helps a lot. Get good bacon if you make it.

Next time will use more sugar in the mayo or just use Miracle Whip; dressing needed sweeting up.  Perhaps some cider vinegar too, rjb, Jan-2015....after reading many reviews the dressing should be 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream and parmesan and sugar to taste. RjB

The dressing would have been WAY too thick and gloopy for our tastes so I just made one with aioli, olive oil and apple cider vinegar whisked together. Also used smoked duck breast (for omnivores) and tempeh bacon (for vegetarians). I loved the presentation!

Followed recipe except used half of the red onion.  Next time will layer the dressing on top of the lettuce.  Just think the dish will be more attractive.  Took this to a pot luck and all was eaten.

I love this recipe and it is always a hit at potlucks and family get togethers. Suggestion for the dressing... put it into a bag and pipe it onto the salad. Then gently spread it over the salad. Just before serving, add some chopped tomato and sliced hard-boiled egg over the top of the dressing. Great salad!

Perfect recipe for the classic Seven layer salad!  I ommitted the sugar (only because I hate that sweet taste and it reminds me of Miracle Whip).  I also substituted with 1 c. mayo + 1 c. sour cream and it turned out perfect.  Was a huge hit!

This recipe or a version of it has been around for years. I use sliced water chestnuts instead of caulifower.  Wonderful!  It is ALWAYS a hit!

This recipe is awesome. It was a great compliment to Easter dinner. I mixed spring greens with iceberg lettuce for the crunch, color, and greater nutritional value of the deeper greens. The combination of red and green onion also added  color and varied the flavor. For the dressing I mixed equal amounts of reduced fat mayonnaise and light sour cream; used just 2 teaspoons of a sugar substitute. Grated Parmesan cheese was a delicious compliment to the dressing. Next time I make this I will add whole cherry tomatoes. Enjoy!!!

Love love love love love! We call this our company salad. Everyone I serve it to is equally impressed and asks for the recipe. I followed another reviewer's advice and used a cup of sour cream and a cup of mayo. Otherwise everything else was the same. So good!

The only change I made is instead of cauliflower I put a layer of chopped red and green peppers, and I put the grated cheese on the top.  I serve the dressing separated to add to your own serving.

This was a hit.  I did some adjustments.  I omited the cauliflower and added cucumbers and grape tomatoes.  I also used romaine lettuce. I felt there was not enough dressing to the second time I made this salad a  kinda double the dressing (we like it swimming in dressing).  This is a keeper.

Loved this one. You can add or leave out the things that you love or don't really care for. We added tomatoes, used canned peas that were chilled, omitted the cauliflower, added broccoli, forgot about the sugar, added a little pepper for some spice, and it was wonderful. We have made this two weekends in a row!!

I thought the salad was the best part of our meal!.. I did change up the vegetables for what I had and also for what others didn't like; NO onion!   I forgot the cheese which I did have but felt that's ok since the dressing was full of parmesan.  I used Romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, broccoli and bacon.  To the dressing I added salt, pepper and a dash of worcersershire sauce.  The only changes I would make would be to put the dressing on the lettuce and end in something pretty!

I have made this recipe for two family reunions and six BBQ's...it's a hit every time!  Everyone asks for the recipe and it keeps so fresh and crisp.  I always use frozen peas and they thaw out just in time to eat.  This is one of my favourite sharing dishes!

I served this for the first time a few years back but gave no review.  My family loves this dish and requests it not only for special occasions, but throughout the year.  This is an awesome salad that has gained a special place in our Thanksgiving and Christmas menu.

My friend made this for me years ago, but I lost the recipe. Iam so glad that I found it here! I changed it around alittle bit to the way my friend made it. I put a layer of lettuce a layer of onion, hard boiled eggs,peas,spinach leafs. Then I put the dressing on ( I thinned it out with milk) then a layer of crumbled bacon and sharp cheese. DELICIOUS! Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I really like this salad. The dressing is thick, however, you can do the 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream or you can add a little bit of Vinegar (maybe 1/2 tsp) to thin it slighting and add some tang. My MIL makes this salad often and it is also one of my mom's faves as she used to refer to it as "Pea Salad". Very easy and great!

This is a great tasting salad with big presentation points. I make mine in a square punch bowl and every time I take it to a family gathering, the recipe is requested.  I add red peppers with the red onion and use shredded asiago instead of parmeasan. This salad is one of my husbands favorites.

Thought this was good and very similar to what I have made before.  One difference I have done in the past is to put in the refrigerator over night and mix before serving.  Also, no need to mix the mayo and sugar, just sprinkle over top.

I've had this several different ways before. This was good but I think the dressing was a bit on the thick side and really didn't add that something special to the ingredients.

I remember this recipe from my childhood.  I added sliced boiled eggs to the top and omited the cauliflower.  It was a hit! It keeps for days so any leftovers get eaten too.
If you're not a big onion fan, substitue fresh green onion or use 1/2 the onion called for.

This recipe was fantastic. I used half miracle whip, half mayonaise for the dressing. I also used green onions and boiled eggs, mozza cheese and cheddar cheese in the layers. 

The best part was that it didn't get soggy over night! Still good for lunch the next day!

All my guests loved this and asked for the recipe.  I cut back on the chopped onion, used about 1/2 onion instead.  Also used more than 1 cup cauliflower, and I used packaged bacon bits, about 2 small packages. The dressing is thick, but works well if you toss it all together right before serving. Great recipe, thanx!

This was an excellent salad!  It lasted for several days, which made it a great candidate to pack quickly into lunches for several days.  The dressing was thick - no way to drizzle, but it was fine on top.  I did use way less onions than required and it worked out well.

Really liked this a lot but how can you not? It has BACON in it! I too did half mayo/half sour cream but jut mayo would have been good too. I think the next time I make it I won't use iceberg but will maybe used mixed greens. I took this to a preThanksgiving feast and it was a hit. Thanks!

Great recipe!! I also made a few changes as i have made this several times. I use grilled chicken breast sometimes instead of bacon, i have also used both together. i am not big on cauliflower so i always use chopped cabbage instead. I have also added golden raisins occasionally for extra sweetness, and for the dressing i use part ranch and part mayo with the sugar and parmesean cheese. (i am yet to try white vinegar as suggested by others, but i sure will)

This is a great salad.  I had this many years ago when a friend made it, but the cauliflower wasn't part of it.  The cauliflower is a great addition and the dressing is very good.  So easy and so tasty!

The only problem I had with this was the amount it made...I ended up with a lot left over after the potluck.  It had a very good flavor though!  Maybe next time I'll half the recipe and use a smaller dish.

Acutally we'd give it 6 stars. The only problem with this salad is that once I made it, I have been asked to make it over and over and over and over. It draws rave reviews. I omitted the cauliflower and used green onions instead.  The dressing doesn't drizzle, but if you top with shredded parmesan on grated parmesan it looks nicer when serving.  Numerous kids think it is the "best salad I've ever had".

I love love love this recipe.  I had made it long ago except I did not use parm cheese.  The trick is  when mixing the Hellman’s and sugar, pour on top of salad. It needs to chill for about 24  hours to allow the sugar time to break down the mayo.   It will literally seep through the salad. If you are using a beautiful glass bowl, you can watch it happen.

Ps I used more mayo and more sugar. Yum

I've been making this for  years & years!! Only I add mushrooms & celery , no cauliflower (use any combo, except for avocado, which I LOVE, and would use, but for obvious reasons can't sit overnight for fear of turning brown!!) which is how my family has made it,   and the tastes I crave!!!The idea of adding the dressing in the middle is pretty good as well as mixing before serving, since I can remember not getting some items as people served it, they would get more of something and too much dressing!!I most certainly think washing the lettuce very well or use a salad spinner, then putting between paper toweling or a clean towel, to get as much moisture as possible from any vegetables. If you don't like any of the vegetables, use anything you prefer, I've never used tomatoes, since I think there's too much moisture, unless you peel off skin in a hot water for 30 seconds or in microwave, then in bowl with ice water, seed and dice. I'm making as I write this and the bacon smells divine, can't wait till tomorrow, when I serve with Rib eyes and baked beans!!!Dessert will be pound cake with berries and Brown sugar whipped cream!!!Yum, enjoy!!! ; ' ) ; ' )

Love this salad.  I did 2 layered sections w/dressing in between.  I also changed the dressing by doing 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo.  Guests raved about it & ate the whole thing!!

This is the best salad...makes a lot!  You may think that the dressing isn't going to be enough...but it is and so delicious!
It is fine w/yellow onions but so much better w/red (which I don't usually like)!  I add grape tomatoes in my clear bowl dead center on the outside against bowl, so pretty also!!!

Omg.  So delicious!  The change I made was using 1 cup sour cream, and 1 cup mayo into the parmesan...and using stevia in place of sugar.  Incredibily good.

If I could make a recommendation. I would do these in individual bowls. It's pretty as is but to make sure everyone gets the same amount of all ingredients small glass bowls seem to be better.

This is a summer bbq favorite. I also find the dressing a bit thick. I have found that by adding a bit of white wine vinegar- it cuts down on the graininess  of the sugar and cheese and thins it  out a bit. I also like to add a dash or two of garlic powder because it adds a kick.

Very good.  I made dressing with 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream.  I sprinkled shredded Parmesan and bacon bits on top.  I used butter and iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes halved, cauliflower, shredded carrots, red onion, cheese, and peas.  Next time I will probably add some mushrooms.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and took an empty bowl home. Also being asked when I'm I going to make this again. I have made a layered lettuce salad and it usually goes over well, but this was gone. I like the adding of parmesan cheese, plus I added diced water chestnuts and black olives. YUM!

I make this all the time because it is constantly requested!  It is very tasty, but make it a day ahead of time and let the flavors set it overnight in the refrigerator.  I also make extra “dressing” because I don’t think the recipe has enough.  I serve it on the side.

The red onion is very over powering. I used a medium and it's just too much. This would have been perfect with less or a less potent type of onion, which I will use next time. I still liked it though.

This salad looks amazing and is nice to put on the table when entertaining guests.  I don't really care for it though. It's very heavy for a salad. I don't think crunchy cauliflower goes very well with  the other ingredients especially mayonnaise. If your guests are picky eaters, you can be sure there is something here for everybody to avoid or hate. :)

I took other reviewers advice and made the dressing with 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  However, next time I'll stick with the original recipe and spread it under the cheese and bacon.  Overall this was delicious.

I have always loved seven layer salad but never made it.  Finally decided to try it and was very pleased with this recipe.  I did sub broccoli for the cauliflower because my hubby is not a cauliflower fan. Everything else I left the same except instead of ending with the mayo spread I put that on second to last and then topped with the shredded cheese.  Everyone loved it!...... Including our Russian foreign exchanged student!  She said they don't make this in Russia and she wanted to know how to make it for her family back in Russia.

I love seven layer salad! Since the grandkids are at the beach this week and only my daughter and I are home,  I've made a half recipe of this twice this week. Always before we put just mayonnaise on top for the dressing but I did use the mayonnaise, parmesan cheese, sugar, and sour cream dressing the first time I made it. I thought the dressing was a little sweet so the second time I made it without the sugar. We like that much better! I also use real bacon pieces rather than frying up bacon for the salad. It works very well. I also think that this salad can be made with pretty much whatever salad vegetables you have on hand. Since I was cutting the recipe in half, I made it in an 8 x8 inch dish.

I changed the dressing  recipe a bit. Prefer 3/4 cup  Mayo and 3/4 cup sour cream for the dressing. My family loves this salad, always a great side for potluck or summer cookouts.

This is a Staple for our Family Christmas and Easter dinners.. If this isn't served there are uproars! I vary the lettuce.. Mixture of Romaine, Iceburg, some Fresh Spinach too. For the Dressing I use half Miracle Whip (leave out sugar) and Half Sour Cream. Drop dollaps of dressing onto top of salad and spread gently with a spatula or bread knife

Delicious.  I used iceberg lettuce (pat dry with towel), red onion, green peas, red pepper, celery and bacon - all green and red for Christmas!  Used the recommendation of others with 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream and the sugar for the dressing, and topped it with shredded Italian Cheese mixture (I think it had mozzarella, parmesan, romano, and provolone).  Made it the day before in a 9 X 13 glass dish and the flavors blended very well, dressing was neither too thick nor too thin.  A family favorite that I will make again and again!

Delicious - I used less parmesan in the dressing than called for but it added a nice touch.  Also added a layer of hard boiled eggs and a layer of celery.  It needed more than 1 cup of cauliflower.

Excellent as always - I omitted the cauliflower (I don't like the crunch) and like some others added a bit of cider vinegar to the dressing mixture with half mayo/half sour cream.  Fix the night before and it is ready for your dinner the next day.

This is a good recipe.  I added broccoli, changed the red onion to green onion and doubled the dressing because I layered this in a 9"x13" pan (because it needs to travel a couple of hours) and the amount of dressing called for only covered the salad by about a millimeter.

We took this salad to a party.  There was so much food and our dish was the last to arrive.  I was anticipating we would be taking most of it home as several people had already filled their plate.  But as soon as the first people tried some, a couple of people were loudly asking, who made the salad and could they get the recipe?  Needless to say I didn't come home with any.  My husband requested a do over.  I used a 50/50 mix of mayonnaise and miracle whip.  Added about 2 teaspoons vinegar in addition to sugar and Parmesan cheese. (I think the fresh, grated Parmesan really distinguishes the dressing from most 7 layer salad recipes.). Also added about 1 tablespoon of dry ranch salad mix as others suggested.  Substituted sliced cherry tomatoes for cauliflower to enhance presentation color.  And added 3 hard boiled eggs, sliced.  And I chunked the bacon vs crumbling it.  I liked that the dressing quantity doesn't overpower the salad.

Will definitely make this again!  Absolutely delicious!  I took the previous tips of mixing half sour cream and half mayo for the dressing and used a small block of freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I also replaced the cauliflower with chopped broccoli and added sliced cucumbers over the peas and halved grape tomatoes over the broccoli. Also - instead of iceberg lettuce I used a bag of mixed green and leaf lettuce and chopped it up and used Vidalia Onion instead of red onion. It mixed up well before serving and everybody loved it! Such a refreshing and delicious summer salad!

Great salad. The only change I made was to replace cauliflower with celery, as this more closely represented this salad as I've had it in the past.

I get requested to make this every year for an office holiday party, but it can be made all year long. It's been a big hit for over three years now. I use romain instead of iceberg. It's a versatile salad. You can experiment with the layering and ingredients any way you like though I follow this recipe strictly for my office ladies.

the dressing was way to thick for my liking. I added some 2% milk and used low fat mayo & added some S&P & parsley. Will see how it turned out later at my Bible Study class end of year celebration. :-)

I have made this salad a couple of times with rave reviews. I add a little @Weber Smokey Mesquite to my cream mix and a little sour cream along with the parmesan cheese. I substitute the cauliflower with broccoli and add crumbles of boiled egg in it. Delicious and eye pleasing.

I agree, a glass bowl is required.   This is an easy and tasty salad and so pretty.  I used sliced green onions (scallions) instead of red onion and used chopped tomatoes instead of the cauliflower.  Tomatoes make it a prettier salad.  The mayo dressing is delicious!

Delicious, loved the cauliflower.  I also added carrots for flavor and color.  I used 1/2 cup of sour cream for some of the mayo and added a Tbls of vinegar.  Turned out great but I think I'll try the recipe as is next time just to see.

Wow, this was great, and looked beautiful too!  I used the same kind of dish as in the picture (a trifle bowl).  I think that this is a must in order to get the full impact of how beautiful the salad is!  I also added a layer of grape tomatoes, a layer of black olives and a layer of cucumber.    yummy!

Pretty salad and good except I used lowfat mayo and splenda to cut back sugar and calories.  The dressing was way too thick and I kept adding milk but it still was tough to spread and turned out to be gloppy when it was eaten.

This was a GREAT salad. I made it last night with what veggies I had on hand..no peas, added red pepper and a layer of fresh parsley, I took the advice of others an did 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo. The only part I wont do again is to add the sugar. I added more parmesan to cover over the sweetness..I didnt care for the sweetness. OH I also only put bacon on a half layer, being that my 18 year is a vegetarian. Over all it was very, very good.DEFINETLY will make again!

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years.  But mixing the mayonaise, cheese, and sugar provides for a smoother dressing.  I replace the parmesan cheese with grated reggiano romano.

Always an impressive salad severed in a high glass bowl. I use tomatoes in place of the cauliflower as I don't care for the texture that the cauliflower brings to the salad but other than that I serve it as written. It always taste better then next day after I serve it but there is rarely much left for leftovers!

Great recipe. Like any seven layer salad the layers are really up to you! and your tastes buds. Since we are not fans of cauliflower I ommitted it and added tomatoes and cucumbers. I doubled the dressing mix and added it in the middle of the layers and on the top. This was a winner!! Thanks.

I really liked this salad.  The dressing was different in a good way, not an overpowering flavor.  My ranch-loving husband even liked it.  I will make this again.

I followed the recipe step by step.  The creamy mix was WAY too thick.  It never settled into the salad mix which is what I think makes a good seven layer salad.

What's not to love about this classic salad recipe?   This is always a favorite at family dinners and potlucks.  Easy to put together and looks great on a buffet.  The parmesan cheese gives a really nice touch to the dressing.

Exactly the taste that I was looking for!! Had this with our 4th of July BBQ. Our guests loved it too and actually left with the recipe (at the husbands request!). Very decorative on the table too!

Very good and easy to make.  I took the advice of others and added vinegar to the dressing to thin it out.  I also added a very little amount of lemon juice to the dressing.  I took this to a family dinner, and it was gone in no time.

I served this salad with Sunday lunch and everyone liked it. I would prefer a little less cheese, though. Thanks for sharing.

I haven't had this since I was a kid.  Brought it to a holiday potluck, and it was delicious!  I would have diluted the mayo topping a bit like some of the other reviewers but I didn't read the reviews til afterwards.
