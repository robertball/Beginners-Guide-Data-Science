I'm not a fan of having to peel back hot husks to eat my corn, so we removed all husks, slathered on the Brummel and Brown and sprinkled on creole seasoning (I can't imagine using 1T for each ear!!  We used 1T for all four ears).  Very good.  We'll be grilling corn a lot this summer!

I ran out of room in the pan for boiling corn, so I tried this.  Only I didn't grill it (no room on the grill), I buttered the cobs and sprinkled the seasoning on, wrapped them in tinfoil (already husked them)and popped them in the broiler at 400 for 1/2 hour.  Very tender, better then boiled. The child in my house didn't try it, but I'm sure he would love it!!  Thank you for the recipe. P.S. can't wait to try it on the grill!!

This is really good corn. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and allowed plenty of time to cook. I'd say more like 40 to 50 minutes than 25. I will make this again.

I mixed the seasoning and butter together then brushed the mixture onto the corn. It gave the corn a very nice flavor.

This just wasn't very good.  I used a 1/2 cup of butter and only 3 tbsp. of cajun seasoning and I thought it was far too overpowering.  I like spicy food and so does my husband but neither of us liked this.  We had guests who were polite and said it was good but I will never do it again.  Sweet summer corn is 1000 times better with plain ol' salt, pepper and butter.  Save yourself the extra work and don't bother!

There's nothing like grilled corn on the cob and it's a great accompaniment to any BBQ meal! I grilled the corn as I usually do, soaking the corn in cold water mixed with sugar and salt for a few hours. I then grill it in the husk.  When it was done I buttered it and then sprinkled with "Cajun Spice Mix" by Bobbie Jean from this site. This took regular grilled corn and gave it a nice kicked up Cajun flavor - great recipe that's very simple, yet very good!

Personally, I don't eat corn. I think it's gross. I generally just use it to feed deer :) However, the rest of my family does like corn so on occassion I will make some for them. According to them, this turned out very good. Perfectly cooked, perfectly flavored. The steaming process worked very well. Thanks.

Made this corn tonight and it was excellent.  I did cut back a bit on the cajun seasoning, i used a half tablespoon for 2 ears of corn, and 1 tablespoon of butter for each ear of corn.  I mixed the seasoning and butter together and then spread it on the corn.  Tasty!

I took some frozen corn cobs and rolled them in melted butter, and sprinkled Cajun seasoning on.  Then wrapped each one in foil and took it car camping (threw it on the fire for 15 min - frozen corn is already cooked).  Really really good.

Didn't find any difference with pre-buttering the corn or putting it on after it was cooked.  As for the cajun seasoning, I didn't find it added much to the flavor at all.  Too much work for something that turns out the same if you just de-husked and wrapped in tin foil.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It is a little work pulling back the husks, but well worth it! It is a GREAT thing to make around the campfire- we double wrapped the corn and just threw them on the fire. We also added a bit of Mrs. Dash for added flavor. Half of the family never even got to the other courses in the meal- they only wanted the corn. Great summer recipe! Will definately make again!

We skipped the foil and just grilled the corn in their husks (after removing the silk).  Didn't make much difference other than the husks a little burnt, but no damage to the corn.

Ohhhhh yeahhhh!!!  Used frozen corn as that was all I had, and this turned out excellent.  Will make again for those "in need of a side dish" nights!

I gave this 3 stars because I wasn't sure if the problem was the recipe or the corn.  Our corn was dry and not very tasty.  I think next time I will preboil the corn and then just finish off on the grill.  Plus, the cajun spice I used ended up burning.

I didn't quite get the right amount of seasoning on my corn, but at least from my photo you get the idea.  My hubby liked this a lot.  I think it was too done for me (I like everything rare).  He will want me to make this again, though, and I will---but with more seasoning and more butter and more salt.

This was a nice twist on traditional grilled corn. I did however husk my corn, rub butter all over and sprinkle the cajun seasoning onto it, and then wrapped it up in foil. Mine took about 45 minutes on the grill so plan ahead so it can be done when you take your meat off the grill.

These were good.  The only problem we saw was that we weren't sure if it was overdone or underdone.  The timing seemed off.  But, nonetheless, good recipe.

I really had a craving for corn on the cob and this recipe really hit the spot. Even my boyfriend who doesn't care for corn on the cob raved about this to all his buddies. We plan on making up a whole batch for our biker benefit. Thank you so much.

A great side dish for the barbee.... perfect when teamed up with grilled vegies, salads, seafood or meat.  I will definetly be making these again... next time I'll only use half of the recommended butter though because the husks give the corn a natural sweetener.  Delicious!!!!!

Easiest to grill corn with no husks, strings, or foil. Turn it occasionally. When you here it "pop", its done! Truly tastes like GRILLED Corn, Latino-style!

Delicious! I used cut corn and Emeril's Essence as the cajun seasoning but only 1 T for the whole batch and it seems 1 T each serving would be way too much for my tastes. I used unsalted butter but only 2 T. I really liked this, no one made any comments they simply ate. The fact they didn't leave any tells me it was good enough. Thanks Gingerhager.

We really enjoyed this. We actually did it in the oven.  I also added a little salt, pepper, and cayenne to it before placing it in the oven. We'll definitely be having this again.

This was a nice change from the usual corn on the cob. I removed all the corn husks first, mixed a little cajun seasoning in with the butter, then slathered the butter mixture on the corn, and then wrapped tightly with foil. I went easy on the seasoning because I didn't want it to be too pepper for the kids. I will definitely use more seasoning next time so I can get more of the Cajun flavor. I think I will also leave the husks on next time because my corn got a little too burnt. Maybe the husks will make a difference? Good recipe. I should have followed it more closely.

Tasty! We had new sweet corn and the blend of the spicy/sweet taste was great especially with the ribs that I grilled. Make sure that you rotate the corn so it cooks evenly. Very good. I think I will try this as well with frozen corn kernels or canned corn.

I never thought to add cajun seasoning to corn, and it was fabulous!  Will eat all of our corn on the cob this summer this way!

Nice flavor and easy to make.  While I prefer boiled corn, it's nice to throw these on the grill and not heat up the house.

Definately not worth the trouble.  I barely tasted the cajun spice (I put a lot).  I was disapointed, and won't be making this again.  Sorry...
