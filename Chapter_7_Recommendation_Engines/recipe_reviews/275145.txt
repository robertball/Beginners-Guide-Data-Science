I couldn't find garlic base at my local store, so I substituted chicken bouillon with some garlic powder. The result was still a restaurant quality meal I thoroughly enjoyed.

This was a really good, easy recipe. I doubled it all and fed a family of 5 with leftovers. I used Walkers jerk seasoning, and next time will add more. I also didn't have the garlic base so used chicken stock and added garlic. Very warming but flavorful.

I made 2 changes, gluten and dairy free. I substituted the water and whipping cream with 1 can of coconut milk, and used gluten free penne. I also didn't add cheese at the end. It came out great, and I can honestly say I didn't miss the cheese. We will definitely being eating this again.
