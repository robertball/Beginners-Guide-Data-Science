Great flavor and quick to prepare after the chicken is marinaded. I added some onion and red bell pepper when I sauted the squash and served it with rice.

This was really good.  I found when served with white rice it was pretty bland, so next time I will serve it with some fried corn tortilla strips, refried beans, and pico de gallo.  It was really easy and quite tasty!

I made this recipe last night and boy was it delicious! I only had zucchini, so I doubled up on this for the vegetables. I added a dash of tabasco for heat, since I was out of chili powder. I used a seasoning blend that had all sorts of spices in it. I served this over couscous, with a little mexican cheese and some fat free sour cream. This was a very fast last minute meal.

Very enjoyable recipe. I don't like squash or zucchini, so I swapped them out for red peppers (although I'll probably add other types of peppers in the future). It added great flavor to the meal and I will definitely make it again.

The wife and I enjoyed the flavour and ease of making it and will do this again real soon.
