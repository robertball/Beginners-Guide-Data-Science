It seemed kind of bland to us. Could have used some garlic powder or another seasoning to jazz it up. Also, I uncovered it and added finely shredded cheddar cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking.

Although this recipe was simple, easy and fast I prefer the taste of real potatoes that I season my self.
