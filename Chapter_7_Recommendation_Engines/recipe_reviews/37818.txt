I have used this recipe a number of times.  My friends and I really do enjoy it for special occasions - like camping out. The cream of wheat makes the toast crisp and delicious.

I really disliked this recipe.  My family thought it was just ok. I thought it was way to crispy outside and way too mushy inside.  I tried cooking them for different lengths thinking it would help.  It did not.   I kept adding more butter and syrup to make it more palitable.  This sounded great but was very disappointing.
