Awesome! Even my husband liked these and he isn't the biggest sweet potato fan. The only changes I made were to top with pecans instead of walnuts, cut the butter in half during the mashing step, and omitted the melted butter at the end. I suspected that all that butter wasn't totally necessary and I was right (at least for our tastes). Don't skip roasting the jalapeno, it gives the potatoes such a great flavor. Thanks!

These are amazing!!! I've gotten really tired of the typical sweet potato dishes that are overly sweet and mixed with brown sugar, spices, etc.  It's fine for Thanksgiving, but when it comes to summer, I want something with a fresh and bright flavor. This recipe totally fits the bill!  I admit, I was running short on time, so I microwaved the potatoes on high for 6 minutes. I used the juice of one small orange. I mashed everything together and that was it. Time to dig in!  I didn't bother drizzling the extra butter over top and baking in the oven.  I also didn't use the walnut pieces, only because I didn't have any, but I'm sure it's quite tasty! The jalapeno really mellows as it roasts, so don't be afraid of using the whole pepper. Next time I will use two!  I will also double the recipe. This is a keeper!

Super Yummy! My family isn't a huge sweet potato fan and these were a huge hit! I only had pickled jalapenos, I added a couple shallots, used frozen orange juice concentrate and less butter. They were super good and I found out from a friend that sweet potatoes have a lower glycemic index than other potatoes.

Absolutely delicious! Had a nice sharp taste to it, but not too hot. Very moist and not sweet. Very good with pork tenderloin marinaded in southwest adobo marinade. I too, cut the butter in half. Will definitely make  again! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic!  The jalapeno and cilantro perfectly balance the sweetness in the potatoes even with the OJ.  I did not blend them I just mashed with a fork because others complained about them being too mushy.  I did not have any walnuts but I think I will try this with Pecans next time which I think will be a better match for the butter and add some texture.  This will be on the menu for Thanksgiving this year!

Delicious.  Very sweet but counteracted by the jalapeno.  Loved it.  Will cook it again.

This is a great recipe especially when you don't want the sweet in the sweet potatoes. I boiled them instead of bake therefore I shouldn't  have put as much orange juice. I served them with bbq chicken, green beans and corn. 
Thank-you Terri for sharing an excellent recipe.

We made this on our camping trip. I just cooked the sweet potatoes in the campfire wrapped in foil for about 50 min. Also roasted the jalapeno over the fire. I then mashed all the ingredients together except the orange juice, didn't have any and really don't think it was needed or we'd like that addition. Also didn't top with walnuts. These were very good and a nice change from regular grilled sweet potatoes, love the roasted jalapeno and sweet potato combo.

My family was not crazy about this recipe, but I did use the white sweet potatoes and not the sweet yams. Perhaps I should try it again.

My husband has made this recipe a constant request in our house, and we have served it at dinner parties: everybody always loves it!

I don't add the butter on top at the end, or walnut peices, simply because I always forget the butter and we have a nut allergy in the house . . . but it's still delicious.  Highly recommended.

My fiance and I really don't like sweet potatoes but got a bunch in our CSA box.  We love spicy food so I gave this recipe a shot.  The only thing I changed was that I used my food processer to mix it instead of a hand mixer.  It was amazing!  Very rich, complex flavor!

This was great if you are tired of too-sweet yam recipes. Gleaned from other reviews and my thoughts:
1) Jalape√±os - had to add back the seeds because it wasn't hot enough. Next time I will roast two and skip the seeds for more flavor and a little more heat.  
2) Butter - use 1/8 cup.  
3) O.J. - used juice from an fresh orange along with some zest. may want to keep this to a minimum.  
4) Mash sweet potatoes rather than blend for more texture.  
5) Can roast sweet potatoes and pepper the day before to save time.  
6) Did not put back in oven, just to save time and I don't think it really needs it. No need to drizzle more butter at the end. It is good to go once mashed up. However roasting the walnuts in a dry skillet for a couple of minutes before topping the dish added to the flavor.  
7) Use more cilantro.
Goes great with pork and also with steak.

Great recipe! I was surprised by the combination of ingredients but it worked! I doubled it but only added one jalapeno and a 1/4 cup of butter with no butter on top. It was perfect! This is a keeper. I only wish my kids liked sweet potatoes! My husband and I really enjoyed it!

This meal was ok. I appreciated the unique recipe, and I received compliments from my boyfriend on this. However, I think it would have tasted a bit better if it was a tad sweeter. I think next time I will go for more of  sweet potato casserole. However, this is a very healthy version and I appreciated the idea!

This is a go-to recipe at my house! It's a perfect flavor combination, zesty herb and buttery goodness, that ditches the tired brown sugar & cinnamon casseroles. I love to pair it with fish and other summer grilled meats. I like the exact butter amount, but the recipe still has plenty of flavor if you want to lighten the fat by cutting the butter in half. (I've made it both ways.) Roasting the jalapeno is essential! It's just the right amount of spice for a little heat but not too much to overpower the dish. And personally, we like a little extra cilantro, but as written, it's still noticeable flavor. I always make at least a double recipe: leftovers for at home, enough to go around at a small dinner party. As written, no changes, this is a true 5 star recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Wow. Homerun! Now we changed the cooking method because it's summer and too hot for the oven. We bbq'd the potatoes whole and then peeled. ouch! The electric mixer was a great idea. Added the walnuts after it was all mixed up and skipped the "back in the oven" step. They were still hot from the Q. I questioned the orange juice but it was surprisingly good. Everyone liked this one and I will make it again for sure! Thank you Terri

Really zippy flavor! Definitely a repeat. Next time I will double it. Also, after roasting the jalepeno I took the seeds out to make it mild enough for the kids to eat. I still got the jalepeno flavor without too much bite. Also could halve the butter to cut down on fat, I didn't notice the difference.

Very good. To clarify,sweet potatoes have white flesh.
This recipe is actually for yams, which are an orange colour.

This was a delicious recipe!  It took my potatoes about 2 hours to become tender enough to mash. I mashed them with a fork instead of a mixer so they had some texture to them. I also cut the butter by half and feel it could use even less if any  Next time I will use more peppers.

These were so good!  I'll admit that I peeled and chopped the potatoes raw and microwaved them instead of baking them with the raw jalapeno already chopped with them, and I threw in two cloves of garlic.  I thought that the OJ really gave them a brightness and I'll definitely make them again!

So good, yum! I added extra jalapenos and cilantro and omitted the walnuts, but I think it would be good with them next time.

Hubby doesn't usually care for sweet potato recipes because they're overly sweet, but he loved this. And so did I! Next time I will double the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

very good. Read recipe well, before starting; step "1" is actually 5 steps merged all together (for being poorly written, I give it a 4 star). I used 2 jalapenos, like other reviewers, but kept them in the oven 45 min, since they were on the larger side. This dish can tolerate extra baking in the oven to time with other sides or enteee.

This has become my favorite sweet potato recipe - sweet and heat is always a winner! The jalapeno gives it just the right amount of heat.

This are pretty tasty.  They are too runny to rate a 5 star though.  When I make them next time, I shall cut the orange juice and/or the butter.
I have found this is better (and easier) if one boils the sweet potatoes and jalapeno instead of baking.  I also prefer it without the orange juice.

This was amazing! I was curious of how cilantro, orange juice, and jalape√±o would complement sweet potatoes, and I was amazed. Though I do confess that I wanted it a little sweeter, so I added about a tablespoon of maple syrup, which toned down the brightness of the orange juice.  Served it as a side for meatloaf.

My family LOVED this and I am not even a sweet potatoe fan but the sweet and spicy was oh so yummy! My question is tho how do you peel the potatoes when they just come out of the oven?? I was burning my fingers! Maybe I'm reading instructions wrong?! And th cooking of the jalepeno part threw me off too- make sure to cook the jalepenos when the potatoes are cooking the first time or you will have to add another 20mins to your time. I just popped mine in the george foreman to get them cooked fast!

Made this for the first time last night to go with pork chops. Husband really liked it. 5 stars in my opinion because: a little unusual, pretty healthy, pretty cheap, esey to put together. Did not like the having to "cook twice".

These were very delicious. Only changes? I didn't bother to peel the jalapeno, it was way to hard to do. Maybe I didn't cook it long enough. I also didn't drizzle the butter at the end because it didn't need it. And for personal preferences I didn't add the nuts. I only gave it four stars because it had a consistincy of baby food, not mashed potatoes, but it was still really good.

I just had normal potatoes and green bell peppers at home. Since we cannot eat a lot of hot foods, it was good for us. This recipe rocks. Since it was potatoes, I did not mash it with a mixer, kept it chunky. Used less butter too.

Yum!  Have made these twice already!   I even used only 1 tbsp of light butter (for calorie reasons) and these potatoes were still special!

I thought the cilantro was a great addition to sweet potatoes.  However, the jalapeno was difficult to peel, and did not add much to the flavor.  The nuts didn't go with the cilantro flavor.  The amount of butter was overkill.

A nice twist on the normal sweet potatoe dishes! It was good enough that family wanted the recipe.
