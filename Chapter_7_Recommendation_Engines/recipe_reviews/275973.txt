I made this as written using the water. Very good soup! I love that it's homemade and has great flavors. It makes a lot of soup. I used kluski noodles to give it that perfect chicken noodle soup feel. They took 30 minutes to soften. Did I point out it's a great soup?!?

I cut the chicken into pieces at the start rather than shredding it later in the recipe. Will be making it again very soon. Great tasting recipe.

The recipe is amazing! It's so good that I volunteered to take it to a church function, and I never cook for church functions!

Soup was great. I used chicken broth only - no water added.
