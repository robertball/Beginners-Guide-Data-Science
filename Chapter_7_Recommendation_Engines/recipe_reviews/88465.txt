This was a little bit bland so I added freshly ground pepper, and some garlic powder. We had it with crackers and crudites. Thanks, Holly!

People liked it - I thought it was a bit mayonnaise-ey.  I'll definitely try it again, and maybe throw in some sour cream or cream cheese to cut the taste.

I have also used this recipe with Jarlsburg rather than Provolone and added cracked pepper. This is one that is always requested at family gatherings.

My family loves this dip.  They ask me to make it for every holiday.  I add a little black pepper and instead of baking I put it in a crock pot on low.  It is WONDERFUL!!!  Thank you

What is not to like about cheese and onions?  It was good but the onions might have tasted a little better if sauteed first.  Ate it with chips, crackers, etc.

This was good, but it needed some garlic powder added to it.  We didn't have pumpernickel bread, so we ate it with crackers. I'll make it again. Thanks!

As is I would give this a 3 as it doesn't really look appealing.  After baking (add garlic powder) I spread the dip onto squares of pumpernickle and toasted for another couple minutes then sprinkled some dried parsley on to it and they looked and tasted great.  I was ever able to trick my husband who "doesn't like onions" into eating it without questioning the content.

As recommended by other reviewers, added garlic powder; then saut√©ed the onions- (I'd go light on the oil) and added lemon pepper.  Very simple and really good.
