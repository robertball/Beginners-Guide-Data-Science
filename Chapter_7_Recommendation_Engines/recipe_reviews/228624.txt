Yum, yum, and yum some more.   Coffee and chocolate, how can you go wrong.  We only used about 14 ozs of confectioners sugar instead of 16 ozs.  We put it over a chocolate cake with just a touch of coffee it in as well. We substituted the expresso powder for the three tablespoons of strong coffee. This icing is definitely a keeper.

I made the recipe as stated above but used about 14 oz of powdered sugar. It was sooo ridiculously sweet. I added an additional half cup of cocoa powder just to cut the sickly sweetness and overwhelming flavor of powdered sugar.

Delicious!  I didn't use all the powdered sugar, I just added in more cocoa powder to thicken it.  I used a combination of Hershey's and Hershey's special dark powder.  Everyone loved this frosting!

Used Hershey's Dark Chocolate powder and a bit less sugar and it is perfect. Used on Dark Chocolate Bacon Cupcakes and it was a perfect compliment. Rich, smooth and very chocolatey tasting. Big hit with the family.

This was super easy and super tasty!!!! I used instant coffee, dissolved in about 2T of water along with the salt. Upped the butter to 1 cup, as I was just a touch short of 4oz if cream cheese. I used 4 1/2 c. of powdered sugar. Wasn't too sweet, great coffee notes. Will use again, thanks for sharing.

Just made this recipe today to put on a chocolate cake, in a word, YUM! As was stated by another review, I too used a bit less confectioners sugar. This is my kind of frosting, it is not sickening sweet.

Who out there is a coffee lover?! If you are like me and you love the flavor of coffee in your icing or cake you should try this recipe. You should also consider up-ing the tbs of brewed coffee if you like a more defined taste of coffee in your baked goods. I used about 6 tbs instead of the 3-4 that it recommended. Also I was a little confused about the cream cheese packaging. It specifies 1 package (4oz) but cream cheese packages are normally 8 oz. Am I right?!?! LOL. WELL...I did not know if this was an error on their part or if there was actual cream cheese packages that came in 4 oz. So I decided to use 6 oz's of cream cheese. Between the 2 modifications it turned out just divine. I would definitely use this recipe again. And mostly definitely would recommend it to others for their cakes or treats in the future. Happy Baking & Blessed Be!

Fantabulous! I bought an espresso shot from Star Bucks as I didn't have a dark roast coffee on hand, or a way to brew coffee strong. It turned out to be a great choice for a pop of flavor.

Super easy and it blows store bought frosting out of the water! I double the recipe using a little less powder sugar and 6 tablespoons of mcafe espresso brew from my Keurig. Not overwhelming coffee flavor but just enough to complement the chocolate. You won't be disappointed.

This Frosting was spot on. I did use less of the confectioners sugar and used 4 tbsp. star bucks coffee with a shot of espresso. Fantastic!!!! Especially when paired with the Black Magic Cake.
A must try.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! This was my first time ever homemaking frosting so I was very happy with the results. I followed the recipe with the exception of the 1 1/2 16oz bags of powdered sugar. I couldn't find 16oz bags at my grocery store so I had to get a 32oz bag. I didn't have a way of measuring the powdered sugar exactly so I just used my judgment. I used this frosting to go on the Black Magic Cake from allrecipes. I had more than enough frosting for a 9x13 sheet cake. This recipe would probably make the perfect amount for a 2 layer 9 in round cake. I will definitely be making this again. It was fantastic.

This icing is delicious and very easy to make.  I followed suggestions in the reviews, less confection sugar and more cocoa, with a bit more coffee.  It was super creamy and not overly sweet at all.  I used it on a double layer vanilla cake.  Plenty of icing for that. The whole crowd gave it a thumbs up! This will be my go to Chocolate Icing!

This is the perfect chocolate frosting. I make it according to instructions but sometimes don't add the entire 16 oz. of powered sugar to make it soft and creamy. Sifting the powered sugar is key to getting it smooth and lovely. Just a hint of coffee flavor really highlights the chocolate. It's now my go-to recipe for a dessert gift.

Yeah, Similar to many other people I put in less sugar and a dash more cocoa powder and it came out great! It still was a little more sugary than i'm used to while baking but fantastic on chocolate cake nonetheless. Also I made it without the coffee and easily replaced it with about 2 1/2 tbsp of water instead to make up that consistency.

I made this recipe with no changes... and WOW!!! This is honestly the best-tasting icing I've EVER had! It was super smooth and creamy (the cream cheese is a total game changer!), it was plenty chocolatey, and best of all: it wasn't yucky sweet. The sweetness of this icing is tempered by the cream cheese, coffee, and salt. I did see a few reviews saying they cut back the powdered sugar a bit, so I was careful. However, I accidentally used butter with salt, so I halved the salt. That allowed me to actually go over the amount of powdered sugar to thicken it a tad while ending up with scrumptious icing!

My husband got a kick out of me doing my happy dance in the kitchen! Most of all, he really loved his birthday cake.. Many thanks to the person who posted and those who reviewed this recipe. It will be a standard in my kitchen from here on out!

Looks great. But I substituted instant coffee for the dark expresso. Too much coffee flavor and not enough cream cheese or powdered sugar for my tastes. I will try it again and follow the instructions to the letter for better results.

This recipe has a great taste. I followed the recipe exactly. My only complaint is it was a little thin and somewhat ran off the cake even though they were cool.  In addition, if you are making a two layer cake, one batch is not enough and two batches is too much.  I will just remember that for next time.  Definitely worth trying.

Didn't want to brew coffee so used instant coffee crystals and cream.   Coco powder was Hershey's special dark.  I just added xxx sugar until sweet enough to our liking. This was really good, delish in fact. Makes a box mix cake really special.

Great frosting, but almost too sweet.

Yum! Spread very nicely. Yummy. Pretty sweet but also tang from cream cheese.
