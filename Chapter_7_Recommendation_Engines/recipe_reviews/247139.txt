This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but I made it on top of the stove for a large group during a ski trip.  Everyone loved it. We topped it with Fritos, sour cream, and cheese. I let it simmer for 40 minutes after tasting instead of the recipe’s note of 18-20 minutes because the flavors needed more time to blend together.

My husband and I thought this was very good. The only changes were: I made it with turkey instead of beef. I changed most “mild” ingredients to medium or hot. Also I use my own taco seasoning 

Will definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe and we all really enjoyed it!  My 7 year old thought it was too spicy, but all-in-all it was a hit.  I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, raw chopped onions, and crushed up Doritos.  Yum!

This is a staple in our home, excellent recipe.  It is also good pressure canned in pint jars for a quick meal.  Be careful though, the spices increase when canned, although I use medium enchilada sauce usually, when canning I use mild.  Also freezes great.  It's a keeper!
