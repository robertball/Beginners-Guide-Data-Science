So bland. Needs something to zip it up. I even used “hot” salsa and it was still bland. Won’t make again

The flavor was decent.  I used regular, Goya red salsa instead of the exact salsa the recipe called for.  The texture of the overall dish was decent, but not what I've had from a couple of restaurants in the past.

I used homemade baked  flour tortillas because that's what I had.  It was good, I added black olives and a little green pepper to the oinon, and used pepper jack on top.  I will make it again, but I will use corn tortilla to get the right texture next time.

it was okay. Didn't like how you cooked the ingredients. Eggs coated things, but essentially disappeared. Would not make it again.

I made this recipe,  but I made some changes. I substituted one cup of tomato sauce for one cup of chipotle sauce. I als added some chiken broth to the salsa. My family loved it. The sauce was still spicy, but not too spicy.  The broth was absorbed by the tortilla chips and it was delicious. I will do it again.

It was pretty good.  A nice quick meal.  I used shredded mexican cheese instead.  I would make it again.

I made it as is with pretty much all ingredients except for the pinto beans and a mild salsa I had on hand. I was hesitant since it did not add salt or pepper. I also slightly beat the eggs before adding them. Raw onions at the end don't settle well on my tummy so I did not add it. To my surprise, it was was flavorful and best of all it was very fast to make! Will absolutely make it again is good any time of the day!

It would be a great base for other things. I added a can of mixed vegetables, as well as taco seasoning. Super cheap. Super easy. Prep work is important for this one. You could add all kinds of things to this. Not too bad.

I didn’t make any changer. We loved the recipe and will make it again with a milder salsa.
