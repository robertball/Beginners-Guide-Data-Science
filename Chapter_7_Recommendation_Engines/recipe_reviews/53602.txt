I wasn't going to review this recipe because I didn't follow it as the author intended, but it turned out so well I wanted to give it a 5 star review.  I was searching for something I could do with a whole batch of cookies that turned out too cake like and were just sitting in a Tupperware.  I found this recipe, and replaced the doughnuts with my cookies and it turned out great!  It tastes just like "Budin" which is a dessert made in Peru.  So try this recipe with old cake, cookies, muffins...  I'm sure it will work!

Ok so I had some left over raised doughnuts and decided to try this. I didn't have any evaporated milk so i used 1 160z can of thi coconut milk and the rest half and half. It came out beautiful. Has a taste of douhgnuts but a bit like bread pudding also. As others have said this is not the usual bread pudding but then this is not hte usual recipe for bread pudding. I would make it again, maybe trying different kinds of douhgnuts and rolls. A fun recipe to play with.

This is really good not a typical bread pudding but definatly a great way to use up doughnuts. I followed the recipe but I didnt cook it in a water bath and it came out great. Dont be afraid to try this you will be surprised.

I make this recipe every Father's Day using Krispy Kremes. I always triple this recipe so that I use a dozen doughnuts and bake for about an hour before I start to check on it. I add an additional teaspoon or so of orange extract and some shredded coconut. I place  plastic wrap directly onto (not over) the mixture before i refrigerate it. This helps keep it moist, and such that i can press the mixture down several, random times before baking it. This is wonderful served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.

Donut lovers of the world rejoice, because now we can enjoy our donuts twice!  I used 5 large glazed donuts, chocolate, maple and plain, a 9 oz bottle of starbuck's raspberry mocha with a little extra 2 percent milk in place of the evaporated milk, and lemon instead of orange zest (added after all was combined).  Used heart shaped silicone cupcake pan, got six filled to the top with a cup and a half extra, so I greased up my favorite coffee mug and poured in the extra.  Topped each cup cake with about 1 tbsp semi-sweet choc and baked off for about 50 minutes (heart shaped cupcakes) and 60ish minutes for the mug.  DELECTABLE!  Will freeze up so I can savor this great use-it-up pudding.

This was actually pretty good.  I don't care much for the "soggy" bread in bread pudding, but I didn't mind the donuts for some reason.  I used plain cake donuts, eliminated the almond extract which I did not have and I used Craisins instead of raisins.  I combined it all before I left for work and baked it when I got home.  This really would have been great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! Thanks for sharing!

This turned out incredibly tasty.  I used Krispy Kreme donuts as it was what I had.  The texture, flavor, etc. will change depending on what is used.  I did not use orange zest nor did I use the water bath and it turned out fine.  If my camera worked better, the picture would have been better.

Try dried cranberries instead of raisins for a nice holiday brunch dish; looks very festive.  Next time I make this, I'll try chocolate chips.

I liked this recipe. Definitely would not reccomend the addition of sugar if using a glazed doughnut! A nice crust on the top. I skipped the orange zest (I just am tired of it), so maybe it could have been even better. I  just prefer the traditional bread pudding. Very creative.

Jelly donuts work GREAT! I had raspberry and grape jelly donuts left over (!) from a Dead Elvis party in August. I froze them and made this recipe for Christmas Brunch. Snip the donuts into quarters when they're still half frozen for best results. I used a little more nutmeg and no orange zest. Elvis would approve!

My Husband and I loved this.  I didn't find it too dry, although I did add a bit of milk.  I also used more donuts that what was called for.  I would defintely make this again...

I've waited several months to make this because I wanted to serve it for Christmas, and it definitely met my expectations.  I bought a dozen Krispie Kreme glazed doughnuts, which is the best of the best in my opinion.  I used all 12, so I tripled the recipe, which was perfect for a 9x13in baking dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, omitting the optional sugar because I didn't think it was necessary, and it was wonderful.  It actually wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be.  It cooked beautifully, and the appearance was quite attractive as well.  I usually add a glaze to bread puddings, but I didn't for this recipe, and I don't think it needed it.  However, if you want to, I think it would be good too.  Great recipe!  I may have to always use doughnuts from now on. :)

My husband loves sweets, especially doughouts so I gave it a try.  It was very sweet, but very tasty and not wet like most bread pudding are.  Very good.

My husband loves to hit the discount bakery rack at Meijer but he often buys too much to eat before it's inedible. I used 2 nutty doughnuts and 2 cinnamon rolls. It was absolutely delicious. I didn't add orange because I didn't have any. I also didn't do the water bath, I just baked it covered for about 75% of the time. I can't wait to get old doughnuts again. It was so moist and delicious! What a cheap, easy dessert with minimal prep! So good with coffee!

I made this yummy bread pudding with glazed blueberry cake doughnuts and it was great tasting! I didn't add the sugar, as they were sweet enough.  I used the warm vanilla sauce from the Rum Raisin Bread Pudding recipe to pour over it and everyone loved it!

I made this from leftover donuts at my work for my husband to take to his work.  The custard was really easy to put together.  I did put it in the water bath and it took longer than 45 minutes bake.  I omitted the raisins since we didn't have any.  One of my husband's coworkers said it wasn't sweet enough for him.

We used sugared donuts which might explain why we thought it wasn't sweet enough.  I added a melted butter/powdered sugar glaze to the top which made it much tastier.

This was great. I used leftover original Krispy Kreme donuts and peeled and chopped Granny Smith Apples in place of the raisins. It's not your typical bread pudding but it's wonderful to try something different. I think I might like to try it with vanilla ice cream or some kind of hard sauce over the top if I make this again.

I had some glazed doughnuts that went stale and looked online to find what I could use them for rather than throw them in the garbage. After finding this recipe I realized I had twice as many doughnuts and only one can of evaporated milk so I just doubled everything and added half of a salted caramel latte.  I also under cooked it about 10 mins since I like bread pudding on the soft side. Thank for posting the recipe, it turned out really well!

It was delicious. The texture was spongy but moist like baked custard. I did the 2 T. sugar, but it wasn’t sweet enough to me for a dessert, so I drizzled a simple glaze over it, which was nice since it reflects the glazed donuts within. If I were to make it again without any glaze, I’d do at least 1/4 C. sugar and also a pinch of salt to really pop the flavors.

This is my first review ever, and such a wonderful recipe  to write about! This is the best 'bread pudding' I've ever tasted! 
In fact, I'm making it right now for a friends birthday tomorrow as that's what she requested for her cake. 
I change it up each time I make it, at times using various coffee creamer flavours as my liquid. It turns out every time! As well as the way the recipe is written
It's almost impossible to ruin this dish so try various things to make it yours. 
Jacque~

I used about 10 left over Krispy Kreme donuts. Didn't have evaporated can milk; used cream instead and added more sugar - about 1/4 cup. Placed it in a square baking dish and it was delicious!! Crunchy on the outside; moist and flavorful on the inside.

Fantastic idea for leftover/day-old doughnuts! I made this recipe almost exactly before I even searched the site for it. I had 3 left over doughnuts and 5 eggs that were left over from a dozen that had accidentally frozen. I whipped it all up with some milk, almond and vanilla extract. One step I added instead of just raisins, I sprinkled raisin bran over the top and baked. The whole family loved it!

I didn't use dried fruit, almond extract or 2 T sugar.  Didn't use hot water bath.  Doubled the recipe and made a powdered sugar glaze to dizzle over the top after baking.  This is soooo good!  A great way to use up leftover doughnuts or the ones that are a day old at the store and on sale.  Everyone always wants the recipe to this!!

This was very good, and a great use for stale doughnuts. I did use 2% milk since I didn't have evaporated on hand, and I left out the orange zest as well. I used dried cranberries, and threw some chopped apples in also. Delicious, I'm bummed that I don't have any left.

I was not impressed, although I love KC glazed doughnuts, and I expected to be blown away. It is pretty,  I found it weak on flavor, not quite sweet enough, the texture was spongey, and there was a clear bit of fluid even though I followed the recipe precisely. We are eating it, but it is more "for nourishment".

This was so easy and turned out great.  I had never had bread pudding so when I served it I didn't have a "sauce" with it.  Since it was a little dry alone I scooped everyone some vanilla icecream to go along with it and it turned out much better.

I used some mini cake donuts from the carnival, didn't add any sugar as they are sweet enough, but followed the rest of the recipe..  It was great, (I'm Keto!) I only tasted it but the family liked it

Great recipe.  I've made this several times for a homeless dinner, using up leftover donuts from church.  It tastes great and is always gone at the end of the evening.

This isn't a regular bread pudding , but it's very tasty. I also added nuts and little more orange zest also  some of the orange juice ( about a tablespoon) . It freezes very well . We like it with no sauce , this is a great recipe to play with, to make it your own. Happy Cooking everyone.

I actually used six donuts, no orange zest, no raisins but added chopped nuts. I used the water bath and it ended up having to be baked about an hour. One family member said way too sweet, the other has eaten half of it in one day!!  It was a fun recipe. Easy. Creative. Kinda Paula deen

I grew up with bread pudding made with fruit and nuts by my mom.
So now I made a few tweaks for my chocolate and cinnamon roll living sons.
Used coconut oil spray for my pan, tore up stale old Krispy Kreme glazed donuts, topped with white chocolate and dark chocolate chips, and used cinnamon (no nutmeg) and vanilla and imitation butter flavoring. (No almond or citrus rind). I did bake it in the water bath and this is a doubled recipe, so in a pyrex 9x13 glass baking dish.
It soaked for 25 minutes on my counter before baking for 1 hour at 350.
Topped each serving with whipped cream - and now a new generation knows and loves bread pudding!

It was good, but just didn't really impress me. It's not that it didn't taste good, it just wasn't anything special. It needs *something*, I just haven't figured out what that is.

Used day old donuts and it was really yummy. 
Sweet enough so you don't have to add extra sugar.

This wasn't bad but a waste of perfectly good stale donuts.  To freshen up stale donuts, zap them for 10 seconds on high.

Amazing Bread Pudding recipe.  I am not a huge fan of bread pudding but this is good!
