My first review didn't show up, so here it goes again!
I found almost the exact same recipe for this but it was made into pancakes! I loved it! It had double the amount of milk and I used honey instead of sugar. I mixed all the ingredients together and cooked it on a griddle, just like pancakes...also called 'Johnny Cakes'... I served it with a fried egg ontop and sprinkled it with bacon salt and green onions, as you can see in my photo! We loved it!

My husband fondly talks about his grandmother making johnny cakes so my children and I surprised him and served them along side of a hearty chili for dinner. The cakes were so tasty. I used 1 TSP of honey instead of sugar like someone else suggested. I also used 1 cup of cold lowfat buttermilk. I just mixed everything together -- although I did whisk the egg white. I cooked them like pancakes on an electric griddle -- went very fast. The children (9 and 11) were able to turn the cakes on the griddle -- they had a blast. My husband raved about them and seemed so pleased. Thank you EDSELS1959 -- we really enjoyed this recipe. GML

Made these for breakfast. They were quite tasty. However they were very dry. We covered them in whipped cream and fried apples.
