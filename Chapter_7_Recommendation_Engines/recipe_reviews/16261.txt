Very good. I baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes and just poured the extra sauce into the baking dish with it.  Turned out very tender.

Really easy and good too! The mustard and the picante do work really well together.

Pretty good any day of the week meal. Guess the flavor depends on your picante sauce of choice. I did get an early start & marinated the chicken about 1.5 hrs. Didn't like the idea of using the marinade as a sauce, so I skipped that part. Nice flavor, don't overcook the chicken.

I made as written and this was very tangy and tasty. The mustard was more dominate than the Picante for sure. The finished dish looked nothing like I imagined it would. The oil made the mustard and picante kind of separate and curd up but it still tasted really good.

Loved the flavor!  I marinated for several hours because it was convenient to put in the refrigerator early in the day.  I browned the chicken and then baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  I would prefer to mix more of the picante sauce and mustard to put a spoon full on the top of each piece of chicken before baking.  Came out very tender and tasted great.

This dish was great. My boyfriend doubled the sauce recipe (we used hot picante for an extra kick) but kept the dijon mustard at 1/4 cup. It just looked like way too much mustard for the recipe and would over power the salsa. Such a good and easy meal.

I made this recipe with jalape√±o mustard because we were out of dijon, and it came out terrific. It was quick enough and easy to make, a good thing having a newborn. (and not a lot of time) Will make again!

I really liked this.  I used only 4 chicken breasts and there was just enough sauce, so if I had used six I would have upped the sauce ingredients a bit.  Next time I'm going to use less lemon juice, it had a bit of a bite and I wanted more of the picante flavor.  I served with Mexican rice and a side of green beans and it was a great meal-- and quick, too...

This was great! I served it with 4 cheese rice-a-roni. My son and husband loved it. I think next time I will add more picante and a little less mustard. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor.. I will absolutely make this again

This chicken was incredible! My husband raved about it and is already asking when I'll make it again... even though we just had it last night. =) I substituted yellow mustard as I didn't have dijon and it came out yummy!!

I like the simplicity of this recipe.  I found it a bit bland but would punch up the flavour next time with dried peppers and a bit more Dijon.  Thickening the sauce before the final step would help it to adhere to the chicken.

My family loved this recipe! Just enought kick to taste great without it being too spicy (I used a mild salsa as we don't like too much spice.)I also added some cilantro and it was great. Served it with Quinoa, which kept the feel very light, and a blend of fresh cooked brocholli and carrots for added color and texture.

This was a perfect marinade, using things I had on hond. We marinated for 30-45 minutes, then grilled 3 large chicken breasts. I had to add a bit more of the picante and the mustard to have enough, but the chicken was GREAT! And it went great with the ranch dressing I dipped it in.

I just had it for dinner, good but a little too salty for my taste.  Keep this in mind when preparing and enjoy.
