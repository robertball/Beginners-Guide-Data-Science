custard style bread pudding. Not bad. BUT there are less complicated ways to make bread pudding and there are other versions. AND i don't particularily like the "hard sauce" Its very nutmeggy.... the overall bread pudding wasn't very sweet either.. If you dont already LOVE bread pudding I wouldn't suggest it

I guess this is an attempt at 'bread and butter' pudding that you might find in a British pub and the the sauce is not hard sauce.

It's OK I guess, but I'll go back to other recipes both for bread pudding and for bread and butter pudding - plus my hard sauce will always include irish whiskey (rum works well too if you like)

Used substitutions still tasted fine.
