This sandwich was really hard to eat and prepare. The taste is really great but needs to be served on special occasions only. Make sure to flatten your burgers when preparing or they will be too small for the slices of focaccia bread. If you were to make this more often, it might be better just to use a different type of bread.

I have never thought of turning Italian sausage into Burgers! But I did last night! I thought baby broccoli would give the dish a nice little kick and I was Right! The peppers were just perfect for prettying up the plate. Oh and I didn't bother with the wine, I don't drink it and it wasn't missed.

My family really enjoyed this sandwich for dinner.  The White Zinfandel wine added a nice flavor to the saut√©ed vegetables.  I admit to not using focaccia bread as I had a package of hamburger buns that needed used up.  I served this with potato salad and corn on the cob.  This was a great meal that we enjoyed outside on the patio.
