My Husband only verbally comments on a new recipe that I make him only if it is especially good, his exact words were "You can make this again!" I served the meat/shrimp mixture 'atop' the grits instead of mixed 'into' them. They looked more appetizing that way & more interesting to eat because of the different layers/textures. PLEASE NOTE: {Although I made this 'close to' as was written I made the following adjustments} I doubled the amount of Hatfield kielbasa & Shrimp called for in the recipe & I'm glad I did, this way the proportions of grits to meat ratio was perfect IMO.  Instead I used only 1 Tablespoon of the Red Pepper flakes & only one 'sprig' of Rosemary. Instead of adding all of the Hot pepper, rosemary & garlic solely to only just the meat/shrimp mixture as the recipe had instructed, instead  I 'divided' those three things equally between the grits & the meat mixture to flavor both of them {first slightly sauteing half the garlic before adding it to the grits.} This gave the grits so much more flavor. This recipe is a winner & keeper. *TIP: As leftovers this also made a great breakfast when served as a side with two sunny side up eggs & a glass of OJ.

I thought this was a great recipe - not complicated, but tasty. I added some chopped chard at the same time as the shrimp to give it a little health kick; the texture and flavor were perfect. The only other change I would make would be to serve the shrimp and sausage mixture over the polenta and not try to mix it all together.

I made this recipe this morning with an Al Fresco breakfast sausage patty (chopped into small pieces) instead of the shrimp and kielbasa and it was delicious! I used the liquid form Better than Bouillon chicken base (with just a little bit of oil & NO salt!) to cook the grits, and saut√©ed the sausage and garlic with shallots and fresh chopped parsley. No rosemary, but I added my own special blend of warming spices (which is a concoction of almost equal parts garlic powder, ginger, turmeric, curry, cumin, cinnamon, fine-grained sea salt, and white pepper- I use this seasoning on just about everything I cook because I love all of the flavors??).  The only reason I gave this a rating of four stars instead of five was because I altered it so much, but I'm sure it would

Awesome flavor!  Tweaked it slightly for the kidlets, 1 tbsp of hot red flakes and I skipped the rosemary.  Very filling and flavorful!

This is a great recipe, cut down on the red pepper flakes.  It was a BIG hit for our Christmas brunch.  We have made it several times and enjoy it everytime!  A keeper for sure.

Recipe itself is good.  However being a "Southerner" I know that grits and polenta are not the same.  Alber's Quick Grits are really great.  My favorite and work well with this recipe.

I had trouble with the polenta to liquid ratio as 5 cups bound up the 2 cups worth of dry polenta rather quickly and I ended up adding  2 more cups of liquid to compensate.  Everyone was a bit perplexed about the flavor of rosemary it was actually a bit off putting in contrast to the shrimp and just seemed overpoweringly out of place. The overall consensus was more liquid and skip the rosemary but all and all was warm and filling on a cold snowy day. (2 feet of snow in fact)

Cooked the polenta with salted chicken stock which caused it to be too salty (but still good). Added fennel seed and thinly chopped onions and substituted cayenne pepper for the pepper flakes and dried rosemary for the fresh. I'm assuming it was my polenta but I ended up adding about a cup more of water to the polenta because they were getting too thick before cooking all the way. I also served the saute mix over the top of the polenta.

Except for the over-salted polenta (my fault) my wife and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely make this again but without so much salt!

Yummy dish.  I made it without shrimp and it was just as tasty.  Next time I will make it with half of the rosemary and red pepper.

I added heavy cream before putting the shrimp in to make a cream sauce for it and it was awesome! I also forgot all about the cheese and didn't even miss it.

We did as suggested and cut back the pepper flakes.  I made my polenta and added the cheese to it.  My husband made the rest.  We did plate with the polenta first then topped with the sausage/shrimp mixture.  Very easy and flavorful.  Will prepare again.

Delicious! I have made it three times in two weeks. Super easy. I scaled back a bit on the red pepper flakes (using only one tsp) and it's awesome! Definitely a staple dinner at our house!

This recipe called for some changes !  I used instant grits with butter, cheddar cheese, salt & pepper mixed in with the grits with just a few sprinkles of fresh rosemary , then topped the grits with the shrimp, rosemary, 1 mined garlic clove, and 1tsp ONLY of the red pepper flakes. I also decided to use some mini pepperoni. It was nice and festive looking. Great Christmas Eve dinner. :)

Didn't mix all together. I  just put the shrimp and sausage mix over cheesy grits.  Used half the red pepper flakes and was still plenty warm. 3rd time I've made it and will continue to use this spice mixture. Love the rosemary and garlic together

This was fantastic everyone in my family loved it.   Made a couple changes,  cooked the polenta with a mix of chicken broth and water.  It was still rich and creamy since I omitted the cheese. Also I probably had my heat on a little too high didn't have much in the way of pan juices but deglaze with a half cup of chicken broth. Spooned the liquid into the grits then spooned the shrimp and sausage on top.  Delicious.

Made it as is and was delicious. Just back from Savannah Georgia and had it three times. Their variations are no kielbasa, white wine and cream, shut the front door! Bottom line I can live with it both ways! (Tubbys beat the southern lady‚Äôs place in my humble opinion).

We make shrimp & grits often. I used white grits & instead of kielbasa, I used Andouille sausage ‚Äî never tasted it before so it was a perfect chance??It‚Äôs delicious & tastes very much like kielbasa w a kick of heat ‚Äî just the right amount. Otherwise my recipe is the same. 
We DEVOURED it. Thanks for the inspiration to add sausage.

Loved it! As per other reviews, I doubled the sausage and shrimp and think that provided the perfect amount of topping. I also added a bit chicken bouillon to the polenta water, stirred in the cheese and a splash of heavy cream, then served with sausage and shrimp on top. Turned out great, easy to prepare, and very flavorful! Will definitely be making this again.

More like shrimp and polenta not grits.. from the south so there's a difference. I added spices heavy cream used chicken broth instead of water to flavor up the polenta. Kept the sausage and shrimp portion as is. That was a great topping.

It tasted really good, and I used a hot Cajun sausage. I do think it needs a little less grits. Next time I will see how it comes out with a third less of the grits.

Made this last night! Added some kale so that this wouldn‚Äôt be completely free of vegetation. I agree with other commenters that doubling the kielbasa/shrimp would have yielded a more appropriate polenta:meat ratio. Overall really good,

OMG!  This was the best shrimp and grits I have ever eaten. My husband kept repeating over and over as he gulped down large spoonfuls of the grits and shrimp marveling how great is tastes. I made just a slight change in the grits. Instead of using sharp cheddar cheese I used marcophone cheese. It gave the grits along with the milk a wonderfully silky texture. I will defenitly make this my go to recipe for shrimp and grits. Next time I might add some bacon to the gravy.

2 of tablespoons red pepper flakes was waaaaaaay to much.  It was so spicy we could barley swallow it! But, everything else was perfect.  I will tweak it and make it my own.

Our family loves Emeril's shrimp Creole.    This is our new favorite.     Added only Frank's hot sauce to top it off.     I'm 52 and have never tried polenta grits.....love them.    The creamier the better. 

Thank you 
Nathan

i made this recipe as written and it is great if you like things on the spicy side, as i do. those who like a little less heat may want to cut down on the crushed red pepper.

We really enjoyed this.  I had to make a few small changes however...and they were...I used  3 cups of chicken bone broth and 2 cups water....and only added 1 tbsp of rosemary because I like to err on the side of less is more and see how it goes.  Then I only added a few shakes of the red pepper because I was also serving my kids...but my husband went thru the roof over this.  "You HAVE to put this HIGH in the rotation."  I served it with a side of flashed kale with oo, salt and lemon.    We truly thought it was great.  : )  Thanks!

Loved it!  didn't have fresh rosemary, so had to used crushed.  Also, couldn't find polenta at my store, so used grits.  It turned out great, good comfort food.  Adjust heat to your liking.

Maybe half the red pepper flakes, but this was awesome.
