VERY TASTY!  I made a graham cracker crust using 2 cups of crumbs, 3 Tbsp sugar and 8 Tbsp butter for a 9 x 13 pan.  Baked it for 20 minutes at 325 before adding the brownie mix.  The sugar gave it a kind of caramel flavor.  (so good!)  My marshmallows didn't brown but it still tasted great!  I also omitted the peanuts.  I sprayed a butter knife with cooking spray to making cutting these easier.  Will definitely make these again!  A family favorite!

Yummy!  It probably wasn't a good idea to make a whole pan of this when it's just me and my husband eating it, oh well.  At first I only had the large marshmallows and thought I could just cut them up - wrong!  They were so sticky I couldn't get them off my fingers!  I gave up after 10 minutes which by that time only yielded about 1/4 C and ran to the store with 15 minutes left on the brownies.  I used more the the 2 C it recommended and after having the pan back in the oven for about 3 minutes I was getting discouraged that my marshmallows weren't going to brown so I broiled it and it worked perfectly; just watch closely.

These S'mores Bars really do resemble that campfire toasted S'mores!  I was surprised actually.  I do think it's important to really spray the pan before putting in the graham crackers... I sprayed my pan like I normally would and I still had some trouble getting them off the bottom of the pan, but that doesn't change the outcome!  We will be using this recipe often!

This was really good, really easy and very kid friendly.  I skipped the nuts, and increased the marshmallows.  I will definatly make this again.

Fantastic!!! I made it in a round tin and also as individual cupcakes. I took the brownies out 1 minute early and I topped it with mini marshmallows and white and chocolate chocolate chips and some graham crackers - I only returned it to the oven for 1 minute - otherwise the mini marshmallows would start to brown too much.

I made these for a birthday at work and they were a huge success.  A bit gooey but in a gooey goodness kind of way.  Instead of layering the graham crackers along the bottom of the pan, I did as others and made a graham cracker crust. And instead of using the chopped peanuts, I crumbled a few extra graham crackers and sprinkled those on top.  I'll definitely make again.

These bars are good but before you make them, know that they are really sweet. I made mine in a 8x8 pan for a thicker bar. Instead of whole graham crackers, I made a crust using 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs and 1/3 cup melted butter. As always, my brownies were underdone (someday, i hope to learn to cook a brownie correctly) but they still tasted good. Very pretty dessert.

These didn't really remind me of S'mores...more like Rocky Road with the peanuts.  That being said, I really liked the peanuts.  I wish I could give this 3.5 stars....because they were good...but definitely not "GREAT", kwim? I can't even taste the graham crackers at all...kind of a waste of 8 crackers in my opinion.  I think they need something more.  Thanks for the recipe, I love trying new ones...I probably won't make these again though.

Yum! I didn't have any peanuts on hand so I used peanut butter chips on the top along with the chocolate chips.  The brownie center is amazing and I was surprised to find the grahams on the bottom still intact and delicious even after baking underneath the brownie batter.  I turned on the broiler for just a minute or two after the 5 minutes with the marshmallows to give them that nice, roasted color and flavor.

My expectations were way higher for these than what the results were. They werent that great actually.  The top was just sticky and kinda hard, Really hard to get outta the pan from the sides, and I greased well.  I think that with the crunch from the bottom with the graham crackers and the sticky "hardish" top from the marshmellows didnt work well.  It was just not as fun to eat as watching them cook.  But i might mess around with it a little.

This recipe is gorgeous.  On the advice of other reviewers I made the graham crackers into a crust with butter and that worked great.  Also, I didn't have chocolate chips so I just spread some hot fudge over the brownie and then added the marshmallows and cooked it for five minutes and then broiled it for two.   Very delicious but very rich.  I sprayed a normal amount of pam on my glass pie pan and had no problem getting it out.

Pretty good.  Definitely easy. Would make again for the kids but they were only somewhat impressed with them.  Next time I would just broil the marshmallows as baking them made them too chewy.  Perhaps even another layer of the graham crackers on top of the brownie mixture - then the marshmallow and chocolate chips.  If I make again I will try that.....

Made without the peanuts and I didn't have the grahm crackers, but it turned out amazing. Everyone raved! Used mini mallows and added the toppings the last 6 minutes of baking. I will definitely be adding the grahms next time. Thanks for the awesome recipe idea!

I'm not what went wrong, but the graham crackers came out soggy. It ended up being a complete mess and I had to throw it out. I would like to think i'm a pretty good baker, but this one is definitely a baking tragedy for me.

Yummy, but I made some changes.  More like rocky road.  I did not have graham crackers, so I skipped them.  I used 3/4 cup peanut chips and 3/4 cup choc chips, because that is what I had...my son loved them.

I am giving these a three, but I think it is my fault. I believe I melted the marshmallow too much waiting for it to brown. On the middle ones the layer of marshmallow seperated from the brownie layer. Also, some of the brownie mix "leaked" under the graham crackers so that gave it a little over done flavor. I will maybe try making these again to see if I get better results.

Not good. My daughter who loves all the ingredients wouldn't even finish one of these. Made for a teacher appreciation luncheon. Wish I had time to make something else but didn't. Embarrassed to have to drop these off at the school. Don't waste your time or ingredients making these because you'll end up with a below average dessert and a pan that's very hard to clean - even with tons of Pam spray used.

Good, but not great - I just threw away about 1/4 of a pan. These aren't really bars, since the brownie part is too gooey. Just not too impressive overall.

Love this recipe! I made a graham cracker crust as suggested by others and followed the recipe otherwise (omitting the peanuts). I broiled briefly to brown the marshmallows and give it that campfire kind of taste.  The brownie part didn't get completely done in the middle so we couldn't have eaten them by hand but who cares....use a fork it's delicious! Will bake it longer the next time

very rich and sweet. the kids loved it, but i got a headache. easy to make and it looked wonderful. i had to turn the oven to "broil" to get the marshmellows to brown. only took a few minutes. I let it cool for about 10 minutes before cutting. make sure you have plenty of milk to go along with this :)

I don't know if it was a problem with the brownie mix or with the oven, but I gotta say I was a little underwhelmed. Parts of my brownies were slightly underdone and gooey, and some parts of them were really fluffy and cakelike. But neither of them actually tasted that fabulous with this recipe. I'll probably try it one more time, though. The idea is really neat!

A great, quick recipe!  I used salted cocktail peanuts and the tiny bit of salt balanced the dish perfectly!  I also used 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup regular - just to add some extra flavor!

These were sooo yummy! Easy way to dress up brownies, and very quick to make. Will definitely make these again.  Good with or without the peanuts (used unsalted dry roasted peanuts). Did not use quite as many chocolate chips as called for, just eyeballed the amount.

I followed the recipe except I had no chocolate chips, so I had to use the butterscotch ones I had on hand. I crushed up the graham crackers and mixed with melted butter for the bottom. Very good recipe!

I made these bars for a party we had with a bonfire - they were okay - no one was really that excited about them.  They are very easy to make - and maybe more kid appropriate.

Oh man, these were really good!  I made them exactly as stated except without the nuts due to allergies.  That layer of graham cracker and the marshmallow on top really did make these brownies taste like smores!  They were a little tricky to cut as the marshmallows wanted to stick to the knife, but who cares - they were yummy!

This was really good! I love marshmallows & the s'mores version of brownies gives me that. I used walnuts in mine instead of peanuts. This recipe didn't stand out in a major way but still, very tasty. I later ate it with ice cream & that was fabulous :)

DELICIOUS!
I made a graham cracker crust using 2 cups of crumbs, 3 Tbsp sugar and 8 Tbsp butter for a 9 x 13 pan. Baked it for 20 minutes at 325 before adding the brownie mix.
I also used a chocolate chip cookie brownie mix and added chocolate chunks (instead of chips) to the top and omitted the peanuts.

One of our favorites.  The hardest thing about this recipe is not consuming the entire pan.  The only very minor change I made was to broil the marshmallows for about 2 minutes before taking them out of the oven.  This gave the top the true s'mores  look with the slightly browned marshmallow.  After cooling for a very long time, these weren't difficult to cut or remove from the pan, and they were a huge hit with the family!

Loved it. I took babyblue's advice to turn out a graham cracker crust rather than using the whole graham crackers, and it was fantastic. I left out the peanuts (though I think it would have been interesting to crumble some graham cracker on top too? May try that next time). My marshallows puffed but didn't brown, SO, I put them under the broiler for a little bit, and voila! Toasted marshmallows. Made for a beautiful presentation, just don't overdo it, lol. I remembered to spray the pan more than I normally would have, and was concerned I still might have trouble getting the bars out. Nope - they came out of the pan so simply. I get all the taste of a true smore out of this, and the extra chocolate from the chips gives it a good boost. Will make again, definitely.

It sounded really good, however, I don't know if it was the brownie mix or what, but they were dry and the marshamallows were sticky. I made them/cut them into squares to serve same day and they really didn't work well for me.

My 6 year old son loved these.  I made them as directed, except I used walnuts instead of peanuts (that's all I had on hand).  I agree with other reviewers who suggest that a graham cracker crumb/butter crust would be better.

Now, I don't really like chocolate, so that's a bad place to start.  Still, this was actually sort of tasty.  For chocolate.  It doesn't keep too well, though, so if you're only cooking for two people, do cupcakes or something, not a whole tin!

Mmmmm...this is wonderful. I, like other reviewers, used crushed graham crackers + butter and applesauce (which worked rather well, to my surprise!) rather than whole ones. I used around 2 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, and it was the perfect amount - the crust wasn't too thick, or too thin. I made one other change, and that was omitting the peanuts. This recipe has been in my recipe box forever, and I'm glad I finally decided to make it.

I also left out the peanuts, and used crushed graham cracker as a base.  Sadly I went a little overboard with the marshmallows so it got a little too gooey, but still tasted GREAT.

This was really good, but when we tried to cut it the next day it was really really hard because of the marshmallows. Once we got it out, we microwaved the pieces for about 15 seconds and enjoyed with milk. Delicious!

i thought these were not bad. my kids had a lot of fun helping me make it, which was the prime objective. personally i thought it just kind of ruined a nice brownie. the graham crackers on bottom were pretty dry, probably would have been better using graham cracker crumbs/butter. the marshmallows also made it next to impossible to cut them into bars. probably won't bother with it again.

I read the reviews, so I cut the bars into large squares when warm. When the bars were completely cooled, I cut them into 1 1/4" squares with a knife dipped in HOT water. I cleaned the knife between each cut. The bars were pretty as well as tasty. I made them for a teacher appreciation event and made sure to note that they contain peanuts.

These were quick and easy! They were a big hit with some kids that we served them to and didn't really last all that long once we brought them home. Eat them when they are warm - gooey things are always better!

These were good but the graham crackers burned a little and it was very chewy and a mess to cut and eat. I'll just have a smore next time.

My family loved these. It's a fun recipe that you can add or subtract things for for variety. Will definately be making these again.

These were okay but I'd almost rather just have the brownies.  This would be fun for kids though.

These were yummy.  I took it to a recipe club and everyone loved it.  I think they were better the next day and completely cooled than right out of the oven.

I thought these were pretty good. In my opinion, they were a bit much. I followed the recipe exact except left out the peanuts. I gave them a 5 because I brought them to work and they LOVED them!

Really nice recipe. I used the Chocolate Crinkle recipe from this site instead of a brownie mix. Turned out really nice. Hard to cut it cleanly though. What I did is I turned it over the cutting board and cut it starting at the bottom.

We really looked forward to making these.  We just didn't really care for them.  We ate them, but wouldn't make them again.  Thanks anyway - everyone else seems to love them!

These brownies are amazing! I took them to a cookout and they were a huge hit. I used two boxes of organic brownie mix and had to cook them a little longer, but they turned out gooey and perfect. Also, I left out the peanuts as a personal preference, but the chocolate chips on top gave it the perfect crunch. I highly recommend these!

Made this as a birthday treat for work.  Delicious!  Everyone raved about how they taste just like the real thing.
