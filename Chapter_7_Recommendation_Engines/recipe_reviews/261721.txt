This was awesome! Here are some changes I made: I used low sodium chicken broth instead of plain water, and cut out the added salt. I subbed another cup of broccoli florets in the final 5 minutes of simmering, instead of the lentils. I didn't use celery, either. I sauteed the onion and garlic in 1T of OO before adding everything else. The coconut milk really adds a nice smoothness to this soup. I try and make a different soup every week during the winter, and this one is already one of my favorites!

Loved this.. just had the last bit of this for dinner. My only change was the barley.. mine was not the quick cooking kind so I just made it separately and added a scoop.  Will make this again.. the coconut milk in this is delicious
