This recipe would have gotten a much higher rating from me if it was accurate.  It is clear, however, from the amount of flour, that it is not.  One cup is barely enough to turn the one and a half eggs into a batter, much less a dough.  I actually believe that this must be a typo, and that you need to use 2 cups.  After adding an extra cup of flour, this recipe became a kneadable dough, and came out exactly as I would expect biscotti to come out, as a firm, dense cookie, and not-too-sweet taste.  If I could, I'd mark four stars for taste, one star for inaccuracy.

delicious biscotti! after reading all the reviews, i modified the recipe slightly.  i added ~1/2 C more flour, a little more sugar and baking powder, 1 t orange extract,  and 2 T oil.  it was so easy to make- i can't wait to make it again!  next time though, i'd make them a little smaller, so we get more cookies.

Outstanding Biscotti, Peg! The orange/chocolate combination makes a party for your tastebuds! I love this recipe. I didn't change a thing, followed your instructions to the letter and came out with perfect tasting and perfect looking cookies.

The dough was way too wet to handle but I molded it into a log and baked it anyway. It turned out great! Next time I will add just a bit more orange zest. My fussy father couldn't get enough.

Not bad.  Though, a warning: if you're planning on doubling (or tripling) this recipe, you'll need to add more flour -- until the dough becomes easy to handle.  I didn't have almonds, used white chocolate chunks.  Very orange-y.

everytime I make these, They turn out wonderfully! Don't over back the log in the oven for too long, or I find it will crumble easily when cut into pieces.

But the taste is amazing. Instead of dipping one whole side in chocolate, I have dipped an end in chocolate too (so that when dunked in coffee or hot chocolate) it tastes wonderful!!! I  have also drizzled the chocolate over one side to give it a "professional" look like the ones in the stores.

Everytime I make these they go fast. They're perfect for bake sales, cookie exchanges, or just to have around the house with your cup-o-jo!

I was very pleased with these and they got good reviews from my friends. I did add 1/2 tsp of orange extract because I wanted to make sure you could taste the orange flavor, and it seemed just right. I also rolled them in sliced almonds after dipping them in chocolate for decoration.

Thanks for this great recipe.  We like it best plain with just almonds and 1 tsp vanilla.  The other change I made to the recipe is 1/2 tsp baking powder and no baking soda and it has a way better flavour.  I also cut it thinner, about 1/2 inch slices on the diagonal. It lasts really well - I've even mailed it to my son in Serbia.  He calls it "Mum's world famous biscotti."

These are so fragrant and delicious! They have become my most popular hostess gift/tea party contribution. A perfect match for a steaming cup of Original Good Earth tea on a chilly afternoon. I have added the zest of one lemon in place of some of the orange zest to give the flavor a little twist. A nice variation.

Although I haven't tried these biscotti myself (I haven't gotten any away from my husband), my husband and all of our friends rave about them and have asked for the recipes.  I think these are really simple to make and I just buy the chocolate dipping mix from the baking aisle.  Makes it really easy.

I made one batch using a mixer and it required about 1/2 cup more flour. Then I mixed one by hand, and 1 cup of flour was enough. I think that might explain why some people think the recipe is perfect and others have problems.

One batch with cranberries and white chocolate, one batch as written: the perfect gift for my mother-in-law. Thanks!

Ok, I added 1/2 cup of flour, just because it was SO SO wet and impossible to handle, and a little more orange zest, and it was amazing!!! My mom had it with her coffee this morning, and though she usually hates eating anything in the morning, she was crazy over this! She said it was seriously the best biscotti she ever tasted!

I was so excited to make this and was VERY disappointed at the outcome! I have made many kinds of biscotti before and never have any come out bad until these. First of all, only 10 were made from the little amount of dough.  Second, they were like rocks and had hardly any flavor after I spent so much time baking them. I threw them out I was so frustrated and no one wanted to eat them.

Perfect Biscotti! Just the right amount of sweet.  I baked them for less time, did not add more flour even though the dough was moist and used the rind of 2 oranges. They paired perfectly with Ginger Peach tea.

The dough was not at all doughy, more sticky and pasty, very difficult to work with!  Trying to roll it out was a losing proposition!  I ended up just blobbing it on the cookie sheet and using a rubber spatula sprayed with Pam to put it into some kind of loaf-like shape.
That having been said, it made some super-tasty biscotti! Worth making if you can handle the ooey gooey mess!

As I put this together, I could see there was definitly something wrong with the quantity of flour. There is no way this will produce a smooth ball of dough as written. More flour is definitly needed.

Perfect combo of flavors!
One of my personal favorites.
(warning if you are going to add the rind of one whole orange bake for longer)

This is very good.  I made a double batch and it's almost all gone now.  I especially like the chopped almond inside, and the orange flavor was enough IMHO.  I think I would leave the biscottis in the oven overnight next time to make them more crispy before dipping into the chocolate.

Quantities are too small, and I realized I was to get just a handful of biscotti after   I started! I suggest doubling quantities (at least!).

I did not actually eat this biscotti, so I can only rate on the actual making of the recipe, which went very well.  Everything turned out just as biscotti should, and the dipping in the chocolate was easy and pretty.

WONDERFULL biscotti. the texture was just right and had a light delicate flavor. the only thing i would say would be that dipping one whole side in chocolate overpowers the flavor. drizziling the chocolate complemented the flavor better and also looks better....
5 stars wonderfull recipe...

Strangely I had the opposite problem of most of the reviewers .... not enough liquid!  I added about a tablespoon of butter, and that seemed to help smooth it out some.  Overall, I thought the recipe was fine.  A little salty, but otherwise no major complaints.  Just sort of a standard recipe.

Good stuff.  I added 1/2 cup more flour,ommitted the orange extract, and instead added some vanilla and almond extract.

I added kahlua, a Tablespoon of heavy cream, and a Tablespoon of instant coffee mix to the chocolate while it melted over the double broiler.

Super easy recipe and GOOD!!!

This recipe worked out great for me.  Using previous reviews, I added 1/8 tsp baking powder, 1/8 c. sugar, & 1/2 c. flour for one recipe.  I will make this again.

This didn't work for me at all, and I've made several other biscotti recipes with success. The dough was very wet and I had to add quite a bit of flour to even be able to touch it and roll it out. It didn't rise in the oven and are the skinniest biscotti I've ever seen. Taste is good but needs more orange. A disappointment.

This was fantastic, I have made this many times.   Biscotti is supposed to be hard, its made to dip into hot drinks.    If you are looking for a cookie to eat without dunking into tea or coffee you will be disappointed with biscotti.

This is the first time I made biscotti. The dough is a bit wet and messy to deal with but baked nicely. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out rock hard. You had to absolutely dip it in your coffee to soften it up. I will make this again but I either wont double bake it or I will really cut back on the second bake time.

Really simple and delicious recipe. I didn't cook them quite as long as the recipe indicated when placing them back in the oven for a second time, probably only about 10 minutes--so they wouldn't be hard as a rock. But the mix of flavors was great and I look forward to making them again.  They were definitely a hit!!

You have to know great Biscotti to appreciate this recipe.  It makes a great gift for Biscotti lovers and keeps (sealed tight) for quite a while.

Disappointed to say the least. I made this to the "T" and it was burnt tasting. I even shortend the 2nd baking time. The only thing that made it passable was that I had to dunk it in my coffee, I know its a coffee cookie, but I like "to go" breakfast cookies, and this I will most def pass on--sorry!

I baked these and they came out looking kind of funky and tasting kind of okay. I probably won't be making them again.

These were good but I didn't like the chocolate on them. Next time I'm going to take the advice of others and add vanilla and omit the chocolate.

This recipe did not turn out at all for me.  I make biscotti often and it is great, these turned out so hard you could not even bite them (not even after a very long dip in coffee).  I will not be making again.

All I have to say is WOW! I had never tried biscotti before or attempted to make it,  and I just LOVE these!! They have a delectable orange taste that blends perfectly with the chocolate. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate squares so I just melted down semi-sweet chocolate chips. Absolutely delicious, and I def. will make these again.

I opted for a couple of changes in this recipe. First, I squeezed some of the juice from the orange into the batter to enhance the orange flavor. Unfortunately, the flavor still wasn't all that noticeable, and I had to add more flour to compensate for the extra liquid. Second, I dipped the biscotti into semisweet melted chocolate chips instead of bittersweet squares. This was a decent recipe, but if I try it again I will add some orange extract or oil.

Very good, just enough orange, I thought the taste would be a little weird but they were the best I made, it needed about a cup more flour then the recipe calls for though..

I added 1/2 tsp orange extract and double dipped the bottoms in melted semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares.  I also drizzled the chocolate--thinned a little--on top of the biscottis.  Looked great!  I took them to work--Gone in minutes!  Will make again!

it's nice, but not as nice as i assumed. dough was definitely too wet with only 1 cup of flour. you want to put another cup of flour aside in case you need more, and slowly add till the consistency you are looking for. i substituted almond with walnut, it leave the biscottis a funny after taste. not sure if it's due to walnut or the baking powder. esy enough to put together though.

I particularly liked this recipe since it yielded such a small amount, perfect for a dinner party and no risk of eating all the left overs.  Very yummy.  It has inspired me to try more.  I also loved the lack of butter, making it a little bit more appearling

The dough is really a pain to work with, but it's well worth it. I baked it for a little less time than it called for (maybe 5-10 minutes less) to keep them a little less hard and they turned out perfect.

i couldn't believe i made these myself either!  never going to pay 1$ for a biscotti again!!!! these were uber delicious.  altho i did chicken out when i noted the lack of butter in this recipie, i crossreferenced with other biscotti recipies and added 1/4 cup of butter for every 2 cups of flower.  also i used 1 cup all prupose flower and 1 cup organic unbleached flower to boost nutrition.  le yum!

very tasty.  i did not make the orange zest fine enough, and so it was not as good to chew.  makes a very small 'loaf'.  next time i will double the recipe.  i used melted ghiradelli double chocolate chips to coat... yummy!

I followed the ingredients exactly, and it was easy to roll out and cut, after cooking.  I didn't bake either time, quite as long, as it was getting to be a really dark brown.

I'll definitely make again - my husband and I both liked it.

This recipe was way too wet. I had to add about 1 1/2 extra cups of flour and about 1/2 cup of extra sugar before the dough was even manageable. The biscotti tasted ok, but was rock hard.

This recipe was most excellent!  This was my first attempt at biscotti and made them for a friend.  I brought the extras to work and they quickly disappeared.  However, as I can never resist playing with a recipe, even one I've never tried, I added a few dashes of Grand Marnier.  I will definitely make this one again!

As with many other reviewers, I needed to add significantly more flour to make it manageable, ~ 1/2C extra.  Otherwise it would have been far too wet and sticky to handle.  IMO the sugar should be increased (and I don't have a sweet tooth!)  The instructions say to cool after baking, but for those who are not experienced baking biscotti, it should instruct you to cool SLIGHTLY until warm.  Otherwise it is nearly impossible to cut once fully cool.  Also, after slicing and returning to the oven, the biscotti only needs about 5 min additionals baking time (per side).  I use an oven thermometer for accuracy, so that wasn't the problem.  Even with the reduced baking time, these cookies were too hard, not crisp like good biscotti should be. I'm not going to experiment to try to correct this recipe, there are too many other promising ones on this site to try.  The most positive thing I could say is that the amount of orange zest is spot on.

The recipe doesn't have enough flour, I had to add about 1/2 cup more to get the consistency right. However, once that was done it turned out delicious, and the portion size was surprisingly accurate!

you definitely need the extra flour if not it is too sticky to work with

This recipe came out great in the end for me...
I made some changes to it as advised by other reviews

I used 2 cups of flour, added a bit more sugar and a tad touch of milk. 

Instead of using almonds, I used chopped peanuts and I must say I am please! For my first try this was a breeze! 

The recipe should have been clearer though.

I have doctored this recipe up a bit with great success. Instead of the almonds, I use chopped walnuts. Instead of orange zest, I add about a cup of sweetened, shredded coconut (half toasted, half straight from the bag), and I also add 1 1/2 teaspoons of coconut extract. I bake them exactly as the recipe describes. Then, after the cookies have cooled, I pipe a zigzag of melted white chocolate on the cut side of each cookie. They have a beautiful homemade look and taste delicious! Just sweet enough!

Great recipe except I had to add in about a cup, a cup and a half of flour because the dough was just too sticky. I think next time I'll brush some egg white on it to make the biscotti look more even instead of so grainy. Like I said, great recipe. Add in extra orange, vanilla, and cinnamon for an extra kick.

Have made this a couple of times and always works well, nice orange flavour.  I omit the chocolate topping to save on calories - how sad!

Made these cookies for Christmas and they were excellent!  My 3 year old was so proud that she helped mommy make them, she made sure everyone was given a cookie as soon as they walked thru the door.

I was a little freaked out when I noticed that this recipe didn't call for any eggs, but it turned out great!  I gave them away for gifts and everyone raved about them.

This was the first biscotti I've ever made and everyone LOVED(!!!!) it. The only trouble I had was cutting the cookies...but they ended up turning out great anyway.

This biscotti was very flavorful, but it seemed to need a little more sweetness. I'm definitely going to try it again, and see if it comes out as well with a bit more sugar.
