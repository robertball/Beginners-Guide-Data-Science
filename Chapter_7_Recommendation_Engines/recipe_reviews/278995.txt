I made the recipe almost exactly as written. My exception was in method: I used non-stick aluminum foil on the counter, instead of plastic wrap. It didn't turn out well at all. I'm getting reasonably good at making gluten-free baked goods. I'm not sure where this went wrong. The rolls are dry and crumbly and not at all tasty. Sadly, I'm still on the search for a winning recipe.

Followed the recipe.  Turned out a heavy mess.  Do not recommend.

Super easy to handle the dough.  Eaten by gluten-free snobs haha.  Highly recommend this recipe.
