We aim for low carb meals with a diabetic in the family so I used 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and didn't use any cracker crumbs. It came out great.  Obviously the recipe is changed quite a lot without adding the cracker crumbs...but the seasonings, the butter, the tenderness of the filets after about 25 minutes...these make this recipe a 5 star recipe!

I just made this recipe for the 2nd time.  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of saltines (just for convenience) and it was awesome!  My teen and toddler loved it.  I guess it would be great for any white fish!

I made this for dinner last night and it was easy to make and tasted  wonderful.  I even made some without the crackers (gluten free) for myself and it was just as good. We eat lots of fish, and I try lots of recipes.  This was our favorite.

I did a dairy free version with no cheese and coconut oil instead of butter. It turned out beautiful, dairy-free, and delicious!

This recipe plays up the already buttery flavor of the perch and gives a nice crisp coating without resorting to frying.  I made one change, using Ritz cracker crumbs instead of saltines.  I also bumped the flavor by toasting my butter.  I omitted the Parmesan since it was a component of one of the sides.  Thank you, Cindy, my family loved dinner and half of the claim the don't like fish.

So I made a variation on this quite accidentally.  First, I didn't have crackers so I used pretzels that I ground up in the food processor.  Then the mistake: I added the pretzel crumb mixture to the melted butter.  Oops.  I pressed the mixture into each piece and baked as directed.  I ended up with preztel-Parmesan crusted perch, which was delicious and a big hit with my family.

Great Recipe.  Only thing to be careful of is the time in the oven.  25 to 30 min is far to much for small perch.  I do 15-18 min.  Also Panko Breading was awesome!

I didn't need all the butter listed.  I also breaded w/ Panko crumbs and spices ahead of time and then just put in oven when ready to bake.  Crunchy! NEW NOTE: Made again but with so-so results. I melted the butter in the pan to use but I think the leftover caused the fillets to be mushy. Also only had Ritz crackers, but I don't think that affected the topping.

This is a GREAT recipe, and I have made it exactly as listed, and also have simplified it considerably by substituting crushed Olive Garden Seasoned Croutons for the spices and saltines.  I have tried it with cod, swai, tilapia and white fish, and it turned out great with all of them.
Yesterday, just before I put the dish into the oven, I put just a sprinkle of dill and Parsley on top - it turned out very good!

Melt the butter in the baking dish while pre-heating the oven and dip the fish in here before coating. It is easy and very tasty dish!

I have one who won't eat fish, so I revised the recipe as follows - instead of crackers, crunched up sour cream and onion chips and mixed with panko crumbs.  Then dipped fish in flour, egg mixed with milk (only 2 Tbsp) then coating.  Did the same for chicken strips.  I put them all on cooling racks over a rimmed baking sheet.  Cooked at 350 for 20-30 minutes.  Yum!

So simple, but so delicous. I was surprised by how flavorful the crackers got. Don't smash the crackers to small because the big chunks are really delicous!

I don't usually make Perch, so I looked for a recipe and found this.  My family and I did not like the breading.  Won't be making it again.

the recipe is a winner and have been experimenting with it for some time    As a twist for the coating try Ritz crackers at a ratio of 3 to 1 with cornmeal and using the same herbs and spices as the recipe  It is out of the park and will work with most mild fish you would pan fry

I really liked the breading on this and it browned nicely in the oven.  My perch was bony, although my husband's piece had no bones.  Will try this again with tilapia.

Delicious! All family members loved this dish. I was going to fry my Perch originally but came home from work to find that I did not have vegetable oil. Searched Allrecipes and this came up. So glad I found it. We prefer this to frying! Yum! Thank you for offering this.

I will use this recipe again as it was very good.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the breading did not stick that well to the perch.  I did use Ritz crackers and I have used them for breading in other recipes which turn out.  Will have to try a different method of breading it next time.

This was unbelievable! I used fresh basil and oregano, and baked it a bit longer. I served it on rice. I was afraid of the dish being dry with rice, but The perch was juicy enough. I can't wait to make this again!

Very easy to make, I have a gluten intolerance so I used gluten free break crumbs instead of the crackers.  Make sure you buy fish that doesnt have the skin on it, I hate removing the skin and didnt think ahead.

Used parmesano regiano and fresh oregano because it's what I had. Other than that change I followed the recipe exactly. While I will make this again I will make the following changes: 1) Use low sodium saltines and 2) Omit the salt. We found it too salty and I like salt. I'm sure the cheese change didn't help but I almost never have just parmesan. The seasoning was subtle but good. For a quick light tasting dinner this was very good.

Loved this easy and simple way to do Perch. I did use Panko crumbs instead of the cracker crumbs as we prefer those. My husband loves Perch and I love how easy this was.

Made with GF Panko, otherwise per recipe.  Will make again, but changing:

o  Used less garlic powder  than recipe but, for me, it was too much (not my wife).

o  Coating wasn't very crispy... a bit mushy in fact.  Next time, higher temp for shorter time perhaps.  Cooked fish to 145+F (flaky, tender).

Enjoyed this recipe tho all that butter!  Only change I would make is to omit the salt as the parm cheese and crackers provide enough for most.   Serve with a side salad and it's a great midweek meal.

MMM really good. I used crappie filets that I caught. The only thing I did different was I soak the filets in buttermilk- a suggestion from a fisherman friend so there was not a need to dip in the butter- but I did melt some butter and drizzled it on the filets. I will certainly use this recipe again.

There are two things I change with this recipe.  First, I use Ritz Crackers (or any butter crackers) instead of Saltines.  Secondly, I use Halibut for the fish.  My husband, who isn't a big fan of "fishy" tasting fish, loves this dish.

Super delicious! We added a dash of lemon pepper & lemon juice on each piece and that really made this dish just WOW! The saltine crackers turn out so well for the breading, such an easy recipe to do and super yummy.

I didn’t use any breading. I am on a diet and looking for low calorie options. The fish was good!

Tastes great.  I added some lemon pepper seasoning.   Next time I should grease the foil I used instead of directly in the shallow baking pan. (Or use glass).

As usual, I changed a few details of the recipe, but kept the core idea. I used Panko bread crumbs instead of crackers, fresh herbs instead of dried, & a little less butter (maybe 6 tbsp instead of 8). Otherwise, I followed recipe & baked thin filets about 15 mins. Conclusion: delicious. Fish was flaky, not overdone. Herbs & spices blended nicely, the cheese was the "secret" ingredient. I would definitely make this again. Any flaky, white fish could be used.

This was so easy to make quick meal after work.  Actually second time I made since it was so good the first time.  Didn't have saltines and used Ritz crackers, didn't have Parmesan so used Manchengo, better with the Parmesan which I used the first time.  Will be a recipe we make often.

Very nice, but I did substitute the Ritz cracker crumbs, as suggested by others.  I'd watch the time, because it's dependent upon the size of the fillets.

We did like this for something different other than just frying the fish.  But - as is it could use a few changes, not many, but a few I'm giving it 4 stars.  A 1/2 cup butter melted was too much and I could have gotten by with about 1/3 cup.  I also added about 1/4 tsp. more of each seasoning, except the salt which I used less of since the saltines were providing plenty of salt.  I will make this again when we're looking for some way to make the perch other than frying.

I made this for the first time tonight.  I paired it with rosemary potatoes and peas. It was wonderfully easy and taste amazing. Going in the recipe box for sure!

Excellent.  We used 'buttery vegetable-flavor' crackers, which probably added a flavor boost.  Only used about a 1/4C butter and the breading amount listed in the recipe was enough for 2lbs of perch fillets for us, but we didn't cake it on too thick.
