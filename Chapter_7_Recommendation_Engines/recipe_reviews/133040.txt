it turned out good but it seemed to be missing something.  My husband and I couldn't put our finger on what it needed.  I'd also add more spices since it seemed a bit weak.  Leftovers had a stronger flavor.

Love this recipe! Have made it many times and it's always a big hit. I use duck breasts and add chicken broth to the water when cooking the duck - for extra flavor since there are no bones. I put all the veggies (except okra) in my  ninja to quickly chop (more like mince). I use fresh okra and slice thin - my husband didn't like the huge chunks that come frozen. I also use a roux base called Kary's Dry Roux. Zatarins tastes fine but this brand has fewer extra unneeded ingredients. May be difficult to find depending on location! I'm way down south. I also use andouille sausage. If it doesn't have enough flavor with regular smoked sausage, try andouille - it's got more louisiana spice. Or could use some tony chacherie's spice blend - you won't need it if you use andouille. Anyhow, great recipe! Thank you for sharing!!

Good underflavor - We used wild duck, but I had a difficult time with the wild game flavor of the duck.  We grilled it beforehand, and it didn't seem as gamey the first time we ate it.  Since it was already cooked, we sauteed the onions, peppers, garlic, celery and sausage; then, added the final ingredients and cooked about 30 minutes.
