No where near enough broccoli in this soup. I cooked another 2 heads separately then put them in the food processor before adding to the original recipe. That made it better and the cheese didn't separate. I toasted the nuts as another reviewer suggested. I thought it had too nutty a flavor for my concept of broccoli/cheese soups.

This recipe was perfect for my gluten-free diet.  Instead of cashews, I added chicken.  Easy and tasty.

I followed the entire recipe except for one crucial area.  Reading the reviews a lot of users had issues with how thin the soup was.  Easily remedied this by creating a roux. I used 2 Tablespoons of flour and I reduced the butter to just 2 Tablespoons;  my search for a broccoli cheese soup has ended this will be my go to recipe from now on!

Followed recipe except I blended the broccoli in a blender.  Very thin, I even added cornstarch to try & thicken it up with no success.  Not the greatest flavor either, soy made it on the salty side, I would not make this recipe again.

I have always loved this recipe. We don't make it very much because of the fat, but we really do enjoy it. I put everything but the broccoli/butter in the processor. Seems to work better that way. But yum!

This recipe was most definately not the best thing I have tried, but it was good all the same. I am not a big fan of broccoli, and this recipe didn't help that hatred at ALL!

My husband really enjoyed this.  It is quick and unusual.  The cashews should have been toasted before grinding.  The tecture is a bit different due to the nuts but the flavor is great.  DO NOT DO IN A BLENDER IT IS TO THICK.  IT WORKS BEST IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR!
