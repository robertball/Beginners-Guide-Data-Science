You can use any canned enchilada sauce for this recipe.  I switch between the red and the green for a variation in flavors.  I also add a can of corn for an additional taste.  Definitely drop a dollop of sour cream on top on each serving.

I made this dish for my VERY picky husband and he absolutely loved it!  Since we have no children, we have leftovers, but for maybe a day after...it gets eaten up VERY fast!  Very easy to prepare and bake.  Since I work full time, I prepare this dish the night before and refigerate until ready to bake for dinner!  YUMMY!!

Being a "Trading Spaces" fan has surely rubbed off, as the whole family, in LESS than 48 hours, more like 24, totally revamped our girls bedroom. They went from ballet pink and raspberry to retro 70's, sun, moon and stars theme and half the room painted dark blue and the other half golden yellow. Needless to say, I was beat, but thank goodness, found this quick and easy recipe. The girls and I are mexican food junkies so we found this to be delish! I did add some cayenne to spice it up a bit and also added crushed nacho chips on top for a little crunch and ended with more shredded cheddar.

Everyone liked this casserole, including the kids.  I found it easy to prepare and very tasty.  I made it in a 11"x7" dish and it worked fine.  Good flavor!

This dish has become one of our favorites.  It is quick to prepare and everyone loves it.  We especially like it when we are short of time.  My kids like to top it with sour cream.

Make sure and get the enchilada sauce with the chiles and onions or else it will be somewhat bland!

Quick and easy, and good.  I halved the recipe, since it is only 2 of us, and I added some canned diced green chiles.  I used a 9x3 dish, so I layered it more, it turned out like a Mexican lasagne.  I am munching on the leftovers as I write this!

Very easy to assemble, my husband and I loved it, kids aren't to much for spicy, but for everyone else really enjoyed it.  Makes your house smell really good.

My family loves this dish.  I serve it with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, salsa, sour cream and guacamole sauce in separate dishes.  I also leave out the olives since we are not big fans.

My whole family loved this and it's become one of our weekly standby dishes.  I couldn't find the Ortega enchilada sauce so I substituted the Wal-Mart brand and also added a can of whole kernal corn which works great.  I have a large family and found that a 9x13 inch pan works perfectly when doubling the recipe.

I made this cassarole the night before I cooked it and I used deer meat instead of ground beef. Turned out great. Even great as left overs.
