I don't like sweet potatoes, but my family does and they are healthy. So I found this recipe while desperately looking for a creative way to prepare them. These are REALLY good!! I ate a whole serving of them. I can't wait to make them at Thanksgiving for our extended family. Oh, one note: this makes a HUGE batch! We used just ONE of each potato (they were large potatoes) and it made enough for 3 people. If I liked sweet potatoes more, I would probably give this five stars!!

For my husbands 50th birthday I had a small dinner party. I got this recipe here and thought they would make a pretty addition to my meal. Well, I have to say the piping was the hardest part, a bit messy. I piped them onto a lightly oiled sheet pan and they turned out wonderful. Needless to say the dinner party was a great success. The Flavor was excellent and they looked so pretty.

I also omitted the piping step and just swirled the two together kind of like marbled cake. It desperately needed salt. Even with the salt, I found it bland. i'm not sure what needs to be added to make it really good, but it needs something.

Very yummy!!!!! Family loved them and they were a great presentation. I found them to be a real pain to put in the bag but the wow factor is totally worth the trouble. Will be making these again!!

I was looking forward to this recipe. But the russet part of the potatoes was very blah and the sweet potatoes were very very sweet. And I like sweet. I tried really hard to pipe these out but they did not work for me. I had a couple of small lumps in the potatoes and it kept getting clogged. So I eventually quit trying to pipe them out and swirled the sweet potatoes with the russets in the pan. Wasn't as pretty as the pic but it worked.

We are not big sweet potato eaters but I am alway trying to find a recipe to change our minds.  These were good but my kids just said so-so.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon & sugar on top of the potatoes before cooking them in the oven, I think this helped some.

Takes a long time to make and not really worth the effort for me.
