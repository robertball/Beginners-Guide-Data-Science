Instead of fresh green chilis I used two cans. And I added some frozen corn. But it was fantastic!!! I increased the garlic a little bit too. My husband works on a oil rig so I sent it in a thremos for him to take to work, and I had wives of the other men on his crew calling asking me for the recipe!! New family favorite!!

This recipe is very, very good.  I did make a few changes used 2 cans chicken broth, added 2 cans rotel, added 4 garlic cloves, left out water, added onions, did not dredge meat and fry but used roast already cooked, used large can green chili's and small can jalapeno's.  Put it all in a slow cooker and cooked on low overnight.

I've made it twice now and it was great both times.  The first time I used fresh green chiles and the second I used canned.  It was good both times, but spicier with the fresh chiles.

I roasted a bone-in pork loin for about two hours in a clay cooker with onions and peppers, then simmered it in the broth for about two more hours until the meat fell off the bones...it was incredible!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  Read the reviews on this one and they were mixed, so I was a little hesitant.  Well, I thought this was great.  It's a great base to tweak the seasonings to your family's liking but we liked it as written.  For those who said it was too spicy ~ I don't think the recipe intends you to use jalapenos as your main chile.  We used anaheim chiles and roasted them ourselves.  You can pick up canned green chiles in the supermarket to skip that step of you wish.  The addition of some jalapeno for heat is fine, but leave it at that :).....  This also tastes great with red chiles instead of green - I have made it with New Mexico Red Chiles and it is YUM, YUM, YUM. Very authentic and tasty.  Thanks!

I made this recipe using leftover pork loin.  I followed the recipe, but used a can of chiles and added carrots for extra color.  I also added some cumin and chili powder.  It turned out full of flavor and very tasty.  The family said to make it again.  Next time I will use 2 cans of chile peppers.

this was really yummy!  i pretty much followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cutting it in half.  it was tasty as is.  however next time i think i might omit the garlic and beans (i only added a can of black since i had halved it).  i tasted it before the addition of those ingredients and the chili peppers gave it a nice kick that seemed to be overpowered by the garlic and diluted by the juice in the beans.  i will make this again for sure!

Very good stew.  I did not have black or red beans so substituted with pinto and added cilantro.  Family loved it!

A good combination of flavors, especially if you like it hot. I used leftover porkchops instead of bacon and it turned out well.

I thought this was so-so, but has the potentialto be really good.  I skipped the flouring of the pork, and used two cans of pinto beans - one drained and one not.  Some of the reviews complained about the stew being too watery, so I did not add any of the four cups of water, just the broth and the liquid from one can of beans and it still came out more like a soup than a stew.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, which went well with the other flavors.  Overall, it was a little bland.  I used very mild green chiles.  Next time, I would definitely add one or two hotter chiles, and definitely more garlic.

Would give this dish 5 stars except I made a few changes to the recipe to make it like our favorite restaurant's green chile stew.  Added carrots, left-over corn, 1 whole onion, and several handfulls of shredded cheddar cheese.  Left out all beans.  Great green chile flavor and perfect stew consistency! (You must use New-Mexican green chiles though, not jalapenos as some reviewers did to get the correct flavor and heat.)   Very easy, especially with a 7-week old consuming most of my time!  ;o)  Will make this recipe again and again!

This recipe is great but needs tweeked: Too watery! No water necessary, just used 3 cans of chicken broth, drain the beans...used pinto and black! Using green anaheim chillis, leave the seeds in for more firey taste. Its a stew! But right on on the measurements, perfect meat to potato to green chillis ratio.

Hate to be the one to bring the rating down but this didn't turn out well at all. I followed recipe exactly but the first thing that went wrong was the amount of pork in the pot - way too much to brown so I had to switch to an electric skillet to fit all the meat in. Second thing was the amount of chiles. I only used 2 fresh jalapenos and that was plenty hot - I can't even imagine 8 of them - it'd be atomic! When it was done simmering it looked like S.O.S.! Unappetizingly gray with some black beans poking through. But when I tasted it, it tasted like spicy mush. Despite it being fairly simple, I won't attempt this one again. : (

I didn't think it was going to turn out as well as it did. My family loved it. I think I might try it with rice next time.

Not sure what to say about this recipe except...blah!  Followed the recipe exactly but used canned green chili peppers, not jalapenos.  The stew was unattractive when finish and taste was flat.  Won't make this again.

This was a good stew but not as spicy as I expected.  Next time will add a couple of jalapenos or something to spice it up.

This looked like a cozy, warm dish for a winter afternoon, so I really wanted to make it. Problem was, I didn't have all of the ingredients. I compared what I had, versus what the recipe called for, and decided I had enough overlap to at least give it a shot. I used boneless country pork ribs. I didn't have green chiles, but I did have a can of salsa verde. To balance the tartness of the tomatillos I added parsnips and carrots. I used kidney beans instead of black beans and I added pepper flakes to give it a little heat, since I was missing the green chiles. I also had a chayote lying around, so I threw that in, too. It's different from the original, but very good. Definately a nice hearty one-pot dish perfect for a cold day. I'm giving it four stars, only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Next time I'm going to try to original version and maybe adapt it for the crock pot.

Big hit!!! Family loved it! I used two cans of mild diced green chilies instead of fresh. Did not add the 4 cups of water or any salt.  I suggest draining both beans because the bean juice changed the flavor too much. Fortunately I added a can of Green Chili Enchilada sauce I had on hand. Yum! Was sooooo good!!! Will be making this again and again!!!

Braized the pork, but did not flour the meat.  Increased the garlic and prepared in a crock pot (cooked on high for 2 hours before the beans were added).  I did not add any water and there was plenty of liquid for my family.  Served with corn tortillas and rice was available for those who wanted it.
Very good dish, tasty with a bit of spice.  The leftovers were even  better.

Loved this recipe. I did make a few minor adjustments.  I added rice instead of potatoes. I also added some chili powder and cumin.  I  added only one can of chopped green chiles and used one long, hot chili  with seeds and one jalapeno with seeds.  Then I added frozen corn at the end. Perfect.

Excellent recipe. Gives one plenty of room to experiment. Living in new Mexico and having Hatch and Sandia chilis in the freezer I would recommend not skimping on this key ingredient if possible. Love the beans, added a texture that many restaurants choose to leave out. Will be a go to recipe when I'm looking to feeding a large group or need to take care of extra smoked pork.

I usually have another recipe I rely on for this type of stew or soup, but I was running short on time and thought this was a better option.  I used leftover pork loin that had a black pepper crust on it, and threw that along with 2 cans of green chiles (instead of fresh) and everything else into the crock pot.  Cooked it on high for roughly 3 hours and voila!  Delicious soup with just enough kick.  I did use only 2 cans of chicken broth and added no additional salt as well.  Thanks for the recipe - I can't wait for the leftovers on this snowy day!

I made this stew yesterday and it was very good, altho next time I might pick a less spicy pepper than jalepeno.
