I did not make the salad recipe that is posted above but this is the perfect salad dressing. It's delicious on a salad of seasonal vegetables  and especially with the overabundance of blueberries this time of year.  I think I will  double up the blueberries the next time.

This was very good. My husband was surprised that he liked the dressing. It was great with spinach, arugula, strawberries, blueberries, leftover roasted chicken and feta. I also sprinkled dried cranberries and sesame seeds on top. Will make again.

The only little change is that I added chicken and chopped watermelon to it since I had both on hand.  This is absolutely going into the rotation.  Itâ€™s really good and the dressing is fabulous.

I added more honey and blueberries because it was a little too tart. I marinated chicken breast in it, then used the remainder for the dressing. My kiddos asked me to make it again the next night... it was that good.

Great summer dressing! Very versatile! I usually use white balsamic vinegar instead, omit the mustard, and use half olive oil/half water. I double the dressing recipe and store in the fridge for up to one week to use on any salad. Also, sometimes add poppyseeds.

I didn't care for this recipe. The balance of flavours was WAY off. I ended up adding about 4 times as many blueberries as the recipe calls for in order to get any blueberry flavour and in the end the overpowering flavour was still balsamic vinegar.

My husband who does not like anything but mayonnaise dressings really enjoyed this dressing.  I thought it was perfectly balanced, not too sweet or bitter, just right.  Followed the dressing instructions to the letter.  Changed the salad ingredients a bit.  No strawberries, used chopped apple.  Used less fruit and double the salad greens.  Used good quality vinegar and blue cheese.  Its a keeper.

Left out the blue cheese to balance my dinner plan, it was delicious without it.

This is a perfect salad for spring, and the dressing is a great accompaniment for the lovely fruit.  It is gently tangy, and the flavors of the honey and blueberries come through nicely without overpowering the salad components.  I made only two changes:  I did not toast the walnuts, and I used feta crumbles instead of blue cheese.  Thanks for this yummy, easy addition to our dinner table!

I made just the dressing from this recipe, after having a blueberry balsamic dressing on a salad made of spring greens and goat cheese at a restaurant in New Hampshire that was just fabulous.  They wouldn't share the recipe for the dressing with me, but I did a little internet research and came across this recipe.  With a little tweaking (I used a bit more honey to soften the bite of the balsamic vinegar), it was a dead-on duplicate of the one I had in New Hampshire.  Simply delicious -- and very easy to make.
