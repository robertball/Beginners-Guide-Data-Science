I followed the recipe exactly, even though I was dubious about the base.  The crumbs didn’t bake into a firm crust at all.  The chocolate chips weren’t fully melted.  I had to broil the top to melt the marshmallows.  It looked great out of the oven, but it was a mess to try to cut and serve.  I think it would be possible to fix the recipe, by actually baking a crust, melting the chips, then putting it under a broiler for a few minutes without the grahams on top.  I don’t know that I’ll try this again.  It’s sad to spend time and money on a disappointing recipe.
