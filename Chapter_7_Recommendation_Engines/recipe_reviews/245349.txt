2.5.16     IMO there are some problems with this recipe. Step #2 simply doesn’t make sense using biscuits.  After 8 minutes @ 350, they were not even close to being done, so the “8-minute” recipe title even is misleading.  Added another 2 minutes, still not done, so I bumped up the temperature to 375 for several more minutes.  Maybe it would be 8 minutes @ 375??  You need much more than a “pinch” of brown sugar and cinnamon, otherwise what you’ll have are flavorless cinnamon rolls that taste just like a crescent roll.  Finally, I mixed 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar (not 3/4 cup) and still had quite a bit left over after drizzling the icing.  On the positive side, they are extremely easy to make, pretty tasty, and my 3-star rating is based solely on how they ended up after the changes I made.  Really think the recipe should be revised for the benefit of anybody who’d like to make these rolls in the future.

These were very simple and tasted good, and my kids enjoyed making them with me. However, despite the low effort required to make them, I felt kind of silly buying a can of crescent rolls, which were sitting directly next to the canned cinnamon rolls. While these were good, I don’t feel they outshined the canned Pillsbury cinnamon rolls. Next time I will save myself the extra steps and just buy the canned cinnamon rolls if I want an easy breakfast. If I want more complex cinnamon rolls, I will find a recipe in which the main ingredient is not a ready-made prepackaged item.

These were very good and simple to make. I highly recommend making these. The sauce was very sweet on top so you should probably  use a little less drizzle.

The cinnamon rolls were very good and easy to make. They are good for a quick snack or a little side snack for your breakfast. We used biscuits and just flattened them and it worked just as well. Would definitely make again!
