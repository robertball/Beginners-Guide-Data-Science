Incredible! I took this dip to a "Zuccini Fest" that our church had and it was the biggest hit (I should have tripled the recipe it went so fast)!  My grandfather who won't try anything with Zucchini was forced to try it and actually kept coming back for more! I served with Wheat Thin crackers and it was YUMMY!

A very quick, attractive and tasty dip for a party.  I used low-fat cream cheese and served it with mixed veggies and bagel chips - it was a big hit!  The best part is that it only needs to chill for an hour - other dips require longer chill times.

Good idea just very bland to us.  After tasting it I added about 1/4 cup of sour cream and a package of Zesty Italian Dressing mix.

I doubled this recipe and made this dip with ultra low fat cream cheese and added some garlic for a little bit more flavour, I took it to a pool party and everyone thought it was really great!  I think it's really important to use frresh chives too.  If you're following a Weight Watchers diet  plan 5 cups of this dip is only 10 points when using ultra low fat cream cheese!!

Found this very bland ... pretty, but bland!  I added garlic salt and it was better but don't think I'll make again.

Ooolala!!  One of the best dips I've ever tasted!  And so creamy!  We ate it with Wheat Thins and couldn't stop!  I broke down and bought fresh chives - very glad I did!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a real snap to make...I loovee zucchini but don't eat cream cheese, and my problem with this recipe was that I could taste the cream cheese.  Seems like a no brainer, but i had hoped maybe it'd just be a base and not so prominent.  All the cream cheese eaters devoured this though- thanks! :)

this was so easy......i tweaked it a bit by using lowfat neufatchel cheese, added about 1/3 c of greek yogurt while beating.   I also added about a tablespoon of dried pico de gallo seasoning...big hit with crackers.  def a keeper for summer parties.

I thought this was really tasty. I agree with other reviewers that the fresh chives are key to success. I thought this tasted like french onion chip dip. People seemed a little scared of it at the potluck I brought it to though.

This was a hit at a bridal shower I recently gave.  I did add more salt and chives than the recipe prescribed for flavor, however.  Very good!

I didn't like the stringy-ness of the zucchini in the dip.   Wasn't impressed with the chives in terms of adding flavor.

i wanted to make this dish a bit healthier so i used only half the amount of cream cheese , omitted the milk and added in 1 cup of plain greek yogurt. This worked really well to loosen up the dip a bit, and you still got that creamy texture. After tasting it was indeed on the bland side, so i added more chives, salt, 1 garlic clove minced and the zest of half a lemon for some brightness. Overall after the extra flavor it was good. Im not sure i would have enjoyed it as much without some more seasonings.
