Great lime flavor.  Don't marinate too long though or the acid will cook the shrimp.

These were okay, how bad can grilled shrimp be?  I only marinated them about 1/2 an hour, as the citrus will start to "cook" the shrimp.  The flavors were not as intense as I expected and I even grated some lime zest into the mixture.  I prefer the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp on this site and will use that, substituting limes when I have them.

This was good, but a little too much lime flavor for us.  I will try again and cut down on the lime and add more garlic and maybe some soy sauce.
