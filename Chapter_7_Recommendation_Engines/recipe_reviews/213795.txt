This is absolutely amazing. I already have to make another batch. I made two changes: I used vegetable oil instead of butter spread, and added a tablespoon on cocoa powder for a little more chocolate. But I repeat, this is an amazing recipe.

Very good. I used vegetable oil instead of butter spread and I baked the ingredients in the oven without the chips and cranberries. (Whenever I've made granola before and baked the cranberries in with the granola mix, I always end up scorching them which makes the granola taste terrible.) I just stirred in the cranberries and chocolate chips once the granola came out of the oven. I made sure to use a spatula to rotate the granola every five minutes so it cooked evenly. My kids had this in a yogurt/fruit breakfast sundae, I had this just in a bowl with FF milk. Good stuff. I'd make this again in a heartbeat.

Very good start! I used olive oil instead of the butter flavoured spread, I used a mixture of pumpkin seeds, chopped almonds, and chopped pecans (delicious!), I added some wheat germ and some shredded coconut, and a small handful of chia seeds. Also, if you add just a couple of tbsp of water, it helps to make the granola clump.

Wow! This is exactly the chocolate granola recipe I've been looking for.  I high recommend doubling the recipe as I made it as stated and it was gone in a day!  Even my picky 2 year old loves it.  I just can't say enough how wonderful this recipe is.  The only change I made was using real butter instead of butter flavored spread.  If you like granola and chocolate this is the recipe for you!

I haven't tried this yet but it's similar to another granola bar from AR. Will definitely try this one. Thanks for sharing.

I did this with about 1/3 cup pecans instead of almonds, no craisins, and real butter. Those were the only adjustments I made. This is really good with some milk. We were eating it before it was even cooled! I took mine out after about 10 minutes and stirred it up, this helped mix the chocolate around. I thought this was really good. But for some reason I would have preferred it without chocolate. And I put chocolate on EVERYTHING! Next time I am going to sub raisins for the chocolate chips. I think it will make a nice cinnamon raisin granola. The mild nuttiness from the peanut butter is not too overpowering, so it is versitile.

Wonderful recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  Only thing I changed was real butter in place of the spread.  Super easy and delicious.  Mine was perfect after 15 minutes of baking.  Baking the chocolate chips and then stirring when taken out of the oven makes wonderful chocolate granola nuggets.

I have been searching for a good granola recipe, all the others I tried were not crunchy or tasted blah.  This one is freaking awesome!!  I made this twice, I burned the first batch!  So 20 minutes in my oven was too much, 10-15 worked better!  But the second batch was excellent, it was gobbled up and everyone has been hounding me to go to the store for more oats so I can make it again :]  I did change it slightly, I used real butter, added some shredded coconut, used milk chocolate & omitted the cranberries as not all my kids like dark chocolate or dried fruit, also omitted the almonds because I was all out.  I will definitely make this again, and I will follow the recipe more closely too since some of us like the cranberries & dark chocolate!!

This is absolutely the best recipe, it reminds me of the no bake cookies, but this has more depth. I added coconut and sunflower seeds so I'd recommend adding anything you like. Thanks for sharing

Dee, you are the best!  This is amazing!  My children cannot stop eating...and neither can I!  The 1 thing I will change next time is dropping the cinnamon down to 1/2 t.  I like it as is, but I wouldn't mind having less cinnamon.  Can't wait to make it again! I've made this over and over again!  I've upped the peanut butter to 3 T and have completely removed the butter.  Still yummy!

This was a great recipe, easy and fast to make. My teenage sons and his friends ate it all in one day so I had to make more the next day. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of coco powder to make it more chocolate, and add flax seeds, since I don't like dried fruit or almonds I may add peanuts next time. Otherwise this was the perfect granola, easy to make and tasted great!!

This was good! I used good old Country Crock spread, and cinnamon coated almonds, peanuts, and added some butterscotch chips as well as chocolate chips and used a little molasses. I also added more honey than is called for but that's because I like a lot of honey. I dislike cranberries so I didn't add those. Next time I'll add raisins.

Thank you for sharing!!! This is amazing stuff! My whole family devoured it! My 2 year old included. The only thing I didn't use was the non-stick spray I just lightly coated my pan with vegan butter and it turned out great!!!   Thanks again!

This was my first attempt at making granola and it was fantastic!  I made a few adjustments for my own nutritional preferences. I substituted coconut sugar, almond butter, and coconut oil.  I added a couple of tablespoons of chia seeds and ground flax with the oats and a tablespoon of cocoa.  Although I am not sure if the cocoa was necessary.  Left out the cranberries and added mini semi sweet chocolate chips after it had cooled.  This is going to be perfect on top of my Greek yogurt and berries.

My family and I love this recipe!   I changed nothing and it was perfect.   The only problem I had was it didn't  last.   I have three boys, 17, 12, and  6. It was gone in less than an hour.   I will double next time.

Love this recipe!  As soon as we run out I have to make another recipe.  I tweak it for our preferences: I add 1 Tbsp add cocoa powder, decrease the brown sugar, and I crush the almonds finely (plus add a little extra).  Great healthy breakfast to get my family going.

I'm addicted to this granola.   Secret ingredients are the brown sugar & peanut butter.  I added some coconut and used pecans...you created a great granola...tastes great as a cereal.

This is amazing for me because I don't eat wheat, so it makes a great breakfast cereal alternative. I didnt use the nuts and instead used coconut and dried cherries. It was amazing! Thank you so much for the recipie!

This granola is great!  I followed others suggestions and used vegetable oil instead of the butter spread.  I also added the dark chocolate chips & cranberries immediately after it came out of the oven and it is delicious.  I've made it two times and found 15 minutes was the perfect bake time (flip over every 5 minutes).  This recipes will be one of our favorites in the year ahead!!

Really good!  I soaked my oatmeal for optimal nutrition so just had to change a few things.  Doubled the recipe and soaked it in about 3/4 c. water with a generous splash of lemon juice and about 1 T. of whole wheat flour.  Used sucanat in place of sugar (and used about 1/2 the amount) and real butter.  Due to the soaking, I baked this at a low temp for about 45 minutes to crisp it up, and actually mistakenly almost burned it.  We still enjoyed it, even extra toasty, and will add it to the breakfast rotation.  Thanks!

oh man.....these are tasty.  We substituted the "butter flavored spread" with coconut oil...that worked well.  Definitely a repeat recipe in my box

I really love this granola recipe. I make it all the time for breakfast. I don't add the chocolate, but it's still very sweet. And I like having the peanut butter in there for some added protein.

This is easy and delicious. I used coconut oil and added 1/4 cup popped quinoa. It's moist and salty and sweet. I'm hoping it crisps up when it cools so we can try it as breakfast cereal.

We make this recipe quite often and now take a little creative license with it.  I make the "sauce" but put in more dry ingredients which cuts back the sweetness.  It was very good with ground flax sprinkled in it, fewer chocolates, and a variety of dried fruits.  My son is allergic to nuts so I skip the almonds and add Kamut as the base.  I've also used Agave Nectar when we're out of honey.  When going to all the trouble make a double batch~ it freezes nicely.

Combining brown sugar, honey, vanilla extract, sweetened craisins & dark chocolate chips made this way too sweet.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I replaced the "fake butter" (ew) with olive oil and I omitted the optional cranberries...it came out way too dry. I've made a lot of granola and I noticed while mixing it that it needed more liquid, but I decided to just follow the recipe. Next time I'll add some applesauce.

This is wonderful, but I made a couple of changes in my second batch. My son thought the first batch was too sweet, so I deleted the brown sugar in the second batch, used vegetable oil and used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips.  As another reviewer suggested, I stirred in the craisins and chocolate at the end.  It was great.  My son has asked me to include it in a care package -- this time I'm going to add sunflower seeds that I have on hand.

so easy, and so good! I doubled most ingredients except the brown sugar (used 3/4 c), and added an extra cups of oats when it looked like more "good stuff" than I wanted. Baked it 20 minutes, and added the chocolate chips after it cooled. Can't wait to try it on my instant pot yogurt in the morning

I am making these for the kids lunch. We have to be peanut free so I omitted the peanut butter and added 2 more tablespoons of honey. It is pretty sweet, but still very nice. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

I doubled the recipe and put the 2nd batch on a bigger tray, which meant cooking the granola in a thinner layer, which scorched it (word to the new granola makers like me).

My family & I love this!! All my friends ask for the recipe.  It's great as is but I usually add a handful (1/8-1/4C) coconut, chia seeds, & wheat germ. This is great to eat when we're biking, hiking, etc.!

Amazing. Used olive oil, and added 1 Tbsp cocoa powder to the dry mixture. Also left out the almonds and cranberries because I didn't have any. Just fabulous. Love it with milk. Stirred every five minutes, and it was done by 15 minutes. Will be making again. Thanks for sharing!

Made exactly as written except added the chocolate after cooking and used real butter. 
This was my first try making any sort of homemade granola and it's delicious.! 
Mine was still a bit mushy after the cooking time, but pulled it out of the oven hoping it would crisp up. It dried out and crisped up just fine.

I love this chocolate granola! A yummy treat, but pretty healthy as well! I always double it and cool for about 23 minutes total. I do add two tablespoons of cocoa powder to a double batch for a little extra chocolate flavor. And I use coconut oil in place of butter to make it a little healthier. Make sure you put parchment paper down or tinfoil on your pan for easy clean up!

This is a hit with my kids and grandkids!   I changed the first batch by using  orange honey, real butter, and sunflower seeds. The second batch I replaced the almonds with chopped walnuts,  but kept the real butter and sunflower seeds.  I used parchment paper on a large baking sheet and pressed the mixture down firmly with a big spatula. Once baked I let it cool completely before removing it from the pan. It comes out like peanut brittle, you just break off a pieces and store sealed in the refrigerator!!  
(Next time I may try Canola oil.)

Question:  The first time I made this it came out like "bars" ... big, flat clumps of granola.  The second time it tasted just as delicious but was crumbly granola.  I liked the larger pieces better, as I could grab a couple of pieces as a snack.  I think I made it the exact same way both times, but the consistency was entirely different!  Any ideas on how I can get the bigger chunks?  BOTH batches were delicious though!

Way, way too sweet as written, and I have quiet a sweet tooth. All I tasted was sugar. Other than that, it had a nice consistency and was really easy to make.

I made a double batch of this over the weekend.  I was out of almonds so subbed walnuts and used butter instead of spread. It is really good but I will take it out of the oven at 15 minutes next time.  Otherwise, delicious.
