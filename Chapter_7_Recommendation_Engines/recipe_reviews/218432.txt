This is exactly how Grandma taught me how to make pie filling, only sometimes she'd add a tablespoon of lemon juice if the cherries turned out too sweet. This is a great recipe to take advantage of all those beautiful Washington cherries.

someone gave me cherries this weekend .... it is way to hot to be baking, so I decided to make the filling now and bake later. This filling is wonderful.....  It tastes so good I wonder if I will even get a pie, what I don't just eat with a spoon may go over ice cream or on waffles!!!

(and I doubled the recipe)

This was excellent!  I cut it in half and used it with the Jenny's Black Forest Cake recipe.  Not too sweet, but a perfect complement with chocolate cake!  :-)  Thanks.  Update*** I used 1 1/2 cups cherries, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 Tbs cornstarch.  It was the perfect amount to fill a 2 layer black forest cake!

DO NOT ADD THE CORNSTARCH DIRECTLY TO THE COOKED CHERRIES IN JUICE!!
I knew this didn't sound right.  Luckily I had made a trial batch where I followed the recipe directly, and sure enough, that batch has lumps of cornstarch in it that will not dissolve.

Make a slur with the cornstarch.  Add a little cold water to the cornstarch in a separate cup or bowl mixing rapidly so it is just a white cornstarch liquid. No dry specs.  No lumps.  
I stirred the slur into my second batch and it thickened PERFECTLY!!   Hope this helps!

Great recipe, if you use Arrowroot you won't have the cornstarch flavor and Arrowroot keeps whatever sauce you are making clear while cornstarch makes in opaque or cloudy.

OMG!  How can something so simple be so good?!  No one wanted the cherries off the tree because they were so tart. So I got the lot of them.  They made a FANTASTIC filling!  I added a little cinnamon (maybe 1/2 tsp) and a few drops of almond extract.  There may be no pie.  Because I keep eating it by the spoonful!

This was delicious and very easy to make!  The only revision I made was to add 1 Tblspoon lemon juice to make it a little more tart.  I will definitely make it again.

I have  a dwarf  pie cherry tree and   this was a perfect recipe to make a  pie from sratch. Its  easy after pitting all those berries and  my pie was  delicous. I did add about 2t. of lemon jucie, a capful of  almond  extract and 1/2 t. cinnamon. When I made my pie, I  dotted the top with butter, than lattice  pie crust-- a keeper!

I made this from bing cherries as a tart filling and it was delicious!!  I, too, used a little lemon juice as I would for fruit jams and preserves.  I'm so glad I had enough filling left over to use as a jam spread  on my toast and even over ice cream!

Because I was concerned about the corn starch clumping, I made one small change, which was to simmer the cherries with the sugar to start, then mix the corn starch with just enough water to make a slurry. After about fifteen minutes of initial cook time, I added the starch and blended. It thickened immediately, and I let it simmer on low an additional three or four minutes, enough time to cook away the corn starch taste. Turned out very well, and I was extremely pleased with this recipe. The only caveat I have is not to overfill your pie shell, because this filling lifted my covered pie top and leaked out of the edges. A little goes a long way!

I will diffinately make this again, very good.  I noticed one older review said it didn't thicken and it tasted like corn starch.  She needed to cook it longer until nice and bubbly and the cornstarch turns clear. I did add  3-4 drops of almond flavoring.  Cool filling if trying to use a lattice top, my pie crust strips became soft and wanted to fall apart.

Didn't turn out for me. I followed the directions exactly. The taste was okay but I could taste cornstarch even though it was mixed all the way. Never thickened up.

Excellent, saves me a lot of money considering I have a cherry tree in my yard-comes out a little sweet but the advice regarding lemon juice is perfect-plus it adds a little "kick" to it.  Great!

Used this to mix together fresh cherries/blueberries for a cherry crisp recipe that called for filling. I didn't cook this on the stove, just added it to the pan. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup since the cherries were very ripe. Added lemon and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Thanks!

I made half a recipe to use on top of a Black Forest cake. I placed frozen cherries in a saucepan, sprinkled the sugar over, and let them sit until they juiced slightly. Then I added the cornstarch and cooked for a few minutes until thick. It came out perfect.

I used the filling for my Black Forest cake, I halved the sugar and it was still very sweet, will use 1/4 cup sugar next time with 1/8 cup cornstarch.
For cherry pie used 1 kg of frozen sour cherries, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cornstarch and a dash of almond extract, fills pie shell perfectly with barely any seepage, baked at 400 degrees for 1 hour.

I made this Cherry pie filling to place inside the "Cherry Crunch" recipe also listed here on Allrecipes. It turned out so good that words pale in comparison to the flavorful taste.

made this for the first time with the cherries from our trees in our backyard and it was awesome!! I did add just a touch of vanilla just because I like it in most of my pastry recipes. So easy and so much better than a can. I made turnovers and mini cherry pies in the little foil tart pans to give away to family n friends. I will make this again next cherry season and make enough and sooner(before everyone eats most of the cherries) to put up for pastries after the official cherry season.

This was a HUGE hit this Thanksgiving. It was the first pie to go! It's also my husband's favorite kind of pie and he said it was the best he ever had. This will definitely be my "go to". I used canned pitted cherries and they worked fine btw.

My ex had FINALLY, after 2 years, 5 months, and 17 days but I'm not bitter, found "that last moving box he swore was NOT in his basement," and, once I thoroughly cleaned the mouse nest out of my newly re-acquired Crock Pot, I was itchin' to actually cook. Inexplicably, I had ended up with a stockpile of canned tart cherries. Wanting to make a "3-ingredient dump cake" (haha, I said "dump") I saw on FB, I realized the cherries alone would simply not do, and so I found this recipe. I accidentally had cornstarch (for me, cooking is making toast, so I have no business being in possession of something as specific as cornstarch) and *unexpired* sugar (whaaaat?). The pie filling came out amazingly perfect. I even tried to pull my 9yo son away from Minecraft to show him how the cornstarch changed consistency with heat but he was busy building the solar system out of TNT and couldn't be bothered with science. I put the cherry pie filling into the butter-greased CP, mixed a stick of melted butter with yellow cake mix (also both miraculously unexpired - what whaaaat??), crumbled that on top of the cherry pie filling, cooked on high for 2 hours, and was happily sugared up for several days. Granted, it didn't come out as anything I'd want to photograph - but it was DELICIOUS. The cherry pie filling was *almost* too sweet, but most people wouldn't think that, as they would eat it as dessert after a meal, and not AS the meal itself, 3x/day, for 4 days.

Came out delicious! I squeezed a lemon slice into the fruit and added a touch of almond extract. My cook times were a bit longer than the recipe stated, but I'm guessing that the high altitude here in CO is the reason. 

As for the reviewer who had this not turn out: mine was also runny and had a strong corn starch flavor at the suggested cook time. I'm guessing yours might have needed a few more minutes, too.

I  used this as a basis for how much sugar to add to my quart jar of canned cherries.   I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup, and mixed the corn starch with water as most people do before stirring it into the pot.  It was plenty sweet, and that is probably because some sugar was already in the liquid of the canning jar of cherries.

I used sour cherries and only used half the sugar. Glad I didn't add the whole amount, otherwise would have been way too sweet for my taste. Thank you for the recipe.

Wonderful cherry pie filling! I had never tried to do a cherry pie and refused to make it with canned filling. This one came out superb!!! I added about a tbsp. of freshly squeezed lemon juice because my cherries were on the sweet side. Perfect amount of sweetness and tartness!!! It's a shame that cherries are not in season all year 'round!

I can't buy cherry pie filling and wondered what I could do for the Best No-Bake Cheesecake.  Now I have an idea.  I suppose one could also put some sugar in it, if the cherries are too tart.  It will be the cherry season in a few months and I will have a go.

My cherries were tart, but the sauce was way too sweet.  The second batch I made, I added the lemon juice (like recommended by others), and it didn't make a difference.  Loved the thickness, but seemed overly sweet...will cut down on the sugar and cornstarch next time.

As another reviewer said, make a slurry with the cornstarch first. I did not add any water, but instead used the cherry juice from the bottom of the bowl of pitted fresh cherries. So, while cherries are heating on the stove, in a bowl combine cornstarch & cherry juice, whisk until smooth. Add a few drops of almond extract. Add sugar, whisk again. Pour into bubbling pot of cherries, stirring to combine. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until sauce has thickened. Taste a cherry and sauce for desired seeetness/ tartness. If too sweet, add a tsp of lemon juice. If too tart, add a T of sugar. Repeat as necessary. Cool filling completely before assembling pie.

made this using Montmerency cherries I freeze every summer.  I added 1 T fresh lemon juice and 1 tsp almond extract as well as a couple of shakes of pie spice (cinnamon, cloves, mace, ginger).  II add the cornstarch , sugar and other ingredients to the juice and cook until it starts to thicken - then add cherries and turn off heat.  The glaze is clear and thickens beautifully.  I adjust sugar to taste.  This recipe is SO EASY and ALWAYS PERFECT for pie filling or as a sauce or topping for cake, cheesecake etc.  I initially made it just as written and it was delicious - just tweaked it to suit my families individual taste.

I make this filling to go into a Black Forest Gateau which has become a tradition in our family for my husband's birthday. I use pitted fresh black cherries instead of tart red, reduce the sugar to around 3/4 cup, and it works incredibly well in the cake.

I like to read the reviews before making a recipe.  Based on a few other reviews, here's how I put my batch together.  My cherries were frozen and when they thawed, I poured the juice into a measuring cup and mixed 2 T of corn starch with it (half of what the recipe calls for).  After bringing the cherries to a simmer, I added 1/2 cup of sugar and the corn starch mixed with cherry juice.  I let it warm up and thicken.  I tasted the sauce to see if it needed more sugar, but it was sweet enough.   I prefer to make things from scratch rather than buy store bought.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  As long as I have cherries on hand, I will not buy canned again!

If you're having a problem with the cornstarch, try adding it with the cherries before you turn on the stove.  Adding cornstarch to hot liquids makes it clump together, if you do need to add it to something hot mix it with a little cold water first.

I should have tasted my cherries because they were already so sweet that 1 cup of sugar made it too sweet.  Next time I will cut 1/4 cup out if the cherries are sweet.

This was excellent. I made a double batch which made two pies and enough left over for tarts. Great for sour cherries from our tree. Added one  tablespoon of lemon juice.

This is a good  recipe.  I made cherry turnovers. It was just the right amount of cornstarch. Also I did add  lemon juice and almond extract. Lemon seems to bring out the flavor of fruit. I  made a triple batch.

Excellent! I used 3/4c. sugar, but I'm sure 1c. would've turned out just as yummy. Simple to cook ~ cutting and pitting the cherries took time, but wasn't annoying to do. Someone mentioned to add water to the cornstarch, which I did, then figured the cherry juice would act as the water, so I just added the cornstarch as is (after whisking with sugar). Thickened great.

I used 3/4 cup sugar and a bit shy of 1/4 cup of cornstarch and it was perfect!

Wow, so easy and so good. My wife and I grew the cherries, picked, and pitted them ourselves. Super yummy, and rewarding.

The recipe may work exactly as is, and if you don't precook it, however, it's a disaster if you precook and reduce the sugar or substitute tapioca for the cornstarch (which I avoid due to GMO risk). I cut the sugar to 3/4 c. and  doubled the tapioca, but still had a completely runny pie. I'm not sure what happened. The filling was the perfect consistency when I precooked it and poured it into the pie crust. However, when it came out of the oven, it was watery. I've never had that happen using tapioca before, so I'm not sure what's happening.

I have been using this recipe for the last two years. I use the cherries from the tree in our yard, and it works perfectly! I have never had any problems with it, and my family and friends love the pies and pastries I make with it. Thank you!!

This recipe is great, but I made a small change. I used tapioca flour (starch) which eliminates the cornstarch taste since tapioca flour has no taste of its own, but works jut as good as cornstarch in equal amounts.

I used 1 can of bing cherries which was about 1 3/4 cups so scaled down the other ingredients (be sure to use the cherries in juice, not pie filling kind). They are packed in juice so you can just add the sugar/cornstarch right away.  Turned out great for my coffee cake filling!

Made this recipe just as directions said. Easy and delicious! I held out a little sugar as some previous reviewers suggested. I added it back in though because it didn't taste overly sweet to me. Just the right amount of tartness with the full cup of sugar. My cherries were picked from my in-laws cherry tree and frozen, so maybe they were more tart than some. Delicious cherry filling recipe!

It was a little soupy (made 3 batches at once), so I added a few more minutes to the simmering  time and a teaspoon of pectin, which turned out great!

I did not know it was so easy to make pie filling. Ok a little putzy to pit cherries, but my three year old was helping me (mostly by eating the cherries) so good quality time together. I used this for a cherry rhubarb pie. I had about a cup of extra cherries so I threw them in there and put the extra filling in a bowl to heat up for popovers. Delish:)

This was my first successful attempt at homemade cherry pie filling! I did use canned red tart cherries as I did not want to pit the fresh cherries that aren't at peak ripeness at the moment. I used the filling to make mini cherry pies. So good!

I made this for my boss. It was for his birthday. He loved it. Had a little left over so made a mini one for my daught in law also. She kept giving strong hints that she wanted one. Lol
They both loved it.
I made no changes. Didn't need to.

Why have I never done this before?  Simple and oh so GOOD!  I made a couple batches and froze them to save  for the holidays!  First batch taught me NOT to slice the cherries, they will release their just fine when whole.  I also used 5 cups of pitted cherries in the second batch because I like more fruit than sauce in a pie.  I'll never buy canned cherry pie mix again!

I don’t normally like cherry pie filling, but after this recipe I’ve changed my mind! This is so much better than store-bought canned cherry pie filling! The tart cherries helped it not be too sweet. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a slurry with the cornstarch and water, then added it to the cherries and sugar. Thickened up nicely, and good balance of sweet/tart. My husband and son loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Super easy and delicious!  If sauce has a bit too much liquid just add a little more cornstarch.  If too thick just add a little water.

The cherries never thickened! I tried again, and added more cornstarch, but all that ever came out was water and soggy cherries! it tasted okay, somewhat starchy, but it didn't really work out for me.

Sorry.. I followed the directions exactly and reading the reviews I even cooked it longer but I still could taste the cornstarch, it wasn't overpowering but it was definitely there. Since I used tart cherries I ended up making a simple syrup and adding about 3/4 cup of that to the filling to get rid of the cornstarch taste. It made the filling looser but for the recipe I needed it for I was looking for more cherries anyways so I didn't mind that. I did like how simple it was to make a pie filling, as I've never done that before, but next time I will look for another recipe.

This recipe is fool proof.  I've been using it since we started harvesting tart cherries from our tree...like 10 years ago I think.  Love it.

Easy blending with the cornstarch and sugar mixture into the hot cherries.

Too much sugar for my taste, I would try 2/3 of a cup next time.

This was a good recipe. I needed to use sweet cherries, so I reduced the sugar to half. After it had cooled slightly, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon, vanilla extract and almond extract. This was super yummy. I used it to make Cherry Crumble Bars. and they disappeared very quickly with rave reviews. 
Note: this made a very thick pie filling (especially after it sat in the fridge), so depending on what it will be used for, you might want to reduce the amount of corn starch.

This was so easy and delicious.  It's cherry season here and I had a bunch of orchard fresh cherries that I pitted and used.  I followed the recipe with only the personalization addition of an eighth of a teaspoon of almond extract.   Pie has never disappeared so quickly from our kitchen before.  This recipe is such a keeper.  Thank you!

This is a good recipe but i substituted the sugar for agave because I'm a diabetic and regular sugar is the worst for me. Besides that, i recommend mixing the cornstarch with some cold water, before adding it to the cherries. The reason is because i added the cornstarch to my cherries and instead of blending together well, i had a lot of small lumps of cornstarch that didn't dissolve. I'll keep that in mind next time i make this recipe. Can't wait to use this for my cherry pie!

First time made my own cherry pie filling. Didn’t add lemon juice, only added 1/3 C white sugar as I used ripe cherries. Sweet enough for me. Really good!  I’m waiting for it to cool down right now, gonna make cherry pie right tonite!!!

It is a simple and tasty pie filling.  One thing of note - I have a 9.5" Pyrex pie dish, and I need at least a double recipe of this to fill the pie.

Worked out well.  The sugar I added separately first then mixed cornstarch with a bit of water.  Add some of the hot cherry sauce to the cornstarch,then mix the cornstarch in the boiling pot.   That is how my mother taught me

As others have posted, I believe I followed the directions exactly, and yet it did not thicken enough for me either. Perhaps there is a trick of temperature or speed of stirring or something?  I ended up adding more corn starch, which did thicken it, but also made it taste starchy.  I think if I did it again, I'd boil off some liquid prior to adding the starch to see if that made it less watery.

I made it and it turned out quite wonderful! However, instead of using tart cherries I used sweet dark ones since that's all my store had in the frozen section, and to make the mixture just a bit more sour I added some lime juice as I had no lemon juice on me. It took a bit longer than a few minutes for the sauce to thicken up, though. Still turned out absolutely wonderful!

Added more lemon juice since I used dark sweet cherries and while cooking it was rather sweet-although I used 1/2 cup sugar.
  It was excellent!

we bought dark frozen cherries by mistake,  but oh MY is the result fabulous.  I added just a smidgen of cherry brandy.  Everything else is just as the recipe says. It thickened up beautifully.    I will keep this recipe.

Most filling recipes have you cook everything at once, but you really want to let the cherries cook alone first, so three stars for that.  This recipe calls for too much sugar, though.  Cherries are all sugar, so you can cut this extra amount in half.  Also, anytime you use corn starch, you want to dissolve it in some (~2 Tbs) cold water first. I also added some lemon to taste. Perfect!

I just finished making this filling with fresh cherries. I decided to wait until tomorrow to make a pie, but l tried a little over ice cream and it is delicious! I tripled the recipe and I'm glad that I did. I plan to freeze and use later.

Add about 1/2 teaspoon of almond flavor after thickening and removing from the heat.  It adds a nice kick.

Let me make this clear.  I rarely rate anything on this site.  However, this was so good, that it required me telling you about it.  I doubled the recipe - 8 cups.  Used fresh cherries from my neighbor's tree - lucky me! Used 6 cups in a greased 9" deep dish pie plate with Pillsbury pie crusts - 2 crusts.  Cut a few slits in the top. Brushed it with egg whites, sprinkled the crust with some sugar and baked at 425 for 30-35 minutes (until brown).  Now, I bake a lot, but my husband took this pie into work and said it was THE BEST PIE HE'S EVER HAD!  Just the perfect amount of sweet and tart.  His friends emailed/texted me to say the same thing. This recipe is SPECTACULAR and so easy!  Thank you!

Did a few things different for a whole cherry pie. Used double the amount of cherries for a deep dish 9" pie. Added 2 tsp of almond extract to give it a nice flavor. I drained the cherries prior to putting into the pie crust. Made it this way several times now, the filling is not runny and moist with great flavor.

I did this recipe exactly as written. I used frozen cherries that I let thaw out in the fridge for about 24hrs and scooped them out with the juices that it made from thawing. Cause my cherries came out the fridge to stove, I cooked on low heat til hot and maintained that heat for about 5 mins before adding my sugar/cornstarch mixture. This came out so gosh darn tasty. I doubled the recipe and canned 2 quarts along with lots too tasty to stop tasting. Lol

This is a great simple recipe. I used Arrowroot instead of cornstarch for clearer filling.

Flavours are great but I found it too gelatinous when it cooled.  I followed the recipe to a T using frozen sour cherries.  I found they broke down to much and I'd have preferred more texture/whole cherries.  Not sure how to tweet to get more whole cherry presentation so will keep looking.

This came out way better than I thought it would, just because of the simplicity. I did add maybe a teaspoon of lemon juice, but other than that, as written and totally recommended.

Perfect as is.  Very simple to make - the most time consuming part was pitting the cherries!  I was slightly concerned about it being a lot of corn starch, but it gelled up beautifully.  I used cherries from a friend's tree.  Will definitely be making again (and again and again and again... :D)

The only challenging part of the recipe was pitting so many cherries. It is delicious and simple as is. I also doubled the recipe and am freezing half for later.

I'm not a baker...I BBQ, grill and smoke.  This is the 1st time I attempted a Cherry Pie and it came out without a hitch.  I also added the lemon juice because I like lemons.  At times I make pies for dessert.  Mainly a Lemon Merangue or Apple or an amazingly simple Key Lime pie and this one now goes on the list.  Next challenge?  Cheesecake :-D

Very simple delicious filling. I used organic frozen cherries and substituted just little bit of  corn starch for potato starch which makes filling more thicker and adds more shine.

Bought some whole foods ready made puff pastry and made cherry turnovers with white icing drizzled on top. This filling was the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Every turnover was gone within minutes and they were the highlight of our meal. Loved this recipe!

Perfect.  I was out of lemon juice so added a splash of lime. My mom's pie crust recipe, a little extra butter and sugar sprinkled over the bottom crust - totally hit the spot tonight.

What a perfect recipe! Fast, easy and delicious! I'm making 10 dozen mini cheesecakes for a cookie exchange next week and after pricing canned cherry pie filling (over $4.25 a can) I decided to make my own cherry topping. I found frozen cherries on sale and made 1/4 of a batch to try it out and it was just the greatest! Thanks for saving me so much money!

Excellent, Excellent!...and did I say "EXCELLENT"!!!?
Wonderful! I doubled the recipe but had just under 8 cups of cherries so when I doubled the sugar and cornstarch, I held back just a tad of each and it turned out AWESOME!  I also used BLACK CHERRIES instead of the red cherries...delicious!  I am now wondering if I could use this receipe to make pie filling to can....and wondering what other instructions I'd need in order to can up some jars of this in the future...I'll have to research a bit :)
