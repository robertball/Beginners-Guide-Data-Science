A good family friendly recipe.  It wasn't what I would consider hot or spicy.  In fact, I was surprised by the blandness. The sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce and we could barely taste the chipotle.  I added more chipotles and quite a bit of salt, but still felt like there should have been another layer of flavor.  Since I've never had torta before, I didn't know if it needed a little adjusting or if it's really supposed to be a simple tomato based recipe. We ate a couple of the sandwiches like the recipe suggested, but ended up mixing the sauce with the pork and eating as pulled pork sandwiches.

I recently made this for our daughter's graduation party, at which we served a Mexican style menu.  While this recipe took awhile, it was WONDERFUL!  All the ingredients, cooking time, & instructions were accurate & so helpful.  We varied this however, by combining the delicious sauce with the meat & serving it as a chipotle pulled pork on buns.  Everyone loved this.  Thank you for listing it DeAnna. :-)

I absolutely loved this recipe!  It seems labour intensive but it isn't really and what time you do put into it pays off in spades - the taste was full and spicy and just delightfully yummy!  My husband and two teenage kids loved them!  The pork just melts in your mouth...Definitely making it again!

The rub was great. I did add two of the small red dried chilis, one of the ancho chilis and some jalapenos to the sauce. I also roasted all the veggies before adding to the sauce, It resulted in a really amazing smokey flavor with a little bit of heat. Thank you for a great recipe

Very good :) Being from the land where Tortas ahogadas were born (Guadalajara) I can say that this tasted very similar to what they sell here in restaurants and street stands

The roast tasted great fresh out, but was too tough to shred. Crock pot probably would have made that easier.  I thought the sauce would be more flavorful as well.
