This came out fabulously well--almost as good as my Arabic mother-in-law's recipe!  For more flavor, add a dash of lemon juice and olive oil to the water used to soak the bulghur wheat.

I omit the water and soak the bulgur in lemon juice. Really adds something to it

This recipe called for too much water, otherwise it was good and simple.  After the bulgur absorbed as much water as it could, there was still a lot of water left in the bow.  I drained it with a strainer.  I may try it again and cut down the water to 2 cups.

One and a half cups of bulgar wheat for 1 cup of parsley and 1/4 of mint is way off. To be authentic, it should be the other way around, 1 cup of prepared bulgar to about 2 cups of chopped parsley and 1/2 to 1 cup of mint, depending on the personal preference for fresh mint (I go for the cup). and when I say prepared, i mean about 1/2 cup dry and then cover it with boiling water and some salt; let it sit for about 15 minutes, then pour if off into a strainer and run cool tap water over it to cool it. Take it by the handfuls and squeeze as much water out as you can and toss the squeezed bulgur into the salad, this will prevent sogginess as your salad will stay light and fluffy. I also prefer regular onion finely minced to the green onions, about 1/8 a cup, or to taste. Lastly, after you chop the parley (which must be Italian flat-leaf), squeeze the water out of that too (and the mint) before adding it to the salad, again to keep the salad from being watery and soggy. Two pounds of tomatoes sound off too; I'd say two medium sized tomatoes are more than enough. Taboulah should be mostly green in color and dotted with bulgur and tomatoes. Fresh lemon, olive oil, salt, and pepper are to taste. When made this way, it is the ultimate salad with kebabs or rice dishes, and soooo healthy!

Very tasty, I used 2 cups of parsley the way they make it at the Jewish restaurant and added a tablespoon of chopped fresh mint, so good.

My family wouldn't touch it.  Didn't taste anything like tabbouleh we've had in restaurants.  Very odd flavor, too grainy tasting.

Simple & delicious. I usually like more parsley in tabbouleh but I think this is a more traditional recipe. Very good.

If you want something great tasting and that is as good as any other recipe for basic Tabbouleh, this is it. I cut the recipe into a third and was able to almost fill a 2 cup plastic container.

I loved the recipe!  I added a bit more mint, and a little less lemon.  Very easy to make and the right amount for a small crowd!

Very similar to the recipe I grew up eating. Learned to make it from a Lebanese uncle. We use a little more oil and lemon, but the difference in the bulgur. I use 2c.
Cover it with water and soak it for 20 min. Drain. The extra  oil and lemon make up for the extra liquid. It's best to make it the day before you'll use it, or at least several hours, because the bulgur is still hard immediately after. Why not soften it with the dressing and not the water?

I made lots of changes to this recipe but I still think it was great. First I used quinoa instead of bugler, to make it gluten free. I also add a whole cucumber, slice it so most of the seeds are out and very small. Because I like lots of color I use a purple onion instead of the green and finally I use cilantro instead of the mint. I like lots of lime so I make sure to use the right amount. Often after it sits in the fridge I add a little extra. Great for hot weather!

Next time, I will try soaking in less water and adding the lemon juice and oil to the soaking liquid. Otherwise, it's great!

I tried it, made it as written except used dried parsley instead of fresh, because I didn't have any fresh.  I've never tried tabouleh so I have nothing to compare it to.  I love it am now making it a regular dish!
