I modified this recipe to make one AWESOME side dish! First I made mashed potatos mixed with cream cheese, sour cream, salt, pepper and a little bit of milk (my usual mashed potato recipe) and put them in the bottom of glass baking dish, then I sauteed sweet onions in butter and poured the onion and butter mixture on top of the mashed potato layer, then I topped with the american cheese.... YUMMY!!!

This needed something.  Made again and added garlic powder to the potatoes, used sharp cheddar, grated, and topped with crisp bacon pieces.

Didn't read the review before I made, and then made again like the other reviewer.  I liked much better.  The American cheese just doesn't do it justice.  I added roasted garlic along with the green onions and mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Thanks for the base.

tasty, albeit high in fat.  i threw in some green beans and chicken broth, which gave it some additional texture.  i made this extra-quick by using the packaged refrigerated carton of mashed potatoes!

I just ate this whole thing for lunch by myself. Not bad, not fantastic, but tasty enough - I find mashed potatoes pretty boring, but I do love cheese and onions, so this worked out nicely. I may make this again, as it's so simple to prepare.

A good basic recipe. I prefer to top with a mixture of French-fried onions and shredded soy cheddar.
