Okay, first of all if you are debating whether to try this...DO IT!! It is so good. I pulsed my pecans in my food processer until they were broken up but not completely ground. I used the amounts called for with everything except the butter. I just added enough to moisten the crust, but not drench it. The nuts have natural oils that come out during baking. Don't forget to refridgerated this before baking, because it really helps hold it together. I used this for a cheesecake recipe, and let me tell you, it got RAVE reviews!! And the best part is, that there is no flour and so it is gluten free...perfect for my mother in law with celiac. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I used this crust as an alternative for a graham cracker crust for pumpkin cheesecake. The flavour was wonderful, but I found it a bit soft. I'll definitely use the crust again and I don't think I'll increase the baking time, but I might use a bit less butter to compensate for the natural oils in the pecans.

Very good, I used it for a Libby's pumpkin pie (recipe on can of pumpkin).  Was a great tasty subtitute for the flour crust since I'm on a low carb diet.  Like the other reviewers, I used Splenda for the sugar.  Only reason I'm rating it 4 stars is because it came out a little too thick even in my huge 9" pie dish.  Just use it a bit at a time as you build the crust and it's perfect.

Good recipe. I like it better though with 1/2 cup flour added and 1/3 cup Splenda BROWN sugar. The flour will soak up the greasiness of the butter. I just chop the pecans. This crust is awesome with pineapple cheesecake!

I'm so glad to find a gluten-free pie crust.  My family (even my 9 year old) loved it.  We made key lime pie and the combo was terrific.

OH WOW! This is SO incredibly easy and I liked it better than a wheat crust! I have been looking for a dairy and gluten free pie crust for my son. I made this crust dairy free by using coconut oil in place of the butter.   I baked the crust for about 8 mins at 350, and let it cool. THen I filled it with a gluten/casein free pumpkin filling. I was afraid the nut crust might burn (it was starting to smell that way) so I placed a piece of foil shiny side down under it and a strip of foil shiny side out around it. It worked like a charm!  The crust came out perfectly! I highly recommend this recipe. Even a beginner can make this!

Very good crust - It is gluten free so I have used this crust for  passover recipe. I used almonds in place of pecans - that is what I had. I also substituted 1 egg for the butter. It held the crust together and the almonds gave the crust a nice subtle buttery taste. I filled it with a strawberry sauce and sliced strawberries! It looked and tasted great!

I used a mixture of almond and hazelnut flour and increased butter a bit. 
This is a fantastic recipe that can be altered easily for low-carb.

this crust rocks.  it could be a cookie, a cream pie crust, an icecream cake bottom.  I used brown sugar and finely chopped pecans from a bag plus earth balance instead of butter.  and I put in cardamom insead of cinnamon.  it was flipping awesome.

Makes about double what is needed for a 9" crust.  When I pressed it into the pan it made a crust about 1/3 to 1/2 of an inch thick, which reduced the volume of pie filling significantly.  Good flavor otherwise.

This wasn't too bad.  Filled it with pumpkin pie filling. It stuck to my pan something fierce and broke all apart when serving.  But, the taste was awesome and I went behind with a spoon when all the pie was gone, to clean up all the crust that had stuck.

Wonderful!  I omitted the cinnamon because of the flavour of pie I was filling it with.  When I first put the crust mixture in the pie plate, it looked like it would be much too thick, but once I shaped it and pressed it in as hard as I could, it was perfect.  I did not pre-bake the crust.  I filled it with the Key Lime Pie VII recipe from this site (this made it GLUTEN-FREE) and baked it as per that recipe.  It is much less sweet than a graham crust, which is awesome with a sweet pie.

It was a little oily, make sure to put another pan under your pie pan to keep from a messy oven. With the price of pecans this was quite expensive, but well worth it. All of that set aside, it went wonderful with my turtle pecan cheesecake.

I used this crust recipe for pumpkin cheesecake.  I could have eaten the crust by itself.  I used three T of butter instead of four, because of the oils in the pecans.  It's almost like a praline crust and the cheesecake complimented it perfectly.  I also refridgerated it for about 4 hours before I baked it becasue I unexpectedly had to leave the house.  I usually use graham cracker crusts for my cheesecake but since this holds up to being filled without crumbling, this is my go to crust now!  Yummy!

Great recipe! I didn't have quite enough pecans so I threw in some walnuts and pulsed them together in the food processor. I used only 2T of butter and also used a 9x13 pan instead of the pie plate. It was perfect size. Baked for about 12 min. Went over very well!

I'd ground up a bunch of pecans and was 1/2 cup short, so I made up the difference with almond meal. This is a great crust for gluten free diets and Passover. I skipped the cinnamon when I made an icebox key lime pie. It was a big hit. I will use this again for pumpkin pie and include the cinnamon. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly but something was off.  I had way too much for one pie pan and there was way, way too much butter.  I love the concept of this as a gluten-free crust so I'll keep playing with the recipe.

I was really happy with this crust.  I used almond meal from Trader Joes but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  I think it definitely needed the full 4 Tbls of butter to keep it together.  The edges were a little crumbly so I was worried it wouldn't come out of the pan but it did.  I used it to make a fresh strawberry pie.

My brother-in-law is on a gluten free diet and because of that he doesn't get to enjoy a lot of the holiday desserts he once did. I used this recipe for my pumpkin pie adding a half-cup of all purpose gluten free flour to absorb some of the oils from the pecans and butter as yooper63 did. It was glorious. Everyone loved my pumpkin pie, especially my brother-in-law. I will try it next as a crust for my cheesecakes.

This is my "go to recipe" for a flourless crust. 
I like the fact that you can change the level of crunchiness ( I do this depending on what filling I use). I have made it more crunchy by pulsing the nuts less, and less crunchy by pulsing the nuts more.  The most important issues for me (I've made this recipe about 20+ times):  Watch the nuts so they don't overcook while they are in the oven (super important if you are going to play with the crunchiness), and  refrigerate the crust afterwards.

It was delicious and came together easily. I spun the broken pecan pieces in the food processor to chop them smaller and then added the other ingredients. It baked up nicely and held together when serving the pie.

I originally made this because my mom has gluten intolerance. Now I make it regardless because it’s just so delicious! Much better and flavorful than graham cracker crust.

Only substitution was  brown sugar. Filled with Molasses-and-Spice Pumpkin Pie. The praline crust complemented the pie perfectly and the Pecan Pie lovers were completely satisfied! I am not a fan of making pie crusts and store-bought seemed too boring for this filling. Will definitely use this recipe in the future. It is relatively versatile and I can't wait to try it with Lemon Ice Box.

I tried this recipe in a 9 inch deep dish pie dish. I pressed the crust all the way up the sides of the pie dish, chilled it, then baked it and the walls of the pie crust melted down into one flat extremely thick crust. It would have worked fine in a 9x13, but this is not functioning as a pie crust.

This recipe was delicious and went extremely well with our toffee-flavored pie filling. I didn't change a thing!

Really grainy. Flavor is good you just have to prepare yourself for the texture.

Fantastic as a cheesecake crust.  I broke my pecans up but didn't completely grind them up.  There were still lots of small pieces.  I used brown sugar.  I did not pre cook it.  It is now my favorite crust for a homemade New York style cheesecake!

Terrific pie crust recipe, especially now that I’m gluten free. The only problem with it is that I can’t stop eating it, lol.

This was a very big hit at the dinner party last night, especially with the  gluten-free guest---this was the reason I made this type of crust to make a peach ice cream pie..  

The crust came together very easily but even though I used a deep-dish pie plate, there was just too much crust.  Next time I would reduce the am't of coarsely chopped pecans to about 1  3/4 cups and mix w/ less sugar and try 2 T of butter.  When it was ready to serve after about 5-6 hours, I let it thaw some but it was still very hard to cut so hubs took it right out of the pie plate and put on a flat surface which did the trick.. It got raves from guests!

My niece has a very serious gluten intolerance problem.  I bought some pecan meal (only ground up pecans) from Nuts.com just in case I couldn't find gluten free pie crust when I make pumpkin pie for her for Thanksgiving and Christmas.    I was unable to find the gluten free crusts prior to  Christmas.  I used this recipe to make a pecan crust for her pie, and it turned out great.  The crust is easy to make and delicious.  Everyone liked it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this several times.  Since we rarely buy butter, I substituted coconut oil, everyone has really liked it.  It's easy to make.

I loved it so next time I did half walnuts and half pecans and 1/4 cup of almond flour.   Excellent gluten free recipe even before the tweaks.

I made this crust for cheesecake for our Easter dinner. One guest said she couldn't decide which was better--the cheesecake or the crust.
