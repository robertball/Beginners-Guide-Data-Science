I changed some things too. I have a 7 qt. slow cooker, and I wanted to make 5 pork chops. I didn't use any eggs or milk. I simply mixed flour, garlic powder, salt and peper together and just floured the porkchops with that mixture, no eggs. Then I browned them in the shortening. While they were browning, I dumped 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of beef broth,  1 envelope of onion soup mix, and two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms in the slow cooker, and mixed it all up. After the porkchops were done browning (about 4 min. on each side), I added them to the slow cooker and covered them with the soup mixture, and let them cook for 5 hours on high. They were so tender and the taste was out of this world, the aroma filled the house. There were no extra spices needed. I served them with mashed potatos and corn. My kids loved them! I will definately make this again and again!

We LOVE this dish, I have made it many times. Before I started I read over all the reviews and this is what I can up with after all the suggestions. 
Omit the egg and flour process, just lightly brown pork chops in pan (I use pork tenderlion, sliced thin) Then slice 1 onion, 1red bell pepper and 1 pkg mushrooms, chop 4 cloves garlic and saute all of it in pan with little olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, season all, and little sage. Use 1 can cream mushroom and 1 can cream chicken, with the 2 cups milk. Serve over rice. Turns out perfect and my family loves the gravy over the rice. In fact I am making this tonight!!

Good as is. I can't get over the way you all just change the recipe completely and then rate it!!!! Why don't you just post your own recipe? I love the recipes on this site but that is one thing that bothers me! I call it "recipe bashing!"

My husband and I love this recipe! I have made this quite a few times and always make it the way one of the other reviewers suggested:
"I didn't use any eggs or milk. I simply mixed flour, garlic powder, salt and peper together and just floured the porkchops with that mixture, no eggs. Then I browned them in the shortening. While they were browning, I dumped 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of beef broth, 1 envelope of onion soup mix, and two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms in the slow cooker, and mixed it all up. After the porkchops were done browning (about 4 min. on each side), I added them to the slow cooker and covered them with the soup mixture, and let them cook for 5 hours on high."
I also made mine with potatoes. Just scrub, cube, and toss them into your crockpot along with everything else. The potatoes turn out perfect every time!!

Making it right now.  Sounds delicious.  Maybe all the other folks that add all kinds of different ingredients should just submit their own recipe.  I tend to try others as written.  If I want to change the recipe I would have the courtesy of just offering my own, not completely changing the individuals recipe and telling everyone it was awesome.

OK:  Here's my take on this recipe.  Salt & pepper the chops before dredging them in flour.  No egg necessary.  After browning, put in slow cooker.  To drippings in pan, saute 12 oz. sliced, fresh mushrooms.  Then add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1-1/2 cans of milk, then 1 packet of onion soup mix.  Mix ingredients and bring to boil, then add to slow cooker.  I used six thick, boneless chops and had more than enough gravy.  Fork tender, no need for a knife.

This tasted really good!  The only thing I added was a packet of onion soup mix, but I would change a couple of things based on texture and visual appearance.  I found that the egg and flour coating gave the chops kind of a slimy "skin" - next time I'll just season the chops and brown them without the dredging step.  Also, instead of slicing I would chop the onion.....the slices in the gravy looked a little too worm like for me :)

This was pretty good and very easy. I made some changes to make it a healthier meal: I used thick, boneless pork chops, skipped the whole dredging/frying part, I used the 98% fat free soup, 2 cans of evaporated skim milk and added other seasonings. The meat was so tender! I will definitely make this again.

With the appropriate "tweeking" this is definitely a "5".  I shop "on sale", and found sirloin and rib chops, bone in, for $.89 a lb.  I used 11 of them (I have 6 stepdaughters, 2 sets of twins!) Cut off excess fat, sprinkled with seasoned salt and pepper, dredged in 1/2 flour & 1/2 italian bread crumbs.  Browned on MedHi in butter flavored shortening.  Layered in lg. crock pot with slivers of onion in between. (1/2 lg white onion) 3 cans cream of mushroom soup, 2 c. milk, 1 c. cooking sherry, packet of pork gravy,8 oz. canned mushroom in pan with dripping until blended.  Poured over chops, cooked on low 5 hours,removed chops and took off bone.  Return meat to pot for another hour on high.  Served over rice.  EXCELLENT!  Loved the previous reviews,.

Great recipe.  I did modify slightly..I added a clove or two of garlic, used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of golden mushroom soup.  I used evaporated milk instead of regular and added in some broth for some extra flavor.  I didn't have an onion(go figure) so I remembered a reviewer who added in a packet of onion soup mix..so that's what I did.  I needed this to be a meal so I did add in baby red potatoes cut in half..and after 9 hours everything was PERFECT texture and taste.  Great share!

I made a couple of changes. I quickly seared the chops without the breading, used three cans of low salt cream of mushroom soup to offset the package of dried onion soup mix I added, along with some black pepper and garlic powder and I eliminated the milk. It made a wonderful and very tasty gravy and the chops were so tender!

This was great!  I just changed a few things:  instead of pork chops I used hamburger and instead of mushroom soup I...LOL, kidding, don't you hate it when reviewers do that?  I took the advice of leaving out the egg and served it over steamed white rice.  Perfect!

I took a few of the other veiwers recommendations and omitted the flour, browned the onions with the porkchops and added sage and thyme to the soup mixture. Instead of milk, I substituted 1 can of french onion soup and a 1/2 cup of wine.  My family loved it!   Thanks for a great recipe!

Mom made this for my sister and I when we were growing up, now I make it for my family. I don't fry mine in shortening, I do a mixture of butter and EVOO. I do add some seasonings to my dredge (fresh ground pepper, onion/garlic powder, sometimes sage) and sometimes I'll add mushrooms or a little worchestershire to the "gravy". I serve this with mashed potatoes or rice to soak up all that yummy gravy. This is true comfort food for me.

Delicious!  I skipped the egg and flour part.  I put salt and pepper on each pork chop and browned in olive oil.  I put these in the crock pot.  In a separate bowl I mixed 1 can of reduced fat cream of chicken soup with 1 can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup.  I put in 1 cup of white wine (pinot grigio) and about a 1/2 cup of milk into the mixture.  I also threw in about a teaspoon of sage and stirred.  I cut up 1/2 of an onion and laid it on top of the pork chops.  I then poured the soup mixture on top of the pork chops.  Cooked on low for about 5 hours.  Absolutely delicious.  Very tender.  I used the sauce for on top of some mashed potatoes.  My 6 and 9 year olds loved it.  I will definitely make again!

my husband wont stop eating this and wants me to make it weekly...its great but 2 times a month is enough lol.  I did what other did.  I omitted the egg, just floured the chops with garlic/salt/pepper. fried 4 minutes on each side with canola oil.  I have a family of 5 so i used a family pack of boneless chops (9) that were on sale.  I wont use anything else btw now.

I added 3 cans of cream of mushroom (lowfat) 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1 can of beef broth (i made too much gravy, it would have been fine with 2 mushroom 1 chicken and 1 beef).  lipton onion soup packet. and pepper.  I cooked for 5 hours on high, then 3 hours on low.  I had to stir it a bit here and there.  Then added a cup of milk.  DONT SKIP THE MILK. Not if you can help it, it made the gravy 10xs better.  I also chopped a few potatos, which my son loves but also served it with mashed as my hubby loves that.  Served it with a fruit salad.  Made dinner and lunch for 3 the next day.

I read a lot of the reviews before trying this one out and came out with the perfect dish.  Trip fat off chops.  Dip into flour then brown both sides in olive oil and place in bottom of slow cooker.  Saute sliced onions and fresh mushroom and place over chops.  Mix 2 cans mushroom soup, 1 can milk, and 1 package onion soup mix in the pan and mix well getting all the bits from the chops into the gravy.  Pour over chops and cook on high for 4-5 hours.  I used 6 boneless chops and this was a great amount of gravy.  Served over rice of mashed potatoes...it's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing all your reviews on this one.

I used Jennifer's original recipe and Diane73162's version.  I've ended up with a modified version using 1 can of cream of celery soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, a 14 oz. can of beef broth and a package of onion soup mix.  It works well with or without the milk.  Substituting onion soup mix for the onion gives the final product a lot more depth and flavor.  Without the milk, the gravy ends up much thicker.

Absolutely loved this! I didn't brown the porkchops before I put them in the crock. Night before I sprayed crock with non stick. then I put garlic powedr on chops and layered onions between them. then poured soup mixture over them and put crock in fridge. Next morning I put the crock in the heater and set it on low until I came home 8 hours later and they were to die for! Served with green beans and mashed and used sauce as a gravy. Hubby LOVED this and it was super easy!

I make this all the time, but I really short cut it by not browning the chops at all. I just toss everything in the crockpot and come back hours later and it is all good. I do the same with chicken and everyone keeps eatting until it is all gone. there are never any leftovers no matter how many pieces I cook.

Holy Cow, or should I say Holy Pork Chop!! I am not a pork chop fan, though my husband and daughter are, and I LOVED this!! Like others, I made a few changes: I didn't use any eggs or milk. I simply mixed flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper together and just floured the porkchops with that mixture, no eggs. Then I browned them in the shortening. While they were browning, I mixed 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of beef broth,  and 2 envelopes of onion/mushroom soup mix. I set the crock pot on 6 hours, and left it to cook. The meat was so tender, it fell apart. I served it over egg noodles and it was a HIT!! My husband and I split the leftovers for lunch at work. I think next time, I'm going to add fresh mushrooms. And, yes, I can see this being made again and again at our house!! Fabulous recipe!!

I am always looking for recipes that I can bring over to my parents, and they can just heat and serve.  This got rave reviews from them- I mean raves.  I took the advice of other reviewers and did not do the egg dip/flouring and I added some garlic; only changes.

I always read reviews before trying anything.  Very helpful comments,,thanks guys.  I omitted the step of dredging the porky chops in egg and flour. I just seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and browned my rib chops.  Sautéed onion slices, can of mushrooms and chopped garlic in pan drippings.  I added 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken and 2 cups milk to the skillet.  I brought it to a boil and then poured it over the chops in the slow cooker.  I then added some browned bacon pieces on top.  Served on rice.  Turned out amazzzzzzzzzzzzing.

These were wonderful! No knife is needed! The only 2 things I did different was not use the egg and I used one can of celery along with the mushroom. Other than that, I followed the recipe. They were done at 8 1/2 hours. I didn't use the real thin chops, but I didn't have the thicker ones either. Kind of in between. Used boneless chops. It makes quite a bit of sauce. Think I'll use the leftover sauce with egg noodles. My husband just loved these! Thanks for the recipe!

Mmm..mm..mm! Delicious, easy, and smells wonderful.  After 10 hrs, the meat was just literally off the bone and the gravy actually cooked up into a cross between french onion soup and  stew.  I added quartered small red skinned potatoes, mini carrots and sliced a large sweet onion, used french onion soup mix, and 2 cans of golden mushroom soup (cream of is just gross) one can of low sodium chicken broth and one can of fat free evap milk, just lucious, I'll bet the leftovers will be even better today.  Thanks for sharing!

I just fixed this for supper tonight.  It was delicious!  I had 2 thick cut pork chops so I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of milk and 1 envelope of pork gravy mix.  I mixed all together and poured over the chops and onions.  It made a thick and flavorful gravy.  The chops and gravy were just perfect with cornbread stuffing and broccoli with cheese sauce!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

My wife taught me this recipe since we are both teachers and found the slow cooker to be real helpful when coming home from a busy day.(I am retired now)  I saute 2 onions and 4 stalks of celery in olive oil and I season them with garlic powder, onion powder, Mrs. Dash's seasoning and of course salt & Pepper.  After about 8 minutes I dump this into the crockpot, then layer with spuds, then the meat layered in between spoonsful of cream of mushroom soup and a can of crean of celery.  I use a shot of soy sauce and worchestire sauce and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.(I always use 1 tablespoon of brown sugar)  Cook it on high for 1 hour and 6-7 hours on low and it is a meal to write home about.....

The pork chops in this recipe are amazing, but I found the sauce to be very bland.  The second time I made it I made some changes.  I didn't bread the pork chops this time, just browned them, and then continued with the recipe.  About two hours before serving I added a teaspoon of thyme, a half teaspoon of garlic powder, a bay leaf and some salt and pepper.  This time the sauce was as good as the meat!  I served the whole thing over white rice and my husband, son and I all loved it.  I'll make this one alot!

I have made this recipe in the past, but baked in the oven. This is much easier and doesn't heat up the kitchen.  I also peeled and sliced four potatoes then layered them on the bottom of the crock pot (to cover) seasoned with salt and pepper. I placed four browned and seasoned pork chops on top of the potatoes then arranged the onion on top.  I heated the mushroom soup(healthy request) in the same pan that I browned the pork chops in and whisked in about 1 soup can of milk until heated through.  Pour over the pork chops and cook per the above instructions or until the pork chops and potatoes are fork tender.  Add a vegetable, and dinner is on the table!!

I absolutely am against canned soups...but this one is awesome!  I added a package of sliced mushrooms into the crock pot.  Next time, I think I might dice up some onions but other than that, this recipe is a keeper!  I run my crock pot practically all winter long, and this recipe will be at the top of my weekly list!

My family has been making this for years only on the stove top.  We just salt & pepper the chops, brown on both sides ( cut calories & fat by not flouring them) and then add sliced potatoes, sliced onions, and the cream of mushroom soup with the milk and let simmer. Serve with fresh baked rolls...mmmmmmm.....

Just a quick suggestion - after browning the porkchops (with or without the egg/flour) remove the pork chops from the skillet and slowly stir in the cream soups and liquid.  Then you are getting all that good browning flavor that's left in the pan.  Adds a great deal of flavor!

Followed the recipe to a "t". The pork was fork tender and the gravy was tasty. Cooked it on low for about 9 hours. Served it over wild rice with green beans on the side. We really enjoyed it.

Well, i made this and it was AWESOME! I changed a few things..i didnt use the egg..i just seasoned it with onion powder, garlic, paprika, salt and pepper. Dredged it in flour and browned it in olive oil..put in slow cooker with some carmalized onions. I used 3 cups milk, 1 cup red wine and mushroom and chicken soup for sauce. I slow cooked it for 5 hours. Serve over mash potatos. They were crazy about it. I used 7 bone in chops. They fell apart like butter.
The flour on the chops thickened the sauce.

***I admit,*** I changed it up due to what I had on hand!  Frozen pork chops, no onion and no milk.  I had 1 can of mushroom soup, so I added a can of 'golden' mushroom, no milk so I used the larger can of chicken broth.  Cooked on high for about an hour then to low for about 5 more hours.  I served it over rice and no one said a word while eating - except, YUM!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for such a great recipe - even though I did change it due to what I had on hand!

GRAVY HINT:  After this dish has cooked for 9 hours, remove the chops to another pan to keep warm in a low oven.  Then add 1 to 1 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 T. worcestershire sauce, 2 T sweet sherry (not the cooking sherry kind that has salt)  and 1 teaspoon pepper to the gravy/sauce in the crockpot.  This makes an outstanding gravy to pour over the pork chops along with the potatoes, rice, peas, noodles or whatever you're having on the side.  I sauteed my chops in olive oil after dredging in flour mixed with pepper and garlic powder (no egg). After they were golden brown, I moved the chops to the crock pot and to the frying pan I added 2 lb quartered mushrooms, 2 large onions, 1 can mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, one envelope Lipton's Onion Soup mix and 2 teaspoons dried thyme.  Mix well, heat and then pour it all in the crock pot, on top of the chops.  After that I washed and halved 5 medium red rose potatoes, and placed those cut-side down on the top of the sauce.  They steam all day on top.  I cooked 9 hours on low. This is the perfect dish for very large, very thick pork chops that, with any other cooking method, never come out tender.  These are fork tender, rich and luscious with the mushroom, onion, sherry gravy poured over.  Highly recommend!

Loved this! I made 6 thick-cut bone-in chops. I did not coat them with egg and flour - simply seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika - then browned them in butter and olive oil. Mixed 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken with 2 c. milk (wanted extra gravy). Put chops in crock pot, then sprinkled Lipton onion soup mix on top, then soup/milk mixture over. Cooked for 6 hours on low. Next time I'll trim the fat off the chops, as it made the gravy a little greasy. Gravy was very good, though. Served with rice and green beans. Even picky 15 y.o. loved it!!!

I cook a version of this frequently, but I have a secret ingredient that I'll share.  Ortega diced green chilies. Either a 4 oz can or the larger one.  It doesn't make it hot, just a little boost.  I use 2 cans cream of chicken soup, and 1 package of onion soup mix.   Wonderful gravy.

In response to another review...there is no such thing as too much gravy!  
This is an excellent recipe.  I did not however use pork chops, although I am sure it is good with them.  I used a cut of  pork that looks like a country rib without the bone.
Removed some fat then followed recipe as stated.  I shared the results with neighbors and friends, they begged for more!   A “10” in my book!

I don't use shortening, I used olive oil instead. These turned out amazing. They came out so tender they fell apart when I was taking them out of the crock pot. All I heard from my husband was "mmmmmm" and "When are you making this again?" It made so much gravy and was delicious.

Love this recipe!  I think using the slow cooker can make things bland, so about an hour before serving I add 1 tsp. thyme, a bay leaf, and some garlic powder. Then you get the flavor of the herbs with the tenderness and ease of the crockpot.

I was so excited to make this after reading the great reviews. It smelled so good as it was cooking but it was a huge dissapointment. It tasted really blah and definitely needed some salt and pepper. I even added garlic, worchester sauce and wine to sauce and it didn't help.

The family LOVED this.  My son who doesn't really care for pork chops ate three!  I've made chops with some kind of creamed soup many times and have only browned them first, but never thought to coat them in flour.  It really made a difference in the flavor!  The only thing I did differently was added a few seasonings to the flour and also had to bake it in the oven in a covered 13x9 pan since I broke the lid for my crock pot.   I doubled the recipe, but only used the two cans of soup and there was still plenty of gravy to go around.  I also put a few shakes of soy sauce in the soup mixture for a little extra flavor.  Baked it at 350 for about 1 1/2 hrs. then left it covered after taking it out of the oven till we ate about an hour later.  The chops were done perfectly..so tender they fell apart...omg i think i need to go have another one right now!!

I tried these on an awfully hot day when I refused to use my oven:  AWESOME; I added some leftover baby carrots and added frozen baby peas at the end; also used up potatoes from my garden... Once again: AWESOME.  I deglased my pork chop pan with Vermouth and added it, and a splansh of soy to the sauce.  Thank you for a GRAND recipe!

This was super yummy and easy. I did not brown the chops. I threw them into the crockpot with the 2 soups, and I only used 1 cup milk. I added some extra spices, like thyme, oregano, and some italian seasoning. I cooked it on high for 4 or 5 hours, and served it with rice. Delish!

I read some other reviews before to start. I skipped the egg part and I didn't add milk. Instead I added 1 packet of onion soup mix, fresh mushrooms, cream of mushroom soup, beef broth and cubed potatoes. It turned out perfect. Everybody loved it.

Changes as per a few other reviews, and one of my own... but WONDERFUL!  My husband thinks the sauce stands on its own as a soup, and he rarely says that kind of thing.  Both of my kids ate seconds, and even I loved it, and I'm generally not a fan of pork chops.  Changes I made: used one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of onion (hard to find, but Walmart seems to be carrying it again finally!), a can's worth of vegetable broth (the kind from the box), a package of Lipton's Onion Soup mix, 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup white wine.  While that sounds like it would be way too salty (and my husband is sensitive to too much salt) it surprisingly wasn't.  I skipped the egg wash, and just dredged the chops in flour with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  After browning them for about 4 minutes per side, I threw them in the crockpot and used the same pan to mix up the sauce mixture while deglazing the pan and getting all the browned bits.  Added sauce to crockpot and cooked on low for just about 8 hours.  They were tender and moist.  I was afraid they would be dry, but far from it!  I might use a second sliced onion next time.  YUM!!  I've got to add that I think the cream of onion is key - it adds a different flavor than the usual cream of chicken would.

This was a wonderful dish! I used 8 assorted pork chops, 3 cans cream of mushroom soup and about 2 cups of beef broth, pepper, and fresh garlic. Note: make sure to use boneless chops!!! these bones start to break off into tiny pieces from how tender it gets.

My family loved these. Running short on time, I used canola oil to brown the pork chops. Then stir fried my onion in the oil until golden. I also added minced garlic to each chop and 1/2 package of Lipton onion soup. Used only 3 large chops so cooking time was less. This was excellent and ready in only 3 hrs on high. Extremely tasty & tender. Thank you for a great recipe.

This just didn't do it for me.  It had a different flavor - almost fishy in taste and texture!  I made it as written, and I definitely think it could have used something extra to add to the flavor.  Sorry!  :(

LOVED it!  Did go with what some other reviewers said.  One can cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken instead of 2 cream of mushroom.  Also added 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix.  And, I simply browned the pork chops in olive oil without any egg, flour, etc.  The whole thing is gone and already being requested.

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this recipe.  The sauce was gritty and the onions were slimey.  Overall, pretty tasteless.  I hate to give poor reviews, but I have no idea why so many people raved about this.

I have enjoyed sooo many of your recipe's that i finally have to write to say that alot of your recipe's i substitute venison,elk, bear, etc. for the meat called for.. As an example i used venison hindquarter steaks for the pork chops... It is a healthier and tasty alternative... Don't get me wrong i will also try this recipe with pork chops at some time in the future..... Keep up the great recipe's...

I altered this recipe a bit.  Instead of dredging in egg/flower, I just seared the chops in 1tsp of olive oil.  One packet of Onion soup mix, 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 bay leaf, added 1tsp sage and thyme.  These were all suggestions from previous reviews.  What a dish!  Very flavorful!

I followed the reviewers comments and also added cream of chicken soup, mushrooms and beef broth.  I also add about 1/2 cup sour cream to the mixture, then cook for 8 hours on low. AMAZING!  My husband can't get enough of them.

Very yummy...did not brown the meat the second time I made because the first time the coating turned a bit slimey.  I use frozen meat and mix the milk and soup together before pouring over the meat.  Very easy!

This was an excellent recipe, but as some others, I did alter the recipe some.  I did not sautee the chops first.  I just put them right in the crock pot, seasonsed them with "Rib Rub" and added some beef boullion to the soup mixture.  They were done in well less than the recommended time.

Only thing I did was use olive oil to brown the chops because I didn't have shortening and it was awesome! Dad even went for leftovers the next day-that's unheard of in our house-espaecially from a slow cooker meal! Thank you!

Oh my gosh these were awesome!!! I used 3 extra thick chops, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of onion and canned evaporated milk (+ skim milk to make the 2 cups) ... I did bread the chops but didn't really notice it after they were done. I also used a Tuscan chicken seasoning before the breading and threw some in on top the gravy while cooking. I cooked them on high for almost 5 hours. These were soooo tender and the sauce was really good! My hubby's favorite pork chop recipe by a MILE! Thanks so much!

Really good w/ slight modifications.  I added some onion soup mix to the mush soup for some extra flavor.  I also added Tiger Sauce to give it a little kick..thought it was a little bland initially.  End result was great!  I used boneless chops and the did not require anywhere near the amount of time suggested for cooking.  Even my picky hubby who doesn't like anything new had 3 helpings!

I have made this for years.  I'm only giving this version 4 stars as the two cups of milk makes it too runny.  Leave the milk out altogether as the juices from the meat combine with the soup to make a nice sauce.  Don't bother with the egg and flour.  Instead sprinkle with seasoned salt and garlic powder and sear in a hot pan on both sides until brown. Place in a greased casserole dish, cover and bake with the condensed soup for an hour and a half at 325 - 350 degrees.  The longer the better as the meat tenderizes with a long, slow bake.

This comes out very tender. I usually like bone-in pork chops so I used them but not a good choice for this recipe! The meat is so tender the bone just falls out. Next time, boneless pork chops. Overall, easy recipe with little prep.

It was a great recipe. I did make a few changes. I doubled the recipe. I browned the chops with some chopped onion and garlic for more flavor. I used 1 can ea crm of chick and cr of mushroom. I also added some thyme, sage and seasoning salt for taste. The pork chopes were so tender they were falling off the bone. Used the sauce to make gravy for the mashed potatoes. Very tasty. Next time will use boneless chops. This is a keeper.

I'm not that crazy about pork chops, but this was really good.  The only suggestion I would make is to add more seasoning-salt, pepper, garlic etc.

This is an excellent recipe except two cans of soup & 2 cups of milk is way to much liquid.  One & one is plenty and makes an excellent gravy for mashed potatoes.

I was running really late one morning and I put 10 Boneless thick cut pork chops (i have a large slow cooker) and 3 Cans of Fat Free Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Sprinkle with a generous amount of black pepper.  Cooked it on low for about 8 hours and they were so tender and good. I did not fry them at all. They would fall apart when you tried picking them up out of the crockpot.  My kids ask for it all the time.

I have been cooking this for about 30 years.  I add about 1/2 (to taste) tsp of Worcestershire sauce and fresh mushrooms and sometime pearl onions.  It is a great recipe and so easy.

These are seriously good, but if you don't want to use your slow cooker just stir together 1/2 cup four and 1 teaspoon garlic powder & dredge your chops in this flour mixture. Brown in 1 Tablespoon EACH butter and olive oil. When browned, leave chops in skillet and add 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, and 1 1/2 cans milk (you can add a bit more or a bit less depending on how thick you like your gravy). Stir, cover, reduce heat and simmer very gently for approximately 20 minutes or just until chops are cooked through. (I like to turn my chops and stir the gravy after 10 minutes.) Serve over rice or mashed potatoes.

I'm one of those crazy people who likes to try recipes the way they're written and then play with the ingredients after that.  I made this exactly as stated, and it turned out ok but very bland.  It was extremely easy to make and the pork chops were falling apart, they were so tender.  But, the flavor reminded me of something I'd probably be served in a hospital.  I hate to write a negative review, but fixing this "as is" just won't work for me.

I use 5 butt chops - trim as much fat off as possible then I just layer the pork cops in the crock pot with lots of sliced onions  and salt & pepper between layers.  One can (540 ml)of ready prepared cream of mushroom soup, half cup of water and one tablespoon of minced garlic.  Cook on high for 5 hours. Half way through cooking lift each pork chop to let soup go between.  About 1 1/2 hours before they are finished add 2 cups of fresh sliced cramini mushrooms on top.  Makes wonderful gravy to serve over baked potatoes and cauliflower.  These pork chops come out moist and tender.  Turn down to "keep warm" until ready to serve. Top pork chops with  1 can French's french fried onions just before serving.  Any left overs are just as good the next day. Enjoy.

It was good, not exceptional so I didn't give it 5 stars.  I served it up with zucchini and squash which tasted delicious in the gravy.  Any vegetable would taste good in the gravy.  :)

I made this twice, the first time I made it as written and it was good but I didn't like dipping pork chops in egg so the second time I made it I didn't use the egg and I took some pointers from others who rated this dish. I added mushrooms, onions, soup, and some onion soup mix and saute all together which made an awsome gravy which I paired with homeade garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. My kids loved it and can't wait for me to fix this again.

Simple enough but really bland.  I had not read any reviews prior to making, had to laugh at one reviewer's statement about experienced cooks know how to season.  I fixed the recipe as typed, was rated as almost 5 stars, apparently 5 star after lots of adjustments.  I won't bother again.

I think it is important to note that ONE pork chop is listed at 400 calories.  This is without any rice or noodles.  Adding all that onion soup mix, while yummy, is going to kick up the sodium dose significantly.  You're already getting 1182mg and almost 25g of FAT in ONE pork chop.  Ewww.  No, Thanks.  Sounds like a once a year treat.  Don't get me wrong.  It looks deee-lish.  I just want to live a little longer than that.

I did this recipe but with alfrado, cream of mushroom soup, and I pan fried the pork chops with the bacon before I put it all in the crock pot. The pork chops were so tender they fell apart trying to get them out!

After reading other reviews, I simplified it.  I browned and seasoned the pork, and while doing that put a can of cream of chicken & a can of cream of asparagus soup in the crockpot, along with 2 cans of milk.  Seasoned, added pork, cooked for several hours.  It was so tender I shredded it in the crockpot & served over rice.  My 2 (picky) boys loved it and asked when I'd make it again.

PERFECTLY WONDERFUL!!!!! This was the best recipe ever, I always read the reviews first. I added onion soup mix, used only 1 can of mush. soup, water instead of milk, no egg, added garlic and mushrooms and it tases great!! My husband loved them, he'll probably want them again in a day or two!

These weren't as fantastic as all the reviews. I had to add tapatio to mine because it wasn't very flavorful. I don't understand what all the hype is about. I probably won't make these again.

I have been making this for years, though in the oven. It is a fool proof hit every time and I keep it in my regular rotation. I omit the egg and just season and dredge in flour before searing in a pan. Sometimes I saute my onion and 1 cup of fresh mushroom in the pan also. I bake at 350 for about 45 minutes.

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this recipe... so that I wouldn't have to throw it out, I made some of my own adjustments... shredded the boneless pork chops added salt,pepper,adobo,garlic,hot pepper flakes,sour cream,potatoes and corn. After all of the changes... it is now a tasty pork chop chowder!

Yum!  I had 4 thin chops. Placed baby carrots in bottom of Crock pot, followed by large chunks of fresh mushrooms.  Combined l can of Cream of Mushroom, 1/2 cup milk and one envelope of dry onion soup mix.  I then alternated layers of mixture, pork chop, mixture, pork chop..Added 3 chunks of butter on the top. Cooked on high for 4 hours.  Wow it was a hit! ..will cook again, but will add flour to thicken bit more!

This recipe was AMAZING! I'm getting married in the summer and am testing out new recipes. I made this for my parents and it was so moist and tender - it practically fell apart on the fork. I did change some things, however. 1) I sprinkled ground black pepper on the chops when they were frying. 2) To cut back on the fat, I only added one can of soup but I used extra milk. 3) I added garlic salt to the soup/milk mixture. It sounded a little bland so I wanted to add a little variety. I don't think it altered the taste much, but it was a great addition to a great recipe.

This was a very nice change for something a little different for pork chops. I believe the cooking time was just a little too long (I cooked them on low for the 8 hours, next time I will try more like 6.5) but they were absolutely delicious!!!

This is a very good and easy recipe.  i did season the flour with salt and pepper before sending the chops through it and I also added garlic powder to the chops while in the skillet.  Very easy and will make again and again!

This was wonderful! I used bone in pork chops and cooked them on high for 4 1/2 hours. I left out the onion because my kids don't care for them but I am sure that would add even more flavor. An easy weeknight meal!

This was a big hit in our house, made this for my wife and kids and they all loved it. Did not use any eggs, instead i mixed flour with garlic salt and some other seasonings and dredged the pork chops in that. Cooked them on high for 3 hours and low for 3 hours. The meat just fell apart. Quick and easy, and I will definiitely do use this again.

I am so happy to find this recipe.  I also learned from my mother how to make these, but I bake them in a 350 oven for around an hour.  They always taste better the next day.  We used cream of celery and water instead of milk.  I will try the milk.  The cream of celery is not as salty as the mushroom, both are still good.  I add some bell peppers as well .  Great with mashed potatoes.  You may want to use 2 cans of soup so you have plenty gravy to put on the potatoes.  Love this recipe. I will teach my son in college how to make it in the slow cooker.  Get everything prepared so all he has to do is put everything in the slow cooker.  Go to school and come back to a nice meal.  Yes  I'll make the mash potatoes for him to just heat up in the microwave

Yummy !! These were great ! I followed the recipe and didn't see a problem with the egg nor flour. Must have kept the meat together. I took the meat apart in my plate though to mix it with the yummy sauce. As suggested, I added sage, thyme and oingon powder. Thanks for offering a new way to eat pork chops ! Will definitely make again !

I think, as written, this recipe would have stank.  So for my own memory purposes, here's how I made pork chops in the slow cooker: brown chops as stated and place in CP.  Pour about a cup of wine into pan to release the fond, and pour into CP.  Sprinkle with one package Ms. Grass' onion soup mix, add one can cream of chicken, one can cream of celery, and one can (blended to disguise the mushrooms) cream of mushroom.  Cook on low for about 5 hours and serve over rice.  REALLY yummy! The whole family raved and raved.

This has been a standby for 30 yrs. at my house. But my husband & I like a delicate gravy so I NEVER ever, use Cream of Mushroom. I always use Cream of Celery & add 2 big teaspoons of paprika & VOILA...you have a perfect, easy paprika pork or paprika chicken dinner. I also just season & flour the meat, then brown. I rarely use the crockpot as this simmers well for a fast meal. Also I don't add milk. Water works great. Add a tad more salt & pepper.

I've been using this recipe since the 70s.  Lately, I have been lowering the fat by not dipping in egg, using just flour and browning in Pam.  Then using fat-free mushroom soup and skim milk.  Cuts the fat way down and don't forget to trim all visible fat from the chops.  I doubt you'll notice much difference, but your arteries sure will.  :)

I agree with others that this is high in sodium. Easy solution is to make a basic rue (trans fat free margarine, skim milk, and flour or corn starch) adding fresh mushrooms and onions. My mom makes this very recipe with cheap cuts of blade or chuck beef steak in the oven. She calls it baked steak. It is a great base recipe that you add your own veggies(potatoes, carrots, celery) and spices/herbs (garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, red pepper flakes) to the pot.

Made this for dinner and was a hit!  The gravy is what makes this recipe...or breaks it.  After reading previous reviews, I opted to skip the egg and flour dredging.  I seasoned butterflied pork chops with Emeril's Original Essence, pepper, and a little worcestershire sauce.  Then, I seared them on high heat in olive oil to seal in the juices. Off the heat, I added onion and the soup mix.  My slow cooker has an insert that can be used directly on the stove, so I was able to scrape up the browned bits and that added to the overall flavor.  You can tweak the seasonings of the gravy once it has cooked a while.  I made plain rice as a side, just so we could use more of the gravy.  Think this meal would be just as yummy with chicken.  The meat was very tender!

This is excellent! My daughter doesn't like pork chops and loved this she practically licked her plate!!  I didnt use egg that is over kill, flour sticks to meat well enough. I seasoned meat first with garlic salt and pepper then dipped in flour. Sauted in olive oil. I used 1 can crmo'mush and 1 crmo'chckn, 5 garlic cloves 1 large onion that got added to olive oil to start to carmelize it adds another layer of flavor, use 1/2 cup of milk to deglaze pan scrapping all bits up and adding to soups along with the 2 cups of milk.  We ate it with boiled potatoes and green beans.  It makes an awesome gravy we made sure to pour all over our potatoes. This is a must try!

I made these according to the recipe except I only used flour to dredge the chops and added some mushrooms.  They were ready in about 5 hours on low, but, the chops I used weren't thick.  The pork chops were really tender and stayed juicy, but, the gravy was just ok.  It was too bland for us.  I will probably try to make these again and jazz up the gravy - but, as is this recipe was nothing special to us.

This was really good but maybe a tad bit bland.  It is a great recipe for thick pork chops that I can never cook on the stove/oven/grill just right (I always get them too dry).  The slow cooker makes them VERY tender.

Made this for dinner last night. I only had cream of celery soup, so i seasoned the flour a little more, and added canned mushrooms. Browned the chops really well, added the onions. after everything was nice and browned, stirred in the soup, beer, and mushrooms to heat. Put all in the crockpot on high for anhour, then lowered to low for 4 hours. Absolutely wonderful. Pork chops fell off the bone, gravy was delicious!!

VERY good!! I too, seasoned the flour... with garlic salt, pepper and oregano before frying, then added cooking sherry, and a packet of pork gravy mix to the soup and milk, as another user suggested. Oh, and added fresh mushrooms, too...the meat just fell off the bones and I had NO leftovers! Perfect with mashed potatoes and cheesy broccoli.

This was amazing. I followed the recipe almost exactly unlike other reviewers using the same amount of milk, soup, and shortening. I did add some incredients such as fresh sliced mushrooms at the beginning. In the flour mixture I added some season salt and pepper. I also add a bay leaf, 1 tsp. tyme and sage the last hour. The pork chops I used were boneless and thinly sliced and next time I think I will use thicker sliced chops because these were so tender that they basically disentigrated. These were the only pork chops I had on hand. I served this with mashed potatos (utilizing the gravy of this recipe) and green beans. My husband is a picky eater and he raved about this recipe. Thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviewers to avoid the bland taste I read about in a few reviews.  I added sage, thyme, and garlic powder to the flour mixture, and I added half a packet of onion soup mix before I put the lid on the crock pot.  The chops were so tender, they just melted in our mouths, and the gravy is great for mashed potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again.

I took the advice of others to add more seasoning and decided to try a packet of Lipton Onion Mushroom soup mix over the top of the pork chops.  Oh, yum!  I sprinkled about half of the packet over the pork chops so I did not overwhelm my hubby...this was a big hit.  Also, I did not have 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup so I threw in one can Cream of Mushroom and one Golden Mushroom--another surprising bonus to our taste buds!  Give it a try.  It's tasty and easy!

We made this last night and it was awful.  The only plus is the meat was tender.  The sauce was all clumpy and full of soft fluff like stuff like you get when you bake a meatloaf and that kind of soft stuff is around the base of the meatloaf when it is done.  Smelled great.

My husband is always so fussy with his meat.  He never likes it quite as well in the crock pot, but I love to use the crock pot and be done with cooking early in the day.  Last night when I served these he said they were the about the best pork chops he'd tasted!  I followed the recipe except added some seasoning salt, garlic and a bay leaf.

My husband loves pork chops; I'm not a big fan. I made this one day, just as a special surprise for him. I was the one suprised -- by how simple this was to make, and by how wonderful it tasted! Even my children loved it, and they are hard to please! Prepared this for my parents the other day, to rave reviews. This recipe doesn't need any "tweaking" either, but for variety I have used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, and have added salt & pepper to the flour before dredging the chops. Definitely a keeper!

This is funny.... Well over 50 years ago on a small budget I created many recipes out of necessity.  This is one.  I also added sliced carrots and potato chunks.  Topped with cream of mushroom soup  it was delicious and my young family loved it...  A one pot meal!  Love those kind!  I still make it.  I also created turkey meatloaf in a time when the only ground turkey to be found  was Louis Rich in the frozen section in a roll.  Who ever heard of turkey meatloaf, not me? Or turkey burgers?   It caught my eye because it was so inexpensive.  So I thought about what I could make out of it...   Being so easy on the budget, under a dollar a roll it was worth a try to experiment.  What a find...  I even made turkey spaghetti sauce that no one ever knew  was turkey.  I guarantee you the pork chops in mushroom soup is delicious.  Try it with the potatoes and carrots too.  Good made with chicken as well.

This recipe is great and easy! I didnt dip the chops in egg. I just dredged them in a flour, garlic salt, pepper and paprika mixture then browned them a few minutes on each side in melted butter. Then I placed them in the bottom of a crock pot. I didn't have everything the recipe calls for so in a large bowl I mixed one together 1can of cream of chicken, 1 can chicken broth, sliced fresh mushrooms, sliced onion, about 1/2 cup milk and 1 onion soup packet and poured the mixture on top of the chops. I cooked them on high for 5 hours. Before I served them, I mixed in some corn starch to thicken up the gravy. The chops were so tender and delicious.

I have made this recipe for years, you can either cook it in the crockpot or simmer on the stovetop. Either way they come out delicious and tender. One thing I always add to give it a better flavor is Lawrys season salt. Follow the ingredients above and u can add anything else u want to ur liking.

Wow, I don't think I've ever rated a recipe on here, and this looked so mundane but all the great reviews got my interest.  My family LOVED this--I seldom get a thumbs up from my kids but they all raved about these pork chops!  I did use a can of cream of mushroom and a can of Golden Mushroom, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I think all the reviwers' suggested soup combinations make this a great, versatile, EASY dish.  This will be a regular for us!

This is a terrific recipe.  I have made it twice, and the first time I followed the directions exactly.  It was great.  The second time I had only cream of celery soup, so I used it. The chops came out even better.  We are not usually fans of recipes with cream soups, therefore, a five star rating from this household is something special.

I have not tried it in a crock pot, but will soon. I also add potatoes, peeled and cut into small squares, place them on the bottom, put the pork chops and then the soup on top. I have done it for years in a black skillet and oven. But this sounds so much easier.

I've made this for years, in addition to the cream of mushroom soup I also added a can of Golden Mushroom soup.  You can also do it in a slow oven for about 4 hours.  This is a great receipe, the meat falls right off the bone.

Overall, great recipe. I didn't dredge in flour. And I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken as recommended by other reviewers. I wish I used more of my onion (I hate cutting up raw onions and so I gave up after 3/4 of the way through). It would have been nice with some kind vegetable... maybe potato or carrots or celery.

I don't know what I did wrong but this turned out awful. My pork chops were dry and the "gravy" was super watery. I ended up shredding the pork chops and adding potato flakes to the gravy to thicken it up. I then threw in a can of french style green beans to make it a meal. We called it slop. It had a good flavor but was not what I was looking forward to coming home to. Will not make again.

So well named. I made these last week. My husband has asked for them again already. So easy and so delicious. I added onion soup mix and a little more garlic just for the added flavor. They were wonderful.

I made this tonight. I did follow a some of the other reviewers suggestions adding 3 cans of soup (cream of mushroom, cream of chicken and golden mushroom), fresh mushrooms, onion soup mix and beef broth. My husband and son loved them! The chops were so tender they were falling apart. My husband raved about the taste and said I give you an A+ and put this in your recipe book. I've tried a lot of recipes from the site and this is the first time he's give this high of a rating. Thank you very much Jennifer for the idea and thanks DIANE73162, cookiequeen and J Miller for the additions.

My Mum made this when I was a kid. She used a skillet with a cover. I always add fresh mushroom to add to what is in the soup and use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. Comfort food served with mashed potatoes.

I am not a fan of pork chops, but my family loves them. The texture has a lot to do with the reason why I dislike them.  I followed the advice from a few members and it turned out amazing.  My family knows I avoid pork chop night, and they thought I tried to trick them by using lamb instead of pork. The meat was so soft and moist like beef or lamb. The meat just fell apart without effort. The sauce was tasty over rice. I will be making this more often for pork chop night.

I love this recipe! I did try to lighten it up a bit and keep the same flavor. I used water for a portion of the milk and did not dip in egg before dusting with flour. I also added a bit of dry white wine for part of the liquid. I used an electric skillet which cut the cooking time but it still came out tender and delicious! I also tried this with chicken thighs! Great!

I took others' suggestions and didn't dip in the egg. However, I seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and flour and browned in skillet.  I then followed the recipe to the "t". My chops were dry and the "gravy" was not good at all in my opinion.  I use a similar recipe that calls for the meat to be browned, sprinkled with dry onion soup and topped with cream of mushroom and wate and it's very good.  I think the addition of the milk is what gave this recipe a strange taste.

Recipe was easy and flavorful, but I had thawed my chops long b4 I realized I didnt have cream of mushroom soup, so it was either substitute with cream of chicken, or try it in the oven....so I waited for my hubby to bring my car home from work and got the right soup...baked at 350 for about an hour, and was great. Had 4 chops leftover and gonna try today in slow cooker, hope they turn out a little more tender and a little juicier. You really can only get that from slow cooking! Other than that, it still tasted great. Will definitely make again, and I'll be showing it to my mother, who only believed in Shake-N-Bake!

This was a great meal.  This makes a BUNCH of gravy!  I had a lot left over.  I made sure to season my flour very well with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders.  I also added in a little italian breadcrumbs.  After browning the pork, I decided to sautee the onions a little and to make the sauce in the same pan to incorporate all those yummies left behind in the pan from the pork chops.  I think if you do those key things, no one would have problems with this not having much flavor.  I also did add in a half a package of onion soup mix.  These pork chops were so tender they were falling apart.  When I went to serve them they were all in pieces, instead of whole, from being so tender!  I served over mashed tators with all that extra gravy.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family LOVED these!  Even my picky 2 year-old!!  I did vary mine slightly also...I made it similar to another review with no eggs, I used Lipton onion soup mix and 2 cans of cream of chicken and 2 cans of mushrooms.  I also put it over brown rice and poured the gravy over top.  SO GOOD!!!  We had more gravy than we needed so we saved the gravy and made grilled chicken breasts and poured it over those and rice.  Amazing even the second time around!!!

This was tasty but bland. I added a package of onion soup mix to the milk and soup before pouring it over or I think it would've been even more bland. Great concept and the chops were so moist.  I breaded the chops just as directed. Loved all the gravy. Served it with rice but it definitely needing something.  Next time I think I will add some paprika and/or a few dashes of hot sauce. Also needs salt.  Will definitely make again.

We all loved the pork chops.  I followed most of the other reviews.  I just browned the pork chops (no eggs or flour).  I added fresh mushrooms, onions, garlic, red peppers and I even through in the potatoes, since I had to work right up until dinner.  It was great.  Thanks for recipe and the comments.

I didn't want to use the canned COMS so I used 2 cups of leftover "Cream of Mushroom Soup I." Great flavor and I love the gravy/pork chops with rice. Served with "Roasted Beets 'n' Sweets" and "Sweet Baby Carrots."

I'll give this a 3 star rating, because the chops were very tender, though I couldn't taste the flavor. I guess all the flavor was in the air permiating thoughout the house. Not sure if I should Kinda disappointed. If I make this again, I will add the dry soup mix to it.

This recipe is bland.  I guess I should have known what to expect after looking at the ingredients.  It tastes like soup with a pork chop in it. None of the four eating it liked it and said toss it in the pile of recipes not to try again.  No spice, no taste.  Took way to long to make for the lack of flavor.

With a little tweaking..this recipe can be an even bigger hit!! I skipped the egg & flour part and just browned the pork chops (boneless) in a skillet. After browning them on both sides I put them to the side. In the same skillet I added a tbsp of margarine and sauteed onion, green and red bellpepper, & 2 cloves of garlic until tender. In the crockpot I put 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken soup w/ herbs, 1/2 can of rotel tomatoes, 1 pk of onion soup mix, 1 can of milk, 1 cup of chicken broth, season all (mccormick), pepper, parsley, then the sauteed veggies. I stirred it together and then I added the pork chops. I cooked on high for 2 hrs. and on low for 2 hrs. If you try it let me know what you think.

YUMMY! and so easy and quick to prepare. We seasoned the flour mixture, before we coated the chops, with  fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and a little cayenne.  Made the chops a little more tasty and we served this dish over rice which was great with the gravy it made!!

I agree with Rosanne and riggs10. I alwasy follow the recipe exactly the first time ...THEN change it to suit our personal taste. Granted, some people won't eat onions, etc. so omit them, but keep the original recipe in tact as much as possible.  I now call this My Gravey Pork Chops.

This is a great, quick recipe that I have made for years on my stove top in a covered frying pan, cooking on low for 3 to 4 hours.  I brown the chops first, add the ingredients and also add about a pint of sour cream.  The gravy is wonderful.

Finally, I made pork chops as good
as my mother-in-law's! I love her but I was getting tired of hearing my family say my pork chops weren't as good as Grammy's. I followed the recipe but I cut it down for 4 pork chops.  They were fork tender and the sauce was delicious over rice.  Thank you Jennifer

I did just as others have said.  First Sautee onions and some mushrooms in pan.  Set aside.  In same pan add mushroom soup, only 1 cup milk, and packet of onion soup mix.  Cook for about 5 minutes.  Add everything into the crockpot and wala....a very, very delicious dinner.  I added some chopped fresh parsley to plated pork.  Follow these instructions and I gaurantee you'll love it!!  Oh yeah, and this really only needs like 5-6 hours of cook time on low.

We enjoyed these.  I used what I had on hand, which was 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of golden mushroom.  I only used 1 cup of milk and it was plenty.  Skipped the flour/egg part and just browned the chops in olive oil with garlic salt and pepper.  I'll probably serve these over egg noodles next time.

With a family of five, I love easy, slow cooker meals, but I know better than to cook meat soaked in cream-of-anything soup. I'm very surprised this recipe has such rave reviews. I will not make this again. It was absolutely horrible, but like I said....I know better than to cook meat in cream-of-anything soup.

I loved this recipe!  Of course, I tweaked it a bit.  Here are my tweaks/suggestions:

1. I did not use flour or eggs when browning.  I just seasoned and browned in olive oil
2. I used WAY less milk.  Probably about 1/2 to 3/4 cup
3. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of potato
4. I used Vidalia (sweet) onions - 1.5 to 2
5. I added fresh garlic and sliced potatoes on top of the pork chops

The leftovers were even better than the original. It had time to "marinate"!

Not a very kid friendly dish, my husband didn't like it much either.  The flavor was bland.

These were great, very tender. The family 9even the kids) loved them but first they had to get past what they looked like. I will make these again but add some more flavoring.

My husband had last nights dinner of this again tonight - and he hates leftovers - but LOVED this! I too added a pack of onion soup mix and I added a package of "McCormick's" Hunters blend/sauce.  I forgot the onions, but they weren't missed.  I did bread my boneless chops by dredging in flour then egg then Italian style seasoned bread crumbs.  I think next time I'll just try browning the chops without  coating them - and see if it's missed . . . OH and I'll be adding some freshly sauted mushrooms as my hubby requested too.

Wonderfully tender meat that fell off the fork.  I used boneless chops and skipped the onion.  I also replaced the flour with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and fried them for 5 min on each side in vegetable oil.  They turned out great and I'll keep this as a favorite.

This is great recipe - which is similar to the recipe for "Baked Pork Chops I"...only this one allows you to "fix it and forget it".  I plan on using this quite a bit this coming winter for those days I don't want to spend in the kitchen!

An excellent recipe - an innovative use for the crock pot, and very delicious! I've made this 3 times and it gets high praise every time. The last time I made it I skipped the egg/flour/fry portion because I was in a hurry, and they turned out just as good!

I made these for dinner last night and was VERY disappointed.  My family would not eat them.  The gravy was lumpy and watery.  The meat was tender but I have other recipes that are much better.  Definately will not make this one again - at my family's request!

I made this again for Valentines day and my husband raved that he would pay $30-$40 for the meal at a restaurant and still would be impressed by it. I saute some garlic in olive oil, then add the pork (rub some salt and pepper on the pork first) and saute until each side is browned. I then put the pork in the crock pot, sprinkle sage, thyme and more pepper on the pork. Then I add the onions, soup and milk. Wonderful! Makes a great mushroom gravy that goes great with mashed potatoes.

This recipe is very rich and creamy!  Almost had a hard time figuring out which was the pork and which was the mushrooms because the pork chops fell apart completely.  Next time might trim the fat from the chops.

Reminded me of growing up!  Followed instructions to a T.  Very good hearty comfort food. Thanks for sharing!

And I will add - read several reviews, to those foodies who just couldn’t help themselves from changing and adding .... I say —- submit your own recipe!   The fun is trying a recipe for what it is. 
If you don’t like it, so be it , say so and then submit your own version!!!

Chops came out great falling off the bone and the gravy was excellent. The only thing that I would change is that the meat itself needed a little seasoning before going into the egg batter and flour.

This was a big hit even with my picky eater and it was so easy to make.  The only "change" I  made to the recipe was I layered the bottom of the slow cooker with the onions and placed the pork chops on top.  I have found this stops of the bottom of meats from becoming mushy.

Next time I will add the 2nd can of cream of mushroom soup, we didn't have enough gravy  the next night when everyone wanted leftovers.

These pork chops had a funny, weird taste to them! The recipe has such simple ingredients and I love them all individually; but, the meat actually became mush and the texture became like fat. Did not care for this one at all, sorry!

Very easy and yummy!!!  I changed the recipe to make it even easier.
In the crockpot, I add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 2 cups of milk and add onion, fresh mushrooms and a pork roast. I put it on low all day, The pork just melts in your mouth!! Your house smells amazing too!!!!!

It was ok, not amazing though. I don't think pork chops work that well in a slow cooker... they turn out much better in the oven so they can get some crisp going on the fatty side.  I'd rather use another type of meat in a slow cooker, like beef shin or lamb knuckles.

This  was delicious!  My intentions were to go by the recipe exactly but I like Adolf's Pork & Poultry seasoning so I did add it to the flour.  I also used only 1 can of soup & 1/2 cup of milk & there was plenty of gravy.  The other thing that I did, unintentionally, was "blacken" the chops a little but it actually added to the taste.  This recipe will be under "favorites" in my Recipe book!  Thanks for sharing Jennifer.  I meant no disrespect to you or your Mom on tweaking it, just a little.  :)   I prefer more seasonings on everything.

I was a teen the first time I prepared this meal. I have a SUPRISE ingredient which adds a rich flavor level to what can be an otherwise bland recipe. I tend to be a "confident" cook and among other things, I don't measure many ingredients.  Season and  brown the chops (with or without flour). Place in baking dish. Cover with Large planks of sweet onions. Now,in a bowl, combine can of mushroom soup and PEANUT BUTTER, yes, I said PB. Beat together with a little milk to thin a bit. Pour over meat/onion. Cover with foil, bake at 350*.  Remove foil last 10 minutes to brown top.  Of course, this can be adapted to the crockpot, too!

I have made this recipe for 40 years but have added cream of chicken soup and 1/4 to 1/3 cup of katsup. .Never added eggs or flour and it came out just perfectly. It can even be put in the crockpot. Yummy recipe.

This recipe as written I'm sure it very good but I did make the changes suggested by the other reviewers.  I omitted the egg and just dredged the chops in flour.  I used 2 cans cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, 1 can beef broth, 1 cup milk and a packet of onion soup mix.  I omitted the onions but next time I will use them.  I would have liked the gravy to be a bit thicker, so next time I'll whisk some Wondra flour into the gravy before I pour it over the chops so it thickens as it cooks.  Also, you MUST season every part of this recipe...season the chops, the flour and the gravy.  I seasoned everything with salt, pepper and Adobo.  I am only giving this 4 stars because I had to make the changes.  My whole family really enjoyed these and I will be making them often.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Oh, and I cooked them in the oven...covered for 1-1.25 hours on 350.

I didn't use pork chops for this recipe, instead I used a pork shoulder because it was on sale.  Plus I am not sure how pork chops would work out in a crock pot, they might get to dry.  I also added an envelope of onion soup mix for extra flavor.  I then thickened the gravy with some corn startch.  Really good with rice!

ALTERNATIVE:  I make something like this but instead I pound chicken very thin, salt and pepper and cook in butter (or veg. oil) until brown.  Remove.  slice some mushrooms in pan add Cream of Mushroom soup, 1/2 cup or more of Marsala wine throw back in the chicken and POOF you have Chicken Marsala of the fast kind.  You can also throw in fresh garlic in the butter, cook a little then put in the mushrooms than the soup, wine and there you have it, simi homemade.  :)

This recipe was a family hit. I made some changes according to the reviews and what I had on hand, but very close to the recipe. It was easy and good. My family liked it A LOT (I thought it was good, just not as good as them). My kids called it salisbury pork chops.

My family absolutely love this recipe. I add two cans of whole potatoes and a spoon of Gravy Master to the recipe because my family doesn't like the appearance of the  white colored gravy.  The Gravy Master does the trick.

My husband and i arent huge fans of pork chops, but that was what we had in the freezer and i didnt want to make boring old pork chops again. found this recipe and WALLA! its now a favorite. i did make it differently as a reviewer suggested. I didnt use and egg. I used flour, garlic salt, pepper and a little lemon pepper. floured the chops than browned them on each side for 4 minutes. in the meantime i cubed up about 5 potatoes and put that on the bottom. set the pork chops on top. Mixed together 2 cans cream of mush. 1 can of cream of chicken 1 can of beef broth and a packet of onion gravy mix. poured it over and mixed it up. than i sauted about 3/4 white onion and minced garlic and poured it on top! and MMMMMmmmm! it was delicious! after 5 hours the pork chops just fell apart! Very very good. My husband ate 2!

This is similar to an old stand-by of mine...I put pepper and garlic salt on both sides of porkchops, don't bread them, and brown them in skillet. Then, mix a can of cream of mushroom soup (2 cans if I do a lot of chops) with GOLDEN mushroom soup, chopped onion, a soup can of milk, canned or fresh mushrooms. Put in crockpot at least 4 hours on high, usually do high for a few hours, then low for a few more. This can also be made in the oven, cover with foil, 350 degrees for an hour or so - the longer it cooks, the more tender it is. The soup makes excellant gray over mashed potatoes, and is really good served with peas. Golden mushroom soup has wine in it, and it adds a really good flavor - not the same without it!

Ooh these were really good!  I skipped the breading and browned in leftover bacon grease from breakfast (I'm sure that didn't hurt the flavor at all!)  I also added some white wine to the 'gravy' - cooked on low so long they literally fell off the bone.  Will def make again.

I followed this recipe exactly except I added fresh mushrooms, and instead of cooking it in a slow cooker, I kept it under very low heat on the stove top for another 45 minutes.  The pork turned out moist and tender.

Very good.  Love coming home to a great smelling house.  Only changes: added a packet of onion soup mix and sliced mushrooms.  Used 8 boneless chops about 1/2 inch thick.  The amount of gravy was perfect.

I made this recipe a few days ago and it's now a favorite. I used half the amount of meat but the same of everything else so we had extra sauce to put over rice or potatoes. The meat is soooo tender and flavorful you want to savor every bite!  And it was super-easy!

I've been making something like this for years. As I can't tolerate the smell/taste of mushroom soup, I use cream of onion soup, plus use some white wine in in lieu of some of the liquid.   I do the same with chicken, too.  Yummy!

I changed a couple things. Instead of using 1/2c Flour, I combined about 1/4c bread crumbs, 1TBSP parsley, a little onion powder, and about 1/4 cup crushed cheesy-garlic salad croutons. It was delicious!! I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of shortening. I only put in 1/2 an onion and added 2 cloves of garlic (diced)... If I don't make this again, my family will string me up by my feet and play Pinata!!

The only problem was too much gravy even with the mashed potatoes.  Very delicious and tender, loved it!

I think this is my favorite way to make pork chops!  It was very easy and tasted wonderful.  The chops were not tough at all.  Everyone loved it!

Followed the recommendation of just using flour to brown the pork chops. Didnt change anything else. Was great! Husband commented a couple times on how great it was.

Great pork chops with a yummy sauce. I did not dip in egg and flour. I did brown the chops before putting them in the slow cooker.  The pork chops were very tender and the sauce was great on the rice.

This was pretty good.  I didn't coat in egg and flour, i just seasoned with salt and pepper and browned each side in butter, because I didn't have shortening.  It's something good when you need a meal to come home to. I love my slowcooker.

Awesome. The best pork chops I ever had from a crock pot. Very tasty and tender. I'll make this again and again.

We loved this...Although i did not bread it with the egg and flour. I just browned it in some oil first after seasoning them, then i put some oinion soup over it in the crock pot. added the milk and soup  mixture and let it cook on low! it was super tender and super yummy! I suggest seasoning the porkchop before browing..I did pepper,season salt,some old bay, and a little bit of garlic powder!
Served with rice cabbage and kandid yams

Delicious. I made slight changes.  Instead of browning in shortening, I used 1 teaspoon butter & 2 tablespoons EVOO.  Browned the chops (I did not use egg & flour) slightly.  I sliced one large, Vidallia onion - put 1/2 into crockpot, chops on top, remaining onions.  Mixed 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of mushroom with garlic soup & one cup of milk, salt & pepper.  Poured over chops & onions.  Cooked on high for 4 hours.  Wonderful gravy!!

Took others' advice and added dry onion soup mix, some beef broth, and used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken.  The pork chops were fork tender and very tasty.  Good comfort food on a cold winter night.  I shredded the left over meat and added some broccoli florets and egg noodles to the gravy.  It made a yummy pasta dish for lunch the next day.

Made it as written, and it came out great.  I'll probably adjust the spices to my own taste.

One thing I should have done was trim the fat on the chops - the gravy was a little greasy, but that was my fault, not the fault of the recipe.

This is great when you are tired of chicken or beef all the time.  I do use the drippings from searing the meat to add to the milk mixture for the soups,giving it just a bit more of that yummy meat flavor.  Even the kids like it, which you know makes it a keeper!  Thank you!

These were pretty good. I did add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms, and only used 1 can of milk. I cooked on high for 2 hours, then turned it on low for about 4 hours and the meat was so tender it was falling off the bone! About an hour before they were finished I added several tablespoons of sour cream. I served this with potatoes and a salad. Easy and good recipe! Thanks!

These were very good. I had fairly thick pork chops so it turned out more like individual pork roasts. For the sauce I added  1/3 milk, 1/3 chicken stock and 1/3 white wine to the mushroom soup. I had thought that a whole onion might be too much, but it worked out well in the sauce. This was great next to a serving of creamy mashed potatoes and a salad. Oh, and it was very quick and easy!

Used olive oil instead of shortening to brown the chops and forgot to use the egg.  Made 6 chops and wanted lots of gravy so I increased the soup to 3 cans and added a bit more milk.  Overall this was a fabulous recipe that I will definately make again!!!!

It is easy, and the flavor was pleasant enough, but it in no way resembled pork chop.  Onion and mushroom completely overwhelm the pork.  I'll not make this again, although I may try it with chicken.

Easy, good, but a little bit lacking.  Maybe some spices or O'Brien potatoes?  I'll try that next time.  Or serve it with rice and veggies....

Very good, but I thought they could use some seasoning.  I added a little S&P but next time I will season them well with S,P, and garlic powder. Great served on rice and with a fresh veggie.

This was pretty good. I like not having to cook the main part of the meal at dinner time. Thanks for sharing.

My chops turned out quite dry for some reason (I browned them quickly first - could that be why?).  The meat was tender - falling apart, but dry at the same time, if that makes any sense.  The gravy and onions are wonderful though.  I may substitute with another kind of meat next time.

This recipe was very tasty, but needed some salt and pepper. I will try adding the onion soup mix next time.  We enjoyed it very much.

I just made this for the second time and it turned out great again!  I did read the suggestions and added about half a packet of onion soup over the pork chops (I used the butterfly cut ones) and used about 1 3/4 cup of milk.  My husband and I would recommend this dish!

I have been doing this for a while but I usually don't dip in eff or flour and only use about a 1/2 cup of milk and mine always come out great moist and tender.

My family and I really like this one - I usually braise the chops the night before and mix the ingredients in the slow cooker - Then in the morning pull it all out of the frig and mix together - the house smells so good when we get home from work.  Thanks for a great simple recipe

It doesn't get any easier that this.  I used natures seasoning and a little salt and pepper.
It was still mildy bland. Will spice it up a bit next time.  Some advised the chops fell apart, mine were firm but easy to remove from the bone with a fork.  Just a bit dry but the sauce covers this up.  Prepared egg noodles and placed the chops and sauce over these.  Will definately have this again.

My husband loved this dish, he even commented on it the next day. We both couldn't really move after we ate it, the dish was very rich and served with Sourdough stuffing it was also very filling. I used another can of soup and it was a little thick, I think next time I'll add another cup of milk a few hours before serving.

Doubled servings size so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. Added 1 packet of dried onion soup mix. Seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, and Adobo seasoning. I served over white rice. Was very good,

I've made this in a slow cooker but I had a recipe for these pork chops that also included adding smooth or chunky peanut butter if you prefer to the crock pot. The finished product with the sauce turned out so delicious served over mashed potatoes, so yummy.

I made this last night. It was great! I used 6 rib eye chops/After browning the chops, I removed them and saute the onions, mushrooms etc. then added soup til well blended Then I added the chops back in and simmered for 30 mins. Plenty of sauce. I used noodles with the sauce and put some on the chops and served with early young peas. Thank You Jennifer. It was very Good!!!

I didn't use egg/milk, and I DIDN'T FRY the pork chops first. I put the thawed pork chops right into the slow-cooker along with the rest of the ingredients. I also ADDED 4oz. Cream Cheese...  (The cream cheese and mushroom soup together made a delicious gravy!)

I made this with six pork chops rather than four because two cans of mushroom soup plus the milk is a lot of soup. I skipped the egg bath and simply breaded them in flour and fried them in butter not shortening in a cast iron skillet at the same time as I cooked up the onions and then I put them in the Crock-Pot with the soup. It came out fantastic and I will definitely make it again.

Very good!  Easy too, even better.  I have made a version of this before but this is much better. Because today’s pork is so tough I have to do it in the crock pot so this is a keeper for sure!

I am not a recipe cook, but did closely follow this one, and as we live in a small village in the Andes @ 8000 ft is a challenge at times. We get our pork from friends that have a finca and raise all their hogs, so I can get 2" cuts or get them to cut to order. I had these cut abt a half inch thick. My everyday oil is extra virgin olive, but also use canola for obvious reason. This time I did use shortening as the recipe called for. Seasonings are always used to individual taste but mine are soy, fresh garlic, and fresh cilantro, salt and pepper. I used part heavy cream and milk. I notice many left out the egg wash but I did use it and since my chops were not as thick, I cooked them in my slow cooker for a bit less than 4 hours. Delicious and very tender. I did notice criticism of other chefs that tweaked the recipe were uncalled for, and suspect those are not very experienced.

The BF really liked this dinner. I did follow suggestions for more flavor ( onion soup mix, sage and bay) because I didn't think just the cream soup would add enough pop. I only had two thick pork chops so just used one can of soup and traded the milk for veg broth because the man isn't too keen on gravy ( I know...crazy ). I wanted to make it a meal for him because I was working late, so I tossed in baby reds, baby carrots and whole mushrooms. The meat was tinder and the sauce was nice, I think it would have been better with thinner chops. Thank you for sharing!

This is a good recipe and came together well.  But them I tasted it.  It was very bland, but after I added some garlic salt and dried basil it was much improved.  Still, I don’t think that I will make it again.

I did this all on top of the stove.  I skipped the flouring and egging of the chops in order to cut out a few carbs.  I seasoned them on both sides with salt, pepper, and Trader Joe's 21 spice blend.  I browned each side for about 6 minutes on medium heat.  I used the mushroom soup undiluted covering the chops.  Brought to a boil, covered the pan, and turned down the heat to simmer for 45-60 minutes depending on the thickness of the chops .  Last 10 minutes I threw in some sliced fresh mushrooms.  The chops were fork tender and delicious.  The sauce that was formed from the soup, onions, mushroom and pan juices  made a fine gravy.

It is a wonderful way to fix pork. I do use pork steak instead of chops. With a new crop of vadalies (spell?) onions  about here. Yum Yum Can't wait.

Delicious and I grew up eating chops cooked similarly. They were done in the oven, though. Sometimes, rosemary was added, sometimes a bit of white wine.

This recipe was good, but not exceptional.  I wouldn't make it for guests.  Hubby liked it.  But then, he likes anything with gravy over it.   I followed the recipe exactly.  Then, later added some chicken bouillon and white wine.  My additions definitely improved the taste.  I guess my real complaint about this dish is that it is so very bland in both flavor and appearance.

To add to my review that apparently you can’t create a new paragraph......the fam loved this but here’s some tweaks that will gave them raving: when browning the chops, add 2T garlic salt, 2T lemon pepper, 2 cloves garlic (crushed), and lightly brown on both sides. Place contents of the pan into the crockpot, then mix two cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1C milk, 1/2 C half and half, 2T beef bouillon, and 2t fresh parsley with 2t fresh basil. Blend well to eliminate clumping, pour over pork chops, and cook on medium heat for 6-8 hours. Perfect recipe to make ahead and throw in the crockpot on your way to work. By the time you get home, the house smells heavenly and there will be no leftovers.

Super yummy!!  After removing chops from the crock pot, I added a corn starch slurry and some spices to make a gravy (salt, pepper, paprika, italian seasoning).  We really enjoyed and will make again!

So simple, yet oh so good! Because I had gotten a container of assorted chops, I added a can of mushroom soup and extra milk. I think the next time I'm gonna try it with chicken as it makes a wonderful gravy!

Just sautéed some mushrooms, chopped a bit and sautéed them in butter. I slow cooked the mix on high for about 4.5 hours, give or take, and added the mushrooms in the last hour. Made some mashed potatoes as a side. It was delicious! I had to change the milk and cream of mushroom to match the two 14 oz cans of the soup I had. So it was about 2 3/4 cups of milk to the two 14 oz cans. I didn't think the sauce was too thick. Maybe a little thin as a gravy as I like to use the leftover juice or soup consistency as, but it worked and it was delicious. My cats thought so, too!

I almost always a follow the directions to a tee the first time I make a recipe.  I did so with this one  and it came out pretty good. The pork chops literally fell off the bone.    My hubby loved it.  I will certainly make it again but will leave out the flour and egg.  I questioned that step as I was doing it but went ahead anyway.   I will us olive oil and just sear the pork chops before placing them in the crockpot.  I think it also needs some veggies and will add them next time.  Maybe even try Lipton onion soup mix instead of mushroom soup mix.  There are so many ways this recipe could be made.  Thanks for sharing it!

My wife and I loved this recipe made with the following changes by J Miller. I mixed the flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper, no eggs. I browned them (about 4 minutes per side). I dumped 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of beef broth, 1 packet of onion soup mix and 2 cans of mushrooms into the slow cooker and mixed it all up. I added the pork chops and cubed potatoes and covered them with the soup mixture and cooked on high for 5 hours. Everything was delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I originally made it for a group home for homeless women that are transitional that I work for.  I thought it would be different instead of baked chicken or smothered pork chops or tacos. I did not have the flour so I used buttermilk pancake flour and dehydrated onions. Not only did they take their sweet time eating the chops, they even got spoons to scrape the slow cooker.  

I doubled the recipe since I am cooking for 12 women.

I am making it again by unanimous request.  I am using regular flour and I am using real onion.  I am going to let them decide which version they liked best.  I did not give them the ingredients from last time.

Love this recipe as is but I have also used some of the reviewers ideas too.  Love the ideas to change up a recipe for a little variety.

My husband loved this, I thought it was okay. I don't know what I did wrong. . . though I did do some things differently. 1) I browned the pork chops in butter, not shortening. 2) Per Diane73162's review, I added cr. of mushroom and cr. of chicken soups, a can of beef broth, and an envelope of dry onion soup mix. But it needed seasoning. The first bite I took, I said, "Wah! This needs SALT!" Next time, I'm adding some salt right to the "gravy" before it begins cooking. Or maybe next time I'll just follow the original recipe. Like I said, though, the hubbers really loved this even without the salt, so that's all right. :)

OK. I did not use the egg. I did sear them on both side first. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Very good taste and the chops were tender. I well be doing this again!

Very good and easy recipe.  I like it for the "fix it and forget it" quality.  When I cooked it for the recommended time it was more like chunks of meat in gravy which still tasted really good you just didn't get a pork chop in one piece.  I suggest watching it closely the first time you cook it to get a feel for how long it will actually take in your crockpot.

Pork chops came out ever so tender and tasty but I have to agree, it was not necessary to flour and brown and only 1 can of mushroom soup used for 4 chops.

This is such a great recipe.  I did one thing different.  I dredged the chops in graham cracker crumbs instead of flour.  Then browned them slightly.  Put them in slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  Yummy!

Very simple to make and the house smelled so good while these were cooking.  The flavor is wonderful and the chops were tender and moist.  I followed the recipe except I fried my chops in canola oil instead of shortening.

This has been a family favorite for us for years. It makes some moist and yummy pork chops that are a good filling fall meal. I've cooked these both on the stove top and in the crockpot. I always caramelize my onions before adding them to the pork chops. Equally, I add fresh sliced mushrooms and sometimes white wine. Yummy!

We love it but made a few changes.  1st used 3 large boneless Chicken Breasts instead of Pork Chops. Made up like recipe but made these changes: added a little pepper in the flour mixture, Chopped Celery along with the chopped onion, In a mixing bowl mixed the milk, Soup and added 2 teaspoon of dry onion soup/dip then pour over chicken/onions/celery. Cooked in the crockpot on high for 2 hours then turned down on low until it was done. Served with potatoes.

My husband and I lvoed this recipe. I did fix it the way recommended by "J. Miller" and I thought it gave it a lot of flavor. I added no salt at all to the recipe but since it was still a little to salty for our taste next time I will use low sodium soups. Other than that we LOVED it! A winner!!

We did this on the stovetop due to time contraints but I had a few thoughts... boneless pork chops would be best, DH was having trouble trying to gnaw the bones clean from his pork chop! ^-^ The drippings from the chops added some flavor to the sauce just from cooking stovetop but next time I'd rather cook in the CP for ease and to see how all the flavors really mesh together. I also added a drained can of mushrooms when I layered the onion over the chops (to try and ninja in more veggies).  It was very good, and the sky's the limit on seasonings for personal tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and easy to make.  I used 7 boneless pork chops and dredged in flour seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic powder (no egg).  Meanwhile, I sauted an 8 oz. package of mushrooms and set aside. Then I sauted the onion (which I coursly chopped) and 3 cloves crushed garlic.  I combined the cream of mushroom soup, milk and 1 envelope Lipton onion soup mix and warmed on top of the stove. Layered the porkchops, onion/mushroom/garlic, then sauce, and cooked 9 hours in slow cooker and served over rice.  Consistency was perfect and everyone enjoyed it.

I followed the suggestion of some of the other reviews.  My addition was a 1/2 cup of red wine into the sauce. I seasoned my flour and just coated my pork chops in the flour and the browned them in olive oil.  After that I sauted a package of mushrooms and added that to the crockpot with the pork chops.  Next I mixed together 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup with a package of Onion Soup, 1 1/2 cans of milk and half a cup of red wine.  Cooked it on low all day and it was yummy.  The pork chops were so tender and everyone in my family loved them.

Omitted the flour/egg dredge as per previous reviewers.  Added chopped garlic, onion, mushrooms, green and red peppers plus a little bit of sage, pepper and seasoned salt. Was outta milk so added one soup can of water and one soup can of half and half which made it too liquidy, BUT it was very tasty!!!  : )  Man this would be an awesome soup!!!  (as I devour the gravy)

For years, I have been making a rich variation on this recipe by: sprinkling pork chops with Aromat for Meat and paprika, sauteeing them in butter,rather than shortening, and using either fresh or dehydrated (bottled)chives instead of onion. I also add 1-2 tablespoons of cooking sherry or dry white wine, as well as canned or butter-sauteed fresh mushrooms to the mushroom soup mixture, sometimes adding 2 tablespons of blanched/slivered almonds, and serve it over brown rice with either Le Sieur Early Peas or steamed broccoli as side dishes.

Also make this but just brown chops, add mushroom soup(s), depending on how many I'm serving.  Then cook packaged noodles, drain and add to the wonderful gravy and serve.  My kids grew up on this and has been a family favorite!!!

I make this all the time only I use thin-sliced boneless pork chops seasoned withe salt and pepper. I cook them in an electric skillet and then add a can of cream of celery soup that has been mixed with half a can of milk. I add some sliced onions and sometimes will add curry powder to switch it up a bit. Serve over rice. This is a very quick and easy dish to make if you don't have much time.

This is great starter recipe.  No egg needed.  I added garlic, season salt, fresh ground black pepper and some red pepper flakes.  So tender!  Can I do steaks this way?  :)

Excellent meal.  A lot of prep work because of having to flour then fry chops before cooking is the crock pot.  But, otherwise a great dish.

I used boneless pork tenderloins, and I cooked it on low for 6 hours.  The meat was falling apart it was so tender.  This was a great recipe.  Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.

As some cooks suggested, I used boneless pork loin chops, light Catalina dressing and pineapple chunks, cooked on high for 4 hours in the slow cooker and then thickened the sauce with cornstarch. The meat was very tender and flavorful - everyone liked it served over brown rice.  Will repeat and try the Russian dressing/apricot version.  Thanks.

This was bland and runny.  I had to add a ton of corn starch and some frozen veggies to get it to thicken up.  Hubby liked it but I didn't.  Probably will make again but alter it greatly.

The first time we did these we stuck to the recipe.  This time I am trying it with a pork roast.  I did add some season salt, garlic salt, Cavender's and onion power to the flour.  I do think that you don't need to use the egg or the flour.  Either way it was awesome!  We serve it over egg noodles.  Thanks for this and I will keep making it for a long time to come!

I used olive oil rather than shortening. I only had one can of soup, and it was cream of broccoli. One can was plenty for our tastes and probably cut the sodium in this dish by 1/2.  It was very good. 4.5 stars. If you have the time after work, I would make "Baked Pork Chops I" instead. It's basically the same recipe, but you bake the pork chops for about an hour instead.

Took some of the suggestions of others - I used just shy of a soup can of milk (what I had left in the fridge), a half soup can of sherry, and subsituted cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic soup. Also added garlic powder and seasoned salt to the flour, fried the chops in olive oil. Used only 1/2 an onion (didn't want the onion/garlic flavors to be overwhelming). Good homestyle meal, very flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

Overall, this is a good recipe. The gravy is pretty runny, so I would recommend that you put some of it aside in a pot once it is done cooking, then add some flour and/or cornstarch to thicken it up. Also, the cooking time is a bit long. Our pork chops were done in 2.5-3 hours cooking them on high in the crock pot, not the 4-5 hours the recipe said. We also added some fresh onions and fresh mushrooms to the recipe. Mmmmmmmmmm! I would make it again with the modifications.

Although I added some spices to my flour mixture, and I forgot to add the milk this reminded me of what Mom used to make.  I ate with fried potatoes using the gravy on top of the taters.  Really yummy!

I never have good luck with pork chops.  But this recipe was pretty good.  I'd make it again.

We loved this recipe. We did what others suggest and skipped the egg/flour thing as well as added some spices and seasonings like onion/garlic powder. I had the perfect amount of gravy when following the recipe exactly.

They were dry, but tasty.  Made a lot of "gravy" which was good on the mashed potatoes I made to go along with it.  I didn't use as much onion as the recipe called for.

So good. I cut the recipe in half and left out the onion. I used a thick boneless pork chop and they were sooo tender. My husband and I loved them!

I used a med. onion and followed the recipe exactly.  Found the onion flavour too strong.  Was ok but I don't think I will make this again, too many recipes to try.

I left mine in the slow cooker about 8 hours.  The pork was very tender.  WAY too tender for a pork chop.  The flavor of the onions and soup was really strong.  The sauce was thick and gooey. I did not like this at all. The flavors were pretty bad. I wont make this again. However, I think cooking pork for barbeque or something would be a good idea as it becomes so tender.

I followed the directions exactly and I also did not think that the pork chops were very tender and I had them on low for 8 hours.  Maybe it was because I used a thick cut pork chop.  The only one who did not complain was my husband who thought it was okay.  Sorry

I use one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom because that is all I had.  They came out good - very tender.  Tasted great but definately not a 5 star.

This recipe was awesome to say the least and it was so easy, too.  I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of mushroom with garlic soup and one packet of onion/mushroom/garlic soup mix.  I also added two cartons of sliced mushrooms.  I think the mushroom put out a lot of liquid so I had to thicken it up a bit at the end.  It was soooooo yummy!

This is my families favorite meal.  It is a bit bland, but i added salt and pepper to taste, and 3/4 cup of white wine in the beginning, and 3/4 cup white wine in the last 10 minutes. Great if served over rice with the gravy.

Okay, always nice to have dinner ready when you get home, but this had too much gravy- one can soup, 1 cup milk might have been enough, and my pork chops seemed to done. Also a little bland, but not bad altogether. Good idea that needs improved upon.

I made this recipe just as it was posted with the exception of mixing in a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the mushroom soup and milk. It was really tasty and my company loved it also. It is definitely a keeper.

This recipe called for entirely too much liquid.  When I made it the chops were almost in a soup.  I then added cornstarch to make the soup more like a gravy. I would suggest using just the soup and not the milk and just about 10 min. before serving stir in one container sour cream.  It is both thicker and richer than milk.

Had a pretty good taste, but nothing really special. In all fairness though, I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom-don't know if that had anything to do with it or not.

These were very easy and I used cooking spray and low fat soup to lessen the fat content. I also didn't have 2 cans of cream of mushrooms, so I used 1 can of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. I didn't use the suop for gravy, but it seems it would have been very easy.

My family loved this dish! The sauce made a nice gravy for the potatoes and it was easy to make. I took some tips form previous reviewers by adding sage and thyme to the soups and browned the chops in butter and onion. I also chose not to flour the chops and they turned out great, very tender!

This recipe was disappointing.  Although it was easy to make, and the meat was very tender, I thought the taste was bland and boring.
