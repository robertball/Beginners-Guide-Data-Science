Without any seasoning, this veggie dish is bland as written. Just adding salt and pepper would be a step in the right direction but bolder use of your preferred seasoning(s) will make a remarkable difference in flavor. We used fresh broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, not frozen. The appearance and taste of this dish would be improved if the vegetables were first combined with the cream sauce before placing in a baking dish (used a 9" x 13" since no size is suggested). Pouring the sauce over the top of the veggies as instructed results in veggies being unevenly coated with those at top heavily sauced and those at bottom with little or no sauce. The directions are unclear as to whether the cracker crumbs are spread over the cream sauce or the vegetables . . . doesn’t make much difference if made as written as the veggies and sauce need to be stirred-up anyway.

We liked this a lot. I used fresh not frozen veggies and because I forgot to pick up the crackers at the store I used french fried onion rings.Lovely creamy sauce that pairs perfectly with the vegetables.

I recommend using this recipe as a starting point, as it's a wonderful opportunity to get creative and use up the vegetables in your home. As long as you stick to the roots (mayo, sour cream, buttery crackers) then the vegetables you use are negligible. I always make it with fresh veggies. I like to roast eggplant and zucchini with olive oil and italian seasoning, sauté onions, mushrooms, and garlic, chop up a tomato, and add shredded chicken. These variations are still full of calories, but they get the vegetable nutrients in as well, and everyone in my house LOVES it!

Changes.....added 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream because it looked a bit dry. Mixed everything together well and topped as directed.  Everyone loved it, even the little kids.

Melts in your mouth! The cracker topping completes this dish. Yummy way to get the kidlets to eat their veggies. :)

As written this is not a 5 star recipe. It’s good but it needs some spices to it. I made as written and will make it again, but next time adding some seasoning to it. Great base though.

I never knew vegetables could be so good. This is the best veggie dish I’ve ever encountered. The only change I made was to add a bit of smoked paprika. The crumbled Ritz cracker and butter topping is so rich and caloric that I may experiment with using less butter the next time I fix this. I served it at a small dinner party, and this dish was VERY popular!

I quadrupled this recipe and made it for the first time for a church function. There was nothing left, the pans had been scraped clean. It was delicious! I will be making it again for two different family Christmas dinners :)

Fatteningly delicious. This probably has about a million calories but I could have eaten the whole pan...yum! I added a potato, corn and some zucchini to the veggie mixture.

This is the best recipe for a veggie casserole. I have used it for summer squash and other veggies when I didn't have the California blend. This recipe is so easy. I did not use the crackers and topped it with shredded cheese. I also added garlic powder.
