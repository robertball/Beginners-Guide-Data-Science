it was DEEE-LISH.  i did halve the mayo tho and i added more 1% milk and vinegar but not much. probably had to do that bc we only used 1/4c mayo.  i may even cut the mayo completely next time bc you don't need it.  i don't like it thick but you can taste and decide consistency as you are preparing.  i put in a lot of pepper also b.c i like kick.  i also made it night before to let marinate longer.  was worth the wait.  the 30+ guests at our father's day bbq were RAVING and honestly, once they found out it was almost fat free, they used the slaw as salad dressing for the garden salad we served and we didn't even open the dressing bottle!!!  the yogurt makes it a meal in its own right but as a cole slaw, that's a bonus.  i ate it with spare ribs and was awesome.  my hubby put some on his pulled chicken sandwich and others followed suit and loved as well.  it was a big hit -- no leftovers!!! fyi- we are a relatively healthy bunch who avoid extraneous fat and grease.  this slaw has tang and kick, no oily pool of yuck on your plates. it was not a hard sell to get everyone to eat yogurt and cabbage once we told them it wasn't your avg fat laden slaw!!!

I made this with freshly grated cabbage and carrot mix and it was really good.  I did approximate measurements it and make 1/4 of the recipe. It was still pretty 'wet' and I prefer my cole slaw with not so much dressing, but the flavor was really good.  As a bonus, you don't use as much mayo. An excellent side to go with BBQ chicken.

We loved this tangy coleslaw. It was a pleasant change from coleslaws that incorporate mayo and a good side for fried chicken.

I used half the yogurt. I also used more cabbage, one whole head along with a large onion and several carrots. I made a huge batch. Seems like this recipe needs more cabbage. Makes a lot of dressing even with half the yogurt. I also used sugar instead of honey and added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. Turned out to be the the best coleslaw I've ever had!

Was really good. Did not add any milk but did add about a TBS of sugar to sweeten it just a tad without adding too much of a honey flavor.

You can do away with mayo, I added 16 oz. Greek yogurt and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. Add more honey if you like it sweeter!!

I made half a recipe and used no fat Greek yogurt, light mayo and no milk. Definitely let sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving, just like with any Cole Slaw. This was tart; I felt like the honey didn't thoroughly mix with the yogurt/mayo combo.  Next time I'll use a sweet non fat greek yogurt and leave out the honey, I think the flavors would mix better. This is a good, solid recipe that is easy to customize for your family's tastes.

This is a nice option for healthier coleslaw.   I did not feel the need to add any skim milk because I prefer a creamier base for the coleslaw and the end result was wet enough.  Thanks for sharing!

I reduced the amount of slaw mix and I shredded my own cabbage (half a head) and carrots.  It tasted good before I put it in the slaw.  I let it sit in the refrigerator an hour for flavors to meld. It was too runny and did not taste good to me.  I think I'll try again with the full amount of everything.

I liked it, but my 8yr old coleslaw-loving kid didn't. Might have been the vinegar. Will leave it out next time.

I used only half of the mayo and spiced up some organic fat free Greek yogurt with Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt onion powder, pepper, and some stevia.  I also added some raisins.  It was amazing!  I will make this again.

Deeeelicious!  I am NOT a super healthy eater but had some cole slaw mix left over from making Chinese Egg Rolls at for New Year's 2016 and decided to try this to comply with my New Year's Resolution to lose weight and eat healthy!  Used Fage 0% Fat Yogurt and only a fraction of the mayo (1 Tbsp to 6 oz. yogurt).  Next time I will leave out the mayo all together!  Used stevia instead of honey.  Also added a half a bag of julienned carrots.  It was amazing!  Tasted almost exactly like regular cole slaw but without coating your tongue in heavy oil!  Very, very FRESH tasting!  Try this even if you aren't a healthy eating freak!

Simple and delish.  I didn't add the milk as it was creamy enough without it.  I shredded a head of cabbage and added carrots and green onions rather then the bags of pre-package mix.  It went well with 'Best Potatoes You'll Ever Taste', 'Flank Steak a la Willyboy' and 'Sloppied Flank Steak Sandwiches' all AR recipes.

I basically reinvented this recipe. I used no milk and no vinegar. It was good (and simple) so I looked for similar recipes - to help figure out what I might have missed. Started adding a bit of vinegar and Bingo. 
I use this as a sandwich topping - especially for hot pastrami.
