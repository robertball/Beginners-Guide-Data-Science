Very unusual- no one was sure what to think looking at this in the bowl but once people tried it it was gone in a flash.  Its a great holiday type recipe- I served it at a Christmas party and it really fit the bill.

Yum! People didn't really know what it was. Thinking it was just cranberry sauce it got skipped over. Needs a label or something if you are putting on a buffet. Was really tasty though.

My sister, Jenny, brought this to our Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious.  Like she noted in her review, nobody knew what to do with it.  In addition to dip, it would make a great cranberry sauce or used in place of jelly/jam in other recipes.  Very flavorful!

I made it exactly as written.  Took it to a "Red Hat" party and it was a hit.

I froze the leftovers of my homemade cranberry sauce (Pear Honey Cranberry Sauce) after Thanksgiving & thawed them to use in this recipe. I decreased the sugar to compensate (my sauce was already fairly sweet), used white wine vinegar & omitted the food coloring. I tried this w/ mini pretzel rods & w/ square waffle type pretzels & prefer the square ones because the dip clings to it better.  Thansk for a tasty, seasonal dip, Grace Yaskovic!

I love this recipe.  I tried it for my annual Christmas party last year and will definitely make it again this year.

Very unique appetizer. I made this for my family's holiday dinner.  I thought the dip was delicious, and many people tried it, but it wasnt really a huge hit.  I might make it one more time. It definitely gets points for being different.

Excellent appetizer recipe.  Served at our 2011 Kentucy Derby Party and this dip was definitely the winner.  Great thing is you can fix ahead.

I am a big cranberry sauce fan and I adore this dip.  It is a bit different because of the ginger and mustard.  Whenever I make this, it always vanishes off the buffet.
