AMAZING!!!! I did do some things different. I let it come to a boil then I put into a baking dish with a lid and put it into the oven at 325 degrees for 2 1/2 hours.  I also added Lipton onion soup mix on top and instead of white vinegar I used apple cider vinegar.  I also added carrots.  It came out delicious, and I will be making this again and again!  thank you :)

Simple, delicious, made it as the recipe was posted. Note: A cast iron dutch oven + the vinegar in the recipe can cause the meat to have an "off" taste. This is better suited for a ceramic slow cooker.

I enjoyed this quite a bit. I'm a tough scorer, so 3 stars for me is pretty good. I don't understand the sitting in the fridge overnight though. In theory it must be to absorb more flavor, but I found it to be opposite. It tasted better to me fresh off the stove than refrigerated till the next day.  I made a large enough brisket were it lasted 3 days for leftovers (I'm the only meat eater in the house besides my dogs LOL).

Dear god. I'm not much of a chef, but this was the best  thing in the world. Simmered that  for probably 3.5 hours, and the 8 people at our super Jewish Seder party loved the hell out of it. Such a simple recipe and so amazing. Totally making this again pretty much every five minutes for the rest of my life.

Please, please do not drop the salt to 1 tsp.  This is MY recipe and if 55 people gave it 5 stars and it was not too salty for them, my guess is that you bought the wrong brisket.  You CAN NOT buy the corned beef that comes with the spices - you MUST buy fresh, 1st cut brisket from the butcher.  This recipe can be made the same with up to 6+ pounds of brisket with no additional seasoning if you wish.  I made 3 huge briskets for the holiday and had only a morsel left.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I followed it exactly, except that my brisket was 6lbs, so I added a little more water to the pot. I used homemade spicy ketchup, and raw apple cider vinegar. It was perfectly seasoned, and very tender.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I am saving this one!

I bought an 8 pound brisket & cut it in half.  This gave me a chance to try the recipe twice & have plenty of leftovers as most said that was the only draw back... not enough left over.  Both briskets turned out super and I know this is going to be made again & again.  Thanks for sharing!!!!   Amazingly easy to make.  I made exactly as the recipe was written.

This was wonderful.  The only changes I made were that I added the onion and garlic while I was browning the meat.  I also used chili sauce instead of ketchup.  Definitely a keeper.

I have made this brisket for the past 2 years for Passover Seder. Both times it has come out beautifully!  Instead of cooking in a pot on the stove I browned the meat in a pan and they placed the meat in a slow cooker for 12 hours on low.  This is perfect because I can start the meat in the morning before work and it is ready when I am ready to have guests over in the evening.  The meat is tangy and sweet.  This is perfect served with Cole-slaw.

Fabulous! I made it in a pressure cooker and it took about an hour. When I took my first bite it made my mouth sing! I can't wait to make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it is a keeper.  It was easy to prepare and it came out tender with plenty of flavor.  I did add and extra clove or two of garlic as we love garlic.  The leftovers will definately be used!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was excellent!!!  Many years ago I cooked a few meals for our local synagogue gatherings.  One meal was a kind of sweet and sour brisket.  The brisket meat came from a famed kosher butcher shop in NYC.  Along with the meat came a suggested recipe.  Recently when I bought a brisk, I was trying to remember how I made that brisket.  Finally I gave up and came here for ideas and found this recipe.  Can't say it's the same recipe but the results were the same.....an outragious tasty piece of meat.  The only very minor change I made was using more fresh garlic.  Aside from that followed the recipe to the letter.  THANK YOU SOOO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE Louise!!!!  

EDIT: I had made corned beef hash out of the left overs.  Used diced potatoes, onion, and red pepper fried up together.  It was great.  NOW HERE'S THE BEST PART!!!  I had some left over hash and about a cup of left over juice from the original brisket (couldn't bring myself to throw it away)  Long story short.  Makes GREAT SOUP: Dice up 2 russet potatoes, 1 large sweet onion, 2 carrots, and 2 stalks of celery.  Put in pot with 1 cup left over juice and just enough chicken broth to cover the veggies well. Cook them until tender and then add the leftover hash.  OMG...the soup IS SOOO GOOD!!

I followed the recipe and directions to a T. Absolutely delicious and amazing. I made no modification what so ever. There were no left overs at all. I had it with BBQ baked bean, coleslaw, corn bread and for desert peach pie and vanilla iced cream. Thank you for this awesome recipe that I will not only use time and time again in the futre but I will also share with those close to me.

Today I looked up recipes for Brisket, clicked on this one and found it to be the same recipe that I have been using since the late 90's. It is my go to recipe for the holidays.  I brown the brisket in onions and three cloves of garlic. I also double the sauce and cook the brisket for 3 hours on the first day. I cool it over night in the sauce, slice then cook for an additional 1 1/2 hrs to 2hrs the second day until its fork tender. It's amazing!  The longer it simmers in the sauce the better it tastes. I have also cooked it  with carrots and potatoes which I add on the second day of cooking.-Jdee

So simple, yet so delicious!  My husband RAVED about it!  All 3 of my kids loved it, including the picky eater!  I followed the recipe exactly except for letting it sit overnight, and I cooked it in a crockpot all day after browning it.  My  husband WANTED the leftovers the next day, but there wasn't enough left for a whole meal for him; we ate THAT much.  I made it earlier this week, and I'm going to use the same sauce recipe today for a pork shoulder roast and make pulled pork sandwiches.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This is really good brisket!  I added quite a bit of extra garlic, browned the meat in a skillet and cooked it in the slow cooker for about eight hours on low.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

I would highly recommend! I tweaked the recipe a little bit and it came out REALLY amazing! I used 3 lbs of brisket (trimmed), used 2 cloves of garlic, added 1/2 cup syrup (log cabin 'natural' brand), and added 2 cups of coke zero to the called for ingredients. I also didn't add salt.  I threw all of the ingredients in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 14(?) hours before transferring it over to a pot and placing it in the fridge.  You'll definitely need to let this dish sit in the refrigerator overnight... after six hours the fat didn't solidify enough to skim as I've done in the past with other dishes.  The final result was an amazing dish that my boyfriend and I were both impressed by.  I made the changes to the recipe trying to make it similar to a recipe I tried in the past that I forgot to save and couldn't find.  This will be liked but all, trust and believe that! : )

Wow, did this surprise me! I've made beef in the crockpot before, and to me most recipes end up all taste pretty similar. This recipe, however, is much different. Its very tangy and sweet which was so delicious! I just browned the meat and threw the rest into the crockpot and turned on low for 10 hours. With a side of garlic red potatoes, this meal will make my mouth water whenever thinking about it. I think this might be a good sauce for pork shoulder too, which could turn into shredded pork sandwiches.

This is a wonderful recipe and a great treat for the taste buds. We had a small passover this year and I decided last minute to go with brisket for main course. Not a scrap left on the platter!!!

This was awesome!  I browned the brisket and then put it in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients for about 9 hours on low.  We ate it the same day.  Even my fussy 3 year olds liked it!

This is GREAT!  I made it also with other cuts of meat...this is perfect.   I added more everything...I love vinegar...tripled it and added 1 c dark brown sugar...the whole bulb of garlic and 4 onions...it's a keeper.  My John, LOVED IT...fantastic with roasted veggies..any kind and garlic.  Thank you for posting!

I followed the recipe except I added a little bit extra vinegar. I found the beef to be too sweet and too tough. I had to cook it for much longer than the recipe called for. If I make this again, I would definably cut back on the brown sugar. It was almost like eating candied meat, the more I ate, the sweeter it got. My family echoed my comments about the sweetness.

This brisket was a big hit at my house.  I only made two small modifications.  I used beer in place of the water, and subbed Splenda Brown for the brown sugar.  It turned out fantastic -  There were NO leftovers.  Thanks, Louise!

Great recipe.  The only thing I did different was to thicken the sauce so that we could enjoy more of it with the brisket.

Delicious.  It definitely took more around 3.5 hours of simmering to get tender.  The vinegar plus sweetness combo in the sauce is perfect.

I made this for my family and they loved it. I simmered it the three hrs. and sliced it up,put in the frig as per recipe. But later doubled on the sauce and finished it in the slow cooker on low for 10 hrs. It turned out really tender and tangy.

The recipe is solid. The meat turned out tender and the sauce was balanced with its various flavors. The reason I give it one star is hopefully due to a typographical error. To add 1 tablespoon of salt for any recipe you better be making pickles or serving 20. This was almost inedible as written. The salt quotient was so high that we had to mitigate the leftovers with plain tomatoes to make it even remotely edible. Anyone attempting this recipe should reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon and adjust at the close of the dish as needed.

So good and so easy.  I didn't have time to let it sit over night.  So I cooked it this morning starting at 9.  Got it sliced and in the fridge by 12, reheated it for dinner at 6:30.  SO GOOD.  Even my picky eaters devoured it.

I don't think I've ever really had a brisket so I bought one and decided to make it.  I chose to make this recipe.  It was very good, especially made by someone who didn't know how it should taste.  My family loved it so I guess it turned out right!  I will make this again!

Very tastey and tender.  Will definately make again.  I fogot the salt, but we didn't miss it.  Though I did use a kosher brisket, so it's kind of already "pre salted"

This is one of the tastiest dishes I have ever made! I'm not Jewish and I was not familiar with cooking brisket this way. Man, what I have been missing! Every family member I've made this for has loved it. It's so much fun to find a new dish to make. I did put extra garlic and I used apple cider vinegar. Thanks for sharing!

PERFECTION. I followed this recipe exactly as it was printed. It was fantastic. Letting it sit overnight made a world of difference. I couldn't believe how much more flavorful and tender the brisket had become. Mine was only four pounds since there were just my husband and I. And my husband, for years, talked about wanting a  Sweet and Sour Brisket. THIS was the dish that brought back the most wonderful memories for him. It was such  joy to see him so happy, especially during the Jewish New Year. Thank you for sharing it. (To those not accustomed to a Jewish Sweet and Sour Brisket, this may be too sweet. But really, it's authentic. Be sure to use WHITE vinegar as apple is not bracing or sour enough to compensate for the sweetness of the brown sugar. And do use a tablespoon of salt. Less, and it won't be right at all.)

This came out delicious. I also browned the meat first and put everything into a dutch oven in the oven, since this way you don't have to watch it. I added chunks of potatoes which also came out delicious. You could add other things like chunks of carrots, peppers, etc, so you have a meal in one pot.

This is a fabulous recipe. The brisket was so tender and flavorful and with the gravy it was just melt in your mouth good.  I followed the recipe as written except for storing in the fridge.  We will have leftovers so I will be making meal sized portions to freeze for lunches at a later time.

My first brisket for Passover. Everyone loved it. I didn't slice onions small enough so I put them in a blender at the end to purée a lot of them. If possible cook in advance so slices can sit in juice overnight.

WOW! Always had my grandmother's and mother's brisket, so it was gonna be hard to live up, but this super easy recipe was a huge huge hit. Made it exactly as is, although cooked longer... 5 hours on the stovetop, then put it in the fridge for two days, then cooked another hour or two the day of serving. Will be a new family tradition!

Excellent!  Used brown sugar Splenda but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was great.

YUM! Used palm sugar in place of brown sugar (lower glycemic)and cider vinegar in place of white. It was great! Sauce got a little too thick towards the end. Yummy recipe.

I absolutely LOVED this! The piece of meat I had was only a bit over 2 lbs, and I used that and the full amount of the other ingredients, along with a lb. of carrots (which came out almost candied and were great! Cooked it for 2 1/2 hrs on medium and couldn't resist, so didn't do the overnight thing - no need to - it was terrific!

This brisket was out of this world.  My boyfriend is Jewish and grew up eating brisket, but I am not super familiar with Kosher cooking.  I gave this a try and WOW!  It was so delicious and tender.  I'm sure I'll be making this again... only next time, I will try making my own corned beef first out of London Broil, or perhaps another cheap piece of meat.  Can't wait, and will update!

Didn't change a thing from this recipe.  I did however brown on the grill rathar than in the pot. (personal preference). I even upsized the amounts and it came out perfect.  Ive been trying to find the perfect brisket recipe for years and this is it.  Now will be a family favorite forever!

I followed the recipe exactly and brisket came out great. It was smelling so good after 2 1/2 hours that I had no patience to let it cook for another 1/2-1 hr although I probably should have to make it even more tender. In any case, it got very high compliments from everyone who had tried it.

I cooked the brisket exactly as the recipe suggested and it was fantastic. I would make it again. My husband said it reminded him of the brisket of his youth at a restaurant in Chicago. It was delicious and very tender.

I only changed the type of meat. I used a pot roast. This is delicious. It is better the next day and I will be making this again. I’m going to add carrots and new potatoes next time.

My go to brisket recipe. Instead of 1 cup ketchup, I use 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup chili sauce. Cuts down on the sweetness and adds another layer of flavor. Easy and delicious!

I have been on this site for almost 10 years and this is my first post. I’ve made some great recipes on here but this one blew me away. I made the worst brisket last year in the oven, it got all dried out and nobody ate it so for the first night of Hanukkah I wanted to make it up to my family. Well, they told me hands down it was the best meal I had ever made! Followed the recipe exactly as directed and it couldn’t have been easier or more delicious. Thank you!

I had something similar to this at a friend’s house. They had baked their brisket somehow but I figured I would make this & see if it was similar. It was close but not quite as good. In any event, I had a 2.5 lb brisket & made exactly as stated (I did not reduce the sauce ingredients).  After 3 hours I figured it was done, rested it then sliced. It was tasty but not as tender as I had hoped. I sliced the leftover beef & refrigerated it overnight in the sauce In a casserole dish. Day 2, I heated the casserole at 350 for 40 minutes....it was definitely better...so tender & flavorful. So I think slicing it & waiting a day to eat it adds a lot to this recipe.

My kids generally don't like big hunks of meat. They think it is hard to chew and jus doesn't taste yummy. They love this! Plus, I make the leftovers into pot pie and onion soup. This feeds my family of 6 for 3 dinners.

I cut the salt in half -- otherwise made exactly as written. Delicious. Not a scrap left. Will probably decrease the water by about 1/3 cup next time so my gravy is a little thicker. So good! Thank you!

I added 3 pinches of dried chili pepper seeds (type you put onto of pizzas) added a little kick to it. Super simple to make and it was GREAT!  Super moist, tender and great flavor. I am keeping this recipe for repeat and have shared with family.

I changed the vinegar to white wine. Very tasty. I will make this again. Just enough tang-good with a bit of barbecue sauce for a sandwich or good as a stand alone.

Turned out great, made it for Easter. We were tired of traditional ham or lamb cycle. Tender ,Juicy, big hit! Changes OH YEAH...recipe was for a four lb. brisket. I did a 10 pounder . Stole the cook times and temp and method from Blackjack Brisket.(kinda) pan browned, 275 degrees , foil covered, baked 7 ,hours.(no beer)  Seasoned it with Pappy's Prime Rib Rub before browning, substituted red wine vinegar, head of garlic and , followed rest of recipe ( X3 amounts) and added multi-colored carrots for flavor and color.

Excellent recipe.  So simple.  Not sure the cooling is a requirement, but helps remove excess grease.  Made it as written.  Wife said I nailed it again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Definitely will fix again.

Absolutely delicious.  Tender, improved flavor the second day.  I just should have used a deeper cast iron than just my large skillet.  I made quite a mess!

Yum! Made for Easter Dinner and was a hit. Great flavor.  Browned and simmered in large skillet with lid. Sliced and chilled overnight.  The next day, skimmed the fat and baked 300 for couple hours before serving.

I made this  with our Easter dinner and everyone  flipped! My son said that this will now be his birthday dinner request for the rest of my life  Lol.  I did not change a thing except I made it early this morning then put it in the refrigerator and heated it up just a half hour before serving it. I had 20 people for dinner and everybody said it was the best brisket they ever had. This one is a big winner !

I didn't change much about the recipe except I halved it for a small brisket.  That worked out fine.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This was delicious and super tender. I made it almost exact to original recipe. I used brown coconut sugar instead of what was listed and added chopped fresh carrots to the juice and served over jasmine rice. The carrots were divine! But I think the coconut sugar needed to be adjusted to a little less. I have another one in my oven right now with adjusted amount. My house smells as incredible as did the first time. Thanks for sharing this gem!

I am ashamed to say that at 65 years old, this is my first brisket that I have made.  It is for Passover/Easter and it is delicious.
The recipe was so easy to make and the smell is tremendous in the kitchen.  The only problem I had was purchasing the brisket.  It was a  6 pounder (the only one)  and I had the butcher cut it in half.    (we are empty nesters) I cooked one and froze the other.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!

Made this according to recipe. I used 1/2 Tbs of salt.  I did add some mushrooms, not carrots.  Cooked about 2 & 3/4 hours.  This does turn a piece of inexpensive meat/brisket into a very good dish.  I trimmed the brisket of excess fat diligently before cooking.  The 'rest' overnight in the sauce, I'm guessing, is to infuse and 'pickle' the beef in the vinegar?  I will make this again and cook more toward the 3.5 hour time.  Thanks for a memorable recipe.

I'm not a great cook, so I'm leery of recipes. But I made this for upcoming Passover, and it's delish. So easy. The trick is to be patient and slow simmer as long as it takes to get fork tender, which could be over 3 hours.  I used a thin cut of Angus beef brisket. Remember to sear it first on both sides before adding the other ingredients. I used a Dutch oven with a cover. I substituted apple cider vinegar and used 2 large vidalia onions. Thank you for this recipe! You've made a cook of me at last!

Used a slow cooker,  6 hours on low was a little too long but still delicious.  I did use 2 tsp. Salt instead of 1 T and I think it was just right.

How did Howard Wolowitz stay so skinny, with Mamma Wolowitz cooking Brisket like this for him all the time?  YUM!  This was amazing!  And I believe the overnight waiting period is driven by the fact that it seems to get better every time you heat up the leftovers.  Will definitely be making it again and again.

My Guests RAVED!!  I followed the recipe.  But I worried that I had overcooked the brisket.  So when I sliced it and put it in the 9 x 12 to sit in the fridge - I added a can of beef broth to make sure it was moist.  And it was!!  This one gets printed to put in the "family favorites" binder.

I LOVE THIS. I've recommended this to family, friends and coworkers. Perfect amount of seasoning, sweetness and flavor, and oh, so moist. Can't go wrong with this one. 
We've even brined it raw in all the ingredients then smoked it on the grill.  I used the liquid to baste every hour and heated it to be used as a gravy. 
I've also quartered some potatoes and cooked them in the liquid too! Next time I'm going to add some carrots and cabbage! Fresh mushrooms! Get creative with this!

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that the amount of vinegar made it too sour. I realize it's a sweet and sour recipe, but it was overwhelming. I ended up having to add more brown sugar. I will definitely make this recipe again - the meat was moist, juicy and fell apart - but I will probably use half the amount of vinegar. Good recipe tho!

I bought three briskets about two pounds each, total six pounds. I increase other ingredients proportionally. I browned per the instructions. Then using big crock pot, I started this the night before my dinner. In the morning I took the crockpot out of frig to let it get closer to room temp. So as not to break the crockpot I started it on keep warm, then low, then high to cook, then back to low until tender. It was a BIG hit. My son sliced it. The two 18 year old girls who were helping in the kitchen nibbled and nibbled before dinner. Everyone enjoyed and remarked how good it was. I have maybe one slice left over. The extra sauce I put on my potatoes and onions. Delicious!!

WOW!! I know everybody loves this one so here are the tweaks I made.  I cooked a 3 1.4 lb. brisket for 3 hours then I put it into the fridge (always better the second night).  When ready, I removed all the fat, moved the brisket to the cutting board, added 2 tbsp butter to he sauce began reducing. While the sauce reduced to half, I sliced the brisket across the grain.  When the sauce was reduced, I added the sliced meat back to warm.  Served over egg noodles.

I made this for a commencement celebration and EVERYONE loves it; many asked for the recipe. It's delicious. It's also very easy to make, but be sure to remove the fat.

Although I was skeptical at first about the idea of sweet and sour flavors in brisket, I made this and took it to a Chanukah dinner.  Jews and gentiles alike loved this dish!  A couple of minor deviations.  First, I started with a corned beef brisket (all I could get on short notice).  After boiling, I removed the brisket from the boiling liquid, sliced, and placed in a dish with cooking liquid to cover.  I then refrigerated for only an hour before the party and re-heated in the oven until boiling again.  I served it with some of the cooking liquid thickened with cornstarch to make a "gravy".  Delicious!  I will make this again, certainly.

The best brisket I ever made but I used 6 onions instead 2 and didn't use any water. The onions have plenty of water and 4lbs serve 6 instead of 10. Helene

I was hungry for waffles but I did not want maple syrup on them; I looked for a recipe for fried apples to use as a topping and found Sautéed Apples. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written; it does not take long to prepare and the apples with the sauce taste great. My entire family loved it and requested me to make it again!

Slow cooking the beef brisket is the key to a savory brisket. This recipe was good but I still haven't found the recipe that was as mouth watering as my aunt's at passover. I think I might be missing the sweet wine.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I sprinkle the meat with onions soup mix and then pour the sauce over the meat.  Cover tightly and roast in the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  It has to chill overnight in order to slice easily and cleanly.

One of the best briskets I've ever made. There wasn't even a shred of meat left either time I made it; second time I cut back some on the sugar but preferred the taste of the first one.

Used ingredients listed, except I was out of white vinegar, so I substituted apple cider vinegar. I put the brisket in the crockpot and then mixed the remainder of the ingredients together and poured over the top. Cooked on Low for 11 hours and then followed the remaining instructions. Meat was delicious and I didn’t have to babysit it at all by using the crockpot!

First brisket I ever made, and it was superb!
Made it like the recipe except I didn't have enough catsup so I added some chili sauce to make the 1 cup. It was tender and so delicious. Served with roasted carrots and asparagus, and mashed potatoes.

Great for  this year’s last night of Hanukkah party. Only change I made was to use white balsamic vinegar.  Not sure it improved it, but it didn’t hurt.

This was a very good and easy recipe. I did use apple cider vinegar instead of the white and we ate it the day it was made instead of letting it refrigerate overnight. The only thing I would probably change is after slicing it I wouldn’t put it back into the sauce. It was good for the original cook but I felt it was a little overwhelming in the end. I would’ve liked to taste the actual meat and not just the sauce with the texture of meat.

This is the best brisket and the best recipe out there. I make it every year for the holidays and it’s a hit. If you cut it and freeze it ahead of time it is even better when you warm it up for the holidays.

Loved!! I do have to admit that my review is mostly for the sauce, because unfortunately I did not have beef brisket and used chuck roast (came out delicious cooking it as the recipe states, though only for around 2 hours). The sauce has a delicious home-made barbecue taste to it, but I personally had to make a slurry (2T flour + 2C of the sauce) so it would be more on the gravy-ish side. This will be made again!

Excellent!!!!! So easy and so delicious!!! I've made it twice so far and will continue to in the future. I used cider vinegar only because I didn't have any regular vinegar on hand. Also I didn't have time to let it rest overnight but I will try that as I'm sure it will only make the flavors bind together to make it even more delicious. So delicious you have to make this! Thank you for the great recipe!

I  would put 6 stars if I could. Supper.
I followed recipe and only thing I did different,  I baked it. Came out Supper!
I made it second time and modified it slightly: onion and garlic I chopped in food processor to almost liquid conciseness. Also I tiny sliced small onion and put it on the bottom of aluminum form, then put a brisket and pour  sauce over it. Covered form and baked for 2hrs at 375F. Then sliced brisket and baked another 2hrs. Came out supper! ! !  However when I reheated it next day it came a little bit dry.  Next time will need to experiment with it or even better, cook at the day of party. It is a super-duper recipe!!!

Perfect! My family loved this recipe. I did add some black pepper towards end of cooking. It was so easy to make and so good.

Outstanding recipe ! I had a 2 lb trimmed kosher brisket so I halved the recipe and followed exactly except by using my pressure cooker. It took about 1 h 15 minutes, opening once to flip the piece of meat.
The overnight step is mainly to remove the excess fat. I just ladled the sauce in a bowl and refrigerated it for couple of hour to allow the fat to solidify and then discarded it. I poured the sauce back over the sliced meat in the pot  and heated up right on the stove.

I made this last night and it was delicious. I did add a little bit of  Worcestershire to it and I also added potatoes to it. It came out perfect. I also used a oregano white vinegar that I had on hand as well. Just delicious.

I thought this was a very helpful recipe to use. I felt that this needed some more liquid so I added some more water to keep it moist while I cooked it. I thought that searing the meat in the ditch oven was very difficult to do, next time I might sear it in another pan so that would be easier.

Everyone loved this brisket!  I did mine in the crockpot.  I browned the meat first then everything went in on low for 7 hours.  It was delicious!
