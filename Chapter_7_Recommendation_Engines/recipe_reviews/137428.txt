I made these for my New Year’s Eve party and they were a big hit.  They are rich and tasty and very easy to make.  I made a few small changes 1) I had precooked bacon on hand, so I used that.  In place of the bacon fat, I cooked the onions and mushroom stems in olive oil and butter.  2) I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs.  3) I don’t have a blender, so I just chopped things very fine, and mixed everything together.  Finally, I made the filling the day before, then stuffed the mushrooms early the day of the party and refrigerated until I baked them later in the evening.  This seemed to work out just fine, and made prep for the party much easier.

I was *planning* on following this recipe exactly, and I did - all the way up until the time came to put the ingredients in the blender. Then I had a Celeste-ial intervention. She said, "Sunny, don't do it! You are a texture-monkey. You need this stuffing to remain the way it is." So I listened. I believe this is a 5-star recipe blended, unblended for texture-monkeys only. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for a ladies evening in my neighborhood.  They were fabulous!  My changes: I cooked the bacon in the microwave and then carmelized the mushroom stems, onion and garlic in olive oil.  I did not use a blender, but did dice the mixture fine.  I used panko bread crumbs and did use my mixer to incorporate all ingredients.  I I actually made the filling the evening before, refrigerated it in a sandwich baggie overnight and then let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes before snipping off a corner of the baggie and piping it into the muchroom caps.  I did use Cremini mushrooms - 16 oz. (2 packages) to be exact.  I feel these mushrooms are beefier and stand up better to oven baking and holding stuffing.  I baked for 20 minutes in a 400 oven in a shallow Corningware dish.  I adjusted the recipe to make 8 servings but I used only 1/2 the filling and was able to fill about 30 some mushrooms!  I still have left over filling in the fridge, but I believe I'll use it as a stuffing for chicken or a topping for ribeyes!  Everyone of the ladies loved these mushrooms and several mentioned they'd have never known there was blue cheese in them!  I had a woman who hates blue cheese eating multiples!  These were really delish!

I made this for a shower at work. The flavor was excellent, and everyone loved them. However, I had a TON of filling left over, which may have been because I multiplied the recipe. I turned the leftover filling into a hot dip. Also, the blender didn't work for me. I ended up using a mixer to mix everything together. It's a great entertaining dish that just needed a bit of tweaking for me.

OMG!  This is one of the best appetizers.  One thing I recommend doing is drizzling a little olive oil over the mushrooms prior to stuffing them, this ensures they stay moist.  I took it to a friend's house for Girls Night and it was a big hit.  I did have a lot of stuffing left over, but I heated it up and used it as a dip the next night.  I will definitely make this again!

These were such a big hit.  I made a large batch (doubled the recipe) of them for a christening for my granddaughter last night and every one disappeared and was asked repeatedly for the recipe.    I used a chopper to finely chop the mushroom stems and the onion and used a fork to mix all the cheeses together - did not use a blender.   I mixed two different cheeses to make these along with the cream cheese.  I used a good quality blue cheese for 1/2 and used a sharp cheddar cheese which was finely grated for the other half.  Lots of great flavors.   Definifitely try this recipe.

I thought these were phenomenal! I forgot to take the bacon out of the freezer, so I left it out. So these can very easily be adapted for non-bacon eaters. I can't wait to make them again WITH bacon. Bacon, Bleu cheese, mushrooms...mmmmm, makes me drool just thinking about these warm creamy bites of heaven. *** I made these with bacon and was disappointed, not much change in flavor. Don't get me wrong, they are still wonderful, but not really the bacon flavor I was hoping for.***

I took these to an appy party and they were the absolute hit of the party!  Delicious!  I mixed the stuffing with my stand mixer instead of a blender and it was the perfect consistancy.   I used panko crumbs for the bread crubs. What is really great is that these are easy to make ahead of time and then just pop into the oven.   This is a keeper recipe!

These are good and super rich.  The only problem I had was that the actual mushroom came out pretty soggy.  I'm not sure how to fix that though.  This may have been because I made them a few hours in advance and put them in the fridge before cooking them.  Also, I used "stuffing" mushrooms which are pretty large and I got 9 stuffed mushrooms with no filling left over.  We will make these again because of the great flavor.  Next time I will make them right before cooking  maybe that will solve the soggy mushroom part.  Thanks for the recipe.  Great flavor!

Phenomenal! I even forgot to add the bread crumbs to the mixture, so I just sprinkled a little on top of each shroom. I made these along with Bacon Cheddar Mushrooms from this site but these blue cheese bacon ones were the winner! They look so nice on a plate, too.

Fabulous!  I got everything laid out on the counter a couple hours before the guests were supposed to arrive and found mold on my mushrooms - blech!  I just chopped up all the other ingredients blended and poured into a baking dish with bread crumbs on top.  Baked just long enough to warm it through and brown the crumbs.  Served with crackers and my guests loved it!

I made these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving this year.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy them.  I made 30 stuffed mushrooms so I increased the filling ingredients accordingly.  It made WAY too much - - I'll be stuffing chicken breasts with the leftover filling, I think.  I also had a hard time tasting the bacon because the blue cheese was the dominant flavor.  I might scale the cheese back a bit next time.  Used panko breadcrumbs and they gave a nice texture.  Also needed to use a food processor as the blender just didn't seem to be mixing the ingredients well.  Thanks, Maggie!

Yum! I had leftovers of the filling and used it in the dinner the next night, pounding out chicken and rolling it with this in the middle. Good stuff!

Love it!  My husband said, "we are bringing this to every party we go to".  I didn't blend or process the filling as recommended, we liked the chunkier texture. This has been in my recipe box for months waiting for the right occasion.  This quiet afternoon was perfect.

Since this was a great method, I thought I'd be a ninja and deviate from the recipe.  I mixed cream cheese, bleu cheese and bacon and stuffed the mushrooms with it. While they tasted FABULOUS (!!) the filling was runny and blobbed out onto the plate.  My boyfriend didn't seem to mind as he ate each one with a "Mmmmm" and a smile, I think I'll stick to the recipe next time for a better consistancy.  However, I am quite sure I will put this in the 'regulars' file.

I think I found my new favorite stuffed mushrooms!  These are absolutely delicious....a little bit of heaven.  I did not blend the mixture, but instead kept it chunky, just as a personal preference.  The saltiness of the blue cheese and the sweetness of the caramelized onions is just perfect.  I made a double batch and had a ton of filing left over, but it was delicious just eating it with a spoon.  I can't wait to make these for our next get-together. Thanks for sharing!

Perfect app. for your party, they disappeared fast!  They are large so we actually served them at the dinning room table before the meal was served so people felt comfortable eating them, but they loved them no matter how they got into their mouthes!

They were good but nothing to write home about. This made about 12 mushrooms for me. Next time I would hold back on the amount of breadcrumbs and add more seasoning.

I made half blue cheese / half cheddar because my husband doesn't like blue cheese.  I thought they turned out really yummy.  I used bacon crumbles instead of frying bacon and used olive oil to cook the mushroom/onion/garlic mixture.  I didn't blend the mixture because I like my mushroom filling a little chunkier, not smooth.

I am not sure if I like this the way it is written.  The flavor is good, but the blue cheese flavor is overpowering, and the filling was extremely thick, making me think I was supposed to use blue cheese dressing (I used crumbled blue cheese).  I did not have an overabundance of filling, but I would have if I hadn't used more mushrooms than called for (I used 8 ounces of mushrooms).  I will try this again, but will try it with blue cheese dressing to see if it is an improvement.

These were phenomenal.  I made the recipe just as written, and the filling was enough to stuff 16 oz. of fresh button mushrooms.  Perfect complement to our Christmas feast.  My sister said they were the best stuffed mushrooms she had ever had, and my picky man said they were his favorite dish of the meal.  Delicious!  This one is going in the permenant file.

Another 5 star rating! Made these for my DDIL's baby shower and they were raved about by everyone! I, too, did not blend the mixture, but diced very fine. If you do not blend, be sure to let the cream cheese come to room temp, makes it a whole lot easier to work with. Also used a mild bleu cheese (Amish bleu cheese purchased at Whole Foods which I got really cold and grated very fine)and put in a little extra bacon (can you ever have too much bacon?)I used fresh button mushrooms, put the filling in a Ziploc bag, cut the corner and piped the filling into the mushrooms. Baked them on a jelly roll pan sprayed with butter flavored Pam. About 40 "thumbs up" on this one!

I put in feta cheese instead of the gorgonzola cheese and also did italian bread crumbs and it was fantastic. I also have put the filling inside a large portabela mushrooms and then cut it into quaters for serving.  Very good, very easy.  One of my friends hates onions and he also loved it.

Loved this recipe! Didn't use bread crumbs and subbed gorgonzola for the bleu cheese after reading other reviews. Appreciated the leftover mixture to add as a bread topping, my guests loved it! Even a non-mushroom person was pleased! Will make again and again!

I have made these several times now for potlucks, parties, etc. I get rave reviews on them every time (Thanks, Maggie)! We have a potluck tomorrow at work. I was going to make something else, but some co-workers coerced me into bringing these again. They are absolutely delectable, and totally worth the effort.

Awsome flavor - I coarse chopped all ingredients, mixed lightly, fill mushroom caps and topped with breadcrumbs.  There was a bit extra filling which I think would be great with a grilled burger, on top or stuffed in the center.

I didn't change much with this recipe and it worked out okay.  I did not blend the stuffing in the blender.  I like texture and thought I would skip that step after reading a review from another member.  The flavor was good, but the blue cheese was a little overwhelming.  I think more bacon and less cheese would make this taste better.

Followed the directions to a tee. The filling is way to tight. I will try again and eliminate the cream cheese. The one thing I did not like the most, was the presentation. Bland looking, no color and not a go to dish. The flavor was very rich, but the concept is good. Thank You For Sharing

Fabulous.  I have made this numerous times since this recipe was featured in an appetizer class I took last fall.  The "stuffing" is also an amazing hamburger topping.

They went so fast my husband complained that he only got two at our party.   The only changes I made was to mix by hand and not in the blender the ingredients.  I also added chopped fresh parsley for color.

I made these for a new years appitizer and they were delicious. I added spinach to the sautee about a minute before it was done. I also forgot the bread crumbs when making the mix so I just sprinkled some on top and they turned out fine. Instead of large mushrooms, I used fairly small mushrooms because I wanted them to be bite sized and they were still really good! I only got one because they went so fast! I had some extra filling so I froze it and plan on making more soon!

OMG! My guest were fighting over the last mushrooms. I didn't measure much in this recipe I had 10 mushrooms so I used more of everything and used my food processor to blend it all together, the pulse feature let me control the texture. What I had left over I put in the fridge and will use tonight for a second package of mushrooms.

SOOOO GOOD! I followed Sunnybyrd's review and just mixed everything together in a bowl w/o using the blender to have more texture and b/c, frankly, I didn't feel like getting the blender dirty, lol, but I'm glad I decided not to blend it, b/c the different textures were wonderful! I will def be making these over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I must admit I really didn't measure the ingredients but used what I had available and they still turned out great!  I had about 5 leftover strips of bacon and 1/2 of an 8 oz block of cream cheese.  I used 8 white button mushrooms and still had some filling left.  I don't mind because I can make some more tomorrow!  Thanks!

I made these for a baby shower, and they were a hit!  I couldn't find large mushrooms in the store so I used normal ones, and I had waayyy too much filling left over.  Not a bad thing, really, as I just used the leftover filling to stuff some pork chops with!  Great appetizer, just fancy enough to be impressive in any crowd.

These were okay. I made them exact, and took them to a holiday party. The guests liked them, but I have to say that they smelled like dog food. and since they were blended beyond recognition, they looked like dog food too. I attempted to make them more asethiclly pleasing with some pasley, but they still smelled. Just a fyi.

So many compliments on this recipe. The recipe makes 2-3 times too much filing, though. I had to throw a lot out, and I scooped a lot of mushroom out with a melonballer. I also made some with baked, halved red potatoes as shells.

Love these but I had to leave out the onion as I am allergic but I did use some onion powder. Anything with bacon, blue cheese is a winner to me.

Yum. I followed recipe except for the following adjustments:
- a little less blue cheese because mine was a very strong blue cheese
-mixed with my hands rather than blender
- substituted sun-dried tomatoes for onions and sautéed for only five minutes
It was really savory and the consistency was perfect tot our taste. Great recipe, thanks.

These were ridiculously good.  It was difficult not to just shove all of them in my mouth and not share. I brought these to a party and since there was a gluten-free lady in the room, we left the bread crumbs out of the recipe, which I may do from now on anyway.  I was told these even stood strong in the leftovers test! Make these NOW.

YUM! I make the batter the day before and put into 2 quart zip lock bags. 2 bags is better because the volume in each bag is easier to work with. The day I am usiing it, I take out of fridge and let it get to almost room temp. Just snip the corner of the quart bags and pipe into mushrooms. This filler makes SO much that I used double the amount of mushrooms. Great food for a party and easy! You can even pipe two pans of shrooms so that you bake one and save one for later...staggering the baking. I left a piped pan of shrooms in the fridge for about 2 hours and it was fine when I baked them. I bake them on my pampered chef large stoneware bar/cookie pan.

These were soo good!  I took a tip from Rachael Ray and baked the mushrooms first for about 10 minutes to get all of the moisture out.  Then I stuffed them and baked them for about 10 minutes more and they were perfect.  I will definitely make these again!

These turned out delicious! I used a food processor to combine the ingredients instead of a blender because the blender did not combine the ingredients.

Very good... as long as one REALLY likes blue cheese. The flavor dominates and, depending on the "strength" of the cheese used, can overwhelm. The mushrooms make this a heavy, almost meaty appetizer. I could eat these as main course... but, my girlfriend felt one was all she needed at a time...too rich.

These were pretty good, but the bleu cheese flavor was a little overpowering (and I love bleu cheese). Also, maybe the mushrooms I used were just a little too small, but I had enough stuffing leftover for 2 more batches. Not sure what to do with the extra.

Fantasic Recipe!  What great flavor!  When I took them out of the oven they were a little on the dry side, so I covered them with tin foil while they cooled and that did the trick.  I also replaced the blue cheese with feta.  YUM YUM!

10.27.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/137428/blue-bacon-stuffed-mushrooms/ ... Yeah, I subbed jalapenos for the mushrooms.  Lighten up, it's okayyyy!  :D  I think my review is still valid.  I would've liked the bacon to stay crispy so I'd put it on top next time.  Oh, I didn't blend it - just mixed in a bowl.  Other than that, no suggestions - just if you're using jalapenos, watch out for leaving too many seeds.  I had a little sweat going. Really, I did!  :D

This is a really good recipe and super easy! I did not change much. I used microwave bacon because I do not like cooking bacon and dealing with all of the splattering of grease on the stove. I simply crisped it in the microwave and then crumbled it. I sautéed the onion, garlic and mushroom stems with 1T of butter and 1T of canola oil. I kept the recipe the same, other than that. I did add black pepper. I also, as others, did not blend it. I really liked the end texture this way. I was worried about the consistency of the filling, thought it might run all over the place, but it did not and was perfect. I thought the taste of bacon was just enough but was surprised that I did not taste more of the blue cheese. I may add more blue cheese next time, as I am a big fan of it. Overall, this is a fantastic recipe on its own and you can customize it with different seasonings. I will be making this one again, many times. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!! I did use pretty much the whole pack of bacon. TIP IF YOU HAVE EXTRA FILLING:  I mixed the left over stuffing with ground beef and made bacon-blue cheese-mushroom burgers.  I cannot tell you how good they were! I would say they may have been better than the mushrooms!

I made them for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved them.  The only thing was the cooking time was more so I put a small amount of water in the dish and they made way more mushrooms than it said it would.

I was so excited about making these because me and my husband love the taste of mushrooms, but after tasting we both tought that this recipe was a little too rich for our taste.  I decided to try the filling on slices of italian bread and toasted for about 10 minutes. I thought that combination was a little better than on top of mushrooms. I won’t make it again unless it is to use with bread.

I doubled up the recipe and used two containers of fresh mushrooms as a dish to bring to a party. To cut down on prep time, I used the already prepared bacon strips, zapped them in the microwave about 30 seconds so they would be crunchy.  Used minced chopped garlic and panko bread crumbs and at least 3 -4 tbsp of butter… Sliced a little off the mushrooms on the bottom so they would stay flat in the pan.  I was in a hurry so I let them bake about 10 minutes and then turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes.  I was very pleased with the outcome!

I made these for my New Year's Eve party and they were good, but not great.  I had several other appetizers that disappeared quickly, but I had these left over.

These were a HUGE hit at my New Years Eve party!!! I only made a few changes and my guests ate every single one, which was great since I trippled the recipe even for my small party. I didnt use the blender, I just finely chopped all ingredients which worked out perfectly. My guests said they could taste every ingredient. I also drizzled some olive oil on my mushrooms, because I made them a while before all my guests arrived. I also stuck a blue cheese stuffed green olive in the middle of my mushrooms and everyone thought they were a huge burst of flavor in a small package! Great recipe :)

These were great.  I doubled the recipe to stuff 12 mushrooms and still had enough left to stuff several chicken breasts the next day...yum!  Definitely brush the mushrooms with olive oil, and I cooked a little longer until nicely browned.

These went down like a lead balloon at my New Year's Eve party.  They were too heavy, stodgy and smelly to really easily enjoy.  My husband thought they looked horrendous as well.

These were good, but a little bit dry.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong - they were still good and we ate all of them.

Delicious! My husband is not a fan of blue cheese at all.  I made cheese mixture as written until time to add blue cheese - then I separated the mixture and added blue cheese to half and stuffed the mushrooms and sprinkled a bit of parsley on top so we could tell which were with blue cheese.  The other half of the mixture I added feta cheese instead and topped those mushrooms with a few bits of bacon. Both favors were wonderful!

Awesome!  I made these for a New Years Eve Get together and everyone RAVED!  My husband who normally doesn't like the bluecheese/bacon combination couldn't get enough.  I held back a few and cut the leftovers up into an omelette in the morning!  Very YUMMY!

my motto is there is nothing bad that can happen to a mushroom - I love them - but this was a REALLY good thing.  followed to the letter - just doubled it - had some cheese mixture left over so I spread it on the few slices of fresh french bread I had left over and broiled it.  That was as good as the mushrooms!!!  This one ranks right up there with one of my favorite finds on this site.

An absolute triumph! I tripled the recipe, omitted the onion (just not a fan of onion) and used Stilton bleu cheese (my personal favorite and well worth the cost).

Great recipe!  I am not really a fan of mushrooms OR blue cheese (which I hoped would hinder me from eating them).  Alas, they are absolutely delicious.  The problem I had though was that they really got rid of a lot of liquid in the oven while baking.  Not sure why, but after a switch of pans to serve they were beautiful.  I found that the dicing of red, orange, and green peppers really brighten them up, especially for a New Year's celebration.

SO good! I followed the recipe exactly and these were the first things gone at my families Christmas Eve get together.  The only thing I might change next time is to not blend so much. the super smooth texture was of the inside was a little different, but definitely still very good!

Wow... this was absolutely delicious. It DOES make a lot of stuffing and we didn't have a ton of mushrooms. I food-processed everything except for the breadcrumbs, and then mixed in the crumbs to half of the filling, and used the non-breadcrumb half as a dip and it was delicious. Bacon, creamcheese, blue cheese, garlic, onions... what is there NOT to love about this.

I made these for the bf.  I don't esat mushrooms, so I didn't try.  He really liked them.  I used dried minced onions since bf doesn't like onion and used about an ounce of blue cheese and the rest in feta bc i didn't have enough blue cheese.  He pronounced them good, so it's a success!  thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a friend to take to a potluck. It was so easy to make.  I doubled the amounts to serve more people, didn't add the butter to the bacon grease for cooking the onions, and used Boursin cheese instead of regular cream cheese.  They were so good, and I got what I feel is the best compliments of all:  My friend's coworkers are asking for the recipe, so you are to be thanked lots!  Thank you so much for a great recipe, I know I will be making this again.

This recipe goes GREAT as a side with grilled filet mignon. Save the trouble of trying use a blender! Just use a fork or mixer. We're hooked & will make this one again.

Great recipe!  We took them to a New Year's Eve party - they disappeared in minutes and received rave reviews!  I made enough for 24 and found that neither a blender nor food processor could handle the quantity.  Next time I'll use a mixer. Also, in making enough for 24 we had filling for twice the number of mushrooms. I will consider reducing the amount of cream cheese, blue cheese, and bread crumbs for larger quantities.

Thank you Maggie for a fantastic recipe.  I've made it a couple times now and have made only some small changes. We are big blue cheese fans so I added more blue cheese.  I didn't add the butter to the bacon grease.  I just cooked the garlic and mushroom stems in the bacon grease. (which is a must)  Lastly instead of the bread crumbs I took a 1/2 a cup of cheddar fishy crackers, put them in my mini food processor and then added them to the cheese mixture.  This has joined the family favorites file.

Being a huge blue cheese fan, I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  These are amazing! I have made them twice in the last month and garnered rave reviews.  The second time I used gluten free cracker crumbs for my fil and you couldn't tell a difference.  Certainly a new favorite.

I didn't have cream cheese on hand, but happened to have some wedges of mushroom-flavoured soft cheese, so I used those instead of cream cheese.  These were a hit for New Years Eve, and I'm making them again for football playoff game snacks.

Absolutely the best appetizer I have done. I need to get it a little more crumbly in the mix cause it felt a little pasty.

Best ever, everyone loved it. Followed the directions exactly, which is what I always do when making something for the first time.  If I want to tweek it later, I will.  This one  doesn’t need a tweek at all.  Thanks for sharing

No changes to the recipe aside from using buttermilk blue cheese.  They came out very rich, and very good.

If you don't have one of these tasty little apps in your mouth right now and two more in your hand, you're not living your best life. Just drop everything and go make these!

Make sure you don't use a blue cheese that is more on the bitter side. Get a milder one and this will be a hit!

These are wonderful little bites!  I made them for a small dinner party as an appy. Everyone loved them. When I said they had blue cheese in them, I got some 'looks'!  But they kept on eating them!  I guess they now have expanded their tastes! ;)

I liked this a lot! I swapped out the cream cheese for plain greek yogurt and omitted the breadcrumbs to make this healthier for a diabetic. For the stuffing mixture, I added kale and broccoli florets. I also increased the amount of garlic I used. I added in some thyme and basil. and coriander leaves Moving forward, I would drain the bacon grease and add less butter, as my veggies swam in the mixture. I would also season the mushrooms a bit and add in the onion. I would possibly switch the bacon for well marinated pork or chicken. I look forward to making these again. Also didn't feel like brining my blender out, so I mixed it by hand. I loved the texture.

Made these for New Year's Eve 2016, and everyone liked them. I used some leftover gorgonzola that I was gifted from BelGioioso cheese in place of the blue cheese, used panko in place of the bread crumbs, and also added a bit of fresh chopped parsley (for color). I just mixed it up by hand in a bowl, rather than dirtying my mixer. Tasty, and I'd make them again.

I had doubts about this because of the fat content, but honestly I thought it was pretty good and would make it again. I did use 6 ounces of cream cheese and 6 ounces of a blue cheese/gorgonzola mix and separated the bacon grease/fat from the cooked onion mixture before I added it to the cream cheese/blue cheese mixture and I sprayed my mushroom caps with cooking spray before filling and again after they baked for 15 minutes because I thought they looked dry (I may have overstuffed my disposable broiling pan) and then I baked them for another 5 minutes.

But whether or not that made a difference I don't know because these turned out moist and flavorful as they were being devoured. And they did NOT boil over: everything stayed in place.

Not clear on what a large mushroom is - pretty sure they didn't mean portabella - so the pack I bought had 20 mushrooms in 32 ounces. That was just what I could find that wasn't button mushrooms. 

I also had some filling left over (about 2 ounces) and trust me, it's great on crackers, possibly great baked in a dish and then served with crackers on the side. I will save the stuffing recipe for that at least.

I appreciated another reviewer for mentioning to make the stuffing a day ahead and refrigerating for easier prep. I also did NOT use a blender or mixer. This filling was very stiff and easy to work with after mixing so filling the mushrooms only required rolling it into a ball and pressing it into the mushroom cap.  I will save this and m

Oh man, these are good!!  I had planned on using panko instead of bread crumbs, but I forgot to mix them in, so I just sprinkled them on top, and it added the perfect crunch :)  YUM YUM!!

Awesome recipe!! Bleu cheese is prevalent.  I used a whole pack of bacon - you can never have too much bacon. I'll probably double the onion next time as well.  Easy recipe - awesome results!

All of the ingredients together sounds amazing, but in the end they combined into an alright cream filling.  Perhaps my mushrooms didn't have enough stem, but the filling was just ok.

I made these for a late night snack and was not disappointed.  It had the perfect amounts of bacony saltiness, bleu cheese bitterness, and mushroom meatiness.  The recipe is easy yet suitable for company.  Not the most manly food, but an easy appetizer or snack.

I will try this recipe again but will try the filling baked onto on crostinis or zucchini boats.  Or I'll "man" them up by breading and frying.

Great recipe. I omitted the bacon for a vegetarian version, toasted focaccia for the bread crumbs and absolutely did not blend it all together. I turned off the heat of the skillet when the onion/mushrooms mixture was ready, added the bread, the cream cheese and the blue cheese so they melted a little and scooped them onto the mushroom caps. I also stuffed a couple of gourmet tomatoes previously seeded, drizzled it all with truffle oil and it was DELICIOUS! Overall a winner recipe and one I'll do it dozens of times.

I have been making these mushrooms from this website for 5+ years, and still love it! Everyone I make these for loves them, and asks for the recipe. Thanks!I make them just like the recipe specifies except last time I did sub the cream cheese for sour cream because I forgot to buy cream cheese--they still came out perfectly.

These were the hit of our party! I did add a crushed bouillon  Cube to the onion mixture before I added the bread crumbs.....and it did look a little dry and I felt that after cooking they would have been but I added 2tbs before adding blue cheese.....these were amazing ...we had people leave our party and come back later just for more mushrooms!

These are SO GOOD! I love stuffed mushrooms, my husband loves Bleu Cheese so we had to try these. It's a keeper! The first time I made these I forgot to add the bread crumbs so I mixed them with a little of the bacon grease and sprinkled them on top of the mushrooms, thats how I do them now. Excellent! Thank you Maggie for sharing this one!
