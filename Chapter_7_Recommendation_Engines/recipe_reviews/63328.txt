One word ~ YUMMY! This recipe was surprisingly easy and the end results were outstanding. Everyone in the family loved them (even the kids). They were more sweet than sour but that was just fine with us. I will make these again and again! Thanks so much, Marilyn!

very good, but watch the flour, mine had a bit of a doughy taste.

Very good.  I was not sure if I would like it but it went very well with Pork Tenderloin in Bourbon from this site.  I did not add the onions because I am not fond of them but otherwise I followed the directions exactly.

Didn't hit the spot for either myself or my husband and I'm a huge brussel sprout lover.  I'll keep looking for something different rather than just tossing them in butter, but I don't think this will be it for us, we weren't crazy about the flavor.  Thanks anyways!

Very different and unique flavor.  I liked this one so well I sent it on to friends!

The tip about the flour was useful, and I cut back on that.  This recipe is a keeper. [Hint:  They are even better the next day!]

I love brussel sprouts, this recipe is a new delicious way to make them. YUM!!!! I haven't added the cloves yet but may just put a little on a serving to try it.

I would give this 3 and a half stars if I could. I was expecting a darker, thicker sauce. Maybe had I not used red onions it would've been darker. The sauce was alright, just wasn't as rich as I had hoped. These were still good, and a nice change from the garlic sprouts I usually make.

Followed the recipe exactly, not impressed.  Makes a thick gooey gravy disarray.
