I thought this recipe was very quick and easy.  I modified it a little bit with another recipe.  I sauteed my onions for like 45 minutes on low iin 3 tbsp butter. After that, I added 1 tbsp unbleached flour and 1/4 tsp brown sugar and simmered for about 3 minutes.  Then I added the broth and simmered for 30 minutes, then added my worceshire.  YUMMY.

I loved this recipe! It was so quick and easy and so delicious. The only thing I did differently was to add more Worcestershire sauce and next time I won't use quite so much oil as the recipe calls for.

Not only did this soup taste great, it was
really easy! If you're pretending to be a gourmet,
go elsewhere, but if you want a good, easy onion
soup this is it.

This is the recipe I lost a while back - glad to have it again.  Very, very, easy and delicious.  I only added about 1 Tablespoon of flour after the onions were soft to thicken the soup a bit, and about 1 Cup of water before simmering.

Very quick and easy to make. I made a single serving by quartering the recipe. Very easy for someone with literally NO cooking experience to make. I didn't make the french bread croûtons though and replaced them with store bought as that was a little quicker, I then put the soup and croûtons in a bowl and laid the cheese over top of it all and put that in the oven for 5 minutes. Next time I make this I'll add extra onions as there was a bit too little onion for my taste (although I love onions)

Excellent, easy recipe for delicious French onion soup.  I was worried that I had too many onions, so I added a can of French onion soup to the mix.  Turned out great!

Great soup for someone who doesn't have a lot of cooking experience. Next time, I plan to cook the onions a little longer on lower heat, use more onions, and add some flour to the onions to thicken it up a little.

So good! I followed the tips from KellyCali. I think the key to french onion soup is to simmer the onions for as long as you can.

Delicious!  Made it just as it said and it was great!  Super easy, which I loved.  Next time I'd cut the onions into shorter pieces, they got a bit long.  Mmmm...  Thanks Corwynn!

I thought it lacked something, I added white wine and it made it a 5 star recipe.  I tripled the recipe and to that I put in a cup of the wine.  Will make again, we put our swiss bread on the bottom and then poured the soup on top.  I also added salt to my own tastes :)

This was so easy to make and very tasty!  The only way I altered it was to add 2/3 cup sliced baby bella mushrooms during the last few minutes of cooking.  My boyfriend has already requested I serve again SOON!

This was delicious.  I did not measure anything but used a little more Worcestershire, added Thyme, cooking white wine, minced garlic, and a little brown sugar.  I also made a roux of butter and flour instead of using oil to brown the onion.  I substituted Monterey cheese for swiss, as the kids don't like swiss.  This was quick and easy and just what I was craving!

I sliced three onions and cooked them in about 2-3 tsp of butter instead of oil.  I added about a tablespoon of fresh thyme, a teaspoon of oregano and a bay leaf to the onions about 1/2 way through the saute.  I also added a can of french onion soup in addition to the two cans of beef broth and also a can of water since I had a lot of onions.  I used about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a bit more black pepper that the original recipe called for.  This was _really_ tasty.  I had some leftover homemade bread and used jack cheese because that was what I had.  The bread and cheese toasted up nicely.  Excellent, easy to make recipe.

This was very easy to make. I did not add the Worcestershire sauce and used Provolone cheese instead of swiss and sprinkled shredded Parmesan on the top once the soup was finished.

Very nice and light onion flavor. I followed the advice of other reviews and added flour to thicken.  Did not make as much soup as I would have thought. No leftovers! But I guess that's a good thing :)

We have a traditional Polish American dinner on Christmas eve and the start to the meal is French Onion Soup.  I've tried different recipes through the years, but they haven't been well recieved especially by my daughter who is now 10. This year we had my sister and BIL and their 3 kids for dinner and this soup was a BIG hit.  The kids loved it which was good because the rest of the meal was fish and that wasn't the kids favorite.  I was glad I made a big huge pot of this soup! 
These are the changes that I made:  I sauted the onions in butter and I used an equal amount of beef broth to beef bullion, only because my hubby did the shopping and didn't get enough cans of beef broth.  Because I made a large pot of this we didn't use bread but we used seasoned croutons, with shredded swiss cheese top, for the ease of serving.  I made the soup early and put it in the crockpot on low, because my husband is always busy cooking the fish and the last thing we need to to be making soup while he is trying to cook the numberous fish dishes and the peirogies!  I will make this again and again, my daughter LOVES it so it will be a staple in our house throughout the winter months!

So sorry, but this was so bland!!  Followed recipe exact, and used yellow onions.  After it was completed, I added a bit more worchershire, then soy sauce, then Lawrys, then a packet of au jus.  I won't be making this again, I will bite the bullet and use wine next time as most recipes for French onion soup call for it, and other specialty spices.  Good luck!

so simple and yet delish.  i used 2 cans chicken broth - all i had - and it was ok - definitely missing the depth of taste beef would have given it.  i will be trying this one again soon as written!

This was soooo good!  Just like the kind I used to get at the Hyatt.  I changed it up a bit.  I added fresh garlic to soup, used a blend of shredded swiss and mozzerella and made garlic croutons out of french bread.  I put the croutons on top of soup, then cheese on top of that and broiled the bowls of soup.  It was excellent!

This is a great tasty soup! It's super easy to make. Like other users I modified the recipe just a tad, I sauteed the onions (and a garlic clove) in 3tbsp. butter until soft, I then added a little flour to thicken, added boulllion, water, and worcestershire. A wholesome and hearty soup that stands on its own and makes wonderful leftovers!

A quick and easy soup, just what we needed on a cool, rainy night when the family had colds. I might try adding just a splash of red wine or balsamic vinegar to give it a little kick next time.

This was really good as written.  I also added more worschester sauce, garlic and a can of water.  I recently added basil and that was good too.  I found that one pond of onions is one large sweet onion or 3 small brown onions.  I put the toast in the bottom of my bowl and ladel the soup on top.

This is absolutely so easy and delicious! I substituted the oil for butter to add additional flavor. I also used hamburger buns I had in the freezer and mozzarella since that's all I had and put a little swipe of butter on the bread before i put on the cheese. The secret ingredient is the worcestershire! Mmmm, enjoy!

Turned out very good.  The only thing I did different was to use my own beef broth that I saved when I made a pot roast, so it was well seasoned.  This was my first time making French Onion Soup and was pleasantly surprised how quick and easy it was.  Thanks for another great recipe Corwynn!

I love french onion soup from restaurants. I wanted to try to make it myself because I never can get enough of it when I am out. It tasted kind of strange while it was cooking, but after I added the bread and cheese at the end it tasted good.  Would have liked for it to taste a little stronger.  But overall pretty good.  I did have to add a little extra worchestershire as others have said and you will definately want to double it if you want big servings.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars, esp. cuz I wowed my BF who said to me "I didn't think you'd be able to make French Onion Soup this good" blah blah ;-) But anyway, all  I changed was adding alot more Worcestershire sauce (no oil, only a little cooking spray), and some white wine & minced garlic while sauteing the onions. And I used Provolone cheese cuz thats what I had. I impressed myself, and my BF, for my first French Onion Soup!! :-D I highly recommend this recipe, it was great!

Followed the recipe exactly but was not happy at all with the flavor.  It was watery and bland.  Maybe I didn't caramelize the onions long enough.

Added some spices to the onions before adding the broth. I also let the onions cook for about 35 minutes, instead of the 20 the recipie called for. It came out pretty good for a begginer onion soup. My boyfriend said it was yummylicious.

I used chicken stock instead of beef stock. It worked really well and was not as salty. I also added some balsamic vinegar too.

This was good, but not my favorite. I'll probably make it again because it's so easy, but I've had better. It did seem to want a bit of salt, but maybe it's just the beef broth I used.

Very easy and tasty. I added a tbs of butter when cooking the onions. Also, I broiled the bread and cheese on the soup instead of separately. It was delicious!

This soup needed some serious help. I made it as directed and it tasted like a steak. I added brown sugar (as one reviewer suggested) and it made it worse. After adding salt to cancel out the sugar, I then added thyme, a bay leaf, and garlic. Much better. A side note: gruyere is the only way to go for cheese in a French onion soup.

Pretty yummy! I also thickened with a little flour and I added some white wine.  I think next time I'll cook the onions longer and the soup will be perfect.

Since there is no call for any water, this doesn't make very much soup. I also found it bland. I added 2 cups of water and a package of Au Jus mix to give it some flavor. Also added more spices. Ended up excellent.

This recipe was simple, and had the basic flavor elements for a good French Onion soup.  To enhance the flavor a bit, I added 2 tablespoons of fresh chives and 4 cloves of chopped garlic.  I would definitely make it again.  It was awesome!

Really yummy. I like that the onions still had slight crispness to them. Maybe someday I can get my "slimy" onion hating husband to try this one. Super tasty in combination with the bread.

Best & easiest recipe that I've found. Used a mix of  yellow cooking onions & sweet onions. After simmering the onions in the cooking oil for about 20 to 30 minutes, I made a rue with 1 tablespoon of flour & 1 tablespoon of butter, and blended it into the simmering broth, along with the worcestershire sauce & a drops of gravy master, for color

Tasted great. Put a couple of slices of rye topped with provolone under the broiler for the top. Husb really liked. Next time he wants me to make roast beef sandwiches to dip into the soup. That sounds good!

Delicious and easy! I wasn't sure what type of onion to use, so I used sweet. I cooked them in butter instead of oil for about 30 min, and added 1/4 tsp of brown sugar and 2 cloves of minced garlic when they were almost done. After adding the broth, I let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I also added a bay leaf and a dash of thyme. I never thought French onion soup could be this easy!

Quick, easy and delicious....especially when you slice the onions the night before. Recipe did not make 6 servings though. Next time I will double the broth but leave the onions at 1 lb as there were more than enough. This soup will be on my family's monthly menu plan from now on. Glad I tried it.

Good and quick if you have some onions to use up, but it doesn't have that French onion soup taste that I was looking for.  Next time I want some French onion, I'll stick with my tried and true "fancy" recipe with the wine and all.  :)

I substituted  double the amount of Worcestershire sauce. It still needed more black pepper. It also needed a bit of flour to thicken. It was okay.

This was easy and was a big hit at dinner.  I did take one of the other reviewers suggestions and slowly sauteed the onions for half an hour to forty minutes then continued with the recipe.  I made this the night before I served it and the next day found that it looked like it had boiled down too much, so I added more beef broth and found that it did not negatively effect the flavor.

Fabulous soup! I made French Onion Soup for the first time using this recipe and my family loved it. They are already asking me to make it again.

I needed a recipe to use LOTS of onions so I could salvage what what left from my dad's garden...3 lbs plus some after being cut. This certainly did the trick and my dad really enjoyed it...although one should know my dad likes bland food. I've never had french onion soup before so I don't know how it should taste but I think it could use some spices, though I don't know what? I did add some honey in the second and third batch which seemed to balance out the saltiness.  Overall a simple and a successful dinner.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. We made it for Christmas 07 for my husband's family and they could not stop raving about it.. It is a new Christmas staple in our home as well as just an easy delicious soup
