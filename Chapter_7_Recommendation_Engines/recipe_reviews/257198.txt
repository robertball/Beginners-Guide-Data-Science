I've been working for over a year trying to get a thin cracker like  crust and this is it! followed the directions as is and rolled out to approximately 1/8th inch thick. turned out great. Placed a large flat cast iron pan in the oven at 500 while it preheated. Then baked the crust for 1 minute on this hot pan. I then pulled it out and added my toppings to avoid the crust being soggy and put it back in for another 5 minutes.

I split the dough in half, cooked one and froze the other.  Added some rosemary and oregano to the mix to get a little Italian herb taste to it as well...just to change it up.  Always put the dough on a heated pizza stone and I also bake it for a couple minutes so it firms up a little bit.

This pizza dough was really easy  and delicious. I added 1/4 cup sugar instead of the amount called for. This recipe is a winner and will be my "go to" pizza crust!

This is a great crust.    I used a bakers yeast that didn't require time to rise and increased the sugar to 1/8 C.   I added some oregano and garlic the second time I made it to add some flavor to the crust.   This is my new go to easy crust for pizza!

2.19.17  I made this in my KA stand mixer andI had to add about 1/4 cup more flour to get it to a consistency to knead and roll out.  However, this certainly was “quick and easy,” and the dough was very easy to work with.    We love thin crust pizza, but would have preferred this to be a bit more tender.  Lynda Q thanks for sharing your recipe.

Dough turned out nicely and is a quick and easy from scratch dinner solution. Structurally, the dough worked great and made plenty of pizza for two. Taste wise it’s still lacking something. We added some Penzey's pizza seasoning during the kneading process, but it still needs more. I’d add more salt next time and additionally maybe add some garlic powder to the mixture next time and sprinkle more pizza seasoning on top before baking. 10 minutes on the rotating pizza oven, 15 in the regular oven at 400 deg F.

Changes I have made:
This base amounts is definitely for two 12 inch pizzas, not one.
Use Bread Flour not all-purpose.
Does not need salt.
Let dough sit overnight in fridge for best taste, if possible.
Push out dough with fingers not rolling pin. (This allows for a little bump at the edges for a crust)
When pushing out the dough, use cornmeal not flour.
Preheat a cast-iron skillet in oven if you don't have a baking stone.
Oil skillet before adding dough, and build the pizza in the skillet.
Drop the temp to 400-425F an cook for 15 minutes.

I like this, how easy it is and no waiting time for dough to rise.  Will try to increase sugar like others have noted.  Getting it perfectly crispy and light like the good Italian restaurants do is always a challenge with an oven that caps out at 500°F.  I might try this on my acorn grill that can get to 800°F, just slide it on the stone for just a minute or so.

This is a good recipe but I'm looking for something thinner and crunchier. I will try it again and roll it out very thin and brush the edges with garlic butter. I'll update my results then.

Good recipe. I always make 11 servings so I can get 3 large pizzas and 2 small personal ones for the kids. Also we use bread flour. Turns out Great every time!

Yummy, so quick too. No need to rise the dough. I mixed half whole wheat flour with the white flour.  It’s a keeper

Cast-iron pan makes it easy to get the crust perfect. I tend to just press the dough into the pan instead of trying to stretch it out first. My latest one I kind of let the crust start rising on the pan for several minutes in the oven while it was preheating, after it had puffed up around the edges I transferred it to the stovetop range on low-heat, and put the sauce and toppings on, then back in the 500 degree oven and I kept a close watch on it, when the cheese seemed like it had melted but the outer crust still wasn't browned yet, I put it under the broiler until the cheese had some color, and the crust looked like it was brown. Then I checked underneath it and it was still too light-colored on the bottom (pan wasn't hot enough) so back onto the stovetop range it went, closer to medium heat this time, until the bottom of the pizza looked like it was ready. It pays off if you watch it really closely and cook your pizza carefully. You can do it in stages like this if necessary, there's no shame in that.

Good quick thin crust.  I divided the dough into 2 sections and used the other portion to make a 13 to 14 inch pie.   Crust holds up well to “extra” sauce.

This crust is delicious. I got 2 personal pizzas and one larger one from the recipe. I added a full teaspoon of sugar and put a teaspoon of Italian seasoning in the mix. Very tasty! I roll it out nice and thin. Holds up great with tons of cheese and toppings. Very easy to make. I will always make homemade pizzas now.

The yield is a little unclear.  Is it 4 pizzas or 4 ppl/pizza?  It's too thick for one pizza, so I'll do as other have suggested and divide into two.

This recipe is pretty good, but the edges were hard crunchy than just crisp crunchy. Of course I made lots of things and not just one big pizza with the dough. Had I made one big pizza it may have been different. 
Next time I will make one pizza. I especially like the fact the dough came out with the ability to roll out very thin.

I've made this several times now and love how easy it is! I top it with lots of cheese and some pepperoni. (the cheese only section is for my toddler ;-)

I did not make any changes to the recipe. I will definitely make it again. The next time I make it, I want to try rolling it out a little thinner. I like a really thin crust pizza! I think it about doubled in thickness from what I rolled,  and that made it  about 1/2 again as thick as I like. Super easy!!!

I really like this crust. I used 1/4 cup sugar. Next time I will try to roll the dough out thinner. I want a crisper thinner crust.

Crust turned out larger than 12" and it was thicker than expected, good though. Next time I'll try dividing it in 2 to get 2 thinner crust versus 1 thick crust.

5++ My family loves thin crust pizza, we've found one pizza place but it's 15 miles away and we can't always get there, I had a recipe that I could make lots of and just keep in the fridge, but I managed to lose it ..  Im not sad since I found this and have made it multiple times ... I add a little extra salt .. I also put corn meal on the pan before placing the dough on it

This dough was pretty good. I  let the yeast, water and sugar set for 5 or 6 minutes.  When mixing the dough it was too dry to form a dough and I ended up doubling the water. Added salt, pepper, oregano,  garlic and onion powder,  and Italian seasoning.  I then kneaded it briefly and 6pressed it with my hand to form a disc. I  then pressed it in a cast iron pan I had previously sprayed with cooking spray and placed it in a 500 degree oven for 7 to 8 minutes. I then put on my toppings,  bacon, ham, turkey, homemade beef sausage, jalapeno peppers, previously  prepared tomato sauce and a double batch of  mozzarella cheese.  I then placed in in the oven for  10 minutes.  It came out with a very good thin crispy crust,  and it tasted very good.

I love using this recipe for more than just pizza. We add variations of herbs or even shredded cheese sometimes to change flavour. If rolled thin enough it is used as a flatbread for wraps or cooked in a pan with butter and used for sandwiches or dipping bread for soups. Wonderful, easy-to-make recipe.

I will preface this review with the fact I don't really know anything about baking, so it could be human error, but I followed the recipe to a T.  Used Red Star Active Dry Yeast - but the ratio seems way off for two reasons... 1) the instructions on the yeast packet say 1 packet (2.25 teaspoons) for 1/4 cup of water. That's much different than 1 teaspoon for 3/4 cups of water - it never foamed or "doubled in size" it just made a little bit of brown water. 2) it didn't get crispy at all or had any real taste. I also did 450 degrees for about 15 minutes. Any insight into where I went wrong would be appreciated. I'll try a little less water and a little bit more yeast next time - like the Red Star package suggests (or split the difference at least).

Followed the recipe except I made it in the food processor.  Then let it rest/rise for 1 hour.  This came out perfectly.  
I used KAF, which works better than ANY other flour.

Not super thin, yeast makes it just a bit bready.  Use a rolling pin once it is in the greased pan to get it thin as possible.  Larger than 12" doing this with it.  I cooked it at 350 for about 20 minutes with toppings.  Good tasting dough.

Divide and make smaller disks to make a filled pocket with this dough.  Stick the toppings inside and use the pizza sauce as a dipping marinara.

I added a little bit more sugar to the water with the yeast. I think I didn't have water that was warm enough to get it to foam up.
I will be making this again. It was wonderful!

I’ve made this several times and it’s a perfect simple thin crust. I use a pizza stone because I have one but I’ve used these same steps with a regular pan.  1. Put the stone in the oven while it preheating 2. Take out the hot stone and put your rolled out dough on it 3. Add your toppings 4. Put it back in the oven on the lowest rack 5. Cook for the recommended time.

I made this crust and then used a pizza stone on my Weber grill (with a wood smoker box) to make a cheeseburger pizza. My kids loved it! Super simple recipe to follow and most households probably already have all the ingredients.

Very good recipe. Thank you, Lynda. After reading comments, so glad I added onion & garlic powders, increased sugar & salt a little & added 1 tsp baking powder & equal parts bread & plain flours. Also 2 tsp olive oil. Then heated oiled large cast iron skillet while oven was heating & cooked crust first for 1 minute. It was so good the only problem was we could hardly stop eating it.

This was very nice.  I added some garlic powder and dried italian spices to the dough. No round pizza pan, so I made them on cookie sheets. I baked one and froze the other pizza. Hubs really liked it, said I should sell them (haha!) but I would have liked it crispier. Not taking anything away from the recipe, I just need to experiment with different cooking methods to get it the way I happen to prefer it. And somehow I missed the part about baking at 500 and baked at 425. Maybe that was my mistake. The frozen one was also baked at 425 and that was a bit crispier. Maybe I need a pizza stone or one of those air pans with all the holes in it. I'm gonna keep trying, though. Thank you for sharing!

I did a double batch and it yielded 4, 10-11" pizzas. (Rolled the dough out very thin.) I added 1/2 t. sugar to the yeast, then 1.25 T. sugar (guessing on amount) to the dough as I mixed it up. Salt - about 1.25 t. I prebaked the crusts for about 5 min. at 500°. I had lightly brushed pan with EVOO and a very light sprinkle of corn meal. Next time:  I would add a bit more salt to the crust and will wait to sprinkle corn meal so that I can flip the crust over after the 5 min. prebake. Crust was not overly flavorful, so hoping the added salt will help. Could have been crispier and think this might help. Melted 1T. butter and stirred in some garlic salt; brushed on crust after all done and it was so good.

This was amazing and SO easy!  I have been looking for a thin crust recipe for awhile and this was just perfect!  I was a bit concerned with the lack of oil, but it was not a problem.

recipe is enough for a large cookie sheet rectangle pizza.  sprinkle greased sheet with cornmeal.  Increased by 1.5 times to get one cookie sheet + 2 "personal pans" in 8" round cake pans.
Water temp should be 110-115 degree F

This was the best and easiest pizza crust recipe I’ve ever used. Rave review from my 24 year old son..a pizza Connoisseur! Only change I made was I melted garlic butter and brushed it on the top of the dough before putting my sauce and toppings on and cooked st 450 degrees since I used a cookie sheet.

I doubled the recipe and got two delicious BIG PIZZAS! (14" ROUND AND A 12X16 RECTANGLE and it was SOOO easy! I let it rest about 10 minutes after kneading ,to give the gluten time to relax so it was easier to roll/toss to size! Nice and thin like we like it!!

I loved this pizza dough better than any others that I have had. I  used 1/2 tsp salt  and 2 tsp of Italian herbs.  I cooked it at 485 degrees for 10-12 minutes on a perforated non stick pizza pan.  The crust was thin and browned perfectly.  The inside of my cabinet doors are were my go-to recipes are taped.  This is going there.  It is now so easy to make great pizza at home.  Thank you Linda Q.

I'll definitely be making this again! 
I did need the extra 1/4 cup of flour the recipe mentioned, plus a handful more while kneading. I also threw if about 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder for my own preference.

I spread the dough onto a full oiled cookie sheet and baked it for 12 minutes and it came out just the way I like it. New favourite pizza recipe!

I did not make any changes to the recipe and I would likely use it again except that when I rolled out the dough as a thin crust it was way more than required for a 12 inch pizza, more like 16 inch.   I think next time I will split the dough in half and freeze the piece I don't use.

Great crust! Easy, delicious, and the perfect texture. I add granulated garlic and herbs to the crust sometimes too. Have made this 4 times so far and each time it’s been perfect.

Excellent and easy recipe that produces a thin, crunchy crust. This is now my go-to recipe for pizza crust. I pre-cooked the dough on a lightly oiled 450 degree heated stone for 5 min. and then added my veggie topping and Parmesan cheese. Gave me the crunch I was looking for. Kudos!

Did it as described and it is in deed thin but not crispy or crunchy. It had no taste at all and rather "cardboardy". If I make it again will add some spices to the flour as some others have.

Turned out great!   I bbq'd my pizza using a Lagostina pizza stone and it was sensational.
