This cookie is more butterscotch than graham which was somewhat disappointing to me.  They are very moist and chewy though which was good.

Excellent recipe.  The cookies were nice and chewy with a great buttery background flavour.   I think that this recipe would make a great base for different cookies using cinnamon or honey graham cracker crumbs and chocolate, peanut butter, or white chocolate chips.  I will be making these again for sure!

Not super special. After all the sugar, where's the "graham"? The good part was the butterscotch chips which I crave regularly since I became pregnant with twins.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some extra graham cracker crumbs and found this and thought about trying it even though I had only Chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe (to use up the graham cracker crumbs), substituted the chocolate chips & immediately seperated & froze the cookie dough. I dough is quite stiff when frozen and need to be defrosted before dropping onto a pan. The cookies have turned out quite moist and chewy, with a very strong Graham cracker flavour. It is a nice variation to chocolate chip cookies but is not for those who do not have may not like the flavour of Graham Crackers.

I am normally not a butterscotch fan but these cookies were awesome. My family preferred them over the chocolate chip cookies I made on the same day. Very soft and chewy. Excellent easy to follow recipe.

I agree with the last review, more butterscotch than graham - nevertheless these were great cookies.  I'll make a few mod's and give it another shot.

These cookies were good, and very easy to make, but it seemed there were too many Butterscotch chips - all you could taste is butterscotch. I would suggest cutting the amount of chips in half, so you can taste the graham cracker.

This cookie recipe could be one of the best I have ever eaten.  The graham flavor is excellent against the butterscotch. The cookies stay moist and insanely good even several days later. My willpower was really tested with these cookies! Definitely a keeper recipe!

These cookies are insanely awesome. The butterscotch does overpower the graham slightly, but the cookie is still great. A fast a easy recipe to make. Wonderful.

This was a fantastic recipe!  The graham crackers gave the cookies a little extra flavor, and I didn't have any butterscotch chips around, so I used chocolate chip, peanut butter chip, and mint chocolate chips instead...they're already gone!

My husband and I loved these.  I, too, used milk chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips.  Then, after cooking and cooling a bit I spread a little marshmallow fluff over the top.  S'mores!  They were divine!

Everyone loved these and they were a nice but subtle change from the traditional Oatmeal Scotchies.

I made these to use up some butterscotch chips.  They are good, but didn't have the graham flavor I hoped for.  I probably wouldn't know they had graham cracker in them if I hadn't baked them.

These are really good and different.  They are awesome when they are still warm and the butterscotch chips are still gooey.  Yum!  I just got finished making my second batch for my husband's co-worker who sampled some from the first batch.  He said they are his new favorite.  I will definitely make these again and can't wait to try them with different flavors of chips.
