Yummy and creamy. We added fresh mushrooms, onion and orange capsicum. We couldn't find chicken and mushroom soup so we just used chicken soup instead.

Very good recipe. My grandmother used to make a VERY slightly modified version for us growing up.  Just use all cream of chicken, and sharp cheddar. Very good.

quick and easy. i had left-over roast chicken (which had a lot of flavor to start) and doubled recipe using one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom soup (what i had in the pantry); i also added salt to taste and a bit more black pepper than called for; i liked another reviewers suggestion -- it IS very much like tuna noodle  -- and so I added a cup of frozen peas. a good standby recipe i will use again.

This was sooooo good. I made it for my 3yr old granddaughter and my son-in-law and they loved it. So easy and quick and so delish. This is a keeper, I may even try it with ground chicken or beef. I know it will be a hit. Thanks Campbell's

Very tasty but I prepared a little different. I cooked the chicken mostly thru first, then I added the soup, milk, and parm. Then the noodles UNCOOKED with one can of water and of course, pepper and salt. And let it cook until noodles were soft. I think the water helps too, to make it not as thick/heavy. I added water as needed so it was still creamy. And my picky 2 yr old loved it!

Delicious! I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! The only I changed in this recipe was that I added a 1/4 tsp of salt!

This was just OK. It was nothing special, and needed something else to perk it up.It was a little heavy/creamy. I might make it again, for it's ease, and it was liked well enough.

This was great but I changed it a little. We were out of milk so I replaced it with half a can of water and 1/4 cup mayo to get the right texture and taste, then added some peas to make this a "one-pot-meal". Everyone loved it. I even picked out larger chicken cubes and gave it to our 14-month-old daughter.

Not only was my hubby suffering from a toothache, but we were both miserable with mild colds.  Something quick, simple, easy on tthe mouth, and comforting was needed and this seemed to fit the bill.   I used leftover turkey, added just a splash more liquid and Cream/Chicken soup.  It was fast, filling, and very very comforting.  Served with peas and homemade bread.  Perfect.  Thanks so much for recipe.

Don't you hate it when someone rates and changes things, well that is me today. I was concerned about the lack of flavor comments and frankly I HAD some time so it didn't have to be that quick. I did fry onion, celery and shaved carrots in butter first (I am a Mom I try to add vegetables) added peas and a packet of chicken soup flavor. I did not have egg noodles so I used Jamie's Oliver's fusilli. I have learned threw the years a sauce must be flavorful to make that much pasta taste good. It turned out good and something my husband will actually eat

I fried/grilled 2 pre-frozen chicken breasts that I had cubed. I cooked some noodles and when done, mixed with cream of chix soup and the milk. I also tossed in some canned mixed (drained) vegetables that I had sitting on the shelf. I forgot the Parmesan cheese and parsley, but it was still good. I am a complete klutz when it comes to trying to figure out what is for dinner and this did the trick for me.

Having read others' reviews, I set about to make this dish tastier so I added diced green pepper and peas.  I used leftover honey and garlic chicken breasts which were very flavourful on their own and was very surprised when the resulting dish ended up very bland anyway.  I'll try it again with Cream of Chicken soup and add a lot of onion and hopefully it will be better.  Seems like a good basic dish and it must be possible to jazz it up a little.

Tasty for such simple ingredients.  Did like another review said and used mild shredded cheddar cheese instead of parm.  Will make again.  Very easy and fast to make.  My 3 y/o loved it too, a plus!
