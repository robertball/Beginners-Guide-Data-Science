I, too, was introduced to Ground Nut Stew by a friend who spent half his life as a missionary kid in West Africa.  He taught me to serve this over rice, but with the addition of adding any kind of sqauash or yam to the stew itself, then providing plates of chopped lettuce, bananas, and tomatoes to add to each individual's plate.  The raw stuff on top really makes the dish!

I spent a month in Ghana and fell in love with groundnut stew when I was there.  I was so excited when I tasted the final product of this recipe because it was absolutely perfect!

I added chopped onions and green peppers, and omitted the mushrooms.  I also had to use extra chicken stock to thin it out. I served it over rice like they do in Ghana. And instead of using raw chicken breast, I bought a whole roasted chicken, carved it up and poured the stew over whole pieces of drumstick/thigh, and then shredded up the rest to add to the stew. Delicious! My boyfriend and my roommate (both of whom have never had African food before) devoured it and are already asking me to make more.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  

You definitely helped satisfy my craving for Ghanaian food

When I lived in Africa, it was easier to use all fresh ingredients. Instead of canned tomatoes and chilies, use fresh to taste. This makes  a much more intense and complex flavor. Also, instead of chicken, any kind of meat that is on hand can be used - beef, pork, ham, goat, lamb or even tofu. If you enjoy a bit of texture, use chunky peanut butter. This is an extremely versatile dish, so use your imagination.

This was excellent.  I made a few modifications, though:  I used the whole 6 oz can of tomato paste, I used 2- 15 1/2 oz cans of tomatoes with jalapenos and I used about 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter instead of 2 cups, I added a cubed yam and 1 1/2 green bell peppers.  I also used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6.  It was hearty and plentiful!  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely my favourite dish.  Smothered over rice with as many condiments (shredded coconut, diced apple, chutney, orange slices, tomato slices, raisins, plantain chips etc) as possible.  Fansastic.

this recipe was ok, but the peanut butter taste was way too overpowering.  If I make it again, I'd decrease the amount of peanut butter and maybe add more tomato paste.

Very simple and tasty dish.  The peanut butter I used seemed a bit dry, so I did have to thin it out with some chicken broth.  Liked it even better the second day.  This would be good with a bit of curry powder also, giving it a Thai flavor.

I've never had African food, so I don't know what I was expecting.  It was very tasty, but it was missing something.  We just don't know what.  We thought it was missing that "stewed all day long flavor."  Next time, I'll cook the meat in the liquid, to see if that helps to mesh the flavors some more.  Like I said, I've never tasted African cuisine, and I'm actually more accustomed to Asian flavors.  This could be RIGHT ON for all in know.  In any case, my family enjoyed it and my 7yr old twin boys said they'd eat it again...and THAT'S something!

I needed a sauce to go with gari (my husband brought back so much the last time he went home to Africa for a visit).  This was perfect.

I needed a vegetarian dish for friends, so I made this and subbed firm tofu for the chicken. Sauteed the onion and tofu (with a sprinkle of salt, pepper and dried coriander) first and then set that aside and used the same pan (to save from washing an extra pan). As per other reviews, I skipped the shrooms, added green pepper and diced sweet potato; I cut back (extra crunchy!) PB to 1 1/2 cups and I added some fresh jalapeno because I had it. My guests loved it - I thought it was just okay. I was tempted to add spices, though I don't know which spices would keep it authentic and didn't want to turn it into a Thai or Indian curry... I will definitely make this again and use chicken next time.

Yummy!  We put green apple, raw onion and lettuce on top.  I only used one and a half cups peanut butter and I think that was plenty.  I also used the whole can of tomato paste and might even put in a little more next time.

Was not blown away by this recipe - it sounded better than it came out.  I followed the recipe plus some of the suggestions and found it to be rather bland.

Wonderful Recipe!!  I cut the peanut butter in half and used the whole can of tomatoes.  Also added some coriander, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and diced yams.   I skipped the mushrooms and served it over rice.  It was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  I can't wait to dig into my leftovers!  Thanks for sharing!

Great! But more like a soup instead of stew  Maybe because I use natural peanut butter.

This stew is WONDERFUL!!  I made it for company and they raved about it.  I didn't have diced tomatoes with chilis, so I just used diced tomatoes for chili and it worked great.  My 3 year old and 1 year old also loved it.  I will make this many times!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My father is Ghanian and I ate this growing up. It's one of my favorite foods, though I don't make it often. To me this recipe tastes extremely close to the way he made it, the only thing I don't add are the mushrooms because he never made it that way. I kind of measure the ingredients myself to see what amount I feel I need, but I don't use anything else other than what's listed and some dashes of pepper and salt. I'm sure he added other things besides the ingredients listed in this recipe, but I was way too young to remember. I eat this served over rice but when I was young I ate it with Fufu (another African food - technically, it's pounded yam) - I would have a bowl of the stew and a plate with Fufu on it and I would dip little pieces of Fufu into the stew. I absolutely LOVE it that way, but I'm sure it's not quite as healthy. I don't remember if my dad made Fufu the traditional way, but I personally just use instant mashed potatoes and make them a bit thick - I know my dad adds corn starch to his recipe for consistency, but I've never done that. Great recipe! I always come to this one when I decide to make it.

I had my husband make this one night this week and it turned out fantastic!  The only thing he altered was he put in a can of carrots (with the juice accidentally) and it turned out fantastic!  Next time I think we will try it without the carrot juice to see if it is even better.

This is an awesome recipe that can be easily adapted to whatever you have on hand or feel like eating. I added sweet potatoes (sliced about 1/4-inch-thick), okra and eggplant, all of which I sauteed and added to the stew before cooking the chicken. My husband and I both love it and it's going into our regular rotation; haven't tried it out on kids but I think if they like peanut butter it's worth a shot!
