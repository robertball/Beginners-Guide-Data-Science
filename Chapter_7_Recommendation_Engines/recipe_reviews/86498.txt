Meh. This was very mediocre and lacking in flavor. To appease my hubby, I decided to try a chili recipe without beans (he is a firm believer that only chili with meat is authentic). Since I tend to gravitate towards more traditional preparations (i.e. with beans), I owed it to him to give his version a try. As I suspected, I felt something was missing.... I will never make chili without beans again. :) Because I was running errands all afternoon, I put my slow cooker to work. I ended up simmering this for about 4 hours - which I think only enhanced the flavor. For those interested, my choice of beer was Fat Tire 1554 (black ale). My hubs ate his chili in a bowl and I made chili dogs with mine. Frito's and brownies completed our simple meal. Now off to the hockey game! :-)

This is a great example of a Great Texas Chili!  We also use this recipe with venison. A family favorite.

My husband couldn't eat enough of this one! He loved it! I liked it too. All the spices really are wonderful. I've made this twice within one month.
