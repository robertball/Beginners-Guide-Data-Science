This recipe was so fast and easy, I do love it. I was done in 5 minutes and it took only an hour to cool in the refridgerator.  Why i gave it 3 stars then??? it had WAY too much sugar in it. I followed it to the "T" and i love sugary things but i couldn't handle more than one cookie at a time, next time i'm starting with 1 cup of sugar and going up a bit from there if needed but i think there was 1 cup too much in that recipe and i love sugar things so it had to be too sugary.

tips: if you don't have wax paper on hand, use a tad cooking spray on the sheets. 

also it's good because this recipe i made out of staples.. so if you want something sweet, or need a quick treat, it's great bc you have these things on hand anyhow!

These were gooey, delicious chocolate-y, and everything I needed to satisfy a full on pregnancy craving.    When my husband heard I was making "no-bake cookies", he said "uh...yuck".  When I was almost done with them, he said "Oh! Hey! My mom used to make these, we called them splat cookies!"  And according to him, they taste just like the ones he used to have as a kid.  I did use a little less sugar, as suggested by some, and I'm glad I did, they came out perfectly.  ***EDIT-I just made a batch of these using extra peanut butter, and rice krispies instead of oatmeal, and they were even better.

These are good no bake cookies but I don't use the powdered milk.  Like the previous reviewer...yeah you need milk with these.  The peanut butter flavor is the dominant flavor in these cookies...so you peanut butter nuts....dig in!!  Happy Eating.

I just finished making a double batch of this recipe.  These cookies are awesome!  I didn't have all the chocolate powder drink mix that the recipe calls for, but I did have two small mug size packets of the hot chocolate mix in addition to and abundance of Nestle's regular baking cocoa, so with the double batch that came out to approx. 1/2 cup of chocolate mix with marshmallows and a 1/2 cup of powdered baking cocoa.  I believe this was a good combination, but it does seem that these should be eaten sparingly with a tall glass of milk (as suggested by HollyHolly in another post) or else you may be in the emergency room from sugar shock :o).  Overall, a very very good recipe.  I give it four stars!

Came out good and very sweet. More of a grainy, sugary texture than the creamy, fudgy texture that I'm looking for. I do like the more chocolaty flavor of the choc. milk powder though compared to the cocoa powder.

These were pretty good.  I just gave them a 4 because they didn't harden up very well.  I took the suggestion of others and only used 1 1/2 cup of sugar..they turned out very well.

Very Good! I added 1 cup of shredded coconut and half cup slivered almonds- excellent! I didn't have chocolate drink mix, so I used cocoa and cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cup- perfect!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed as directed except decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups after reading other reviews.  I also used Ovaltine for the powdered mix.  The cookies were delicious, but fell apart easily.  I put them in the fridge for a few hours and they were perfect!  The second time I made the cookies I decreased the sugar even more, down to 1 cup.  You could not tell the difference at all!  I also added 1/2 cup of milled flax seed to reap the health benefits of all those Omega 3's.   Once again, delicious!  Still needed to be refrigerated to help keep the cookies together, but well worth it!

I've been craving cookies because I'm pregnant, but it's the middle of July and I did NOT want to turn on the oven!  I also didn't have cocoa powder so I tried this recipe...and I LOVE it!  I took the advice of others and used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, but other than that it was the same.  And they came out perfect: rich and peanut-buttery w/ a hint of chocolate... Satisfied the craving wonderfully!  Thanx for the recipe!

I am not normally a fan of no bake cookies, but these had good flavor. I would've liked them to "set" better though. All in all, they worked well in a pinch for something sweet, using items on hand, when the oven is on the fritz.

These cookies tasted great if you eat them with a spoon. Ours didn't set up enough to remove from the wax paper. Very disappointing.

These turned out great and were pretty simple.  The only problem was they tended to fall apart and be crumbly.  I guess that's part of no bake cookies though.

MMMMM! I made these cookies out of a chocolate craving, but I was 1 cup short on the oats. :( So I was reading the reviews and found a great substitute.! I used what oats I had, and then added rice krispies to cover the rest. They turned out so delicous and will be making them for sure again! :)

I made this recipe with 1c sugar (didn't realize I was almost out until it was too late), and added about 1/2c chocolate protein powder to add protein and make up for the sugar.  While the flavor was perfect they did not firm up.  They were a little gooey- but really good once I froze them!  Just make sure to put them on a non-stick surface.  Probably needs the 2cups sugar to help them set.

My family and I love this recipe!  We are in El Salvador for a year and at first could not find cocoa powder--it can only be found in the big cities.  We can, however, get powdered chocolate drink mix.  After our first two weeks here, we were longing for something familiar and chocolate.  I found this recipe and my family was elated.  I have now shared the recipe with others here because very few families have ovens so they cannot bake, but they can make these cookies because they can be made in a pot over the open fire.  I make the recipe exactly as it is written and it is perfect!

I usually make the regular recipe for this, but I do feel it is too sweet & was actually looking for a recipe that isn't as sweet. I would like to try with the cocoa mix, which one person referred to as just "powdered milk", so she may have misread. I will reduce sugar. Also, a lady said was grainy. If that is the case, not all of the sugar has dissolved. Don't know, if it should be cooked longer or, if it is due to mixing in the dry cocoa mix.

These cookies had the consistency of fudge. The chocolatey peanuty flavor was really good. These definitely need to be eaten with a tall glass of cold milk. I shared these with some friends and they all said the same thing "Man, I need some milk". Another friend said they werent a typical no bake cookie.

This is my second time making these. The first time I used butter as the recipe says, and they turned out awesome. This time I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter because that's what I had, and that was a mistake. The mixture sticks to the wax paper and won't form properly. Great recipe, just make sure to use butter!

I like these better than the ones with cocoa powder because they are more peanut buttery.

It was delicious to make these to tee on the recipe and for my second batch, instead of using vanilla extract, I used banana extract and it was amazing! (If you like chocolate, peanut butter and banana like we do) ??

I followed this recipe as written, except I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups.  They taste delicious, but they didn't set!  They're way too gooey and I can barely get them off the wax paper.

These were delicious!  Mine came out a little on a gooey side, but solidifed enough to get them off the wax paper.  This could have been because I added other stuff I had laying around, like a few chocolate/peanut butter kisses and I threw in about half a cup of crushed pretzels to add some saltiness.  Definetly helped crave my sweet tooth!

My family LOVES these cookies... I have made them many, many times following this recipe exactly and they have come out perfect everytime ! I know people who have variations of this recipe who have had the cookies turn out perfect sometimes and mushy other times... but this recipe is perfect everytime !!! Not to mention it takes about 10 mins from start to finish !

These turned out very gritty / grainy.  Not sure why,  I thought maybe it  should have been boiled longer. I made exactly as stated, Alittle too much like candy for me.  I think next time maybe less sugar and boil  alittle longer. Still .....love the site

Very good recipe. I used a little less than 1 1/2 cup sugar and they were a perfect treat to cure our sweet tooth when the oven was broken! We agreed that we'll even keep them around when it's fixed too!

I was looking for a easy sweet to make but not have to do a whole lot of work.... (lazy me) and came up with this one!  The only thing I would change would be; perhaps I would add in some rasins and place the "lumps" of "dough" on top of the small bite size pretzels.  I bet this would be a yummy add on... perhaps next time. We'll see.

These cookies didn't set as hard as I would have liked and I agree with the other reviews that they are almost too sweet. I do like the cocoa drink mix better, but not a favorite recipe for these cookies.

These were good, but their texture was a little odd.  They didn't seem to get "set" like the ones with peanut butter.  That didn't stop my kids from eating all of them, but hubby and I weren't fond of them.

These are the very best cookies I've ever had!  They are so quick and easy and so addictive!  Really, don't try them because you'll just have to keep making them!  I like to boil for 1 1/2 mins.
