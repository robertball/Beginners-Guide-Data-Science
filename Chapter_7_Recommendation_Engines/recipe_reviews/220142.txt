hmmmm how to review. Number one.. they tasted good. Number two..make sure you cook them all before you take a break cuz in the 15 minutes it took for me to eat breakfast, the batter was flat and the remaining crepes/pancakes were greasy. Three....The amount of butter seems excessive (hence the greasy pancake when the batter had settled) so if I made them again I would add just a couple tablespoons of butter.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I have been making one of the other one's listed on this site for quite a while and just wanted to try something different.  Even though the ingredients are very similar, these Swedish Pancakes came out much more fluffy.  They were fluffy but dense at the same time.  Tasted delicious with some powdered sugar on top.

These turn out great for me. However, the second time I went to make it, I had to DROP CALORIES. I turned the milk into non-fat/skim, used 1 tbsp sugar (react to most fake sugars), took 1/4 c to 1 tbsp olive oil, and cut the egg yolk and just used egg whites (3 tbsp egg white purchased in a container equals a whole large egg).  I also used multi-grain for the regular flour. FOR those of you who are stuck like me wanting yummy things but needing to alter, this dropped a lot of calories. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to add more flavor and sweetening. And, best of all, using these basic techniques for changing out, worked wonderfully. I have a great non-stick pan, and didn't even have to grease it. I can still have crepes -- but the recipe above, for people who aren't on a health concern --  ENJOY!! They are wonderful.

Very good and fast. Fluffier than the average crepe which made them easier to flip in the pan because they were less flimsy. I cut the batch in half because it was just me and it made 6. Will definately use this recipe next time I am making crepes again.

Hubs savored one bite and said "Happy Dance, Happy Dance!"  I served them with peaches in syrup.  As another reviewer cautioned, I did reduce the butter to 1/4 cup.  It was plenty, and they were still buttery.  Besides, you'll be adding more butter to the pan.  They were sweet and fluffy, just as promised.

I think this recipe is superb. I wanted to cut back the fat and calories, so I used only 2 tablespoons of melted butter, and it worked great. I made mine nice and thin, and the recipe yielded 12 pancakes. I spread a bit of jam on each as it came out, rolled it up and put it in a container with the lid on loosely to keep them warm while the rest were cooking. I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, so I put a bit of organic sugar in the food processor to make my own. Sprinkle them with the powdered sugar, top with whipped cream, and enjoy!  My kids had seconds and thirds!

In all of my 25 years, I have never had such fluffly crepes as these bad mama jammas right here. I was a little unsure whether there would be too much fluff, and I'd say there was the perfect amount of fluff. They filled you up more than your typical crepes and I highly recommend these to any crepe lovers.

Loved it! Added teaspoon of vanilla. Served with a little bit of jelly rolled in it. And a teeny tiny bit of maple syrup, but it really wasn't necessary.

Update: we made these again and filled with a cream cheese/apricot jelly mixture. YUM! Didn't take much of the mixture. Served without syrup. Also made it on our large electric griddle - could make more at a time. Poured 1/4 cup of mixture and gently spread with back of spoon. Didn't need much spreading because the batter is so thin - really just did it to round them out a little.

I just found this recipe on here and tried it. It came out great. I would recommend adding vanilla for that flavor if you want to. Either way it taste great!

These were wonderful and made 8 very fluffy Swedish pancakes (I divided the batter evenly into 8 ramekins to make sure I was using the correct amount for each pancake).  I made a few changes to make it dairy-free and a bit healthier: unsweetened almond milk in place of regular milk; 1 tbs. sugar + 3 packets of stevia in place of the 3 tbs. sugar; and 6 tbs. Smart Balance Light instead of the 1/2 cup butter.  I used my nonstick crepe pan, so no extra fat was needed for greasing.  I rolled up each pancake and topped them with a mixture of warmed and maple-sweetened blueberries and bananas.  My husband gobbled them up and requested them again, and I definitely agreed.  In fact, I think I'll be making them again this weekend!  Just remember that this is *not* something you can cook quickly, as each pancake has to be done invididually.  The batter comes together very quickly, the finished product . . . not so much : )

I have been making crepes since 1966. This one of the best I made. They are lighter then most. They don't sit in your stomach like a lead brick. They were just great. I did change up the recipe on the 3rd time. I left out the salt and used unsalted butter and cut out 500 msg of salt. My grand kids also enjoyed these with and w/o the salt. If you're look for a recipe for crepes this is the one don't look any more

Excellent! I liked that these were not too thick and not too thin. I halved the recipe and got five 7" pancakes. I followed the advice of some reviewers and also cut the melted butter going into the pancakes in half (worked fine) and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to this half-batch. I thought that added a nice flavor.  I used these like crepes, adding a mixture of cottage cheese and a little sour cream, topped with confect sugar, a little sugar-free maple syrup and sour cream on the side. Will definitely make these again!

I have made this recipe a million times.  I use either soy or almond milk, depending what I have on hand and they come out great!  We love to fill ours with a little jam or Nutella. Just make sure to pour these VERY thin, because they do fluff up quite a bit. Also, I use 1/4 cup of butter in the batter and I don't coat the pan with butter, but use Pam instead. Works well and cuts some calories/fat.

Very easy and fast.  I usually make crepes on Sunday and thought I'd try a different recipe.  The crepes were fluffy and sweet.  A huge hit with teen age boys. I tripled the recipe and had nothing left.  Yum!

These were fantastic! Very simple to follow recipe and tasted great! I substituted the butter and milk for soy products because of a dairy allergy and they were still amazing. Truly deserves 5 Stars.

This was my first time making crepes and the family loved it. I doubled the ingredients (family of 5) with the exception of the butter. It was delicious and still very buttery flavored. This is now our family favorite!

I think these are the best pancakes I ate, ever! And they're also so easy everyone can make them. To my surprise, they didn't tear during flipping, what always was a problem for me with other pancakes.

I love how easy these are to flip. I added a teaspoon of vanilla for more flavor. ?? for a filling we used cream cheese half-and-half sugar and vanilla to taste, blended until smooth and creamy. ?we served with fresh strawberries and whip cream.

I would not call them fluffy but the texture was good. They put to mind of the once served German Pancakes served at I Hop which I loved served with lemon and powdered sugar. I made them in a crepe pan which I think is important to get them right. Followed the recipe and they turned out super.

My friends Grandpa made these for us when we would go there, so my mother and I decided to give a go at them a they were truly delicious! We added strawberry sauce with a bit of powder sugar and my taste buds just melted. I definitely recommend these to the pancake lovers out there!

I made this recipe a tad different so it would serve 4, by basically doubling the recipe. As visually impaired person, I was VERY surprised at how easy this was to make! The only thing that I had difficulty with was flipping the crepes with my spatula. But hey, as my dad always says “You have to eat your mistakes”. So I guess this is a trial and error for me, as is with every recipe that I try out.

Made a half recipe for me and my daughter, but separated the egg whites and beat them until slightly stiff. Folded them in at the very end. Delicious flavour!

I made this recipe for 8 adults and everyone LOVED it.  We often go to IKEA for Swedish Pancakes and these are even better!  I don't put butter in the pan as the butter from the batter melted in the pan and worked very well.  The pancakes were golden brown and we had an assembly line going to get them done quickly.   We used strawberry pie filling and fresh bananas to fill and top.  Delicious.  Have made a few times.

I had great success with this recipe. Best recipe I've come across for Swedish Pancakes. I altered it slightly by using brown sugar instead of white sugar and King Arthur unbleached flour.  I also used a BlendTec blender to mix the ingredients. Came out Yummy!

Eggy, fluffy, delicate, simple to make. Take out the sugar and they're so good as savory pancakes to stuff with spinach & mushrooms drizzled with cheese sauce or whatever. Boyfriend loved as well.

Excellent. I did make one change. Because we like syrup on our Swdish Pancakes, I decreased the sugar to about 1 TB. I may drop it altogether next time I make it or just put about 1\2 TB

You can make these and freeze ahead. Cut the recipe in half if only 1-2 people. I used Cashew milk but would use Almond milk. Spread with whipped cream cheese then a thin strip of Lingonberry Preserves (or Raspberry). You can also use canned pie filling. Roll up, then reheat on low power for a few seconds in microwave then sprinkle with Powdered sugar. Yummy! Having 2 crepe pans would have saved me time standing over the stove with a Full recipe! More to freeze! I put wax paper between four for freezing for 1 (this Single Senior Gal) ;)

I added flaxseed as I needed to make them heart healthy, and so I dropped the floor and butter content to accommodate. They turned out great, though I knew I only needed to make 1 serving for the two of us :)

This is such a great recipe for various reasons. It is SO quick and easy (I made half and it equated to 4 large pancakes). My husband is obsessed with cinnamon rolls and he said this Swedish pancake recipe was BETTER! That says a lot!

These are fantastic to double (or triple!) the recipe as they freeze well.  Just make sure they are cooled first.  (Great snacks for the kiddos!)  Unlike your more traditional fluffy pancake, these keep their original texture better when reheating for a few seconds in the microwave.  THowever, if you do increase the recipe, be prepared to be standing by the griddle awhile - it's such a thin batter it takes awhile to make them up!  Love this slightly bigger-boned cousin to the crepe! :) We sometimes sprinkle a little cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice into the batter or on a side of the pancakes for something different.  They do require frequent stirring so the butter doesn't settle:  I use really hot water to minimize this.  Some of our family likes them served with traditional maple syrup, but others prefer an apple butter or cinnamon butter.

This is my new favourite pancake recipe. I halved the recipe since it was only for myself, and I added a pinch of baking soda. The baking soda made the pancakes spongier, perhaps like Moroccan pancakes which I have yet to try ('Msemmen'). I will definitely be making it agains. It's very simple and can be very versatile. The pancake itself didn't have much of a flavour except for slightly bread-y (which is what I would expect). The addition of baking soda really made a difference, in my opinion.

These tasted great! I found that 1/2 C butter was a bit too much and left them slightly greasy feeling. The second time I made them I used about 1/3 C and it was better. I probably could have reduced it further but didn't want them to stick!

I've been making crepes for awhile now, but thought I'd try these.  My family liked them so much better! Just that little bit fluffier and substantial without being regular pancakes.  Whereas everyone in my family eats 2-4 crepes in the morning, even my husband only had two of these before he was satiated. Yum.

We just finished eating these! Kids wanted pancakes, but I didn't, so I compromised - crepes! I have only attempted crepes once before, and they didn't come out very well. these were perfect! 
I did make 2 changes: 1, I didn't use an electric mixer (didn't feel like dragging it out). Mixing by hand worked just fine - just be thorough.
2, I was out of the butter (so glad the kids and hubby tell me when we're out of stuff...). I just used 1/2 cup of olive oil. Worked just fine!
It is difficult to multitask when you make these, as they cook quickly.

These weren't fluffy for me, but it could be my fault because I whisked instead of using mixer. I've made swedish pancakes many times with different recipes & it never seemed to matter if I used whisk, blender or mixer.  Also, this calls for a lot more butter than most,  so I cut it in half. They still tasted fine.

These were sooo good!!! I halved the recipe for two people and put butter on them sprinkled with powdered sugar and a squeez of lemon. We almost died at how good they were. We wished I had made the full recipe. I added a bit of vanilla extract and they came out tasting just like the crepes at my favorite breakfast joint. My daughter said they were better. I also love not having to wait an hour for the batter to rest like other crepe recipes.

First of all, I followed the recipe precisely. It annoys me to no end when people rate a recipe based on their version of it that is different from the original. I won't do that. That said, when I make these again, because I definitely will, I am going to cut the butter amount in half and work from there to find the magic amount. Don't get me wrong. I went to the Paula Deen school of "More butter, More better," but I think these would be really good even with half, especially when adding butter to the pan for cooking. I will also cook at medium high heat to get a little crispiness around the edges. 
     Try them according to the recipe and decide for yourself. Either way, I don't think that you will have any complaints about the flavor or texture of these. They are creamy, eggy, buttery goodness to the last bite.

Simple recipe and Super Delicious!! 
Learning to flip these was my only challenge but after the first one I was a pro :)
Family was happy to consume as quickly as i could make them! Next time I'll double the recipe!

I've tried three different crepe recipes and with a large crepe pan we picked up in France, I've never made a perfect crepe. This is the recipe.  Every time, they come out nice.
I cut the butter in half to 1/4 c, and dropped the sugar to 2 T.
My kids LOVE them and ask for them every Saturday.

Its was awesome when you get the hang of it. Maybe add some vanilla extract. Other wise it's kinda bland.

I only made a couple small changes.  I used about 25% of the salt, I don't care for much salt, generally.   

I separated the eggs, and beat the egg whites until soft peaks formed, like my Swedish grandmother taught me, and I browned the butter before adding it (which makes EVERYTHING better).   I mixed everything together as directed except the egg whites, which I gently folded in last and let rest for 20 minutes before frying.  No butter is needed in the skillet, since it's already in the batter. 

They turned out fabulous.   Eggy, light and with great flavor.   Just like they're supposed to be!

The person cooking these generally doesn't eat with the family, just warning you...   ;)   They're best served hot off the pan.

It is the water yhat helps with fluffiness. If you add a bit of water to eggs when you beat for scrambled eggs they will turn out more fluffy as well.
