PERFECT!  Hubby and I both loved these.  Tonight I was looking for a cookie recipe that only used baking soda as I was out of baking powder.  When I saw this recipe used candy-coated chocolate, I knew I wanted to try it as I had some Almond Joy pieces I also wanted to use.  It was a perfect match. It was very easy to make but it didn't tell you how to prepare the cookie sheet.  (Perhaps Allrecipes can fix that for you)  I used parchment paper and it worked very well.  Thank you PAYDRA for sharing your recipe!
