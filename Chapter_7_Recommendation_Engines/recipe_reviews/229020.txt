I put this into a warmed flour tortilla with hot Mexican chicken breast pieces.  Chipotle move over!  I would always get their chicken burrito with black beans, corn salsa and guacamole.  This tasted just as awesome but was even better because it was fresher and cheaper.  And super easy.  Only change: no red wine vinegar.

This is very delicious. I use it on tostadas with shredded rotisserie chicken, in tortillas for burritos or as a dip. It is so bright, summery & flavorful. Lasts several days in the refrigerator & tastes better with time! Thanks Dawn!

This was super easy to make and really delicious.  I do not like cilantro so I eliminated it, but otherwise stuck with the recipe exactly.

Delish! Great salsa with chips for a party! I added a scoopful to my eggs the next morning with a little cheese - so yummy! The lime juice really saves the avocado from turning brown!

Perfect!  This also makes a wonderful, healthy lunch or snack.  It's something my husband and I would keep in the fridge at all times, and it's wonderfully healthy.  Thanks so much Dawn, this is a winner!

I absolutely loved this salsa and I don't even like black beans or avocados! Great with grilled fish. I forgot to add the corn but I definitely will add it next time!

Pure deliciousness!  I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and I wouldn't change a thing about it.  It is perfect for tortilla chips and it would be amazing on grilled fish or chicken.  I'm going wrap up some scrambled eggs and this salsa in a tortilla tomorrow morning for my breakfast!

This recipe is OK but if you add a tablespoon of sugar to it will make it fabulous.  
Kind of cuts the acidity a bit and gives it a finished flavor.  Try it!

This salsa is so fresh-tasting and delicious!!  It always gets compliments when I bring it to gatherings.  I follow the recipe as written except I leave out the onions because of personal preference.

Nice and light as a dip or a salad. Would recommend not using ripe avocado, but instead use some that have their firmness in tact.

Made the recipe as is and it was a hit at the office food day.  Next time I won't seed the jalapeno for some spice.  Definitely awesome as is though.

This is very good as a dip for chips or a side salad. I served it with Corn Tortilla Quiche as a brunch for my avocado loving mom and she was very happy! I did leave out the red wine vinegar and red peppers this time, but will try it with them next time. Great stuff!  Oops - used grilled corn on the cob, too.

This stuff is AMAZING! Perfect for a summer bbq. I don't even need chips, I'll eat it with a spoon. The only thing I did differently was use some good hot sauce mixed in because all the stores around me seem to have bland jalapenos. 
Absolutely LOVE!

This is so good. I make a similar black bean salad but it doesn't call for avocados. With the avocado there isn't a need for oil either. The combo is delicious especially the lime and cilantro flavors. I made this for my grandson's 13th birthday party thinking we would have something besides pizza for the adults. Ha! the boys ate it as well and some came back for seconds. Thanks Dawn.

This is fantastic! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. The next time, I improvised (for instance, we had 16-oz cans of corn, I added all three avocados because they were ripe, etc.). My husband is not normally a big fan of cilantro, but he likes it well enough in this recipe. I do, however, question the prep time of 15 minutes. From the time I placed the produce on the countertop until I put the finished product into the fridge, an hour had passed. Maybe I'm slow. At any rate, this is a keeper!!! Leftover salsa was great on top of tossed salad, in tacos/burritos with meat and cheese, on crackers. You name it!!

One of my favorite things to eat. Fresh and healthy. Great as a snack, side or part of the main dish. Yummy with rice. I leave out the bell and jalepeno peppers because of the kids, but it still tastes amazing!

Wow, incredible recipe!!  I made it as written, except I didn't add cilantro because my hubby doesn't like it, and I didn't have it on hand.  I love the fresh ingredients, the avocado stayed nice and green.  This dish is amazing, great with chips or wrapped in a flour tortilla.  I just want to keep eating it.  This recipe has the perfect balance of acidity and tanginess.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is very good! I had to add 1 clove of garlic and I ran out of fresh lime juice so I used some lemon juice. Very good!!

If you want to be the hit of the party, then bring this salsa! It is so delicious! Everytime I make it I'm asked for the recipe. I use an orange pepper instead of red to add another color. This recipe  yields so much (yay!) so if i make it just for my family, I mix all ingredients except the avocado. I divide the salsa into 2 containers. Then add one avocado to one container and serve. Wait to add the other avocado until you are ready to serve the next container.

This is really good as a dip or side dish.  I love that this recipe, as compared to similar recipes, doesn't have oil in it.  It's easy to put together for a group, too!

It was great! The only change I made was to add half a pound of cooked medium shrimp and about a tbsp of olive oil, and served it over toasted corn tortillas. Yum!

This salsa was so so.  It did not have an overabundance of flavor.  I was disappointed for the amount of work it took, and will not make it again.

Absolutely addicting!  I made this as written, with the exception of using less onion (my preference) and salt (my preference).   The only thing I would change is  maybe less avocado.  I love avocado, but 2 regular size ones was too much.  Next time I will try with just one.  Make sure the avocado is firm so it cuts up better and mixes in with the other ingredients well without turning to mush.  I made this recipe in the morning and didn't serve it til evening.  I didn't add in the avocado until a couple hours before I served it.  Also, I ran my lime around the bowl and on top of the plastic wrap - this definitely helped.  By the next morning some of the avocados were turning brown, but not as much as I expected.  Next time I may also substitute the red onions for green.  I loved this recipe - maybe even more than my Texas caviar one.  This recipe doesnt use oil or sugar so it is light and fresh tasting!  Thank you!!!

So good, So good, SO GOOD!!!  I added a shredded rotisserie chicken from Costco to make it a meal and took it on a picnic.  Brought along some flour tortillas so people could make it into a wrap - very tasty; thanks!!!

Easy and tasty! It's wonderful as written, but I prefer to use fresh corn instead of canned, omit the onion, and use pickled jalapeño.

Made this today, wonderful!  Do not buy the same avocados you'd buy for Guac.  Get slightly less ripe versions. This goes great with chips, on tacos, and more!

I loved it, and it was popular at the party.  It's a very fresh, tasty salsa.  I stuck to the recipe with the exception of using two jalapeno peppers instead of one.  I'll make again for sure.

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did differently is that I bought fresh corn and roasted the ears on the grill.  A little bit of overkill probably, but it was really good.  Highly recommended recipe!

Wonderful! I didn’t have peppers so I made this without and still it turned out great. I would recommend not omitting the red wine vinegar. It really adds to the flavor.

I made this for a ladies night get together. They loved it. I didn't use avocado in it because mine had become to ripe to use. So I left it out and it was still delicious. My red onion after chopped turned out to be a 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 but I love red onion so it worked for me. I also added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the dressing. Amazing.

Great!  Used 2 Roma’s instead of 4 (personal taste). Love how this turns out and holds up. Stir frequently.

Amazing recipe! I omit cilantro- it’s super strong with the amount called for, so if you don’t really love it, you may want to skip it or reduce the quantity.

Pretty good recipe. I added some powdered garlic and olive oil, as well as more cilantro. Left out the avocado just because I am using it to make guacamole, but it still tastes great without it! Will probably use this recipe for my next black bean salsa.

Wonderful healthy salad!  I used frozen white shoepeg corn instead of canned and added a drizzle of olive oil.  Also used half a hatch chile pepper instead of the jalapeno. Used this as the topping for turkey taco lettuce wraps.  Loved it!

This was a crowd pleaser.  Made it once per the recipe and it was cobbled up but personally felt it was too vinegary tasting.  Next time used just lime juice (juice of two limes) and I liked it much better.  Both versions were loved by my company.

This is one of the very best salads I have ever made or eaten.  Colorful, crunchy and so good with anything.  Eat it with tortilla chips or as a side.  And it gets better the next day.

I didn't have rice vinegar so I used plain.  Though everyone raved about it, I believe it would have been better with the rice vinegar.

I have made this time and time again. a true winner just as the recipe calls for, but depending on your crowd (kids minus jalapeno) you can tweak just a bit for personal preference. I've made this for years and always get requests at parties. Good for any occasion. Mahalo!

This recipe was fabulous!  It paired well with chips and as a topping on quesadillas and burritos.  I was hoping to also enjoy it as a side dish, but it was bit too acidic for my taste to eat on its own.  Next time I will try omitting the vinegar.  I used a cup of super sweet frozen corn kernels (thawed) in place of the canned corn.

Loved it and so did everyone at my fiesta!!  Made it just like the recipe except I added garlic because I love garlic in almost everything!  Loved the flavor of the lime in this!  Excellent side dish or salsa!

I sliced a mini-cucumber I had and gotta have minced garlic (2 cloves). It's almost like a salad. The avocado and lime are excellent in this dish.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Everybody loved it & they want the recipe. Only one nit:  This recipe takes MUCH longer than 15 min. to prepare - all that chopping, dicing and juicing.

I was worried about the red wine vinegar, but it gave it a very crisp and fresh taste.  Very good.

Even my kid who doesn't necessarily like tomatoes liked it!  I left out the jalepeno, and used Rot Tel diced tomatoes  with lime and cilantro, drained.  I also used just a bit of green onions instead of the red onion.   I used tons of cilantro, because we are big fans.  Loved it and will make it again.

I made it exactly as written except for using slightly microwaved frozen corn and black beans that I had cooked previously from dry beans. And I probably reduced the jalapeño because I plan to use it as a salad rather than a salsa.  It was delicious right away, without chilling two hours.

I made this for a friend's party and it was a hit!  The flavors and textures mix well. It is a refreshing and hearty dip for the summer. It doesn't keep well, so try to eat it the same day you make it.

This is just what I was looking for (to take to a party). It goes together quickly and the combination of lime juice and red wine vinegar was just right.  Definitely a success!

made this for the 2nd time in a week. we love it!!! it's light and refreshing as a snach after work.  the only thing i've changed is i used sweet vidalia onion, serranos and white wine vinegar (i don't have red wine vinegar so this is a sub).  i've even taken it to work for my friends to try & it's a hit!

4.5. This was very good. I was out of jalapeños and substituted a can of chipolte pepper in adobo sauce and fresh peaches. Just the right amount of sweet and heat. Went great with grilled pork loin and fresh veggies.

I've made this three times for cookouts & most everyone loved it! Some asked for the recipe. I followed the directions except I didn't add the jalepano  (sp?)& only one avocado. Delicious!!! Thank you for a healthy & delicious app!

Great (and super simple) recipe. I used yellow peppers, left out jalapeños, and had to use white wine. But for this "hates-to-cook-but-loves-good-food" gal... this was  near a perfect recipe. Three inspired ingredients which nudged me to search for this: avocado, tomato and cilantro in my produce box from HungryHarvest.com. Woohoo!! I made something tasty. Lol :)

This  is an amazing recipe! The whole family loved it.  I didn't have cilantro so that was the only ingredient I missed. My son ate it plain and my husband and I  ate it with tostidos. We will definitely make it again!

I made it as written (except for green pepper, because I didn't have one), and I didn't add the avocado in the bowl, but instead used a cut up avocado as my base. I then scooped the salsa over the avocado, and put some tuna next to it all on a plate, and it was a yummy lunch!!

Delicious!  Everyone loves this and it's very easy to throw together.   I pretty much follow the recipe but do add some cumin spice.   Great, healthy side dish.

This was really good. My husband doesn't like black beans or cilantro and even he loved it. I had to substitute scallions for the red onion, as I didn't have any red onion in the house. I will use red onion next time. But still yummy.

This was a delicious and quick recipe. I have another recipe that I enjoy a little bit more than this, otherwise it would be a 5 star recipe. We all enjoyed this one VERY much though and I made this for a group of over 30 people with no complaints. Thank you!
