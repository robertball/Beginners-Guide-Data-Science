Quick, delicious and healthy meal the whole family enjoyed.  Only change I made was omit the bamboo shoots (I don't care for them) and add about 1/2 cup diced red onion along with the other vegetables, then topped with green onion.  Even if you think you don't like bison, you will love it in this recipe!

I made a few minor changes to use what I had on hand (1/2 tsp powdered ginger in place of fresh, 1 can drained mushrooms in place of fresh, 1 cup frozen broccoli in place of fresh). I omitted the bamboo shoots. I used stir fry sauce instead of teriyaki sauce. This recipe was awesome!! The amount of sauce was perfect for the veggies / meat, and the bison was absolutely delicious in this recipe. Tender, great texture, and wonderful flavor. I am looking forward to making this again soon!! I did add a little salt and pepper to the meat while it was cooking as well - not sure if it really affected the flavor or not.

Good but not great.  Sauce wasn't quite thick enough for my taste.

The sauce is really good. I recommend using salt and pepper on the veges and the meat before cooking. The bison is tender and low in fat and calories which makes it a nice alternative to beef, but I have to admit I did miss the beef flavoring a bit in this recipe. The bison is not as flavorful and even tasted slightly gamey for me.

This was tasty, but I followed the recipe and was disappointed by how thin the sauce was.  Super salty as well.  Next time I will cut down the broth to 1/2 c and use low sodium teriyaki sauce.

This was the best beef stir fry I have ever made. Subbed beef ribeye and water chestnuts for bison & bamboo. My ribeye had a lot of fat so I cut it out and rendered it down, then mixed that with veg oil for stir frying. The whole family loved it!

We had leftover filet mignon so used that instead of the bison.  Next time will have with a pasta, like linguine.

My family loved this recipe. Although I changed it up a bit. I used regular steak instead of buffalo (just what I had frozen), I used frozen chopped broccoli instead of fresh and water chestnuts instead of bamboo shoots (grocery store was out). I used microwaved brown rice (2 packages). The sauce was really yummy and my 10 year old boy loved it.
