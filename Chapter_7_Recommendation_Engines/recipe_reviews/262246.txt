I liked it and my husband loved it. I used Bulk sausage (the kind in the tube you use for Thanksgiving stuffing) with Sage seasoning.  I felt it wasn't flavorful enough and next time will definitely use actual Italian sausage. To make up for the flavor deficiency, I added Spices.. fennel seed,paprika , garlic etc plus red pepper for spice.  I cut the broccoli small because I don't like raw broccoli, and had to cook it part way with lid on the pan to get the broccoli cooked enough for me.  In the end, when served with the cheese, it was pretty good and a nice one pan dinner. To be honest I didnt taste the Spaghetti Squash very much and might add more salt to it once removed from the skin as well as some butter.

The family really liked it. I didn’t alter it and it seemed in the healthy side, so I’d make it again.
