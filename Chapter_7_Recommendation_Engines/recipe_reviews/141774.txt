Made as written except that I got home with sardines instead of anchovies somehow. My review is not based on that error of mine though because well little fish take on the mighty big and bold fish taste and it was my least favorite part of the recipe. Leave the fish off altogether and you have one tasty flavorful salad. Honestly I feel fish has no place in this when you already have the salty SPAM.  I added some tomatoes and red onion for color and used the cashews I already had on hand in place of the peanuts. Great salad but leave off the fish unless you absolutely love fish. It overpowers and I like fish.
