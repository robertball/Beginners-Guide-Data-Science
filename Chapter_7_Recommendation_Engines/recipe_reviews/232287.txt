This salad is delicious. We made two versions. We tweaked the ‘made recipe as written’ by subbing 1 tbsp Stevia in the Raw for the sugar and used fresh Italian parsley (probably closer to a tablespoon than a teaspoon). The 2nd version took the ‘made recipe as written’ and added about 1/8 teaspoon curry powder and 1/8 heaping teaspoon cayenne pepper powder. We felt the version with curry and cayenne took an already outstanding crab salad to an even higher level. While this was not tried, you might be able to cut the Hellmann’s mayo to 1/4 cup without sacrificing any taste while eliminating some fat. Rather than use crackers, we had this for lunch. We laid 3-4 romaine lettuce leaves on a 10 inch flour tortilla, spooned on the crab salad, and then wrapped them. Makes for a quick and easy lunch!! A really great recipe, Mel . . . and yes, we didn’t make enough.

I signed up just to review this recipe because this is now my favorite thing to eat!  From the start, I substituted Old Bay for the sugar - there's enough sweetness in the crab already - and it worked out great.  I use equal amounts of light mayo, fat free sour cream, and light ranch, just enough to coat the crab, not gloopy.  I also use a ton more celery and parsley and add some finely chopped green onion.  

Don't skimp on the fresh parsley!!!  When you first taste it, you should think "Wow, I added way too much parsley."  If you don't, add more.  As it sits overnight, the flavors combine and the parsley really makes the crab flavors pop, and balances out the green onion in a beautiful way.

I struggled a bit at first with getting the crab to the right size.  I tried chopping it, then tearing it by hand, and finally tried a potato masher, and this makes it so simple!  Now, I just dump the crab in the bottom, throw the rest of the ingredients on top, then mash it to break up the crab, while thoroughly combining all the other ingredients.  So easy and delicious!

Excellent flavor, consistency and visual appeal.  I'm not very keen on the light Ranch but it adds kind of tangy zip to this.  I followed the recipe exactly and it does remind me of the Golden Corral recipe but I know this is low fat.  Oh, I also used reduced fat Helmans Mayo, 15 cal a tbls.  So it's pretty low fat too.

I've made this twice in 4 days, it was that good! I followed the recipe exact and it was really good. The next time I made a few changes based on other reviews and a few of my own and somehow it was even better! I scaled the mayo back to 1/4 cup (used Hellman's light) and also added about 1/8 cup of light sour cream. I used about 2 tsp of parsley and 3/4 cup celery. I added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and about 1/8 cup shredded mild cheddar cheese. The sour cream subdued the mayo flavor a bit which I prefer. The cayenne and small amount of cheese gave it a nice little kick. Follow the recipe to a T or make some small tweaks to suit your tastes like I did, either way its delicious!!

My search for the perfect crab salad is over. I've made this several times and the only thing I've changed is cutting back the mayo to 1/4 cup. Definitely a keeper. Filed under my TNT folder.

how can anything this good be this easy? HEY, I'm almost a food snob...ALMOST  ok, I used equal amounts sour cream, mayo and ranch dressing. it was difficult to allow this to conjugate all night, but never interrupt a love fest :) I did use all ingredients and then added some Cajun seasonings wrapped in romaine lettuce and added some Italian shredded cheese. my snob card has been officially cancelled. thanks mis7up!

I needed 5# of crab salad. I bought two 2.5lb. imitation crab flakes from Sam's. Quickly found out that I did not have the patience to pull the flakes apart, so I stacked the layers and sliced diagonal strips with a sharp knife and set aside. I mixed all the other ingredients in small mixing bowl. Used Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing as that is my favorite ranch dressing. I also add sour cream for additional creaminess. I diced the celery as small as possible by hand as I love the flavor and coloring, but did not want it to overpower the texture and flavor of the salad. I stacked the celery stalks, 4 at a time, cut it into thin strips and then another thin cut across about 4 inches at a time down the entire stalk. All ingredients were in proportion to the 5 lbs. of crab. Due to the amount of salad I was making, I layered first the crab and then the creamy dressing in a large mixing bowl, mixing after each layer.  Refrigerated overnight. Flavorful and an excellent choice for one of my three contributions to the family get together for Christmas Day Dinner.

DELICIOUS! I mixed up a half batch of this to make a sandwich filling for the girls for lunch and they absolutely LOVED it! I couldn't quit taking 'tastes' of it and ended up eating the rest w/ pretzels...I can see why your daughter doesn't wanna share, lol. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing, Mel! :)

Love this recipe. I, too, used some Old Bay seasoning. Instead of parsley, I added fresh Dill (just because I had fresh Dill on hand and happen to love the freshness Dill adds). I added all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid mixer and let the mixer shred my crab and mix all at once. Love that mixer!

Very simple, yet excellent flavor. I made this as a side dish this evening and even the kids loved the taste and texture. I added a spoonful of chopped dill pickles and I cut down a bit on the sugar.

Excellent when prepared as written, the overnight refrigeration does finalize the flavor.

I have found that slicing the celery into lengthwise thin strips then cutting to approx. 1 inch lengths adds nice texture. 

I usually make a double batch, I like to add two full size carrots, peeled, and then shred on a cheese grater (largest shred size)... this adds vibrant color and does not diminish the taste. Also I use freshly prepared hidden valley ranch dressing  (seasoning packet, mayo, milk) instead of the bottled kind.

I have made it this way several times, everyone loves it!

This is great!  I did not wait to eat it though.  It might have been better the next day but, I never found out because it was so good.  I did use regular buttermilk ranch though because I don't like the fat free or reduced calorie. I only used a 1/4 cup of mayo and I added a little bit of cream to give it that extra that it needed from the reduction of mayo.  It was great.  Will make this again!!!

I used the Stevia, like a previous reviewer suggested, in place of the sugar.  And dried parsley as I didn't have fresh.  Excellent recipe!

This was swell-Mel!  Simple ingredients and no fuss.  I used 2 forks to shred the fish ... I mean crab.  Everyone commented how good it was and I just smiled because it was so easy.

I have made this salad several times, each with rave reviews from family and friends.  To extend the quantity for pot luck sharing, I have added 2 cups cooked pasta (elbow macaroni or small shells work well), 1/4 cup frozen peas (thawed) and 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.

This was a winner in our house!  We used a locally made ranch dressing (Dreisbach's), but otherwise didn't change a thing.  We'll be adding this to our recipebox as our go-to crab salad recipe.  We won't need to buy it at the store anymore ;).

Make this over and over - wonderful as is, but better with a dash of curry and cayenne pepper as others have suggested.

Great taste!  I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and all of the Seafood Salads I find at the deli counters contain the standard imitation crab, which contain gluten.   I have really been craving seafood salad since diagnosis but finally found some imitation crab that was gluten free.  Found this recipe and whipped up a batch.  The addition of sugar seemed a little strange, but I tasted it before adding and it was not quite right (too vinegary) so added the sugar and it's perfect!  I did add some tiny shrimp too and now I can have my seafood salad without the gluten and for way cheaper!!!!

I found your recipe and just loved it.  I live on a boat with my husband and we enjoy our weekends out with friends on the river.  Well it is that time of year and I make all kinds of quick salads.  My favorite ver. I have is that I love wasabi in my salads and I add it to this recipe and then what makes it great is to serve them on lil hawaian rolls as sandwiches and they are awesome!!!

I rarely leave reviews but I just finished making this and it's my new fave! My grocery had 16oz imitation crab meat for BOGO so I got a couple. I made a recipe (not this one) and it was awful. So I thought I'd try again and this was PERFECT. 

My tweaks (personal preference/taste):

Canned peas (instead of celery/onion/carrot because I'm not a fan of any of those and didn't have carrots)
Dried parsley
1/2 cup Hellman's mayo, 1/4 cup Southwest Ranch

Otherwise, I followed it exactly and it turned out so yummy! Cooked frozen peas would have been better, as they hold their texture a bit better (firmer) but alas, I had none. So, I made do with canned but it is perfect for a lunch sandwich! 

Thank you!

Ok so I totally changed this recipe because of the calories.  I used rice wine vinegar about 1/2 cup,  2 tsp sesame seed oil, juice of a lemon , chopped scallions, cilantro and a touch of red pepper flakes for heat. Really good.

Definitly needed green onions or something.  We felt the sugar didn't taste right, & have been making since without sugar & with about 4-6 green onions, to receive raves.   Blessings!!!

This was easy and delicious.  I tasted just like I remember various crab salads tasting that I had had at buffets and parties.  I substituted Miracle Whip and it gave it a great tanginess.  This is so good you can eat it right off the spoon if you can't wait to go get a cracker. Ha!

Loved it every time I have made it! This last time I had leftover crab and shrimp so I threw those in the little chopper I have, the same with a couple of the light green celery with tops and a bit of red onion to give them a fine grind. I chopped the imitation crab for texture.  Low fat Ranch and low fat mayo to the desired constancy, no sugar, sometimes green onions if I have them, and more like 1/8 c of parsley because I like it like that.  I add lemon juice with the fresh seafood and Old Bay or Cajun seasoning for a little kick! Alter how you like and it is pleasing! Thank you for sharing!!!!

I loved it! Next time I'll add some elbow pasta, sour cream and some green grapes finely chopped. If it goes well, I'll come back...

Great imitation crab salad! I never thought to use ranch dressing but it really gives the salad a great zip. The fresh parsley is also a key ingredient. I served it as an appetizer on toasted baguette slices. I put the leftovers on a grilled bulkie roll the next day, awesome sandwich!

I just eye balled the ranch dressing, mayo and celery then chopped up leg style fake crab and added some dried parsley and sugar, black pepper, and about a pound of frozen peas, stirred it all together and it was SO good!. It's really good over chopped lettuce as a light but filling dinner. Will definitely make again! Yum!

I added a little mustard to mine in place of ranch and celery because I hate celery and ranch just didn't sound right. We ate 4 sandwiches worth and it was delicious. Also added a little chives and Italian seasoning for kick because it was a little mayo-y

This is an awesome recipe! I pretty much followed it the way it was written. I added some green onion and chopped my celery finer than what was in the original pic. Definitely letting it sit overnight made all of the juices combine and give it a really good flavor. Will add to my favorites list!!

I will never have to buy crab salad again!  I loved the taste of the sauce. I probably cut back the mayo a little from what the recipe calls for, but I did not measure exactly. I also used green onions instead of parsley. The tip in another review of using a potato masher to separate the crab flakes worked excellently and I just mixed the whole salad with that. I look forward to making this many more times! Thank you for sharing!

This dip is fabulous! I made it for a potluck at work and was asked for the recipe by at least a dozen people....not too shabby considering there are only about 25 people in the department! Super easy to make- I took the advice of one reviewer who suggested layering the imitation crabmeat in a bowl and adding the rest of the ingredients on top and then mashing/cutting/mixing it all together. I'm too lazy to shred crab and (I must admit) using a knife and a spoon to mush it all up was kind of therapeutic. I also took the advice of another kind reviewer who implied that more parsley = more happy. Served with Ritzy type crackers and all of a sudden...my co-workers weren't half as terrible as on a non-dip days and I'm sure they felt the same about me. Is it possible for a dip to improve lives?  Bond people together? Create harmony? I don't know..but if it is..this is the dip I'm bringing. Thanks for the recipe!

As written it was too bland.  After adding red bell peppers, carrots, green onions, old bay, pinch of curry and cayenne and minced garlic it was just OK for us.  I did omit the sugar because the "crab" was sweet enough.  Maybe next time I'll try to make it into a cheesey hot dip.

Since the imitation crab surimi that I bought came in a block of compacted pieces, I just sliced the block first one way and then the other into a pea-sized dice using a serrated knife (rather than tediously prying the block apart and then slicing the individual pieces into some other sort of bite-sized shape). I also used a lot of celery, likewise cutting that into a pea-sized dice. I omitted the sugar, and substituted some dried parsley that I had on hand for the fresh, which I didn't have. I also added a lot of ground black pepper and ground coriander, the latter for its lemony flavor. The result was about as good as anything that anyone might ever make of imitation crab. I'm only giving it four stars, though, just because I don't think imitation crab will ever be a top-notch ingredient! (Crab snob?)

So easy - and very tasty. This tastes similar to the seafood salad a local meat market sells for $9.99 a pound, but can be simply made for under $5!

Simple recipe and very good. I added a pinch of dried dill. Thanks for the recipe because I usually just buy it from the grocery store but they put shrimp in theirs which I don't care for and this recipe tastes way better.

Taste like coleslaw or potato salad  and way to much goop, maybe this is a west coast thing but everyone here prefers just light mayo and sour cream with some old bay, the ranch and all the mayo with celery was not a hit and was a waste of crab because you could not taste much but the ranch and the celery hid it. Green onions would have been a better choice than celery.

To salvage this we scraped off all the mayo and ranch and added some granulated garlic and some black pepper  and guests liked it better but still not good but plenty of people on here seem to like it so maybe its a regional thing but not anywhere near Maryland and for us, sorry Mel

This just tasted off. Not sure what it was but it was most definitely NOT edible. I'm from Maryland where crab is our thing and one of my favorite things ever and I could NOT force myself to eat this. Do not try this!!!! It ruined a pound of fresh lump crab meat

I made this with the shredded imitation crab. It was so good! I hate the taste of mayo, so I mixed the mayo and ranch together separately first, then I added the other ingredients. I never tasted the mayo. It was just all deliciousness!!

This was delicious! Per other reviews, I only used 1/3 cup ranch and 1/3 cup mayo and replaced the sugar with Old Bay Seasoning. Very tasty!

I make this about once a month on average, more in the summer.
I use regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and add about 1/3 cup.
I add 3 Tb. sugar
and a little black pepper to the recipe.  Other than that its the same.
EVERYONE raves about this crab salad!  I love it!

For years I would buy the deli crab salad and settled that this is the way it was suppose to taste. I made this recipe per the directions and it is fantastic. I will never buy deli again! I gave some to my sister who always did same (deli) and she agreed. This is our new go to recipe.

I love the imitation crab salad so figured is try malong it. Found this recipie and while it is very good it seem to be missing something. I added some finely chopped white onion, celery salt, dill and bay seasoning. Served it over avacado and it was fabulous. It tasted best after it sat in the fridge overnight.

Definitely add a little cayenne pepper to give this a little kick.  Also added a little salt.  Very good with avocado for a quick and easy keto friendly snack or lunch.

Loved this ! So easy and quick :) Shredded the crab with two forks because I like the chunkier Crab Salad ~ Not a fan of celery so I added scallions and green peppers instead ! Delish! I know I will be making again :)

Sorry, I totally revamped this but the basic recipe was what I needed to start. I made a huge batch with real crab that was supposed to last a couple of days. It was so rich we had a hard time finishing it. The crab and celery go really well together and I would do this again but follow the recipe for a nice salad.

Spiced it up a bit with Old Bay and cayenne. Added a bit of chopped green onion to make up for the blandness of LF Ranch. Yes it will become a staple in this house.

I was very impressed with this salad.  I didn't have any crab so I used small cooked shrimp.  The only thing I did was to add bow tie pasta to make it go a little further.

Looking for new things to make this summer, I thought of things I love at restaurants.  Crab salad was the first thing I thought of.  Oh, my goodness this is good and easy.  It has quickly become a staple at my house.

I made this 3 days ago (without the celery simply because I'm not a big fan of it...I substituted 1 green pepper & half of an onion) & it was amazing!!! I didn't bother with crackers, me & my 5-year-old ate it by the spoonful! We finished it last night, which caused another trip to the store today so I can make more. Lesson learned...now I'm making double the recipe!

I always crave crab salad from Golden Corral....my husband hates me because I make the entire family go eat there, just to satisfy my craving so we basically pay about $50 for crab salad! :-O He's pretty happy that I found this because it costs less than $10 to satisfy my cravings! :-)

Really good recipe.  Added 2tsp Old Bay, 2tsp black pepper.  Don't think this is going to last overnight in fridge maybe a couple of hours at best.

Good - notes:
Careful with sugar, taste first. 
I added Apple cider vinegar (1 tbp) and pepper to taste to it, and extra parsley and diced celery.  However, Mine got too sweet, which is why I added vinegar ( it is tart enough to hide some sweetness). The too sweet was my fault, the dressing was sweet and I added stevia and some sugar, so my variations made it sweet.

This stuff is delish. I made it as directed but added Old bay. A little sweet, so maybe less sugar next time, but there will definitely be a next time.

This is my first time making crab salad and it turned out wonderful. I didn't have any celery so I used pickles instead. I swapped sweet rice vinegar for the sugar.

Loved it! Just like in the Chinese restaurants. I used 2 lbs imitation crab, 1cup celery & 1/2 cup red onions with same amount of dressing, mayo & sugar recipe called for. Also used dried parsley.

This is only as good as the imitation crab that you have available in your area.  If it doesn't taste like crab straight out of the package, then it ain't gonna taste like crab when you turn it into crab salad

This basic recipe is a good place to start. I only used a pinch of sugar, then cautiously added regular ranch and mayo but tasted as I added. Tastes good to me.

Ever since I tasted crab salad in a restaurant over 25 years ago, I have wanted to make it for myself. Finally I found a recipe that I felt I could make. What I found was thatcrab salad is incredibly easy and very adaptable. I actually combined this with another recipe. I added green pepper but omitted the tomato since I am allergic to tomato.  If I were making it for myself, I would add black olives. I want to take the salad to my next monthly potluck!

OMG....best Crab Salad SIMPLE recipe ever!!!  I did a couple of tweaks that totally put it even more over the top.  I added some Old Bay seafood seasoning and a little bit f squeezed lemon juice.  I cater and have had several people request for me to make them some.  I truly thank you for this one!!  Oh, I only signed up for this site just to provide the feedback.  That's typically not me :)

Excellent recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a tsp of Ole Bay seasoning. I used Olive Oil light Mayo. I also substituted Splenda for the sugar. I could see using this as a base by adding peas, shredded cheese, and endless other possibilities, not that it's needed. This was really good and simple.

Love this recipe.  My family loves a spicy crab salad so we used hidden valley spicy ranch instead of the buttermilk.  this is best made a day ahead of time so ask the flavors meld together.  oh also added green onions as we like onions.  thank you for a great recipe!!!

Fantastic flavor.  I made it with twice as much parsley.  I found that using a chopstir as found on chopstir.com dies an excellent job of breaking up the crab meat in no time at all.

Excellent recipe, I have tried many but I never found what I was looking for, this is very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference was I used the mayo with olive oil because it was all I had. Still delicious, thank you so much

Great recipe but I felt that it needed a bit more flavor. I added a TBLS of lime juice, 1/2 cup finely chopped/sliced lettuce and 1/4 tsp pepper.

Followed the recipe, but instead of ranch dressing used a packet of hidden valley ranch seasoning with two teaspoons of Vegan mayo and stevia in the raw.

Decent recipe. I took advice from the other reviewers and used half as much dressing, it would have been way too much. I omitted the milk and used extra vinegar in place of it and added a teaspoon of dill weed as a suggestion from the back of the crabmeat package.

I had some left over crab legs & didn't know what to do with them so I cracked & removed the meat, found this recipe & used all the ingredients listed. I eyeballed everything because I was not sure how much meat I had & figured you couldn't go wrong either way. I added salt & pepper to taste & put it on a fresh sandwich roll it was delish!!!!! And I'm so happy that meat did not go to waste. I will def make this again.

Delicious!, But needed a little salt, possibly because we used fresh crab, which is not as salty as imitation crab. We didn't have parsley, so I substituted 1/8 cup of tabouli. Served over 1/2 of avocado. Will definitely make again.

I tweaked this quite a bit for our tastes, used real crab and more than directions stated (probably twice the amount), real ranch instead of reduced fat, basil instead of parsley, and stevia instead of sugar. I also added bacon and red onion. Served on lettuce with tomatoes and avocado. Really creamy, tasty, and delicious. Thanks!

I used dried parsley and added it to the mayo to rehydrate. An additional ingredient was a pinch of celery seed.

This is full of flavor!  We aren't crazy about celery so I very finely chopped red and green pepper for the crunch the celery would have given it.  This will definitely be one of my go to salads for summer!

This is such a basic simple recipe and it is a great "base" as some have said.  You can customize it so easily.  I did everything from the original except:
I didn't add sugar (i simply forgot)
and added some old bay seasoning and just a tad bit of sweet bell pepper.  I served it on a bed of fresh lettuce.  It is perfect!  Any tweaking and it can be perfect for all tastes.

This recipe is really good.  I did omit the parsley and
served this dish after chilling it.
Chopped the imitation crab, added vidalia onion,
green pepper & celery,  all chopped fine. 
I used a little more Miracle whip than the fat-free
ranch dressing and a smaller amount of sour cream.No sugar needed.
This is a real keeper!

Love how easy this is to make! I've been craving crab salad but didn't like the look of the salad offered at the store. This is definitely fresh and better tasting. I will be making this again soon.
