It was okay... but wayyyy too many servings! I cut it down to 10. I thought that was enough. I t was for me and my daughter... so I didn't need that much! But it was good.

I didn't care for it. I didn't think it was spicy enough.

Even halved, this makes a ton of sauce. I scaled it to 53 servings to get it to one 14.5 ounce can of whole tomatoes. I am torn on how to rate this. First bite in and the sweetness from the carrot was almost too much for me but then the heat sneaks up and gets you. The heat part was nice but the sweetness not so much for me. My husband on the other hand started going nuts over it right away. He really liked the sweet/heat combo and everything about the sauce. So with that being said, I'm giving it a 4. I like that it is packed full of veggies but just not sure about the carrots.
