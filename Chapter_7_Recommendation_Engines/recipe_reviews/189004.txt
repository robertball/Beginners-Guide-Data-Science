Don't be afraid of the prunes! While I'm not a prune fan on an everyday basis, these are amazing! I was eating them like candy at my sister's birthday before she told me what they were. Luckily, as many as I ate, they didn't have the, umm, effect, that prunes are known for. The salty bacon and sweet prune are a perfect combo!

So fabulously easy to make, and everyone absolutely loves them. A real crowd pleaser. I used toothpicks. Don't change a thing!

These are delicious, and a favorite appetizer with my family for all events!!  I've been making them for the last 2 1/2 years ever since I had them in Nicaragua and had to have the recipe then and there!  They are so simple...it's hard to believe they'd be so good.  Make sure you halve the bacon as a whole strip is too much (it doesn't cook up nice and crisp with a whole piece-- I can't really handle "slimy" bacon!).  While prunes aren't bad on their own, everything's better wrapped in bacon!

We had an exchange student one year, a long time ago who made these. We were so surprised at how good they were, and it's so simple you have to try them. Yumm!

Had purchased, by accident, THICK bacon, and no time to repurchase thinner bacon..so...cut bacon LENGTHWiSE into a thinner strip and they came out fine. While it was a "happy accident", I would not recommend it! Thinner bacon would be better. They were gobbled up by 60 people and they wanted MORE :)

I love these!  My brother-in-law summed it up best by saying, "Wow!  Proof that bacon makes everything good!"  These are typical fare in New Zealand, where they call them Devils on Horseback (if you're looking for a more appetizing, though intriguing, name).

I'll admit I was nervous, but these are fantastic. I made one batch for a covered dish and 24 wasn't near enough. I had to keep them in the oven a lot longer than 12 minutes. I think if it had flipped them, they would have gotten crispier faster. But absolutely fabulous!

Made this for the Dinner and a Movie party, too.  The movie was "Dracula:  Dead and Loving It."  These really did look like eyes of ox.  Loved the flavor.

I loved these.  My husband liked them and came back for more.  My children ages had mixed reactions but overall they went well.  We had them as a treat.  The kids thought they looked cool.  I think we may add them to our fun Halloween treats.
