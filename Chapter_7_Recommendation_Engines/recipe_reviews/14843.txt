I have finally solved the "too bland" problem for this recipe.  I mixed in 1/4 cup KRAFT PARM PLUS-ZESTY RED PEPPER (Parmesan cheese) to the dough mix.  I also used a cheese cloth to squeeze the juices from the spinach.  Perfect!!  I made this for a party, and set out little recipe cards...and returned home with none.  I am so impressed by this recipe!  I do think that they taste best served warm.  And I LOVE the fact that you can make these little beauties up to three months in advance, cut them up & bake them whenever.  ENJOY!!

If you use Pillsbury crescent rolls and press each two-roll section together you will find a easy, tasty dough to use instead of the homemade pastry.

I do catering on the side, and decided to try this interesting recipe for a job I just did.  What a hit!  Everyone loved them, even some who claimed not to like spinach.  I skipped the fry pan for the spinach and used to microwave.  Also added 4 strips of cooked and cumbled bacon to the finished filling.  Very good, but will try adding more next time!  Dough for this was so good, and would be excellent with a variety of fillings.

Great recipe!  I made these for my parents anniversary party and everyone raved about them.  I made them a few weeks before and did not slice the loaves.  I froze them whole and then the morning of the party I took them out of the freezer and let them sit out for a few hours and them sliced them.  They sliced perfectly this way.  They were time consuming to make but it was so worth the effort it took.

These looked and tasted fantastic.  There was enough from this recipe to make two generous plates of pinwheels, which I took to two different parties.  I left the rolls frozen until the day I needed them and then defrosted slightly to cut into pinwheel rounds.  The rounds cut very well when the rolls were still partially frozen and were very even, cut this way.  Lots of people at the two parties I went to asked for the recipe, which shows how popular this recipe is.

This would be an excellent appetizer if you didn't have to prepare it youself.  It just took too long (I'm a new cook, so take that into account.)  It was also a little on the bland side, we topped it with a little salsa to spice it.  The dough needed something else...not sure what.

I just made these for my husband's surprise party this past weekend and they were a hit!  Everyone loved them, and there was a comment made that they were a nice alternative to the ones stuffed with tons of meat and cheese. The only change I made was to add real garlic rather than garlic powder for that extra punch.  I'm definately making these for Christmas. :)

I have made this several times. I have also used the dough recipie for potpies, and the spinach and mushroom recipe makes a great base for mushroom soup!

i didn't mind the work that went into these.  the dough was easy to make and work with, and the filling was tasty.  for some reason, my second roll turned out a bit better than the first (as in it held together better) but i think that may have had something to do with flouring the surface really thoroughly - that makes it much easier.  they were a hit at my holiday party and they looked great on the plate!!

I recently served these at a party and they were a hit.  The vegetarians loved a special treat and the meat eaters loved them too!  I doubled the parmesan cheese and used half a carrot for color.  Other than that the only advice I would have it to really squeeze the spinach mixture well.  I squeezed small amounts in my hand until it was as dry as possible.  The dough isn't as hard to work with and the bite size pieces don't fall apart.
I will definately make them again!  So easy and good.

I made these pinwheels for a bridal shower and they were a hit! I used refrigerated pastry dough instead of making my own, just to save time, and it tasted great. Also, I added a few extra things like red bell peppers and slices of ham. I made the rolls about 2 weeks before the party, froze them, and then just thawed them, sliced, baked and served. So easy!

Based on comments about blandness of dough and filling, I added some paprika, parmesan cheese and a litle garlic salt to the dough.  For the filling, I used half olive oil and half butter to saute. To the spinach-mushroom mixture, I added a bunch of chopped fresh dill, crumbled feta cheese (make sure the pieces are very small), a large clove of finely chopped garlic, and additional salt and freshly ground pepper.  Everyone loved them.  I'm interested in making them smaller next time--maybe rolling up the dough the long way instead of the short way ...

Instead of making the pinwheels, I used puff pastry and put a small square in a tiny muffin pan and then filled it with the filling.  I added sour cream and garlic to the filling--with those changes they were great.

Very good, but I did change the filling.  First, I used three types of mushrooms: portobello, porcini and canned.  Sauteed with the onion, garlic and deglazed with a little wine and reduced. Added de spinach, grated gouda cheese, a little cream and parmesan. Chopped it in the food processor and omitted oregano.  Will do again.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the pinwheels turned out very nicely. I felt that they were missing something, but my sister-in-law and her husband insisted they were wonderful! Next time I will fry some bacon with the vegetable mixture to give it some added flavor. Otherwise this was a great recipe!

I had problems rolling out the dough after letting it chill for an hour.  Otherwise, this recipe was great!  The pastry came out wonderfully, and it was a big hit with my guests.  Next time I might try adding shredded mozzarella to the spinach mixture, but it's good as-is too!

WOW! I did make these a little differently but they turned out to be the biggest hit of my party. I actually bought some premade Pillsbury crescent dough (just to save some time) then after making the filling (same except I left out the flour) I added about half a package of cream cheese to the mixture. It made it creamy and rich and the flavors from the filling stood up well.

My daughter made these for a New Year's Eve party and they were delicious!!!!  We used frozen puff pastry to save time, glad we did.  Also, we added chopped roasted red pepper (in the jar) to the filling and loved it!!!  Highly recommend.  I plan on making these ahead and keeping them in the freezer for company.

Used the suggestions for puff pastry and 1/2 cup shredded swiss cheese for extra flavor (and less work). Did not use all of them for my party and took some to work with some mild black bean and white corn salsa. A co-worker who caters asked for the recipe. I've already made more to stock my freezer. Love this recipe.

Time consuming to make and I was ok with that.  Rolled out fine, wonderful smell when it was baking.  But tasted absolutely awful.  We  had 10 people over and only 1 person liked them.  I will never make again and was so disappointed I wasted so much time on something that ended up in the trash.

These were delicious. I added 6 strips of bacon which I cooked with the onion and mushrooms. The dough was very crumbly when working with it. It's almost like working with shortbread dough so after mixing the dough I put the crumbly mixture into a zip lock bag and pressed the crumbs to form a dough. I put this into the fridge overnight then rolled it out which made it much easier to work with.

My wife made this dish last weekend on Mothers Day.  I was stunned when I realized that she was making pastry dough since so many pinwheel recipes use Pillsbury tube dough...  Anyway - what a huge hit!!!  We added some tomato for some color but followed the recipe as is.  Delicious!  A note of caution – we baked these on a cookie sheet covered with tin foil and almost didn’t get them off the foil!  No foil next time – we’ll spray the pan.

I made these for a Halloween party....I made them two weeks prior to the party, froze the logs and pulled them out of the fridge the morning of the party. They came out perfect! I did use fresh mushrooms. Everyone loved them.

I used fresh spinach and found the taste very pleasant, not too bland at all.  I didn't chill my dough long enough though, and it split when I rolled it.  I also recommend slicing with a serrated knife.  But they turned out fairly pretty despite the mishaps, and were all eaten hastily at my party.

This was easy but it's not simple enough for a beginner.  I would definitely make these again, but I suggest more spices to perk up the blandness of the spinach, etc.  Maybe some hot sauce added to the spinach mixture.  This is wonderful to keep in the freezer for last-minute entertaining or a party.  Make sure to grease the pan before baking.  This is elegant and easy to prepare in advance, which I loved.

This was an excellent recipe.

I've actually traded out the ingredients before and put hot salami, cheese and pizza sauce to make pizza rolls and they turn out amazing!

A lot of work and needed extra seasoning, but pretty tasty in the end! I took another reviewer's advice and added Parmesan, paprika and a dash of cayenne to the dough.

Very good recipe-I used fresh garlic ilo powder, a little bit of cream cheese and 1 egg in a filling to keep it all together better. Made it for the party for first time w/o a "test drive" and it was a success. Thanks for great recipe.

I used 25 store-bought uncooked croissant rolls,  squished together and rolled out, instead of making the dough. I added 5 strips bacon, 2 cloves garlic, and doubled the salt. I still found them a little bland, but they were yummy nonetheless. It made 30 rolls.

Easy to make, just plan ahead. I thought they would be a bit smaller - 3-4in across.

The taste was wonderful but the dough was a huge pain. It was easy to make but a hassle to cut. No matter how long I chilled the roll, it was next to impossible to cut it without squishing the whole thing flat.   If you have the time and patience for this, it is completely worth it. So yummy! Just don't expect nice clean, even spirals!

I made this for a party and it was a hit!!! I am now always asked to make these for any family function or dinner I go to!  I found that it is easer to cut the pinwheels when the dough is frozen. I also tried pre-made dough from the store and it was ok but you need 2 layers for it to hold the spinach mix in well.  Very yummy!!!

This recipe (as is) is quite bland.  It has a great presentation though and worth doctoring up and trying again.  A little time consuming but once the seasonings are right will be worth it.  The dough was dry & tasteless, but easy to roll out and work with.  Would suggest adding seasonings to the dough & rolling a little thinner, also spice up the filling quite a bit.

I used a couple of cloves of garlic and fresh spinach when I cooked this one up!  It was excellent.  The whole family loved it.  It is a little labor intensive, but definitely worth it in the end!

This has quickly become a favorite!  I've made them twice so far and each time they have been a hit.  The beauty is that they can be made ahead of time and frozen (that's what attracted me to this recipe in the first place).  What a timesaver!!  I've also varied the recipe a little, adding more spices and even finely chopped nuts!  These are really terrific for parties and taste great.

Love this one, and I used recommendations from other reviewers.  Crescent rolls are the only way to go, (that homemade pastry is way out of my league). It's easy if you make roll it all in the crescent roll the night before, then freeze it so it's easy (not falling apart) to cut and throw it in the oven.  I put some bacon in it and one time, bacon works with everything. I am thinking some artichoke or more cheese would also add to the deliciousness. :)

The dough was hard to work with. I added more fresh garlic for flavour. I liked the fact that I could toss one roll in the freezer for another potluck a week later. They were well received.

These were well recieved by our guests but I agree with others that the dough could use a bit of spicing up. I will try these again using Parmesan cheese in the dough as suggested by another reviewer.

Made a double batch because I was having 60 for cocktails. Loved the make ahead idea, didn't mind doing the work (although it was a bit time consuming),got great reivews at the party, but have 1 major complaint. Recipe says ungreased cookie sheet and I had great difficulty getting them off the sheet without breaking them. Next time I will lightly spray it so hopefully they won't stick.

This recipe tasted great and was a huge hit at my party.  While making the filling mixture I also added about 1/2 cup of shredded swiss cheese and it seemed to hold it together nicely and add some flavor. I also chopped my mushrooms in the food processor so the pieces were very small. I had enough dough and filling to make 3 rolls, so I'm not sure if I made them the right size, but they still looked good to me. Everything was great except for when I was trying to cut it after I had chilled/frozen the rolls, it tended to tear and stuck to the plate.  I think that with some extra flour on the plate or rolling them in saran wrap while they chilled/froze and using extra care while cutting would solve these problems though. Overall great taste, beautiful presentation, and a good recipe. I will definitely be making this for my next party.

This recipe is time consuming but well worth trying.  The flavor is excellent and a great appitizer for weddings.

I changed the dries spices for fresh because they grow in my garden.  Also I put fresh garlic minced in the recipe plus on zest on lemon and fresh lemon jucie.

Either way this recipe is well worth trying.  I would suggest doing it in advance and freezing as suggested due to the lenght of time it takes to make.

Bravo for the recipe.

Made this recipe for a holiday cocktail party and it was a hit, even with mushroom-haters. It was a little time consuming, but I think it was totally worth it. I followed the recipe exactly; the only changes I made were to increase the spices and add black pepper. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a full tsp of salt in the dough, fresh garlic and fresh spinach in the filling and I used corn starch in place of the flour in the filling as well... I wasn't a huge fan of the dough though, it wasn't bad but I don't think id make it again... it seemed like this recipe was missing something. I think doubling the cheese and maybe adding some crumbled bacon in the filling would make it better.

These were ok. I served them at a party and the people who ate them said that they tasted good, but they were literally falling apart when I took them off of the cookie sheet. I am not sure if it was because I made them ahead of time and then froze the loaf for a few weeks, thawed it and baked them the day of my party. They were crumbling as I cut them prior to baking, too. Taste ok but really not worth the effort.

Easy to freeze the slices and they work great as a last minute appetizer.  I found a mix of white button and crimini (baby portabella) worked nicely.

Delish!  I threw in some minced garlic and a little garlic powder and they were perfect.  Used premade pie crust from the fridge section to save on time.  Froze them a few days before the party still in 'log form' let the logs thaw a little for an hour or so before cutting and they were perfect.  Huge hit at my party.

These are really good. I seasoned the mushroom/spinach mix with a couple of spice blends. I will definitely make these again, but maybe add a few more mushrooms to make a little more filling.

The dough is bland and the amount of it rolled into the pinwheel makes for a dry bland appetizer.  However the filling is great. Previous suggestions about rolling dough thinner may help but could make it too delicate to slice? Will use the filling with fillo or puff pastry dough in the future. Parchment paper is a must so the egg wash doesnt glue it to your pan.

These were really popular at my party.  I really liked the pastry part of these, however I'm only giving it 4 stars because I felt the filling was a bit dry.

I added extra parmesan cheese and a little bit of mozzeralla.  These were very, very good.

These were tasty and pretty to serve.  They seemed to take forever to make though, so I definitely recommend that you make a bunch and freeze them.  I have done that already, and they taste the same once defrosted and baked.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  A bit of work since there are so many steps, but each step goes quickly. I added some crushed red pepper to the mushroom and spinach mixture since some other reviewers said it needed something else.  All in all, a delicious, convenient (since you can make ahead) recipe.

Tasty! These were a big hit. 

Changes were: 

- Used crescent roll dough
- Added chopped roasted red pepper, and steamed asparagus to the rolls
- Added a tablespoon of flour to thicken up the filling. 
- Only 1/2 pkg of cream cheese, and some shredded romano/ parmesan, mixed mushrooms
- Used the food processor to chop & blend all ingredients together

I have made these using this recipe every Thanksgiving since 2013. They are always the first thing to disappear. I do add a bit (about a 1/4 cup, but I eyeball it) of Parmesan cheese to the dough mixture as recommended by another reviewer now, but I never had any complaints about them being bland before I did that. I just think they do still taste a bit better with cheese in the dough.

Raves from all who sampled.  I baked on parchment paper and that didn't work out so well.  I'll follow instructions next time and use an ungreased baking sheet or muffin pan.

Timing consuming, but delicious!  Everyone loved them, even the non-mushroom-lovers.

This is ok.  I am definately not a picky eater or much of a food critic usually...However...for the amount of prep time that goes into this it needs more flavor.  It's great that it can be frozen and then pulled out...use your own judgement and add some flavor and the recipe will become 5 star!

Loved them. You might want to cut back on the spices,but otherwise a great treat.
