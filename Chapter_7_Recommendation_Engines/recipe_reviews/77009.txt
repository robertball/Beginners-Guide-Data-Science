This is a simple tasty recipe.  I modified mine by peeling the onions, it was delicious, but not flavorful enough.  Next  I cut the onions in half, then thirds, so they were in large pieces.  I then poured on some oil and salt and tossed. Baked them on the baking sheet middle rack twenty or so minutes-absolutly delicious.  Serve plain as a rich treat-very flavorful.  (You can add other spices also) or use as topping for cous cous, quinoa,rice, etc.

Absolute favorite onion recipe. Skipped vinegar completely. TIP: after placing cut side down cut off small portion of end facing up, allows oil to catch on the onion.

We love onions prepared this way. Also, we sometimes grill them and also we have wrapped them in foil to roast. Many times, we go ahead and slice the onions, add the oil and seasonings and wrap in foil. When our steaks are done, wallah!, each person has their own packet of delicious onions to top their steak!

YOU HAVE TO PEEL THESE! The skin is borderline inedible. Basically, you chop the onion in half, chop off the tip, drizzle with EVOO and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cut a slit in the top and wedge in a 1/4-1/2 clove (piece) of garlic. Roast like 25-30 mins, and they're GREAT! Kind of bland, in the sense you'd want to serve them with steak or mushrooms or something in addition to it.

I love roasted onions. I just peel, quarter and throw them and lots of peeled garlic (yum!) in a roasting pan coated with olive oil spray for 20 minutes, spread out a bit, add some frozen spinach, brussels sprouts and cook for another 15 minutes. um um um ... goooood! I weigh it out in 6 oz portions and I can eat this with my meals for 4 or 5 days.

A nice addition to Christmas dinner. If you're choosing to drizzle with balsamic vinegar, use it sparingly!

Excellent onions! I was generous with the salt and pepper too. This went great with the sirloin patties I made.

Made this for my baked onion loving husband and needless to say, he devoured it. Even my daughter Ashley stole some from her dad and she's normally not a big fan. Thank you!

I used this recipe to make the roasted onion for a creole succotash. The onion turned out great. I did what several other reviewers did...peel the onion before roasting and cut it into more than just two pieces (8). Will be adding this to my repertoire.

So easy & so delicious! Based on previous reviews, I tried cutting it 2 different ways: first in half then I cut the 2nd half in thirds. Both had nice presentation and taste. I baked it with salmon on the same baking sheet, so I had to lower the temp to 200C (instead of 220C) for a longer time. I also peeled the onion before baking, so that I could eat it right away. Next time I'll try the option balsamic vinegar. Yum.

These are delicious, I will never fry onions again! I cut the large white onions into quarters, placed on one cut side then flipped over half way thru since I had two sides cut. Yummy. My hubby and I devoured them along with cold Chinese pork and Hasselback taters. Can't wait to make for guests. (I skipped balsamic vinegar)

Really good and really easy.  I cut the onions up into fourths instead of halves.  Next time, I am going to make sure I do peel them and cut off the end bits.

Super awesome. I checked the level of "doneness" by touching them. They needed about 8 mor minutes than the recipe called for. Be sure to test them before taking them out. They want be very good if they're not cooked enough. The bottom sides caramelized beautifully. I even forgot the balsamic and everyone loved them. Yum!!

These were so good!!!  I peeled the onions and topped each half with a small pat of butter.  They came out browned and sweet and luscious.  Served with roasted chicken and rice pilaf---gorgeous!  Thanks!

I took the earlier advice of a sage cook and inserted parts of a garlic clove into each onion half - also inverted them so oil would wick up  - and the result was both a beautifully roasted onion with great infused garlic taste! Ideal when paired with a grass-fed filet and a great glass of Pinot Noir.  Excellent!

This was pretty good.
I used smaller onions and peeled them.  I used the full 30 minutes cooking time, but the onions didn't quite brown. Regardless they were very tender and nice with a little dash of red wine vinegar. It was a very easy and very cheap 30 minute midnight snack so I'll probably do it again.

So easy.  If you are onion lovers like we are these are a great and attractive side dish. Made them twice already.  Nummy.

Nice and straightforward recipe.  The onions turned out very mellow and could easily be eaten straight.  This is more of a side dish than a way to get potent onions to use a topping on something.  I cooked them for 30 minutes.

I really enjoyed the wow factor for so little effort. I used the bouillon cubes as recommended by others. I also peeled them.

I made per recipe and they taste fine, but I just wasn't wowed. I'd say if you're looking for something to do with an onion, try this because what I feel "eh" about may wow someone else.

I was hoping the onions would be sweeter.  They were okay but I probably won't make them again.  They did nicely complement a very sweet yam casserole.  If someone had the time, they would be great to make almost as a garnish.
