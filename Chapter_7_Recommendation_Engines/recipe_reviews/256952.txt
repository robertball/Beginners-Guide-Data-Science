I added some chopped up red bell pepper for sweetness..came out great! I also used a small carton of egg whites rather than separating 12 egg yolks. Will be great for an on-the-go snack!

I think this is a great recipe and you can do all kinds of variations.  For instance, I go to Weight Watchers and I use spinach, cherry tomatoes cut in half, and the egg whites.  These are so tasty and they have no points.  You can add red bell pepper, and next time I intend to saute some of the red pepper and onions to the cups.  Put in whatever you would like:  bacon bits, turkey sausage, artichokes - there is no end to the good things you can add to this recipe.

Wouldn't go thru the trouble of separating 12 egg yokes again, but the recipe did give me an idea.  These were dry and could have used a few more of the yokes or mayo to moisten them up.

Made as written and these were good. I don't think the parm was necessary but that is just my opinion.

I made this but substituted mushrooms, peppers, and green onion for the spinach.  Very good.

Excellent!  I didnâ€™t have hot sauce, so I added 2 small pinches of red pepper flakes. Next time I might reduce the salt just a tiny bit.

Cooked spinach is hard to handle for us, even though we enjoy raw spinach. We added black olives to try and mask the taste but maybe a more tangy vegetable or olive would have worked better.
