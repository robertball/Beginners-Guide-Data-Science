I used Malibu coconut rum and Fresca soda. Very powerful drink but tasty. I think that this is good but would have been better had I used part flavored juice in place of some of the soda.......like maybe pineapple juice?

This one didn't work for me. Even though I reduced the vodka to one shot it still has a very strong almost medicinal alcohol taste. We don't have "fruit flavored rum" so I used rum w/a shot of cherry juice and it's still super strong. CHEERS John Keock!
