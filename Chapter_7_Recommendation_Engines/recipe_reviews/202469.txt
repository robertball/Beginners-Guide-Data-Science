Great and easy recipe. I added fresh carrots from our garden (as shown in the picture) and a whole onion cut in long slices. I also added white pepper which gave it a little more bit and I used wok oil instead of the vegetable oil. It was delicious! We served it with crispy noodles.

This was great! I made it the same way as the recipe except I added a few more ingredients. Like others I included carrots, onion, and celery into what was already there, about a half a cup of each for one serving. When making the mixture I put in a little oyster sauce. I found that rounded out the flavor a bit. I also added salt and pepper to the chicken before cooking. To finish I used sesame seed oil instead of vegetable. The sesame flavor was enough with the oil that I felt I didn't need the sesame seeds. Very good, I will be making it again soon!

This was just like the chinese food that I love to get at the restaurants. The only thing I would do is to double the sauce because its so good!

Great easy recipe with plenty of flavor.  I would probably add a few more veggies next time; maybe some broccoli, carrots and red pepper.  I bet this would be good with shrimp as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Something was missing. I just couldn't put my finger on it. But it did satisfy my craving for chinese. Plus its super healthy. I made mine with broccoli and carrots. I also cut the ginger in half as it is a very strong spice for my tastebuds. I will make it again but with a few tweeks.

I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the chicken broth. Next time will use low sodium soy sauce, it was a little too salty for us. Also used sesame oil instead of canola, added carrots, and left out sesame seeds. Easy, healthy, delicious recipe!

Totally underwhelmed.  I added onions (how can you not have onions?) and green pepper.  Found it to be very bland.  It needs something to perk up the flavour - lemon or lime juice, maybe?  Not sure.  Disappointed in it.

I thought this was good, but way too much ginger. Was I the only one?  I used one teaspoon.  Doubled the garlic.

Great Recipe and simple.... we had a bumper crop of snow peas so I've been looking for recipes so we can use them up.  This one is quite tasty.

This recipe is great. I've been looking for some authentic dishes and this was exactly what I was looking for. It tastes incredible and the flavors are very subtle, but definitely there. However, if you're more into the bolder flavors you may want to think about using more sauce.

Try stir-frying some almonds or peanuts with garlic and ginger, and adding all of it to this recipe.

This wasn't at all what I was expecting.  The chicken and snow peas at the local Chinese takeout place has more of a white sauce.  The ginger was very overpowering to me.  I added other veggies like onions and sliced carrots but I followed the sauce directions exactly.  If you really like ginger, this one's for you.

Really enjoyed this. VERY nice sauce - simple but very nice flavor. Estimated cooking times were really helpful for me - someone who hasn't done much stir-fry. I did cut the ginger to 1 tsp because I'm not a big fan of ginger. Added onion, broccoli, carrot. Will be making this on a regular basis with many variations for sure!

I found the sauce to be rather bland.  If I make this again I would definitely double the ginger and soy sauce ratio to the chicken broth.  Also, using vegetable oil leaves another opportunity to add flavors ignored.  I would use sesame oil to cook the chicken.

I made it with shrimp instead of chicken and it turned out GREAT!  My husband is a fan of chicken but really liked the flavor even with shrimp.

Good basic recipe - missing rice wine for sure. I added about 1 Tbsp and that rounded it out. I may add a cpl tsp oyster sauce next time too. O/w it was pretty good. I also added carrots and celery cut on the bias along with white onion.

This recipe couldn't have been easier. I had to change a few things since I didn't have water chestnuts or mushrooms. I added 2 sliced carrots and I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Topped with green onions and sesame seeds.   Came out delicious.

Delicious ~ used broccoli, snow peas, water chestnuts, shredded carrots; and sauteed chicken in oil with garlic and onions, and a little red pepper.  Broth didn't thicken up much; may have added to much liquid, or sesame oil...Served over brown rice.  Will do again!

I did not make any changes.. I hate when people do lol.. When I read reviews, I want to know if the recipe in front of me is good or not. I don't care to hear changes, additions or subtractions. Sorry. That being said.. This recipe was easy, delicious and I will absolutely make it again. Thanks for posting ??

I would definitely make this again. I modified it a lot, so my rating is basically for the sauce recipe. I cubed chicken and cooked according to recipe, but used freezer bags of stir-fry veggies for the rest. I steamed them in the microwave per directions while cooking the chicken, then added them when I added the sauce. Quick and tasty!

Terrible. Tastes nasty and looks nothing like the picture. Has way too much ginger, and soy sauce turns everything brown, which both make the "white" sauce unpalatable. Definitely not a four-star recipe. Requires significant modification or avoidance.

This was a great recipe & was very close to what I would order in a restaurant.  I made a few changes: used actual ginger root (peeled & zested), added a sliced scallion (green part only) with the water chestnuts, & added bean sprouts with the snow peas.

Easy recipe but need more zing. I doubled the garlic and added sesame oil.

Too much ginger.  It overpowered the sauce.

First off, I used FRESH ginger, NOT the DRY, since it is for the sauce. I keep a lot of fresh ginger on hand, so it just seemed right, and I am thinking some of you might of used the dry instead?
I also use peanut oil or add some peanut butter to regular vegetable oil, to give a more authentic taste.
Yes, I liked the idea of adding carrots for a snap of color to contrast with the pea pods...  looked great on the plates! I served it over basmati rice one time and once with lomein noodles.. quick, easy, somewhat authentic and easy on the points!

It's quick and easy and pretty good for you.  Changes, none if I want to change something  I'll do it at the last minute to my liking.  I get a kick out of how some folks make so many changes.

Tasty and easy. Cut the amount of ginger in half and added a pinch of chinese 5 spicy for a little more flavor. Also added carrots and broccoli and used snap peas instead of snow peas.

We love this dish!  Simple and tasty!  We skip the mushrooms and use only one chicken breast but that's due to personal preference.

I fixed this as the recipe called for except I had no mushrooms but added carrots and broccoli.  They were a good addition.  I thought about cutting the ginger but didn't and am glad.  The ginger was the main flavor for the sauce.  I didn't add salt because of the soy sauce (coco aminos for me) and had to salt at the table.  We liked it and I would make it again but maybe add onion and celery with the carrots and broccoli next time.

This was really flavorful. It was a little salty but I'm not sure why.  I love veggies so next time will add more.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Only change I made was to add some red pepper flakes to give it a bit more zip.  This is a keeper!

It was way too salty for our taste.  I would try it again without the soy sauce and ginger to give it more of a rich chicken taste.

After reading the other recipes, I cut down to 1 teaspoon of ginger which I thought was plenty. I also added carrots which added nice color to the dish. I also used the suggestion of sesame seed oil to stir fry the chicken.  I liked that flavor, it added a little more depth.  Next time I would maybe even double the amount of garlic.  Cooking this dish made the house smell great.  Thanks for the basic recipe and others with their suggestions!

Hubbie and I both loved it. Healthy and delicious. Omitted the water chestnuts.
