Fixed these for Christmas Brunch. Very good and very easy to do. I used the individual tart dishes, as oppossed to the muffin tins. Had everything cut up the day before, when I got up Christmas Morning, but them all together and put them in the refrigerator,until everybody got here. They were baking while we opened presents and were done by the time we got finished. The crusts were easy to do too. Try this some time they were very easy and good tasting.

I made this recipe last night for my daughter (11) and I.  It was quick and didnt taste too bad, but it was very bland.  I probably wont make it again.

Delicious. I used a spicy homemade sausage, red onions, added a  bit of garlic, some salt and pepper and spinach to this. Nice tasty breakfast. The only thing I would have liked would have been if the crust was a bit firmer. I am going to try blind baking the crust  and then adding everything else in next time

Delish.  I have done this using Ritz Crackers as a crust before, but the crackers always dissolved into the eggs.  This is a great recipe with a nice crust.  I added chives.

Awesome, a definite crowd pleaser.  I did substitute cumbled bacon instead of sausage..everyone raved and wanted more! I wonder how difficult it would be do make them in mini muffin tins!  Thanks for your recipe.

I have made this recipe for several brunches and it is always a hit! I suggested the recipe to a friend who doesn't like to cook but needed something for an breakfast meeting. She also found it easy enough. Everyone at the meeting love it, too.  The egg tarts are great to make ahead and re-heat. Thanks!

This was very good. Made it for a Mothers Day Brunch and everyone liked it. I used cheddar cheese (since that is what I had ) and put the cheese onto the crust before adding the egg, so it mixed in a bit more. I had a little problem with the amounts ( since I doubled the recipe) but it was easy to add an additional egg and milk so there was enough filling. I will make this again.

Just OK considering all the fat and cholesterol these must have.  I would probably cut out some of the fat using half as much butter and skim milk.  Needs a kick of garlic or cayenne pepper too.

Excellent breakfast. Huge hit at a breakfast pot luck. Fresh basil goes well with these.

I modified this recipe to use gluten-free baking mix to build the base for this tartlet.  Everyone loved it - for the holiday party at work, and the family get-together.

If you want to add a little kick to this, substitute spicy sausage for a crowd that likes it hot and/or serve it with hot sauce. My father in-law and I always use the hot sauce, even with the spicy sausage
