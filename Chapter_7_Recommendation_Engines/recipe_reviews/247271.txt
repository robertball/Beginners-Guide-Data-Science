No aluminum needed. I made just a few changes we are not potato people so I used parsnips and carrots only. Doubled up on the garlic and rosemary and cooked to 170. Have saved to my favorites and will make again.

Made the recipe as stated. The roast had a good favor but the vegetables would have been mushy in the last step. When i took the pork out the veggies were done. I used sweet potatoe and green asparagus as i could not find white. I will make this again but keep an eye on the veggies. Thanks for the recipe. #allrecipesallstarscanada #facelessnomore
