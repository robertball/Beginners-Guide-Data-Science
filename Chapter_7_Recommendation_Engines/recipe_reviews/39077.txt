I love this recipe!  I actually add a layer of dark chocolate on the bottom.  This is my method...melt the semi-sweet or dark chocolate morsels and spread it on the prepared baking sheet and pop it into the freezer.  While that is freezing I then melt the white chocolate and the small candy pieces.  I then spread it over the dark chocolate and put it back into the freezer.  Break into pieces and store in container or serve.

On my first try the white morsels did not melt, but turned into hard clumps that had to be thrown away.  I e-mailed Nestle for advice.  I was told high wattage microwave should be set at only 50% and that 1-2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil added prior to melting will result in smoother, creamier melting.  I added the oil and melted the chips in a double boiler for my second batch and it turned out great.  Very smooth and easy to spread.

The best stuff!  Added a layer of semi sweet chocolate underneath, & about 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract to the white chocolate.  Make sure your semi sweet layer is really cold & work quickly spreading the white chocolate, or the dark chocolate will start to melt & you'll have streaks in your white!

Last Christmas I went into Williams and Sonoma and saw that they had a peppermint bark for sale. It tasted yummy but it was kind of pricey.......so I went looking for a recipe and found this one! I suggest you use more peppermint candies than are called for -- it will make it taste more like peppermint. This makes a great Christmas present -- put it in a pretty tin and wrap it with a ribbon!

I should also add that I used chocolate squares and melted them over a double boiler instead of in the microwave. I find I have more control of the product that way.

Enjoy.

This is a very simple and fabulous gift to make for friends.  I have to say though that through trial and error it works best with "Bark" rather than morsals.  I use it in layers like...I do chocolate bark and let it cool and then the next layer I use with white bark and then crush the peppermint into the white while still warm.  I also add a little bit of peppermint extract to the bark during the heating process to add more peppermint flavor.  Works GREAT!  It never lasts long when I make this!  Good luck and give it a try!

This is my son's favorite holiday treat!  I use half a bag of white chocolate and half a bag of semi-sweet, melted them in separate bowls and first pour the white chocolate down, then the dark on top.  Then just take knife and cross-cross through the mixture making it "marbled" to your liking (but not too much or it will look muddy).  I find that easier than making the two layers.  I also added some peppermint extract to the chocolate layer and it is FABULOUS!!

Tried it with both Nestle White Choc. morsels and white chocolate from the craft store--the Nestle morsels were a little less sweet and worked better in this recipe.

So easy to make & absolutely delicious! Everyone asked for the recipe. Instead of 24 peppermint candies, I used 6 red, white, and green striped candy canes. I found that crushing them very finely makes it taste more pepperminty; some recipes call for peppermint oil, but this doesn't need it. I did push bigger pieces into the top. You may want to make a double batch if taking to a party.

I attempted to make my second batch (1st was perfect) of Peppermint Bark and ran into the same trouble another person had with the white chocolate starting to crumble because I didn't remember to turn the heat lower while melting in a double boiler. This caused the chocolate to dry out faster. So rather then throw it away, I made snowballs and rolled them into the finer crushed peppermint. Then placed them in the freezer about 15 minutes. They were a hit and told to make them again. So don't throw away over heated chocolate. Make SNOWBALLS! TIP: You need to pour melted chocolate as soon as it creams and remove from heat!!! Don't keep it on the heat, as this causes the drying out effect.

I took mini candy canes and made hearts out of two of them.  I made about a dozen hearts on wax paper on a cookie sheet, and then spooned the mixture inside the heart.  Then I let it harden and I had peppermint bark hearts!

This is one of the quickest Christmas treats I've made! I made one batch with Eagle Brand Candy Coating and one batch with Toll House Vanilla Chips--  The Eagle Brand was the easiest to melt, and was like velvet to spread on a baking sheet. The toll-house morsels got really dry in the microwave melting process and was harder to work with. I added a tablespoon of peppermint extract, and I'm glad that I did. It tastes great! Personally, the Eagle Brand chocolate looks the prettiest, and tastes the best. I'm going to melt some milk chocolate chips and drizzled it over the bark-- This will make great Christmas gifts. By the way, my cuisinart worked great for breaking up the peppermint! Much faster-- I realized this after the plastic bag started to break up with my hammering. Why work so hard?

I make this bark every Christmas; it is delicious! I also add a layer of dark chocolate to the bottom, but I add 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract to that layer. It tastes wonderful, and looks beautiful, just like the expensive stuff you find in magazines!

I made this today, turned out really great. Easy to make.  I agree, I should have used peppermint extract in the white chocolate, tho.  Also, when layering with dark chocolate, don't cool the dark layer too much, the white won't stick to it.  I learned that the hard way.  That's why they call it 'practice'. Yummy!

Just made this and turned out wonderfully.  I used white chocolate chips and added 2 tsp. peppermint oil as well as vegetable oil to keep the chocolate smooth.  I crushed 12 candy canes and added to the top and then drizzled melted semi sweet chocolate chips over top.  Looks and tastes great!!

A lot simpler than I thought. This was my first time melting chocolate and I used a nonstick omlette pan over med-low heat and a rubber spatula. Very easy. I didn't have wax paper so I used a layer of saran wrap over a cookie sheet. Worked fine. A layer of plain semi-sweet chocolate on bottom, then the layer of white chocolate mixed with the candy cane dust, then pressed the larger pieces on top. After setting, the layers did come apart when you took a bite, so next time I'll use the pieces of candy as "rebar" between the layers and see if that helps.

Super Easy! I used mini candy canes and crushed them while the chocolate was melting.I used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips. I sifted the crushed candy as the recipe stated and the put the rest of the larger pieces on top. I will use this every year now!! You can not possibly mess this one up!!!

Great & easy recipe.  My husband is not much of a peppermint/white chocolate lover but he really liked this.  I would suggest crushing the peppermint first thing before melting any chocolate.

Great recipe, but I'm giving it 4 stars because for 5, you really need to add that layer of semisweet chocolate under the white chocolate.  Here's a tip: Crush some of the bark after it's done and sprinkle it on top of a pan of brownies before baking. Makes the most delicious brownies!

I used Meijer brand vanilla bark and this melted very smoothly.  I tried to crush the regular sized red, white, and green candy canes but gave up on that idea because they were too hard to crush and the inside of them was a funny gray-purple color instead of green.  I decided to crush the little red and white candy canes instead and this worked great.  I used an 8 oz box of these candy canes and 10 oz of vanilla bark.  I crushed the candy canes pretty fine and sprinkled them on top of the bark immediately after melting.  Next time I would add a tsp. of peppermint extract to make it a bolder peppermint taste.  The candy looks really pretty!

Delicious! I love peppermint bark so much, I was ready to buy it from William Sonoma, but the high price tag made me think again. I found this recipe and it is great. A few changes - a melt the chocolate over a double boiler (I just put my small pot inside my bigger one - nothing fancy). I melted chocolate first, spread the layer on parchment paper, then popped that in the freezer while I went on to the white. I melted the white *added one tsp of peppermint extract. Other than that, no changes. For as easy (and cheap) as this was to make, I've made it several times for neighbors as holiday gifts. It's so pretty when done! You must try!!!

This recipe is worth it!  Better than the original one i tried (and paid megabucks for) at a famous coffee house chain.  Instead of using the peppermint candies i used candy canes and instead of microwaving or double boiling the chocolate to melt it, i simply boiled a pot of water and added each bag of chips into its own ziploc baggie, when completely melted, i snipped off the corner and used it as a squeeze bag!  Very easy clean up!  The kids loved smashing the candy canes so it was a fun, easy, fast resulting dessert!  Served mine with coffee after dinner.  A hit!

These were GREAT! So easy and they make a beautiful gift. I followed some of the others and used the chocolate on the bottom put it in the frig for about 5 min. then added the white chocolate on top. I also used almond bark (I just like the flavor and consistency better)  added 1 tablespoon of peppermint extract to the melted white chocolate and ground up the candy canes into a fine sugar. They ended up with a beautiful shimmer like it had just snowed! One more thing... if you are having trouble with the chocolate and vanilla separating when you break it apart just let it warm up a few minutes and it will stay together fine.

This is a Holiday tradition in my house.  It's extremely easy and delicios, but I do it a bit differently.  I use equal parts milk or dark chocolate (which ever you perfer) melt that and lay it on waxed cookie sheet.  Set in freezer while melting white chocolate.  To the white I add peppermint oil/extract. then lay it on top of the hardened darker chocolate and sprinkle with the peppermint candy pieces.  Refridgerate for about 25-30 mins and you're ready to go.

I thought this recipe was super easy.  I would suggest crushing the candy first, then melting the chocolate.  My chocolate cooled by the time I had finished crushing.  Also, if you want it to be more colorful, get those rainbow candy canes and crush those instead.  I also melted some chocolate, spooned it into a decorating bag, and drissled the chocolate all over the top.

I was excited to try to this recipe after all of the great reviews.  However, I found that you have to be careful not to heat the white morsels more than what the recipe says (I heated mine for an additional 30 seconds, and it started to clump and thicken).  I also found it a bit difficult to spread the melted morsels.  I will have to try this recipe again before handing it out as a gift.

Delicious and addictive!  I couldn't find the mint candies so I used 6 regular sized candy canes to one bag of white chocolate chips.  So yummy!

This is an AMAZING recipe! So easy and delicious! Following another reviewer's advice, I melted 12 ounces of semisweet chocolate and spread that out first. Popped it in the freezer while melting the white chocolate and it turned out great. I made four batches in three days! Definetly add 1-2 tablespoons of veggie oil, makes the chocolate melt much smoother. And don't forget to put the candy cane DUST in the white chocolate!

Here and I thought I had dreamed this up all by myself! I always make peanut bark with peanuts and milk chocolate morsels so when I got a bag of the white morsels at the little store where I work, I thought, "Peppermint would go good with this!" So I bought some soft peppermint sticks and crushed them up and added them to the nuke-melted white morsels, stirred them a bit and turned it out onto a big piece of parchment paper on a cookie sheet, spread it thin and put into the fridge for a little while and broke it up into managable pieces.  Fam and co-workers loved it over Christmas!

Simple, fast and delicious.  I followed some of the other reviews and added a layer of semi-sweet chocolate and then put the white chocolate on top.  It's been a hit this year with family and friends.

Very yummy, but then I love white chocolate.  This is very simple to make.  Next time I don’t think I’d strain the tiny pieces of peppermint into the chocolate.  That gave it sort of a grainy appearance.  I used non-stick aluminum foil instead of waxed paper, which worked well.

This worked out very well. I made white chocolate with wintergreen pieces, and semisweet chocolate with peppermint pieces. The semisweet is softer at the end product; it's just more fragile, but not terribly so. It'll still hold up for giving away in tins. 

I used the double boiler and a tbsp of corn oil for melting mine. I spread it out on wax paper because I don't relish the idea of peeling candy off a cookie sheet. Also, if you put it on wax paper, you can break it up without touching it (a plus for me since I don't want to give gifts with my fingerprints all over them!) A note to anyone who tries semisweet chocolate; you'll need lots more candy for flavoring than you need with the white chocolate, or else your mint will be drowned out. I used 10 candy canes; I'll use 20 next time.

VERY easy and VERY yummy!  I added a few drops of green food coloring to give it a holiday twist.  Just be sure to quickly spread it out onto wax paper - mine started to harden up pretty quickly.

very good.  Made twice this Christmas and forgot the waxed paper yesterday.  Now I need to melt it again, it would not let go from my cookie sheet and when it did it is shaving pieces.

Came out great! I also added a layer of dark chocolate to the bottom. I melted the dark chocolate, let it cool in the fridge, then put the white chocolate mixed with the candies on top. Yum! Easy and delicious!

So yummy and so easy!  I also added a bottom layer of semi-sweet chocolate, it really amped up the presentation.  The peppermint 'dust' that ends up flavoring the white chocolate is just perfect.

I followed the suggestion to make a chocolate layer below the white layer and stirred in 1/4 tsp of pure mint extract to each layer. Also, the suggestion to melt chocolate in a double boiler made for easier spreading. White chocolate has a different consistency so adding 1-2 tbs of oil really helped.

I Love this recipe.   I make it every year for Christmas.  This year I purchase a package of white candy quick.  Followed the package instructions on melting in the tray.  I finely crushed 40 mini candy canes leaving a few little chunks mixed in the tray and poured out on wax paper.  Super simple... Super Tasty

Used my food processor to chop up candy canes (pulse).  My only complaint is that I wish I would have made them a little thicker.  I tried to spread the entire batter out over the baking sheet.

My 6 yr. old daughter and I just made this today and it is great.  I did both milk chocolate and white chocolate (both were chips).  I added peppermint extract to both chocolates.  My daughter had fun breaking the candy canes with her hammer.  We will do this again next year.

This is so good.  Also, I made this with my granddaughter, who has a rather short attention span, but it was fast enough and easy enough for her to enjoy helping.  I also added some peppermint extract to the chocolate and added white chocolate chips with the candy canes to make it double layered.  I would suggest making the layers very thin, it is easier to break.  Very pretty.  I will make this again!

I wanted a dark chocolate layer on the bottom, so I melted milk chocolate chips and spread them in the pan first, then put it in the freezer for about 15 min before adding the white chocolate layer. The layers stayed together perfectly and the final bark got rave reviews! If I had known it was so easy to make such yummy peppermint bark I would have been adding it to my holiday baking tradition years ago!

This recipe is a good starting point. I made the following modifications and it came out INCREDIBLE!

-First melt one package of semi-sweet chocolate chips over a double boiler.
-Stir 10 candy canes crushed in a food processor in (avoids the white chocolate turning pink)
-Chill in fridge 10-15 min.
-Melt one package of white chocolate chips over double boiler
-Stir in 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract.
-Pour over chilled bark
-Press in candy cane chunks from 2 candy canes.
-Chill an hour before cutting

This recipe was really good. I was so excited because I am a classic burn the white-chocolate in the microwave woman. So, I used a double boiler. I simply put a metal bowl on top of a pot of water and turned on the stove. I used half white chocolate chips and half dove white chocolate bars because that's what I had on hand. Dove is really good chocolate (for what I can get, I live in Asia) and next time I think I'll use all dove. I also had about 2 tablespoons of crisco, but it melted so well that next time I will use less. I used 5 candy canes (2 for the top and the other 3 mixed in) because I didn't have the normal peppermints and used a 9 x 13 pan (the recipe didn't specify). I'll definitely use this again.

For those of you who like peppermint bark but don't like the very hard candy, try using Candy Cane Hershey kisses in place of the peppermint candies. They are also white chocolate so they won't ruin the flavor and they are VERY pepperminty!

Very good! giving it 4 stars because I have to agree with a lot of other people the layer of chocolate bark on the bottom adds a lot to it. My first batch I had troubles with the white bark not wanting to stick to the chocolate. The second time I made it I did not let the chocolate layer chill as long and it was still soft when I put the white bark ontop. That worked a lot better!

I made a TON of this this Christmas.  First, I used both white and milk chocolate almond bark.  I pulverized the heck out of the starlight mints, no big chunks.  And i also added some peppermint flavoring.  It makes the chocolate peppermint bark taste WONDERFUL!  I also had some fun "marbling" the two together for a pretty effect.  Everyone loved it!!!

Great Recipe. This is the second year I have made it and given as Christmas gifts. I use a food processor to make quick work of crushing the candies.

Fabulous.  Sooo tasty and soooo easy.  Thumbs up.  I made this twice -- once exactly as written and once with an added dash of peppermint extract.  It was great both ways but next time I make it I'll add that dash of peppermint again.  I like the added hint of mint a bit better.

Made these today! Very simple I added 1 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract as I made a bunch. I used candy canes instead. Keeper!

Sure, using actual almond bark instead of the white chocolate morsels is more sophisticated and "professional", but this way sure is easy and makes you look like the Christmas candy hero. I saved myself some grief and used candy canes, they were pretty easy to crush (using a rubber mallet).

I usually use 2-3 bags of white chocolate chips and crushed candy canes so I can make more at one time.  Everyone always loves this.

Wonderful and easy.  My batch made just before New Year's was economical because I used 1/2 price candy canes. This one is going to be added to my yearly holiday favorites.

GREAT!!!!I made this last night with my 3 and 10 year old.  It was so easy and good.   I took some to work and I have been asked by everyone for the recipe.  The only problem I had was that my 10 yr old wouldn't give up the crushing (pounding) duties.  I have to make another batch so my 3 yr old can crush the candy.

I made this recipe multiple times last year with both white chocolate morsels and almond bark and both tasted  good. I also added 1 T of oil to make it creamy and 1/2 tsp of mint extract for extra flavor.

Holiday Peppermint Bark Haiku: "Easy gift to give. (If you don't eat it all first.) Tasty, and festive!" Not much else to say about this super-easy recipe, other than it tastes wonderful, requires minimal effort, and is fun to wrap up and hand out as quick gifts to teachers, co-workers, neighbors etc ... I made this bark, along w/ chocolate/cranberry/walnut, and dark chocolate/pistachio/sea salt barks to dole out this season, and everybody so far seems to approve!

Flavors are really good for anyone with a sweet tooth. I break the pieces very small and use this for an ice cream topping around the holidays. I have not had much luck adding a layer of chocolate. Every time I try, the two layers, white and chocolate, separate when I break the slab apart.

Followed it to the "T".  I used 2 packages (24 oz.) and used 12 candy canes and 12 peppermints.  Added 2 tsp. of canola oil to only make the chocolate more smoother.  This bark literally was devoured within 10 minutes.  So easy to make and very delicious.  If you used the candy canes, it takes forever to unwrap them.

The first time I made it it worked perfectly and then my kids and husband ate it all before Christmas, so I made some more, but when I went to break it up all the normal chocolate separated from the white chocolate and it didn't look great.  I didn't know what happened, so I was nervous to make it again because I didn't know how to keep it from happening again.

I find using a double-boiler easier, because it slowly melts and no chef should use a microwave, ever. You also won't burn it in the double-boiler. I crush up red/white candycanes because the colors make it really beautiful. Once the chocolate is melted, mix the two quickly and spread evenly onto a sheet, and throw it in the fridge!

I did as some other suggested and added a dark chocolate layer. At the store I found dark chocolate and mint chips in the same bag and used those. Amazing!

I've been making this for years now, and it HAS to be he easiest thing I make at Christmas.  My husbands demands it now ;)  Sometimes I'll melt milk chocolate chips first and let them set up and then the white chocolate over that.

If you use the microwave to melt the chocolate, keep a close eye on it! It is done when some of the pieces still hold their shape but are nonetheless gooey, so don't over-nuke them! Stir it frequently to check on it. (If you find it drying out, try adding butter to smooth it out!)  I usually use candy canes, which I put in the food processor on pulse. This easily creats some of that fine dust that others say to reserve for the top for a nice sheen. The best candy to use for this, though, are the semi-soft sort of peppermint sticks, but just put them in a plastic bag and beat them with a rolling pin, as they are a little trickier to work with, but they melt in your mouth!   After you let the mixture cool, slam the bark on the counter, and use a real sharp knife to drive the tip into bigger pieces in order to further break them up. This tip is really useful if you make big batches like I do that can result in rather thick pieces.  The original recipe here is pretty basic, so you can jazz it up however you like. I give this recipe four stars because it did not mention any peppermint oil, which adds a lovely extra hint of flavor to it that is simply a must, in my opinion.

I think this is missing something without the chocolate layer on the bottom, so I started with that.  I had a hard time getting my white chocolate to stick to the chocolate layer, though.  Still very tasty, but not the presentation I had hoped for.

Simple, easy, tasty, and looks as though it is difficult to make.  Great for entertaining.  I would partition or at least indent the chocolate before it cools, because if not, it tends to break unevenly & is difficult to make presentable and uniform.

great recipe. I chopped candy canes in my food processor. Did the layer of dark chocolate let that set up then added the white chocolate + 1tsp mint extract, peppermint pieces & then swirled slightly with a butter knive.

I made this with some changes.  I used Giardelli semi-sweet chocolate morsels as the first layer then white chocolate as the second layer and mixed in Andes peppermint crunch baking chips.  Then sprinkled more andes baking chips on the top instead of candy canes.  Very good!
I have been keeping them in the fridge in a sealed container. My family and friends love them.

Have made this for church and library fund raising bake sales for a couple of years.  Always sells well.  This year I used Chocolate Peppermint candy canes, turned out festive looking  and delicious.

I did as many other reviewers suggested and used a layer of semi-sweet chocolate underneath the white chocolate.  I also added a teaspoon of peppermint extract to the white chocolate.  This was hugely popular with my husband and friends.  I don't know how it is since I don't like mint, but they all raved about it.

Easy and good. I use half white chocolate (must use GOOD baking quality white--not standard grocery-store morsels) and half chocolate chips, then top with crushed candy canes. Friends love this stuff.

This turned out very nicely, but I added some peppermint extract to boost the flavor.  Kids loved it. I tried to make this with a layer of dark chocolate on the bottom, but the layers kept splitting apart (same problem others have had). I think next time I'll use soft peppermint candy just to make the process a little easier.

Pretty and simple to make. Used white bark and small candy canes mashed with a meat tenderizer. Also added some peppermint oil for added flavor. Drizzed with some melted chocolate. Nice to give as a gift. I have also dipped pretzel rods in the melted white bark, then sprinkled broken peppermints on top and drizzle with the dark chocolate.

Very good. But I put in peppermint extract like previous reviews stated, and I don't think I should have done that. It gave it too strong of a peppermint taste and made the bark smell too much like alcohol. Next time, I'm just using chocolate and candy.

It is really easy to make, and looks quite beautiful, but I think it could use a little more peppermint flavor.  Maybe because I used candy canes?

I make this recipe every year to bring to my peeps at the office.  I work in a pretty hoity-toity area and they're all used to the Williams Sonoma variety which costs over $20 a pound.  I can literally whip this together the night before and drop it in a tin I buy on clearance after the holidays the year before and BOOM!  Gifts for all for pennies a serving!  This should be a solid go-to recipe for a bulk holiday gift.  So easy.  So classy.

This is really good and so easy to make. If you follow the recipe as directed it will have plenty of peppermint flavor. I think adding peppermint extract as some reviewers mentioned would be too much. I used my food process to crush the peppermint candies, it gave me the perfect amount of peppermint dust and just enough chunks for the top. I'm not a huge peppermint fan but I will definitely be making this again.

This is the easiest recipe ever! I decided to use spearmints instead of peppermints and it is so delicious! I microwaved for 1 min. at 70% and then 30 sec. at 70% twice and it was perfect. We added some green food coloring and topped with red sprinkles. So much fun!

I like the ease of this recipe, but the end result hardly even has a hint of peppermint taste.  I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract to the melted mixture & it tasted much more like real peppermint bark!

People seem to think this is so hard to make. It's so easy! I used this as gifts this year.

I doubled the recipe to make a whole 11x17 cookie sheet, other wise one recipe fills half that pan. I used milk chocolate chips as a bottom layered. Wasn't minty enough for my taste so added 1 tsp. peppermint extract to the melted white chocolate chips.  Instead of using waxed paper, I used a light coating of shortening.  I also used 12 peppermint candycanes.  Taste great!!!

This was a great recipe. I did add the 1 tblsp oil as suggested, and it turned out very smooth. When I crushed up the candy canes. I removed any big pieces and only mixed in the fine crushed stuff. I then topped the spread with the bigger pieces. Everyone loved it... It is a must make again recipe. Thanks to whomever shared this recipe.

I personally don't care for peppermint bark but it was a hit at the family get-together. I added a layer of dark chocolate on the bottom.Great presentation and looks like much more work than it really is.Thank you for the recipe.

This was a hit. I layered milk chocolate ontop of the white. I also used those old fashioned peppermint sticks...you know the ones that are slightly soft and not hard like a candy cane. Much better.

Great recipe! To add to the presentation of this recipe I also used mini candy canes and shaped two of them as hearts and filled the middle with the bark. The candy canes along with a tiny amount of peppermint extract give the peppermint bark that extra special look and taste

Easy easy easy!!! I used almond bark instead of morsels. I microwaved the entire package on high for about 3 minutes, stirring every 20-30 seconds then added the peppermint pieces. I spread it on my big baking sheet and then refrigerated it. Awesome!!

Super easy, super yummy,. Microwave melting of chocolate is always risky, the extra few minutes using double boiler method is well worth it! Improvise one from 2 pans if you don't have a traditional double boiler. Tip: soft candy canes are to die for on their own....but are much more tender than using the starlite mints.

My husband and I really love this! Also made it with the dark chocolate layer.  Bark wouldn't "break" very well, though, so I think I'll need to make the next batch a little thinner.  The white and dark also separate a little so will try the suggestion of letting the dark layer only cool slightly before adding the white. Thanks for the great holiday recipe! UPDATE 12/9: Made this again and swirled the dark and white chocolate together as suggested by another reviewer.  Worked really well, looked pretty, and the layers stayed together! Any suggestions on how to keep the milk chocolate from drying out?  LOVE this recipe!!!

Made this several times over the holidays--it got rave reviews!  I melted the chocolate using a double boiler rather than the microwave and added a bit of oil to the white chocolate to help it melt.  I also added peppermint extract to the white chocolate.  I put the cookie sheet into the freezer between chocolate layers.  Helped a lot!

I made a few batches to give away for holiday gifts.  I mixed in a lot of the sifted peppermint "dust" and only added very small pieces of peppermint so to avoid any chipped teeth :)  Everyone loved the peppermint bark!  Will definitely make again!

I make this every year. It's the most festive thing that I make for my Christmas tins. I've used white almond bark and white chips and I find that the almond bark gets a little bit harder. I also use candy canes, and put them in a blender or food processor and pulse a few times. Then I take the sort of candy cane "dust" out, and mix that directly into the chocolate. I take the larger pieces (not too large, we don't want to break teeth!) and sprinkle that over the top of the spread out chocolate. Perfect every time!

This was excellent.  I followed the advice of others and put a layer of semi sweet choc on the bottom.  I put it in the freezer while I melted the white chocolate.  I also added 1 tsp of peppermint extract to the white chocolate.  I did try to work fast, but still had a little streaking of the dark chocolate.  I then put the candy canes on top and put back in the freezer.  The only other problem I had was one spot of the dark chocolate, about the size of a piece of bread, that didn't harden on the bottom.  My husband didn't mind.  He had some to snack on off the parchment paper.  It was a little difficult to break up, but I used a knife to break it up.  Very good and I will make again.

Simple, delicious recipe. Made a bunch for Christmas. It is good with just the layer of white chocolate but it's also very good with a layer of semisweet on the bottom. I don't like the look of it when you add enough crushed candy to make it taste really minty so I would definitely add peppermint extract to the chocolate. Even if you are only doing the layer of white, the extract makes it really taste like peppermint.

Very good and easy with the microwaving instructions.  I gave it 4 stars because there is no real peppermint flavor unless you add peppermint extract.  I used 2 tsp.  I also tried the dark chocolate layer on the bottom, but the white separated from the dark when I broke it apart.  Any tips to keep it together?

I made this for the first time tonight and it was incredibly easy and turned out very tasty. I followed the recipe with no modifications. After reading over some of the other reviews, I may try adding some peppermint extract to the white chocolate next time, and I'll probably crush the candy a bit more, as mine has lots of larger pieces. I may even try the semi-sweet chocolate layer that others have recommended. However, I am very satisfied with how my first batch turned out, and I love how easy the preparation was. I'm sure it'll be a bit hit at my work holiday party this week!

This is easy and delicious.  Like others, I did a layer of dark chocolate first, refrigerated it, then repeated with white chocolate.  White chocolate morsels don't melt as well.   When I spread the melted white on it started to melt the dark, so make sure the bottom layer is cold or it will smudge.   I used a double boiler.  Also, I used crushed candy canes rather that individual candies.  That way I didn't have to unwrap so many.  The bark is very yummy and looks pretty, but it melts in your hand so make bite-sized pieces.

I used a 20 oz. package of vanilla almond bark and a 7.5 oz. bag of the Star Brites peppermints, which I crushed pretty fine -- the biggest pieces being about 1/8".  This made for lots of peppermint flavor and a nice texture.  And the reviewer who called this ADDICTIVE wasn't kidding!  It's delicious!

A super easy treat to prepare and bring for any occasion around the holidays. Also a great gift item. I prefer to use the mini candy canes as they are easier to break up vs. the candies or larger candy canes.

I love the flavors of white chocolate and peppermint together, thank you for this one!  I used candy canes, in a baggy and used a hammer to crush them.  I had a hard time with adding the second layer of chocolate over the top, perhaps would be easier just to mix it all together in the bowl and then spread it in the pan.  Thanks again.

I really like this recipe. So do all the people I give it to as gifts.  I have tried to add the chocolate layer on the bottom, but I too, have had problems with it not sticking to the white.  I also have a variation to this recipe.  I take candy canes and put them in my coffee grinder.  You can grind the candy canes really well but still have chunks to decorate the top layer.  I also add red and green sprinkles to the  melted white chocolate  after spreading it in the pan. It makes it very festive!

My family loved this!!! I used the semi-sweet chocolate morsels underneath and I added the tsp. of peppermint flavoring. I am not a peppermint fan, but this was awesome. You might want to put the first chocolate layer in the refrigerator so that it hardens properly (for at least 1/2 an hour).Enjoy!!

This recipe could not be any easier w/ the end product looking like something that took much longer to prepare. I also added peppermint oil based on previous reviews. I used nestle and ghirardelli morsels and did not have a problem w/ dryness or spreadability because of the microwave. Perhaps people are using too high a temperature to melt the chocolate. I reduced the power to medium and the chocolate was perfect. Thanks for this family-friendly, easy and delicious recipe.

This is such an EASY recipe and it has been a hit at all my holiday parties.  I have also used spearmint, and it is actually preferred over the peppermint.

This was a very easy, very quick recipe to make. It looks great & tastes great. Is a good gift for holiday giving and parties. Try it! (Next time I make it, I'm going to melt, spread and harden a bag of chocolate morsels for a bottom layer.)

Very good! I added a layer of semisweet chocolate underneath the white chocolate layer..  Tip:  don't add vegetable oil to the milk chocolate layer. It doesn't set very well.  I froze the milk chocolate, then melted the white chocolate and spread it on top, but I didn't press the candy in enough so when I broke it up all of the candy fell off.  Next time I will probably let the milk chocolate layer set at room temp, then do the white chocolate layer so the white chocolate doesn't set so fast.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I prepared it exactly as said.  My biggest complaint is that the peppermints were very hard to crush.  I still rate it 5 stars because it is very tasty and really simple once you get past the peppermint crushing.  I made a second batch with semi-sweet chocolate drizzle and green sprinkles.  It looks VERY pretty.

I added a touch of peppermint extract.  I also used dark chocolate which I froze before spreading on the melted white chocolate.  I had a bit of trouble with the consistency of the Ghiradelli's white chocolate so I added a touch of canola oil.

I had a problem with the chocolate being too soft and crumbling apart. Maybe next time I will use almond bark w/ chocolate chips melted in. I used green & red candy canes instead of peppermints.

I gave this recipe 4 *s because while I wasn't especially "wowed" by the end product, everyone who ate them in my presence seemed to really enjoy it and was terribly impressed that I had made it myself. I should add that I'm not a big white chocolate fan so that may have contributed to my lack of enthusiasm. 

The recipe was super easy to make and would adapt well to many modifications (e.g. top with crushed oreos, dried fruit & nuts, etc.) As for this version, I might try adding a splash of peppermint extract to the melted chocolate next time to boost the mint flavor and make it more refreshing. I thought the mint flavor in this version was too subtle.

Also, I had a heck of a time crushing the candies (they actually put dents into my wood rolling pin). I think candy canes would be much easier to crush than candies. I found that using a nut cracker to break up the candies was far more effective than trying to pound them to bits.

This is by far the easiest candy recipe I have ever used. And the flavor is wonderful! I used white chocolate chunks (what I had on hand) and it turned out better than I ever expected. My husband loves it! Thanks!

Fun and easy, I packaged them up for gifts! The only suggestion I make is to put the tray in the fridge for a couple hours. The chocolate will harden quicker that way...

Okay, I took the average of my stupidity (3 stars) and the recipe (5 stars) and came up with 4 stars. I'm sure the recipe is great, but somehow I messed it up. I tried the layer of chocolate morsels with a layer of white morsels on top and I guess I didn't let the chocolate layer harden long enough because when I put the white layer on, the chocolate underneath melted. I do agree with using a double boiler to melt the morsels, though.  It turns out very smooth that way.  In addition, burned my hand with the steam from my homemade double boiler! Guess I'll wait til next year to try it again. :)

Sounds easy enough but my chocolate started to solidify before I could get it all melted so I put it back in the microwave again quick. Big mistake. Burnt chocolate smell wafting through the apartment. Going back to a double boiler. Wtf was I thinking that I could microwave chocolate.

Having just made this, I have a big tip for you: Get the crushed candies ready BEFORE you melt the morsels! The crushing and straining takes longer than you might think, and you don't want to have to melt the chocolate all over again. Additionally, candy canes crush pretty easily -- more easily than I suspect round candies do. I used Reynolds Wrap nonstick foil instead of wax paper and it worked very well. Absolutely no changes to the ingredients, it tastes wonderful, and it's pretty easy to make.

Honestly, I wasn't sure how this was going to taste. I couldn't imagine white chocolate and peppermint tasting good together, but figured I'd try it because of the amount of positive reviews. I AM SO GLAD I DID! This stuff is delicious!

Incredibly easy, that's for sure.  I had green candy morsels left over from a trip to Michael's, and bf asked me to make peppermint bark with them.  He got candycanes that were on sale following Christmas, and I used about 9-10 of them instead of peppermint candies.  I used his ninja blender thingie to crush the candy, and it worked really well.  Bf said this was exactly what he was thinking of.  Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this four stars, because I made some changes.  In stead of wax paper (I didn't have any), I used tin foil, us the wax paper, save yourself the headache. I used dark ch. for a base layer, then the white and the crushed candy canes.  I also put mine into our chest freezer to harden up faster.  My mother even liked it.  Easy to make and take to any party.  Thanks!!

Just made these over the holidays. Loved them. I changed it a bit however, took the suggestion of melting chocolate (dark) first, than the white with some peppermint extract. I crushed up some candy canes over the top. Will be in my rotation for the holidays from now on.

This was so yummy, EASY, & a great addition to my holiday goodie bags.  It screams Christmas.  Will definitely make again.  ( I did use white chocolate baking bars instead of white chocolate chips)

Yum!  I doubled the recipe and made a few modifications.  I heated the white chocolate using a (homemade) double boiler technique (one saucepan inside another saucepan).  I still had some trouble getting the chocolate really creamy so I did end up adding about a tablespoon or two of canola oil toward the end.  Also, my strainer was too small and the sticky candy pieces were going everywhere except into the strainer, so I just dumped all the peppermint pieces in and mixed the whole thing on the stove.  Spread it on parchment paper and put it into the fridge.  It sets up really hard!  I had a rough time trying to break it up but it came out delicious.  Great simple recipe!

Excellent taste.   I did the version that one reviewer recommended, with the milk chocolate as the bottom layer.  The only problem I had was that both layers seem to melt easily.

I just made this and the finished product tastes great but I had a few problems getting it to work. I decided to use both dark and white chocolate and melted them in a double boiler. The dark layer went fine I was able to smooth it out and put it in the freezer. I let that sit for 15 mins while I melted the white chocolate...when I started adding the white chocolate layer I tried to move fast but the dark chocolate still melted and made the white chocolate look like a brown mess...and the white chocolate set so quickly I didn't even have time to spread it all around let alone press the peppermint candies into it. I melted a little more white chocolate to fill up the holes but I still didn't have candies on top. So in a desperate attempt to make this work I put the whole pan in a cold oven and preheated it to 300F - I checked on it every 30 seconds or so to see if it was melting..before my oven even got preheated it was melted enough that I could press the candies in. End result was really good - very tasty, the layers didn't want to separate the candies didn't fall off. I'm sure it would be easier just doing one layer of chocolate but it tastes way better with two. Not sure what to do different next time to avoid the problems.

This stuff is so good!!!  My husband who doesn't care too much for peppermints even likes this and asked me to make it again this year.  The only thing about this recipe I don't like is it takes forever to break down the candies.  Next year maybe I'll try candy canes and see if they are any easier to pound out.

Just made this today & it is VERY good.  When melting the chocolate, I cooked it in 15 second intervals all the way through at 1/2 power.  The chocolate melted beautifully and was very smooth.  The only thing I'd do differently is double the recipe to make more if you're going to be giving it out as gifts or bringing to a gathering since it didn't make very much.

I also added a chocolate base layer. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet and it worked really well.  I didn't realize that white chocolate is much harder to melt into a smooth consistency- I had to add oil and it was still kind of clumpy, but it worked fine. Next time I will try the double boiler method to get better results.  If your white chocolate is a little thick like mine was, make sure you press the peppermint into the chocolate so when it hardens it stays in there well.  Lastly, next time I will use a bigger cookie sheet so the bark is thinner. I doubled the recipe and used a small cookie sheet. The bark was a little thick and hard to break.  Can't wait to make these again!

This is really good, especially with about a tsp of peppermint extract, but I only gave it four becuase of how hard it was to break up without the candy cane pieces going all over my kichen floor.

Excellent!  There is no way you can make mistakes with something this easy!  In addition to the white peppermint bark, we also made milk chocolate bark with dried cranberries.  There are so many variations!  Thanks for an easy, kid friendly recipe!

This recipe is so easy and yet very delicious!  Why pay for the expensive stuff when you can make it at home for about $3.50?  I melted the white chocolate in a double broiler and it was very smooth that way.  Crushing the candies proved to be rather difficult at first, but I finally got the hand of it.

This is a very good recipe. It tastes much like those Hershey's white chocolate/peppermint kisses! Very easy to make. I added a bit of peppermint extract to the chocolate and I didn't melt the chips in the microwave but in a double boiler. Worked great! I did try the first batch with dark chocolate on the bottom and it worked out okay but I think I like just the plain white chocolate better. I also sprinkled some candy cane "dust" in with the white chocolate after it was melted but before I put in the pan and it makes it look very nice.

This was very easy. I made 1/2 the amount to see how I would like it. I decided to crush up the peppermint much finer and just mix it all before I poured it. I did not care for it as much with big chunks.

good start. but starting with a dark chocolate bottom layer is especially yummy. also, i would melt the chocolate in a double boiler method. put the chocolate in a glass bowl and place over a pot of boiling water. make sure the bowl is large enough to fit on top. this will melt the chocolate evenly and not burn it. stir continuously until melted, about 5 minutes.

Instead of using the hard candies, I use Bob's brand of old fashioned peppermint candies...they are softer and melt in your mouth.

This was very addictive!  I put the white layer down first, and then while it was still warm, spread a dark layer on top.  It sticks better if you don't chill the white layer first.  Then I added the bigger bits of candy cane that didn't get turned to powder on top of the dark layer.  I really like the look of it that way better.  Also consider using 'almond bark' in place of the white chocolate.  Cheaper and less fattening!

This was a great new addition to our annual holiday baking. I melted a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and put them down first, then placed in refrig, and topped with melted white chocolate with the mints in them. Came out great!

Very easy recipe.  I also tried melting the chocolate in the microwave, and it burned.  Using a stove-top pan to melt the chocolate makes it much easier.  The taste was fantastic...a real holiday treat in our home.

The flavor of this was excellent and had I performed the melting of the chocolate more accurately, it would have been great. However, I had issues with melting the chocolate (did it in the microwave and it became VERY dry - then added some water, BIG mistake and it didn't set). So, I screwed up the recipe, but had I not - the flavor was very good and just what I would look for in peppermint bark.

Hubby doesn't like peppermint candy by itself, but mixed in with the white chocolate, he couldn't get enough.  Very yummy.

This was very simple and very tasty. I used the white almond bark instead of the morsels and it worked perfectly. The color makes a nice addition to holiday baskets!

I'm going to have to give this one a three.  While I followed the directions exactly, the white chocolate morsels did not melt well at all, pretty much just stayed in a lump, making spreading it extremely difficult.  Also, making the recipe as is, you couldn't really taste the peppermint very much.  If I ever decided to attempt it again, I'd try it with a different form of white chocolate and add peppermint extract for more flavor.

Tried this recipe as someone before did, with semi-sweet chocolate layer.  I froze that layer for about 15 min., then tried to continue the receipe.  The white chocolate started to get too cold and would not spread well, and then I couldn't stick the candy cane pieces on top!  Had to soften it in the oven and re-press the candy in.  I used 9 oz. of candy canes and thought it was too much.  I think I'd try it again, without the 2nd layer.  Maybe just use plain chocolate instead of white?  I gave 4 stars because it does taste good, and it was my fault it didn't turn out as well, because I changed the recipe.

Delicious and super, super easy.  I melted my white chocolate chips in a double boiler and crushed the candy canes in a ziplock bag with a hammer.  I like bigger chunks in the candy, so I poured all the candy canes into the melted chocolate.  I also refrigerated it to speed up the process so I could eat it more quickly!  Everyone at work loves it too.

Great concept but using the Nestle's white chips gave it an odd flavor. I mean, I know in my head what this should taste like and this wasn't it. Next time I'll use a premium brand or vanilla almond bark and see what happens.

I had never worked with Nestle's white "chocolate" before. Just assumed it was similar to their dark chocolate morsels. But you know what happens when you assume, right? ... I've never had any trouble melting the chocolate morsels, but when I tried to melt these things, they just turned into a glutinous mass.

tastes great. I  put the chocolate in the freezer  and then put the white chocolate  on top and put in freezer. this was a  mistake the white and dark didn't stick together,  so I put it in the oven arty 350  for  for mins and they finally combined. best to not use the freezer to cool down otherwise great.

Added green food coloring and mint extract for a regular mint flavor. FABULOUS.  
The white chocolate clumped so I dropped small pieces on top of brown chocolate layer  and 'swirled'. It came out great. When you bite into it you might find a beautiful green section. Addictive!

I love peppermint bark, and this recipe is so easy!  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added a teaspoon of peppermint extract to the melted chocolate.  Yum x 2!  Also, I didn't have much experience melting chocolate in the microwave, so I took it slow.  Reduce the micro power setting to 50% and keep an eye on it, stirring every 30-60 seconds. First time, and it melted beautifully.

Fun! My daughter and I followed the advice of others to do a two-layer bark. We put semi-sweet chocolate on the bottom and then used green mint chips for the top layer. She had fun destroying five candy canes with a hammer. :) Thanks for sharing!!

The flavor was really nice, however, after attempting the semi-sweet chocolate bottom layer, I am wondering if there is some trick to getting the white chocolate layer to stick? My layers separated after I cut and stored the pieces. What did I do wrong??

This is most certainly a hit amongst all for the holidays! A hint on using Nestle ... avoid a hint of water during the melting process ... this is what I have found to cause it to harden quickly! I melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second increments stirring in between until melted ... so be careful to ensure the spoon is dry when stirring! I have struggled to keep the chocolate layer stuck to the white chocolate layer, so I am going to try a few suggestions others have made ... candy making tonight!

This recipe is so easy even my 5yr. old can make it!  We have so much fun making x-mas candy together for our family, and this is very easy and fast.  This recipe is a keeper!  Note that if you use the microwave stir chips every 30 sec. on high.  I also added a 1/2teas. of shortening to the chips as i was melting them.  Put wax paper on a cookie sheet and lightly sprayed pam cooking spray on the wax paper before pouring the mixture on it. Came out very pretty.  It went very fast!! GREAT RECIPE!!

It turned out like I expected :) I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate myself, so I think next time I might add a little regular chocolate.

I tried it mixing all the peppermints with the chocolate instead of leting the little pieces go in first and it worked out great.

i loved this recipe! although i found it easier to put the candies into the blender & pulse it for a bit. i melted my morsels over low heat on the stove but who knows it might be the same as microwaving it. It makes wonderful christmas presents! I whipped up a batch & then i broke it up & layed it on wax paper in a box then taped the lid down ( :

Super-excellent, just what I wanted. I used a double-boiler as I was afraid of making my chocolate dry or waxy, and I didn't add any decorative pieces to the top as I like very finely crushed peppermint, and I used about a teaspoon of mint extract per bag of chips. The candy canes were pretty hard to crush, they kept shredding through even my toughest ziplock bags, I ended up putting the broken down pieces in a clean dishcloth and going to town with a soup can. Worked out pretty well, and no powder leaked out noticeably.

I messed up by not heating the chips to the correct consistency and had to deal with a gloppy mess. I placed wax paper over the goo and pressed/rolled it flat into the pan.  After the bark hardened, I pulled off the wax paper, and it turned out beautiful and delicious--despite my goofs.  So, make sure you cook the chips to the right consistency or you will have the same troubles I did.

I don't know why the recipe calls for using a strainer to shake small pieces into the mixture.  For it to go through my strainer, it would have to be near dust--which is what I did.  Stirring it in created a disgusting, lightly chunky pink mixture which resembled throw-up.  It does look a little better after hardening.  Of course it tastes ok, but I couldn't give it out with the rest of my baked goodies looking like that!  :(

This was AWESOME! I made sure to use premium chocolate chips so that the chocolate was nice and smooth. I added a layer of milk chocolate to the bottom and I sifted the candy cane powder into the white chocolate. LOVE IT! Thanks for sharing!!

Yum! I added a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips for the first layer, put that in the freezer untill hard. Next I added the melted white chocolate chips and about a tsp. of peppermint extract. Put the peppermints on top. I didn't wait for it to cool at room temperature. It hardened in the freezer for about 10 minutes and it was ready to eat! Great for gifts!!!!

i wish i had just followed the recipe instead of taking the advice to completely change it. I tried doing a double boil on it, and the chocolate never smoothed and I burned myself to high heaven with the steam. Put it in the microwave and it destroyed the chocolate at that point. I had to throw the whole shebang away. I may try this again, but I'll follow the simple instructions next time.

Made this for a cookie exchange for our neighborhood and turned out great! I used white almond bark and chopped the peppermint candy canes in the mixer. Wonderful presentation and very easy to make. Make sure to use a low heat when melting the chocolate and stir frequently.

My sister loves this stuff.  My grandparents used to buy this for us when we were younger and now they have passed away and we can no longer find it to buy for our children.  I found this recipe and we (though my sister loves this stuff much more than I do) have it every Christmas!

I thought this was pretty good. I would have liked a less sweet white chip. You can't really eat more than a piece or two. We had it on a cookie tray with other goodies on the front counter in our store and no one would touch it, although it looked fine. I might try it with a dark chocolate bottom next time.

Easy to make and great color addition for a holiday plate of cookies/candy.  Next time I'll use red and green instead of just red so there's even more Christmas color.

So easy!  I was worried, because I couldn't find the white chips so I bought a white candy bar that came in its own microwavable tray used for dipping fruit, pretzels, etc. that was 16 oz. then I chopped up some candy canes (only had 8 oz.) and stirred the entire amount into the melted chocolate and spread on wax paper.  Turned out really good even though I didn't have the correct amt. of ingredients! I'm going to deliver my cookie trays to the neighbors tonight and the bark really adds color!  Next time, I will reserve a few pieces of candy as the recipe instructed to create an even brighter red color on top.

This was so GOOOOOD!!! I made this last night for a dinner that I was hosting to see if they liked it and I would have a new recipe for Christmas. I think everyone asked me for the recipe. I used candy canes and crushed them with a meat hammer. I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of peppermint extract to the chocolate mixture. It gave it a much better mint flavor. Wonderful...I can't say enough! I will be making this alot more and it is so easy! Thats the best part!

Delicous and easy to make. I melted my chips in a double boiler that way I could stir the chips the entire time.  Might try a more expensive brand of white chocolate next time.Might give it more of an expensive candy store taste.  I also melted a handful of milk chocolate chips and swirled it into the mix. Looks pretty.  Also you can put this in the fridge for about 10 minutes and it is ready to eat more quickly.  Great holiday recipe and easy easy!!!

I added 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil. It helped tremendously with the consistency of the white chocolate. Very Yummy!

Wonderful recipe!  I crushed candy canes first and set them aside, then melted the chocolate chips at 50% power in the microwave with oil - worked great.  Everyone raved about this.  Thank you.

Super easy and a nice twist on the traditional peppermint bark recipe.
