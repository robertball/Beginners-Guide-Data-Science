I replaced white sugar with date sugar, and I used apple sauce instead of oil. It's a dense cake. 3 and 5 year olds ate it without complaining about it, so it gets a 5 star!

This cake really has potential. As-is though, I did have some problems with it. First off, the batter was really really dry--and I ended up adding approximately 1/2 cup of coffee to get it to the correct consistency. Second, I think this could stand to be baked in a larger pan for less time. The cake domed a lot, and the dome ended up being almost burnt while the center of the cake was still under-done after baking 55 minutes. Lastly, the flavor needs tweaking for our taste. Not enough cocoa flavor. With all this being said, I would definitely make this again with the following changes: use melted butter in place of oil, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 tsps vanilla, and only 2 cups of whole wheat flour. Keep the other ingredients the same. Put it into a 9x13 and start checking for doneness after about 20-25 minutes. I think these changes would make this cake even better. Thanks for the recipe!
