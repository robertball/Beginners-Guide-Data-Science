I changed the recipe a little bit by using butter instead of shortening and had great results. These cookies are delicious. They are a little messy though what with all the peanut butter and chocolate but definetly worth it.

I was very surprised by these cookies. Initially I was looking for a chocolate/peanut butter fix using a recipe that didn't call for white sugar. I came across this and I've been delighted. Now to be honest it's definitely not chocolatly enough maybe some chocolate chips would make it awesome for all of you chocolate fans but otherwise the cookies were delicious. The are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I put them in for the whole 10 minutes and they came out perfect. My husband loves them too!

I tried these to get kids to eat peanutbutter cookies -- I thought they'd be more interested if they at least looked like chocolate cookies. I won't make them again -- you just can't get enough chocolate flavor into them. Just make regular peanutbutter cookies or add choc chips if you really want the chocolate flavor. This recipe doesn't work at all.

I am not a fan of chocolate chips but my family is so I thought we could compromise by trying this recipe. Pretty good and the family seemed to like them. Nice blend of chocolate and PB and VERY EASY to make. Good alternative to the other chocolate-like cookies. Thanks Steve.

I liked the texture of the cookie. I am like some of the other though. Next time I would add some chocolate chips and nuts. I added some extra sugar and sprinkled some on top. They would probably be great with some nice hot chocolate.

Very good. Could have used a bit more peanut butter and sugar for extra sweetness but still just as yummy with a cold glass of milk.

These are a great combo of chocolate and peanut butter! The consistency was just like regular peanut butter cookies(not at all dry) and the color and taste is definitely chocolate. They turned out great--left over dough kept well in the refrigerator/ and freezer until later time! Not really sweet so we added a couple of chocolate chips on top while they were cooling....but next time I will use the peanut butter chips to top them off! This also gives those with peanut allergies a "heads up" re: ingredients.

Mmmm...these are so good warm from the oven. I added a little over a 1/4 C. extra sugar and 3/4 C. chocolate chips and they are delicious!!

While I did like this cookie it wasn't quite what I had hoped it would have been. Wasn't peanut buttery enough (for me)and a little dry.

Flavor was great, but I think I'll use less milk, as they turned out a little cakey.
