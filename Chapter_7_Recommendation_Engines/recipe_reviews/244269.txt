I made this and it really tastes great.  It wasn't as spicy as I thought it was going to be, but still very good.   You can always add more of whatever spices you have a taste for.

We usually buy the store hummus but I decided to make it instead for a treat for my boyfriend Sunday afternoon. I even made the tahini paste from scratch (recipe in AllRecipes). He absolutely LOVED it (I don't do the spicy stuff) and ate a whole weeks worth in one day that by the time I got home he already ate it. So I took a photo of the remnants. :-) he stated it has a better texture, as in its not smooth like the store kind, and tastes more fresh than the store bought.  I will definitely be making this again.

Oh yeah, this is awesome! I think cayenne are my favourite peppers so I admit, having followed the recipe to the letter, I ended up adding some more cayenne on top, but as is this is a five-star recipe. I added an extra Tbsp of olive oil because it seemed a bit dry but this is our preference. Also, next time, I will add a fresh cayenne in with the mix. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it and stopped at one tsp of cayenne.   No extra sauce.  I had pressure canned my own beans so I had a bit more and adjusted the rest to double.  We all loved it.  Those that wanted spicier just added it to their serving.  Definitely will make again!   Thank you for the perfect recipe!!

I made this using 1&1/2 cup chickpeas that I made in my instant pot and used the liquid that I saved instead of water increasing it to 3 tbsp as it is pretty thick. Also topped with roasted chickpeas, 1 tbsp olive oil and paprika. Added a little extra

This is my favorite hummus recipe already. I did think it needed more olive oil, but that's about it. Thank you for a very balanced recipe.

I love this base recipe - made it today for the first time. Next time I will decrease or eliminate the salt.  I used 1/4 habanero pepper, decreased cayenne to 1/2 tsp and decreased hot sauce to 3 shakes. I may add a little more lemon and/or chopped parsley. This is one recipe that will always be prepared a little differently in my household - we love variations, but this base is great!!

Super easy and super delicious. I'm going to make sure I always have a can of chickpeas in the house now, just in case.

Excellent as is. I like more spice so next time I'll grab a few cayenne and jalapeno peppers from the garden, but I'd also follow this recipe as is again!

The recipe itself is great and I would recommend anyone to try it out.

However, I got a little tip for the preperation that makes it much tastier:

Instead of pouring the tahini with the rest of the ingredient and mixing it seperatley in a food processor\blender, it is better to mix it in a bowl (as if you're making actual tahini), tasting the mixture, making sure it's ok and then pour it into the food processor.

Thumbs up on the recipe though. Incredibly delicious.
