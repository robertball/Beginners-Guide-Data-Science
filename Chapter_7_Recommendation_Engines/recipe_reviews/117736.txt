I am usually leary of making something with only one review for company, but I did. I was so good that even a guest that said he didn't like rhubarb said it was delicious. I doubled the recipe to use 9 x 13 pan. I had 8 cups of frozen rhubarb and used it all. It took 1 hr. and 20 min. to bake because of the thickness and the juice of the frozen fruit. So be patient with the baking part. You have to be sure that bottom crust is done. The crust takes like shortbread. I will definately make this again.

Thank you for the great recipe.  I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 1 hour 20 minutes.  It was very good- custardy and crunchy.  Perfect.  I am throwing away all my other rhubarb recipes!

Mmm-mm! I expected to like this or I wouldn't have made it in the first place, but I have to say this exceeded my expectations.  Fancy restaurants like to do old-fashioned, comfort food desserts (in addition to their Creme Brulee, Molten Lava Cake, Key Lime Pie, etc.) and trust me, you'd pay big bucks for this dessert in one of those restaurants and it wouldn't be half as good.  The crust is excellent - so buttery and delicious, but be careful when you serve this as it has a tendency to want to stay behind in the pan!  The filling is perfect -just right sweetness, creamy, and you'd never guess there was egg in it.  The topping was excellent. pretty and perfectly crumbly, such an ideal streusel topping that I've made a note of it to reference for ANY recipe where I want a streusel, be it cakes, pies, crisps or muffins. It was a challenge scaling this down to 3-servings for Hubs and me and finding just the right dish to put it in, but I obviously chose well because between the two of us we cleaned it up - we couldn't help going back for more!  Regrettably, I didn't make a half recipe, using an 8x8" dish for 6 servings, instead of scaling this to 3 servings - we could have enjoyed this a second time.

Even though I screwed up the recipe, it still turned out Great! I forgot to put the topping on for some reason before I put it in the oven, so about ten minutes before it was supposed to be done, i put on the topping and put the broiler on low for about 4-5 minutes. It was really yummy. I also used 4 cups of rhubard.

This has become my husband's favorite summertime dessert. I made it for several gatherings of friends and gave my copy of it away both times. He had a fit until I printed myself another copy and vowed not to give it away. I had an abundant strawberry crop last year and he suggested adding some to this recipe. I add 1-2 cups of strawberries with the rhubarb, fresh or frozen and do everything else the same. He asks for this dessert often and I think I could make it every week and he would not get tired of it.

Great rhubarb dessert.  The crunchy topping along with the tart center and cooky tasting crust are a great taste combination.  I doubled the recipe and used 8 cups of fresh rhubarb, as we like lots of rhubarb.  I baked it for 1 hr and 20 mins. till it was nice and golden on the top.  A must rhubarb dessert that I will bake again soon.

Fantastic rhubarb recipe. Loved the shortbread crust, I used 4 cups of rhubarb and baked it in a 9 X 11 pan.  Baked for 1 hour.  Rave reviews from all that tried it.

awesome, from a first time rhubarb user! I used 5 cups as well (need to work on my rhubarb judgment), and the second time 4 cups with a handful of frozen raspberries from last fall. baked for an hour. This goes over great!

This was super yummy and easy too. I used fresh rhubarb from the garden (about four cups) and cooked for about five minutes longer than stated. Thanks poster-I'll make this again.

I made this the other night because I didn't have enough rhubarb for a pie and was craving something sweet. My main complaint is that it wasn't a nice mixture of sweet and tart but instead the filling actually tasted "eggy" to me. If I make it again I would put more sugar in the filling, making it about 2 cups and then I would nix one of the eggs for the filling and use some butter and vanilla instead. For the crumble I used brown sugar and add a little oatmeal for texture, maybe even some crushed walnuts. Otherwise though, it was definitely a new way for me to use up my rhubarb:) Thanks!

Mmmm...this one's going into my regular rhubarb rotation.  I made it just as the recipe says, and wouldn't change a thing.  Hubs gave it two thumbs up, especially with a little spot of vanilla ice cream on the side!

This was declicious!  I think it is a lot like a rhubarb custard pie I like to bake, only easier to prepare.  I used about twice as much rhubarb and only about a cup of sugar in the filling as I like a tart taste; also used nutmeg in place of the cinnamon.  This is a keeper!

This is way too sweet for me.  I'll stick to rhubarb bred or rhubarb cake as they aren't as sweet.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, The layer of rhubarb was bareley detectable (I would use more), and was way too sweet, even though I cut back on the sugar.  I didn't like the egginess at all.  This was just not what I was expecting based on past reviews.  For the amount of time it takes and all the bowls that get used to assemble this, I wanted to love it.  I may try again with some modifications to give it a fair shake.

This was excellent, I added 4 cups of Rhubarb because I had it frozen in bags of 2 cups each.  Everything else was the same as the recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy! Cuts very nicely for serving.
I added a cup of sliced strawberries and reduced the filling sugar to 1 cup. I also added 1/4 cup of quick oats to the topping. I didn't use all of the topping & still there was plenty! Next time I think I will add another 1/2 cup of fruit. Don't overbake or the crust will get overbrowned.

This dessert was excellent.  I didn't change a thing.  It is sweet and tangy at the same time from the rhubarb.  Yum!

This was a huge hit.  I did add an extra 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and would increase the amount of rhubarb by 1/2 cup.  Aside from that, it was perfect and so easy.  Thanks for a keeper!

I used 4 cups of rhubarb. The bottom crust was a little hard to cut through, but it tasted so good! I did not add anything, but it would also be good with vanilla ice cream.

Exceptional!!! I grew up with rhubarb and so when I got a basket full from a friend I thought to try something new with some of it.  This was a superb choice.  It is crumbles a bit on servint so be gentle, but as with the other reviewers I fould the shortbread style crust to be the over the top fabulous touch to this recipe.  Next time I will add a bit more rhubarb, as the result was a bit sweet for me but SO SO SO good.  A lovely rich treat with coffee and ice cream.

Next time I'll do as reviewers suggest, either keep recipe and use a smaller pan (8X8) or double the fruit for the larger pan.  Delicious.

Very good warm with icecream! I doubled the recipe and added five cups of rhubarb, one cup of rasberries and one cup of strawberries. (all fresh) I cooked it for one hour and fifteen minutes. Also added some pecans to the topping. Delicious. I woud decrease the crust and topping by about a third next time though. It was a little too thick I think. All and all a great recipe that I will make again.
