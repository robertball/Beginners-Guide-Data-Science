What's not to love??  Add some bacon, and this dish begs to be eaten.  I could barely sit the 4 hours it cooked without stealing tastes every now and then!

My wife and kids RAVED about this dish! I also added 6 cooked chopped bacon slices and it was out of this world. I am making it again today ( double batch )  for a family picnic. A great unique flavor. Thanks for the keeper Jan!

Very good recipe. Made some adjustments due to what I had on hand. Used 2 16oz. cans of pinto beans and 1 8oz. bag of dried red beans and rice that normally simmers on stove top for 25-30 min. also used 1/4 to 1/3c. of leftover sauce from Barbecue Chicken Recipe instead of bottled barbecue sauce. Also added 4c. of water to the mix to compensate for the dried rice and beans. And cooked on high in a Crockpot for 4 hrs. Thanks for the great idea.

Easy and cheap to make and a big hit at potlucks. The only altering I do is add some chopped bacon and some garlic, but I put garlic in EVERYthing.

I used 2 lbs of ground beef because my husband loves things extra meaty, we have made this numerous times using different beans from the pantry each time.  My picky 13 yo daughter loves it also!  We serve it with tortilla chips or cornbread

Love this recipe!  I don't add the brown sugar or ketchup, we like extra bbq sauce!  Sometimes I add turkey sausage as well to make it even meatier.  So good by itself, over noodles or rice or with chips!

YUMMY! It tastes goooooood. The flavor was sweet and hearty (hence the dish's name). Everyone is the house liked it. My boyfriend immediately decided that this was the dish to take to parties. Very good. First dish I've loved from this site without having to alter the recipe.

I personally did not get to taste this after I made it.  My picky neighbor's son ate it all (that says a lot!!).  My daughter.....she ate it but said she did not like it.  I think she really did and was just eager for dessert.  All in all, it was a good recipe because everyone actually ate it!!! (very hard to come by in this family).

Definitely needs bacon and perhaps some liquid hickory smoke.  I added some Hickory Bacon Salt to my dish after it had cooked and that toned down the sweetness and gave it a nice smoke flavor.

This has been a family favorite for decades.  We don't include BBQ sauce or Worcerstershire, and we also add chopped, cooked bacon, mustard, white vinegar, kidney beans, and sometimes corn. Another nice variation is 1 bottle chili sauce instead of ketchup.  I'll post the variation recipe called Calico Bean Bake.

This is a great recipe. Kids loved it & it works great for cook-out's/picnics. First thing my family decided was to put it on a hamburger bun as sloppy joes.

What a nice, easy Saturday night supper.  We really enjoyed this.  I made half the amount and used only baked beans.  I can see why other reviewers said to add bacon because I think that would have added an extra dimension to the dish and taken it over the top.  Very nice.
