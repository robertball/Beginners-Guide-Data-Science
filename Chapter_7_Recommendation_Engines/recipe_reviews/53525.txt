I've made this recipe with raspberries and it's delicious!  However, instead of discarding the fruit it can be used as a topping to vanilla ice cream!

My husband and I made blackberry and blueberry cordial for Christmas gifts last year with much success!  Part of the fun was going and shaking the jars for months which sounds strange, but it built up quite a bit of anticipation and also, it was nice that we could both be involved in a project... for some reason I can't get him excited about knitting or making candles, lol.  The only problem we had was that once  the cordials were bottled, no one believed that we had made them ourselves!  
    Because it's been a poor berry season here, I'm going to take the advice of one of the other reviewers and make this with plums this year.  Thank you for sharing not only a great recipe, but a fun project!

I made this last year using bing cherries. I pricked each cherry first to aid in releasing it's flavors & since I wasn't making this to be drank as a cordial, I decreased the sugar some. I use the cherry vodka in cherry limeades to make them more fun. ;o)

Since sealing means different things to different people.  Please explain the process.  Is it a hot water bath seal? And for how long?  I have imagined that 20 minutes at a rolling boil would cook the berries.

This was fabulous & will make an excellent Xmas gift. 
A few helpful notes:
1. No need to sterilize or process jars due to high alcohol content- just use clean jars, pour boiling water over jars & lids to thoroughly clean before proceeding.
2. Vodka is great & provides a cleaner berry taste. Rum is also great, but use a high quality rum for smoother taste.
3. For a really clear end product, strain through 4 layers of cheesecloth then a new coffee filter for each 1/2 quart as filter will get clogged.
4. Freeze the berries for ice cream topping etc - they are delicious!

Turned out AMAZING!  It's great sipping over ice, or with a slash of sprite.  I'm not a vodka drinker, but this doesn't taste like vodka at all.  Totally worth trying.  Great recipe

This is an easy basis for a liqueur. Note that Cordial is just another name for "liqueur." I used a bit less vodka, because a quart doesn't necessarily fit in a quart jar when it is filled with berries and sugar. But I ended up making about 3 jars of the stuff. Two months was an excellent aging time. What a treat to have an explosion of blackberry flavor in october/november? Plus, the liqueur will last indefinitely at room temperature if properly corked or sealed.

The waiting was the hardest part.  Also took a while to strain, I didn't do a great job of it, but I'm sure it would produce a nicer end product taking the time and effort to do it.  Great recipe!

I just made this, so I'll have to come back in two months to review the flavor. My 3 stars is based on how easy it was to make, but how the directions should really say "2 quart" jar. I needed to use two 1 quart Mason jars to make the full recipe.

**2 months later**
Upgrading to five stars, because this tastes AMAZING. Mixed half and half with lemonade over ice, it is dangerously good. I'm going to start another batch again soon so I don't have to go too long without it in the summertime.

This is wonderful.  I even fudged on the amounts of berries/vodka and it turned out great (we used blueberries and now we're trying cherries)!  It is delicious and not too sweet.

I added half a vanilla bean to this. I also used tequila and chocolate powder in place of the vodka and fruit. I've also used a combination of blackberry and cherry with the vanilla bean. Wonderful recipe!

I made this with Saskatoon berries, and I let it sit for over year... it is a long story, but just recently I strained it and bottled it for gifts at Christmas.  I think I would add another berry with the Saskatoon berry next time I make this, with just Saskatoon it tastes a bit too medicinal as an after taste.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

We have made this using a variety of fruit. Strawberries, Raspberries, Cranberries and pears. It is wonderful. The raspberry and strawberry mixed with lemonade on a hot summer day is very tasty. We now have a batch going with sour and sweet cherries and swapped out the vodka for Canadian Whiskey. Homemade cherry whiskey, can't wait.

I have made this and it turns out great. I do have a question tho. I have an unopened pickle jar (the big one). It is full and is dark in cooler. It is from a friend's parent and I have no idea how old it is. At least 5 years... Do I drink it?

We have made this for the last 5 years with both raspberries and blackberries from our garden and brandy.  Depending on the supply of berries, we make a half or quarter batch at a time.  My husband enjoys a little glass during the cold winter evenings. Mason jars work well since other jars tended to leak when they were upside down.

I made it with Mulberries from my tree and Vodka - since brandy is already so sweet.  I love it so much, I'm making a Raspberry cordial next!  Thanks for the instructions!
