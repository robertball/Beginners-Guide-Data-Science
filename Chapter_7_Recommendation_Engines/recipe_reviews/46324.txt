The marinade was absolutely delicious.  The first batch was done in a borrowed dehydrater and it tasted better than any jerky I have ever had.  However, the second batch was done in our oven and it was too dry and tasted like pieces of burnt meat.

I made this recipe but changed it a little.  I only used 1 1/2 tbsp. liquid smoke, and I forgot the ketchup on accident.  I'm glad I did, because the jerky turned out AWESOME!  Just like store bought.  Oh, and I sliced my meat a little thicker than what the recipe called for too.

My husband is a busy man during deer season... and therefore I am too. By the end of the season I find myself throwing out meat to make room for more, so I thought what a way to use it all up. The recipe was great, just make sure you dont dehydrate while you are sleeping first batch came out alittle dry. Recipe also works great with cuts of beef.

Full of flavor but not quite enough spice for us...we added some red pepper flakes to the marinade to give it that the added kick it needed.

Hubby the hunter extraordinaire loves venison jerky and also loves black pepper, so he adds more. We have a dehydrator with a ton of trays and there are times that I feel like a meat processing plant. One tip, we quadruple (or more) the recipe and use the 2.5 gallon ziploc bag to marinate. I can't speak to how the oven would work.

I've been making jerky for years and this is one of my favorites.  It also works well hanging the strips with tooth picks in the oven.  Put one rack on lowest level and cover with foil.  Put another rack on top shelf - weave the toothpick at one end of strip and hand on rack!  You can fit a lot more meat in your oven this way and it gets air.  Thanks for the recipe

Excellent and simple!  Modifications:  I was out of onion salt so I used minced onion instead and skipped the additional salt since there is so much in the sauce anyway.  Also, used a dehydrator rather than the oven.  Very, very good flavor.  Better than any I've purchased anywhere.  My son is THRILLED with how we jerkied his first deer!  Thanks!

I have never made jerky before and this came out perfect.  It was gone within 24hrs...  I'll have to make more next time!  I did let it marinate a *long* time (3days....)

Fabulous! My son loves beef jerky. He also loves venison. Put the two together and this is his favorie. So much cheaper than buying it also. He actually makes this himself.  We usually have a lot of venison, so he makes it quite often, or often he doubles or even triples this recipe. He can put it away and quickly. Thanks for this recipe that we use and will use over and over.

I followed the recipe exactly. I put everything in a large tupperware bowl.  I had all of the ingredients at home but the liquid smoke, what made it really nice, nothing too fancy.  The smell of the marinade, made my mouth water. The lowest setting on my oven in @170, so I watched it closely and it turned out being the best jerky I've ever made. The "gamey" taste was GONE.

I followed the recipe very specifically down to detail.  And the jerky tasted very gamey.  My recommendation is to do what everybody else is doing.  And add brown sugar and a lot more pepper.

This is absolutely the best deer jerky ever! I have experimented with it a little..as I usually do a double batch, I have sometimes not doubled the ketchup but instead added the extra Tbsp using BBQ sauce instead. Also I have tried different varieties liquid smoke, mesquite and hickory, we like the hickory the best. Also I slice the meat while partially frozen, makes it much easier to slice, and I do it in a dehydrator.

My father and I are deer hunters and we usually have a lot of meat in the freezer after every season. The past couple of years I have asked my best friend, and best deer hunter I know, for different recipes to use for jerky that his family of deer slayers and game cooks have gathered and used over the years. This year I strayed away and used this recipe. This recipe was MUCH better than any home remedy I have ever used. I gained so much confidence in this recipe that I had a taste test for my best friend’s entire family. They all agreed that THIS recipe was THE BEST. The only changes I made were to add an additional ½ amount of black pepper needed and switched the worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke amounts needed for a little more flavor and kick. Awesome recipe.

Made this the other day...taste just like Wild Bills beef jerky. I used the oven method, my oven will only go down to 170 so I hung all my pieces from toothpicks on the top rack (pain in the butt plus knees and back were on fire..lol)covered bottom rack with foil then left the oven door cracked open a few inches with a little fan helping to circulate the air. Started it at 10 pm and it was perfect at 6 am. BEST recipe ever....however next time I'll add more black pepper. Thanks!

I have had venison jerky before but never made it. My neighbor gave my family some venison as well as antelope. I used this recipe for both and the family LOVED it! It was gone within 24 hours!!! I currently have another batch in the fridge now! I will make this again and again!!!!

I have made this 8 times, each time to the recipe beside tripling it. I have never had anyone not like this jerky. An electric meat slicer makes quick work of the slicing and if you plan on making a lot of jerky, I recommend having one to save time as that is the most physically time consuming part of jerky making.

This is an oustanding jerky recipe.  You can tweak it to meet your taste, add some chiles to it to spice it up.  It should work well with all meats, I used it on duck (mallards and bluebills)

My husband and me really enjoyed this deer jerky. I did think it was just a tad bit too salty. It was very tasty though. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again.

Have made this about 4 times now.  Everybody loves, loves, loves it.  Hubby took it to work and they all wanted to put in "orders" for more.  Perfect way to use up the leftover deer roasts before hunting season starts again and freezer is refilled.  Make a double recipe and just fills our dehydrator.

Too heavy on the smokey flavor for me personally, and lacking in spice. Easily fixed by tweaking the recipe though. My oven only goes down to 170 degrees so my cook time was shortened by about an hour.

Did this recipe with some venison roasts and elk steaks sliced a little over 1/8 in. thin.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added a bit of cayanne pepper to give it a kick.  145°F for 9 hours in a dehydrator produced fine jerky!  Came out great!

This was very good, although we did add about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and were glad we did.  We will also probably double the black pepper next time, but that's just a personal preference for peppery jerky.  Used a food dehydrator and it was fantastic, going fast :)

Made your recipe today.  It turned out excellent!  The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons of Frank's Hot Sauce which made it a little spicy.  Will be using this as my new jerky recipe.  Thanks!

This was the best!  I marinated for an additional day (or two) and added red pepper flakes, my friends couldn't get enough!  I sent it to school with my son as a snack and his teachers are requesting more.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband goes hunting every year and he goes with a group. They don't eat venison so we usually get all the meat. So instead of buying a store bought seasoning decided to try this and we LOVE IT TRULY. Simple and great. Don't even know its venison.

Not a bad recipe, I used Cajun worcestershire that I bought in the French Quarter when I visited New Orleans and added some cayenne and red pepper flakes to make it spicier.  My husband, who I made it for, says it's pretty good, but thinks I can find a better recipe, so I'll keep looking.  But this was easy to put together and I'd recommend it to others.  As a sidenote, my oven's lowest temperature is 170 and this recipe calls for 160--it cooked for three hours at 170 and had a great chewy texture--something to try for those who don't want to wait six hours for the jerky.

I added a Tbsp of brown sugar. Used onion powder instead of onion salt. Next time I will add some hot sauce like others have suggested.  This is great and easy just as written.

I accidentally increased the onion, garlic and pepper to 1/2 tsp. each during mixing. BUT it tasted great. Hubby loved it.   A note for those using their oven: use an oven thermometer. I had never tested my oven before and discovered it runs higher than what I programed it to. My lowest setting is 170, but my thermometer indicated 180, so I needed to slightly crack my oven open to lower it to 160-170.  Also, I noticed a few comments on 'gamey' taste. More often than not a gamey taste is due to not aging the Deer long enough before butchering.  Another help for this is to marinate the jerky for 3 days before drying. Makes a huge difference.

I followed the recipe as directed and it was perfect.  I don't have a dehydrator, so I used the oven.  My oven selection goes from 'warm' to 200 and I had to guess 160 degrees.  I'm going to assume my temp was too high and glad I checked it when I did (only after 4 hours)...just a little too done and crispy instead of chewy.  But awesome flavor - yum!!

To make this a 5 star recipe you need one secret ingredient.  My father-in-law and I have tweeked this very recipe for years and you can play with it alot.  However, one thing is a teaspoon or 2 of Dave's Insanity Sauce.  Be careful with this stuff, it will set your world a blaze@!

This was very good.  I didn't have onion salt, so I used about half a regular onion - small dice.  Added kosher salt since meat loves salt.  Used stainless steel cooling racks and placed them on old cookie sheets to minimize the mess in the oven.  Getting ready to make a second batch!

I tried this recipe this last week with it being deer season and all... and it turned out really well! Instead of cooking it in the oven though I used a dehydrator but the marinade was great. I made one other change, i added just a small handfull of brown sugar to the maridnade before I put the meat in and like I said it turned out great! Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe but added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup, 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of Kraft Honey Bar-B-Que Sauce. My oven would not set below 170 degrees, so I set it on 170 degrees and slowly cooked it for 3-1/2 hours. The deer jerky has a good texture to it and is not tough at all. The next time I make it I think I'll add some extra spices to give it a kick.

My son shot his very 1st deer/buck this year, and we love jerky so I used this recipe, and it turned out amazing!!!  Then my husband said it needed more heat, so in the 2nd batch I made, I forgot the ketchup on accident, but added a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and only did 1 1/2 tbsp of liquid smoke, and cut the meat a little bit thicker and well we ate the whole batch in a matter of minutes!!!!

Thank you Mike Shelton this is a great way to enjoy venison. I have made it many times . T he only change I made was to use Famous Dave's devils spit xxx hot BBQ sauce in place of ketchup. It gave it just enough zing ! The original recipe is great the way it is but if you like a small amount of hot flavor try it with some hot BBQ sauce.

Delicious and the best jerky I've made yet!
I did substitute brown sugar for the ketchup, but this stuff is addictive.
If your new to jerky, get a dehydrator and a food sealer.
Jerky is supposed to keep up to a couple years or better in the freezer though it never seems to hang around here long enough to find out.

This jerky was very flavorful-we used a food dehydrator and it only took about 18 hours to fully dehydrate.   We sliced the venison pretty thin and it was slightly crunchy and chewy all at once.  Thanks!

This is the best! Way better than anything you could buy in a package. I divided the recipe and put red pepper flake in half. Both tasted awesome, but I am a fan of a little spice.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did diffent was added some brown sugar and more pepper. And according to my husband it was great, but he would have liked it even more peppery. My 1st batch was gone in 8 hours!

I actually haven't tried this particular recipe but it looks very similar to one that my dad used a lot.  Just a note that I thought might be helpful is that instead of laying the strips directly on the racks we would put a toothpick through one end of the strips and hang them vertically from the rack. I might add that even if you carefully line the oven with aluminum foil you will still have a messy oven to clean, I guess that is why my mom hates deer season. lol

Its been years since I had a good jerkey. This recipe is perfect. I did however leave the door of the oven cracked open while on heat. Actually forgot and left it in there 9 hrs but it came out flavorful. I did also personally leave my deer meat a couple days in water to drain the blood, and then pre soaked it in the marinade for probably another 3 days. The gameyness is mostly gone so..  thank you for the jerky

Added a tablespoon of brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper, omitted salt, and substituted onion powder for onion salt.  I dehydrated it in the oven at 160 for 6 hours, probably could have stopped at 5 hours.  Defiantly a keeper!

This recipe tastes just like store bought jerky.  I don't add liquid smoke.  Also, I use Dale's steak sauce instead of Worcestershire.  If you like sweet and sour, use honey teriyaki marinade instead of Worcestershire and soy sauce.  Great recipe!!!

I love this recipe.  It's easy, cheap and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  It's not over powering as you can still taste that it is deer.  I have been making it for a few years now and have found it to be a good base to add different flavors to as well.  My whole family loves it.

Very good.  In the future I will omit the 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  It's probably salty enough with the soy and Worcestershire sauce.  I also made one alteration and added about 3/4 tablespoon of sesame oil.

I tried this recipe with venison and a brand new dehydrator. It turned out very well. Since then I've tried 3 other recipes and they just weren't as good. This recipe is simple and makes a great flavored final product. My only change is to use low sodium soy sauce. I'm marinating another batch as I write this.

I didn't try any changes - I liked the consistency and flavor - I was surprised how dark it came out, but this was my first time making venison jerky.  I dried it over 7 hours in a Cabela's Harvester Pro electric dehydrator.

Great flavor, didn't have enough liquid smoke to add all it called for but it was still good. 7 hrs might have been a little too long. I'm going to try 6hrs next time.

I think I like this recipe because it's heavy on the Worcestershire (must be the anchovies :). Last batch, I deleted the ketchup and added 1/4 cup of light brown sugar; we like the sweet and salty thang. Yum! Another thing I do is to not worry about slicing the meat thin. Just take a hunk and beat the heck out of it with a course tenderising hammer on a plastic cutting board (sort of like cubed steak) until it's quite thin (do both sides a couple of times). The tougher cuts come out more tender and the meat takes the marinade quicker.

Note: Cheap dehydrators may not get hot enough. Test for 140+ degrees or finish in the oven (for safety). We scored a barely used Nesco (adjustable temp) with extra trays a few years back at a yard sale for $25 (!!). Keep your eyes open.

excellent recipe, same one i used to use when i was a kid that i found in an old cookbook. one suggestion that i might add was to change out the soy sauce with teriyaki sauce, tried it one time because we were out of soy, little different taste but i like it maybe u will too. i usually make both now just to give me two different kinds of jerky.

Excellent recipe!  I cut my meat much thicker than recommended here (~1/4 - 3/8" thick) and used a food dehydrator.  I also like my jerky a bit spicy, so I added 4 Tbsp Tobasco and 1 Tbsp red pepper flakes to the marinade.  Turned out perfect!

I tried this recipe and it worked out nicley. Instead of adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt, I added cayenne pepper instead to give a lil' kick.

Hubby gobbled this up!  I just added spices until I felt like it was right though.
