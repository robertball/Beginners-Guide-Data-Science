This is a pretty much standard traditional buttercream frosting offering the best of what both shortening (use hi-ratio for best results) and butter have to offer - namely, the stability and pure white color of the shortening and the unbeatable flavor of butter. Splitting hairs, perhaps, but I'd prefer it with a little less butter.  Ideally, I like 2 cups of powdered sugar to 1/2 cup (8T.) of fat, be it shortening or butter.

Just as the name implies, it’s simple and delicious.  A good standard buttercream frosting that made the perfect amount for 12 cupcakes using a #2 frosting tip.   I added an extra ¼ cup of confectioner’s sugar to tighten it up for piping.

I tried this recipe on a whim and I am very pleased with it. I made it exactly as written and it made enough to frost a 13x9 cake nicely.

This was very tasty. I made 40 cupcakes for my sister's rehearsal dinner and used this recipe to frost. I got a lot of compliments on how delicious the frosting was. One word of advice - I calculated 48 servings and did not have enough to frost 40 cupcakes. If you are going to 'pipe' the frosting you will need more frosting so calculate accordingly. Great recipe...good consistency, great taste.

I have tried so many buttercream recipes and they were either ok or horrible.. this one is by far the best I have ever made.. I recommend beating the butter and shortening for atleast 10-15 min to give it a nice fluffy and creamy texture.. love it!

I made this frosting for my daughter's b-day cake. It was my first attempt at homemade frosting. I will never buy canned again. So easy to make and tastes amazing. Everyone commented how good it was. :)

this was the most perfect frosting I have ever made. Make sure to beat the butter and shortening for quite a while to get it light and fluffy. It is so worth it. My husband never likes frosting, even he says this is perfect.

This is a good basic buttercream. It was super easy to whip up. I had some left over after frosting the cupcakes. It kept well in the fridge for a week.  Thanks Denise

I followed the directions for this frosting exactly, until the very last and I added Hershey's Dark Cocoa.  The frosting by itself is REALLY sweet, by adding the bitterness of the powdered cocoa, it cuts the sweetness and is an awesome frosting!!!  Thanks Denise for sharing this recipe with us.

I just made this frosting to pipe onto twelve cupcakes. I did use one stick plus two Tbs salted butter instead of butter and shortening, just personal preference. I saw other reviewers mention it was too sweet so I added about 1/2 tsp salt. This added the perfect balance for me. I did beat the heck out of this frosting and it was well worth it. Great flavor and very fluffy! Will use this again.

Awesome.  I changed it a bit to make it dairy free for my niece.  I used coconut oil instead of butter and almond milk for the milk.  It was great and very light.  I may always use this version instead of the regular dairy one!

Pretty good stuff, not what I was looking for but did good for my carrot cake. I added some almond extract to jazz it up.

This was a pretty good icing, but it was to sweet. Which led to it being a little grainy. Otherwise I loved how it was half butter half shortening.

I tweeked this a little, I used coconut oil instead of the shortening, and cut the sugar, which turned out maybe not as stiff for a really nice piped decoration version, but tasted great, and I'm a novice at pipe work any how, ha..ha..

This is by far one of the best tasting buttercream frostings that I have ever tasted.  If there were more stars to give, I would give them.  Just an FYI though, I quadrupled the recipe in order to cover 30 cupcakes.

Very nice buttercream icing. I did up the vanilla to a full teaspoon and cut the milk back just a touch. Just what I needed for a homemade yellow cake.

Love it! This recipe is exactly as described; simple and delicious.  I made the mistake of refrigerating it while waiting for the cake to cool, so I had to let it soften a while before I could frost the cake. There was just enough to frost a 9x13 cake so if you make a double layer round, I would suggest tripling this recipe. This will be my "go to" frosting from now on.

This is the "sugary frosting" you can ask for when you get a cake from the bakery. I had to add more vanilla than the recipe called for.  I frosted a 2 layer, 9" cake with a double batch, however, I didn't frost a thick enough layer of frosting between cakes. Next time, I would triple the recipe and likely mix longer than the recipe states to see if that cuts down the granular texture of the sugar. This will work if you are looking for a go-to recipe and don't have the time to really look through other recipes' reviews!

This is a nice frosting and not too sweet. It does become rather soft when piping  onto cake or cupcakes which requires a trip to the frig to regain the consistency needed. I will use it again.

Light and fluffy and very easy. If you are looking for a fast and nearly foolproof frosting this is it. Be prepared to double the recipe though there wasn't much in a batch. It is just as easy to make in multiple batches at once as it is to do one at a time though!

No changes! I can see where you can fool around with this recipe.  The only thing it was not enough to do a double layercake.Had to double it!

I tried this buttercream frosting because I had all of the ingredients on hand. The directions were clear and easy, and not the problem.  The problem is the shortening in the buttercream frosting.  That combined with the butter was one I wasn't satisfied with. Yep, I'm a buttercream snob. I want 100% butter.  But it took this recipe to figure that out and I'm grateful for the experience. So it is on to other buttercream frosting recipes...and next time, the best butter I can buy. Another lesson learned.

The first time I tried this, I didn't have all ingredients and substitutions don't work. Today I did it exactly as directed and it came out perfect! I beat it a little longer to give it a lighter consistency, so now it's more of a whipped than a buttercream but it's delicious regardless!

After trying to find a buttercream recipe, I stumbled upon this one, and it is delicious. It works well with lemon cupcakes and I'm going to use this recipe for buttercream. Instead of 2 tbs of milk I used 1 tbs of heavy whipping cream and 1 tbs of milk. It didn't change anything, but I just tried it to do something different.

This is an excellent frosting! So easy and thankfully most people will have all the necessary ingredients on hand. I didn't have salted butter so I added just a pinch of salt at the end and it really evened out the sweetness of the frosting. Love it! Will use again!

This is by far the best buttercream frosting I have made yet.  One of my suggested tips is to make it the night before you need to use the frosting, it seems to setup much nicer and the sugar granules are null.  Happy Tasting!

The only change I made was to cut out shortening and use all butter, as this is a buttercream frosting., not a shortening frosting. This seems to be the recipe Mom and I followed, found on the box of confectioner's sugar. She put it on our Devil's Food birthday cakes. So good!

Loved it. Doubled the recipe. I just moved and did not have the proper measuring tool. So I weighed my powdered sugar. I did not require any milk as the spreading consistency was perfect. Will definitely make again.

I made this frosting for a triple layer chocolate cake, also found here . I am diabetic so I used 1 cup of Stevia to substitute for the  2 cups of sugar and added about 1/2 tsp peppermint extract and a few drops of  green food  coloring  and dusted the end product with red decorating  sugar.  The texture was a little grainy due to  using the Stevia instead of the confectioners sugar, but overall turned out good.

I followed the recipe as written but took the advice of others to beat the shortening and butter for at least 10 minutes.  I think that really made a difference in the texture.  My grandchildren frosted (fairly sparingly) 45 cupcakes with two batches of frosting! I also sifted the powdered sugar which may also have helped with the consistency.

This was a simple and traditional buttercream that was great to use for piping.  It did get a little soft, but, I rerfrigerated it for a short time and it set up perfectly.  I used whipping cream instead of milk.

I did it with a little bit more vanilla, but other than that it was a good recipe. I would recommend food coloring to make it look better and refrigerating it before using.

This recipe was fabulous! Exactly what I needed. I would suggest, though, adding just a bit more milk because this icing is very sweet. But for me...PERFECT!!????

Great basic recipe.
My game-changer? Add a third to a  half a mini bottle of jelly belly drink concentrate for flavor. Made a tangy blue raspberry to go with the lemon cake for my son's birthday cake. I go lighter on the sugar a little more butter for a smoother consistency and less sweet flavor.

I tripled the recipe and used 1 cup butter, 1 cup shortening and a tablespoon of vanilla. I only used 1 tble and 2 tsps heavy cream and the taste was great! Not too sweet. I’m going to use it to ice cupcakes

Delicious frosting - I can eat it by the spoon full!! Way better than the frosting of store cakes or in cans. Supper easy to make! The recipe makes more than enough to frost 2 dozen sugar cookies.

Very good frosting.  My only recommendation is to use really softened butter, otherwise it's very hard to beat out the butter lumps.  Next time I will quickly zap the butter in the microwave - not enough to melt, just enough to make it very soft.  As the title says: it is a simple and delicious frosting. I will use this recipe often.

shortening absolutely ruined it. I only used 3tbs because someone mentioned using more butter than shortening, but even that was too much.

I tried to fix it with more of everything else but it still tasted awful, I'd exclude the shortening all together if I ever used this recipe again.

it might look good as a decorative frosting (I wouldn't know), but if you're looking to just make a yummy cake, avoid this recipe! I'm so glad I chose not to put it on the cake, the cake luckily tasted amazing without frosting.

I hoped that the shortening in the frosting would make it  better.  All it did for me was make a greasy frosting.  Shorting in place of butter gives the frosting  a greasy store bought frosting feel with less taste.  There is no flavor in shorting,  so you lose a lot when you sub this for the real butter.  I was in the mood to try something a little different, but have learned my lesson. I 'll just stick with the original recipe out of my cook book.

This was very good, however I changed some things- I used 10 tbsp of butter in place of the shortening and added roughly 1 and 1/3 cups of confectioners sugar. It turned out very well for my red velvet cake.

I don't normally write reviews, but this was outstanding! It was the perfect amount of sweetness and richness. I used all butter because I don't use shortening for anything. It was very firm when refrigerated. I made a double batch for 24 cupcakes. It would also be great on sugar cookies.

I found this recipe for a group of 12 year olds to use on their cupcakes.  As a whole we loved it, but when using food coloring moniter the amount or the frosting will become too loose.  I just added a touch more sugar to stiffen it back up, also including the coloring as part of the milk will work.

Wow.....this is as true to bakery frosting as you can get! Like other reviewers, I took their comments to heart. It really is important that you beat this frosting for a good 10-15mins on whip, otherwise you'll taste the shortening in it. I used 6Tbsp of butter flavoured Crisco and 4Tbsp of butter. It kept  a stiff consistency. I also used an extra cup of confectioners sugar. This is now my go to recipe.

It's consistancy was perfect, nice and fluffy but I didn't really like the taste. Next time I try using unsalted butter (and just add a pinch of salt) and more butter in stead of shortening.

Used 3 T shortening and the rest butter. Doubled recipe for 2 layer cake. Absolutely positively without a doubt the yummiest frosting I have ever, and I mean ever, made. Party goers went CRAZY for this frosting. In fact, most wished I made more and served it with spoons. Yeah really!!!  I read the reviews before making. Everyone has a different idea of what they think is good. The above is this Oklahoma gal's opinion.

I used this to decorate a cake, which involved dying the icing green, it took the color very well. I also used it, with no dye, on cupcakes.  have never received as many complements on icing as I did when I used this recipe! I added a bit of LorAnn brand butter vanilla emulsion for a little added flavor.( I just eyeballed it)

I really liked it. It was delicious but the moment I added even a small amount of milk, it refused to hold its shape any longer. The consistency was fine before I added it. I tried to counteract this with more sugar, but that only helped so much. This was probably part of a problem with the fact that I had to mix my frosting by hand. On the plus side, it was still tasty and it also holds color very well. I also used unsalted butter and found no need to add salt.

This is truly a simple and delicious buttercream frosting. I have been baking vegan for almost 7 years and found this really easy to veganize. With organic powdered sugar, Earth Balance butter and vegan shortening, I created a vegan frosting that is just as delicious as any that I've eaten that is baked by a professional pastry Chef! Yum!

I modified this to an all butter buttercream and I'm glad I did. It didn't leave a slick heavy feel in my mouth. This has a good piping consistency but it goes soft a little bit too easy.

it tasted very generic and possibly too buttery. My husband and I couldn't figure out exactly what was wrong with it, but neither of us liked it at all, unfortunately.

OMG I am literally eating a piece of cake right now with this frosting and it is delish! Excellent buttercream flavor and whips up nicely, very spreadable and fluffy. A great frosting and definately a keeper! PS I added some cocoa powder for some chocolate flavor and it is terrific! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was too sweet for me, I'm not really one for sweet things though.  Also I didn't use salted butter I used unsalted but I did add a pinch of salt to try and make up for it.

I made this frosting exactly as directed.  I don't like frostings that are too sweet.  Too much powdered sugar seems to make them too heavy also.  This was perfect.  I made a double batch which frosted a 2 layer 8'' cake and decorated it.

Love it! I put in a little less confectioners sugar than suggested and added in a little peanut butter. Just a warning - if you don't add enough sugar it tastes like the shortening, even when I had 1/2 cup butter and 2 teaspoons (or tablespoons, whatever the recipe called for) of shortening. It also lightly frosted around 20 cupcakes, if you need a good estimate. :)

I was making a cake and realized I'd forgotten to get icing at the store. Now I'll never buy it again! This recipe is absolutely delicious. My husband devoured it and wanted me to make more just for him to eat- no cake needed.

This buttercream frosting is the BEST I've ever made. I did end of adding an extra half cup or so of powdered sugar, and it came out perfectly. I used a stand mixer and let it run for a good 10 or 15 minutes, scraping the bowl every so often. I ended up with a light, whipped frosting with a lovely flavor, so it's worth the time it takes to let it get to that point. This will the only buttercream frosting I'll need from now on.

I just made this frosting for my baby girl who turns 10 tomorrow and will be celebrating with her class.  it was easy and I added food coloring to the frosting to make a soft purple and a electric blue!  the frosting left a iridescent tint so adding the colors made it really beautiful!  thank you tons and you have officially been added to my recipe box!  GOD BLESS!

I needed a frosting that didn't have cream, to frost 24 cupcakes.  I read another review that said that doubling the recipe didn't frost 24 cupcakes when piping, so I played around with the calculator to make my measurements easy.  I calculated up to 38 serving which made the measurements for butter and shortening exactly one cup.  Needless to say I have quite a bit left over that I'm hoping freezes well, because it's in my freezer :)  Anyway, I kept all measurements the same for 38 servings, except the confectioners sugar.  It called for 6 1/3 cups and I used one bag, which is about 5 cups.  5 cups worked for me, it was sweet enough but not too sweet.  This frosting is so light, yet hold up to piping.  I will definitely use it again!

This is a great recipe! I use it all the time and have never had any problems. You can reduce the sweetness if you don't have that biggest sweet tooth by simply adding less powdered sugar. Sometimes I add 1/4 cup less to the frosting and it hasn't affected it in any way. All around a great recipe and I will continue using it.

I have made this recipe for several birthday cakes now for my daughters and it is really easy and tasty. I use butter flavored shortening, and add a tiny bit of salt and it's perfect.

Every since I made this recipe, I have not bought any can made icing. I can change the flavor to what I want, and it always come out perfect. I make it all the time for co-workers, friends and families and they love it! It's not too sweet, but just right!

Good, but it was more "buttery" than I like my frosting to be, and therefore much too rich.  When I made it the second time, I used only 3 tablespoons of each fat and upped the milk to 3 tablespoons (but kept the sugar and vanilla the same). I liked it much better - it wasn't so cloying after the alteration.

The taste was good but the consistency was never how they are in the pictures (except for the second one). Whenever I tried to use this recipe to decorate my cakes/cupcakes with, I usually just got a gloppy mess.

This is a great recipe-the mixture of butter and shortening stabilizes the frosting without detracting from the flavor.  Thanks!

I have made many different versions of buttercream and I really like this one.   Too often they end up too sweet but I think the combo of the shortening and salted butter (or in my case I added 1/4 tsp of salt as I didn't have salted butter) gives it a great texture and flavor.   I will make this again for sure.

Doubled the recipe, added 3/4 cup of cocoa and 2 tsp of instant coffee dissolved in a little hot water for a chocolate buttercream. Was a delicious, decadent frosting for my mother's 80th birthday cake. Everyone loved it.

Best frosting I have made. Used all butter, since my enormous can of shortening had gone bad, and it turned out divine. So light and fluffy! Used it to frost  "Easy Sugar Cookies" that I found on this site, and I am telling you... Bakery quality for sure!

I have never made butter-cream frosting before. So, for my husband's birthday I decided to give it a whirl.. This is so easy, very tasty. Not to sweet (which is one reason I never bothered making butter-cream frosting).. All I did different was I ended up adding one extra tablespoon of milk, to thin it just a little bit and added some lemon pudding mix (about 2-3 tablespoons).. Light lemon flavored butter-cream frosting. Not bad at all.. :)

Consistency was pretty good but I thought it was too sweet and I thought the shortening was too obvious in the overall flavor. I'm going to look for another recipe. Or try to adjust this one and leave out the shortening.

i cant give 5 stars since i used margarine instead of the butter and shortening in the recipe which means i modified the recipe slightly.  i think this recipe is even BETTER than the ready made buttercream frosting that i usually buy. i used it to frost my christmas fruit cake and everyone was impressed. thank you so much for such an amazing and easy recipe.

Typical buttercream frosting. Very easy to make. I had an 8x8 size cake, so I split the recipe in half.  Worked great!
