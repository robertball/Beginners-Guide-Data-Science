Very tasty sauce!  Now, I have to admit, I think "steak sauce" is an insult to a good steak, but what I was having tonight wasn't good steaks, it was some super thin cuts of round that I would be frying and with that, I like steak sauce.  I'm out of both steak sauce and money to buy steak sauce so I found this recipe and had all the ingredients so I whipped it up.  I'm eating it now and loving it!  My only change was to use spicy brown mustard because I'm out of plain yellow.  Thanks for cracking the steak sauce code!  (And fyi for some reviewers:  It doesn't taste just like A-1, or 57, because it's NOT either one of those things, but it IS very tasty.)

4 stars because my kids turned up their noses & demanded A1. This was very simple to make. The only changes that I made was to add an extra tbsp of Worsterchire and I also added about 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke. This a good steak sauce & I plan on keeping it around.

A quick and easy last minute sauce.  Tastes great, and with simple ingredients you're likely to have them on hand.

A real emergency in the house tonight - for Hubs, not for me. For him eating a steak without A-1 is like, hmmmm, for me eating a cheeseburger without pickles and sauteed onions.  The Worcestershire gave it the A-1 flavor and the vinegar the appropriate tang.  And, as always, in consideration of his sensitive innards, I left out the hot sauce.  It won't make him a convert from his A-1 (his fault, by the way, for not writing it on the grocery list as it ran low!), but it sure was a lifesaver for his steak in a pinch.

Very good! Easy to make, had all the ingredients on hand. I'm not a big fan of hot sauce though so I left that out.

I recently made this sauce when I realized I was out of steak sauce.  We loved it.  After making it I went shopping & had steak sauce on my list but after seeing it was over $4 for a bottle I will be making this many times.  I made it as written the first time but it is such a recipe that you can make it to your liking.  Thank you for a great recipe.

My husband liked this a lot. Made a great dipping sauce for his tator tots. We spread them on hamburgers; it had a nice tangy taste to it. I added some Splenda since it wasn't quite sweet enough (we used Heinz ketchup!) Different than the regular steak sauce I've used but I really liked it. Thanks!

Very tasty.  I've never been a fan of A1 & most of the time, a great steak needs no sauce on my plate but my husband likes a little sauce.  I substituted the apple cider vinegar for balsamic & will be saving this recipe to make again when we run out.  Thanks for sharing.

Not bad if you realize you're out of A1.  I added some garlic powder and onion powder to it, but my husband still prefers his A1 steak sauce.

I have been making a similar steak sauce for years, mine has one exception I use Soya Sauce instead of salt. I simply enjoy the flavor of the soya sauce better than plain salt.

Seriously - this tastes better than store-bought. I'm not a huge steak fan and NEVER have steak sauce around, but it whips up in a couple minutes and is DELISH!

I added cayenne instead of hot sauce. I also added garlic powder and more worcestershire because I felt I could still taste the vinegar. The next day it was even better!

First thing you can taste is ketchup.  It was more like bbq sauce then steak sauce.

This was good, I did have to make a few adjuments... instead of worcestershire I used soy sauce. I also added some more spices, just to suit my taste.

I don't usually remember to review the dishes I try, but this steak sauce is so good that my family can't stop eating it on everything. My son dips all his food in it, and my son-in-law keeps putting it on his sandwiches too! Even my fussy daughter can't stay out of it. I will never buy steak sauce again. Thank you so much for such a wonderfully easy recipe that has made me a hit around here!

This is a great little sauce that I did use for steak, but this would be great on a lot of things. I had to use the rooster sauce in place of the tobasco sauce, I think that's what made this so good to me because I love rooster sauce.

Great basis for steak sauce. I took others recommendations and added a splash of soy sauce and a pinch of brown sugar. I used Siracha hot sauce instead of tabasco. Excellent

My son made this and it is so worth making for the fact that you save yourself money and that the best ingredients are used.

I just whipped this up as we just bought steaks and forgot to snag much needed steak sauce. I LOVE it.  My husband, however, hates it, thinks it's too ketchupy. Maybe if I had some ketchup that wasn't heinz he may have liked it, so I will try that next time.  Have yet to test it out on the kids.  Oh yeah, and due to lack of stuff I had to change a couple of ingredients--I didn't have Apple Cider Vinegar, so I used Balsamic Vinegar.  I also didn't have enough yellow mustard, so I used Spicy Brown Mustard which added another additional nice kick.

I am going 4 stars because it was a great launching off point for me. I will start by saying that I am not a big ketchup person. This was way too much ketchup flavor for me. To get away from that I added ground mustard, liquid smoke, i used spicy brown mustard, a lot more worcestershire and soy sauce. I did not have apple cider vinegar (which I suspect makes a big difference) but the pomegranate balsamic I had on hand worked out nicely. Almost as good as the real thing. Good luck and enjoy this recipe!

i'm not much of a steak sauce person but my son and husband enjoy it. made steak tonight but didn't have any A1 (their preffered brand) so i searched the internet for a recipe that had a similar taste and that i had the ingredients for.  i chose this one but added a few more things. onion powder, garlic powder, soy sauce and a tiny bit of orange extract. and i used brown dijon instead of yellow mustard since that is what i had in my fridge. i'm not the best with measuring so if/when i make this again i'll be sure to measure out my additions. my son approved the end result and even may 6 yr old daughter likes it.

I was excited when I saw this recipe because I had all ingredients on hand. Once I made it, it was just okay. I had to add a little sugar and honey to get rid of the bitter taste. Oh a bright note, my husband liked it, so at least I didn't waste anything.

This is pretty good. Made it for hamburger patties tonight. I had to add sugar and wished I would have not added all the salt, but I'm certain its because of the ketchup I used.

This steak sauce came together in a flash, and was DELICIOUS to boot. I'm a huge fan of A1, but it just cannot beat this homemade sauce, even though it's made with simple ingredients. My kids and I couldn't get enough of it! My husband liked it too ...:) Thanks for this amazingly amazing recipe!

Very nice. I added some cayenne--much like the brand name sauce, but with more of a bite. Keeps in the fridge well, too. I don't plan on buying the named stuff ever again.

I made this and it's amazing! Way cheaper than A1 or Heinz 57. I added garlic powder and use store brand ketchup. I also use about 1/2 tsp of Louisiana hot sauce. This is good on steak, burgers, potatoes, pork chops etc. I will make this and keep it in a jar in the fridge.

I thought this was delicious!  Very fresh and flavorful.  I don't use a lot of sauce on steaks as I don't think they need much but this was really, really good!  I made a batch to take to a cookout and it was a big hit!

With the hot sauce, this tastes exactly like Heinz 57.  Don't forget to add garlic powder, onion powder, and celery seed.  Leave out the hot sauce if you want it more like A1.

Easy peasy to make; awesome to eat. I mistakenly went heavy on the ketchup, but the sauce was still very tasty with a little heat. Not quite A-1, but in my opinion anyway, loads better! Thanks for the recipe. Definitely will use this again.

I felt that I needed to comment on this. I really like this, but I googled an a1 recipe and found this. I even saw reviews that said it was like a1. I did add 1/2 tsp onion powder and garlic powder each, but this was definitely a mock 57 sauce not a1.

Excellent sauce, takes only a few minutes to make.  Most of the ingredients you already have in your pantry.  I will be making this and using it again!

I taste it and thought it taste just like Ketchup. I asked my wife to taste it, without sharing my opinion, and she said "It taste like Ketchup". Not certain why the positive reviews, but not good at all.

This was good when I was in a pinch and out of A-1.  Not the same, but still good.  The mustard was overpowering so I would use less of that.  I also added some seasoned salt and some brown sugar.

I was out of A1 and needed a sauce... the flavor is good and I added some soy and garlic powder and onion powder this helped the flavor but I am an A1 fan. NO way is it close to a replacement, this is a ketchup flavored sauce.

Great sauce but my fiance doesn't think it will replace his A-1 sauce for his steak.  But we think it'll be great with ribs with more tabasco sauce.  Easily made in five minutes.

We made this when we discovered we had no A1 sauce for our steaks at a family dinner. We made the following substitutions due to lack of ingredients: white vinegar for cider vinegar, 1 packet Taco Bell mild sauce for tobasco. We added a dollop of barbecue sauce to give it some sweetness and smokier flavor. Liquid smoke and/or brown sugar would also probably be a good addition to experiment with. Both husbands liked it, and even most of the kids ate it, although it was a little spicy for them. Now my brother-in-law wants to try using it as a marinade for chicken... it will be yummy for sure! We will keep this recipe around, although we will still probably use A1 for steaks. A good backup! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great sauce, I added a pinch of garlic power and onion powder.  Everyone at dinner loved it.

Hmmm! No not a keeper for us, it reminded us of Heinz 57 which we dont care for. It also had a strong ketchup taste so I tweaked it a bit I added a little liquid smoke and 2 TBS.dark molasses, cutting the honey to 1/4 c. I think I will let it set over night and try it tomorrow. Maybe this will be a rewrite.

I wasn't sure if we'd like this recipe so I cut the recipe in half. But I wish I would have made the full batch because it was great! I do like my steak sauce a little sweet so I added some brown sugar to taste. It was just what I was looking for. I'll be making it over and over again.

This is a great base, I say that as I got strong ketchup and mustard flavors versus the Worcestershire and other ingredients. I did add more Worcestershire, as well as soy sauce, garlic powder, paprika, red pepper, and chipotle pepper. I let that all marry in the fridge which turned out pretty darn good. I'll definitely use this again with my own additions. Thanks for the recipe!

I used my favorite brand of mustard, but followed the rest of the directions.  Super good!  I used it as a marinade for tofu and a dip for vegetables, baked potatoes and steak.  I also used it as a flavoring in the recipe for Better Homes and Gardens smoky cheese ball

I didnt realize that I was out of steak sauce until after I cooked my steak and didnt feel like going to the store. I had all of the ingredients so I gave it  a try. Very happy with the results. I didnt have yellow mustard but I had horseradish deli mustard and it gave the sauce a nice little kick. I also added more worcestershire  sauce. Will surely make this again

The only changes  I made was bringing it to a boil and adding a little more vinegar and pepper. That was an attempt to help it taste less ketchupy.  I gave it one start because I don't consider it a steak sauce 
It taste more like Barbecue sauce. My wifes comment was that it tasted like a hot dog because of the ketchup and mustard flavors. I'll keep searching.

I have allergies to preservatives in food so I make almost all of my own sauces, dressings, and gravies. This recipe was really good, but missing "something". I had a bottle of A1 in the fridge (hubby's) and the ingredients mentioned garlic and onion. I added a little of both garlic and onion powder to the sauce concoction that I made and it made it SO much better!

Forgot to pick up more at the store so looked up steak sauce here.  This was really good.  My husband likes A1 and I like Heinz 57. The taste was somewhere between the two.  This will be our steak sauce for now on.  Loved it!

Very good but had to add and adjust a few things the 2nd, 3rd time around and so on.  We love vinegar in my house and our sauce to be caliente. I follow ingredients but I use 3 different vinegars in equal proportions (apple cider, balsamic and red wine), lots of Worcestershire, store brand ketchup seems to give the perfect flavor and not the sweetness, couple dashes of soy sauce, a couple shakes of tapatillo hot sauce, a tsp lemon juice, 1/2 Tb red pepper flakes, 1/2 -1 capful of liquid smoke, 1 tsp brown sugar. ** Most importantly - heat to low simmer to allow the pepper flake oil to mix throughout. Simmer 2 minutes. I store mine in a canning jar in the refrigerator, the heat from the sauce seals canning lid closed.

Added additional Worcestershire, pepper and hot sauce

Spilit in half and add more hot sauce to one half for spicier version.

Excellent sauce and very easy to tweak to your specific taste (I like to kick up the heat with a habanero hot sauce). This is great for enhancing lean cuts of meat and burgers.

Quite good for an easy to make sauce with common ingredients.  When you are out of steak sauce and have made a less than ideal piece of meat it does a bang-up job.

This is a good sauce. If you want it to taste more like A-1, add a little bit of molasses to it.

I don't every really use steak sauce so I'm probably not the best judge.  I made this recipe for a fish sandwich recipe since we don't have steak sauce.  It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure if I'd use it on my steak.  It worked well on a sandwich since it tastes a lot like ketchup.

I usually go for darker brown steak sauces.  This one was excellent though.  I did split the the mustard between yellow and brown spicy, added a little more Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco as well as about 1T of fish sauce, which I had on hand.  I used it right away and it was very good.  I tried it the next day after all the flavors had a chance to marry, still tasted great but the heat really came out.  I like it but if you don't like the spiciness you might want to limit the Tabasco to the recipe or even cut it back a little.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out pretty good.  I marinated venison steaks with it and then also served some at the table.  Big hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this sauce since I forgot to buy it while I was at the store. I also forgot Worcestershire sauce so I replaced that with soy sauce and added a pinch of garlic. Husband loved it :)

I don't like steak sauce at all, and this was pretty good. It turned out kind of sweet even though I used only 1 cup of Heinz ketchup and used a little more vinegar (half apple cider-half balsamic). To try to cut the sweetness, I added lots of garlic and onion powder. I made it for a recipe needing steak sauce, and the food turned out delicious. I think I will like it as a dipping sauce for steak.

Try adding finely minced onions,  spiral cut hot dogs and simmer together until the 'dogs' plump up. Been making for years and kid favorite.

I ran out of A1, and didn't have time to go out. I quickly made this as specified, except using a local bought BBQ hot sauce. This sauce was pretty good, but I wouldn't trade my A1. I'm going to use this recipe the next time I make my meatloaf as a topping. I think it'll be a tasty addition.

I used Heinz ketchup which IS too sweet just like it says in the footnotes. Also I added 10x the pepper, 14x the Worcester sauce, and 3x the vinegar. It may just be me but this is not a very robust recipe. Also my favorite steak sauce is A1. When I was finished the outcome was a little bit sweeter and a little spicier than A1.

I make this every time we have steak.  I add a little bit more yellow mustard in mine and the hot sauce is habanero just for more kick.  This can easily be adjusted to your own taste.

Was looking for a simple recipe for steak sauce since I didn't have anything in house, and this one came up. Not bad, though I ended up increasing the apple cider vinegar to two tablespoons to give it a bit more sourness, and to make it thinner consistency, like A-1 is. Also added 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of Liquid Smoke.

I'm not a steak sauce aficionado so I don't generally have a brand preference but when I require steak sauce I won't eat my food without it. This  is a good sauce recipe especially when you're in a pinch and it's easy too.

I liked this sauce but it didn't taste like A1. I experimented a little with increasing the Worcestershire  and by adding a drop or two of liquid smoke. I even tried a little molasses. It ended up tasting a lot like Heinz 57 sauce. I actually got a very interesting result by making a paste out of sun dried tomatoes that had become a darker and added a little to the steak sauce. It actually tastes like A1 now. (I got the idea from another recipe that used raisins).

was good...more like Heinz steak sauce. Easy, ingredients are staples on hand. We added more worcestershire and tabasco to taste. Great on our Venison tenderloin kabobs!

We left out the hot sauce, but for the base it's a good substitute. I don't like buying steak sauce since it hardly gets used and goes to waste. We did find the ketchup to be overpowering, so we used a little more Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and spice to counterbalance it. Next time I will use less ketchup and add more if need be.

This was a fantastic recipe! Tasted JUST like A1. I left out the hot pepper sauce bc of my kiddos. Everyone LOVED IT! We used it on top of the Spinach and  Blue Cheese Meatloaf Muffins. Also on allrecipes!

We do not usually use steak sauce but I will use this as a dipping sauce and a topping for meatloaf.  I like this one since it is not too heavy on the Worcestershire.  I experimented with a third of it and added garlic powder and a couple of drops of liquid smoke but the recipe is great as written.

I thought it was great.  I would never use it for steak, but it is rather nice with chips instead of HP or ketchup.  I made it because I had a recipe for Barbecue Sauce that called for Steak Sauce as an ingredient.

Great recipe, I added a variety of things because I did not have Worcestershire sauce.  A touch of ground cloves, garlic powder, a touch of molasses.  It was perfectly fine and a great base for other things.

Needed steak sauce for a recipe and was out. Made this up and was a close substitute for a popular brand. 4 stars as written, but 5 stars when I added more worcestershire to taste. Never buying store bought again.

Only had a tiny bit of ketchup left, but didn't want just ketchup on the steak I had just grilled.  I used the ingredients listed (minus the hot sauce) and it was delicious!!  I'll never use A1 again.  Making my own steak sauce from now on.

I personally do not care for A1 and the ingredients is this are all things that I like in moderation. This is a winner in my book. I reduced the quantity to 2 because the rest of my family loves A1 and doesn't like marinades so I made this just for me. Delicious! Thank you.

I think this sauce is outstanding.  It tastes like Heinz 57 but better, fresher.  We use it on everything, and it is so much cheaper than buying the bottled one.  Sorry Heinz!

Excellent! I usually prefer a good marinade to a steak sauce, but didn't have time tonight, so I looked this up instead. My husband doesn't use steak sauce, ever, but my son and I loved it. I omitted the salt (Worcestershire adds a lot of salt anyway), and it was plenty tasty enough. I'll be using this recipe again for sure!

Just ketchup with a little additives.  Husband did not like it.  Said it was too much ketchup and too much salt.  If you don't like ketchup, you won't like this.

Like everyone here came to this because I was out of A-1. It was pretty good. I did check the ingredients on A-1 and found it included raisin puree and orange puree so I added some prune puree (1-2 tbs) and a bit of orange zest and it was awesome!

Delicious! We decided to have steak at the last minute and almost changed our minds because I can't eat steak without A1. No longer! Amazing sauce and doesn't taste like ketchup. I added a bit more hot sauce because we like spicy. This will be a staple in our kitchen. I can't wait to try it on burgers!

I just bought a dry-aged steak and didn't realize that I didn't have any steak sauce. The steak was delicious on it's own, but I made this sauce to compliment it and I thought it was delicious. I used lemon pepper instead of the salt and pepper, spicy brown mustard and a dab of organic honey. I will make this sauce again for my sweetie!

I just made this.  It's pretty good.  I used Heinz ketchup and found I had to cut the sweetness a little with some extra vinegar.  I had some hot and spicy ketchup on hand and used that instead of hot sauce (I just substituted some of the regular ketchup.)  After that I added some extra Worcestershire sauce and a little liquid smoke. I'm planning to use it with a meatloaf recipe I found on this site for tonight's dinner.

Has that tart 'bite' that steak sauce should have.  This recipe is super simple!  We are visiting family so no sense in buying something they wouldn't use.  Threw this together with pantry items!

Meh.  Would've given it even less if possible.  This is like store-bought cocktail sauce with an extra splash of Worchestershire Sauce. Bo-ring.  I'll keep looking.

very good, easy to make, all ingredients normally in my pantry.  I served it with barbecued sirloin steak - my whole family enjoyed it.  I'll probably add just a bit more of the hot sauce next time.

I was looking for a sauce that would duplicate my favorite store bought steak sauce. This isn't quite it, but it is quite good. Until I find the clone of my favorite, I will keep this in our refrigerator. It's a zip to prepare. I used it as a condiment for Seasoned Turkey Burgers, which is a recipe I've used for years here at allrecipes.

Easy to make and pretty good, too! I added a bit of cumin and lessened the ketchup because I prefer it less sweet. Thanks!

This was a really good steak sauce, I wanted it a little spicier though so I added 2 tsp. chili powder and it was great. I'll make it again!

I'm giving it 4 stars because I used it in a hamburger recipe that called for steak sauce (I didn't have any) and the burgers turned out great. Alone, however, when I tasted the sauce, it was way too vinegary for my tastes. But try it in hamburgers, mine were great!

I was a little leary making steak sauce but this was perfect. Even my fussy daughter who HAS to have our regular brand on her steak reluctantly tried it and loved it!

A tasty sauce but the mustard was a bit overpowering. I will use about half the mustard called for next time.

So easy to whip up with ingredients I already had on hand.  Great tasting too.
