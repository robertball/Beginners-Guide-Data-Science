This was my first time making sunchokes. They came in my weekly produce delivery and I was looking for a simple way to make them. Well this recipe is simple and delicious!  You do not need 3/4c of oil. I probably used the equivalent of 2 -3 tbsp and I can't imagine using any more. Great flavor and perfectly cooked after 35 mins. I'll be making it a point to buy these more often!

This was the first time we had sunchokes.  I highly recommend them.  They were like a nice sweet tasting potato. But not like a sweet potato. However, too much olive oil called for here. They really only get coated and a couple of tablespoons will do that. They also took more like an hour and a bit. We used fresh thyme because we had it.  I will do this again but not that much EVOO.  3 stars for the idea but sorry, the measurements and time were very off in my opinion.

Great recipe ! I love sunchokes but most recipes call for it peeled and in a creamy soup, so it's nice to have a quick recipe that's a healthier option. Only thing I changed was adding some fresh rosemary from my garden with the thyme.  Side note - you might want to take some Beano before indulging in these -- sunchokes can make you more "musical" than beans!! Thanks for the recipe!

I roast sun chokes along with other veggies like onions, bell peppers, cauliflower, and zucchini.  The recipe calls for way too much oil... just use enough oil to coat then add whatever herbs you like and a little salt and pepper.  I usually roast at 400ºF for about 40-50 minutes, stirring around about half way through.  Delicious, nutritious, and easy.

I saw sunchokes in my local farmers market and decided to be adventurous so of course I came to allrecipes to find out how to make them! This recipe was very simple and the results were yummy! My only modification was to spray the sunchoke slices with olive oil (using my misto) and toss with the herbs since we're trying to eat healthier. Can't say I missed the extra oil so I will continue to make the sunchokes this way and will definitely experiment with different herbs in the future (garlic and rosemary are next)! Thanks qwertycook for a simple and delicious recipe!

These were great. First time we've tried Jerusalem Artichokes. We just washed and halved them and cut the eyes off as suggested. No need to use 3/4 cup of oil, a few tablespoons did the trick. Just enough to make the herbs stick. Don't overoast, just till they are tender. Delicious and different.

This was my first time making sunchokes and I have been really happy with this recipe: a very yummy side dish tasting like sweet artichokes and roasted potatoes. Since I like fresh herbs, I simply tossed the sunchokes in little olive oil, salt and pepper and then sprinkled fresh lemon thyme all over just prior serving which added a nice lemony tang.

Is it possible to go wrong with thyme, garlic, salt, and olive oil?  If so, I don't know about it yet.  I would say, though, that 3/4 c. olive oil is way too much, both in terms of budget and calories!  I actually doubled the recipe, and I found that 3 tbsp of olive oil was 100% perfect for the two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes.  I also added a few dashes of pepper and reduced the amount of thyme just a bit as well, but all in all, this is delishe!

Very easy and a good way to use such a wonderful vegetable.  We ate these frequently when I was a child, but they must have fallen out of favor in recent decades.  It's too bad, because they have a delicate flavor. I found that even though it is a little extra work, it is a good idea to peel the Sunchokes after scrubbing them.

I ate nearly a pound of these roasted for dinner one night, so tasty!  Then, four hours later my body violently rejected them.

Simple and easy to make. I didn’t use all the oil listed. I got by with about a tbsp and a half. I will toss them about 20 minutes after cooking. Mine got crispy brown only on the parts touching the pan. Thank you for the recipe.

Found myself intrigued after seeing Sunflower Chokes at my local store. After a little research, I decided to give them a try. I followed this recipe to the letter altering only the oil( I used Mushroom infused Olive Oil). Have to say it turned out better than I dreamed of. My wife raved about the new found flavor. I will certainly make this again and may or may not choose to tweak it.

I made it just as the recipe called. Next time I would use less olive oil - 1/2 cup ish. I don't know how old my sunchokes were, a friend gave them to me. The skins were a little tough. I definitely would make this recipe again.

I cubed a sweet potatoe and the sunchokes, roasted 35 minutes, then added quartered crimini mushrooms and parboiled 1/2” sliced carrots (tossed in the oil/spice mix)  for 10 more minutes of roasting.  This was absolutely delish, definitely doing this again!!!

This was easy to make and yummy! They taste more like roasted turnips, but look like roasted potatoes.

This is the first time I've had sunchomes and they were delicious.  I used 3 T of olive oil which was all that was needed.

A great addition to mixed roasted vegetables.
