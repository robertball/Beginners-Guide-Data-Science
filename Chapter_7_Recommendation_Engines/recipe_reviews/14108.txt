I used good bell peppers and lots of fresh-squeezed lime in this.  The serrano pepper I'd bought got lost somewhere in the fridge, so I had to use canned jalepenos.  This was still a wonderful dish that got better the longer it sat.  (But it only sat for a day, in spite of the fact that I made a double recipe.  It was very popular.)  I recommend that you drain the chickpeas and lentils for awhile in a colander in the sink -- this prevented my salad from getting soggy.

This was great but I did some modifications. I eliminated the olive oil to cut the calories and I added feta cheese in place of that. I also upped the lentils to 1 cup and eliminated the garbanzo beans. I added chooped fresh mint and some white balsamic vinegaar, garlic powder and cumin.

Wow was this good! The fresh Cilantro was really the star and really brightened the flavor. And the lime just pulled it all together. I made a couple changes because I forgot to buy some ingredients or they were not available. I substituted some sweet onion for the green onion- a red one would have been fine too. Also it's January so there are no real tomatoes on the east coast right now so I used canned tomatoes with jalapeno peppers (well drained) in place of the tomatoes and hot peppers- gave it the perfect amount of heat. This is a definite do again! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is a great salad! I gave this recipe four stars for quickness since I buzzed my veggies through a food processor.  The peppers would be more colorful in the dish if chopped larger, but that would add to the time. And it still presented nicely!  I added extra cilantro and lime, which was great, and I used very mild peppers.  My four year old liked to eat the lentils, but nothing else.  My husband and I love it!

I had this salad at a Morrocan themed meal at my book club gathering.  It looked beautiful, but it didn't have much flavor...I'm wondering if the pepper was left out?  I would try again, though.  Don't want to give it a lower rating if something was substituted or left out. I don't think folks should give a low review when they change the recipe, which is something I've observed with some of the reviews on this site.  Doesn't seem fair!

Great recipe!  I didn't follow the exact measurements but used all the ingredients and it turned out great.  We served it with Nacho style chips and my kids ate it up.  Thanks so much!

BLAND, though visually and texturally appealing. If you're still determined to make this, then you'll want to DOUBLE the lentils and dress it up with some additional flavor (try balsamic vinegar, pepper, garlic powder, cumin and feta cheese) as it really doesn't taste like anything as-is. In fact, you may as well skip the olive oil and lime juice in favor of a tasty dressing instead. Meh.

Easy to make, sort of a mix betweeen salsa and bean salad. Very pretty and refreshing. Our kids liked it, but we left out the hot peppers.

I made a few changes-  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies to replace the tomatoes and chilies, then I added a second can of dice tomatoes (With no salt).  
I used a green, orange and red pepper, and then put in/ nibbled on another orange pepper.  Not sure how much I used all together, it's always hard to tell in my kitchen!
I used a whole can of garbanzo beans.
I didn't have any olive oil, so I left that out.

SUPER easy to make, very tasty!  The flavors were awesome, and I love the crunch of the peppers and the texture the lentils and garbanzo beans added.  I LOVED it.

THEN!  I took the left overs and put them in a flour tortilla with baby spinach leaves and had a super tasty burrito for dinner tonight.  The salad tasted so great after sitting for a day in the fridge.  Everything just blended together perfectly.  I think that the next time I make this I will make extra for a burrito or two, and I think I might make some flax seed tortillas.

Definitely, definitely making this again.

This is one of the best vegetarian recipes I have ever had!!! So fresh and so many vibrant colors and flavors.  I put a little fresh feta on top and added allspice and cumin to the lime juice/oil.  Mmmmmm!

This was very tasty.  I did follow some customized suggestions by adding turmeric, cayenne pepper and curry powder.  The lime juice and all of the fresh ingredients, especially the cilantro gave it a wonderful flavor.  I'll be making this again and I'm especially looking forward to making it this summer when the vegetables are seasonal.  Thank you Hetal.

This is an extremely flavourful recipe!  I made it without realizing I didn't have garbanzo beans on hand.  I also left out the chilis and used only one type of pepper as well as a normal onion opposed to a green one... and I love it.  Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic! I took another reviewer's advice to add feta cheese and I have to say that it added the perfect bit of tang, blending well with the spice of the dish. I served it warm over brown rice topped with a little baby spinach salad mix. Delish!

I'm rating it four stars because I did some tweaking. It tasted really awesome, though. I cooked the lentils in vegetable broth and probably used 2 cups of water total. I used the whole can of garbanzo beans and omitted the green & yellow pepper and replaced the olive oil with walnut oil. I subbed parsley for cilantro and add 2 tsp. of Bragg's Liquid Aminos (salt replacer). I also didn't use the whole lemon juice called out for and added a tsp. of garlic powder.

Really tasty. I also made it with mint instead of cilantro (didn't have it on hand) and a little bit of feta (needed to be used) and it was really tasty that way too! I only put one hot pepper in both times, I think next time I will up it to 2. Over all, this recipe is a great discovery, easy to make and easy to take for lunch/ a quick dinner.

Yum yum yum.  This is a perfect summer salad recipe.  I substituted red bell pepper for the yellow, which tastes just fine, but I would use the yellow pepper for sure if I were presenting for company or potluck because of the color of the salad.

Letting the salad sit a few hours really helped the flavor soak in, but it still wasn't enough for me.  Granted, I did have to leave out the chili pepper because I couldn't eat it, so I won't hold that against the recipe.  I like that it's healthy--incorporates EVOO, has protein and lots of fiber (plus, recent studies say mediteranean food is the healthiest).  If you're watching your carb intake, however, you'll want to look for another recipe or go easy on the serving.

Initally I thought it was a bit bland. So I added 1/2 chopped red onion,a little rice wine vinegar and a can of  diced tomatoes. It was great on a bed of greens. Very fresh tasting.

Beautiful salad but not enough flavor.  I added some garlic powder and cayenne after I mixed it according to recipe and that helped somewhat.  I'll try it again but will use less peppers and more lentils and chickpeas.

This was really good.  It's flavors were strong and satisfying while still clean and refreshing.  I had to substitute parsley for the cilantro, and it was good.  I look forward to trying it with cilantro too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I used canneloni beans, didn't have any garbanzos, threw in about a cup of cooked brown rice.  Was delicious, healthy and beautiful. A keeper for sure.

i, like most people, changed it a little bit. i didn't have cilantro, so instead i added 1/4 tsp ground cumin and 1/8 tsp ground ginger, which added a nice twist.  I served it with bulgur wheat. BULGUR WHEAT WAS A GREAT CHOICE.  i think this recipe is a great starting point for everyone to add their own personal twist without fear of messing it up.

Flavorful, colorful and crunchy . . . and good for you!  I cooked my own chick peas (garbanzo beans) starting with 1/2 cup dried.  They were much more tasty than anything from a can and had no added salt or other preservatives.  I also added some lime zest to the dressing and used halved grape tomatoes.

I think this recipe is good, yeah, but not as good as I expected based on the reviews. I found the lentils only took 10 mins to cook, and were mushy in the salad. Next time I will use half to a full can of lentils instead, as I find that they remain firm. I think additional items such as avocado would be nice, but that probably draws away from the ethnicity of it.

Pretty.  Easy.  Healthy.  I only had one jalapeno pepper and that was SPICY enough for my mouth.   Made a good lunch.  Nothing spectacular but definitely tasty.

This is a delicious and satisfying lentil salad.  The only thing I would change would be to not cook the lentils the 30 minutes that were suggested - they turned out a little mushy but firmed up when the salad chilled.  It was an awesome accompaniment to my grilled skirt steak.

I was looking for a recipe that would use up the large stash of lentils I seemed to have collected. And since it's summer, I didn't want to make a stew or soup. This recipe was surprisingly flavorful. I say surprisingly because the only extra flavoring comes from the lime juice. I didn't include the chickpeas since I was trying to use up  as much as I could of my lentils. And I left out of the cilantro as well as I'm not a big fan. I'd definitely make this again!

This was pretty good! I've been trying to eat more lentil's b/c they are healthy and this is a good option.  I did feel almost like it was missing something, so I added brown rice.

I increased the lentils to 1 cup and I also used one can of garbanzo beans. We enjoyed eating this with the scoop-shaped Tostitos chips. The olive oil/ lime dressing and the fresh cilantro make this colorful dish special.

This recipe will be repeated!  My market didn't have any hot green chile's so I used poblano, which just didn't have any heat to it.  So we added some hot sauce (not authentic, I know), and it was really good!  Next time, will make sure to have the hot peppers.  Thanks for another idea of how to get more legumes into our diet!

Will make this again. Followed the recipe as written however added slightly more cilantro and added extra salt. Amazing flavour add to its health benefits. Low fat, high in protein and completely vegan, if that's your thing.

This is an easy and delicious recipe, just the type of dish that I like for light, healthy lunches. My husband and I do enjoy hot peppers, so I included them, and enjoyed this salad very much. Only thing I will point out is that as written, this recipe makes a pretty generous amount of salad, so unless you are really good about using up your leftovers, you might want to consider making a half recipe.

This was great!  I agree with others that it may not be overly flavorful but that's o.k., the pure flavors of the ingredients are enough and work well together.  I did cook the lentils in chicken stock with a garlic clove thrown in to give them a little flavor but other than that I made it as written.  Will definitely make again!

I can not be fair  with the rating because I did not follow this recipe as is written.  I omitted the garbanzo and lentils And it still was pretty good. I can't wait to make it again with all the ingredients, maybe then it will get a 5star !

This is great.  I didn't have some of the ingredients and it turned out fabulous nonetheless. We actually used it as a side salad with a protein.  Goes great with Salmon.  I have been topping the left overs on my salad I take to work every day, and it's great like that, too.

I made the recipe for a picnic, exactly as directed except added the whole can of garbanzo beans and only used one hot pepper.  It was refreshing and perfect for a summer picnic!  The only criticism with it was that it need more salt, I had to agree and we didn't have any with us on the picnic. I only put a dash in.  Next time I will add more.

This became an instant hit the minute I served it. Since then I've made it three times. The lentils are really not the star in this meal, but rather the bits that bind the veggies together. Also, we found that the basic recipe as a side dish lasted for at least 10 people!

Very refreshing and yummy, left out the peppers, and it was a perfect side dish. Didn't keep very long----too wet----but a keeper recipe.

This was good. I had to modify the amounts of ingredients slightly because I felt like the lentils were drowned out. I did add some lime pulp. It was good and I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I prefer using two red bell peppers and one green. This was even a favorite for my non-veggie liking husband!

Delicious, light, refreshing, simple, and beautiful! We loved this salad. I actually used sprouted lentils, and they made the dish that much fresher and crunchier. I left out the chickpeas, because I forgot to pick some up. If I had used them, I'd have sprouted them, but I think this salad is great without and will not add them in the future. I love how simple the dressing is (I did add 1/4 tsp sea salt)--it really lets the flavors of the veggies come through. Also, it wasn't as hot as I expected--and I used two very large jalapenos--so I wouldn't be too afraid of the hot peppers; just make sure you seed them.

I liked the recipe very colorful however, I slim down on the chick peas.  My husband is Moroccan and he didn't recogonize this recipe.  Has this recipe been modified?

This salad is so pretty and colorful. I added  some cooked couscous to this to make it a whole meal. Thanks!
