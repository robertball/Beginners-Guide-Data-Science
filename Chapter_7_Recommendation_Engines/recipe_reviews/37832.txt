Yummy. Hubby is a Southerner and insisted on this for Thanksgiving. (A tradition so he says but they serve it year round) I've never made it and hubby was determined to be highly critical of any that I made. This recipe did the trick. It wasn't too expensive adding cream cheese and condensed milk like other recipes. It was just simple and cheap to make. It wasn't hard like the ones where you make cooked pudding and meringue either. Easy and hubby gobbled it up with raves.

This is a family tradition...my mother always preferred vanilla pudding instead of the banana cream as it can sometimes have a "fake" taste.  This is also good with graham cracker crumbs instead of the vanilla wafers.  It's one of those recipes that anyone can make and most everyone loves!!  A++++

Awesome, yet easy!!  My husband usually makes it the old-fashioned, true southern, messy kitchen way and he LOVED my quick, no-cook way better!!  I sprinkled some cinnamon on top to give it some "right-outta-the-oven" color and this addition gave it an extra special kick of flavor!!  We will never make banana pudding by the old school rules again!!

I LOVED this recipe. After being told I had to cut my sugar intake by more than half (gestational diabetes) I still wanted something sweet.I used sugar free vanilla pudding, sugar free nilla wafers, and sugar free cool whip.  It  tasted the same to me and I cut almost all of the sugars out of it!!

While this is very easy to do, it doesn't hold a candle to the cooked pudding and meringue banana pudding I grew up with.

My family members, which are die hard southerners who enjoy food prepared the old-fashioned way absolutely LOVED this lighter, fluffier version of the traditional Banana Pudding.  I enjoy making this version for those who come to my home to enjoy a truly southern meal.  They leave satisfied and full of smiles!

Good but I prefer the old fashion taste of vanilla pudding cooked in a double boiler. LOL My grandmother made that way. This was a hit with the family but too cool whipish for me. I will make again because it was very easy to make and it was gone in a day.**Update 7/4/09** Add an additional package of pudding, it provides a "real" pudding taste, instead of a major cool whip taste.

This recipe is very simple and great tasting.  I used french vanilla flavored pudding instead of banana cream flavored and when I make this again, I'll probably soak the bananas in something sweet to add sweetness and more flavor.

This is good, but to make a really southern treat, use Nutter Butter Cookies instead of vanilla wafers. This makes a Peanut Butter Banana Pudding! My friend's son eats a PB&B sandwich every day and he loves this version!!

This was the exact recipe I was looking for and none of my southern family members knew why our grandmother's pudding was so light, and now I know it is the whipped cream! Thanks so much!

Delicious.  Along with the two cups of milk I added a small can of sweetened condensed milk.  It was sweet, fluffy and delicious!!  Especially when the vanilla wafers get soft.  Yummy!

The only difference when I made it was, I put a layer of wafers, then bananas, then pudding mix, then cool whip, (instead of mixing the cool whip with the pudding).  My family loves it.  GEE

Tasty pudding, do not see the point of the wafers which add nothing of benefit at all we actually ate around them and left them for waste. Next time no wafers.Otherwise good flavour.

I always crush the cookies rather than using them whole. This is one of those dishes that takes me back to family reunions when I was a kid. Comfort food at it's best.

Soooo easy and good!
Made this for a potluck at work, served it in a trifle dish. It looked and tasted awesome. You can't beat this for something fast and inexpensive.

This is such an easy recipe, and it turned out creamy and light.  I made it for a fourth of July weekend BBQ.  I didn't use 3 bananas but only one, and I didn't use as many wafers either, but it turned out wonderful!

This isn't my Mama's cooked pudding, but its still wonderful.  Very sweet and creamy, and so easy that my kids make this by themselves.  Sprinkle the top with crumbled vanilla wafers to make it pretty.

My mom use to make this all the time when me and my brothers were kids. She passed away and I had no idea how to make it. Did a search here and came up with a ton of recipes. I decided on this one because I knew it was pretty simple the one my mom made. This was the one. Brings back alot of memories. I printed this one out and added it to my collection and will make it often. The kids and the hubby loved it.

This is how I have made this recipe since I have learned to make banana pudding. It is best to me after refrigerated for a little while when the cookies get soft.

This was very simple and taste great. The one thing that I did was let it refrigerate overnight after I made it so the cookies could get soft.

The only thing I do differently is THREE cups of milk and TWO pkgs of the vanilla pudding.  It's not often that I get any of this - that's how fast it goes.

This is great for a quick and easy dessert!  I usually add 8oz of sour cream to the pudding and cool whip mixture and I have used vanilla pudding as well.  The layers of wafers become cake-like after a few hours in the refrigerator.  Delicious!

I personally do not care for the "fake" banana taste of the banana cream pudding.  It' very easy to make a real banana pudding and that, IMO, tastes so much better.

Yummy and so easy!  I didn't assemble the whole dessert but put into individual bowls as we wanted to eat it.  That way we could eat it the next day without the vanilla wafers being soggy.

Not really southern banana pudding but still good.  Very simple to make.  The true souther banana pudding incorporates a nice meringue crust and cream in the pudding.
