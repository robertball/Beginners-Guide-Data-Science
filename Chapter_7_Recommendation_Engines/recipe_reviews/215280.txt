HOLY MOLY!! This is an incredible salad! So fresh, it is very refreshing!! I made it as per instructions except minus the onion since I didn't have a red onion on hand and I am 45 miles from the grocery store but the flavor is FAB! If anyone complains that there isn't meat protein in this dish, serve it alongside some tuna and some bread with melted cheese on it!!!

I made this to take to work for lunch.  It's good on its own or with lettuce, which I did to make it a meal.  I really like the lemon flavor.  I don't care too much for chilled tomatoes, so next time I'll add just before serving or leave them out.

YUMMY!!!! My 11 year old daughter and I just finished making this, and we could not stop "tasting" the warm salad waiting to go in the fridge. I did not have cilantro, though I am sure it would have made it taste even better. Didn't use olives, and put in one extra tomato and red and yellow bell pepper in place of the green. This is so good!!

Good recipe and fully enjoyed.  NOTE:  You MUST rinse your dried lentils very well before using.

I used double the amount of water as lentils, so I didn't have to drain anything, and used a yellow onion instead of the red variety.  Great tasting salad!  I'll be making this again.

Aptly named, this colorful lentil salad is indeed refreshing and delicious.  I used quartered cherry tomatoes because that is what I had available and I did not bother with the hard boiled eggs.  Iâ€™m always looking for a unique and tasty side to bring to a barbeque and this fits the bill.  It is also wonderful as a light lunch served on a bed of lettuce with peak season sliced tomatoes layered with fresh mozzarella on the side.

This is a nice change of pace.  I did not have a green chili, so I used 3 shakes of tabasco sauce, otherwise I made it as written.  I will make again, it would be good to take to a picnic.

This beautiful dish has excellent texture, but i found it in need of a punch of flavor. Increasing the heat with a jalapeno pepper, adding more fresh herbs, or increasing lemon juice might help. I will certainly make this again.

Such an awesome recipe - thank you for sharing!! Lentils were finished in 15 minutes FYI and I cooked them in chicken bouillon. I just made it and between me and my hubby it is now almost gone so next time I will definitely double it. I forgot the chili pepper and instead used a few shakes of ground red pepper. Used 1.5 lemons. LOVED IT.

I had guests who like to eat pretty much meatless so I made this.  It was just fantastic.  I have not used lentils before and am so glad I finally tried them.  Delicious!  THIS is going to be a regular for us now.  Healthy and great tasting!  I would not change a thing and I followed the directions except did add more liquid.  Also, after we ate, I realized that I forgot the eggs.  Oh well, was great anyway!

I used this as a basic recipe and played around with it a bit. Trader Joes has a great packaged lentil which is all ready to go. I added everything but also added cucumber, red pepper, kalamata olives, only half the lemon. I didn't add the lemon zest or the cilantro. I added some diced jalepeno pepper, sea salt, and curry powder. I left out the eggs as I am vegan. Super easy and yummy!

This was an excellent lentil salad! I used cherry tomatoes instead of seeded Roma tomato and white onion instead of red. I will make this again.

Very good.  I actually don't care for many of the ingredients, but together they are great.  I cut down on the olive oil as I'm dieting, and added a bit of fresh mint.

I was hesitant to make this recipe as just about everything is raw. I personally am not a raw onion or garlic type of person. With that in mind I went ahead with the recipe as it states. I figured I would try it and if I didn't love it I would play around with it. Honestly though with the lemon it is very balanced. Can't believe how much I loved this recipe.I will not be changing it, at least for now. Yum!!!!

I used kalamata olives which I chopped, and parsley instead of cilantro.  This is so good.  Definitely use a nice large lemon. I really didn't think that the hard boiled eggs added anything to this salad and recommend not bothering with them.

I also used a jalapeno because that's what I had and this recipe is very good.  I served it with homemade chunky applesauce which was a perfect compliment.

The lemon flavour was overpowering and the other vegetables couldn't compete for the flavours. It does definitely need the olives, though.

Don't overcook the lentils or they get mushy.  20 minutes is about the top simmering time for brown lentils.

Holy moly!  This is incredibly delicious!  The only thing I did different was add a little more cilantro to it (only because I didn't want to waste the little extra bit of cilantro I had) and it is really good.  I am certain I'll be making this again for not just here at home, but to bring to get togethers (:

I just thought that between the zest and the juice, this dressing was overwhelmingly lemony and covered the taste of the veggies.

I combined this recipe with the Summer Lentil Salad and recipe because I wanted more stuff in my salad. I added 1/4 cup of chopped cucumber. It came out tremendous.
